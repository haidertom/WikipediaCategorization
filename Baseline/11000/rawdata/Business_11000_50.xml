[[File:Saskatoon 056.jpg|thumb|McNab Park residential area prior to demolition]]
'''Airport Business Area''' is an [[industrial park]] located in the [[North Industrial SDA, Saskatoon|North Industrial SDA]] Suburban Development Area of [[Saskatoon]], [[Saskatchewan]]. Industrial parks are usually located close to [[transport]] facilities, especially where [[intermodal freight transport|more than one transport modalities]] coincide. The Idylwyld Drive North, [[Saskatchewan Highway 11|Sk Hwy 11 Louis Riel Trail]], and  [[Saskatchewan Highway 12|Sk Hwy 12]] concurrency are all accessed directly from the Airport Business Area. The [[Saskatoon John G. Diefenbaker International Airport]] is north of the Airport Business Area. Circle Drive marks the southern boundary, with access to [[Saskatchewan Highway 14|SK Hwy 14]] and [[Saskatchewan Highway 16|Sk Hwy 16, the Yellowhead Trans Canada]].

==Geography==
[[File:Saskatoon 050.jpg|thumb|Hudson Bay Slough, Idylwyld Drive Parclo Interchange in distance. Airport Business Area, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan]]
The land was annexed from the [[rural municipality]] of [[Corman Park No. 344, Saskatchewan|Corman Park]] between 1965-1969. The Airport Business subdivision is several major trucking routes. The Idylwyld Drive North, [[Saskatchewan Highway 11|Sk Hwy 11 Louis Riel Trail]] to [[Prince Albert, Saskatchewan|Prince Albert]] via [[Warman, Saskatchewan|Warman]], and  [[Saskatchewan Highway 12|Sk Hwy 12]] to [[Blaine Lake]] via [[Martensville, Saskatchewan|Martensville]] concurrency mark the eastern boundary.  [[Circle Drive]] marks the southern boundary, with access to [[Saskatchewan Highway 14|SK Hwy 14]] and [[Saskatchewan Highway 16|Sk Hwy 16, the Yellowhead Trans Canada]].   It is a main thoroughfare through the city connecting [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]], [[Saskatoon]] and [[Prince Albert, Saskatchewan]]. It also connects west Saskatoon with the bedroom communities of [[Warman, Saskatchewan|Warman]] and [[Martensville, Saskatchewan|Martensville]].

The area includes the western end of the Hudson Bay Slough, a water feature that used to dominate the northern end of Saskatoon. Much of the slough has been drained for development, but a large remnant has been preserved east of Avenue C and north of 45th Street as part of RCAF Memorial Park.

===McNab Park - Airport Industrial - Larkhaven===

Until the early 2000s, the Airport Business Area consisted of three separate districts:

'''McNab Park''', a small [[residential]] community that served as [[Barracks|military housing]] until the 1960s when Saskatoon's airport ceased to double as an [[air base]], and continued to be used for low-cost housing&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saskatoon.ca/org/development/resources/business_profile_newsletters/newsletter_summer2001.pdf BUSINESS PROFILE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201065856/http://www.saskatoon.ca/org/development/resources/business_profile_newsletters/newsletter_summer2001.pdf |date=2007-12-01 }} URL accessed January 27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; until the early 2010s;

'''Airport Industrial''', a business/[[Commercial district|commercial park]] that developed east of the airport and east of McNab Park beginning in the 1970s;

'''Lark Haven''' (alternately spelled Larkhaven), another business park that developed south of McNab Park in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.valuation-net.com/affiliates/brunsdon/articles/office2001.pdf 2000 to 2001 Saskatoon Office Study] URL accessed January 27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The Airport Business Area also includes a newly plotted, but as of 2017 undeveloped business park west of the Lark Haven section and east of [[Hampton Village, Saskatoon|Hampton Village]], which will also include a major commercial area.

An oddity to the area is Lark Place. This street has been shown on maps as a street that crossed at the intersection of [[Circle Drive]] and Airport Drive since the mid-1980s. Despite it still appearing on maps, Lark Place is considered a [[paper street]] with no plans for it to be developed in the near future.

McNab Park was decommissioned as a residential area in the early 2010s and all structures were demolished by early 2012 (its school was closed and demolished in the early 1980s); it is now being redeveloped as a business park (including several hotels), with a new street layout and new street names allocated. It remains to be seen if the longstanding street names in the area (Jeremy, Maney, etc.) are reassigned to other communities.

==Economy==
[[File:AirportBusinessArea.jpg|thumb|left|Saskatoon Airport Business Area.]]
The Airport Business Area park is a mix of commercial and industrial concerns south east of the  [[Saskatoon John G. Diefenbaker International Airport]].   Areva NC (formerly named COGEMA resources), R.C.A.F. Memorial Park, Saskatoon Machine Works, Shaw Communications, Global Television are businesses based in the airport business park. Saskatoon Inn, Heritage Inn, Travelodge, Mainstay, Courtyard Marriot, Hampton Inn &amp; Suites by Hilton, Sandman Hotel and Country Inn and Suites are next to the airport for the travelling business person. Saskatoon Hyundai and Auto Clearing are auto dealerships which make their home base in the Airport Business Area.

In the Airport Business Area subdivision are 3374 full-time employees and 841 part-time employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Future plans==
[[File:McNabPark.jpg|thumb|McNab Park Airport Business Area Saskatoon Sk]]
The airport business area is a part of the local area plans of the City of Saskatoon infrastructure development. Some of the upcoming plans are to structure Airport Drive as a "Gateway to Saskatoon", and the residential component at McNab Park was removed prior to 2011, with the area now being revamped for light industrial and business park uses. Other plans include renaming the area to Airport Business Area from Airport Industrial Area, and incorporating the proposed Hampton Industrial area within Airport Business Area. Development of the area west of Airport Drive and northwest of Circle Drive and reserving the Larkhaven Park formation as a park space are also in the plans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.city.saskatoon.sk.ca/org/city_planning/local_area_plans/plans_being_implemented/airport_industrial_presentation.pdf Airport Industrial Local Area Plan Airport Industrial Local Area Plan] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929110444/http://www.city.saskatoon.sk.ca/org/city_planning/local_area_plans/plans_being_implemented/airport_industrial_presentation.pdf |date=2007-09-29 }} URL accessed January 27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Summary Notes_134719046 |work=Local Area Plan Airport Business Area |publisher=City of Saskatoon |url=http://www.city.saskatoon.sk.ca/org/city_planning/local_area_plans/plans_being_implemented/lap_recommendations/airport_industrial_implementation_summary.pdf |accessdate=2008-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026033506/http://www.city.saskatoon.sk.ca/org/city_planning/local_area_plans/plans_being_implemented/lap_recommendations/airport_industrial_implementation_summary.pdf |archivedate=October 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However plans as of late 2017 call for Aerogreen Road to be extended south from Cynthia Street, which will bisect the park; the same plans also show a major commercial development earmarked for the intersection of Claypool Drive and McClocklin Road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.saskatoon.ca/sites/default/files/documents/community-services/planning-development/mapping/wall-maps/index_nhoods_map.pdf|title= City of Saskatoon Neighbourhood Boundaries Map|author=City of Saskatoon |date= Nov 20, 2017 |website= City of Saskatoon|publisher= |access-date= Dec 3, 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ashot Gevorkovich Egiazaryan''' (Russian: Ашот Геворкович Егиазарян; Armenian: Աշոտ Գեւորգովիչ Էկիազարյան), born July 24, 1965 in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]] is fugitive from political persecution (accounts vary), former Russian politician, and businessman.

==Career==

===Banking===
In 1988, Egiazaryan graduated from the Economics Faculty of Moscow State University with a Ph.D.  in economics, and subsequently began a career in banking.

In 1993, Egiazaryan established and became the Chairman of the Moscow National Bank (MNB).  By 1995, MNB had become one of the largest banks in Russia, housing accounts of the Administration of Moscow region, The Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, Russian State Arms Export Company, The Russian Space Agency and the General Prosecutor’s Office.

In 1996, Egiazaryan was appointed Deputy Chairman of the Board of Directors of “Unikombank” JSCB, a position he held from June 1996 to May 1998.

In 1999, Egiazaryan provided testimony in the criminal case regarding the embezzlement of $130 million from accounts held at MNB. The embezzled funds belonged to state-owned Rosvooruzheniye Weaponry Company. The investigation found that MNB used forged documents to withdraw the state funds.  The stolen money was then moved through the MNB-controlled Unikom bank.

MNB’s banking license was revoked in 1998, but no criminal charges were brought against Egiazaryan.

===Politics===
In 1999, Egiazaryan became a member of the State Duma and deputy chairman of the Committee on Budget and Taxes.

In October 2010, the State Duma’s Credentials and Ethics Commission recommended stripping Egiazaryan of parliamentary immunity at the request of the Investigative Committee.
  
On November 3, 2010, the State Duma followed through with a request by Russian Prosecutor General Yury Chaika and officially stripped Egiazaryan of his immunity. A total of 352 lawmakers of the Duma voted in favor of this action, with 39 deputies, all members of the Liberal Democratic Party, opposing the motion and five members abstained from the vote.&lt;ref&gt;“In the Deputy Signs of Fraud Were Found.” [http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?DocsID=1528001&amp;NodesID=6 Kommersant.ru]. October 23, 2010. (Russian language)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal Indictment==
In August 2010, Europark investor Vitaly Smagin filed a lawsuit against Egiazaryan, accusing him of pledging Smagin’s stake in the Europark shopping mall in western Moscow to Deutsche Bank as collateral on an $87.5M loan.  The $87.5M loan was then used to secure a 20% interest in the Moskva Hotel project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=250 |url=http://www.wek.ru/articles/politic/76017.shtml |title=Жириновскому не простят Егиазаряна |publisher=Wek.ru |date=2010-08-26 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, after the commencement of a criminal investigation into the $87.5M fraud, Egiazaryan filed a claim in a Cyprus court complaining that a group of Russian politicians, and businessmen, including [[Suleyman Kerimov]], conspired to take over Egiazaryan’s share in the multi-billiondollar Moskva Hotel project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Belton |first=Catherine |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/ef30542c-c67b-11df-8a9f-00144feab49a.html#ixzz16Cm02qTO |title=Russian tycoon’s assets frozen |publisher=FT.com |date=2010-09-22 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On September 15, 2010, a Cyprus court granted an injunctive freeze on Suleyman Kerimov’s assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Orphanides |first=Stelios |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-11-17/kerimov-set-to-challenge-asset-freeze-in-dec-14-court-hearing.html |title=Kerimov Set to Challenge Asset Freeze in Dec. 14 Court Hearing |publisher=Bloomberg |date=2010-11-17 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The case was later dismissed on February 15, 2011 and the district court of Nicosia in Cyprus lifted the injunction on Kerimov’s assets.   The court stated that Egiazaryan had failed to disclose essential facts in the original filing for the injunction and that the alleged conspiracy happened 15 months before the filing of the original complaint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Orphanides |first=Stelios |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-15/cyprus-court-lifts-freeze-on-russia-billionaire-kerimov-s-assets.html |title=Cyprus Court Lifts Freeze on Uralkali, Polyus Stock |publisher=Bloomberg |date=2011-02-15 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010 the State Duma’s Credentials and Ethics Commission recommended stripping Egiazaryan of parliamentary immunity at the request of the Investigative Committee, based on accusations that Egiazaryan embezzled $87 million for his share of the Hotel Moskva project.&lt;ref&gt;“Parliament member sued for embezzlement.” Russian Financial Control Monitor. August 24, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 3, 2010, the State Duma officially stripped Egiazaryan of his immunity.&lt;ref&gt;“Duma Deputy May Lose Immunity.” [http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/duma-deputy-may-lose-immunity/420806.html Moscow Times]. October 22, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010, investigators raided Egiazaryan’s offices at the Dayev Plaza and also conducted searches at Egiazaryan’s residences in Moscow. The search was later extended to the offices of the Europark shopping mall, of which Egiazaryan was a part owner.&lt;ref&gt;“Investigators searched the office deputy from the LDPR Ashot Yeghiazaryan.” ''[https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ru&amp;u=http://www.yerkramas.org/2010/11/08/sledovateli-obyskali-kabinet-deputata-ot-ldpr-ashota-egiazaryana/&amp;ei=bKbZTNPFIcb_lgeUw83LCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBUQ7gEwAA&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3Dhttp://www.yerkramas.org/2010/11/08/sledovateli-obyskali-kabinet-deputata-ot-ldpr-ashota-egiazaryana/%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26hs%3Ddzu%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26prmd%3Div Yerkarmas]''.

On December 17, 2010, the Russian Authorities seized three land plots belonging to Egiazaryan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The Moscow Times|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/yegiazaryans-land-seized/427023.html|title=Yegiazaryan's Land Seized|date=17 December 2010|accessdate=23 January 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101222133520/http://themoscowtimes.com/news/article/yegiazaryans-land-seized/427023.html| archivedate= 22 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; One plot is located in Barvikha, and the other two in Zhukovka.

In January 2011, the Basmanny district court of Moscow indicted Egiazaryan on charges of large scale fraud.    The court also attached Egiazaryan’s assets to be used to compensate Vitaly Smagin and Europark for the $87.5M that was embezzled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.sledcom.ru/news/40240.html?sphrase_id=169159 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130706102316/http://www.sledcom.ru/news/40240.html?sphrase_id=169159 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-07-06 |title=В рамках уголовного дела в отношении Ашота Егиазаряна наложен арест на денежные средства и ценные бумаги |publisher=Sledcom.ru |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the court ruling, the lower house of parliament in Russia gave approval on March 9, 2011 for Egiazaryan’s arrest on charges of large-scale fraud.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==Arrival in the United States==
After being indicted for fraud in Russia, Egiazaryan fled to the United States, claiming that he feared for his life and that the fraud allegations against him were politically motivated.&lt;ref name="jewishjournal1"&gt;{{cite web|author=peter zalmayev |url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/opinion/article/hiding_in_beverly_hills_20110309 |title=Hiding in Beverly Hills &amp;#124; Opinion |publisher=Jewish Journal |date=2011-03-09 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Zalmayev]], director of the Eurasia Democracy Initiative (EDI), stated, “Egiazaryan claims he is fleeing persecution, but the real reason appears to be that he is fleeing prosecution. His lawyers are reportedly seeking political asylum for their client.”&lt;ref name="jewishjournal1"/&gt;

Egiazaryan later sued Zalmayev for defamation and Zalmayev countersued for infringement of his speech utilizing the anti-[[SLAPP|Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation]] laws of New York State.  Egiazaryan’s case was dismissed, but Zalmayev’s case continues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=leagle.com |url=http://www.leagle.com/xmlResult.aspx?xmldoc=In%20FDCO%2020111208B70.xml&amp;docbase=CsLwAr3-2007-Curr |title=EGIAZARYAN v.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6742">'''Mohamad "Bob" Hasan''' (born 1931) is an [[Indonesia]]n businessman, former Minister of Trade and Industry, and friend of former [[president of Indonesia]], [[Suharto]].

==Early life==
Hasan, was born in [[Semarang]], [[Central Java]], Indonesia in February 1931. He is a legally adopted son of [[Gatot Soebroto|Gatot Subroto]], a general in the [[Indonesian Army]], who commanded then-Colonel Suharto in the 1950s, and through whom Hasan met Suharto.

==Business career==
After Suharto replaced Subroto as commander of the Army's Diponegoro Division, Hasan worked with Suharto to develop a wide range of side businesses, controlled by the military, that provided much of the funding for the Division as well as extra income for its officers.&lt;ref name="barr1998"&gt;Barr, Christopher M (1998). [http://cip.cornell.edu/Dienst/UI/1.0/Summarize/seap.indo/1106953918 Bob Hasan, the rise of Apkindo, and the shifting dynamics of control in Indonesia's timber sector]. ''Indonesia'' 65:1-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Suharto took the presidency in 1966, he initiated a massive expansion of Indonesian commercial logging, especially in the islands outside of [[Java]].  In the 1970s Hasan served as the required Indonesian "partner" for foreign companies wanting to harvest timber in Indonesia, working most notably with the [[United States]] corporation [[Georgia Pacific]], and also established a number of joint ventures between his and government-owned companies. In 1981 the government banned the export of unmilled timber, leading to many foreign companies selling their Indonesian operations to domestic owners interested in establishing processing operations; Hasan, already a major shareholder in Georgia Pacific's Indonesia operation, became its sole owner when the company left Indonesia in 1983.&lt;ref name="barr1998"/&gt;  Starting from timber, he expanded his business interests into financial, insurance, automotive, and other industries, primarily through his Kalimanis [[holding company]].&lt;ref name="saragosa"&gt;Saragosa, Manuel (1997). Indonesian tycoon plays influential role. ''Financial Times'' February 13. p 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Hasan's Kalimanis group was reported to control over 2 million hectares (7,700 square miles) of prime concessions in [[Kalimantan]].&lt;ref name="Economist1997"/&gt;

Hasan was also Chairman of the Indonesian Wood Panel Association (Apkindo) Under Hasan, Apkindo was given complete control of plywood pricing, marketing, and exports. Apkindo helped Indonesia gain about three-quarters of the worldwide plywood export market by the early 1990s, sometimes using techniques described by observers as "[[predatory pricing]]". Hasan personally profited from his chairmanship both by supporting business he owned, and through control of the fees paid to the organization by other members.&lt;ref name="barr1998"/&gt;

Hasan ran PT Nusantara Ampera Bakti (Nusamba) which is 80%-owned by foundations controlled by Suharto.&lt;ref name="Economist1997"&gt;{{cite web|title=Indonesia’s Uncle Bob (Mar 27, 1997)|url=http://www.economist.com/node/367251?_ga=1.41763362.1244557049.1469992653|publisher=The economist|accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WSJ021697&gt;{{cite news|last1=Borsuk|first1=Richard|title=Freeport Beats Out Canadians To Develop Busang Gold Mine|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB856111694777478500|accessdate=31 July 2016|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=Feb 16, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hasan was said to become the mediator in disputes between Suharto's six children, after the death of Suharto's wife.&lt;ref name="Economist1997"/&gt; He was reported to orchestrate the deal of settling shareholder dispute of the Busang gold deposit found by [[Bre-X Minerals]] in Kalimantan.&lt;ref name="Economist1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name=WSJ021697/&gt;

==Indonesian cabinet ministry==
Suharto appointed Hasan Minister of Trade and Industry in 1998, making him the only Indonesian of Chinese descent ever to join Suharto's cabinet.  His appointment was criticised by some foreign financial analysts as evidence that Suharto was not interested in substantial fiscal changes after the [[East Asian financial crisis|Asian financial crisis]] began in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, Barry (1998). Suharto cronies dominate new financial team. ''South China Morning Post'' March 15.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) requirements during the crisis, Apkindo was closed down in 1998.&lt;ref name="cotton1999"&gt;Cotton, James (1999). The "haze" over Southeast Asia: challenging the ASEAN mode of regional engagement. ''Pacific Affairs'' 72(3):331-351.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corruption convictions and imprisonment==
Hasan was frequently the subject of allegations of corruption as a result of his business dealings and control of much of Indonesian industry; after Suharto stepped down in 1998, a series of court judgements found evidence of crimes.  He was fined 50 billion [[Indonesian rupiah|rupiah]] ([[United States dollar|US$]]7 million) as a result of a lawsuit filed by several youth organisations, alleging that Hasan had ordered the burning of  forests in [[Sumatra]].&lt;ref name="cotton1999"/&gt; In February 2001, a court unanimously convicted him of causing a US$244 million loss to the Indonesian government through a fraudulent forest-mapping project in Java in the early 1990s, leading to imprisonment. He was imprisoned at [[Cipinang prison]] and then at the more secure [[Nusa Kambangan]], an island off the coast of south-central Java, until his release on [[parole]] in February 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Donnan, Shawn (2004). Jailed ex-tycoon Hasan is released early in Indonesia. ''Financial Times'' February 23. p 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Hasan was the first and among the most prominent of former Suharto associates convicted of fraud and corruption after Suharto resigned in May 1998.

Hasan was a member of the [[International Olympic Committee]] from 1994 to 2004, when the IOC expelled him due to his corruption conviction.  The IOC was criticised by the Indonesian government in 2000 after the IOC argued that Hasan should be allowed to attend the [[2000 Olympic Games]] in Sydney, Australia despite his being under arrest at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Bita, Natasha (2000). IOC tries to get its own out of jail. ''The Australian''. September 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]]'s '''Bureau of International Information Programs''' ('''IIP''') supports the department's public diplomacy efforts by providing and supporting the places, content, and infrastructure needed for sustained conversations with foreign audiences.  IIP is one of three bureaus that report to the Undersecretary for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs.  The [[Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs]] and the [[Bureau of Public Affairs]] are the sister bureaus.

== History ==

When the Foreign Affairs and Restructuring Act abolished the [[United States Information Agency]] (USIA) on October 1, 1999, USIA's broadcasting functions were moved to the newly created [[Broadcasting Board of Governors]] (BBG), and its non-broadcasting information functions were given to the newly created Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs.  The Bureau of International Information Programs was created out of this restructuring.

== Mission and purpose ==

According to the bureau's page on the Department of State website, IIP "provides and supports the places, content, and infrastructure needed for sustained conversations with foreign audiences to build America's reputation abroad".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bureau of International Information Programs|url=https://www.state.gov/r/iip/index.htm|publisher=U.S. Department of State}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physical and virtual places include over 700 American Spaces around the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Spaces|url=https://www.state.gov/r/iip/amerspaces/|publisher=U.S. Department of State}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a large social media community that numbers over 12 million followers.  Content includes publications, video, and U.S. expert speakers, who engage foreign audiences both in person and through virtual programs.  IIP manages the infrastructure for all embassy and consulate websites, translations of public remarks by the President and Secretary, and maintains internal websites with resources for use by public diplomacy officers for overseas programs.

==Role and responsibility==

The Bureau of International Information Programs provides public diplomacy materials and support in three primary areas:

; Digital
IIP operates the department's embassy and consulate websites, which attract more than 150 million unique visitors per year (http://usembassy.gov) in over 60 languages.  IIP also supports embassy social media efforts with theme-based Facebook pages and Twitter sites in six languages, reaching more than 12 million fans and followers.

IIP also operates an interactive web-chat platform that links foreign audiences to U.S. subject matter experts, opinion-makers, community leaders, and government officials in more than 800 programs each year. In September 2014, the bureau launched a new social sharing platform [https://share.america.gov ShareAmerica] to distribute public diplomacy content that is interesting, policy-relevant, and visually appealing.

; American Spaces
American Spaces exemplify the United States' commitment to a core tenet of democracy: the citizen's right to free access to information.  Hosting more than 16 million visits each year, American Spaces support public diplomacy by creating a place for in-person engagement with foreign audiences.  Over 700 Spaces are hosted in embassies, schools, libraries, and other partner institutions in 169 countries.  They provide information about United States' policy, culture, and values as well as study in the United States.  They also support English language learning and activities for alumni of international visitor programs.

; Public Diplomacy (PD) Content
IIP creates and curates content that provides context and information on U.S. foreign policy topics in a variety of formats ranging from video to print publications to audio books, reaching more than one billion people a year.  Much of this content, along with transcripts of the Secretary's and President's speeches, is available to embassies in multiple languages.  IIP also produces more than 125 video products each year and recruits more than 650 speakers annually, including Supreme Court justices, renowned authors, innovators, scholars, entrepreneurs, journalists, and sports figures who connect directly with more than 160,000 people in local markets via in-country and virtual events.

; Analytics
IIP has an advanced analytics capacity to measure output, campaign performance, perform audience analysis and track over 2,000 Department of State social media properties.

'''Buyer credit''' is a short  term [[Credit (finance)|credit]] available to an [[Importer|importer (buyer)]] from overseas lenders such as [[bank]]s and other [[financial institution]] for goods they are importing. The overseas banks usually lend the importer (buyer) based on the [[letter of comfort]] (a bank guarantee) issued by the importer's bank. For this service the importer's bank or buyer's credit consultant charges a fee called an arrangement fee.

Buyer's credit helps local importers gain access to cheaper foreign funds  that may be closer to [[London Interbank Offered Rate|LIBOR]] rates as against local sources of funding which are more costly.

The duration of buyer's credit may vary from country to country, as per the local regulations. For example, in India, buyer's credit can be availed for one year in case the import is for tradeable goods and for three years if the import is for capital goods.

== Benefits to importer ==
Buyer's credit has several advantages for the importer.
The exporter gets paid on due date; whereas importer gets extended date for making an import payment as per the cash flows.
The importer can deal with exporter on sight basis, negotiate a better discount and use the buyers credit route to avail financing.
The funding currency can be depending on the choice of the customer and availability of LIBOR rates in the exchange market.  
The importer can use this financing for any form of payment mode, such as: open account, collections, or LCs.

== Steps involved  ==
# The customer requests the Buyer's Credit Arranger to arrange the credit before the due date of the bill 
# Arrange to request overseas bank branches to provide a buyer's credit offer letter in the name of the importer. Best rate of interest is quoted to the importer
# Overseas bank to fund Importer's bank [[Nostro and vostro accounts|Nostro account]] for the required amount
# Importer's bank to make import bill payment by utilizing the amount credited (if the borrowing currency is different from the currency of Imports then a cross currency contract is utilized to effect the import payment)
# Importer's bank will recover the required amount from the importer and remit the same to overseas bank on due date.
# It helps importer in working capital management.

== Cost involved ==
Interest cost is charged by overseas bank as a financing cost.

== Risk involved ==
Buyer's credit is associated with [[currency risk]].
Thus, [[Hedge (finance)|Hedging]] may be required as foreign currency is involved, making Buyer's Credit risky at times.

== Indian regulatory framework ==
Banks can provide buyer’s credit up to US$20 million (US$ 2 crore) per import transactions for a maximum maturity period of one year from date of shipment. In case of import of capital goods, banks can approve buyer’s credits up to $20 million per transaction with a maturity period of up to three years. No rollover beyond that period is permitted.

As per RBI directives dated 11.07.13, at the time of availment of trade credit, the period of trade credit should be linked to the operating cycle and trade transaction. AD banks need to  ensure that these instructions are strictly complied with.

RBI has issued directions under Sec 10(4) and Sec 11(1) of the [[Foreign Exchange Management Act]], 1999, stating that authorized dealers may approve proposals received (in Form ECB) for short-term credit for financing—by way of either suppliers' credit or buyers' credit—of import of goods into India, based on uniform criteria. Credit is to be extended for a period of less than three years; amount of credit should not exceed $20 million, per import transaction; the `all-in-cost' per annum, payable for the credit is not to exceed 6 months LIBOR + 350 basis points for credit up to one year, and LIBOR + 125 basis points for credits for periods beyond one year but less than three years, for the currency of credit.

All applications for short-term credit exceeding $20 million for any import transaction are to be forwarded to the Chief General Manager, Exchange Control Department, [[Reserve Bank of India]], Central Office, External Commercial Borrowing (ECB) Division, Mumbai. Each credit has to be given `a unique identification number' by authorised dealers and the number so allotted should be quoted in all references. The International Banking Division of the authorised dealer is required to furnish the details of approvals granted by all its branches, during the month, in Form ECB-ST to the RBI, so as to reach not later than 5th of the following month. (Circular AP (DIR Series) No 24 dated September 27, 2002.

As per RBI Master circular on External Commercial Borrowing and Trade Finance 1 July 2011, the all-in cost ceiling for interest is now six month L + 200 {{Not a typo|bps}}(bps is Basis Points  . A unit that is equal to 1/100th of 1%) for buyer's credit arrange for tenure up to three years. All cost ceiling includes arranger fee, upfront fee, management fee, handling and processing charges, out-of-pocket and legal expenses, if any.

The above ceiling got revised on 15/11/2011 to 6 Month Libor + 350 {{Not a typo|bps}} and got further extended on 30/03/2012 till 30/09/2012. From 01-10-2012 Maximum cap of 6 Month Libor + 350 bsp has been extended till further review.

It is now the largest in the region. The Institute operates its own [[coffin]] production.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

About fifty-based organizations with a total of 20,000 members (employees and users) are connected to the network. 1,200 Cooperative fashionistas work as "full-time" (trabajadores asociados) at CECOSESOLA. They get their livelihood directly from the total composite.&lt;ref&gt;"CECOSESOLA - On the Way", published by Die Buchmacherei, Berlin 2012 - Preface pp. 10/11&lt;/ref&gt; They pay a weekly amount which is mentioned in the definition of [[wage labor]] "advance" (anticipo). The height is about twice the [[government]]-set [[minimum wage]]. This advance is based on people's requirements, so it is not the same for everyone. Those with children, for example, get more. In 2010, the turnover of the company amounted to 430 million Bolivares - around 100 million U.S. dollars.

===Projects===

* [[Barquisimeto]]: The organization operates three weekly markets, where every week 55,000 families – about a quarter of the [[urban area|urban]] population – provide them with [[fruits]], [[vegetables]] and [[foods]]. 450 tonnes of fruit and vegetables are sold weekly. The prices are on average 30 percent lower than those of privately operated markets. In addition, there is a shop for home appliances and furniture, where members can buy the products with installment payments without the usual high [[interest rates]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

In the six projects of 190,000 [[health care]] treatments are performed per year. In 2009, the newly built health center was inaugurated in CICS. Here, alternative treatments such as [[acupuncture]] and [[massages]] are offered, but also [[surgical procedures]] and [[laboratory]] and [[X-ray]] examinations. The prices are 60 percent below those of private [[hospitals]]. For members of the cooperatives certain treatments are free.

The cooperative also includes farms: Twelve organizations in the states of Lara and Trujillo with over 200 small farms (2-3 hectares) supply the markets. In some, companies will try to replace [[agrochemicals]] with [[biological crop protection]]. Small production cooperatives produce foods that are sold in the markets - [[bread]], whole grain [[pasta]], cereals, [[tomato]] sauce, herbs, spices, [[honey]], fruit pulp etc. There is also a [[credit union]] and other financing and a Solidarity Fund.

==How does CECOSESOLA work?==

There is a high turnout of customers whose needs are not always discussed with them outside. Some of the customers are also involved in the cooperatives.

Inside the most striking feature is the absence of [[hierarchical]] positions. "All members can always get involved at all levels with the same rights. [[Consensus decision-making|Decisions in consensus]] and met again for discussion, if someone declares his non-acceptance in hindsight, was independent of whether the person involved in the decision or absent. In 2011, there were about 3,000 of the weekly meetings in individual and cooperative projects instead, and 300 cross-meetings."&lt;ref&gt;"CECOSESOLA - On the Way", published by Die Buchmacherei, Berlin 2012 - Preface p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no governing body, no managing director and no supervision. You trying to make sure that the meetings are not a substitute for, the management or the manager. Each person or group to take responsibility for decisions that must be made in everyday life. consensus means for the members otherwise than unanimity. For the unanimity all members of a group or organization must be present. This corresponds to a vote in which all are in favor. A consensus decision is when they 'corresponds to, We, that is the criteria that you share in this moment -. Whether this decision was made by a person, a group or an informal gathering this kind, to make decisions, can obviously lead to chaos and missteps that may attract large economic losses. But all economic losses are by far compensated by the flexibility and dynamism that results in the organization, in that we free ourselves from the cultural [[shackles]] that restrict all our capacities and creative potential."&lt;ref&gt;"CECOSESOLA - On the Way", published by Die Buchmacherei, Berlin 2012, S.127/128, translation of a brochure of CECOSESOLA from 2009: "Hacia un colectivo de cerebro reuniones ... a espacios de encuentro?"&lt;/ref&gt;

CECOSESOLA trying to take the place of [[power (social and political)|power]] and enforcement of personal interests in an opposite process. Dismantle hierarchies, making information accessible to all, build trust relationships and to establish its own identity on the collective power of [[solidarity]].  The experience of CECOSESOLA can explain different concepts:

:The productive force "cooperation" leads to increased efficiency.
:The way of cooperation and cohesion increased motivation of employees.
:The construction of network structures based on trust and cooperation supports the long-term survival of cooperatives.

Here, the forms that people interact with each other like here in relationship, beyond the sphere of work and production. Perhaps it is here rather a different way of life that needs no justification for efficiency criteria. "When we succeed, the self-organization of living with respect for others and the Other, we will do by and by this momentum to our own, and our behavior will be consistent with the process of life. This opens us the possibility to go beyond the dutiful ecological behavior that will get only from a utilitarian nature, which is at the service of man. We have the opportunity to be ecologically from scratch, since the nature then some of us will not be Separated: We are all natural Maybe we are just before opting for a form of life.. A choice that requires us to overcome the hierarchical relationship of power over the others that are part of our cultural heritage. An election in which it is clear that the takeover may be no alternative but to change the world ..... "&lt;ref&gt;"CECOSESOLA - On the Way", published by Die Buchmacherei, Berlin, 2012, p 104, translation from a brochure of CECOSESOLA from 2007: "Construyendo aqui y ahora que el mundo queremos"&lt;/ref&gt;

In one sense, it may be rightful steps to protect oneself properly while in a difficult situation, such as what steps to take to protect oneself after being fired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Korin |last=Miller |date=February 1, 2012 |work=[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]] |url= http://www.cosmopolitan.com/career/advice/a3784/what-to-do-after-getting-laid-off-013112/ |title=Do This Immediately After Getting Laid Off |access-date=August 26, 2014 |quote=If you're handed a pink slip, ... make these moves to cover your butt ....}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, in a different sense, according to ''[[The New York Times]]''{{'}} language expert [[William Safire]], it describes "the bureaucratic technique of averting future accusations of policy error or wrongdoing by deflecting responsibility in advance".&lt;ref name=twsSafire/&gt; It often involves diffusing responsibility for one's actions as a form of insurance against possible future negative repercussions.&lt;ref name=twsSafire/&gt; It can denote a type of institutional risk-averse mentality which works against accountability and responsibility, often characterized by excessive paperwork and documentation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Caitlin |last=Flanagan |date=November 1, 2007 |work=[[The Atlantic]] |url= https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2007/11/no-girlfriend-of-mine/306329/2/ |title=No Girlfriend of Mine |access-date=August 26, 2014 |quote=...cover-your-ass devotion to documentation and paperwork ....}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can be harmful to the institution's overall effectiveness.&lt;ref name=twsAtlantic/&gt; The activity, sometimes seen as instinctive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Megan |last=McArdle |date=April 10, 2009 |work=The Atlantic |url= https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2009/04/the-heroes-of-financial-fraud/12989/ |title=The Heroes of Financial Fraud |access-date=August 26, 2014 |quote=The instinct to CYA is a normal human emotion ....}}&lt;/ref&gt; is generally unnecessary towards accomplishing the goals of the organization, but helpful to protect a particular individual's career within it, and it can be seen as a type of institutional corruption working against individual initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Culture of Corruption: Changing an Australian Police Service |editor-first=David |editor-last=Dixon |publisher=Hawkins Press |date=1999 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=MPihGaHK8jwC&amp;pg=PA110&amp;lpg=PA110&amp;dq=(%22cover+your+ass%22)+OR+%22cover+your+butt%22+OR+%22cover+your+rear+end%22)+corruption&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=c_E2qdi9tF&amp;sig=80SH7v54r3UuJ_cuThfGKlwsr40&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hPD8U-XFPIOgyASdwYGoAg&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=(%22cover%20your%20ass%22)%20OR%20%22cover%20your%20butt%22%20OR%20%22cover%20your%20rear%20end%22)%20corruption&amp;f=false |via=Google Books |chapter=A Culture of Corruption |access-date=August 26, 2014 |quote=This 'cover your ass' perspective pervades all of patrol work ... bureaucratic paranoia ... not take the initiative on the street ....}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
The phrase ''cover your ass'' is generally viewed as a [[Vulgarity|vulgar]] term, often replaced by the less-vulgar sounding initials ''CYA''&lt;ref name=twsSafire/&gt; Safire identified ''CYA'' as a [[synecdoche]], in the same sense that the word "ass" had come to reference the whole person.&lt;ref name=twsSafire&gt;{{cite news |first=William |last=Safire |author-link=William Safire |date=August 18, 1987 |work=The New York Times |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/16/magazine/on-language-glossary-of-a-scandal.html |title=On Language: Glossary of a Scandal |access-date=August 26, 2014 |pages=163–164 |quote=[A] new sense has evolved that uses the word for the posterior as a synecdoche for the whole person ... the initials today are an anachronism ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "ass" in the phrase is often replaced with more polite versions or other [[euphemism]]s, such as "cover your actions", "cover your rear end", or "cover your butt", according to Safire.&lt;ref name=twsSafire2&gt;{{cite news |first=William |last=Safire |date=October 30, 1994 |work=The New York Times |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/30/magazine/on-language-on-the-edge.html |title=On Language: On the Edge |access-date=August 26, 2014 |quote=... the choice of 'cover your rear end' to define C.Y.A. by Senators ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "cover your butt" variant has been used in various ways, such as by Minnesota health authorities urging citizens to undergo preventive [[Colonoscopy|colorectal exams]], as a way to "cover" themselves medically from possible future cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Carol |last=Kuruvilla |work=New York Daily News |date=March 22, 2013 |url= http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/minnesota-takes-aim-colon-cancer-cheeky-new-ad-campaign-article-1.1296786 |title=Minnesota takes aim at colon cancer with cheeky new ad campaign: March is National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month. Commuters in the Twin Cities metro area are getting daily reminders of why they need to get tested}}&lt;/ref&gt; In banking, officers tasked with making sure the bank follows proper regulatory procedures, called [[Chief compliance officer|compliance officer]]s, may realize that certain dubious transactions, such as [[money laundering]] and [[terrorist financing]], will occur regardless of any regulatory restrictions;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[The Economist]] |url= http://economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=5053373 |title=Financing terrorism: Looking in the wrong places |date=October 20, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; still, to protect themselves and their banks against possible future sanctions, they may engage in CYA activity such as issuing unnecessary memos, obfuscating documents or conducting transactions discreetly, as ways to absolve themselves from possible future liability. The term is widely used in [[journalism]]. Safire explained how the term is used in [[bureaucracy]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William |last=Safire |title=Safire's Political Dictionary |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2008 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=c4UoX6-Sv1AC&amp;pg=PA164&amp;lpg=PA164&amp;dq=%22CYA%22+%22william+safire%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=V2wn_vtyFq&amp;sig=4jJUXANwOshQQfUMqkVRS4UJ1Vg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-3f8U8qkFtO4ogThw4HYCQ&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22CYA%22%20%22william%20safire%22&amp;f=false |chapter=C.Y.A. |access-date=August 26, 2014 |page=164 |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|A bureaucrat adept at ''C.Y.A.'' (a) likes to employ passive constructions (see ''[[mistakes were made]]''), (b) follows up a meeting or phone call with a self-serving ''memcon''—"[[memorandum of conversation]]", (c) routes memos to and through as many other bureaucrats as possible, thereby spreading the risk of future criticism, and (d) "papers the file" with memoranda sometimes supporting and sometimes contradicting his or her position.}}

Because these practices are so routine, a genuine warning can be mistaken for CYA behavior, causing a [[Type I and type II errors#Type II error|type II error]] or [[False positives and false negatives#False negative error|false-negative error]], with disastrous results. For example, in the summer preceding the [[September 11 attacks|attacks of 9/11]], U.S. president [[George W. Bush]] was briefed on a now-famous August 6, 2001, memo titled ''[[Bin Ladin Determined To Strike in US]]''. Bush's response to the briefer was reportedly: "All right. You've covered your ass, now."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Barton |last=Gellman |date=June 20, 2006 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/19/AR2006061901211.html |title=The Shadow War, In a Surprising New Light |access-date=November 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another example, before the launch of the United States spaceship Challenger which ended tragically with the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster]], the final launch approval by rocket maker [[Morton Thiokol]] contained the phrase "information on this page was prepared to support an oral presentation and cannot be considered complete without the oral discussion"; this notice was later described as a "CYA notice" by information design specialist [[Edward Tufte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Edward R. |last=Tufte |author-link=Edward R. Tufte |title=Visual Explanations |publisher=Graphics Press |date=1997 |pages=26–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; In print, it can have the form of a [[disclaimer]]; for example, ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine suggested that the [[Executive Office of the President of the United States|White House]] used the phrase "It is important not to read too much into any one monthly report" as a disclaimer on reports, and this was described as a CYA activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=David |last=Weigel |date=September 6, 2012 |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |url= http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2012/07/06/the_white_house_uses_the_exact_same_cya_sentence_in_every_jobs_report.html |title=The White House Uses the Exact Same CYA Sentence in Every Jobs Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has been applied in the medical profession to describe doctors who prescribe unnecessary medical tests for patients, to protect themselves against possible future lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Megan |last=McArdle |date=February 8, 2010 |work=The Atlantic |url= https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2010/02/the-reality-of-health-care-plans/35533/ |title=The Reality of Health Care Plans |access-date=August 26, 2014 |quote=... we could eliminate a hell of a lot of unnecessary day to day expenses ... visits of convenience and CYA tests for diseases there's no indication the patient has ....}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has been used to describe a cultural tendency which works against accountability and risk-taking, such as in a war effort when generals engage in much ''cover your ass'' activity which avoids taking real responsibility.&lt;ref name=twsAtlantic&gt;{{cite news |first=Thomas E. |last=Ricks |date=October 24, 2012 |work=The Atlantic |url= https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/11/general-failure/309148/ |title=General Failure |access-date=August 26, 2014 |quote=... appropriate risk-taking diminished (the art of combat pursuit was almost lost in Vietnam), and a 'cover your ass' mentality took hold ....}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dale Begg-Smith''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|OAM}} (born 18 January 1985) is an Australian-Canadian businessman and former Olympic [[Freestyle skiing|freestyle skier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dale Begg-Smith – The Olympic hero of Australia |url=http://www.olympics30.com/30greatest/dale-begg-smith-iceman-skiing.asp |publisher=Olympic30 |accessdate=23 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Begg-Smith won the [[gold medal]] for Australia in the men's [[Mogul (skiing)|moguls]] event at the [[2006 Winter Olympics]] and silver at the [[2010 Winter Olympics]].

==Early years==
Begg-Smith formed an internet company when he was 13 years old.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The 4-hour work week|last=Ferriss|first=Tim|publisher=Vermilion (London)|year=2011|isbn=9781407023007|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was skiing for his native Canada as a teenager when his coaches told him he was spending too much time on his successful business and not enough time in training.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

So Begg-Smith quit the Canadian ski program and, along with his brother [[Jason Begg-Smith]], moved to Australia at age 16 to live with his cousin Nicole.&lt;ref name="Baum20060217"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/sport/golden-boy-of-the-slopes/2006/02/16/1140064207497.html|title=Golden boy of the slopes|last=Baum|first=Greg|date=17 February 2006|work=[[The Age]]|accessdate=15 July 2009|location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brothers chose to [[Skiing in Australia|ski for Australia]] because the country had a smaller ski program that offered them more attention and flexibility to successfully manage their business.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The brothers stayed out of competitive skiing for three years and instead trained with the Australian team, living in [[Jindabyne, New South Wales]] each winter. The pair qualified for Australian citizenship, in 2003–04, after three years and were then free to compete for their adopted country.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Career ==
Begg-Smith is one of only five Australians to win a gold medal in a Winter Games and the youngest to win an Olympic Gold in the history of men's freestyle mogul skiing.&lt;ref name="Baum20060217" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ready for the conversion; Bloom sixth as thoughts turn to NFL; Dawson third|last=Hine|first=Tommy|date=16 February 2006|work=[[Hartford Courant]]|location=Hartford, Conn.|page=C.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the lead-up to the 2006 Winter Games, Dale Begg-Smith  won three World Cup rounds and was ranked world number one in the moguls' discipline.&lt;ref name="SMH20060124"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/sport/dale-begs-the-question-can-australia-win-a-mogul-medal-in-turin/2006/01/23/1137864864166.html|title=Dale begs the question: can Australia win a mogul medal in Turin?|date=24 January 2006|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=15 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Begg-Smith holds the record for qualifying for the most consecutive World Cup finals in events he entered. In March 2010, he reached his 48th consecutive final.

"Judged sports can't be perfect. It can be a bad part of my sport. I see it. But everybody is going to be equal in the end." &lt;ref name="torontosun" /&gt;

Begg-Smith represented Australia at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/sport/winter-olympics/dale-beggsmith-runner-evades-media-at-sochi-airport-20140204-31y4z.html|title=Australian Olympic team management apologise for Dale Begg-Smith runner|work=The Age|location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; reaching the 2nd qualifying round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/be/dale-begg-smith-1.html|title=Dale Begg-Smith|website=sports-reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal ==
Begg-Smith is considered a recluse by many, and has repeatedly refused to communicate with non-Australian media, Canadian media in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Jeffery|first=Nicole|title=Dale Begg-Smith's bumpy road to glory|newspaper=The Australian|location=|pages=|publisher=News Limited|date=13 February 2010|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/sport/dale-begg-smiths-bumpy-road-to-glory/story-fn4vwn8v-1225829865281|accessdate=15 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NBC]] dubbed him "the most mysterious man of the Winter Olympics" in a piece aired on 14 February 2010, during the Vancouver games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.NBC.com/olympics |title=2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver on NBC(com) – Updated May 18, 2011 5:29 PM |publisher=Nbc.com |date=2011-05-18 |accessdate=2011-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alisa Monk, coordinator of the moguls program, said that she booked Begg-Smith's hotels and flights economically, despite his wealth. "Wherever the team stays, he stays. There are certainly no big demands. You wouldn't know he had a bit of money." She also said, "When he is at [[Perisher Blue|Perisher]] he stays in the same hut as the other mogul skiers and his brother which is small and old and almost falling down.... He just doesn't try to stand out at all."&lt;ref name="MXMousewhoRoared"&gt;MX: "The Mouse who Roared" (Quiet Achiever infobox). 16 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], Begg-Smith donated his prize money – about $13,670 – to earthquake relief efforts in Haiti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/dale-begg-smiths-media-snow-job/story-e6frf9if-1225828898923|title= Dale Begg-Smith's media snow job|date=18 February 2010|publisher=[[Herald Sun]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business controversy==
There are claims that Begg-Smith's internet advertising business, '''Ads CPM''' later called '''CPM Media''', had been linked to the distribution of [[malware]].&lt;ref name="ZDNet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/Spyware/?p=786 |title=Australian press on Dale Begg-Smith and spyware |accessdate=20 January 2010 |date=4 March 2006 |publisher=[[ZDNet]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217033150/http://blogs.zdnet.com/Spyware/?p=786 |archivedate=17 February 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNET"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-10454774-38.html|title=The Olympic skier known as 'spam king'|accessdate=23 February 2010|date=17 February 2010|publisher=[[CNET Networks]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[The Sydney Morning Herald|Sydney Morning Herald]] reported that "a trail of digital fingerprints scattered over the web... shows Mr Begg-Smith's long and rewarding involvement in the distribution of "malicious software".&lt;ref name="SMH"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2006/03/03/1141191842651.html|title=Spyware cybersigns point to Begg-Smith|accessdate=20 January 2010|date=4 March 2006|publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Begg-Smith's manager, David Malina, said reports about his client's business had been "exaggerated", and that "it's not really something that he's involved with anymore ... he's minimised his involvement to concentrate on his sport."&lt;ref name="SMH"/&gt;

==Honours==
On 21 February 2006, [[Australia Post]] issued a postage stamp commemorating Begg-Smith's achievement, saying his gold put him in a "small and honoured group of athletes".&lt;ref name="AusPost"&gt;[[Australia Post]]: "Australia Post to release Dale Begg-Smith gold medallist stamp". Retrieved 27 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, he was awarded [[Ski &amp; Snowboard Australia|Ski and Snowboard Australia's]] Snowsports Athlete of the Year.&lt;ref name="AskMen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.askmen.com/celebs/men/celeb_profiles_sports/8_dale_begg_smith.html|title=Dale Begg-Smith Profile|accessdate=20 January 2010|date=20 March 2010|publisher=[[Ask Men]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dalian Hi-tech Zone''' ({{zh|s=大连高新技术产业园区}} or {{zh|s=大连高新区|labels=no}}) or '''DHZ''' is an [[industrial district]] in the western suburb of [[Dalian City]], [[Liaoning Province]], [[China]].  It spreads about 30 kilometers along [[Lushun South Road]] and Guoshui Highway in [[Shahekou District]] and [[Lushunkou District]], where the world's [[high technology]] companies and organizations are situated.

==General Information==
The construction of DHZ started in 1991.  [[Dalian Software Park]] was added in 1998.  The second phase of Dalian Software Park was kicked off in 2003 at the site of Dalian Ascendas IT Park, which officially opened in 2007.  DHZ is often called "Lushun South Road Software Industry Belt".&lt;ref&gt;[http://baike.baidu.com/view/2096747.htm Dalian Hi-tech Zone (Baidu Encyclopedia)] (in Chinese)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hudong.com/wiki/%E5%A4%A7%E8%BF%9E%E9%AB%98%E6%96%B0%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%AF%E4%BA%A7%E4%B8%9A%E5%9B%AD%E5%8C%BA Dalian Hi-tech Zone (Hudong Encyclopedia)] (in Chinese)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Daniel Legrand''' (1783 – 16 March 1859) was a Swiss industrialist and philanthropist of the [[Continental Reformed church|Reformed Church]] who spent most of his life in [[Alsace]], France. He campaigned for laws that would improve the condition of child workers, and of industrial workers in general. His ideas contributed to the later development of international labor law.

==Life==

Daniel Legrand was born at Basel on 28 November 1783.{{sfn|Monnier|1859|p=7}}
His father was [[Johann Lukas Legrand]] (or Jean-Luc Legrand, 1755–1836), president of Directory of the [[Helvetic Republic]].{{sfn|Monnier|1859|p=6}}
Daniel Legrand was given a sound, moral education based on 18th century philosophical principles.{{sfn|X.X.X,|1848|p=196}}
He spent two years at the [[Reichenau, Switzerland|Reichenau]] institute in [[Graubünden]], then studied mathematics at [[Neuchâtel]] before returning to Basel to help his father in his ribbon factory. The factory was run on paternalist lines. The workers were lodged in the factory. The owner presided with his family at meals, and he and his son directed the education of the children.{{sfn|Monnier|1859|p=7}}

After being forced out of office, his father moved to [[Alsace]], France and founded a ribbon factory.
Daniel helped with the business.{{sfn|De Felice|1859|p=509}}
In 1812 Daniel Legrand visited [[Ban de la Roche]], where he met [[Jean-Frédéric Oberlin]] (1740–1826).{{sfn|De Felice|1859|p=509}}
Oberlin has been called the "true precursor of [[social Christianity]] in France."{{sfn|Chalamet|2013|p=13}}
Legrand came under the spell of the pastor, and moved with his ribbon factory to nearby [[Fouday]], where he lived for the rest of his life. He became known for his frank piety and openness to members of different Christian sects.{{sfn|De Felice|1859|p=509}}
According to the Reverend Frederick Monod,
{{blockquote|Among men who have had the privilege of knowing him, who does not preserve a lasting remembrance of that animated face, in which were depicted an affectionate kindness, an expansive charity, a Christian peace and joy—the work of the Holy Spirit—that nothing in the world seemed able to disturb?{{sfn|De Felice|1859|p=509}} }}
Legrand thought that a Christian who owned property should give half of his income to the service of God and the poor. He provided good conditions to his workers, including housing and schools.
He did not mechanize his factory, but let his employees work at home.
He petitioned with some success for laws that would reduce the working hours of children in the factories.{{sfn|De Felice|1859|p=509}}
In Legrand's 1841 ''Lettre d'un industriel des montagnes des Vosges'' he threw down a challenge to the French leaders when he said that even England had "found that all its interests, without exception, imperiously demanded the intervention of the legislation in order to fix the age, working hours and schooling of its factory workers in order to save them from ruin and perdition."{{sfn|Lynch|1988|p=181}}
Legrande was a believer in small-scale family industry, where children worked with their parent, and hours were shorter than was common at the time. This would avoid the corrupting influence of the factory on children, would strengthen family bonds and would provide long-term social benefits.{{sfn|Lynch|1988|p=182}}

Legrand was active throughout his life in distributing copies of the Scriptures and religious tracts.{{sfn|De Felice|1859|p=509}}
Daniel Legrand died at home in [[Ban de la Roche]] on 16 March 1859.{{sfn|Monnier|1859|p=5}}

==Legacy==

Legrand's grandson was [[Tommy Fallot]], founder of "Christianisme social."{{sfn|Chalamet|2013|p=13}}
At the time of his death Legrand was trying to get support for an international law to regulate industrial occupations.{{sfn|X.X.X,|1848|p=196}}
Legrand and [[Robert Owen]] (1771–1853) of Wales, another industrialist, advocated creation of an international organization dedicated to reform of labor laws.
They wanted to reverse the steady deterioration of conditions for industrial workers and remove the causes of social unrest.
Coordination of simultaneous labor law reform at the international level would avoid the issue of early reformers losing competitive advantage.
Eventually these ideas took fruit with the establishment of the [[International Labour Organization]] after [[World War I]] (1914–18).{{sfn|Dankers|2003|p=3}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1667">The '''Danish Sale of Goods Act''' ({{lang-da|Købeloven}}; Consolidation Act number 237 of March 28, 2003) lays down various rules of [[trade]] between companies (commercial sale) and between companies and consumers ([[consumer]] sale).

==Main points==
* Overdue delivery or [[Product defect|defective]] goods are considered [[breach of contract|breaches of contract]] on the seller's part.
* Overdue payment or non-payment are considered main breaches of contract on the buyer's part.
* Seller's breach of contract may cause the customer to claim [[damages]], rescind the [[contract of sale]] or demand goods delivered to replace the defective ones.
* The rules of commercial sale are the most restrictive ones. 
* Any delay usually makes it possible for the customer to rescind the contract of sale or claim damages (if the goods have to be purchased elsewhere at a higher price). 
* Defective goods of any kind must immediately be reported to the seller. 
* The Sale of Goods Act's provisions on defective goods and overdue delivery can be departed from through terms of sale and delivery. However, most trades have set forth individual customs impeding full disclaimer of any provisions. Otherwise, they will never see any customers.&lt;ref&gt;''Terms of Sale and Delivery'' 100svar.dk "Site for new business owners in Denmark" [http://www.100svar.dk/laering_frame.asp?id=48&amp;sprog=UK]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8471">{{About|deferred tax as an accounting concept|deferral of tax liabilities in cash-flow terms|tax deferral}}

{{accounting}}

A notional asset or liability to reflect corporate income taxation on a basis that is the same or more similar to recognition of profits than the taxation treatment.  '''Deferred tax''' liabilities can arise as a result of corporate taxation treatment of capital expenditure being more rapid than the accounting depreciation treatment. Deferred tax assets can arise due to net loss carry-overs, which are only recorded as asset if it is deemed more likely than not that the asset will be used in future fiscal periods. Different countries may also allow or require discounting of the assets or particularly liabilities. There are often disclosure requirements for potential liabilities and assets that are not actually recognised as an asset or liability.

== Permanent and Temporary differences==
If an item in the profit and loss account is never chargeable or allowable for tax or is chargeable or allowable for tax purposes but never appears in the profit and loss account then this is a permanent difference. A permanent difference does not give rise to deferred tax.

If items are chargeable or allowable for tax purposes but in different periods to when the income or expense is recognised then this gives rise to temporary differences. Temporary difference do give rise to potential deferred tax, but the rules on whether the deferred asset or liability is actually recognised can vary.

Temporary differences are usually calculated on the differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability recognized in the statements of financial position and the amount attributed to that asset or liability for tax at the beginning and end of the year. The differences in the charges to the profit and loss account compared to the amounts taxable or allowable can also be calculated and should reconcile the change in position at the beginning and end of the year.&lt;ref name="IAS 12.5"&gt;IAS 12.5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Example===
The basic principle of accounting for deferred tax under a temporary difference approach can be illustrated using a common example in which a company has fixed assets that qualify for tax depreciation.

The following example assumes that a company purchases an asset for $1,000 which is depreciated for accounting purposes on a straight-line basis of five years of $200/year. The company claims tax depreciation of 25% per year on a reducing balance basis. The applicable rate of [[corporate income tax]] is assumed to be 35%, and the net value is subtracted.

{|

| $(116)
|-
! Deferred tax liability/(asset) at 35%
| $0
| $18
| $13
| $(8)
| $(41)
|}

As the tax value, or [[tax base]], is lower than the accounting value, or [[book value]], in years 1 and 2, the company should recognize a deferred tax liability. This also reflects that the company has claimed tax depreciation in excess of the expense for accounting depreciation recorded in its accounts, whereas in the future the company should claim less tax depreciation in total than accounting depreciation in its accounts.

In years 3 and 4, the tax value exceeds the accounting value, therefore the company should recognise a deferred tax asset (subject to it having sufficient forecast profits so that it is able to use future tax deductions). This reflects that the company expects to be able to claim tax depreciation in excess of accounting depreciation.

== Timing differences ==

In many cases the deferred tax outcome will be similar for a temporary difference or timing difference approach. However, differences can arise such as in relation to [[revaluation]] of [[fixed assets]] qualifying for [[tax base|tax depreciation]], which gives rise to a deferred tax asset under a balance sheet approach, but in general should have no impact under a timing difference approach.

== Justification for deferred tax accounting==

Deferred tax is relevant to the matching principle.

== Examples ==

=== Deferred tax liabilities ===

Deferred tax liabilities generally arise where tax relief is provided in advance of an accounting expense/unpaid liabilities, or income is [[accrue]]d but not taxed until  received

=== Deferred tax assets ===

Deferred tax assets generally arise where tax relief is provided after an expense is deducted for accounting purposes:

* a company may [[accrue]] an accounting expense in relation to a [[provision (accounting)|provision]] such as bad debts, but tax relief may not be obtained until the provision is utilized
* a company may incur tax losses and be able to "carry forward" losses to reduce taxable income in future years..

An asset on a company's balance sheet that may be used to reduce any subsequent period's income tax expense. Deferred tax assets can arise due to net loss carryover.

== Deferred tax in modern accounting standards ==

Modern accounting standards typically require that a company provides for deferred tax in accordance with either the [[#temporary differences|temporary difference]] or [[#Timing differences|timing difference]] approach. Where a deferred tax liability or asset is recognised, the liability or asset should reduce over time (subject to new differences arising) as the temporary or timing difference reverses.

Under [[International Financial Reporting Standards]], deferred tax should be accounted for using the principles in [[IAS 12]]: Income Taxes, which is similar (but not identical) to [[SFAS 109]] under [[US GAAP]]. Both these accounting standards require a [[#temporary differences|temporary difference]] approach.

Other accounting standards which deal with deferred tax include:

* '''[[UK GAAP]]''' - [[Financial Reporting Standard 19: Deferred Tax]] ([[#Timing differences|timing difference approach]])
* '''Mexican GAAP or PCGA''' - Boletín D-4, el impuesto sobre la renta diferido
* '''[[Canadian GAAP]]''' - [[Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants|CICA]] Section 3465
* '''[[Russia]]n PBU 18 (2002)''' ''Accounting for profit tax'' ([[#Timing differences|timing difference approach]])
*'''[[INDIAN AS]]'''-[[Institute Of Charted Account of India -AS 22 Accounting for taxes on income]]

== Derecognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities ==
Management has an obligation to accurately report the true state of the company, and to make judgements and estimations where necessary. In the context of tax assets and liabilities, there must be a reasonable likelihood that the tax difference may be realised in future years.

For example, a tax asset may appear on the company's accounts due to losses in previous years (if carry-forward of tax losses is allowed). In this case a deferred tax asset should be recognised if and only if the management considered that there will be sufficient future taxable profit to use the tax loss.&lt;ref&gt;IAS 12.34&lt;/ref&gt; If it becomes clear that the company does not expect to make profits in future years, the value of the tax asset has been ''impaired'': in the estimation of management, the likelihood that this [[tax loss]] can be used in the future has significantly fallen.

In cases where the carrying value of tax assets or liabilities has changed, the company may need to do a [[write down]], and in certain cases involving in particular a fundamental error, a restatement of its financial results from previous years. Such write-downs may involve either significant income or expenditure being recorded in the company's profit and loss for the financial year in which the write-down takes place.

==Gameplay==
''Donald Trump's Real Estate Tycoon'' is a single-player video game. The player's goal is to beat [[Donald Trump]] by becoming the most influential [[business magnate]].&lt;ref name=AG/&gt; In the Windows version, the player must choose the best real estate location in one of five cities: [[Los Angeles]], [[New York City]], [[Atlantic City]], [[London]] and [[Paris]].&lt;ref name=AG/&gt; The mobile version consists of only one city.&lt;ref name=GS/&gt; Each city is viewed from an [[Isometric graphics in video games and pixel art|isometric]] perspective.&lt;ref name=IGNAug&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/08/28/donald-trumps-real-estate-tycoon|title=Donald Trump's Real Estate Tycoon|date=August 27, 2004|work=IGN|access-date=June 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the five cities contain an office, which opens at 6:00 AM and closes at 10:00 PM. Because of this, the player will sometimes have to focus on other cities or wait.

The game features four different types of real estate: commercial, hotel, office, and residential.&lt;ref name=Sep7/&gt; Each type of real estate comes in three different building sizes: small, medium, and large.&lt;ref name=Sep7&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/donald-trumps-real-estate-tycoon-hands-on/1100-6106361/|title=Donald Trump's Real Estate Tycoon Hands-On|last=Palley|first=Stephen|date=September 7, 2004|work=GameSpot|access-date=June 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump checks on the player's progress every six months in the game. If Trump is impressed with the player's progress, he will promote the player up an additional floor in his headquarters.&lt;ref name=Sep7/&gt; The player's goal is to reach Trump on the top floor.&lt;ref name=Sep7/&gt; Trump also offers advice and hints to the player throughout the game.&lt;ref name=IGNAug/&gt;

A player may choose and purchase a piece of real estate. The price varies on its size or how long the game progresses. After the land is purchased, a building can be constructed on it.

Before construction, the style, quality, number of floors (up to 12) and building duration are to be selected. The better the quality of the building and the slower the construction time, the higher the cost. Each floor of the building can be made into three types of rooms: shops, offices or condos.&lt;ref name=Nov7/&gt; Shops are the most expensive to build but can be marketed at a higher price. Offices generate rather small profits but are cheaper to construct.

Once a building is complete, the player can market the rooms in one of two ways: selling or leasing. Through selling, a complete payment is achieved instantly. In leasing, payments are received on a monthly basis.

When short on budget, the player can borrow money from any of four banks. Loans are paid back automatically after an assigned number of months (the money the player has in hand will have some deduction for this matter). Therefore, sufficient amounts of profit have to be earned after borrowing.

A building's quality deteriorates over time.&lt;ref name=Sep7/&gt; When reusing them for commercial purpose, it is best to have them renovated. Through renovation, certain rooms can be changed into others. A change in the building's style and number of floors can only be achieved through demolition and reconstruction.

===Challenging Trump===
If the five city levels are passed, the player then faces a business competition with Trump.&lt;ref name=AG/&gt; The object of the challenge is to go into business against Trump for a fixed number of years and then come out with higher profit, with the ultimate goal of driving him into bankruptcy. Unlike the previous missions, natural disasters and criminal activity occur which cause damage to property.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The mobile version also allows the player to overtake Trump in the business industry.&lt;ref name=Donaldgame/&gt;

==Reception==
Avery Score of [[GameSpot]] gave the N-Gage QD version a 7.2 out of 10. Score called the game's auction sequences "incredibly boring," and wrote that despite the game's "unique branding, it is – at heart – a typical tycoon game that doesn't depart in any way from the conventions of the genre. While the game could have benefited from more-varied gameplay and smarter rival artificial intelligence, ''Real Estate Tycoon''{{'}}s strong presentation makes it an offering worthy of notice by fans of business simulations." Score praised the game's graphics, and wrote that while the game does not feature "much of an audio component, what's there is decent. No background music accompanies the gameplay, sadly, but your biannual reviews by Mr. Trump feature a vocal clip from the man himself." Score concluded that while the game "doesn't have any major flaws, it does fail to provide a varied experience. [...] After you're promoted 99 times, the game is over, but it's likely most gamers will tire of the game before they reach this level, as there's only one city in the game, and only so much you can do there. Doing nothing but buying low and selling high can hold one's interest for only so long."&lt;ref name=GS/&gt;

'''Downtown Newark''', officially known as the Central Business District, is an [[Local government in New Jersey#Unincorporated communities|unincorporated community]] and neighborhood within the city of [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] in [[Essex County, New Jersey|Essex County]], [[New Jersey]], United States. Downtown Newark is Newark's central business, retail, and cultural district and the largest such district in [[New Jersey]].  It is located at a bend in the [[Passaic River]].

Downtown is the site of the original [[Puritan]] settlement of Newark.  The first settlers, led by [[Robert Treat]], landed not far from the present site of the [[New Jersey Performing Arts Center]]. The intersection of Broad and Market Streets, known as [[Four Corners (Newark)|Four Corners]] was once considered the busiest intersection in the nation, and is the heart of traditional downtown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/23/nyregion/our-towns-at-crossroads-space-for-rent-on-4-corners.html?scp=1&amp;sq=Frieman's%20Insurance%20Company%20Building%20Newark%201910&amp;st=cse | work=The New York Times | title=Our Towns;At Crossroads, Space for Rent On 4 Corners | first=Evelyn | last=Nieves | date=June 23, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:MilitaryPark.JPG|left|thumb|[[Military Park (Newark)|Military Park]] in Downtown Newark]]
Most of Newark's office buildings are located in this area.  In the post-World War II era, downtown seemed to be moving north during the ''New Newark'' architectural period, in the direction of Washington Park.  Since the 1967 riots, it has been shifting slightly east in the direction of [[Newark Penn Station]], the [[Gateway Center (Newark)|Gateway Center]] and the [[Passaic River]].

Downtown Newark is the home to Newark's major cultural venues - the New Jersey Performing Arts Center (NJPAC), the 3,000-seat [[Newark Symphony Hall]], [[Prudential Center]], the [[Newark Museum]], [[Military Park (Newark)|Military Park]], and the [[New Jersey Historical Society]].  Downtown is also home to [[Seton Hall University School of Law]] and Aljira, an emerging artist's gallery.  It is also home to [[Government Center, Newark, New Jersey|Government Center]], an area of municipal and federal government offices and [http://www.newarkhappening.com/ Newark Convention and Visitors Bureau], where visitors can find out all things happening right here in the city of Newark.  It was once home to a [[Chinatown, Newark|Chinatown]] neighborhood  centered on Mulberry Arcade, which was off of Mulberry Street, near Lafayette and Green Streets.  Many of downtown's cultural and historical sites are linked by the unmarked [[Lenape Trail]], which also leads to [[Branch Brook Park]], the [[Watchung Mountains]] and the [[Glacial Lake Passaic|Passaic Meadows]] on this yellow-blazed trail.

The $375 million Prudential Center, home to the [[New Jersey Devils]], opened on October 25, 2007, with the first of ten concerts by [[Bon Jovi]]. At the time, the arena was the [[New York metropolitan area]]'s first all-new professional sports venue in over two decades.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Andrew. [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/25/nyregion/25arena.html "Downtown Newark Is Getting Set for a Large, Shiny New Resident"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 25, 2007. Accessed January 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though it has a number of buildings of great architectural significance, downtown Newark has very few housing units and its storefronts are typically not well maintained.  The buildings range from four to 35 stories tall presenting indiscriminate architecture.  Many storefronts have enormous awnings.

[[Image:Halsey st.jpg|thumb|left|Halsey Street near University Heights is lined with galleries and restaurants]]
[[Image:Broad Street Looking South.jpg|thumb|100px|left|Looking south along Broad Street]]
Much of the city's retail and commercial developments are  centered on Broad Street (the city's widest north/south boulevard, which once carried [[streetcar]]s headed for [[Elizabeth, New Jersey|Elizabeth]] and points south) and Market Street. The intersection of the two streets, known as '''Four Corners''' is widely considered to be one of the busiest in the state and at one time was considered the busiest in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E02E2DA1539F930A15755C0A960958260 | work=The New York Times | title=Our Towns;At Crossroads, Space for Rent On 4 Corners | first=Evelyn | last=Nieves | date=June 23, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Broad Street and Market Street are a bustle of activity crowded with numerous shops. Broad Street has many street vendors as well. At night however the streets are vacant and shops are closed.  The City of Newark is committed to turning downtown into a "24-hour city," and the downtown area is slowly beginning to develop a 24-hour presence.  The former Hahne's and Lefcourt buildings are going to be converted into condominiums beginning in 2005.{{Update after|2013|6|30}} [[Rutgers–Newark]] has built a six hundred bed dorm on Central Avenue.  An old office building on Clinton Street has already successfully been converted to luxury lofts.  Additionally, 1180 Raymond across from Military Park - Newark's second tallest building - completed a $150 million conversion to luxury apartments in 2006.

Aided by the presence of the [[New Jersey Performing Arts Center]], new apartments, and its proximity to the Newark's colleges and universities, including [[New Jersey Institute of Technology]] and Rutgers-Newark, downtown has seen a variety of restaurants and bars open their doors in the past several years. In addition to several high end restaurants catering to the theater crowd, downtown Newark is home to two [[Irish people|Irish]] pubs, a [[SoHo]] style bistro, a gourmet soup restaurant, and an increasing number of other establishments.

Most buses pass through Downtown and it is a principal [[shopping district]] of most Newark area residents.  [[Washington Street (NCS station)|Washington Street Station]], [[Pennsylvania Station (Newark)|Penn Station]], [[Military Park (NCS station)|Military Park Station]] and all the stops on the [[Newark Light Rail]] serve the downtown area. [[Interstate 280 (New Jersey)|Interstate 280]] lies just north of Downtown, running parallel to [[New Jersey Transit rail operations]].

The [[Newark Public Library|Main Library]] is on Washington Park and served by the [[Newark Light Rail]].

The '''eight-hour day movement''' or '''40-hour week movement''', also known as the '''short-time movement''', was a [[social movement]] to regulate the length of a [[business day|working day]], preventing excesses and abuses. It had its origins in the [[Industrial Revolution]] in Britain, where industrial production in large factories transformed working life. The use of [[child labour]] was common. The working day could range from 10 to 16 hours, and the [[workweek and weekend|work week]] was typically six days a week.&lt;ref name=mayday&gt;{{cite web |last=Chase |first=Eric|title=The Brief Origins of May Day|url=http://www.iww.org/projects/mayday/origins.shtml|publisher=Industrial Workers of the World|accessdate=30 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kentlaw&gt;{{cite web|title=The Haymarket Martyrs |url=http://www.kentlaw.edu/ilhs/haymkmon.htm |publisher=The Illinois Labor History Society |accessdate=30 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509094426/http://www.kentlaw.edu/ilhs/haymkmon.htm |archivedate=9 May 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Robert Owen]] had raised the demand for a ten-hour day in 1810, and instituted it in his socialist enterprise at [[New Lanark]]. By 1817 he had formulated the goal of the eight-hour day and coined the slogan: "Eight hours' labour, Eight hours' recreation, Eight hours' rest". Women and children in England were granted the ten-hour day in 1847. French workers won the 12-hour day after the [[February Revolution of 1848]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Karl |last=Marx |title=Capital: The process of capitalist production |year=1915 |page=328 |others=Translated by Samuel Moore, Edward Bibbins Aveling, and Ernest Untermann |publisher=C. H. Kerr}}&lt;/ref&gt; A shorter working day and improved working conditions were part of the general protests and agitation for [[Chartism|Chartist]] reforms and the early organisation of trade unions.

The [[International Workingmen's Association]] took up the demand for an eight-hour day at its [[Geneva Congress (1866)|Congress]] in [[Geneva]] in 1866, declaring "The legal limitation of the working day is a preliminary condition without which all further attempts at improvements and emancipation of the working class must prove abortive", and "The Congress proposes eight hours as the legal limit of the working day."

[[Karl Marx]] saw it as of vital importance to the workers' health, writing in ''[[Das Kapital]]'' (1867): "By extending the working day, therefore, capitalist production...not only produces a deterioration of human labour power by robbing it of its normal moral and physical conditions of development and activity, but also produces the premature exhaustion and death of this [[labour power]] itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Karl |last=Marx |title=Das Kapital |year=1867 |page=376}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/OPE/archive/0604/att-0138/01-PoliticalEconOfTheDead.pdf |first=Mark |last=Neocleous |title=The Political Economy of the Dead: Marx’s Vampires |publisher=Brunel University |accessdate=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first country to adopt eight-hour working day was [[Uruguay]]. The eight-hour day was introduced on November 17, 1915, in the government of [[José Batlle y Ordóñez]].

The first international treaty to mention it was the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in the annex of its thirteen part establishing the International Labour Office, now the [[International Labour Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;[[s: Constitution of the International Labour Office]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The eight-hour day was the first topic discussed by the [[International Labour Organization]] which resulted in the [[Hours of Work (Industry) Convention, 1919]] ratified by 52 countries as of 2016.

Although there were initial successes in achieving an eight-hour day in [[New Zealand]] and by the [[Australian labour movement]] for skilled workers in the 1840s and 1850s, most employed people had to wait to the early and mid twentieth century for the condition to be widely achieved through the industrialised world through legislative action.

The eight-hour day movement forms part of the early history for the celebration of [[Labour Day]], and [[International Workers' Day|May Day]] in many nations and cultures.

==Asia==

===Iran===
In Iran in 1918, the work of reorganizing the trade unions began in earnest in [[Tehran]] during the closure of the Iranian constitutional parliament [[Majles]]. The printers' union, established in 1906 by Mohammad Parvaneh as the first trade union, in the Koucheki print shop on Nasserieh Avenue in [[Tehran]], reorganized their union under leadership of Russian-educated Seyed Mohammad Dehgan, a newspaper editor and an avowed Communist. In 1918, the newly organised union staged a 14-day strike and succeeded in reaching a collective agreement with employers to institute the eight-hours day, overtime pay, and medical care. The success of the printers' union encouraged other trades to organize. In 1919 the bakers and textile-shop clerks formed their own trade unions.

However the eight-hours day only became as code by a limited governor's decree on 1923 by the governor of Kerman, Sistan and Balochistan, which controlled the working conditions and working hours for workers of carpet workshops in the province. In 1946 the council of ministers issued the first labor law for Iran, which recognized the eight-hour day.

===Japan===
The first company to introduce an eight-hour working day in Japan was the Kawasaki Dockyards in [[Kobe]] (now the [[Kawasaki Shipbuilding Corporation]]). An eight-hour day was one of the demands presented by the workers during pay negotiations in September 1919. After the company resisted the demands, a [[slowdown]] campaign was commenced by the workers on 18 September. After ten days of industrial action, company president [[Kōjirō Matsukata]] agreed to the eight-hour day and wage increases on 27 September, which became effective from October. The effects of the action were felt nationwide and inspired further industrial action at the Kawasaki and [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries|Mitsubishi]] shipyards in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.city.kobe.lg.jp/information/institution/institution/library/furusato/8jikan_roudou.html |title=8時間労働発祥の地神戸 |trans-title= Kobe: Birthplace of the Eight-Hour Day |language=Japanese |date=6 April 2011 |publisher=City of Kobe |access-date=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The eight-hour day did not become law in Japan until the passing of the [[Labor Standards Act of 1947|Labor Standards Act]] in April 1947. Article 32 (1) of the Act specifies a 40-hour week and paragraph (2) specifies an eight-hour day, excluding rest periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japaneselawtranslation.go.jp/law/detail_main?re=01&amp;ia=03&amp;vm=&amp;id=2236 |title=Labor Standards Act |publisher=[[Ministry of Justice (Japan)]] |date=11 December 2012 |access-date=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indonesia===
In Indonesia, the first policy regarding working time regulated in Law No. 13 of 2003 about employment. In the law, it stated that a worker should work for 7 hours a day for 6 days a week or 8 hours a day for 7 days a week, excluding rest periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dpr.go.id/dokjdih/document/uu/196.pdf|title=UNDANG-UNDANG REPUBLIK INDONESIA NOMOR 13 TAHUN 2003 TENTANG KETENAGAKERJAAN|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belgium===
The 8-hour work day was introduced in Belgium on September 9, 1924.

===Finland===
The 8-hour work day was first introduced in 1907. Within the next few decades, the 8-hour system spread gradually across technically all branches of work. A worker receives 150% payment from the first two extra hours, and 200% salary if the work day exceeds 10 hours.

===France===
The eight-hour day was enacted in France by [[Georges Clemenceau]], as a way to avoid unemployment and diminish communist support. It was succeeded by a strong French support of it during the writing of the International Labour Organization Convention of 1919.&lt;ref&gt;http://travailemploi.revues.org/4567/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
The first German company to introduce the eight-hour day was [[Degussa]]. The eight-hour day was signed into law during the [[German Revolution]] of 1918.

===Poland===
In Poland, the eight-hour day was introduced November 23, 1918 by [[decree]] of the [[Cabinet (government)|gabinet]] of the [[Prime Minister of Poland|Prime Minister]] [[Jędrzej Moraczewski]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://pl.wikisource.org/wiki/Dekret_o_8-mio_godzinnym_dniu_pracy Dekret o 8-mio godzinnym dniu pracy]&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Portugal===
In Portugal a vast wave of strikes occurred in 1919, supported by the National Workers' Union, the biggest labour union organisation at the time. The workers achieved important objectives, including the historic victory of an eight-hour day.

===Russia===
In Russia, the eight-hour day was introduced in 1917, four days after the [[October Revolution]], by a [[Soviet Decrees|Decree]] of the [[Sovnarkom|Soviet government]].

===Spain===
In the region of [[Alcoy, Spain|Alcoy]], Spain, a workers strike in 1873 for the eight-hour day followed much agitation from the anarchists. In 1919 in [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], after a 44-day general strike with over 100,000 participants had effectively crippled the Catalan economy, the Government settled the strike by granting all the striking workers demands that included an eight-hour day, union recognition, and the rehiring of fired workers.

"Now then, you fellows; I mean to fit you all to my little bed!"&lt;br /&gt;''Chorus''.

The [[Factory Act of 1833]] limited the work day for children in factories. Those aged 9–13 could work only eight hours, 14–18 12 hours. Children under 9 were required to attend school.

In 1884, [[Tom Mann]] joined the [[Social Democratic Federation]] (SDF) and published a pamphlet calling for the working day to be limited to eight hours. Mann formed an organisation, the Eight Hour League, which successfully pressured the [[Trades Union Congress]] to adopt the eight-hour day as a key goal. The British socialist economist [[Sidney Webb, 1st Baron Passfield|Sidney Webb]] and the scholar [[Harold Cox]] co-wrote a book supporting the "Eight Hours Movement" in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sidney Webb |url=http://openlibrary.org/books/OL25072899M/The_eight_hours_day |title=The eight hours day |publisher=Open Library |date= |accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==North America==

===Canada===
{{expand section|date=April 2013}}
The labour movement in Canada tracked progress in the US and UK.  In 1890, the Federation of Labour took up this issue, hoping to organise participation in May Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The New Canadian Ship Railway|url=https://archive.org/stream/hardwaremerch1890toro#page/n43/mode/1up|accessdate=18 April 2013|newspaper=Hardware|date=10 January 1890}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===
The [[Mexican Revolution]] of 1910–1920 produced the Constitution of 1917, which contained Article 123 that gave workers the right to organise labour unions and to strike. It also provided protection for women and children, the eight-hour day, and a living wage. ''See [[Mexican labour law]]''.

===United States===
{{main|United States labor law}}
In the United States, Philadelphia carpenters went on strike in 1791 for the ten-hour day. By the 1830s, this had become a general demand. In 1835, workers in Philadelphia organised the [[1835 Philadelphia general strike|first general strike in North America]], led by Irish coal heavers. Their banners read, ''From 6 to 6, ten hours work and two hours for meals.''&lt;ref&gt;Philip S. Foner, ''History of the Labor Movement in the United States, Vol. 1, From Colonial Times to the Founding of The American Federation of Labor'', International Publishers, 1975, pages 116–118&lt;/ref&gt; Labour movement publications called for an ''eight-hour day'' as early as 1836. Boston ship carpenters, although not unionised, achieved an eight-hour day in 1842.

In 1864, the eight-hour day quickly became a central demand of the Chicago labour movement. The Illinois legislature passed a law in early 1867 granting an eight-hour day but had so many loopholes that it was largely ineffective. A citywide strike that began on 1 May 1867 shut down the city's economy for a week before collapsing.

On 25 June 1868, Congress passed an eight-hour law for federal employees&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/94/400/ |title=United States v. Martin – 94 U.S. 400 (1876) :: Justia US Supreme Court Center |publisher=Supreme.justia.com |date= |accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftp.resource.org/courts.gov/c/US/336/336.US.281.91.html |title=336 U.S. 281 |publisher=Ftp.resource.org |date= |accessdate=14 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310144500/http://ftp.resource.org/courts.gov/c/US/336/336.US.281.91.html |archivedate=10 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was also of limited effectiveness.   It established an eight-hour workday for labourers and mechanics employed by the Federal Government. President Andrew Johnson had vetoed the act but it was passed over his veto. Johnson told a Workingmen's party delegation that he couldn't directly commit himself to an eight-hour day, he nevertheless told the same delegation that he greatly favoured the "shortest number of hours consistent with the interests of all." According to Richard F. Selcer, however, the intentions behind the law were "immediately frustrated" as wages were cut by 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard F. Selcer|title=Civil War America, 1850 To 1875|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dqIBqiNoB9wC&amp;pg=PA65|year=2006|publisher=Infobase Publishing|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 May 1869, President Ulysses Grant issued a National Eight Hour Law Proclamation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagohistory.org/dramas/prologue/theLinesAreDrawn/forWhatWeWill_f.htm |title=The Lines are Drawn |publisher=Chicagohistory.org |date= |accessdate=14 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141114091217/http://www.chicagohistory.org/dramas/prologue/theLinesAreDrawn/forWhatWeWill_f.htm |archivedate=14 November 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1866, the [[National Labor Union]] at [[Baltimore]] passed a resolution that said, "The first and great necessity of the present to free labour of this country from capitalist slavery, is the passing of a law by which eight hours shall be the normal working day in all States of the American Union. We are resolved to put forth all our strength until this glorious result is achieved."

During the 1870s, eight hours became a central demand, especially among labour organisers, with a network of Eight-Hour Leagues which held rallies and parades. A hundred thousand workers in New York City struck and won the eight-hour day in 1872, mostly for building trades workers. In Chicago, [[Albert Parsons]] became recording secretary of the Chicago Eight-Hour League in 1878, and was appointed a member of a national eight-hour committee in 1880.

At its convention in Chicago in 1884, the [[Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions]] resolved that "eight hours shall constitute a legal day's labour from and after May 1, 1886, and that we recommend to labour organisations throughout this jurisdiction that they so direct their laws as to conform to this resolution by the time named."

The leadership of the [[Knights of Labor]], under [[Terence V. Powderly]], rejected appeals to join the movement as a whole, but many local Knights assemblies joined the strike call including Chicago, Cincinnati and Milwaukee. On 1 May 1886, Albert Parsons, head of the Chicago Knights of Labor, with his wife [[Lucy Parsons]] and two children, led 80,000 people down Michigan Avenue, Chicago, in what is regarded as the first modern May Day Parade, with the cry, "Eight-hour day with no cut in pay."  In support of the eight-hour day. In the next few days they were joined nationwide by 350,000 workers who went on strike at 1,200 factories, including 70,000 in Chicago, 45,000 in New York, 32,000 in Cincinnati, and additional thousands in other cities. Some workers gained shorter hours (eight or nine) with no reduction in pay; others accepted pay cuts with the reduction in hours.

[[File:haymarketstation.jpg|thumb|left|Artist impression of the bomb explosion in [[Haymarket affair|Haymarket Square]]]]
On 3 May 1886, [[August Spies]], editor of the ''[[Arbeiter-Zeitung (Chicago)|Arbeiter-Zeitung]]'' (Workers Newspaper), spoke at a meeting of 6,000 workers, and afterwards many of them moved down the street to harass strikebreakers at the McCormick plant in Chicago. The police arrived, opened fire, and killed four people, wounding many more. At a subsequent rally on 4 May to protest this violence, a bomb exploded at the [[Haymarket Riot|Haymarket Square]]. Hundreds of labour activists were rounded up and the prominent labour leaders arrested, tried, convicted, and executed giving the movement its first martyrs. On 26 June 1893 Illinois Governor [[John Peter Altgeld]] set the remaining leader free, and granted full pardons to all those tried claiming they were innocent of the crime for which they had been tried and the hanged men had been the victims of "hysteria, packed juries and a biased judge".

The [[American Federation of Labor]], meeting in St Louis in December 1888, set 1 May 1890 as the day that American workers should work no more than eight hours. The International Workingmen's Association ([[Second International (politics)|Second International]]), meeting in Paris in 1889, endorsed the date for international demonstrations, thus starting the international tradition of May Day.

The [[United Mine Workers]] won an eight-hour day in 1898.

The Building Trades Council (BTC) of San Francisco, under the leadership of [[P. H. McCarthy]], won the eight-hour day in 1900 when the BTC unilaterally declared that its members would work only eight hours a day for $3 a day. When the mill resisted, the BTC began organising mill workers; the employers responded by locking out 8,000 employees throughout the Bay Area. The BTC, in return, established a union [[planing mill]] from which construction employers could obtain supplies&amp;nbsp;– or face boycotts and sympathy strikes if they did not. The mill owners went to arbitration, where the union won the eight-hour day, a closed shop for all skilled workers, and an arbitration panel to resolve future disputes. In return, the union agreed to refuse to work with material produced by non-union planing mills or those that paid less than the Bay Area employers.

By 1905, the eight-hour day was widely installed in the printing trades – see [[International Typographical Union#Fight for better working conditions|International Typographical Union (section)]] – but the vast majority of Americans worked 12- to 14-hour days.

In the [[United States presidential election, 1912|1912 Presidential Election]] [[Teddy Roosevelt]]s [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]] campaign platform included the eight-hour work day.

On 5 January 1914, the [[Ford Motor Company]] took the radical step of doubling pay to $5 a day and cut shifts from nine hours to eight, moves that were not popular with rival companies, although seeing the increase in Ford's productivity, and a significant increase in profit margin (from $30&amp;nbsp;million to $60&amp;nbsp;million in two years), most soon followed suit.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times [https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/0105.html#article "&amp;#91;Ford&amp;#93; Gives $10,000,000 To 26,000 Employees"], ''The New York Times'', 5 January 1914, accessed 23 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ford Motor Company [http://corporate.ford.com/about-ford/heritage/milestones/5dollaraday/677-5-dollar-a-day "Henry Ford's $5-a-Day Revolution"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110506042412/http://corporate.ford.com/about-ford/heritage/milestones/5dollaraday/677-5-dollar-a-day |date=6 May 2011 }}, ''Ford'', 5 January 1914, accessed 23 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;HispanicPundit [http://hispanicpundit.com/2005/09/21/economic-myths-the-5-day-work-week-and-the-8-hour-day/ "Economic Myths: The 5 Day Work Week And The 8 Hour Day"], ''Hispanic Pundit'', 21 September 2005, accessed 23 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Byron Preiss Visual Publications, Inc.

In the summer of 1915, amid increased labour demand for [[World War I]], a series of strikes demanding the eight-hour day began in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]]. They were so successful that they spread throughout the [[Northeast United States|Northeast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Philip Sheldon Foner |author2= |title=History of the Labor Movement in the United States: 1915–1916, on the Eve of America's Entrance into World War I, Vol. 6 |year=1982 |publisher=International Publishers Company, Incorporated |page=196 |quote=[A] ten-hour center like Bridgeport was converted overnight into an eight-hour community, a result that ten years of agitation under normal conditions might not have accomplished. | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ixcYmW_jR8kC&amp;pg=196&amp;lpg=196&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=salnMY01dN&amp;sig=DTdgkgcvdJB4U2Ytg7OKNM5rE2Q&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=tJMzTJvIL8Oclgeht42_Cw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwBDgU#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-7178-0595-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States [[Adamson Act]] in 1916 established an eight-hour day, with additional pay for overtime, for railroad workers. This was the first federal law that regulated the hours of workers in private companies. The [[United States Supreme Court]] upheld the constitutionality of the Act in ''Wilson v. New'', {{ussc|243|332|1917}}.

The eight-hour day might have been realised for many working people in the US in 1937, when what became the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] (29 U.S. Code Chapter 8) was first proposed under the [[New Deal]]. As enacted, the act applied to industries whose combined employment represented about twenty percent of the US labour force. In those industries, it set the maximum workweek at 40 hours,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jonathan Grossman |url=http://www.dol.gov/oasam/programs/history/flsa1938.htm |title=Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938: Maximum Struggle for a Minimum Wage |date=June 1978 |accessdate=20 July 2010 |quote= |publisher=US Department of Labor |work=Monthly Labor Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; but provided that employees working beyond 40 hours a week would receive additional [[overtime]] bonus salaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/national-fair-labor-standards-act-2953.html |title=National Fair Labor Standards Act |publisher=Chron |date= |accessdate=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Puerto Rico====
In [[Puerto Rico]] in May 1899, while under US administration, General [[George W. Davis]] acceded to Island demands and decreed freedom of assembly, speech, press, religion and an eight-hour day for government employees.

The Australian gold rushes attracted many skilled tradesmen to Australia. Some of them had been active in the chartism movement, and subsequently became prominent in the campaign for better working conditions in the Australian colonies. The eight-hour day began in 1856 in the month of May.

[[File:8hoursday banner 1856.jpg|left|thumb|Eight-hour day banner, Melbourne, 1856]]

The Stonemasons' Society in Sydney issued an ultimatum to employers on 18 August 1855 saying that after six months masons would work only an eight-hour day. Due to the rapid increase in population caused by the gold rushes, many buildings were being constructed, so skilled labour was scarce. Stonemasons working on the Holy Trinity Church and the Mariners' Church (an evangelical mission to seafarers), decided not to wait and pre-emptively went on strike, thus winning the eight-hour day. They celebrated with a victory dinner on 1 October 1855 which to this day is celebrated as a Labour Day holiday in the state of [[New South Wales]]. When the six-month ultimatum expired in February 1856, stonemasons generally agitated for a reduction of hours. Although opposed by employers, a two-week strike on the construction of Tooth's Brewery on Parramatta Road proved effective, and stonemasons won an eight-hour day by early March 1856, but with a reduction in wages to match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cahill|first=Rowan|title=The Eight Hour Day and the Holy Spirit|url=http://workers.labor.net.au/features/200502/b_tradeunion_hours.html|work=Workers Online|publisher=Labor Council of N.S.W.|accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agitation was also occurring in Melbourne where the craft unions were more militant. Stonemasons working on [[Melbourne University]] organised to down tools on 21 April 1856 and march to Parliament House with other members of the building trade. The movement in Melbourne was led by veteran chartists and mason [[James Stephens (trade unionist)|James Stephens]], T.W. Vine and James Galloway. The government agreed that workers employed on public works should enjoy an eight-hour day with no loss of pay and Stonemasons celebrated with a holiday and procession on Monday 12 May 1856, when about 700 people marched with 19 trades involved. By 1858 the eight-hour day was firmly established in the building industry and by 1860 the eight-hour day was fairly widely worked in Victoria. From 1879 the eight-hour day was a public holiday in Victoria. The initial success in Melbourne led to the decision to organise a movement, to actively spread the eight-hour idea, and secure the condition generally.

In 1903 veteran socialist [[Tom Mann]] spoke to a crowd of a thousand people at the unveiling of the Eight Hour Day monument, funded by public subscription, on the south side of Parliament House on Spring St. It was relocated in 1923 to the corner of Victoria and Russell Streets outside [[Melbourne Trades Hall]].

[[File:Wyalong eight hour day.jpg|thumb|Eight-hour day procession by miners in [[Wyalong, New South Wales]] – late 1890s]]

It took further campaigning and struggles by trade unions to extend the reduction in hours to all workers in Australia. In 1916 the ''Victoria Eight Hours Act'' was passed granting the eight-hour day to all workers in the state. The eight-hour day was not achieved nationally until the 1920s. The Commonwealth Arbitration Court gave approval of the 40-hour five-day working week nationally beginning on 1 January 1948. The achievement of the eight-hour day has been described by historian [[Rowan Cahill]] as "one of the great successes of the Australian working class during the nineteenth century, demonstrating to Australian workers that it was possible to successfully organise, mobilise, agitate, and exercise significant control over working conditions and quality of life. The Australian trade union movement grew out of eight-hour campaigning and the movement that developed to promote the principle."

The intertwined numbers '''888''' soon adorned the [[pediment]] of many union buildings around Australia. The Eight Hour March, which began on 21 April 1856, continued each year until 1951 in Melbourne, when the conservative [[Victorian Trades Hall Council]] decided to forgo the tradition for the [[Moomba]] festival on the Labour Day weekend. In capital cities and towns across Australia, Eight Hour day marches became a regular social event each year, with early marches often restricted to those workers who had won an eight-hour day.

===New Zealand===
Promoted by Samuel Duncan Parnell as early as 1840, when carpenter [[Samuel Duncan Parnell|Samuel Parnell]] refused to work more than eight hours a day when erecting a store for merchant [[George Hunter (mayor)|George Hunter]]. He successfully negotiated this working condition and campaigned for its extension in the infant [[Wellington]] community. A meeting of Wellington [[carpenter]]s in October 1840 pledged "to maintain the eight-hour working day, and that anyone offending should be ducked into the harbour".

Parnell is reported to have said: "There are twenty-four hours per day given us; eight of these should be for work, eight for sleep, and the remaining eight for recreation and in which for men to do what little things they want for themselves." With tradesmen in short supply the employer was forced to accept Parnell's terms. Parnell later wrote, "the first strike for eight hours a day the world has ever seen, was settled on the spot".&lt;ref name="DNZB Parnell"&gt;{{DNZB|title=Samuel Duncan Parnell|first= Bert |last= Roth |authorlink=Bert Roth|id=5r28|accessdate=26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/eight-hour-day-movement | title=Eight-Hour-Day Movement (in New Zealand) | work=[[Encyclopaedia of New Zealand]] | year=1966 | accessdate=29 January 2017 |dead-url=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001203225/http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/eight-hour-day-movement/1 |archivedate=1 October 2012 |author=[[Bert Roth]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emigrants to the new settlement of [[Dunedin]], Otago, while onboard ship decided on a reduction of working hours. When the resident agent of the New Zealand Company, [[William Cargill|Captain Cargill]], attempted to enforce a ten-hour day in January 1849 in [[Dunedin]], he was unable to overcome the resistance of trades people under the leadership of house painter and plumber, Samuel Shaw.  Building trades in [[Auckland]] achieved the eight-hour day on 1 September 1857 after agitation led by Chartist painter, William Griffin. For many years the eight-hour day was confined to craft tradesmen and unionised workers. [[Labour Day#New Zealand|Labour Day]], which commemorates the introduction of the eight-hour day, became a national public holiday in 1899.

==South America==
{{expand section|date=June 2014}}
A strike for the eight-hour day was held in May 1919 in [[Peru]]. In [[Uruguay]], the eight-hour day was put in place in 1915 of several reforms implemented during the second term of president [[José Batlle y Ordóñez]]. It was introduced in [[History of Chile|Chile]] on 8 September 1924 at the demand of then-general [[Luis Altamirano]] as part of the [[Saber noise|''Ruido de sables'']] that culminated in the [[September Junta]].

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Elon Ganor  was born in Geneva Switzerland in 1964, grew up in Tel Aviv, Israel where he graduated from [[Tel Aviv University]] Sackler Medical school and got an MD in 1975.

===Entrepreneurship career===
After years of practicing medicine Ganor shifted his energy to the creation of technology related companies. His first company was Virovahl S,A- a Swiss-based biotechnology company that he founded in 1987 with a group of Swedish Virologists, the company's laboratory was located in Gothenburg, Sweden. Virovahl SA, developed the world's first HIV synthetic peptide based on diagnostic test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| date = September 28, 1988| title= Synthetic peptide antigens for the detection of HIV-1 infection. | url = http://www.freepatentsonline.com/EP0284587.html| website = http://www.freepatentsonline.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Under his guidance as President of Virovahl, the test was licensed exclusively to [[Pharmacia]] AB from Uppsala Sweden (Later merged with [[Upjohn]]).&lt;ref name="Elon-Ganor-VocalTec"/&gt;

In 1990 Ganor joined forces with [[Alon Cohen]] and [[Lior Haramaty]] who formed 6 months earlier VocalTec LTd in Israel. Cohen and Haramaty developed and manufactured a PC sound card (SpeechBoard TM) that was sold mainly to the local visually impaired community in Israel with a unique Text to Speech software enabling blind people to use a computer in the Hebrew language.
Since that market was limited, as VocalTec CEO and Chairman, Ganor decided to shift the company's focus to software. In 1993 VocalChat was born, a software that enabled voice communication from one PC to another on a local and wide area network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| date = February 14, 94| title= VOCALTEC INTRODUCES VOCALCHAT WAN FOR VOICE COMMUNICATIONS OVER CORPORATE WIDE AREA NETWORKS. | url = http://www.thefreelibrary.com/VOCALTEC+INTRODUCES+VOCALCHAT+WAN+FOR+VOICE+COMMUNICATIONS+OVER...-a014804936| website = http://www.thefreelibrary.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The software was developed by a group of developers including Ofer Kahana (later the founder of Kagoor that was sold to Juniper),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| date = March 29, 2005| title= JUNIPER NETWORKS, INC. TO ACQUIRE KAGOOR NETWORKS. | url = http://www.juniper.net/us/en/company/press-center/press-releases/2005/kgr/pr-050329.html| website = http://www.juniper.net/us/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elad Sion (Served in Israel TOP 8200 Intelligence army unit, died young in a car accident), Ofer Shem Tov (A software developer in Israel)&lt;ref name="von" /&gt; and others. The software was presented in Atlanta in May 1993 at the Network InterOp trade show.&lt;ref name="von" /&gt; In 1994 support for Internet Protocol was added and on Friday, February 10, 1995 “Internet Phone“ was launched with a near full page Wall Street Journal article by WSJ Boston Correspondent Bill Bulkeley, “Hello World! Audible chats On the Internet” was the header.&lt;ref name ="wallstreetjournal" /&gt;

VocalTec Ltd became a Nasdaq traded company exactly one year later in February 1996 with Ganor as its Chairman &amp; CEO.
In 1997 Ganor with the help of Michael Spencer (At the time Principal at [[Booz Allen Hamilton]] who led the Internet Strategy Group of the Communications, Media and Technology practice) wrote the business plan for a new type of a VoIP exchange phone company.&lt;ref name="von" /&gt; After meeting [[Tom Evslin]] from [[AT&amp;T]] (who led at the time WorldNet AT&amp;T ISP initiative) [[ITXC]] was founded, With Tom Evslin as its CEO and cofounder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=VoIP Nostalgia
|url=http://blog.tomevslin.com/2007/10/voip-nostalgia.html
|website=http://blog.tomevslin.com/
}}&lt;/ref&gt; VocalTec under Ganor invested the initial $500K and gave a credit of $1Million in VoIP Gateway equipment in exchange of 19.9% of the new company, AT&amp;T followed with an additional investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| date = August 18, 99 | title= "Maariv": ITXC, in Which VocalTec Holds 19.9%, to Be Issued at $300 Mln Value|url =http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=377421|website =http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/nodeview.asp?fid=942}}&lt;/ref&gt;
ITXC became the world's largest VoIP Carrier reaching a market cap of about $8 Billion as a Nasdaq company in 2000 (prior to the March 2008 crash).{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

In 2008 Ganor became the founder, investor and CEO (with Danny Frumkin, PhD and Adam Wasserstrom, PhD as co-founders) of Nucleix. Nucleix Ltd is a [[Biotechnology]] epigenetic company involved in unique development of Bio-Markers and technologies for Forensic medicine. The company developed a product for the authentication of DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| date = August 20, 2009 |last=Blankenhorn|first=Dana | title= Former VocalTec CEO takes on biological identity theft|url =http://www.smartplanet.com/blog/thinking-tech/former-vocaltec-ceo-takes-on-biological-identity-theft/1140|website =http://www.smartplanet.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ganor left VocalTec in 2006 to enroll back to school to study art at Midrasha Leomanut Beit Berl, Israel. Graduated in 2008 with Photography being his main passion and focus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Alon |first=Ktzia |date=September 14, 2008 |title=שואו ביזנס: מיני-אינדקס של "הקפיטליזם בתמונות" למתחילים |trans-title=Show biz: mini-index of "Capitalism in pictures" for beginners|url=http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1000381668 |language=Hebrew |newspaper=Globes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Among his works, “Wall Street” a series of staged photographs shot in NY and Israel expressing criticism of Wall Street practices (first exhibited in 2008 just before the [[Lehman Bros]] collapse).

In [[proprietary software]], an '''end-user license agreement''' ('''EULA''') or '''software license agreement''' is the [[contract]] between the licensor and purchaser, establishing the purchaser's right to use the software. The license may define ways under which the copy can be used, in addition to the automatic rights of the buyer including the first sale doctrine and {{USC|17|117}} (freedom to use, archive, re-sale, and backup with legal restrictions).

Many form contracts are only contained in digital form, and only presented to a user as a [[#Shrink-wrap and click-wrap licenses|click-through]] where the user must "accept". As the user may not see the agreement until after he or she has already purchased the software, these documents may be [[contracts of adhesion]].

Software companies often make special agreements with large businesses and government entities that include support contracts and specially drafted warranties.

Some end-user license agreements accompany shrink-wrapped software that is presented to a user sometimes on paper or more usually electronically, during the installation procedure. The user has the choice of accepting or rejecting the agreement. The installation of the software is conditional to the user clicking a button labelled "accept".  See &lt;!--the # (called an "anchor") means it is on the same page--&gt;[[#Shrink-wrap and click-wrap licenses|below]].

Many EULAs assert extensive liability limitations.  Most commonly, an EULA will attempt to [[hold harmless]] the software licensor in the event that the software causes damage to the user's computer or data, but some software also proposes limitations on whether the licensor can be held liable for damage that arises through improper use of the software (for example, incorrectly using tax preparation software and incurring penalties as a result).  One case upholding such limitations on [[consequential damages]] is ''M.A. Mortenson Co. v. Timberline Software Corp., et al.''{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}  Some EULAs also claim restrictions on venue and applicable law in the event that a legal dispute arises.

Some copyright owners use EULAs in an effort to circumvent limitations the applicable copyright law places on their copyrights (such as the limitations in sections 107–122 of the [[United States Copyright Act]]), or to expand the scope of control over the work into areas for which copyright protection is denied by law (such as attempting to charge for, regulate or prevent private performances of a work beyond a certain number of performances or beyond a certain period of time). Such EULAs are, in essence, efforts to gain control, by contract, over matters upon which copyright law precludes control.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This kind of EULAs concurs in aim with [[Digital rights management|DRM]] and both may be used as alternate methods for widening control over software.

In disputes of this nature in the United States, cases are often appealed and different circuit courts of appeal sometimes disagree about these clauses.  This provides an opportunity for the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] to intervene, which it has usually done in a scope-limited and cautious manner, providing little in the way of [[precedent]] or settled law. {{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

End-user license agreements are usually lengthy, and written in highly specific legal language, making it difficult for the average user to give informed consent&lt;ref&gt;Bashir, M., Hayes, C., Lambert, A. D., &amp; Kesan, J. P. (2015). Online privacy and informed consent: The dilemma of information asymmetry. Proceedings of the Association for Information Science and Technology, 52(1), 1-10. doi:10.1002/pra2.2015.145052010043&lt;/ref&gt;.  If the company designs the end-user license agreement in a way that intentionally discourages users to read them, and uses difficult to understand language, many users may be unable to give their informed consent.  This is especially relevant when these agreements concern the privacy of the users.  However, users are ultimately responsible for reading signing and understanding these agreements.

==Comparison with free software licenses==
{{main|Free software license}}
A [[free software]] license grants users of that software the rights to use for any purpose, modify and redistribute creative works and software, both of which are forbidden by the defaults of copyright, and generally not granted with [[proprietary software]]. These licenses typically include a disclaimer of [[warranty]], but this feature is not unique to free software.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Copyleft]] licenses also include a key addition provision that must be followed in order to copy or modify the software, that requires the user to provide source code for the work and to distribute their modifications under the same license (or sometimes a compatible one); thus effectively protecting derivative works from losing the original permissions and being used in proprietary programs.

Unlike EULAs, free software licenses do not work as contractual extensions to existing legislation. No agreement between parties is ever held, because a copyright license is simply a declaration of permissions on something that otherwise would be disallowed by default under copyright law.&lt;ref name=moglen /&gt;

==Shrink-wrap and click-wrap licenses {{Anchor|Shrink-wrap and click-wrap licenses}}==
{{main|Clickwrap|Browsewrap|Shrink wrap contract}}

The term '''shrink-wrap license''' refers colloquially to any software license agreement which is enclosed within a software package and is inaccessible to the customer until after purchase.  Typically, the license agreement is printed on paper included inside the boxed software.  It may also be presented to the user on-screen during installation, in which case the license is sometimes referred to as a '''click-wrap license'''.  The inability of the customer to review the license agreement before purchasing the software has caused such licenses to run afoul of legal challenges in some cases.

Whether shrink-wrap licenses are legally binding differs between jurisdictions, though a majority of jurisdictions hold such licenses to be enforceable. At particular issue is the difference in opinion between two US courts in ''[http://www.internetlibrary.com/cases/lib_case209.cfm Klocek v. Gateway]'' and ''[http://www.netlitigation.com/netlitigation/cases/brower.htm Brower v. Gateway]''.  Both cases involved a shrink-wrapped license document provided by the online vendor of a computer system.  The terms of the shrink-wrapped license were not provided at the time of purchase, but were rather included with the shipped product as a printed document.  The license required the customer to return the product within a limited time frame if the license was not agreed to.  In ''Brower'', New York's state appeals court ruled that the terms of the shrink-wrapped license document were enforceable because the customer's assent was evident by its failure to return the merchandise within the 30 days specified by the document.  The U.S. District Court of Kansas in ''Klocek'' ruled that the contract of sale was complete at the time of the transaction, and the additional shipped terms contained in a document similar to that in ''Brower'' did not constitute a contract, because the customer never agreed to them when the contract of sale was completed.

Further, in ''[[ProCD v. Zeidenberg]]'', the license was ruled enforceable because it was necessary for the customer to assent to the terms of the agreement by clicking on an "I Agree" button in order to install the software. In [[Specht v. Netscape Communications Corp.]], however, the licensee was able to download and install the software without first being required to review and positively assent to the terms of the agreement, and so the license was held to be unenforceable.

Click-wrap license agreements refer to website based contract formation (see [[iLan Systems, Inc. v. Netscout Service Level Corp.]]). A common example of this occurs where a user must affirmatively assent to license terms of a website, by ''clicking'' "yes" on a pop-up, in order to access website features. This is therefore analogous to shrink-wrap licenses, where a buyer implied agrees to license terms by first removing the software package's shrink-wrap and then utilizing the software itself. In both types of analysis, focus is on the actions of end user and asks whether there is an explicit or implicit acceptance of the additional licensing terms.

==Product liability==
Most licenses for software sold at retail disclaim (as far as local laws permit) any [[warranty]] on the performance of the software and limit liability for any damages to the purchase price of the software.  One well-known case which upheld such a disclaimer is Mortenson v. Timberline .

==Patent==
{{main|Software patent}}
In addition to the implied [[exhaustion doctrine]], the distributor may include patent licenses along with software.

==Reverse engineering==
Forms often prohibit users from [[reverse engineering]]. This may also serve to make it difficult to develop third-party software which interoperates with the licensed software, thus [[Vendor lock-in|increasing the value of the publisher's solutions]] through decreased customer choice. In the United States, EULA provisions can preempt the reverse engineering rights implied by fair use, c.f. [[Bowers v. Baystate Technologies]].

Some licenses&lt;ref&gt;Examples include [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms994405.aspx Microsoft .NET Framework redistributable EULA]&lt;/ref&gt; purport to prohibit a user's right to release data on the performance of the software, but this has yet to be challenged in court.

==Enforceability of EULAs in the United States==
{{Primary sources|section about the legal enforceability of end-user license agreements|date=July 2015}}

The enforceability of an EULA depends on several factors, one of them being the court in which the case is heard.  Some courts that have addressed the validity of the shrinkwrap license agreements have found some EULAs to be invalid, characterizing them as [[adhesion contract|contracts of adhesion]], [[Unconscionability|unconscionable]], and/or unacceptable pursuant to the [[Uniform Commercial Code|U.C.C.]]—see, for instance, ''[[Step-Saver Data Systems, Inc. v. Wyse Technology]]'',&lt;ref&gt;939 F.2d 91 (3rd Cir., 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Vault Corp. v. Quaid Software Ltd.]]''.&lt;ref&gt;847 F.2d 255 (5th Cir., 1988)&lt;/ref&gt;  Other courts have determined that the shrinkwrap license agreement is valid and enforceable: see ''[[ProCD, Inc. v. Zeidenberg]]'',&lt;ref&gt;86 F.3d 1447 (7th Cir., 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Microsoft Corp. v. Harmony Comps. &amp; Elecs., Inc.|Microsoft v. Harmony Computers]]'',&lt;ref&gt;846 F. Supp. 208 (E.D.N.Y., 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Novell v. Network Trade Center]]'',&lt;ref&gt;25 F.Supp.2d 1218 (D. Utah, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Ariz. Cartridge Remanufacturers Ass'n v. Lexmark Int'l, Inc.]]''&lt;ref&gt;421 F.3d 981 (9th Cir., 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; may have some bearing as well. No court has ruled on the validity of EULAs generally; decisions are limited to particular provisions and terms.

The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|7th Circuit]] and [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|8th Circuit]] subscribe to the "licensed and not sold" argument, while most other circuits do not {{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}.  In addition, the contracts' enforceability depends on whether the state has passed the [[Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act]] (UCITA) or [[Anti-UCITA]] ([[UCITA Bomb Shelter]]) laws. In Anti-UCITA states, the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] (UCC) has been amended to either specifically define software as a good (thus making it fall under the UCC), or to disallow contracts which specify that the terms of contract are subject to the laws of a state that has passed UCITA.

Recently{{when|date=December 2013}}, publishers have begun to [[encryption|encrypt]] their software packages to make it impossible for a user to install the software without either agreeing to the license agreement or violating the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA) and [[WIPO Copyright Treaty|foreign counterparts]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

The DMCA specifically provides for reverse engineering of software for interoperability purposes, so there was some controversy as to whether software license agreement clauses which restrict this are enforceable.  The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|8th Circuit]] case of ''[[Davidson &amp; Associates v. Jung]]''&lt;ref&gt;422 F. 3d 630 (8th Cir., 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; determined that such clauses are enforceable, following the [[Federal Circuit]] decision of ''[[Bowers v. Baystate Technologies|Baystate v. Bowers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;302 F.3d 1334 (Fed. Cir., 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Jerry Pournelle]] wrote in 1983, "I've seen no evidence to show that ... Levitical agreements — full of "Thou Shalt Nots" — have any effect on piracy". He gave an example of an EULA that was impossible for a user to comply with, stating "Come on, fellows. No one expects these agreements to be kept". Noting that in practice many companies were more generous to their customers than their EULAs required, Pournelle wondered "Why, then, do they insist on making their customers sign 'agreements' that the customer has no intention of keeping, and which the company ''knows'' won't be kept? ... Must we continue making hypocrites out of both publishers and customers?"&lt;ref name="pournelle198306"&gt;{{cite magazine | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1983-06/1983_06_BYTE_08-06_16-Bit_Designs#page/n411/mode/2up | title=Zenith Z-100, Epson QX-10, Software Licensing, and the Software Piracy Problem | magazine=BYTE | date=June 1983 | accessdate=20 October 2013 | author=Pournelle, Jerry | pages=411}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One common criticism of end-user license agreements is that they are often far too lengthy for users to devote the time to thoroughly read them. In March 2012, the [[PayPal]] end-user license agreement was 36,275 words long&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No One Reads the "Terms And Conditions" and Here’s Why|url=http://1025kiss.com/no-one-reads-the-terms-and-conditions-and-heres-why/|publisher=102.5 KISSFM|accessdate=24 November 2012|author=Heathen|date=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in May 2011 the [[iTunes]] agreement was 56 pages long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pidaparthy|first=Umika|title=What you should know about iTunes' 56-page legal terms|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/TECH/web/05/06/itunes.terms/|accessdate=24 November 2012|newspaper=CNN|date=May 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; News sources reporting these findings asserted that the vast majority of users do not read the documents because of their length.

Several companies have parodied this belief that users do not read the end-user-license agreements by adding unusual clauses, knowing that few users will ever read them. As an [[April Fool's Day]] joke, [[Gamestation]] added a clause stating that users who placed an order on April 1, 2010 agreed to irrevocably [[Deal with the Devil|give their soul]] to the company, which 7,500 users agreed to. Although there was a checkbox to exempt out of the "immortal soul" clause, few users checked it and thus Gamestation concluded that 88% of their users did not read the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=7,500 Online Shoppers Unknowingly Sold Their Souls|url=http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2010/04/15/online-shoppers-unknowingly-sold-souls/|accessdate=24 November 2012|newspaper=FoxNews.com|date=April 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program [[PC Pitstop]] included a clause in their end-user license agreement stating that anybody who read the clause and contacted the company would receive a monetary reward, but it took four months and over 3,000 software downloads before anybody collected it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Magid|first=Larry|title=PC Pitstop|url=http://www.pcpitstop.com/spycheck/eula.asp|accessdate=24 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the installation of version 4 of the Advanced Query Tool the installer measured the elapsed time between the appearance and the acceptance of the end-user license agreements to calculate the average reading speed. If the agreements were accepted fast enough a dialog window “congratulated” the users to their absurdly high reading speed of several hundred words per second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Willmott|first=Don|title=Backspace (v22n08)|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,1034132,00.asp|work=PCMag.com|accessdate=8 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[South Park]]'' parodied this in the episode "[[HumancentiPad]]", where [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] had neglected to read the terms of service for his last iTunes update and therefore inadvertently agreed to have [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] employees experiment upon him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Grady|first=Jason D.|title=South Park parodies iTunes terms and conditions|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/apple/south-park-parodies-itunes-terms-and-conditions/10043|publisher=ZDNet|accessdate=24 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

End-user license agreements have also been criticized for containing terms that impose onerous obligations on consumers. For example, Clickwrapped, a service that rates consumer companies according to how well they respect the rights of users, reports that they increasingly include a term that prevents a user from suing the company in court.&lt;ref&gt;Jamillah Knowles. ''Clickwrapped report tells you which sites claim ownership of your content, and you’ll be surprised''. TheNextWeb. August 21, 2012. Accessed July 29, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''European Closing Bell''''' (prior to June 2003 known as '''''European Market Wrap''''' ) was a [[television programme]] aired on [[business]] [[news]] [[television station|channel]] [[CNBC Europe]] from 5pm to 6pm [[Central European Time|CET]] (4pm to 5pm [[Western European Time|WET]]), and from 11am to 12pm on [[CNBC World]] in the United States. The programme was presented from [[London]] by [[Louisa Bojesen]]. The show covered the last half-hour of [[Trader (finance)|trades]] in the European [[stock market|equity markets]], and reported on the day's final numbers and top stories as the markets close at 5:30pm CET. As the major European markets are electronic, no actual "closing bell" was rung - nonetheless there was a countdown on the CNBC Europe [[Digital on-screen graphic|strap]] and video wall until the close of trade. Other regular segments included a daily "Guest Investor" and a [[technical analysis]] slot.

Prior to 26 March 2007, the programme ran for two hours until 7pm CET. The second hour of the programme was of a slower pace, offering a more in-depth look at financial and political events. During major European [[trade fair]]s and political events such as [[European Union|EU]] summits and [[election]]s, ''European Closing Bell'' was often anchored live from these events. Many of these features were incorporated into the extended ''[[Europe Tonight]]'' after its relaunch on the same date.

The theme music for the programme is the same as that used by the US version of ''[[Closing Bell]]''.

On 9 March 2015, ''European Closing Bell'' launched new titles based on the US version used since 13 October 2014.

On 18 December 2015, ''European Closing Bell'' ended its 12-year run as it was replaced with the US-produced ''[[Squawk Alley]]'', which began airing on CNBC Europe on 21 December 2015.

ECBE's [[educational accreditation|accreditation]] process is based upon self and peer evaluation, aimed to ensure the continual improvement of educational quality. ECBE is overseen by a Board of Directors elected from the accredited members. A separate Board of Commissioners, independent of the Board of Directors are selected to oversee the application of procedures and the awarding of accreditation. ECBE is a registered affiliate of the [[European Association for Quality Assurance in Higher Education]] (ENQA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=AFFILIATES ENQA|url=http://www.enqa.eu/index.php/enqa-agencies/affiliates/|journal=http://www.enqa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation]] (CHEA) International Quality Group (IQG) [https://web.archive.org/web/20141003190226/http://www.cheainternational.org/pdf/CIQG%20Members.pdf]

'''Experience-focused counselling''' ('''EFC''') is an approach to [[counselling]] aimed specifically at those who experience [[Auditory hallucination|auditory hallucinations]], [[Visual hallucination|visions]] or other phenomena which are commonly associated with [[schizophrenia]] and other mental disorders.

== History ==

The term "experience-focused counseling" originated from traditional talk therapy,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://dsm.psychiatryonline.org/doi/book/10.1176/appi.books.9780890425596|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|last=American Psychiatric Association|date=2013-05-22|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|isbn=0890425558|language=en|doi=10.1176/appi.books.9780890425596}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=September 2018}} which focuses on discussing the experiences of the individual to examine the cause of their symptoms. This type of therapy is most common in trauma survivors.{{cn|date=September 2018}} Experience-focused counseling is used or referred to in the long-term treatment of trauma and mental health conditions and is focused on the traumatic experiences and symptoms of the person receiving the treatment to work through them and slowly move towards recovery. 

Experience-focused counseling is now a new sub-type of counseling which has become the foundation of the peer movement,{{clarify|date=September 2018}} and is often used in [[peer support]].{{cn|date=September 2018}}

== Providers ==
Counselors,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.counseling.org/|title=American Counseling Association {{!}}A professional home for counselors|website=www.counseling.org|access-date=2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; mentors, psychologists,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/life-physical-and-social-science/psychologists.htm|title=Psychologists:  Occupational Outlook Handbook:: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; psychiatrists, and social workers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/community-and-social-service/social-workers.htm|title=Social Workers: Occupational Outlook Handbook:: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; all provide different levels of experience-focused counseling depending on the training they have received and their scope of practice. Many use traditional talk therapy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-couch/201011/does-talk-therapy-really-work|title=Does Talk Therapy Really Work?|website=Psychology Today|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; methods which were the original foundation of the experience-focused counseling movement. 

In addition to individual practitioners, many agencies and nonprofits have also began to provide peer supportive services, such as the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nami.org/|title=NAMI|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the National Peer support Network,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://peersforprogress.org/npscln/|title=National Peer Support Network {{!}} Peers For Progress|website=peersforprogress.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; the National Peer Helpers Association,&lt;ref name="tigweb peer"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://orgs.tigweb.org/national-peer-helpers-association-npha|title=National Peer Helpers Associat... - Organizations - TakingITGlobal|website=orgs.tigweb.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; SAMHSA,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.samhsa.gov/|title=SAMHSA - Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration|website=www.samhsa.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; National Peer Review Committee,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aicpa.org/interestareas/peerreview/community/nationalprc.html|title=National Peer Review Committee (NPRC)|website=AICPA|language=en|access-date=2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and numerous independent service providers and community mental healthcare providers. Now, each state in the U.S. has incorporated this type of experience-focused counseling into their mental healthcare practices.

== Method ==
Depending on the symptoms, histories and traumas of the individual receiving treatment, the methods of treatment may vary, as the experience-focused counseling and peer support movement&lt;ref name="tigweb peer"/&gt; focuses on the worldview of the individuals. Typically, experience-focused counseling is performed by discussing the symptoms of the individual and their emotional and physical responses to trauma and/or mental illness by examining the individuals' current and past experiences to locate the cause(s) of their symptoms.

By focusing on the experience of the individual rather than the illness, the provider can begin to assist their client in finding the root cause of the trauma and onset of the symptoms causing the distress.

Various therapeutic techniques are used to assist the client in gaining insight and working through symptoms and emotional responses to their individual experiences. These may include:

* Standard talk therapies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/psychotherapies/index.shtml|title=NIMH » Psychotherapies|website=www.nimh.nih.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cognitive behavioral therapy
* EMDR&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://emdria.site-ym.com/page/emdr_therapy|title=EMDR Therapy - EMDR International Association|website=emdria.site-ym.com|access-date=2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cognitive processing therapy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ptsd.va.gov/public/treatment/therapy-med/cognitive_processing_therapy.asp|title=Cognitive Processing Therapy for PTSD - PTSD: National Center for PTSD|website=www.ptsd.va.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Art therapy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://arttherapy.org/|title=American Art Therapy Association|website=American Art Therapy Association|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Nature therapy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nature-therapy.us/index.html|title=Nature Therapy|website=Nature Therapy|language=en|access-date=2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Music therapy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.musictherapy.org/|title=American Music Therapy Association {{!}} American Music Therapy Association (AMTA)|website=www.musictherapy.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Peer support&lt;ref name="tigweb peer"/&gt;
* Group therapy

== Recipients ==
While many individuals with other forms of mental illnesses often benefit from a combination of therapies including experience-focused counseling,{{mcn|date=September 2018}} it is of note that peer support&lt;ref name="mha peer"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mentalhealthamerica.net/center-peer-support|title=Center for Peer Support|date=2016-05-27|work=Mental Health America|access-date=2018-07-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; is provided to every individual seeking help, regardless of diagnosis.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Due to the fact that each person is unique in their traumas and experiences, people can and often do pursue other therapeutic interventions and treatments as well.

== Training and accreditations ==
Counselors, mentors, psychologists, psychiatrists, and social workers all provide different levels of experience-focused counseling depending on the type of therapy they choose to practice, the training they have received, and their scope of practice.

As multiple types of therapists have the ability to perform this type of counseling, the main providers of this technique are listed below:

'''Francis Buchholz''' (born 19 February 1954 in [[Hannover]], Germany) is a German bass guitarist best known as a former member of the rock/hard rock band [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]].

==Biography==
Buchholz discovered rock music at the age of 11. His first public appearance as a bass player was at age 15 while in a high school. From then on he played in different rock, blues and jazz bands in his hometown of Hannover. While a mechanical engineering student at the [[University of Hannover]] and taking classes at the [[Hochschule für Musik, Theater und Medien Hannover]], Buchholz joined Dawn Road, whose lineup included guitarist [[Ulrich Roth|Uli Roth]]. Eventually the musicians from Dawn Road and the Scorpions merged into a new incarnation of the Scorpions in 1973, with Buchholz on bass. Buchholz' first recording with the Scorpions was 1974's ''[[Fly to the Rainbow]]'', and he stayed as a band member for 18 years, recording 12 albums during the band's most commercially successful period. Together they sold over 15 million records in the USA alone and over 100&amp;nbsp;million records worldwide. For his success with the Scorpions, Buchholz was awarded with over 50 gold and platinum awards for record sales all over the world. He left the band after a disagreement over band management in 1992.&lt;ref name="getready"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.getreadytoroll.com/interviews/francisbuchholz.htm | title = Francis Buchholz Interview | publisher = ''Get Ready To Roll'' | date = 5 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; His last album with the Scorpions was ''[[Crazy World (Scorpions album)|Crazy World]]'', which also contained the only Scorpions track Buchholz contributed to writing, "Kicks After Six".

Buchholz reunited with Uli Roth for a tour of Europe and the United States in 2005 and 2006. 
In 2008 Buchholz worked with the band Dreamtide as their bassplayer and co-producer, the album "Dream And Deliver" was released in Japan (King Records), Europe (AOR Heaven) and worldwide on iTunes.&lt;ref name="dreamtidesite"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://dream-and-deliver.com | title = Band | publisher = Dreamtide Official | accessdate = 2009-05-22 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090512195613/http://dream-and-deliver.com/ | archivedate = 12 May 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Buchholz toured with former Scorpions lead guitarist [[Michael Schenker]] for the European dates of his "Temple of Rock - Lovedrive Reunion Tour" alongside former Scorpions drummer [[Herman Rarebell]], with ex-[[Rainbow (English band)|Rainbow]] vocalist [[Doogie White]] and MSG's Wayne Findley on guitars and keys. The "Temple of Rock – Lovedrive Reunion" tour went through Europe and Far East. A DVD, Blu-ray and Double-CD "Temple Of Rock - Live in Europe" was released for Christmas 2012.

Temple Of Rock's next album "Bridge The Gap" featured Buchholz on Bass, it was released in November 2013. A European tour in 2013 was followed by concerts in Mexico and South America and in 2014 they toured Japan and Europe. Their new album "Spirit On A Mission was released in 2015 and the band toured USA, Japan and Europe. Early in 2016 they play more shows in UK and Scandinavia.

'''Good Epidemiological Practices'''  or '''Good Epidemiology Practices''' ('''GEP''') was a set of guidelines produced by the U.S. [[Chemical Manufacturers Association]] (CMA) in 1991 to improve [[epidemiology|epidemiologic]] research practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Guidelines for Good Epidemiology Practices for Occupational and Environmental Epidemiologic Research. The Chemical Manufacturers Association's Epidemiology Task Group. |journal=J Occup Med. |date=December 1991 |volume=33|issue=12|pages=1221–9|pmid= 1800677}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then adopted by the [[tobacco industry]] around 1993 as part of its "sound science" program to counter criticisms of the industry on health and environmental issues such as [[Passive smoking|secondhand smoke]].&lt;ref name="ong"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Constructing "Sound Science" and "Good Epidemiology": Tobacco, Lawyers, and Public Relations Firms |journal=Am J Public Health|date=November 2001 |volume=91|issue=11|pages=1749–57|pmid=11684593 |pmc=1446868 |authors= Ong EK, Glantz SA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It failed to make much impact on the US and European regulators, but may have had more influence in its later manifestations in Asia and particularly China.

The complexities of creating Good Epidemiological Practices developments have been examined by University of San Francisco researchers [[Stanton Glantz]] and [[Elisa K. Ong]] in papers such as "Tobacco Industry Efforts to Subvert the IARC's Second hand smoke study" published in ''[[The Lancet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(00)02098-5/fulltext |journal=Lancet |date=8 April 2000 |volume=355|issue=9211|pages=1253–9|title=Tobacco industry efforts subverting International Agency for Research on Cancer's second-hand smoke study|authors=Ong EK, Glantz SA |pmid=10770318 |doi= 10.1016/S0140-6736(00)02098-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that these were industry programs designed to manipulate the scientific standards of proof, and an attempt to set risk-evaluation standards that could be forced through by legislation, and imposed on the agencies ([[EPA]], [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]], etc.) to hamstring the agencies' ability to regulate.&lt;ref name="ong"/&gt;

==Tobacco's GEP==
In February 1993, an executive of [[Philip Morris USA]], Ellen Merlo, wrote a memo to her CEO William Campbell outlining their strategies to discredit the 1992 report by the [[US Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) that identified secondhand smoke as a [[List of IARC Group 1 carcinogens|Group A human carcinogen]], and to counter what she described as "[[junk science]]".&lt;ref name="ong"/&gt;  Their public relations firm, APCO Associates, launched a "sound science" coalition in the United States, and [[The Advancement of Sound Science Coalition]] (TASSC) was formed three months later in May 1993, with [[Garrey Carruthers]] the chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2006/sep/19/ethicalliving.g2 |title=The denial industry |first=George |last=Monbiot |date=September 19, 2006 |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZvIZAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Our Daily Poison: From Pesticides to Packaging, How Chemicals Have Contaminated the Food Chain and Are Making Us Sick|first=Marie-Monique |last=Robin |pages=138&amp;ndash;140 |publisher=The New Press |date=9 December 2014 |isbn=9781595589309 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George L. Carlo]], a science entrepreneur who worked with [[Federal Focus]] Inc., prepared one of the early draft documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/qgjm0128|title=Industry Documents Library|website=www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu |date=May 31, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/lxjm0128|title=Industry Documents Library|website=www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu |date=June 15, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time the legislative{{which|date=March 2018}} and public activist{{who|date=March 2018}} attacks on the tobacco industry had escalated, and they{{who|date=March 2018}} blamed this on the "twisted science" used by the EPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://industrydocuments.library.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/qpfx0005|title=Statements by EPA|website=industrydocuments.library.ucsf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Europe the UN's [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] (IARC) was about to release a similar report, which the tobacco industry also needed to counter.

Helmut Reif, [[Thomas Borelli|Tom Borelli]] and Mitch Ritter at Philip Morris's Science &amp; Technology division thought the CMA's GEP could be improved to help PM develop standards for secondhand smoke epidemiological studies. This initiative to "constructively improve" epidemiology would enlist the assistance of the industry's consultants, and they could then run an "offensive strategy"—essentially another proactive effort by the industry to shape the scientific process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://industrydocuments.library.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/frbb0120|title=Industry Documents Library|website=industrydocuments.library.ucsf.edu|date=March 17, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/pmgx0111|title=Industry Documents Library|website=www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu|date=March 31, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joanna Sullivan, Philip Morris's main PR in Europe, advised her American superiors{{who|date=March 2018}} (June 1994) on how GEP might be used to combat the IARC's report, since this would give United Nations weight to the claim that second-hand smoke was potentially cancerous to non-smokers.  By establishing the standards of epidemiology and by using their influence in Congress to have GEP mandated by legislation, they hoped to design a set of established procedural standards for epidemiology.

The innovation here, was that they{{who|date=March 2018}} aimed to attack the techniques relied on by the EPA and IARC scientists. In the past, they{{who|date=March 2018}} had focussed attacks on specific adverse scientific findings and reports. GEP was designed to directed an attack on the techniques of epidemiology itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/gzwb0003|title=Industry Documents Library|website=www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu|date=June 6, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They{{who|date=March 2018}} may have had little hope that this would be widely accepted by the majority of epidemiologists or by the regulators{{which|date=March 2018}}, but it made possible a vigorous public relations campaign in the media to challenge and denigrate any adverse findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://industrydocuments.library.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/qnmj0115|title=Industry Documents Library|website=industrydocuments.library.ucsf.edu|date=June 16, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Panels and Conferences===
Initially Philip Morris utilised a small panel of trusted epidemiologists{{who|date=March 2018}} who regularly serviced the industry when it needed to defend against some adverse finding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/jgjm0052|title=Industry Documents Library|website=www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu|date=August 1, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were requested to improve on the Chemical Manufacturer's Association's GEP. Later they extended this mandate by conducting seminars on GEP and good risk-assessment practice around the world{{where|date=March 2018}}.  The tobacco industry itself needed to remain invisible and so they needed the front provided by third-party think-tanks and old allies.

The main organisation hired to run the GEP program was [[Federal Focus]] Inc., a PR company set up during the second term of the [[Reagan Administration]] by two top Agency officials, [[Thorne Auchter]], who had been the Director of the OSHA (Occupational Safety &amp; Health Administration) and [[James J. Tozzi]] who had been Reagan's "Deregulation Czar" as head of the OIRA (Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs), at the OMB (Office of Management &amp; Budget). These two and the head of the EPA ([[Anne Gorsuch Burford]]) were among the 20 or so top Agency executives forced (or encouraged) to resign over Reagan's regulatory scandals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/kmvv0175|title=Industry Documents Library|website=www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu|date=December 28, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jim Tozzi's technique at the OIRA was to block regulators{{which|date=March 2018}} from regulating by denying their agencies funding unless they cancelled one regulation before adding another. (Tozzi and Auchter also ran [[Multinational Business Services]], and the [[Institute for Regulatory Policy]]).

The main tobacco law firm, Covington &amp; Burling (C&amp;B) was also involved both in promoting the idea and in recruiting scientists{{who|date=March 2018}} willing to participate, usually only when assured that payment would be laundered through the law firm.  C&amp;B lawyer [[John Rupp]] initiated similar activities in Italy and Germany. The total expenses for this program in 1997 were about $300,000.

The GEP program "experts" that Auchter and Tozzi enlisted were pre-screened by Philip Morris Issues Managers and Federal Focus, and the results they produced were pre-tested at a number of conferences (which often didn't carry the GEP name). The first, known as the Lansdowne Conference, was held at a US conference center with only a few of their most trusted scientist helpers. They then widened the advisory pool and held a [[London Conference]] where Philip Morris opened the operation to British-American Tobacco and the other companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/hlvc0056|title=Industry Documents Library: Appendix Table A-5|website=www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; They established what became known as the London Principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/hhdy0090|title=Principles for Evaluating Epidemiologic Data in Regulatory Risk Assessment|website=www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A German conference soon followed.

Generally GEP failed to influence policy makers in America and Europe{{where|date=March 2018}}, so it was tried in Asia through conferences of the Asian [[WhiteCoats]] group (collectively known as 'ARTIST') and with other recruits in Kuala Lumpur, Hong-Kong, Yokohama,  Beijing, and then Guangzhou.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/hjhh0049|title=International Workshop on Risk Assessment and Good Epidemiological Practices|website=www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://industrydocuments.library.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/qjjv0123|title=Quality Assurance on in Epidemology |author=Robert Walk|website=industrydocuments.library.ucsf.edu |date=January 6, 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The inadvertent whistleblower===
Ted Sanders, who ran the Scientific Affairs operations for Philip Morris in Europe, provides us{{who|date=March 2018}} with an excellent overview of how the Philip Morris GEP unravelled in a long letter of complaint to Cathy Ellis, his executive overseer in Brussels (Apr 3 1998).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/ggdh0180|title=Industry Documents Library|website=www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hearst Television, Inc.''' (formerly '''Hearst-Argyle Television''') is a broadcasting company in the [[United States]] owned by [[Hearst Communications]]. From 1998 to mid-2009, the company traded its common stock on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] under the symbol "HTV."

Hearst-Argyle was formed in 1997 with the merger of Hearst Corporation's broadcasting division and stations owned by '''Argyle Television Holdings II''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-19263839.html Rathbun, Elizabeth A. "Hearst stocks up on Argyles; merged TV group with 14 stations, 11.6% coverage is valued at $1.8 billion.], ''[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]''. March 31, 1997. [[HighBeam Research]]. (February 17, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; which is partially related to the company of the same name who (in 1994) sold its stations to [[New World Communications]], stations that eventually became [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]-owned stations (Hearst itself, unusual for any American broadcast group, has never held a Fox affiliation on any of their stations). Hearst's involvement in broadcasting dates to the 1920s.

In terms of audience reach, Hearst is the third-largest group owner of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]-affiliated stations, behind the [[E. W. Scripps Company]] and [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]], and ahead of [[Tegna, Inc.]], and the second-largest group owner of [[NBC]] affiliates, behind Tegna.

Hearst-owned ABC affiliates in [[National Football League]] markets simulcast ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' games from [[ESPN]] that involve these teams - ESPN is 20% owned by Hearst, the rest being owned by ABC's parent, [[The Walt Disney Company]]. Other Hearst-owned stations also carry ESPN-aired NFL games, even though they are affiliated with other networks (like [[WBAL-TV]], Baltimore's NBC affiliate). Hearst also holds some [[joint venture]]s for [[broadcast syndication|syndicated programming]] with [[NBCUniversal Television Distribution]].

On June 3, 2009, the Hearst Corporation announced that it would purchase substantially all of the stock not held by Hearst. Hearst-Argyle Television then dropped "Argyle" from its name and became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Hearst Corporation.&lt;ref name="Hearst Broadcasting Merger"&gt;[http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/277983-Hearst_Moves_On_Merger.php Hearst Moves On Merger], ''[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]'', June 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital television==
In February 2009, Hearst-Argyle announced that its stations (except for [[KITV]] and its satellites in [[Hawaii]], which had already completed their transition to digital, and [[WPTZ]] in [[Plattsburgh, New York]] and [[WNNE]] in [[Hartford, Vermont]], which followed the other [[Champlain Valley]] in transitioning on February 17, 2009) would comply with the new DTV transition date of June 12, 2009.

==Hearst-owned stations==
[[File:Hearst-Argyle Television logo.png|right|thumb|Hearst-Argyle Television logo, 2007-2009]]
Currently, Hearst owns a total of 34 overall television stations but considers two groups of four stations and an NBC station with an ABC [[digital subchannel]] joint operations, bringing their count down to 31 under that consideration: eleven NBC affiliates, fifteen ABC affiliates (one as a subchannel of an NBC affiliate, and one which acts as a two-station simulcast), two [[CBS]] affiliates, six [[The CW|CW]] affiliates (two traditional, two subchannel (which are part of a two-station simulcast), and two channel shares), two [[MyNetworkTV]] affiliates (one traditional, one subchannel), and one [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]]. Most of the company's subchannel stations broadcast either [[Weigel Broadcasting]]'s [[MeTV]] or NBC's [[Cozi TV]] through national affiliation deals, along with being charter carriers of Weigel's two newest concepts, [[Heroes &amp; Icons]] and [[Movies!]]. Since December 1, 2014, [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]] CBS affiliate [[KCCI]] has used their third subchannel as an H&amp;I affiliate carrying MyNetworkTV programming in primetime. Hearst also owns two radio stations in [[Baltimore]], the last remaining from the company divesting most of their radio assets after the [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]] went into effect. As already mentioned above, none of Hearst's stations have ever held a [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliation, with the exception of two WMUR translators in the northern part of New Hampshire dis-affiliating with the network upon Hearst's assumption of ownership of WMUR.

[[File:Candy Altman at the 68th Annual Peabody Awards for Hearst-Argyle Television-Commitment 2008.jpg|thumb|Candy Altman at the 68th Annual [[Peabody Awards]] for Hearst-Argyle Television-Commitment 2008]]

Some Hearst-owned stations use the "Commitment (Year)" banner for all political news coverage leading up to the local, national, and statewide elections in lieu of a localized version of their associated network's political branding. This started in 2000. Hearst also maintains a [[Washington, D.C.]] [[News bureau|bureau]] to assist their stations in coverage of national politics, including on-air reporters and facilities and equipment assistance for local stations. Many Hearst stations license the "Operation High School" branding for coverage of local [[high school sports]]. In 2007, Hearst-Argyle became one of the first television broadcasting groups to post their news stories on [[YouTube]]. [[WCVB]], [[KCRA-TV|KCRA]], [[WTAE-TV|WTAE]], [[WBAL-TV|WBAL]] and [[WMUR-TV|WMUR]] were the first stations in Hearst-Argyle's station group to do this.

Until 2009, three of Hearst's television stations ([[KCWE]], [[WMOR-TV]], and [[WPBF]]) and its two radio stations ([[WBAL (AM)|WBAL radio]] and [[WIYY]]) were owned by Hearst Broadcasting, Inc., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Hearst Corporation through which Hearst ultimately controlled Hearst-Argyle Television, as opposed to Hearst-Argyle itself; Hearst-Argyle still operated these stations under a management services agreement. These stations were transferred to Hearst Television shortly after its privatization.&lt;ref name="fcc-hearstmsa"&gt;{{cite web|title=Explanation to FCC of Hearst-Argyle privatization|url=https://licensing.fcc.gov/cdbs/CDBS_Attachment/getattachment.jsp?appn=101312805&amp;qnum=5010&amp;copynum=1&amp;exhcnum=1|format=PDF|date=May 18, 2009|work=CDBS Public Access|publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]]|accessdate=August 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fcc-hearsttransfer"&gt;{{cite web|title=Explanation to FCC of Hearst reorganization|url=https://licensing.fcc.gov/cdbs/CDBS_Attachment/getattachment.jsp?appn=101324506&amp;qnum=5010&amp;copynum=1&amp;exhcnum=1|format=PDF|date=July 29, 2009|work=CDBS Public Access|publisher=Federal Communications Commission|accessdate=August 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hearst's television and radio cluster in Baltimore additionally serves as the [[flagship station]]s and operation bases for the [[Baltimore Ravens]] radio and television networks.

On August 20, 2014, it was announced that Hearst Television would acquire [[WVTM]] in Birmingham, Alabama and [[WJCL (TV)|WJCL]] in Savannah, Georgia from [[Media General]], which divested those stations under FCC advisement as part of their acquisition of [[LIN Media]].&lt;ref name="tvnc-saletohearst"&gt;{{cite news|title=Media General, LIN Sell Stations In 5 Markets|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/78615/media-general-lin-sell-stations-in-5-markets|accessdate=August 20, 2014|work=TVNewsCheck|date=August 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="b&amp;c-saletohearst"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Malone|first1=Michael|title=Media General, LIN Divest Stations in Five Markets|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/currency/media-general-lin-divest-stations-five-markets/133323|accessdate=August 20, 2014|work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|date=August 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 6, 2017, Hearst acquired majority control of [[Charleston, South Carolina]]-based [[broadcast syndication|syndicator]] [[Litton Entertainment]], which has control of four of the five [[E/I]]-compliant Saturday morning blocks on the five major broadcast networks, along with being a syndicator of traditional programming. The deal closed on February 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/hearst-entertainment-litton-acquires-syndication-1201954104/|title=Hearst Acquires Majority Stake in Independent Distributor Litton Entertainment |last=Littleton|first=Cynthia|date=6 January 2017|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television production===

Hearst Television also produces the weekly public-affairs program ''[[Matter of Fact with Soledad O'Brien]]'', which in fall 2018 entered its fourth season. Outside of the Hearst stations and [[A&amp;E (TV network)|A&amp;E]], the show is distributed in national [[broadcast syndication]] by [[Sony Pictures Television]].

Other Notes:
* &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; KCWE in Kansas City has been managed by Hearst since its sign-on in 1996.
* &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; As a result of the [[Spectrum reallocation#Broadcast incentive auction|incentive auction]], WNNE channel shares with WPTZ after the sale of its former spectrum. WNNE previously served [[Hartford, Vermont]] and [[Hanover, New Hampshire]] as a [[semi-satellite]] of WPTZ.
* &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; As a result of the incentive auction, WCWG channel shares with WXII after the sale of its former spectrum. Hearst purchased WCWG outright on February 12, 2018 from former owner [[Lockwood Broadcast Group]], but operated the station under a secondary [[Local marketing agreement|shared services arrangement]] after the channel share went into effect on July 31, 2017.

'''Notes:'''
*&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; WDTN was an ABC affiliate under Hearst during its ownership; LIN switched the station's affiliation back to NBC in 2004.
*&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; WNAC-TV was owned by Argyle, but operated from 1996 to 2001 by [[Clear Channel Communications]] under a local marketing agreement (LMA) with [[WPRI-TV]], which Clear Channel owned at the time.

In addition to the above, Hearst-Argyle never owned WZZM or WGRZ. Those two stations were divested by one of the company's predecessors, Argyle Television Holdings II, several months prior to the merger with Hearst Broadcasting. The "years owned" information reflects the years of ownership by Argyle Television Holdings II. And WDTN was the only formerly owned television station that was owned directly by Hearst prior to the merger.

[[Alexa Internet]].&lt;/ref&gt;  It was originally developed for [[wildfire|wildland fire]] emergencies, but can be also used for other [[emergency]] incidents ([[natural disaster]]s, such as [[earthquake]]s, [[flood]]s, [[hurricane]]s, and [[tornado]]es).&lt;ref&gt;[http://gacc.nifc.gov/admin/about_us/about_us.htm About Us], [[National Interagency Fire Center|National Geographic Area Coordination Center]]s (GACC).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
[[Image:2015 Cajon Pass wildfire (North Fire).jpeg|300px|thumb|right| InciWeb photo of the 2015 [[North Fire]] in California]]
It was developed with two primary missions:

* 1. Provide the public a single source of incident related information 
* 2. Provide a standardized reporting tool for the [[Public relations|Public Affairs]] community&lt;ref&gt;[http://inciweb.nwcg.gov/about/ About this Site]. InciWeb. Retrieved 2009-08-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Official announcements include evacuations, road closures, news releases, maps, photographs, and basic info and current situation about the incident.

Incident information can be accessed by:
* web browser at http://inciweb.nwcg.gov
* [[Twitter]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/inciweb inciweb on Twitter]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[RSS]] web feed

==Technical ==
The original [[Application software|application]] was hosted at the [[United States Forest Service]] - Wildland Fire Training and Conference Center, at [[McClellan Airfield]], [[California]], comprising three [[Server (computing)|server]]s:
*[[Database server]]
*[[Application server|Administrative server]]
*[[Load balancing (computing)|Load balancer]] for the public content which routes traffic to a pool of eight servers.

[[Web traffic]] averages 2 million plus [[Hit (internet)|hits]] daily during the fire season with the ability to handle 3.5 million hits.

The servers were moved to the National information Technology Center (NITC),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ocio.usda.gov/nitc/index.html Enterprise IT Solutions: About NITC]. Office of the Chief Information Officer, [[United States Department of Agriculture]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kansas City, Missouri]] on July 16, 2008, along with the release of version 2.0;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myfirecommunity.net/Neighborhood.aspx?ID=385 Public home page for InciWeb]. MyFireCommunity.Net - Neighborhood. The professional collaboration site for wildland fire practitioners.&lt;/ref&gt; the current version is 2.2.

==Availability issues==
InciWeb was having technical difficulties due to the high volume of Internet users trying to access the site during the September–October 2006 [[Day Fire]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emergencity.com/case-study.shtml Case Study], Emergencity.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Summer 2008 California wildfires]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://westinstenv.org/firetrack/2008/06/28/inciweb-problems-are-bull/ InciWeb Problems Are Bull…].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1472">'''João Carlos Di Genio''' is a [[Brazil]]ian [[physician]] and [[educator]]. He created and is the main owner of the largest educational holding in the country, comprised by the [[Sistema Objetivo]] (primary, secondary and preparatory schools) and the [[Universidade Paulista]] (UNIP), a private university with more than 60 campuses all over Brazil.

Di Genio started his educational career while he was a medical student at the [[University of São Paulo]], in [[São Paulo]] in the 1960s. The mandatory entrance examination to the [[medical school]]s was increasingly tougher and many high school students. The inborn entrepreneurial spirit of di Genio led him to create a one-year preparatory pre-med course, initially in his own home. The success achieved by the course prompted him to establish a formal school, together with three of his colleagues ([[Drauzio Varella]], Tadasi Ito and Roger Patti), which was named ''Curso Pré-Vestibular Nove de Julho''. This later became the Objetivo prep course. Other educational levels were subsequently added.

Kata, a Japanese word, meaning {{Nihongo||[[wikt:型|型]] or [[wikt:形|形]]|literally: "form"}}, is a detailed choreographed pattern of movements made to be practiced alone, but are also practiced within groups and in unison when training. It is practiced as a way to memorize and perfect the movement being executed. There are many professions which use the term Kata, but Kata as a term is known generally by the Martial Arts world, and typically reserved for Japanese empty hand combat systems (Karate -meaning empty hand). Traditional Korean Karate, called (Tang Soo Do) uses the term Kata and some Tang Soo Do schools do not, which is brought on by the memory of the Japanese and Korean war, where in at that time traditional Korean Karate was introduced.

Kata are used in many traditional Japanese arts such as theatre forms like [[kabuki]] and schools of tea ceremony (''[[chadō]]''), but are most commonly known for the presence in the martial arts. Kata are used by most [[Japanese martial arts|Japanese]] and [[Okinawan martial arts]], such as [[aikido]], [[judo]], [[kendo]], [[kempo]], and [[karate]].

== Background ==
Kata originally were teaching and training methods by which successful combat techniques were preserved and passed on. Practicing kata allowed a company of persons to engage in a struggle using a systematic approaches, rather by practicing in a repetitive manner the learner develops the ability to execute those techniques and movements in a natural, reflex-like manner. Systematic practice does not mean permanently rigid. The goal is to internalize the movements and techniques of a kata so they can be executed and adapted under different circumstances, without thought or hesitation. A novice’s actions will look uneven and difficult, while a master’s appear simple and smooth.&lt;ref name="Rosen"&gt;Rosenbaum, Michael. ''Kata and the Transmission of Knowledge in Traditional Martial Arts.'' YMAA Publication Center, Boston, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kata'' is a loanword in English, from the 1950s in reference to the [[judo kata]] due to [[Jigoro Kano]], and from the 1970s also of [[karate kata]]; but the word has come to be used as a generic term for "forms" in martial arts in general, or even figuratively applied to other fields.&lt;ref name="Rother"&gt;{{cite book | title=Toyota Kata: Managing People for Improvement, Adaptiveness, and Super Results | publisher=McGraw Hill Education | author=Rother, Mike | year=2010 | location=New York | pages=15-18 | isbn=978007163523-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Japanese martial arts ==
In Japanese martial arts practice, kata is often seen as an essential partner to ''[[randori]]'' training with one complementing the other.{{cn|date=May 2014}} However, the actual type and frequency of kata versus ''randori'' training varies from art to art.{{cn|date=May 2014}} In [[iaido]], solo kata using the Japanese sword ([[katana]]) comprises almost all of the training.{{cn|date=May 2014}} Whereas in [[judo]], kata training is de-emphasized and usually only prepared for [[dan rank|dan]] grading.{{cn|date=May 2014}}

In [[kenjutsu]], paired kata at the beginners level can appear to be stilted.{{cn|date=May 2014}} At higher levels serious injury is prevented only by a high sensitivity of both participants to important concepts being taught and trained for.{{cn|date=May 2014}} These include timing and distance, with the kata practiced at realistic speed. This adjustability of kata training is found in other Japanese arts with roles of attacker and defender often interchanging within the sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Classical Japanese Warrior Training Methods The Kata|url=https://shinmunenryu.org/2018/02/01/classical-japanese-warrior-training-methods-kata/|website=www.shinmunenryu.org|accessdate=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many martial arts use kata for public demonstrations and in competitions, awarding points for such aspects of technique as style, balance, timing, and verisimilitude (appearance of being real).{{cn|date=May 2014}}

=== Karate ===
{{main|Karate kata}}

The most popular image associated with kata is that of a [[karate]] practitioner performing a series of punches and kicks in the air. The kata are executed as a specified series of approximately 20 to 70 moves, generally with stepping and turning, while attempting to maintain perfect form. There are perhaps 100 kata across the various forms of karate, each with many minor variations. The number of moves in a kata may be referred to in the name of the kata, e.g., ''Gojū Shiho'', which means "54 steps." The number of moves may also have links with Buddhist spirituality. The number 108 is significant in Buddhism &amp; Hinduism, and kata with 54, 36, or 27 moves (divisors of 108) are common. The practitioner is generally counselled to visualize the enemy attacks, and his responses, as actually occurring, and ''karateka'' are often told to "read" a kata, to explain the imagined events. Kata can contain techniques beyond the superficially obvious ones. The study of the meaning of the movements is referred to as the [[bunkai]], meaning analysis, of the kata.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110208012048/http://kata-reference.com/ Karate, Okinawan Kobudo and Kendo Kata videos]&lt;/ref&gt;

One explanation of the use of kata is as a reference guide for a set of moves. Not to be used following that "set" pattern but to keep the movements "filed". After learning these kata, this set of learned skills can then be used in a [[sparring]] scenario (particularly without points). The main objective here is to try out different combinations of techniques in a safe, practice environment to ultimately find out how to defeat your opponent.{{cn|date=May 2014}}

[[File:Hiki-otoshi.jpg|right|210px|thumb|[[Koshiki-no-kata]] by Kano(l) and [[Yamashita Yoshitsugu|Yamashita]](r)]]

Recently, with the spread of Extreme Martial arts or XMA, a style of kata called CMX kata has formed.{{cn|date=May 2014}} These kata are performed in tournaments and include gymnastics related elements, such as backflips, cartwheels, and splits.{{cn|date=May 2014}} These kata can also be performed with weapons such as the Bo staff.{{cn|date=May 2014}}

=== Judo ===
{{main|Judo kata}}
[[Judo]] has several kata, mostly created in the late 19th century by [[Kano Jigoro]], the founder of judo. The judo kata involve two participants. Judo kata preserve a number of techniques that are not permitted in competition or in ''randori'', including punches, kicks, and the use of the [[katana]] and other weapons. The study of kata is usually begun typically at around the green belt level. The most commonly studied judo kata is [[Nage-no-kata]], which consists of fifteen throwing techniques. The [[Katame-no-kata]] is composed of pinning techniques, chokes, and joint locks. [[Kime-no-kata]] is a long kata consisting of self-defense techniques against both unarmed attacks, and attacks with swords and knives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.judoinfo.com/katamenu.htm|title=Forms of Judo: Kata – Judo Info|website=www.judoinfo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.judo-snijders.nl/engels/video-kata-judo.html|title=Kata, nage, karame, gonosen, itsutsu, kime, no, video, movie, film, armlock, judo, Judoschool Jan Snijders, Oirschot, Bladel, Deurne, Gemert|first=|last=R.GROULS@WXS.NL|website=www.judo-snijders.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-Japanese martial arts ==
While the Japanese term is most well known in the English language, forms are by no means exclusive to Japan. They have been recorded in [[China]] as early as the [[Tang dynasty]], and are referred to in Mandarin as ''[[Taolu (martial arts)|taolu]]''.{{cn|date=May 2014}}

South and [[Indochinese martial arts|Southeast Asian martial arts]] incorporate both preset and freestyle forms. In [[silat]] these are referred to as ''jurus'' and ''tari'' respectively. Malay folklore credits the introduction of forms to the Buddhist monk [[Bodhidharma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Silat Tua: The Malay Dance Of Life |author=Zainal Abidin Shaikh Awab and Nigel Sutton |year=2006 |publisher=Azlan Ghanie Sdn Bhd |location=Kuala Lumpur |isbn=978-983-42328-0-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[:Category:Korean martial arts|Korean martial arts]] such as [[taekwondo]] and [[Tang Soo Do]], the word ''[[hyung]]'' or ''hyeong'' is usually employed, though in some cases other words are used.{{cn|date=May 2014}} The [[International Taekwon-Do Federation]] uses the word ''[[Hyung|tul]]'', while the [[World Taekwondo Federation]] uses the word ''poomsae'' or simply the English translations "[[pattern]]" or "form."{{cn|date=May 2014}} Taekwondo patterns have multiple variations including ''Palgwe'' and the more popular ''Taeguk'' forms used by the WTF. Forms are included in certain taekwondo competitions and are a key element of gradings.{{cn|date=May 2014}}

In [[Sanskrit]], forms are known either as ''yudhan'' (combat form) or ''pentra'' (tactical deployment).{{cn|date=May 2014}} Other [[Asian martial arts]] refer to forms by various terms specific to their respective languages, such as the Burmese word ''[[aka (Burmese)|aka]]'', the Vietnamese ''quyen'' and the Kashmiri ''khawankay''.{{cn|date=May 2014}}

In the [[Historical European martial arts]] and their modern reconstructions, forms are referred to as plays, drills or flourishes.{{cn|date=May 2014}}

== Outside martial arts ==
{{other uses}}
More recently [[:wikt:kata#English|kata]] has come to be used in English in a more general or figurative sense,  referring  to any basic form, routine, or pattern of behavior that is practiced to various levels of mastery.&lt;ref&gt;Shook, John. ''Managing to Learn.'' Lean Enterprise Institute, 2008, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japanese language ''kata'' (though written as 方) is a frequently-used suffix meaning “way of doing,” with emphasis on the form and order of the process.  Other meanings are “training method” and “formal exercise.”  The goal of a painter’s practicing, for example, is to merge his consciousness with his brush; the potter’s with his clay; the garden designer’s with the materials of the garden.  Once such mastery is achieved, the theory goes, the doing of a thing perfectly is as easy as thinking it.&lt;ref&gt;DeMenthe, Boye Lafayette. ''Kata, The Key to Understanding and Dealing with the Japanese!'' Tuttle Publishing, 2003, pp. 1–3&lt;/ref&gt;

Kata is a term used by some programmers in the Software Craftsmanship&lt;ref&gt;[[Software craftsmanship|The Software Craftsmanship Movement]]&lt;/ref&gt; movement. Computer programmers who call themselves "Software Craftsmen"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.8thlight.com/micah-martin/2013/05/28/performing-code-katas.html|title=Performing Code Katas - 8th Light|website=8thlight.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; will write 'Kata'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/unclebobconsultingllc/home/articles/what-s-all-this-nonsense-about-katas|title=What's all this Nonsense about Katas? - Clean Coder|website=sites.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; - small snippets of code that they write in one sitting, sometimes repeatedly,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://codekata.com/kata/codekata-how-it-started/|title=CodeKata: How It Started - CodeKata|first=Dave Thomas|last=(@PragDave)|website=codekata.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; often daily, in order to build muscle memory and practise their craft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/unclebobconsultingllc/home/articles/what-s-all-this-nonsense-about-katas|title=What's all this Nonsense about Katas? - Clean Coder|website=sites.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the things that characterize an organization’s culture is its kata – its routines of thinking and practice.&lt;ref&gt;Ichijo, Kazuo and Nonaka, Ikujiro, Knowledge Creation and Management:  New Challenges for Managers, Oxford University Press, 2006, page 25&lt;/ref&gt;  Edgar Schein suggests an organization's culture helps it cope with its environment,&lt;ref&gt;Schein, Edgar. ''Organizational Culture and Leadership: A Dynamic View.'' Jossey-Bass, 1985, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; and one meaning of ''kata'' is, "a way to keep two things in sync or harmony with one another." A task for leaders and managers is to create and maintain the organizational culture through consistent role modeling, teaching, and coaching, which is in many ways analogous to how kata are taught in the martial arts.

'''Liquidated damages''' (also referred to as liquidated and ascertained damages) are damages whose amount the parties designate during the formation of a [[contracts|contract]]&lt;ref name= Liquidated&gt;{{Cite web |  url = http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Liquidated+damages | title = Liquidated Damages  | format = w | accessdate = 2012-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for the injured party to collect as compensation upon a specific breach (e.g., late performance).&lt;ref name= "Liquidated" /&gt;

When damages are not predetermined/assessed in advance, then the amount recoverable is said to be 'at large' (to be agreed or determined by a court or tribunal in the event of breach).

Generally, at [[common law]], a liquidated damages clause will not be enforced if its purpose is to punish the wrongdoer/party in breach rather than to compensate the injured party&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII |court=UKHL |year=1914 |num=1 |litigants=Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v New Garage &amp; Motor Co Ltd |parallelcite=[1915] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 79}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Amev-Udc"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|63|1986|litigants=Amev-Udc Finance Ltd v Austin |parallelcite=(1986) 162 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 170 |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Plessnig "&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|7|1989|litigants=Esanda Finance Corp v Plessnig  |parallelcite=(1989) 166 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 131 |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (in which case it is referred to as a [[penal damages|penal or penalty clause]]).&lt;ref name= "Liquidated damages, penalties and the Just Compensation rule: Some notes on an enforcement model and a theory of efficient breach" &gt;{{Cite journal |  url = https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1121823?uid=3738776&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21100860664611 | title = Liquidated damages, penalties and the Just Compensation rule: Some notes on an enforcement model and a theory of efficient breach | journal = Columbia Law Review  | volume = 77 | format = w  | accessdate = 2012-12-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One reason for this is that the enforcement of the term would, in effect, require an equitable order of [[specific performance]]. However, courts sitting in [[Equity (law)|equity]] will seek to achieve a fair result and will not enforce a term that will lead to the [[unjust enrichment]] of the enforcing party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |  url = http://law.jrank.org/pages/8310/Liquidated-Damages.html | title = Liquidated Damages  | journal = American Law Encyclopedia  | volume = 6  | format = w  | accessdate = 2009-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order for a liquidated damages clause to be upheld, two conditions must be met. 
* First, the amount of the damages identified must roughly approximate the damages likely to fall upon the party seeking the benefit of the term.&lt;ref name= "Liquidated damages, penalties and the Just Compensation rule: Some notes on an enforcement model and a theory of efficient breach" /&gt;
* Second, the damages must be sufficiently uncertain at the time the contract is made that such a clause will likely save both parties the future difficulty of estimating damages.
Damages that are sufficiently uncertain may be referred to as '''unliquidated damages''', and may be so categorized because they are not mathematically calculable or are subject to a [[contingent liability|contingency]] which makes the amount of damages uncertain.

===Example===
For example, suppose Neal Townsend agrees to lease a store-front to Richard Smith, from which Richard intends to sell jewellery. If Townsend breaches the contract by refusing to lease the store-front at the appointed time, it will be difficult to determine what profits Smith will have lost because the success of newly created small businesses is highly uncertain. This, therefore, would be an appropriate circumstance for Smith to insist upon a liquidated damages clause in case Townsend fails to perform.

In the case of construction contracts, courts have occasionally refused to enforce liquidated damages provisions, choosing to follow the [[doctrine of concurrent delay]] when both parties have contributed to the overall delay of the project.

Contracts in the [[NEC Engineering and Construction Contract|NEC3]] family use the term 'low service damages' (optional clause X.17) and generally include a Low Service Damages Schedule.&lt;ref&gt;[[Institute of Workplace and Facilities Management|British Institute of Facilities Management]], Getting Started with the NEC3 Term Services Contract, accessed 23 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===The definition and scope extended===
In Australia, the definition of liquidated damages applies to the situations where upon the failure of a primary stipulation, imposes a detriment to the first party or a benefit to the second party by a secondary stipulation collateral to the primary stipulation (i.e. it does not have to be a breach).&lt;ref name="Andrews"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|30|2012|litigants=Andrews v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited |parallelcite= }}.  {{cite web|url=http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/publications/judgment-summaries/2012/hca30-2012-09-06.pdf |title=judgment summary |publisher=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]] (Australia) |date=6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The law applied to bank and credit card charges===
UK bank and credit card customers were being charged as much as £39 for a single transaction that took them over their credit limit. Consumers argued these charges were well beyond the cost of sending a computerised letter.

In 2007 the [[Office of Fair Trading]] investigated the charges being imposed on customers of credit card companies. In its report, the OFT claimed these charges were unlawful under UK law as they amounted to a penalty. It said it would be prepared to investigate any charge over £12, though this was not intended to indicate that £12 is a fair and acceptable charge. The OFT said it would be up to a court to determine such an amount based on the established legal precedent that the only recoverable cost would be actual costs incurred.

The credit card companies did not produce evidence of their actual costs to the OFT, instead insisting their charges are in line with clear policy and information provided to customers.

Receipt of liquidated damages and intimately linked with the purpose of the profit-making apparatus, is a capital receipt. The amount received by the assessee towards compensation for seterilization of the profit earning source is not in the ordinary course of business. Hence, it is a capital receipt in the hands of the assessee.

In 2009 the Supreme Court ruled (''see [[Office of Fair Trading v Abbey National plc]]'') that terms in bank account contracts were not capable of being penal, bar those applicable to NatWest Bank customers between 2001 and 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oft.gov.uk/news/press/2008/55-08 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123082125/http://oft.gov.uk/news/press/2008/55-08 |archivedate=2009-01-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The court ruled that the charges were a charge for a service, and not a penalty for damages for breaching a contract term.

===Bank Fees===

In 2012, the High Court of Australia allowed an appeal against findings of the Federal Court of Australia that 'exception fees' imposed by the ANZ Bank could not constitute an unenforceable penalty. The High Court found that fees were not incapable of being characterised as penalties merely because they were not charged upon breach of contract.&lt;ref name="Andrews"/&gt;

Conversely, in 2014, the federal court (Gordon J) described $35 late payment fees by ANZ Banking Group to customers who failed to make their monthly minimum credit card repayment as being “extravagant, exorbitant and unconscionable” and ordered for these fees to be reimbursed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|FCA|35|2014|litigants=Paciocco v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited |parallelcite= |courtname=auto |date=5 February 2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ANZ appealed.

In 2015, the full court  overturned Justice Gordon’s first instance judgment that credit card late payment fees charged by ANZ to its customers constituted penalties at law and equity (and were therefore largely unenforceable).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|FCAFC|78|2015|litigants=Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited v Paciocco |parallelcite= |courtname=auto |date=5 June 2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The decision otherwise upholds Justice Gordon's findings that honour, dishonour and overlimit fees charged by ANZ were not penalties, unconscionable or unfair. While the decision is very fact specific, it represented a major setback for other class actions based on penalties. Paciocco appealed to the High Court.

The last chapter of the bank fees saga took place in July 2016 where the High Court dismissed the appeal for leave and held that the full court was correct to characterise the loss provision costs, regulatory capital costs and collection costs as affecting the legitimate interests of the Bank.&lt;ref name="Paccioco"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|28|2016|litigants=Paccioco v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited |parallelcite= }} {{cite web|url=http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/publications/judgment-summaries/2016/hca-28-2016-07-27.pdf |title=judgment summary |publisher=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]] (Australia) |date=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court asserted that the fact that those categories of costs could not be recovered in an action for damages did not alter that conclusion. Further, neither the fact that the late payment fees were not genuine pre-estimates of damage nor the fact that the amounts charged were disproportionate to the actual loss suffered by itself rendered the late payment fees penalties. [http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/publications/judgment-summaries/2016/hca-28-2016-07-27.pdf High Court]

==Uniform Commercial Code==

In the United States, Section 2-718(1) of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] provides that, in contracts for the sale of goods:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=§ 2-718. Liquidation or Limitation of Damages; Deposits.|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/2-718|publisher=Legal Information Institute|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Damages for breach by either party may be liquidated in the agreement but only at an amount which is reasonable in the light of the anticipated or actual harm caused by the breach, the difficulties of proof of loss, and the inconvenience or nonfeasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy. A term fixing unreasonably large liquidated damages is void as a penalty.

This largely mirrors the common law rule, which applies to other types of contracts under the law of most US states.

==Other legal systems==

===Civil law===

[[Civil law (legal system)|Civil law]] systems generally impose less severe restrictions on liquidated damages. For example, Article 1226 of the [[French Civil Code]] provides for ''clause pénale'', a variant of liquidated damages which combines compensatory and coercive elements. Judges may adjust excessive contract penalties, but such clauses are not generally void as a matter of French law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clarke|first1=Joanne|title="Clause pénale" v. liquidated damages – any similarities?|url=http://kluwerconstructionblog.com/2010/02/24/%E2%80%9Cclause-penale%E2%80%9D-v-liquidated-damages-any-similarities/|website=Kluwer Construction Blog|accessdate=17 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402121351/http://kluwerconstructionblog.com/2010/02/24/%E2%80%9Cclause-penale%E2%80%9D-v-liquidated-damages-any-similarities/|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 420-1 of the [[Civil Code of Japan]] provides an even firmer basis to uphold contractual penalties:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Civil Code|url=http://www.moj.go.jp/content/000056024.pdf|publisher=Ministry of Justice (Japan)|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The parties may agree on the amount of the liquidated damages with respect to the failure to perform the obligation. In such case, the court may not increase or decrease the amount thereof.
# The liquidated damages shall not preclude the demand for performance or the exercise of the cancellation right.
# Any penalty is presumed to constitute liquidated damages.

In the U.S. state of [[Louisiana]], which follows a civil law system, liquidated damages are referred to as "stipulated damages".&lt;ref&gt;[[Louisiana Civil Code]], Article 2005: Parties may stipulate the damages to be recovered in case of nonperformance, defective performance, or delay in performance of an obligation. http://legis.la.gov/Legis/LawSearchList.aspx accessed 23 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to 1 January 1985, Louisiana law used the term “penal clause” under former article 2117 of the [[Louisiana Civil Code|Civil Code]].&lt;ref&gt;Louisiana Court of Appeal, Second Circuit, Mary Mobley v. Gary Mobley, No. 37,364-CA {{cite web |url=http://www.lex.uniba.it/ta/clausola%20penale%20louisiana%20court%20of%20appeal.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623073715/http://www.lex.uniba.it/ta/clausola%20penale%20louisiana%20court%20of%20appeal.pdf |archivedate=2015-06-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stipulated damages create a secondary obligation for the purpose of enforcing the principal obligation. The aggrieved party may demand either the stipulated damages or performance of the principal obligation, but may not demand both except for delay.&lt;ref&gt;Louisiana Civil Code, Article 2007 http://legis.la.gov/Legis/Law.aspx?d=109263 accessed 23 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Stipulated damages may not be modified by the court (and will therefore be enforced) "unless they are so manifestly unreasonable as to be contrary to public policy".&lt;ref&gt;Louisiana Civil Code, Article 2012 http://legis.la.gov/Legis/Law.aspx?d=109269 accessed 23 June 2015.

===Islamic law===

[[Islamic law]] prohibits ''[[gharar]]'' (uncertainty) in contracts, and liquidated damages provisions are a favored mechanism to overcome uncertainty regarding contractual damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Islamic Contract Law|url=http://www.saudilegal.com/saudilaw/02_law.html|website=Saudilegal|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the founder of [[Janssen Pharmaceutica]], a pharmaceutical company with over 20,000 employees.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Lewi, Obituary of Dr Paul Janssen (1926–2003), Drug Discovery Today, Volume 9, Issue 10, 15 May 2004, Pages 432–433&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birth and education==
Paul Janssen was the son of [[Constant Janssen]] and Margriet Fleerackers. On 16 April 1957, he married Dora Arts.

He attended secondary school at the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] St Jozef college in Turnhout, after which he decided to follow in his father's footsteps and become a doctor. During World War II, Janssen studied physics, biology and chemistry at the [[Facultés universitaires Notre-Dame de la Paix]] (FUNDP) in [[Namur (city)|Namur]]. He then studied medicine at the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|Catholic University of Leuven]] and the [[University of Ghent]]. In 1951, Janssen graduated in medicine from the University of Ghent.

==Career==
During his military service, he worked at the [[University of Cologne]] in Germany at the Institute of Pharmacology of J. Schuller, where he worked until 1952. After he returned to Belgium he worked part-time at the Institute of Pharmacology and Therapeutics (University of Ghent) of Professor [[Corneille Heymans]], who had won the [[Nobel Prize]] for medicine in 1938. Janssen founded his own research laboratory in 1953, with a loan of 50,000 Belgian [[francs]] from his father. In 1953 he also discovered his first drug [[ambucetamide]], an [[antispasmodic]] found to be particularly effective for the relief of [[menstrual]] pain.&lt;ref&gt;I. Oransky, Paul Janssen, The Lancet, Volume 363, Issue 9404, Pages 251–251&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Beerse Statue Paul Janssen 070225.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Statue of Dr. Paul Janssen in [[Beerse]], Belgium]]In 1956, Janssen received his teaching certificate for higher education in pharmacology (the [[habilitation]] and the official ''pro venia legendi'' (Latin, ''for permission to lecture'')) with a thesis on ''Compounds of the R 79 type''. He then left the university and in 1956 established the company which would become ''Janssen Pharmaceutica''. On 11 February 1958 he made [[haloperidol]] a major breakthrough in the treatment of [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref&gt;B. Granger, S.

Janssen and the scientists at [[Janssen Pharmaceutica]] discovered more than 80 new medicines. Four of his medicines are on the [[WHO list of essential medicines]]; this is an absolute world record. The majority of the drugs he and his teams developed were for human medicine and are being used to treat infestations by fungi and worms, [[mental illnesses]], [[cardiovascular]] diseases, [[allergy|allergies]], and [[gastrointestinal disorder]]s.

&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;'''Process performance qualification protocol''' is a component of [[process validation]]: [[process qualification]]. This step is vital in maintaining ongoing production quality by recording and having available for review essential conditions, &lt;u&gt;controls, testing, and expected manufacturing outcome&lt;/u&gt; of a production process. The [[Food and Drug Administration]] recommends the following criteria be included in a PPQ protocol:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Guidance for Industry Process Validation: General Principles and Practices|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/Guidances/UCM070336.pdf|publisher=Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Manufacturing conditions: Operating parameters, equipment limits, and component inputs
*What data should be recorded and analyzed
*What tests should be performed to ensure quality at each production step
*A sampling plan to outline sampling methods both during and between production batches
*Analysis methodology that allows for data scientific and risk oriented decision making based on statistical data. Variability limits should be defined and contingencies in the event of non-conforming data established
*Approval of PPQ protocol from relevant departments
Deviations from the standard operation procedures should be made within the framework of the protocol and at the approval of relevant [[quality control]] departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Process Performance Qualification|url=http://www.atris-systems.com/222.0.html|publisher=Atris Information Systems|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protocol should cover all aspects of production including: equipment, personnel, raw materials, and operating environment. The FDA further recommends a documentation of the protocol be published internally. The report should include:
*A summation of relevant data and analysis from the protocol
*An explanation of unexpected data and any other results not mandated by the protocol and its effects on production quality
*Identify correlating effects and suggest changes to existing processes
*Conclude if the process performance is adequately qualified to meet performance standards. Should production standards not be met appropriate changes should be outlined

'''Ricardo Semler''' (born 1959 in [[São Paulo]]) is the [[CEO]] and majority owner of [[Semco Partners]], a [[Brazil]]ian company best known for its radical form of [[industrial democracy]] and corporate re-engineering.&lt;ref&gt;Wherrett, Rob ''The Compleat Biz'' (2009) Reroq Publishing {{ISBN|978-0-9561305-0-1}}, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; Under his ownership, revenue has grown from 4 million US dollars in 1982 to 212 million US dollars in 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vogl|first=A.J.|date=May 2004|title=The Anti-CEO|url=|journal=Across the Board|volume=41| issue =  3|pages=30–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his innovative business [[management]] policies have attracted widespread interest around the world. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' featured him among its Global 100 young leaders profile series published in 1994 while the [[World Economic Forum]] also nominated him. ''The Wall Street Journal'' ''America Economia'', [[The Wall Street Journal]]'s [[Latin America]]n magazine, named him Latin American businessman of the year in 1990 and he was named Brazilian businessman of the year in 1990 and 1992. ''Virando a Própria Mesa'' ("Turning the Table on Yourself"), his first book, became the best selling [[non-fiction]] book in the history of [[Brazil]]. He has since written two books in English on the transformation of Semco and workplace re-engineering: ''[[Maverick (book)|Maverick]]'', an English version of "Turning Your Own Table" published in 1993 and an international bestseller, and ''[[The Seven-Day Weekend]]'' in 2003.

==Semco 1980–1990==
Semler went to work for his father's company, originally called Semler &amp; Company, then a mixer and agitator supplier in [[São Paulo]]. Semler clashed with his father, Antonio Semler, who supported a traditional autocratic style of management whereas young Semler favoured a decentralised, participatory style. Furthermore, Ricardo favoured diversification away from the struggling shipbuilding industry, which his father opposed.

After heated clashes, the son threatened to leave the company. Rather than see this happen, Antonio Semler resigned as CEO and vested majority ownership in his son in 1980 when Ricardo was 21 years old. On his first day as CEO, Ricardo Semler fired sixty percent of all top managers.  He began work on a diversification program to rescue the company. Semler experienced health issues, culminating in a [[fainting]] spell at a pump factory ([[Baldwinsville, New York|Baldwinsville]], New York) when he was 25. After seeing a doctor at the [[Lahey Clinic]] (Boston), he was diagnosed with an advanced case of stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Maverick! : The Success Story Behind the World's Most Unusual Workplace|last=Semler|first=Ricardo |publisher=Arrow edition|year=1994|isbn=0099329417|location=London|pages=54–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; This inspired him to want a greater [[work-life balance]] for himself and his employees.

Attempts to introduce a [[Matrix management|matrix organisational structure]] in 1986 failed to achieve desired improvements.&lt;ref name="semler1993p108"&gt;{{cite book | last = Semler | first = Ricardo | title = Maverick! | origyear = 1993 | year = 1994 | publisher = Arrow | location = London | isbn = 0-09-932941-7 | chapter = 14 Too big for our own good | page = 108}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--[[Delaware]]-based consultancy [[W. L. Gore]]'s lattice structure&lt;ref&gt;Semler 1993, op. cit., p.114&lt;/ref&gt; was adopted in 1985 with six to ten workers placed in charge of particular tasks – with a sense of ownership and financial responsibility alike – proved to be very successful as productivity rose and costs fell. While a third of middle managers left between 1985 and 1987, the system became popular with the workers as they received 25 per cent of the profits, allowing many to double or triple their wages with bonuses distributed by a democratically-elected committee.--&gt;

In the late 1980s, three engineers at Semco proposed setting up a Nucleus of Technological Innovation (NTI) to develop new businesses and product lines which Semler endorsed. At the end of the first six months, NTI had identified 18 such opportunities. Following the success of this initiative, satellite units were encouraged throughout Semco. By the late 1980s, these satellite units accounted for two-thirds of its new products and two-thirds of its employees.

An assessment of Semler's business philosophy through phenomenological analysis (within the radical change of Semco's management style), led Bombała to conclude that it was an ''"...excellent exemplification of good leadership."''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bombała|first=Bronisław|date=January 2014|title=Phenomenology as the epistemological and methodological basis of management sciences|url=|journal=Contemporary Management Quarterly / Wspólczesne Zarzadzanie|volume=13| issue =  1|pages=150–172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eleanor Glor notes that the only accounts about the change in management style come from Ricardo Semler himself, rather than from the affected workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Glor|first=Eleanor D.|date=2005|title=About empowerment|url=http://www.innovation.cc/discussion-papers/glor_about_empowerment7v10i1a9.pdf|journal=The Innovation Journal: The Public Sector Innovation Journal|volume=10| issue = 1|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Semco 1990–2004==
After dramatic restrictions on [[market liquidity|liquidity]] instituted by Brazilian president [[Fernando Collor de Mello]] to combat [[hyperinflation]] in 1990, the [[Economy of Brazil|Brazilian economy]] went into a severe downturn, forcing many companies to declare [[bankruptcy]]. Workers at Semco agreed to wage cuts, providing their share of profits was increased to 39%, management salaries were cut by 40% and employees were given the right to approve every item of expenditure.

Performing multiple roles during the crisis gave workers greater knowledge of the operations and more suggestions on how to improve the business. Reforms implemented during that time led to 65% reduction in inventories, a marked reduction in product delivery times and a product defects rate that fell to less than 1%. As the business climate improved, Semco's revenues and profitability improved dramatically.

{{As of|2003}}, Semco had annual revenue of $212 million, up from $4 million in 1982 and $35 million in 1994, with an annual growth rate of up to 40 percent a year. It employed 3,000 workers in 2003, as opposed to 90 in 1982. The company's units include:
* the industrial machinery unit, which now manufactures mixing equipment as opposed to pumps
* Sembobac, a partnership with [[Baltimore Air Cooler]] making cooling towers
* Cushman and Wakefield Semco, a partnership with [[Rockefeller]] property company [[Cushman and Wakefield]] managing properties in [[Brazil]] and [[Latin America]]
* Semco Johnson Controls, a partnership with [[Johnson Controls]], managing large scale facilities such as airports and hospitals
* ERM, a partnership with [[Environmental Resources Management]], one of the world's leading environmental consultants
* Semco Ventures, offering high technology and Internet services
* SemcoHR, a human resources management firm
* Semco-RGIS, an inventory control firm

As Semco grew, Ricardo Semler received a great deal of recognition. He was named Brazilian businessman of the year in 1990 and in 1992, and the [[World Economic Forum]] named him as one of the Global Leaders of Tomorrow. A high-profile committee appointed by ''[[CIO Magazine]]'' featuring [[Tom Peters]], [[Jim Champy]] and Michael Hammer selected Semco as one of the most successfully re-engineered companies in the world. The [[BBC]] included Semco in its series on ''Reengineering the Business'' for creating one of the most successful management structures in business.

== Other activities ==
Semler has reduced his involvement in Semco in the past decade to pursue other activities. He wrote a book ''[[Maverick (book)|Maverick]]'' on his experience at Semco which became a worldwide bestseller in 1993.

His second book, ''[[The Seven-Day Weekend (book)|The Seven-Day Weekend: Changing the Way Work Works]]'' was published in 2003.

He has appeared in the media around the world and speaks regularly to business schools, businesses and groups to promote his philosophy of industrial democracy. He has also been a visiting scholar at [[Harvard Business School]].&lt;ref name="Boston"&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2004/05/09/an_iconoclasts_ideas_for_redefining_management | title = An Iconoclast’s Ideas for Redefining Management | work = The Boston Globe | first = Robert | last = Weisman | date = 9 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Semler has been Vice President of the Federation of Industries of Brazil and a member of [[SOS Atlantic Forest]], the leading environmental defence organisation in Brazil. He founded The Ralston-Semler Foundation and the Lumiar School, a [[democratic school]] where children from 0 to 14 years old engage in projects of their interest. There are three such schools — one in the city of São Paulo and two in the vicinity of Campos do Jordão, in the state of São Paulo.

=== Semler principles institutions ===
As of late 2016, Semler was involved in the foundation of other ventures which intends to teach other entrepreneurs and businesspeople how to implement a people-centric management in their companies called [https://semcostyle.org/ Semco Style Institute] where people are formed to find the right way to apply Semler's principles, and [http://www.leadwise.co/?partner= Leadwise] where people learn via online courses about all the people based management styles available (Including Semler's principles described in his book [[Maverick (book)|Maverick]], [[Holacracy]], [http://www.reinventingorganizationswiki.com/Main_Page Teal Organizations], etc), they also analyze success cases of companies from different industries and countries where this kind of methodology was applied.

A '''self-regulatory organization''' ('''SRO''') is an organization that exercises some degree of regulatory authority over an industry or profession. The regulatory authority could exist in place of government regulation, or applied in addition to government regulation.  The ability of an SRO to exercise regulatory authority does not necessarily derive from a grant of authority from the government.

In United States securities law, a self-regulatory organization is a defined term. The principal federal regulatory authority—the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC)—was established by the Federal [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]].  The SEC originally delegated authority to the [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority|Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)]] and to the [[List of stock exchanges#United States of America|national stock exchanges]] (e.g., the [[New York Stock Exchange|NYSE]]) to enforce certain industry standards and requirements related to securities trading and brokerage. On July 26, 2007 the SEC approved a merger of the enforcement arms of the NYSE and the NASD, to form a new SRO, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).  In addition, Congress created the [[Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board]] (MSRB) as an SRO charged with adopting investor protection rules governing broker-dealers and banks that underwrite, trade and sell tax-exempt bonds, 529 college savings plans and other types of municipal securities.

The [[American Arbitration Association]] is also an SRO with official, statutory status.

Because of the prominence of the SROs in the securities industry, the term SRO is often used too narrowly to describe an organization authorized by statute or government agency to exercise control over a certain aspect of the industry.

The [[National Association of Realtors]] (NAR) is an example of an SRO that fills the vacuum left by the absence of government oversight or regulation.  The NAR sets the rules for [[multiple listing service]]s and how brokers use them.  Another example is the [[American Medical Association]] which sets rules for ethics, conflicts, disciplinary action, and accreditation in medicine.

She was also one of the most prominent investors in the field of real estate, in the banking and industry and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.kuwaittimes.net/website/amiri-diwan-mourns-suad-al-humaidhi/ Amiri Diwan mourns Suad Al-Humaidhi]&lt;/ref&gt;

She worked at the beginning of her career at [[Commercial Bank of Kuwait|Commercial Bank]], founded by her father, Hamad Al-Humaidhi, for 10 years. And then headed the management of her father's institution, trade and investments after his death: "Suad Hamad Saled Al Homaizi Establishment"&lt;ref&gt;[https://marcopolis.net/sheikha-suad-al-humaidhi.htm Sheikha Suad Al Humaidhi]&lt;/ref&gt;. At that stage, her husband Sheikh Jaber Al-Ali Al-Salem Al-Sabah, former Minister of Information, supported and encouraged her. He described her as having the wisdom and the comprehensive knowledge of the various issues."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalkuwait.com/forum/index.php?threads/2708/ سعاد الحميضي في مشوار العمر: أحب الأناقة منذ طفولتيي .. وجلسات الضحى لا تجذبني] {{ar icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Souad Al-Humaidhi's career in the private sector was not easy, especially in the beginning because she was the first Kuwaiti woman to do business. She says she has faced many difficulties and challenges, including, for example, the Kuwaiti society's view at the time of women's work. But overcame it with self-confidence, self-respect and dedication to work. Success has been its ally in the business, expanding its investments and diversifying and spreading from Kuwait to many Arab countries, especially Lebanon. [[Rafic Hariri]] respected her because she adheres to honesty in treatment. She also built mosques and helped those in need.&lt;ref&gt;[https://alqabas.com/422607/ الكويت تفقد سعاد الحميضي] {{ar icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wealthx.com/dossier/suad-hamad-saleh-al-homaizi/ Suad Hamad Saleh Al Homaizi]&lt;/ref&gt; She died on 3 August 2017 at the age of 78.

The '''United Retail Federation''' was an industrial organisation of employers and one of [[Australia]]'s oldest. It traces its origins to Grocers Associations in 1887. As one of the nation’s oldest industry bodies it had exercised an influence on Australian Governments and public policy since [[federation]].

==History==

The origins of United Retail Federation can be traced back to a meeting held 29 June 1887 at which it was proposed to establish a [[Grocers Association]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unitedretailfederation.com.au/about_us/history&lt;/ref&gt; By August of the same year the Brisbane Grocers Association had established offices in the [[Hunter's Treasury Buildings]] in [[George Street, Brisbane|George Street]], [[Brisbane]]. The Committee were meeting regularly every 3rd Tuesday of the month and employed a Secretary to manage the affairs of the 'subscribers'.

The Association grew quickly and by November 1889 had become the Brisbane Traders Association - a name change brought about by the growing diversity of its 'subscribers'. The Annual Report of 17 October 1898 shows 274 names on the members roll. Prominent traders on the list of members included [[Allan &amp; Stark]], [[Thomas Beirne (businessman)|T.C. Beirne]] and [[Overell &amp; Coy]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unitedretailfederation.com.au/about_us/history&lt;/ref&gt;

==1900 - 1940==

In July 1901 the Association moved to new offices in the Darragh's Building in Queen Street. By this time reports of the quarterly meetings were being printed in the [[The Courier-Mail|Courier Mail]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unitedretailfederation.com.au/about_us/history&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910 The [[Brisbane Trader's Association]] Annual Report shows several affiliated bodies covering a total of 215 firms in addition to the normal membership.

They were:-
* The Brisbane Grocers (84 firms)
* The Brisbane Drapers (15 firms)
* The Master Butchers (42 firms)
* The Brisbane Tobacconists (47 firms)

The first issue of "The Queensland Grocer" was printed in January 1923. By this time the Association had moved to larger premises in Commerce House Adelaide Street.

The first meeting of the [[Queensland Grocers Association]] took place in the rooms of the Brisbane Traders Association on 16 July 1924 and was attended by representatives of the Brisbane Grocers Association and the Brisbane &amp; Suburban Shopkeepers Association who, while still operating as independent bodies, formed the nucleus of the QGA.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unitedretailfederation.com.au/about_us/history&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1925, the Queensland Grocers Association affiliated with the [[Federation of Retail Grocers Associations of Australia]].

In 1933, the Brisbane &amp; Suburban Shopkeepers Association became the Queensland Shopkeepers Association. On 8 November 1933 "The Queensland Retailer" was first published - as a result of a name change from "The Queensland Grocer" to better reflect the growing diversity of membership. This title is still going strong today, as our monthly magazine (now known as the "Australian Retailer") which is now distributed across the country.

==1940 - 1970==

At an Extraordinary General Meeting of the members of the Queensland Grocers Association held at the registered offices, 3rd Floor, Commerce House, Adelaide Street on Thursday 10 December 1942, the resolution to change the name from Queensland Grocers Association to Queensland Grocers and Retail Traders Association was unanimously adopted.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unitedretailfederation.com.au/about_us/history&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[second World War]] the Association was an integral part of the war effort and involved on many committees covering every aspect that may have affected retail e.g. Rationing, blackouts, manpower, regulated pricing. It was in 1943 during the depths of war that the first State Conference was held in Rockhampton. That conference went on to become known as GREATA, and continued for over 50 years, until 1996.

The Association's name was changed once again in April 1954 to "[[The Queensland Retail Traders Association]] (of Grocers, Drapers and General Stores)".

==Modern Times==

On 26 January 1974 the Association offices at Buchanan St, West End were flooded in the [[1974 Brisbane Flood]]. Many of the records were water damaged, and the Federation still has the plaque showing the level of water which swept through the building - 5 feet high.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unitedretailfederation.com.au/about_us/history&lt;/ref&gt;

May 1975 "The Queensland Shopkeeper" and the "Retailer of Queensland" merged to become the official journal for both the Queensland Shopkeepers Association and the Queensland Retail Traders Association.

On 31 January 1978, the Queensland Retail Traders Association and the Queensland Shopkeepers Association merged to become the [[Queensland Retail Traders and Shopkeepers Association]].

In June 1987, QRTSA celebrated its Centenary - as part of this celebration, the Association moved offices to its current location.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unitedretailfederation.com.au/about_us/history&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 the organisation re-branded as the United Retail Federation to reflect the membership having spread across all states of Australia and the scope of activities of the organisation being on a truly national basis. The official website of the United Retail Federation states that throughout its history its objective has been to protect and advocate for independent retailers, lobby all levels of government on their behalf and help them in their day-to-day business operations as much as possible.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unitedretailfederation.com.au/about_us/history&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation was wound up in 2015. &lt;ref&gt;https://insolvencynotices.asic.gov.au/browsesearch-notices/notice-details/QUEENSLAND-RETAIL-TRADERS-AND-SHOPKEEPERS-ASSOCIATION-009660495/f375765e-7abc-4b48-b0ea-f04765d49b03&lt;/ref&gt;.
