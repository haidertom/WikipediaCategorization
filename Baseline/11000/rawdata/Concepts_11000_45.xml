''' Amalananda ''' was a South Indian Sanskrit scholar who lived during the reign of [[Mahadeva of Devagiri|Mahadeva]], the Yadava ruler of [[Daulatabad, Maharashtra|Devagiri]] who ruled from 1260 to 1271. Not much is known about his life and background. Anubhavānanda is believed to have been his preceptor.

Amalānanda wrote ''Vedānta Kalpatarū'' sometime before 1297. This book is a commentary on '' [[Bhāmatī]] '' of [[Vācaspati Miśra]] which text in its own turn is a commentary on [[Adi Sankara|Sankara]]’s commentary on the [[Brahma Sutras]] of [[Badarayana]]. His other works are – ''Śastra-darpana'' which is explanations of the Brahma Sutras, and ''Pancapādikā-darpana'' which is a commentary on [[Padmapadacharya|Padmapādācārya]]’s ''Pancapādika''. The language of these works is chaste and the thought-content is serious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of the Hindu World|author=Ganga Ram Garg|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|page=357|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WjDcd0cTFxQC&amp;pg=PA357&amp;lpg=PA357&amp;dq=amalananda+kalpataru&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YpCNUgEBOq&amp;sig=rUD3jM7MAVlO-Q46VKMFYCPqau8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZonPU_WeONiWuATYyoL4CA&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=amalananda%20kalpataru&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Vācaspati Miśra, the author of ''Bhāmatī'' lived around 841.  [[Appayya Dikshita]] (1520-1593), son of Rangarājādhvarindra of [[Kanchipuram|Kānci]], and a prolific writer, wrote his ''Kalpataruparimala'', a commentary on Amalānanda’s ''Vedanta-Kalpataru''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Indian Philosophy|author=Surendranath Dasgupta|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=418|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PoaMFmS1_lEC&amp;pg=PA418&amp;lpg=PA418&amp;dq=amalananda+kalpataru&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=89axbSgvBu&amp;sig=2NMgpIB9-9_-E6LFIJ3gl2toiec&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rovPU_bHAc6XuAT73YG4DQ&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwATgU#v=onepage&amp;q=amalananda%20kalpataru&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Undian Literature Vol.1|author=Amresh Datta|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|pages=217–218|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ObFCT5_taSgC&amp;pg=PA218&amp;lpg=PA218&amp;dq=amalananda+kalpataru&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mWz-ZuxOw6&amp;sig=yy9ZcL1UkGcRSRdBEcM4LnbBKdU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZonPU_WeONiWuATYyoL4CA&amp;ved=0CBoQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=amalananda%20kalpataru&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sankara explains ''Yadrecchāvadā'', referred to by the [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]], as the doctrine of accidental effects which are due to chance; Amalānanda explains it as the doctrine that effects are produced at any time depending on definite causes. The same Upanishad mentions nature (''svabhava'') as the cause of the world. Sankara explains it as the natural powers inherent in different things. Amalānanda explains nature as that which exists so long as things exists e.g. breathing as the nature of the living body exists so long as the body exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Outlines of Indian Philosophy|author=Jadunath Sinha|publisher=Pilgrim Books|pages=61, 62|url= https://books.google.com/books/about/Outlines_of_Indian_Philosophy.html?id=99aBngEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DickinsoniaCostata.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''[[Dickinsonia|Dickinsonia costata]]'' is one of the enigmatic [[fossil]]s, possibly an early [[animal]], in the [[Precambrian]] [[Ediacaran biota]].]]
The '''Avalon explosion''', named from the [[Precambrian]] fauna of the [[Avalon Peninsula]], is a proposed [[evolutionary radiation]] in the history of the [[Animalia]], about 575 million years ago, some 33 million years earlier than the [[Cambrian explosion]].

==Evidence==
[[File:Ediacaran trace fossil.jpg|thumb|Ediacaran trace fossil]]

Trace fossils of these Avalon organisms have been found worldwide, and represent the earliest known complex [[multicellular organism]]s.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Simple multicellular organisms such as [[red alga]]e evolved at least {{Ma|1200}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Avalon explosion produced the [[Ediacaran biota]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/01/080103144451.htm |title=Two Explosive Evolutionary Events Shaped Early History Of Multicellular Life |publisher=Virginia Tech|date=January 4, 2008|via=ScienceDaily |language=en |access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shen2007"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Shen |first=Bing |last2=Dong |first2=Lin |last3=Xiao |first3=Shuhai |last4=Kowalewski |first4=Michał |date=4 January 2008 |title=The Avalon Explosion: Evolution of Ediacara Morphospace |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/319/5859/81 |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |language=en |volume=319 |issue=5859 |pages=81–84 |bibcode=2008Sci...319...81S |doi=10.1126/science.1150279 |issn=0036-8075 |pmid=18174439}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biota largely disappeared contemporaneously with the rapid increase in [[biodiversity]] known as the Cambrian explosion.

The Avalon explosion appears similar to the Cambrian explosion in the rapid increase in diversity of [[morphology (biology)|morphologies]] in a relatively small time frame, followed by diversification within the established body plans,&lt;ref name="Shen2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Xiao2008"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Xiao |first=Shuhai |last2=Laflamme |first2=Marc |date=January 2009 |title=On the eve of animal radiation: phylogeny, ecology and evolution of the Ediacara biota |journal=[[Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution]] |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=31–40 |doi=10.1016/j.tree.2008.07.015 |pmid=18952316}}&lt;/ref&gt; a pattern similar to that observed in other evolutionary events.&lt;ref name="Xiao2008"/&gt;

==History==

The Avalon explosion was proposed in 2008 by [[Virginia Tech]] [[paleontologists]] through the analysis of the morphological space change in several [[Ediacaran]] assemblages.&lt;ref name="Shen2007" /&gt; The discovery suggests that in the early evolution of [[animals]], there may have been more than one explosive event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.astrobio.net/pressrelease/2580/the-avalon-explosion |title=The Avalon Explosion |date=8 January 2008 |publisher=Astrobiology Magazine |access-date=June 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original analysis has been the subject of dispute in the literature.&lt;ref name="Freeman2009"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Freeman |first=Gary |title=The rise of bilaterians |journal=Historical Biology |volume=21 |issue=1-2 |pages=99–114 |doi=10.1080/08912960903295843}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Xiao2009"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Xiao |first=Shuhai |last2=Kowalewski |first2=Michał |last3=Shen |first3=Bing |last4=Dong |first4=Lin |last5=Laflamme |first5=Marc |date=8 January 2010 |title=The rise of bilaterians: a reply |journal=[[Historical Biology]] |volume=21 |issue=3-4 |pages=239–246 |doi=10.1080/08912960903471659}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Freeman2010"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Freeman |first=Gary |date=30 Jun 2010 |title=Comment on Xiao et al.

[[File:Jian Jun Xi &amp; Cai Yuan at documenta festival.jpg|thumb|Jian Jun Xi &amp; Cai Yuan outside the [[Fridericianum]] museum, Kassel, Germany.]]
'''Cai Yuan and Jian Jun Xi''' are two Chinese-born artists, based in Britain, who work together under the name '''Mad For Real'''. They have enacted (unofficial) events at the [[Venice Biennale]] and the [[Turner Prize]], where, in 1999, they jumped onto [[Tracey Emin]]'s ''[[My Bed]]'' installation. Originally finding fame as [[performance art]]ists specialising in [[art intervention]], they have since diversified, engaging in numerous works in both Asia and Europe.

==Life==
&lt;p&gt;Born in [[China]], Cai Yuan (1956) and JJ Xi (1962), have been based in the UK since the 1980s.&lt;ref name="10Chancery"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;p&gt;They started working as a performance duo in 1999 with ''Two Artists Jump on Tracey Emin’s Bed'' (1999).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==''Two Naked Men Jump into Tracey's Bed''==
Their best-known{{by whom|date=September 2013}} performance occurred at 12.58 p.m. on 25 October 1999, when they jumped on [[Tracey Emin]]'s installation ''My Bed'', a work incorporating memorabilia on and around an unmade bed, in the Turner Prize at [[Tate Britain]]. They called their performance ''Two Naked Men Jump into Tracey's Bed'' (although in fact they kept their trousers on). They had in mind including some "critical sex" as they considered "a sexual act was necessary to fully respond to Tracey's piece", although this part of their intention was not fulfilled.  A visitor reported, "Everyone at the exhibition started clapping as they thought it was part of the show. At first, the security people didn't know what to do."&lt;ref name=wreck&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/1999/10/25/nbed25.html "Tate Protesters Wreck Artist's Unmade Bed" The Daily Telegraph], 25 October 1999 Retrieved 22 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; It was not clear to some whether the action was part of Emin's display or even a protest against the current visit of Chinese President [[Jiang Zemin]]. 

Another visitor commented, "After a few minutes of hopping about and shouting I think they ran out of things to do. If they had tried to wreck it, or stolen the vodka or her knickers, I might have felt differently. It made my weekend."&lt;ref name=satirists&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/turner1999/Story/0,12119,201733,00.html "Satirists Jump into Tracey's Bed", The Guardian], 5 October 1999 Retrieved 22 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The men only had time to start a pillow fight and attempt a swig from one of the empty vodka bottles next to the bed, before they were apprehended. The police and security guards were booed when they took the pair away. Cai and Xi were arrested for their action, but no charges were pressed, since "neither the gallery nor the artist had any desire to bring the matter further".&lt;ref name=satirists/&gt; 

Cai considered that, although Emin's work was strong, it was nevertheless institutionalised and said, "We want to push the idea further. Our action will make the public think about what is good art or bad art. We didn't have time to do a proper performance. I thought I should touch the bed and smell the bed." He had various words written in Chinese and English on his body, such as "Internationalism", "Freedom" and "Idealism". Xi said that the work was not interesting enough and also that he wanted to push it further, increasing its significance and sensationalism. Words written on his body included "Anarchism", "Idealism" and "Optimism".&lt;ref name=wreck/&gt; 

One of the words prominent along the length of Cai's torso was "Anti-Stuckism". This was surprising as the [[Stuckism|Stuckists]] had themselves been critical of Emin's art. However, Cai and Xi's explanation is that they were not anti Emin's type of work (which they merely wanted to "improve"—"We are simply trying to react to the work and the self-promotion implicit in it"), but were opposed to the Stuckists, who are anti-[[performance art]].&lt;ref name=jumping&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/gossip.html#11 "The Jumping Chinese Gentlemen at It again" Herr von Stuck's Hot Gossip Page] Retrieved 22 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt; According to Fiachra Gibbons of ''The Guardian'', the event "will go down in art history as the defining moment of the new and previously unheard of Anti-Stuckist Movement."&lt;ref name=satirists/&gt;

The Tate's official pronouncement was "The work has now been restored and the exhibition will open to the public as usual at 10 a.m.", but they would not be drawn on the nature of the restoration.&lt;ref name=satirists/&gt;

In 1997, they erected fake street signs in an attempt to mislead high-profile visitors to the [[Venice Biennale]]. 

At [[Goldsmiths College]] in London they scattered £1,200 around a room to point to the commercialism and greed of the art market. The audience scrambled on the floor to pick up the money.&lt;ref name=satirists/&gt;

In spring 2000, the artists returned to the Tate{{spaced ndash}}specifically, to the [[Tate Modern]]{{spaced ndash}}in an attempt to urinate into a 1964 artist-authorized replica of [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'', a urinal laid on its back and signed "R. Mutt". The Tate denied that the attempt succeeded.&lt;ref name=urinal&gt;[http://www.hatii.arts.gla.ac.uk/MultimediaStudentProjects/00-01/9704524l/MM%20Project/Html/badly3.htm "The Turner Prize", University of Glasgow] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021221052306/http://www.hatii.arts.gla.ac.uk/MultimediaStudentProjects/00-01/9704524l/MM%20Project/Html/badly3.htm# |date=21 December 2002 }}, retrieved 22 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture is now enclosed in a transparent box.

In [[set theory]], '''Cantor's diagonal argument''', also called the '''diagonalisation argument''', the '''diagonal slash argument''' or the '''diagonal method''', was published in 1891 by [[Georg Cantor]] as a [[mathematical proof]] that there are [[infinite set]]s which cannot be put into [[bijection|one-to-one correspondence]] with the infinite set of [[natural number]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Georg Cantor |title=Ueber eine elementare Frage der Mannigfaltigkeitslehre |journal=[[Jahresbericht der Deutschen Mathematiker-Vereinigung]] 1890–1891 |volume=1 |pages=75–78 |year=1891|url=https://www.digizeitschriften.de/dms/img/?PID=GDZPPN002113910&amp;physid=phys84#navi}} English translation: {{cite book |last=Ewald |first=William B.

Such sets are now known as [[uncountable set]]s, and the size of infinite sets is now treated by the theory of [[cardinal number]]s which Cantor began.

== Uncountable set ==
In his 1891 article, Cantor considered the set ''T'' of all infinite [[sequences]] of [[binary digits]] (i.e. each digit is zero or one).
He begins with a [[constructive proof]] of the following theorem:
:If ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … , ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, … is any enumeration of elements from ''T'', then there is always an element ''s'' of ''T'' which corresponds to no ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; in the enumeration.
The proof starts with an enumeration of elements from ''T'', for example:
:{|
|-
| ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = || (0, || 0, || 0, || 0, || 0, || 0, || 0, || ...)
|-
| ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = || (1, || 1, || 1, || 1, || 1, || 1, || 1, || ...)
|-
| ''s''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = || (0, || 1, || 0, || 1, || 0, || 1, || 0, || ...)
|-
| ''s''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = || (1, || 0, || 1, || 0, || 1, || 0, || 1, || ...)
|-
| ''s''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; = || (1, || 1, || 0, || 1, || 0, || 1, || 1, || ...)
|-
| ''s''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; = || (0, || 0, || 1, || 1, || 0, || 1, || 1, || ...)
|-
| ''s''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; = || (1, || 0, || 0, || 0, || 1, || 0, || 0, || ...)
|-
| ...
|}
Next, a sequence ''s'' is constructed by choosing the 1st digit as [[Ones' complement|complementary]] to the 1st digit of ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt; (swapping '''0'''s for '''1'''s and vice versa), the 2nd digit as complementary to the 2nd digit of ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;, the 3rd digit as complementary to the 3rd digit of ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''3''&lt;/sub&gt;, and generally for every ''n'', the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; digit as complementary to the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; digit of ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. For the example above, this yields:
:{|
|-
| ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; || = || (&lt;u&gt;'''0'''&lt;/u&gt;, || 0, || 0, || 0, || 0, || 0, || 0, || ...)
|-
| ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || = || (1, || &lt;u&gt;'''1'''&lt;/u&gt;, || 1, || 1, || 1, || 1, || 1, || ...)
|-
| ''s''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; || = || (0, || 1, || &lt;u&gt;'''0'''&lt;/u&gt;, || 1, || 0, || 1, || 0, || ...)
|-
| ''s''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; || = || (1, || 0, || 1, || &lt;u&gt;'''0'''&lt;/u&gt;, || 1, || 0, || 1, || ...)
|-
| ''s''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; || = || (1, || 1, || 0, || 1, || &lt;u&gt;'''0'''&lt;/u&gt;, || 1, || 1, || ...)
|-
| ''s''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; || = || (0, || 0, || 1, || 1, || 0, || &lt;u&gt;'''1'''&lt;/u&gt;, || 1, || ...)
|-
| ''s''&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; || = || (1, || 0, || 0, || 0, || 1, || 0, || &lt;u&gt;'''0'''&lt;/u&gt;, || ...)
|-
| ...
|-
|
|-
| ''s'' || = || (&lt;u&gt;'''1'''&lt;/u&gt;, || &lt;u&gt;'''0'''&lt;/u&gt;, || &lt;u&gt;'''1'''&lt;/u&gt;, || &lt;u&gt;'''1'''&lt;/u&gt;, || &lt;u&gt;'''1'''&lt;/u&gt;, || &lt;u&gt;'''0'''&lt;/u&gt;, || &lt;u&gt;'''1'''&lt;/u&gt;, || ...)
|}
By construction, ''s'' differs from each ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, since their ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; digits differ (highlighted in the example).
Hence, ''s'' cannot occur in the enumeration.

Based on this theorem, Cantor then uses a [[proof by contradiction]] to show that:
:The set ''T'' is uncountable.
The proof starts by assuming that ''T'' is [[countable set#Definition|countable]].
Then all its elements can be written as an enumeration ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … , ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, … .
Applying the previous theorem to this enumeration produces a sequence ''s'' not belonging to the enumeration. However, this contradicts ''s'' being an element of ''T'' and therefore belonging to the enumeration. This contradiction implies that the original assumption is false. Therefore, ''T'' is uncountable.

=== Interpretation ===
The interpretation of Cantor's result will depend upon one's view of mathematics. To [[constructivism (mathematics)|constructivists]], the argument shows no more than that there is no [[bijection]] between the natural numbers and ''T''. It does not rule out the possibility that the latter are [[subcountable]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} In the context of [[classical mathematics]], this is impossible, and the diagonal argument establishes that, although both sets are infinite, there are actually ''more'' infinite sequences of ones and zeros than there are natural numbers.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

=== Real numbers ===
The uncountability of the [[real number]]s was already established by [[Cantor's first uncountability proof]], but it also follows from the above result. To prove this, an [[injective function|injection]] will be constructed from the set ''T'' of infinite binary strings to the set '''R''' of real numbers. Since ''T'' is uncountable, the [[Image (mathematics)|image]] of this function, which is a subset of '''R''', is uncountable. Therefore, '''R''' is uncountable. Also, by using a method of construction devised by Cantor, a [[bijection]] will be constructed between ''T'' and '''R'''. Therefore, ''T'' and '''R''' have the same cardinality, which is called the "[[cardinality of the continuum]]" and is usually denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{c}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;.

An injection from ''T'' to '''R'''  is given by mapping strings in ''T'' to decimals, such as mapping ''t''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0111… to the decimal 0.0111…. This function, defined by {{nowrap|''f''{{space|hair}}(''t'') {{=}} 0.''t''}}, is an injection because it maps different strings to different numbers. 

Instead of mapping 0111… to the decimal 0.0111…, it can be mapped to the [[radix|base]] ''b'' number: 0.0111…&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt;. This leads to the family of functions: {{nowrap|''f''&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt;{{space|hair}}(''t'') {{=}} 0.''t''&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. The functions {{nowrap|''f''{{space|hair}}&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')}} are injections, except for {{nowrap|''f''{{space|hair}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')}}. This function will be modified to produce a bijection between ''T'' and '''R'''.

This construction uses a method devised by Cantor that was published in 1878. He used it to construct a bijection between the [[closed interval]] [0, 1] and the [[irrational number|irrational]]s in the [[open interval]] (0,&amp;nbsp;1). He first removed a [[countably infinite]] subset from each of these sets so that there is a bijection between the remaining uncountable sets. Since there is a bijection between the countably infinite subsets that have been removed, combining the two bijections produces a bijection between the original sets.&lt;ref&gt;See page 254 of {{Citation|author=Georg Cantor|title=Ein Beitrag zur Mannigfaltigkeitslehre|url=http://www.digizeitschriften.de/dms/img/?PID=GDZPPN002156806|volume=84|pages=242&amp;ndash;258|journal=Journal für die Reine und Angewandte Mathematik|year=1878}}. This proof is discussed in {{Citation|author=Joseph Dauben|title=Georg Cantor: His Mathematics and Philosophy of the Infinite|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1979|isbn=0-674-34871-0}}, pp. 61&amp;ndash;62, 65. On page 65, Dauben proves a result that is stronger than Cantor's. He lets "''φ&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;'' denote any sequence of rationals in [0,&amp;nbsp;1]." Cantor lets ''φ&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;'' denote a sequence [[Enumeration|enumerating]] the rationals in [0,&amp;nbsp;1], which is the kind of sequence needed for his construction of a bijection between [0,&amp;nbsp;1] and the irrationals in (0,&amp;nbsp;1).&lt;/ref&gt;

Cantor's method can be used to modify the function {{nowrap|''f''{{space|hair}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') {{=}} 0.''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} to produce a bijection from ''T'' to (0,&amp;nbsp;1). Because some numbers have two binary expansions, {{nowrap|''f''{{space|hair}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')}} is not even [[injective function|injective]]. For example, {{nowrap|''f''{{space|hair}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(1000…) {{=}}}} 0.1000…&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 1/2 and {{nowrap|''f''{{space|hair}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(0111…) {{=}}}} 0.0111…&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= {{nowrap|[[Infinite series|1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + …]] {{=}}}} 1/2, so both 1000… and 0111… map to the same number, 1/2. 

To modify {{nowrap|''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{space|hair}}(''t'')}}, observe that it is a bijection except for a countably infinite subset of (0,&amp;nbsp;1) and a countably infinite subset of ''T''. It is not a bijection for the numbers in (0,&amp;nbsp;1) that have two [[binary expansion]]s. These are called [[dyadic_rational|dyadic]] numbers and have the form {{nowrap|''m''{{space|hair}}/{{space|hair}}2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} where ''m'' is an odd integer and ''n'' is a natural number. Put these numbers in the sequence: ''r''&amp;nbsp;= (1/2, 1/4, 3/4, 1/8, 3/8, 5/8, 7/8,&amp;nbsp;…). Also, {{nowrap|''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{space|hair}}(''t'')}} is not a bijection to (0,&amp;nbsp;1) for the strings in ''T'' appearing after the [[binary point]] in the binary expansions of 0, 1, and the numbers in sequence ''r''. Put these eventually-constant strings in the sequence: ''s''&amp;nbsp;= ({{color|#808080|000}}…, {{color|#808080|111}}…, 1{{color|#808080|000}}…, 0{{color|#808080|111}}…, 01{{color|#808080|000}}…, 00{{color|#808080|111}}…, 11{{color|#808080|000}}…, 10{{color|#808080|111}}…,&amp;nbsp;...). Define the bijection ''g''(''t'') from ''T'' to (0,&amp;nbsp;1): If ''t'' is the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; string in sequence ''s'', let ''g''(''t'') be the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; number in sequence ''r''{{space|hair}}; otherwise, ''g''(''t'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

To construct a bijection from ''T'' to '''R''', start with the [[trigonometric functions|tangent function]] tan(''x''), which is a bijection from (−π/2,&amp;nbsp;π/2) to '''R''' (see the figure shown on the right). Next observe that the [[linear function]] ''h''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;= {{nowrap|π''x'' – π/2}} is a bijection from (0,&amp;nbsp;1) to (−π/2,&amp;nbsp;π/2) (see the figure shown on the left). The [[function composition|composite function]] tan(''h''(''x''))&amp;nbsp;= {{nowrap|tan(π''x'' – π/2)}} is a bijection from (0,&amp;nbsp;1) to '''R'''. Composing this function with ''g''(''t'') produces the function tan(''h''(''g''(''t'')))&amp;nbsp;= {{nowrap|tan(π''g''(''t'') – π/2)}}, which is a bijection from ''T'' to '''R'''.

== General sets ==
[[File:Diagonal argument powerset svg.svg|thumb|250px|Illustration of the generalized diagonal argument: The set ''T'' = {''n''∈ℕ: ''n''∉''f''(''n'')} at the bottom cannot occur anywhere in the range of ''f'':[[natural number|ℕ]]→[[power set|'''''P''''']](ℕ). The example mapping ''f'' happens to correspond to the example enumeration ''s'' in the [[#Lead|above]] picture.]]
A generalized form of the diagonal argument was used by Cantor to prove [[Cantor's theorem]]: for every [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''S'', the [[power set]] of ''S''—that is, the set of all [[subset]]s of ''S'' (here written as '''''P'''''(''S''))—has a larger cardinality than ''S'' itself. This proof proceeds as follows:

Let ''f'' be any [[Function (mathematics)|function]] from ''S'' to '''''P'''''(''S'').  It suffices to prove ''f'' cannot be [[surjective]]. That means that some member ''T'' of '''''P'''''(''S''), i.e. some subset of ''S'', is not in the [[Image (mathematics)|image]] of ''f''.  As a candidate consider the set:

:''T'' = { ''s'' ∈ ''S'': ''s'' ∉ ''f''(''s'') }.

For every ''s'' in ''S'', either ''s'' is in ''T'' or not. If ''s'' is in ''T'', then by definition of ''T'', ''s'' is not in ''f''(''s''), so ''T'' is not equal to ''f''(''s''). On the other hand,  if ''s'' is not in ''T'', then by definition of ''T'', ''s'' is in ''f''(''s''), so again ''T'' is not equal to ''f''(''s''); cf. picture.
For a more complete account of this proof, see [[Cantor's theorem]].

===Consequences===
This result implies that the notion of the [[set of all sets]] is an inconsistent notion.  If ''S'' were the set of all sets then '''''P'''''(''S'') would at the same time be bigger than ''S'' and a subset of ''S''.

[[Russell's Paradox]] has shown us that [[naive set theory]], based on an [[unrestricted comprehension]] scheme, is contradictory.  Note that there is a similarity between the construction of ''T'' and the set in Russell's paradox. Therefore, depending on how we modify the axiom scheme of comprehension in order to avoid Russell's paradox, arguments such as the non-existence of a set of all sets may or may not remain valid.

The diagonal argument shows that the set of real numbers is "bigger" than the set of natural numbers (and therefore, the integers and rationals as well). Therefore, we can ask if there is a set whose [[cardinality]] is "between" that of the integers and that of the reals. This question leads to the famous [[continuum hypothesis]]. Similarly, the question of whether there exists a set whose cardinality is between |''S''| and |'''''P'''''(''S'')| for some infinite ''S'' leads to the [[generalized continuum hypothesis]].

Analogues of the diagonal argument are widely used in mathematics to prove the existence or nonexistence of certain objects.  For example, the conventional proof of the unsolvability of the [[halting problem]] is essentially a diagonal argument.  Also, diagonalization was originally used to show the existence of arbitrarily hard [[complexity classes]] and played a key role in early attempts to prove [[P versus NP|P does not equal NP]].

===Version for Quine's New Foundations===
The above proof fails for [[W. V. Quine]]'s "[[New Foundations]]" set theory (NF). In NF, the [[unrestricted comprehension|naive axiom scheme of comprehension]] is modified to avoid the paradoxes by introducing a kind of "local" [[type theory]].  In this axiom scheme,

:{ ''s'' ∈ ''S'': ''s'' ∉ ''f''(''s'') }

is ''not'' a set — i.e., does not satisfy the axiom scheme.  On the other hand, we might try to create a modified diagonal argument by noticing that

:{ ''s'' ∈ ''S'': ''s'' ∉ ''f''({''s''}) }

''is'' a set in NF.  In which case, if '''''P'''''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''S'') is the set of one-element subsets of ''S'' and ''f'' is a proposed bijection from '''''P'''''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''S'') to '''''P'''''(''S''), one is able to use [[proof by contradiction]] to prove that |'''''P'''''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''S'')| &amp;lt; |'''''P'''''(''S'')|.

The proof follows by the fact that if ''f'' were indeed a map ''onto'' '''''P'''''(''S''), then we could find ''r'' in ''S'', such that  ''f''({''r''}) coincides with the modified diagonal set, above.  We would conclude that if ''r'' is not in ''f''({''r''}), then ''r'' is in ''f''({''r''}) and vice versa.

It is ''not'' possible to put '''''P'''''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''S'') in a one-to-one relation with ''S'', as the two have different types, and so any function so defined would violate the typing rules for the comprehension scheme.

{{African American topics sidebar|right|expanded=history}}

The '''African-American civil rights movement (1865–1896)''' was aimed at eliminating [[racism|racial discrimination]] against [[African American]]s, improving educational and employment opportunities, and establishing electoral power, just after the abolition of [[Slavery in the United States]]. This period between 1865 and 1895 saw tremendous change in the fortunes of the black community following the elimination of slavery in the [[American South|South]].

The year 1865 held two important events in the history of African Americans: the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], which eliminated slavery, was ratified; and [[United States|Union]] troops arrived in June in Texas to enforce the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], giving birth to the modern [[Juneteenth]] celebrations. [[Freedmen]] looked to start new lives as the country recovered from the devastation of the Civil War.

Immediately following the Civil War, the federal government began a program known as [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction]] aimed at rebuilding the states of the former [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. The federal programs also provided aid to the former slaves and attempted to integrate them as citizens into society. During and after this period, blacks made substantial gains in their political power and many were able to move from abject poverty to land ownership. At the same time resentment by many whites toward these gains resulted in unprecedented violence led by the local chapters of the [[Ku Klux Klan]], and later in the 1870s by such [[paramilitary]] groups as the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]] and [[White League]].

In 1896, the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'', a landmark upholding "separate but equal" racial segregation as constitutional. It was a devastating setback for civil rights, as [[Nadir of American race relations|the legal, social, and political status]] of the black population reached a nadir. From 1890 to 1908, beginning with Mississippi, southern states passed new constitutions and laws [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchising most blacks]] and excluding them from the political system, a status that was maintained in many cases into the 1960s.

Much of the early reform movement during this era was spearheaded by the [[Radical Republicans]], a faction of the [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]]. By the end of the 19th century, with disenfranchisement in progress to exclude blacks from the political system altogether, the so-called [[lily-white movement]] also worked to substantially weaken the power of remaining blacks in the party. The most important civil rights leaders of this period were [[Frederick Douglass]] (1818–1895) and [[Booker T. Washington]] (1856–1915).

[[File:FreedmenVotingInNewOrleans1867.jpeg|thumb|[[Freedman|Freedmen]] voting in New Orleans, 1867]]
Reconstruction lasted from Lincoln's [[Emancipation Proclamation]] of January 1, 1863 to the [[Compromise of 1877]].&lt;ref&gt;Allen C. Guelzo, ''Fateful Lightning: A New History of the Civil War and Reconstruction'' (2012) pp 445-513 is a brief treatment; see also Eric Foner, ''A Short History of Reconstruction'' (1990); and Mark Wahlgren Summers, ''The Ordeal of the Reunion: A New History of Reconstruction'' (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

The major issues faced by President [[Abraham Lincoln]] were the status of the ex-slaves (called "Freedmen"), the loyalty and civil rights of ex-rebels, the status of the 11 ex-Confederate states, the powers of the federal government needed to prevent a future civil war, and the question of whether Congress or the President would make the major decisions.

The severe threats of starvation and displacement of the unemployed Freedmen were met by the first major federal relief agency, the [[Freedmen's Bureau]], operated by the Army.&lt;ref&gt;Paul A, Cimbala, ''The Freedmen's Bureau: Reconstructing the American South after the Civil War'' (2005) includes a brief history and primary documents&lt;/ref&gt;

Three "[[Reconstruction Amendments]]" were passed to expand civil rights for black Americans: the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]]  outlawed slavery; the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] guaranteed equal rights for all and citizenship for blacks; the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] prevented race from being used to disfranchise men.

Of more immediate usefulness  than the constitutional amendments, were laws passed by Congress to allow the federal government, through the new Justice Department and through the federal courts to enforce the new civil rights Even if the state governments ignored the problem. These included the [[Enforcement Acts]] of 1870–71 and the [[Civil Rights Act of 1875]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Kaczorowski, "To Begin the Nation Anew: Congress, Citizenship, and Civil Rights after the Civil War." ''American Historical Review'' 92.1 (1987): 45-68. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1862782 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Cresswell, "Enforcing the Enforcement Acts: The Department of Justice in Northern Mississippi, 1870–1890." ''Journal of Southern History'' 53#3 (1987): 421-440. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2209362 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ex-Confederates remained in control of most Southern states for more than two years, but that changed when the [[Radical Republicans]] gained control of Congress in the 1866 elections. President [[Andrew Johnson]], who sought easy terms for reunions with ex-rebels, was virtually powerless; he escaped by one vote removal through impeachment. Congress enfranchised black men and temporarily suspended many ex-Confederate leaders of the right to hold office. New Republican governments came to power based on a coalition of Freedmen together with [[Carpetbaggers]] (new arrivals from the North), and [[Scalawags]] (native white Southerners). They were backed by the US Army. Opponents said they were corrupt and violated the rights of whites. State by state they lost power to a conservative-Democratic coalition, which gained control by violence and fraud of the entire South by 1877. In response to Radical Reconstruction, the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) emerged in 1867 as a white-supremacist organization opposed to black civil rights and Republican rule. President Ulysses Grant's vigorous enforcement of the [[Ku Klux Klan Act]] of 1870 shut down the Klan, and it disbanded. But from 1868 elections in many southern states were increasingly surrounded by violence to suppress black voting. Rifle clubs had thousands of members. In 1874, [[paramilitary]]  groups, such as the [[White League]] and [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]] emerged that worked openly to use intimidation and violence to suppress black voting and disrupt the Republican Party to regain white political power in states across the South. Rable described them as the "military arm of the Democratic Party."&lt;ref&gt;George C. Rable, ''But There Was No Peace: The Role of Violence in the Politics of Reconstruction'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Reconstruction ended after the disputed [[United States presidential election, 1876|1876 election]] between Republican candidate [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] and Democratic candidate [[Samuel J. Tilden]]. With a compromise Hayes won the White House, the federal government withdrew its troops from the South, abandoning the freedmen to white conservative Democrats, who regained power in state governments.&lt;ref&gt;Edward L. Ayers, ''The Promise of the New South: Life After Reconstruction'' (1992) pp 3-54&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kansas exodus==
{{Main|Exodus of 1879}}

Following the end of Reconstruction, many blacks feared the [[Ku Klux Klan]], the [[White League]] and the [[Jim Crow laws]] which continued to make them second-class citizens,.&lt;ref name="africana"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gates |first=Henry Louis |authorlink=Henry Louis Gates |title=Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African American Experience |publisher=[[Basic Civitas Books]] |year=1999 |pages=722 |isbn=0-465-00071-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motivated by important figures such as [[Benjamin "Pap" Singleton]], as many as forty thousand [[Exodusters]] left the [[Southern United States|South]] to settle in Kansas, [[Oklahoma]] and [[Colorado]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Benjamin "Pap" Singleton |url=https://www.pbs.org/weta/thewest/people/s_z/singleton.htm |accessdate=2007-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first general migration of blacks following the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Daniel Milo |title=Black Migration in America: A Social Demographic History |publisher=[[Duke University Press]] |year=1981 |pages=51 |isbn=0-8223-0449-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1880s, blacks bought more than {{convert|20000|acre|km2}} of land in Kansas, and several of the settlements made during this time (e.g. [[Nicodemus, Kansas]], which was founded in 1877) still exist today.  Many blacks left the South with the belief that they were receiving free passage to Kansas, only to be stranded in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. Black churches in St. Louis, together with Eastern philanthropists, formed the Colored Relief Board and the Kansas Freedmen's Aid Society to help those stranded in St. Louis to reach Kansas.&lt;ref name="africana"/&gt;

One particular group was the ''Kansas Fever Exodus'', which consisted of six thousand blacks who moved from [[Mississippi]], [[Louisiana]] and [[Texas]] to Kansas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Painter |first=Nell Irvin |authorlink=Nell Irvin Painter |title=Exodusters: Black Migration to Kansas After Reconstruction |publisher=[[W.W.

The exodus was not universally praised by African Americans; indeed, [[Frederick Douglass]] was a critic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Romero |first=Patricia W. |title=I Too Am America: Documents from 1619 to the Present |publisher=[[Publishers Agency]] |year=1968 |pages=150 |isbn=0-87781-206-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Douglass felt that the movement was ill-timed and poorly organized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sernett |first=Milton C. |title=Bound for the Promised Land: African American Religion and the Great Migration |publisher=[[Duke University Press]] |year=1997 |pages=14 |isbn=0-8223-1993-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political organization==
{{Further|Negro Republican Party}}
[[File:First Colored Senator and Representatives.jpg|thumb|First Colored Senator and Representatives: Sen. [[Hiram Rhodes Revels|Hiram Revels]] (R-MS), Rep. [[Benjamin S. Turner|Benjamin Turner]] (R-AL), [[Robert C. De Large|Robert DeLarge]] (R-SC), [[Josiah T. Walls|Josiah Walls]] (R-FL), [[Jefferson F. Long|Jefferson Long]] (R-GA), [[Joseph Rainey]] and [[Robert B. Elliott]] (R-SC), 1872]]

Black men across the South obtained the right to vote in 1867, and joined the Republican Party. The typical organization was through the [[Union League]], a secret society organized locally but promoted by the national Republican Party. [[Eric Foner]] reports:
:By the end of 1867 it seemed that virtually every black voter in the South had enrolled in the Union League, the Loyal League, or some equivalent local political organization. Meetings were generally held in a black church or school.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Foner, "Black Reconstruction Leaders at the Grass Roots" in {{cite book |editor=Leon F. Litwack |editor2=August Meier |title=Black Leaders of the Nineteenth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QB-Y2Ejlp9oC&amp;pg=PA221|year=1991|page=221|isbn=9780252062131 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Union Leagues promoted militia-like organizations in which the blacks banded together to protect themselves from being picked off one-by-one by harassers. Members were not allowed to vote the Democratic ticket.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Hahn, ''A Nation under Our Feet: Black Political Struggles in the Rural South, from Slavery to the Great Migration'' (2003) pp 174-84.&lt;/ref&gt; The Union Leagues and similar groups came under violent assault from the KKK after 1869, and largely collapsed. Later efforts to revive the Union League failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael W. Fitzgerald|title=The Union League Movement in the Deep South: Politics and Agricultural Change During Reconstruction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9es8ZKgQuA0C&amp;pg=PA2|year=2000|publisher=LSU Press|pages=2–8, 235, 237|isbn=9780807126332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black ministers provided much of the black political leadership, together with newcomers who had been free blacks in the North before the Civil War. Many cities had black newspapers that explained the issues and rallied the community.&lt;ref&gt;Richard H. Abbott, ''For Free Press and Equal Rights: Republican Newspapers in the Reconstruction South'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Factionalism===
{{further|Lily-white movement|Black-and-tan faction}}

In state after state across the South, a polarization emerged inside the Republican Party, with the blacks and their [[carpetbagger]] allies forming the [[Black-and-tan faction]], which faced the [[Lily-white movement|all-white "lily-white" faction]] of local white [[scalawag]] Republicans.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Foner, ''Reconstruction: America's unfinished revolution, 1863–1877'' (1988) pp 303-7&lt;/ref&gt;  (The terms for the factions became common after 1888, a decade after the end of Reconstruction.)&lt;ref&gt;Paul D. Casdorph, "Lily-White Movement," ''Handbook of Texas Online'', [http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/wfl01 accessed March 17, 2016]
&lt;/ref&gt; The blacks comprised the majority of Republican voters, but got a small slice of the patronage. They demanded more. Hahn explains the steps they took:
:Black assertiveness....looked toward local political power and independence and began to construct a new political identity. Black laborers called white party leaders to account.  They moved to control the county and district party machinery. They rejected white office-seekers and substituted black ones. They nominated all-black electoral slates.&lt;ref&gt;Hahn, ''A Nation under Our Feet'' (2003) p 253.&lt;/ref&gt;

The black-and-tan element usually won the factional battle, but as scalawags lost intra-party battles, many started voting for the conservative or Democratic tickets. The Republican Party became "blacker and blacker over time", as it lost white voters.&lt;ref&gt;Hahn, ''A Nation under Our Feet'' (2003) p 254.&lt;/ref&gt;  The most dramatic episode was the [[Brooks–Baxter War]] in Arkansas in 1874.&lt;ref&gt;Michael W. Fitzgerald,  "Republican Factionalism and Black Empowerment: The Spencer-Warner Controversy and Alabama Reconstruction, 1868–1880." ''Journal of Southern History'' 64#3 (1998): 473-494. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2587791 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  Michael Les Benedict says, "Every modern history of Reconstruction stresses its [factionalism] contribution to the collapse of southern Republicanism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Les Benedict|title=Preserving the Constitution: Essays on Politics and the Constitution in the Reconstruction Era|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n0ngj_9Dy6AC&amp;pg=PA247|year=2006|page=247|isbn=9780823225538}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In terms of racial issues, Sarah Woolfolk Wiggins argues:
:White Republicans as well as Democrats solicited black votes but reluctantly rewarded blacks with nominations for office only when necessary, even then reserving the more choice positions for whites. The results were predictable: these half-a-loaf gestures satisfied neither black nor white Republicans. The fatal weakness of the Republican Party in Alabama, as elsewhere in the South, was its inability to create a biracial political party. And while in power even briefly, they failed to protect their members from Democratic terror. Alabama Republicans were forever on the defensive, verbally and physically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sarah Woolfolk Wiggins|title=The Scalawag In Alabama Politics, 1865-1881|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nv9mBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA134|year=1977|page=134|isbn=9780817305574}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Populism===
{{See also|People's Party (United States)|History of the United States (1865–1918)#Populism}}
In 1894, a wave of agrarian unrest swept through the cotton and tobacco regions of the South. The most dramatic impact came in North Carolina, where the poor white farmers who comprised the Populist party formed a working coalition with the Republican Party, then largely controlled by blacks in the low country, and poor whites in the mountain districts. They took control of the state legislature in both 1894 and 1896, and the governorship in 1896. The state legislature lowered property requirements, expanding the franchise for the white majority in the state as well as for blacks. In 1895, the Legislature rewarded its black allies with patronage, naming 300 black magistrates in eastern districts, as well as deputy sheriffs and  city policemen. They also received some federal patronage from the coalition congressman, and state patronage from the governor.&lt;ref&gt;[[Helen G. Edmonds]], ''The Negro and Fusion Politics in North Carolina, 1894–1901'' (1951). pp 97-136&lt;/ref&gt;

Determined to regain power, white Democrats mounted a campaign based on white supremacy and fears about miscegenation. The white supremacy election campaign of 1898 was successful, and Democrats regained control of the state legislature. But Wilmington, the largest city and one with a black majority, elected a biracial Fusionist government, with a white mayor and two-thirds of the city council being whites. Democrats had already planned to overthrow the government if they lost the election here and proceeded with the [[Wilmington Insurrection of 1898]]. The Democrats ran blacks and Fusionist officials out of town, attacking the only black newspaper in the state; white mobs attacked black areas of the city, killing and injuring many, and destroying homes and businesses built up since the war.&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Meryl Kirshenbaum, "'The Vampire That Hovers Over North Carolina': Gender, White Supremacy, and the Wilmington Race Riot of 1898," ''Southern Cultures'' 4#3 (1998) pp. 6-30 [http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/southern_cultures/v004/4.3.kirshenbaum.html online]
&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 2100 blacks left the city permanently, leaving it a white-majority city. There were no further insurgencies in any Southern states that had a successful black-Populist coalition at the state level. In 1899, the white Democratic-dominated North Carolina legislature passed a suffrage amendment [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchising most blacks]]. They would largely not recover the power to vote until after passage of the federal [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]]

==Economic and social conditions==
The great majority of blacks in this period were farmers. Among them were four main groups, three of which worked for white landowners: tenant farmers, sharecroppers, and agricultural laborers.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Royce, ''The Origins of Southern Sharecropping'' (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James R. Irwin and Anthony Patrick O'Brien. "Where Have All the Sharecroppers Gone?: Black Occupations in Postbellum Mississippi." ''Agricultural History'' 72#2 (1998): 280-297.

''Journal of Southern History'' 50.4 (1984): 569-596. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2208473 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth group were the blacks who owned their own farms, and were to some degree independent of white economic control.&lt;ref&gt;Sharon Ann Holt, "Making freedom pay: Freedpeople working for themselves, North Carolina, 1865–1900." ''Journal of Southern History'' 60#2 (1994): 229-262.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Urban elements===
The South had relatively few cities of any size in 1860, But during the war, and afterward, refugees both black and white flooded in from rural areas. The growing black population produced a leadership class of ministers, professionals, and businessmen.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, ''Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution'' (1988) pp 396-98.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howard N. Rabinowitz, ''Race Relations in the Urban South, 1865–1890'' (1978) pp 61-96, 240-48.&lt;/ref&gt; These leaders typically made civil rights a high priority.  Of course, great majority of blacks in urban America were unskilled or low skilled blue-collar workers.&lt;ref&gt;James Illingworth, ''Crescent City Radicals: Black Working People and the Civil War Era in New Orleans.'' (PhD dissertation, University of California Santa Cruz, 2015) [http://escholarship.org/uc/item/1g4548w5.pdf online].&lt;/ref&gt; Historian August Meier reports:
:From the late 1880's there was a remarkable development of Negro business – banks and insurance companies, undertakers and retail stores.... It occurred at a time when Negro barbers, tailors caterers, trainmen, blacksmiths, and other artisans were losing their white customers. Depending upon the Negro market, the promoters of the new enterprises naturally upheld the spirit of racial self-help and solidarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=August Meier|title=Negro Thought in America, 1880-1915: Racial Ideologies in the Age of Booker T.

====Memphis====

[[File:Black Americans attacked in Memphis Riot of 1866.jpg|thumb|400px|Blacks in Memphis under attack, ''Harper's Weekly'', 26 May 1866]]

During the war thousands of slaves escaped from rural plantations to Union lines, and the Army established a contraband camp next to Memphis, Tennessee. By 1865, there were 20,000 blacks in the city, a sevenfold increase from the 3,000 before the war.&lt;ref name="Ryan"&gt;James G. Ryan, "The Memphis Riots of 1866: Terror in a Black Community during Reconstruction", ''Journal of Negro History'' (1977) 62#3: 243-257, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2716953 at JSTOR].&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of black Union soldiers was resented by Irish Catholics in the city, who competed with blacks for unskilled labor jobs. In 1866, there was a [[Memphis riots of 1866|major riot]] with whites attacking blacks. Forty-five blacks were killed, and nearly twice as many wounded; much of their makeshift housing was destroyed.&lt;ref name="carden"&gt;[http://mercatus.org/sites/default/files/publication/WP1040_An%20Unrighteous%20Piece%20of%20Business.pdf Art Carden and Christopher J. Coyne, "An Unrighteous Piece of Business: A New Institutional Analysis of the Memphis Riot of 1866"], Mercatus Center, George Mason University, July 2010, accessed 1 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt; By 1870, the black population was 15,000 in a city total of 40,226.&lt;ref name="Ryan"/&gt;

[[Robert Reed Church]] (1839–1912), a freedman, was the South's first black millionaire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rachel Kranz|title=African-American Business Leaders and Entrepreneurs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NCHX6P8ETI0C&amp;pg=PA49|year=2004|pages=49–51|isbn=9781438107790}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his wealth from speculation in city real estate, much of it after Memphis became depopulated after the [[yellow fever]] epidemics. He founded the city's first black-owned bank, Solvent Savings Bank, ensuring that the black community could get loans to establish businesses. He was deeply involved in local and national Republican politics and directed patronage to the black community. His son became a major politician in Memphis. He was a leader of black society and a benefactor in numerous causes. Because of the drop in city population, blacks gained other opportunities. They were hired to the police force as patrolmen and retained positions in it until 1895, when imposed segregation forced them out.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Caplinger, "Yellow Fever Epidemics", ''Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Atlanta====
[[History of Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]] had been devastated in the war, but as a major railroad center it rebuilt rapidly afterwards, attracting many rural migrants.  From 1860 to 1870 Fulton County (Of which Atlanta was the county seat) more than doubled in population, from 14,000 to 33,000. In a pattern seen across the South, many freedmen moved from plantations to towns or cities for work and to gather in communities of their own. Fulton County went from 20.5%  black in 1860 to 45.7% black in 1870.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu/index.html] University of West Virginia, Historical Census Browser, 1860 census&lt;/ref&gt;  Atlanta quickly became a leading national center of black education. The faculty and students provided a supportive environment for civil rights discussions and activism. [[Clark Atlanta University#Atlanta University|Atlanta University]] was established in 1865. The forerunner of [[Morehouse College]] opened in 1867, [[Clark Atlanta University#Clark University|Clark University]] opened in 1869. What is now [[Spelman College]] opened in 1881, and [[Morris Brown College]] in 1885. This would be one of several factors aiding the establishment of one of the nation's oldest and best-established [[American Black Upper Class|African American elite]] in Atlanta.

====Philadelphia====
[[History of Philadelphia|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] was one of the largest cities north of the Mason–Dixon line, and attracted many free blacks before the Civil War. They generally lived in the Southwark and Moyamensing neighborhoods. By the 1890s, the neighborhoods had a negative reputation in terms of crime, poverty, and mortality.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Lane, ''William Dorsey's Philadelphia and Ours: On the Past and Future of the Black City in America'' (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;  W.E.B. Du Bois, in his pioneering sociological study ''The Philadelphia Negro'' (1899), undermined the stereotypes with experimental evidence. He shaped his approach to segregation and its negative impact on black lives and reputations. The results led Du Bois to realize that racial integration was the key to democratic equality in American cities.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Bulmer, "W. E. B. Du Bois as a Social Investigator: The Philadelphia Negro, 1899," in Martin Bulmer, Kevin Bales, and Kathryn Kish Sklar, eds. ''The Social Survey in Historical Perspective, 1880–1940'' (1991) pp 170-88.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
{{further|Black school}}
The African-American community engaged in a long-term struggle for quality public schools. Historian Hilary Green says it "was not merely a fight for access to literacy and education, but one for freedom, citizenship, and a new postwar social order."&lt;ref&gt;Hilary Green, '' Educational Reconstruction: African American Schools in the Urban South, 1865–1890'' (Fordham UP, 2016) p 15&lt;/ref&gt;  The black community and its white supporters in the North emphasized the critical role of education is the foundation for establishing equality in civil rights.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, ''Reconstruction'' pp 96-102, 144-46, 322&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anti-literacy law]]s for both free and enslaved black people had been in force in many southern states since the 1830s,&lt;ref&gt;Heather Andrea Williams, ''[[Self-Taught: African American Education in Slavery and Freedom]]'' (U of North Carolina Press, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The widespread illiteracy made it urgent that high on the African-American agenda was creating new schooling opportunities, including both private schools and public schools for black children funded by state taxes. The states did pass suitable laws during Reconstruction, but the implementation was weak in most rural areas, and with uneven results in urban areas. After Reconstruction ended the tax money was limited, but local blacks and national religious groups and philanthropists helped out.

Integrated public schools meant local white teachers in charge, and they were not trusted. The black leadership generally supported segregated all-black schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Betty Jamerson Reed|title=School Segregation in Western North Carolina: A History, 1860s-1970s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l2oFNmUlEn8C&amp;pg=PA21|year=2011|publisher=McFarland|page=21|isbn=9780786487080}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nell Irvin Painter|title=Exodusters: Black Migration to Kansas After Reconstruction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dtXECQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA49|year=1992|pages=49–51|isbn=9780393352511}}&lt;/ref&gt; The black community wanted black principals and teachers, or (in private schools) highly supportive whites sponsored by northern churches. Public schools were segregated throughout the South during Reconstruction and afterward into the 1950s. New Orleans was a partial exception: its schools were usually integrated during Reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;Louis R. Harlan, "Desegregation in New Orleans Public Schools During Reconstruction." ''American Historical Review'' 67#3 (1962): 663-675. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1844107 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the era of Reconstruction, the [[Freedmen's Bureau]] opened 1000 schools across the South for black children using federal funds. Enrollments were high and enthusiastic. Overall, the Bureau spent $5 million to set up schools for blacks and by the end of 1865, more than 90,000 Freedmen were enrolled as students in public schools.  The school curriculum resembled that of schools in the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=James D. |last=Anderson |title=[[The Education of Blacks in the South, 1860–1935]] |location=Chapel Hill |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |year=1988 |isbn=0-8078-1793-7 |pages= |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the end of Reconstruction, however, state funding for black schools was minimal, and facilities were quite poor.&lt;ref&gt;Louis R. Harlan, ''Separate and Unequal: Public School Campaigns and Racism in the Southern Seaboard States, 1901–1915'' (1958) pp 3-44 [https://www.questia.com/library/89767620/separate-and-unequal-public-school-campaigns-and online].&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Freedman Bureau teachers were well-educated Yankee women motivated by religion and abolitionism. Half the teachers were southern whites; one-third were blacks, and one-sixth were northern whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ronald E. |last=Butchart |title=Schooling the Freed People: Teaching, Learning, and the Struggle for Black Freedom, 1861–1876 |location=Chapel Hill |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-8078-3420-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bLxx14deoRcC }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Black men slightly outnumbered black women.  The salary was the strongest motivation except for the northerners, who were typically funded by northern organizations and had a humanitarian motivation.  As a group, only the black cohort showed a commitment to racial equality; they were the ones most likely to remain teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Michelle A. |last=Krowl |title=Review of Butchart, Ronald E., ''Schooling the Freed People: Teaching, Learning, and the Struggle for Black Freedom, 1861–1876'' |work=H-SAWH, H-Net Reviews |date=September 2011 |url=https://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=32584 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secondary and collegiate education===
Almost all colleges in the South were strictly segregated; a handful of northern colleges accepted black students.  Private schools were established across the South by churches, and especially by northern denominations, to provide education after elementary schooling.  They focused on secondary level (high school) work and provided a small amount of collegiate work.&lt;ref&gt;F. Erik Brooks, and Glenn L. Starks. ''Historically Black Colleges and Universities: An Encyclopedia'' (Greenwood, 2011) pp 11-132 describes the 66 colleges opened by 1900; most are still active today.&lt;/ref&gt; Tuition was minimal, so national and local churches often supported the colleges financially, and also subsidized some teachers.  The largest dedicated organization was the [[American Missionary Association]], chiefly sponsored by the Congregational churches of New England.&lt;ref name="Joe M. Richardson 1986"&gt;Joe M. Richardson, ''Christian Reconstruction: The American Missionary Association and Southern Blacks, 1861–1890'' (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1900, Northern churches or organizations they sponsored operated 247 schools for blacks across the South, with a budget of about $1 million. They employed 1600 teachers and taught 46,000 students.&lt;ref name="Joe M. Richardson 1986"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Annual Report: Hampton Negro Conference|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jUQ9AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA59|year=1901|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the collegiate level the most prominent private schools were [[Fisk University]] in Nashville, [[Atlanta University]], and [[Hampton Institute]] in Virginia. A handful were founded in northern states.  [[Howard University]] was a federal school based in Washington.

In 1890, Congress expanded the land-grant plan to include federal support for state-sponsored colleges across the South. It required southern states with segregated systems to establish black colleges as land-grant institutions so that all students would have an opportunity to study at such places. [[Hampton University|Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute]] was of national importance because it set the standards for industrial education.{{sfn|Anderson|1988|pp=33-78}} Of even greater influence was [[Tuskegee Institute|Tuskegee Normal School for Colored Teachers]], founded in 1881 by the state of Alabama and led by Hampton alumnus [[Booker T. Washington]] until his death in 1915.  Elsewhere, in 1900 there were few black students enrolled in college-level work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kassie Freeman|title=African American Culture and Heritage in Higher Education Research and Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OzweC0P6k2YC&amp;pg=PA146|year=1998|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only 22 blacks graduated from college before the Civil War.

They became professionals; 54% became teachers; 20% became clergyman; others were physicians, lawyers or editors. They averaged about $15,000 in wealth. Many provided intellectual and organizational support for civic projects, especially civil rights activities at the local level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=W.E.

===Funding and philanthropy===

Funding for education for blacks in the South came from multiple sources. From 1860 to 1910, religious denominations and philanthropies contributed about $55 million. Blacks themselves through their churches, contributed over $22 million. The southern states spent about $170 million in tax dollars on black schools, and about six times that amount for white schools.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book|title=Negro Year Book: An Annual Encyclopedia of the Negro ....|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ysEyAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA180|year=1913|page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much philanthropy from rich Northerners focused on the education of blacks in the South. By far the largest early funding came from the [[Peabody Education Fund]]. The money was donated by [[George Peabody]], originally of Massachusetts, who made a fortune in finance in Baltimore and London. He gave $3.5 million to "encourage the intellectual, moral, and industrial education of the destitute children of the Southern States."&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peabodyevents.library.jhu.edu/history.html |publisher=Johns Hopkins University |title=George Peabody Library History |accessdate=2010-03-12 |quote=After the Civil War he funded the Peabody Education Fund which established public education in the South. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604172628/http://www.peabodyevents.library.jhu.edu/history.html |archivedate=2010-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Slater Fund|John F. Slater Fund for the Education of Freedmen]] was created in 1882 with $1.5 million for "Uplifting the legally emancipated population of the Southern states and their posterity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Negro Year Book: An Annual Encyclopedia of the Negro ....|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ysEyAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA181|year=1913|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After 1900, even larger sums came from Rockefeller's [[General Education Board]], from Andrew Carnegie and from the [[Rosenwald Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;Eric Anderson and Alfred A. Moss, ''Dangerous donations: Northern philanthropy and southern Black education, 1902–1930'' (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1900, the black population in the United States had reached 8.8 million; it was based overwhelmingly in the rural South.  The  school-age population was 3 million; half of them were in attendance. They were taught by 28,600 teachers, the vast majority of whom were black. Schooling (for both whites and blacks) was geared to teaching the three R's to younger children. There were only 86 high schools for blacks in the entire South, plus 6 in the North. These 92 schools had 161 male teachers, and 111 female teachers; they taught 5200 students in the high school grades. In 1900, there were only 646 blacks who graduated from high school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Annual Report: Hampton Negro Conference|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jUQ9AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA57|year=1901|publisher=Hampton Institute Press|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
Black churches played a powerful role in the African-American civil rights movement. They were the core community group around which black Republicans organize their partisanship.&lt;ref&gt;Hahn, ''A Nation under Our Feet: Black Political Struggles in the Rural South, from Slavery to the Great Migration'' (2003) pp 230–34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John M. Giggie, ''After redemption: Jim Crow and the transformation of African American religion in the Delta, 1875–1915'' (2007). [ DOI:10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195304039.001.0001 online]&lt;/ref&gt;  The great majority of the black Baptist and Methodist churches rapidly became independent of the primarily white national or regional denominations after 1865. Black Baptist congregations set up their own associations and conventions.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Bailey, "The Post–Civil War Racial Separations in Southern Protestantism," ''Church History'' (1977) 46#4 pp 453-73 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3164440 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  Their ministers became leading political spokesman for their congregations.&lt;ref&gt;C. Eric Lincoln and Lawrence H. Mamiya, ''The Black Church in the African American Experience'' (Duke University Press, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;  Black women found their own space and church-sponsored organizations, ranging from choirs to missionary projects, to church schools and Sunday schools.&lt;ref&gt;Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham, ''Righteous Discontent: The Women's Movement in the Black Baptist Church, 1880–1920'' (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

In San Francisco there were three black churches in the early 1860s. They all sought to represent the interests of the black community, provided spiritual leadership and rituals, organized help for the needy, and fought against attempts to deny blacks their civil rights.&lt;ref&gt;Philip M. Montesano, "San Francisco Black Churches in the Early 1860's" ''California Historical Quarterly'' (1973) 52#2 pp 145-152&lt;/ref&gt;  The San Francisco black churches had decisive support from the local Republican Party. In the 1850s, the Democrats controlled the state and enacted anti-black legislation. Even though black slavery had never existed in California, the laws were harsh. The Republican Party came to power in the early 1860s, and rejected exclusion and legislative racism. Republican leaders joined black activists to win the legal rights, especially in terms of the right to vote, the right to attend public schools, equal treatment in public transportation, and equal access to the court system.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Chandler, "Friends in Time of Need: Republicans and Black Civil Rights in California during the Civil War Era" ''Arizona &amp; the West'' (1982) 24#4 pp 319-340. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40169219 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Black Americans, once freed from slavery, were very active in forming their own churches, most of them Baptist or Methodist, and giving their ministers both moral and political leadership roles. In a process of self-segregation, practically all blacks left white churches so that few racially integrated congregations remained (apart from some Catholic churches in Louisiana).  Four main organizations competed with each other across the South to form new Methodist churches composed of freedmen. They were the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]], founded in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; the [[African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church]], founded in New York City; the [[Christian Methodist Episcopal Church|Colored Methodist Episcopal Church]] (which was sponsored by the white [[Methodist Episcopal Church, South]]), and the well-funded [[Methodist Episcopal Church]] (Northern white Methodists).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel W. Stowell|title=Rebuilding Zion : The Religious Reconstruction of the South, 1863-1877|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jQphbo640wAC&amp;pg=PA84|year=1998|publisher=Oxford UP|pages=83–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clarence Earl Walker, ''A Rock in a Weary Land: The African Methodist Episcopal Church During the Civil War and Reconstruction'' (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1871, the Northern Methodists had 88,000 black members in the South, and had opened numerous schools for them.&lt;ref&gt;William W. Sweet, "The Methodist Episcopal Church and Reconstruction," ''Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society'' (1914) 7#3 pp. 147-165 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40194198 in JSTOR] at p.&lt;/ref&gt;

The blacks during [[Reconstruction Era]] were politically the core element of the [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]], and the ministers played a powerful political role. Their ministers could be more outspoken  since they did not primarily depend on white support, in contrast to teachers, politicians, businessmen, and tenant farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald Lee Grant|title=The Way It Was in the South: The Black Experience in Georgia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zpmjRm4cdswC&amp;pg=PA264|year=1993|publisher=U. of Georgia Press|page=264}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Acting on the principle expounded by [[Charles H. Pearce]], an AME minister in Florida: "A man in this State cannot do his whole duty as a minister except he looks out for the political interests of his people," over 100 black ministers were elected to state legislatures during Reconstruction. Several served in Congress and one, [[Hiram Rhodes Revels|Hiram Revels]], in the U.S. Senate.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Foner, ''Reconstruction: America's unfinished revolution, 1863–1877'' (1988) p 93&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methodists===
[[File:Henry McNeil Turner.jpg|thumb|180px|Bishop Henry McNeal Turner, AME leader in Georgia.]]

The most well organized and active of the black churches was the African Methodist Episcopal church (AME). In Georgia, AME Bishop [[Henry McNeal Turner]] (1834–1915) became a leading spokesman for justice and equality. He served as a pastor, writer, newspaper editor, debater, politician, the chaplain of the Army, and a key leader of emerging black Methodist organization in Georgia and the Southeast. In 1863, during the Civil War, Turner was appointed as the first black chaplain in the [[United States Colored Troops]].  Afterward, he was appointed to the [[Freedmen's Bureau]] in Georgia. He settled in [[Macon, Georgia]], and was elected to the state legislature in 1868 during Reconstruction. He planted many AME churches in Georgia. In 1880, he was elected as the first southern bishop of the AME Church after a fierce battle within the denomination. He fought Jim Crow laws.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Ward Angell, ''Henry McNeal Turner and African-American Religion in the South'' (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

Turner was the leader of black nationalism and promoted emigration of blacks to Africa. He believed in separation of the races. He started a back-to-Africa movement in support of the black American colony in Liberia.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin S. Redkey, "Bishop Turner's African Dream." ''Journal of American History'' 54#2 (1967): 271-290. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1894806 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  Turner built black pride by proclaiming "God is a Negro."&lt;ref&gt;Andre E. Johnson, "God is a Negro: The (Rhetorical) Black Theology of Bishop Henry McNeal Turner." ''Black Theology'' 13.1 (2015): 29-40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andre E. Johnson, '' The Forgotten Prophet: Bishop Henry McNeal Turner and the African American Prophetic Tradition'' (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a second all-black Methodist Church, the smaller [[African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church]] (AMEZ). AMEZ remained smaller than AME because some of its ministers lacked the authority to perform marriages, and many of its ministers avoided political roles. Its finances were weak, and in general its leadership was not as strong as AME.  However it was the leader among all Protestant denominations in ordaining women and giving them powerful roles.&lt;ref&gt;Canter Brown, Jr. and Larry Eugene Rivers, ''For a Great and Grand Purpose: The Beginnings of the AMEZ Church in Florida, 1864–1905'' (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;  One influential leader was bishop [[James Walker Hood]] (1831–1918) of North Carolina. He not only created and fostered his network of AMEZ churches in North Carolina, but he also was the grand master for the entire South of the [[Prince Hall Freemasonry|Prince Hall Masonic Lodge]], a secular organization that strengthen the political and economic forces inside the black community.&lt;ref&gt;David G. Hackett, "The Prince Hall Masons and the African American Church: The Labors of Grand Master and Bishop James Walker Hood, 1831–1918." ''Church History'' 69#4 (2000): 770-802. [https://web.archive.org/web/20060905135531/http://faculty.ncf.edu/hite/Secure_Documents/American/Prince%20Hall%20Masons.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to all-black churches,  many black Methodists were associated with the Northern Methodist Church. Others were associated with the [[Christian Methodist Episcopal Church|Colored Methodist Episcopal Church]] CME; CME was an organ of the white Southern Methodist Church.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond R. Sommerville, ''An Ex-colored Church: Social Activism in the CME Church, 1870–1970'' (Mercer University Press, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;  In general, the most politically active black ministers affiliated with AME.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, ''Reconstruction: America's unfinished revolution, 1863–1877'' (1988) pp 282-83&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baptists===
Black Baptists broke from the white churches and formed independent operations across the South,&lt;ref&gt;Walter H. Brooks, "The Evolution of the Negro Baptist Church." ''Journal of Negro History'' 7#1 (1922): 11-22. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2713578 free in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; rapidly forming state and regional associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thomas S. Kidd|author2=Barry Hankins|title=Baptists in America: A History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jz21BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA149|year=2015|pages=149–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the Methodists, who had a hierarchical structure led by bishops, the Baptist churches were largely independent of each other, although they pooled resources for missionary activities, especially missions in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Sandy Dwayne Martin, ''Black Baptists and African Missions: The Origins of a Movement, 1880–1915'' (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; The Baptist women worked hard to carve out a partially independent sphere inside the denomination.&lt;ref&gt;Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham, ''Righteous discontent: The women's movement in the Black Baptist church, 1880–1920'' (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shirley Hamilton, "African American Women Roles In The Baptist Church: Equality Within the National Baptist Convention, USA." (MA Thesis, Wake Forest University, 2009). [https://wakespace.lib.wfu.edu/bitstream/handle/10339/14761/Hamilton_MALS_Thesis.pdf?seq online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Urban churches===
The great majority of blacks lived in rural areas where services were held in small makeshift buildings. In the cities black churches were more visible. Besides their regular religious services, the urban churches had numerous other activities, such as scheduled prayer meetings, missionary societies, women's clubs, youth groups, public lectures, and musical concerts.  Regularly scheduled revivals operated over a period of weeks reaching large, appreciative and noisy crowds.&lt;ref name="Howard N. Rabinowitz 1978 pp 208-213"&gt;Howard N.  Rabinowitz, ''Race Relations in the Urban South: 1865–1890'' (1978),  pp 208-213&lt;/ref&gt;

Charitable activities abounded concerning the care of the sick and needy. The larger churches had a systematic education program, besides the Sunday schools, and Bible study groups. They held literacy classes to enable older members to read the Bible. Private black colleges, such as Fisk in Nashville, often began in the basement of the churches. Church supported the struggling small business community.&lt;ref name="Howard N. Rabinowitz 1978 pp 208-213"/&gt;

Most important was the political role. Churches hosted protest meetings, rallies, and Republican party conventions. Prominent laymen and ministers negotiated political deals, and often ran for office until disfranchisement took effect in the 1890s. In the 1880s, the prohibition of liquor was a major political concern that allowed for collaboration with like-minded white Protestants.  In every case, the pastor was the dominant decision-maker. His salary ranged from $400 a year to upwards of $1500, plus housing – at a time when 50 cents a day was good pay for unskilled physical labor.&lt;ref name="Howard N. Rabinowitz 1978 pp 208-213"/&gt;

Increasingly the Methodists reached out to college or seminary graduates for their ministers, but most Baptists felt that education was a negative factor that undercut the intense religiosity and oratorical skills they demanded of their ministers.&lt;ref name="Howard N. Rabinowitz 1978 pp 208-213"/&gt;

After 1910, as blacks migrated to major cities in both the North and the South, there emerged the pattern of a few very large churches with thousands of members and a paid staff, headed by an influential preacher. At the same time there were many "storefront" churches with a few dozen members.&lt;ref&gt;Gunnar Myrdal, ''An American Dilemma'' (1944) pp 858-78&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious interpretation of history===
Deeply religious Southerners saw the hand of God in history, which demonstrated His wrath at their sinfulness, or His rewards for their suffering. Historian Wilson Fallin has examined the sermons of white and black Baptist preachers after the War. Southern white preachers said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;God had chastised them and given them a special mission&amp;nbsp;– to maintain orthodoxy, strict biblicism, personal piety, and traditional race relations. Slavery, they insisted, had not been sinful. Rather, emancipation was a historical tragedy and the end of Reconstruction was a clear sign of God's favor.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In sharp contrast, Black preachers interpreted the Civil War as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;God's gift of freedom. They appreciated opportunities to exercise their independence, to worship in their own way, to affirm their worth and dignity, and to proclaim the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man. Most of all, they could form their own churches, associations, and conventions. These institutions offered self-help and racial uplift, and provided places where the gospel of liberation could be proclaimed. As a result, black preachers continued to insist that God would protect and help him; God would be their rock in a stormy land.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson Fallin Jr.,  ''Uplifting the People: Three Centuries of Black Baptists in Alabama'' (2007) pp 52-53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Deteriorating status==
{{Further|Nadir of American race relations}}
After 1880, legal conditions worsened for blacks, and they were almost powerless to resist.&lt;ref&gt;Howard N. Rabinowitz, "From exclusion to segregation: Southern race relations, 1865–1890." ''Journal of American History'' 63#2 (1976): 325-350. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1899640 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; The Northern allies in the Republican Party made an effort in 1890 to stop the deteriorating legal conditions by congressional legislation, but failed.&lt;ref&gt;Richard E. Welch,  "The Federal Elections Bill of 1890: Postscripts and Prelude." ''Journal of American History'' 52#3 (1965): 511-526. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1890845 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Every southern state passed codes requiring segregation in most public places. These persisted until 1964, when they were repealed by Congress. They are known as [[Jim Crow laws]].&lt;ref&gt;Jane Elizabeth Dailey, Glenda Elizabeth Gilmore, and Bryant Simon, ''Jumpin'Jim Crow: Southern politics from civil war to civil rights'' (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;  The Southern states In the 1890–1905 period systematically reduced the number of blacks allowed to vote to about 2% through restrictions that skirted the 15th amendment, because they did not explicitly mention race. These restrictions included literacy requirements, voter-registration laws, and poll taxes.  The U.S. Supreme Court in 1896 ruled in favor of Jim Crow in the case of [[Plessy vs. Ferguson]], declaring that "separate but equal" facilities for blacks were legal under the 14th Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;J. Morgan Kousser, "Plessy v. Ferguson." ''Dictionary of American History'' (2003) 6: 370-371. [http://authors.library.caltech.edu/41166/1/plessy%20v%20ferguson.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jim Crow laws and segregation===
{{Main|Jim Crow laws}}
Typically in the [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]] across the seven states of the lower South in 1866 intermarriage was illegal.  The new Republican legislatures in six states repealed the restrictive laws. After the Democrats returned to power, the restriction was reimposed. Not until 1967 did the United States Supreme Court, in [[Loving v. Virginia]] rule that all provisions like it in 16 states were unconstitutional.  A major concern in the 1860s was how to draw the line between black and white in a society in which white men and black slave women had fathered numerous children. On the one hand, a person's reputation, as black or white, was usually decisive.  On the other hand, most laws used a "one drop of blood" criteria to the effect that one black ancestor legally put a person  in the Black category.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Wallenstein, "Reconstruction, Segregation, and Miscegenation: Interracial Marriage and the Law in the Lower South, 1865–1900." ''American Nineteenth Century History'' 6#1 (2005): 57-76.&lt;/ref&gt;  Legal segregation was imposed only in schooling, and marriage, but that changed in 1880s when new Jim Crow laws mandated the physical separation of the races in public places.&lt;ref&gt;C. Vann Woodward, ''The strange career of Jim Crow'' (1955; 3rd ed. 1974) [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=vQHg5oBavmYC  online]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1890 to 1908, southern states effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised]] most black voters and many poor whites by making voter registration more difficult through [[Poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]], [[literacy test]]s, and other arbitrary devices. They passed segregation laws and imposed second-class status on blacks in a system known as [[Jim Crow Laws|Jim Crow]] that lasted until the [[African-American civil rights movement (1954–1968)|successes of the civil rights movement in 1964–65]]&lt;ref&gt;Howard Sitkoff, ''The Struggle for Black Equality'' (3rd ed. 2008) ch 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Political activities on behalf of equality often centered around transportation issues, such as segregation on streetcars and railroads.&lt;ref&gt;Roger A. Fischer, "A pioneer protest: the New Orleans street-car controversy of 1867." ''Journal of Negro History'' 53#3 (1968): 219-233. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2716217 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1850s, lawsuits were filed against segregated streetcars and railroads in both the [[Northern United States|North]] and South.

===Lynching===
{{main|Lynching in the United States}}
Lynch mob attacks on blacks, especially in the South, rose at the end of the 19th century. The perpetrators were rarely or never arrested or convicted. Nearly 3,500 [[African American]]s and 1,300 whites were [[Lynching in the United States|lynched in the United States]], mostly from 1882 to 1901.  The peak year was 1892.&lt;ref&gt;see {{cite web |url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/shipp/lynchingsstate.html |title=Lynchings: By State and Race, 1882-1968 |accessdate=July 26, 2010 |quote=Statistics provided by the Archives at Tuskegee Institute. |publisher=University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100629081241/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/shipp/lynchingsstate.html |archive-date=2010-06-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}; also [http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/shipp/lynchingyear.html Lynchings by year]&lt;/ref&gt;

The frequency of lynchings and the episodes that sparked them varied from state to state as functions of local race relations. Lynching was higher in the context of worsening economic conditions for poor rural whites in heavily black counties, especially the low price of cotton in the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;W. Fitzhugh Brundage, ''Lynching in the new South'' (1993) pp. 103-190.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elwood M. Beck and Stewart E. Tolnay. "The killing fields of the deep south: the market for cotton and the lynching of blacks, 1882–1930." ''American Sociological Review'' (1990): 526-539.  [http://utminers.utep.edu/trcurry/Lynching%20article.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ida B. Wells]] (1862–1931) used her newspaper in Memphis Tennessee to attack lynchings; fearful for her life, she fled to the more peaceful precincts of Chicago in 1892 where she continued her one-person crusade.&lt;ref&gt;Jacqueline Jones Royster, ed., ''Southern horrors and other writings: The anti-lynching campaign of Ida B. Wells, 1892–1900'' (1997), with primary and secondary documents.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nationally organized opposition to lynching began with the formation of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) in 1909. There were 82 lynchings in 1909, and 10 in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Zangrando, ''The NAACP crusade against lynching, 1909–1950'' (1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public images===
In the mainstream national and local media of the late 19th century, "Blacks were persistently stereotyped as criminals, savages, or comic figures. They were superstitious, lazy, violent, immoral, the butt of humor, and the source of danger to civilized life." &lt;ref&gt;Eric Foner,  "Introduction," to  Rayford W. Logan ''The Betrayal of the Negro, from Rutherford B. Hayes to Woodrow Wilson'' (1997). [https://books.google.com/books?id=b0OQi4wQApMC&amp;pg=PR14 p. xiv online].  Foner's 1997 introduction is paraphrasing the 1965 2nd edition of Logan's book.&lt;/ref&gt;  Booker T. Washington, the young college president from Alabama, became famous for his articulate challenges to the extremely negative stereotypes. According to his biographer Robert J. Norrell, Washington:
:challenged the ideological positions of white Southerners on several fronts. His emphasis on black progress countered the white supremacists insistence on black degeneracy and criminality. His declaration of affection and loyalty to white Southerners defied the white nationalists believe that all blacks were ethnic enemies. The same time, Washington demonstrated to white Northerners that he and his fellow blacks were loyal, patriotic Americans, the rightful and deserving inheritors of Lincoln's interpretation of democratic values....African-Americans accepted the inherently competitive nature of American society and wanted only a fair chance to prove themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert J. Norrel|title=The House I Live In : Race in the American Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DNiYbpqfqScC&amp;pg=PA50|year=2005|publisher=Oxford UP|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership==
Much of the black political leadership in this area came from the ministry, and from Union Civil War veterans. The white political leadership featured veterans and lawyers. Ambitious young black men had a difficult time becoming lawyers, with few exceptions such as [[James T. Rapier]],  [[Aaron Alpeoria Bradley]] and [[John Mercer Langston]].

The upper class among the black population was largely [[mulatto]] and had been free before the war. During Reconstruction, 19 of the 22 black members of Congress were mulattoes. These wealthier, mixed-race blacks represented the majority of the leaders in the civil rights movement of the 20th century as well.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald W. Walters and Robert C. Smith, ''African American Leadership'' (1999) p 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Hahn reports that the mulatto element held disproportionate power in the black political community in South Carolina and Louisiana.&lt;ref&gt;Hahn, ''A nation under our feet'' (2003) p 261.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the leaders, however, were also dark-skinned and former slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Howard N. Rabinowitz, ''Race, Ethnicity, and Urbanization: Selected Essays'' (1994), p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anna J. Cooper===
In 1892, [[Anna J. Cooper]] (1858–1964) published ''A Voice from the South: By A Woman from the South''.  It led to many speeches where she called for civil rights and woman's rights.&lt;ref name=Washington&gt;{{cite book|last=Washington|first=Mary Helen|title=A Voice from the South: Introduction|year=1988|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-506323-6|pages=xxvii–liv}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''A Voice from the South'' was one of the first articulations of [[Black feminism]]. The book advanced a vision of self-determination through education and social uplift for African-American women. Its central thesis was that the educational, moral, and spiritual progress of black women would improve the general standing of the entire African-American community. She says that the violent natures of men often run counter to the goals of higher education, so it is important to foster more female intellectuals because they will bring more elegance to education.&lt;ref name=Ritchie&gt;{{cite book|last=Ritchie|first=Joy|title=Available Means: An Anthology of Women's Rhetoric(s)|year=2001|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|location=Pittsburgh, PA|isbn=978-0-8229-5753-9|pages=163–164|author2=Kate Ronald}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view was criticized by some as submissive to the 19th-century [[Cult of Domesticity|cult of true womanhood]], but others label it as one of the most important arguments for black feminism in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=Ritchie /&gt; Cooper advanced the view that it was the duty of educated and successful black women to support their underprivileged peers in achieving their goals. The essays in ''A Voice from the South'' also touched on a variety of topics, from racism and the socioeconomic realities of black families to the administration of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]]. 
[[file:Frederick Douglass (circa 1879).jpg|thumb|Frederick Douglass, (1818–1895)]]

===Frederick Douglass===
[[Frederick Douglass]] (1818–1895), an escaped slave, was a tireless [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] before the war. He was an author, publisher, lecturer and diplomat afterward. His biographer argues:
:The most influential African American of the nineteenth century, Douglass made a career of agitating the American conscience. He spoke and wrote on behalf of a variety of reform causes: women's rights, temperance, peace, land reform, free public education, and the abolition of capital punishment. But he devoted the bulk of his time, immense talent, and boundless energy to ending slavery and gaining equal rights for African Americans. These were the central concerns of his long reform career. Douglass understood that the struggle for emancipation and equality demanded forceful, persistent, and unyielding agitation. And he recognized that African Americans must play a conspicuous role in that struggle. Less than a month before his death, when a young black man solicited his advice to an African American just starting out in the world, Douglass replied without hesitation: "Agitate! Agitate! Agitate!&lt;ref&gt;Roy E. Finkenbine. "Douglass, Frederick"; [http://www.anb.org/articles/15/15-00186.html ''American National Biography Online'' 2000. Accessed March 16, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Update|reason=economics has changed with falling cost of renewables|date=November 2018}}

'''Clean coal technology''' is a collection of technologies being developed to attempt to help lessen the [[environmental impact of coal|environmental impact of coal energy generation]] and to mitigate worldwide [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/coalvswind/c01.html |publisher=Union of Concerned Scientists |title= Coal vs. Wind |accessdate=2008-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; When coal is used as a fuel source, the gaseous emissions generated by the thermal decomposition of the coal include [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[nitrogen oxides]] (NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;), mercury, and other chemical byproducts that vary depending on the type of the coal being used. These emissions have been established to have a negative impact on the environment and human health, contributing to acid rain, lung cancer and cardiovascular disease. As a result, clean coal technologies are being developed to remove or reduce pollutant emissions to the atmosphere. Some of the techniques that would be used to accomplish this include chemically washing [[mineral]]s and impurities from the coal, [[gasification]] (see also [[Integrated gasification combined cycle|IGCC]]), improved technology for treating [[flue]] gases to remove pollutants to increasingly stringent levels and at higher efficiency, [[carbon capture and storage]] technologies to capture the carbon dioxide from the [[flue gas]] and dewatering lower rank coals ([[brown coal]]s) to improve the [[calorific value]], and thus the efficiency of the conversion into [[electricity]].  Concerns exist regarding the economic viability of these technologies and the timeframe of delivery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/30/fossilfuels-carbonemissions |publisher=The Guardian |title=Time to bury the ‘clean coal’ myth |accessdate=2008-12-23 | location=London | date=2008-10-30 | first=Fred | last=Pearce}}&lt;/ref&gt; potentially high hidden economic costs in terms of social and [[environmental degradation|environmental damage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/international/press/reports/cost-of-coal.pdf |publisher=Greenpeace |title=The True Cost of Coal |accessdate=2008-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the costs and viability of disposing of removed carbon and other toxic matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/ccs/ |publisher=University of Edinburgh, School of Geosciences |title=Carbon Capture and Storage |accessdate=2008-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219221240/http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/ccs |archivedate=2007-02-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2008/07/02/carbon-capture-storage.html |publisher=Discovery Channel |title=Carbon Capture Plans get Reality Check |accessdate=2008-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its original usage, the term "Clean Coal" was used to refer to technologies that were designed to reduce emission of pollutants associated with burning coal, such as washing coal at the mine.  This step removes some of the sulfur and other contaminants, including rocks and soil.  This makes coal cleaner and cheaper to transport.  More recently, the definition of clean coal has been expanded to include carbon capture and storage.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Silent Epidemic: Coal and the Hidden Threat to Health|last=Lockwood|first=Alan|publisher=The MIT Press|year=2012|isbn=9780262017893|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=2–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Clean coal technology usually addresses atmospheric problems resulting from burning coal.  Historically, the primary focus was on SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, the most important gases in causation of [[acid rain]], and particulates which cause visible air pollution and have [[Coal#Health effects|deleterious effects on human health]]. 

==Technology==
Several different technological methods are available for the purpose of carbon capture as demanded by  the clean coal concept:
*Pre-combustion capture – This involves [[gasification]] of a feedstock (such as coal) to form [[synthesis gas]], which may be [[water-gas shift reaction|shifted]] to produce a H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-[[rich burn|rich gas mixture]], from which the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be efficiently captured and separated, transported, and ultimately sequestered,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pre-combustion Carbon Capture Research|url=http://energy.gov/fe/science-innovation/carbon-capture-and-storage-research/carbon-capture-rd/pre-combustion-carbon|website=Energy.gov|publisher=Office of Fossil Energy, U.S. Department of Energy|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technology is usually associated with [[Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle]] process configurations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.technologyreview.com/Energy/18398/|title= Picking a Winner in Clean-Coal Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Post-combustion capture – This refers to capture of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from exhaust gases of combustion processes.
*[[Oxy-fuel combustion]] – Fossil fuels such as coal are burned in a mixture of recirculated [[flue gas]] and oxygen, rather than in air, which largely eliminates nitrogen from the flue gas enabling efficient, low-cost CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=R&amp;D Facts - Oxy-Fuel Combustion|url=http://www.netl.doe.gov/publications/factsheets/rd/R&amp;D127.pdf|publisher=National Energy Technology Laboratory, U.S. Department of Energy|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Kemper Project|Kemper County IGCC Project]], a proposed 582 [[Watt#Megawatt|MW]] [[coal gasification]]-based power plant, was expected to use pre-combustion capture of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to capture 65% of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; the plant produces, which would have been utilized and geologically sequestered in [[enhanced oil recovery]] operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IGCC Project Examples - Kemper County IGCC Project|url=http://www.netl.doe.gov/research/Coal/energy-systems/gasification/gasifipedia/project-examples#kemper|website=Gasifipedia|publisher=National Energy Technology Laboratory, U.S. Department of Energy|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, after many delays and a cost runup to $7.5 billion (triple the initial budget), the coal gasification project was abandoned and as of late 2017, Kemper is under construction as a cheaper [[natural gas]] power plant.&lt;ref name='ars_nat_gas_2017'&gt;{{cite news|last1=Geuss|first1=Megan|title=$7.5 billion Kemper power plant suspends coal gasification|url=https://arstechnica.com/business/2017/06/7-5-billion-kemper-power-plant-suspends-coal-gasification/ |publisher=Ars Technica|date=2017-06-29 |accessdate=2017-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Saskatchewan Government's [[Boundary Dam Power Station|Boundary Dam Integrated Carbon Capture and Sequestration Demonstration Project]] will use post-combustion, amine-based scrubber technology to capture 90% of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emitted by Unit 3 of the power plant; this CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will be pipelined to and utilized for enhanced oil recovery in the Weyburn oil fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boundary Dam Integrated Carbon Capture and Sequestration Demonstration Project|url=http://www.globalccsinstitute.com/project/boundary-dam-integrated-carbon-capture-and-sequestration-demonstration-project|publisher=Global CCS Institute|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Oxyfuel CCS fossil fuel power plant operation.png|thumb|right|An oxyfuel CCS power plant operation processes the exhaust gases so as to separate the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; so that it may be stored or sequestered]]
An early example of a coal-based plant using (oxy-fuel) carbon-capture technology is Swedish company [[Vattenfall]]’s [[Schwarze Pumpe power station]] located in [[Spremberg]], [[Germany]], built by German firm [[Siemens]], which went on-line in September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vattenfall.com/www/co2_en/co2_en/index.jsp |publisher=Vattenfall |title=Vattenfall's Project on CSS |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101026074817/http://www2.vattenfall.com/www/co2_en/co2_en/index.jsp |archivedate=2010-10-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="discovermagazine"/&gt; The facility captures CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and acid rain producing pollutants, separates them, and compresses the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into a liquid. Plans are to inject the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into depleted natural gas fields or other geological formations. Vattenfall opines that this technology is considered not to be a final solution for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction in the atmosphere, but provides an achievable solution in the near term while more desirable alternative solutions to power generation can be made economically practical.&lt;ref name="discovermagazine"&gt;http://discovermagazine.com/2009/feb/25-can-clean-coal-actually-work/?searchterm=clean%20coal "Can Clean Coal Actually Work?" article in Feb. 2009 issue, p. 18, Retrieved 2009-05-11&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples of oxy-combustion carbon capture are in progress. [[Callide Power Station]] has retrofitted a 30-MWth existing PC-fired power plant to operate in oxy-fuel mode; in Ciuden, Spain, Endesa has a newly built 30-MWth oxy-fuel plant using circulating fluidized bed combustion (CFBC) technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview of Oxy-fuel Combustion Technology for CO2 Capture|url=http://cornerstonemag.net/overview-of-oxy-fuel-combustion-technology-for-co2-capture/|website=Cornerstone Magazine|publisher=World Coal Association|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Babcock-ThermoEnergy's Zero Emission Boiler System (ZEBS) is oxy-combustion-based; this system features near 100% carbon-capture and according to company information virtually no air-emissions.&lt;ref&gt;[leads nowhere previously cited - http://ww25.thermoenergy.com/Zm9yY2VTUg]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other carbon capture and storage technologies include those that [[Dewatering|dewater]] low-rank coals. [[Coal rank|Low-rank coals]] often contain a higher level of moisture content which contains a lower energy content per tonne. This causes a reduced burning efficiency and an increased emissions output. Reduction of moisture from the coal prior to combustion can reduce emissions by up to 50 percent.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

The UK government is working towards a clean energy future and supported clean coal projects across the country. In August 2010, UK-based company [[B9 Coal]] announced a clean coal project with 90% carbon capture to be put forward to DECC. This proposed project was to create pure streams of hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The hydrogen was then to be used as an emissions-free fuel to run an [[AFC Energy|alkaline fuel cell]] whilst the carbon dioxide was to be captured.

==Demonstration projects in the United States==
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) began conducting a joint program with the industry and State agencies to demonstrate clean coal technologies large enough for commercial use. The program, called the Clean Coal Technology &amp; Clean Coal Power Initiative (CCPI), has had a number of successes that have reduced emissions and waste from coal-based electricity generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://energy.gov/fe/science-innovation/clean-coal-research/major-demonstrations/clean-coal-power-initiative | publisher= U.S. Department of Energy | title= Clean Coal Technology &amp; The Clean Coal Power Initiative }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Energy Technology Laboratory]] has administered three rounds of CCPI funding and the following projects were selected during each round:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.netl.doe.gov/technologies/coalpower/cctc/ccpi/index.html# |title= Major Demonstrations: Clean Coal Power Initiative (CCPI) |publisher= NETL |accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These programs have helped to meet regulatory challenges by incorporating pollution control technologies into a portfolio of cost-effective regulatory compliance options for conventional and developmental coal-fired power plants. This portfolio has positioned the U.S. as a top exporter of clean coal technologies such as those used for SOx, NOx and mercury, and more recently for carbon capture, consistent with a goal of deploying advanced coal-based power systems in commercial service with improved efficiency and environmental performance to meet increasingly stringent environmental regulations and market demands, leading to widespread, global deployment which will contribute to significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. The DOE continues its programs and initiatives through regional sequestration partnerships, a carbon sequestration leadership forum and the Carbon Sequestration Core Program, a CCS research and development program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.fossil.energy.gov/programs/sequestration/index.html | publisher=U.S. Department of Energy | title= Carbon Sequestration }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a report by the assistant secretary for fossil energy at the U.S. Department of Energy, clean coal technology has paid measurable dividends. Technological innovation introduced through the CCT Program now provides consumers cost-effective, clean, coal-based energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://fossil.energy.gov/programs/powersystems/publications/Clean_Coal_Topical_Reports/Investment_pays_off.pdf | publisher= U.S. Department of Energy | title= Clean Coal Technology: The Investment Pays Off}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clean coal and the environment==
{{Further|Environmental effects of coal}}

According to [[United Nations]] [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]], the burning of coal, a [[fossil fuel]], is a major contributor to  [[global warming]]. (See the UN [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]]).  As 26% of the world's electrical generation in 2004 was from coal-fired generation (see [[World energy resources and consumption]]), reaching the carbon dioxide reduction targets of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] will require modifications to how coal is utilized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ncseonline.org/NLE/CRSreports/Climate/clim-2.cfm?&amp;CFID=1255395&amp;CFTOKEN=96369856 |title= CRS Issue Brief for Congress - IB89005: Global Climate Change |publisher= National Council for Science and the Environment |date= August 13, 2001 |accessdate= 2008-09-13 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081226020613/http://www.ncseonline.org/NLE/CRSreports/Climate/clim-2.cfm?&amp;CFID=1255395&amp;CFTOKEN=96369856 |archivedate= December 26, 2008 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coal, which is primarily used for the generation of electricity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/coal/page/special/feature.html| publisher= Energy Information Administration | title=U.S. Coal Supply and Demand | accessdate=2009-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the second largest domestic contributor to carbon dioxide emissions in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cdiac.ornl.gov/trends/emis_mon/emis_mon_co2.html |title=Estimates of Monthly CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Emissions and Associated &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C/&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; Values from Fossil-Fuel Consumption in the U.S.A. | accessdate=2009-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public has become more concerned about global warming which has led to new legislation.  The coal industry has responded by running advertising touting clean coal in an effort to counter negative perceptions and claiming  more than $50 billion towards the development and deployment of "traditional" clean coal technologies over the past 30 years; and promising $500 million towards carbon capture and storage research and development.&lt;ref name="ACCCE"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.americaspower.org/News/Press-Room/Press-Releases/ACCCE-Details-More-than-80-CO2-Capture-and-Storage-Projects | publisher= America's Power | title=ACCCE Details More than 80 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Capture and Storage Projects | accessdate=2009-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is still concern about clean coal technology being perceived as more environmentally friendly than it is, and the term "Clean Coal" has been used as an example of "[[greenwashing]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morris|first=Louise|date=2008-12-01|title=Greenwashing Coal|url=|journal=Chain Reaction|volume=104|pages=25|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Sierra Club, "Despite the industry's hype, there's no such thing as 'clean coal.' But new technologies and policies can help reduce coal plants' deadly emissions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vault.sierraclub.org/sierra/200701/coal.asp|title=Can Coal Be Clean|last=Snell|first=Marilyn|date=January–February 2007|website=Sierra Club|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conjunction with enhanced oil recovery and other applications; commercial-scale CCS is currently being tested in the U.S. and other countries.{{by whom|date=November 2010}} Proposed CCS sites are subjected to extensive investigation and monitoring to avoid potential hazards, which could include leakage of sequestered CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to the atmosphere, induced geological instability, or contamination of water sources such as oceans and aquifers used for drinking water supplies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awwa.org/publications/MainStreamArticle.cfm?itemnumber=39815 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302185350/http://www.awwa.org/publications/MainStreamArticle.cfm?itemnumber=39815 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=March 2, 2009 |title=AWWA warns Congress about CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; injection concerns |publisher=American Water Works Association |date=July 29, 2008 |accessdate=2008-08-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ohvec.org/links/news/archive/2005/fair_use/10_16.html |title=‘Clean coal’ push concerns environmental activists |publisher=Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition |date=October 16, 2005 |accessdate=2008-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/green-science/clean-coal.htm|title=What is clean coal technology?|date=2007-07-18|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2018-05-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Great Plains Synfuels plant supports the technical feasibility of carbon dioxide sequestration. Carbon dioxide from the coal gasification is shipped to Canada where it is injected into the ground to aid in oil recovery. A drawback of the carbon sequestration process is that it is expensive compared to traditional processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |ssrn=1300126 |publisher=SSRN | title=Carbonomics: How to Fix the Climate and Charge it to OPEC |accessdate=2009-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clean coal and health ==
Both traditional coal technology and clean coal technologies result in a release of hazardous air pollutants and many of them have an adverse affect on human health.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  According to Alan H. Lockwood, MD, coal is linked to diseases of the Respiratory System, Cardiovascular System, and Nervous System.  A key point that Dr. Lockwood brings up is that “the most obvious threats to health posed by the carbon capture and storage strategies… would occur in the event of the release of large amounts of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  The potential releases could occur at any of the stages: at the site of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture, during transport, or transfer… or escape during or after storage.” Dr. Lockwood goes on to explain that this can lead to “symptoms of death by displacing oxygen from inhaled air, leading to hypoxia and asphyxiation, or by causing symptomatic or fatal acidification of the blood and body fluids after inhalation” &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Common knowledge''' is a special kind of [[knowledge]] for a group of [[wiktionary:agent|agent]]s. There is ''common knowledge'' of ''p'' in a group of agents ''G'' when all the agents in ''G'' know ''p'', they all know that they know ''p'', they all know that they all know that they know ''p'', and so on ''ad infinitum''.&lt;ref name=Osborne&gt;Osborne, Martin J., and [[Ariel Rubinstein]]. ''A Course in Game Theory''. Cambridge, MA: MIT, 1994. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept was first introduced in the philosophical literature by [[David Kellogg Lewis]] in his study ''Convention'' (1969).  The sociologist Morris Friedell defined common knowledge in a 1969 paper.&lt;ref&gt;Morris Friedell, "On the Structure of Shared Awareness," Behavioral Science 14 (1969): 28–39.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was first given a mathematical formulation in a [[set theory|set-theoretical]] framework by [[Robert Aumann]] (1976). [[computer science|Computer scientists]] grew an interest in the subject of [[epistemic logic]] in general&amp;nbsp;– and of common knowledge in particular&amp;nbsp;– starting in the 1980s.{{ref|CSTexts}}  There are numerous [[Logic puzzle|puzzles]] based upon the concept which have been extensively investigated by mathematicians such as [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Math Hysteria| author=Ian Stewart |year=2004 |publisher=OUP |chapter=I Know That You Know That... |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[Stephen Schiffer]], in his book ''Meaning'', independently developed a notion he called "mutual knowledge" which functions quite similarly to Lewis's "common knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Schiffer, ''Meaning'', 2nd edition, Oxford University Press, 1988.  The first edition was published by OUP in 1972.  For a discussion of both Lewis's and Schiffer's notions, see Russell Dale, ''[http://www.russelldale.com/dissertation/1996.RussellDale.TheTheoryOfMeaning.pdf The Theory of Meaning]'' (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example ==

=== Puzzle ===

The idea of common knowledge is often introduced by some variant of the following puzzle:{{ref|Sevitan}}

On an island, there are ''k'' people who have blue eyes, and the rest of the people have green eyes. At the start of the puzzle, no one on the island ever knows their own eye color. By rule, if a person on the island ever discovers they have blue eyes, that person must leave the island at dawn; anyone not making such a discovery always sleeps until after dawn. On the island, each person knows every other person's eye color, there are no reflective surfaces, and there is no communication of eye color.

At some point, an outsider comes to the island, calls together all the people on the island, and makes the following public announcement: "At least one of you has blue eyes". The outsider, furthermore, is known by all to be truthful, and all know that all know this, and so on: it is common knowledge that he is truthful, and thus it becomes common knowledge that there is at least one islander who has blue eyes. The problem: assuming all persons on the island are completely logical and that this too is common knowledge, what is the eventual outcome?

=== Solution ===

The answer is that, on the ''k''th dawn after the announcement, all the blue-eyed people will leave the island.

==== Proof ====
The solution can be seen with an inductive argument. If ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 (that is, there is exactly one blue-eyed person), the person will recognize that they alone have blue eyes (by seeing only green eyes in the others) and leave at the first dawn. If ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, no one will leave at the first dawn. The two blue-eyed people, seeing only one person with blue eyes, ''and'' that no one left on the 1st dawn (and thus that ''k''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1), will leave on the second dawn. Inductively, it can be reasoned that no one will leave at the first ''k''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 dawns if and only if there are at least ''k'' blue-eyed people. Those with blue eyes, seeing ''k''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 blue-eyed people among the others and knowing there must be at least ''k'', will reason that they must have blue eyes and leave.

What's most interesting about this scenario is that, for ''k''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1, the outsider is only telling the island citizens what they already know: that there are blue-eyed people among them. However, before this fact is announced, the fact is not ''common knowledge''.

For ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, it is merely "first-order" knowledge. Each blue-eyed person knows that there is someone with blue eyes, but each blue eyed person does ''not'' know that the other blue-eyed person has this same knowledge.

For ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3, it is "second order" knowledge. Each blue-eyed person knows that a second blue-eyed person knows that a third person has blue eyes, but no one knows that there is a ''third'' blue-eyed person with that knowledge, until the outsider makes his statement.

In general: For ''k''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1, it is "(''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)th order" knowledge. Each blue-eyed person knows that a second blue-eyed person knows that a third blue-eyed person knows that.... (repeat for a total of ''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 levels) a ''k''th person has blue eyes, but no one knows that there is a "''k''th" blue-eyed person with that knowledge, until the outsider makes his statement. The notion of ''common knowledge'' therefore has a palpable effect. Knowing that everyone knows does make a difference. When the outsider's public announcement (a fact already known to all) becomes common knowledge, the blue-eyed people on this island eventually deduce their status, and leave.

== Formalization ==

=== Modal logic (syntactic characterization) ===

Common knowledge can be given a logical definition in [[Modal logic|multi-modal logic]] systems in which the modal operators are interpreted [[epistemic logic|epistemically]]. At the propositional level, such systems are extensions of [[propositional logic]]. The extension consists of the introduction of a group ''G'' of ''agents'', and of ''n'' modal operators ''K&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' (with ''i'' = 1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''n'') with the intended meaning that "agent ''i'' knows." Thus ''K&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;'' (where &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is a formula of the calculus) is read "agent ''i'' knows &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;." We can define an operator ''E&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;'' with the intended meaning of "everyone in group ''G'' knows" by defining it with the axiom

: &lt;math&gt;E_G \varphi \Leftrightarrow \bigwedge_{i \in G} K_i \varphi,&lt;/math&gt;

By abbreviating the expression &lt;math&gt;E_GE_G^{n-1} \varphi&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;E_G^n \varphi&lt;/math&gt;  and defining &lt;math&gt;E_G^0 \varphi = \varphi&lt;/math&gt;, we could then define common knowledge with the axiom

: &lt;math&gt;C \varphi \Leftrightarrow \bigwedge_{i = 0}^\infty E^i \varphi&lt;/math&gt;

There is however a complication. The languages of epistemic logic are usually ''finitary'', whereas the [[axiom]] above defines common knowledge as an infinite conjunction of formulas, hence not a [[well-formed formula]] of the language. To overcome this difficulty, a ''fixed-point'' definition of common knowledge can be given. Intuitively, common knowledge is thought of as the fixed point of the "equation" &lt;math&gt;C_G \varphi=\varphi\wedge E_G (C_G \varphi)&lt;/math&gt;. In this way, it is possible to find a formula &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; implying &lt;math&gt;E_G (\varphi \wedge C_G \varphi)&lt;/math&gt; from which, in the limit, we can infer common knowledge of &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;.

This ''syntactic'' characterization is given semantic content through so-called ''Kripke structures''. A Kripke structure is given by (i) a set of states (or possible worlds) ''S'', (ii) ''n'' ''accessibility relations'' &lt;math&gt;R_1,\dots,R_n&lt;/math&gt;, defined on &lt;math&gt;S \times S&lt;/math&gt;, intuitively representing what states agent ''i'' considers possible from any given state, and (iii) a valuation function &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; assigning a [[truth value]], in each state, to each primitive proposition in the language. The semantics for the knowledge operator is given by stipulating that &lt;math&gt;K_i \varphi&lt;/math&gt; is true at state ''s'' iff &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is true at ''all'' states ''t'' such that &lt;math&gt;(s,t) \in R_i&lt;/math&gt;. The semantics for the common knowledge operator, then, is given by taking, for each group of agents ''G'', the reflexive and transitive closure of the &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt;, for all agents ''i'' in ''G'', call such a relation &lt;math&gt;R_G&lt;/math&gt;, and stipulating that &lt;math&gt;C_G \varphi&lt;/math&gt; is true at state ''s'' iff &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is true at ''all'' states ''t'' such that &lt;math&gt;(s,t) \in R_G&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Set theoretic (semantic characterization) ===

Alternatively (yet equivalently) common knowledge can be formalized using [[set theory]] (this was the path taken by the Nobel laureate  [[Robert Aumann]] in his seminal 1976 paper).  We will start with a set of states ''S''.  We can then define an event ''E'' as a subset of the set of states ''S''.  For each agent ''i'', define a [[Partition of a set|partition]] on ''S'', ''P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''.  This partition represents the state of knowledge of an agent in a state.  In state ''s'', agent ''i'' knows that one of the states in ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''s'') obtains, but not which one. (Here ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''s'') denotes the unique element of ''P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' containing ''s''. Note that this model excludes cases in which agents know things that are not true.)

We can now define a knowledge function ''K'' in the following way:

: &lt;math&gt;K_i(e) = \{ s \in S \mid P_i(s) \subset e\}&lt;/math&gt;

That is, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''e'') is the set of states where the agent will know that event ''e'' obtains. It is a subset of ''e''.

Similar to the modal logic formulation above, we can define an operator for the idea that "everyone knows ''e''".

: &lt;math&gt;E(e) = \bigcap_i K_i(e)&lt;/math&gt;

As with the modal operator, we will iterate the ''E'' function, &lt;math&gt;E^1(e) = E(e)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E^{n+1}(e) = E(E^{n}(e))&lt;/math&gt;.  Using this we can then define a common knowledge function,

: &lt;math&gt;C(e) = \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} E^n(e).&lt;/math&gt;

The equivalence with the syntactic approach sketched above can easily be seen: consider an Aumann structure as the one just defined. We can define a correspondent Kripke structure by taking (i) the same space ''S'', (ii) accessibility relations &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt; that define the equivalence classes corresponding to the partitions &lt;math&gt;P_i&lt;/math&gt;, and (iii) a valuation function such that it yields value ''true'' to the primitive proposition ''p'' in all and only the states ''s'' such that &lt;math&gt;s \in E^p&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;E^p&lt;/math&gt; is the event of the Aumann structure corresponding to the primitive proposition ''p''. It is not difficult to see that the common knowledge accessibility function &lt;math&gt;R_G&lt;/math&gt; defined in the previous section corresponds to the finest common coarsening of the partitions &lt;math&gt;P_i&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;i \in G&lt;/math&gt;, which is the finitary characterization of common knowledge also given by Aumann in the 1976 article.

== Applications ==

Common knowledge was used by David Lewis in his pioneering game-theoretical account of convention. In this sense, common knowledge is a concept still central for linguists and philosophers of language (see Clark 1996) maintaining a Lewisian, conventionalist account of language.

[[Robert Aumann]] introduced a set theoretical formulation of common knowledge (theoretically equivalent to the one given above) and proved the so-called [[Aumann's agreement theorem|agreement theorem]] through which: if two agents have common [[prior probability]] over a certain event, and the [[posterior probabilities]] are common knowledge, then such posterior probabilities are equal. A result based on the agreement theorem and proven by Milgrom shows that, given certain conditions on market efficiency and information, speculative trade is impossible.

The concept of common knowledge is central in [[game theory]]. For several years it has been thought that the assumption of common knowledge of rationality for the players in the game was fundamental. It turns out (Aumann and Brandenburger 1995) that, in 2-player games, common knowledge of rationality is not needed as an epistemic condition for [[Nash equilibrium]] [[strategy (game theory)|strategies]].

Computer scientists use languages incorporating epistemic logics (and common knowledge) to reason about distributed systems. Such systems can be based on logics more complicated than simple propositional epistemic logic, see Wooldridge ''Reasoning about Artificial Agents'', 2000 (in which he uses a first-order logic incorporating epistemic and temporal operators) or van der Hoek et al. "Alternating Time Epistemic Logic".

In his 2007 book,  ''[[The Stuff of Thought|The Stuff of Thought: Language as a Window into Human Nature]],'' [[Steven Pinker]] uses the notion of common knowledge to analyze the kind of indirect speech involved in innuendoes.

A '''connotation''' is a commonly understood [[culture|cultural]] or [[emotional]] association that some word or phrase carries, in addition to its explicit or literal [[meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]], which is its [[denotation]].

A connotation is frequently described as either positive or negative, with regard to its pleasing or displeasing emotional connection. For example, a stubborn person may be described as being either ''strong-willed'' or ''pig-headed''; although these have the same literal meaning (''stubborn''), ''strong-willed'' connotes admiration for the level of someone's will (a positive connotation), while ''pig-headed'' connotes frustration in dealing with someone (a negative connotation).

"Connotation" branches into a mixture of different meanings. These could include the contrast of a word or phrase with its primary, [[Literal and figurative language|literal]] meaning (known as a [[denotation]]), with what that word or phrase specifically denotes. The connotation essentially relates to how anything may be associated with a word or phrase, for example, an implied value judgement or feelings.

It is often useful to avoid words with strong connotations (especially [[pejorative]] or [[wikt:disparaging|disparaging]] ones) when striving to achieve a [[Objectivity (philosophy)|neutral point of view]]. A desire for more positive connotations, or fewer negative ones, is one of the main reasons for using [[euphemism]]s.&lt;ref&gt;
Note that not all theories of [[linguistic meaning]] honor the distinction between literal meaning and (this kind of) connotation. See [[literal and figurative language]].&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Examples==
{|
| [[Image:Cartoony heart.svg|100px|left|Example seven
.]]
The denotation is a [[Representation (arts)|representation]] of a cartoon heart. The connotation is a '''symbol''' of love and affection.
|-
|-
| [[Image:Cartoony red rose.svg|left|100px|right|Example one.]]
The denotation of this example is a red [[rose]] with a green [[Plant stem|stem]]. The connotation is that it is a '''[[symbol]]''' of passion and love – this is what the rose represents.
|-
|}

==Logic==

In [[logic]] and [[semantics]], ''connotation'' is roughly synonymous with ''[[intension]]''. Connotation is often contrasted with ''[[denotation]]'', which is more or less synonymous with ''[[extension (semantics)|extension]]''. Alternatively, the connotation of the word may be thought of as the set of all its possible referents (as opposed to merely the actual ones). A word's ''denotation'' is the collection of things it refers to; its connotation is what it implies about the things it is used to refer to. The denotation of dog is (something like) four-legged canine carnivore. So saying, "You are a dog" would imply that you were ugly or aggressive rather than stating that you were canine.

'''Counter-terrorism''' (also spelled '''counterterrorism''') incorporates the practice, [[military tactics]], techniques, and strategy that government, military, law enforcement, business, and [[Intelligence agency|intelligence agencies]] use to combat or prevent [[terrorism]]. Counter-terrorism strategies include attempts to counter financing of terrorism.

If [[Definitions of terrorism|terrorism]] is part of a broader [[insurgency]], counter-terrorism may employ [[counter-insurgency]] measures. The [[United States Armed Forces]] use the term [[foreign internal defense]] for programs that support other countries in attempts to suppress insurgency, lawlessness, or subversion or to reduce the conditions under which these threats to security may develop.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Introduction to Foreign Internal Defense|url=https://doctrine.af.mil/download.jsp?filename=3-22-D01-FID-Introduction.pdf|journal=Curtis E.

== History ==
[[File:Special Irish Branch.jpg|thumb|right|[[Special Branch]] detectives on an undercover operation at the [[London Docks]], 1911.]]
In response to the escalating [[Fenian dynamite campaign|terror campaign]] in Britain carried out by the militant [[Fenians|Irish Fenians]] in the 1880s, the [[Home Secretary]], [[William Vernon Harcourt (politician)|Sir William Harcourt]], established the first counter-terrorism unit ever. The [[Special Irish Branch]] was initially formed as a section of the [[Criminal Investigation Department]] of the [[Metropolitan Police|London Metropolitan Police]] in 1883, to combat Irish republican terrorism through infiltration and subversion.

Harcourt envisioned a permanent unit dedicated to the prevention of politically motivated violence through the use of modern techniques such as [[undercover operation|undercover infiltration]]. This pioneering branch was the first to be trained in counter-terrorism techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7dMMAQAAQBAJ|title=Counter-Terrorism, Human Rights and the Rule of Law: Crossing Legal Boundaries in Defence of the State|author=Aniceto Masferrer, Clive Walker|year=2013|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|page=294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Planning ==

=== Intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance ===
{{See also|Intelligence cycle management|Intelligence analysis|HUMINT|Counterintelligence}}
Most counter-terrorism strategies involve an increase in standard police and domestic intelligence. The central activities are traditional: [[telephone tapping|interception of communications]], and the tracing of persons. New technology has, however, expanded the range of [[Manhunt (military)|military]] and [[manhunt (law enforcement)|law enforcement]] operations.

[[File:לוחמי הקומנדו הימי.JPG|left|thumb|[[Shayetet 13]], the Israeli naval special forces.]]
Domestic intelligence is often directed at specific groups, defined on the basis of origin or religion, which is a source of political controversy. [[Mass surveillance]] of an entire population raises objections on [[civil liberties]] grounds. [[Homegrown terrorism|Homegrown terrorists]], especially [[Lone-wolf fighter|lone wolves]] are often harder to detect because of their citizenship or legal status and ability to stay under the radar.

To select the effective action when terrorism appears to be more of an isolated event, the appropriate government organizations need to understand the source, motivation, methods of preparation, and tactics of terrorist groups. Good intelligence is at the heart of such preparation, as well as political and social understanding of any grievances that might be solved. Ideally, one gets information from inside the group, a very difficult challenge for [[HUMINT]] because [[Clandestine cell system|operational terrorist cells]] are often small, with all members known to one another, perhaps even related.&lt;ref name=Feiler2007&gt;{{cite journal

[[Counterintelligence]] is a great challenge with the security of cell-based systems, since the ideal, but nearly impossible, goal is to obtain a [[Clandestine HUMINT|clandestine source]] within the cell. Financial tracking can play a role, as can [[SIGINT|communications intercept]], but both of these approaches need to be balanced against legitimate expectations of privacy.

=== Legal contexts ===
{{Main article|Anti-terrorism legislation}}
In response to the growing legislation.
; {{UK}}
* The United Kingdom has had anti-terrorism legislation in place for more than thirty years. The [[Prevention of Violence Act 1939]] was brought in response to an Irish Republican Army (IRA) campaign of violence under the [[S-Plan]]. This act had been allowed to expire in 1953 and was repealed in 1973 to be replaced by the [[Prevention of Terrorism Acts]] a response to [[the Troubles]] in Northern Ireland. From 1974 to 1989 the temporary provisions of the act were renewed annually.
* In 2000 the Acts were replaced with the more permanent [[Terrorism Act 2000]], which contained many of their powers, and then the [[Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005]].
* The [[Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001]] was formally introduced into the Parliament November 19, 2001 two months after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] in the United States. It received royal assent and went into force on December 13, 2001. On December 16, 2004 the Law Lords ruled that Part 4 was incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights, but under the terms of the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] it remained in force. The [[Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005]] was drafted to answer the Law Lords ruling and the [[Terrorism Act 2006]] creates new offences related to terrorism, and amends existing ones. The Act was drafted in the aftermath of the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]], and like its predecessors some of its terms have proven to be highly controversial.

Since 1978 the UK's terrorism laws have been regularly reviewed by a security-cleared [[Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation]], whose often influential reports are submitted to Parliament and published in full.
;{{US}}
* U.S. legal issues surrounding this issue include rulings on the domestic employment of [[deadly force]] by law enforcement organizations.
* Search and seizure is governed by the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].
* The U.S. passed the [[USA PATRIOT Act]] after the September 11 attacks, as well as a range of other legislation and [[executive orders]] relating to national security.
* The [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] was established to consolidate domestic security agencies to coordinate anti-terrorism, as well as national response to major natural disasters and accidents.
* The [[Posse Comitatus Act]] limits domestic employment of the [[United States Army]] and the [[United States Air Force]], requiring Presidential approval prior to deploying the Army and/or the Air Force. [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] policy also applies this limitation to the [[United States Marine Corps]] and the [[United States Navy]], because the Posse Comitatus Act doesn't cover naval services, even though they are federal military forces. The [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] can be employed domestically on Presidential order, as was done during the [[Los Angeles riots of 1992]], [[Hurricane Katrina]], and the [[Beltway Sniper]] incidents.
* External or international use of lethal force would require a [[Presidential finding]].
* In February 2017, sources claimed that the Trump administration intends to rename and revamp the U.S. government program [[Countering Violent Extremism Task Force|Countering Violent Extremism]] (CVE) to solely focus on Islamist extremism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-extremists-program-exclusiv-idUSKBN15G5VO Exclusive: Trump to focus counter-extremism program solely on Islam - sources], Reuters 2017-02-02&lt;/ref&gt;

; {{AUS}}
* Australia has passed several anti-terrorism acts. In 2004, a bill comprising three acts [[Australian anti-terrorism legislation, 2004|Anti-terrorism Act, 2004, (No 2) and (No 3)]] was passed. Then Attorney-General, [[Philip Ruddock]], introduced the ''Anti-terrorism bill, 2004'' on March 31. He described it as ''"a bill to strengthen Australia's counter-terrorism laws in a number of respects&amp;nbsp;– a task made more urgent following the recent tragic [[11 March 2004 Madrid attacks|terrorist bombings in Spain]]."'' He said that Australia's counter-terrorism laws "require review and, where necessary, updating if we are to have a legal framework capable of safeguarding all Australians from the scourge of terrorism." The [[Australian Anti-Terrorism Act 2005]] supplemented the powers of the earlier acts. The Australian legislation allows police to detain suspects for up to two weeks without charge and to electronically track suspects for up to a year. The [[Australian Anti-Terrorism Act 2005#The "Shoot to Kill" Clause|Australian Anti-Terrorism Act of 2005]] included a "shoot-to-kill" clause. In a country with entrenched [[liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] traditions, the measures are controversial and have been criticized by [[civil libertarian]]s and [[Islam]]ic groups. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

; {{ISR}}
* Israel monitors a list of designated [[terrorist organization]]s and has laws forbidding membership in such organizations, funding or helping them in any way.

* In 2016 the Israeli [[Knesset]] passed a comprehensive law against terrorism, forbidding any kind of terrorism and support of terrorism, and setting severe punishments for terrorists. The law also regulate legal efforts against terrorism.&lt;ref name="Israel-ani-terror-law"&gt;{{cite news|title=Terror bill passes into law|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Terror-bill-passes-into-law-456857|accessdate=June 16, 2016|work=[[Jerusalem Post]]|agency=[[Jerusalem Post]]|date=June 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the primary difficulties of implementing effective counter-terrorist measures is the waning of civil liberties and individual privacy that such measures often entail, both for citizens of, and for those detained by states attempting to combat terror.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://icct.nl/publication/accountability-and-transparency-in-the-united-states-counter-terrorism-strategy/ | title=Accountability and Transparency in the United States' Counter-Terrorism Strategy | date=22 January 2015 | publisher=The International Centre for Counter-Terrorism - The Hague (ICCT) | accessdate=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At times, measures designed to tighten security have been seen as [[abuses of power]] or even violations of human rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lydia-canaan/fighting-terrorism-withou_b_9513034.html Lydia Canaan, ''The Huffington Post'', March 21, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of these problems can include prolonged, incommunicado detention without judicial review or long periods of 'preventive detention';&lt;ref&gt;de Londras, Detention in the War on Terrorism: Can Human Rights Fight Back? (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; risk of subjecting to torture during the transfer, return and extradition of people between or within countries; and the adoption of security measures that restrain the rights or freedoms of citizens and breach principles of non-discrimination.&lt;ref name="Human Rights News 2004" /&gt; Examples include:
* In November 2003 [[Malaysia]] passed new counter-terrorism laws that were widely criticized by local human rights groups for being vague and overbroad. Critics claim that the laws put the basic rights of free expression, association, and assembly at risk. Malaysia persisted in holding around 100 alleged militants without trial, including five Malaysian students detained for alleged terrorist activity while studying in Karachi, Pakistan.&lt;ref name="Human Rights News 2004" /&gt;
* In November 2003 a Canadian-Syrian national, Maher Arar, alleged publicly that he had been tortured in a Syrian prison after being handed over to the Syrian authorities by U.S.&lt;ref name="Human Rights News 2004" /&gt;
* In December 2003 Colombia's congress approved legislation that would give the military the power to arrest, tap telephones and carry out searches without warrants or any previous judicial order.&lt;ref name="Human Rights News 2004" /&gt;
* Images of unpopular treatment of detainees in US custody in Iraq and other locations have encouraged international scrutiny of US operations in the war on terror.&lt;ref name="Amnesty International 2005" /&gt;
* Hundreds of foreign nationals remain in prolonged indefinite detention without charge or trial in Guantánamo Bay, despite international and US constitutional standards some groups believe outlaw such practices.&lt;ref name="Amnesty International 2005" /&gt;
* Hundreds of people suspected of connections with the [[Taliban]] or al Qa'eda remain in long-term detention in Pakistan or in US-controlled centers in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="Amnesty International 2005" /&gt;
* China has used the "war on terror" to justify its policies in the predominantly Muslim Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region to stifle Uighur identity.&lt;ref name="Amnesty International 2005" /&gt;
* In Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, Yemen and other countries, scores of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in connection with suspected terrorist acts or links to opposition armed groups.&lt;ref name="Amnesty International 2005" /&gt;
* Until 2005 eleven men remained in high security detention in the UK under the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001.&lt;ref name="Amnesty International 2005" /&gt;

Many would argue that such violations could exacerbate rather than counter the terrorist threat.&lt;ref name="Human Rights News 2004" /&gt; Human rights advocates argue for the crucial role of human rights protection as an intrinsic part to fight against terrorism.&lt;ref name="Amnesty International 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://icct.nl/publication/preventive-counter-terrorism-measures-and-non-discrimination-in-the-european-union-the-need-for-systematic-evaluation/ |title=Preventive Counter-Terrorism Measures and Non-Discrimination in the European Union: The Need for Systematic Evaluation |date=2 July 2011 |publisher=The International Centre for Counter-Terrorism-The Hague (ICCT) | accessdate= 6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests, as proponents of [[human security]] have long argued, that respecting human rights may indeed help us to incur security. [[Amnesty International]] included a section on confronting terrorism in the recommendations in the Madrid Agenda arising from the Madrid Summit on Democracy and Terrorism (Madrid March 8–11, 2005):

{{quote|Democratic principles and values are essential tools in the fight against terrorism. Any successful strategy for dealing with terrorism requires terrorists to be isolated. Consequently, the preference must be to treat terrorism as criminal acts to be handled through existing systems of law enforcement and with full respect for human rights and the rule of law. We recommend: (1) taking effective measures to make impunity impossible either for acts of terrorism or for the abuse of human rights in counter-terrorism measures. (2) the incorporation of human rights laws in all anti-terrorism programmes and policies of national governments as well as international bodies."&lt;ref name="Amnesty International 2005"&gt;Amnesty International (2005): "Counter-terrorism and criminal law in the EU. [https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/ior61/013/2005/en/ online] &lt;/ref&gt;}}

While international efforts to combat terrorism have focused on the need to enhance cooperation between states, proponents of human rights (as well as [[human security]]) have suggested that more effort needs to be given to the effective inclusion of human rights protection as a crucial element in that cooperation. They argue that international human rights obligations do not stop at borders and a failure to respect human rights in one state may undermine its effectiveness in the international effort to cooperate to combat terrorism.&lt;ref name="Human Rights News 2004"&gt;Human Rights News (2004): "Human Rights and Counter-Terrorism", in the Briefing to the 60th Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights. [http://hrw.org/english/docs/2004/01/29/global7127.htm online]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Preemptive neutralization ===
Some countries see preemptive attacks as a legitimate strategy. This includes capturing, killing, or disabling suspected terrorists before they can mount an attack. [[Israel]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], and [[Russia]] have taken this approach, while Western European states generally do not.

Another major method of preemptive neutralization is [[interrogation]] of known or suspected terrorists to obtain information about specific plots, targets, the identity of other terrorists, whether or not the interrogation subjects himself is guilty of terrorist involvement. Sometimes more extreme methods are used to increase [[suggestibility]], such as [[sleep deprivation]] or drugs. Such methods may lead captives to offer false information in an attempt to stop the treatment, or due to the confusion brought on by it. These methods are not tolerated by European powers. In 1978 the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled in the [[Ireland v. United Kingdom (1978)|Ireland v. United Kingdom]] case that [[five techniques|such methods]] amounted to a practice of inhuman and degrading treatment, and that such practices were in breach of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] Article 3 (art. 3).

==== Non-military ====
The [[human security]] paradigm outlines a non-military approach which aims to address the enduring underlying inequalities which fuel terrorist activity. Causal factors need to be delineated and measures implemented which allow equal access to resources and [[sustainability]] for all people. Such activities empower citizens providing 'freedom from fear' and 'freedom from want'.

This can take many forms including the provision of clean drinking water, education, vaccination programs, provision of food and shelter and protection from violence, military or otherwise. Successful human security campaigns have been characterized by the participation of a diverse group of actors including governments, [[NGOs]], and citizens.

[[Foreign internal defense]] programs provide outside expert assistance to a threatened government. FID can involve both non-military and military aspects of counter-terrorism.

A 2017 study found that "governance and civil society aid is effective in dampening domestic terrorism, but this effect is only present if the recipient country is not experiencing a civil conflict."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Foreign Aid as a Counterterrorism Tool - Burcu Savun, Daniel C. Tirone,|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0022002717704952|language=en|doi=10.1177/0022002717704952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Military ====
[[File:U.S. Marine Corps Sgt. Ryan Burks, a squad leader with Fox Company, 2nd Battalion, 8th Marine Regiment, Regimental Combat Team 7, provides security during a mission rehearsal at Camp Bastion, Helmand province 130527-M-QZ858-089.jpg|thumb|U.S. Marines in Afghanistan]]
Terrorism has often been used to justify military intervention in countries like Pakistan where terrorists are said to be based. That was the main stated justification for the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|U.S. invasion of Afghanistan]]. It was also a stated justification for the [[second Russian invasion of Chechnya]].

Military intervention has not always been successful in stopping or preventing future terrorism, like during the [[Malayan Emergency]], the [[Mau Mau uprising]], and most of the campaigns against the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] during the [[Irish Civil War]], the [[S-Plan]], the [[Border Campaign (IRA)]] and [[the Troubles]] in Northern Ireland. Although military action can disrupt a terrorist group's operations temporarily, it sometimes doesn't end the threat completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Thus repression by the military in itself (particularly if it is not accompanied by other measures) usually leads to short term victories, but tend to be unsuccessful in the long run (e.g. the French's doctrine described in [[Roger Trinquier]]'s book ''Modern War''&lt;ref name=Trinquier&gt;{{cite web

However, new methods (see the new ''Counterinsurgency'' Field Manual&lt;ref name = FM3-24&gt;{{cite journal | publisher = US Department of the Army | first1 = John A. | last1 = Nagl | first2 = David H.| last2 = Petraeus | first3 = James F. | last3 =Amos |first4 = Sarah | last4 = Sewall

== Preparation ==
Police, fire, and emergency medical response organizations have obvious roles. Local [[firefighter]]s and emergency medical personnel (often called "first responders") have plans for mitigating the effects of terrorist attacks, although police may deal with threats of such attacks.

=== Target-hardening ===

Whatever the target of terrorists, there are multiple ways of hardening the targets to prevent the terrorists from hitting their mark, or reducing the damage of attacks. One method is to place [[Hostile vehicle mitigation]] to enforce protective standoff distance outside tall or politically sensitive buildings to prevent car and [[truck bomb]]ing. Another way to reduce the impact of attacks is to design buildings for rapid evacuation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Aircraft cockpits are kept locked during flights, and have reinforced doors, which only the pilots in the cabin are capable of opening. UK [[railway stations]] removed their [[waste container|rubbish bins]] in response to the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]] threat, as convenient locations for depositing bombs.

Scottish stations removed theirs after the [[7 July 2005 London Bombings]] as a precautionary measure. The [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]] purchased bomb-resistant barriers after the [[September 11 terrorist attacks]].

[[File:Flickr - Israel Defense Forces - Iron Dome Intercepts Rockets from the Gaza Strip.jpg|thumb|[[Iron Dome]] air defense system. It intercepts artillery rockets fired by terrorist onto Israeli cities and towns.]]
As [[Israel]] is suffering from constant shelling of its cities, towns and settlements by [[artillery rocket]]s from the [[Gaza Strip]] (mainly by [[Hamas]], but also by other Palestinian factions) and [[Lebanon]] (mainly by [[Hezbollah]]), Israel developed several defensive measures against artillery, rockets and missiles. These include building a [[bomb shelter]] in every building and [[school]], but also deploying active protection systems like the [[Arrow (Israeli missile)|Arrow ABM]], [[Iron Dome]] and [[David's Sling]] batteries which intercept the incoming threat in the air. [[Iron Dome]] has successfully intercepted hundreds of [[Qassam rocket]]s and [[Grad rocket]]s fired by Palestinians from the Gaza Strip.

A more sophisticated target-hardening approach must consider industrial and other critical industrial infrastructure that could be attacked. Terrorists need not import chemical weapons if they can cause a major industrial accident such as the [[Bhopal disaster]] or the [[Halifax Explosion]]. Industrial chemicals in manufacturing, shipping, and storage need greater protection, and some efforts are in progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; To put this risk into perspective, the first [[Poison gas in World War I#1915: large scale use and lethal gases|major lethal chemical attack in WWI]] used 160 tons of chlorine. Industrial shipments of chlorine, widely used in water purification and the chemical industry, travel in 90 or 55 ton tank cars.

To give one more example, the North American electrical grid has already demonstrated, in the [[Northeast Blackout of 2003]], its vulnerability to natural disasters coupled with inadequate, possibly insecure, [[SCADA]] (supervisory control and data acquisition) networks. Part of the vulnerability is due to deregulation leading to much more interconnection in a grid designed for only occasional power-selling between utilities. A small number of terrorists, attacking key power facilities when one or more engineers have infiltrated the power control centers, could wreak havoc.

Equipping likely targets with containers (i.e., bags) of pig lard has been utilized to discourage attacks by suicide bombers. The technique was apparently used on a limited scale by British authorities in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the actual effectiveness of this tactic is probably limited as it is possible that a sympathetic Islamic scholar could issue a [[fatwa]] proclaiming that a suicide bomber would not be polluted by the swine products.

=== Command and control ===
In North America and other continents, for a threatened or completed terrorist attack, the [[Incident Command System]] (ICS) is apt to be invoked to control the various services that may need to be involved in the response. ICS has varied levels of escalation, such as might be needed for multiple incidents in a given area (&lt;!-- This bracket is unbalanced! Please correct.--&gt;e.g., [[Attacks on the London Underground#2005 terrorist bomb attacks|the 2005 bombings in London]] or the [[2004 Madrid train bombings]], or all the way to a [[National Response Plan]] invocation if national-level resources are needed. National response, for example, might be needed for a nuclear, biological, radiological, or large chemical attack.

=== Damage mitigation ===
[[Fire department]]s, perhaps supplemented by public works agencies, utility providers (e.g., gas, water, electricity), and heavy construction contractors, are most apt to deal with the physical consequences of an attack.

=== Local security ===
Again under an incident command model, local police can isolate the incident area, reducing confusion, and specialized police units can conduct tactical operations against terrorists, often using [[#Counter-terrorism tactical units|specialized counter-terrorist tactical units]].  Bringing in such units will normally involve civil or military authority beyond the local level.

=== Medical services ===
[[Emergency medical services]] will triage, treat, and transport the more seriously affected victims to hospitals, which will also need to have mass casualty and [[triage]] plans in place.

[[Public health surveillance|Public health agencies]], from local to national level, may be designated to deal with identification, and sometimes mitigation, of possible biological attacks, and sometimes chemical or radiologic contamination.

== Tactical units ==
[[File:UTK PGK broke the door.JPG|thumb|[[Royal Malaysia Police]] ''Pasukan Gerakan Khas'' officers]]

Today, many countries have [[List of special police units|special units]] designated to handle terrorist threats. Besides various [[security agency|security agencies]], there are [[Special Weapons And Tactics|elite tactical units]], also known as [[Special Mission Unit|special mission units]], whose role is to directly engage terrorists and prevent terrorist attacks.
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:NSG Air Assault Mumbai Attacks.jpg|left|thumb|224x224px|[[National Security Guard|NSG]] commandos launching their assault on terrorist occupied [[Nariman House]] during the [[2008 Mumbai Attacks]]]] --&gt;
Such units perform both in preventive actions, [[hostage rescue]] and responding to on-going attacks. Countries of all sizes can have highly trained counter-terrorist teams. Tactics, techniques and procedures for [[Manhunt (military)|manhunting]] are under constant development.

Most of these measures deal with terrorist attacks that affect an area, or threaten to do so. It is far harder to deal with assassination, or even reprisals on individuals, due to the short (if any) warning time and the quick exfiltration of the assassins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

These units are specially trained in [[military tactics|tactics]] and are very well equipped for [[close quarters battle|CQB]] with emphasis on stealth and performing the mission with minimal casualties. The units include take-over force (assault teams), [[sniper]]s, [[Explosive Ordnance Disposal|EOD]] experts, dog handlers and intelligence officers. See [[Counter-intelligence and counter-terrorism organizations]] for national command, intelligence, and incident mitigation.

The majority of counter-terrorism operations at the tactical level, are conducted by state, federal and national [[police|law enforcement agencies]] or [[intelligence agency|intelligence agencies]]. In some countries, the military may be called in as a last resort. Obviously, for countries whose military are legally permitted to conduct police operations, this is a non-issue, and such counter-terrorism operations are conducted by their military.

See [[counter-intelligence]] for command, intelligence and warning, and incident mitigation aspects of counter-terror.

=== Designing Anti-terrorism systems ===

[[File:Transparent garbage bins at Central station.jpg|thumb|Transparent garbage bin installed at Central station in Sydney so police can check its contents]]

The scope for Anti-terrorism systems is very large in physical terms (long borders, vast areas, high traffic volumes in busy cities, etc.) as well as in other dimensions, such as type and degree of terrorism threat, political and diplomatic ramifications, and legal issues. In this environment, the development of a persistent Anti-terrorism protection system is a daunting task. Such a system should bring together diverse state-of-the-art technologies to enable persistent intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions, and enable potential actions. Designing such a system-of-systems comprises a major technological project.

A particular design problem for this system is that it will face many [[Uncertainty|uncertainties]] in the future. The threat of terrorism may increase, decrease or remain the same, the type of terrorism and location are difficult to predict, and there are technological uncertainties. Yet we want to design a terrorism system conceived and designed today in order to prevent acts of terrorism for a decade or more. A potential solution is to incorporate [[Flexibility (engineering)|flexibility]] into system design for the reason that the flexibility embedded can be exercised in future as [[uncertainty]] unfolds and updated information arrives. And the design and valuation of a protection system should not be based on a single scenario, but an array of scenarios. Flexibility can be incorporated in the design of the terrorism system in the form of options that can be exercised in the future when new information is available. Using these '[[real options]]' will create a flexible Anti-terrorism system that is able to cope with new requirements that may arise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1539-6924.2008.01160.x| title = Reducing Risk Through Real Options in Systems Design: The Case of Architecting a Maritime Domain Protection System| year = 2009| last1 = Buurman | first1 = J. | last2 = Zhang | first2 = S. | last3 = Babovic | first3 = V. | journal = Risk Analysis| volume = 29| issue = 3| pages = 366–379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Law enforcement/Police ===
While some countries with longstanding terrorism problems, such as Israel, have law enforcement agencies primarily designed to prevent and respond to terror attacks,&lt;ref&gt;Juergensmeyer, Mark (2000). Terror in the Mind of God: The Global Rise of Religious Violence. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; in other nations, counter-terrorism is a relatively more recent objective of civilian police and law enforcement agencies.&lt;ref name="Deflem"&gt;Deflem, Mathieu. 2010. The Policing of Terrorism: Organizational and Global Perspectives. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deflem, Mathieu and Samantha Hauptman. 2013. "Policing International Terrorism." Pp. 64–72 in Globalisation and the Challenge to Criminology, edited by Francis Pakes. London: Routledge. [http://deflem.blogspot.com/2013/01/policinginternationalterrorism.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

While some civil-libertarians and criminal justice scholars have called-out efforts of law enforcement agencies to combat terrorism as futile and expensive&lt;ref name="HelmsCostanzaJohnson"&gt;Helms, Ronald; Costanza, S.E and Johnson, N.. 2011. "Crouching tiger or phantom dragon? Examining the discourse on global cyber-terror." http://www.palgrave-journals.com/sj/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/sj20116a.html&lt;/ref&gt; or as threats to civil liberties,&lt;ref name="HelmsCostanzaJohnson" /&gt; other scholars have begun describing and analyzing the most important dimensions of the policing of terrorism as an important dimension of counterterrorism, especially in the post-9/11 era, and have argued how police institutions view terrorism as a matter of crime control.&lt;ref name="Deflem" /&gt; Such analyses bring out the civilian police role in counterterrorism next to the military model of a 'war on terror'.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Bayer. 2010. The Blue Planet: Informal International Police Networks and National Intelligence. Washington, DC: National Intelligence Defense College. [http://www.ni-u.edu/ni_press/pdf/The_Blue_Planet.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Counter-Terrorism and American Law Enforcement ===
[[File:FBI Hostage Rescue Team Agents bei einer Übung.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Hostage Rescue Team]] agents]]
Pursuant to passage of the [[Homeland Security Act of 2002]], federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies began to systemically reorganize.&lt;ref&gt;Costanza, S.E., Kilburn Jr., John C. 2005. "Symbolic Security, Moral Panic and Public Sentiment: Toward a sociology of Counterterrorism", Journal of Social and Ecological Boundaries, 1(2): 106–124&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deflem, M. 2004. "Social Control and the Policing of Terrorism Foundations for a sociology of Counterterrorism." American Sociologist. 35 (2): 75–92. [http://deflem.blogspot.com/2004/08/social-control-and-policing-of.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Two primary federal agencies (the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] (DOJ) and the [[Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS)) house most of the federal agencies that are prepared to combat domestic and international terrorist attacks. These include the [[United States Border Patrol|Border Patrol]], the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]], the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] and the [[FBI]].

Following suit from federal changes pursuant to 9/11, however, most state and local law enforcement agencies began to include a commitment to "fighting terrorism" in their mission statements.&lt;ref&gt;DeLone, Gregory J. 2007. "Law Enforcement Mission Statements Post September 11." Police Quarterly 10(2)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mathieu Deflem. 2010. The Policing of Terrorism: Organizational and Global Perspectives. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Local agencies began to establish more patterned lines of communication with federal agencies.  Some scholars have doubted the ability of local police to help in the war on terror and suggest their limited manpower is still best utilized by engaging community and targeting street crimes.&lt;ref&gt;Helms, Ronald;  Costanza, S.E and Johnson, N. 2011. "Crouching tiger or phantom dragon? Examining the discourse on global cyber-terror." http://www.palgrave-journals.com/sj/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/sj20116a.html&lt;/ref&gt;

While counter-terror measures (most notably heightened airport security, immigrant [[Racial profiling|profiling]]&lt;ref&gt;Ramirez, D., J. Hoopes, and T.L. Quinlan.  2003 "Defining racial profiling in a post-September 11 world." American Criminal Law Review. 40(3): 1195–1233.&lt;/ref&gt; and border patrol) have been adapted during the last decade, to enhance counter-terror in law enforcement, there have been remarkable limitations to assessing the actual utility/effectiveness of law enforcement practices that are ostensibly preventative.&lt;ref&gt;Kilburn, John C, Jr; Costanza, S.E.; Metchik, Eric and Borgeson, Kevin (2011) "Policing Terror Threats and False Positives:  Employing a Signal Detection Model to Examine Changes in National and Local Policing Strategy between 2001–2007" Security Journal 24, 19–36&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, while sweeping changes in counter-terrorism rhetoric redefined most American post 9/11 law enforcement agencies in theory, it is hard to assess how well such hyperbole has translated into practice.

In [[intelligence-led policing]](ILP) efforts, the most quantitatively amenable starting point for measuring the effectiveness of any policing strategy (i.e.: Neighborhood Watch, Gun Abatement, Foot Patrols, etc.) is usually to assess total financial costs against clearance rates or arrest rates. Since terrorism is such a rare event phenomena,&lt;ref&gt;Kilburn Jr., John C. and Costanza, S.E.  2009  "Immigration and Homeland Security"  published in Battleground: Immigration (Ed: Judith Ann Warner); Greenwood Publishing, Ca.&lt;/ref&gt; measuring arrests or clearance rates would be a non-generalizable and ineffective way to test enforcement policy effectiveness. Another methodological problem in assessing counter-terrorism efforts in law enforcement hinges on finding operational measures for key concepts in the study of homeland security. Both terrorism and homeland security are relatively new concepts for criminologists, and academicians have yet to agree on the matter of how to properly define these ideas in a way that is accessible.

{{details| List of special forces units}}
[[File:ARW 30th Anniversary - 4478058309.jpg|right|thumb|[[Ireland|Irish]] [[Army Ranger Wing]] operators during counter-terrorism training exercise.]]Given the nature of operational counter-terrorism tasks national military organizations do not generally have dedicated units whose sole responsibility is the prosecution of these tasks. Instead the counter-terrorism function is an element of the role, allowing flexibility in their employment, with operations being undertaken in the domestic or international context.

In some cases the legal framework within which they operate prohibits military units conducting operations in the domestic arena; [[United States Department of Defense]] policy, based on the [[Posse Comitatus Act]], forbids domestic counter-terrorism operations by the U.S. military. Units allocated some operational counter-terrorism task are frequently [[Special Forces]] or similar assets.

In cases where military organisations do operate in the domestic context some form of formal handover from the law enforcement community is regularly required, to ensure adherence to the legislative framework and limitations. such as the [[Iranian Embassy Siege]], the British police formally turned responsibility over to the [[Special Air Service]] when the situation went beyond police capabilities.

The '''crocodile paradox''', also known as crocodile sophism, is a [[paradox]] in [[logic]] in the same family of paradoxes as the [[liar paradox]].&lt;ref name="Wolf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CrocodilesDilemma.html|title=Crococile Dilemma – MathWorld|accessdate=2009-09-05|last=Barile|first=Margherita}}&lt;/ref&gt; The premise states that a crocodile, who has stolen a child, promises the father/mother that their child will be returned [[if and only if]] they correctly predict what the crocodile will do next.

The transaction is logically smooth but unpredictable if the parent guesses that the child will be returned, but a dilemma arises for the crocodile if the parent guesses that the child will not be returned. In the case that the crocodile decides to keep the child, he violates his terms: the parent's prediction has been validated, and the child should be returned. However, in the case that the crocodile decides to give back the child, he still violates his terms, even if this decision is based on the previous result: the parent's prediction has been falsified, and the child should not be returned. The question of what the crocodile should do is therefore [[paradox]]ical, and there is no justifiable solution.&lt;ref name="lect"&gt;{{cite book|title=Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1989|isbn=3540530827|page=14|editor=J. Siekmann}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Traveling East|publisher=iUniverse|year=2005|first=Ronald E|last=Young|isbn=0595795846|pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Murray's Compendium of logic|year=1847|first=Richard|last=Murray|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crocodile dilemma serves to expose some of the logical problems presented by [[metaknowledge]]. In this regard, it is similar in construction to the [[unexpected hanging paradox]], which [[Richard Montague]]&amp;nbsp;(1960) used to demonstrate that the following assumptions about knowledge are inconsistent when tested in combination:&lt;ref name="lect" /&gt;
:&lt;blockquote&gt;(i)  If ''ρ'' is known to be true, then ''ρ''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
:&lt;blockquote&gt;(ii) It is known that (i).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
:&lt;blockquote&gt;(iii) If ''ρ'' implies ''σ'', and ''ρ'' is known to be true, then ''σ'' is also known to be true.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Ancient Greek sources were the first to discuss the crocodile dilemma.&lt;ref name="Wolf" /&gt;

{{About|the human shedding of tears}}
[[File:Crying-girl.jpg|thumb|A two-year-old girl crying]]

'''Crying''' is the shedding of [[tears]] (or welling of tears in the eyes) in response to an [[emotion|emotional state]], [[pain]] or a physical irritation of the eye. Emotions that can lead to crying include [[anger]], [[happiness]], or [[sadness]].  The act of crying has been defined as "a complex [[secretomotor]] phenomenon  characterized by the shedding of tears from the [[lacrimal apparatus]], without any irritation of the [[human eye|ocular]] structures", instead, giving a relief which protects from conjunctivitis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0010-440X(93)90049-A |author=Patel, V. |title=Crying behavior and psychiatric disorder in adults: a review |journal=Compr Psychiatry |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=206–11 |year=1993 |pmid=8339540 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0010-440X(93)90049-A}} Quoted by Michelle C.P. Hendriks, A.J.J.M. Vingerhoets in ''Crying: is it beneficial for one's well-being?''&lt;/ref&gt; A related medical term is [[lacrimation]], which also refers to non-emotional shedding of tears. Various forms of crying are known as ''sobbing'', ''weeping'', ''wailing'', ''whimpering'', ''bawling'', and ''blubbering''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paulnoll.com/Books/Synonyms/synonym-095.html |title=List of 426 Sets of Synonyms and How they Differ in Meaning |publisher=Paulnoll.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For crying to be described as sobbing, it usually has to be accompanied by a set of other symptoms, such as slow but erratic [[inhalation]],  occasional instances of [[breath holding]] and muscular [[tremor]].

A [[biological neural network|neuronal connection]] between the [[lacrimal gland]] ([[tear duct]]) and the areas of the human brain involved with emotion has been established.  Scientists debate over whether humans are the only animals that produce tears in response to emotional states.&lt;ref name="Cry p44"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Walter, Chip |date=December 2006 |title=Why do we cry? |journal=Scientific American Mind |volume=17 |issue=6 |page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Langseth, Muriel |author2=Frey, William H. |chapter=Ch. 14: Do Animals Shed Emotional Tears? |title=Crying: the mystery of tears |year=1985 |publisher=Winston Press |location=Minneapolis, Minn |pages=135–9 |isbn=0-86683-829-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Darwin]] wrote in ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]'' that the keepers of Indian elephants in the [[London Zoo]] told him that their charges shed tears in sorrow. 

Tears produced during emotional crying have a chemical composition which differs from other types of tears. They contain significantly greater quantities of the hormones [[prolactin]], [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]], and [[Leu-enkephalin]],&lt;ref&gt;Skorucak A. "The Science of Tears." ScienceIQ.com.&lt;/ref&gt; and the elements [[potassium]] and [[manganese]].&lt;ref name="Cry p44"/&gt;

[[File:1953 Ogatsutama powder mill explosion 3.JPG|thumb|right|Two people cry reacting to the Ogatsutama powder mill explosion in 1953.]]  

The question of the function or origin of emotional tears remains open. Theories range from the simple, such as response to inflicted pain, to the more complex, including [[nonverbal communication]] in order to elicit [[altruistic]] behavior from others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=On the Origin of Crying and Tears |journal=Human Ethology Newsletter |volume=5 |issue=10 |pages=5–6 |date=June 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have also claimed that crying can serve several biochemical purposes, such as relieving stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Doheny |first=Kathleen |title=Why We Cry: The Truth About Tearing Up |url=http://www.webmd.com/balance/features/why-we-cry-the-truth-about-tearing-up?page=2 |publisher=WebMD |accessdate=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crying is believed to be an outlet or a result of a burst of intense emotional sensations, such as agony, surprise or joy. This theory could explain why people cry during cheerful events, as well as very painful events.&lt;ref&gt;"Crying; The Mystery of Tears" [http://www.alzheimersinfo.org/index.php?page=grief-and-loss-2 personal page of Frey WH with quote from his book] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521085419/http://www.alzheimersinfo.org/index.php?page=grief-and-loss-2 |date=2008-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals tend to remember the positive aspects of crying, and may create a link between other simultaneous positive events, such as resolving feelings of [[grief]]. Together, these features of memory reinforce the idea that crying helped the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carey|first=Benedict|title=The Muddled Tracks of All Those Tears|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/03/health/03mind.html|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=18 July 2011|date=2 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hippocratic]] and medieval medicine, tears were associated with the bodily [[humorism|humors]], and crying was seen as purgation of excess humors from the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Lutz (2001), 69ff.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William James]] thought of emotions as reflexes prior to rational thought, believing that the physiological response, as if to stress or irritation, is a precondition to cognitively becoming aware of emotions such as fear or anger.

William H. Frey II, a biochemist at the [[University of Minnesota]], proposed that people feel "better" after crying due to the elimination of hormones associated with [[stress hormone|stress]], specifically [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]]. This, paired with increased mucosal secretion during crying, could lead to a theory that crying is a mechanism developed in humans to dispose of this stress hormone when levels grow too high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/emotional-freedom/201007/the-health-benefits-tears.|accessdate=30 January 2015|title=Emotional Freedom}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, tears have a limited ability to eliminate chemicals, reducing the likelihood of this theory.&lt;ref&gt;Juan Murube, president of the Spanish Society of Ophthalmology, reports that the amount of blood passing through the lacrimal glands is tiny in comparison to the body's five liters of blood, and unlike other minor bodily excretion methods like breathing and perspiration, tears are mostly reabsorbed into the body. {{cite web|url=http://medlib.yu.ac.kr/eur_j_oph/ejo_pdf/1511.pdf|accessdate=20 March 2017|title=Origin and types of emotional tearing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent psychological theories of crying emphasize the relationship of crying to the experience of perceived helplessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.newideapsych.2003.09.001 |author1=Miceli, M. |author2=Castelfranchi, C. |title=Crying: discussing its basic reasons and uses |journal=New Ideas in Psychology |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=247–73 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective, an underlying experience of helplessness can usually explain why people cry. For example, a person may cry after receiving surprisingly happy news, ostensibly because the person feels powerless or unable to influence what is happening.

Emotional tears have also been put into an evolutionary context. One study proposes that crying, by blurring vision, can handicap aggressive or defensive actions, and may function as a reliable signal of appeasement, need, or attachment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/culture/080828-why-we-cry.html ''New Theory for Why We Cry'']&lt;/ref&gt; Oren Hasson, an [[evolutionary psychologist]] in the zoology department at [[Tel Aviv University]] believes that crying shows vulnerability and submission to an attacker, solicits sympathy and aid from bystanders, and signals shared emotional attachments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Cry? Evolutionary Biologists Show Crying Can Strengthen Relationships|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/08/090824141045.htm|work=Science Daily|publisher=Tel Aviv University.|accessdate=8 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theory that follows evolutionary psychology is given by Paul D. MacLean, who suggests that the vocal part of crying was used first as a "separation cry" to help reunite parents and offspring. The tears, he speculates, are a result of a link between the development of the cerebrum and the discovery of fire. MacLean figures that since early humans must have relied heavily on fire, their eyes were frequently producing reflexive tears in response to the smoke. As humans evolved the smoke possibly gained a strong association with the loss of life and, therefore, sorrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lutz|first=Tom|title=Crying : the natural and cultural history of tears|year=1999|publisher=W. W. Norton|location=New York|isbn=0-393-04756-3|pages=90–91|edition=1.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, CVBellieni [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0732118X15300167 analysed the weeping behavior], and concluded that most animals can cry but only humans have psychoemotional shedding of [[tears]], also known as “weeping”. Weeping is a behavior that induces empathy perhaps with the mediation of the [[Mirror neuron|mirror neurons network]], and influences the mood through the release of hormones elicited by the massage effect made by the tears on the cheeks, or through the relief of the sobbing rhythm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bellieni CV  |title=Meaning and importance of weeping. |journal=New Ideas in Psychology |volume= |issue=  |pages=  |year=2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological response==
[[File:Tears_.jpg|thumb|A child crying]]

It can be very difficult to observe biological effects of crying, especially considering many psychologists believe the environment in which a person cries can alter the experience of the crier. However, crying studies in laboratories have shown several physical effects of crying, such as increased heart rate, sweating, and slowed breathing. Although it appears that the type of effects an individual experiences depends largely on the individual, for many it seems that the calming effects of crying, such as slowed breathing, outlast the negative effects, which could explain why people remember crying as being helpful and beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cry Me A River: The Psychology of Crying|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/12/081217123831.htm|work=Science Daily|publisher=Association for :Psychological Science|accessdate=18 July 2011|date=19 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common [[side effect]] of crying is feeling a lump in the throat of the crier, otherwise known as a [[globus sensation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Causes a Lump in the Throat Feeling? Globus Sensation|url=http://www.healthitalk.com/what-causes-lump-in-the-throat-feeling-globus-sensation/|work=Heath Talk|accessdate=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although many things can cause a globus sensation, the one experienced in crying is a response to the stress experienced by the [[sympathetic nervous system]]. When an animal is threatened by some form of danger, the sympathetic nervous system triggers several processes to allow the animal to [[Fight-or-flight response|fight or flee]]. This includes shutting down unnecessary body functions, such as digestion, and increasing blood flow and oxygen to necessary muscles. When an individual experiences emotions such as sorrow, the sympathetic nervous system still responds in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Glass|first=Don|title=A Lump in Your Throat|url=http://indianapublicmedia.org/amomentofscience/a-lump-in-your-throat/|work=Moment of Science|date=15 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another function increased by the sympathetic nervous system is breathing, which includes opening the throat in order to increase air flow. This is done by expanding the [[glottis]], which allows more air to pass through. As an individual is undergoing this sympathetic response, eventually the [[parasympathetic nervous system]] attempts to undo the response by decreasing high stress activities and increasing recuperative processes, which includes running digestion. This involves swallowing, a process which requires closing the fully expanded glottis to prevent food from entering the [[larynx]]. The glottis, however, attempts to remain open as an individual cries. This fight to close the glottis creates a sensation that feels like a lump in the individual's throat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Onken|first=Michael|title=What causes the 'lump' in your throat when you cry?|url=http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/1997-03/855114309.An.r.html|work=MadSci|publisher=Washington University Medical School|accessdate=18 July 2011|date=16 February 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other common side effects of crying are quivering lips, a [[runny nose]], and an unsteady, cracking voice.

==Frequency of crying==
According to the German Society of Ophthalmology, which has collated different scientific studies on crying, the average woman cries between 30 and 64 times a year, and the average man cries between 6 and 17 times a year.&lt;ref name="ophtalmologische1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Frauen und Männer weinen anders [German: Woman and Men Cry Differently]|url=http://www.dog.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/PM-Weinen.pdf | work=Pressearchiv 2009|publisher=Deutsche Ophtalmologische Gesellschaft | accessdate=19 January 2015|date=October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Men tend to cry for between two and four minutes, and women cry for about six minutes. Crying turns into sobbing for women in 65% of cases, compared to just 6% for men. Until adolescence, however, no difference between the sexes was found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Women cry more than men, and for longer, study finds |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/6334107/Women-cry-more-than-men-and-for-longer-study-finds.html |work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date=15 October 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ophtalmologische1"/&gt;

==Types of crying in infants==
[[File:Human-Male-White-Newborn-Baby-Crying.jpg|thumb|A newborn child crying.]]

Although crying is an infant's mode of communication, it is not limited to a monotonous sound. There are three different types of cries apparent in infants. The first of these three is a '''basic cry''', which is a systematic cry with a pattern of crying and silence. The basic cry starts with a cry coupled with a briefer silence, which is followed by a short high-pitched inspiratory whistle. Then, there is a brief silence followed by another cry. Hunger is a main stimulant of the basic cry. An '''anger cry''' is much like the basic cry; however, in this cry, more excess air is forced through the vocal cords, making it a louder, more abrupt cry. This type of cry is characterized by the same temporal sequence as the basic pattern but distinguished by differences in the length of the various phase components. The third cry is the '''pain cry''', which, unlike the other two, has no preliminary moaning. The pain cry is one loud cry, followed by a period of breath holding.{{Citation needed|date = March 2016}} Most adults can determine whether an infant's cries signify anger or pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zeskind|first=P.

French infants wail on a rising note while German infants favor a falling melody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Mampe, B. |author2=Friederici, A.D. |author3=Christophe, A. |author4=Wermke, K. |title=Newborns' cry melody is shaped by their native language |journal=Curr.

[[Carlo Bellieni]] found a correlation between the features of babies' crying and the level of pain, though he found no direct correlation between the cause of crying and its characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Bellieni CV, Sisto R, Cordelli DM, Buonocore G. Cry features reflect pain intensity in term newborns: an alarm threshold. Pediatr Res. 2004 Jan;55(1):142-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[T. Berry Brazelton]] has suggested that overstimulation may be a contributing factor to infant crying and that periods of active crying might serve the purpose of discharging overstimulation and helping the baby’s nervous system regain homeostasis.&lt;ref&gt;Brazelton, T.B. (1985). "Application of cry research to clinical perspectives." In B.M. Lester and C.F.Z. Boukydis (Eds.), ''Infant Crying: Theoretical and Research Perspectives''. New York: Plenum Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brazelton, T.B. (1992). ''Touchpoints''. New York: Perseus.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sheila Kitzinger]] found a correlation between the mother's prenatal stress level and later amount of crying by the infant. She also found a correlation between birth trauma and crying. Mothers who had experienced obstetrical interventions or who were made to feel powerless during birth had babies who cried more than other babies. Rather than try one remedy after another to stop this crying, she suggested that mothers hold their babies and allow the crying to run its course.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, S. (1989). ''The Crying Baby''. New York: Viking.&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have supported Kitzinger's findings. Babies who had experienced birth complications had longer crying spells at three months of age and awakened more frequently at night crying.&lt;ref&gt;de Weerth, C. &amp; Buitelaar, J.K. (2007). "Childbirth complications affect young infants' behavior." ''European Child and Adolescent Psychiatry'', 16 (6): 379–388.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keller, H., Lohaus, A., Volker, S., Cappenberg, M. &amp; Chasiotis, A. (1998). "Relationships between infant crying, birth complications, and maternal variables." ''Child: Care, Health and Development'', 24 (5): 377–394.&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on these various findings, [[Aletha Solter]] has proposed a general emotional release theory of infant crying. When infants cry for no obvious reason after all other causes (such as hunger or pain) are ruled out, she suggests that the crying may signify a beneficial stress-release mechanism. She recommends the "crying-in-arms" approach as a way to comfort these infants.&lt;ref&gt;Solter, A. (1995). "Why do babies cry?" ''Pre- and Perinatal Psychology Journal'', 10 (1), 21–43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Solter, A. (1998). ''Tears and Tantrums: What to Do When Babies and Children Cry.'' Goleta, CA: Shining Star Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Solter, A. (2004). [http://www.awareparenting.com/comfort.htm ''Crying for comfort: distressed babies need to be held.'']" ''Mothering'', Issue 122 January/February, 24–29.&lt;/ref&gt; Another way of comforting and calming the baby is to mimics the familiarity and coziness of mother’s womb. Dr. Robert Hamilton developed a technique to parents where a baby can be calmed and stop crying in 5 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nannysos.com.sg/how-to-calm-a-crying-baby-tips-for-parents-and-babysitters/|title= How To Calm A Crying Baby Tips for Parents and Babysitters|author=|date=|work= NannySOS |accessdate=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Categorizing dimensions==
[[File:Weeping Parisian from NARA Ww2-81.jpg|thumb|A Frenchman sheds tears of patriotic grief (1941).]]

There have been many attempts to differentiate between the two distinct types of crying: positive and negative. Different perspectives have been broken down into three dimensions to examine the emotions being felt and also to grasp the contrast between the two types.&lt;ref name="Katz1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Katz|first=Jack|title=How emotions work|year=1999|publisher=Univ. of Chicago Press|location=Chicago [u.a.]|isbn=0-226-42599-1|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spatial perspective explains sad crying as reaching out to be "there", such as at home or with a person who may have just died. In contrast, joyful crying is acknowledging being "here." It emphasized the intense awareness of one's location, such as at a relative's wedding.&lt;ref name="Katz1999" /&gt;

Temporal perspective explains crying slightly differently. In temporal perspective, sorrowful crying is due to looking to the past with regret or to the future with dread. This illustrated crying as a result of losing someone and regretting not spending more time with them or being nervous about an upcoming event. Crying as a result of happiness would then be a response to a moment as if it is eternal; the person is frozen in a blissful, immortalized present.&lt;ref name="Katz1999" /&gt;

The last dimension is known as the public-private perspective. This describes the two types of crying as ways to imply details about the self as known privately or one's public identity. For example, crying due to a loss is a message to the outside world that pleads for help with coping with internal sufferings. Or, as [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] suggested, sorrowful crying is a method of self-pity or self-regard, a way one comforts oneself. Joyful crying, in contrast, is in recognition of beauty, glory, or wonderfulness.&lt;ref name="Katz1999" /&gt;

==Religious views on crying==
The Shia Ithna Ashari (Muslims who believe in twelve Imams after Muhammad) consider crying to be an important responsibility towards their leaders who were martyred.
They believe a true lover of Imam Hussain can feel the afflictions and oppressions Imam Hussain suffered; his feelings are so immense that they break out into tears and wail. The pain of the beloved is the pain of the lover. Crying on Imam Husain is the sign or expression of true love.
The Imams of Shias have encouraged crying especially on Imam Husaain and have informed about rewards for this act. They support their view through a tradition (saying) from Muhammad who said: (On the Day of Judgment, a group would be seen in the most excellent and honourable of states. They would be asked if they were of the Angels or of the Prophets. In reply they would state): "We are neither Angels nor Prophets but of the indigent ones from the ummah of Muhammad". They would then be asked: "How then did you achieve this lofty and honourable status?" They would reply: "We did not perform very many good deeds nor did we pass all the days in a state of fasting or all the nights in a state of worship but yes, we used to offer our (daily) prayers (regularly) and whenever we used to hear the mention of Muhammad, tears would roll down our cheeks".(Mustadrak al‑Wasail, vol 10, pg. 318)

In [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]] and [[Catholic]] Christianity, tears are considered to be a sign of genuine repentance, and a desirable thing in many cases. Tears of true contrition are thought to be sacramental, helpful in forgiving sins, in that they recall the [[Baptism]] of the penitent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Design by |url=http://www.pravmir.com/prayer-xvii-compunction-tears/ |title=On Prayer XVII: On Compunction and Tears &amp;#124; A Russian Orthodox Church Website |publisher=Pravmir.com |date=2014-06-18 |accessdate=2017-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/l/lutz-crying.html |title=Crying |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1992-03-10 |accessdate=2017-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lacrimal system==
[[File:Gray896.png|thumb|right|A diagram showing the [[lacrimal apparatus]]]]
There are three types of tears: basal tears, reflexive tears, and psychic tears. Basal tears are produced at a rate of about 1 to 2 microliters a minute, and are made in order to keep the eye lubricated and smooth out irregularities in the [[cornea]]. Reflexive tears are tears that are made in response to irritants to the eye, such as when chopping onions or getting poked in the eye. Psychic tears are produced by the lacrimal system and are the tears expelled during emotional states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lutz|first=Tom|title=Crying : the natural and cultural history of tears|year=1999|publisher=W. W. Norton|location=New York|isbn=0-393-04756-3|page=68|edition=1.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[lacrimal system]] is made up of a secretory system, which produces tears, and an excretory system, which drains the tears. The lacrimal gland is primarily responsible for producing emotional or reflexive tears. As tears are produced, some fluid evaporates between blinks, and some is drained through the [[lacrimal punctum]]. The tears that are drained through the punctum will eventually be drained through the nose. Any excess fluid that did not go into the punctum will fall over the eyelid, which produces tears that are cried.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lutz|first=Tom|title=Crying : the natural and cultural history of tears|year=1999|publisher=W. W. Norton|location=New York|isbn=0-393-04756-3|pages=69–70|edition=1.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disorders related to crying==
* [[Baby colic]], where an infant's excessive crying has no obvious cause or underlying medical disorder.
* [[Bell's palsy]], where faulty regeneration of the facial nerve can cause sufferers to shed tears while eating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Morais Pérez, D. |author2=Dalmau Galofre, J. |author3=Bernat Gili, A. |author4=Ayerbe Torrero, V. |title=[Crocodile tears syndrome] |language=Spanish|journal=Acta Otorrinolaringol Esp |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=175–7 |year=1990 |pmid=2261223}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cri du chat]], where the characteristic cry of affected infants, which is similar to that of a meowing kitten, is due to problems with the larynx and nervous system.
* [[Familial dysautonomia]], where there can be a lack of overflow tears (alacrima), during emotional crying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Felicia B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16375">The '''cutaneous rabbit illusion''' (also known as '''cutaneous saltation''' and sometimes the cutaneous rabbit effect or '''CRE''') is a [[touch illusion|tactile illusion]] evoked by tapping two or more separate regions of the skin in rapid succession. The illusion is most readily evoked on regions of the body surface that have relatively poor spatial acuity, such as the forearm. A rapid sequence of taps delivered first near the [[wrist]] and then near the [[elbow]] creates the sensation of sequential taps hopping up the [[arm]] from the wrist towards the elbow, although no physical [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] was applied between the two actual stimulus locations.  Similarly, stimuli delivered first near the elbow then near the wrist evoke the illusory perception of taps hopping from elbow towards wrist. The illusion was discovered by Frank Geldard and Carl Sherrick of [[Princeton University]], in the early 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Geldard|first=F. A.|author2=Sherrick, C.

==Experimental studies==
From the moment of its discovery, the cutaneous rabbit illusion piqued the curiosity of researchers, and many experiments investigating the effect have been conducted, most of them on the forearm. Studies have consistently shown that the rabbit illusion occurs only when successive taps are closely spaced in time; the illusion disappears if the temporal separation between taps exceeds about 0.3 seconds (300 milliseconds).&lt;ref name="Geldard_1982" /&gt; A study showed that attention directed to one skin location reduces the perceptual migration of a tap placed at the attended location.&lt;ref name="Kilgard_Merzenich_1995"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kilgard|first=MP|author2=Merzenich, MM|title=Anticipated stimuli across skin|journal=Nature|date=23 February 1995|volume=373|issue=6516|pages=663|pmid=7854442|doi=10.1038/373663a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study showed that the illusory taps are associated with neural activity in the same area of the brain's sensory map that is activated by real taps to the skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blankenburg|first=Felix|author2=Ruff, Christian C. |author3=Deichmann, Ralf |author4=Rees, Geraint |author5= Driver, Jon |title=The Cutaneous Rabbit Illusion Affects Human Primary Sensory Cortex Somatotopically|journal=PLoS Biology|date=1 January 2006|volume=4|issue=3|pages=e69|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040069 |pmid=16494530 |pmc=1382015}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the specific neural mechanisms that underlie the rabbit illusion are unknown. Many interesting instantiations of the cutaneous rabbit illusion have been observed. The illusion is not just confined to the "body".&lt;ref name="Miyazaki et al. 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miyazaki|first=M|author2=Hirashima, M |author3=Nozaki, D |title=The "cutaneous rabbit" hopping out of the body|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|date=Feb 3, 2010|volume=30|issue=5|pages=1856–60|pmid=20130194|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3887-09.2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When subjects supported a stick across their index fingertips and received the taps via the stick, they reported sensing the illusory taps along the stick. This suggests that the cutaneous rabbit effect involves not only the intrinsic [[Somatotopic arrangement|somatotopic]] representation but also the representation of the extended body schema that results from body-object interactions. Research has shown that the illusion can occur across non-contiguous body regions such as the fingers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Warren|first=JP |author2=Santello, M |author3=Helms Tillery, SI|title=Electrotactile stimuli delivered across fingertips inducing the Cutaneous Rabbit Effect|journal=Experimental Brain Research|date=October 2010|volume=206|issue=4|pages=419–26|pmid=20862459|doi=10.1007/s00221-010-2422-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a subpopulation of participants apparently does not experience the effect on the fingertips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Warren|first=JP|author2=Tillery, SI|title=Tactile perception: do distinct subpopulations explain differences in mislocalization rates of stimuli across fingertips?|journal=Neuroscience Letters|date=Nov 7, 2011|volume=505|issue=1|pages=1–5|pmid=21575679|doi=10.1016/j.neulet.2011.04.057}}&lt;/ref&gt; The illusion has also been shown to occur both within and across the arms.&lt;ref&gt;Eimer, M., B.

Stimuli are illustrated in the upper panels, along with their perception (forearm sketches). Corresponding human data and Bayesian model fits are plotted in the lower panels. For details, see Goldreich &amp; Tong (2013).&lt;ref name="Goldreich_Tong_2013" /&gt;]] A [[Bayesian approaches to brain function|Bayesian]] perceptual model&lt;ref name="Goldreich_2007" /&gt; closely replicates the cutaneous rabbit and other tactile spatiotemporal illusions. According to this model, brain circuitry encodes the expectation, acquired through sensory experience, that tactile stimuli tend to be stationary or to move only slowly. The Bayesian model reaches an optimal probabilistic inference by combining uncertain spatial sensory information with a prior expectation for low-speed movement (a Gaussian prior distribution over velocity, with mean 0). The expectation that stimuli tend to move slowly results in the perceptual conclusion that rapidly successive stimuli are more likely to be closer together on the skin.

The Bayesian model was further developed&lt;ref name="Goldreich_Tong_2013" /&gt; and shown to replicate the perception of humans to both simple (e.g., two-tap) and more complex (multi-tap) stimulus sequences, such as the 3-tap [[tau effect]] and the 15-tap rabbit illusion. The Bayesian model&lt;ref name="Goldreich_Tong_2013" /&gt; replicates the effects of selective spatial attention on the rabbit illusion percept &lt;ref name="Kilgard_Merzenich_1995" /&gt; and is compatible with both the out-of-body rabbit illusion &lt;ref name="Miyazaki et al. 2010" /&gt; and crossmodal influences on the rabbit illusion.&lt;ref name="Asai_Kanayama_2012" /&gt; Perceptual prediction and [[retrodiction|postdiction]] are emergent properties of the Bayesian model.  A [[freeware]] computer program, [http://pnb.mcmaster.ca/goldreich-lab/LL/Leaping_Lagomorphs.html Leaping Lagomorphs], implements the Bayesian model.

For the case of two taps to the skin, the Bayesian model perceives the length between taps, ''l*'', to be a function of the actual length, ''l'', and the elapsed time, ''t'':

{{bigmath|''l*'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''l''|1 + 2(τ/t)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} }}

This is the ''perceptual length contraction formula'',&lt;ref name=Goldreich_2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldreich_Tong_2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; so-named&lt;ref name=Goldreich_2007 /&gt; in analogy with the physical [[length contraction]] described in the [[theory of relativity]]. Note that, just as observed in rabbit illusion experiments, the formula shows that ''l*'' underestimates ''l'' to a greater extent when ''t'' is made smaller; as ''t'' becomes large, ''l*'' approaches ''l'' and the illusion disappears.&lt;ref name="Kilgard_Merzenich_1995" /&gt; The model's parameter, tau (τ), is a time constant for tactile space perception; the value of tau determines how rapidly the perceived length approaches the actual length as the time between stimuli, ''t'', is increased. The perceived length equals one-third the actual length when ''t=τ'', and two-thirds the actual length when ''t=2τ''.

Goldreich and Tong (2013) showed that tau is the ratio of the observer's low-speed expectation and tactile spatial acuity; they estimated the value of tau to be approximately 0.1 s on the forearm.&lt;ref name="Goldreich_Tong_2013" /&gt; A novel prediction of the Bayesian model, pointed out by Goldreich and Tong (2013), is that the amount of length contraction experienced will depend on the intensity of a tactile stimulus: lighter taps, which are more difficult to localize, should produce larger tau values and therefore more length contraction. Tong et al (2016) confirmed this prediction experimentally.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tong|first1=Jonathan|last2=Ngo|first2=Vy|last3=Goldreich|first3=Daniel|title=Tactile length contraction as Bayesian inference|journal=Journal of Neurophysiology|date=1 August 2016|volume=116|issue=2|pages=369–379|doi=10.1152/jn.00029.2016|pmid=27121574|pmc=4969385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related illusions==
An illusion that appears to be closely related to the rabbit illusion is the [[tau effect]]. The tau effect arises when an observer judges the distance between consecutive stimuli in a sequence. If the distance from one stimulus to the next is constant, but the time elapsed from one stimulus to the next is not constant, then subjects tend to perceive the interval that is shorter in time as also being shorter in distance.&lt;ref name=Helson_King&gt;{{cite journal|last=Helson|first=H|author2=King, S.M.|title=The tau effect: an example of psychological relativity|journal=J Exp Psychol|year=1931|volume=14|issue=3|pages=202–217|doi=10.1037/h0071164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, like the rabbit illusion, the tau effect reveals that stimulus timing affects the perception of stimulus spacing. Goldreich (2007)&lt;ref name=Goldreich_2007 /&gt; proposed that the cutaneous rabbit illusion and the tau effect both result from the same low-speed prior expectation. Indeed, the same Bayesian model—characterized by the perceptual length contraction formula above—replicates both effects.&lt;ref name="Goldreich_Tong_2013" /&gt; Another illusion that is plausibly related to the cutaneous rabbit and the tau effect is the [[kappa effect]]. The kappa effect (or perceptual time dilation&lt;ref name=Goldreich_2007 /&gt;) is in essence the converse of the tau effect: the longer of two spatial intervals between stimuli is perceived to be longer in time. Goldreich (2007)&lt;ref name=Goldreich_2007 /&gt; showed that, under conditions of temporal as well as spatial uncertainty, the Bayesian model produces the kappa effect. The perceptual length contraction formula in that case still applies, but the "t" in the formula refers to perceived rather than actual time.

The approach itself is largely voluntary and market-driven but often pressed ahead by favorable government treatment or efforts of development co-operation.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

== History ==
Since the early 1990s the idea of EID evolved from [[Symbiosis|biological symbiosis]].  This concept was adapted by industrial ecologists in the search for innovative approaches to solve problems of waste, energy shortage and degradation of the environment.  A continuous approach towards improving both environmental and economic outcomes is used.&lt;ref&gt;Chung, B. (2007): The Limit and Merit of Taking Sustainable Buildings as a Catalyst for Eco-Industrial Development.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the [[international community]] officially connected development co-operation to sustainable environmental protection for the first time. At the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ([[UNCED]]) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil nearly 180 states signed the conference’s Rio Declaration. Although non-binding, the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development laid out 27 principles that shall guide the increasing inter-connectedness of development cooperation and sustainability.&lt;ref name=UN1992&gt;{{cite web|title=REPORT OF THE UNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE ON ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/conf151/aconf15126-1annex1.htm|publisher=United nations|accessdate=23 April 2014|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the documents drafting was accompanied by a presentation describing the idea of eco-industrial development for the first time.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

In the following years, EID became popular throughout the United States. The recently elected [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] administration installed a summit of business, labor, government and environmental protection representatives to further develop the approach. This summit established the idea of [[eco-industrial park]]s but soon realized that at first a more efficient management of raw materials, energy and waste has to be achieved.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Since then, the broad goals and application principles of EID have hardly changed and only became adapted to the rapid technological progress.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

In 2012 the IGEP Foundation, for the promotion of trade,&lt;ref name=IGEP&gt;{{cite web|title=IGEP Foundation homepage|url=http://www.igep.org/|publisher=IGEP Foundation|accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; published a report called ''Pathway to Eco Industrial Development in India – Concepts and Cases''.&lt;ref name=Pathway&gt;{{cite web|title=Pathway to Eco Industrial Development in India – Concepts and Cases|url=http://www.igep.in/live/hrdpmp/hrdpmaster/igep/content/e48745/e50194/e50195/121004_Pathway_EID_ISOX3uncoated-1.pdf|publisher=IGEP Foundation|accessdate=23 April 2014|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The field is researched by the Nation Centre for Eco-Industrial Development, a joint project by the [[University of Southern California]] and [[Cornell University]].&lt;ref name=usc&gt;{{cite web|title=National Center for Eco-Industrial Development|url=http://www.usc.edu/schools/price/research/NCEID/|publisher=usc.edu|accessdate=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Goals and concepts ==
The primary goal of eco-industrial development is a significant and continuous improvement in both business and environmental performance. Herein, the notion of industry not only relates to private-sector manufacturing but also covers state-owned enterprise, the service sector as well as transportation. EID’s twin guideline is reflected specifically in the “eco” of eco-industrial as it resembles ecology (decrease in pollution and waste) and economy (increase in commercial success) at the same time.&lt;ref name="WhatIs" /&gt; In order to build a framework of defining an enterprise’s sustainable performance at the micro level, resource use optimization, minimization of waste, cleaner technologies and pollution limits are used in achieving a broad range of goals in EID: 
	
* '''[[Resource efficiency]]''' minimizes the use of energy, materials, water and transportation. This, in turn, lowers production costs due to savings in virtually all areas of business.&lt;ref name="Pathway"/&gt;
* '''Cleaner production''' is a predominantly environmental measure, which aims at the reduction or even substitution of toxics, emissions-control or the re-use of residual material.
* '''[[Renewables]]''' in both energy and material use shall eliminate all pollution through fossil fuels.
* '''Greening of buildings or production sites''' installs high energy and environmental standards by relying on innovation in green architecture or engineering. Moreover, new facility and infrastructure design may also enhance the quality of life in neighboring communities significantly.
* '''Environmental management systems''' such as the [[ISO 14000]] ensure a continuous improvement through regular audits and the progressing establishment of environmental targets.
* '''Ecological site planning''' can then combine each of these aspects by developing a clear understanding of air, water and ground system capacities throughout the surrounding eco-system.
  
Eco-industrial development hence explores the possibility of improvement at the local level.&lt;ref name="WhatIs" /&gt; In unique case-to-case analyses, particular geography, human potential or business climate are investigated. In contrast to the widespread race for top-down governmental support such as tax cuts, EID emphasizes locally achievable success and rooms for improvement. As a result, purposeful enforcements of action plans can make a large difference by optimizing the interaction of business, community and ecological systems.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

== Instruments ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2014}}
Eco-industrial development includes and employs four major conceptual instruments. Each of the approaches intends to combine the seemingly antithetic processes of industrial development and bolstering sustainability.

* '''[[Industrial Ecology]]''' focuses on both industrial as well as consumer behavior. By assessing flows of energy and material, the approach determines the flows influences on the environment. In turn, it explores ways and means of optimizing the whole production chain from flow and use of resources to their final transformation. During these analyses, influences of economic, political, regulatory and social factors are key.
* The concept of '''[[Industrial Symbiosis]]''' is based on mainly voluntary cooperation of different industries. By conglomerating complementary enterprises and by then adapting their respective production chains, the presence of each may increase viability and profitability of the others. Therefore, symbioses consider resource scarcity and environmental protection as crucial factors in developing sustainable industries and profits. Industrial Symbiosis often becomes manifest in [[Eco-industrial park]]s.
* '''Environmental Management Systems''' include a wide range of different environmental management approaches in order to ensure continual improvement in sustainability. In early stages, monitoring companies facilitates the identification of hazardous environmental aspects. Further on, objectives and targets are set under consideration of legal requirements. Finally, the establishment of regular audits and other reporting systems combined with continuous follow-up targets shall ensure a constant improvement towards greener industrial production.
* The '''Design for the Environment''' concept originated in engineering disciplines as well as from the product life-cycle analysis. It is a simple but all-encompassing assessment of a product’s potential environmental impact – ranging from energy and materials used for packaging, transportation, consumer use and disposal.

&lt;ref&gt;Taesler, R. (1990/91) "Climate and Building Energy Management". ''Energy and Buildings'', Vol. 15-16, pp 599 - 608.&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute]] in cooperation with Thorbjörn Geiser (member of the board) and Stefan Berglund,&lt;ref&gt;United States Patent 6098893 Comfort control system incorporating weather forecast data and a method for operating such a system (Inventor Stefan Berglund)&lt;/ref&gt; who are currently both employed at eGain Sweden AB. Forecasting method began to be introduced to use in the late 1980s.

Until 2017 inclusive, forecasting method has been introduced in nearly 16 million square metres of floorage of [[residential building]]s and commercial premises. Estimated data indicate 10 - 15 kWh/''m''&lt;sup&gt;''2''&lt;/sup&gt;  reduction of average annual [[heat energy]] consumption. Since forecasting method contains information about future demand and is not in conflict with other methods of increasing [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], it is always a good foreground solution.

==eGain Forecasting in practice==
As far as practical use of forecasting method is concerned, usually [[remote control]] forecasting receivers are used to send and receive data by means of [[General Packet Radio Service|GPRS]] or [[GSM]] network. Then, the forecasting receivers manage the operation of control panels installed in buildings which adjust distribution of heat energy in the [[heating system]] of a given property.

Recently, special remote control weather loggers have started to be used in combination with forecasting receivers. The weather loggers measure [[air temperature]] and [[humidity]] with high accuracy and the measurements are sent in real time to forecasting receivers to which they are connected. Such a turning point in [[technology]] means even more detailed preview of situation and better possibilities of control for users of forecasting method.

The '''Ellsberg paradox''' is a [[paradox]] in [[decision theory]] in which people's choices violate the postulates of [[subjective expected utility]].&lt;ref name=Ellsberg1961&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ellsberg|first=Daniel|authorlink=Daniel Ellsberg|journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]]|volume=75|title=Risk, Ambiguity, and the Savage Axioms|year=1961|pages=643–669 |doi=10.2307/1884324|issue=4 |jstor=1884324 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally taken to be evidence for [[ambiguity aversion]]. The paradox was popularized by [[Daniel Ellsberg]], although a version of it was noted considerably earlier by [[John Maynard Keynes]].{{sfn|Keynes|1921|pp=75–76, paragraph 315, footnote 2}}

The basic idea is that people overwhelmingly prefer taking on risk in situations where they know specific odds rather than an alternative risk scenario in which the odds are completely ambiguous—they will always choose a known probability of winning over an unknown probability of winning even if the known probability is low and the unknown probability could be a guarantee of winning. For example, given a choice of risks to take (such as bets), people "prefer the devil they know" rather than assuming a risk where odds are difficult or impossible to calculate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.econport.org/econport/request?page=man_ru_experiments_ellsberg EconPort discussion of the paradox]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellsberg proposed two separate thought experiments, the proposed choices in which contradict subjective expected utility. The 2-color problem involves bets on two urns, both of which contain balls of two different colors. The 3-color problem, described below, involves bets on a single urn, which contains balls of three different colors.

==The one-urn paradox==
Consider an [[urn problem|urn]] containing 30 red balls and 60 other balls that are either black or yellow. It is unknown how many black or how many yellow balls there are, but that the total number of black balls plus the total number of yellow equals 60. The balls are well mixed so that each individual ball is as likely to be drawn as any other. Given a choice between two gambles:

:{| class="wikitable" align=center
!Gamble A !! Gamble B
|-
|You receive $100 if you draw a red ball || You receive $100 if you draw a black ball
|}

Also you are given the choice between these two gambles (about a different draw from the same urn):

:{| class="wikitable" align=center
!Gamble C !! Gamble D
|-
|You receive $100 if you draw a red or yellow ball ||You receive $100 if you draw a black or yellow ball
|}

This situation poses both ''[[Knightian uncertainty]]'' – how many of the non-red balls are yellow and how many are black, which is not quantified – and ''probability'' – whether the ball is red or non-red, which is {{sfrac|1|3}} vs. {{sfrac|2|3}}.

===Utility theory interpretation===
Utility theory models the choice by assuming that in choosing between these gambles, people assume a ''probability'' that the non-red balls are yellow versus black, and then compute the ''expected utility'' of the two gambles.

Since the prizes are the same, it follows that you will ''prefer'' Gamble A to Gamble B [[if and only if]] you believe that drawing a red ball is more likely than drawing a black ball (according to expected utility theory). Also, there would be no clear preference between the choices if you thought that a red ball was as likely as a black ball. Similarly it follows that you will ''prefer'' Gamble C to Gamble D ''if, and only if'', you believe that drawing a red or yellow ball is more likely than drawing a black or yellow ball. It might seem intuitive that, if drawing a red ball is more likely than drawing a black ball, then drawing a red or yellow ball is also more likely than drawing a black or yellow ball. So, supposing you ''prefer'' Gamble A to Gamble B, it follows that you will also ''prefer'' Gamble C to Gamble D. And, supposing instead that you ''prefer'' Gamble B to Gamble A, it follows that you will also ''prefer'' Gamble D to Gamble C.

When surveyed, however, most people ''strictly prefer'' Gamble A to Gamble B and Gamble D to Gamble C. Therefore, some assumptions of the expected utility theory are violated.

===Numerical demonstration===
Mathematically, the estimated probabilities of each color ball can be represented as: ''R'', ''Y'', and ''B''. If you ''strictly prefer'' Gamble A to Gamble B, by utility theory, it is presumed this preference is reflected by the expected utilities of the two gambles: specifically, it must be the case that

: &lt;math&gt;R \cdot U(\$100) + (1-R) \cdot U(\$0) &gt; B\cdot U(\$100) + (1-B) \cdot U(\$0) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''U''(&amp;nbsp;) is your utility function. If ''U''($100)&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''U''($0) (you strictly prefer $100 to nothing), this simplifies to:

: &lt;math&gt;R [U(\$100) - U(\$0)] &gt; B [U(\$100) - U(\$0)] \Longleftrightarrow R &gt; B \; &lt;/math&gt;

If you also strictly prefer Gamble D to Gamble C, the following inequality is similarly obtained:

: &lt;math&gt;B\cdot U(\$100) + Y\cdot U(\$100) + R \cdot U(\$0) &gt; R \cdot U(\$100) + Y\cdot U(\$100) + B \cdot U(\$0) &lt;/math&gt;

This simplifies to:

: &lt;math&gt;B [U(\$100) - U(\$0)] &gt; R [U(\$100) - U(\$0)] \Longleftrightarrow B &gt; R \;&lt;/math&gt;

This contradiction indicates that your preferences are inconsistent with expected-utility theory.

===Generality of the paradox===
The result holds regardless of your [[utility function]]. Indeed, the amount of the payoff is likewise irrelevant. Whichever gamble is selected, the prize for winning it is the same, and the cost of losing it is the same (no cost), so ultimately, there are only two outcomes: receive a specific amount of money, or receive nothing. Therefore, it is sufficient to assume that the preference is to receive some money to nothing (and, this assumption is not necessary: in the mathematical treatment above, it was assumed ''U''($100)&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''U''($0), but a contradiction can still be obtained for ''U''($100)&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''U''($0) and for ''U''($100)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''U''($0)).

In addition, the result holds regardless of your [[risk aversion]]. All the gambles involve risk. By choosing Gamble D, you have a 1 in 3 chance of receiving nothing, and by choosing Gamble A, you have a 2 in 3 chance of receiving nothing. If Gamble A was less risky than Gamble B, it would follow&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Segal |first=Uzi |last2= |first2= |date=1987 |title=The Ellsberg Paradox and Risk Aversion: An Anticipated Utility Approach  |url= |journal=[[International Economic Review]] |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=175–202 |doi=10.2307/2526866 |jstor=2526866  }}&lt;/ref&gt; that Gamble C was less risky than Gamble D (and vice versa), so, risk is not averted in this way.

However, because the exact chances of winning are known for Gambles A and D, and not known for Gambles B and C, this can be taken as evidence for some sort of [[ambiguity aversion]] which cannot be accounted for in expected utility theory. It has been demonstrated that this phenomenon occurs only when the choice set permits comparison of the ambiguous proposition with a less vague proposition (but not when ambiguous propositions are evaluated in isolation).&lt;ref name=FoxTversky1995&gt;
{{Cite journal | last1=Fox | first1= Craig R. |last2=Tversky |first2=Amos |authorlink2=Amos Tversky|year=1995|title=Ambiguity Aversion and Comparative Ignorance|journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]]|volume=110|pages=585–603 | doi=10.2307/2946693|issue=3 | jstor=2946693 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible explanations===

There have been various attempts to provide decision-theoretic explanations of Ellsberg's observation. Since the probabilistic information available to the decision-maker is incomplete, these attempts sometimes focus on quantifying the non-probabilistic ambiguity which the decision-maker faces – see [[Knightian uncertainty]]. That is, these alternative approaches sometimes suppose that the agent formulates a subjective (though not necessarily [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]]) probability for possible outcomes.

One such attempt is based on [[info-gap decision theory]]. The agent is told precise probabilities of some outcomes, though the practical meaning of the probability numbers is not entirely clear. For instance, in the gambles discussed above, the probability of a red ball is {{sfrac|30|90}}, which is a precise number. Nonetheless, the agent may not distinguish, intuitively, between this and, say, {{sfrac|30|91}}. No probability information whatsoever is provided regarding other outcomes, so the agent has very unclear subjective impressions of these probabilities.

In light of the ambiguity in the probabilities of the outcomes, the agent is unable to evaluate a precise expected utility. Consequently, a choice based on ''maximizing'' the expected utility is also impossible. The info-gap approach supposes that the agent implicitly formulates info-gap models for the subjectively uncertain probabilities. The agent then tries to [[satisficing|satisfice]] the expected utility and to maximize the robustness against uncertainty in the imprecise probabilities. This robust-satisficing approach can be developed explicitly to show that the choices of decision-makers should display precisely the preference reversal which Ellsberg observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ben-Haim |first=Yakov |year=2006 |title=Info-gap Decision Theory: Decisions Under Severe Uncertainty |edition=2nd |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=0-12-373552-1 |nopp=true |pages=section 11.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another possible explanation is that this type of game triggers a deceit aversion mechanism. Many humans naturally assume in real-world situations that if they are not told the probability of a certain event, it is to deceive them. People make the same decisions in the [[experiment]] that they would about related but not identical real-life problems where the experimenter would be likely to be a deceiver acting against the subject's interests. When faced with the choice between a red ball and a black ball, the probability of {{sfrac|30|90}} is compared to the ''lower part'' of the {{sfrac|0|90}}–{{sfrac|60|90}} range (the probability of getting a black ball). The average person expects there to be fewer black balls than yellow balls because in most real-world situations, it would be to the advantage of the experimenter to put fewer black balls in the urn when offering such a gamble. On the other hand, when offered a choice between red and yellow balls and black and yellow balls, people assume that there must be fewer than 30 yellow balls as would be necessary to deceive them. When making the decision, it is quite possible that people simply forget to consider that the experimenter does not have a chance to modify the contents of the urn in between the draws. In real-life situations, even if the urn is not to be modified, people would be afraid of being deceived on that front as well.&lt;ref name=lima09&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lima Filho|first1=Roberto IRL|title=Rationality Intertwined: Classical vs Institutional View |date=July 2, 2009|pages=5–6|doi=10.2139/ssrn.2389751|ssrn=2389751}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A modification of utility theory to incorporate uncertainty as distinct from risk is [[Choquet expected utility]], which also proposes a solution to the paradox.

===Alternative explanations===
Other alternative explanations include the competence hypothesis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Preference and Belief: Ambiguity and Competence in Choice under Uncertainty |journal=Journal of Risk and Uncertainty |volume=4 |year=1991 |pages=5–28 |doi=10.1007/bf00057884|last1 = Heath|first1 = Chip|last2=Tversky |first2=Amos }}&lt;/ref&gt; and comparative ignorance hypothesis.&lt;ref name="FoxTversky1995"/&gt; These theories attribute the source of the ambiguity aversion to the participant's pre-existing knowledge.

The claim that “everything which is not fobidden is allowed” is a principle only of English law does not stand the test of reality. In fact, it is a common principle of liberal democracies. In Germany, it has constitutional rank under Art. 2(1) of the GG which protects the general freedom to act (Allgemeine Handlungsfreiheit), as demonstrated e.g. by the judgment of the Bundesverfassungsgericht known as “Reiten im Walde” (BVerfGE 80, 137).

== Imitative learning in animals ==
On the most basic level, research performed by A.L. Saggerson, David N. George, and R.C. Honey showed that [[Columbidae|pigeons]] were able to learn a basic process that would lead to the delivery of a reward by watching a demonstrator pigeon.&lt;ref&gt;Saggerson, George, &amp; Honey.  (2005).  Journal of Experimental Psychology Animal Behavior Processes, 31 (3), 289 –300.&lt;/ref&gt;  A demonstrator pigeon was trained to peck a panel in response to one [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] (e.g. a red light) and hop on the panel in response to a second stimulus (e.g. a green light).  After proficiency in this task was established in the demonstrator pigeon, other learner pigeons were placed in a video-monitored observation chamber.  After every second observed trial, these learner pigeons were then individually placed in the demonstrator pigeon's box and presented the same test.  The learner pigeons displayed competent performance on the task, and thus it was concluded that the learner pigeons had formed a response-outcome association while observing.  However, the researchers noted that an alternative interpretation of these results could be that the learner pigeons had instead acquired outcome-response associations that guided their behavior and that further testing was needed to establish if this was a valid alternative.

which have previously been [[landfill]]ed are excavated and processed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enviroalternatives.com/landfill.html Landfill Mining] Landfill Mining, Preserving Resources through Integrated Sustainable Management of Waste, Technical Brief from the World Resource Foundation&lt;/ref&gt; The function of landfill mining is to reduce the amount of landfill mass encapsulated within the closed landfill and/or temporarily remove hazardous material to allow protective measures to be taken before the landfill mass is replaced. In the process, mining recovers valuable recyclable materials, a combustible fraction, soil, and landfill space. The aeration of the landfill soil is a secondary benefit regarding the landfill's future use. The combustible fraction is useful for the generation of power. The overall appearance of the landfill mining procedure is a sequence of processing machines laid out in a functional conveyor system. The operating principle is to excavate, sieve and sort the landfill material.

The concept of  mining was introduced as early as 1953 at the [[Hiriya]] landfill operated by the Dan Region Authority next to the city of [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://som.eldoc.ub.rug.nl/FILES/reports/themeB/2003/03B39/03b39.pdf Landfill Mining Paper] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010001855/http://som.eldoc.ub.rug.nl/FILES/reports/themeB/2003/03B39/03b39.pdf |date=2006-10-10 }} D.J. van der Zee, ''et al.''

== Practical applications ==
Landfill mining is also possible in countries where land is not available for new landfill sites. In this instance landfill space can be reclaimed by the extraction of [[biodegradable waste]] and other substances then refilled with wastes requiring disposal.

Mining construction landfill sites is the simplest form of landfill mining. Construction landfills in the United States contain three basic components, wood, scrap metal and gypsum, or drywall, along with a minimal amount of other construction materials. The wood collected can be used as fuel in coal burning power plants and the scrap metal reprocessed. European landfills tend to have more masonry from demolished bricks, tiles and concrete.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theconstructionindex.co.uk/news/view/the-case-for-pre-demolition-audits The case for pre demolition audits]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mining of municipal landfills is more complicated and has to be based on the expected content of the landfill. Older landfills, in the United States before 1994, were often capped and closed, essentially entombing the waste. This can be beneficial for waste recovery. It can also create a higher risk for [[toxic waste]] and [[leachate]] exposure as the landfill has not fully processed the stewing wastes. Mining of [[bioreactor landfill]]s and properly stabilized modern sanitary landfills provides its own benefits. The biodegradable wastes are more easily sieved out, leaving the non-biodegradable materials readily accessible. The quality of these materials for recycling and reprocessing purposes is not as high as initially recycled materials, however materials such as aluminum and steel are usually excluded from this. 
 
Landfill mining is most useful as a method to remediate hazardous landfills. Landfills that were established before [[landfill liner]] technology was well established often leak their unprocessed leachate into underlying aquifers. This is both an [[environmental hazard]] and also a legal liability. In the US, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] requires closed landfills to be monitored for at least 30 years after waste placement ceases. Mining the landfill simply to lay a safe liner is a last, but sometimes necessary resort.

== Methods ==
The parts of the mining process are the different mining machines. Depending on the complexity of the process more or fewer machines can be used. Machinery is easily transported on trucks from site to site, mounted on trailers.

An [[excavator]] or [[Loader (equipment)|front end loader]] uncovers the landfilled materials and places them on a moving floor conveyor belt to be taken to the sorting machinery. A [[trommel]] is used to separate materials by size. First, a large trommel separates materials like appliances and fabrics. A smaller trommel then allows the biodegraded soil fraction to pass through leaving non-biodegradable, recyclable materials on the screen to be collected. 

An electromagnet is used to remove the [[ferrous]] material from the waste mass as it passes along the conveyor belt.

A [[Loader (equipment)|front end loader]] is used to move sorted materials to trucks for further processing.

Odor control sprayers are wheeled tractors with a cab and movable spray arm mounted on a rotating platform. A large reservoir tank mounted behind the cab holds neutralizing agents, usually in liquid form, to reduce the smell of exposed wastes.

Depending on the level of resource recovery, material can be put through an [[air classifier]] which separates light organic material from heavy organic material. The separate streams are then loaded, by front end loaders, onto trucks either for further processing or for sale. Further manual processing can be done on site if processing facilities are too far away to justify the transportation costs.

A '''list of metaphors in the English language''' organised by type. A [[metaphor]] is a literary [[figure of speech]] that uses an image, story or [[tangibility|tangible]] thing to represent a less tangible thing or some intangible quality or idea; e.g., "Her eyes were glistening jewels".  ''Metaphor'' may also be used for any [[rhetoric]]al [[Literal and figurative language|figures of speech]] that achieve their effects via association, comparison or resemblance.  In this broader sense, [[antithesis]], [[hyperbole]], [[metonymy]] and [[simile]] would all be considered types of metaphor. [[Aristotle]] used both this sense and the regular, current sense above.&lt;ref name="English Language 1992 pp.653"&gt;''The Oxford Companion to the English Language'' (1992) pp.653–55: "A rhetorical figure with two senses, both originating with Aristotle in the 4c BC: (I) All figures of speech that achieve their effects through association, comparison and resemblance. Figures like antithesis, hyperbole, metonymy and simile are [in that sense] all species of metaphor. [But] this sense is not current, ..."&lt;/ref&gt;
With metaphor, unlike [[analogy]], specific interpretations are not given explicitly.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1059">The '''measure''' in [[quantum physics]] is the integration [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] used for performing a [[line integral|path integral]].

In [[quantum field theory]], one must sum over all possible histories of a system. 
When summing over possible histories, which may be very similar to each other, one has to decide when two histories are to be considered different, and when they are to be considered the same, in order not to count the same history twice. This decision is coded within the concept of the '''measure''' by an '''[[Observer (quantum physics)|observer]]'''.

In fact, the possible histories can be deformed continuously, and therefore the sum is in fact an [[integral]], known as [[path integral formulation|path integral]].&lt;br&gt;
In the limit where the sum is becoming an integral, the concept of the measure described above is replaced by an integration [[measure (mathematics)|measure]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6323">'''Meinong's jungle''' is the name given to the repository of non-existent entities in the [[ontology]] of [[Alexius Meinong]].&lt;ref name=jacquette/&gt;

==Overview==
Meinong, an [[Austria]]n [[philosopher]] active at the turn of the [[20th century philosophy|20th century]], believed that since non-existent things could apparently be [[reference|referred to]], they must have some sort of [[being]], which he termed ''sosein'' ("being so"). A [[unicorn]] and a [[pegasus]] are both non-being; yet it's true that unicorns have horns and pegasi have wings. Thus non-existent things like unicorns, square circles, and golden mountains can have different properties, and must have a 'being such-and-such' even though they lack 'being' proper.&lt;ref name=jacquette/&gt; The strangeness of such entities led to this ontological realm being referred to as "Meinong's jungle". The jungle is described in Meinong's work ''Über Annahmen'' (1902).&lt;ref name=kneale/&gt; The name is credited to [[William Kneale (logician)|William C. Kneale]], whose ''Probability and Induction'' (1949) includes the passage "after wandering in Meinong's jungle of subsistence ... philosophers are now agreed that propositions cannot be regarded as ultimate entities".&lt;ref name=kneale&gt;{{cite book|title=Probability and Induction |first=William C. |last=Kneale |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press |year=1949 |oclc=907671 |pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Meinongian theory of objects (''Gegenstandstheorie'') was influential in the debate over [[sense and reference]] between [[Gottlob Frege]] and [[Bertrand Russell]] which led to the establishment of [[analytic philosophy]] and contemporary [[philosophy of language]]. Russell's [[theory of descriptions]], in the words of [[P.M.S. Hacker]], enables him to "thin out the luxuriant Meinongian jungle of entities (such as the round square), which, it had appeared, must ''in some sense'' subsist in order to be talked about".&lt;ref name=hacker&gt;{{cite book | last = Hacker | first = P. M. S. |authorlink=Peter Hacker | title = Insight and Illusion | publisher = Clarendon Press | location = Oxford | year = 1986 | isbn = 0-19-824783-4 |pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the theory of descriptions, speakers are not committed to asserting the existence of referents for the names they use.

Meinong's jungle is cited as an objection to Meinong's semantics, as the latter commits one to ontically undesirable objects;&lt;ref name=jacquette&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jacquette |first=Dale |title=On Defoliating Meinong's Jungle |journal=Axiomathes |issue=1–2 |year=1996 |pages=17–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is desirable to be able to speak meaningfully about unicorns, the objection goes, but not to have to believe in them. [[Nominalism|Nominalists]] (who believe that general or abstract terms and [[wikt:predicate|predicates]] exist but that either [[universals]] or [[abstract objects]] do not) find Meinong's jungle particularly unpalatable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Klima |editor=Karel Lambert | first = Gyula | title = New Essays in Free Logic | publisher = Kluwer Academic Publishers | location = Boston | year = 2001 | isbn = 1-4020-0216-5 |chapter=Existence and Reference in Medieval Logic |pages=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Colin McGinn]] puts it, "[g]oing naively by the linguistic appearances leads not only to logical impasse but also to metaphysical extravagance—as with Meinong's jungle, infested with shadowy Being."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = McGinn | first = Colin |authorlink=Colin McGinn | title = The Problem of Consciousness | publisher = Blackwell | location = Oxford | year = 1993 | isbn = 0-631-18803-7 |pages=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; An uneasiness with the [[ontological commitment]]s of Meinong's theory is commonly expressed in the ''bon mot'' "we should cut back Meinong's jungle with [[Occam's razor]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Smith | first = A. D. | title = The Problem of Perception | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-674-00841-3 |pages=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meinong's jungle was defended by [[modal realism|modal realists]], whose [[possible world semantics]] offered a more palatable variation of Meinong's ''Gegenstandstheorie'', as [[Jaakko Hintikka]] explains:
{{quote|If you ask "Where are the non-existent objects?" the answer is, "Each in its own possible world." The only trouble with that notorious thicket, Meinong's jungle, is that it has not been zoned, plotted and divided into manageable lots, better known as possible worlds.|sign=Hintikka, Jaakko|source=''The Logic of Epistemology and the Epistemology of Logic'', p.&amp;nbsp;40&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hintikka | first = Jaakko | authorlink=Jaakko Hintikka |title = The Logic of Epistemology and the Epistemology of Logic | publisher = Kluwer Academic | year = 1989 | isbn = 0-7923-0040-8 |pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, modal realists retain the problem of explaining reference to impossible objects such as square circles. For Meinong, such objects simply have a 'being so' that precludes their having ordinary 'being'. But this entails that 'being so' in Meinong's sense is not equivalent to existing in a possible world.

'''Models of communication''' are [[conceptual model]]s used to explain the human [[communication]] [[:wikt:process|process]]. The first major model for communication was developed in 1948 by [[Claude Elwood Shannon]] and published with an introduction by [[Warren Weaver]] for [[Bell Laboratories]].&lt;ref name="Shannon"&gt;Shannon, C. E., &amp; Weaver, W. (1949). ''The mathematical theory of communication''. Urbana, Illinois: [[University of Illinois Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Theory of communication|basic concept]], communication is the process of sending and receiving [[message]]s or transferring [[information]] from one part (sender) to another (receiver).{{sfn|Craig|1999}}

In 1960, David Berlo expanded the linear transmission model &lt;ref name="Berlo"&gt;Berlo, D. K. (1960). The process of communication; an introduction to theory and practice. New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston. Claude E Shannon, W. W. (1949)&lt;/ref&gt; with the Sender-Message-Channel-Receiver(SMCR) Model of Communication. &lt;ref name="Schulz"&gt;Schulz, Peter. Cobley, Paul. (2013). Theories and Models of Communication. Berlin: De Gruyter Mouton. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Wilbur Schramm introduced a model that identified multiple variables in communication which includes the transmitter, encoding, media, decoding, and receiver. &lt;ref name="Qing-Lan"&gt;Qing-Lan Chen, Chiou-Shuei Wei, Mei-Yao Huang and Chiu-Chi Wei. (2013) A model for project communication
medium evaluation and selection.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shannon-Weaver Model==
Elwood Shannon and Warren Weaver were engineers that worked for Bell Telephone Labs in the United States. Their goal was to make sure that the telephone cables and radio waves were working at the maximum efficiency. Therefore, they developed the Shannon-Weaver model which had an intention to expand a mathematical theory of communication.&lt;ref name="Chandler"&gt;Chandler Daniel, The Transmission Model of Communication. http://transcriptions-2008.english.ucsb.edu/archive/courses/warner/english197/Schedule_files/Chandler/Transmission.model_files/trans.htm (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; The Shannon–Weaver model was developed in 1949 which is referred as the 'mother of all models'.&lt;ref name="Hollnagel"&gt;Erik Hollnagel, David D. Woods. Joint Cognitive Systems: Foundations of Cognitive Systems Engineering. CRC Press. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The model is well accepted as a main initial model for Communication Studies which has grown since then.&lt;ref name="Fiske"&gt; Fiske, John. Introduction to Communication Studies. London: Routledge (Chapter 1, 'Communication Theory' is a good introduction to this topic). (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

As well, the [[Shannon-Weaver model]] was designed to mirror the functioning of radio and telephone technology. Their initial model consisted of four primary parts: [[sender]], [[message]], [[Channel (communications)|channel]], and [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]]. The sender was the part of a [[telephone]] a person speaks into, the channel was the telephone itself, and the receiver was the part of the phone through which one can hear the person on the other end of the line. Shannon and Weaver also recognized that there may often be static or background sounds that interfere with the process of the other partner in a telephone conversation; they referred to this as noise. Certain types of background sounds can also indicate the absence of a signal.&lt;ref name="Chandler"/&gt;

The original model of Shannon and Weaver has five elements: information source, transmitter, channel, receiver, and destination.  To illustrate the process of the communication the first step is the information source where the information is stored. Next, in order to send the information, the message is encoded into signals, so it can travel to its destination. After the message is encoded, it goes through the channel which the signals are adapted for the transmission. In addition, the channel carried the noise course which is any interference that might happen to lead to the signal receive a different information from the source. After the channel, the message arrives in the receiver step where the message reconstruct (decode) from the signal. Finally, the message arrives at the destination.&lt;ref name="Faustine" /&gt;

In a simple model, often referred to as ''the transmission model'' or ''standard view of communication'', [[information]] or content (e.g. a message in [[natural language]]) is sent in some form (as [[spoken language]]) from an emissor/ sender/ [[encoder]] to a destination/ receiver/ decoder. According to this common communication-related conception, communication is viewed as a means of sending and receiving information. The strengths of this model are its simplicity, generality, and quantifiability. The mathematicians Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver structured this model on the basis of the following elements:

* An [[information source]], which produces a message.
* A [[transmitter]], which encodes the message into signals
* A [[Channel (communications)|channel]], for which signals are adapted for transmission
* A [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]], which reconstructs the encoded message from a sequence of received signals and decodes it.
* An information destination, where the message arrives.

Shannon and Weaver argued that this concept entails three levels of problems for communication:

# The technical problem: how accurately can the message be transmitted?
# The [[semantic]] problem: how precisely is the meaning 'conveyed'?
# The effectiveness problem: how effectively does the received meaning affect behavior?

[[Daniel Chandler]] criticizes the transmission model in the following terms:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = The Transmission Model of Communication|last = Chandler|first = Daniel|authorlink = |coauthors = |year = 1994|publisher = University of Western Australia|location = |isbn = |page = |pages = |url = http://visual-memory.co.uk/daniel/Documents/short/trans.html|accessdate = 11.06.2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* It assumes that communicators are isolated individuals.
* It makes no allowance for differing purposes.
* It makes no allowance for differing interpretations.
* It makes no allowance for unequal power relationships.

== Berlo ==

In 1960, David Berlo expanded Shannon and Weaver's 1949 linear model of communication and created the Sender-Message-Channel-Receiver (SMCR) Model of Communication.&lt;ref&gt;Berlo, D. K. (1960).'' The process of communication''. New York, New York: Holt, Rinehart, &amp; Winston.&lt;/ref&gt; The SMCR Model of Communication separated the model into clear parts and has been expanded upon by other scholars.

The Berlo's communication process is a simple application for communication of person-to-person which include communication source, encoder, message, channel, decoder, and communication receiver. &lt;ref name="Ann"&gt;Ann, Bette. Berlo's Communication Process Model as Applied to the Behavioral Theories of Maslow, Herzberg, and McGrego. Stead Source: The Academy of Management Journal, Vol. 15, No. 3 (Sep., 1972), pp. 389-394 Published by: Academy of Management Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/254868 &lt;/ref&gt; In addition, David Berlo presented some factors that influence the communication process between two people. The factors include communication skills, awareness level, social system, cultural system, and attitude.&lt;ref name="Sluková"&gt;Sluková, Petra Zia. Studies of Information and Knowledge Management in he European Context: No. 5 Communication of Information Reg. No: CZ.1.07/2.2.00/07.0284 OP: Education for Competitiveness Support area. 2.2 University Education Realization: VŠB-Technical University of Ostrava, Faculty of Economics, separate unit: Business Academy and HPS Valašské Meziříčí&lt;/ref&gt;

The Berlo's Model of Communication process starts at the source. This is the part where determine the communication skills, attitude, knowledge, social system, and culture of the people involved in the communication. After the message is developed which is elements in a set of symbols. &lt;ref name="Sluková" /&gt; Then the encoder step beginning. The encoder process is where the motor skills take place by speaking or writing. &lt;ref name="Ann" /&gt; The message goes through the channel which carries the message by hearing, seeing, touching, smelling, or tasting.&lt;ref name="Berlo" /&gt; Then the decoder process takes place. In this process, the receiver interpreter the message with her or him sensory skills. Finally, the communication receiver gets the whole message understood.&lt;ref name="Ann" /&gt;

== Schramm ==

Communication is usually described along a few major dimensions: Message (what type of things are communicated), source / emissor / sender / [[encoder]] (by whom), form (in which form), channel (through which [[media (communication)|medium]]), destination / receiver / target / decoder (to whom), and Receiver. [[Wilbur Schramm]] (1954) also indicated that we should also examine the impact that a message has (both desired and undesired) on the target of the message.&lt;ref&gt;Schramm, W. (1954). How communication works. In W. Schramm (Ed.), ''The process and effects of communication'' (pp. 3-26). Urbana, Illinois: University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Between parties, communication includes acts that confer knowledge and experiences, give advice and commands, and ask questions. These acts may take many forms, in one of the various manners of communication. The form depends on the abilities of the group communicating. Together, communication content and form make [[message]]s that are sent towards a destination. The target can be oneself, another [[Interpersonal Communication|person]] or being, another entity (such as a corporation or group of beings).

Communication can be seen as processes of [[information transmission]] governed by three levels of [[semiotic]] rules:
#[[Syntactic]] (formal properties of signs and symbols),
#[[Pragmatics|Pragmatic]] (concerned with the relations between signs/expressions and their users) and
#[[Semantic]] (study of relationships between signs and symbols and what they represent).

Therefore, communication is [[Interpersonal relationship|social interaction]] where at least two interacting agents share a common set of signs and a common set of [[semiotic]] rules. This commonly held rule in some sense ignores [[semiotics|autocommunication]], including [[intrapersonal communication]] via [[diary|diaries]] or self-talk, both secondary phenomena that followed the primary acquisition of communicative competences within social interactions.

== Barnlund ==

In light of these weaknesses, Barnlund (1970) proposed a transactional model of communication.&lt;ref&gt;Barnlund, D. C. (2008). A transactional model of communication. In. C. D. Mortensen (Eds.), ''Communication theory'' (2nd ed., pp47-57). New Brunswick, New Jersey: Transaction.&lt;/ref&gt;  The basic premise of the transactional model of communication is that individuals are simultaneously engaging in the sending and receiving of messages.

In a slightly more complex form, a sender and a receiver are linked [[wikt:reciprocal|reciprocally]]. This second attitude of communication, referred to as the constitutive model or constructionist view, focuses on how an individual communicates as the determining factor of the way the message will be interpreted. Communication is viewed as a conduit; a passage in which information travels from one individual to another and this information becomes separate from the communication itself. A particular instance of communication is called a [[speech act]].  The sender's personal filters and the receiver's personal filters may vary depending upon different regional traditions, cultures, or gender; which may alter the intended meaning of message contents.  In the presence of "[[communication noise|noise]]" on the transmission channel (air, in this case), reception and decoding of content may be faulty, and thus the speech act may not achieve the desired effect. One problem with this encode-transmit-receive-decode model is that the processes of encoding and decoding imply that the sender and receiver each possess something that functions as a [code-book], and that these two code books are, at the very least, similar if not identical.  Although something like code books is implied by the model, they are nowhere represented in the model, which creates many conceptual difficulties.

Theories of [[co-regulation]] describe communication as a creative and dynamic continuous process, rather than a discrete exchange of information. Canadian media scholar [[Harold Innis]] had the theory that people use different types of media to communicate and which one they choose to use will offer different possibilities for the shape and durability of society.&lt;ref name="Wark1997"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wark|first=McKenzie|year=1997|title=The Virtual Republic|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin, St Leonards}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2017}} His famous example of this is using [[ancient Egypt]] and looking at the ways they built themselves out of media with very different properties stone and papyrus. Papyrus is what he called ''''Space Binding''''. it made possible the transmission of written orders across space, empires and enables the waging of distant military campaigns and colonial administration. The other is stone and ''''Time Binding'''', through the construction of temples and the pyramids can sustain their authority generation to generation, through this media they can change and shape communication in their society.&lt;ref name="Wark1997"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2017}}

== Constructionist ==

There is an additional working definition of communication to consider{{examples|date=October 2011}} that authors like Richard A. Lanham (2003) and as far back as Erving Goffman (1959) have highlighted.  This is a progression from Lasswell's attempt to define human communication through to this century and revolutionized into the constructionist model.  Constructionists believe that the process of communication is in itself the only messages that exist.  The packaging can not be separated from the social and historical context from which it arose, therefore the substance to look at in communication theory is style for Richard Lanham and the performance of self for Erving Goffman.

Lanham chose to view communication as the rival to the over encompassing use of [[CBS model]] (which pursued to further the transmission model). CBS model argues that clarity, brevity, and sincerity are the only purpose to prose discourse, therefore communication. Lanham wrote: "If words matter too, if the whole range of human motive is seen as animating prose discourse, then rhetoric analysis leads us to the essential questions about prose style" (Lanham 10). This is saying that rhetoric and style are fundamentally important; they are not errors to what we actually intend to transmit. The process which we construct and deconstruct meaning deserves analysis.

Erving Goffman sees the performance of self as the most important frame to understand communication. Goffman wrote: "What does seem to be required of the individual is that he learn enough pieces of expression to be able to 'fill in' and manage, more or less, any part that he is likely to be given" (Goffman 73), highlighting the significance of expression.

The truth in both cases is the articulation of the message and the package as one. The construction of the message from social and historical context is the seed as is the pre-existing message is for the transmission model. Therefore, any look into communication theory should include the possibilities drafted by such great scholars as [[Richard A. Lanham]] and Goffman that style and performance is the whole process. lun

Communication stands so deeply rooted in human [[behavior]]s and the structures of [[society]] that scholars have difficulty thinking of it while excluding social or behavioral events.{{weasel inline|date=October 2011}} Because communication theory remains a relatively young field of inquiry and integrates itself with other disciplines such as philosophy, psychology, and sociology, one probably cannot {{As of|2006|alt=yet}} expect a consensus conceptualization of communication across disciplines.{{weasel inline|date=October 2011}}

Communication Model Terms as provided by Rothwell (11-15):
*''Noise''; interference with effective transmission and reception of a message.
**For example;
***physical noise or external noise which are environmental distractions such as poorly heated rooms, startling sounds, appearances of things, music playing some where else, and someone talking really loudly near you.
***physiological noise are biological influences that distract you from communicating competently such as sweaty palms, pounding heart, butterfly in the stomach, induced by speech anxiety, or feeling sick, exhausted at work, the ringing noise in your ear, being really hungry, and if you have a runny nose or a cough.
***psychological noise are the preconception bias and assumptions such as thinking someone who speaks like a valley girl is dumb, or someone from a foreign country can’t speak English well so you speak loudly and slowly to them.
***semantic noise are word choices that are confusing and distracting such as using the word tri-syllabic instead of three syllables.
*''Sender''; the initiator and encoder of a message
*''Receiver''; the one that receives the message (the listener) and the decoder of a message
*''Decode''; translates the sender's spoken idea/message into something the receiver understands by using their knowledge of language from personal experience.
*''Encode''; puts the idea into spoken language while putting their own meaning into the word/message.
*''Channel''; the medium through which the message travels such as through oral communication (radio, television, phone, in person) or written communication (letters, email, text messages)
*''Feedback''; the receiver's verbal and nonverbal responses to a message such as a nod for understanding (nonverbal), a raised eyebrow for being confused (nonverbal), or asking a question to clarify the message (verbal).
*''Message''; the verbal and nonverbal components of language that is sent to the receiver by the sender which conveys an idea.

Humans act toward people or things on the basis of the meanings they assign to those people or things.
-"Language is the source of meaning". 
-Meaning arises out of the social interaction people have with each other.

-Meaning is not inherent in objects but it is negotiated through the use of language, hence the term symbolic interactionism.
As human beings, we have the ability to name things.
Symbols, including names, are arbitrary signs.
By talking with others, we ascribe meaning to words and develop a universe of discourse
A symbol is a stimulus that has a learned/shared meaning and a value for people
Significant symbols can be nonverbal as well as linguistic.

-Negative responses can consequently reduce a person to nothing.
-Our expectations evoke responses that confirm what we originally anticipated, resulting in a self-fulfilling prophecy.

== Linear ==

This is a one-way model to communicate with others. It consists of the '''sender''' encoding a message and channeling it to the '''receiver''' in the presence of noise. In this model there is no feedback or response which may allow for a continuous 
exchange of information (F.N.S. Palma, 1993).

The linear model was first introduced by Shannon &amp; Weaver in 1949. In the linear communication model, the message travels one direction from the start point to the endpoint. In other words, once the sender sends the message to the receiver the communication process ends. Many communications online use the linear communication model. For example, when you send an email, post a blog, or share something on social media. However, the linear model does not explain many other forms of communication including face-to-face conversation.&lt;ref name="McCornack"&gt;McCornack, Steven. Ortiz, Joseph. Choice &amp; Connections: An Introduction to Communication. (2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interactive/convergence ==

It is two linear models stacked on top of each other. The sender channels a message to the receiver and the receiver then becomes the sender and channels a message to the original sender. This model has added feedback, indicating that communication is not a one way but a two way process. It also has "field of experience" which includes our cultural background, ethnicity geographic location, extent of travel, and general personal experiences accumulated over the course of your lifetime. Draw backs – there is feedback but it is not simultaneous.
[[File:Interactive.png|thumb|left|alt=An Interactive Model of Communication.|The Interactive Model.]]
*For example, – instant messaging. The sender sends an IM to the receiver, then the original sender has to wait for the IM from the original receiver to react. Or a question/answer session where you just ask a question then you get an answer.

== Communication theory framework ==

{{Main article|Theory of communication}}

Communication theory can be seen from one of the following viewpoints:

*Mechanistic:  This view{{who|date=October 2011}} considers communication as a perfect transaction of a message from the sender to the receiver. (as seen in the diagram above)
*Psychological:  This view{{who|date=October 2011}} considers communication as the act of sending a message to a receiver, and the feelings and thoughts of the receiver upon interpreting the message.
*Social [[Social constructionism|Constructionist]] (Symbolic Interactionist):  This view considers communication to be the product of the interactants sharing and creating meaning.  The Constructionist View can also be defined as, how you say something determines what the message is.  The Constructionist View assumes that "truth" and "ideas" are constructed or invented through the social process of communication.  [[Robert T. Craig (scholar)|Robert T. Craig]] saw the Constructionist View or the constitutive view as it's called in his article, as "…an ongoing process that symbolically forms and re-forms our personal identities." (Craig, 125).  The other view of communication, the Transmission Model, sees communication as robotic and computer-like.  The Transmission Model sees communication as a way of sending or receiving messages and the perfection of that.  But, the Constructionist View sees communications as, "…in human life, info does not behave as simply as bits in an electronic stream.  In human life, information flow is far more like an electric current running from one landmine to another" (Lanham, 7).  The Constructionist View is a more realistic view of communication {{opinion|date=October 2011}} because it involves the interacting of human beings and the free sharing of thoughts and ideas.  Daniel Chandler looks to prove that the Transmission Model is a lesser way of communicating by saying "The transmission model is not merely a gross over-simplification but a dangerously misleading representation of the nature of human communication" (Chandler, 2).  Humans do not communicate simply as computers or robots so that's why it's essential to truly understand the Constructionist View of Communication well.  We do not simply send facts and data to one another, but we take facts and data and they acquire meaning through the process of communication, or through interaction with others.
*Systemic:  This view{{who|date=October 2011}} considers communication to be the new messages created via "through-put", or what happens as the message is being interpreted and re-interpreted as it travels through people.
*Critical: This view considers communication as a source of power and oppression of individuals and social groups.&lt;ref&gt;Littlejohn, S.W. and Foss, K.A. (2008). Theories of human communication, 9th edition. Belmont, CA: Thomson Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspection of a particular theory on this level will provide a framework on the nature of communication as seen within the confines of that theory.

Theories can also be studied and organized according to the ontological, epistemological, and axiological framework imposed by the theorist.

== Ontology ==

[[Ontology]] essentially poses the question of what, exactly, the theorist is examining. One must consider the very nature of reality.  The answer usually falls in one of three realms depending on whether the theorist sees the phenomena through the lens of a realist, nominalist, or social constructionist. Realist perspective views the world objectively, believing that there is a world outside of our own experience and cognitions.  Nominalists see the world subjectively, claiming that everything outside of one's cognitions is simply names and labels.  Social constructionists straddle the fence between objective and subjective reality, claiming that reality is what we create together.{{lopsided|date=October 2011}}{{POV statement|date=October 2011}}

== Epistemology ==
[[Epistemology]] is an examination of the approaches and beliefs which inform particular modes of study of phenomena and domains of expertise. In positivist approaches to epistemology, objective knowledge is seen as the result of the empirical observation and perceptual experience. In the history of science, empirical evidence collected by way of pragmatic-calculation and the scientific method is believed to be the most likely to reflect truth in the findings. Such approaches are meant to predict a phenomenon.  Subjective theory holds that understanding is based on situated knowledge, typically found using interpretative methodology such as ethnography and also interviews. Subjective theories are typically developed to explain or understand phenomena in the social world.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

== Axiology ==

[[Axiology]] is concerned with how values inform research and theory development.{{sfn|Miller|2005}} Most communication theory is guided by one of three axiological approaches.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}  The first approach recognizes that values will influence theorists' interests but suggests that those values must be set aside once actual research begins. Outside replication of research findings is particularly important in this approach to prevent individual researchers' values from contaminating their findings and interpretations.{{sfn|Miller|2005|p=30}} The second approach rejects the idea that values can be eliminated from any stage of theory development. Within this approach, theorists do not try to divorce their values from inquiry. Instead, they remain mindful of their values so that they understand how those values contextualize, influence or skew their findings.{{sfn|Miller|2005|pp=30–31}} The third approach not only rejects the idea that values can be separated from research and theory, but rejects the idea that they should be separated.  This approach is often adopted by [[critical theorists]] who believe that the role of communication theory is to identify oppression and produce social change. In this axiological approach, theorists embrace their values and work to reproduce those values in their research and theory development.{{sfn|Miller|2005|p=31}}

Sustainable [[energy]] management in the [[wastewater]] sector applies the concept of [[sustainable management]] to the energy involved in the treatment of wastewater. The energy used by the wastewater sector is usually the largest portion of energy consumed by the urban water and wastewater utilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=DeHaas|first=David|date=November 2015|title=WASTEWATER TREATMENT ENERGY EFFICIENCY|url=http://www.watercentre.org/awa-journal-november-2015-article/|journal=Australian Water Association Journal|volume=November 2015|pages=53–58|via=International Water Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rising costs of electricity, the contribution to greenhouse gas emissions of the energy sector and the growing need to mitigate global warming, are driving wastewater utilities to rethink their energy management, adopting more energy efficient technologies and processes and investing in on-site renewable energy generation.

== Importance ==
Among the water and wastewater services of a city, wastewater treatment is usually the most energy intense process.&lt;ref&gt;Cook S., Hall M., Gregory A. (2012). Energy use in the provision and consumption of urban water in Australia: an update. CSIRO Water for a Healthy Country Flagship, Australia. Prepared for the Water Services Association of Australia. A. P. f. t. W. S. A. o. A. CSIRO Water for a Healthy Country Flagship, [[CSIRO]].&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Wastewater treatment plants are designed with the purpose of treating the influent sewage to a set quality before discharging it back into a water body, without real concern for the energy consumption of the treating units of a plant. These facilities play the important role to protect not only the water systems but also the human health, preventing the discharge of pathogens normally present in the municipal sewage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wastewater Engineering: Treatment and Resource Recovery|last=Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Tchobanoglous G., Stensel H. D., Tsuchihashi R., Burton F. L.|first=|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the key role of wastewater facilities, energy consumption can not be ignored anymore because of its contribution to greenhouse gas emissions and the need to reduce the emissions to mitigate global warming, as established by the [[Kyoto Protocol]] in 1997 and most recently, by the [[Paris Agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;UNFCCC (2016). Paris Agreement. United Nations.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, there is uncertainty concerning energy costs. Because for a wastewater utility energy costs represent the second highest cost after labour,&lt;ref&gt;Copeland, Claudia. (2017). ''Energy-Water Nexus: The Water Sector's Energy Use'', Congressional Research Service.&lt;/ref&gt; an increase in energy rate would further increase the operational budget of a municipality, and consequently, the service rates for consumers. 
 
Therefore, it is important for the wastewater sector to invest in strategies to limit the demand of energy from the grid in order to mitigate both costs and greenhouse gas emissions.

== Global challenges ==
[[Population growth]], [[Urbanization|urbanisation]], [[climate change]] and increasing demand for [[natural resource]]s are among the future biggest challenges for the urban wastewater sector.

=== Population growth and urbanisation ===
World population and population density in urban settlements are expected to growth by 32% and 66% by 2050, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;UN (2015). World Urbanization Prospects: The 2014 Revision, (ST/ESA/SER.A/366), United Nations.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UN (2015). World Population Prospects: The 2015 Revision, Key Findings and Advance Tables. Working Paper No. ESA/P/WP.241., United Nations.&lt;/ref&gt; An increase in population is expected to increase the volume of wastewater and [[sewage sludge]] requiring treatment. To handle a higher volume of sewage and sewage sludge, it is necessary to upgrade the existing wastewater facilities and the collection networks to collect, store and treat the expected additional volume. Therefore, an increase in volume translates in high future investment costs for a sector that has a low cost recovery rate.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank. (2015). East Asia and Pacific Wastewater to Energy Processes: a Technical Note for Utility Managers in EAP countries, World bank.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, as shown by Mizuta,&lt;ref&gt;Mizuta K., Shimada M. (2010). "Benchmarking energy consumption in municipal wastewater treatment plants in Japan." Water Science and Technology '''62'''(10): 2256-2262.&lt;/ref&gt; there is a direct correlation between the volume of sewage treated and the energy consumption of a wastewater treatment plant. Hence, a rise in energy demand is expected with the upgrading of the existing wastewater facilities and the construction of new ones to cope with future population increase.

=== Climate change ===
Greenhouse gas emissions from human activities have almost doubled between 1970 and 2010.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The increase in greenhouse gases is held responsible for the changes in climate that have caused impacts on natural systems across all continents and oceans.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;IPCC (2014). ''Climate Change 2014 Synthesis Report Summary for Policymakers''. IPCC Assessment Report. '''5'''.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, climate change has affected the [[water cycle]], increasing the precipitation intensity and variability, increasing in this way the risks of floods and droughts in many areas.&lt;ref&gt;Bates, B. C., Z. W. Kundzewicz, S. Wu and J. P. Palutikof, Eds., 2008: ''Climate Change and Water. Technical Paper of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change'', IPCC Secretariat, Geneva, 210 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; The changes that have affected the water cycle have had substantial impacts on the aquatic ecosystems, increasing and worsening the stressors already affecting these systems. Nutrient loading represents one of those stressors as, with the change in precipitation patterns, it is expected a substantial increase in nutrients entering aquatic ecosystems due to increased erosion events and frequent sewage systems overflows. Because wastewater treatment plants discharge the treated wastewater in aquatic [[ecosystem]]s, the target [[Nutrient loading|nutrient load]] of these ecosystems affects the level of treatment that a wastewater treatment plant has to perform on the wastewater before being allowed to discharge it.&lt;ref&gt;Van DijK, A. (2015). "Water resources, climate change and energy". ''Climate, Energy and Water''. C. U. Press''':''' 6-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Higher native levels of nutrients in the receiving water bodies force wastewater treatment plants to perform more stringent nutrients removal from the wastewater before dispose of it. In addition to stricter discharge limits, future standards for currently unregulated contaminants are most likely to be introduced.&lt;ref&gt;Stillwell A. S., Hoppock D. C., Webber M. E. (2010). "Energy recovery from wastewater treatment plants in the United States: A case study of the energy-water nexus." ''Sustainability'' '''2'''(4): 945-962.&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of more stringent limits and new treatment requirements might further increase the already significant energy demand of these facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Venkatesh G., Brattebø H. (2011). "Analysis of chemicals and energy consumption in water and wastewater treatment, as cost components: Case study of Oslo, Norway." ''Urban Water Journal'' '''8'''(3): 189-202.&lt;/ref&gt;

Population growth and climate change are increasing the energy needs of wastewater facilities. Because [[fossil fuel]]s are still the most diffused source of energy, providing more than half of the global energy needs,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&amp;t=3.|title=What is U.S. electricity generation by energy source?|last=|first=|date=2016|website=The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the wastewater sector is still highly dependent on fossil fuel-based energy sources. Electricity, for example, is sourced from the electricity [[Grid energy storage|grid]] while gas and [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] are generally used on-site for heating and to run backup [[Engine-generator|generators]]. High consumption of [[Fossil fuel|fossil-fuel]] energy makes the wastewater sector an indirect contributor to greenhouse gas emissions since fossil fuels are one of the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases, contributing for 65% of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions globally.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Resource recovery ===
The pressure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate climate change and the increasing demand for natural resources is compelling the wastewater sector to develop innovative and more efficient practices to operate. Wastewater contains energy, nutrients and other organic and inorganic resources that can be successfully recovered and used in a broad range of applications. Energy can be recovered as [[biogas]]&lt;ref&gt;Askari, Mohammad Bagher, Fatemeh, Golestanian, Saman, Motraz, Motamedi Mirhosseiny, Leili (2015). "Advantages and Disadvantages of Biogas Energy."

"Renewable energy from wastewater – Practical aspects of integrating a wastewater treatment plant into local energy supply concepts." ''Journal of Cleaner Production''&lt;/ref&gt; Biogas is an energy source with a wide range of uses, whereas heat has proven valuable for heating and cooling applications of buildings. Among the nutrients, [[Phosphate mining in the United States|phosphate]] can be recovered as [[struvite]] for fertilisers, a very important application since phosphate resources are limited and depletable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.environmental-research.ox.ac.uk/lets-talk-phosphorus-depletion/.|title=Let's talk about phosphorus depletion|last=|first=|date=October 2017|website=www.environmental-research.ox.ac.uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Composted sewage sludge finds applications in agricultural setting and urban gardens as soil amendment.&lt;ref&gt;Cheng, Hefa, Xu, Weipu, Liu, Junliang, Zhao, Qingjian, He, Yanqing, Chen, Gang (2007). "Application of composted sewage sludge (CSS) as a soil amendment for turfgrass growth." ''Ecological Engineering'' '''29'''(1): 96-104.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides energy and nutrients, the effluent from the wastewater treatment plants can be reused as quality irrigation water both in agricultural and landscape applications.

== Energy ==
Effective strategies adopted by wastewater utilities to reduce energy consumption and dependence from fossil fuel-based energy sources include increasing energy efficiency and generating renewable energy on site.

=== Energy efficiency ===
Since the recognition of anthropogenic causes of climate change in the late 1980s and the identification of the energy sector as one of the main contributors, there has been a global effort to investigate the energy consumption of human activities and their indirect contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe the energy analysis of the wastewater sector was conducted adopting mainly two strategies. Germany (MURL, 1999) and Switzerland (BUWAL, 1994), for example, developed energy management manuals for wastewater treatment plants and reduced their energy consumption by 38% and 50%, respectively.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Wett B., Buchauer K., Fimml C. (2017). ''Energy-Water Nexus: The Water Sector's Energy Use'', Congressional Research Service.&lt;/ref&gt; These manuals provided wastewater utilities with energy targets to achieve. On the other hand, in 1999 Austria promoted benchmarking that allowed annual comparison of wastewater treatment plants energy performances. This comparison stimulated a competition among the wastewater treatment plants and the aspiration to improve their efficiency, which led Austria to be one of the first countries in the world to achieve energy neutrality in the wastewater sector. The energy benchmarking process has allowed wastewater treatment plants to identify their most energy-consuming assets and possible inefficiencies, and target them to reduce their energy demand. For example, the inefficiency of the aeration process identified by multiple studies&lt;ref&gt;Belloir C., Stanford C., Soares A. (2015). "Energy benchmarking in wastewater treatment plants: the importance of site operation and layout." ''Environmental Technology'' '''36'''(2): 260-269.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nowak, O., Keil, S., Fimml, C. (2011). "Examples of energy self-sufficient municipal nutrient removal plants." ''Water Science and Technology'' '''64'''(1): 1-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; has allowed the development of more energy efficient oxidation units, with a possible energy saving of about 20% to 50% in some cases according to Frijns&lt;ref&gt;Frijns J., Middleton R., Uijterlinde C., Wheale G. (2012). "Energy efficiency in the European water industry: learning from best practices." ''Journal of Water and Climate Change'' '''3'''(1): 11-17.&lt;/ref&gt; and an [[EPA Sustainability|EPA]]&lt;ref&gt;EPA (2013). ''Energy Efficiency in Water and Wastewater Facilities''. U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 
&lt;/ref&gt; study.

=== Renewable energy generation ===
Increased energy efficiency has allowed wastewater treatment plants to comply with discharge limits reducing the energy demand even up to 50%&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; without affecting treatment performances. However, energy efficiency strategies by themselves are not sufficient to achieve independence from the electricity grid and fossil fuel-based energy sources. To achieve energy neutrality, multiple studies have looked at the feasibility of integrating a variety of renewable energy sources into wastewater treatment plants. The wastewater itself is a carrier of energy and a theoretical calculation, based on the characteristic of the sewage, shows that the composition of the embedded energy is 80% thermal energy and 20% chemical energy.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Tarallo (2014). ''UTILITIES OF THE FUTURE ENERGY FINDINGS'', WERF.&lt;/ref&gt; The thermal energy can be recovered as heat while the chemical energy is recovered as biogas. 
 
Renewable energy generation on site, in addition to increased energy efficiency, has already allowed at least twelve plants worldwide not only to achieve energy neutrality but also to produce more energy than they need.&lt;ref&gt;Gu Y., Li Y., Li X., Luo P., Wang H., Robinson Z. P., Wang X., Wu J., Li F.(2017). "The feasibility and challenges of energy self-sufficient wastewater treatment plants." ''Applied Energy''&lt;/ref&gt; Energy efficiency programs and renewable energy generation have proven successful in diminishing the dependence of the wastewater sector from the energy grid, reducing treatment costs and the environmental impact associated with the grid connection.

== Advantages of on-site renewable energy generation ==
The production and recovery of energy of site offers numerous advantages contributing to operation and management cost reduction of the treatment processes, source of revenue, contribution to waste management and the cost associated with it and increased resilience in case of power shortage.
 
One of the main advantages of energy generation on site is the less stringent dependence from the electricity grid and the cost mitigation associated with it. Depending on the level of renewable energy generation, wastewater treatment plants can disconnect from the main grid when the electricity is the most expensive, usually during peak hours and simply avoid the more elevated price of these periods. When [[Feed-in tariff|feed in tariffs]] are in place, wastewater treatment plants can sell electricity to the grid and reduce costs through the cost recovery of the sold energy. In some cases, energy utilities offer [https://energy.gov/oe/activities/technology-development/grid-modernization-and-smart-grid/demand-response demand response programs], in which a wastewater utility is given a financial incentive if it disconnects when requested by the energy utility. This helps the energy utilities to mitigate energy peak demands reducing the risks of blackout, and it is source of revenue for the wastewater utilities.

In countries where a r[[Mandatory renewable energy target|enewable energy target]] has been introduced, the production of renewable energy allows the wastewater sector to get a certificate for every unit of power they produce. The certificates are then bought by the electricity retailers, that surrender them every year to comply with the renewable energy regulation.

Another advantage of renewable energy production, in specific of [[biogas]] from [[sewage sludge]], is the contribution to waste management. In fact the recovery of the chemical energy involves the reduction of the sewage sludge volume. A smaller volume of sewage sludge is cheaper to transport and dispose of, decreasing operational costs.

Moreover, a diversify portfolio of energy source can contribute to a more resilient response in case of energy shortage and grid problems.

== Barriers to on-site renewable energy generation ==
Despite the numerous advantages offered by on-site renewable energy generation, wastewater utilities are experiencing several difficulties in integrating renewables in their facilities.
 
From a survey conducted by Beca&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=BECA|first=|date=November 2015|title=OPPORTUNITIES FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY IN THE AUSTRALIAN WATER SECTOR|url=https://arena.gov.au/assets/2016/01/Opportunities-for-renewable-energy-in-the-Australian-water-sector.pdf|journal=Arena|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; it emerged that one of the biggest barrier is that energy generation is not core business for wastewater utilities and renewable energy projects come with technical challenges and high initial investment costs. 
Moreover, each plant presents differences and it requires a customised solution for each situation, making it hard to generalise solution for the all sector. There is a lack of guidelines and roadmaps to follow, so each utility has to create specific solutions for their wastewater treatment plants.

The changing price of electricity connected with the fossil fuel price can affect the return time on the investment while the fast changing regulatory panorama increases the uncertainty of the investment and the financial value of it. This can create an unsustainable situation, where  investments in renewables projects can happens only when there are subsidies given by the government.

In the specific situation of biogas production, poor management can increase the fugitive emission of greenhouse gas emissions, reducing the environmental benefits of renewable energy generation.

In [[sociology]], '''nomos''' refers to provisional codes (habits or customs) of social and political behavior, socially constructed and historically (even geographically) specific. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jarratt|first=Susan Carole Funderburgh|title=Rereading the Sophists: Classical Rhetoric Refigured|year=1991|publisher=Southern Illinois UP|location=Carbondale}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term derives from the Greek νόμος, and it refers not only to explicit laws but to all of the normal rules and forms people take for granted in their day-to-day activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayek|first=Friedrich|authorlink=Friedrich Hayek|title=Law, Legislation and Liberty|year=1982|publisher=Routledge |isbn=9780415522298|pages=90–117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nomos stands for order, valid and binding on those who fall under its jurisdiction; thus it is a social construct with ethical dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ostwald|first=Martin|title=Nomos and the Beginnings of the Athenian Democracy|year=1969|publisher=Oxford UP|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a belief, opinion or point of view; it is a human invention.

== History of the term ==

[[Carl Schmitt]] began using the term in his 1934 publication "On the Three Types of Juristic Thought"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schmitt|first=Carl|others=trans Joseph Bendersky|title=On the Three Types of Juristic Thought |year=2004|publisher=Praeger|pages=49–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; to denote the "concrete order" of a people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mehring|first=Reinhard|title=Carl Schmitt: A Biography|year=2014|publisher=Polity|isbn=9780745652245|page=316}}&lt;/ref&gt; before extending its use into his 1950 book "The Nomos of the Earth in the International Law of the Jus Publicum Europaeum".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/schmitt/#LibCosFouIntOrd|title=Carl Schmitt|last=Vinx|first=Lars|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bergerian nomos ===

After Schmitt, the next influential writer to use the term in a modern context is [[Peter L. Berger]]. Berger writes of human beings fashioning a world by their own activity (1967:5). Berger sees this taking place through a continual threefold cycle between individuals and society: externalisation, objectivation and internalization. The world thus fashioned has an order&amp;mdash;a set of principles&amp;mdash;which comes to be read onto society by individuals through externalisation and objectivation, and also internalised in each individual. This order thus comes to be assumed, spoken of, and placed into social discourse to be treated as common sense. This ordering of the world and experience, which is a corporate and social process as well as an individual one, is a nomos.

Berger writes of 'The socially established nomos' being understood 'as a shield against terror. Put differently, the most important function of society is nomization.' (1967:22). We all need that structuring nomos; it provides us with stability, predictability, a frame of reference in which to live. The alternative is the chaos and terror of what Berger calls anomy.

To be most effective, the nomos must be taken for granted. The structure of the world created by human and social activity is treated not as contingent, but as self-evident. 'Whenever the socially established nomos attains the quality of being taken for granted, there occurs a merging of its meanings with what are considered to be the fundamental meanings inherent in the universe.' (1967:24-25). Berger sees this happening in all societies, and while the nomos is expressed in religious terms in 'archaic societies', 'In contemporary society, this archaic cosmization of the social world is likely to take the form of "scientific" propositions about the nature of men rather than the nature of the universe.' (1967:25).

So this process of world-construction is not necessarily religious, but its expression has most often been religious. Later Berger explores the part religious belief has played in nomoi: providing a connection with the cosmic—seeking to provide a completeness to that religious world-view.

'Every human society is an edifice of externalized and objectivated meanings, always intending a meaningful totality. Every society is engaged in the never completed enterprise of building a humanly meaningful world. Cosmization implies the identification of this humanly meaningful world with the world as such, the former now being grounded in the latter, reflecting it or being derived from it in its fundamental structures. Such a cosmos, as the ultimate ground and validation of human nomoi, need not necessarily be sacred. Particularly in modern times there have been thoroughly secular attempts at cosmization, among which modern science is by far the most important. It is safe to say, however, that originally all cosmization had a sacred character.' (1967:27).
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berger|first1=Peter|title=The Sacred Canopy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coverian nomos===

The next landmark in the use of the term is generally thought to be by [[Robert Cover]], who argued in his influential 1982 paper [http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3690&amp;context=fss_papers Nomos and Narrative] that while the mechanisms of law and social control are part of law, that students of the law, and legal actors, should instead focus on the [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] universe, the whole of the means of social control. As with Berger, Cover rooted the nomos in "narrative", or what a post-structuralist would call [[meta-narrative]]. Cover argued that no set of legal institutions exists apart from the narratives that locate it and give it meaning.

He says this because he argues that our moral sense is composed of the narratives from which we draw conclusions, and by which we locate ourselves in relation to other people. He argues that because narrative is morality, the normative universe must rest on narrative. Since we also construct our view of the universe physically from narrative, he argues that the normative universe is as much a part of our existence as the physical universe.

Cover then makes an argument of incorporation: he states that just as we develop increasingly complex responses to the physical world, so too is our development of responses to "[[Other (philosophy)|otherness]]" conditioned over time by interaction. From this he argues that societies that have great legal systems rest on more than formal and technical virtuosity, but in the richness of their understanding of the normative universe.

Cover argues that the explicit relationship between formal apparatus of a society, in this case a legal society, and the normative range of behavior is the fulcrum to understanding whether the society is functional or not.

Cover's use of the term is rooted in Berger's argument that nomos requires mythology and narrative, as pillars for the understanding of the meaning of each act within a particular nomos.

'''Orthology''' is the study of the right use of words in [[language]]. The word comes from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''ortho''- ("correct") and -''logy'' ("science of"). This [[science]] is a place where [[psychology]], [[philosophy]], [[linguistics]], and many other fields of [[learning]] come together. The most noted use of ''Orthology'' is for the selection of words 
for the language of [[Basic English]] by the [[Orthological Institute]].

The book, ''The Meaning of Meaning'', by [[Charles Kay Ogden|C.K. Ogden]] and [[I.A. Richards]], is an important book dealing with orthology. The term ''Orthology'' comes from the book ''The Grammar of Science'' by [[Karl Pearson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Karl |first= Pearson |title= The Grammar of Science |origyear= 1893 |publisher= Walter Scott |location= London |pages=454 |quote= A fundamental part of logic is the study of the right use of language, clear definition, and, if needful, invention of terms -- ''Orthology''.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Principles of intelligent urbanism''' ('''PIU''') is a theory of [[urban planning]] composed of a set of ten axioms intended to guide the formulation of city plans and urban designs. They are intended to reconcile and integrate diverse urban planning and management concerns. These axioms include [[Environmentalism|environmental]] [[sustainability]], [[heritage conservation]], [[appropriate technology]], infrastructure-efficiency, [[placemaking]], [[social access]], [[transit-oriented development]],  [[regional integration]], [[human scale]], and institutional integrity. The term was coined by Prof. [[Christopher Charles Benninger]].

The '''PIU''' evolved from the city planning guidelines formulated by the [[Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne|''International Congress of Modern Architecture'' (CIAM)]], the urban design approaches developed at Harvard's pioneering Urban Design Department under the leadership of [[Josep Lluis Sert]], and the concerns enunciated by [[Team Ten]].  It is most prominently seen in plans prepared by [[Christopher Charles Benninger]] and his numerous colleagues in the Asian context (Benninger 2001). They form the elements of the planning curriculum at the School of Planning, [[Ahmedabad]], which Benninger founded in 1971.  They were the basis for the new capital plan for [[Thimphu]], [[Bhutan]].&lt;ref name=Thimphu&gt;[http://www.dudh.gov.bt/Thimphustructural/Index.html Thimphu Structural Plan 2002-2027] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100623013525/http://www.dudh.gov.bt/Thimphustructural/Index.html |date=2010-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Axioms==
===Principle one: a balance with nature===
According to proponents of intelligent urbanism, balance with nature emphasizes the distinction between utilizing resources and exploiting them.  It focuses on the thresholds beyond which [[deforestation]], [[soil erosion]], [[aquifer]] depletion, [[silting|siltation]] and flooding reinforce one another in urban development, saving or destroying life support systems.  The principle promotes environmental assessments to identify fragile zones, threatened [[ecosystems]] and habitats that can be enhanced through conservation, density control, [[land use planning]] and [[Urban open space|open space]] design (McCarg: 1975). This principle promotes life cycle building energy consumption and pollutant emission analysis.&lt;ref&gt;McHarg I. (1975): Design with Nature, Wiley, John and Sons, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

This principle states there is a level of human habitation intensity wherein the resources that are consumed will be replaced through the replenishing natural cycles of the seasons, creating environmental equilibrium.  Embedded in the principle is  contention that so long as nature can resurge each year; so long as the biomass can survive within its own [[eco-system]]; so long as the breeding grounds of fauna and avifauna are safe; so long as there is no erosion and the biomass is maintained, nature is only being utilized.

Underlying this principle is the supposition that there is a fragile line that is crossed when the [[fauna]], which cross-fertilizes the [[flora]], which sustains the soil, which supports the hillsides, is no longer there. Erosion, siltation of drainage networks and flooding result. After a point of no return, utilization of [[natural resources]] will outpace the natural ability of the [[Ecosystem|eco-system]] to replenish itself.  From there on degradation accelerates and amplifies.  [[Deforestation]], [[desertification]], [[erosion]], floods, fires and landslides all increase.

The principle states that blatant "acts against nature" include cutting of hillside trees, [[quarry]]ing on slopes, dumping [[sewage]] and [[industrial waste]] into the natural [[drainage basin|drainage system]], paving and plinthing excessively, and construction on steep slopes.   This [[urban theory]] proposes that the urban ecological balance can be maintained when fragile areas are reserved, conservation of eco-systems is pursued, and low intensity habitation precincts are thoughtfully identified.  Thus, the principles operate within the balance of nature, with a goal of protecting and conserving those elements of the ecology that nurture the environment.  Therefore, the first principle of intelligent urbanism is that urbanization be in balance with nature.

===Principle two: a balance with tradition===
Balance with tradition is intended to integrate plan interventions with existing cultural assets, respecting traditional practices and precedents of style (Spreiregen: 1965). This urban planning principle demands respect for the [[cultural heritage]] of a place.  It seeks out traditional wisdom in the layout of human settlements, in the order of building plans, in the precedents of style, in the symbols and signs that transfer meanings through decoration and motifs.  This principle respects the order engendered into building systems through years of adaptation to climate, to social circumstances, to available materials and to technology.  It promotes [[architectural styles]] and motifs designed to communicate cultural values.

This principle calls for orienting attention toward historic monuments and heritage structures, leaving space at the ends of visual axis to “frame" existing views and vistas. Natural views and vistas demand respect, assuring that buildings do not block major sight lines toward visual assets.

Embedded in the principle is the concern for unique cultural and societal iconography of regions, their signs and symbols. Their incorporation into the spatial order of urban settings is promoted.  Adherents promote the orientation and structuring of urban plans using local knowledge and meaning systems, expressed through art, urban space and architecture.

Planning decisions must operate within the balance of tradition, aggressively protecting, promoting and conserving generic components and elements of the urban pattern.

===Principle three: appropriate technology===
[[Appropriate technology]] emphasizes the employment of [[building materials]], construction techniques, infrastructural systems and [[project management]] which are consistent with local contexts (situation, setting or circumstances)[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/contexts]. People's capacities, geo-climatic conditions, locally available resources, and suitable [[investment|capital investments]] all temper technology. Where there are abundant craftspeople, labour-intensive methods are appropriate. Where there is surplus savings, capital intensive methods are appropriate. For every problem there is a range of potential technologies, which can be applied, and an appropriate fit between technology and other resources must be established. Proponents argue that accountability and transparency are enhanced by overlaying the physical spread of urban utilities and services upon electoral constituencies, such that people’s representatives are interlinked with the urban technical systems needed for a [[civil society]]. This principle is in sync with "small is beautiful" concepts and with the use of local resources.

===Principle four: conviviality===
The fourth principle  sponsors [[social interaction]] through public domains, in a hierarchy of places, devised for personal solace, companionship, romance, domesticity, "neighborliness," community and civic life (Jacobs:1993). According to proponents of intelligent urbanism, vibrant societies are interactive, socially engaging and offer their members numerous opportunities for gathering and meeting one another.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs Jane (1993): [[The Death and Life of Great American Cities]], [[Random House]], New York.&lt;/ref&gt;  The PIU maintain that this can be achieved through design and that society operates within hierarchies of [[social relation]]s which are space specific.  The hierarchies can be conceptualized as a system of social tiers, with each tier having a corresponding physical place in the settlement structure.

====A place for the individual====
A goal of intelligent urbanism is to create places of solitude. These may be in urban forests, along urban hills, beside quiet streams, in public gardens and in parks where one can escape to meditate and contemplate.  According to proponents, these are the quiet places wherein the individual consciousness dialogues with the rational mind.  Idle and random thought sorts out complexities of modern life and allows the obvious to emerge.  It is in these natural settings that the wandering mind finds its measure and its balance. Using ceremonial gates, directional walls and other “silent devices" these spaces are denoted and divined.  Places of the individual cultivate introspection.  These spaces may also be the forecourts and interior courtyards of public buildings, or even the thoughtful reading rooms of libraries. Meditation focuses one's thought.  Intelligent urbanism creates a domain for the individual to mature through self-analysis and [[self-realization]].

====A place for friendship====
The axiom insists that in city plans there must be spaces for “beautiful, intimate [[friendship]]" where unfettered dialogue can happen.  This principle insists that such places will not exist naturally in a modern urban fabric.  They must be a part of the conscientious design of the urban core, of the urban hubs, of urban villages and of neighborhoods, where people can meet with friends and talk out life’s issues, sorrows, joys and dilemmas.  This second tier is important for the emotional life of the populace.  It sponsors strong [[mental health]] within the people, creating places where friendship can unfold and grow.

====A place for householders====
There must be spaces for householders, which may be in the form of dwellings for families, or homes for intimate companions, and where young workmates can form a common kitchen.  Whatever their compositions, there must be a unique domain for [[Group (sociology)|social groups]], familiar or biological, which have organized themselves into households.  These domestic precincts are where families live and carry out their day-to-day functions of life.  This third tier of conviviality is where the individual socializes into a personality.

Housing clusters planned according to this axiom create a variety of household possibilities, which respond to a range of household structures and situations.  It recognizes that households transform through the years, requiring a variety of dwellings types that respond to a complex matrix of needs and abilities, which are provided for in city plans.

====A place for the neighborhood====
Smaller household domains must cluster into a higher social domain, the neighborhood social group.
Good city planning practice sponsors, through design, such units of social space.  It is in this fourth tier of social life that public conduct takes on new dimensions and groups learn to live peacefully among one another.  It is through neighborhoods that the “social contract" amongst diverse households and individuals is sponsored.  This [[social contract]] is the rational basis for social relations and negotiations within larger social groups. Within neighborhoods basic amenities like creches, early learning centers, preventive health care and rudimentary infrastructure are maintained by the community.

====A place for communities====
The next social tier, or hierarchy, is the community.  Historically, communities were tribes who shared [[Mores|social mores]] and cultural behavioral patterns.  In contemporary urban settings communities are formed of diverse people.  But these are people who share the common need to negotiate and manage their spatial settings. In plans created through the principles of intelligent urbanism these are called urban villages.  Like a rural village, social bonds are found in the [[community management]] of security, common resources and social space. Urban villages will have defined social spaces, services and amenities that need to be managed by the community.  According to proponents of intelligent urbanism these urban villages optimally become the administrative wards, and therefore the constituencies, of the elected members of municipal bodies.  Though there are no physical barriers to these communities, they have their unique spatial social domain.  Intelligent urbanism calls for the creation of dense, walkable zones in which the inhabitants recognize each other’s faces, share common facilities and resources, and often see each other at the village centre. This fifth tier of social space is where one needs initiative to join into various activities.  It is intended to promote initiative and constructive community participation.  There are opportunities for one to be involved in the management of services, and amenities and to meet new people. They accommodate primary education and recreation areas. Good planning practice promotes the creation of community places, where community-based organizations can manage common resources and resolve common problems.

====A place for the city domain====
The principles of intelligent urbanism call for city level domains.  These can be plazas, parks, stadia, transport hubs, promenades, "passages" or gallerias.  These are social spaces where everyone can go.  In many cities one has to pay an entrance fee to access “public spaces" like malls and museums.  Unlike the lower tiers of the [[social hierarchy]], this tier is not defined by any biological, familiar, [[Face-to-face (philosophy)|face-to-face]] or exclusive characteristic.  One may find people from all continents, from nearby districts and provinces and from all parts of the city in such places. By nature these are accessible and open spaces, with no physical, social or economic barriers. According to this principle it is the rules of human conduct that order this domain’s behavior.  It is civility, or civilization, which protects and energizes such spaces.  At the lower tiers, one meets people through introductions, through family ties, and through neighborhood circumstances.

These domains would include all freely accessible large spaces. These are places where outdoor exhibits are held, sports matches take place, vegetables are sold and goods are on display. These are places where visitors to the city meander amongst the locals. Such places may stay the same, but the people are always changing.  Most significant, these city scale public domains foster public interaction; they sponsor unspoken ground rules for unknown people to meet and to interact.  They nurture civic understanding of the strength of diversity, variety, a range of cultural groups and ethnic mixes. It is this higher tier of social space which defines truly urbane environments.

Every [[Social structure|social system]] has its own hierarchy of social relations and interactions. Intelligent urbanism sees cyberspace as a macro tier of conviviality, but does not discount physical places in forging relationships due to the Internet. These are reflected through a system of ‘places’ that respond to them.  Good urban planning practice promotes the planning and design of such ‘places’ as elemental components of the [[urban structure]].

===Principle five: efficiency===
The principle of efficiency promotes a balance between the consumption of resources such as energy, time and fiscal resources, with planned achievements in comfort, safety, security, access, tenure, productivity and hygiene.  It encourages optimum sharing of public land, roads, facilities, services and infrastructural networks, reducing per household costs, while increasing affordability, productivity, access and civic viability.

Intelligent urbanism promotes a balance between performance and consumption.  Intelligent urbanism promotes efficiency in carrying out functions in a [[Cost-effectiveness|cost effective]] manner. It assesses the performance of various systems required by the public and the consumption of energy, funds, administrative time and the maintenance efforts required to perform these functions.

A major concern of this principle is transport.  While recognizing the convenience of personal vehicles, it attempts to place costs (such as [[Fuel efficiency in transportation|energy consumption]], large paved areas, parking, accidents, negative [[balance of trade]], pollution and related morbidity) on the users of private vehicles.

Good city planning practice promotes alternative modes of transport, as opposed to a dependence on personal vehicles.  It promotes affordable [[public transport]].  It promotes medium to high-density [[residential development]] along with complementary social amenities, convenience shopping, recreation and [[public services]] in compact, walkable mixed-use settlements.  These compact communities have shorter pipe lengths, wire lengths, cable lengths and road lengths per capita.  More people share gardens, shops and transit stops.&lt;ref&gt;Urban Land Institute (1998): Smart Growth, [[Urban Land Institute]], Washington D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

These compact urban nodes are spaced along regional urban transport corridors that integrate the region’s urban nodes, through public transport, into a rational system of growth.  Good planning practice promotes clean, comfortable, safe and speedy, public transport, which operates at dependable intervals along major origin and destination paths.  Such a system is cheaper, safer, less polluting and consumes less energy.

The same principle applies to [[public infrastructure]], social facilities and public services.  Compact, high-density communities result in more efficient urban systems, delivering services at less cost per unit to each citizen.

There is an appropriate balance to be found somewhere on the line between wasteful low-density individual systems and over-capitalized mega systems.  Individual [[septic tank]]s and water bores servicing individual households in low-density fragmented layouts, allow the use of filtered [[greywater]] for free [[irrigation]] of gardens, but, if not maintained, can cause a local pollution of subterranean [[aquifer]] systems. The bores can dramatically lower [[Groundwater|ground water]] levels especially during droughts. The vantage of septic tanks an bores is to be managed by the very users, at no cost for the community.
Alternatively, large-scale, citywide sewerage systems and regional [[water supply]] systems are capital intensive and prone to management and maintenance dysfunction, if not corruption or extortion by private companies.  Operating costs, [[user fees]] and cost recovery expenses are high.   There is a balance wherein medium-scale systems, covering compact communities, utilize modern technology, without the pitfalls of large-scale infrastructure systems.  This principle of urbanism promotes the middle path with regard to public infrastructure, facilities, services and amenities.

When these appropriate facilities and service systems overlap electoral constituencies, the “imagery" between user performance in the form of payments for services, systems dependability through managed delivery, and official response through effective representation, should all become obvious and transparent.

Good city planning practices promote compact settlements along dense urban corridors, and within populated networks, such that the numbers of users who share costs are adequate to support effective and efficient infrastructure systems. Intelligent urbanism is intended to foster movement on foot, linking pedestrian movement with public transport systems at strategic nodes and hubs.  Medium-scale infrastructural systems, whose catchment areas overlap political constituencies and administrative jurisdictions, result in transparent governance and accountable urban management.

===Principle six: human scale===
Intelligent urbanism encourages ground level, pedestrian oriented urban patterns, based on anthropometric dimensions.  Walkable, mixed use urban villages are encouraged over single-function blocks, linked by motor ways, and surrounded by [[parking lot]]s.

An abiding axiom of urban planning, [[urban design]] and city planning has been the promotion of people friendly places, pedestrian walkways and public domains where people can meet freely.  These can be parks, gardens, glass-covered gallerias, arcades, courtyards, street side cafes, river- and hill-side stroll ways, and a variety of semi-covered spaces.

Intelligent urbanism promotes the scale of the pedestrian moving on the pathway, as opposed to the scale of the automobile on the expressway.  Intelligent urbanism promotes the ground plan of imaginable precincts, as opposed to the imagery of façades and the monumentality of the section.  It promotes the personal visibility of places moving on foot at eye level.

Intelligent urbanism advocates removing artificial barrier and promotes face-to-face contact.  Proponents argue that the automobile, [[Single-use zoning|single use zoning]] and the construction of public structures in isolated compounds, all deteriorate [[Human condition|the human condition]] and the human scale of the city.

According to PIU proponents, the trend towards [[urban sprawl]] can be overcome by developing pedestrian circulation networks along streets and open spaces that link local destinations.  Shops, amenities, [[day care]], vegetable markets and basic social services should be clustered around public transport stops, and at a walkable distance from work places, public institutions, high and medium density residential areas.  Public spaces should be integrated into residential, work, entertainment and commercial areas.  Social activities and public buildings should orient onto public open spaces.  These should be the interchange sites for people on the move, where they can also revert into the realm of “slowness," of community life and of human interaction.

Human scale can be achieved through building masses that “step down" to human scale open spaces; by using arcades and pavilions as buffers to large masses; by intermixing open spaces and built masses sensitively; by using [[anthropometric]] proportions and [[natural material]]s.  Traditional building precedents often carry within them a human scale language, from which a contemporary fabric of build may evolve.

The focus of intelligent urbanism is the ground plane, pedestrian movement and interaction along movement channels, stems, at crossing nodes, at interactive hubs and within vibrant urban cores.  The PIU holds many values in common with [[Transit-oriented development|Transit Oriented Development]], but the PIU goal is not merely to replace the automobile, nor to balance it.  These are mundane requirements of planning, which the PIU assumes are found in every design and urban configuration. The PIU goal is to enrich the human condition and to enhance the realm of human possibilities.

Intelligent urbanism conceives of urbanity as a process of facilitating [[human behavior]] toward more tolerant, more peaceful, more accommodating and more sensitive modalities of interaction and [[conflict resolution]].  Intelligent urbanism recognizes that ‘urbanity’ emerges where people mix and interact on a face-to-face basis, on the ground, at high densities and amongst diverse social and economic groups. Intelligent urbanism nurtures ‘urbanity’ through designs and plans that foster human scale interaction.

===Principle seven: opportunity matrix===
The PIU envisions the city as a vehicle for personal, social, and [economic development], through access to a range of organizations, services, facilities and information providing a variety of opportunities for enhanced employment, economic engagement, education, and recreation. This principle aims to increase access to shelter, health care and human resources development. It aims to increase safety and hygienic conditions. The city is a place of economic opportunity. This is generally said with regard to urban annual net product, enriched urban economic base, sustained employment generation and urban balance of trade.  More significantly this is true for the individuals who settle in cities.  Moreover, cities are places where individuals can increase their knowledge, skills and sensitivities.  Cities provide access to [[health care]] and [[preventive medicine]].  They provide a great umbrella of services under which the individual can leave aside the struggle for survival, and get on with the finer things of life.&lt;ref&gt;Sen A. (2000): Development as Freedom: Knopf, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

The PIU sees cities as catalysts for personal definition and self-discovery. In cities people get inspired, build a drive to achieve, discover aspects of their personalities, skills and intellectual curiosity which they use to craft their identity.

The city provides a range of services and facilities, whose realization in villages are the all-consuming struggle of rural inhabitants.  Potable water; sewerage management; energy for cooking, heat and lighting are all piped and wired in; [[Waste management|solid waste disposal]] and [[Stormwater|storm water]] drainage are taken for granted.  The city offers access through roads, public transit, telephones and the Internet.  The peace and security provided by effective policing systems, and the courts of law, are just assumed to be there in the city.  Then there are the schools, the recreation facilities, the health services and a myriad of professional services offered in the city market place.

Intelligent urbanism views the city as an opportunity system.  Yet these opportunities are not equally distributed.  Security, health care, education, shelter, hygiene, and most of all employment, are not equally accessible.  Proponents of intelligent urbanism see the city as playing an equalizing role allowing citizens to grow according to their own essential capabilities and efforts.  If the city is an institution, which generates opportunities, intelligent urbanism promotes the concept of equal access to opportunities within the urban system.

Intelligent urbanism promotes a guaranteed access to education, health care, police protection, and justice before the law, potable water, and a range of basic services.  Perhaps this principle, more than any other, distinguishes intelligent urbanism from other elitist, efficiency oriented urban charters and regimes.

Intelligent urbanism does not say every household will stay in an equivalent house, or travel in the same vehicle, or consume the same amount of electricity.

Intelligent urbanism recognizes the existence of poverty, of ignorance, of ill health, of malnutrition, of low skills, of gender bias and ignorance of the urban system itself.  Intelligent urbanism is courageous in confronting these forms of inequality, and backlogs in social and economic development.  Intelligent urbanism sees an urban plan, not only as a physical plan, but also as a social plan and as an economic plan.

The ramifications of this understanding are that the people living in [[smart city|intelligent cities]] should not experience urban development in “standard doses".   In short, people may be born equal or unequal, but they grow inequitably.  An important role of the city is to provide a variety of paths and channels for each individual to set right their own future, against the inequity of their past, or the special challenges they face.  According to proponents of this principle this is the most salient aspect of a [[free society]]; than even [[Suffrage|voting rights]] access to opportunity is the essence of self-liberation and human development (Sen:2000).

According to proponents of intelligent urbanism, there will be a variety of problems faced by urbanites and they need a variety of opportunity channels for resolution.  If there are ten problem areas where people are facing stresses, like economic engagement, health, shelter, food, education, recreation, transport, etc., there must be a variety of opportunities through which individuals and households can resolve each of these stresses.  There must be ten channels to resolve each of ten stresses! If this opportunity matrix is understood and responded to, the city is truly functioning as an opportunity matrix. For example, opportunities for shelter could be through the channels of lodges, rented rooms, studio apartments, bedroom apartments and houses.  It could be through the channels of ownership, through a variety of tendencies.  It could be through opportunities for [[self-help]], or incremental housing.  It could be through the up-gradation of slums.  Intelligent urbanism promotes a wide range of solutions, where any stress is felt.  It therefore promotes a range of problem statements, options, and variable solutions to urban stresses.

Intelligent urbanism sees cities as processes.  Proponents argue that good urban plans facilitate those processes and do not place barriers before them.  For example, it does not judge a “slum" as a blight on society; it sees the possibility that such a settlement may be an opportunity channel for entry into the city.  Such a settlement may be the only affordable shelter, within easy access to employment and education, for a new immigrant household in the city.  According to intelligent urbanism, if the plan ignores, or destroys such settlements, it is creating a city of barriers and despair wherein a poor family, offering a good service to the city, is denied a modicum of basic needs for survival.  Alternatively, if the urban plan recognizes that the “slum" is a mechanism for [[Personal development|self development]], a spring-board from which children have access to education, a place which can be up-graded with potable water, basic sanitary facilities, [[street light]]s and paving…then it is a plan for opportunity.  Intelligent urbanism believes that there are slums of hope and slums of despair.  It promotes slums of hope, which contribute, not only to individual opportunities, but also to [[Nation-building|nation building]].

The opportunity matrix must also respond to young professionals, to skilled, well-paid [[day labor]]ers, to the [[upper middle class]] and to affluent entrepreneurs.   If a range of needs, of abilities to pay, of locational requirements, and of levels of development of shelter, is addressed, then opportunities are being created.

Intelligent urbanism believes that [[Capitalism|private enterprise]] is the logical provider of opportunities, but that alone it will not be just or effective.  The regime of land, left to [[Market Forces|market forces]] alone, will create an exclusive, dysfunctional society.  Intelligent urbanism believes that there is an essential role for the [[civil society]] to intervene in the opportunity matrix of the city.

Intelligent urbanism promotes opportunities through access to:

* Basic and primary education, skill development and knowledge about the  urban world;
* Basic health care, potable water, solid waste disposal and hygiene;
* Urban facilities like storm drainage, street lights, roads and footpaths;
* Recreation and entertainment;
* Transport, energy, communications;
* [[Public participation]] and debate;
* Finance and investment mechanisms;
* Land and/or built-up space where [[goods and services]] can be produced;
* Rudimentary economic infrastructure;
* Intelligent urbanism provides a wide range of zones, districts and precincts where activities and functions can occur without detracting from one another.

Intelligent urbanism proposes that enterprise can only flourish where a public framework provides opportunities for enterprise.  This system of opportunities operates through public investments in economic and social infrastructure; through incentives in the form of appropriate finance, tax inducements, subsidized skill development for workers, and: regulations which protect the environment, safety, hygiene and health. To ensure a stable playing field where one can make an investment with predictable returns, a modicum of regulation is necessary. Proponents argue that it is through government regulations that private investment can be protected from fraud. It is through government regulation that the under-pinning conditions for [[free enterprise]] can be protected.

===Principle eight: regional integration===
Intelligent urbanism envisions the city as an organic part of a larger environmental, [[Socioeconomics|socio-economic]] and cultural-geographic system, essential for its sustainability. This zone of influence is the region.  Likewise, it sees the region as integrally connected to the city.  Intelligent urbanism sees the planning of the city and its hinterland as a single holistic process.  Proponents argue if one does not recognize growth as a regional phenomenon, then development will play a [[hopscotch]] game of moving just a bit further along an arterial roads, further up valleys above the municipal jurisdiction,  staying beyond the path of the city boundary, development regulations and of the urban tax regime.

The region may be defined as the [[drainage basin|catchment area]] from which employees and students commute into the city on a daily basis. It is the catchment area from which people choose to visit one city, as opposed to another, for retail shopping and entertainment. Economically the city region may include the hinterland that depends on its wholesale markets, banking facilities, transport hubs and information exchanges. The region needing integration may be seen as the zone from which perishable foods, firewood and building materials supply the city.  The economic region can also be defined as the area managed by exchanges in the city.  Telephone calls to the region go through the city's telecom exchange; post goes through the city's general [[post office]]; money transfers go through the city’s [[financial institution]]s and internet data passes electronically through the city’s servers.  The area over which “city exchanges" disperse matter can well be called the city’s economic hinterland or region.  Usually the region includes dormitory communities, airports, water reservoirs, perishable food farms, hydro facilities, out-of-doors recreation and other infrastructure that serves the city.   Intelligent urbanism sees the integrated planning of these services and facilities as part of the city planning process.

Intelligent urbanism understands that the social and economic region linked to a city also has a physical form, or a geographic character.   A hierarchy of watersheds, creating valleys and defining edges of neighborhoods, may define the geographic character.  Forest ranges, fauna and avifauna habitats are set within such regions and are connected by natural corridors for movement and cross-fertilization.  Within this larger, environmental scenario, one must conceptualize urbanism in terms of watersheds, subterranean aquifer systems, and other natural systems that operate across the entire region.  Economic infrastructure, such as roads, hydro basins, irrigation channels, water reservoirs and related distribution networks usually follow the terrain of the [[regional geography]].  The region’s geographic portals, and lines of control, may also define defense and security systems deployment.

Intelligent urbanism recognizes that there is always a spillover of population from the city into the region, and that population in the region moves into the city for work, shopping, entertainment, health care and education.  With thoughtful planning the region can take pressure off of the city.  Traditional and new settlements within the urban region can be enhanced and densified to accommodate additional urban households.  There are many activities within the city, which are growing and are incompatible with urban habitat.  Large, noisy and polluting workshops and manufacturing units are amongst these.  Large wholesale markets, storage sheds, vehicular maintenance garages, and waste management facilities need to be housed outside of the city’s limits in their own satellite enclaves. In larger urban agglomerations a number of towns and cities are clustered around a major  urban center forming a metropolitan region.

Intelligent urbanism is not just planning for the present; it is also planning for the distant future.  Intelligent urbanism is not Utopian, but futuristic in its need to forecast the scenarios to come, within its own boundaries, and within the boundaries of the distant future.

===Principle nine: balanced movement===
Intelligent urbanism advocates integrated transport systems comprising walkways, cycle paths, bus lanes, light rail corridors, under-ground metros and automobile channels. A balance between appropriate modes of movement  is proposed. More capital intensive transport systems should move between high density nodes and hubs, which interchange with lower technology movement options. These modal split nodes become the public domains around which cluster high density, pedestrian, mixed-use urban villages (Taniguchi:2001).

The PIU accepts that the automobile is  here to stay, but that it should not be made essential by design. A well planned metropolis would densify along mass transit corridors and around major urban hubs. Smaller, yet dense, urban nodes are seen as micro-zones of medium level density, public amenities and pedestrian access. At these points lower level nodal split will occur, such as between bus loops and cycle tracts. The PIU views nodal split points as places of urban conviviality and access to services and facilities. Modal split can be between walking, cycling, driving, and mass transit. Bus loops may feed larger rail-based rapid-movement corridors. Social and economic infrastructure becomes more intensive as movement corridors become more intense.

===Principle ten: institutional integrity===
Intelligent urbanism holds that good practices inherent in considered principles can only be realized through accountable, transparent, competent and participatory local governance, founded on appropriate data bases, due entitlements, civic responsibilities and duties. The PIU promotes a range of facilitative and promotive urban development management tools to achieve appropriate urban practices, systems and forms(Islam:2000). None of the principles or practices the PIU promotes can be implemented unless there is a strong and rational institutional framework to define, channel and legalize urban development, in all of its aspects. Intelligent urbanism envisions the institutional framework as being very clear about the rules and regulations it sponsors and that those using discretion in implementing these measures must do so in a totally open, recorded and transparent manner.

Intelligent urbanism facilitates the public in carrying out their honest objectives.  It does not regulate and control the public.  It attempts to reduce the requirements, steps and documentation required for citizens to process their proposals.

Intelligent urbanism is also promotive in furthering the interests of the public in their genuine utilization of opportunities.  It promotes site and services schemes for households who can construct their own houses.  It promotes up-gradation of settlements with inadequate basic services.  It promotes innovative financing to a range of actors who can contribute to the city’s development.  Intelligent urbanism promotes a limited role for government, for example in “packaging" large-scale urban development schemes, so that the private sector is promoted to actually build and market urban projects, which were previously built by the government.

Intelligent urbanism does not consider itself naïve.  It recognizes that there are developers and promoters who have no long term commitment to their own constructions, and their only concern is to hand over a dwelling, gain their profit and move on.  For these players it is essential to have [[Development Control]] Regulations, which assure the public that the products they invest in are safe, hygienic, orderly, durable and efficient.  For the discerning citizen, such rules also lay out the civil understanding by which a [[complex society]] agrees to live together.

The PIU contends that there must be a cadastral System wherein all of the land in the jurisdiction of cities is demarcated, surveyed, characterized and archived, registering its legal owner, its legal uses, and the tax defaults against it.

The institutional framework can only operate where there is a Structure Plan, or other document that defines how the land will be used, serviced, and accessed.  The Structure Plan tells landowners and promoters what the parameters of development are, which assures that their immediate investments are secure, and that the returns and use of such efforts are predictable.   A Structure Plan is intended to provide owners and investors with predictable future scenarios.  Cities require efficient patterns for their main infrastructure systems and utilities.  According to PIU proponents, land needs to be used in a judicious manner, organizing complementary functions and activities into compact, mixed use precincts and separating out non-compatible uses into their own precincts.   In a similar manner, proponents argue it is only through a plan that heritage sites and the environment can be legally protected.  Public assets in the form of nature, religious places, heritage sites and open space systems must be designated in a legal plan.

Intelligent urbanism proposes that the city and its surrounding region be regulated by a Structure Plan, or equivalent mechanism, which acts as a [[legal instrument]] to guide the growth, development and enhancement of the city.

According to proponents, there must be a system of participation by the “Stake Holders" in the preparation of plans.  Public meetings, hearings of objections and transparent processes of addressing objections, must be institutionalized.  Intelligent urbanism promotes Public Participation.  Local Area Plans must be prepared which address local issues and take into account local views and sentiments regarding plan objectives, configurations, standards and patterns.  Such plans lay out the sites of plots showing the roads, public open spaces, amenities areas and conservation sites.  Land Pooling assures the beneficiaries from provision of public infrastructure and amenities proportionally contribute and that a few individuals do not suffer from reservations in the plan.

According to proponents, there must be a system of Floor Area Ratios to assure that the land and the services are not over pressured.  No single plot owner should have more than the determined "fair share" of utilization of the access roads, amenities and utilities that service all of the sites.  Floor Area Ratios temper this relationship as regulated the manner in which public services are consumed.  According to PIU proponents, [[Air rights|Transfer of Development Rights]] benefits land owners whose properties have been reserved under the plan.  It also benefits the local authorities that lack the financial resources to purchase lands to implement the [[Structure Plans]].  It benefits concentrated, [[Central business district|city center]] project promoters who have to amortize expensive land purchases, by allowing them to purchase the development rights from the owners of reserved lands and to hand over those properties to the plan implementing authority.  This allows the local authority to widen roads and to implement the Structure Plan.  The local authority then transfers the needed development right to city center promoters.

Intelligent urbanism supports the use of Architectural Guidelines where there is a tradition to preserve and where precedents can be used to specify architectural elements, motifs and language in a manner, which intended to reinforce a cultural tradition.  Building designs must respect traditional elements, even though the components may vary greatly to integrate contemporary functions. Even in a greenfield setting Architectural Guidelines are required to assure harmony and continuity of building proportions, scale, color, patterns, motifs, materials and facades.

Intelligent urbanism insists on safety, hygiene, durability and utility in the design and construction of buildings.  Where large numbers of people gather in schools, hospitals, and other  public facilities that may become [[emergency shelter]]s in disasters, special care must be exercised.  A suitable [[Building code|Building Code]] is the proposed instrument to achieve these aims.

PIU proponents state that those who design buildings must be professionally qualified architects; those who design the structures (especially of more than ground plus two levels) must be professionally qualified structural engineers; those who build buildings must be qualified civil engineers; and, those who supervise and control construction must be qualified construction managers.  Intelligent urbanism promotes the professionalisation of the city making process.  While promoting professionalism, intelligent urbanism proposes that this not become a barrier in the development process.  Small structures, low-rise structures, and humble structures that do not house many people can be self designed and constructed by the inhabitants themselves.  Proponents maintain that there must be recognized Professional Accrediting Boards, or Professional Bodies, to see that urban development employs adequate technical competence.

Finally, there must be legislation creating statutory [[Local government|local authorities]], and empowering them to act, manage, invest, service, protect, promote and facilitate urban development and all of the opportunities that a modern city must sponsor.

Intelligent urbanism insists that cities, local authorities, regional development commissions and planning agencies be professionally managed.  City Managers can be hired to manage the delivery of services, the planning and management of planned development, the maintenance of utilities and the creation of amenities.

Intelligent urbanism views plans and urban designs and housing configurations as expressions of the people for whom they are planned.  The processes of planning must therefore be a participatory involving a range of stakeholders.  The process must be a transparent one, which makes those privileged to act as guardians of the people’s will accountable for their decisions and choices.  Intelligent urbanism sees urban planning and city governance as the most salient expressions of civility.  Intelligent urbanism fosters the evolution of institutional systems that enhance transparency, accountability and rational public decision making.

==Movements implementing the ten principles==
Though not necessarily related to the principles of intelligent urbanism, there are examples representing all or some of them in urban design theory and practice.
Concurrently, the recent movements of [[New Urbanism]] and [[New Classical Architecture]] promote a sustainable approach towards construction, that appreciates and develops [[smart growth]], [[Vernacular architecture|architectural tradition]] and [[Classical architecture|classical design]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnu.org/charter Charter of the New Urbanism]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beauty, Humanism, Continuity between Past and Future|url=http://www.traditionalarchitecture.co.uk/aims.html|publisher=Traditional Architecture Group|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This in contrast to [[Modern architecture|modernist]] and [[International Style (architecture)|globally uniform]] architecture, as well as leaning against solitary [[housing estate]]s and [[Urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aia.org/SiteObjects/files/smartgrowth05.pdf Issue Brief: Smart-Growth: Building Livable Communities]. American Institute of Architects. Retrieved on 2014-03-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Both trends started in the 1980s. The [[Driehaus Architecture Prize]] is an award that recognizes efforts in New Urbanism and New Classical Architecture, and is endowed with a prize money twice as high as that of the modernist [[Pritzker Architecture Prize|Pritzker Prize]].&lt;ref name="Driehaus Prize"&gt;{{cite web|title=Driehaus Prize|url=http://architecture.nd.edu/about/driehaus-prize/|work=''Together, the $200,000 Driehaus Prize and the $50,000 Reed Award represent the most significant recognition for classicism in the contemporary built environment.''|publisher=Notre Dame School of Architecture|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Electoral systems}}
The '''random ballot''', '''single stochastic vote''', or '''lottery voting''' is an [[electoral system]] in which an election is decided on the basis of a single randomly selected ballot. Whilst appearing superficially chaotic, the system has the potential to retain the most attractive characteristics of both [[first past the post]] and [[proportional representation]] systems in elections to multi-constituency bodies. It was first described in 1984 by [[Akhil Reed Amar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Akhil Reed Amar]] |date=June 1984 |title=Choosing representatives by lottery voting |volume=93 |issue=7 |journal=[[Yale Law Journal]] |pages=1283–1308 |url=http://www.law.yale.edu/documents/pdf/1984Choosing.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |jstor=796258 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831192620/http://www.law.yale.edu/documents/pdf/1984Choosing.pdf |archivedate=2006-08-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method and properties==
In an [[election]] or [[referendum]], the ballot of a single voter is selected at random, and that ballot decides the result of the election.  In this way, each candidate or option wins with a probability exactly equal to the fraction of the electorate favouring that candidate or option.

The random ballot method is decisive, in that there is no possibility of a tied vote, assuming that the selected voter has expressed a preference (if not then another ballot can be selected at random). It is unbiased, in that the [[probability]] of a particular result is equal to the proportion of total support that that result has in all the votes.  When used in a single-winner contest, it is also strategy-free, in that there is no advantage in [[tactical voting]].  But it is not deterministic, in that a different random selection could have produced a different result, and it does not conform to [[majority]] rule since there is a possibility that the selected voter may be in the [[minority group|minority]].

===Emergent properties===
{{see also|emergent property}}
If the random ballot is used to select the members of a multi-constituency body, it can serve to retain the attractive features of both [[first past the post]] and [[proportional representation]].

As the winner of each ballot is chosen randomly, the party with the largest vote share is most likely to get the greatest number of candidates. In fact, as the number of ballots grows, the percentage representation of each party in the elected body will get closer and closer to their actual proportion of the vote across the entire electorate. At the same time, the chance of a randomly selected highly unrepresentative body diminishes.

For example, a minority party with 1% of the vote might have a 1/100 chance of getting a seat in each ballot. In a 50-person assembly, the probability of a majority for this party being chosen by random ballot is approximately (using the [[binomial distribution]] CDF)

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{k=0}^{24} {50 \choose k} \left(\frac{99}{100}\right)^k\left(\frac{1}{100}\right)^{50-k} = I_{1/100}(26, 25) \approx 10^{-38}, &lt;/math&gt;

or one in hundred [[undecillion]]. This is a vanishingly small chance, which negates the possibility of small parties winning majorities due to random chance.

At same time, the random ballot preserves a local representative for each constituency, although this individual may not have received a majority of votes of his or her constituents.

==Prevalence==
There are no examples of the random ballot in use in practice, but as a [[thought experiment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Akhil Reed Amar]]|title="Lottery Voting: A Thought Experiment"|url=http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1963&amp;context=fss_papers|date=1 January 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has been used to explain some of the properties of other electoral systems, and it is occasionally used in real life as a tiebreaker for other methods.

==In fiction==
{{Relevance}}
A related system was hypothesized by [[Isaac Asimov]] in his short story "[[Franchise (Asimov)|Franchise]]" (1955: reprinted in ''[[Earth Is Room Enough]]'', Doubleday, 1957), where a single voter is chosen to decide each election. However, in Asimov's thought-experiment, the "elector" is not randomly selected, but chosen by computer to be as representative as possible of the populace at large. Asimov intended this story as a parody of [[opinion poll]]ing.

==Randomness in other electoral systems==
There is an element of randomness (other than tie-breaking) in some existing electoral systems, in two ways:

#It is often observed that candidates who are placed in a high position on the ballot-paper will receive extra votes as a result, from voters who are apathetic (especially in elections with [[compulsory voting]]) or who have a strong preference for a party but are indifferent among individual candidates representing that party (when there are two or more). For this reason, many societies have abandoned traditional alphabetical listing of candidates on the ballot in favour of either ranking by the parties (e.g., the [[Australian Senate]]), placement by lot, or rotation (e.g., [[Hare-Clark]] STV-PR system used in [[Tasmania]] and the [[Australian Capital Territory]]). When candidates are ordered by lot on the ballot, the advantage of [[donkey voting]] can be decisive in a close race.
#In some [[single transferable vote]]  (STV) systems of [[proportional representation]], an elected candidate's surplus of votes over and above the [[Droop quota|quota]] is transferred by selecting the required number of ballot papers at random. Thus, if the quota is 1,000 votes, a candidate who polls 1,200 [[first preference]] votes has a surplus of 200 votes that s/he does not need. In some STV systems ([[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] since 1922, and [[Australia]] from 1918 to 1984), electoral officials select 200 ballot-papers randomly from the 1,200. However, this has been criticised since it is not replicable if a recount is required. As a result, Australia has adopted a variant of [[fractional transfer]], a.k.a. the "[[Gregory method]]", by which all 1,200 ballot-papers are transferred but are marked down in value to 0.1666 (one-sixth) of a vote each. This means that 1,000 votes "stay with" the elected candidate, while the value of the 1,200 ballot-papers transferred equals only 200 votes.

==Similarities to other electoral systems==
A random ballot elects a representative by choosing a ballot at random; [[sortition]] is similar but elects individuals directly by lot, as if each ballot involved individuals voting for themselves.

{{Reading}}

'''Reading education''' is the process by which individuals are taught to derive meaning from text. Schoolchildren not capable of reading competently by the end of third grade can face obstacles to success in education. The third grade marks a crucial point in reading because students start to encounter broader variety of texts in their fourth grade&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.centerforpubliceducation.org/research/learning-read-reading-learn-glance|title=http://www.centerforpubliceducation.org/research/learning-read-reading-learn-glance|website=www.centerforpubliceducation.org|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Government-funded research on reading and reading instruction in the [[United States]] began in the 1960s. In the 1970s and 1980s, researchers began publishing findings based on converging evidence from multiple studies. However, these findings have been slow to move into typical classroom practice&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://scholar.harvard.edu/jameskim/publications/research-and-reading-wars-0|title=Research and the reading wars|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Competencies for proficient reading ==

Proficient reading is equally dependent on two critical skills: the ability to understand the [[language]] in which the text is written, and the ability to recognize and process printed text. Each of these competencies is likewise dependent on lower level skills and cognitive abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sedl.org/reading/framework/overview.html |author1=Hoover, Wesley A. |author2=Gough, Philip B. |title=Overview - The Cognitive Foundations of Learning to Read: A Framework |work=The Cognitive Foundations of Learning to Read: A Framework |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children who readily understand spoken language and who are able to fluently and easily recognize printed words do not usually have difficulty with [[reading comprehension]]. However, students must be proficient in both competencies to read well; difficulty in either domain undermines the overall reading process. At the conclusion of reading, children should be able to retell the story in their own words including characters, setting, and the events of the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sedl.org/reading/framework/framework.pdf |author=Wren, Sebastian  |title=The Cognitive Foundations of Learning to Read: A Framework |format=pdf |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reading researchers define a skilled reader as one who can understand written text as well as they can understand the same passage if spoken.

There is some debate as to whether print recognition requires the ability to perceive printed text and [[translate]] it into spoken language, or rather to [[translate]] printed text directly into meaningful symbolic models and relationships. The existence of speed reading, and its typically high comprehension rate would suggest that the translation into verbal form as an intermediate to understanding is not a prerequisite for effective reading comprehension. This aspect of reading is the crux of much of the reading debate.

The purpose of reading is to have access to the literature of a specific language. Reading materials have traditionally been chosen from literary texts that represent 'higher' forms of culture. According to many traditional approaches, the learner's aim is to study vocabulary items, grammar and sentence structures, with a concern for learning the syntax of these 'higher' cultures. These approaches assume that authentic reading material is limited to the work or experience of great authors.

== Instructional methods ==

A variety of different methods of teaching reading have been advocated in [[English-speaking countries]].
In the United States, the debate is often more political than objective.&lt;ref name="Adams, MJ 13"&gt;{{cite book |author=Adams, Marilyn Jager |title=Beginning to read: thinking and learning about print |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=1995 |pages=13 |isbn=0-262-51076-6 |oclc=469305891 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parties often divide into two camps which refuse to accept each other's terminology or frame of reference. Despite this both camps often incorporate aspects of the other's methods. Both camps accuse the other of causing failure to learn to read and write.&lt;ref name="Adams, MJ 13"/&gt; [[Phonics]] advocates assert that, to read a large vocabulary of words correctly and fluently requires detailed knowledge of the structure of the English language, particularly spelling-speech patterns.&lt;ref name="Adams, MJ 23,24"&gt;{{cite book |author=Adams, Marilyn Jager |title=Beginning to read: thinking and learning about print |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=1995 |pages=23, 24 |isbn=0-262-51076-6 |oclc=469305891 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whole Language  advocates assert that students do not need to be able to sound out words, but should look at unknown words and figure them out using context.&lt;ref name="Adams, MJ 23,24"/&gt;

===Research===
In 2000, the [[National Reading Panel]] (NRP) issued a report based on a meta-analysis of published research on effective reading instruction. The report found varying evidence-based support for some common approaches to teaching reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the National Reading Panel: Teaching Children to Read|url=http://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/nrp/findings.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Phonemic awareness====
The NRP called phonemic awareness (PA) instruction "impressive":

:Overall, the findings showed that teaching children to manipulate phonemes in words was highly effective under a variety of teaching conditions with a variety of learners across a range of grade and age levels and that teaching phonemic awareness to children significantly improves their reading more than instruction that lacks any attention to PA.
:
The report singles out PA instruction based on teaching children to manipulate phonemes with letters as highly effective. Phonemic awareness instruction also improved spelling in grade-level students, although it did not improve spelling in disabled readers.

===Lexical reading===
Lexical reading&lt;ref name='Neural Representations'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Ventral and Dorsal Streams'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Changes Reading Strategies'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Chinese Ventral and Dorsal Streams'/&gt; involve acquiring words or phrases without attention to the characters or groups of characters that compose them or by using [[Whole language]] learning and teaching methodology. Sometimes argued to be in competition with phonics methods, and that the whole language approach tends to impair learning how to spell.

Historically, the two camps have been called [[Whole Language]] and [[Phonics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://jan.ucc.nau.edu/jar/Reading_Wars.html|title=Reading Wars: Phonics vs. Whole Language|last=Reyhner|first=Jon|website=jan.ucc.nau.edu|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;, although the Whole Language instructional method has also been referred to as "literature-based reading program" and "integrated language arts curriculum".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Chall, Jeanne S. and Helen M. Popp, Teaching and Assessing Phonics: Why, What, When and How, Educators Publishing Service, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Currently (2007), the differing perspectives are frequently referred to as "balanced reading instruction" (Whole Language) and "scientifically-based reading instruction" (Phonics).&lt;ref&gt;Louisa Moats, Whole Language Lives On: The
Illusion of "Balanced" Reading Instruction, The Fordham Foundation, Oct 2000. Downloaded from http://www.edexcellence.net/doc/moats.pdf July 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Whole Word ====

Whole word, also known as "Sight Word" and "Look and Say", teaches reading skills and strategies in the context of authentic literature.  Word recognition accuracy is considered less important than meaning accuracy; therefore, there is an emphasis on comprehension as the ultimate goal.

Students in this method memorize the appearance of words, or learn to recognize words by looking at the first and last letter from rigidly selected vocabularies in progressive texts (such as ''The [[Cat in the Hat]]''). Often preliminary results show children taught with this method have higher reading levels than children learning phonics, because they learn to automatically recognise a small selection of words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adams|first=Marilyn|title=Beginning to Read:  Thinking and Learning About Print|year=1995|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, later tests demonstrate that literacy development becomes stunted when hit with longer and more complex words later.&lt;ref name="Adams, MJ 23,24"/&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=27530006|title=What Research Says about Phonics Instruction|first=Nila B.|last=Smith|date=1 January 1957|publisher=|journal=The Journal of Educational Research|volume=51|issue=1|pages=1–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Nila B.|date=September 1957|title=What Research Says about Phonics Instruction|jstor=27530006|journal=The Journal of Educational Research|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis, Ltd.|volume=51|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phonics refers to an instructional method for teaching children to read. The method teaches sounds to be associated with letters and combinations of letters.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Moats, Louisa |title=Spelling: development, disabilities, and instruction |publisher=York Press |location=Baltimore, Md |year=1995 |pages= |isbn=0-912752-40-8 |oclc=33404834 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Phonics]]" is distinct from the [[linguistics]] terms "[[phoneme]]" and "[[phonetics]]", which refer to sounds and the study of sounds respectively.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

Varieties of phonics include:

* [[Whole language|Embedded phonics]] is an instructional approach where letter sounds are taught opportunistically, as the need arises and in meaningful contexts, such as the reading of a storybook. Embedded phonics is often associated with a whole language approach to teaching reading.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}
* [[Synthetic phonics]] and analytic phonics are different but popular methods of teaching phonics. Synthetic and analytic phonics approaches both generally involve explicit, carefully sequenced instruction that teach a large body of phonics patterns.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}
** [[Synthetic phonics]] emphasizes the one-to-one correspondences between [[phonemes]] and [[graphemes]]. In synthetic phonics programs students say the sounds for the graphemes they see and orally blend them together to produce a spoken word. In the context of phonics, the word "[[wikt:blend|blend]]" takes on a different meaning from its use in [[linguistics]].
** In analytic phonics, students often learn phonograms, the [[syllable rime|rime]] parts of words including the vowel and what follows it. Students are taught to generalize the [[Phonogram (linguistics)|phonogram]] to multiple words. The phonogram ''-ail'' can be used to read ''fail, trail, mail, wail, sail'', and other words.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

The [[Samuel Orton|Orton phonography]], originally developed to teach brain-damaged adults to read, is a form of phonics instruction that blends synthetic and analytic components. Orton described 73 "phonograms", or letter combinations, and 23 rules for spelling and pronunciation which Orton claimed would allow the reader to correctly pronounce and spell all but 123 of the 13,000 most common English words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eslhq.com/forums/esl-articles/teaching-reading-121/|title=Teaching of Reading - ESL Articles - eslHQ|website=www.eslhq.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pronunciation guides ====
In contrast to phonics which teaches the pronunciation rules of English, a new technology [[Phonetically Intuitive English]] directly shows English words' pronunciation by adding diacritical marks on them. This solves the problem that pronunciation rules can often be confusing (for example, "ea" has a wide range of diverse pronunciations in "speak", "steak", "bread", "Korea", "reality", "create" and "ocean").

The pronunciation-guide approach has been proven very successful in reading education for languages with very complex orthography such as Chinese. [[Pinyin]] and [[Zhuyin]] are systems of phonetic transcription for Mandarin Chinese used in [[China]] and [[Taiwan]] respectively, and are printed above or next to Chinese characters in children's books, textbooks and newspapers as a pronunciation guide, and have enabled Chinese-speaking countries to achieve high literacy rates for one of the most difficult languages in the world.

=== Other instructional methods ===

===Guided Reading===
During guided reading teachers work with small groups of students. These are students with similar reading levels. Students will read with teachers in books at their personal reading level, not where the grade level is at. During this time the teachers will work with students to practice decoding, fluency, vocabulary and comprehension skills.

====Native reading====
Some methods of mix phonics and whole word. Native reading, for example, differs from both in that it emphasizes teaching reading beginning at a very early age, when the human brain is neurodevelopmentally most receptive to learning language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nativereading.com/introduction.html Native Reading Chapter 1] by Timothy Kailing&lt;/ref&gt; Native readers learn to read as toddlers, starting at the same time they learn to speak, or very soon thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kailing | first = Timothy D. | title = Native Reading | publisher = Elliptical Research Books |year=2008 | isbn = 978-1-4348-4881-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Reading Workshop ====
Reading Workshop is based on the premise that readers need time to read and discuss their reading.  Readers need access to a wide variety of reading materials of their choice. Classrooms must acquire a wide variety of reading materials to accommodate this need. Readers need to respond to the text and demonstrate quality literate behaviors. There is not a script to follow but a frame work to guide instruction.  Students are exposed to a variety of learning experiences.  There is time for student collaboration and a time for engaged reading.&lt;ref name="Serafini"&gt;{{cite web|last=Serafini|first=Frank |url=http://www.frankserafini.com/MainPages/WorkshopHandouts.html |title=Workshop Handouts Serafini, F. (2008) |work= |accessdate=March 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During reading workshop, the teacher models a whole-group strategy lesson and then gives students large blocks of time to read and to practice the strategy.  This practice can occur independently, with partners, or in small groups with a book or text chosen by the student.  The teacher moves around the room and confers with the students about their reading.  The teacher can meet with small, flexible groups to provide additional needs-based instruction.  At the end of the workshop the whole groups comes together to share their learning.&lt;ref name="Goudvis"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Anne Goudvis |author2=Stephanie Harvey |title=Strategies that work: teaching comprehension for understanding and engagement |publisher=Stenhouse Publishers |location=York, Me |year=2007 |pages=37–38 |isbn=1-57110-481-X |oclc=232347335 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples of Improving Reading===
An adult or peer reads with the student by modeling fluent reading and then asking the student to read the same passage aloud with encouragement and feedback by the adult or peer.
A student listens to a tape of a fluent reader reading text at the student's independent level at a pace of about 80-100 words a minute. The student listens to the tape the first time and then practices reading along with the tape until the student is able to read fluently.
The student reads with a peer partner. Each partner takes a turn reading to the other. A more fluent reader can be paired with a less fluent reader to model fluent reading. The more fluent reader can provide feedback and encouragement to the less fluent reader. Students of similar reading skills can also be paired, particularly if the teacher has modeled fluent reading and the partner reading involves practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is Guided Oral Reading?|url=http://www.readingrockets.org/article/what-guided-oral-reading|website=Reading Rockets|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a list of the seven important strategies that all readers must be able to apply to text in order to read and understand content. The seven strategies are:
* 1.	Making Connections;
* 2.	Creating Mental Images;
* 3.	Making Inferences/Drawing Conclusions;
* 4.	Asking Questions;
* 5.	Determining What Is Important;
* 6.	Synthesizing; and
* 7.	Monitoring Comprehension and Meaning.&lt;ref name="Serafini"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goudvis"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Miller, Debbie S. |title=Reading with meaning: teaching comprehension in the primary grades |publisher=Stenhouse Publishers |location=York, Me |year=2002 |pages=53–157 |isbn=1-57110-307-4 |oclc=48773960 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Reading comprehension ====
{{Main|Reading comprehension}}

Reading comprehension requires making sense of text, which allows a reader to gain knowledge, enjoy a story, and make connections with the larger world.&lt;ref name="Cain 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cain|first=Kate|title=Making Sense of Text:  Skills That Support Text Comprehension and Its Development|journal=Expert Perspectives on Interventions for Reading: A Collection of Best Practice Articles from the International Dyslexia Association|year=2009|pages= |url=http://www.eprints.lancs.ac.uk/26618/1/Cain2009IDAPerspectives.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several skills support reading comprehension, including making predictions and inferences, monitoring understanding, using text structures, and using prior knowledge effectively.&lt;ref name="Cain 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Duffy 2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Duffy|first=Gerald|title=Explaining Reading:  A Resource for Teaching Concepts, Skills, and Strategies|year=2009|publisher=The Guilford Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-60623-075-6|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the most important aspects of successful comprehension are activating prior knowledge and metacognition, which are two of the principles of learning identified in the National Research Council's report.''&lt;ref name="Donovan"&gt;{{cite book|last=Donovan|first=M. S.|author2=J. D.

Many studies have identified the importance of prior knowledge in reading comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carr|first=S. C.|author2=B. Thompson |title=The Effects of Prior Knowledge and Schema Activation Strategies on the Inferential Reading Comprehension of Children With and Without Learning Disabilities|journal=Learning Disability Quarterly|year=1996|volume=19|issue=1|pages=49 |url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ519854&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ519854 |accessdate=2/7/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Many researchers have shown that having some prior knowledge about the topic of a passage enables both greater comprehension of the text and better memory for it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Priebe SJ, Keenan JM, Miller AC |title=How Prior Knowledge Affects Word Identification and Comprehension |journal=Read Writ |volume=7 |issue= |pages=581–586 |date=July 2011 |pmid=21799586 |doi=10.1007/s11145-010-9260-0 |url= |pmc=3142886}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "if we have prior knowledge about a topic in a text, we construct meaning based on our experience, and we can adjust and change those plans as we go along."&lt;ref name="Duffy 2009"/&gt; Some authors specify two types of prior knowledge necessary for successful comprehension.  World knowledge aids in understanding fiction and domain-specific knowledge facilitates comprehension of nonfiction.&lt;ref name="McNamara 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McNamara|first=Danielle|title=The Importance of Teaching Reading Strategies|journal=Expert Perspectives on Interventions for Reading: A Collection of Best-Practice Articles form the International Dyslexia Association|year=2009|pages= |url=http://www.austinschools.org/curriculum/RtI/resources/documents/research/Teaching_Reading_Strategies_McNamara.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Students who lack this, request background information, so as to make connections with and within the text.&lt;ref name="McKeown 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McKeown|first=Margaret|author2=Isabel Beck |author3=Ronette Blake |title=Reading Comprehension Instruction:  Focus on Content or Strategies?|journal=Expert Perspectives on Interventions for Reading: A Collection of Best-Practice Articles from the International Dyslexia Association|year=2009|pages= |url=http://www.austinschools.org/curriculum/RtI/resources/documents/research/Rand_Report.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another learning principle that greatly influences reading comprehension is the use of metacognition.  The 'metacognitive' approach to instruction can help students learn to take control of their own learning by defining learning goals and monitoring their progress in achieving them."&lt;ref name="Donovan"/&gt; A great deal of research indicates that accomplished readers "monitor their comprehension as they read by engag[ing] in strategic processing, such as rereading previous text, to resolve comprehension failure."&lt;ref name="Cain 2009"/&gt; Students who are not able to track their own understanding gain neither information or enjoyment from reading as they do not know how to obtain meaning from the text.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Many strategies have been applied.&lt;ref name="McNamara 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McKeown 2009"/&gt;  Many studies point to the success of strategy instruction, particularly for students who are poor comprehenders.&lt;ref name="McNamara 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McKeown 2009"/&gt; Some strategies that have been helpful are summarization, question generation, making predictions and inferences, image making, knowledge and use of text structure, rereading, self-regulation, activation of prior knowledge, questioning the author, and using graphic organizers.&lt;ref name="Cain 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McNamara 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McKeown 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tolman|first=Carol|title=Working Smarter, Not Harder:  What Teachers of Reading Need to Know and Be Able to Teach|journal=Expert Perspectives on Interventions for Reading: A Collection of Best-Practice Articles from the International Dyslexia Association|year=2012|pages= |url=http://www.winsorlearning.com/site/resources/articles/working-smarter-not-harder/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The variety of strategies allows the teacher to choose a strategy or strategies to suit the text and the needs of the student.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

For an example of a specific intervention incorporating four strategies for comprehension building, utilized reciprocal teaching to model summarizing, questioning, clarifying, and predicting.&lt;ref name="PalinscarBrown1984"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Palinscar|first1=Aannemarie Sullivan|last2=Brown|first2=Ann L.|title=Reciprocal Teaching of Comprehension-Fostering and Comprehension-Monitoring Activities|journal=Cognition and Instruction|volume=1|issue=2|year=1984|pages=117–175|issn=0737-0008|doi=10.1207/s1532690xci0102_1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors indicate that they choose these skills due to their dual functions as "comprehension-fostering and comprehension monitoring activities."&lt;ref name="PalinscarBrown1984"/&gt;  The reciprocal teaching method, which involves the teacher modeling the designated activities and gradually turning the procedure over to the students themselves, uses Vygotsky's idea of scaffolding.  In this process, "children first experience a particular set of cognitive activities in the presence of experts, and only gradually come to perform these functions by themselves.&lt;ref name="PalinscarBrown1984"/&gt;  In this study, the students who participated in the reciprocal teaching intervention showed dramatic improvement in comprehension scores and maintained them for at least eight weeks.&lt;ref name="PalinscarBrown1984"/&gt;

==== Non-traditional approaches ====
Programs have been established to provide certified therapy animals, such as dogs, as non-judgmental "listeners" to build motivation and help children build proficiency and gain confidence in their reading ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://westhartford.patch.com/groups/schools/p/read-benefits-all-readers-in-bugbee-classroom |title=Reading with Dogs Benefits All in Bugbee Classroom |last=Newton |first=Ronni (editor) |date=June 21, 2013 |website=West Hartford Patch |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6IHPAQiGk |archivedate=July 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Success rate of reading education in the US==
{{Main|Literacy in the United States}}

National literacy rates range from about 10 percent to 99+ percent.

There are several approaches used to teach reading and the U.S. Office of Education Cooperative Research Program has a compilation of these.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=How to Teach Balanced Reading and Writing|last=Burns|first=Bonnie|publisher=Corwin Press|year=2006|isbn=1412937418|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, there is a list based on 29 individual studies that identify effective approaches when teaching reading for beginners. The bulk of the studies revealed that successful instructional strategies include [[Synthetic phonics|systematic phonics]] and approaches that focus on connected reading and meaning. These strategies were proved to be more effective than basal alone approaches. Specific studies that show instructional models that achieve high success rates in reading education include the so-called Actual Community Empowerment (ACE) program, which is a small-group tutoring framework that focuses on fluency, [[word recognition]], decoding and the concept of comprehension that is based on the appropriate pace of learning according to individual learning profiles.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Community Action Research: Benefits to Community Members and Service Providers|last=Reeb|first=Roger|publisher=Haworth Press|year=2006|isbn=9780789030467|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program, thus, has different variations. Once ACE was implemented in 40 locations in [[Philadelphia]], learners posted a 95 percent success rate for significant reading improvement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Traditional reading instruction approaches that are considered effective include those under a [[Cognitive model|cognitive-based model]], which treats reading acquisition and reading comprehension to be dependent on [[Cognitive development|cognitive development.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cognitive Revolution on Educational Psychology|last=Royer|first=James|publisher=Information Age Publishing|year=2006|isbn=1593111630|location=Greenwich, CT|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Print exposure ==
[[Print exposure]] the amount of time a child or person spends being visually aware of the written word (reading)--whether that be through newspapers, magazines, books, journals, scientific papers, or more. Research has shown that the amount of print material that a child accesses has deep cognitive consequences. In addition, the act of reading itself, for the most part irrespective of what is being read, increases the achievement difference among children.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Children who are exposed to large amounts of print often have more success in reading and have a larger vocabulary to draw from than children who see less print. The average conversations among college graduates, spouses or adult friends contain less rare (advanced) words than the average preschool reading book. Other print sources have increasingly higher amounts of rare words, from children's books, to adult books, to popular magazines, newspapers, and scientific articles (listed in increasing level of difficulty). Television, even adult news shows, do not have the same level of rare words that children's books do.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012|author=Massaro, D. W.|title=Two Different Communication Genres and Implications for Vocabulary Development and Learning to Read. Journal of Literacy Research December 2015 47: 505–527, first published on February 17, 2016 .}}

The issue is that oral language is very repetitive. To learn to read effectively a child needs to have a large vocabulary. Without this, when the child does read they stumble over words that they do not know, and have trouble following the idea of the sentence. This leads to frustration and a dislike of reading. When a child is faced with this difficulty he or she is less likely to read, thus further inhibiting the growth of their vocabulary.

Children who enjoy reading do it more frequently and improve their vocabulary. A study of out-of-school reading of fifth graders, found that a student in the 50th percentile read books about 5 minutes a day, while a student in the 20th percentile read books for less than a minute a day. This same study found that the amount of time a child in the 10th percentile spent reading in two days, was the amount of time a child in the 90th percentile spent reading all year.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Print exposure can also be a big factor in learning English as a second language. [[Book flood]] experiments are an example of this. The book flood program brought books in English to the classroom. Through focusing their English language learning on reading books instead of endless worksheets the teachers were able to improve the rate at which their students learned English.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

== Alphabetic principle and English orthography ==
{{Main|Alphabetic principle}}

Beginning readers must understand the concept of the ''alphabetic principle'' in order to master basic reading skills. A [[writing system]] is said to be ''alphabetic'' if it uses symbols to represent individual language sounds. In comparison, [[Logogram#Logographic systems|Logographic writing systems]] such as [[Japanese writing system|Japanese]] [[kanji]] and [[Written Chinese|Chinese]] [[Chinese characters|hanzi]] use a symbol to represent a word. And both cultures also use [[syllabary|syllabic writing systems]] such as Japanese [[kana]] and Chinese [[Yi script]], there are also many Chinese alphabets.

English is one of several languages using the [[Latin Alphabet]] [[writing system]]. The [[orthographic depth]] of such languages varies. The [[Italian orthography|Italian]] and [[Finnish language]]s have the purest, or shallowest orthographies, and [[English orthography]] is the deepest or most complex. In the shallow [[Spanish language|Spanish]] orthography; most words are spelled the way they sound, that is, word spellings are almost always regular. English orthography, on the other hand, is far more complex in that it does not have a one-to-one correspondence between symbols and sounds. English has individual sounds that can be represented by more than one symbol or symbol combination. For example, the long |a| sound can be represented by a-[[consonant]]-e as in ate, -ay as in hay, -ea as in steak, -ey as in they, -ai as in pain, and -ei as in vein. In addition, there are many words with irregular spelling and many [[homophones]] (words that sound the same but have different meanings and often different spellings as well). Pollack Pickeraz (1963) asserted that there are 45 phonemes in the [[English language]], and that the 26 letters of the English alphabet can represent them in about 350 ways.

The irregularity of English spelling is largely an artifact of how the language developed.
English is a [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] language with substantial influences and additional vocabulary from [[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]], and [[French language|French]], among others. Imported words usually follow the spelling patterns of their language of origin.&lt;ref name="King 2000"&gt;{{cite book |author=Diana Hanbury King |title=English isn't crazy!: the elements of our language and how to teach them |publisher=York Press |location=Baltimore, Md |year=2000 |pages=xii, 15|isbn=0-912752-59-9 |oclc=45166702 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advanced English phonics instruction includes studying words according to their origin, and how to determine the correct spelling of a word using its language of origin.

Clearly, the complexity of [[English orthography]] makes it more difficult for children to learn decoding and encoding rules, and more difficult for teachers to teach them.&lt;ref name="King 2000"/&gt; However, effective [[word recognition]] relies on the basic understanding that letters represent the sounds of spoken language, that is, word recognition relies on the reader's understanding of the [[alphabetic principle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adams|first=Marilyn|title=Beginning to Read:  Thinking and Learning About Print|year=1995|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spelling reform ===

Attempts to make English spelling behave phonetically have given rise to various campaigns for [[spelling reform]]; none have been generally accepted. Opponents of simplified spellings point to the impossibility of phonetic spelling for a language with many diverse accents and dialects. Several distinguished scholars, however, have thoroughly disproven all reasonable objections to spelling reform, including this objection. See, for example, ''Dictionary of Simplified American Spelling.''&lt;ref&gt;Rondthaler, Edward and Edward J. Lias, ''Dictionary of Simplified American Spelling'' (New York: The American Language Academy, 1986)&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Lounsbury presented a devastating rebuttal to all reasonable objections to spelling reform in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lounsbury, Thomas Raynesford |title=English spelling and spelling reform |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Conn |year=1970 |pages=331–341 |isbn=0-8371-4264-4 |oclc=134359 |url=https://archive.org/details/englishspellings00lounuoft|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A shorter rebuttal of all the reasonable objections to spelling reform was made by Bob C Cleckler in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bob C. Cleckler |title=Lets End Our Literacy Crisis: The Desperately Needed Idea Whose Time Has Come |publisher=American University &amp; Colleges Press |location=Salt Lake City |year=2005 |pages=166–170 |isbn=1-58982-230-7 |oclc=636405856 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguists documenting the sounds of speech use various special symbols, of which the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] is the most widely known. Linguistics makes a distinction between a [[Phone (phonetics)|phone]] and phoneme, and between [[phonology]] and [[phonetics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://esl.fis.edu/grammar/langdiff/phono.htm|title=Language differences - Phonetics and phonology|last=Shoebottom|first=Paul|website=esl.fis.edu|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The study of words and their structure is [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], and the smallest units of meaning are [[morpheme]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ntid.rit.edu/sea/processes/wordknowledge/grammatical/whatare|title=What are Morphemes? {{!}} SEA - Supporting English Acquisition|website=www.ntid.rit.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The study of the relationship between words present in the language at one time is [[etymology|synchronic etymology]], part of [[descriptive linguistics]], and the study of word origins and evolution is [[etymology|diachronic etymology]], part of [[historical linguistics]]

[[English orthography]] gives priority first to morphology, then to etymology, and lastly to phonetics. Thus the spelling of a word is dependent principally upon its structure, its relationship to other words, and its language or origin. It is usually necessary to know the meaning of a word in order to spell it correctly, and its meaning will be indicated by the similarity to words of the same meaning and family&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.myenglishlanguage.com/linguistics-language-guide/english-orthography/|title=English Orthography - The English Writing System - English Spelling|work=My English Language|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[English language|English]] uses a 26 letter [[Latin alphabet]], but the number of [[grapheme]]s is expanded by several [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]], [[Trigraph (orthography)|trigraphs]], and [[tetragraph]]s, while the letter "q" is not used as a grapheme by itself, only in the digraph "qu"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theschoolrun.com/what-is-a-grapheme|title=What is a grapheme?|work=TheSchoolRun|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Each grapheme may represent a limited number of phonemes depending on [[etymology]] and location in the word. Likewise each phoneme may be represented by a limited number of graphemes. Some letters are not part of any grapheme, but function as etymological markers. Graphemes do not cross [[morpheme]] boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://prowritingaid.com/art/317/What-are-Phonemes,-Graphemes,-and-Digraphs.aspx|title=What is the Difference Between a Phoneme, a Grapheme and a Digraph?|website=prowritingaid.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morphemes are spelled consistently, following rules inflection and word-formation, and allow readers and writers to understand and produce words they have not previously encountered&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tesol-direct.com/tesol-resources/english-grammar-guide/morphemes/|title=Morphemes in English grammar {{!}} TESOL Direct|work=TESOL Direct|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== Initial teaching alphabet ====
{{Main|Initial teaching alphabet}}
This method was designed to overcome the fact that English orthography has a many-to-many relationship between graphemes and phonemes. The method fell into disuse because children still had to learn the [[Latin alphabet]] and the conventional English spellings in order to integrate with society outside of school. It also recreated the problem of dialect dependent spelling, which the standardization of spelling had been created to eliminate&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://itafoundation.org/about-us/what-is-i-t-a/|title=Initial Teaching Alphabet Foundation {{!}}   What is i.t.a.?|website=itafoundation.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Augmenting spelling with pronunciation information ===

Unlike spelling reforms, we can actually keep a word's original spelling intact but add pronunciation information to it, e.g. using diacritics. [[Phonetically Intuitive English]] is a Chrome browser extension that automatically adds such a pronunciation guide to English words on Web pages, for English-speaking children to recognize a written word's pronunciation and therefore map the written word to the mental word in his mind.

== Practical application ==

In practice, many children are exposed to both "Phonic" and "Whole Language" methods, coupled with reading programs that combine both elements&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allaboutlearningpress.com/whole-language-or-phonics-which-approach-is-best|title=Whole Language or Phonics: Which Approach Is Best?|website=www.allaboutlearningpress.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. For example, the extremely popular book, ''Teach Your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons'', by Siegfried Engelman, et al. ({{ISBN|0-671-63198-5}}), teaches pronunciation and simple phonics, then supplements it with progressive texts and practice in directed reading. The end result of a mixed method is a casually phonetic student, a much better first-time pronouncer and speller, who still also has look-say acquisition, quick fluency and [[Reading comprehension|comprehension]]. Using an eclectic method, students can select their preferred learning style. This lets all students make progress, yet permits a motivated student to use and recognize the best traits of each method&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.observerbd.com/2015/02/13/72233.php|title=Eclectic approach to teaching language|website=www.observerbd.com|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Speed reading]] continues where basic education stops. Usually after some practice, many students' reading speed can be significantly increased. There are various speed-reading techniques&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/tim-ferriss/speed-reading_b_5317784.html|title=How I Learned to Read 300 Percent Faster in 20 Minutes|last=Ferriss|first=Tim|date=2014-05-13|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

However, speed reading does not guarantee comprehension or retention of what was read.

[[Readability]] indicates the ease of understanding or comprehension due to the style of writing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.profweb.ca/en/publications/articles/using-readability-analysis-to-make-students-stronger-writers|title=Using readability analysis to make students stronger writers|website=Profweb|language=en|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== History ==
[[File:Alice-gorham-burt-1905.png|upright|thumb|1905 edition cover of ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland retold in words of one syllable'']]
In colonial times, reading instruction was simple and straightforward: teach children the code and then let them read. At that time, reading material was not specially written for children but consisted primarily of the Bible and some patriotic essays; the most influential early textbook was ''[[The New England Primer]],'' published late 1680s. There was little consideration for how best to teach children to read or how to assess reading comprehension.
&lt;ref name="Adams, 1990"&gt;{{cite book |author=Adams, Marilyn Jager |title=Beginning to read: thinking and learning about print |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=1990 |pages=21–25 |isbn=0-262-01112-3 |oclc=256731826 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not until the mid-19th century did this approach change significantly. Educators, in particular [[Horace Mann]], began to advocate changes in reading instructional methods. He observed that children were bored and "death-like" at school, and that instruction needed to engage children's interest in the reading material by teaching them to read whole words.&lt;ref name="Adams, 1990"/&gt; The [[McGuffey Readers]] (1836) were the most popular of these more engaging [[graded reader]]s. In the mid-19th century, [[Kate Harrington (Poet)|Rebecca Smith Pollard]] developed a sequential reading program of intensive synthetic phonics, complete with a separate teacher's manual and [[spelling]] and [[Reading (process)|reading]] books&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.k12academics.com/reading-education-united-states/history-reading-education-us|title=History of Reading Education in the U.S. {{!}} K12 Academics|last=Glavin|first=Chris|date=2014-02-06|website=www.k12academics.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

From the 1890s to at least 1910, A. L. Burt of New York and other publishing companies published series of books aimed at young readers, using simple language to retell longer classics. Mrs J. C. Gorham produced three such works, ''Gulliver's Travels in words of one syllable'' (1896), ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland retold in words of one syllable]]'' (1905), and ''Black Beauty retold in words of one syllable'' (1905). In the UK, Routledge published a similar series between 1900 and 1910.

The meaning-based curriculum did not dominate reading instruction until the second quarter of the 20th century. Beginning in the 1930s and 1940s, reading programs became very focused on comprehension and taught children to read whole words by sight. [[Phonics]] was not to be taught except sparingly and as a tool to be used as a last resort.&lt;ref name="Adams, 1990"/&gt;

In the 1950s [[Rudolf Flesch]] wrote a book called ''Why Johnny Can't Read'',&lt;ref name="Flesch, R"&gt;{{cite book |author=Flesch, Rudolf Franz |title=Why Johnny can't read: and what you can do about it |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |location=San Francisco |year=1986 |pages= |isbn=0-06-091340-1 |oclc=12837722 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a passionate argument in favor of teaching children to read using [[phonics]].&lt;ref name="Adams, 1990"/&gt; Addressed to the mothers and fathers of America, he also hurled severe criticism at publishers' decisions that he claimed were motivated by profit, and he questioned the honesty and intelligence of experts, schools, and teachers.&lt;ref name="Adams, 1990"/&gt; The book was on the best seller list for 30 weeks and spurred a hue and cry in general population. It also polarized the reading debate among educators, researchers, and parents.&lt;ref name="Adams, 1990"/&gt;

This polarization continues to the present time. In the 1970s an instructional philosophy called [[whole language]] (which de-emphasizes teaching phonics out of context) was introduced, and it became the primary method of [[Reading (process)|reading]] instruction in the 1980s and 1990s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.helpingeverychildtoread.com/index.php/causes-of-difficulty/reading-theories/whole-word-method|title=Whole Word Method|website=www.helpingeverychildtoread.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. During this time, researchers (such as the [[National Institute of Health]]) conducted studies showing that early [[Learning to read|reading acquisition]] depends on the understanding of the connection between sounds and letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Adams, Marilyn Jager |title=Beginning to read: thinking and learning about print |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=1994 |pages= |isbn=0-262-51076-6 |oclc=256731826 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sight-word (Whole Word) method was invented by Rev. [[Thomas H. Gallaudet]], the director of the American Asylum at Hartford in the 1830s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sightwords.com/sight-words/lessons/|title=Sight Words Teaching Strategy {{!}} Sight Words: Teach Your Child to Read|website=www.sightwords.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Horace Mann]] the then Secretary of the Board of Education of [[Massachusetts]], [[United States|USA]] favored the method and it soon became the dominant method statewide&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/onlyateacher/horace.html|title=PBS Online: Only A Teacher: Schoolhouse Pioneers|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. By 1844 the defects of the new method became so apparent to [[Boston]] schoolmasters that they issued an attack against it urging a return to an intensive, systematic phonics&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/onlyateacher/horace.html|title=PBS Online: Only A Teacher: Schoolhouse Pioneers|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The history of the RecycleBot was largely derived from the work on the RepRap Wiki under [[GNU Free Documentation License]]1.2.&lt;ref&gt;http://reprap.org/wiki/Recyclebot&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recyclebot was developed by students at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://hackaday.com/2010/08/05/recyclebot-digests-milk-jugs-to-feed-makerbot/ |title=Recyclebot digests milk jugs to feed MakerBot  |last1=Burgess |first1=Phil |date=5 August 2010 |website=hackaday.com/ |publisher=hackaday |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shapeways.com/blog/archives/536-recyclebot-greening-the-makerbot.html |title=RecycleBot: Greening the MakerBot |last1=Duann |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=3 August 2010 |website=The Shapeways Blog |publisher=shapeways |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.makerbot.com/blog/2010/08/03/recyclebot-makes-hdpe-for-your-makerbot-from-milk-jugs |title=Recyclebot makes HDPE for your MakerBot from Milk Jugs! |last1=Pettis |first1=Bre |last2= |first2= |date=3 August 2010 |website=makerbot.com blog |publisher=makerbot |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This design was a proof of concept and was a hand-powered design, which thus had a good environmental or [[ecological footprint]], but did not create filament of high enough quality to be useful for [[3D printers]].

'''Responsible government''' is a conception of a [[system of government]] that embodies the principle of parliamentary accountability, the foundation of the [[Westminster system]] of [[parliamentary democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=28 July 2005|accessdate=14 December 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213045132/http://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/SARC/E-Democracy/Final_Report/Glossary.htm|archivedate=13 December 2007|url=http://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/SARC/E-Democracy/Final_Report/Glossary.htm|title=Victorian Electronic Democracy, Final Report – Glossary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governments (the equivalent of the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]]) in Westminster democracies are responsible to parliament rather than to the monarch, or, in a colonial context, to the imperial government, and in a republican context, to the president, either [[Presidential system|in full]] or [[Semi-presidential system|in part]]. If the parliament is [[bicameral]], then the government is responsible first to the parliament's [[lower house]], which is more representative than the [[upper house]], as it has more members and they are always [[Direct election|directly elected]].

Responsible government of parliamentary accountability manifests itself in several ways. [[Minister (government)|Ministers]] account to Parliament for their decisions and for the performance of their departments. This requirement to make announcements and to answer questions in Parliament means that ministers must have the privileges of the "floor", which are only granted to those who are members of either house of Parliament.{{clarify|date=May 2012}}  Secondly, and most importantly, although ministers are officially appointed by the authority of the [[head of state]] and can theoretically be dismissed at the pleasure of the sovereign, they concurrently retain their office subject to their holding the confidence of the lower house of Parliament. When the lower house has passed a [[motion of no confidence]] in the government, the government must immediately resign or submit itself to the electorate in a new general election.

Lastly, the head of state is in turn required to effectuate their executive power only through these responsible ministers. They must never attempt to set up a "shadow" government of executives or advisors and attempt to use them as instruments of government, or to rely upon their "unofficial" advice. They are bound to take no decision or action that is put into effect under the color of their executive power without that action being as a result of the counsel and advisement of their responsible ministers. Their ministers are required to counsel them (i.e., explain to them and be sure they understand any issue that they will be called upon to decide) and to form and have recommendations for them (i.e., their [[Advice (constitutional)|advice]] or advisement) to choose from, which are the ministers' formal, reasoned, recommendations as to what course of action should be taken.

An exception to this is [[Israel]], which operates under a simplified version of the [[Westminster system]].

== Canada ==
In the Canadian system, responsible government was developed between 1846 and 1850, with the executive Council formulating policy with the assistance of the legislative branch the legislature voted approval or disapproval, and the appointed governor enacted those policies that it had approved. It was a transition from the older system whereby the governor took advice from an executive Council, and use the legislature chiefly to raise money. &lt;ref&gt;Phillip A. Buckner, ''The Transition to Responsible Government: British Policy in British North America, 1815-1850'' (1985) ch. 4&lt;/ref&gt; After the formation of elected legislative assemblies starting with [[Nova Scotia House of Assembly| Nova Scotia]] in 1758, governors and their executive councils did not require the consent of elected legislators in order to carry out all their roles.  It was only in the decades leading up to [[Canadian Confederation]] in 1867 that the governing councils of those [[British North America]]n colonies became responsible to the elected representatives of the people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.parl.gc.ca/About/House/compendium/web-content/c_d_responsiblegovernmentministerialaccountability-e.htm | title = Responsible Government and Ministerial Responsibility | date = October 2015 | publisher = Parliament of Canada | access-date = 2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Responsible government was a major element of the gradual development of Canada towards independence. The concept of responsible government is associated in Canada more with [[self-governing colony|self-government]] than with parliamentary accountability; hence there is the notion that the [[Dominion of Newfoundland]] "gave up responsible government" when it suspended its self-governing status in 1933, as a result of financial problems. It did not regain responsible government until it became a [[province of Canada]] in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/politics/responsible-government-1855-to-1933.php | title = Responsible Government, 1855-1933 | date = 2016 | publisher = Newfoundland and Labrador Heritage Website | access-date = 2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the [[American Revolution]], the British government became more sensitive to unrest in its remaining colonies with large populations of European-descended colonists. Elected assemblies were introduced to both [[Upper Canada]] and [[Lower Canada]] with the [[Constitutional Act 1791| Constitutional Act of 1791]]. Many reformers thought that these assemblies should have some control over the executive power, leading to political unrest between the governors and assemblies in both Upper and Lower Canada. The [[Lieutenant Governor of Ontario|Lieutenant Governor]] of Upper Canada [[Sir Francis Bond Head]] wrote in one dispatch to London that if responsible government were implemented "Democracy, in the worst possible Form, will prevail in our Colonies." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |date=1839 |title= Despatches from Sir F.B. Head, relative to Canada, with Answers from Secretary of State|url=https://parlipapers.proquest.com/parlipapers/docview/t70.d75.1839-018414?accountid=12339 |location= |publisher= Parliament of the United Kingdom |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1837 [[Lower Canada Rebellion]] led by [[Louis-Joseph Papineau]], and the 1837–1838 [[Upper Canada Rebellion]] led by [[William Lyon Mackenzie]], [[John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham|Lord Durham]] was appointed governor general of [[British North America]] and had the task of examining the issues and determining how to defuse tensions. In [[Report on the Affairs of British North America (1839)|his report]], one of his recommendations was that colonies which were developed enough should be granted "responsible government". This term specifically meant the policy that British-appointed governors should bow to the will of elected colonial assemblies.

The first instance of responsible government in the [[British Empire]] outside of the United Kingdom itself was achieved by the colony of [[Nova Scotia]] in January–February 1848 through the efforts of [[Joseph Howe]]. The [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly erected by the [[Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada]] reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;First Responsible Government in the British Empire.&lt;br&gt;
The first [[Executive Council (Commonwealth countries)|Executive Council]] chosen exclusively from the party having a majority in the representative branch of a colonial legislature was formed in Nova Scotia on 2 February 1848. Following a vote of want of confidence in the preceding Council, [[James Boyle Uniacke]], who had moved the resolution, became Attorney General and leader of the Government. Joseph Howe, the long-time campaigner for this "Peaceable Revolution", became [[Provincial Secretary]]. Other members of the Council were Hugh Bell, Wm. F. Desbarres, Lawrence O.C. Doyle, Herbert Huntingdon, James McNab, Michael Tobin, and George R. Young.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The colony of [[New Brunswick]] soon followed in May 1848 when [[Lieutenant Governor of New Brunswick|Lieutenant Governor]] [[Edmund Walker Head]] brought in a more balanced representation of Members of the Legislative Assembly to the Executive Council and ceded more powers to that body.
[[File:Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine|Louis-Hippolyte LaFontaine]], Father of Responsible Government]]
[[File:RobertBaldwin23.jpg|thumbnail|[[Robert Baldwin]], Father of Responsible Government]]

In the [[Province of Canada]], responsible government was introduced with the ministry of [[Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine|Louis-Hippolyte LaFontaine]] and [[Robert Baldwin]] in spring 1848; it was put to the test in 1849, when Reformers in the legislature passed the [[Rebellion Losses Bill]]. This was a law that provided compensation to French-Canadians who suffered losses during the Rebellions of 1837–1838 in Lower-Canada. [[File:Young Canada Delighted with Responsible Government c092201-v8.jpg|thumb|Punch in Canada, February 3, 1849 by Frederick William Lock depicting "Young Canada" being "delighted" by Lord Elgin pulling the strings of “Responsible Government”]]
The Governor General, [[James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin|Lord Elgin]], had serious misgivings about the bill but nonetheless [[Royal Assent|assented]] to it despite demands from the [[Tories]] that he refuse to do so. Elgin was physically assaulted by an English-speaking mob for this, and the [[Montreal]] Parliament building was burned to the ground in the ensuing [[Montreal Riots|riots]]. Nonetheless, the Rebellion Losses Bill helped entrench responsible government into Canadian politics.

In time, the granting of responsible government became the first step on the road to complete independence. Canada gradually gained greater and greater autonomy over a considerable period of time through inter imperial and commonwealth diplomacy, including the [[British North America Act of 1867]], the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster of 1931]], and even as late as the patriation of the [[Constitution Act, 1982|Constitution Act in 1982]] (see [[Constitution of Canada]]).

== Australia and New Zealand ==

While the various colonies in Australia were either sparsely populated or penal settlements or both, executive power was in the hands of the Governors, who, because of the great distance from their superiors in London and the resulting very slow communication, necessarily exercised vast powers.
However, the early colonists, coming mostly from the United Kingdom, were familiar with the [[Westminster system]] and made efforts to reform it to increase the opportunity for ordinary men to participate.

The Governors and London therefore set in motion a gradual process of establishing a Westminster system in the colonies, not so fast as to get ahead of population or economic growth, nor so slow as to provoke clamouring for revolutionary change as happened in America. Initially, this took the form of appointed or partially elected Legislative Councils. Then, during the 1850s, all Australian colonies except Western Australia, along with New Zealand, established both representative and responsible government; Western Australia did the same in 1890.

== Cape Colony ==
[[File:1 John Molteno - 1st Prime Minister of the Cape - 1860s - Copy2.jpg|thumb|right|[[John Molteno]], Father of Responsible Government and first [[Prime Minister]] of the Cape.]]
[[File:John Molteno and Saul Solomon preside over Cape Government - Zingari cartoon 1873.jpg|thumb|right|Cartoon critical of responsible government, showing power and positions divided between various factions by Cape leaders, depicted as owls, [[John Charles Molteno|Molteno]] (to the right) and [[Saul Solomon]].]]
The [[British Cape Colony|Cape Colony]], in Southern Africa, was under responsible self-government from 1872 until 1910 when it became the [[Cape Province]] of the new [[Union of South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;A.L. Harrington: ''The Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope, with special reference to party politics 1872–1910''. Government Printer, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under its previous system of [[representative government]], the Ministers of the Cape Government reported directly to the [[British Cape Colony|British Imperial Governor]], and not to the locally elected representatives in the [[Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope|Cape Parliament]]. Among Cape citizens of all races, growing anger at their powerlessness in influencing unpopular imperial decisions had repeatedly led to protests and rowdy political meetings – especially during the early "Convict Crisis" of the 1840s.
A popular political movement for responsible government soon emerged, under local leader [[John Molteno]]. A protracted struggle was then conducted over the ensuing years as the movement (known informally as "the responsibles") grew increasingly powerful, and used their parliamentary majority to put pressure on the British Governor, withholding public finances from him, and conducting public agitations. Not everyone favoured responsible government though, and pro-imperial press outlets even accused the movement of constituting "crafts and assaults of the devil".&lt;ref&gt;''The Zingari''. 9 June 1871. p.94.&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters believed that the most effective means of instituting responsible government was simply to change the section of the constitution which prevented government officials from being elected to parliament or members of parliament from serving in executive positions. The conflict therefore centred on the changing of this specific section. "Although responsible government merely required an amendment to s.79 of the constitution, it transpired only after nearly twenty years in 1872 when the so-called "responsibles" under Molteno were able to command sufficient support in both houses to secure the passage of the necessary bill."&lt;ref&gt;GE Devenish (1978). ''Our legal heritage''. De Rebus Procuratoriis, p.486. University of the Western Cape.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, with a parliamentary majority and with the Colonial Office and new Governor [[Henry Barkly]] won over, Molteno instituted responsible government, making the Ministers directly responsible to the Cape Parliament, and becoming the Cape's first [[Prime Minister]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYoPkk04Yp4C&amp;pg=PA151&amp;lpg=PA151&amp;dq=john+charles+molteno+responsible+government#v=onepage&amp;q=john%20charles%20molteno%20responsible%20government&amp;f=false|title=African Historical Biographies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ensuing period saw an economic recovery, a massive growth in exports and an expansion of the colony's frontiers. Despite political complications that arose from time to time (such as an ill-fated scheme by the [[British Colonial Office]] to enforce a [[confederation]] in Southern Africa in 1878, and tensions with the [[Afrikaner]]-dominated [[South African Republic|Government of Transvaal]] over trade and railroad construction), economic and social progress in the [[British Cape Colony|Cape Colony]] continued at a steady pace until a renewed attempt to extend British control over the hinterland caused the outbreak of the [[Second Boer War|Anglo-Boer War]]s in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Lewsen: ''The First Crises in Responsible Government in the Cape Colony''. University of The Witwatersrand / Argief-jaarboek vir Suid-Afrikaanse geskiedenis. 1940/3.&lt;/ref&gt;

An important feature of the [[British Cape Colony|Cape Colony]] under responsible government was that it was the only state in southern Africa (and one of very few in the world at the time) to have a [[Cape Qualified Franchise|non-racial system of voting]].

''The Life and Times of John Charles Molteno. Comprising a History of Representative Institutions and Responsible Government at the Cape. Volume II''. London: Smith, Elder &amp; Co., Waterloo Place, 1900. p.214&lt;/ref&gt;
Later however – following the [[South Africa Act 1909]] to form the [[Union of South Africa]] – this [[universal suffrage|multi-racial universal suffrage]] was steadily eroded, and eventually abolished by the [[Apartheid]] government in 1948.

== In German history ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}
In the early 1860s, the [[Prussia]]n Prime Minister [[Otto von Bismarck]] was involved in a bitter dispute with the Liberals, who sought to institute a system of responsible government modeled on that of Britain. Bismarck, who strongly opposed that demand, managed to deflect the pressure by embarking energetically and successfully on the [[unification of Germany]]. The Liberals, who were also strong German nationalists, backed Bismarck's unification efforts and tacitly accepted that the Constitution of Imperial Germany, crafted by Bismarck, did not include a responsible government – the Chancellor being accountable solely to the emperor and needing no parliamentary confidence. Germany gained a responsible government only with the [[Weimar Republic]] and more securely with the creation of the [[German Federal Republic]]. Historians account the lack of responsible government in the formative decades of united Germany as one of the factors contributing to the prolonged weakness of German democratic institutions, lasting also after such a government was finally instituted.

A component of a tensor is a [[real number]] that is used as a coefficient of a basis element for the tensor space. The tensor is the sum of its components multiplied by their corresponding basis elements. Tensors and tensor fields can be expressed in terms of their components, and operations on tensors and tensor fields can be expressed in terms of operations on their components. The description of tensor fields and operations on them in terms of their components is the focus of the Ricci calculus. This notation allows an efficient expression of such tensor fields and operations. While much of the notation may be applied with any tensors, operations relating to a [[differential structure]] are only applicable to tensor fields.  Where needed, the notation extends to components of non-tensors, particularly [[multidimensional array]]s.

A tensor may be expressed as a linear sum of the [[tensor product]] of [[Vector (mathematics and physics)|vector]] and [[covector]] basis elements. The resulting tensor components are labelled by indices of the basis. Each index has one possible value per [[dimension]] of the underlying [[vector space]]. The number of indices equals the degree (or order) of the tensor.

For compactness and convenience, the notational convention implies summation over indices repeated within a term and [[universal quantification]] over free indices. Expressions in the notation of the Ricci calculus may generally be interpreted as a set of simultaneous equations relating the components as functions over a manifold, usually more specifically as functions of the coordinates on the manifold. This allows intuitive manipulation of expressions with familiarity of only a limited set of rules.

==Notation for indices==

{{see also|Index notation}}

===Basis-related distinctions===

====Space and time coordinates====

Where a distinction is to be made between the space-like basis elements and a time-like element in the four-dimensional spacetime of classical physics, this is conventionally done through indices as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=C. Møller|title=The Theory of Relativity|year=1952|page=234}} is an example of a variation: 'Greek indices run from 1 to 3, Latin indices from 1 to 4'&lt;/ref&gt;
*The lowercase [[Latin alphabet]] {{math|''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ...}} is used to indicate restriction to 3-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], which take values 1, 2, 3 for the spatial components; and the time-like element, indicated by 0, is shown separately.
*The lowercase [[Greek alphabet]] {{math|''α'', ''β'', ''γ'', ...}} is used for 4-dimensional [[spacetime]], which typically take values 0 for time components and 1, 2, 3 for the spatial components.

Some sources use 4 instead of 0 as the index value corresponding to time; in this article, 0 is used. Otherwise, in general mathematical contexts, any symbols can be used for the indices, generally running over all dimensions of the vector space.

====Coordinate and index notation====

The author(s) will usually make it clear whether a subscript is intended as an index or as a label.

For example, in 3-D Euclidean space and using [[Cartesian coordinates]]; the [[coordinate vector]] {{math|1='''A''' = (''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) = (''A''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;)}} shows a direct correspondence between the subscripts 1, 2, 3 and the labels {{math|x, y, z}}. In the expression {{math|''A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, {{math|''i''}} is interpreted as an index ranging over the values 1, 2, 3, while the {{math|x, y, z}} subscripts are not variable indices, more like "names" for the components. In the context of spacetime, the index value 0 conventionally corresponds to the label {{math|t}}.

====Reference to basis====

Indices themselves may be ''labelled'' using [[diacritic]]-like symbols, such as a [[Circumflex|hat]] (ˆ), [[Macron (diacritic)|bar]] (¯), [[tilde]] (˜), or prime (′) as in:

:&lt;math&gt;X_{\hat{\phi}}\,, Y_{\bar{\lambda}}\,, Z_{\tilde{\eta}}\,, T_{\mu'} &lt;/math&gt;

to denote a possibly different [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] for that index. An example is in [[Lorentz transformation]]s from one [[frame of reference]] to another, where one frame could be unprimed and the other primed, as in:
:&lt;math&gt; v^{\mu'} = v^{\nu}L_\nu{}^{\mu'} .&lt;/math&gt;

This is not to be confused with [[van der Waerden notation]] for [[spinor]]s, which uses hats and overdots on indices to reflect the chirality of a spinor.

===Upper and lower indices===

====[[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|Covariant tensor components]]====

A ''lower index'' (subscript) indicates covariance of the components with respect to that index:
:&lt;math&gt;A_{\alpha\beta\gamma \cdots}&lt;/math&gt;

====[[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|Contravariant tensor components]]====

An ''upper index'' (superscript) indicates contravariance of the components with respect to that index:
:&lt;math&gt;A^{\alpha\beta\gamma \cdots}&lt;/math&gt;

====[[Mixed tensor|Mixed-variance tensor components]]====

A tensor may have both upper and lower indices:
:&lt;math&gt;A_{\alpha}{}^{\beta}{}_{\gamma}{}^{\delta\cdots}.&lt;/math&gt;

Ordering of indices is significant, even when of differing variance.  However, when it is understood that no indices will be raised or lowered while retaining the base symbol, covariant indices are sometimes placed below contravariant indices for notational convenience (e.g. with the [[generalized Kronecker delta]]).

====Tensor type and degree====

The number of each upper and lower indices of a tensor gives its ''type'': a tensor with {{math|''p''}} upper and {{math|''q''}} lower indices is said to be of type {{math|(''p'', ''q'')}}, or to be a type-{{math|(''p'', ''q'')}} tensor.

The number of indices of a tensor, regardless of variance, is called the ''degree'' of the tensor (alternatively, its ''valence'', ''order'' or ''rank'', although ''rank'' is ambiguous).  Thus, a tensor of type {{math|(''p'', ''q'')}} has degree {{math|''p'' + ''q''}}.

====[[Summation convention]]====

The same symbol occurring twice (one upper and one lower) within a term indicates a pair of indices that are summed over:

:&lt;math&gt; A_\alpha B^\alpha \equiv \sum_\alpha A_{\alpha}B^\alpha \quad \text{or} \quad A^\alpha B_\alpha \equiv \sum_\alpha A^{\alpha}B_\alpha \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The operation implied by such a summation is called [[tensor contraction]]:

:&lt;math&gt; A_\alpha B^\beta \rightarrow A_\alpha B^\alpha \equiv \sum_\alpha A_{\alpha}B^\alpha \,.&lt;/math&gt;

This summation may occur more than once within a term with a distinct symbol per pair of indices, for example:

:&lt;math&gt; A_{\alpha}{}^\gamma B^\alpha C_\gamma{}^\beta \equiv \sum_\alpha \sum_\gamma A_{\alpha}{}^\gamma B^\alpha C_\gamma{}^\beta \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Other combinations of repeated indices within a term are considered to be ill-formed, such as

:&lt;math&gt; A_{\alpha\alpha}{}^{\gamma} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; A_{\alpha\gamma}{}^{\gamma} B^\alpha C_{\gamma}{}^{\beta} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

since they are meaningless: they do not transform as tensors under a change of basis.

====[[Multi-index notation]]====

If a tensor has a list of all upper or lower indices, one shorthand is to use a capital letter for the list:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=T. Frankel|page=67| title = The Geometry of Physics| publisher=Cambridge University Press|edition=3rd|year=2012|isbn=978-1107-602601}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; A_{i_1 \cdots i_n}B^{i_1 \cdots i_n j_1 \cdots j_m}C_{j_1 \cdots j_m} \equiv A_I B^{IJ} C_J &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|1=''I'' = ''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''i''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ⋅⋅⋅ ''i&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|1=''J'' = ''j''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''j''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ⋅⋅⋅ ''j&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.

====Sequential summation====

A pair of vertical bars {{math|{{!}} {{!}}}} around a set of all-upper indices or all-lower indices, associated with contraction with another set of indices:&lt;ref&gt;Gravitation, J.A. Wheeler, C. Misner, K.S. Thorne, W.H. Freeman &amp; Co, 1973, p.&amp;nbsp;91, {{isbn|0-7167-0344-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
  A_{|\alpha \beta \gamma| \cdots} B^{\alpha\beta\gamma \cdots} =
  A_{\alpha \beta \gamma \cdots} B^{|\alpha\beta\gamma| \cdots} =
  \sum_{\alpha &lt; \beta &lt; \gamma} A_{\alpha \beta \gamma \cdots} B^{\alpha\beta\gamma \cdots}
&lt;/math&gt;

means a restricted sum over index values, where each index is constrained to being strictly less than the next. The vertical bars are placed around either the upper set or the lower set of contracted indices, not both sets. Normally when contracting indices, the sum is over all values. In this notation, the summations are restricted as a computational convenience. This is useful when the expression is [[antisymmetric tensor|completely antisymmetric]] in each of the two sets of indices, as might occur on the tensor product of a {{math|''p''}}-vector with a {{math|''q''}}-form. More than one group can be summed in this way, for example:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
      &amp;A_{|\alpha \beta\gamma|}{}^{|\delta\epsilon\cdots\lambda|}
         B^{\alpha \beta\gamma}{}_{\delta\epsilon\cdots\lambda|\mu \nu \cdots\zeta|}
         C^{\mu\nu\cdots \zeta} \\[3pt]
  ={} &amp;\sum_{\alpha &lt; \beta &lt; \gamma}~\sum_{\delta &lt; \epsilon &lt; \cdots &lt; \lambda}~\sum_{\mu &lt; \nu &lt; \cdots &lt; \zeta}
         A_{\alpha \beta\gamma}{}^{\delta\epsilon\cdots\lambda}
         B^{\alpha \beta\gamma}{}_{\delta\epsilon\cdots\lambda\mu \nu\cdots\zeta}
         C^{\mu\nu\cdots\zeta}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

When using multi-index notation, an underarrow is placed underneath the block of indices:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=T. Frankel| title = The Geometry of Physics|page=67| publisher=Cambridge University Press|edition=3rd|year=2012|isbn=978-1107-602601}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
  A_{\underset{\rightharpoondown}{P}}{}^{\underset{\rightharpoondown}{Q}} B^P{}_{Q\underset{\rightharpoondown}{R}} C^R =
  \sum_\underset{\rightharpoondown}{P} \sum_\underset{\rightharpoondown}{Q} \sum_\underset{\rightharpoondown}{R} A_{P}{}^{Q} B^P{}_{QR} C^R &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;
  \underset{\rightharpoondown}{P} = |\alpha \beta\gamma|\,,\quad
  \underset{\rightharpoondown}{Q} = |\delta\epsilon\cdots\lambda|\,,\quad
  \underset{\rightharpoondown}{R} = |\mu \nu \cdots\zeta|
&lt;/math&gt;

====[[Raising and lowering indices]]====

By contracting an index with a non-singular [[metric tensor]], the [[mixed tensor|type]] of a tensor can be changed, converting a lower index to an upper index or vice versa:
:&lt;math&gt;B^{\gamma}{}_{\beta\cdots} = g^{\gamma\alpha}A_{\alpha\beta\cdots} \quad \text{and} \quad A_{\alpha\beta\cdots} = g_{\alpha\gamma}B^{\gamma}{}_{\beta\cdots}&lt;/math&gt;

The base symbol in many cases is retained (e.g. using {{math|''A''}} where {{math|''B''}} appears here), and when there is no ambiguity, repositioning an index may be taken to imply this operation.

===Correlations between index positions and invariance===

This table summarizes how the manipulation of covariant and contravariant indices fit in with invariance under a [[passive transformation]] between bases, with the components of each basis set in terms of the other reflected in the first column. The barred indices refer to the final coordinate system after the transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |pages=61, 202–203, 232|author1=J.A. Wheeler |author2=C. Misner |author3=K.S. Thorne | title=[[Gravitation (book)|Gravitation]]| publisher=W.H. Freeman &amp; Co| year=1973 | isbn=0-7167-0344-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kronecker delta]] is used, [[#Notable tensors|see also below]].

==General outlines for index notation and operations==
Tensors are equal [[if and only if]] every corresponding component is equal; e.g., tensor {{math|''A''}} equals tensor {{math|''B''}} if and only if

:&lt;math&gt;A^{\alpha}{}_{\beta\gamma} = B^{\alpha}{}_{\beta\gamma}&lt;/math&gt;

for all {{math|''α'', ''β'', ''γ''}}. Consequently, there are facets of the notation that are useful in checking that an equation makes sense (an analogous procedure to [[dimensional analysis]]).

===[[Einstein notation#Introduction|Free and dummy indices]]===

Indices not involved in contractions are called ''free indices''. Indices used in contractions are termed ''dummy indices'', or ''summation indices''.

===A tensor equation represents many ordinary (real-valued) equations===

The components of tensors (like {{math|''A&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;''}}, {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;γ&lt;/sup&gt;''}} etc.) are just real numbers. Since the indices take various integer values to select specific components of the tensors, a single tensor equation represents many ordinary equations. If a tensor equality has {{math|''n''}} free indices, and if the dimensionality of the underlying vector space is {{math|''m''}}, the equality represents {{math|''m&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''}} equations: each index takes on every value of a specific set of values.

For instance, if

:&lt;math&gt;A^\alpha B_\beta{}^\gamma C_{\gamma\delta} + D^\alpha{}_\beta{} E_\delta = T^\alpha{}_\beta{}_\delta &lt;/math&gt;

is in [[Four-dimensional space|four dimensions]] (that is, each index runs from 0 to 3 or from 1 to 4), then because there are three free indices ({{math|''α'', ''β'', ''δ''}}), there are 4&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 64 equations. Three of these are:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  A^0 B_1{}^0 C_{00} + A^0 B_1{}^1 C_{10} + A^0 B_1{}^2 C_{20} + A^0 B_1{}^3 C_{30} + D^0{}_1{} E_0 &amp;= T^0{}_1{}_0 \\
  A^1 B_0{}^0 C_{00} + A^1 B_0{}^1 C_{10} + A^1 B_0{}^2 C_{20} + A^1 B_0{}^3 C_{30} + D^1{}_0{} E_0 &amp;= T^1{}_0{}_0 \\
  A^1 B_2{}^0 C_{02} + A^1 B_2{}^1 C_{12} + A^1 B_2{}^2 C_{22} + A^1 B_2{}^3 C_{32} + D^1{}_2{} E_2 &amp;= T^1{}_2{}_2.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This illustrates the compactness and efficiency of using index notation: many equations which all share a similar structure can be collected into one simple tensor equation.

===Indices are replaceable labels===

Replacing any index symbol throughout by another leaves the tensor equation unchanged (provided there is no conflict with other symbols already used). This can be useful when manipulating indices, such as using index notation to verify [[vector calculus identities]] or identities of the [[Kronecker delta]] and [[Levi-Civita symbol#Properties|Levi-Civita symbol]] (see also below). An example of a correct change is:

:&lt;math&gt;A^\alpha B_\beta{}^\gamma C_{\gamma\delta} + D^\alpha{}_\beta{} E_\delta \rightarrow A^\lambda B_\beta{}^\mu C_{\mu\delta} + D^\lambda{}_\beta{} E_\delta \,,&lt;/math&gt;

whereas an erroneous change is:

:&lt;math&gt;A^\alpha B_\beta{}^\gamma C_{\gamma\delta} + D^\alpha{}_\beta{} E_\delta \nrightarrow  A^\lambda B_\beta{}^\gamma C_{\mu\delta} + D^\alpha{}_\beta{} E_\delta \,.&lt;/math&gt;

In the first replacement, {{math|''λ''}} replaced {{math|''α''}} and {{math|''μ''}} replaced {{math|''γ''}} ''everywhere'', so the expression still has the same meaning. In the second, {{math|''λ''}} did not fully replace {{math|''α''}}, and {{math|''μ''}} did not fully replace {{math|''γ''}} (incidentally, the contraction on the {{math|''γ''}} index became a tensor product), which is entirely inconsistent for reasons shown next.

===Indices are the same in every term===

The same indices on each side of a tensor equation always appear in the same (upper or lower) position throughout every term, ''except'' for indices repeated in a term (which implies a summation over that index), for example:
:&lt;math&gt;A^\alpha B_\beta{}^\gamma C_{\gamma\delta} + D^\alpha{}_\beta{} E_\delta = T^\alpha{}_\beta{}_\delta &lt;/math&gt;

as for an erroneous expression:
:&lt;math&gt;A^\alpha B_\beta{}^\gamma C_{\gamma\delta} + D_\alpha{}_\beta{}^\gamma E^\delta. &lt;/math&gt;

In other words, non-repeated indices must be of the same type in every term of the equation. In the above identity, {{math|''α'', ''β'', ''δ''}} line up throughout and {{math|''γ''}} occurs twice in one term due to a contraction (once as an upper index and once as a lower index), and thus it is a valid expression. In the invalid expression, while {{math|''β''}} lines up, {{math|''α''}} and {{math|''δ''}} do not, and {{math|''γ''}} appears twice in one term (contraction) ''and'' once in another term, which is inconsistent.

===Brackets and punctuation used once where implied===

When applying a rule to a number of indices (differentiation, symmetrization etc., shown next), the bracket or punctuation symbols denoting the rules are only shown on one group of the indices to which they apply.

If the brackets enclose ''covariant indices'' – the rule applies only to ''all covariant indices enclosed in the brackets'', not to any contravariant indices which happen to be placed intermediately between the brackets.

Similarly if brackets enclose ''contravariant indices'' – the rule applies only to ''all enclosed contravariant indices'', not to intermediately placed covariant indices.

==Symmetric and antisymmetric parts==
===[[Symmetric tensor|Symmetric]] part of tensor===

[[Bracket#Parentheses ( )|Parentheses, (&amp;nbsp;)]], around multiple indices denotes the symmetrized part of the tensor. When symmetrizing {{math|''p''}} indices using {{math|''σ''}} to range over permutations of the numbers 1 to {{math|''p''}}, one takes a sum over the [[permutation]]s of those indices {{math|''α''&lt;sub&gt;''σ''(''i'')&lt;/sub&gt;}} for {{math|1=''i'' = 1, 2, 3, …, ''p''}}, and then divides by the number of permutations:

:&lt;math&gt;
  A_{(\alpha_1\alpha_2\cdots\alpha_p)\alpha_{p + 1}\cdots\alpha_q} =
  \dfrac{1}{p!} \sum_{\sigma} A_{\alpha_{\sigma(1)}\cdots\alpha_{\sigma(p)}\alpha_{p + 1}\cdots\alpha_{q}} \,.
&lt;/math&gt;

For example, two symmetrizing indices mean there are two indices to permute and sum over:

:&lt;math&gt;A_{(\alpha\beta)\gamma\cdots} = \dfrac{1}{2!} \left(A_{\alpha\beta\gamma\cdots} + A_{\beta\alpha\gamma\cdots} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

while for three symmetrizing indices, there are three indices to sum over and permute:

:&lt;math&gt;
  A_{(\alpha\beta\gamma)\delta\cdots} =
  \dfrac{1}{3!} \left(A_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta\cdots}
    + A_{\gamma\alpha\beta\delta\cdots} 
    + A_{\beta\gamma\alpha\delta\cdots} 
    + A_{\alpha\gamma\beta\delta\cdots}
    + A_{\gamma\beta\alpha\delta\cdots}
    + A_{\beta\alpha\gamma\delta\cdots}
  \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

The symmetrization is [[Distributive property|distributive]] over addition;

:&lt;math&gt;A_{(\alpha} \left(B_{\beta)\gamma\cdots} + C_{\beta)\gamma\cdots} \right) = A_{(\alpha}B_{\beta)\gamma\cdots} + A_{(\alpha}C_{\beta)\gamma\cdots}&lt;/math&gt;

Indices are not part of the symmetrization when they are:

*not on the same level, for example;
*:&lt;math&gt;A_{(\alpha}B^{\beta}{}_{\gamma)} = \dfrac{1}{2!} \left(A_{\alpha}B^{\beta}{}_{\gamma} + A_{\gamma}B^{\beta}{}_{\alpha} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
*within the parentheses and between vertical bars (i.e. |⋅⋅⋅|), modifying the previous example;
*:&lt;math&gt;A_{(\alpha}B_{|\beta|}{}_{\gamma)} = \dfrac{1}{2!} \left(A_{\alpha}B_{\beta \gamma} + A_{\gamma}B_{\beta \alpha} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Here the {{math|''α''}} and {{math|''γ''}} indices are symmetrized, {{math|''β''}} is not.

===[[Antisymmetric tensor|Antisymmetric]] or alternating part of tensor===

[[Bracket#Square brackets &amp;#91; &amp;#93;|Square brackets, &lt;nowiki&gt;[&amp;nbsp;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]], around multiple indices denotes the ''anti''symmetrized part of the tensor. For {{math|''p''}} antisymmetrizing indices – the sum over the permutations of those indices {{math|''α''&lt;sub&gt;''σ''(''i'')&lt;/sub&gt;}} multiplied by the [[signature (permutation)|signature of the permutation]] {{math|sgn(''σ'')}} is taken, then divided by the number of permutations:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
      &amp; A_{[\alpha_1\cdots\alpha_p]\alpha_{p+1}\cdots\alpha_q} \\[3pt]
  ={} &amp; \dfrac{1}{p!} \sum_{\sigma}\sgn(\sigma) A_{\alpha_{\sigma(1)}\cdots\alpha_{\sigma(p)}\alpha_{p+1}\cdots\alpha_{q}} \\
  ={} &amp; \delta_{\alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_p}^{\beta_1 \dots \beta_p} A_{\beta_1 \cdots \beta_p\alpha_{p+1}\cdots\alpha_q} \\
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''δ''{{su|b=''α''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;⋅⋅⋅''α&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''|p=''β''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;⋅⋅⋅''β&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''|lh=0.8em}}}} is the [[generalized Kronecker delta]] of degree {{math|2''p''}}, with scaling as defined below.

For example, two antisymmetrizing indices imply:

:&lt;math&gt;A_{[\alpha\beta]\gamma\cdots} = \dfrac{1}{2!} \left(A_{\alpha\beta\gamma\cdots} - A_{\beta\alpha\gamma\cdots} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

while three antisymmetrizing indices imply:

:&lt;math&gt;
  A_{[\alpha\beta\gamma]\delta\cdots} =
  \dfrac{1}{3!} \left(A_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta\cdots}
    + A_{\gamma\alpha\beta\delta\cdots} 
    + A_{\beta\gamma\alpha\delta\cdots} 
    - A_{\alpha\gamma\beta\delta\cdots}
    - A_{\gamma\beta\alpha\delta\cdots}
    - A_{\beta\alpha\gamma\delta\cdots}
  \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

as for a more specific example, if {{math|''F''}} represents the [[electromagnetic tensor]], then the equation

:&lt;math&gt;
  0 = F_{[\alpha\beta, \gamma]} = \dfrac{1}{3!} \left(
    F_{\alpha\beta,\gamma}
    + F_{\gamma\alpha,\beta}
    + F_{\beta\gamma,\alpha}
    - F_{\beta\alpha,\gamma}
    - F_{\alpha\gamma,\beta}
    - F_{\gamma\beta,\alpha}
  \right) \,
&lt;/math&gt;

represents [[Gauss's law for magnetism]] and [[Faraday's law of induction]].

As before, the antisymmetrization is distributive over addition;

:&lt;math&gt;
  A_{[\alpha} \left(B_{\beta]\gamma\cdots} + C_{\beta]\gamma\cdots} \right) =
  A_{[\alpha}B_{\beta]\gamma\cdots} + A_{[\alpha}C_{\beta]\gamma\cdots}
&lt;/math&gt;

As with symmetrization, indices are not antisymmetrized when they are:

*not on the same level, for example;
*:&lt;math&gt;
  A_{[\alpha}B^{\beta}{}_{\gamma]} =
  \dfrac{1}{2!} \left(A_{\alpha}B^{\beta}{}_{\gamma} - A_{\gamma}B^{\beta}{}_{\alpha} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;
*within the square brackets and between vertical bars (i.e. |⋅⋅⋅|), modifying the previous example;
*:&lt;math&gt;
  A_{[\alpha}B_{|\beta|}{}_{\gamma]} =
  \dfrac{1}{2!} \left(A_{\alpha}B_{\beta \gamma} - A_{\gamma}B_{\beta \alpha} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

Here the {{math|''α''}} and {{math|''γ''}} indices are antisymmetrized, {{math|''β''}} is not.

===Sum of symmetric and antisymmetric parts===

Any tensor can be written as the sum of its symmetric and antisymmetric parts on two indices:

:&lt;math&gt;A_{\alpha\beta\gamma\cdots} = A_{(\alpha\beta)\gamma\cdots}+A_{[\alpha\beta]\gamma\cdots}&lt;/math&gt;

as can be seen by adding the above expressions for {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;(''αβ'')''γ''⋅⋅⋅&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;[''αβ'']''γ''⋅⋅⋅&lt;/sub&gt;}}. This does not hold for other than two indices.

==Differentiation==

{{see also|Four-gradient|d'Alembertian|Intrinsic derivative}}

For compactness, derivatives may be indicated by adding indices after a comma or semicolon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=G. Woan| title=The Cambridge Handbook of Physics Formulas| publisher=Cambridge University Press| year=2010 | isbn=978-0-521-57507-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CovariantDerivative.html Covariant derivative] – Mathworld, Wolfram&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Partial derivative]]===

While most of the expressions of the Ricci calculus are valid for arbitrary bases, the expressions involving partial derivatives of tensor coordinated apply only with a [[coordinate basis]]: a basis that is defined through differentiation of the coordinates.  Coordinates are typically denoted by {{math|''x''{{isup|''μ''}}}}, but do not in general form the components of a vector.  In flat spacetime with linear coordinatization, a tuple of ''differences'' in coordinates, {{math|Δ''x''{{isup|''μ''}}}}, can be treated as a contravariant vector.  With the same constraints on the space and on the choice of coordinate system, the partial derivatives with respect to the coordinates yield a result that is effectively covariant.  Aside from use in this special case, the partial derivatives of components of tensors are useful in building expressions that are covariant, albeit still with a coordinate basis if the partial derivatives are explicitly used, as with the covariant and Lie derivatives below.

To indicate partial differentiation of the components of a tensor field with respect to a coordinate variable {{math|''x''{{isup|''γ''}}}}, a ''[[comma]]'' is placed before an appended lower index of the coordinate variable.

:&lt;math&gt;A_{\alpha\beta\cdots,\gamma} = \dfrac{\partial}{\partial x^\gamma} A_{\alpha\beta\cdots}&lt;/math&gt;

This may be repeated (without adding further commas):

:&lt;math&gt;
  A_{\alpha_1\alpha_2\cdots\alpha_p\,,\,\alpha_{p+1}\cdots\alpha_q} =
  \dfrac{\partial^{q-p}}{\partial x^{\alpha_q}\cdots\partial x^{\alpha_{p+2}}\partial x^{\alpha_{p+1}}} A_{\alpha_1\alpha_2\cdots\alpha_p}.
&lt;/math&gt;

These components do ''not'' transform covariantly, unless the expression being differentiated is a scalar. This derivative is characterized by the [[product rule]] and the derivatives of the coordinates

:&lt;math&gt;x^{\alpha}{}_{, \gamma} = \delta^{\alpha}{}_\gamma ,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''δ''}} is the [[Kronecker delta]].

===[[Covariant derivative]]===

To indicate covariant differentiation of any tensor field, a ''[[semicolon]]'' ({{math| ; }}) is placed before an appended lower (covariant) index. Less common alternatives to the semicolon include a ''[[Slash (punctuation)|forward slash]]'' ({{math| / }})&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=T. Frankel|page=298| title = The Geometry of Physics| publisher=Cambridge University Press|edition=3rd|year=2012|isbn=978-1107-602601}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in three-dimensional curved space a single vertical bar ({{math|&amp;nbsp;{{!}}&amp;nbsp;}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |pages=510, §21.5|author1=J.A. Wheeler |author2=C. Misner |author3=K.S. Thorne | title=[[Gravitation (book)|Gravitation]]| publisher=W.H. Freeman &amp; Co| year=1973 | isbn=0-7167-0344-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a contravariant vector, its covariant derivative is:
:&lt;math&gt;A^{\alpha}{}_{;\beta} = A^{\alpha}{}_{,\beta} + \Gamma^{\alpha} {}_{\gamma\beta}A^\gamma&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|Γ''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;βγ&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is a [[Christoffel symbol]] of the second kind.

For a covariant vector, its covariant derivative is:
:&lt;math&gt;A_{\alpha ;\beta} = A_{\alpha,\beta} - \Gamma^{\gamma} {}_{\alpha\beta}A_\gamma \,.&lt;/math&gt;

For an arbitrary tensor:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=T. Frankel|page=299| title = The Geometry of Physics| publisher=Cambridge University Press|edition=3rd|year=2012|isbn=978-1107-602601}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
    T^{\alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_r}{}_{\beta_1 \cdots \beta_s ; \gamma}
      &amp; \\
  = T^{\alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_r}{}_{\beta_1 \cdots \beta_s , \gamma}
      &amp;+ \, \Gamma^{\alpha_1}{}_{\delta \gamma} T^{\delta \alpha_2 \cdots \alpha_r}{}_{\beta_1 \cdots \beta_s} + \cdots + \Gamma^{\alpha_r}{}_{\delta \gamma} T^{\alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_{r-1} \delta}{}_{\beta_1 \cdots \beta_s} \\
      &amp;- \, \Gamma^\delta{}_{\beta_1 \gamma} T^{\alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_r}{}_{\delta \beta_2 \cdots \beta_s} - \cdots - \Gamma^\delta{}_{\beta_s \gamma} T^{\alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_r}{}_{\beta_1 \cdots \beta_{s-1} \delta}\,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The components of this derivative of a tensor field transform covariantly, and hence form another tensor field. This derivative is characterized by the product rule and applied to the metric tensor {{math|''g&lt;sub&gt;μν&lt;/sub&gt;''}} it gives zero:

:&lt;math&gt;g_{\mu \nu ; \gamma} = 0 \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The covariant formulation of the [[directional derivative]] of any tensor field along a vector {{math|''v&lt;sup&gt;γ&lt;/sup&gt;''}} may be expressed as its contraction with the covariant derivative, e.g.:

:&lt;math&gt;v^\gamma A_{\alpha ;\gamma} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

One alternative notation for the covariant derivative of any tensor is the subscripted nabla symbol {{math|∇&lt;sub&gt;''β''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. For the case of a vector field {{math|''A&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;''}}:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Relativity|series=Demystified|isbn=0-07-145545-0|year=2006|author=D.

===[[Lie derivative]]===

The Lie derivative is another derivative that is covariant, but which should not be confused with the ''covariant derivative''. It is defined even in the absence of a metric tensor.  The Lie derivative of a type {{math|(''r'', ''s'')}} tensor field {{math|''T''}} along (the flow of) a contravariant vector field {{math|''X''{{isup|''ρ''}}}} [[Lie derivative#Coordinate expressions|may be expressed as]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1=Bishop|first1=R.L.|last2=Goldberg|first2=S.I.| year=1968| title = Tensor Analysis on Manifolds|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This derivative is characterized by the product rule and the fact that the derivative of the given contravariant vector field {{math|''X''{{isup|''ρ''}}}} is zero.

    &amp; + \, wX^{\gamma}{}_{, \gamma} \Lambda^{\alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_r}{}_{\beta_1 \cdots \beta_{s}}\,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==Notable tensors==
===[[Kronecker delta]]===
The Kronecker delta is like the [[identity matrix]]
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \delta^{\alpha}_{\beta} \, A^{\beta} &amp;= A^{\alpha} \\
         \delta^{\mu}_{\nu} \, B_{\mu} &amp;= B_{\nu} \,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

when multiplied and contracted. The components {{math|''δ''{{su|b=''β''|p=''α''|lh=1em}}}} are the same in any basis and form an invariant tensor of type {{nowrap|(1, 1)}}, i.e. the identity of the [[tangent bundle]] over the [[identity mapping]] of the [[base manifold]], and so its trace is an invariant.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1=Bishop|first1=R.L.|last2=Goldberg|first2=S.I.| year=1968| title = Tensor Analysis on Manifolds|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Its [[Trace (linear algebra)|trace]] is the dimensionality of the space; for example, in four-dimensional [[spacetime]],
:&lt;math&gt;\delta^{\rho}_{\rho} = \delta^{0}_{0} + \delta^{1}_{1} + \delta^{2}_{2} + \delta^{3}_{3} = 4 .&lt;/math&gt;

The Kronecker delta is one of the family of generalized Kronecker deltas.  The generalized Kronecker delta of degree {{math|2''p''}} may be defined in terms of the Kronecker delta by (a common definition includes an additional multiplier of {{math|''p''!}} on the right):
:&lt;math&gt;\delta^{\alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_p}_{\beta_1 \cdots \beta_p} = \delta^{[\alpha_1}_{\beta_1} \cdots \delta^{\alpha_p]}_{\beta_p}&lt;/math&gt;
and acts as an antisymmetrizer on {{math|''p''}} indices:
:&lt;math&gt;\delta^{\alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_p}_{\beta_1 \cdots \beta_p} \, A^{\beta_1 \cdots \beta_p} = A^{[\alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_p]} .&lt;/math&gt;

===[[Metric tensor]]===

The metric tensor {{math|''g''{{sub|''αβ''}}}} is used for lowering indices and gives the length of any [[space-like]] curve
:&lt;math&gt;\text{length} = \int^{y_2}_{y_1} \sqrt{ g_{\alpha \beta} \frac{d x^{\alpha}}{d y} \frac{d x^{\beta}}{d y} } \, d y \,,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''y''}} is any [[Smooth function|smooth]] [[Monotonic function|strictly monotone]] [[parameterization]] of the path. It also gives the duration of any [[time-like]] curve
:&lt;math&gt;\text{duration} = \int^{t_2}_{t_1} \sqrt{ \frac{-1}{c^2} g_{\alpha \beta} \frac{d x^{\alpha}}{d t} \frac{d x^{\beta}}{d t} } \, d t \,,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''t''}} is any smooth strictly monotone parameterization of the trajectory. See also [[line element]].

The [[inverse matrix]] {{math|''g''{{sup|''αβ''}}}} of the metric tensor is another important tensor, used for raising indices:
:&lt;math&gt; g^{\alpha \beta} g_{\beta \gamma} = \delta^{\alpha}_{\gamma} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

===[[Riemann curvature tensor]]===

If this tensor is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;R^\rho{}_{\sigma\mu\nu} = \Gamma^\rho{}_{\nu\sigma,\mu}
    - \Gamma^\rho{}_{\mu\sigma,\nu}
    + \Gamma^\rho{}_{\mu\lambda}\Gamma^\lambda{}_{\nu\sigma}
    - \Gamma^\rho{}_{\nu\lambda}\Gamma^\lambda{}_{\mu\sigma} \,,
&lt;/math&gt;

then it is the [[commutator]] of the covariant derivative with itself:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Synge J.L. |author2=Schild A. |publisher=first Dover Publications 1978 edition |title=Tensor Calculus |pages=83, p. 107|year= 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=P. A. M. Dirac|pages=20–21| title=General Theory of Relativity| publisher= | isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A_{\nu ; \rho \sigma} - A_{\nu ; \sigma \rho} = A_{\beta} R^{\beta}{}_{\nu \rho \sigma} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

since the [[Connection (mathematics)|connection]] {{math|Γ''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;βμ&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is torsionless, which means that the [[torsion tensor]]
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma^\lambda{}_{\mu\nu} - \Gamma^\lambda{}_{\nu\mu}\,&lt;/math&gt;
vanishes.

This can be generalized to get the commutator for two covariant derivatives of an arbitrary tensor as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
     &amp;T^{\alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_r}{}_{\beta_1 \cdots \beta_s ; \gamma \delta}
    - T^{\alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_r}{}_{\beta_1 \cdots \beta_s ; \delta \gamma} \\
  = - &amp;R^{\alpha_1}{}_{\rho \gamma \delta} T^{\rho \alpha_2 \cdots \alpha_r}{}_{\beta_1 \cdots \beta_s}
    - \cdots
    - R^{\alpha_r}{}_{\rho \gamma \delta} T^{\alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_{r-1} \rho}{}_{\beta_1 \cdots \beta_s} \\
  {}+{} &amp;R^\sigma{}_{\beta_1 \gamma \delta} T^{\alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_r}{}_{\sigma \beta_2 \cdots \beta_s}
    + \cdots
    + R^\sigma{}_{\beta_s \gamma \delta} T^{\alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_r}{}_{\beta_1 \cdots \beta_{s-1} \sigma} \,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
which are often referred to as the ''Ricci identities''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Lovelock| first = David|author2=Hanno Rund | year=  1989|title = Tensors, Differential Forms, and Variational Principles|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:French-roundel.svg|thumb|right|The [[Flag of France|''Tricolore'']] cockade of the [[French Air Force]] was first used on military aircraft before the First World War&lt;ref name="rafmu"/&gt;]]

A '''roundel''' is a circular disc used as a symbol. The term is used in [[heraldry]], but also commonly used to refer to a type of [[nation]]al insignia used on [[military aircraft]], generally circular in shape and usually comprising concentric rings of different colours. Other symbols also often use round shapes.

==Heraldry==
{{Main|Roundel (heraldry)}}
In [[heraldry]], a ''roundel'' is a circular [[charge (heraldry)|charge]].  ''Roundels'' are among the oldest charges used in [[coat of arms|coats of arms]], dating from at least the twelfth century. Roundels in British heraldry have different names depending on their [[tincture (heraldry)|tincture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Fox-Davies | first= Arthur Charles | year=1909 | title=A Complete Guide to Heraldry | page=151 |url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41617/41617-h/41617-h.htm#page151|publisher = Gutenberg.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, while a roundel may be [[blazon]]ed by its tincture, e.g., ''a roundel vert'' (literally "a roundel green"), it is more often described by a single word, in this case ''pomme'' (literally "apple", from the French) or, from the same origins, ''pomeis''—as in "Vert; on a cross Or five pomeis".&lt;ref&gt;Scottish Public Register vol. 32, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

One special example of a named roundel is the [[fountain (heraldry)|fountain]], depicted as ''a roundel barry wavy argent and azure'', that is, containing alternating horizontal wavy bands of blue and silver (or white).

==Military aircraft==
{{Main|Military aircraft insignia}}
[[File:Hurricane.r4118.ground.arp.jpg|thumb|[[Hawker Hurricane]] showing a [[Second World War]]-era [[Royal Air Force roundels|Royal Air Force roundel]]]]

The [[History of the Armée de l'Air (1909–1942)|French Air Service]] originated the use of roundels on military aircraft during the [[World War I|First World War]].&lt;ref name="rafmu"/&gt; The chosen design was the French national [[Cockade#Cockades of the European military|cockade]], whose colours are the blue-white-red of the [[flag of France]]. Similar national cockades, with different ordering of colours, were designed and adopted as aircraft roundels by their allies, including the British [[Royal Flying Corps]] and the [[United States Army Air Service]]. After the First World War, many other [[air force]]s adopted roundel insignia, distinguished by different colours or numbers of concentric rings.

The term "roundel" is often used even for those military aircraft insignia that are not round, like the [[Cross pattee|Iron Cross]]-[[Balkenkreuz]] symbol of the [[German Air Force|Luftwaffe]] or the [[red star]] of the [[Russian Air Force]].{{citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Flags==
Among flags which display a roundel are the [[flag of Bangladesh]] and the [[flag of Japan]].

Flags for British overseas dependencies are often a British [[Blue Ensign]] [[defacement (flag)|defaced]] with a white roundel displaying the [[coat of arms|arms]] or [[heraldic badge|badge]] of the dependency. The same pattern is used for all the states of Australia except [[Flag of Victoria|Victoria]].

==In popular culture==
[[File:Mod symbol.svg|thumbnail|right|140px|[[The Who]] logo incorporates the roundel symbol used by [[Mod (subculture)|mods]]]]

* The roundel, especially that used by the [[Royal Air Force]], has been associated with [[pop art]] of the 1960s, appearing in paintings by [[Jasper Johns]]. It became part of the pop consciousness when British rock group [[The Who]] wore [[Royal Air Force roundels|RAF roundels]] (and [[Union Flag]]s) as part of their stage apparel at the start of their career. Subsequently it came to symbolise [[Mod (subculture)|Mods]] and the [[Mod revival]].
* Some of [[Paul Weller (singer)|Paul Weller]]'s material involves the use of a roundel in psychedelic colours.
* [[Ben Harper]]'s album ''[[Fight For Your Mind]]'' uses roundels from several air forces as graphics in the liner notes.
* In the British television series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', the circular decorations on the interior walls of the [[TARDIS]] control room are known as roundels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Russell | first=Gary | year=2006 | title=Doctor Who: The Inside Story | location=London | publisher=BBC Books | page=86 |isbn=0-563-48649-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Self-affirmation''' theory is a [[psychology|psychological]] theory that focuses on how individuals adapt to information or experiences that are threatening to their [[self-concept]]. [[Claude Steele]] originally popularized self-affirmation theory in the late 1980s,&lt;ref name="Steele 1988"&gt;Steele, C. M. (1988). The psychology of self-affirmation: Sustaining the integrity of the self. Advances in experimental social psychology, 21, 261-302&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohen 2007"&gt;Cohen, G. L., &amp; Sherman, D. K. (2007). Self-affirmation theory. In R. Baumeister and K. Vohs (Eds.), Encyclopedia of Social Psychology (pp. 787-789). Thousand Oakes: Sage Publications&lt;/ref&gt; and it remains a well-studied theory in [[Social psychology|social psychological]] research.&lt;ref name="Sherman 2006"&gt;Sherman, D. K., &amp; Cohen, G. L. (2006). The psychology of self-defense: Self-affirmation theory. In M. P. Zanna (Ed.) Advances in experimental social psychology, 38, pp. 183-242. New York, NY: Guildford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McQueen 2006"&gt;McQueen, A., &amp; Klein, W. M. (2006). Experimental manipulations of self-affirmation: A systematic review. Self and Identity, 5(4), 289-354&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-affirmation theory contends that if individuals reflect on values that are personally relevant to them, they are less likely to experience distress and react defensively when confronted with information that contradicts or threatens their sense of self.

Experimental investigations of self-affirmation theory suggest that self-affirmation can help individuals cope with threat or stress and that it might be beneficial for improving academic performance, health, and reducing defensiveness.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2014"&gt;Cohen, G. L., &amp; Sherman, D. K. (2014). The psychology of change: Self-affirmation and social psychological intervention. Annual Review of Psychology, 65, 333-371&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
There are four main principles of self-affirmation theory.

===People try to protect their self-integrity===
Self-affirmation theory proposes that individuals are driven to protect their self-integrity.&lt;ref name="Sherman 2006"/&gt; According to self-affirmation theory, self-integrity is one's concept of oneself as a good, moral person, who acts in ways that are in accord with cultural and social norms. Steele purported that the self is made up of different domains: roles, values, and belief systems.&lt;ref name="Steele 1988"/&gt; Roles include responsibilities a person has, such as being a parent, friend, student, or professional. Values are aspirations people live in accordance to, including things like living healthfully and treating others with respect. Belief systems include the ideologies to which a person ascribes, such as religious or political beliefs. Self-integrity can take many forms.&lt;ref name="Sherman 2006"/&gt; For example, self-integrity can take the form of being independent, intelligent, a helpful member of a society, part of a family, and/or part of a group. Threats against a person's self-integrity are events or messages that imply an individual is not good or adequate in a personally relevant domain. Self-affirmation theory suggests that when individuals face threat to one of these domains, they are motivated to maintain a positive global image of themselves.

===Drives to protect the sense of self are often defensive===
Self-affirmation theory purports that when individuals are faced with information that threatens their self-integrity, the response to this information is often defensive in nature.&lt;ref name="Steele 1988"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherman 2006"/&gt;  Defensive reactions attempt to minimize the threat in order to preserve the sense of self. Examples of defensive reactions include denial, avoiding the threat, and changing one's appraisal of the event in order to make it less threatening.

===Self-integrity is flexible===
Instead of having one self-concept (e.g., I am a good parent), self-affirmation theory posits that individuals flexibly define who they are using various roles (e.g., I am a good parent, child, and worker).  Having a flexible sense of self allows individual to offset weaknesses in one domain, by highlighting the strengths in another domain.&lt;ref name="Sherman 2006"/&gt; That is, if someone perceives threat to one domain, he or she can accommodate this threat by upholding a value in another domain. Self-affirmations can come from many sources. Having a flexible self-concept allows people to adapt in the face of threat.

===Actions that promote one's values can reduce perceived threat===
It is theorized that engaging in activities that promote the values, beliefs, and roles that are central to an individual's identity can promote self-integrity.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2007"/&gt; Promoting one's values can affirm the individual and reduce the perceived threat. Engaging in such actions when facing threat serves to remind individuals of the broad, principal values by which they define themselves and their lives.&lt;ref name="Sherman 2006"/&gt; This change in perspective shifts attention away from the threat in one domain of the self toward a larger context of who they are. It is thought that when people operate from this broader perspective, they  react less defensively to the threat, which allows them to act more effectively.&lt;ref name="Sherman 2006"/&gt; Self-Affirmations can occur by both reflecting on a personally relevant value, belief, or role, as well as engaging in an activity that might evoke a personally relevant value, such as spending time with family if that is personally relevant.

Taken together, the four principles suggest that when confronted with information that threatens  self-concept, the person experiences distress and is subsequently motivated to self-defense. However, the defensive reaction can impede more adaptive ways to solve the problem (like engaging in problem-solving or changing unhealthy behaviors). It is thought that affirming an important value unrelated to the threat helps individuals to shift their perspective to their broader life context. Having a broad viewpoint diminishes the perceived threat, allowing individuals to act less defensively and more effectively.

==Paradigms used to study self-affirmation theory==
In laboratory experiments, psychologists induce self-affirmation in participants in order to investigate the influence of self-affirmation on individuals' well-being. There are two chief methods used to self-affirm  participants in experimental studies.&lt;ref name="McQueen 2006"/&gt;

===Values Essay===
One of the most common ways to induce self-affirmation is to have participants write about a personally relevant value.&lt;ref name="McQueen 2006"/&gt; In order to do this, participants rank a list of values from most important to least important to them. The list typically includes the following value domains, business, art/music/theater, social life/relationships, science/pursuit of knowledge, religion/morality, and government/politics. Participants then write about the value they ranked as most important and how it is meaningful to them for 10 minutes.

===Values List===
The Allport-Vernon-Lindzey Values Scale &lt;ref&gt;Allport, G. W., Vernon, P. E., &amp; Lindzey, G. E. (1960). Study of values: A scale for measuring the dominant interests in personality. Houghton Mifflin&lt;/ref&gt; is another measures that is administered to participants to induce self-affirmation in the laboratory.&lt;ref name="McQueen 2006"/&gt; Participants choose one of two answers after reading a statement about a value. An example item from the religion scale would be “The more important study for mankind is (a) mathematics (b) theology”.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, R. A. (1968). The interpretation of the religious scale of the Allport-Vernon-Lindzey study of values. Journal for the scientific study of religion, 65-77&lt;/ref&gt; This allows researchers to see where an individual's personal interests and values lie. It is thought that answering questions about a value domain that they find important will make that value more salient to them, resulting in self-affirmation.&lt;ref name="McQueen 2006"/&gt; There are six different value domains on the Allport-Vernon-Lindzey Values scale:  religion, theoretical, aesthetic, political, social, and economic.

==Empirical Support==
Extant empirical research demonstrates that self-affirmations can be beneficial in reducing individuals' [[Fight-or-flight response|stress response]] as well as their defensiveness toward threats.

===Self-affirmation buffering against stress===
In one study investigating the effects of self-affirmation on [[Flight-or-flight response|stress response]], undergraduate participants completed the [[Trier Social Stress Test]], a standardized laboratory paradigm used to induce stress in participants. In the Trier Social Stress task, participants are asked to give a short speech in front of a panel of judges who do not give any comments or positive feedback to the participant. Following the speech, participants must complete a mental arithmetic task, in which they count backwards from 2,083 in increments of 13 while being told by the judges to go faster. Prior to completing the Trier Social Stress Task, half of the participants completed a variation of values list self-affirmation task. Participants who completed the values list had significantly lower stress response than individuals in the control condition, as indicated by a lower [[cortisol]] response in affirmed participants compared to participants who did not complete the self-affirmation condition.&lt;ref&gt;Creswell, J. D., Welch, W. T., Taylor, S. E., Sherman, D. K., Gruenewald, T. L., &amp; Mann, T. (2005). Affirmation of personal values buffers neuroendocrine and psychological stress responses. Psychological Science, 16(11), 846-851&lt;/ref&gt;

In a different experiment, undergraduate students completed difficult problem solving puzzles in the presence of an evaluator. Participants also reported how much chronic stress they endured over the past month. Prior to completing the problem-solving puzzles half of the participants completed a values essay self-affirmation task. For the individuals who did not complete the self-affirmation task, low-stress participants performed significantly better than high-stress participants. For individuals in the self-affirmation condition, high-stress individuals performed equally as well as low-stress individuals. Findings suggest that self-affirmation buffered against the negative effects of stress on problem-solving performance.&lt;ref&gt;Creswell, J. D., Dutcher, J. M., Klein, W. M., Harris, P. R., &amp; Levine, J. M. (2013). Self-affirmation improves problem-solving under stress. PLoS ONE, 8(5), e62593&lt;/ref&gt;

For another experiment, undergraduates were recruited to participate in a research study two weeks prior to completing a mid-term exam. All participants collected urine samples for 24 hours two weeks prior to their midterm (baseline) as well as for the 24 hours prior to their midterm examination so levels their [[catecholamine]] levels could be measured. Catecholamine levels are thought to be high when individuals are experiencing higher stress.&lt;ref&gt;James, G. D., Crews, D. E., &amp; Pearson, J. (1989). Catecholamines and stress. Human population biology: a transdisciplinary science, 280-95&lt;/ref&gt; Half of participants completed two values essays in the two weeks leading up to their midterm examination. Participants who did not complete the self-affirmation condition demonstrated increased catecholamine response from baseline to their midterm exam. However, participants who completed the two values essays did not show an increase in catecholamine levels from baseline to their midterm.&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, D. K., Bunyan, D. P., Creswell, J. D., &amp; Jaremka, L. M. (2009). Psychological vulnerability and stress: the effects of self-affirmation on sympathetic nervous system responses to naturalistic stressors. Health Psychology, 28(5), 554&lt;/ref&gt;

Preliminary research results suggest that self-affirmation can protect against the negative consequences of stress.&lt;ref name="Cohen 2014"/&gt; More research is needed to understand ''how'' self-affirmations decrease stress responses.

===Self-affirmation reducing defensiveness===

Results from studies provide support for the idea that when individuals complete an activity that affirms their self-integrity they are less defensive and more accepting of information that is potentially threatening. However, more research is needed to better understand ''why'' people are more open-minded after they have completed an affirmation task.&lt;ref name="Sherman 2006"/&gt;

==Applications==

===Education===
Studies have examined the effects of self-affirmation on the academic performance of historically marginalized groups such as African American and Latino American students, who face a multitude of daily threats in the school environment.&lt;ref&gt;Steele CM. 2010. Whistling Vivaldi and Other Clues to How Stereotypes Affect Us. New York: Norton&lt;/ref&gt; Seventh grade students took part in a two-year study. Half of the students completed a values essay about their most important value approximately seven to eight times over the course of two academic years, while the other half wrote a values essay about why their least important value might be of value to someone else. The study tracked the students' grades for three years. Ethnic minority students in the self-affirmation condition received higher grade point averages than the ethnic minority students who wrote about why their least important value might be important to someone else. There was no effect of self-affirmation in white students. Findings suggest that for students who face daily, repeated stressors at school, self-affirmation buffers against worsening school performance.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, G. L., Garcia, J., Apfel, N., &amp; Master, A. (2006). [http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs375/fa13/cs375/Science-2006-Cohen-1307-10.pdf Reducing the racial achievement gap: A social-psychological intervention]. Science, 313(5791), 1307-1310&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, G. L., Garcia, J., Purdie-Vaughns, V., Apfel, N., &amp; Brzustoski, P. (2009). [https://ed.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/recursive_processes_final_science.pdf Recursive processes in self-affirmation: Intervening to close the minority achievement gap]. science, 324(5925), 400-403&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, values affirmation decreased the achievement gap for college students from low socioeconomic status&lt;ref&gt;Bowen NK, Wegmann KM, Webber KC. 2013. Enhancing a brief writing intervention to combat stereotype threat among middle-school students. Journal of Education Psychology 105:427–35&lt;/ref&gt; and for women in introductory physics courses.&lt;ref&gt;Miyake A, Kost-Smith LE, Finkelstein ND, Pollock SJ, Cohen GL, Ito TA. 2010. Reducing the gender achievement gap in college science: a classroom study of values affirmation. Science 330:1234–37&lt;/ref&gt; These findings suggest that self-affirmation can have a buffering effect on academic achievement for groups who face the most threat.

===Health===
Women concerned with their weight were recruited for a study. Concern with weight has similar effects of stress in that it can cause psychological distress, poor eating, and weight gain.&lt;ref&gt;Haines J, Neumark-Sztainer D, Wall M, Story M. 2007. Personal, behavioral, and environmental risk and protective factors for adolescent overweight. Obesity 15:2748–60&lt;/ref&gt; Half of the women completed a values essay. Self-affirmed participants had lost more weight, had lower [[body mass index]], and smaller waist circumference than non-affirmed women.&lt;ref&gt;Logel C, Cohen GL. 2012. The role of the self in physical health. Psychological Science. 23:53–55&lt;/ref&gt;

Patients with end stage [[Nephropathy|renal disease]] participated in a study assessing the effects of self-affirmation on adherence to [[phosphate binder]]s that facilitate control of phosphate levels. Poor phosphate control in this population can be dangerous and life-threatening.  There was a significant improvement in serum phosphate levels for the affirmed patients compared to the non-affirmed patients, suggesting better adherence to phosphate binders.&lt;ref&gt;Wileman, V., Farrington, K., Chilcot, J., Norton, S., Wellsted, D. M., Almond, M. K., ... &amp; Armitage, C. J. (2014). Evidence That Self-Affirmation Improves Phosphate Control in Hemodialysis Patients: A Pilot Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial. Annals of Behavioral Medicine, 1-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factors that influence the effectiveness of self-affirmations==

===Culture===
[[Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory|Individualist and collectivist cultures]] place different levels of importance on belonging to in-groups, and it is thought that this may vary the effects of self-affirmation.&lt;ref name="Sherman 2006"/&gt; One study investigated the effects of self-affirmation on reducing [[cognitive dissonance]]. This study found that self-affirmed participants from individualist cultures saw reductions in cognitive dissonance, whereas self-affirmed participants from collectivist cultures did not experience a reduction in cognitive dissonance.&lt;ref&gt;Heine, S. J., &amp; Lehman, D. R. (1997). Culture, dissonance, and self-affirmation. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 23, 389-400&lt;/ref&gt; Another study examined the effect on individuals from individualist and collectivist backgrounds of writing a values essay about a value that was important to the participant compared to a value that was important to the participant's family. The authors found reduced [[cognitive dissonance]] for participants from collectivist cultures who wrote about values important to them and their families, and found reduced cognitive dissonance for participants from individualist cultures who wrote about a value important to just them.&lt;ref&gt;Hoshino-Browne, E., Zanna, A. S., Spencer, S. J., &amp; Zanna, M. P. (2004). Investigating attitudes cross-culturally: A case of cognitive dissonance among East Asians and North Americans. In G. Haddock &amp; G. R. Maio (Eds.), Contemporary perspectives on the psychology of attitudes (pp. 375-397). New York: Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===Importance of the threatened domain===
Benefits from self-affirmation are thought to primarily occur when the perceived threat is in an area of importance to the individual.&lt;ref name="Sherman 2006"/&gt; For example, in the experiment detailed above in which coffee drinkers read an article about caffeine consumption and increased risk of breast cancer, self-affirmation only reduced defensiveness in individuals who were heavy coffee drinkers and not in occasional coffee drinkers.&lt;ref name="Sherman 2000"&gt;Sherman, D. A., Nelson, L. D., &amp; Steele, C. M. (2000). Do messages about health risks threaten the self? Increasing the acceptance of threatening health messages via self-affirmation. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 26(9), 1046-1058&lt;/ref&gt; Because an article on the risks associated with caffeine consumption might not pose the same threat to occasional coffee drinkers as to heavy coffee drinkers, self-affirmation likely does not provide the same benefit for occasional coffee drinkers. Thus, the importance of the threatened domain to one's self-integrity is thought to influence the effectiveness of self-affirmations.

==Factors underlying the effects of self-affirmation theory==
Research has not yet identified the underlying mechanisms of how self-affirmation buffers against stress and reduces defensiveness. However, it is believed that there is not just one factor responsible for the effects of self-affirmation, but rather many.&lt;ref name="Sherman 2006"/&gt; To date, increasing positive emotions and self-esteem have been investigated as mechanisms of self-affirmation, but the findings are mixed. Some studies have found that positive mood brings about similar reductions in defensiveness as self-affirmations.&lt;ref&gt;Koole, S. L., Smeets, K., Van Knippenberg, A., &amp; Dijksterhuis, A. (1999). The cessation of rumination through self-affirmation. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 77(1), 111&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raghunathan, R., &amp; Trope, Y. (2002). Walking the tightrope between feeling good and being accurate: mood as a resource in processing persuasive messages. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 83(3), 510&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, several studies fail to detect any effect of self-affirmation on mood, suggesting self-affirmation does not operate via increases in positive mood.&lt;ref name="Sherman 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steele, C. M., Spencer, S. J., &amp; Lynch, M. (1993). Self-image resilience and dissonance: the role of affirmational resources. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 64(6), 885&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, results on the effects of self-affirmation on self-esteem are also mixed. Some studies have observed increases in self-esteem following self-affirmation,&lt;ref&gt;Fein, S., &amp; Spencer, S. J. (1997). Prejudice as self-image maintenance: Affirming the self through derogating others. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 73(1), 31&lt;/ref&gt; whereas other have found no effect on self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;Schmeichel, B. J., &amp; Martens, A. (2005). Self-affirmation and mortality salience: Affirming values reduces worldview defense and death-thought accessibility. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 31(5), 658-667&lt;/ref&gt; More research is needed to better understand ''how'' self-affirmation can provide benefit to individuals.

[[File:William Powell Frith The signal 1858.jpg|thumb|right|In "The Signal" painting by [[William Powell Frith]], a woman waves a handkerchief as a signal to a person able to see this action, in order to convey a message to this person.]]

In [[communication system]]s, [[signal processing]], and [[electrical engineering]], a '''signal''' is a function that "conveys [[information]] about the behavior or attributes of some phenomenon".&lt;ref name=Priemer/&gt;  A signal may also be defined as an "observable change in a quantifiable entity".&lt;ref&gt;Pragnan Chakravorty, "What Is a Signal? [Lecture Notes]," IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, vol. 35, no. 5, pp. 175–77, Sept. 2018. https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2018.2832195&lt;/ref&gt; In the physical world,  any quantity exhibiting variation in time or variation in space (such as an image) is potentially a signal that might provide information on the status of a physical system, or convey a [[message]] between observers, among other possibilities.&lt;ref name=Note/&gt; The ''[[IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing]]'' states that the term "signal" includes [[audio signal|audio]], [[video]], speech, [[image]], communication, geophysical, sonar, radar, medical and musical signals.&lt;ref name=IEEE/&gt; In a later development, a signal is redefined as an "observable change in a quantifiable entity";&lt;ref name=PC/&gt; here, anything which is only a function of space, such as an image, is excluded from the category of signals. Also, it is stated that a signal may or may not contain any information.

In nature, signals can take the form of any action by one organism able to be perceived by other organisms, ranging from the release of chemicals by plants to alert nearby plants of the same type of a predator, to sounds or motions made by animals to alert other animals of the presence of danger or of food. Signaling occurs in organisms all the way down to the cellular level, with [[cell signaling]]. [[Signaling theory]], in evolutionary biology, proposes that a substantial driver for [[evolution]] is the ability for animals to communicate with each other by developing ways of signaling. In human engineering, signals are typically provided by a [[sensor]], and often the original form of a signal is converted to another form of energy using a [[transducer]]. For example, a [[microphone]] converts an acoustic signal to a voltage waveform, and a [[Loudspeaker|speaker]] does the reverse.&lt;ref name=Priemer/&gt;

The formal study of the information content of signals is the field of [[information theory]]. The information in a signal is usually accompanied by [[Noise (electronics)|noise]]. The term ''noise'' usually means an undesirable random disturbance, but is often extended to include unwanted signals conflicting with the desired signal (such as [[crosstalk]]). The prevention of noise is covered in part under the heading of [[signal integrity]]. The separation of desired signals from a background is the field of [[Detection theory|signal recovery]],&lt;ref name=Wilmshurst/&gt; one branch of which is [[estimation theory]], a probabilistic approach to suppressing random disturbances.

Engineering disciplines such as electrical engineering have led the way in the design, study, and implementation of systems involving [[Data transmission|transmission]], [[data storage device|storage]], and [[Information processor|manipulation of information]]. In the latter half of the 20th century, electrical engineering itself separated into several disciplines, specialising in the design and analysis of systems that manipulate physical signals; [[electronic engineering]] and [[computer engineering]] as examples; while [[Industrial design|design engineering]] developed to deal with functional design of [[User interface|user–machine interfaces]].

==Definitions==
Definitions specific to sub-fields are common. For example, in [[information theory]], a ''signal'' is a codified message, that is, the sequence of states in a communication channel that encodes a message. In the context of [[signal processing]], signals are analog and digital representations of analog physical quantities.

In terms of their spatial distributions, signals may be categorized as point source signals (PSSs) and distributed source signals (DSSs).&lt;ref name=PC/&gt;

In a communication system, a ''transmitter'' encodes a ''message'' to create a signal, which is carried to a ''receiver'' by the [[communications channel]].  For example, the words "[[Mary had a little lamb]]" might be the message spoken into a [[telephone]]. The telephone transmitter converts the sounds into an electrical signal. The signal is transmitted to the receiving telephone by wires; at the receiver it is reconverted into sounds.

In telephone networks, [[Signaling (telecommunications)|signaling]], for example [[common-channel signaling]], refers to phone number and other digital control information rather than the actual voice signal.

Signals can be categorized in various ways.  The most common distinction is between discrete and continuous spaces that the functions are defined over, for example discrete and continuous time domains.  [[Discrete-time signal]]s are often referred to as ''[[time series]]'' in other fields.  [[Continuous-time signal]]s are often referred to as ''continuous signals''.

A second important distinction is between discrete-valued and continuous-valued.  Particularly in [[digital signal processing]], a [[Digital signal (signal processing)|digital signal]] may be defined as a sequence of discrete values, typically associated with an underlying continuous-valued physical process. In [[digital electronics]], digital signals are the continuous-time waveform signals in a digital system, representing a bit-stream.

Another important property of a signal is its  [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]] or [[information content]].&lt;!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]--&gt;

== Analog and digital signals ==
[[File:Imagen 4.png|thumb|A digital signal has two or more distinguishable waveforms, in this example, high voltage and low voltages, each of which can be mapped onto a digit. Characteristically, noise can be removed from digital signals provided it is not too large.]]
Two main types of signals encountered in practice are ''[[analog (signal)|analog]]'' and ''[[Digital signal|digital]]''. The figure shows a digital signal that results from approximating an analog signal by its values at particular time instants.  Digital signals are ''[[Quantization (signal processing)|quantized]]'', while analog signals are continuous.

===Analog signal===
{{main|Analog signal}}
An analog signal  is any [[continuous signal]] for which the time varying feature (variable) of the signal is a representation of some other time varying quantity, i.e., ''analogous'' to another time varying signal.   For example, in an analog [[audio signal]], the instantaneous [[voltage]] of the signal varies continuously with the [[Sound pressure|pressure]] of the sound waves. It differs from a [[Digital signal (signal processing)|digital signal]], in which the continuous quantity is a representation of a sequence of [[discrete space|discrete values]] which can only take on one of a finite number of values.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~www_pa/Scots_Guide/info/signals/digital/digital.htm|title=Digital signals|website=www.st-andrews.ac.uk|access-date=2017-12-17|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302055200/http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~www_pa/Scots_Guide/info/signals/digital/digital.htm|archivedate=2017-03-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/analog-vs-digital/digital-signals|title=Analog vs. Digital - learn.sparkfun.com|website=learn.sparkfun.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-17|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705100418/https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/analog-vs-digital/digital-signals|archivedate=2017-07-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term analog signal usually refers to [[electrical signal]]s; however, [[Classical mechanics|mechanical]], [[pneumatic]], [[hydraulic]], human speech, and other systems may also convey or be considered analog signals.
   
An analog signal uses some property of the medium to convey the signal's information. For example, an [[aneroid barometer]] uses rotary position as the signal to convey pressure information.  In an electrical signal, the [[voltage]], [[Electric current|current]], or [[frequency]] of the signal may be varied to represent the information.
   
Any information may be conveyed by an analog signal; often such a signal is a measured response to changes in physical phenomena, such as [[sound]], [[light]], [[temperature]], position, or [[pressure]].  The physical variable is converted to an analog signal by a [[transducer]].   For example, in sound recording, fluctuations in air pressure (that is to say, [[sound]]) strike the diaphragm of a [[microphone]] which induces corresponding fluctuations in the current produced by a coil in an electromagnetic microphone, or the voltage produced by a condenser microphone.  The voltage or the current is said to be an "analog" of the sound.

===Digital signal===
{{main|Digital signal}}
[[File:Original message.jpg|thumb|A binary signal, also known as a logic signal, is a digital signal with two distinguishable levels]]
A digital signal is a signal that is constructed from a discrete set of [[waveform]]s of a physical quantity so as to represent a sequence of [[discrete space|discrete]] values.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1eO7kLWUmYIC&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;ots=EBhxEwk7bY&amp;dq=digital%20signal%20logic&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage&amp;q=digital%20signal%20logic&amp;f=false Digital Design with CPLD Applications and VHDL  By Robert K.

Other types of digital signals can represent [[three-valued logic]] or higher valued logics.

Alternatively, a digital signal may be considered to be the sequence of codes represented by such a physical quantity.&lt;ref name=Khanna&gt;Vinod Kumar Khanna, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vf2qXAbn58oC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=%22a+digital+signal+is+a%22&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22a%20digital%20signal%20is%20a%22&amp;f=false Digital Signal Processing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171217234501/https://books.google.com/books?id=Vf2qXAbn58oC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=%22a+digital+signal+is+a%22&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y |date=2017-12-17 }}, 2009: A digital signal is a special form of discrete-time signal which is discrete in both time and amplitude, obtained by permitting each value (sample) of a discrete-time signal to acquire a finite set of values (quantization), assigning it a numerical symbol according to a code ... A digital signal is a sequence or list of numbers drawn from a finite set.&lt;/ref&gt; The physical quantity may be a variable electric current or voltage, the intensity, phase or [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] of an [[optics|optical]] or other [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic field]], acoustic pressure, the [[magnetization]] of a [[magnetic storage]] media, etcetera. Digital signals are present in all [[digital electronics]], notably computing equipment and [[data transmission]].

[[File:Imagen 4.png|thumb|A received digital signal may be impaired by [[noise]] and [[distortion]]s without necessarily affecting the digits]]
With digital signals, system noise, provided it is not too great, will not affect system operation whereas noise always degrades the operation of [[analog signals]] to some degree.

Digital signals often arise via [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampling]] of analog signals, for example, a continually fluctuating voltage on a line that can be digitized by an [[analog-to-digital converter]] circuit, wherein the circuit will read the voltage level on the line, say, every 50&amp;nbsp;[[microseconds]] and represent each reading with a fixed number of bits. The resulting stream of numbers is stored as digital data on a discrete-time and quantized-amplitude signal.  [[Computer]]s and other [[Digital data|digital]] devices are restricted to discrete time.

=== Time discretization{{anchor|Discretization}} ===
[[File:Sampled.signal.svg|right|thumb|Discrete-time signal created from a continuous signal by [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampling]]]]
One of the fundamental distinctions between different types of signals is between [[Continuous signal|continuous]] and [[Discrete-time signal|discrete time]].  In the mathematical abstraction, the domain of a continuous-time (CT) signal is the set of real numbers (or some interval thereof), whereas the domain of a discrete-time (DT) signal is the set of [[integer]]s (or some interval).  What these integers represent depends on the nature of the signal; most often it is time.

If for a signal, the quantities are defined only on a discrete set of times, we call it a [[discrete-time signal]]. A simple source for a discrete time signal is the [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampling]] of a continuous signal, approximating the signal by a sequence of its values at particular time instants.

A discrete-time real (or complex) signal can be seen as a function from (a subset of) the set of integers (the index labeling time instants) to the set of [[real numbers|real]] (or [[complex numbers|complex]]) numbers (the function values at those instants).

A continuous-time real (or complex) signal is any real-valued (or complex-valued) [[mathematical function|function]] which is defined at every time ''t'' in an interval, most commonly an infinite interval.

=== Amplitude quantization{{anchor|Quantization}} ===
[[File:Digital.signal.svg|right|thumb|Digital signal resulting from approximation to an analog signal, which is a continuous function of time]]
If a signal is to be represented as a sequence of numbers, it is impossible to maintain exact precision - each number in the sequence must have a finite number of digits.  As a result, the values of such a signal belong to a [[finite set]]; in other words, it is [[Quantization (signal processing)|quantized]]. Quantization is the process of converting a continuous analog audio signal to a digital signal with discrete numerical values.

== Examples of signals ==

Signals in nature can be converted to electronic signals by various [[sensor]]s. Some examples are:

* ''[[motion (physics)|Motion]]''.  The motion of an object can be considered to be a signal, and can be monitored by various sensors to provide electrical signals.&lt;ref name= Lu/&gt; For example, [[radar]] can provide an electromagnetic signal for following aircraft motion.  A motion signal is one-dimensional (time), and the range is generally three-dimensional.  Position is thus a 3-vector signal; position and orientation of a rigid body is a 6-vector signal. Orientation signals can be generated using a [[gyroscope]].&lt;ref name= gyro/&gt;
* ''[[Sound]]''.  Since a sound is a [[oscillation|vibration]] of a medium (such as air), a sound signal associates a [[pressure]] value to every value of time and three space coordinates. A sound signal is converted to an electrical signal by a [[microphone]], generating a [[voltage]] signal as an analog of the sound signal, making the sound signal available for further signal processing. Sound signals can be [[sampling (signal processing)|sampled]] at a discrete set of time points; for example, [[compact disc]]s (CDs) contain discrete signals representing sound, recorded at 44,100 samples per [[second]]; each sample contains data for a left and right channel, which may be considered to be a 2-vector signal (since CDs are recorded in [[stereophonic sound|stereo]]). The CD encoding is converted to an electrical signal by [[Blu-ray Disc#Laser and optics|reading]] the information with a [[laser]], converting the sound signal to an optical signal.&lt;ref name=Chambers/&gt;
* ''[[Image]]s''.  A picture or image consists of a brightness or color signal, a function of a two-dimensional location. The object's appearance is presented as an emitted or reflected electromagnetic wave, one form of electronic signal. It can be converted to voltage or current waveforms using devices such as the [[charge-coupled device]].  A 2D image can have a continuous spatial domain, as in a traditional photograph or painting; or the image can be discretized in space, as in a [[raster scanning|raster scanned]] [[digital image]].  Color images are typically represented as a combination of images in three [[primary colors]], so that the signal is vector-valued with dimension three.
* ''[[Video]]s''.  A video signal is a sequence of images.  A point in a video is identified by its two-dimensional position and by the time at which it occurs, so a video signal has a three-dimensional domain.  Analog video has one continuous domain dimension (across a [[scan line]]) and two discrete dimensions (frame and line).
* Biological ''[[membrane potential]]s''.  The value of the signal is an [[electric potential]] ("voltage").  The domain is more difficult to establish.  Some [[cell (biology)|cell]]s or [[organelle]]s have the same membrane potential throughout; [[neuron]]s generally have different potentials at different points.  These signals have very low energies, but are enough to make nervous systems work; they can be measured in aggregate by the techniques of [[electrophysiology]].

Other examples of signals are the output of a [[thermocouple]], which conveys temperature information, and the output of a [[pH meter]] which conveys acidity information.&lt;ref name=Priemer/&gt;

==Signal processing==
{{main|Signal processing}}
[[File:Signal processing system.png|thumb|400px|Signal transmission using electronic signals]]

A typical role for signals is in signal processing. A common example is signal transmission between different locations. The embodiment of a signal in electrical form is made by a [[transducer]] that converts the signal from its original form to a [[waveform]] expressed as a [[Electric current|current]] (''I'') or a [[voltage]] (''V''), or an [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic waveform]], for example, an [[Free-space optical communication|optical signal]] or [[radio transmission]]. Once expressed as an electronic signal, the signal is available for further processing by electrical devices such as [[Amplifier|electronic amplifiers]] and [[electronic filters]], and can be transmitted to a remote location by [[Transmitter|electronic transmitters]] and received using [[Receiver (radio)|electronic receivers]].

==Signals and systems==
In [[Electrical engineering]] programs, a class and field of study known as "signals and systems" (S and S) is often seen as the "cut class" for EE careers, and is dreaded by some students as such. Depending on the school, undergraduate EE students generally take the class as juniors or seniors, normally depending on the number and level of previous [[linear algebra]] and [[differential equation]] classes they have taken.&lt;ref name="McMahon s and s"&gt;{{cite book |isbn= 978-0-07-147578-5 |url= https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0071475788?selectObb=new|title= Signals &amp; Systems Demystified|author= David McMahon |location=New York|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The field studies input and output signals, and the mathematical representations between them known as systems, in four domains: Time, Frequency, ''s'' and ''z''. Since signals and systems are both studied in these four domains, there are 8 major divisions of study. As an example, when working with continuous time signals (''t''), one might transform from the time domain to a frequency or ''s'' domain; or from discrete time (''n'') to frequency or ''z'' domains. Systems also can be transformed between these domains like signals, with continuous to ''s'' and discrete to ''z''.

Although S and S falls under and includes all the topics covered in this article, as well as [[Analog signal processing]] and [[Digital signal processing]], it actually is a subset of the field of [[Mathematical model]]ing. The field goes back to RF over a century ago, when it was all analog, and generally continuous. Today, software has taken the place of much of the analog circuitry design and analysis, and even continuous signals are now generally processed digitally. Ironically, digital signals also are processed continuously in a sense, with the software doing calculations between discrete signal "rests" to prepare for the next input/transform/output event.

In past EE curricula S and S, as it is often called, involved circuit analysis and design via mathematical modeling and some numerical methods, and was updated several decades ago with [[Dynamical system]]s tools including differential equations, and recently, [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangians]]. The difficulty of the field at that time included the fact that not only mathematical modeling, circuits, signals and complex systems were being modeled, but physics as well, and a deep knowledge of electrical (and now electronic) topics also was involved and required.

Today, the field has become even more daunting and complex with the addition of circuit, systems and signal analysis and design languages and software, from [[MATLAB]] and [[Simulink]] to [[NumPy]], [[VHDL]], [[PSpice]], [[Verilog]] and even [[Assembly language]]. Students are expected to understand the tools as well as the mathematics, physics, circuit analysis, and transformations between the 8 domains.

Because mechanical engineering topics like friction, dampening etc. have very close analogies in signal science (inductance, resistance, voltage, etc.), many of the tools originally used in ME transformations (Laplace and Fourier transforms, Lagrangians, sampling theory, probability, difference equations, etc.) have now been applied to signals, circuits, systems and their components, analysis and design in EE. Dynamical systems that involve noise, filtering and other random or chaotic attractors and repellors have now placed stochastic sciences and statistics between the more deterministic discrete and continuous functions in the field. (Deterministic as used here means signals that are completely determined as functions of time).

EE taxonomists are still not decided where S&amp;S falls within the whole field of signal processing vs. circuit analysis and mathematical modeling, but the common link of the topics that are covered in the course of study has brightened boundaries with dozens of books, journals, etc. called Signals and Systems, and used as text and test prep for the EE, as well as, recently, computer engineering exams.&lt;ref name="Signals and systems"&gt;{{cite book |isbn= 978-0073380681 |url= https://www.amazon.com/Signals-Systems-Analysis-Transform-Methods/dp/0073380687/ref=sr_1_7?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1378056574&amp;sr=1-7&amp;keywords=signals+and+systems|title= Signals and Systems: Analysis Using Transform Methods &amp; MATLAB|author= M.J.

In 1958, Harvard psychologist [[Herbert Kelman]] identified three broad varieties of social influence.&lt;ref name="Kelman"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kelman, H.|year=1958|title=Compliance, identification, and internalization: Three processes of attitude change|journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution|volume=2|issue=1|pages=51–60|doi=10.1177/002200275800200106|url=http://scholar.harvard.edu/hckelman/files/Compliance_identification_and_internalization.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#'''[[Compliance (psychology)|Compliance]]''' is when people appear to agree with others but actually keep their dissenting opinions private.
#'''[[Identification (psychology)|Identification]]''' is when people are influenced by someone who is liked and respected, such as a famous celebrity.
#'''[[Internalisation (sociology)|Internalization]]''' is when people accept a belief or behavior and agree both publicly and privately.

Morton Deutsch and Harold Gerard described two psychological [[need]]s that lead humans to conform to the expectations of others. These include our need to be right ([[informational social influence]]) and our need to be liked ([[normative social influence]]).&lt;ref name="Gerard"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Deutsch, M.|author2=Gerard, H. B.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1955|title=A study of normative and informational social influences upon individual judgment|journal=Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|volume=51|issue=3|pages=629–636|pmid=13286010|doi=10.1037/h0046408|url=http://web.comhem.se/u52239948/08/deutsch55.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Informational influence (or ''social proof'') is an influence to accept information from another as evidence about reality. Informational influence comes into play when people are uncertain, either because stimuli are intrinsically ambiguous or because there is social disagreement. Normative influence is an influence to conform to the positive expectations of others. In terms of Kelman's typology, normative influence leads to public compliance, whereas informational influence leads to private acceptance.&lt;ref name=Kelman /&gt;

==Types==
Social influence is a broad term that relates to many different phenomena. Listed below are some major types of social influence that are being researched in the field of [[social psychology]]. For more information, follow the main article links provided.

===Kelman's varieties===
There are three processes of [[attitude change]] as defined by Harvard psychologist [[Herbert Kelman]] in a 1958 paper published in the ''Journal of Conflict Resolution''.&lt;ref name="Kelman" /&gt; The purpose of defining these processes was to help determine the effects of social influence: for example, to separate public conformity (behavior) from private acceptance (personal belief).

====Compliance====
{{Main article|Compliance (psychology)}}
Compliance is the act of responding favorably to an explicit or implicit request offered by others. Technically, compliance is a change in [[behavior]] but not necessarily in [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude;]] one can comply due to mere [[Obedience (human behavior)|obedience]] or by otherwise opting to withhold private thoughts due to social pressures.&lt;ref name="Aronson"&gt;Aronson, Elliot, Timothy D. Wilson, and Robin M. Akert. Social Psychology. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 2010. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kelman's 1958 paper, the satisfaction derived from compliance is due to the social effect of the accepting influence (i.e., people comply for an expected reward or punishment-aversion).&lt;ref name="Kelman" /&gt;

====Identification====
{{Main article|Identification (psychology)}}
Identification is the changing of attitudes or behaviors due to the influence of someone who is admired. [[Advertisements]] that rely upon [[celebrities|celebrity]] endorsements to market their products are taking advantage of this phenomenon. According to Kelman, the desired relationship that the identifier relates to the behavior or attitude change.&lt;ref name="Kelman" /&gt;

====Internalization====
{{Main article|Internalization}}
Internalization is the process of acceptance of a set of norms established by people or groups that are influential to the individual. The individual accepts the influence because the content of the influence accepted is intrinsically rewarding. It is congruent with the individual's value system, and according to Kelman the "reward" of internalization is "the content of the new behavior".&lt;ref name="Kelman" /&gt;

===Conformity===
{{Main article|Conformity}}
Conformity is a type of social influence involving a change in behavior, belief, or thinking to align with those of others or with normative standards. It is the most common and pervasive form of social influence. [[Social psychology]] research in conformity tends to distinguish between two varieties: [[informational social influence|informational conformity]] (also called ''social proof'', or "internalization" in Kelman's terms ) and [[normative social influence|normative conformity]] ("compliance" in Kelman's terms).&lt;ref name="Aronson" /&gt;

In the case of [[peer pressure]], a person is convinced to do something that they might not want to do (such as taking [[illegal drugs]]) but which they perceive as "necessary" to keep a positive [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]] with other people (such as their [[friend]]s). Conformity from peer pressure generally results from identification with the group members or from compliance of some members to appease others.

Conformity can be in appearance, or may be more complete in nature; impacting an individual both publicly and privately.

Compliance (also referred to as acquiescence) demonstrates a public conformity to a group majority or norm, while the individual continues to privately disagree or dissent, holding on to their original beliefs or to an alternative set of beliefs differing from the majority. Compliance appears as conformity, but there is a division between the public and the private self.

Conversion includes the private acceptance that is absent in compliance. The individual's original behaviour, beliefs, or thinking changes to align with that of others (the influencers), both publicly and privately. The individual has accepted the behavior, belief, or thinking, and has internalized it, making it his own. Conversion may also refer to individual members of a group changing from their initial (and varied) opinions to adopt the opinions of others, which may differ from their original opinions. The resulting group position may be a hybrid of various aspects of individual initial opinions, or it may be an alternative independent of the initial positions reached through consensus.

What appears to be conformity may in fact be congruence. Congruence occurs when an individual's behavior, belief, or thinking is already aligned with that of the others, and no change occurs.

In situations where conformity (including compliance, conversion, and congruence) is absent, there are non-conformity processes such as independence and anti-conformity. Independence, also referred to as dissent, involves an individual (either through their actions or lack of action, or through the public expression of their beliefs or thinking) being aligned with their personal standards but inconsistent with those of other members of the group (either all of the group or a majority). Anti-conformity, also referred to as counter-conformity, may appear as independence, but it lacks alignment with personal standards and is for the purpose of challenging the group. Actions as well as stated opinions and beliefs are often diametrically opposed to that of the group norm or majority. The underlying reasons for this type of behavior may be rebelliousness/obstinacy or it may be to ensure that all alternatives and view points are given due consideration.&lt;ref&gt;Forsyth, D. R. (2010, 2006). Group Dynamics. Belmont: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minority influence===
{{Main article|Minority influence}}
Minority influence takes place when a majority is influenced to accept the beliefs or behaviors of a minority. Minority influence can be affected by the sizes of majority and minority groups, the level of consistency of the minority group, and situational factors (such as the affluence or social importance of the minority).&lt;ref name="Moscovici"&gt;Moscovici, S. and Nemeth (1974) Minority influence. In C. Nemetn (ed.), Social psychology: Classic and contemporary integrations (pp. 217-249), Chicago:Rand McNally&lt;/ref&gt; Minority influence most often operates through [[informational social influence]] (as opposed to [[normative social influence]]) because the majority may be indifferent to the liking of the minority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Wood, W.|author2=Lundgren, S.|author3=Ouellette, J.|author4=Busceme, S.|author5=Blackstone, T.|year=1994|lastauthoramp=y|title=Minority Influence: A Meta-Analytic Review of Social Influence Processes|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=115|number=3|pages=323–345|pmid=8016284|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.115.3.323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-fulfilling prophecy===
{{Main article|Self-fulfilling prophecy}}
A self-fulfilling prophecy is a prediction that directly or indirectly causes itself to become true due to positive feedback between [[belief]] and [[behavior]]. A prophecy declared as truth (when it is actually false) may sufficiently influence people, either through fear or logical confusion, so that their reactions ultimately fulfill the once-false prophecy. This term is credited to [[sociologist]] [[Robert K. Merton]] from an article he published in 1948.&lt;ref name=SFP-48&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reactance===
{{Main article|Reactance (psychology)}}
Reactance is the adoption of a view contrary to the view that a person is being pressured to accept, perhaps due to a perceived threat to behavioral freedoms. This phenomenon has also been called ''anticonformity''. While the results are the opposite of what the influencer intended, the reactive behavior is a result of [[social pressure]].&lt;ref name="Brehm"&gt;Brehm, J. W. (1966). A theory of psychological reactance. Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt; It is notable that anticonformity does not necessarily mean ''independence''. In many studies, reactance manifests itself in a deliberate rejection of an influence, even if the influence is clearly correct.&lt;ref name="Frager"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frager | first1 = R | year = 1970 | title = Conformity and anti-conformity in Japan | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 203–210 | doi=10.1037/h0029434}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Obedience===
{{Main article|Obedience (human behavior)}}
Obedience is a form of social influence that derives from an authority figure. The [[Milgram experiment]], Zimbardo's [[Stanford prison experiment]], and the [[Hofling hospital experiment]] are three particularly well-known experiments on obedience, and they all conclude that humans are surprisingly obedient in the presence of perceived legitimate authority figures.

===Persuasion===
{{Main article|Persuasion}}
Persuasion is the process of guiding oneself or another toward the adoption of an attitude by rational or symbolic means. [[Robert Cialdini]] defined six "weapons of influence": [[norm of reciprocity|reciprocity]], commitment, [[social proof]], [[authority]], liking, and [[scarcity]]. These "weapons of influence" attempt to bring about conformity by directed means. Persuasion can occur through [[Reason|appeals to reason]] or [[Appeal to emotion|appeals to emotion]].&lt;ref name="Cialdini"&gt;Cialdini, Robert B. (2001). ''Influence: Science and practice (4th ed.)''. Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon. {{ISBN|0-321-01147-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological manipulation===
{{Main article|Psychological manipulation}}
Psychological manipulation is a type of social influence that aims to change the behavior or [[perception]] of others through [[abuse|abusive]], [[deceptive]], or underhanded tactics.&lt;ref name=braiker&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who's Pulling Your Strings ? How to Break The Cycle of Manipulation |first=Harriet B.|last=Braiker |year=2004 |isbn=0-07-144672-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; By advancing the interests of the manipulator, often at another's expense, such methods could be considered exploitative, abusive, devious, and deceptive.
 
Social influence is not necessarily negative. For example, doctors can try to [[persuade]] patients to change unhealthy habits. Social influence is generally perceived to be harmless when it respects the right of the influenced to accept or reject it, and is not unduly coercive. Depending on the context and motivations, social influence may constitute underhanded manipulation.

===Abusive power and control===
{{Main article|Abusive power and control}}
Controlling abusers use tactics to exert power and control over their victims.

===Propaganda===
{{Main article|Propaganda}}
Propaganda is information that is not [[Objectivity (journalism)|objective]] and is used primarily to influence an audience and further an agenda, often by presenting facts selectively to encourage a particular synthesis or perception, or using [[loaded language]] to produce an emotional rather than a rational response to the information that is presented.&lt;ref name="brit_BLS"&gt;{{cite web | last = Smith | first = Bruce L. | author-link = Bruce Lannes Smith | title = Propaganda | website = britannica.com | publisher = [[Encyclopædia Britannica|Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]] | date = 17 February 2016 | url = http://www.britannica.com/topic/propaganda | access-date = 23 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hard power===
{{Main article|Hard power}}
Hard power is the use of [[military]] and [[economics|economic]] means to influence the behavior or interests of other political bodies. This form of [[political power]] is often aggressive ([[coercion]]), and is most effective when imposed by one political body upon another of lesser military and/or economic power.&lt;ref name=hard&gt;{{cite web|title=Hard Power Vs. Soft Power|url=http://www.themarknews.com/articles/895-hard-power-vs-soft-power|publisher=The Mark|accessdate=26 April 2012|author=Daryl Copeland|date=Feb 2, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501050956/http://www.themarknews.com/articles/895-hard-power-vs-soft-power|archivedate=1 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hard power contrasts with [[soft power]], which comes from [[diplomacy]], [[culture]] and [[history]].&lt;ref name=hard/&gt;

== Antecedents ==
Many factors can affect the impact of social influence.

===Social impact theory===
{{Main article|Social impact theory}}
Social impact theory was developed by [[Bibb Latané]] in 1981. This theory asserts that there are three factors which increase a person's likelihood to respond to social influence:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Latané | first1 = B | year = 1981 | title = The psychology of social impact | doi = 10.1037/0003-066x.36.4.343 | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 36 | issue = | pages = 343–356 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Strength'': The importance of the influencing group to the individual
*''Immediacy'': Physical (and temporal) proximity of the influencing group to the individual at the time of the influence attempt
*''Number'': The number of people in the group

===Cialdini's "weapons of influence"===
[[Robert Cialdini]] defines six "weapons of influence" that can contribute to an individual's propensity to be influenced by a persuader:&lt;ref name="Cialdini" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://conceptually.org/concepts/6-principles-of-influence/ |title=What are the 6 principles of influence? |website=conceptually.org |access-date= October 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[norm of reciprocity|Reciprocity]]: People tend to return a favor.
*[[Promise|Commitment]] and [[consistency]]: People do not like to be self-contradictory. Once they commit to an idea or behavior, they are averse to changing their minds without good reason.
*[[Social proof]]: People will be more open to things that they see others doing. For example, seeing others compost their organic waste after finishing a meal may influence the subject to do so as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sussman, R.|author2=Gifford, R.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2013|title=Be the Change You Want to See: Modeling Food Composting in Public Places|journal=Environment &amp; Behavior|volume=45|issue=3|pages=323–343|DOI=10.1177/0013916511431274}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Authority]]: People will tend to obey authority figures.
*Liking: People are more easily swayed by people they like.
*[[Scarcity]]: A perceived limitation of resources will generate demand.

===Unanimity===
Social Influence is strongest when the group perpetrating it is consistent and committed. Even a single instance of dissent can greatly wane the strength of an influence. For example, in Milgram's first set of [[Milgram experiment|obedience experiments]], 65% of participants complied with fake authority figures to administer "maximum shocks" to a confederate. In iterations of the Milgram experiment where three people administered shocks (two of whom were confederates), once one confederate disobeyed, only ten percent of subjects administered the maximum shocks.&lt;ref name=ObedStudy&gt;{{cite journal|last=Milgram |first=Stanley |year=1963 |title=Behavioral Study of Obedience |journal=Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology |volume=67 |issue=4 |pages=371–378 |pmid=14049516 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/abn/67/4/371 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120717013242/http://content.apa.org/journals/abn/67/4/371 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-17 |doi=10.1037/h0040525 }} [http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1981/A1981LC33300001.pdf Full-text PDF.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611105753/http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1981/A1981LC33300001.pdf |date=June 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Status ===
{{Main article|Appeal to authority}}
{{See also|Reputation}}
Those perceived as [[experts]] may exert social influence as a result of their perceived expertise. This involves [[credibility]], a tool of social influence from which one draws upon the notion of trust. People believe an individual to be credible for a variety of reasons, such as perceived experience, attractiveness, knowledge, etc. Additionally, pressure to maintain one's reputation and not be viewed as fringe may increase the tendency to agree with the group. This phenomenon is known as [[groupthink]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/05/books/05deba.html?scp=5&amp;sq=Shiller%20groupthink&amp;st=cse Ivory Tower Unswayed by Crashing Economy]. ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; Appeals to authority may especially affect norms of [[Obedience (human behavior)|obedience]]. The compliance of normal humans to authority in the famous [[Milgram experiment]] demonstrate the [[Power (social and political)|power]] of perceived authority.

Those with access to the media may use this access in an attempt to influence the public. For example, a politician may use speeches to persuade the public to support issues that he or she does not have the power to impose on the public. This is often referred to as using the "[[bully pulpit]]." Likewise, celebrities don't usually possess any political power, but they are familiar to many of the world's citizens and, therefore, possess [[social status]].

Power is one of the biggest reasons an individual feels the need to follow through with the suggestions of another. A person who possesses more authority (or is perceived as being more powerful) than others in a group is an icon or is most "popular" within a group. This person has the most influence over others. For example, in a child's school life, people who seem to control the perceptions of the students at school are most powerful in having a social influence over other children.&lt;ref&gt;C. Mugny; L Souchet; C Codaccioni; A Quiamzade (2008). Social Representation and Social Influence. 53 (2), pg 223-237.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Culture ===

[[Culture]] appears to play a role in the willingness of an individual to conform to the standards of a group. [[Stanley Milgram]] found that conformity was higher in [[Norway]] than in [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;Blass, T. (2004). The man who shocked the world: The life and legacy of Stanley Milgram. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; This has been attributed to Norway's longstanding tradition of social responsibility, compared to France's cultural focus on individualism. Japan likewise has a collectivist culture and thus a higher propensity to conformity. However, a 1970 [[Asch conformity experiments|Asch-style study]] found that when alienated, Japanese students were more susceptible to ''anticonformity'' (giving answers that were ''incorrect'' even when the group had collaborated on ''correct'' answers) one third of the time, significantly higher than has been seen in Asch studies in the past.&lt;ref name="Frager" /&gt;

While [[gender]] does not significantly affect a person's likelihood to conform, under certain conditions  [[gender roles]] do affect such a likelihood. Studies from the 1950s and 1960s concluded that women were more likely to conform than men. But a 1971 study found that [[experimenter bias]] was involved; all of the researchers were male, while all of the research participants were female. Studies thereafter found that the likelihood to conform almost equal between the genders. Furthermore, men conformed more often when faced with traditionally feminine topics, and women conformed more often when presented with masculine topics. In other words, ignorance about a subject can lead a person to defer to [[informational social influence|"social proof"]].&lt;ref&gt;Sistrunk, Frank; McDavid, John W.; Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Vol 17(2), Feb, 1971. pp. 200-207.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emotions ===
{{Main article|Appeal to emotion}}
Emotion and disposition may affect an individual's likelihood of conformity or anticonformity.&lt;ref name="Brehm" /&gt; In 2009, a study concluded that fear increases the chance of agreeing with a group, while romance or lust increases the chance of going against the group.&lt;ref&gt;EurekAlert. (2009). [http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2009-03/uom-for032309.php Fear or romance could make you change your mind, U of Minnesota study finds].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social structure ==

===Social networks===
{{Main article|Social network analysis}}
A [[social network]] is a [[social structure]] made up of nodes (representing individuals or organizations) which are connected (through ''ties'', also called ''edges'', ''connections'', or ''links'') by one or more types of interdependency (such as friendship, common interests or beliefs, sexual relations, or kinship). [[Social network analysis]] uses the lens of [[network theory]] to examine [[social relationships]]. Social network analysis as a field has become more prominent since the mid-20th century in determining the channels and effects of social influence. For example, [[Nicholas A. Christakis|Christakis]] and [[James H. Fowler|Fowler]] found that social networks transmit states and behaviors such as obesity,&lt;ref name="content.nejm.org"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Christakis | first1 = N.A. | last2 = Fowler | first2 = J.H. | year = 2007 | title = The Spread of Obesity in a Large Social Network Over 32 Years | url = | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 357 | issue = 4| pages = 370–379 | doi=10.1056/nejmsa066082 | pmid=17652652}}&lt;/ref&gt; smoking,&lt;ref name="J.H.

Identifying the extent of social influence, based on large-scale observational data with a latent [[social network]] structure, is pertinent to a variety of collective social phenomena including [[crime]], [[civil disorder|civil unrest]], and [[voting behavior]] in elections. For example, methodologies for disentangling social influence by peers from external influences—with latent social network structures and large-scale observational data—were applied to US presidential elections,&lt;ref&gt;Braha, D., &amp; de Aguiar, M. A. (2016). [https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04406 Voting Contagion]. arXiv preprint arXiv:1610.04406.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Braha, D., &amp; de Aguiar, M. A. (2017).

'''Software evolution''' is the term used in [[software engineering]] (specifically [[software maintenance]]) to refer to the process of developing [[software]] initially, then repeatedly updating it for various reasons. 

==General introduction==
[[Fred Brooks]], in his key book ''[[The Mythical Man-Month]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Fred Brooks]], ''[[The Mythical Man-Month]]''. [[Addison-Wesley]], 1975 &amp; 1995. ISBN
0-201-00650-2 &amp; {{ISBN|0-201-83595-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; states that over 90% of the costs of a typical system arise in the maintenance phase, and that any successful piece of software will inevitably be maintained.

In fact, [[Agile methods]] stem from maintenance-like activities in and around web based technologies, where the bulk of the capability comes from frameworks and standards.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Software maintenance address bug fixes and minor enhancements and software evolution focus on [[Adaptation (computer science)|adaptation]] and [[System migration|migration]].

&lt;!-- evolution of evolution models --&gt;
Software technologies will continue to develop. These changes will require new laws and theories to be created and justified. Some models as well would require additional aspects in developing future programs. Innovations and improvements do increase unexpected form of software development. The maintenance issues also would probably change as to adapt to the evolution of the future software. Software processes are themselves evolving, after going through learning and refinements, it is always improve their efficiency and effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;aeddy; ref: Understanding Open Source Software Evolution Walt Scacchi Institute for Software Research&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic concepts==
The need for software evolution comes from the fact that no one is able to predict how user requirements will evolve ''a priori'' .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first1=K. H. | last1=Bennett | first2=V. T. | last2=Rajlich | first3=R. Mohamad | last3=Mazrul, | title = Legacy System: Coping with success | journal=[[IEEE Software]] | date=1995 | pages=19–23.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In other words, the existing systems are never complete and continue to evolve.&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation | author = Trung Hung Vo | title = Software Maintenance| date=  2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As they evolve, the complexity of the systems will grow unless there is a better solution available to solve these issues. The main objectives of software evolution are ensuring functional relevance, reliability and flexibility of the system. Software evolution can be fully manual (based on changes by software engineers), partially automated (e.g. using refactoring tools) or fully automated (with autonomous configuration or evolution&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Baudry|first=Benoit|last2=Monperrus|first2=Martin|last3=Mony|first3=Cendrine|last4=Chauvel|first4=Franck|last5=Fleurey|first5=Franck|last6=Clarke|first6=Siobhan|date=February 2014|title=DIVERSIFY: Ecology-inspired software evolution for diversity emergence|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6747203/?reload=true|journal=2014 Software Evolution Week - IEEE Conference on Software Maintenance, Reengineering, and Reverse Engineering (CSMR-WCRE)|language=en-US|publisher=IEEE|doi=10.1109/csmr-wcre.2014.6747203|isbn=9781479937523|citeseerx=10.1.1.646.2786}}&lt;/ref&gt;). 

Software evolution has been greatly impacted by the Internet:

* the rapid growth of World Wide Web and Internet Resources make it easier for users and engineers to find related information. 

* open source development where anybody could download the source codes and hence modify it has enabled fast and parallel evolution (through forks). 

==Types of software maintenance==

E.B. Swanson initially identified the 
three categories of maintenance: corrective, adaptive, and perfective. Four categories of software were then catalogued by Lientz and Swanson (1980).&lt;ref&gt;Lientz, B.P. and Swanson, E.B., ''Software Maintenance Management, A Study Of The Maintenance Of Computer Application Software In 487 Data Processing Organizations''. Addison-Wesley, Reading MA, 1980. {{ISBN|0-201-04205-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These have since been updated and normalized internationally in the [[ISO/IEC]] 14764:2006:&lt;ref&gt;[[ISO/IEC]] 14764:2006, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Corrective maintenance'': Reactive modification of a software product performed after delivery to correct discovered problems;
* ''Adaptive maintenance'': Modification of a software product performed after delivery to keep a software product usable in a changed or changing environment;
* ''Perfective maintenance'': Modification of a software product after delivery to improve performance or maintainability;
* ''Preventive maintenance'': Modification of a software product after delivery to detect and correct latent faults in the software product before they become effective faults.

All of the preceding take place when there is a known requirement for change.

Although these categories were supplemented by many authors like Warren et al. (1999)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference

==Stage model==
Current trends  and practices are projected forward using a new model of software evolution called the staged model [1]. Staged model was introduced to replace conventional analysis which is less suitable for modern software development is rapid changing due to its difficulties of hard to contribute in software evolution. There are five distinct stages contribute in simple staged model (Initial development, Evolution, Servicing, Phase-out, and Close-down). 
* According to K.H.Bennett and V.T Rajlich [1], the key contribution is to separate the 'maintenance' phase into an evolution stage followed by a servicing and phase out stages. The first version of software system which is lacking some features will be developed during initial development or also known as alpha stage [2]. However, the architecture has already been possessed during this stage will bring for any future changes or amendments. Most references in this stage will base on scenarios or case study. Knowledge has defined as another important outcome of initial development. Such knowledge including the knowledge of application domain, user requirements, business rules, policies, solutions, algorithm, etc. Knowledge also seems as the important factor for the subsequent phase of evolution.
* Once the previous stage completed successfully (and must be completed successfully before entering next stage), the next stage would be evolution. Users tend to change their requirements as well as they prefer to see some improvements or changes. Due to this factor, the software industry is facing the challenges of rapid changes environment. Hence the goal of evolution is to adapt the application to the ever-changing user requirements and operating environment [1]. During the previous stage, the first version application created might contain a lot of faults, and those faults will be fixed during evolution stage based on more specified and accurate requirements due to the case study or scenarios.
* The software will continuously evolve until it is no longer evolvable and then enter stage of servicing (also known as software maturity). During this stage, only minor changes will be done.
* Next stage which is phase-out, there is no more servicing available for that particular software. However, the software still in production.
* Lastly, close-down. The software use is disconnected or discontinue [2] and the users are directed towards a replacement.[1].

==Lehman's Laws of Software Evolution==
{{Main|Lehman's laws of software evolution}}
Prof. [[Meir M. Lehman]], who worked at [[Imperial College London]] from 1972 to 2002, and his colleagues have identified a set of behaviours in the evolution of proprietary software. These behaviours (or observations) are known as Lehman's Laws, and there are eight of them:

# (1974) "Continuing Change" — an E-type system must be continually adapted or it becomes progressively less satisfactory&lt;ref name="laws1-5"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0164-1212(79)90022-0|last=Lehman|first=M. M.|title=On Understanding Laws, Evolution, and Conservation in the Large-Program Life Cycle|year=1980|journal=Journal of Systems and Software|volume=1|pages=213–221 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# (1974) "Increasing Complexity" — as an E-type system evolves, its complexity increases unless work is done to maintain or reduce it&lt;ref name="laws1-5" /&gt;
# (1980) "Self Regulation" — E-type system evolution processes are self-regulating with the distribution of product and process measures close to normal&lt;ref name="laws1-5" /&gt;
# (1978) "Conservation of Organisational Stability ([[invariant work rate]])" - the average effective global activity rate in an evolving E-type system is invariant over the product's lifetime&lt;ref name="laws1-5" /&gt;
# (1978) "Conservation of Familiarity" — as an E-type system evolves, all associated with it, developers, sales personnel and users, for example, must maintain mastery of its content and behaviour to achieve satisfactory evolution. Excessive growth diminishes that mastery. Hence the average [[incremental growth]] remains invariant as the system evolves.&lt;ref name="laws1-5" /&gt;
# (1991) "Continuing Growth" — the functional content of an E-type system must be continually increased to maintain user satisfaction over its lifetime
# (1996) "Declining Quality" — the quality of an E-type system will appear to be declining unless it is rigorously maintained and adapted to operational environment changes
# (1996) "Feedback System" (first stated 1974, formalised as law 1996) — E-type evolution processes constitute multi-level, multi-loop, multi-agent feedback systems and must be treated as such to achieve significant improvement over any reasonable base&lt;ref&gt;[[Lehman's laws of software evolution]]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is worth mentioning that the applicability of all of these laws for all types of software systems has been studied by several researchers. For example, see a presentation by Nanjangud C Narendra&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Software-Evolution-in-Agile-Development | title=Software Evolution in Agile Development | first=Nanjangud | last=Narendra | website=InfoQ | date=29 April 2011 | accessdate=19 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where he describes a case study of an enterprise Agile project in the light of Lehman’s laws of software evolution. Some empirical observations coming from the study of [[open source software development]] appear to challenge some of the laws {{Vague|date=June 2010}}{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}.

The laws predict that the need for functional change in a software system is inevitable, and not a consequence of incomplete or incorrect analysis of requirements or bad programming. They state that there are limits to what a software development team can achieve in terms of safely implementing changes and new functionality.

Maturity Models specific to software evolution have been developed to improve processes, and help to ensure continuous rejuvenation of the software as it evolves iteratively{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}.

The "global process" that is made by the many stakeholders (e.g. developers, users, their managers) has many feedback loops. The evolution speed is a function of the feedback loop structure and other characteristics of the global system. Process simulation techniques, such as [[system dynamics]] can be useful in understanding and managing such global process.

Software evolution is not likely to be [[Darwinian evolution|Darwinian]], [[Lamarckian evolution|Lamarckian]] or [[Baldwinian evolution|Baldwinian]], but an important phenomenon on its own. Given the increasing dependence on software at all levels of society and economy, the successful evolution of software is becoming increasingly critical. This is an important topic of research that hasn't received much attention.

The evolution of software, because of its rapid path in comparison to other man-made entities, was seen by Lehman as the "fruit fly" of the study of the evolution of artificial systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31401">'''Speech production''' is the process by which thoughts are translated into speech. This includes the selection of [[word]]s, the organization of relevant [[Grammar|grammatical]] forms, and then the articulation of the resulting sounds by the [[motor system]] using the [[vocal apparatus]]. Speech production can be spontaneous such as when a person creates the words of a [[conversation]], reactive such as when they name a picture or [[reading (process)|read]] aloud a [[writing|written word]], or imitative, such as in [[speech repetition]]. Speech production is not the same as [[language production]] since [[language]] can also be produced manually by [[sign language|sign]]s.

In ordinary fluent [[conversation]] people pronounce roughly four [[syllables]], ten or twelve [[phoneme]]s and two to three words out of their [[vocabulary]] (that can contain 10 to 100 thousand words) each second.&lt;ref name="Levelt99"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~rmk7/HC/HC_Readings/Levelt.pdf |pmid=10354575|year=1999|last1=Levelt|first1=WJ|title=Models of word production.|volume=3|issue=6|pages=223–232|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(99)01319-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Errors in speech production are relatively rare occurring at a rate of about once in every 900 words in spontaneous speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Garnham, A, Shillcock RC, Brown GDA, Mill AID, Culter A|year=1981|url=http://dare.ubn.kun.nl/bitstream/2066/15615/1/6017.pdf|title= Slips of the tongue in the London–Lund corpus of spontaneous conversation|journal=Linguistics |volume=19|pages=805–817|doi=10.1515/ling.1981.19.7-8.805|issue=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Words that are [[Frequency list|commonly spoken]] or learned early in life or easily imagined are quicker to say than ones that are rarely said, learnt later in life, or are abstract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Oldfield  RC, Wingfield  A |year=1965|title=Response latencies in naming objects|journal=Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology|volume=17|pages=273–281|doi=10.1080/17470216508416445|pmid=5852918|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://brm.psychonomic-journals.org/content/33/1/73.full.pdf|pmid=11296722|year=2001|last1=Bird|first1=H|last2=Franklin|first2=S|last3=Howard|first3=D|title=Age of acquisition and imageability ratings for a large set of words, including verbs and function words|volume=33|issue=1|pages=73–9|journal=Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, and Computers|doi=10.3758/BF03195349}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Normally speech is created with pulmonary pressure provided by the [[lung]]s that generates sound by [[phonation]] through the [[glottis]] in the [[larynx]] that then is modified by the [[vocal tract]] into different [[vowel]]s and [[consonant]]s. However speech production can occur without the use of the lungs and glottis in [[alaryngeal speech]] by using the upper parts of the vocal tract. An example of such alaryngeal speech is [[Donald Duck talk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=5163900|year=1971|last1=Weinberg|first1=B|last2=Westerhouse|first2=J|title=A study of buccal speech|volume=14|issue=3|pages=652–8|journal=Journal of Speech and Hearing Research|bibcode=1972ASAJ...51Q..91W|doi=10.1121/1.1981697}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vocal production of speech may be associated with the production of hand [[gestures]] that act to enhance the comprehensibility of what is being said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=McNeill D|year=2005|title=Gesture and Thought|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-51463-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of speech production throughout an individual's life starts from an infant's first babble and is transformed into fully developed speech by the age of five.&lt;ref name="Harley, T.A. 2011"&gt;Harley, T.A. (2011), Psycholinguistics. (Volume 1). SAGE Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; The first stage of speech doesn't occur until around age one (holophrastic phase). Between the ages of one and a half and two and a half the infant can produce short sentences (telegraphic phase). After two and a half years the infant develops systems of [[lemma (morphology)|lemma]]s used in speech production. Around four or five the child's lemmas are largely increased, this enhances the child's production of correct speech and they can now produce speech like an adult. An adult now develops speech in four stages: Activation of lexical concepts, select lemmas needed, [[morphology (linguistics)|morphologically]] and [[phonologically]] encode speech, and the word is phonetically encoded.&lt;ref name="Harley, T.A. 2011"/&gt;

==Three stages==
The production of [[spoken language]] involves three major levels of processing: conceptualization, formulation, and articulation.&lt;ref name="Levelt99" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Levelt89"&gt;{{cite book | last = Levelt | first = WJM | year = 1989 | title = Speaking: From Intention to Articulation | publisher = MIT Press | isbn = 978-0-262-62089-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jescheniak"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jescheniak | first1 = JD | last2 = Levelt | first2 = WJM | year = 1994 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.133.3919 | title = Word frequency effects in speech production: retrieval of syntactic information and of phonological form | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition | volume = 20 | pages = 824–843 | doi = 10.1037/0278-7393.20.4.824 | issue = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first is the processes of [[conceptualization]] or conceptual preparation, in which the intention  to create speech links a desired concept to the particular spoken words to be expressed. Here the preverbal intended messages are formulated that specify the concepts to be expressed.&lt;ref name="Neurocognition"&gt;Levelt, W. (1999). "The neurocognition of language", p.87 -117. Oxford Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The second stage is formulation in which the linguistic form required for the expression of the desired message is created. Formulation includes grammatical encoding, morpho-phonological encoding, and phonetic encoding.&lt;ref name="Neurocognition" /&gt; Grammatical encoding is the process of selecting the appropriate syntactic word or [[lemma (morphology)|lemma]]. The selected lemma then activates the appropriate [[Syntax|syntactic]] frame for the conceptualized message. Morpho-phonological encoding is the process of breaking words down into syllables to be produced in overt speech. Syllabification is dependent on the preceding and proceeding words, for instance:
''I-com-pre-hend'' vs. ''I-com-pre-hen-dit''.&lt;ref name="Neurocognition" /&gt;
The final part of the formulation stage is phonetic encoding. This involves the activation of [[articulatory gestures]] dependent on the syllables selected in the morpho-phonological process, creating an articulatory score as the utterance is pieced together and the order of movements of the [[vocal apparatus]] is completed.&lt;ref name="Neurocognition" /&gt;

The third stage of speech production is articulation, which is the execution of the articulatory score by the lungs, glottis, larynx, [[tongue]], [[lips]], [[jaw]] and other parts of the vocal apparatus resulting in speech.&lt;ref name="Levelt89" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Neurocognition" /&gt;
[[File:Blausen 0215 CerebralHemispheres.png|thumb|141x141px|For right handed people, the majority of speech production activity occurs in the left cerebral hemisphere.]]

==Neuroscience==

The [[motor control]] for speech production in [[right handed|right handed people]] depends mostly upon areas in the left [[cerebral hemisphere]]. These areas include the bilateral [[supplementary motor area]], the left posterior [[inferior frontal gyrus]], the left [[Insular cortex|insula]], the left [[primary motor cortex]] and [[temporal cortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2002.06.001|pmid=15037128|year=2004|last1=Indefrey|first1=P|last2=Levelt|first2=WJ|title=The spatial and temporal signatures of word production components|volume=92|issue=1–2|pages=101–44|journal=Cognition}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also subcortical areas involved such as the [[basal ganglia]] and [[cerebellum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=17189619|year=2007|last1=Booth|first1=JR|last2=Wood|first2=L|last3=Lu|first3=D|last4=Houk|first4=JC|last5=Bitan|first5=T|title=The role of the basal ganglia and cerebellum in language processing|volume=1133|issue=1|pages=136–44|doi=10.1016/j.brainres.2006.11.074|pmc=2424405|journal=Brain Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ackermann"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid= 18471906|year= 2008|last1= Ackermann|first1= H|title= Cerebellar contributions to speech production and speech perception: psycholinguistic and neurobiological perspectives|volume= 31|issue= 6|pages= 265–72|doi= 10.1016/j.tins.2008.02.011|journal= Trends in Neurosciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cerebellum aids the sequencing of speech syllables into fast, smooth and rhythmically organized words and longer utterances.&lt;ref name="Ackermann" /&gt;

==History of speech production research==
[[File:Speecherrorchart2.png|thumb|608x608px|Examples of speech errors. The target is what the speaker intended to say. The error is what the speaker actually said. These mistakes have been studied to learn about the structure of speech production.]]
Until the late 1960s research on speech was focused on comprehension. As researchers collected greater volumes of [[speech error]] data, they began to investigate the psychological processes responsible for the production of speech sounds and to contemplate possible processes for fluent speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fromkin|first1=Victoria|last2=Bernstein|first2=Nan|title=Speech Production Processing Models|date=1998|publisher=Harcourt Brace College|isbn=0155041061|page=327}}&lt;/ref&gt; Findings from speech error research were soon incorporated into speech production models. Evidence from speech error data supports the following conclusions about speech production.

Some of these ideas include:

# Speech is planned in advance.&lt;ref name="Chapter 7 Speech Production"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fromkin|first1=Victoria|last2=Berstien Ratner|first2=Nan|title=Chapter 7 Speech Production|publisher=Harcourt Brace College|isbn=0155041061|pages=322–327}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The [[lexicon]] is organized both semantically and phonologically.&lt;ref name="Chapter 7 Speech Production"/&gt; That is by meaning, and by the sound of the words.
# [[Morphology (linguistics)|Morphologically]] complex words are assembled.&lt;ref name="Chapter 7 Speech Production"/&gt; Words that we produce that contain morphemes are put together during the speech production process. [[Morpheme]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s are the smallest units of language that contain meaning. For example, "ed" on a past tense word.
# [[Affix]]es and  functors behave differently from context words in slips of the tongue.&lt;ref name="Chapter 7 Speech Production"/&gt; This means the rules about the ways in which a word can be used are likely stored with them, which means generally when speech errors are made, the mistake words maintain their functions and make grammatical sense.
# [[Speech error]]s reflect rule knowledge.&lt;ref name="Chapter 7 Speech Production"/&gt; Even in our mistakes, speech is not nonsensical. The words and sentences that are produced in speech errors are typically grammatical, and do not violate the rules of the language being spoken.

== Aspects of speech production models ==
Models of speech production must contain specific elements to be viable. These include the elements from which speech is composed, listed below. The accepted models of speech production discussed in more detail below all incorporate these stages either explicitly or implicitly, and the ones that are now outdated or disputed have been criticized for overlooking one or more of the following stages.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Field|first1=John|title=Psycholinguistics|date=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0415258901|page=284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attributes of accepted speech models are:

a) a conceptual stage where the speaker abstractly identifies what they wish to express.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

b) a syntactic stage where a frame is chosen that words will be placed into, this frame is usually [[Syntax|sentence structure]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

c) a lexical stage where a search for a word occurs based on meaning. Once the word is selected and retrieved, information about it becomes available to the speaker involving [[phonology]] and [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology.]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

d) a phonological stage where the abstract information is converted into a speech like form.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

e) a [[Phonetics|phonetic]] stage where instructions are prepared to be sent to the [[Vocal muscle|muscles of articulation]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Also, models must allow for forward planning mechanisms, a buffer, and a monitoring mechanism.

Following are a few of the influential models of speech production that account for or incorporate the previously mentioned stages and include information discovered as a result of speech error studies and other disfluency data,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fromkin|first1=Victoria|last2=Berstein|first2=Nan|title=Speech Production Processing Models|isbn=0155041061|page=328}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Tip of the tongue|tip-of-the-tongue]] research.

==Models==

===The Utterance Generator Model (1971)===

The Utterance Generator Model was proposed by Fromkin (1971).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fromkin|first1=Victoria|last2=Bernstein Ratner|first2=Nan|title=Chapter 7 Speech Production|date=1998|publisher=Harcourt Brace College Publishers|location=Florida|isbn=0155041061|pages=328–337|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is composed of six stages and was an attempt to account for the previous findings of speech error research. The stages of the Utterance Generator Model were based on possible changes in representations of a particular utterance. The first stage is where a person generates the meaning they wish to convey. The second stage involves the message being translated onto a syntactic structure. Here, the message is given an outline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fromkin|first1=Victoria|title=Utterance Generator Model of Speech Production in Psycho-linguistics|date=1971|publisher=Harcourt College Publishers|isbn=0155041061|page=328|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third stage proposed by Fromkin is where/when the message gains different stresses and intonations based on the meaning. The fourth stage Fromkin suggested  is concerned with the selection of words from the [[lexicon]]. After the words have been selected in Stage 4, the message undergoes phonological specification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fromkin|first1=Victoria|title=Utterance Generator Model of Speech Production in Psycho-linguistics|date=1998|publisher=Harcourt|page=330|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fifth stage applies rules of pronunciation and produces syllables that are to be outputted. The sixth and final stage of Fromkin's Utterance Generator Model is the coordination of the motor commands necessary for speech. Here, phonetic features of the message are sent to the relevant muscles of the vocal tract so that the intended message can be produced. Despite the ingenuity of Fromkin's model, researchers  have criticized this interpretation of speech production. Although The Utterance Generator Model accounts for many nuances and data found by speech error studies, researchers decided it still had room to be improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garrett|title=The Garrett Model in Psycho-linguistics|date=1975|publisher=Harcourt College|isbn=0155041061|page=331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Butterworth|title=Psycho-linguistics|date=1982|publisher=Harcourt College|page=331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Garrett model (1975)===

A more recent (than Fromkin's) attempt to explain speech production was published by Garrett in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fromkin|first1=Victoria|last2=Berstein|first2=Nan|title=The Garret Model in Psycho-linguistics|date=1998|publisher=Harcourt College|isbn=0155041061|page=331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garrett also created this model by compiling speech error data and there are many overlaps between this model and the Fromkin model off which it was based, but he did add a few things to the Fromkin model that filled some of the gaps being pointed out by other researchers. The Garrett Model and the Fromkin model both distinguish between three levels—a conceptual level, and sentence level, and a motor level. These three levels are common to contemporary understanding of Speech Production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garrett|last2=Fromkin|first2=V.A.|last3=Ratner|first3=N.B|title=The Garrett Model in Psycho-linguistics|date=1998|publisher=Harcourt College|page=331}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Moraghfigure4.png|thumb|240x240px|This is an interpretation of the Dell's model. The  words at the top represent the semantic category. The second level represents the words that describe the semantic category. And, the third level represents the phonemes ( syllabic information including onset, vowels, and codas).]]

===Dell's model (1994)===

In 1994,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Psycholinguistics/Models of Speech Production - Wikiversity|url = https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Psycholinguistics/Models_of_Speech_Production|website = en.wikiversity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dell proposed a model of the lexical network that became fundamental in the understanding of the way speech is produced.&lt;ref name="Levelt99" /&gt; This model of the lexical network attempts to symbolically represent the lexicon, and in turn, explain how people choose the words they wish to produce, and how those words are to be organized into speech. Dell's model was composed of three stages, semantics, words, and phonemes. The  words in the highest stage of the model represent the semantic category. (In the image, the words representing semantic category are winter, footwear, feet, and snow represent the semantic categories of boot and skate.) The second level represents the words that describe the semantic category (In the image, boot and skate). And, the third level represents the phonemes ( [[Syllable|syllabic information]] including [[Onset (linguistics)|onset]], vowels, and codas).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Analysis of Sentence Production|last = Dell|first = G.S.|date = 1997|journal = Psychology of Learning and Motivation|doi = 10.1016/S0079-7421(08)60270-4|pmid = |pages=133–177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Levelt model (1999) ===

Levelt further refined the lexical network proposed by Dell. Through the use of speech error data, Levelt recreated the three levels in Dell's model. The conceptual stratum, the top and most abstract level, contains information a person has about ideas of particular concepts.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=6&amp;sid=d6b00eb6-6f33-46fd-9144-85377e4868eb%40sessionmgr198&amp;hid=126&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=000080761300003&amp;db=edswsc|title = Models of Word Production|last = Levelt|first = Willem J.M|date = 1999|journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences|doi = 10.1016/S1364-6613(99)01319-4|pmid = 10354575|access-date = 25 October 2015|volume=3|pages=223–232}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conceptual stratum also contains ideas about how concepts relate to each other. This is where word selection would occur, a person would choose which words they wish to express. The next, or middle level, the [[Lemma (morphology)|lemma]]-stratum, contains information about the syntactic functions of individual words including [[Tense (grammar)|tense]] and function.&lt;ref name="Levelt99" /&gt;  This level functions to maintain syntax and place words correctly into sentence structure that makes sense to the speaker.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The lowest and final level is the form stratum which, similarly to the Dell Model, contains syllabic information. From here, the information stored at the form stratum level is sent to the motor cortex where the vocal apparatus are coordinated to physically produce speech sounds.

==Places of articulation==
{{main|Place of articulation}}
[[File:Illu01 head neck.jpg|thumb|Human vocal apparatus used to produce speech|left|168x168px]]
The physical structure of the human nose, throat, and vocal cords allows for the productions of many unique sounds, these areas can be further broken down into [[Place of articulation|places of articulation]]. Different sounds are produced in different areas, and with different muscles and breathing techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Consonantal Place of Articulation|last = Keren, Rice|publisher = John Wily &amp; Sons Inc.|year = 2011|isbn = 978-1-4443-3526-2|location = |pages = 519–549}}&lt;/ref&gt; Our ability to utilize these skills to create the various sounds needed to communicate effectively is essential to our speech production. Speech is a psychomotor activity. Speech between two people is a [[conversation]] - they can be casual, formal, factual, or transactional, and the language structure/ narrative genre employed differs depending upon the context. Affect is a significant factor that  controls speech, manifestations that disrupt memory in language use due to affect include feelings of tension, states of apprehension, as well as physical signs like nausea. Language level manifestations that affect brings could be observed with the speaker's hesitations, repetitions, false starts, incompletion, syntactic blends, etc. Difficulties in [[manner of articulation]] can contribute to speech difficulties and [[Speech impediment|impediments]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Speech Disorders : Causes, Treatments, and Social Effects|last = Harrison|first = Allen. E|publisher = Nova Science Publishers|year = 2011|isbn = 9781608762132|location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is suggested that infants are capable of making the entire spectrum of possible vowel and consonant sounds. [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] has created a system for understanding and categorizing all possible speech sounds, which includes information about the way in which the sound is produced, and where the sounds is produced.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This is extremely useful in the understanding of speech production because speech can be transcribed based on sounds rather than spelling, which may be misleading depending on the language being spoken. Average speaking rates are in the 120 to 150 words per minute (wpm) range, and same is the recommended guidelines for recording audiobooks. As people grow accustomed to a particular language they are prone to lose not only the ability to produce certain speech sounds, but also to distinguish between these sounds.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Articulation===
Articulation, often associated with speech production, is the term used to describe how people physically produced speech sounds. For people who speak fluently, articulation is automatic and allows 15 speech sounds to be produced per second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Field|first1=John|title=Psycholinguistics The Key Concepts|date=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0415258901|pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An effective articulation of speech include the following elements – fluency, complexity, accuracy, and comprehensibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rebecca Hughes|author2=Beatrice Szczepek Reed|title=Teaching and Researching Speaking: Third Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cC4lDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA6|year=2016|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-43299-9|pages=6+}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Fluency: Is the ability to communicate an intended message, or to affect the listener in the way that is intended by the speaker. While accurate use of language is a component in this ability, over-attention to accuracy may actually inhibit the development of fluency. Fluency involves constructing coherent utterances and stretches of speech, to respond and to speak without undue hesitation (limited use of fillers such as uh, er, eh, like, you know). It also involves the ability to use strategies such as simplification and gestures to aid communication. Fluency involves use of relevant information, appropriate vocabulary and [[syntax]].  

*Complexity: Speech where the message is communicated precisely. Ability to adjust the message or negotiate the control of conversation according to the responses of the listener, and use subordination and clausal forms appropriate per the roles and relationship between the speakers. It includes the use of sociolinguistic knowledge – the skills required to communicate effectively across cultures; the norms, the knowledge of what is appropriate to say in what situations and to whom.

*Accuracy: This refers to the use of proper and advanced grammar; subject-verb agreement; word order; and word form (excited/exciting), as well as appropriate word choice in spoken language. It is also the ability to self-correct during discourse, to clarify or modify spoken language for grammatical accuracy.

*Comprehensibility: This is the ability to be understood by others, it is related with the sound of the language.  There are three components that influence one’s comprehensibility and they are: ''Pronunciation'' – saying the sounds of words correctly; ''Intonation'' – applying proper stress on words and syllables, using rising and falling pitch to indicate questions or statements, using voice to indicate emotion or emphasis, speaking with an appropriate rhythm; and ''Enunciation'' – speaking clearly at an appropriate pace, with effective articulation of words and phrases and appropriate volume.

==Development==
{{main|Language acquisition}}
Before even producing a sound, infants imitate facial expressions and movements.&lt;ref name="Redford, M. A. 2015"&gt;Redford, M. A. (2015). The handbook of speech production. Chichester, West Sussex ; Malden, MA : John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 7 months of age, infants start to experiment with communicative sounds by trying to coordinate producing sound with opening and closing their mouths.

Until the first year of life infants cannot produce coherent words, instead they produce a reoccurring [[babbling]] sound. Babbling allows the infant to experiment with articulating sounds without having to attend to meaning. This repeated babbling starts the initial production of speech. Babbling works with [[object permanence]] and understanding of location to support the networks of our first [[lexical (semiotics)|lexical]] items or words.&lt;ref name="Harley, T.A. 2011"/&gt; The infant’s vocabulary growth increases substantially when they are able to understand that objects exist even when they are not present.

The first stage of meaningful speech does not occur until around the age of one. This stage is the holophrastic phase.&lt;ref name="Shaffer, D. 2005"&gt;Shaffer, D., Wood, E., &amp; Willoughby, T. (2005). Developmental Psychology Childhood and Adolescence. (2nd Canadian Ed). Nelson.&lt;/ref&gt; The holistic stage refers to when infant speech consists of one word at a time (i.e. papa).

The next stage is the telegraphic phase. In this stage infants can form short sentences (i.e., Daddy sit, or Mommy drink). This typically occurs between the ages of one and a half and two and a half years old. This stage is particularly noteworthy because of the explosive growth of their [[lexicon]]. During this stage, infants must select and match stored representations of words to the specific perceptual target word in order to convey meaning or concepts.&lt;ref name="Redford, M. A. 2015"/&gt; With enough vocabulary, infants begin to extract sound patterns, and they learn to break down words into [[phonological]] segments, increasing further the number of words they can learn.&lt;ref name="Harley, T.A. 2011"/&gt; At this point in an infant's development of speech their lexicon consists of 200 words or more and they are able to understand even more than they can speak.&lt;ref name="Shaffer, D. 2005"/&gt;
 
When they reach two and a half years their speech production becomes increasingly complex, particularly in its semantic structure. With a more detailed [[semantic network]] the infant learns to express a wider range of meanings, helping the infant develop a complex conceptual system of [[lemma (psycholinguistics)|lemma]]s.

Around the age of four or five the child lemmas have a wide range of diversity, this helps them select the right lemma needed to produce correct speech.&lt;ref name="Harley, T.A. 2011"/&gt; Reading to infants enhances their lexicon. At this age, children who have been read to and are exposed to more uncommon and complex words have 32 million more words than a child who is [[linguistically]] impoverished.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, M. (2005). Proust and the squid:The story and science of the reading brain, New York, NY. Harper&lt;/ref&gt; At this age the child should be able to speak in full complete sentences, similar to an adult.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6290">:''Not to be confused with [[tensor product]]s of [[spin representation]]s.''

In [[mathematics]], [[mathematical physics]], and [[theoretical physics]], the '''spin tensor''' is a quantity used to describe the rotational motion of particles in [[spacetime]]. The tensor has application in 
[[general relativity]] and [[special relativity]], as well as [[quantum mechanics]], [[relativistic quantum mechanics]], and [[quantum field theory]].

The [[Euclidean group]] SE(d) of [[Euclidean group#Direct and indirect isometries|direct isometries]] is generated by [[translation]]s and [[rotation]]s. Its [[Lie algebra]] is written &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{se}(d)&lt;/math&gt;.

This article uses [[Cartesian coordinates]] and [[tensor index notation]].

==Background on Noether currents==

The [[Noether current]] for translations in space is momentum, while the current for increments in time is energy. These two statements combine into one in spacetime: translations in spacetime, i.e. a displacement between two events, is generated by the four-momentum ''P''. Conservation of four-momentum is given by the [[continuity equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_\nu T^{\mu\nu}=0\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;T^{\mu\nu} \,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[stress–energy tensor]], and ∂ are [[partial derivative]]s that make up the [[four gradient]] (in non-Cartesian coordinates this must be replaced by the [[covariant derivative]]). Integrating over spacetime:

:&lt;math&gt;\int d^4 x T^{\mu 0}(\vec{x},t) = P^\mu&lt;/math&gt;

gives the [[four-momentum]] vector at time ''t''.

The Noether current for a rotation about the point ''y'' is given by a tensor of 3rd order, denoted &lt;math&gt;M^{\alpha\beta\mu}_y&lt;/math&gt;. Because of the [[Lie algebra]] relations

:&lt;math&gt;M^{\alpha\beta\mu}_y(x)=M^{\alpha\beta\mu}_0(x)+y^\alpha T^{\beta\mu}(x)-y^\beta T^{\alpha\mu}(x)\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where the 0 subscript indicates the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]] (unlike momentum, angular momentum depends on the origin), the integral:

:&lt;math&gt;\int d^4 x M^{\mu\nu}_0(\vec{x},t)&lt;/math&gt;

gives the angular momentum tensor &lt;math&gt;M^{\mu\nu} \,&lt;/math&gt; at time ''t''.

==Definition==

The '''spin tensor''' is defined at a point '''x''' to be the value of the Noether current at '''x''' of a rotation about ''x'',

:&lt;math&gt;S^{\alpha\beta\mu}(\mathbf{x})\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\   M^{\alpha\beta\mu}_x(\mathbf{x})=M^{\alpha\beta\mu}_0(\mathbf{x})+x^\alpha T^{\beta\mu}(\mathbf{x})-x^\beta T^{\alpha\mu}(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt;

The continuity equation

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_\mu M^{\alpha\beta\mu}_0=0\,,&lt;/math&gt;

implies:

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_\mu S^{\alpha\beta\mu}=T^{\beta\alpha}-T^{\alpha\beta} \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;

and therefore, the [[stress–energy tensor]] is not a [[symmetric tensor]].

The quantity ''S'' is the density of [[spin (physics)|spin]] angular momentum (spin in this case is not only for a point-like particle, but also for an extended body), and ''M'' is the density of orbital angular momentum. The total angular momentum is always the sum of spin and orbital contributions.

The relation:

:&lt;math&gt; T_{ij} - T_{ji} &lt;/math&gt;

gives the [[torque]] density showing the rate of conversion between the orbital angular momentum and spin.

==Examples==

Examples of materials with a nonzero spin density are [[molecular fluid]]s, the [[electromagnetic field]] and [[turbulent fluid]]s. For molecular fluids, the individual molecules may be spinning. The electromagnetic field can have [[circularly polarized light]]. For turbulent fluids, we may arbitrarily make a distinction between long wavelength phenomena and short wavelength phenomena. A long wavelength [[vorticity]] may be converted via turbulence into tinier and tinier vortices transporting the angular momentum into smaller and smaller wavelengths while simultaneously reducing the [[vorticity]]. This can be approximated by the [[eddy viscosity]].

Following Altshuller's insight, the theory developed on a foundation of extensive research covering hundreds of thousands of inventions across many different fields to produce a theory which defines generalisable patterns in the nature of inventive solutions and the distinguishing characteristics of the problems that these inventions have overcome&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vidal|first=Rosario|last2=Salmeron|first2=Jose L.|last3=Mena|first3=Angel|last4=Chulvi|first4=Vicente|title=Fuzzy Cognitive Map-based selection of TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving) trends for eco-innovation of ceramic industry products|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.04.131|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|volume=107|pages=202–214|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.04.131}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

An important part of the theory has been devoted to revealing patterns of [[evolution (disambiguation)|evolution]] and one of the objectives which has been pursued by leading practitioners of TRIZ has been the development of an [[algorithm|algorithmic approach]] to the invention of new [[system]]s, and to the refinement of existing ones.

TRIZ includes a practical [[methodology]], tool sets, a [[knowledge base]], and model-based technology for generating innovative solutions for [[problem solving]]. It is useful for problem formulation, [[system analysis]], [[failure analysis]], and patterns of system evolution.  There is a general similarity of purposes and methods with the field of [[pattern language]], a cross discipline practice for explicitly describing and sharing holistic patterns of design.

The research has produced three primary findings:
# problems and solutions are repeated across industries and sciences
# patterns of technical evolution are also repeated across industries and sciences
# the innovations used scientific effects outside the field in which they were developed

TRIZ practitioners apply all these findings in order to create and to improve products, services, and systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.triz-journal.com/whatistriz.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111201172928/http://www.triz-journal.com/whatistriz.htm |archivedate=2011-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
TRIZ in its classical form was developed by the Soviet inventor and science fiction writer Genrich Altshuller and his associates.
He started developing TRIZ in 1946 while working in the "Inventions Inspection" department of the [[Caspian Sea Flotilla|Caspian Sea flotilla]] of the [[Soviet Navy]]. His job was to help with the initiation of invention proposals, to rectify and document them, and to prepare applications to the patent office. During this time he realised that a problem requires an inventive solution if there is an unresolved contradiction in the sense that improving one parameter impacts negatively on another. He later called these "technical contradictions".

His work on what later resulted in TRIZ was interrupted in 1950 by his arrest and sentencing to 25 years in the [[Vorkuta]] [[Gulag|Gulag labor camps]]. The arrest was partially triggered by letters which he and Raphael Shapiro sent to [[Josef stalin|Stalin]], ministers and newspapers about certain decisions made by the Soviet Government, which they believed were erroneous.&lt;ref name="dotrubiog"&gt;{{cite web|title=Генрих Саулович Альтшуллер (Genrich Saulovich Altshuller - short biography)|url=http://www.altshuller.ru/biography/|publisher=www.altshuller.ru|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104001718/http://www.altshuller.ru/biography|archivedate=2010-11-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Altshuller and Shapiro were freed during the [[Khrushchev Thaw]] following Stalin's death in 1953 &lt;ref name=Salon1 /&gt; and returned to [[Baku]].

The first paper on TRIZ titled "On the psychology of inventive creation" was published in 1956 in "Issues in Psychology" (Voprosi Psichologii) journal.&lt;ref name="1956VP"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Altshuller|first=G. S.|author2=Shapiro, R.

By 1969, Altshuller had reviewed about 40,000 [[patent]] abstracts in order to find out in what way the [[innovation]] had taken place and developed the concept of technical contradictions, the concept of ideality of a system, contradiction matrix, and [[40 principles of invention]]. In the years that followed he developed the concepts of physical contradictions, SuField analysis (structural substance-field analysis), standard solutions, several [[laws of technical systems evolution]], and numerous other theoretical and practical approaches.

Altshuller also observed clever and creative people at work: he uncovered patterns in their thinking, and developed thinking tools and techniques to model this "talented thinking". These tools include Smart Little People&lt;ref&gt;[reference to p 110] Alshuller, G.S. (1984) [http://matriz.org/resources/literature/ Creativity as an Exact Science: the Theory of the Solution of Inventive Problems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530025029/http://matriz.org/resources/literature/ |date=2015-05-30 }} Translated by Williams, A. Gordon and Breach Science Publishers Inc]&lt;/ref&gt; and Thinking in Time and Scale (or the Screens of Talented Thought).&lt;ref&gt;[reference to p 121] Alshuller, G.S. (1984) Creativity as an Exact Science: the Theory of the Solution of Inventive Problems Translated by Williams, A. Gordon and Breach Science Publishers Inc]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971 Altshuller convinced The Inventors Society to establish in Baku the first TRIZ teaching facility, called the Azerbaijan Public Institute for Inventive Creation and the first TRIZ research lab called The Public Lab for Inventive Creation. Altshuller was appointed the head of the lab by the society. The lab incubated the TRIZ movement and in the years that followed other TRIZ teaching institutes were established in all major cities of the USSR.

From 1986 Altshuller switched his attention away from technical TRIZ, and started investigating the development of individual creativity. He also developed a version of TRIZ for children, which was trialled in various schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.xtriz.com/BriefHistoryOfTRIZ.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922153214/http://www.xtriz.com/BriefHistoryOfTRIZ.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 the TRIZ Association was formed, with Altshuller chosen as President.

Following the end of the [[cold war]], the waves of emigrants from the former Soviet Union brought TRIZ to other countries and drew attention to it overseas.&lt;ref name="Webb1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Webb|first=Alan|title=TRIZ: an inventive approach to invention|journal=Manufacturing Engineer|date=August 2002|pages=171–177}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 the Altshuller Institute for TRIZ Studies was established in [[Boston, MA|Boston]], USA.

== Basic principles ==

TRIZ presents a systematic approach for understanding and defining challenging problems: difficult problems require an inventive solution, and TRIZ provides a range of strategies and tools for finding these inventive solutions. One of the earliest findings of the massive research on which the theory is based is that the vast majority of problems that require inventive solutions typically reflect a need to overcome a dilemma or a trade-off between two contradictory elements. The central purpose of TRIZ-based analysis is to systematically apply the strategies and tools to find superior solutions that overcome the need for a compromise or trade-off between the two elements.

[[File:Prism of TRIZ Oxford Creativity.png|thumb|Prism of TRIZ]]
By the early 1970s two decades of research covering hundreds of thousands of patents had confirmed Altshuller's initial insight about the patterns of inventive solutions and one of the first analytical tools was published in the form of 40 inventive principles, which could account for virtually all of those patents that presented truly inventive solutions. Following this approach the "Conceptual solution" shown in the diagram can be found by defining the contradiction which needs to be resolved and systematically considering which of the 40 principles may be applied to provide a specific solution which will overcome the "contradiction" in the problem at hand, enabling a solution that is closer to the "ultimate ideal result".

[[File:Contradictions Matrix image.jpg|thumb|Contradictions Matrix]]
The combination of all of these concepts together – the analysis of the contradiction, the pursuit of an ideal solution and the search for one or more of the principles which will overcome the contradiction, are the key elements in a process which is designed to help the inventor to engage in the process with purposefulness and focus.

[[File:40_principles_of_TRIZ_method_720dpi.jpg|thumb|40 principles of TRIZ method rendered schematically]]

One of the tools which evolved as an extension of the 40 principles was a contradiction matrix&lt;ref name="triz.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.triz.co.uk/pwpcontrol.php?pwpID=13122|title=Contradictions Matrix - TRIZ Tools Oxford Creativity|website=www.triz.co.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522141958/http://www.triz.co.uk/pwpcontrol.php?pwpID=13122|archivedate=2015-05-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the contradictory elements of a problem were categorized according to a list of 39 factors which could impact on each other. The combination of each pairing of these 39 elements is set out in a matrix (for example, the weight of a stationary object, the use of energy by a moving object, the ease of repair etc.) Each of the 39 elements is represented down the rows and across the columns (as the negatively affected element) and based upon the research and analysis of patents: wherever precedent solutions have been found that resolve a conflict between two of the elements, the relevant cells in the matrix typically contain a sub-set of three or four principles that have been applied most frequently in inventive solutions which resolve contradictions between those two elements.

The main objective of the contradiction matrix was to simplify the process of selecting the most appropriate Principle to resolve a specific contradiction. It was the core of all modifications of ARIZ till 1973. But in 1973, after introducing the concept of physical contradictions and creating SuField analysis, Altshuller realized that the contradiction matrix was comparatively an inefficient tool and stopped working on it. Beginning ARIZ-71c contradiction matrix ceased to be the core of ARIZ and therefore was not a tool for solving inventive problems that Altshuller believed should be pursued.

Physical contradictions and separation principles as well as SuField analysis, etc. became the core. Despite this, the [[40 principles of invention]] has remained the most popular tool taught in introductory seminars and has consistently attracted the most attention amongst the tens of thousands of individuals who visit TRIZ-focused web sites in a typical month. Therefore,  many of those who learn TRIZ or have attended seminars are taught quite wrongly that TRIZ is primarily composed of the 40 principles and contradiction matrix, the truth is ARIZ is the core methodology of TRIZ.

[[TRIZ#ARIZ - algorithm of inventive problems solving|ARIZ]] is an algorithmic approach to finding inventive solutions by identifying and resolving contradictions. This includes the "system of inventive standards solutions" which Altshuller used to replace the 40 principles and contradiction matrix, it consists of SuField modeling and the 76 inventive standards. A number of TRIZ-based computer programs have been developed whose purpose is to provide assistance to engineers and inventors in finding inventive solutions for technological problems. Some of these programs are also designed to apply another TRIZ methodology whose purpose is to reveal and forecast emergency situations and to anticipate circumstances which could result in undesirable outcomes.

One of the important branches of TRIZ is focused on analysing and predicting trends of evolution in the characteristics that existing solutions are likely to develop in successive generations of a system.

== Essentials ==

===Basic terms===
*''Ideal final result'' (IFR) - the ultimate idealistic solution of a problem when the desired result is achieved by itself. Note that the Ideal Final Result is also an ARIZ term for the formulation of the inventive problem in the form of a Technical Contradiction (IFR-1) and a Physical Contradiction (IFR-2);
*''Administrative contradiction'' - contradiction between the needs and abilities;
*''Technical contradiction'' - an inverse dependence between parameters/characteristics of a machine or technology;
*''Physical contradiction'' - opposite/contradictory physical requirements to an object;
*''Separation principle'' - a method of resolving physical contradictions by separating contradictory requirements;
*''Vepol'' or ''Su-field'' - a minimal technical system consisting of two material objects (substances) and a "field". "Field" is the source of energy whereas one of the substances is "transmission" and the other one is the "tool";
*''Fepol'' or ''Ferfiel'' - a sort of Vepol (Su-field) where "substances" are ferromagnetic objects;
*''[[Level of invention]]'';
*''Standard solution'' - a standard inventive solution of a higher level;
*''[[Laws of technical systems evolution]]'';
*''[[Algorithm of inventive problems solving]] (ARIZ), which combines various specialized methods of TRIZ into one universal tool'';
*''Talented Thinking or Thinking in Time and Scale'';
*Effect : Scientific knowledge to solve problem listed by not alphabetical order but functional order

=== Identifying a problem: contradictions ===
Altshuller has shown that at the heart of some inventive problems lie [[contradiction]]s (one of the basic TRIZ concepts) between two or more elements, such as, "If we want more acceleration, we need a larger engine; but that will increase the cost of the car," that is, more of something desirable also brings more of something less desirable, or less of something else also desirable.

These are called ''technical contradictions'' by Altshuller. He also defined so-called physical or inherent contradictions: More of one thing and less of the same thing may both be desired in the same system. For instance, a higher temperature may be needed to melt a compound more rapidly, but a lower temperature may be needed to achieve a homogeneous mixture.

An ''inventive situation'' which challenges us to be inventive, might involve several such contradictions. Conventional solutions typically "trade"  one contradictory parameter for another; no special inventiveness is needed for that. Rather, the inventor would develop a creative approach for resolving the contradiction, such as inventing an engine that produces more acceleration without increasing the cost of the engine.

===Inventive principles and the matrix of contradictions===
Altshuller screened patents in order to find out what kind of contradictions were resolved or dissolved by the invention and the way this had been achieved. From this he developed a set of 40 inventive principles and later a matrix of contradictions.&lt;ref name="triz.co.uk"/&gt; Rows of the matrix indicate the 39 system features that one typically wants to improve, such as speed, weight, accuracy of measurement and so on. Columns refer to typical undesired results. Each matrix cell points to principles that have been most frequently used in patents in order to resolve the contradiction.

For instance, Dolgashev mentions the following contradiction: increasing accuracy of measurement of machined balls while avoiding the use of expensive microscopes and elaborate control equipment. The matrix cell in row "accuracy of measurement" and column "complexity of control" points to several principles, among them the Copying Principle, which states, "Use a simple and inexpensive optical copy with a suitable scale instead of an object that is complex, expensive, fragile or inconvenient to operate." From this general invention principle, the following idea might solve the problem: Taking a high-resolution image of the machined ball. A screen with a grid might provide the required measurement. As mentioned above, Altshuller abandoned this method of defining and solving "technical" contradictions in the mid 1980s and instead used SuField modeling and the 76 inventive standards and a number of other tools included in the algorithm for solving inventive problems, ARIZ.

===Laws of technical system evolution===
{{Main|Laws of technical systems evolution}}

Altshuller also studied the way technical systems have been developed and improved over time. From this, he discovered several trends (so called Laws of Technical Systems Evolution) that help engineers predict the most likely improvements that can be made to a given product. The most important of these laws involves the ideality of a system.

===Substance-field analysis===

One more technique that is frequently used by inventors involves the analysis of substances, fields and other resources that are currently not being used and that can be found within the system or nearby. TRIZ uses non-standard definitions for substances and fields. Altshuller developed methods to analyze resources; several of his invention principles involve the use of different substances and fields that help resolve contradictions and increase ideality of a technical system. For instance, [[videotex]]t systems used television signals to transfer data, by taking advantage of the small time segments between TV frames in the signals.

SuField analysis produces a structural model of the initial technological system, exposes its characteristics, and with the help of special laws, transforms the model of the problem. Through this transformation the structure of the solution that eliminates the shortcomings of the initial problem is revealed. SuField analysis is a special language of formulas with which it is possible to easily describe any technological system in terms of a specific (structural) model. A model produced in this manner is transformed according to special laws and regularities, thereby revealing the structural solution of the problem.

===ARIZ - algorithm of inventive problems solving===

ARIZ (Russian acronym of алгоритм решения изобретательских задач - АРИЗ) (algorithm of inventive problems solving) is a list of about 85 step-by-step procedures to solve complicated invention problems, where other tools of TRIZ alone (Sufield analysis, 40 inventive principles, etc.) are not sufficient.

Various TRIZ software (see [[Invention Machine]]'s Goldfire, ideation international, Guided Innovation Toolkit, TriSolver, Innovation Suite, TRIZ GB) are based on this algorithm.

Starting with an updated matrix of contradictions, semantic analysis, subcategories of inventive principles and lists of scientific effects, some new interactive applications are other attempts to simplify the problem formulation phase and the transition from a generic problem to a whole set of specific solutions. (See the external links for details.)

===Use of TRIZ on Management Problems===
Although TRIZ was developed from the analysis of technical systems, it has been used widely as a method for understanding and solving complex management problems. Examples include finding additional cost savings for the legal department of a local government body: the inventive solution generated was to generate additional revenue [insert reference to cost-cutting in local government case study]. The results of the TRIZ work are expected to generate £1.7 m in profit in the first 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legalbusiness.co.uk/index.php/lb-blog-view/2727-the-overall-benefits-are-potentially-enormous-bucks-county-council-granted-abs-licence-with-emergency-services-group |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810060018/http://www.legalbusiness.co.uk/index.php/lb-blog-view/2727-the-overall-benefits-are-potentially-enormous-bucks-county-council-granted-abs-licence-with-emergency-services-group |archivedate=2014-08-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Use of TRIZ methods in industry==
Case studies on the use of TRIZ are difficult to acquire as many companies believe TRIZ gives them a competitive advantage and are reluctant to publicise their adoption of the method. However some examples are available: Samsung is the most famous success story, and has invested heavily in embedding TRIZ use throughout the company, right up to and including the CEO; "In 2003 TRIZ led to 50 new patents for Samsung and in 2004 one project alone, a DVD pick-up innovation, saved Samsung over $100 million. TRIZ is now an obligatory skill set if you want to advance within Samsung".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/haydnshaughnessy/2013/03/07/why-is-samsung-such-an-innovative-company/2/|title=What Makes Samsung Such An Innovative Company?|first=Haydn|last=Shaughnessy|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180220152921/https://www.forbes.com/sites/haydnshaughnessy/2013/03/07/why-is-samsung-such-an-innovative-company/2/|archivedate=2018-02-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

The application of TRIZ tools in numerous German industrial companies in the recent decade has followed the principles of the [[Advanced Innovation Design Approach]], which recommends application of the selected TRIZ tools in the early stage of the innovation process for the identification of customer needs, comprehensive problem definition and ideation, new concept development and optimization.

"'''The Esoteric Character of the Gospels'''" is an article published in three parts: in November-December 1887, and in February 1888, in the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] magazine [[Lucifer (magazine)|''Lucifer'']]; it was written by [[Helena Blavatsky]].{{refn|group=note|''Lucifer,'' Vol. 1, November 1887, p. 173–80; December 1887, p. 299–309; February 1888, p. 490–96.{{sfn|Index}}}} It was included in the 8th volume of the author's ''Collected Writings.''{{sfn|Price|1985}} In 1888, for this work, the author was awarded [[Tallapragada Subba Row|Subba Row]] medal.{{sfn|Theowiki}}{{refn|group=note|When the [[Theosophical Society]] was created, the encouraging of "the study of [[comparative religion]], philosophy, and science" was proclaimed his second major task.{{sfn|Kuhn|1992}}}}

== Analysis of contents ==
=== Versus clerics ===
An American author [[Gary Lachman]], noting Blavatsky's "animus toward the Judeo-Christian ethos," has cited her article in which she writes that "[[Christianity]] is now the religion of arrogance ''par excellence,'' a stepping-stone for ambition, a sinecure for wealth, sham and power; a convenient screen for hypocrisy."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=176|Lachman|2012|2p=112}} A Russian Indologist [[Alexander Senkevich]] has noted that she did not make secrets out of her "skeptical attitude towards the [[Gospel]]s," considering them unrelated to either [[Jesus]] or his [[Apostles]].{{sfn|Сенкевич|2012|p=297}}{{refn|group=note|Noting in church Christianity the dogmatism generated by the "painful ambition of its hierarchs," Blavatsky regarded it exclusively as a religious sanctification of "power over people."{{sfn|Сенкевич|2012|p=298}}}} Joseph Tyson wrote in his book that, according to Blavatsky, for example, in the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] camp there are 350 dissenting [[sect]]s, and she commented that if "one of these may have the approximate truth, still 349 must be necessarily false."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=175|Tyson|2006|2p=384}} A Russian philosopher Lydia Fesenkova wrote that, in Blavatsky's opinion, the Christian sacred books are "magazines of falsehoods," and all of them have served {{quote|"as a means for securing power and of supporting the ambitious policy of an unscrupulous priesthood. All have promoted superstition, all made of their gods blood-thirsty and ever-damning Molochs and fiends, as all have made nations to serve the latter more than the God of Truth."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1pp=179–80|Фесенкова|2001|2p=18}}}}

Professor [[Robert Ellwood]] wrote that Blavatsky was a ruthless critic of the church tradition of Christianity, whether in relation to "the [[Church Fathers]] or modern priests, pastors and missionaries." The reason for her hostility to church Christianity "was what she perceived as arrogance combined with misplaced concreteness." She believed that "churchmen, past and present, whether through intentional deceit or mere stupidity, had concealed the real origin and meaning of Christianity as a vehicle of the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|ancient wisdom]]."{{sfn|Ellwood}}

=== Historical Jesus ===
A Russian orthodox theologian, Dimitry Drujinin wrote that in her article Blavatsky calls [[Lod|Lüd]] as the "hometown" of Jesus. This indicates that she supported the statements of [[Talmud]] that Jesus was the [[Yeshu|son of a man named Pandira]] and "lived a hundred years before the beginning of the Gospel events." In his youth, he lived for many years in Egypt, where he "was initiated" in esoteric wisdom. After returning to Palestine, he reorganized the movement of the [[Essenes]], who worshipped him as a teacher. Slandered by his enemies, he was killed in his hometown. Drujinin quotes the article with "He was stoned and then crucified on a tree, on the eve of [[Passover]]."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=189|Дружинин|2012|2p=68}}

=== Chrestos and Christos ===
Drujinin wrote that, according to Blavatsky, it is necessary to distinguish between Chrêstos and [[Christ (title)|Christos]] (Christ). The first name, in hers opinion, means neophyte who approaching to Initiation, and the second one she defines in this way: "Christ— the true esoteric [[Salvation in Christianity|'''Saviour''']]—is no man, but the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|'''Divine Principle''']] in every human being."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=173|Дружинин|2012|2p=66}}{{refn|group=note|"'''Chrestes''', '''Chrestos''' (Greek). Applied by the Greeks as a title of respect equivalent to 'the worthy.' Chrestes meant an interpreter of oracles. In the language of the [[Greco-Roman mysteries|Mysteries]], a chrestos was a candidate or neophyte, and a christos (anointed) was an initiate. Christ is a mystical expression for the human [[Ātman (Hinduism)|inner god]], while chrest is the good but as yet unregenerated nature."{{sfn|Glossary|1999|loc=Chrestes}}}} Drujinin added that she believes that Christians have lost the understanding of the true meaning of the word Christos: "The very meaning of the terms Chrêstos and Christos, and the bearing of both on 'Jesus of Nazareth,' a name coined out of Joshua the Nazar, has now become a dead letter for all with the exception of non-Christian Occultists."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=215|Дружинин|2012|2p=67}} He wrote that Christians, according to Blavatsky, only afterwards unfairly put aside "all the other Chrêstoi, who have appeared to them as rivals of their Man-God."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=205|Дружинин|2012|2p=67}} The Russian ''Encyclopedia of Sages, Mystics, and Magicians'' wrote that in her article Blavatsky "allegorically" proclaims: "Christos was 'the '''Way''',' while Chrêstos was the lonely traveller journeying on to reach the ultimate goal through that 'Path,' which goal was Christos, the glorified Spirit of ''''Truth'''.'"{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=189|Беренс|2003|2p=64}} In a like manner Drujinin has quoted hers article: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"To the true follower of the '''Spirit of Truth''', it matters little, therefore, whether Jesus, as man and Chrêstos, lived during the era called Christian, or before, or never lived at all. The Adepts, who lived and died for humanity, have existed in many and all the ages."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=204|Дружинин|2012|2p=67}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Tyson wrote that "sanctification," in Blavatsky's opinion, "was ever the synonym (for) the '[[Mahatma|Mahatmic]]-condition,' i.e., the union of the man with the divine principle (Augoeides) in him."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=190|Tyson|2006|2p=183}} In this connection, he has said that [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] friars "practiced fasting, celibacy, contemplative prayer, and charity in order to," as Blavatsky writes, "kill one's personality and its passions, to blot out... separateness from one's 'Father,' the Divine [[Spirit]] in man."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=201|Tyson|2006|2p=183}}

=== Esotericism in the Gospels ===
While studying the Theosophical doctrine, Drujinin has stated that Blavatsky considers the "story of Jesus Christ," which was told in the Gospels, as a fantasy. In support of this he has quoted hers article:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Whence, then, the Gospels, the life of Jesus of Nazareth? Has it not been repeatedly stated that no human, mortal brain could have invented the life of the Jewish Reformer, followed by the awful drama on [[Calvary]]? We say on the authority of the [[esoteric]] Eastern School, that all this came from the [[Gnosticism|Gnostics]], as far as the name [[Christ (title)|Christos]] and the astronomico-mystical allegories are concerned, and from the writings of the ancient [[Tannaim|Tanaïm]] as regards the [[Kabbalah|Kabalistic]] connection of Jesus or Joshua, with the Biblical personifications."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=210|Дружинин|2012|2p=67}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to French philosopher [[Édouard Schuré]], [[Esoteric Christianity|Christian esotericism]] in the Gospels is revealed if to approach them from the standpoint of the "[[Essenes|Essenian]] and Gnostic traditions."{{sfn|Schuré|1921}} A religious studies scholar [[Alvin Boyd Kuhn|Alvin Kuhn]] stated that the "Gospels" in ancient times were not "the biographies of one, or of any, living earthly person, but were held as the literary forms of a universal dramatical representation of the experience of our divine [[soul]]s in the mortal body here on earth."{{sfn|Kuhn|1990|p=9}}

== Criticism ==
This article by Blavatsky always aroused rejection on the part of those who professed the teachings of Jesus only literally.{{sfn|Cranston|1993}} Thus, a priest Drujinin ([[Russian Orthodox Church]]) claimed that the Theosophists "had reduced" Jesus Christ to the level of one of the Adepts and even generally questioned his existence.{{sfn|Дружинин|2012|p=68}} And moreover:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The founders of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] deny the importance of [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Christ's crucifixion]]. Recognizing within the framework of the concepts [[karma]] and [[reincarnation]] the possibility of paying by sufferings only for their own sins, they actually represent the sufferings of the Lord Jesus Christ only as a tragicomic mistake."{{sfn|Дружинин|2012|p=68}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
On the other hand, Alvin Kuhn, being a supporter of [[Christ myth theory]], stated that esotericism "hung up midway" between recognizing the Gospels as documents of early Christian history or treating them as an allegory. He wrote that Blavatsky contributed to this "anomalous" situation: arguing in one place that "Christ— the true esoteric '''Saviour'''—is no man, but the '''Divine Principle''' in every human being,"{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960|1p=173|Kuhn|1990|2p=16}} she in another place supports a thesis about the real existence of the [[Master Jesus|Jewish Adept Jesus]]. Kuhn proclaimed: "The matter of the existence or non-existence of a certain man in human history is not dual in nature. Either Jesus, the Gospel Figure, was a person in human body, or he was not."{{sfn|Kuhn|1990|p=17}}

According to Ellwood, many of Blavatsky's "onslaughts" against Christianity, including her attacks on organizations that devoted themselves to "good works such as [[the Salvation Army]], were not always even-handed." Moreover, she apparently didn't know about the nascent [[Liberal Christianity|liberal branch of Christian theology]] — "[[Friedrich Schleiermacher|Schleiermacher]], Coleridge, [[William Ellery Channing|Channing]], Kingsley and many others" who had nothing to do to the primitive "dogmatism she so hated." Nevertheless, her attacks on church Christianity can be seen as necessary to fulfill the task of the [[Theosophical Society]] connected with the formation of a "new spirituality based on an immanent universalism" which opposing [[Religious intolerance|aggressive religiosity]] "she saw all around, whether in European bishops or in missionaries abroad."{{sfn|Ellwood}}

Each [[turbine]] in a [[gas turbine]] engine has an operating map. Complete maps are either based on turbine rig test results or are predicted by a special computer program. Alternatively, the map of a similar turbine can be suitably scaled.

==Description==
A typical turbine map is shown on the right. In this particular case, lines of percent corrected speed (based on a reference value) are plotted against the x-axis which is pressure ratio, but deltaH/T (roughly proportional to temperature drop across the unit/component entry temperature) is also often used. The y-axis is some measure of flow, usually non-dimensional flow or, as in this case, [[corrected flow]], but not actual flow. Sometimes the axes of a turbine map are transposed, to be consistent with those of a [[compressor map]]. As in this case, a companion plot, showing the variation of isentropic (i.e. [[adiabatic process|adiabatic]]) or polytropic efficiency, is often also included.

In this example the turbine is a transonic unit, where the throat [[Mach number]] reaches [[speed of sound|sonic]] conditions and the turbine becomes truly [[Choked flow|choked]]. Consequently, there is virtually no variation in flow between the [[corrected speed]] lines at high pressure ratios.

Most turbines however, are subsonic devices, the highest Mach number at the NGV throat being about 0.85. Under these conditions, there is a slight scatter in flow between the percent corrected speed lines in the [[Choked flow|'choked']] region of the map, where the flow for a given speed reaches a plateau.

Unlike a compressor (or fan), surge (or stall) does not occur in a turbine. This is because the flow through the unit is all 'downhill', from high to low pressure. Consequently there is no surge line marked on a turbine map.

Working lines are difficult to see on a conventional turbine map because the speed lines bunch up. One trick is to replot the map, with the y-axis being the multiple of flow and corrected speed. This separates the speed lines, enabling working lines (and efficiency contours) to be [[cross-plot]]ted and clearly seen.

==Progressive unchoking of the expansion system==
[[File:primarynozzlechic.gif|thumb|right|400px|Typical primary nozzle map]]The following discussion relates to the expansion system of a 2 spool, high bypass ratio, unmixed, turbofan.

On the RHS is a typical primary (i.e. hot) nozzle map (or characteristic). Its appearance is similar to that of a turbine map, but it lacks any (rotational) speed lines. Note that at high flight speeds (ignoring the change in altitude), the hot nozzle is usually in, or close to, a choking condition. This is because the ram rise in the air intake factors-up the nozzle pressure ratio. At static (e.g. SLS) conditions there is no ram rise, so the nozzle tends to operate unchoked (LHS of plot).

The low pressure turbine 'sees' the variation in flow capacity of the primary nozzle. A falling nozzle flow capacity tends to reduce the LP turbine pressure ratio (and deltaH/T). As the left hand map shows, initially the reduction in LP turbine deltaH/T has little effect upon the entry flow of the unit. Eventually, however, the LP turbine unchokes, causing the flow capacity of the LP turbine to start to decrease.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:High pressure turbine map (example).gif|thumb|right|400px|Typical high pressure turbine map]] --&gt;As long as the LP turbine remains choked, there is no significant change in HP turbine pressure ratio (or deltaH/T) and flow. Once, however, the LP turbine unchokes, the HP turbine deltaH/T starts to decrease. Eventually the HP turbine unchokes, causing its flow capacity to start to fall. Ground Idle is often reached shortly after HPT unchoke.

'''''Two Treatises of Government'''''  (or '''''Two Treatises of Government: In the Former, The False Principles, and Foundation of Sir Robert Filmer, and His Followers, Are Detected and Overthrown. The Latter Is an Essay Concerning The True Original, Extent, and End of Civil Government''''') is a work of [[political philosophy]] published anonymously in 1689 by [[John Locke]]. The ''First Treatise'' attacks [[patriarchalism]] in the form of sentence-by-sentence refutation of [[Robert Filmer]]'s ''[[Patriarcha]]'', while the ''Second Treatise'' outlines Locke's ideas for a more civilized society based on [[natural rights]] and [[social contract|contract theory]].

This publication contrasts former political works by Locke himself. In ''[[Two Tracts on Government]]'', written in 1660, Locke defends a very conservative position; however Locke never published it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Locke#ref1023494|title=John Locke - Biography, Treatises, Works, &amp; Facts|author=|date=|website=britannica.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170719015622/https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Locke#ref1023494|archivedate=19 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1669 Locke co-authored the [[Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina]], which endorses aristocracy, slavery and [[serfdom]].&lt;ref&gt;Armitage, David [http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/armitage/files/armitage-locke.pdf Armitage, D.

==Historical context==
King [[James II of England]] (VII of Scotland) was overthrown in 1688 by a union of Parliamentarians and the [[stadtholder]] of the [[Dutch Republic]] William III of Oranje-Nassau (William of Orange), who as a result ascended the English throne as [[William III of England]]. This is known as the [[Glorious Revolution]], also called the Revolution of 1688. Locke claims in the "Preface" to the ''Two Treatises'' that its purpose is to justify William III's ascension to the throne, though [[Peter Laslett]] suggests that the bulk of the writing was instead completed between 1679–1680 (and subsequently revised until Locke was driven into exile in 1683).&lt;ref&gt;Laslett, "Introduction," 59–61.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Laslett, Locke was writing his ''Two Treatises'' during the [[Exclusion Crisis]], which attempted to prevent James II from ever taking the throne in the first place. [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury]], Locke's mentor, patron and friend, introduced the bill, but it was ultimately unsuccessful. [[Richard Ashcraft]], following in Laslett's suggestion that the ''Two Treatises'' were written before the Revolution, objected that Shaftesbury's party did not advocate revolution during the Exclusion Crisis. He suggests that they are instead better associated with the revolutionary conspiracies that swirled around what would come to be known as the [[Rye House Plot]].&lt;ref&gt;Ashcraft, ''Revolutionary Politics''.&lt;/ref&gt; Locke, Shaftesbury and many others were forced into exile; some, such as Sidney, were even executed for treason. Locke knew his work was dangerous—he never acknowledged his authorship within his lifetime.

==Publication history==
[[File:LockeTreatiseAmerica.png|200px|thumb|left|The only edition of the ''Treatises'' published in America during the 18th century (1773)]]
''Two Treatises'' was first published, anonymously, in December 1689 (following printing conventions of the time, its title page was marked 1690). Locke was unhappy with this edition, complaining to the publisher about its many errors. For the rest of his life, he was intent on republishing the ''Two Treatises'' in a form that better reflected his meaning. Peter Laslett, one of the foremost Locke scholars, has suggested that Locke held the printers to a higher "standard of perfection" than the technology of the time would permit.&lt;ref&gt;Laslett, Peter. "Introduction." ''Two Treatises of Government''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press (1988), 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Be that as it may, the first edition was indeed replete with errors.  The second edition was even worse, and finally printed on cheap paper and sold to the poor. The third edition was much improved, but Locke was still not satisfied.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Cite book |last= |first= |author-link= |year=1698 |editor-last= |editor-first= |contribution= |title=Two Treatises of Government: In The Former the False Principles and Foundation of Sir Robert Filmer and His Followers, are Detected and Overthrown.

The ''Two Treatises'' begin with a Preface announcing what Locke hopes to achieve, but he also mentions that more than half of his original draft, occupying a space between the ''First'' and ''Second Treatises'', has been irretrievably lost.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John. ''Two Treatises of Government''. Ed. Peter Laslett. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press (1988), 137.&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Laslett maintains that, while Locke may have added or altered some portions in 1689, he did not make any revisions to accommodate for the missing section; he argues, for example, that the end of the ''First Treatise'' breaks off in mid-sentence.&lt;ref&gt;Laslett, "English Revolution," 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1691 ''Two Treatises'' was translated into French by David Mazzel, a French [[Huguenot]] living in the Netherlands. This translation left out Locke's "Preface," all of the ''First Treatise'', and the first chapter of the ''Second Treatise'' (which summarised Locke's conclusions in the ''First Treatise''). It was in this form that Locke's work was reprinted during the 18th century in France and in this form that [[Montesquieu]], [[Voltaire]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] were exposed to it.&lt;ref&gt;Laslett, "Introduction," 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; The only American edition from the 18th century was printed in 1773 in Boston; it, too, left out all of these sections. There were no other American editions until the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Laslett, "Introduction," 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main ideas==
''Two Treatises'' is divided into the ''First Treatise'' and the ''Second Treatise''. The original title of the ''Second Treatise'' appears to have been simply "Book II," corresponding to the title of the ''First Treatise'', "Book I."  Before publication, however, Locke gave it greater prominence by (hastily) inserting a separate title page:  "An Essay Concerning the True Original, Extent and End of Civil Government."&lt;ref&gt;Laslett, 266.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''First Treatise'' is focused on the refutation of [[Robert Filmer|Sir Robert Filmer]], in particular his ''Patriarcha'', which argued that civil society was founded on a divinely sanctioned patriarchalism. Locke proceeds through Filmer's arguments, contesting his proofs from [[Scripture]] and ridiculing them as senseless, until concluding that no government can be justified by an appeal to the [[divine right of kings]].

The ''Second Treatise'' outlines a theory of civil society. Locke begins by describing the [[state of nature]], a picture much more stable than [[Thomas Hobbes]]' state of "war of every man against every man," and argues that all men are created equal in the state of nature by God. From this, he goes on to explain the hypothetical rise of property and civilization, in the process explaining that the only legitimate governments are those that have the consent of the people. Therefore, any government that rules without the consent of the people can, in theory, be overthrown.

==''First Treatise''==
[[File:Patriarcha; or the Natural Power of Kings.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Title page from [[Robert Filmer|Filmer's]] ''Patriarcha'' (1680)]]
The ''First Treatise'' is an extended attack on [[Sir Robert Filmer]]'s ''Patriarcha''. Locke's argument proceeds along two lines:  first, he undercuts the Scriptural support that Filmer had offered for his thesis, and second he argues that the acceptance of Filmer's thesis can lead only to slavery (and absurdity). Locke chose Filmer as his target, he says, because of his reputation and because he "carried this Argument [''jure divino''] farthest, and is supposed to have brought it to perfection" (1st Tr., §&amp;nbsp;5).

Filmer's text presented an argument for a [[divine right of kings|divinely ordained]], [[hereditary monarchy|hereditary]], [[absolute monarchy|absolute]] monarchy. According to Filmer, [[Adam and Eve|the Biblical Adam]] in his role as father possessed unlimited power over his children and this authority passed down through the generations. Locke attacks this on several grounds. Accepting that fatherhood grants authority, he argues, it would do so only by the act of begetting, and so cannot be transmitted to one's children because only God can create life. Nor is the power of a father over his children absolute, as Filmer would have it; Locke points to the joint power parents share over their children referred to in the Bible. In the ''Second Treatise'' Locke returns to a discussion of parental power. (Both of these discussions have drawn the interest of modern [[feminism|feminists]] such as [[Carole Pateman]].)

Filmer also suggested that Adam's absolute authority came from his [[property|ownership]] over all the world. To this, Locke responds that the world was originally held in common (a theme that will return in the ''Second Treatise''). But, even if it were not, he argues, God's grant to Adam covered only the land and brute animals, not human beings. Nor could Adam, or his heir, leverage this grant to enslave mankind, for the [[natural law|law of nature]] forbids reducing one's fellows to a state of desperation, if one possesses a sufficient surplus to maintain oneself securely. And even if this charity were not commanded by reason, Locke continues, such a strategy for gaining dominion would prove only that the foundation of government lies in consent.

Locke intimates in the ''First Treatise'' that the doctrine of [[divine right of kings]] (''jure divino'') will eventually be the downfall of all governments. In his final chapter he asks, "Who heir?"  If Filmer is correct, there should be only one rightful king in all the world—the heir of Adam. But since it is impossible to discover the true heir of Adam, no government, under Filmer's principles, can require that its members obey its rulers. Filmer must therefore say that men are duty-bound to obey their present rulers. Locke writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I think he is the first Politician, who, pretending to settle Government upon its true Basis, and to establish the Thrones of lawful Princes, ever told the World, That he was ''properly a King, whose Manner of Government was by Supreme Power, by what Means soever he obtained it''; which in plain ''English'' is to say, that Regal and Supreme Power is properly and truly his, who can by any Means seize upon it; and if this be, to be ''properly a King'', I wonder how he came to think of, or where he will find, an ''Usurper''.  (1st Tr., §&amp;nbsp;79)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Locke ends the ''First Treatise'' by examining the history told in the Bible and the history of the world since then; he concludes that there is no evidence to support Filmer's hypothesis. According to Locke, no king has ever claimed that his authority rested upon his being the heir of Adam. It is [[Robert Filmer|Filmer]], Locke alleges, who is the innovator in politics, not those who assert the natural equality and freedom of man.

==''Second Treatise''==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2008}}
In the ''Second Treatise'' Locke develops a number of notable themes. It begins with a depiction of the [[state of nature]], wherein individuals are under no obligation to obey one another but are each themselves judge of what the [[natural law|law of nature]] requires. It also covers conquest and slavery, property, representative government, and the right of revolution.

===State of nature===
Locke defines the state of nature thus:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
To properly understand political power and trace its origins, we must consider the state that all people are in naturally.
That is a state of perfect freedom of acting and disposing of their own possessions and persons as they think fit within the bounds of the law of nature. People in this state do not have to ask permission to act or depend on the will of others to arrange matters on their behalf. The natural state is also one of equality in which all power and jurisdiction is reciprocal and no one has more than another. It is evident that all human beings—as creatures belonging to the same species and rank and born indiscriminately with all the same natural advantages and faculties—are equal amongst themselves. They have no relationship of subordination or subjection unless God (the lord and master of them all) had clearly set one person above another and conferred on him an undoubted right to dominion and sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;''Two Treatises On Government: A Translation Into Modern English'', ISR/Google Books, 2009, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=d_4BGe7-pFIC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lpg=PA106&amp;dq=%22To+properly+understand+political+power+and+trace+its+origins,+we+must+consider+the+state+that+all+people+are+in+naturally.+That+is+a+state+of+perfect+freedom+of+acting+and+disposing+of+their+own+possessions+and+persons+as+they+think+fit+within+the+bounds&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XBknIlI2v2&amp;sig=E1ATOrww4ECFdDHuTaXUG-UQWPs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj21K-K8-7QAhXqAMAKHaJPD5MQ6AEIKzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22To+properly+understand+political+power+and+trace+its+origins,+we+must+consider+the+state+that+all+people+are+in+naturally.+That+is+a+state+of+perfect+freedom+of+acting+and+disposing+of+their+own+possessions+and+persons+as+they+think+fit+within+the+bounds&amp;f=false|title=Two Treatises on Government: A Translation Into Modern English|first=John|last=Locke|date=15 August 2013|publisher=Industrial Systems Research|via=Google Books|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220193727/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=d_4BGe7-pFIC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lpg=PA106&amp;dq=%22To+properly+understand+political+power+and+trace+its+origins,+we+must+consider+the+state+that+all+people+are+in+naturally.+That+is+a+state+of+perfect+freedom+of+acting+and+disposing+of+their+own+possessions+and+persons+as+they+think+fit+within+the+bounds&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XBknIlI2v2&amp;sig=E1ATOrww4ECFdDHuTaXUG-UQWPs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj21K-K8-7QAhXqAMAKHaJPD5MQ6AEIKzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22To+properly+understand+political+power+and+trace+its+origins,+we+must+consider+the+state+that+all+people+are+in+naturally.+That+is+a+state+of+perfect+freedom+of+acting+and+disposing+of+their+own+possessions+and+persons+as+they+think+fit+within+the+bounds&amp;f=false|archivedate=20 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The work of [[Thomas Hobbes]] made theories based upon a [[state of nature]] popular in [[Early Modern Britain|17th-century England]], even as most of those who employed such arguments were deeply troubled by his absolutist conclusions. Locke's state of nature can be seen in light of this tradition. There is not and never has been any divinely ordained monarch over the entire world, Locke argues. However, the fact that the natural state of humanity is without an institutionalized government does not mean it is lawless. Human beings are still subject to the laws of God and nature. In contrast to Hobbes, who posited the state of nature as a hypothetical possibility, Locke takes great pains to show that such a state did indeed exist. Actually, it still exists in the area of international relations where there is not and is never likely to be any legitimate overarching government (i.e., one directly chosen by all the people subject to it).  Whereas Hobbes stresses the disadvantages of the state of nature, Locke points to its good points. It is free, if full of continual dangers (2nd Tr., §&amp;nbsp;123). Finally, the proper alternative to the natural state is not political dictatorship/tyranny but democratically elected government and the effective protection of basic human rights to life, liberty, and property under the rule of law.

Nobody in the natural state has the political power to tell others what to do. However, everybody has the right to authoritatively pronounce justice and administer punishment for breaches of the natural law. Thus, men are not free to do whatever they please.  "The state of nature has a law of nature to govern it, which obliges every one: and reason, which is that law, teaches all mankind, who will but consult it, that... no one ought to harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions" (2nd Tr., §&amp;nbsp;6).  The specifics of this law are unwritten, however, and so each is likely to misapply it in his own case.  Lacking any commonly recognised, impartial judge, there is no way to correct these misapplications or to effectively restrain those who violate the law of nature.

The law of nature is therefore ill enforced in the state of nature.
&lt;blockquote&gt;IF man in the state of nature be so free, as has been said; if he be absolute lord of his own person and possessions, equal to the greatest, and subject to no body, why will he part with his freedom? Why will he give up this empire, and subject himself to the dominion and control of any other power? To which it is obvious to answer, that though in the state of nature he hath such a right, yet the enjoyment of it is very uncertain, and constantly exposed to the invasion of others: for all being kings as much as he, every man his equal, and the greater part no strict observers of equity and justice, the enjoyment of the property he has in this state is very unsafe, very unsecure. This makes him willing to quit a condition, which, however free, is full of fears and continual dangers: and it is not without reason, that he seeks out, and is willing to join in society with others, who are already united, or have a mind to unite, for the mutual preservation of their lives, liberties and estates, which I call by the general name, property.  (2nd Tr., §&amp;nbsp;123)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It is to avoid the state of war that often occurs in the state of nature, and to protect their [[private property]] that men enter into civil or political society, i.e., state of society.

===Conquest and slavery===
Ch. 4 ("Of Slavery") and Ch. 16 ("Of Conquest") are sources of some confusion:  the former provides a justification for [[slavery]], the latter, the [[Right of conquest|rights of conquerors]]. Because the ''[[Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina]]'' provided that a master had perfect authority over his slaves, some{{who|date=January 2014}} have taken these chapters to be an [[apologetics|apology]] for the institution of [[slavery in Colonial America]].

Most Locke scholars{{who|date=January 2014}} roundly reject this reading, as it is directly at odds with the text. The extent of Locke's involvement in drafting the ''Fundamental Constitutions'' is a matter of some debate, but even attributing full culpability for its contents and for his having profited from the [[Atlantic slave trade]], the majority of experts will concede that Locke may have been a hypocrite in this matter, but are adamant that no part of the ''Two Treatises'' can be used to provide theoretical support for slavery by bare right of conquest.

In the rhetoric of 17th-century England, those who opposed the increasing power of the kings claimed that the country was headed for a condition of slavery. Locke therefore asks, facetiously, under what conditions such slavery might be justified. He notes that slavery cannot come about as a matter of contract (which became the basis of Locke's political system). To be a slave is to be subject to the absolute, arbitrary power of another; as men do not have this power even over themselves, they cannot sell or otherwise grant it to another. One that is deserving of death, i.e., who has violated the [[natural law|law of nature]], may be enslaved. This is, however, but the state of war continued (2nd Tr., §&amp;nbsp;24), and even one justly a slave therefore has no obligation to obedience.

In providing a justification for slavery, he has rendered all forms of slavery as it actually exists invalid. Moreover, as one may not submit to slavery, there is a moral injunction to attempt to throw off and escape it whenever it looms. Most scholars take this to be Locke's point regarding slavery:  submission to [[absolute monarchy]] is a violation of the law of nature, for one does not have the right to enslave oneself.

The legitimacy of an [[List of British monarchs|English king]] depended on (somehow) demonstrating descent from [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]]:  the [[right of conquest]] was therefore a topic rife with constitutional connotations. Locke does not say that all subsequent English monarchs have been illegitimate, but he does make their rightful authority dependent solely upon their having acquired the people's approbation.

Locke first argues that, clearly, aggressors in an unjust war can claim no right of conquest:  everything they despoil may be retaken as soon as the dispossessed have the strength to do so.  Their children retain this right, so an ancient usurpation does not become lawful with time.  The rest of the chapter then considers what rights a just conqueror might have.

The argument proceeds negatively:  Locke proposes one power a conqueror could gain, and then demonstrates how in point of fact that power cannot be claimed.  He gains no authority over those that conquered with him, for they did not wage war unjustly:  thus, whatever other right William may have had in England, he could not claim kingship over his fellow [[Normans]] by right of conquest. The subdued are under the conqueror's despotical authority, but only those who actually took part in the fighting. Those who were governed by the defeated aggressor do not become subject to the authority of the victorious aggressor. They lacked the power to do an unjust thing, and so could not have granted that power to their governors:  the aggressor therefore was not acting as their representative, and they cannot be punished for his actions.  And while the conqueror may seize the person of the vanquished aggressor in an unjust war, he cannot seize the latter's property:  he may not drive the innocent wife and children of a villain into poverty for another's unjust acts. While the property is technically that of the defeated, his innocent dependents have a claim that the just conqueror must honour.  He cannot seize more than the vanquished could forfeit, and the latter had no right to ruin his dependents.  (He may, however, demand and take reparations for the damages suffered in the war, so long as these leave enough in the possession of the aggressor's dependants for their survival).

In so arguing, Locke accomplishes two objectives.  First, he neutralises the claims of those who see all authority flowing from William I by the latter's right of conquest.  In the absence of any other claims to authority (e.g., [[Robert Filmer|Filmer]]'s [[primogeniture]] from [[Adam and Eve|Adam]], [[divine right of kings|divine]] [[anointing|anointment]], etc.), all kings would have to found their authority on the [[consent of the governed]]. Second, he removes much of the incentive for conquest in the first place, for even in a just war the spoils are limited to the persons of the defeated and reparations sufficient only to cover the costs of the war, and even then only when the aggressor's territory can easily sustain such costs (i.e., it can never be a profitable endeavour). Needless to say, the bare claim that one's spoils are the just compensation for a just war does not suffice to make it so, in Locke's view.

===Property===

In the ''Second Treatise'', Locke claims that [[civil society]] was created for the protection of [[property]].&lt;ref&gt;Second Treatise, Sec. 85&lt;/ref&gt; In saying this, he relies on the etymological root of "property," [[Latin]] ''proprius'', or what is one's own, including oneself (cf. French ''propre''). Thus, by "property" he means "life, liberty, and estate."  By saying that political society was established for the better protection of property, he claims that it serves the private (and non-political) interests of its constituent members: it does not promote some good that can be realised only in community with others (e.g., virtue).

For this account to work, individuals must possess some property outside of society, i.e., in the [[state of nature]]:  the state cannot be the sole origin of property, declaring what belongs to whom. If the purpose of government is the protection of property, the latter must exist independently of the former. [[Sir Robert Filmer|Filmer]] had said that, if there even were a state of nature (which he denied), everything would be held in common:  there could be no private property, and hence no justice or injustice (injustice being understood as treating someone else's goods, liberty, or life as if it were one's own).  [[Thomas Hobbes]] had argued the same thing. Locke therefore provides an account of how material property could arise in the absence of government.

He begins by asserting that each individual, at a minimum, "owns" himself; this is a corollary of each individual's being free and equal in the state of nature. As a result, each must also own his own labour:  to deny him his labour would be to make him a slave.  One can therefore take items from the common store of goods by mixing one's labour with them:  an apple on the tree is of no use to anyone—it must be picked to be eaten—and the picking of that apple makes it one's own.  In an alternate argument, Locke claims that we must allow it to become private property lest all mankind have starved, despite the bounty of the world.  A man must be allowed to eat, and thus have what he has eaten be his own (such that he could deny others a right to use it).  The apple is surely his when he swallows it, when he chews it, when he bites into it, when he brings it to his mouth, etc.:  it became his as soon as he mixed his labour with it (by picking it from the tree).

This does not yet say ''why'' an individual is allowed to take from the common store of nature.  There is a necessity to do so to eat, but this does not yet establish why others must respect one's property, especially as they labour under the like necessity.  Locke assures his readers that the [[state of nature]] is a state of plenty:  one may take from communal store if one leaves a) enough and b) as good for others, and since nature is bountiful, one can take all that one can use without taking anything ''from'' someone else.  Moreover, one can take only so much as one can use before it spoils.  There are then two provisos regarding what one can take, the "enough and as good" condition and "spoilage."

Gold does not rot.  Neither does silver, or any other precious metal or gem.  They are, moreover, useless, their aesthetic value not entering into the equation.  One can heap up as much of them as one wishes, or take them in trade for food.  By the tacit consent of mankind, they become a form of money (one accepts gold in exchange for apples with the understanding that someone else will accept that gold in exchange for wheat).  One can therefore avoid the spoilage limitation by selling all that one has amassed before it rots; the limits on acquisition thus disappear.

In this way, Locke argues that a full economic system could, in principle, exist within the [[state of nature]]. Property could therefore predate the existence of government, and thus society can be dedicated to the protection of property.

===Representative government===
Locke did not demand a republic. Rather, Locke felt that a legitimate contract could easily exist between citizens and a monarchy, an oligarchy or some mixed form (''2nd Tr.'', sec. 132). Locke uses the term Common-wealth to mean "not a democracy, or any form of government, but any independent community" (sec. 133) and "whatever form the Common-wealth is under, the Ruling Power ought to govern by declared and received laws, and not by extemporary dictates and undetermined resolutions." (sec 137)

Locke does, however, make a distinction between an executive (e.g. a monarchy), a "Power always in being" (sec 144) that must perpetually execute the law, and the legislative that is the "supreme power of the Common-wealth" (sec 134) and does not have to be always in being. (sec 153) Furthermore, governments are charged by the consent of the individual, "i.e. the consent of the majority, giving it either by themselves, or their representatives chosen by them." (sec 140)

His notions of people's rights and the role of civil government provided strong support for the intellectual movements of both revolutions.

===Right of revolution===
The concept of the right of revolution was also taken up by John Locke in ''Two Treatises of Government'' as part of his [[social contract]] theory.  Locke declared that under [[natural law]], all [[people]] have the right to [[life]], [[liberty]], and [[estate (law)|estate]]; under the social contract, the people could instigate a [[revolution]] against the government when it acted against the interests of [[citizenship|citizens]], to replace the government with one that served the interests of citizens.  In some cases, Locke deemed revolution an obligation.  The right of revolution thus essentially acted as a safeguard against [[tyrant|tyranny]].

Locke affirmed an explicit right to revolution in ''Two Treatises of Government'': “''whenever the Legislators endeavor to take away, and destroy the Property of the People'', or to reduce them to Slavery under Arbitrary Power, they put themselves into a state of War with the People, who are thereupon absolved from any farther Obedience, and are left to the common Refuge, which God hath provided for all Men, against Force and Violence. Whensoever therefore the ''Legislative'' shall transgress this fundamental Rule of Society; and either by Ambition, Fear, Folly or Corruption, ''endeavor to grasp'' themselves, ''or put into the hands of any other an Absolute Power'' over the Lives, Liberties, and Estates of the People; By this breach of Trust ''they forfeit the Power'', the People had put into their hands, for quite contrary ends, and it devolves to the People, who have a Right to resume their original Liberty.” (sec. 222) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fee.org/the_freeman/detail/john-locke-natural-rights-to-life-liberty-and-property#axzz2qx7Z9g7e Powell, Jim (1 August 1996): "John Locke: Natural Rights to Life, Liberty, and Property".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204014810/http://www.fee.org/the_freeman/detail/john-locke-natural-rights-to-life-liberty-and-property |date=4 February 2014 }} In: ''The Freemann''.

==Reception and influence==

===Britain===
Although the ''Two Treatises'' would become well known in the second half of the 18th century, they were somewhat neglected when published. Between 1689 and 1694, around 200 tracts and treatises were published concerning the legitimacy of the [[Glorious Revolution]]. Three of these mention Locke, two of which were written by friends of Locke.&lt;ref&gt;Goldie, Mark. “Introduction.” ''The Reception of Locke's Politics''. 6 vols. London: Pickering &amp; Chatto (1999), xxii.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]] published the ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' in 1651, by contrast, dozens of texts were immediately written in response to it. As [[Mark Goldie]] explains: "''Leviathan'' was a monolithic and unavoidable presence for political writers in Restoration England in a way that in the first half of the eighteenth the ''Two Treatises'' was not."&lt;ref&gt;Goldie, "Introduction," xxii.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the ''Two Treatises'' did not become popular until the 1760s, ideas from them did start to become important earlier in the century. According to Goldie, "the crucial moment was 1701" and "the occasion was the [[Kentish petition]]." The pamphlet war that ensued was one of the first times Locke's ideas were invoked in a public debate, most notably by [[Daniel Defoe]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldie, "Introduction," xxxi.&lt;/ref&gt; Locke's ideas did not go unchallenged and the periodical ''The Rehearsal'', for example, launched a "sustained and sophisticated assault” against the ''Two Treatises'' and endorsed the ideology of patriarchalism.&lt;ref&gt;Goldie, "Introduction," xxiv.&lt;/ref&gt; Not only did patriarchalism continue to be a legitimate political theory in the 18th century, but as J. G. A. Pocock and others have gone to great lengths to demonstrate, so was [[civic humanism]] and [[classical republicanism]]. Pocock has argued that Locke's ''Two Treatises'' had very little effect on British political theory; he maintains that there was no contractarian revolution. Rather, he sees these other long-standing traditions as far more important for 18th-century British politics.&lt;ref&gt;Goldie, "Introduction," xxviii.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle of the 18th century, Locke's position as a political philosopher suddenly rose in prominence. For example, he was invoked by those arguing on behalf of the American colonies during the [[Stamp Act]] debates of 1765–66.&lt;ref&gt;Goldie, "Introduction," xxxv.&lt;/ref&gt; Marginalized groups such as women, [[nonconformism|Dissenters]] and those campaigning to abolish the [[slavery|slave trade]] all invoked Lockean ideals. But at the same time, as Goldie describes it, "a wind of doubt about Locke's credentials gathered into a storm. The sense that Locke's philosophy had been misappropriated increasingly turned to a conviction that it was erroneous.”&lt;ref&gt;Goldie, "Introduction, xxxviii.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1790s Locke was associated with [[Rousseau]] and [[Voltaire]] and being blamed for the [[American Revolution|American]] and [[French Revolution]]s as well as for the perceived secularisation of society.&lt;ref&gt;Goldie, "Introduction," xxxviii.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1815, Locke's portrait was taken down from Christ Church, his alma mater (it was later restored to a position of prominence, and currently hangs in the dining hall of the college).

===North America===
Locke's influence during the American Revolutionary period is disputed. While it is easy to point to specific instances of Locke's ''Two Treatises'' being invoked, the extent of the acceptance of Locke's ideals and the role they played in the [[American Revolution]] are far from clear. The ''Two Treatises'' are echoed in phrases in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and writings by [[Samuel Adams]] that attempted to gain support for the rebellion. Of Locke's influence [[Thomas Jefferson]] wrote: "[[Francis Bacon|Bacon]], [[John Locke|Locke]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] I consider them as the three greatest men that have ever lived, without any exception, and as having laid the foundation of those superstructures which have been raised in the Physical &amp; Moral sciences".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Letters of Thomas Jefferson: 1743–1826 Bacon, Locke, and Newton |url=http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/P/tj3/writings/brf/jefl74.htm |publisher= |accessdate=2009-07-12 |quote=Bacon, Locke and Newton, whose pictures I will trouble you to have copied for me: and as I consider them as the three greatest men that have ever lived, without any exception, and as having laid the foundation of those superstructures which have been raised in the Physical &amp; Moral sciences. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20090615160740/http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/P/tj3/writings/brf/jefl74.htm |archivedate=15 June 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://explorer.monticello.org/text/index.php?id=82&amp;type=4 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112020132/http://explorer.monticello.org/text/index.php?id=82&amp;type=4 |archivedate=12 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }} Jefferson called Bacon, Newton, and Locke, who had so indelibly shaped his ideas, "my trinity of the three greatest men the world had ever produced"&lt;/ref&gt; The colonists frequently cited [[William Blackstone|Blackstone's]] ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', which synthesised Lockean political philosophy with the [[common law]] tradition. [[Louis Hartz]], writing at the beginning of the 20th century, took it for granted that Locke was the political philosopher of the revolution.

This view was challenged by [[Bernard Bailyn]] and [[Gordon S. Wood]], who argued that the revolution was not a struggle over property, taxation, and rights, but rather "a Machiavellian effort to preserve the young republic's 'virtue' from the corrupt and corrupting forces of English politics."&lt;ref name="GoldieIntroduction"&gt;Goldie, "Introduction," liii.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Garry Wills]], on the other hand, maintains that it was neither the Lockean tradition nor the classical republican tradition that drove the revolution, but instead Scottish moral philosophy, a political philosophy that based its conception of society on friendship, [[sensibility]] and the controlled passions.&lt;ref name="GoldieIntroduction" /&gt; [[Thomas Pangle]] and [[Michael Zuckert]] have countered, demonstrating numerous elements in the thought of more influential founders that have a Lockean pedigree.&lt;ref&gt;Pangle, ''Spirit of Modern Republicanism''; Zuckert, ''Launching Liberalism'', ''Natural Rights Republic''.&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that there is no conflict between Lockean thought and classical Republicanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Zuckert |1994|loc=chpt. 7–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Huyler 1995 loc=chpt. 4,5"&gt;{{harvnb| Huyler |1995|loc=chpt. 4,5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Natural Rights Liberalism from Locke to Nozick |editor=Ellen Frankel Paul |editor2=Fred D.

==Controversies regarding interpretation==
Locke’s political philosophy is often compared and contrasted with [[Thomas Hobbes]]’ ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]''. The motivation in both cases is self-preservation with Hobbes arguing the need of an absolute monarch to prevent the war of “all against all” inherent in anarchy while Locke argues that the protection of life, liberty, and property can be achieved by a parliamentary process that protects, not violates, one’s rights.

[[Leo Strauss]] and [[C. B. Macpherson]] stress the continuity of thought. In their view Locke and Hobbes describe an atomistic man largely driven by a hedonistic materialistic acquisitiveness. Strauss’ Locke is little more than Hobbes in “sheep’s clothing.”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Huyler |1995|pp=13, 130}}&lt;/ref&gt; C. B. Macpherson argued in his ''Political Theory of Possessive Individualism'' that Locke sets the stage for unlimited acquisition and appropriation of property by the powerful creating gross inequality. Government is the protector of interests of capitalists while the “labouring class [are] not considered to have an interest.”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb | Huyler |1995|pp=102, 120}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb | Macpherson | 1962 |p=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike Macpherson, [[James Tully (philosopher)|James Tully]] finds no evidence that Locke specifically advocates capitalism. In his ''A Discourse on Property'', Tully describes Locke’s view of man as a social dependent, with Christian sensibilities, and a God-given duty to care for others. Property, in Tully’s explanation of Locke, belong to the community as the public commons but becomes “private” so long as the property owner, or more correctly the “custodian,” serves the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Huyler |1995|pp=130–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zuckert believes Tully is reading into Locke rights and duties that just aren’t there.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Zuckert |1994|p=367}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huyler finds that Locke explicitly condemned government privileges for rich, contrary to Macpherson’s pro-capitalism critique, but also rejected subsidies to aid the poor, in contrast to Tully’s social justice apologetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Huyler |1995|pp=162–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cambridge School of political thought, led principally by [[Quentin Skinner]], [[J. G. A. Pocock]], Richard Ashcraft, and [[Peter Laslett]], uses a historical methodology to situate Locke in the ''political'' context of his times. But they also restrict his importance to those times.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Huyler |1995|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashcraft’s Locke takes the side of the burgeoning merchant class against the aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ashcraft|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neal Wood]] puts Locke on the side of the agrarian interests, not the manufacturing bourgeoisie.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Huyler |1995|pp=104–05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jerome Huyler and Michael. P. Zuckert approach Locke in the broader context of his oeuvre and historical influence. Locke is situated within changing religious, philosophical, scientific, and political dimensions of 17th century England. Objecting to the use of the contemporary concept of [[economic man]] to describe Locke’s view of human nature, Huyler emphases the “virtue of industriousness” of Locke’s Protestant England. Productive work is man’s earthly function or calling, ordained by God and required by self-preservation. The government’s protection of property rights insures that the results of industry, i.e. “fruits of one’s labor,” are secure. Locke’s prohibition of ill-gotten gains, whether for well-connected gentry or the profligate, is not a lack of Locke’s foresight to the problems in the latter stages of liberalism but an application of equal protection of the law to every individual.&lt;ref name="Huyler 1995 loc=chpt. 4,5" /&gt;

[[Richard Pipes]] argues that Locke holds a [[labor theory of value]] that leads to the socialist critique that those not engaging in physical labor exploit wage earners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pipes |first=Richard |title=Property and Freedom |page=36 |year=1999 |publisher=Knopf |isbn=978-0375404986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huyler, relying on Locke’s ''Essays on the Law of Nature'' shows that reason is the most fundamental virtue, underwrites all productive virtue, and leads to human [[Eudaimonia|flourishing]] or happiness in an [[Aristotle|Aristotelean]] sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Huyler |1995|loc=chpt. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Selfref|Regarding the use–mention distinction when writing Wikipedia articles, see {{section link|Wikipedia:Text formatting|Words as words}} and {{section link|Wikipedia:Writing better articles|Use of "refers to"}}.}}

The '''use–mention distinction''' is a [[foundational]] concept of [[analytic philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler (2005) p. 568&lt;/ref&gt; according to which it is necessary to make a [[Dichotomy|distinction]] between {{em|using}} a word (or phrase) and {{em|mentioning}} it,&lt;ref name="Devitt99"&gt;Devitt and Sterelny (1999) pp. 40–1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Suine40p24"&gt;[[W.V. Quine]] (1940) p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; and many philosophical works have been "vitiated by a failure to distinguish use and mention".&lt;ref name="Devitt99"/&gt; The distinction is disputed by non-analytic philosophers.&lt;ref name="Derrida77p79"/&gt;

The distinction between use and mention can be illustrated for the word ''cheese'':&lt;ref name="Devitt99"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Suine40p24"/&gt;
* ''Use'': Cheese is derived from milk.
* ''Mention'': 'Cheese' is derived from the [[Old English language|Old English]] word ''ċēse''.

The first sentence is a statement about the substance called "cheese"; it &lt;em&gt;uses&lt;/em&gt; the word 'cheese' to refer to that substance. The second is a statement about the word 'cheese' as a [[Sign (linguistics)|signifier]]; it &lt;em&gt;mentions&lt;/em&gt; the word without &lt;em&gt;using&lt;/em&gt; it to refer to anything other than itself.

== Grammar ==
{{Refimprove|date=November 2010}}

In written language, '''mentioned''' words or phrases often appear between [[quotation mark]]s (as in {{" '}}Chicago' contains three vowels") or in [[italics]] (as in "When I say ''honey'', I mean the sweet stuff that bees make"), and style authorities such as ''[[Strunk and White]]'' insist that mentioned words or phrases must always be made visually distinct in this manner. '''Used''' words or phrases (much more common than mentioned ones) do not bear any typographic distinction. In spoken language, or in absence of the use of stylistic cues such as quotation marks or italics in written language, the audience must identify mentioned words or phrases through semantic and pragmatic cues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Shomir|title=A Computational Theory of the Use-Mention Distinction in Natural Language|url=http://drum.lib.umd.edu/handle/1903/11694|publisher=Ph.D. Dissertation, University of Maryland|accessdate=16 February 2013|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If quotation marks are used, it is sometimes the practice to distinguish between the quotation marks used for speech and those used for mentioned words, with double quotes in one place and single in the other:
* When Larry said, "That has three letters," he was referring to the word 'bee'.
* With reference to 'bumbershoot', Peter explained that "The term refers to an umbrella."

A few authorities recommend against such a distinction, and prefer one style of quotation mark to be used for both purposes.&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''Butcher's Copy-Editing: the Cambridge Handbook for Editors, Copy-editors and Proofreaders.'' 4th edition, by Judith Butcher, Caroline Drake and Maureen Leach. Cambridge University Press, 2006. Butcher's recommends against the practice, but ''The Chicago Manual of Style'', section 7.58 (15th edition, 2003), indicates that "philosophers" use single quotes for a practice akin to the use/mention distinction, though it is not explained in this way.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In philosophy ==
The general phenomenon of a term's having different [[references]] in different contexts was called ''[[Supposition Theory|suppositio]]'' (substitution)  by medieval logicians.&lt;ref&gt;See Read, Stephen (2006). [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/medieval-terms Medieval Theories: Properties of Terms]. In [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]].&lt;/ref&gt; It describes how one has to substitute a term in a sentence based on its meaning—that is, based on the term's referent. In general, a term can be used in several ways. For nouns, they are:
* Properly with a ''[[Abstract and concrete|concrete]] and real referent'': "That is my ''pig''" (assuming it exists). (personal supposition)
* Properly with a ''concrete but unreal referent'': "Santa Claus's pig is very big." (also personal supposition)
* Properly with a ''generic referent'': "Any ''pig'' breathes air." (simple supposition)
* Improperly by way of ''metaphor'': "Your grandfather is a ''pig''". (improper supposition)
* As a ''pure term'': "''Pig'' has only three letters". (material supposition)

The last sentence contains a mention example.

The use–mention distinction is especially important in [[analytic philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quotation|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/quotation/#2.2|date=16 July 2005|accessdate=5 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Failure to properly distinguish use from mention can produce false, misleading, or [[meaningless statement]]s or [[category error]]s. For example, the following correctly distinguish between use and mention:
* "Copper" contains six letters, and is not a metal.
* Copper is a metal, and contains no letters.

The first sentence, a mention example, is a statement about the word "copper" and not the chemical element. Notably, the word is composed of six letters, but not any kind of metal or other tangible thing.  The second sentence, a use example, is a statement about the chemical element copper and not the word itself. Notably, the element is composed of 29 electrons and protons and a number of neutrons, but not any letters.

[[Stanisław Leśniewski]] was perhaps the first to make widespread use of this distinction and the [[fallacy]] that arises from overlooking it, seeing it all around in analytic philosophy of the time, for example in Russell and Whitehead's ''[[Principia Mathematica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Simons|first=Peter|title=[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], 2nd edition|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Gale|isbn=0-02-866072-2|edition=e-book|authorlink=Peter Simons (academic)|editor=Borchert, Donald M|page=292|chapter=Leśniewski, Stanisław}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the logical level, a use–mention mistake occurs when two heterogeneous levels of meaning or context are confused inadvertently.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

[[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] told that in his student years, "quotation was usually introduced as a somewhat shady device, and the introduction was accompanied by a stern sermon on the sin of confusing the use and mention of expressions". He presented a class of sentences like
{{quote|Quine said that "quotation has a certain anomalous feature."}}
which both use the meaning of the quoted words to complete the sentence, and mention them as they are attributed to [[W. V. Quine]], to argue against his teachers' hard distinction. His claim was that quotations could not be analyzed as simple expressions that mention their content by means of [[proper name|naming]] it or [[definite description|describing]] its parts, as sentences like the above would lose their exact, twofold meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1007/BF00126690| issn = 0040-5833| volume = 11| issue = 1| pages = 27–40| last = Davidson| first = Donald| title = Quotation| journal = Theory and Decision| accessdate = 8 December 2010| date = March 1979| url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/v234l47038554624/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Self-reference|Self-referential]] statements mention themselves or their components, often producing logical [[paradox]]es, such as [[Quine's paradox]]. A mathematical analogy of self-referential statements lies at the core of [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] ([[diagonal lemma]]). There are many examples of self-reference and use–mention distinction in the works of [[Douglas Hofstadter]], who makes the distinction thus:

{{quote|When a word is used to ''refer'' to something, it is said to be being ''used''. When a word is ''quoted'', though, so that someone is examining it for its surface aspects (typographical, phonetic, etc.), it is said to be being ''mentioned''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Metamagical Themas |last=Hofstadter |first=Douglas R. |year=1985 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although the standard notation for mentioning a term in philosophy and logic is to put the term in quotation marks, issues arise when the mention is itself of a mention. Notating using italics might require a potentially infinite number of typefaces, while putting quotation marks within quotation marks may lead to ambiguity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Logic, Logic, and Logic |last=Boolos |first=George |authorlink=George Boolos |year=1999 |page=398 |quote=In this 1995 paper, Boolos discussed ambiguities in using quotation marks as part of a [[formal language]], and proposed a way of distinguishing levels of mentioning using a finite number of marks, using "′" to modify the succeeding "°", as in:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#8195;According to [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. Quine]],&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#8195;Whose views on quotation are fine,&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#8195;&amp;#8195;°Boston° names Boston,&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#8195;&amp;#8195;and ′°°Boston°′° names °Boston°, &lt;!-- sic; for more explanation, you must read the paper --&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#8195;But 9 doesn't designate 9.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some analytic philosophers have said the distinction "may seem rather pedantic".&lt;ref name="Devitt99" /&gt;

In a 1977 response to analytic philosopher [[John Searle]], [[Jacques Derrida]] mentioned the distinction as "rather laborious and problematical".&lt;ref name="Derrida77p79"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ANhg9zaAtIC&amp;pg=PA79#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Derrida |year=1977 |p=79 |accessdate=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conspiracy theory was developed by the neo-Nazi [[David Lane (white supremacist)|David Lane]] in about 1995. The phrase "[[Anti-racism|anti-racist]] is a [[code word (figure of speech)|code word]] for anti-white", coined by high-profile white nationalist Robert Whitaker, is commonly associated with the topic of white [[genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/billboard-white-genocide-group-ala-article-1.2074126|title=Billboard from 'white genocide' group goes up in Ala.|publisher=|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2014/06/where_does_that_billboard_phra.html|title=Where does that billboard phrase, 'Anti-racist is a code word for anti-white,' come from?

Die Zukunft der weißen und farbigen Völker im Lichte der biologischen Statistik", Munich, Callwey, 1934, 88 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

The conspiracy theory has been expressed in South Africa and France.

==Origins and development==

===Neo-Nazi origin===
The explicit phrasing of "white genocide" first appeared sporadically in the [[neo-Nazi]] publications ''[[American Nazi Party|White Power]]''&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/roundtable/fear-white-genocide|title=Fear of White Genocide|last=Feshami|first=Kevan A.|date=2017-09-06|website=Lapham's Quarterly|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[White Aryan Resistance|WAR]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uwq52hxRDHwC|title=White Lies, White Power: The Fight Against White Supremacy and Reactionary Violence|last=Novick|first=Michael|date=1995|publisher=Common Courage Press|year=|isbn=9781567510508|location=|pages=155|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1970s and 1980s, where it primarily referred to [[contraception]] and [[abortion]]. The conspiracy theory was developed by the neo-Nazi [[David Lane (white supremacist)|David Lane]] in his ''White Genocide Manifesto'' ({{circa|1995|lk=on}}, origin of the later use of the term),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/09/how-the-turner-diaries-changed-white-nationalism/500039/|title=How 'The Turner Diaries' Changed White Nationalism|last=Berger|first=J.

===Alt-right===
In the first decade of the 21st century, the conspiracy theory spread beyond its explicit neo-Nazi and white nationalist origins, to be embraced by the newer [[alt-right]] movement.

Iowa congressman [[Steve King]] has used rhetoric that [[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] and [[Paste Magazine]] writers described as invoking the conspiracy theory, saying that "We can’t restore our civilization with somebody else's babies" and using the phrase "cultural suicide".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2018-10-03|title=Steve King's district was built by "somebody else's babies"|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/03/steve-kings-iowa-immigrants/|newspaper=Mother Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2018-10-03|title=Steve King's White Nationalism is Echoed in the White House|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/03/steve-kings-white-nationalism-is-echoed-in-the-whi.html|newspaper=pastemagazine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Vox (website)|Vox]] and [[The New Republic]] have described him as an adherent of the theory that immigration and other forms of population shift represent a slow genocide against white populations.&lt;ref name="VoxIdeology" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2018-10-03|title=Steve King says racist things because he knows the GOP won't call him out on it.|url=https://newrepublic.com/minutes/141310/steve-king-says-racist-things-knows-gop-wont-call-it|newspaper=The New Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Women in society sidebar}}
The study of '''women and religion''' typically examines the role of [[women]] within particular religious faiths, and religious doctrines relating to [[gender]], [[gender roles]], and particular women in [[religious history]]. Most religions elevate the status of men over women, have stricter sanctions against women, and require them to be submissive. While there has been progress towards equality, religions overall still lag the rest of society in addressing gender issues. There are fundamentalists within every religion who actively resist change. There is often a dualism within religion which exalts women on the one hand, while demanding more rigorous displays of devotion on the other. This leads some feminists to see religion as the last barrier for female emancipation.

{{Further|Women in Buddhism}}
[[File:Venerabletzuchuang-cropped.JPG|thumb|right|upright|A high-ranking [[Bhikkhuni]] in the [[Chinese Buddhism|Chinese Buddhist tradition]] during an alms round.]]
[https://file.scirp.org/pdf/OALibJ_2017042616323563.pdf Women in Buddhism] is a topic that can be approached from varied perspectives including those of theology, history, anthropology and feminism. Topical interests include the theological status of women, the treatment of women in Buddhist societies at home and in public, the history of women in Buddhism, and a comparison of the experiences of women across different forms of Buddhism. As in other religions, the experiences of Buddhist women have varied considerably.

[[Buddhism]] can be considered to be revolutionary within the social and political realms of ancient India in regards to the role of women. During this time period, members of the highest Hindu caste, called [[Brahmin]]s, did not allow women to have any involvement with religious rites or sacred texts of the Vedas.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Companion to Buddhist Philosophy|last=Halkias|first=Georgios|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|year=2013|isbn=9781118324004|location=UK|pages=494|doi = 10.1002/9781118324004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women were further oppressed by the sacred texts of Hindu code, called the Laws of Manu, which stated that “By a girl, by a young woman, or even an aged one, nothing must be done independently, even in her own house. In childhood a female must be subject to her own father, in youth to her husband, when her lord is dead to her sons; a woman must never be independent” (V, 147-46, 155).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/manu.htm|title=Laws of Manu|last=Buhler|first=George|date=|website=Internet Sacred Texts Archive|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhism can be attributed as revolutionary due to the fact that [[Gautama Buddha]] admitted women into the monastic order, during a time when monastic communities were dominated by males in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sirimanne|first=Chand|date=November 2016|title=Buddhism and Women - Dhamma has no Gender|url=http://vc.bridgew.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1923&amp;context=jiws|journal=Journal of International Women's Studies|volume=18|pages=275|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, one of the main schools of tradition that originated from the early development of Buddhism, called [[Theravāda Buddhism]], expresses the assumption that “all men and women, regardless of their caste, origins, or status, have equal spiritual worth.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Because Buddhism can be described as a religious and philosophical ideology that does not have an explicit “Creator” there is no implied “sacredness” in relation to one’s human form, which means that the practice itself is not bound to the ideas of gender, reproduction, and sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Buddhism After Patriarchy: A Feminist History, Analysis, and Reconstruction of Buddhism|last=Gross|first=Rita|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=1993|isbn=|location=New York|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is argued that Buddhist traditions still have underlying issues pertaining to gender roles. While Buddhist ideologies may be considered a revolutionary step forward in the [https://journal.fi/scripta/article/view/67383/27680 status of women], many still consider the tradition to be subject to the social and political context of undermining gender issues during its upbringing, and even up to this day. The progression of gender issues, especially between gender and authority, can be seen during the time period of [[Hinayana Buddhism]], when the Buddhist order underwent major reforms of splitting into about 20 different schools. During this time Buddhist narratives and beliefs arose limiting the status of women’s roles within the Buddhist communities, asserting that women could not reach enlightenment, or [[Buddhahood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yuichi|first=Kajiyama|date=1982|title=Women in Buddhism|jstor=44361658|journal=The Eastern Buddhist|volume=15|issue=2|pages=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also meant that women would not attain positions of leadership because of the fact that they could not reach enlightenment, unless they “gain good [[Karma in Buddhism|karma]] and are reborn as men beforehand.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/forum/can-women-become-leaders-in-the-buddhist-tradition|title=Can Women Become Leaders in the Buddhist Tradition?|website=berkleycenter.georgetown.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, [[Khandro Rinpoche]], a female lama in Tibetan Buddhism, shows a more optimistic view in regards to women in Buddhism:&lt;blockquote&gt;When there is a talk about women and Buddhism, I have noticed that people often regard the topic as something new and different. They believe that women in Buddhism has become an important topic because we live in modern times and so many women are practicing the Dharma now. However, this is not the case. The female sangha has been here for centuries. We are not bringing something new into a 2,500-year-old tradition. The roots are there, and we are simply re-energizing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Blossoms of the Dharma: Living as a Buddhist Nun|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=J6Ci86jyYq4C|publisher = North Atlantic Books|date = 1999-01-01|isbn = 9781556433252|language = en|first = Thubten|last = Chodron}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In a YouTube interview on why there are so few female teachers in the Buddhist communities, Rinpoche goes on to say that: &lt;blockquote&gt;It is because of a lack of education. It was a very patriarchal society back in the East. Wherever Buddhism grew, these societies were very patriarchal. It limits the opportunity women have to study and be independent – and you have study and be independent to manifest any kind of realization or understanding…fortunately, that seems to be changing. I really think that opportunities for education have now really increased for women – there becoming very competitive and learned, and things are going to change.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Citation|last=Study Buddhism|title=Khandro Rinpoche – Why Are There So Few Female Teachers?|date=2017-11-09|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEG5OrINvNM|accessdate=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;Rinpoche states that while the underlying nature of the [[patriarchal system]] that still exists today creates more obstacles and limitations for women in Buddhism, she believes that there is a changing dynamic and optimistic future for women within the Buddhist community.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

{{Further|Women in Christianity}}
Some Christians believe Christianity has set a mold for women to adhere to and is one that limits a woman’s freedom in the church. According to the Christian Bible, wives are expected to be submissive in many ways. They are asked not only to be submissive to their husbands, but to the church, their community, and God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.openbible.info/topics/virtuous_woman|title=What Does the Bible Say About Virtuous Woman?|website=www.openbible.info|access-date=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "At the head of every household is a man; at the head of a man is Christ; and the head of every women is a man; and the head of Christ is God."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+11:3&amp;version=NIV|title=Bible Gateway passage: 1 Corinthians 11:3 - New International Version|website=Bible Gateway|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wives are seen as second in the family household, only to that of their husbands. This suggests that men are first hand in Christianity and adds to issue of equal rights for women in the religion.

As according to scripture in Genesis, “the Lord God said, it is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet (fit or suitable) for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+2:18&amp;version=NIV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Genesis 2:18 - New International Version|website=Bible Gateway|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://atlanta.clclutheran.org/bibleclass/thechristianwoman.html|title=The Christian Woman- - the role of women in the home, church and society|website=atlanta.clclutheran.org|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The passage suggests that women are to play a supportive role to men and is supported in further passages from Christian Scripture. For example, in [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+3%3A18-19&amp;version=NIV Colossians] and [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+3%3A1-7&amp;version=NIV Peter], the specific passages call for women to submit to their husbands and to stay silent in their shadow. Lastly, in terms of how women are suppressed by scripture, the specific passage in Titus calls for a woman to not teach or preach in public assembly for that would constitute authority of a man.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Leadership roles in the organized churches and sects of Christianity are often restricted to males. In the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and also in [[Eastern Orthodox Churches]] and [[Oriental Orthodox Churches]], only men may serve as priests or deacons; only males serve in senior leadership positions such as pope, patriarch, and bishop. Women may serve as abbesses.

Although Christianity professes equality for all and says women and men were created equal,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+3:28&amp;version=NIV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Galatians 3:28 - New International Version|website=Bible Gateway|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; as shown throughout history women have been subject to the patriarchy that is embedded in the religion. “In the midst of the Greek, Roman, and Jewish cultures, which viewed women almost on the level of possessions, Jesus showed love and respect for women.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gty.org/library/articles/A168/gods-high-call-for-women|title=God's High Call for Women|website=Grace to You|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; As expressed in the preceding quote, Jesus Christ professed equality and Christianity does express and celebrate equality. It is the patriarchy of society that has influenced Christianity and put men in positions of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crossway.org/articles/does-the-bible-reflect-a-patriarchal-bias/|title=Does the Bible Reflect a Patriarchal Bias?|website=www.crossway.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though women have played a vital role in the church, as expressed by the Acts and many others,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+28:1-10&amp;version=NIV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Matthew 28:1-10 - New International Version|website=Bible Gateway|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+16:13-15&amp;version=NIV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Acts 16:13-15 - New International Version|website=Bible Gateway|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; none have ever been allowed a position of leadership.{{cn|date=December 2018}} Women such as Mary Magdalene, who played a major role in support Jesus’ and the ministry, show just how important women have been to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/who-was-mary-magdalene-119565482/|title=Who Was Mary Magdalene?|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2018-04-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apostle Paul is a great example in showing this as he worked, “side by side with them for the furtherance of the gospel,”&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gracechurch.org/about/distinctives/role-of-women|title=The Role of Women|website=www.gracechurch.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; but never appointed any women in roles of leadership or power.{{cn|date=December 2018}} Women in Christianity can be roughly summarized in the following quote: “Although women are spiritual equals with men and the ministry of women is essential to the body of Christ, women are excluded from leadership over men in the church.”&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

However some Christians disagree with the idea that women should not have leadership positions, popular female preachers like [[Joyce Meyer]], [[Paula White]] and [[Kathryn Kuhlman]] have had or have leadership roles in Church. It is mentioned in the [[Old Testament]] that women such as [[Deborah]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bible.com/bible/111/JDG.4.4 |title=Judges 4:4 (NIV) |publisher=Bible.com |date=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Huldah]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bible.com/bible/111/2KI.22.14 |title=2 Kings 22:14 (NIV) |publisher=Bible.com |date=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; were Prophets. In the [[New Testament]] Philip was said to have four daughters who prophesied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bible.com/bible/111/ACT.21.8-9 |title=Acts 21:8-9 (NIV) |publisher=Bible.com |date=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|Women in Hinduism}}
In Hinduism, women are displayed as equal or even greater than men, for instance Kali Ma (Dark Mother) "is the Hindu goddess of creation, preservation, and goddess of destruction" her power symbolized the origin of all creation's life, as well as the end of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.themystica.com/kali-ma/|title=Kali Ma {{!}} Hindu Goddess|date=2018-02-04|work=The Mystica|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to her control over life and death, Kali was seen as a goddess that should be loved as well as feared. Another important female figure is Shakti, a goddess that is embodied as the energy of the universe, "often manifested to destroy demonic forces and restore balance".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://chopra.com/article/shakti-universal-force|title=Shakti: A Universal Force|date=2016-05-01|work=The Chopra Center|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Shakti is a universal force, she is embodied by all the gods in Hinduism and is worshiped as the "mother goddess".

While Hinduism illustrates women as important figures that play an important role in understanding how the world works, women in Hindu society have been overlooked and their importance has been diminished throughout time due to outside forces that cause "girls being made to feel lesser and not as important as boys".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/whitehindu/2014/06/the-truth-about-women-and-hinduism/|title=The Truth About Women and Hinduism|last=Hindu|first=The White|date=2014-06-05|work=The White Hindu|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; These changes created a shift in power between men and women to the point where, "a Hindu woman was preordained to be ruled by the male and was subjected to all kinds of atrocities for these were the standards of being an ideal Hindu woman".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Basharat|first=Tahira|date=July–December 2009|title=The Contemporary Hindu Women of India: An Overview|url=http://results.pu.edu.pk/images/journal/csas/PDF/5-Dr.%20Tahira.pdf|journal=A Research Journal of South Asian Studies|volume=24|pages=244|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this change in perception, Hinduism is now seen as a Partiarchal religion that teaches sexism and inequality, when in actuality it is the people in Hindu society's perception that is sexist rather than the religion itself. However, this view of women being treated as property is slowing beginning to change, as Hindu societies are pushing for more equality and a change in the perception of women.

[[Islam]] is a monotheistic religion that was founded in the early seventh century by the Islamic prophet, Muhammad. The notion of a good life for a Muslim person is defined in Islam’s sacred text, the [[Quran]], as well as the [[Hadith]] which are the direct teachings of [[Muhammad]]. Although these sources covered a lot, there were still some situations that were left to interpretation. Thus, Islamic scholars formed a consensus around a set of secondary sources, the most notable being the ijma, qiyas, ijtihad and fatwas. It is important to recognize that the Quran is not a static source with a fixed meaning but a dynamic, versatile one.&lt;ref&gt;Motahari, Ayatollah Morteza. "Jurisprudence and its principles." New York: Tahrike Tarsile Quran (1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Quran emphasizes the equal treatment of all Islamic people, throughout history, the patriarchy has continued to oppress Muslim women since the religion was founded. Although the introduction of Islamic principles was a step in the right direction, men kept the dominant position and women were required to be obedient to their husbands. This was less due to the teachings of the religion but more so due to the mindsets of the era. Before Islam became so widespread, people of the Middle East lived in households in which women were seen as the property of their husbands and were only meant to perform household tasks, ultimately dehumanizing them.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;"Women." In ''The Islamic World: Past and Present''. Ed. John L. Esposito. ''Oxford Islamic Studies Online''. Apr 11, 2018. &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t243/e370&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of Islam also gave rise to the humanization of women and the recognition of women’s rights by placing men and women as equals in their ability to carry out the wishes of Allah and the teachings of Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Jane I. "Women in Islam: Equity, Equality, and the Search for the Natural Order." Journal of the American Academy of Religion, vol. 47, no. 4, Dec. 1979, pp. 517-537. EBSCOhost, electra.lmu.edu:2048/login?url=&lt;nowiki&gt;http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=rfh&amp;AN=ATLA0000775406&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the introduction of Islamic principles was a step in the right direction, men kept the dominant position and women were required to be obedient to their husbands. This was mostly due to the cultural norms and was seen a way of life by the local community.  The three main things which [[sharia]] law introduced were a women’s rights to marriage, inheritance, and divorce. It also limited the oppressive privileges of men by placing restrictions on polygamy by limiting marriage to a maximum of four women only if they are taken care of equally and properly.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Khel, Muhammad Nazeer Kaka. "THE STATUS OF WOMEN IN ISLAM."&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslims must observe the five pillars of Islam: praying five times a day, fasting during the month of [[Ramadan]], making a pilgrimage to [[Mecca]], donating to charity, accepting Allah as the only God and Muhammad as the messenger of God. Women have restrictions on public prayer and are either banned from mosques or have separate private spaces. On top of that they cannot pray during menstruation and if they are pregnant or in labor during the month of Ramadan, they must make up these fasting days.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These restrictions and the negative impact of veiling which was otherwise seen as a respectable act yielded in the seclusion of woman from mosques and other Islamic educational centers. This drove a wedge in their advancement and forced them into a dependency of the opposite gender.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Due to their isolation, it became the responsibility of the [[ummah]], or Muslim community, to pass down the customs and traditions that mold a Muslim women's life. This guidance, sharia, and Islamic scripture outlined the structure for her education, employment opportunities, rights to inheritance, dress, public appearance, domestic 'duties', age of marriage, freedom to consent to marriage, marriage contract, mahr, permissibility of birth control, divorce, sex outside or before marriage, her ability to receive justice in case of sex crimes, property rights independent of her husband, and when ''salat'' (prayers) are mandatory for her.&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, S. &amp; Kellison, R.

== Judaism ==
{{Further|Women in Judaism}}
The role of women in Judaism is determined by the [[Hebrew Bible]], the Oral Law (the corpus of rabbinic literature), by custom, and by non-religious cultural factors. Although the Hebrew Bible and rabbinic literature mention various female role models, religious law treats women differently in various circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Judaism 101: The Role of Women|url = http://www.jewfaq.org/women.htm|website = www.jewfaq.org|access-date = 2016-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout historical Jewish texts, all people were seen equal under the highest level: God.  The Hebrew bible states that “man” was made both “male and female”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Genesis.  The Hebrew Bible|publisher=Cassell|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; a dual gender, but was later separated into male and female.  In Judaism, God has never been exclusively viewed as male or masculine, but rather, he obtains both masculine and feminine qualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coogan|first1=Michael|title=God and sex: What the Bible really says|date=2011|publisher=Twelve|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scriptures and ancient texts refer God as “him” because there is no neutral gender in the Hebrew language.  
  
Because it is an essential building block of marriage, family is strongly emphasized in Judaism.  Gender has a bearing on familial lines: in traditional Judaism, Jewishness is passed down through the mother, although the father's name is used to describe sons and daughters in the Torah, e.g., "Dinah, daughter of Jacob".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Role of Women|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/women.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Responsibilities were not taken lightly with regards to the family.  The wife and mother in Hewbrew, Jewish language, is called "akeret habayit," which in literal English translation means "mainstay." A Jewish household is expected to live up to the Torah, in which the aketet habayit, or woman of the house, tends to the family and household duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1802936/jewish/Woman-in-Judaism.htm|title=What is the Role of the Woman in Judaism?|website=www.chabad.org|access-date=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women were highly regarded within the Jewish community because they were capable of a great degree of [[Binah (Kabbalah)|"binah"]] (institution, understanding, intelligence).  The term, “women of valor,” describes the ideal characteristics of a Jewish woman.  Traditionally, she is one who devoted all her energies towards the “physical and spiritual well-being of her family” because she had the capabilities to do so.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wenger|first1=Beth|title=Jewish Women and Voluntarism: Beyond the Myth of Enablers|journal=American Jewish History|volume=79|issue=1|pages=16–36|jstor=23884567|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her continuous devotion allowed her husband and children to flourish; her personal reward being their success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Krieger|first1=Aliza|title=The Role of Judaism in Family Relationships|journal=Journal of Multicultural Counseling and Development|volume=38|issue=3|pages=154–165|doi=10.1002/j.2161-1912.2010.tb00123.x|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, that role has reshaped itself throughout time.  The “women of valor’s” effect expanded beyond the household and into the community.  Volunteer work allowed women to acquire a sense of self-hood while sharpening leadership and organizational skills.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;  While it may seem that women only had influence in smaller communities, Jewish women eventually established enough authority to emerge as public figures.  In 1972, Sally Priesand, became the first female rabbi that was publicly ordained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women Rabbis|url=https://jwa.org/rabbis|website=Jewish Women's Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They were able to lead worship services and read from the Torah on par with men, if not even better because they had an alternative perspective of the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zucker|first1=David|title=Women Rabbis: A Novel Idea|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=f5h&amp;AN=21865370&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of women in traditional Judaism has been grossly misrepresented and misunderstood. The position of women is not nearly as lowly as many modern people think; in fact, the position of women in [[halakhah]] (Jewish Law) that dates back to the biblical period is in many ways better than the position of women under American civil law as recently as a century ago.

{{Further|Women in Sikhism}}
According to [[Sikhism]], men and women are two sides of the same coin of the human. There is a system of inter-relation and inter-dependence where man takes birth from woman, and woman is born of a man's seed. According to Sikhism a man can not feel secure and complete during his life without a woman, and a man's success is related to the love and support of the woman who shares her life with him, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sri Guru Granth Sahib – A brief history {{!}}  Islam Ahmadiyya|url = https://www.alislam.org/egazette/updates/sri-guru-granth-sahib-a-brief-history/|website = www.alislam.org|access-date = 2016-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founder of Sikhism, [[Guru Nanak]], reportedly said in 1499 that "It is a woman who keeps the race going" and that we should not "consider woman cursed and condemned, when from woman are born leaders and rulers."

Sikhs have had an obligation to treat women as equals, and gender discrimination in Sikh society has not been allowed. However, gender equality has been difficult to achieve.

At the time of the Gurus women were considered very low in society. Both Hindus and Muslims regarded women as inferior and a man's property. Women were treated as mere property whose only value was as a servant or for entertainment. They were considered seducers and distractions from man's spiritual path. Men were allowed polygamy but widows were not allowed to remarry but encouraged to burn themselves on their husbands funeral pyre (sati). Child marriage and female infanticide were prevalent and purdah (veils) were popular for women. Women were also not allowed to inherit any property. Many Hindu women were captured and sold as slaves in foreign Islamic countries.

[[Jainism]] is an ancient Indian religion founded around the sixth century BCE.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/27109180|title=Religion and women|last=Arvind.|first=Sharma,|date=1994|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=0791416895|oclc=27109180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jainism is inclusive of women, as one of the cornerstones of the religion is the “fourfold [[Sangha (Jainism)|sangha]]” which describes the Jainism community, which is made up of monks, nuns, laymen and laywomen.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;
