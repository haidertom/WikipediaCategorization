'''Albert Decaris''' (6 May 1901 – 1 January 1988) was a French artist, engraver, painter and [[Olympic Gold medal|Olympic Gold Medallist]].

==Early life==
Decaris was born in [[Sotteville-lès-Rouen]]. At age 19, Decaris won the ''[[Concours de Rome]]'', which was seen as the premiere award among young French artists at the time. He was elected Fellow of The French ''[[Académie des Beaux Arts]]'' in 1943.

== Career ==
Decaris was the first illustrator of luxury art books such as  ''Le Chant de Mon Voyage vers la Grèce'' by [[Léon Cathlin]], ''Combourg'' by [[Chateaubriand]], ''Les Discours des Misères de ce Temps'' by [[Ronsard]] and ''Les Destinées'' by [[Alfred de Vigny]]. Decaris joined the infamous group called FVHJ at age 24.

In the 1930s, Decaris began carving postal stamps, resulting in more than 500 such vignettes, for various postal services, notably French and African. Stamp collectors are fond of Decaris' stamps, as well as derivative products: small images or illustrated envelopes sold on the first day a new stamp is emitted.

At the same time Decaris was preparing large plates, mostly for his own pleasure, on a wide variety of subjects: careful (almost technical) representations of monuments and places of interest, scenes of history, real life or imaginary; scenes of mythology or imagination, verging on [[surrealism]]; mere caricatures, with a sense of humor. Some are collected in albums, such as ''The [[Apocalypse]]'' or ''The [[Zodiac]]''.

Decaris was the best and most notorious French engravers of the 20th century, with a strange mix of classicism and audacity. As reflected by columnist Yvan Christ, "Decaris' works take place beyond times and styles. They are made for duration." (''[[:fr:L'Amateur d'Art|L'Amateur d'Art]]'', Paris, Feb 1988).

Decaris is also notable for being the last person to ever win an [[Olympic Gold Medal]] for [[Etching]] and [[Engraving]], with his work ''The Swimming Pool'', at the [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948 Summer Games in London]].  After that [[Olympiad]], the artistic medal categories were discontinued.

'''''Allegory to the Element Earth''''' is a painting by the Venetian Renaissance artist [[Leandro Bassano]] of about 1580, now in [[The Walters Art Museum]], [[Baltimore]].

==History==
In the 16th century the world was thought to consist of four elements, each associated with the four seasons.  Air was attributed to spring, fire to summer, earth to autumn, and water to winter.  In 1648 a written work by Carlo Ridolfi records that Leandro Bassano's father, [[Jacopo Bassano|Jacopo]], painted a series of allegories of the four elements for a prince.  The series was likely installed in a single room of a palace or villa.  The replica, presented here, is believed to have been painted by Leandro Bassano at his father's studio.  The elder Bassano and his sons were the first in Italian art to fill their works with common subjects and natural details.&lt;ref name=Hansen&gt;{{cite book|last=Hansen|first=M.S.|title=Masterpieces of Italian Painting|year=2005|publisher=The Trustees of the Walters Art Gallery|pages=110–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
In this work representing the element earth, several workers gather and carry fruits, vegetables, and game.  The ancient Roman goddess of fertility, [[Cybele]], drives across the sky in a wagon pulled by lions.  The structure on the left alludes to a setting of a nobleman's villa.  The table is draped with an oriental carpet and covered with sweets, fruits, and wine.  The presence of these objects indicates that the land being worked by the servants does not belong to them.  Several animals are also represented throughout the painting and are shown in coexistence despite their variety.&lt;ref name="Hansen"/&gt;

==Analysis==
The classical ideals, mythology, and architectural elements represented in the painting suggest that it was created for an audience familiar with the [[humanistic]] focus on the ancient world.  The coexistence of a variety of animals represented in the painting hints at an Eden-like state.  The dark scenery provided the artist the opportunity to create dramatic light and shade with rich oil paints.  The colors standout dramatically against the dark shadows, a technique known as [[chiaroscuro]].&lt;ref name="Hansen"/&gt;

==Off the Wall==
''Allegory of the Element Earth'' was featured in ''Off the Wall'', an open-air exhibition on the streets of [[Baltimore]], Maryland, in 2012.  A reproduction of the painting was on display at the Whole Foods Market on Smith Avenue.&lt;ref name="Off the Wall"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://thewalters.org/offthewall/ |title=Walters Art Museum - Off the Wall |access-date=2012-11-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119005400/http://thewalters.org/offthewall/ |archive-date=2012-11-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[National Gallery, London]] began the concept of bringing art out of doors in 2007 and the Detroit Institute of Art introduced the concept in the U.S..

'''''Annla Gearra as Proibhinse Ard Macha''''', in English '''''The Short Annals of [[Armagh]]''''', is an Irish text contained in ''[[British Library]], [[Additional manuscripts]] 30512'', compiled c. 1460–75.

The ''Annala Gearra Ard Macha'' covers events in Irish history from the lifetime of [[Lóegaire mac Néill]] (died c. 462) to 1134 (''"In bliadhain post ec Muircertaig comarba Patraic'' {folio 40vb} ''&amp; abdaine do gabail do Niall &amp; ordned Mailmedoc hUi Morgair &amp; rl—.''"). The manuscript was penned by [[Iollan Mac an Leagha]], a professional scribe.

'''Book collecting''' is the [[collecting]] of [[book]]s, including seeking, locating, acquiring, organizing, cataloging, displaying, storing, and maintaining whatever books are of interest to a given collector. The love of books is ''bibliophilia'', and someone who loves to read, admire, and collect books is called a ''[[Bibliophily|bibliophile]]''.

Book collecting can be easy and inexpensive: there are millions of new and used books, and thousands of [[bookstore]]s, including online booksellers such as [[Abebooks]], [[Alibris]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], and [[Biblio.com]]. Wealthy book collectors pursue great rarities such as the [[Gutenberg Bible]], and Shakespeare's [[First Folio]], books which are both famous and extremely valuable. Collectors of lesser means may collect works by a favorite author, [[first edition]]s of modern authors, or books on a given subject. Book prices generally depend on the demand for a given edition, the number of copies available, and a book's condition. Some collectors join associations such as The Fine Press Book Association, which is aimed at collectors of modern [[Fine press|fine printing]]. The [[Private Libraries Association]] also covers modern fine printing, but is much more general in its outlook.

==History of book collecting==
In the ancient world, ''papyri'' and scrolls (the precursors of the book in [[codex]] form) were collected by both institutions and private individuals. In surviving accounts there are references to bibliophile book collectors in that era. [[Socrates]] was reported by the historian [[Xenophon]] to have criticized a rich young man seeking to outdo his friends by collecting the works of famous poets and philosophers. [[Seneca the Younger]] deplored ostentatious book collecting, asking: "What is the use of possessing numberless books and libraries, whose titles their owner can hardly read through in a lifetime?"&lt;ref&gt;[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], Aubrey Stewart, tr., ''[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Of_Peace_of_Mind Of Peace of Mind]'', London: George Bell and Sons, 1900 (Bohn's Classical Library Edition), Book X ; republished on en.wikisource.org. Retrieved 14 November 2017. ''Of Peace of Mind'' is a translation of Seneca's ''[[De Tranquillitate Animi]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1344 the English bishop [[Richard de Bury]] wrote [[The Philobiblon]] in which he praised the love and appreciation of books.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, S. S. (1986). ''Richard D'Aungerville de Bury, 1287-1345 (England, Bishop of Durham)''. Emory University. ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philip the Good]] brought together a collection of "about six hundred manuscripts in his possession at the height of his reign",&lt;ref&gt;Leah Dobrinska, [https://blog.bookstellyouwhy.com/philip-the-good-early-book-collector-and-patron-of-the-arts  Philip the Good: Early Book Collector, Patron of the Arts], bookstellyouwhy.com. Retrieved 15 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; which was the largest private collection of his day.

With the advent of the [[printing press]] invented by [[Johannes Gutenberg]] in the 15th century, which resulted in cheaper and more abundant books, and with the contemporaneous economic, social and political changes of the [[Renaissance]], book collecting received a great impetus. [[Jean Grolier de Servières|Jean Grolier]], the Treasurer-General of France, was an important bibliophile and book collector of this period.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel Austin, [https://www.oakknoll.com/resources/bookexcerpts/106587.pdf ''The Library of Jean Grolier: A Preliminary Catalogue''], New York: The Grolier Club, 1971, pp. 1-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Grolier owned a library of 3,000 volumes and was known for his love of the Latin classics and of richly decorated bookbindings. He was a patron of the [[Aldine Press]] that had been founded by the prominent Renaissance printer, typographer, editor and publisher, [[Aldus Manutius the Elder]].

During the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] many [[monastic]] libraries were broken up, and their contents often destroyed. There was an English [[antiquarian]] reaction to [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII's]] [[dissolution of the monasteries]]. The commissioners of [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] plundered and stripped [[university]], [[college]], and [[monastic]] libraries; so to save books from being destroyed, those who could, such as [[Matthew Parker|Archbishop Matthew Parker]] and [[Sir Robert Cotton, 1st Baronet, of Connington|Sir Robert Cotton]], began to collect them.

By the late 17th century, millions of printed books were in circulation and auctions devoted to books began to occur and printed catalogues devoted to books began to be issued by book dealers and by auction houses in Europe and America,&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Norman, [http://www.historyofinformation.com/expanded.php?id=2921 The First Book Catalogue Published in America (1693)], historyofinformation.com. Retrieved on 26 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; leading to a growing popularity of book collecting with the increasingly literate public.

With the advent of the [[Romanticism|Romantic era]] in the 18th century and its focus on the past, book collectors began to show an interest in old books, antiquarian editions and manuscripts. This new emphasis was nourished by the flood of old books onto the market following the dissolution of monastic and aristocratic libraries during the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;Owen Chadwick, "The Acton Library", in: Peter Fox, ed., ''Cambridge University Library: The Great Collections'', Cambridge University Press, 1998, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Whig politician [[George Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer|George John, 2nd Earl Spencer]] (1758-1834) collected tens of thousands of volumes. Strengths of his collection included first editions of the classics; works produced by important early presses, and notably an almost complete collection of [[Aldine Press|Aldine editions]]; and many Bibles.&lt;ref&gt;William Younger Fletcher, [https://archive.org/details/englishbookcolle00fletiala ''English Book Collectors''], London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner and Company, 1902 (The English Bookman's Library), pp. 309-312.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1812 he founded the bibliophilic [[Roxburghe Club]].

[[Thomas Phillipps|Sir Thomas Phillipps]] (1792-1872) collected 40,000 printed books and 60,000 manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Phillipps,_Thomas_(DNB00) Phillipps, Thomas (DNB00)], [[Dictionary of National Biography]], 1885-1900, Volume 45. Retrieved 12 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; He was "the greatest collector of manuscript material the world has ever known".&lt;ref&gt;Seymour de Ricci, [https://archive.org/details/englishcollector00ricc ''English Collectors of Books &amp; Manuscripts (1530-1930) and Their Marks of Ownership. The Sandars Lectures 1929-1930''], Cambridge University Press, 1930; reprinted Indiana University Press, 1960, p. 119. Retrieved 13 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; His zealous collecting efforts, which were termed [[bibliomania]] by [[Thomas Frognall Dibdin]], resulted in the preservation of much historical material, particularly manuscripts, that would otherwise have been destroyed.

The increasingly wealthy United States during the 19th century saw the appearance of "titan" book collectors such as the railroad magnate [[Henry E. Huntington|Henry Huntington]] and the financier and banker [[J. Pierpont Morgan]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Ferguson, [https://blogs.princeton.edu/rarebooks/2008/03/collecting-in-19th-century-ame/ Collecting in 19th Century America], princeton.edu. Retrieved 13 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genres, themes, and interests==
{{Prose|section|date=December 2009}}
There are millions of books, so collectors necessarily specialize in one or more [[genre]]s or subgenres of [[literature]]. A reader of [[fiction]], who enjoys [[Western (genre)|Westerns]], might decide to collect [[first edition]]s of [[Zane Grey]]'s [[novel]]s. A lover of modern [[English poetry]] might collect the works of [[W H Auden]]. A Californian who prefers [[non-fiction]] might look for books about the [[history]] of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].

Individual interests may include:

* A particular [[author]] or [[genre]] or [[field of study]] (science, medicine, history, etc.)
* A particular [[illustrator]]
* [[List of literary awards|Award]] winning books
* Books as Art
* [[Bookbinding|Binding]]s and [[Book design]]. The [[Grolier Club]] has since 1884 been interested in the "... study of the arts pertaining to the production of books...".
* [[Comic book]]s and [[Graphic novel]]s
* [[Book cover|Cover]] or [[dust jacket]] art
* [[First edition]]s
* [[Fore-edge painting]]s
* [[Illustration|Illustrated]] books
* [[incunabulum|Incunabula]]: books printed before 1501
* [[Limited edition books|Limited editions]]
* Local/[[Region]]al interests
* [[Marginalia]]
* [[Miniature book]]s
* The [[publisher]] and/or [[Printer (publisher)|printer]]
**[[Fine press]] books
**[[Private press]] books
**[[Small press]]es
* [[Paper]], [[parchment]], or [[vellum]]
* [[Book series|Series]]
* [[Photoplay edition]]s
* Signed books: inscribed/signed by an author or illustrator
* [[Special editions]], similar but not always the same as limited editions.
* [[Book publishing#The process of publishing|Stages of publication]]: [[advance copy|advance review copies]], [[galley proofs]]

Related collecting interests include collecting [[bookplates]], [[autograph collecting|autographs]], and [[ephemera]].

==Prices==
Book prices generally depend on the demand for a given book, the number of copies available for purchase, and the condition of a given copy. As with other collectibles, prices rise and fall with the popularity of a given author, title, or subject.

Because of the huge number of books for sale, there is no single comprehensive price guide for collectible books. The prices of the copies listed for sale at the online bookseller sites provide some indication of their current market values.

==Condition==
{{Further|List of used book conditions}}
As with other collectibles, the value of a book ultimately depends on its physical condition.
Years of handling, moving, and storage take their toll on the [[dust jacket]], cover, pages, and binding. Books are subject to damage from sunlight, moisture, and insects. Acid from the papermaking process can cause the pages to develop brown spots, called ''[[foxing]]''; gradually turn brown, called ''tanning''; and ultimately crumble.

Common defects include general wear; jacket/cover edge wear, scratches, and tears; the previous owner's written name, [[Bookplate]], or label; soil and stains; [[Dog ears|dogear]]ed pages; underlining, highlighting, and marginalia; water damage; torn hinges, endpapers and pages; and pages, illustrations, or whole [[Bookbinding#Terms and techniques|signatures]] free of the binding, or missing entirely.

A book in good condition should be a rectangular solid when at rest, whether upright or on its back, with the covers at right angles to the spine. If a book is out of square, usually from resting crooked on a shelf, or leans to the right or left when on its back, it is ''cocked'', or ''shelf-cocked''. If the covers bend in or flare out, usually from rapid humidity changes, a book is ''bowed'' (bent like a drawn bow). Thick hardbound books also tend to have their pages sag downward in the middle even if they are sitting level on a shelf.

==Sources==
New books are readily available from [[bookstore]]s and online. Many bookstores specialize in out-of-print, used, antiquarian, rare and collectible books. Online booksellers, including [[Abebooks]], [[Alibris]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], and [[Biblio.com|Biblio]], encourage other stores and individuals to sell books through their websites, and charge a commission.

Antique and collectible stores may have a few books for sale. Major auction houses sell quality collectible books, and local auction houses may sell books by the carton. Thrift shops and second-hand stores commonly have book sections. Other sources include estate, yard, garage, or rummage sales; and charity fund-raisers.

==Antiquarian book collecting==
Antiquarian book collecting may be roughly defined as an interest in books printed prior to 1900 and can encompass interest in 19th, 18th, 17th, 16th, and 15th-century books. Antiquarian book collectors are not exclusively interested in [[first edition]]s and first printings, although they can be. European books created before 1455 are all hand-written and are therefore one-of-a-kind historical artifacts in which the idea of "edition" and "printing" is irrelevant. There is also an interest among antiquarians for books beautifully made with fine bindings and high quality paper. For many books printed before about 1770, the first edition is not always obtainable, either because of price and/or availability. Later editions/printings from an era of interest are still often desirable to the antiquarian collector as they are also artifacts.

[[File:ParadiseLost1720Ed.jpg|thumb|right|The beginning of [[Paradise Lost]] from a 1720 illustrated edition. Not a first edition but desirable among antiquarians.]] For example, a first edition of [[Paradise Lost]] (1667) by [[John Milton]] can fetch equivalent to a down payment on a house. However, the first illustrated folio edition of 1688, technically a later edition, is worth a fraction of the first edition, but still fetches in the thousands of dollars as an illustrated book from the era in which Milton lived.

There were many editions of [[Alexander Pope]]'s translation of [[The Iliad]] and [[The Odyssey]]. The first edition of 1715-1720 is worth a small fortune whereas slightly later 18th-century editions are a lot less expensive but still garner premium prices. The [[John Ogilby]] 17th-century translations of [[Homer]]'s [[The Iliad]] and [[The Odyssey]] garner hefty prices, but not as much as the first edition of the Pope translation. This may be in part due to a significant number of copies of Ogilby's first edition probably perished in the [[Great Fire of London]] of 1666.

The first English movable-type printer was [[William Caxton|Caxton]] in the late 15th century. Editions of his books from the 15th century are very rare. 
Occasionally, 16th-century editions similar to Caxton's books appear among antiquarian book dealers and auctions, often fetching very high prices. The last Shakespeare First Folio of 1623 (first edition of the collected works of [[William Shakespeare]]) garnered a record-breaking 5.5 million in 2006. Later 17th-century folios of [[William Shakespeare]]'s works can still fetch about the price of a small house but are more readily available and relatively obtainable, whereas almost all extant copies of the First Folio are owned by libraries, museums or universities and thus are unlikely to appear on the market. For the antiquarian collector, how a particular book's production fits into a larger historical context can be as important as the edition, even if it may not be a first edition.

Also of interest are books previously owned by famous persons, or personages of high stature, such as someone from royalty or the nobility. Tracing the history of an antiquarian book's possession history, referred to as "[[provenance]]", can markedly affect the value of a copy, even if it is not desirable ''per se''. For example, a copy of a less-important 18th-century book known to have been owned by [[Voltaire]] would achieve a value many times its stand-alone market value, simply because it was once in Voltaire's possession. Previous owners of books often signed their copies or labelled them with [[Bookplate]]s, and it is often not difficult to identify a prominent previous owner if the provenance is well documented. Books owned by well-known individuals that also have a connection with the author (often as a gift from the author with a written dedication to the recipient) are known as [[Association copy|Association copies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.abebooks.co.uk/books/RareBooks/author-signature-signed-inscribed/association-copies.shtml | title=Association Copies | publisher=AbeBooks Inc. | accessdate=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The American School Library]] is an example of a very rare multi-volume boxed set with works by many popular or famous authors. Apparently the only extant full set is owned by the [[Smithsonian Institution's]] [[National Museum of American History]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The American School Library|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_American_School_Library.html?id=DtQOHQAACAAJ|publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers|accessdate=7 November 2017|language=en|date=1839}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hamel]|first1=Michael Olmert ; [introduction by Christopher de|title=The Smithsonian book of books|date=1992|publisher=Smithsonian Books|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0-89599-030-X|edition=1.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book collecting in China==
The history of book collecting in [[China]] dates back over two millennia. An important effort to collect books in China was made during the early [[Han Dynasty]] by the government, as many important books were [[Burning of books and burying of scholars|burned]] during the [[Qin Dynasty]]. From then on, book collecting began to flourish in China, particularly after the invention of [[block printing]] during the early [[Tang Dynasty]], with both imperial and private collections blooming throughout the country. However, the systematic study of book collecting began only during the [[Qing Dynasty]]. {{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

===Terminology===
*Cangshulou ({{zh|藏書樓}} "book collecting tower"): [[library]], such as the private [[Tianyi Chamber]] (天一閣), the oldest existing library in China, or the imperial [[Wenyuan Chamber]] (文淵閣), where the works collected in ''[[Siku Quanshu]]'' were reposited
*Jinxiangben (巾箱本 "headscarf box edition"): ancient pocket edition
*Jiupingzhuang (舊平裝 "old [[paperback]]") or Jiushu (舊書 "old books"): old books published after 1911, when the Qing Dynasty was overthrown
*Maobianben (毛邊本 "hairy-side edition"): uncut editions
*Songben (宋本 "Song edition") or Songban (宋版 "Song edition"): block printed books published during the [[Song Dynasty]], highly valued by collectors
*Xianzhuangshu (線裝書 "thread-bound book"): thread-bound books, usually referred to those published before 1911

==Virtual book collecting==
Virtual book collecting can be described as collecting books in a digital format (virtually) on a computer or other electronic device. A bibliophile may acquire [[ebooks]] by downloading them or copying from borrowed media, such as CDs and DVDs. However, this may violate [[copyright]] law, depending on the license under which the ebook was released. Ebooks acquired from [[Project Gutenberg]] and many similar free collections cause no violation as they have gone out of copyright, have been released under a [[Creative Commons license]], or else are in the public domain.

In [[book publishing]], '''casting off''' is the process of estimating the number of [[Bookbinding#Modern_commercial_binding|signatures]] required to [[typeset]] a [[manuscript]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Chicago Manual of Style'', Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 15th ed. 2003&lt;/ref&gt; An accurate castoff (or cast off) is important because the page length of a book affects many variables, including the cost of producing the book, the cover price, how many books can fit in a carton, and the width of the spine.

Casting off generally begins by counting the words or characters in the manuscript, usually using a [[word processor]] or [[text editor]]. This word count is then divided by an estimate of the number of words or characters per full page of a model book, i.e., a previously published book with approximately the same trim size and type specifications to be applied to the manuscript.

The editor must then account for anything else that will add pages to the finished book, such as half-title and title pages, the copyright page, part-title pages, chapter openers, photographs, illustrations, charts, tables, or lines of poetry. In addition, the editor must anticipate any elements that will be added later in proofs, such as a preface or index.

Once the editor has estimated the pages required to typeset the book, it must be rounded to the nearest multiple of sixteen (a [[Bookbinding#Modern_commercial_binding|signature]]) or eight (a half-signature) by adding blank pages or killing (editing so as to remove) pages. Editors tend to round up rather than down, because if the book requires more pages than anticipated, it will cost more to produce, but fewer pages and therefore lower production costs are less problematic.

While some software exists to help editors in accurately casting off manuscripts, even an experienced editor often can't foresee the many variables that will affect a book's length, some of which may not arise until the book is well into production.

The current '''[[coat of arms]] of [[Venezuela]]''' was primarily approved by the Congress on April 18, 1836, undergoing small modifications through history, reaching the present version.

The coat of arms was established in the [[Law of the National Flag, Coat of Arms, and Anthem (Venezuela)|Law of the National Flag, Shield and Anthem]] (''Ley de Bandera, Escudo e Himno Nacionales''), passed on February 17, 1954, by the military governor of Venezuela, [[Marcos Pérez Jiménez]]. The shield is divided in the colors of the [[Flag of Venezuela|national flag]]. In the dexter chief, on a red field, [[wheat]] represents the union of the 20 [[Political Division of Venezuela|states]] of the [[Republic]] existing at the time and the [[wealth]] of the [[Venezuela|nation]]. In sinister chief, on a yellow field, [[weapons]] (a sword, a [[sabre]] and three lances) and two [[Flag of Venezuela|national flag]]s are tied by a branch of [[Lauraceae|laurel]], as a symbol of [[Roman triumph|triumph]] in war. In base, on a deep blue field, a wild white [[horse]] (perhaps representing [[Simón Bolívar]]'s white horse ''Palomo'') runs free, an emblem of [[independence]] and [[Freedom (political)|freedom]].

Above the shield are two crossed [[cornucopia]]s (horns of plenty), pouring out wealth. The shield is flanked by an [[olive branch]] and another of [[Arecaceae|palm]], both tied at the bottom of the coat with a large band that represents the national tricolour (yellow for the nation’s wealth, blue for the [[Atlantic ocean|ocean]] separating Venezuela from [[Spain]], and red for the blood and courage of the people). The following captions appear in golden letters on the blue stripe:

==2006 changes==
On March 27, 2006, the [[National Assembly of Venezuela|National Assembly]] approved changes to the coat of arms and the [[flag of Venezuela]], which were made official on March 12, 2006, coinciding with Flag Day. Prior to 2006, the horse was running to the sinister side of the shield with its head turned to the dexter (to the viewer, this appears as the horse galloping towards his right and looking back to the left). In heraldic practice, animals and beasts are to appear facing to the dexter, which is considered the natural and honorable position. ''[[The Economist]]'' observed that [[Hugo Chávez]] ordered the seal changed after his daughter, [[Rosinés Chávez Rodríguez]], had described the previous horse as “looking backwards”.&lt;ref&gt;"Freedom to Agree", ''The Economist'', February 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Government supporters state, however, that even if the president's daughter was the one who sparked the discussion, both the legislative and executive branch agreed to changes. These were adding a machete to represent the peasant fighters during the revolutionary wars in Venezuela since the War of Independence, and a bow and arrow as a tribute to the brave indigenous population who resisted the Spanish conquistadors.

Many critics have suggested that the horse, now running to the dexter (to the viewer's left) is a political statement of the current left-wing government of President Hugo Chávez. Previously in the Venezuelan arms adopted in 1863, the horse was moving as it is seen today, to the dexter (the viewer's left). Also to note is that in heraldry, positions are not described from the viewer's point of view, but rather the shield's, so while the horse appears to be galloping left to one observing the arms, the horse is actually galloping to the dexter, or right, side of the shield. This symbolizes Venezuela as the first of the independent states of South America, and Simon Bolivar's campaigns of liberation for all of Latin America, which started here in 1811 (with Venezuela's Declaration of Independence and the earlier Caracas Junta of 1810) and ended with his final victory in the [[Battle of Ayacucho]] on December 9, 1824, all the while riding his white horse Palomo.

Political opponents have also claimed that in addition to being politically motivated, the changes were economically wasteful. At the time of the official unveiling, the opposition party stated that they will not use the new flag or coat of arms, but retain the old and employ them in demonstrations against the government. However, by 2008, and with a slightly improved political climate, the new coat of arms and flag have been generally accepted among the population and opposition.

Heraldist Fabio Cassani Pironti, commissioned by the National Assembly, made the reform of the National coats of arms.&lt;ref&gt;El Nacional, 12/03/2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==
In [[heraldry|heraldic]] descriptions ''dexter'' means ''right'' from the viewpoint of a person standing behind the shield, i.e. the viewer's left; ''sinister'' means ''left'', i.e. the viewer's right.

'''Deaf West Theatre''' Company is a [[North Hollywood, Los Angeles|North Hollywood, California]] based cultural institution. It is the first professional resident Sign Language Theatre in the western half of the United States.

Founded in 1989 by [[Bob Hiltermann]] &lt;ref&gt;Bob HIltermann&lt;/ref&gt; and Irene Oppenhiem, it was originally called “Fountain Theatre of the Deaf,” because their main venue was the [[The Fountain Theatre|Fountain Theatre]] located in [[Hollywood]]. During the first year the theater primarily taught workshops for dozens of deaf writers, directors and actors. Among the first attendees were [[Ed Waterstreet]],&lt;ref&gt;Ed Waterstreet&lt;/ref&gt; [[CJ Jones]], [[Anthony Natale]], [[Terrylene Sacchetti]], Richard Kendall and Phyllis French.

In 1990, the theater began to present short plays. Later, due to financial issues, Mr. Hiltermann announced that he was stepping down as the full-time Managing Director. Ed Waterstreet was chosen to take his place due to his experience with the “[[National Theatre of the Deaf|National Theater for the Deaf]],” and he was named the theater’s first Artistic Director. They soon changed the name to “Deaf West Theater,” which was taken from the “Deaf Way Festival” in [[Washington D.C.]], where Bob Hiltermann had been the producer. Their first full-length play was “[[The Gin Game]],” and starred [[Phyllis Frelich]] and Pat Graybill, and Bob Hiltermann starred in their second production, “[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (play)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest]].”

In 1992, Hiltermann left the company completely and Ed Waterstreet assumed the managing and artistic duties full-time. The company now has its own art-deco complex in the [[NoHo Arts District, Los Angeles|NoHo Arts District]] of North Hollywood, which includes a 90-seat theatre.

DWT presents adaptations of classics, contemporary and original works. DWT productions are presented in [[American Sign Language]] with simultaneous translation in English.

Deaf West Theatre brought a revival of [[Big River (musical)|Big River]] to the [[American Airlines Theatre]] on Broadway in 2003, as well as [[Spring Awakening (musical)|Spring Awakening]] in 2015.

She undertook this next project the year before the automated [[Oystercard]] system was introduced on London Transport, by manually recording the total distance of all the journeys she made on [[London Underground]] and on local buses for a period of one year, which amounted to more than 9,210&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name="platformforart"&gt;{{cite book

In 2005 to 2006, Harrison curated ''Day-to-Day Data'', a group exhibition of "artists who collect list, database and absurdly analyse the data of everyday life".&lt;ref name="bbcnottingham2"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition toured the UK, visiting Danielle Arnaud contemporary art, London, [[Aspex Gallery]], Portsmouth and Angel Row Gallery, Nottingham. It was accompanied by a publication, a web-based exhibition and a symposium that took place at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]], London on 18 March 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Harrison's early "data collecting" projects were examples of what is now referred to as [[life-logging]] or the [[quantified self]].&lt;ref name="timeandmotion"&gt;{{cite book

Her final major "data collecting" project was the three-year ''Tea Blog'' (1 January 2006 – 31 December 2008), for which she published online what she was thinking about every time she had a hot drink. As a very early example of [[microblogging]], the popularity of Harrison's ''Tea Blog'', prefigured that of the [[Twitter]] platform, which did not launch until mid 2006.&lt;ref name="bbcnottingham3"&gt;{{cite web

| archivedate	= 5 January 2009 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Harrison ceremoniously rejected her "data collecting" methodologies and entered into a period of self-reflection and re-invention in order to develop a "healthier and more outward looking practice".&lt;ref name="timeandmotion" /&gt; The 2009 book about her work entitled ''Confessions of a Recovering Data Collector'', explores the negative impact such practices can have on individuals and wider society and includes her own "confession" that: "Web2.0 has spawned a whole new generation of data collectors. There is now such a ridiculous abundance of boring information about other people's lives on the internet, I felt obliged to stop adding to it".&lt;ref name="confessions" /&gt; Harrison has since engaged in other activities that aim to draw attention to what she calls "the negative side effects of instantaneous ego-broadcasting"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Harrison's ''Vending Machine'' (2009) has been exhibited at venues across the UK and Ireland and features an old vending machine reprogrammed (using an [[Arduino]] board controlled by a [[Pure Data]] patch) to release free crisps when search terms relating to the recession make the headlines on the BBC News RSS feed.&lt;ref name="vendingmachine"&gt;{{cite news

== Activism ==
Harrison's growing interest in politics has increasingly moved her to direct political action, to the extent that her practice is now often described as "shifting between the roles of artist, activist and administrator".&lt;ref name="generation"&gt;{{cite book

== National Museum of Roller Derby ==
As an exploration of bureaucratic processes, over the last few years Harrison has been involved in the setting-up and running of a number of experimental and fully functional organisations and institutions,&lt;ref name="artmonthly" /&gt; including the ''National Museum of Roller Derby'' (NMRD), which she founded at [[Glasgow Women's Library]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Founding==
In 1990, founder [[Douglas Scott (choreographer)|Douglas Scott]] established Dance Force, a traditional modern dance company.  He began teaching classes for people with disabilities in 1993 through a partnership with VSA Arts of Georgia, and in 1995 formed a sister company for dancers with disabilities called E=Motion.  The companies formally merged to create Full Radius Dance in 1998. Douglas Scott continues to serve as Artistic and Executive Director.

==Work==
Full Radius Dance has created more than 50 repertory works.  The company produces two concerts in Atlanta each year, including the Modern Atlanta Dance Festival, performs in festivals, tours, and presents site-specific and community works.

==The Modern Atlanta Dance Festival==
Full Radius Dance is the host company of the Modern Atlanta Dance (MAD) Festival.  A juried festival, MAD was created in 1995 to present and celebrate the best of Georgia's diverse modern and contemporary dance scene. The MAD Festival is currently presented as two nights of performances. Also under the umbrella of the festival are events such as the 24-hour dance festival and the Pioneer of Atlanta Dance award.

The 24-hour dance festival is a project in which choreographers and dancers are locked in studios for 24 hours to create work. At the end of the 24-hour period, all of these works are presented and then the top two pieces perform their newly created works to open the core show.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The MAD Festival|url = https://fullradiusdance.org/experience/mad/about|website = fullradiusdance.org|accessdate = 2015-11-20|date = 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pioneer of Atlanta Dance award commemorates an individual who has contributed to the regional dance community. Choreographer and modern dance pioneer Ruth Mitchell, former dancer for Jose Limon and Ruth Page and director of Ruth Mitchell Dance Company, was the inaugural recipient in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Preview: As it reaches its 21st year, Modern Atlanta Dance Festival offers a weekend of firsts|url = http://www.artsatl.com/2015/05/preview-reaches-21st-year-modern-atlanta-dance-festival-offers-weekend-firsts/|website = ArtsATL|date = 2015-05-20|accessdate = 2015-11-20|last = Shaw|first = Rachael|publication-date = 2015-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the award was presented to Mozell Spriggs, founder of the Spelman College Dance Program. In 2017, it honored Bobby and Virginia Barnett. Lee Harper&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://leeharperanddancers.com/Lee_Harper_____.html|title=Lee Harper|website=leeharperanddancers.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the recipient of the 2018 award.   

Over the past two decades, Full Radius Dance has presented more than 65 companies and independent choreographers, and paid over $30,000 in honorariums to MAD participants. Entering its 24th year, the upcoming festival will be held May 2018 at the Balzer Theatre at Herren's in downtown Atlanta.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://fullradiusdance.org/experience/mad/about|title = The MAD Festival|date = 30 March 2015|accessdate = 30 March 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The line consists of many types of animals, usually sold in sets. They are typically packaged as either a family of four animals of the same species or as "two-furs", two toys sold together (but not always of the same species). A Furryville toy can also be sold individually, such as "Kangaroo Court" (a tennis-playing kangaroo) or "Sensational Groom" (a wedding skunk). They are available online only.  

The families are named for their species, in additions to groups like "Family Moments", "Around the World" and "Town Collection".  

In 2006, Mattel came under fire from nurses for a new single called "Nurse Quacktitioner". Thousands of nurses complained to Mattel about the reference to "quacks" -- [[Quackery|in medicine]] a common expression for a medical practitioner who is a fraud. Mattel replied that the figure was a duck, and that ducks "quack".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.truthaboutnursing.org/news/2006/jan/11_mattel.html |title=Mattel on the "Nurse Quacktitioner": Problem?

The '''Gyeongju Folk Craft Village''' is a village at the foothills of [[Tohamsan|Toman mountain]], in the neighborhood of Ha-dong, [[Gyeongju]], [[North Gyeongsang]] province, [[South Korea]]. The village was established in 1986 to preserve and develop crafts of the [[Silla]] kingdom. It consists of [[hanok]] or traditional Korean houses including 45 thatched houses (called ''choga'') and roof-titled houses (''giwajip'') where artisans of the Gyeongju origin live and work.&lt;ref name="Doosan"&gt;[http://www.encyber.com/search_w/ctdetail.php?masterno=741252&amp;contentno=741252 경주 민속공예촌 慶州民俗工藝村] (in Korean) [[Doosan Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3205">The '''Handicraft Guild''' was an organization central to [[Arts and Crafts movement]] active in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], United States, from 1904 to 1918. The Handicraft guild was founded, led, and staffed primarily by women, making it historically significant to women's art movements nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cartwright|first=R. L.|title=Handicraft Guild|url=http://www.mnopedia.org/group/handicraft-guild|work=[[MNopedia]]|publisher=Minnesota Historical Society|date=March 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to creating stone and metal art works, the Guild was an egalitarian school with the mission "[to] give authoritative instruction in design and its solution in terms of materials; also to furnish complete training for students desirous of becoming Craftsmen, Designers and Teachers."  Its pupils included [[Grant Wood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''''Hereafter''''' is a 2010 American [[fantasy]] [[drama film]] directed, co-produced, and scored by [[Clint Eastwood]], written by [[Peter Morgan]], and executive produced by [[Steven Spielberg]]. The film tells three parallel stories about three people affected by death in similar ways{{mdash}}all three have issues of communicating with the dead; [[Matt Damon]] plays American factory worker George, who is able to communicate with the dead and who has worked professionally as a [[Clairvoyance|clairvoyant]], but no longer wants to communicate with the dead; [[Cécile de France]] plays French television journalist Marie, who survives a [[near-death experience]] during the [[2004 Indian Ocean tsunami]]; and British twins Marcus and Jason (played by [[Frankie and George McLaren]]). [[Bryce Dallas Howard]], [[Lyndsey Marshal]], [[Jay Mohr]], and [[Thierry Neuvic]] have supporting roles.

Morgan sold the script [[Spec script|on spec]] to [[DreamWorks]] in 2008, but it transferred to [[Warner Bros.]] by the time Eastwood (who has a long-standing relationship with Warner Bros.) had signed on to direct in 2009. Principal photography ran from October 2009 to February 2010 on locations in [[London]], [[San Francisco]], [[Paris]], and [[Hawaii]].

''Hereafter'' premiered as a "Special Presentation" at the [[2010 Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 12, 2010. The film was given a [[limited release]] on October 15, 2010 and was released across North America on October 22, 2010. Although a box office success, the film received mixed reviews, with critics praising the plot and acting performances, while noting that the movie suffered from a lack of focus on the story.

==Plot==
{{Plot|film|date=March 2018}}
On assignment in India, French television journalist Marie Lelay is shopping for souvenirs for her lover Didier's children. She finds a stand where a mother and her daughter work; they sell gifts to Marie for a dollar. Didier looks over the balcony and witnesses the [[2004 Indian Ocean tsunami]] coming into shore. It hits as Marie watches from a distance. She grabs hold of the girl and runs away from the shore but is quickly swallowed by the wave. Pulled lifeless from the water, she is resuscitated by rescuers but is left for dead. She gasps back to life after having a [[Near death experience|near-death experience]] in which she sees a vision of human figures inhabiting a realm of light, among them the silhouettes of the mother and daughter holding hands. Marie and Didier are soon reunited as the disaster subsides and they return to Paris. Marie's experience, however, interferes with her work performance to the point that Didier (who is also her producer) sends her on a leave of absence to write the book they've discussed, which would add to her prestige.

In San Francisco, former professional psychic George Lonegan is persuaded against his wishes to perform a reading for Christos, a wealthy client of his brother Billy. A genuine [[Mediumship|medium]] with a gift for communicating with the dead, George abandoned his old career because he was unable to deal with the emotional impact of the reunions and the often disturbingly intimate family secrets revealed. While doing the reading, George hears the word June and asks if a date in June means anything to him. Christos at first denies that it means anything, but privately reveals to Billy that June was the name of his late wife's nurse, whom he was in love with for ten years.

In London, 12-year-old twins Jason and Marcus try desperately to prevent their alcoholic, heroin-addicted mother, Jackie, from losing them to social services. After evading the authorities yet again, the boys' mother sends Jason to the [[chemist]] to pick up her detox prescription, having finally decided to get clean. On the way home, Jason is attacked by street thugs, and while trying to escape, he is hit by a van and killed. No longer able to protect his mother, and barely able to cope with life without the brother he idolizes, Marcus is sent to a foster home.

Now writing a book and with more time to contemplate her near-death experience, Marie travels to Switzerland to meet a renowned specialist in the field. As the director of a hospice who has seen her share of dying patients, the doctor describes herself as a former skeptic who was convinced by the evidence that the afterlife exists and that people like Marie have had a genuine view of it. She persuades Marie to write a book on her experience in the hope that the scientific community will ultimately accept the reality of life beyond death.

Desperate for one last reunion with his twin brother, Marcus steals money from his foster parents and goes around London seeking someone to help him contact Jason. He encounters only frauds and pretenders. While he is trying to board the underground at [[Charing Cross]], Jason's cap, which has become a talisman for Marcus, blows off his head. Delayed by trying to find the cap, he misses his train and sees it explode in the tunnel during the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|2005 London Bombings]].

George enrolls in a cooking class taught by one of San Francisco's leading chefs. Its  students are paired-up, resulting in George being partnered with a young woman named Melanie. The two hit it off and after attending their second class decide to put their new culinary skills to use by preparing an Italian dinner at George's place. All goes well until they hear an ill-timed phone message from his brother, which inclines George to reveal his past as a psychic to Melanie. Curious, she presses George to do a reading for her. George explains his reluctance, but acquiesces. They contact the spirit of Melanie's father, who ends the session by asking her forgiveness for what he did to her as a child. Melanie flees George's home in tears, and she doesn't return to the cooking class.

Having been in talks with a publisher before her trip to Thailand about a biography of [[François Mitterrand]], Marie now stuns them with her new manuscript entitled "''Hereafter: A Conspiracy of Silence''". The publisher rejects the manuscript but soon steers her toward other publishers who might be interested, the most promising of them in London.

Marie learns from Didier that he does not intend on having her back at the job he urged her to take leave of, because her public interest in the hereafter damages her reputation as a serious journalist, and that he is having an affair with the woman who replaced her on the TV news program.

George is laid off from his factory job, and is persuaded by Billy to revive his psychic practice. Still heartbroken over the fiasco with Melanie, he changes his mind and impulsively leaves San Francisco to make a new start elsewhere. He travels to London and listens every night to audiobook readings by [[Derek Jacobi]] of [[Charles Dickens]]' works. As a Dickens devotee, he also visits the Dickens Museum and attends Jacobi's live reading of Dickens at the [[London Book Fair]]. There, one of the presenters is Marie, reading her now published book, ''Hereafter''. While handing a signed copy of her book to George, their hands touch and George has a psychic flash of Marie's tsunami drowning.

Marcus and his foster parents are also at the London Book Fair. Asking leave of them, Marcus spots George, someone he has read about and seen online. Marcus attempts to speak with the medium, who brushes him off and returns to his hotel. Marcus follows him, standing outside the hotel until nightfall. Eventually George asks him in and agrees to do his reading.

Through George, Jason tells Marcus that he is happy in the afterlife. He instructs Marcus to stop wearing his cap and says it was he who knocked it off his head at the train station. It was used, he says, to keep Marcus from the doomed train but now he must stand on his own. Jason tells him not to fear this "because we are one". As Marcus leaves George, he says he is sorry about "the French woman" as he could tell that "you like her." The last time we see Marcus, he is visiting his mother in a rehab center. She is visibly better and he is not wearing Jason's cap.

Marcus lets George know where Marie is staying. George leaves an anonymous note for Marie, saying he believes her book to be true. She decides to join the anonymous fan for lunch and discovers George. While she is looking for him, George sees a vision of them kissing at the same meeting. Their shared glimpses of the hereafter having made them appreciate this life all the more, George and Marie sit together in the cafe.

===Critical reception===
''Hereafter'' has received mixed reviews from critics. Review aggregate [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 46% of critics - though 59% of "top critics - have given the film a positive review based on 217 reviews, with an average score of 5.7 out of 10. The critical consensus is: "Despite a thought-provoking premise and Clint Eastwood's typical flair as director, ''Hereafter'' fails to generate much compelling drama, straddling the line between poignant sentimentality and hokey tedium." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hereafter/|title=Hereafter Movie Reviews, Pictures - Rotten Tomatoes|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]], another review aggregator, assigned the film a weighted average score of 56/100 based on 41 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/hereafter|title=Hereafter Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More at Metacritic|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]], however, gave the film four stars (out of four), calling it a film that "considers the idea of an afterlife with tenderness, beauty and a gentle tact. I was surprised to find it enthralling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20101019/REVIEWS/101019979|accessdate= 2011-03-10| publisher=suntimes.com| title=Hereafter | first=Roger | last=Ebert| authorlink= Roger Ebert| date=October 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film received a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects]], but lost to another Warner Bros. film, ''[[Inception]]''. It won the [[Visual Effects Society]] Award for [[Visual Effects Society Award for Outstanding Supporting Visual Effects in a Feature Motion Picture|Outstanding Supporting Visual Effects in a Feature Motion Picture]] and was also nominated in the category of Outstanding Compositing in a Feature Motion Picture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.visualeffectssociety.com/ayear/9th-annual-ves-awards|title=9th Annual VES Awards|work=visual effects society|accessdate=December 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hermann Wilhelm Göring''' (or '''Goering''';{{efn|name=spelling}} {{IPA-de|ˈɡøːʁɪŋ|lang|De-HermannWGoering.ogg}}; 12 January 1893&amp;nbsp;– 15 October 1946) was a German political and military leader as well as one of the most powerful figures in the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP) that ruled Germany from 1933 to 1945. A veteran [[World War I]] fighter pilot [[Flying aces|ace]], he was a recipient of the ''[[Pour le Mérite]]'' ("The Blue Max"). He was the last commander of [[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War I)|''Jagdgeschwader'' 1]] (Jasta 1), the fighter wing once led by [[Manfred von Richthofen]].

An early member of the Nazi Party, Göring was among those wounded in [[Adolf Hitler]]'s failed [[Beer Hall Putsch]] in 1923. While receiving treatment for his injuries, he developed an addiction to [[morphine]] which persisted until the last year of his life. After Hitler became [[Chancellor of Germany]] in 1933, Göring was named as Minister Without Portfolio in the new government. One of his first acts as a cabinet minister was to oversee the creation of the [[Gestapo]], which he ceded to [[Heinrich Himmler]] in 1934. Following the establishment of the Nazi state, Göring amassed power and political capital to become the second most powerful man in Germany. He was appointed commander-in-chief of the [[Luftwaffe]] (air force), a position he held until the final days of the regime. Upon being named [[Plenipotentiary]] of the [[Four Year Plan]] in 1936, Göring was entrusted with the task of mobilizing all sectors of the economy for war, an assignment which brought numerous government agencies under his control and helped him become one of the wealthiest men in the country. After the [[Battle of France|Fall of France]] in 1940, he was bestowed the specially created rank of ''[[Reichsmarschall]]'', which gave him seniority over all officers in [[Wehrmacht|Germany's armed forces]].

By 1941, Göring was at the peak of his power and influence, and Hitler designated him as his successor and deputy in all his offices. As the [[Second World War]] progressed, Göring's standing with Hitler and with the German public declined after the Luftwaffe proved incapable of [[Defence of the Reich|preventing the Allied bombing of Germany's cities]] and [[Battle of Stalingrad#Sixth Army surrounded|resupplying surrounded German forces in Stalingrad]]. Around that time, Göring increasingly withdrew from the military and political scene to devote his attention to collecting property and artwork, much of which was taken from Jewish victims of [[the Holocaust]]. Informed on 22 April 1945 that Hitler intended to commit suicide, Göring sent [[Göring Telegram|a telegram to Hitler]] requesting permission to assume control of the Reich. Considering his request an act of treason, Hitler removed Göring from all his positions, expelled him from the party, and ordered his arrest.

After the war, Göring was convicted of [[conspiracy]], [[crimes against peace]], [[war crime]]s and [[crimes against humanity]] at the [[Nuremberg trials]]. He was sentenced to death by hanging, but committed suicide by ingesting [[Cyanide poisoning|cyanide]] the night before the sentence was to be carried out.

== Early life ==

Göring was born on 12 January 1893{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=21}} at the Marienbad Sanatorium in [[Rosenheim]], [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]]. His father, [[Heinrich Ernst Göring]] (31 October 1839&amp;nbsp;– 7 December 1913), a former cavalry officer, had been the first Governor-General of the German protectorate of [[South West Africa|South-West Africa]] (modern-day [[Namibia]]).{{sfn|Block|Trow|1971|pp=327–330}} Heinrich had three children from a previous marriage. Göring was the fourth of five children by Heinrich's second wife, Franziska Tiefenbrunn (1859–15 July 1943), a Bavarian peasant. Göring's elder siblings were Karl, Olga, and Paula; his younger brother was [[Albert Göring|Albert]]. At the time that Göring was born, his father was serving as consul general in [[Haiti]], and his mother had returned home briefly to give birth. She left the six-week-old baby with a friend in Bavaria and did not see the child again for three years, when she and Heinrich returned to Germany.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=21–22}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R25668, Hermann Göring.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Göring in 1907, at age 14]]

Göring's godfather was Dr. Hermann Epenstein, a wealthy Jewish physician and businessman his father had met in Africa. Epenstein provided the Göring family, who were surviving on Heinrich's pension, first with a family home in Berlin-Friedenau,{{sfn|Freitag|2015|pp=25–45}} then in a small castle called Veldenstein, near [[Nuremberg]]. Göring's mother became Epenstein's mistress around this time, and remained so for some fifteen years. Epenstein acquired the minor title of [[Ritter]] (knight) von Epenstein through service and donations to the Crown.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=22–24}}

Interested in a career as a soldier from a very early age, Göring enjoyed playing with toy soldiers and dressing up in a [[Boer]] uniform his father had given him. He was sent to boarding school at age eleven, where the food was poor and discipline was harsh. He sold a violin to pay for his train ticket home, and then took to his bed, feigning illness, until he was told he would not have to return.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=24–25}} He continued to enjoy war games, pretending to lay siege to the castle Veldenstein and studying [[Teutons|Teutonic]] legends and sagas. He became a mountain climber, scaling peaks in Germany, at the [[Mont Blanc massif]], and in the [[Austrian Alps]]. At sixteen he was sent to a military academy at [[Berlin Lichterfelde]], from which he graduated with distinction.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=24–28}} (During the Nuremberg war-crimes trials In 1946, psychologist [[Gustave Gilbert]] measured him as having an [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ) of 138.){{sfn|Maser|2004|p=392}}

Göring joined the Prince Wilhelm Regiment (112th Infantry) of the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] army in 1912. The next year his mother had a falling-out with Epenstein. The family was forced to leave Veldenstein and moved to [[Munich]]; Göring's father died shortly afterwards. When World War I began in August 1914, Göring was stationed at [[Mulhouse]] with his regiment.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=24–28}}

== World War I ==
{{stack|[[File:Göring.ogg|thumb|left|Film clip of Göring in the cockpit of a [[Fokker D.VII]] during World War I]]}}

During the first year of World War I, Göring served with his infantry regiment in the area of [[Mülhausen]], a garrison town less than 2&amp;nbsp;km from the French frontier. He was hospitalized with [[rheumatism]], a result of the damp of trench warfare. While he was recovering, his friend [[Bruno Loerzer]] convinced him to transfer to what would become, by October 1916, the ''[[Luftstreitkräfte]]'' ("air combat forces") of the German army, but his request was turned down. Later that year, Göring flew as Loerzer's observer in ''[[Feldflieger Abteilung]]'' 25 (FFA 25)&amp;nbsp;– Göring had informally transferred himself. He was discovered and sentenced to three weeks' confinement to barracks, but the sentence was never carried out. By the time it was supposed to be imposed, Göring's association with Loerzer had been made official. They were assigned as a team to FFA 25 in the [[William, German Crown Prince|Crown Prince]]'s Fifth Army. They flew reconnaissance and bombing missions, for which the Crown Prince invested both Göring and Loerzer with the [[Iron Cross]], first class.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=28–29}}

After completing the pilot's training course, Göring was assigned to [[Jagdstaffel 5|''Jagdstaffel'' 5]]. Seriously wounded in the hip in aerial combat, he took nearly a year to recover. He then was transferred to [[Jagdstaffel 26|''Jagdstaffel'' 26]], commanded by Loerzer, in February 1917. He steadily scored [[dogfight|air victories]] until May, when he was assigned to command [[Jagdstaffel 27|''Jagdstaffel'' 27]]. Serving with ''Jastas'' 5, 26, and 27, he continued to win victories. In addition to his Iron Crosses (1st and 2nd Class), he received the [[Order of the Zähringer Lion|Zähringer Lion]] with swords, the [[Friedrich Order]], the [[House Order of Hohenzollern]] with swords third class, and finally, in May 1918, the coveted ''[[Pour le Mérite]]''.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=31–32}} According to [[Hermann Dahlmann]], who knew both men, Göring had Loerzer lobby for the award.{{sfn|Franks|1993|pp= 95, 117, 156 }} He finished the war with [[List of World War I aces credited with 20 or more victories|22 victories]].{{sfn|Franks|1993|p=117}} A thorough post-war examination of [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] loss records showed that only two of his awarded victories were doubtful. Three were possible and 17 were certain, or highly likely.{{sfn|Kilduff|2013|pp=165–166}}

On 7 July 1918, following the death of [[Wilhelm Reinhard (pilot)|Wilhelm Reinhard]], successor to [[Manfred von Richthofen]], Göring was made commander of the famed "Flying Circus", [[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War I)|''Jagdgeschwader'' 1]].{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=31–33}} His arrogance made him unpopular with the men of his squadron.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=403}}

In the last days of the war, Göring was repeatedly ordered to withdraw his squadron, first to [[Tellancourt]] airdrome, then to [[Darmstadt]]. At one point, he was ordered to surrender the aircraft to the Allies; he refused. Many of his pilots intentionally crash-landed their planes to keep them from falling into enemy hands.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=34–36}}

Like many other German veterans, Göring was a proponent of the [[Stab-in-the-back legend]], the belief which held that the German Army had not really lost the war, but instead was betrayed by the civilian leadership: Marxists, Jews, and especially the [[Weimar Republic|Republicans]], who had overthrown the German monarchy.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=39}}

== After World War I ==

Göring remained in aviation after the war. He tried [[barnstorming]] and briefly worked at [[Fokker]]. After spending most of 1919 living in [[Denmark]], he moved to Sweden and joined [[Svensk Lufttrafik]], a Swedish airline. Göring was often hired for private flights. During the winter of 1920–1921, he was hired by [[Count Eric von Rosen]] to fly him to his castle from Stockholm. Invited to spend the night, Göring may at this time have first seen the [[swastika]] emblem, which Rosen had set in the chimney piece as a family badge.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=39–41}}{{efn|name=swastika}}

This was also the first time that Göring saw his future wife; the count introduced his sister-in-law, Baroness [[Carin Göring|Carin von Kantzow]] (''née'' Freiin von Fock). Estranged from her husband of ten years, she had an eight-year-old son. Göring was immediately infatuated and asked her to meet him in Stockholm. They arranged a visit at the home of her parents and spent much time together through 1921, when Göring left for Munich to take political science at the university. Carin obtained a divorce, followed Göring to Munich, and married him on 3 February 1922.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=43}} Their first home together was a hunting lodge at Hochkreuth in the [[Bavarian Alps]], near [[Bayrischzell]], some {{convert|80|km|mi}} from Munich.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=41, 43}} After Göring met [[Adolf Hitler]] and joined the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP) in 1922, they moved to Obermenzing, a suburb of Munich.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=45, 47}}

== Early Nazi career ==
[[File:Hitler 1928.jpg|left|upright=1.0|thumb|Göring (left) stands in front of [[Hitler]] at a Nazi rally in [[Nuremberg]] (c. 1928)]]

Göring joined the Nazi Party in 1922 after hearing a speech by Hitler.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=45, 47}}{{sfn|Miller|2006|p=426}} He was given command of the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA) as the ''[[Oberster SA-Führer]]'' in 1923.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=112}} He was later appointed an ''SA-[[Gruppenführer]]'' (Lieutenant General) and held this rank on the SA rolls until 1945. At this time, Carin—who liked Hitler—often played hostess to meetings of leading Nazis, including her husband, Hitler, [[Rudolf Hess]], [[Alfred Rosenberg]], and [[Ernst Röhm]].{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=47}} Hitler later recalled his early association with Göring:

{{quote|text="I liked him. I made him the head of my SA. He is the only one of its heads that ran the SA properly. I gave him a dishevelled rabble. In a very short time he had organised a division of 11,000 men."{{sfn|Hitler|1988|p=168}}|sign=Adolf Hitler|source=}}

Hitler and the Nazi Party held mass meetings and rallies in Munich and elsewhere during the early 1920s, attempting to gain supporters in a bid for political power.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=49–51}} Inspired by [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[March on Rome]], the Nazis attempted to seize power on 8–9 November 1923 in a failed coup known as the [[Beer Hall Putsch]]. Göring, who was with Hitler leading the march to the War Ministry, was shot in the leg. Fourteen Nazis and four policemen were killed; many top Nazis, including Hitler, were arrested.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=131}} With Carin's help, Göring was smuggled to [[Innsbruck]], where he received surgery and was given morphine for the pain. He remained in hospital until 24 December.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=57–58}} This was the beginning of his morphine addiction, which lasted until his imprisonment at Nuremberg.{{sfn|Speer|1971|p=644}} Meanwhile, the authorities in Munich declared Göring a wanted man. The Görings—acutely short of funds and reliant on the good will of Nazi sympathizers abroad—moved from Austria to [[Venice]]. In May 1924 they visited Rome, via [[Florence]] and [[Siena]]. Göring met Mussolini, who expressed an interest in meeting Hitler, who was by then in prison.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=59–60}}

Personal problems continued to multiply. By 1925, Carin's mother was ill. The Görings—with difficulty—raised the money in the spring of 1925 for a journey to Sweden via Austria, [[Czechoslovakia]], Poland, and [[Free City of Danzig|Danzig]] (now Gdańsk). Göring had become a violent morphine addict; Carin's family were shocked by his deterioration. Carin, who was ill with [[epilepsy]] and a weak heart, had to allow the doctors to take charge of Göring; her son was taken by his father. Göring was certified a dangerous drug addict and was placed in Långbro asylum on 1 September 1925.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=61}} He was violent to the point where he had to be confined in a [[straitjacket]], but his psychiatrist felt he was sane; the condition was caused solely by the morphine.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=404}} Weaned off the drug, he left the facility briefly, but had to return for further treatment. He returned to Germany when an amnesty was declared in 1927 and resumed working in the aircraft industry.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=62, 64}} Hitler, who had written ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' while in prison, had been released in December 1924.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=160}} Carin Göring, ill with [[epilepsy]] and tuberculosis,{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=146}} died of heart failure on 17 October 1931.

Meanwhile, the NSDAP was in a period of rebuilding and waiting. The economy had recovered, which meant fewer opportunities for the Nazis to agitate for change. The SA was reorganised, but with [[Franz Pfeffer von Salomon]] as its head rather than Göring, and the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) was founded in 1925, initially as a bodyguard for Hitler. Membership in the party increased from 27,000 in 1925 to 108,000 in 1928 and 178,000 in 1929. In [[German federal election, 1928|the May 1928 elections]] the NSDAP only obtained 12 seats out of an available 491 in the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]].{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=118–121}} Göring was elected as a representative from Bavaria.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=66}} The [[Great Depression]] led to a disastrous downturn in the German economy, and [[German federal election, 1930|in the 1930 election]], the NSDAP won 6,409,600 votes and 107 seats.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=136, 138}} In May 1931, Hitler sent Göring on a mission to the [[Holy See|Vatican]], where he met the future [[Pope Pius XII]].{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=74}}

In the [[German federal election, July 1932|July 1932 election]], the Nazis won 230 seats to become far and away the largest party in the Reichstag. By longstanding tradition, the Nazis were thus entitled to select the President of the Reichstag, and elected Göring to the post.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=297}}

== Reichstag fire ==
The [[Reichstag fire]] occurred on the night of 27 February 1933. Göring was one of the first to arrive on the scene. [[Marinus van der Lubbe]]—a Communist radical—was arrested and claimed sole responsibility for the fire. Göring immediately called for a crackdown on Communists.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=329–330}}

The Nazis took advantage of the fire to advance their own political aims. The [[Reichstag Fire Decree]], passed the next day on Hitler's urging, suspended basic rights and allowed detention without trial. Activities of the [[Communist Party of Germany|German Communist Party]] were suppressed, and some 4,000 Party members were arrested.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=194}} Göring demanded that the detainees should be shot, but [[Rudolf Diels]], head of the Prussian political police, ignored the order.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=331}} Some researchers, including [[William L. Shirer]] and [[Alan Bullock]], are of the opinion that the NSDAP itself was responsible for starting the fire.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=192}}{{sfn|Bullock|1999|p=262}}

At the [[Nuremberg trials]], General [[Franz Halder]] testified that Göring admitted responsibility for starting the fire. He said that, at a luncheon held on Hitler's birthday in 1942, Göring said, "The only one who really knows about the Reichstag is I, because I set it on fire!"{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=193}} In his own Nuremberg testimony, Göring denied this story.{{sfn|Nuremberg Trial Proceedings, 18 March 1946}}

== Second marriage ==
During the early 1930s, Göring was often in the company of [[Emmy Göring|Emmy Sonnemann]], an actress from [[Hamburg]].{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=111}} They were married on 10 April 1935 in Berlin; the wedding was celebrated on a huge scale. A large reception was held the night before at the Berlin Opera House. Fighter aircraft flew overhead on the night of the reception and the day of the ceremony,{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=139–140}} at which Hitler was best man.{{sfn|Gunther|1940|p=63}} Göring's daughter, [[Edda Göring|Edda]], was born on 2 June 1938.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=187}}

== Nazi potentate ==
{{Nazism sidebar}}

When Hitler was named [[chancellor of Germany]] in January 1933, Göring was appointed as [[minister without portfolio]], Minister of the Interior for Prussia, and Reich Commissioner of Aviation.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=92}} [[Wilhelm Frick]] was named Reich Interior Minister. Frick and head of the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) [[Heinrich Himmler]] hoped to create a unified police force for all of Germany, but Göring on 30 November 1933 established a Prussian police force, with [[Rudolf Diels]] at its head. The force was called the ''Geheime Staatspolizei'', or [[Gestapo]]. Göring, thinking that Diels was not ruthless enough to use the Gestapo effectively to counteract the power of the SA, handed over control of the Gestapo to Himmler on 20 April 1934.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=54}} By this time, the SA numbered over two million men.{{sfn|Goldhagen|1996|p=95}}

Hitler was deeply concerned that [[Ernst Röhm]], the chief of the SA, was planning a coup. Himmler and [[Reinhard Heydrich]] plotted with Göring to use the Gestapo and SS to crush the SA.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=306}} Members of the SA got wind of the proposed action and thousands of them took to the streets in violent demonstrations on the night of 29 June 1934. Enraged, Hitler ordered the arrest of the SA leadership. Röhm was shot dead in his cell when he refused to commit suicide; Göring personally went over the lists of detainees—numbering in the thousands—and determined who else should be shot. At least 85 people were killed in the period of 30 June to 2 July, which is now known as the [[Night of the Long Knives]].{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=31–35, 39}} Hitler admitted in the Reichstag on 13 July that the killings had been entirely illegal, but claimed a plot had been under way to overthrow the Reich. A retroactive law was passed making the action legal. Any criticism was met with arrests.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=38}}

One of the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], which had been in place since the end of World War I, stated that Germany was not allowed to maintain an air force. After the 1926 signing of the [[Kellogg–Briand Pact]], police aircraft were permitted. Göring was appointed Air Traffic Minister in May 1933. Germany began to accumulate aircraft in violation of the Treaty, and in 1935 the existence of the [[Luftwaffe]] was formally acknowledged,{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=116–117}} with Göring as Reich Aviation Minister.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=364}}

During a cabinet meeting in September 1936, Göring and Hitler announced that the German rearmament programme must be sped up. On 18 October, Hitler named Göring as [[Plenipotentiary]] of the [[Four Year Plan]] to undertake this task. Göring created a new organisation to administer the Plan and drew the ministries of labour and agriculture under its umbrella. He bypassed the economics ministry in his policy-making decisions, to the chagrin of [[Hjalmar Schacht]], the minister in charge. Huge expenditures were made on rearmament, in spite of growing deficits.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=357–360}} Schacht resigned on 8 December 1937,{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=311}} and [[Walther Funk]] took over the position, as well as control of the [[Reichsbank]]. In this way, both of these institutions were brought under Göring's control under the auspices of the Four Year Plan.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=361}} In July 1937, the [[Reichswerke Hermann Göring]] was established under state ownership – though led by Göring – with the aim of boosting steel production beyond the level which private enterprise could economically provide.{{sfn|Overy|2002|p=145}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-17986, Schorfheide, Lord Edward Frederik Halifax, Hermann Göring crop.jpg|200px|thumb|Göring with [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]] at Schorfheide, 20 November 1937]]

In 1938, Göring was involved in the [[Blomberg–Fritsch Affair]], which led to the resignations of the War Minister, ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' [[Werner von Blomberg]], and the army commander, General [[Werner von Fritsch]]. Göring had acted as witness at Blomberg's wedding to Margarethe Gruhn, a 26-year-old typist, on 12 January 1938. Information received from the police showed that the young bride was a prostitute.{{sfn|Gerwarth|2011|p=116}} Göring felt obligated to tell Hitler, but also saw this event as an opportunity to dispose of Blomberg. Blomberg was forced to resign. Göring did not want Fritsch to be appointed to that position and thus be his superior. Several days later, Heydrich revealed a file on Fritsch that contained allegations of homosexual activity and blackmail. The charges were later proven to be false, but Fritsch had lost Hitler's trust and was forced to resign.{{sfn|Gerwarth|2011|pp=116, 117}} Hitler used the dismissals as an opportunity to reshuffle the leadership of the military. Göring asked for the post of War Minister, but was turned down; he was appointed to the rank of ''Generalfeldmarschall''. Hitler took over as supreme commander of the armed forces and created subordinate posts to head the three main branches of service.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=642–644}}

{{main article|Anschluss}}
As minister in charge of the Four Year Plan, Göring became concerned with the lack of natural resources in Germany, and began pushing for Austria to be incorporated into the Reich. The province of [[Styria]] had rich iron ore deposits, and the country as a whole was home to many skilled labourers that would also be useful. Hitler had always been in favour of a takeover of Austria, his native country. He met on 12 February 1938 with Austrian chancellor [[Kurt Schuschnigg]], threatening invasion if peaceful unification was not forthcoming. The Nazi party was made legal in Austria to gain a power base, and a referendum on reunification was scheduled for March. When Hitler did not approve of the wording of the plebiscite, Göring telephoned Schuschnigg and Austrian head of state [[Wilhelm Miklas]] to demand Schuschnigg's resignation, threatening invasion by German troops and civil unrest by the Austrian Nazi Party members. Schuschnigg resigned on 11 March and the plebiscite was cancelled. By 5:30 the next morning, German troops that had been massing on the border marched into Austria, meeting no resistance.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=646–652}}

{{main article|German occupation of Czechoslovakia}}
Although [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] had been named Foreign Minister in February 1938, Göring continued to involve himself in foreign affairs.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=187}} That July, he contacted the British government with the idea that he should make an official visit to discuss Germany's intentions for [[Czechoslovakia]]. [[Neville Chamberlain]] was in favour of a meeting, and there was talk of a pact being signed between Britain and Germany. In February 1938, Göring visited Warsaw to quell rumours about the upcoming invasion of Poland. He had conversations with the Hungarian government that summer as well, discussing their potential role in an invasion of Czechoslovakia. At the [[Nuremberg Rally]] that September, Göring and other speakers denounced the Czechs as an inferior race that must be conquered.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=194–197}} Chamberlain met with Hitler in a series of meetings that led to the signing of the [[Munich Agreement]] (29 September 1938), which turned over control of the [[Sudetenland]] to Germany.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=674}} In March 1939, Göring threatened Czechoslovak president [[Emil Hácha]] with the bombing of [[Prague]]. Hácha then agreed to sign a communique accepting the German occupation of the remainder of [[Bohemia]] and [[Moravia]].{{sfn|Noakes|Pridham|2001|p=119}}

Although many in the party disliked him,{{sfn|Gunther|1940|p=19}} before the war Göring enjoyed widespread personal popularity among the German public because of his perceived sociability, colour and humour.{{sfn|Overy|2002|p=73}}{{sfn|Overy|2002|p=236}} As the Nazi leader most responsible for economic matters, he presented himself as a champion of national interests over allegedly corrupt big business and the old German elite. The Nazi press was on Göring's side. Other leaders, such as Hess and Ribbentrop, were envious of his popularity.{{sfn|Overy|2002|p=73}} In Britain and the United States, some viewed Göring as more acceptable than the other Nazis and as a possible mediator between the western democracies and Hitler.{{sfn|Overy|2002|p=236}}

== World War II ==

=== Success on all fronts ===

Göring and other senior officers were concerned that Germany was not yet ready for war, but Hitler insisted on pushing ahead as soon as possible.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=197, 211}} The invasion of Poland, the opening action of World War II, began at dawn on 1 September 1939.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=597}} Later in the day, speaking to the ''Reichstag'', Hitler designated Göring as his successor as Führer of all Germany, "If anything should befall me",{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=599}} with Hess as the second alternate.{{sfn|Gunther|1940|p=19}} Big German victories followed one after the other in quick succession. With the help of the Luftwaffe, the [[Polish Air Force]] was defeated within a week.{{sfn|Hooton|1999|pp=177–189}} The ''[[Fallschirmjäger]]'' seized vital airfields in [[Norway]] and captured [[Fort Eben-Emael]] in Belgium. Göring's Luftwaffe played critical roles in the [[Battle of the Netherlands|Battles of the Netherlands]], [[Battle of Belgium|Belgium]] and [[Battle of France|France]] in May 1940.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=721, 723}}

After the [[Fall of France]], Hitler awarded Göring the [[Grand Cross of the Iron Cross]] for his successful leadership.{{sfn|Fellgiebel|2000|p=198}} During the [[1940 Field Marshal Ceremony]], Hitler promoted Göring to the rank of ''[[Reichsmarschall]] des Grossdeutschen Reiches'' (Reich Marshal of the Greater German Reich), a special rank which made him senior to all field marshals in the military, including the Luftwaffe. As a result of his promotion, he was then the top ranking soldier of all Germany until the end of the war. Göring had already received the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] on 30 September 1939 as Commander in Chief of the Luftwaffe.{{sfn|Fellgiebel|2000|p=198}}

The UK had declared war on Germany immediately after the invasion of Poland. In July 1940, Hitler began preparations for an invasion of Britain. As part of the plan, the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) had to be neutralized. Bombing raids commenced on British air installations and on cities and centres of industry.{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=113, 136, 143}} Göring had by then already announced in a radio speech, "If as much as a single enemy aircraft flies over German soil, my name is Meier!",{{sfn|Oestermann|2001|p=157}} something that would return to haunt him, when the RAF began bombing German cities on 11 May 1940.{{sfn|Selwood|2015}} Though he was confident the Luftwaffe could defeat the RAF within days, Göring, like Admiral [[Erich Raeder]], commander-in-chief of the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' (navy),{{sfn|Raeder|2001|pp=324–325}} was pessimistic about the chance of success of the planned invasion (codenamed [[Operation Sea Lion]]).{{sfn|Bungay|2000|p=337}} Göring hoped that a victory in the air would be enough to force peace without an invasion. The campaign failed, and Sea Lion was postponed indefinitely on 17 September 1940.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=144}} After their defeat in the [[Battle of Britain]], the Luftwaffe attempted to defeat Britain via [[strategic bombing]]. On 12 October 1940 Hitler cancelled Sea Lion due to the onset of winter.{{sfn|Taylor|1965|p=500}} By the end of the year, it was clear that British morale was not being shaken by [[the Blitz]], though the bombings continued through May 1941.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=145}}

=== Decline on all fronts ===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101III-Reprich-012-08, Wolfschanze, Hitler, Ley, Porsche und Göring.jpg|thumb|Hitler meeting Göring and automotive engineer [[Ferdinand Porsche]] at the ''[[Wolf's Lair]]'' in 1942]]
In spite of the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], signed in 1939, Nazi Germany began [[Operation Barbarossa]]—the invasion of the Soviet Union—on 22 June 1941. Initially the Luftwaffe was at an advantage, destroying thousands of Soviet aircraft in the first month of fighting.{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=178–179}} Hitler and his top staff were sure that the campaign would be over by Christmas, and no provisions were made for reserves of men or equipment.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=187}} But, by July, the Germans had only 1,000 planes remaining in operation, and their troop losses were over 213,000 men. The choice was made to concentrate the attack on only one part of the vast front; efforts would be directed at capturing Moscow.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=201}} After the long, but successful, [[Battle of Smolensk (1941)|Battle of Smolensk]], Hitler ordered [[Army Group Centre]] to halt its advance to Moscow and temporarily diverted its Panzer groups north and south to aid in the encirclement of [[Leningrad]] and [[Kiev]].{{sfn|Stolfi|1982}} The pause provided the Red Army with an opportunity to mobilize fresh reserves; historian Russel Stolfi considers it to be one of the major factors that caused the failure of the Moscow offensive, which was resumed in October 1941 with the [[Battle of Moscow]].{{sfn|Stolfi|1982}} Poor weather conditions, fuel shortages, a delay in building aircraft bases in Eastern Europe, and overstretched supply lines were also factors. Hitler did not give permission for even a partial retreat until mid-January 1942; by this time the losses were comparable to those of the [[French invasion of Russia]] in 1812.{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=207–213}}

Hitler decided that the summer 1942 campaign would be concentrated in the south; efforts would be made to capture the oilfields in the [[Caucasus]].{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=404–405}} The [[Battle of Stalingrad]], a major turning point of the war,{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=421}} began on 23 August 1942 with a bombing campaign by the Luftwaffe.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=409}} The [[6th Army (Wehrmacht)|Sixth Army]] entered the city, but because of its location on the front line, it was still possible for the Soviets to encircle and trap it there without reinforcements or supplies. When the Sixth Army was surrounded by the end of November in [[Operation Uranus]], Göring promised that the Luftwaffe would be able to deliver a minimum of 300 tons of supplies to the trapped men every day. On the basis of these assurances, Hitler demanded that there be no retreat; they were to fight to the last man. Though some airlifts were able to get through, the amount of supplies delivered never exceeded 120 tons per day.{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=412–413}}{{sfn|Speer|1971|p=329}} The remnants of the German Sixth Army—some 91,000 men out of an army of 285,000—surrendered in early February 1943; only 5,000 of these captives survived the Russian prisoner of war camps to see Germany again.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=932}}

=== War over Germany ===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1977-149-13, Hermann Göring, Adolf Hitler, Albert Speer.jpg|thumb|Göring with Hitler and [[Albert Speer]], 10 August 1943]]
Meanwhile, the strength of the US and British bomber fleets had increased. Based in Britain, they began [[Defence of the Reich|operations against German targets]]. The first thousand-bomber raid was staged [[Bombing of Cologne in World War II|on Cologne]] on 30 May 1942.{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=438, 441}} Air raids continued on targets further from England after auxiliary fuel tanks were installed on US [[fighter aircraft]]. Göring refused to believe reports that American fighters had been shot down as far east as [[Aachen]] in winter 1943. His reputation began to decline.{{sfn|Speer|1971|p=378}}

The American [[P-51 Mustang]], with a [[combat radius]] of over {{convert|1800|mi}} when using underwing [[drop tank]]s, began to escort the bombers in large formations to and from the target area in early 1944. From that point onwards, the Luftwaffe began to suffer casualties in aircrews it could not sufficiently replace. By targeting oil refineries and rail communications, [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bombers crippled the German war effort by late 1944.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=461}} German civilians blamed Göring for his failure to protect the homeland.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=447}} Hitler began excluding him from conferences, but continued him in his positions at the head of the Luftwaffe and as plenipotentiary of the Four Year Plan.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=296, 297, 299}} As he lost Hitler's trust, Göring began to spend more time at his various residences.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=510}} On [[D-Day]] (6 June 1944), the Luftwaffe only had some 300 fighters and a small number of bombers in the area of the landings; the Allies had a total strength of 11,000 aircraft.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=295, 302}}

=== End of the war ===
{{see also|Göring Telegram}}
[[File:Goeringcaptivity.jpg|thumb|Göring in captivity 9 May 1945]]

As the Soviets approached Berlin, Hitler's efforts to organise the defence of the city became ever more meaningless and futile.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=725}} His last birthday, celebrated at the ''[[Führerbunker]]'' in Berlin on 20 April 1945, was the occasion for leave-taking for many top Nazis, Göring included. By this time, Carinhall had been evacuated, the building destroyed,{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=310}} and its art treasures moved to [[Berchtesgaden]] and elsewhere.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=722}} Göring arrived at his estate at [[Obersalzberg]] on 22 April, the same day that Hitler, in a lengthy diatribe against his generals, first publicly admitted that the war was lost and that he intended to remain in Berlin to the end and then commit suicide.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=723}} He also stated that Göring was in a better position to negotiate a peace settlement. In 1941—a week after the start of the Soviet invasion—Hitler had issued a decree naming Göring his successor in the event of his death.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=1115}}

OKW operations chief [[Alfred Jodl]] was present for Hitler's rant, and notified Göring's chief of staff, [[Karl Koller (general)|Karl Koller]], at a meeting a few hours later. Sensing its implications, Koller immediately flew to Berchtesgaden to notify Göring, who feared being accused of treason if he tried to take power. On the other hand, if he did nothing, he feared being accused of dereliction of duty. After some hesitation, Göring reviewed his copy of the 1941 decree naming him Hitler's successor. It not only placed Göring first in the line of succession, but also stated that, if Hitler ever lost his freedom of action, Göring had complete authority to act on Hitler's behalf as his deputy. After conferring with Koller and [[Hans Lammers]], the state secretary of the Reich Chancellery, Göring concluded that, by remaining in Berlin to face certain death, Hitler had incapacitated himself from governing. All agreed that Göring therefore had a clear duty to take power in Hitler's stead.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=1116}} He was also motivated by fears that his rival, [[Martin Bormann]], would seize power upon Hitler's death and would have him killed as a traitor. With this in mind, Göring sent a carefully worded telegram asking Hitler for permission to take over as the leader of Germany, stressing that he would be acting as Hitler's deputy. He added that, if Hitler did not reply by 22:00 that night (23 April), he would assume that Hitler had indeed lost his freedom of action, and would assume leadership of the Reich.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=315}}

[[File:SFP 186 - Hermann Göring.ogv|left|thumb|Göring after his capture (May 1945)]]

The telegram was intercepted by Bormann, who convinced Hitler that Göring was a traitor and that the telegram was a demand to resign or be overthrown. Hitler sent a reply to Göring{{mdash}}prepared with Bormann's help{{mdash}}informing him that, unless he resigned immediately, he would be executed for high treason. Soon afterward, Hitler removed Göring from all of his offices and ordered Göring, his staff, and Lammers placed under house arrest at Obersalzberg.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=1118}}{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=724}} Bormann made an announcement over the radio that Göring had resigned for health reasons.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=318}}

By 26 April, the complex at Obersalzberg was under attack by the Allies, so Göring was moved to [[Burg Mauterndorf|his castle at Mauterndorf]]. In his [[Last will and testament of Adolf Hitler|last will and testament]], Hitler expelled Göring from the party and formally rescinded the decree making him his successor. He then appointed [[Karl Dönitz]], the Navy's commander-in-chief, as president of the Reich and commander-in-chief of the armed forces. Hitler and his wife, [[Eva Braun]], [[Death of Adolf Hitler|committed suicide]] on 30 April 1945, a few hours after a hastily arranged wedding. Göring was freed on 5 May by a passing Luftwaffe unit, and he made his way to the US lines in hopes of surrendering to them rather than to the Soviets. He was taken into custody near [[Radstadt]] on 6 May by elements of the [[36th Infantry Division (United States)|36th Infantry Division]] of the [[United States Army|US Army]].{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=320–325}} This move likely saved Göring's life; Bormann had ordered him executed if Berlin had fallen.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=1128}}{{clear left}}

Göring was flown to [[Camp Ashcan]], a temporary prisoner-of-war camp housed in the Palace Hotel at [[Mondorf-les-Bains]], Luxembourg. Here he was weaned off [[dihydrocodeine]] (a mild morphine derivative)—he had been taking the equivalent of three or four grains (260 to 320&amp;nbsp;mg) of morphine a day—and was put on a strict diet; he lost {{convert|60|lb}}. His IQ was tested while in custody and found to be 138.{{sfn|Gilbert|1995|p=31}} Top Nazi officials were transferred in September to [[Nuremberg]], which was to be the location of a series of military tribunals beginning in November.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=329–331}}

Göring was the second-highest-ranking Nazi official tried at Nuremberg, behind Reich President (former Admiral) Karl Dönitz. The prosecution levelled an indictment of four charges, including a charge of conspiracy; waging a war of aggression; war crimes, including the plundering and removal to Germany of works of art and other property; and crimes against humanity, including the disappearance of political and other opponents under the ''[[Nacht und Nebel]]'' (Night and Fog) decree; the torture and ill-treatment of prisoners of war; and the murder and enslavement of civilians, including what was at the time estimated to be 5,700,000 Jews. Not permitted to present a lengthy statement, Göring declared himself to be "in the sense of the indictment not guilty".{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=336–337}} 

[[File:Defendants in the dock at the Nuremberg Trials.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Göring (first row, far left) at the [[Nuremberg trial]]]]

The trial lasted 218 days; the prosecution presented their case from November through March, and Göring's defence{{mdash}}the first to be presented{{mdash}}lasted from 8 to 22 March. The sentences were read out on 30 September 1946.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=337}} Göring, forced to remain silent while seated in the dock, communicated his opinions about the proceedings using gestures, shaking his head, or laughing. He constantly took notes and whispered with the other defendants, and tried to control the erratic behaviour of [[Rudolf Hess|Hess]], who was seated beside him.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=339}} During breaks in the proceedings, Göring tried to dominate the other defendants, and he was eventually placed in solitary confinement when he attempted to influence their testimony.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=341–342}} Göring told US psychiatrist [[Leon Goldensohn]] that the court was "stupid" to try "little fellows" like Funk and [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner|Kaltenbrunner]] instead of letting Göring take all the blame on himself.{{sfn|Goldensohn|2004|}} He also claimed that he had never heard of most of the other defendants before the trial.{{sfn|Goldensohn|2004|}}

Captain [[Gustave Gilbert]], a German-speaking US intelligence officer and psychologist, interviewed Göring and the others in prison during the trial.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=339}} Gilbert kept a journal, which he later published as ''[[Nuremberg Diary]]''. Here he describes Göring on the evening of 18 April 1946, as the trials were halted for a three-day Easter recess:

[[File:Hermann Goering - Nuremberg2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.02|Göring at the Nuremberg Trials]]

{{quote|sign=Cpt. Gustave Gilbert|source=|Sweating in his cell in the evening, Göring was defensive and deflated and not very happy over the turn the trial was taking. He said that he had no control over the actions or the defense of the others, and that he had never been anti-Semitic himself, had not believed these atrocities, and that several Jews had offered to testify on his behalf.{{sfn|Gilbert|1995|p=278}}}}

On several occasions over the course of the trial, the prosecution showed films of the [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] and other atrocities. Everyone present, including Göring, found the contents of the films shocking; he said that the films must have been faked. Witnesses, including Paul Koerner and [[Erhard Milch]], tried to portray Göring as a peaceful moderate. Milch stated it had been impossible to oppose Hitler or disobey his orders; to do so would likely have meant death for oneself and one's family.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=343–347}} When testifying on his own behalf, Göring emphasised his loyalty to Hitler, and claimed to know nothing about what had happened in the concentration camps, which were under Himmler's control. He gave evasive, convoluted answers to direct questions and had plausible excuses for all his actions during the war. He used the witness stand as a venue to expound at great length on his own role in the Reich, attempting to present himself as a peacemaker and diplomat before the outbreak of the war.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=359–367}} During cross-examination, chief prosecutor [[Robert H. Jackson]] read out the minutes of a meeting that had been held shortly after [[Kristallnacht]], a major [[pogrom]] in November 1938. At the meeting, Göring had plotted to confiscate Jewish property in the wake of the pogrom.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=369}} Later, [[David Maxwell Fyfe, 1st Earl of Kilmuir|David Maxwell-Fyfe]] proved it was impossible for Göring not to have known about the [[Stalag Luft III murders]]{{mdash}}the shooting of fifty airmen who had been recaptured after escaping from [[Stalag Luft III]]{{mdash}}in time to have prevented the killings.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=371}} He also presented clear evidence that Göring knew about the extermination of the [[Hungarian Jews]].{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=374–375}}

[[File:Goering-corpse.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Göring's corpse]]

Göring was found guilty on all four counts and was sentenced to death by hanging. The judgment stated:

{{quote|There is nothing to be said in mitigation. For Göring was often, indeed almost always, the moving force, second only to his leader. He was the leading war aggressor, both as political and as military leader; he was the director of the slave labour programme and the creator of the oppressive programme against the Jews and other races, at home and abroad. All of these crimes he has frankly admitted. On some specific cases there may be conflict of testimony, but in terms of the broad outline, his own admissions are more than sufficiently wide to be conclusive of his guilt. His guilt is unique in its enormity. The record discloses no excuses for this man.{{sfn|International Military Tribunal|1946}}}}

Göring made an appeal asking to be shot as a soldier instead of hanged as a common criminal, but the court refused.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=392–393}} Defying the sentence imposed by his captors, he committed suicide with a [[potassium cyanide]] capsule the night before he was to be hanged.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=964}}

One theory as to how Göring obtained the poison holds that US Army Lieutenant Jack G. Wheelis, who was stationed at the Nuremberg Trials, retrieved the capsules from their hiding place among Göring's personal effects that had been confiscated by the Army and handed them over to the prisoner,{{sfn|Taylor|1992|p=623}} after being bribed by Göring, who gave him his gold watch, pen, and cigarette case.{{sfn|Botting|2006|p=280}} In 2005, former US Army Private Herbert Lee Stivers, who served in the [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Infantry Division]]'s [[26th Infantry Regiment]]{{mdash}}the honour guard for the Nuremberg Trials{{mdash}}claimed he gave Göring "medicine" hidden inside a fountain pen that a German woman had asked him to smuggle into the prison. Stivers later said that he did not know what was in the pill until after Göring's suicide.{{sfn|BBC News|2005}}

Göring's body, as with those of the men who were executed, was displayed at the execution ground for the witnesses of the executions. The bodies were cremated at [[Ostfriedhof (Munich)|Ostfriedhof]], Munich, and the ashes were scattered in the [[Isar]] River.{{sfn|Darnstädt|2005}}{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=393}}{{sfn|Overy|2001|p=205}}

== Personal properties ==
{{see also|Nazi plunder|Reichswerke Hermann Göring}}
[[File:Göering weapon and baton.jpg|thumb|upright|Göring's ''Reichsmarschall'' baton and [[Smith &amp; Wesson]] revolver. To the left is the silver-bound guest book from [[Carinhall]]. ([[West Point Museum]])]]
Göring's name is closely associated with the Nazi plunder of Jewish property. His name appears 135 times on the [[Nazi plunder#Art Looting Investigation Unit (ALIU) Reports 1945-1946 and ALIU Red Flag Names List and Index|OSS Art Looting Investigation Unit (ALIU) Red Flag Names List]]{{sfn|OSS Reports}} compiled by US Army intelligence in 1945-6 and declassified in 1997.{{sfn|NARA Records}}

The confiscation of Jewish property gave Göring the opportunity to amass a personal fortune. Some properties he seized himself or acquired for a nominal price. In other cases, he collected bribes for allowing others to steal Jewish property. He took [[Political corruption|kickbacks]] from industrialists for favourable decisions as Four Year Plan director, and money for supplying arms to the Spanish Republicans in the [[Foreign involvement in the Spanish Civil War|Spanish Civil War]] via [[Pyrkal]] in Greece (although Germany was supporting Franco and the Nationalists).{{sfn|Beevor|2006|pp=366–368, 538}}

Göring was appointed Reich Master of the Hunt in 1933 and Master of the German Forests in 1934. He instituted reforms to the forestry laws and acted to protect endangered species. Around this time he became interested in [[Schorfheide-Chorin Biosphere Reserve|Schorfheide Forest]], where he set aside {{convert|100000|acres|km2}} as a state park, which is still extant. There he built an elaborate hunting lodge, [[Carinhall]], in memory of his first wife, Carin. By 1934, her body had been transported to the site and placed in a vault on the estate.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=120–123}} The main lodge had a large art gallery where Göring displayed works that had been plundered from private collections and museums around Europe from 1939 onward.{{sfn|Speer|1971|pp=244–245}}{{sfn|Rothfeld|2002}} Göring worked closely with the ''Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg'' ([[Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce]]), an organisation tasked with the looting of artwork and cultural material from Jewish collections, libraries, and museums throughout Europe.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=283–285}} Headed by [[Alfred Rosenberg]], the task force set up a collection centre and headquarters in Paris. Some 26,000 railroad cars full of art treasures, furniture, and other looted items were sent to Germany from France alone. Göring repeatedly visited the Paris headquarters to review the incoming stolen goods and to select items to be sent on a special train to Carinhall and his other homes.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=283–285, 291}} The estimated value of his collection—numbering some 1,500 pieces—was $200 million.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=281}}

[[File:Mundur Goeringa.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Göring's uniform on display at the ''[[Luftwaffenmuseum der Bundeswehr]]'']]

Göring was known for his extravagant tastes and garish clothing. He had various special uniforms made for the many posts he held;{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=115–116}} his ''Reichsmarschall'' uniform included a jewel-encrusted baton. [[Hans-Ulrich Rudel]], the top ''[[Stuka]]'' pilot of the war, recalled twice meeting Göring dressed in outlandish costumes: first, a medieval hunting costume, practicing archery with his doctor; and second, dressed in a red [[toga]] fastened with a golden clasp, smoking an unusually large pipe. Italian Foreign Minister [[Galeazzo Ciano]] once noted Göring wearing a fur coat that looked like what "a high grade prostitute wears to the opera."{{sfn|Fussell|2002|pp=24–25}} He threw lavish housewarming parties each time a round of construction was completed at Carinhall, and changed costumes several times throughout the evenings.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=122}}

Göring was noted for his patronage of music, especially opera. He entertained frequently and sumptuously, and hosted elaborate birthday parties for himself.{{sfn|Speer|1971|p=417}} Armaments minister [[Albert Speer]] recalled that guests brought expensive gifts such as gold bars, Dutch cigars, and valuable artwork. For his birthday in 1944, Speer gave Göring an oversize marble bust of Hitler.{{sfn|Speer|1971|pp=416–417}} As a member of the Prussian Council of State, Speer was required to donate a considerable portion of his salary towards the Council's birthday gift to Göring without even being asked. ''Generalfeldmarschall'' [[Erhard Milch]] told Speer that similar donations were required out of the Air Ministry's general fund.{{sfn|Speer|1971|pp=417–418}} For his birthday in 1940, Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano decorated Göring with the coveted [[Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation|Collar of Annunziata]]. The award reduced him to tears.{{sfn|Mosley|1974|p=280}}

[[File:Standarte des Reichsmarschalls (1941–45).jpg|thumb|Standard, on display at the ''Musée de la Guerre'' in [[Les Invalides]], Paris]]

The design of the ''Reichsmarschall'' standard, on a light blue field, featured a gold [[German eagle]] grasping a wreath surmounted by two batons overlaid with a [[swastika]]. The reverse side of the flag had the ''Großkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes'' ("[[Grand Cross of the Iron Cross]]") surrounded by a wreath between four Luftwaffe eagles. The flag was carried by a personal standard-bearer at all public occasions.

Though he liked to be called "''der Eiserne''" (the Iron Man), the once dashing and muscular fighter pilot had become corpulent. He was one of the few Nazi leaders who did not take offence at hearing jokes about himself, "no matter how rude", taking them as a sign of popularity. Germans joked about his ego, saying that he would wear an admiral's uniform with rubber medals to take a bath, and his obesity, joking that "he sits down on his stomach".{{sfn|Block|Trow|1971|p=330}}{{sfn|Gunther|1940|p=65}} One joke claimed that he had sent a wire to Hitler after his visit to the Vatican: "Mission accomplished. Pope unfrocked. Tiara and pontifical vestments are a perfect fit."{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=409}}{{clear left}}

== Complicity in the Holocaust ==
{{see also|Luftwaffe#War crimes}}
[[File:Carta Göring.JPG|thumb|Göring's July 1941 letter to [[Reinhard Heydrich]]]]
[[Joseph Goebbels]] and Himmler were far more antisemitic than Göring, who mainly adopted that attitude because party politics required him to do so.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=136–137}} His deputy, [[Erhard Milch]], had a Jewish parent. But Göring supported the [[Nuremberg Laws]] of 1935, and later initiated economic measures unfavourable to Jews.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=136–137}} He required the registration of all Jewish property as part of the Four Year Plan, and at a meeting held after Kristallnacht was livid that the financial burden for the Jewish losses would have to be made good by German-owned insurance companies. He proposed that the Jews be fined one billion marks.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=189–191}}

At the same meeting, options for the disposition of the Jews and their property were discussed. Jews would be segregated into ghettos or encouraged to emigrate, and their property would be seized in a programme of [[Aryanization (Nazism)|Aryanization]]. Compensation for seized property would be low, if any was given at all.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=189–191}} Detailed minutes of this meeting and other documents were read out at the Nuremberg trial, proving his knowledge of and complicity with the persecution of the Jews.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=369}} He told Gilbert that he would never have supported the anti-Jewish measures if he had known what was going to happen. "I only thought we would eliminate Jews from positions in big business and government", he claimed.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=378}}

In July 1941, Göring issued a memo to [[Reinhard Heydrich]] ordering him to organise the practical details of the [[Final Solution]] to the "Jewish Question". By the time that this letter was written, many Jews and others had already been killed in Poland, [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russia]], and elsewhere. At the [[Wannsee Conference]], held six months later, Heydrich formally announced that genocide of the Jews was now official Reich policy. Göring did not attend the conference, but he was present at other meetings where the number of people killed was discussed.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=259–260}}{{sfn|Blood|2001|p=75}}

Göring directed [[anti-partisan]] operations by Luftwaffe security battalions in the [[Białowieża Forest]] between 1942 and 1944 that resulted in the murder of thousands of Jews and Polish civilians.{{sfn|Blood|2010|pp=261–262, 266}}

== Support of anti-Nazi brother ==
{{main article|Albert Göring}}

Göring's younger brother Albert despised [[Nazism]], and offered active resistance to the regime, including helping prisoners escape from concentration camps. He was arrested four times, but Hermann secured his release each time. Hermann's daughter [[Edda Göring|Edda]] told ''[[The Guardian]]'' that Albert "could certainly help people in need himself financially and with his personal influence, but as soon as it was necessary to involve higher authority or officials, then he had to have the support of my father, which he did get."{{sfn|Burke|2010}}

{{Expand French|date=January 2016}}
'''Imigongo''' ({{IPA-rw|imiɡoːŋɡo|Kinyarwanda:}}) is an [[art form]] popular in [[Rwanda]] traditionally made by women using [[cow dung]]. Often in the colors black, white and red, popular themes include spiral and geometric designs that are painted on walls, pottery, and canvas. 

The images are produced using cow dung which is put onto wooden boards in spiral and geometric designs.  The dung is left to harden and is then decorated using colours made from organic material. The traditional colours are black, white, red, grey and beige-yellow but increasingly other colours are used.

The imigongo images were originally found in [[Kibungo]] inside the walls of huts as "magical" decorations during the 18th century.

During the 1994 [[Rwandan Genocide|Genocide]] the skills involved almost disappeared. However, a women's cooperative on the road to [[Rusumo, Rwanda|Rusumo]] in the [[Eastern Province, Rwanda|Eastern Province]] near [[Kirehe]] has rescued and revived this uniquely Rwandan art form.  Traditionally geometric designs are produced but as the women artists have grown in confidence they have begun to experiment with more modern, innovative images that convey the spirit of the Rwandan landscape, its flora and fauna and its people.

'''The Israel Painters and Sculptors Association''' was established in 1934 and has been associated with many painters and sculptors who worked in Israel. With the establishment of the State of Israel, the name of the association was changed to the "Association of Painters and Sculptors in Israel". In 2002, the name was changed again to "Painters and Sculptors Association ([[Tel Aviv]])" and three independent associations of painters and sculptors were established in [[Jerusalem Artists House|Jerusalem]], Haifa and Be'er Sheva.

== Hebrew Artists Association ==
The association was founded in October 1920 by the Association of Hebrew Artists, in its committee were the following artists: Meir Gur-Arie, S. Ben-David, [[Abel Pann]], Avraham Melnikov and Shmuel Opel. The aim of the association was to "develop and disseminate among the people the arts, the art work and taste and beauty in the Hebrew spirit." In April 1921 the members of the association presented an exhibition at the [[Tower of David]].

Since 1923, the association has exhibited 19 different group exhibitions. These were eclectic exhibitions with many works of art on various artistic levels. Alongside these exhibitions, occasional group exhibitions were held on a commercial or artistic basis.

In addition, the Society created the Painting and Sculpture Section of the journal "Theater and Art" which was published in 1927.

== Association of Painters and Sculptors ==
On August 4, 1934, the first convention of the Association of Painters and Sculptors was held in Tel Aviv. There was talk about building a pavilion for exhibitions and a permanent exhibition, establishing a cooperative of painters, a club, mutual help and housing for the members of the association. A committee was chosen, composed of [[Chaim Gliksberg]], [[Nahum Gutman]], Newman, Avni, Yishai Kolbiansky, Leoben and Eliahu Sigard. Gliksberg was the association secretary. On August 14, a parallel assembly was held in Jerusalem, in which a committee was appointed that included [[Zeev Ben Zvi]], Meir Gur-Arie and [[Jacob Steinhardt]].

One of the association's exhibitions, "The Eighth Exhibition," took place in December 1942 at [[Habima Theatre]], where the works of [[Arie Aroch]], Aharon Giladi, Zvi Meirovitch, Avraham Natan (Nathanson), [[Avigdor Stematsky]] and [[Yehezkel Streichman]] were exhibited. Another sculptor, [[Dov Feigin]] appeared in the catalog but did not participate in the exhibition at last. Another exhibition – "The Shiva Exhibition" – took place in 1947 at the [[Tel Aviv Museum]], with the participation of Aroch, Giladi, Meirovitch, Natan, Streichman, Jacob Wexler and [[Yosef Zaritsky]]. In these exhibitions, the artists aspired to the creation of modern art under European influence and to create "an original style, rooted in our reality." In these exhibitions, although they did not establish a clear artistic platform, there was a tendency to emphasize the painterly means. In addition, these exhibitions symbolized a certain separation and a "positive appearance" of the artists against the background of the "generalism" regime ... which helps blur the boundaries and dimensions, in order to impose mediocrity "

In 1948,[[Yosef Zaritsky]] served as chairman of the association, and when an invitation came to present an exhibition of Israeli artists in the Italian pavilion at the [[Venice Biennale]], he chose not to share the list of participating artists because of his concern about the selection of medium-sized artists. In the wake of the accusations, several artists, including [[Moshe Castel]], Streichman and [[Yohanan Simon]], announced their immediate retirement from the association, and they established with Zaritsky the "[[Ofakim Hadashim]]".

From 1964 to 1967, [[Ruth Horam]] served as the chairperson of the Association

From 1969 to 1981, [[Alexander Bogen]] served as chairman of the Association.

In the years 1989–2005, Rachel Shavit-Bentwich served as chairperson of the Association and as Chairperson of the Honorary Council.

==History==

The effect is named after [[Jack Kirby]], the influential comic book artist who created this stylistic device.&lt;ref name="Mendryk"/&gt; While the Kirby Krackle in its mature form first appeared in Kirby's work during 1965–1966 (in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' and ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]''),&lt;ref name="Foley"/&gt; comics historian Harry Mendryk (of the Jack Kirby Museum &amp; Research Center) has traced the earliest version of the stylistic device as far back as 1940 to Jack Kirby &amp; [[Joe Simon]]'s ''[[Blue Bolt]] #5''. As Joe Simon was the [[inker]] on that comic, he may have been partially responsible for look of the proto-Kirby Krackle. Examples of a transitional form of the Kirby Krackle appear in two of Kirby's stories from the late 1950s: ''The Man Who Collected Planets'' from 1957 (pencils and inks by Kirby) and ''The Negative Man'' from 1959 (inks attributed to Marvin Stein).&lt;ref name="Mendryk"/&gt;

==Analysis==
Philosophy professor and author [[Jeffrey J. Kripal]] wrote:

{{quote|For Kirby, the human body is a manifestation or crystallization of finally inexplicable energies—a superbody. [...] What [[Franz Mesmer|Mesmer]] called [[animal magnetism]], [[Carl Reichenbach|Reichenbach]] knew as the [[Odic force|blue od]], and [[Wilhelm Reich|Reich]] saw as a radiating blue cosmic [[orgone]] becomes in Jack Kirby a trademark energetics signaled by "burst lines" and a unique energy field of black, blobby dots that has come to be affectionately known as the "Kirby Krackle" [...]. The final result was a vision of the human being as a body of frozen energy that, like an atomic bomb, could be released with stunning effects, for good or for evil. These metaphysical energies, I want to suggest constitute the secret [[Source (comics)|Source]] of Kirby's art.&lt;ref name="Kripal"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5CS09XNEr38C&amp;pg=PT286&amp;lpg=PT286 | title=Mutants and Mystics: Science Fiction, Superhero Comics, and the Paranormal | publisher=University of Chicago Press | last=Kripal| first= Jeffrey J. | year=2011 | location=Chicago, IL | pages=286–287 | isbn=9780226453859}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Hugh McGuire.jpg|thumb|Hugh McGuire, founder of LibriVox]]
{{Cquote|Can the net harness a bunch of volunteers to help bring books in the public domain to life through [[podcasting]]?|author=Hugh McGuire}}

LibriVox was started in August 2005 by [[Montreal]]-based writer Hugh McGuire, who set up a [[blog]], and posed the question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Hugh|last= McGuire|date=9 August 2005|url=http://librivox.org/2005/08/09/welcome-to-librivox/|title=Welcome to LibriVox|publisher=LibriVox.org|accessdate=20 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first=Hugh|last=McGuire|url=http://hughmcguire.net/2007/02/12/from-textosolvo-clarity-why-it-worked-1/|title=Clarity (blog entry)|date=February 12, 2007|publisher=HughMcGuire.net|accessdate=2009-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first recorded book&lt;ref&gt;"[https://librivox.org/the-secret-agent-by-joseph-conrad/ The Secret Agent]", librivox.org. Retrieved 31 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; was ''[[The Secret Agent]]'' by [[Joseph Conrad]].

The main features of the way LibriVox works have changed little since its inception, although the technology that supports it has been improved by the efforts of its volunteers with web-development skills.

== Etymology of LibriVox ==
''LibriVox'' is an invented word inspired by [[Latin]] words {{lang|la|liber}} (book) in its [[genitive]] form {{lang|la|libri}} and {{lang|la|vox}} (voice), giving the meaning ''BookVoice'' (or ''voice of the book''). The word was also coined because of other connotations: {{lang|la|liber}} also means ''child'' and ''free, independent, unrestricted''. As the LibriVox forum says: "We like to think LibriVox might be interpreted as 'child of the voice', and 'free voice'. Finally, the other link we like is 'library' so you could imagine it to mean Library of Voice."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://forum.librivox.org/viewtopic.php?f=18&amp;t=876 What does LibriVox mean?]", LibriVox forum, retrieved 29 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been no decision or consensus by LibriVox founders or the community of volunteers for a single pronunciation of LibriVox. It is accepted that any audible pronunciation is accurate.&lt;ref name="librivoxpronunciation"&gt;"[http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/English_Pronunciation_Guides#Pronunciation_of_.22LibriVox.22 Pronunciation of "LibriVox"]", LibriVox wiki. Retrieved 21 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization and funding ==
LibriVox is a volunteer-run, free content, Public Domain project. It has no budget or [[legal person]]ality. The development of projects is managed through an [[Internet forum]], supported by an [[Forum administrator|admin]] team, who also maintain a searchable catalogue database of completed works.

In early 2010, LibriVox ran a fundraising drive to raise $20,000 to cover hosting costs for the website of about $5,000/year and improve front- and backend usability.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://librivox.org/2010/02/24/librivox-needs-your-help/ LibriVox Needs Your Help]", LibriVox blog, 24 February 2010. Retrieved 24 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The target was reached in 13 days, and so the fundraising ended and LibriVox suggested that supporters consider making donations to its affiliates and partners, [[Project Gutenberg]] &lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:Partners,_Affiliates_and_Resources Gutenberg Affiliates]", Gutenberg.org, Retrieved 19 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Internet Archive]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://archive.org/details/librivoxaudio&amp;tab=about Archive.org partners]", Archive.org, Retrieved 19 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production process==
Volunteers can choose new projects to start, either recording on their own or inviting others to join them, or they can contribute to projects that have been started by others. Once a volunteer has recorded his or her contribution, it is uploaded to the site, and proof-listened by members of the LibriVox community.

Finished audiobooks are available from the LibriVox website, and [[MP3]] and [[Vorbis|Ogg Vorbis]] files are hosted separately by the [[Internet Archive]]. Recordings are also available through other means, such as [[iTunes Store|iTunes]], and, being free of copyright, they are frequently distributed independently of LibriVox on the Internet and otherwise.

==Content==
[[File:LibriVox works per month including May 2011.png|thumb|LibriVox works per month 2005–2011]]
LibriVox only records material that is in the [[public domain]] in the United States, and all LibriVox books are released with a public domain dedication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Public Domain |url=https://librivox.org/pages/public-domain/ |website=LibriVox |accessdate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of copyright restrictions, LibriVox produces recordings of only a limited number of contemporary books. These have included, for example, the [[9/11 Commission Report]] which is a work of the US Federal Government therefore in the Public Domain. 

The LibriVox catalogue is varied. It contains much popular classic fiction, but also includes less predictable texts, such as [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' and a recording of the first 500 digits of [[pi]]. The collection also features poetry, plays, religious texts (for example, English versions of the [[Koran]] and books from various translations of the [[Bible]]) and non-fiction of various kinds. In January 2009, the catalogue contained approximately 55 percent fiction and drama, 25 percent non-fiction and 20 percent poetry (calculated by numbers of recordings). As of November 7, 2018, the most viewed item (6.5M) was ''[[The Adventures of Tom Sawyer]]'' in a 2006 solo recording by John Greenman.&lt;ref name="librivoxatia"&gt;"[https://archive.org/details/librivoxaudio The LibriVox Free Audiobook Collection]", The [[Internet Archive]]. Retrieved 7 November, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 90 percent of the catalogue is recorded in English, but recordings exist in 31 languages altogether ({{as of|2010|2|lc=y}}). Chinese, French and German are the most popular languages other than English amongst volunteers, but recordings have also been made in languages including [[Urdu]] and [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]].

==Reputation==
LibriVox has garnered significant interest, in particular from those interested in the promotion of volunteer-led content and alternative approaches to [[copyright]] ownership on the Internet.

It has received support from the [[Internet Archive]] and [[Project Gutenberg]]. Intellectual freedom and commons proponent [[Mike Linksvayer]] described it in 2008 as "perhaps the most interesting collaborative culture project this side of [[Wikipedia]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | date=June 2, 2008
 | accessdate=2009-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project has also been featured in press around the world and has been recommended by the BBC's [[Click (TV series)|Click]], MSNBC's [[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]], [[Reason (magazine)|Reason]],&lt;ref name="LibriVoxReason"&gt;"[http://reason.com/archives/2007/04/24/the-wealth-of-librivox/ The Wealth of LibriVox]", Reason.com, Retrieved 19 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]],&lt;ref name="LibriVoxWired"&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20080512012632/http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2005/12/69780 The Web Will Read You a Story]", archive.org, Retrieved 19 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; the US [[PC Magazine]] and the UK [[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]] and [[The Sunday Times|Sunday Times]]&lt;ref name="NYTLibriVox"&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/25/books/25audi.html?_r=2&amp; Public Domain Books, Ready for Your iPod]", nytimes.com, Retrieved 19 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; newspapers.

==Quality==
A frequent concern of listeners is the site's policy of allowing any recording to be published as long as it is understandable and faithful to the source text.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://forum.librivox.org/viewtopic.php?f=24&amp;t=36873 Quality of Delivery?]", Librivox forums. Retrieved 22 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that some recordings are of lower audio fidelity; some feature background noises, non-native accents or other perceived imperfections in comparison to professionally recorded audiobooks.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.reviewsandmore.net/2007/01/07/the-return-of-the-native-audiobook-librivox/ The Return of the Native Audiobook (Librivox)]", Review. Retrieved 22 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://piratelibrary.com/2010/on-the-absence-of-ratings-at-librivox On the absence of ratings at LibriVox]", Review 2 May 2010. Retrieved 22 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; While some listeners may object to those books with chapters read by multiple readers,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.reviewstream.com/reviews/?p=122685 Librivox - free audio books]", Review. Retrieved 22 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; others find this to be a non-issue or even a feature,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.thesoapboxers.com/librivox-free-audio-books/ Librivox (free audio books)]", Review January 09, 2009. Retrieved 22 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.m-e-wood.com/2008/10/librivox/ Librivox]", Review October 1, 2008.

[[File:The wild flowers of California (Page 093) (7176729246).jpg|thumb|Ladies' Tresses or ''Spiranthes Romanzoffianum'' (now ''[[Spiranthes romanzoffiana]]''), from a drawing by Margaret Warriner Buck for ''The Wild Flowers of California'']]
'''Margaret Warriner Buck''' (April 29, 1857 - April 5, 1929) was a botanical artist known as a specialist in depicting California wildflowers.

==Biography==
Buck was born Margaret Warriner in New York, New York, in 1857.&lt;ref name=dawdy/&gt; She studied art at Yale Art School before moving to San Francisco in 1891. She gained a reputation as a botanical artist and specialist in depicting California wildflowers.&lt;ref name=landauer/&gt; In the 1890s, she and writer [[Mary Elizabeth Parsons]] hiked around California with an eye to publishing a book about California flora. The result was the very successful ''The Wild Flowers of California: Their Names, Haunts, and Habits'' (1897), written by Parsons with over 100 illustrations  engraved from Buck's pen-and-ink drawings.&lt;ref name=hughes/&gt;&lt;ref name=sunset/&gt; It went through many printings and several editions and was still being reprinted into the 1950s.&lt;ref name=dm1957/&gt;&lt;ref name=sands/&gt;

After the San Francisco Earthquake of 1906, she worked for ''Sunset'' magazine.&lt;ref name=landauer/&gt; She died in San Rafael, California, in 1929.&lt;ref name=mj1929/&gt;

'''Mary Battersby''' or '''Miss Battersby''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 1801–1841) was an Irish artist and [[naturalist]].&lt;ref name=Crookshank&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crookshank|first1=Anne|last2=Glin, Knight of|first2=Desmond FitzGerald|title=The watercolours of Ireland : works on paper in pencil, pastel and paint, c.1600–1914|date=1994|publisher=Barrie &amp; Jenkins|location=London|isbn=9780091783693}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Investigations into Mary Battersby have concluded that "nothing is known" about her.&lt;ref name=OConnor&gt;{{cite book|last1=O’Connor|first1=Éimear|editor1-last=O’Connor|editor1-first=Éimear|title=Irish Women Artists, 1800-2009|date=2010|publisher=Four Courts Press|location=Dublin|isbn=9781846822506|chapter=Miss Battersby: A Case Study}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have stated that Battersby was the unmarried daughter of Robert Battersby of Bobsville, County Meath, Ireland, who in 1763 married Marianne, daughter and co-heiress of Haynes Wade of Lislin, County Cavan, Ireland.&lt;ref name=Crookshank /&gt; Others have questioned this, suggesting that she could have been the daughter of Robert Battersby's brother, referred to as John of Lakefield. Her date of birth, based on when she began donating work, is estimated to be between 1763 and 1785. It is possible that the "M" on her paintings did not refer to Mary, but Mrs or Miss, or even a pet name. This means that there a number of women in the Battersby family that the work could be ascribed to, including a Penelope Battersby. Due to the lack of further evidence, a conclusive identity for this artist cannot be ascertained. Some of the donations given of her work is inscribed with the address of the artist as 21 North Cumberland Street, Dublin and later No. 16 Mountjoy Square East. These addresses are presumed to be those of her mother or other relative.&lt;ref name=OConnor /&gt;

==Artistic work==
[[Image:MaryBattersbyRingPlover.jpg|thumb|230px|Painting of a Ringed Plover by Mary Battersby]]

The works of Battersby are all signed "Miss Battersby" or "M:Battersby". Her corpus is six albums of paintings, a record of one letter and two addresses. There is no other documents pertaining to her, and she does not appear to have exhibited at any time. While she is often described as a "flower painter", given her known work, her interest lay more in the observation of birds than botany. It is unknown if Battersby received any formal training in watercolours, though it was not uncommon for young women to receive such training. Though her ornithological work is described as strictly true to life and without extraneous details, though over the course of her work her style did not develop.&lt;ref name=OConnor /&gt;

The [[Royal Dublin Society]] received four volumes of drawings from Miss Battersby, the first in 1820, three in 1836 with a letter. These were ''Flowers drawn from Nature'', ''Drawings from a collection of birds shot in Pennsylvania, North America by Robert Battersby Esq. MD'', ''Native birds which were all shot in the County Meath'', and ''Drawings taken from a collection of stuffed birds in the Dublin Museum''. Another two volumes are in the [[Ulster Museum]],&lt;ref name=Crookshank /&gt; one dated 1841 and the second undated. A small album is also in the collections of the [[National Library of Ireland]], with studies of flowers, butterflies, insects and feathers, it has been suggested that this may have been produced by another member of the Battersby family, Frances Isabella Battersby. The volume of drawings of the stuffed birds from the Dublin Museum, now the [[Natural History Museum (Ireland)|Natural History Museum in Dublin]], consists of life sized studies of the mounted birds in the museum. The studies were of exotic birds including hummingbirds.&lt;ref name=OConnor /&gt;

'''Modern Allegorism''' is a school of [[fine art]] in which the artist uses contemporary elements in an [[allegory|allegorical]] style to communicate a positive and uplifting message to the viewer.

The term was first used in print in a book published in 2007 titled ''Tarnowski: Modern Allegories'' &lt;!-- Published by Masterpiece Publishing, Inc. ISBN #975-0-9790727-0-3 --&gt;about the work of artist [[Glen Tarnowski]]. Tarnowski coined the term to describe artwork that communicated to a modern world in the same way that [[Renaissance]] artists communicated values, ethics and morality to the largely illiterate population of the time.

The three subgenres of Modern Allegorism include whimsical, inspirational/spiritual, and [[paradox]]ical. These subgenres describe the mechanism through which the artist conveys the message. Whimsical modern allegories use humor in a non-critical fashion to encourage the viewer to question their own perspectives and behavior. Inspirational/spiritual modern allegories attempt to inspire the viewer to believe in their own abilities and trust their innate gifts. Paradoxical modern allegories position common elements in ways that are contrary to the viewer's expectation in order to encourage the viewer to evaluate the commonplace and see their own preconceptions in a new light.

{{for|the township in Indiana|Moral Township, Shelby County, Indiana}}

A '''moral''' (from [[Latin]] ''morālis'') is a [[message]] that is conveyed or a lesson to be learned from a [[narrative|story]] or [[wikt:event|event]]. The moral may be left to the hearer, reader, or viewer to determine for themselves, or may be explicitly encapsulated in a [[aphorism|maxim]]. A moral is a lesson in a story or in real life.

==Finding morals==
As an example of an explicit maxim, at the end of [[Aesop's Fables|Aesop's fable]] of [[the Tortoise and the Hare]], in which the plodding and determined tortoise won a race against the much-faster yet extremely arrogant hare, the stated moral is "slow and steady wins the race". However, other morals can often be taken from the story itself; for instance, that arrogance or overconfidence in one's abilities may lead to failure or the loss of an event, race, or contest.

The use of [[stock character]]s is a means of conveying the moral of the story by eliminating complexity of personality and depicting the issues arising in the interplay between the characters, enables the writer to generate a clear message. With more rounded characters, such as those typically found in [[Shakespeare]]'s [[Play (theatre)|plays]], the moral may be more nuanced but no less present, and the writer may point it out in other ways (see, for example, the [[Prologue]] to ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'').

==Arts==
Throughout the history of recorded literature, the majority of fictional writing has served not only to entertain but also to instruct, inform or improve their audiences or readership. In [[Ancient Greek theatre|classical drama]], for example, the role of the [[Greek chorus|chorus]] was to comment on the proceedings and draw out a message for the audience to take away with them; while the [[Charles_Dickens#Novels|novels of Charles Dickens]] are a vehicle for morals regarding the social and economic system of [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] Britain.

Morals have typically been more obvious in [[children's literature]], sometimes even being introduced with the phrase: "The moral of the story is …". Such explicit techniques have grown increasingly out of fashion in modern storytelling, and are now usually only included for [[irony|ironic]] purposes.

Some examples are: "Better to be safe than sorry" ([[precautionary principle]]), "The evil deserves no aid", "Be friends with whom you don't like", "Don't judge people by the way they look", "Slow and steady wins the race", "Once started down the dark path, forever will it hold your destiny", and "Your overconfidence is your weakness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aesop's Fables: Online Collection - Selected Fables|url=http://www.aesopfables.com/aesopsel.html|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Aesop's Fables]] are the most famous of stories with strong moral conclusions.

== In moral tales ==
Morals were one of the main purposes of literature during 1780–1830, especially in [[children's literature]]. Part of the reason for this was the writings of [[John Locke]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] in the 18th century, which brought attention to children as an audience for literature. Following in their line of thought, [[Thomas Day]] (1748–1789) wrote ''[[Sandford and Merton]]'', elevating the outstanding morals of one young boy above the rapscallion nature of another. [[Maria Edgeworth]] (1776–1849) was another prominent author of moral tales, writing about how a wise adult can educate a child; one of her more famous stories is "[[The Purple Jar]]". During this time, the theme of "a young heroine or hero gaining wisdom and maturity was taken up by many other writers" (p.&amp;nbsp;93).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Children's Literature|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0195146565|pages=93–96|author=Dennis Butts|authorlink=Moral Tales|editor=Jack Zipes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability of children to derive moral lessons from stories and visual media develops around the age of 9 or 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/01/08/375878511/and-the-moral-of-the-story-is-kids-dont-always-understand-the-moral|title=And The Moral Of The Story Is ...

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15548">'''The New Rochelle Art Association''' ('''NRAA''') was founded in 1912 by artists and residents of the city of [[New Rochelle, New York|New Rochelle]] in [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/pages/New-Rochelle-Art-Association/106863242721169?sk=info&amp;tab=page_info NRAA Facebook Bio]&lt;/ref&gt; By 1912 the community had transformed into a true [[New Rochelle artist colony|”artists colony”]], home to many notable artists of the time including  [[Frederic Remington]],  AIta West Salisbury, [[Edward Kemble]],  Rufus Fairchild Zogbaurn, [[Orson Lowell]], F. Wellingon Ruckstuhl, Ernest Albert, Homer Emons, [[Frederick Dana Marsh]], [[Remington Schuyler]], Lucius Wolcott Hitchcock, [[George T. Tobin]],  Leon Shafer,  Charles Ayer, Herman Lambden  and Armand Both.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newrochellearts.org/content.php?nID=2&amp;cID=4 New Rochelle - Arts City]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding==
For years there had been informal meetings in the studios of various artists, often with guests invited out from New York City. In 1912, however, Alta Salisbury West proposed that a more formal group be formed – the New Rochelle Art Association. The original group of artists included Charles F. Ayer, Frederick Dana Marsh, Remington Schuyler, Herman Lambden, George T. Tobin, Armand Booth, Leon Schafer, Lucius Hitchcock and Orson Lowell. Mrs. West became the first president. The Art Association produced its first public exhibition in 1914 as part of the celebrations surrounding the opening of the new Carnegie Public Library on Main Street which included both a large and small public exhibition room.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nraaonline.org/ NRAA website]&lt;/ref&gt; This exhibition, organized under the auspices of the Art Section of the Woman's Club of New Rochelle, was the first exhibition of the New Rochelle Art Association. There were 140 juried entries of paintings and sculpture, including a painting by Frederic Remington and an outstanding bronze bust of Augustus Thomas by Robert Aitken.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/new-rochelle-art-association-records-8088 Smithsonian Archives of American Art: New Rochelle Art Association records, 1914–1967]&lt;/ref&gt;

That exhibition was just the first of many at the library. The members of the Art Association continued to use the library to show their work. There were both group shows, generally featuring a particular media, and ones featuring various individual artists. Shows in the first few years included one devoted to the work of Frederick Dana Marsh and one to Milton Mayer, and a group show of the Association of Women Painters and Sculptors of New York City.

==Organization==
On January 4, 1920, a notice appeared on the bottom of New Rochelle's Evening Standard advertising the annual meeting of all members of the NRAA at the home of Orson Lowell. This was the meeting where the Art Association was formally organized and its aims set forth. Its stated plan was to cooperate with the Community Service which was promoting education, literacy and civic betterment programs in New Rochelle. By holding regular exhibitions of the highest quality, the Association planned to set an educational standard in the Fine Arts, and in other ways to promote public interest in art in the community. There were three classes of membership: active, associate, and patron. The Association was divided into four sections, each with a chairman and secretary, who had representation on the central board composed of the officers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/new-rochelle-art-association-records-8088 Smithsonian Archives of American Art: New Rochelle Art Association records, 1914–1967]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Board===
* President: Frederick Dana Marsh 
* Vice President: Orson Lowell 
* Second Vice President: Julius Prince
* Secretary: Elizabeth Ayer
* Treasurer: E. Irvins Hanson

===Sections of the NRAA===
* Painter's and Sculptors  -  Chairman: Alta West Salisbury;  Secretary: John W. Fenton
* Architects and Interior Decorators  - Chairman: Laulnce L. Barnard; Secretary: Paul M. ReillY
* Illustrators and Cartoonists  -  Chairman: Remington Schuyler; Secretary: George E. Giguere
* Arts and Crafts  -  Chairman: Miss Mary G. Griggs; Secretary: none chosen

There were no known written by-laws of the Association until 1929, when, under the laws of the State of New York, the New Rochelle Art Association was required to develop its own constitution and by-laws for a membership corporation. In the early l930's the Constitution and By-Laws were updated to again meet State requirements, this time for a non-profit membership corporation.

==Exhibitions==
In 1920, after the Association had been organized into its four main Sections, the 'Fine Arts Room' of the Library was acquired for the groups use. The first exhibition was put on by the 'Illustrators Section' and 57 paintings in every medium were displayed.  The following year the exhibit included the [[Knickerbocker Building (New Rochelle, New York)|Knickerbocker Press]] and [[Knickerbocker Building (New Rochelle, New York)|The Little Print Press]], both of New Rochelle, and showed the various processes used to make books. The 'Painters Section' soon followed with their own exhibit, followed by the 'Cartoonists'. Next there was the "Little Picture Show" and the "Sketch Exhibit" which both became annual events.

Finally the 'Architects Section' mounted their exhibition. It wasn't until this show that brought together the work of a number of city architects that the community finally realized how many talented artists and masters of their profession actually resided in New Rochelle. Three medals were awarded at the exhibit including; Best Designed Residence - Phillip J. Rocker; Best Designed Commercial Building - Laurence M. Loeb; and the Best Rendering - George Licht.

The variety of shows was amazing. Kenneth Clark exhibited a number of his photographs and Henry Bultitude exhibited his miniature rooms creations. The graphic arts fueled continued interest, and drawings, illustrations, posters, wood and linoleum cuts, etchings, monotypes' and lithographic prints were shown.

During the 1920s the New Rochelle Art Association continued to exhibit regularly. There were so many members that each show tended to be devoted to subsets of the membership. There were shows for illustrations, for painting and sculpture, for drawings and graphic arts, architecture and one devoted to arts and crafts. In between the group shows, smaller shows were held featuring a particular artist, or a particular medium. Many shows also featured a lecture related to the theme of the show. The organization often operated as a museum for the city. A show in November 1921, for example, featured paintings and sculptures loaned by local patrons.  It was considered significant enough that ''[[The New York Times]]'' covered the show saying, “About $50,000 has emerged from the private collections of the locality”. The show included four examples of work by [[Winslow Homer]].
  
In 1925 the Association organized a poster exhibition which included posters that had been part of a lawsuit in England. These were a series of posters  featuring scenes from the British colonies done by  Captain Spenser Pryse for the British Empire Exhibition,  but had been rejected because some of the  subjects were too scantily clad.

In 1925, the Association lost one of their notable illustrators - Edward Penfield. A Memorial Exhibition was held in his honor. He was considered the “originator of the poster in America” and for six years designed all the posters for ''Harper’s Magazine''.  Many examples of his work were displayed.

While, for the most part, the work that appeared in the shows seems to have been somewhat conservative in style, the members of the association were aware of current movements. They went out of their way to look for examples of work from overseas, and shows might include work by artists from London or Munich or Scandinavia. A 1926 show included work by Reginald Marsh. In 1927 they even hosted a show billed as a “Modern Show”. The following year they had a special section of the display area where they put “the more modern trend of paintings.” A 1928 show garnered a full page spread in the local paper with photos of many of the artists and their art. This show was also covered in ''The New York Times'' and was so popular that special trains ran out from New York City so that students could attend the show. Exhibitors included some of the stars of the illustration world including Ernest Watson, Federick R. Gruger, Franklin Booth and Percy Crosby, as well as Frederick Dana Marsh, Courtney Allen, George T. Tobin,  Donald Teague, Leslie Zauner, J. C. Leyendecker,  Dean Cornwall, Water B. Humphrey, Orson Lowell,  Norman Rockwell, Revere Wistehuff, George  Brehm, Charles Williams, Robert W. Stewart, C. J.  Munro and Harold Anderson.

In the early 1950s, the First National Bank of New Rochelle opened its doors to the NRAA to exhibit paintings and sculpture.  Fifteen years later the same bank, but under the name of the First Westchester National Bank, allowed the Association to use its facilities for a juried Sculpture and Ceramics Forms Exhibition. This type of show was the first of its kind.
 
In 1963, all the first-place winners from a year's worth of shows displayed their work together at the Ruth White gallery on 57th Street in New York City to generally favorable reviews.

The saddest exhibitions were the Memorial Tributes which were mounted shortly after a member's death. These were started in 1924 upon the passing of Frank X. Leyendecker. His Memorial exhibition drew large crowds from the fields of art, opera, publishing and stage. Six more memorials were held, from 1924 to 1934, for Clare Briggs, Edward Penfield, Coles Phillips, C.J. Munro, and Kenneth Clark.

==Approach signs==
In 1921, the New Rochelle Art Association conceived the idea of creating more interesting signs for the major approach roads to New Rochelle. In April of that year a model of one of the signs was displayed at the New Rochelle Trust company and in 1922 the City Council approved their construction.  James Marsh, a member of the Art Association and a metal craftsman, wrought the signs by hand his studio from the designs and were given as a gift to the City from the NRAA. Ten of the twelve signs were completed in 1923 and were mounted on the cement stanchions at the main approach roads into the City. Each of the signs had a cutout design on the top and, hanging below on brackets, a separate sign made of iron that carried out the artist's motif with an inscription.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newrochellearts.org/content.php?nID=2&amp;cID=4 Signs of the Past]&lt;/ref&gt;

The signs include: "Stage Coach Days" - Edward Penfield; "Landing of the Huguenots" - George T. Tobin; "When A Feller Needs A Friend" - Clare Briggs; "Indians Returning From The Deer Hunt" - Remington Schuyler; "  of La Rochelle" - James Marsh, son of Frederick Dana Marsh designed "The Huguenot Ship"; "The City Of Homes" - Ralph T. Robertson; "Passing Of The British" - by Coles Phillips; "Rich In History" -  Norman Rockwell; and "City Of Homes, Churches, and Schools" - Laurence M. Loeb. The lettering on this last sign was changed later to read "City Of Homes, Houses of Worship and Schools". Walter Beach Humphrey and Lucius Hitchcock were other designers that contributed to this project. The signs caused a major sensation and were given national press coverage, and were copied in other communities across the country.

==Art schools==
According to Lucius Hitchcock, President of the NRAA in 1924, New Rochelle was not only the most affluent city in New York State, but had more artists per capita than almost any city in the U.S. To capitalize on both of these, the Art Association felt the time had come to sponsor an art school here, and would direct its policies and hire its teachers. At the beginning, the proposed New Rochelle Art School would afford opportunities for study to young men and women, although children and classes might also be established, including evening classes. The school was also give what would amount to collegiate work in architecture.  The NRAA artists would receive no pay for their work and would do everything in connection with the school except assume financial responsibility. Their hope was to have the City fund this endeavor and they felt the best way to do this was through the Board of Education. According to a letter to the Board of Education, the plan was to charge tuition at New York Art School rates, of about $30 per week, to the students and, in return for the financial support given by the Board of Education, the school would offer free scholarships to public school pupils. The Association reserved the right to terminate the scholarship without recourse if the student failed in effort or disclosed what was judged to be a lack of appreciation of his opportunities. After much deliberation, the Board of Education turned them down. They reasoned that using taxpayer's money to maintain a school for the benefit of a few talented pupils was too narrow a focus.

Twenty four years later a group of four NRAA artists established an art school. This time a private school named “The Huguenot School of Art” opened its doors at 352 North Avenue.  It was an evening school so as to accommodate those individuals with a major interest in art who had to hold down full-time jobs. Its founders made up the faculty, with each having his area of expertise. The purpose of the school was to provide a carefully selected course of studies to develop sound training in drawing, painting, and creative composition as the foundation for an active career in the field of art. The curriculum consisted of basic, intermediate and advanced courses with Saturday classes for children. These were too progressively arranged so that the student would have the opportunity to explore the possibilities of many graphic media, and to present every constructive trend in the conservative and modern schools of art expression. For four years this school was an important element in the art world of the region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/new-rochelle-art-association-records-8088 Smithsonian Archives of American Art: New Rochelle Art Association records, 1914–1967]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Patrologia Orientalis''''' is an attempt to create a comprehensive collection of the writings by eastern [[Church Fathers]] in [[Syriac language|Syriac]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Coptic language|Coptic]], [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]], and [[Slavonic language|Slavonic]]. It is designed to complement the comprehensive, influential, and monumental [[Patrologia Latina|Latin]] and [[Patrologia Graeca|Greek patrologies]] published in the 19th century. It began in 1897 as the ''[[Patrologia]] Syriaca'',  was discontinued in its original form and replaced by the ''[[Patrologia]] Orientalis''. The collection began with those [[liturgical]] texts that touch on [[hagiography]]. Since then critical editions of the [[Bible]], theological works, [[homilies]] and letters have been published.

The edition is ongoing. Editors were René Graffin, (d. 1941); François Nau (d. 1931); [[Prince Maximilian of Saxony (1870–1951)|Max]], [[Prince]] of [[Saxony]] (d. 1951) and from 1951 François Graffin. Volume 1 was published in 1904, and 1984 saw the publication of volume 41.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18964">'''Playing For Change''' is a [[multimedia]] music project, co-founded in 2002 by American music engineer/producer Mark Johnson and film producer/philanthropist [[Whitney Ann Kroenke|Whitney Kroenke]], that seeks to inspire, connect, and bring peace to the world through music. Playing For Change also created a separate [[non-profit organization]] called the Playing For Change Foundation, which builds music and art schools for children around the world.

== Origin ==
Playing For Change was born in 2002 as a shared vision between co-founders, Mark Johnson and [[Whitney Kroenke Burditt|Whitney Kroenke]], to hit the streets of America with a mobile recording studio and cameras in search of inspiration and the heartbeat of the people. Producers Johnson and Enzo Buono traveled around the world to places including [[New Orleans]], [[Barcelona]], [[South Africa]], [[India]], [[Nepal]], the [[Middle East]] and [[Ireland]]. Using mobile recording equipment, the duo recorded local musicians performing the same song, interpreted in their own style. Among the artists participating or openly involved in the project are [[Vusi Mahlasela]], [[Louis Mhlanga]], [[Clarence Bekker]], [[David Guido Pietroni]], Tal Ben Ari (Tula), [[Bono]], [[Keb' Mo']], [[David Broza]], [[Manu Chao]], [[Grandpa Elliott]], [[Keith Richards]], Toots Hibbert from [[Toots &amp; the Maytals]], [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]] and [[Stephen Marley (musician)|Stephen Marley]]. This resulted in the award-winning documentary ''A Cinematic Discovery of Street Musicians''.

In 2005, Mark Johnson was walking in [[Santa Monica, California]], when he heard the voice of Roger Ridley (now deceased) singing "Stand By Me." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rogerridleybluesman.com/|title=Roger Ridley - Roger Ridley/street performer - HOME|work=rogerridleybluesman.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roger had so much soul and conviction in his voice, and Mark approached him about performing "Stand By Me" as a Song Around The World. Roger agreed, and when Mark returned with recording equipment and cameras he asked Roger, "With a voice like yours, why are you singing on the streets?" Roger replied, "Man I’m in the Joy business, I come out to be with the people." Ever since that day, the Playing For Change crew has traveled the world recording and filming musicians, creating Songs Around The World, and building a global family.

Creating Songs Around The World inspired the PFC crew to unite many of the greatest musicians they met throughout their journey through the creation of the Playing For Change Band. These musicians come from many different countries and cultures, but through music they speak the same language. The PFC Band is now touring the world and spreading the message of love and hope to audiences everywhere.

The founders of Playing For Change created the Playing For Change Foundation, a separate 501(c)3 nonprofit organization dedicated to building music and art schools for children around the world, and creating hope and inspiration for the future of our planet.

== PFC Online Global Community ==
PFC videos have exceeded an estimated 500 million online views, continuing to grow steadily through active &amp; dedicated community members from 195 countries.

'''''Shah Jo Risalo''''' ({{lang-sd|&lt;big&gt;'''شاھ جو رسالو'''&lt;/big&gt;}}) is a poetic compendium of famous [[Sindhi people|Sindhi]] Sufi poet [[Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai]]. In fact, it is many compendia, for Shah Abdul Latif's poetry in various forms of [[Beit|bayt]] and wai was compiled by many of his devotees during his lifetime and after his death. The devotees compiled his poetry and designated it as '''Shah Jo Risalo''' or '''Poetry of Shah'''.

[[Ernest Trumpp]] called it [[Diwan (poetry)|Diwan]] when he edited the ''Risalo'' and published it from [[Leipzig]], [[Germany]] in 1866 A.D. Afterwards, many scholars and linguists have published the Shah Jo Risalo with their own compilations, hence many editions are available.

Shah Jo Risalo, written in very pure and concise [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] verses, is great storehouse for Muslims but also for the Hindus. Shah Abdul Latif has hidden his mystical ideas under layers of symbols taken from all spheres of life as well as from the classical Sufi tradition, and particularly from Maulana [[Rumi]]'s [[Mathnawi]].&lt;ref&gt;Annemarie Schimmel, ''Pearls from the Indus:Studies in Sindhi Culture'' Jamshoro, Sindh, Pakistan: Sindhi Adabi Board (1986). See pp. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Surs (chapters) ==
The traditional compilations of Shah Jo Risalo include 30 Surs (chapters) which were compiled by renowned researchers. The oldest publications of Shah Jo Risalo contained some 36 Surs, but later most of the linguists discarded 6 Surs, as their language and content did not match the Shah's style. Recently, Dr. Nabi Bakhsh Baloch, a renowned linguist of the [[Sindhi language]], has compiled and printed a new edition after 32 years of research into folk culture, language and the history of Sindhi language. Another poet Dr Aurangzeb Siyal has recently launched a book named "Louk Zangeer" in which he has attempted to define three Surs i-e Momal Rano, Sasui Punho and Umar Marvi in an easy manner and in different poetic style.

The word "[[Svara|Sur]]", from [[Sanskrit]] word [[Svara]], means a mode of singing. The Surs are sung as [[Raga]]s In [[Indian classical music]], its "Ragas" and "Raginis" are sung at different times of day and night. In Risalo the Surs are named according to their subject matter. The underlying theme is how the individual is to cultivate the godly attributes, negate his ego so as to evolve to a better human being.

The traditional 30 Surs included in Shah Jo Risalo are:

These Surs contain [[Beit|Bayts]] which Shah latif sang in state of ecstasy. These Bayts in the Surs concerning the life-stories of his heroines, viz. Suhni, Sassui, Lila, Mumal, Marui, Nuri and Sorath, are not in chronological sequences, for the Sufi Poet in his state of "Wajd" or ecstasy, was concerned with the moments of denouncements in life-stories, which he used as allegories to express his mystical experiences.

== Shah's Heroines ==
{{Main|The Seven Queens of Sindh}}

The [[heroines]] of Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai's poetry are known as the Seven queens of [[Sindhi folklore]] who have been given the status of royalty in Shah Jo Risalo. The Seven Queens are celebrated throughout [[Sindh]] for their positive qualities: [[honesty]], [[integrity]], [[piety]] and [[loyalty]]. They are also valued for their [[bravery]] and their willingness to risk their lives in the name of [[love]]. The Seven Queens mentioned in Shah Jo Risalo are '''Marui, Momal, Sassui, Noori, Sohni, Sorath, and Lila'''. In his poetry Shah has alluded in elaborate way to these characters of Sindhi folktales and used them as metaphors for high spiritual life.

Perhaps what Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai saw in his tales of these [[women]] was an idealized view of [[womanhood]], but the truth remains that the Seven Queens inspired women all over Sindh to have the courage to choose love and freedom over tyranny and oppression. The lines from the Risalo describing their trials are sung at Sufi shrines all over Sindh, and especially at the ''[[urs]]'' of Shah Abdul Latif every year at Bhit Shah.

These romantic tales of Bhittai are commonly known as ''[[Momal Rano]]'', ''[[Umar Marvi|Umar Marui]]'', ''[[Sohni Mehar]]'', ''[[Lilan Chanesar]]'', ''[[Noori Jam Tamachi]]'', ''[[Sassui Punnhun]]'' and ''[[Raja Dhach]]'' or Seven Queens ({{lang|sd|&lt;big&gt;ست سورميون&lt;/big&gt;}}) of [[Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thesindhuworld.com/lila_chanesar.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721224737/http://www.thesindhuworld.com/lila_chanesar.html |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://balochistan.bestforum.ca/t16-sassui-punnun |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812045415/http://balochistan.bestforum.ca/t16-sassui-punnun |archivedate=2011-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://balochistan.bestforum.ca/t16-sassui-punnun |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812045415/http://balochistan.bestforum.ca/t16-sassui-punnun |archivedate=2011-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Sassui Punnhun]]'' and ''Sohni Mehar'' aka [[Sohni Mahiwal]] in [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] are also celebrated in [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] along with ''[[Heer Ranjha]]'' and ''[[Mirza Sahiban]]'' and thus form part of Punjabi traditions.

These nine tragic romances from [[South Asia]] (all from present day [[Pakistan]]) have become part of the cultural identity of Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;http://punjabiworld.com/Creative-Punjab/Legends-of-Punjab/love-legends-of-punjab.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Translations ==
Shah Jo Risalo was first translated into [[German language|German]] in 1866 by Ernest Trump, a German scholar and missionary when in 1860s he became fascinated by [[Sindhi language]] and culture and the [[jogi]]s and singers who sang Shah Latif’s verses. With the help of Sindhi scholars he compiled a selection of the original verses and called it "Shah Jo Risalo" (the message of Shah). It was first translated in English by [[Elsa Kazi]], a German lady married to [[Allama I. I. Kazi]], who translated selections of Shah Jo Risalo in English prose. Later in 1940, Dr H.T Sorley, an English scholar learnt Sindhi, and published selections from the Risalo by the Oxford University Press entitled "Shah Abdul latif of Bhit - His Poetry, Life and Times".

The most recent work (1994) of translation of Risalo into English is that of Amena Khamisani, a professor in English Literature at the [[University of Sindh|Sindh University]]. [[Shaikh Ayaz]], the famous Sindhi poet, translated Risalo into [[Urdu]]. Risalo is also translated in [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] and more recently [[French language|French]] translation was also undertaken by Cultural department of Sindh. Part of Risalo is also translated in Arabic.
There is one more translation of Shah Abdul Latif by name "Seeking The Beloved" translated by Hari Daryani 'Dilgir' a noted Sindhi poet and Anju Makhija. This book was honoured with Sahitya Akademi Award for translation in the year 2012.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16828">'''Sonic interaction design''' is the study and exploitation of [[sound]] as one of the principal channels conveying [[information]], meaning, and aesthetic/emotional qualities in interactive contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Davide Rocchesso, Stefania Serafin, Frauke Behrendt, Nicola Bernardini, Roberto Bresin, Gerhard Eckel, Karmen Franinović, Thomas Hermann, Sandra Pauletto, Patrick Susini, and Yon Visell, (2008). ''Sonic interaction design: sound, information and experience''. In: CHI '08 Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems (Florence, Italy, April 05 – 10, 2008). CHI '08. ACM, New York, NY, 3969–3972. {{doi|10.1145/1358628.1358969}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davide Rocchesso and Stefania Serafin, (2009). "Sonic Interaction Design". Editorial of Special Issue. ''International Journal of Human–Computer Studies'' 67(11) (Nov. 2009):&amp;nbsp;905–906. {{doi|10.1016/j.ijhcs.2009.09.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sonic interaction design is at the intersection of [[interaction design]] and [[sound and music computing]]. If [[interaction design]] is about designing objects people interact with, and such interactions are facilitated by computational means, in sonic interaction design, sound is mediating interaction either as a display of processes or as an input medium.

== Research areas ==

=== Perceptual, cognitive, and emotional study of sonic interactions ===
[[Research]] in this area focuses on experimental scientific findings about human sound reception in [[Interactivity|interactive]] contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Guillaume Lemaitre, Olivier Houix, Yon Visell, Karmen Franinović, Nicolas Misdariis, and Patrick Susini, (2009). "Toward the design and evaluation of continuous sound in tangible interfaces: The Spinotron". ''International Journal of Human–Computer Studies'' 67(11) (Nov. 2009):&amp;nbsp;976–993. {{doi|10.1016/j.ijhcs.2009.07.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During closed-loop interactions, the users manipulate an interface that produces sound, and the sonic feedback affects in turn the users’ manipulation. In other words, there is a  tight coupling between auditory [[perception]] and action.&lt;ref&gt;Salvatore M. Aglioti and Mariella Pazzaglia (2010). "Representing actions through their sound". "Experimental Brain Research" 206(2):&amp;nbsp;141–151. {{doi|10.1007/s00221-010-2344-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Listening to sounds might not only activate a representation of how the  sound was made: it might also prepare the listener to react to the sound.&lt;ref&gt;Marzia De Lucia, Christian Camen, Stephanie Clarke, and Micah M. Murray (2009). "The role of actions in auditory ob ject discrimination". "Neuroimage" 48(2):&amp;nbsp;475–485. {{doi|10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.06.041}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cognitive [[Representation (psychology)|representations]] of sounds might be associated with action-planning  schemas, and sounds can also unconsciously cue a further reaction on the part  of the listener. 

Sonic interactions have the potential to influence the users’ [[emotion]]s: the quality of the sounds affects the pleasantness  of the interaction, and the difficulty of the manipulation influences whether the user feels in control or not.&lt;ref&gt;Guillaume Lemaitre, Olivier Houix, Karmen Franinović, Yon Visell, and Patrick Susini (2009). "The Flops glass: a device to study the emotional reactions arising from sonic interactions". In Proc. Sound and Music Computing Conference, Porto,  Portugal.  Available: [http://smc2009.smcnetwork.org/programme/pdfs/281.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Product sound design ===
Product design in the context of sonic interaction design is dealing with methods and experiences for designing interactive products having a salient sonic behaviour. Products, in this context, are either tangible and functional objects that are designed to be manipulated,&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Hug (2008). ''Genie in a Bottle: Object–Sound Reconfigurations for Interactive Commodities''. In: Proceedings of Audiomostly 2008, 3rd Conference on Interaction With Sound (2008). Available: [http://www.citeulike.org/group/10826/article/7009573 online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karmen Franinović, Daniel Hug and Yon Visell (June 2007). ''Sound Embodied: Explorations of Sonic Interaction Design for Everyday Objects in a Workshop Setting''.  In: Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Auditory Display, Montréal, Canada, June 26 – 29, 2007,  pp. 334–341. Available:  [http://www.icad.org/Proceedings/2007/FraninovicHug2007.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt; or usable simulations of such objects as in [[virtual prototyping]]. Research and development in this area relies on studies from other disciplines, such as:
* product [[sound quality]];&lt;ref&gt;Richard H. Lyon, (2003). "Product sound quality-from perception to design". ''Sound and Vibration'' 37(3):&amp;nbsp;18–22. Available: [http://www.sandv.com/downloads/0303lyon.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Video game|Computer and video game]] sound;&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.gamesound.org/ About gamesound.org]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[sound culture]], ''i.e.'' the study of how the production and consumption of sound have changed throughout history and within different societies.

In [[design research]] for sonic products a set of practices have been inherited from a variety of fields. Such practices have been tested in contexts where research and pedagogy naturally intermix. Among these practices it suffices to mention:

=== Interactive art and music ===

In the context of sonic interaction design, interactive art and music projects are designing and researching aesthetic experiences where sonic interaction is in the focus. The creative and expressive aspects – the aesthetics – are more important than conveying information through sound. Practices include installations, performances, public art and interactions between humans through digitally-augmented objects/environments. These often integrate elements such as embedded technology, gesture-sensitive devices, speakers or context-aware systems. 

The experience is in the focus, addressing how humans are affected by the sound, and vice versa. Interactive art and music allows us to question existing paradigms and models of how we interact with technology and sound, going beyond paradigms of control (human controlling a machine). Users are part of a loop which includes action and perception. 

Interactive art and music projects invite explorative actions and playful engagement. There is also a multi-sensory aspect, especially haptic-audio&lt;ref&gt;The fifth International Workshop on Haptic and Audio Interaction Design (HAID) on September 16–17, 2010 in Copenhagen, Denmark. http://media.aau.dk/haid10/?page_id=46&lt;/ref&gt; and audio-visual projects are popular. Amongst many other influences, this field is informed by the development of the roles of instrument-maker, composer and performer merging.&lt;ref&gt;International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression http://www.nime.org/&lt;/ref&gt; 

Artistic research in sonic interaction design is about productions in the [[interactive art]]s and [[performing arts]], exploiting the role of [[enactive]] engagement with sound–augmented interactive objects.&lt;ref&gt;John Thompson, [[JoAnn Kuchera-Morin]], Marcos Novak, Dan Overholt, Lance Putnam, Graham Wakefield, and Wesley Smith, (2009). "The Allobrain: An interactive, stereographic, 3D audio, immersive virtual world". ''International Journal of Human-Computer Studies'' 67(11) (Nov. 2009):&amp;nbsp;934–946. {{doi|10.1016/j.ijhcs.2009.05.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sonification ===

[[Sonification]] is the data-dependent generation of sound, if the transformation is systematic, objective and reproducible, so that it can be used as scientific method.&lt;ref&gt;Sonification – A Definition http://sonification.de/son/definition&lt;/ref&gt;

For sonic interaction design, sonification provides a set of methods to create interaction sounds that encode relevant data, so that the user can perceive or interpret the  conveyed information.   Sonification does not necessarily need to represent huge amounts of data in sound, but may only convey one or few data values in a sound. To give an example, imagine a light switch that, on activation would create a short sound that depends on the electric power consumed through the cable: more energy-wasting lamps would perhaps systematically result in more annoying switch sounds. This example shows that sonification aims to provide some information by using its systematic transformation into sound. 

The integration of data-driven elements in interaction sound may serve different purposes: 
*  to allow the users to refine their actions via auditory feedback. Example: the sonification-enhanced drilling machine&lt;ref&gt;Tobias Grosshauser and Thomas Hermann, (2010). "Multimodal closed-loop Human Machine Interaction" Proc. Interactive Sonification Workshop, Stockholm, http://interactive-sonification.org/ISon2010/proceedings&lt;/ref&gt; which indicates by sound when a wanted orientation to the wall is reached.
* to create a sonic [[:wikt:gestalt|gestalt]] for the interaction which allows users to compare the detailed performance on repeated interactions: for instance rowing strokes may be sonified so that the sportsmen can better synchronize their action.
* to enable novel functions that would otherwise be not available (e.g. a bottle that displays by sound how much fluid is poured into glasses so that the users can more easily fill the equal amount of liquid in different glasses).

Within the field of sonification, sonic interaction design acknowledges the importance of human [[interaction]] for understanding and using auditory [[feedback]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hermann, and Andy Hunt, (2005). "Guest Editors' Introduction: An Introduction to Interactive Sonification". ''IEEE MultiMedia'' 12(2):&amp;nbsp;20-24. {{doi|10.1109/MMUL.2005.26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within sonic interaction design, sonification can help and offer solutions, methods, and techniques to inspire and guide the design of  products or interactive systems.

{{refimprove||date=November 2013}}

A '''story generator''' or '''plot generator''' is a tool that generates basic [[narratives]] or [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] ideas. The generator could be in the form of a computer program, a chart with multiple columns, a book composed of panels that flip independently of one another, or a set of several adjacent reels that spin independently of one another, allowing a user to select elements of a [[narrative]] plot. The tool may allow the user to select elements for the narrative, or it may combine them randomly, a specific variation known as a '''random plot generator'''. Such tools can be created for virtually any [[genre]], although they tend to produce formulaic and hackneyed situations.

== History ==
Plot generators were described as early as the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Derek |last=Rowntree |title=Do You Really Need a Home Computer? |publisher=Scribner |year=1985 |isbn=0-684-18182-7 |page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article originally published in 1935 and reprinted in 2002, [[Robert J. Hogan (author)|Robert J. Hogan]] described a book-based device called the ''Plot Genie'' which consisted of three lists of 180 items each: murder victims in the first list, crime locations in the second list, and important clues in the third list. The item to use from each list was chosen by spinning a dial with 180 numbers on it. Hogan also mentions other similar devices called ''The 36 Dramatic Situations'' and ''Plotto: The Master Book of All Plots''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Inside an Author's Brain: The Birth of a Book Length Mystery Novelette |first=Robert J.|last=Hogan |journal=[[Writer's Digest]] |date=October 1935}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Pulp Masters |first=James |last=van Hise |year=2002| pages=120–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Plotto'' by William Wallace Cook is a non-random plot generator. The reader makes all the decisions within the framework set out by the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/plottonewmethodo00cook|title=Plotto|last=Cook|first=William Wallace|date=1928|publisher=Ellis Publishing Company|year=|isbn=|location=Battle Creek, MI|page=314}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eger, Markus, Colin M.

Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest computerized story generator was TALE-SPIN, an [[artificial intelligence]] program developed in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Selmer |last1=Bringsjord |first2=David A. |last2=Ferrucci |title=Artificial Intelligence and Literary Creativity: Inside the Mind of BRUTUS, a Storytelling Machine |location=Mahwah, New Jersey |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |year=2000 |isbn=0-8058-1986-X |pages=122, 150}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=TALE-SPIN |first=James |last=Meehan |editor1-first=Roger C. |editor1-last=Schank |editor2-first=Christopher K. |editor2-last=Riesbeck |title=Inside Computer Understanding: Five Programs Plus Miniatures |location=New Haven, Connecticut |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |year=1981 |isbn=0-89859-071-X |page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently in the 1990s, the computer program MEXICA was developed for academic research into automated plot generation. It produces plots related to the [[Mexica]] people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Rafael |last=Pérez y Pérez |title=Computational Creativity Research: Towards Creative Machines |chapter=From MEXICA to MEXICA-Impro: The Evolution of a Computer Model for Plot Generation |editor1-first=Tarek Richard |editor1-last=Besold |editor2-first=Marco |editor2-last=Schorlemmer |editor3-first=Alan |editor3-last=Smaill |publisher=Atlantis Press |year=2015 |isbn=978-94-6239-084-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using an approach similar to that of MEXICA, the program ProtoPropp generates stories related to [[Russian folklore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://tomcat-stable.hcmc.uvic.ca:8080/ach/site/xhtml.xq?id=105 |title=Story Generators: Models and Approaches for the Generation of Literary Artefacts |first1=Birte |last1=Lönneker |first2=Jan Christoph |last2=Meister |first3=Pablo |last3=Gervás |first4=Federico |last4=Peinado |first5=Michael |last5=Mateas |conference=Joint Conference of the Association for Computers and the Humanities/Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing |conference-url=http://tomcat-stable.hcmc.uvic.ca:8080/ach/site/index.htm |date=June 2005 |location=[[University of Victoria]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a large number of "random plot generators" available on the internet—generic and relating to specific [[fandom]]s, with a certain amount of academic research into the subject.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Plot generators have also been portrayed in fiction, as in [[Fritz Leiber]]'s ''The Silver Egghead''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

== Story Generator Algorithm ==
The term story generator algorithms (SGAs) refers to computational procedures resulting in an artifact that can be considered a story. In the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the automated generation of stories has been a subject of research for over fifty years. An algorithm is understood as a set of instructions that, when applied to a given input, produces an output. In the present context, the desired output is a story. The underlying concept of “story” in SGAs is functional and does not imply any aesthetic notion. This is important because it sets the context for evaluation of generated stories, for which having a surface realization as a readable and appealing text is not necessarily a core issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gervás|first1=Pablo|title=Story Generator Algorithms|url=http://wikis.sub.uni-hamburg.de/lhn/index.php/Story_Generator_Algorithms|website=The living book of narratology|accessdate=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Tahmurath-Lawrie-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|upright|[[Lee Lawrie]], ''Tahmurath'' (1939). Library of Congress [[John Adams Building]], Washington, D.C.]]
'''Tahmuras''' or '''Tahmures''' ({{lang-fa|تهمورث ,طهمورث}}, {{IPA-all|tʰæmures}}; from [[Avestan]] ''Taxma Urupi'') was the third [[Shah]] of the world according to [[Ferdowsi]]'s [[epic poetry|epic poem]], the ''[[Shahnameh]]''. He is considered the builder of [[Merv]].

==Tahmuras in the ''Shahnameh''==
Tahmures was the son of [[Hushang]].  In his time the world was much troubled by the [[Deev|''deev''s]] (demons) of [[Angra Mainyu|Ahriman]].  On the advice of his [[vizier]] [[Shahrasp]] ({{lang|fa|شهرسپ}}), Tahmuras used magic to subdue Ahriman and made him his slave, even riding upon his back as on a horse. The demons rebelled against Tahmuras, and he made war against them with both magic and force. By magic he bound two-thirds of the demons; the remaining third he crushed with his mace. The ''deevs'' now became Tahmuras's slaves and they taught him the art of writing in thirty different scripts.

Like his father, Tahmuras was a great inventor of arts for easing the human condition.  He invented the spinning and weaving of wool, learned to domesticate chickens, how to store up fodder for livestock instead of merely grazing them, and how to train animals like dogs and falcons to hunt for people.

Tahmuras ruled for thirty years and was succeeded by his son [[Jamshid]].

==Death of Taxmoruw, as told in a Parsi ''Rivayāt''==
[[Georges Dumézil]] provides a summary of a [[Ribaldry|bawdy]] and [[off-color humor|scatological]], but nonetheless instructive account of the death of Taxmoruw (Tahmuras) preserved in a [[Parsi]] ''[[rivayat|rivayāt]]'', translated by Danish orientalist and historian Arthur Christensen and published by [[Friedrich von Spiegel]].&lt;ref&gt;''Les types du premier homme et du premier roi dans l'histoire légendaire des Iraniens'' Part I (1917) by Christensen,Arthur pps. 184-189.&lt;/ref&gt;This (admittedly late) text furnishes material that Dumézil considers to preserve archaic [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European]] themes with a bearing on what he termed the problem of ''le borgne'' and ''le manchot'' i.e. of 'the one-eyed (god)' and 'the one-handed (god)' - relating, in this instance, specifically to the mythic motif of one-handedness.

The scene for this scurrilous episode is set by the account in the [[Avesta]] of the reign of Taxma Urupi, which relates that this sovereign of the world subdued not only demons and sorcerers, but also the archfiend Angra Mainyu himself, thanks to the help of the wind god [[Vayu-Vata|Vayu]] and his (Taxma Urupi's) possession of the [[khvarenah]] or mystic 'kingly glory'. Thus empowered, the valiant king is able to ride Angra Mainyu, like a horse, 'from one end of the earth to the other', every day for thirty years. (At this point the Avesta falls silent and the Parsi ''rivayât'' takes up the story). Ahriman (Angra Mainyu), exasperated by his undignified bondage as a beast of burden, manages finally to win (by means of a gift of jewellery) the confidence of Taxmoruw's wife, from whom he learns that there is a certain point on the daily ride - a particularly treacherous part of a mountain track - at which Taxmoruw experiences a moment of [[vertigo|vertiginous]] dread. The following day Ahriman bides his time until 'horse' and rider reach the critical point - at which he seizes his chance, rearing up, throwing Taxmoruw to the ground and swallowing the unfortunate king whole. Time passes, but Taxmoruw's corpse is not found, remaining in Ahriman's belly.

Meanwhile, [[Jamshid]], Taxmoruw's devoted brother (not son, as in the Shahnameh), scours the world in search of his body until eventually he learns from [[Sraosha|Srosh]], the well-nigh omniscient confidant of [[Ahura Mazda]], that it is hidden in Ahriman's bowels. Jamshid begs Srosh to tell him some magical trick to retrieve the body from its unsavoury resting place, whereupon Srosh reveals that Ahriman loves two things above all else : music and [[anal sex]]. Acting on Srôsh's advice, Jamshid then travels to the area where Ahriman is living and begins to sing. Attracted by the music, the demon duly appears and begins capering about and [[masturbation|masturbating]] in anticipation of his other favourite activity.

Jamshid agrees to penetrate Ahriman on condition that he first be allowed to remove Taxmoruw's body from the demon's bowels. The excited Ahriman agrees readily to the bargain and bends over, presenting his [[anus]], whereupon Jamshid plunges his hand up the demon's [[rectum]], deep into his belly, quickly pulls out his brother's corpse, places it on the ground and flees. Ahriman gives chase, but Jamshid runs on and on, taking care (as instructed previously by Srosh) not to look back at his pursuer and, more especially not to look him in the face. Ahriman tires and, baulked of both pleasure and prey, descends once more into hell.

Jamshid then returns to the spot where he left Taxmoruw's body, constructs the [[prototype|prototypical]] [[Tower of Silence]] and places the body on it for [[excarnation]] by birds of prey, in the manner still considered ritually correct by Zoroastrians to this day. Thankful that he has at last been able to give his brother a fitting funeral, Jamshid can finally take time to glance at the hand which has been up Ahriman's anus and sees, to his horror, that it is pale and stinking, starting to waste away with a foul disease similar to [[leprosy]]. The disease grows steadily worse, the hand withering and growing ever more painful, and Jamshid becomes sad at his deformity, shunning human society and haunting, hermit-like, the loneliest of mountains and deserts. All, however, ends happily, for one night, as the wretched man lies asleep, an [[ox]] [[urinates]] on his blighted hand, healing it. Thus comes about the discovery of ''gōmēz'' - cattle [[urine]], considered as the purificatory liquid ''par excellence'' in Zoroastrianism and used as such in the nine-night ritual of [[Barashnûm]], (as detailed in the 9th chapter of the [[Vendidad]]).

==Takhmurup and the Three Sacred Fires in the ''Bundahishn''==
According to verses 8-9 of the eighteenth chapter of the cosmological treatise known as the ''[[Bundahishn]]'', the three preeminent [[Atar]] (Great Fires) of ancient Iran - Farnbag, Gushnasp and Burzin Mihr - were brought thither on the back of the ox Srishok from a place named Khwaniratha, during the reign of the primordial ruler Takhmurup - presumably with his knowledge and possibly at his command. The text of the Bundahishn is not easy to interpret at this point, but seems to mean that a group of  men were riding beside the (Caspian?) sea on the back of the ox, transporting with them a fire altar, upon which were burning the three atar (holy fires). A storm then sprang up and the wind whipped the fire altar off Srishok's back and carried it out to sea. The three holy fires, however, were not quenched but miraculously remained burning on the waters, lighting the men (or passing seafarers?) to their (unspecified) destination.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.avesta.org/mp/grb12.htm#chap18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Persian Mythology'', by Hinnells, John R., volume in the series ''Library of the World's Myths and Legends'' pub. Newnes Books 1985&lt;/ref&gt;The unusual concept of fire burning in the midst of water is found also in relation to the ancient Indo-Iranian deity [[Apam Napat]] and both occurrences of the mythological motif may owe something to early observation of flames (derived from the welling up of natural hydrocarbons) hovering near the surface of  the [[Caspian Sea]] - more specifically the Southwestern part, exploited currently by the [[Absheron gas field]] near [[Baku]] in [[Azerbaijan]].

==Erection of Shiraz==
According to certain [[Culture of Iran|Iranian traditions]], the city of [[Shiraz]] was originally built by Tahmures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Conder|first=Josiah|title=Persia and China|publisher=Printed for J. Duncan|date=1827}}, p. 339&lt;/ref&gt; Some native writers have claimed that the name Shiraz is derived from that of Tahmuras's son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Conder|first=Josiah|title=Persia and China|publisher=Printed for J.

'''''The Entombment''''' is a 1559 painting by [[Titian]], commissioned by [[Philip II of Spain]]. In this painting, Tizian uses the mature style characterized by the use of broad brushwork and brilliant colours.  The figure holding Christ body is [[Nicodemus]], the Jewish elder that secretly visited Jesus at night to learn about his teachings. The figure of Nicodemus bears the traits of the artist himself. This could have been inspired by [[Michelangelo]]'s idea in his   unfinished Pietà from 1550,  depicting himself as Nicodemus, supporting the body of Christ displayed in the  Cathedral in [[Florence]].  The stone sarcophagus where Christ body is placed is decorated with depictions of [[Cain and Abel]] and the [[Sacrifice of Isaac]] - themes that according to the Christian faith predicted the [[sacrifice of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/t/tiziano/05_1550s/09entomb.html|title=

'''''The Mass at Bolsena''''' is a [[painting]] by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[renaissance]] artist [[Raphael]]. It was painted between 1512 and 1514 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museivaticani.va/content/museivaticani/en/collezioni/musei/stanze-di-raffaello/stanza-di-eliodoro/messa-di-bolsena.html The Mass at Bolsena] at vatican.va&lt;/ref&gt; as part of Raphael's commission to decorate with [[fresco]]es the rooms that are now known as the [[Raphael Rooms]], in the [[Apostolic Palace]] in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]. It is located in the ''Stanza di Eliodoro'', which is named after ''[[The Expulsion of Heliodorus from the Temple]]''.

''The Mass at Bolsena'' depicts an [[Eucharistic miracle]] that is said to have taken place in 1263 at the church of [[Basilica of Santa Cristina, Bolsena|Santa Cristina]] in Bolsena. A [[Bohemia]]n priest who doubted the doctrine of [[transubstantiation]], was celebrating mass at [[Bolsena]], when the bread of the [[eucharist]] began to bleed. The blood that spouted from the host and fell onto the tablecloth in the shape of a cross and he was reconverted. The following year, in 1264, [[Pope Urban IV]] instituted the [[Feast of Corpus Christi]] to celebrate this miraculous event.&lt;ref&gt;Vatican&lt;/ref&gt; The blood stained [[Corporal of Bolsena]] is still venerated as a major relic in the [[Orvieto Cathedral]].

Present in this painting is a self-portrait of the artist, Raphael, as one of the [[Swiss Guard]] in the lower right of the fresco, facing out with bound-up hair.  This is one of several instances in which Raphael has placed himself in his paintings.  Also shown in the work is [[Pope Julius II]] (1443&amp;ndash;1513), kneeling at the right, and his daughter [[Felice della Rovere]], shown on the left at the bottom of the steps, in profile, in dark clothes.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, ''Contemporary Review''. July 2005. "[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2242/is_1674_287/ai_n14924755 The Pope's Daughter]".&lt;/ref&gt; The four cardinals to the right have also been identified as Leonardo Grosso della Rovere, Raffaello Riario, Tommaso Riario and Agostino Spinola, relatives of Julius&lt;ref&gt;Vatican&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3143">'''The Nettle Spinner''' is a Flemish and French [[fairy tale]] collected by [[Charles Deulin]] in ''Contes du roi Cambrinus'' under the title ''La Fileuse d'orties''.  [[Andrew Lang]] included it in ''[[The Red Fairy Book]]''.

==Synopsis==

A great lord was so cruel to his peasants that they called him Burchard the Wolf.  His wife was kind and generous, and would secretly do good for those whom her husband wronged.  

One day Burchard saw a peasant woman named Renelde.  He told her if she came to the castle, he would make her the countess's lady-maid.  She refused because she had to look after her grandmother, and was betrothed to a huntsman named Guilbert.  He returned again, offering to make her a lady-in-waiting, and then to dismiss the countess and marry her.  The last offer would not have moved her even if she had wanted to be the countess, because the countess had helped her when her grandmother was ill.

Some time later, he saw her spinning flax, and asked what she was about.  She told him she was making her wedding shift, as she was to be married, if he gave his leave.  He told her that she must spin nettles instead, to make her shift and his shroud, because she would not marry until he was laid in his grave.  Guilbert offered to kill the count.  Renelde refused because it would be murder, and besides, the countess had been kind to her.  Her grandmother suggested that she try spinning the nettles. 

She found she could make good thread of them, and when Burchard came by again, she showed him her shift.  She began on the shroud, and Burchard felt ill that evening.  He sent soldiers to throw her into the river, but she struggled to shore and went on spinning.  When they tried to tie a stone to her neck, it untied itself, and she made to shore.  The Count had himself carried to the cottage—he was too ill to walk—and tried to shoot her, but the bullet rebounded harmlessly.  He broke the spinning wheel, but it was repaired the next day.  He had her tied and set guards, but the guards fell asleep and the bonds untied themselves.  He had every nettle uprooted, but they instantly sprouted again, even in her cottage.  Every day the Count grew worse, and the Countess found out why.  She asked Renelde to stop, and she did.  

The count recovered but still refused Renelde permission to marry Guilbert.  After a year, Guilbert left.  Another year went by, and Burchard fell ill again, though Renelde had not started spinning again.  He grew worse and worse and longed for death, but could not die.  Then he realized that his shroud was not ready.  He sent word to Renelde to prepare it.  His pains grew less as she spun, wove, and sewed.  When she took the last stitch he died.

Soon after this, Guilbert returned.  He still loved Renelde and married her.

[[File:Frans Hals - De officieren van de Sint-Adriaansdoelen.jpg|thumb|290px|''The Officers of the St Adrian Militia Company in 1633'']]
[[File:Wybrand Hendrik after Frans Hals - copy of 1633 schutterstuk for St.Adrian doelen.jpg|thumb|290px|This 18th-century copy by [[Wybrand Hendriks]] shows how much darker the painting has become over the centuries.]]
'''''The Officers of the St Adrian Militia Company in 1633''''' refers to the second [[schutterstuk]] painted by [[Frans Hals]] for the Cluveniers, St. Adrian, or St. Hadrian civic guard of [[Haarlem]], and today is considered one of the main attractions of the [[Frans Hals Museum]] there.

Unlike Hals' previous schutterstuk for this company, ''[[The Banquet of the Officers of the St Adrian Militia Company in 1627]]'' in which all officers are seated at a banquet wearing the colors of the Dutch flag - ''[[oranje-blanje-bleu]]'', in this version, the men are seated outside in the courtyard wearing sashes showing the colour of the officer's "rot", with the Ensign Jacob Hofland holding the flag of the blue rot, and Ensign Jacob Steyn holding the flag for the white rot. Because they are outside, they are holding their weapons. For the first time the sergeants are shown, holding [[halberd]]s to differentiate them from officers with [[spontoon]]s.

Officers were selected by the council of Haarlem to serve for three years, and this group had just finished their tenure and celebrated their end of service with a portrait. This was not the first time they were portrayed outside. After Hals painted them in 1627, [[Hendrick Gerritsz Pot]] painted them in [[The Officers of the St Adrian Militia Company in 1630|1630 on the steps just outside their hall]] where the other earlier paintings hung. In this version painted for the next three-year service period, the man with the orange sash seated on the left and looking directly at the viewer is Colonel [[Johan Claesz Loo]], heading the table.

The men featured are from left to right Ensign Jacob Hofland, Captain Cornelis Backer, Sergeant Dirck Verschuyl (standing in background with [[halberd]]), Colonel Johan Claesz Loo (sitting in foreground with right hand on commander's staff), Ensign Jacob Steyn (flag in left hand), Sergeant Balthasar Baudaert (standing in background), Captain Johan Schatter (standing with magnificent blue sash with bow), Sergeant Cornelis Jansz Ham (balding, sitting behind the table), Lieutenant Jacob Pietersz Buttinga (foreground), Sergeant Hendrik van den Boom (background), Captain [[Andries van Hoorn]] (standing with orange sash with bow, and behind his head in the distance two guards can be seen), Sergeant Barent Mol (standing behind the table), Lieutenant Nicolaes Olycan (standing and pointing his finger), Lieutenant [[Hendrick Gerritsz Pot]] (sitting with book).

==St. Adriansdoelen==

The painting previously hung with others in the old "Doelen" hall, which is today part of the [[Stadsbibliotheek Haarlem|Haarlem Public Library]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://monumentenregister.cultureelerfgoed.nl/php/main.php?cAction=search&amp;cOffset=1&amp;cLimit=25&amp;oOrder=ASC&amp;cSubmit=1&amp;sCompMonNr=19558 report] on [[Rijksmonument]] number 19558&lt;/ref&gt;  The paintings by Hals and others that formerly hung in this hall have been since transferred to the [[Frans Hals Museum]], though because they are so large, not all of these paintings are on display.

During the [[Batavian Revolution]] the schuttersgilde of St. Adrian was disbanded in favor of a new "Patriotic people's militia" called Pro Aris et Focis. The local artist [[Wybrand Hendriks]] commemorated the event with an engraving of the meeting, and this painting is shown hanging side by side with a later schutterstuk by [[Pieter Soutman]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4176">The '''Secret of the Way Things Are''' (also called the '''Sapiential Work Scroll''') is considered a [[Wisdom literature|wisdom scroll]] among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]. It is authored by a spiritual expert, directed towards a beginner. The author addresses how to deal with business and money issues in a godly manner, public affairs, leadership, marriage, children, and family, and how to live life righteously among secular society. The scrolls were found in [[Qumran]] caves one and four, and date approximately from the first century BCE and early first century CE.

==Description== 
Parts of six copies were discovered, indicating popularity and importance, especially to the supposed sect at Qumran. All of the Sapiential manuscripts are in [[Hebrew]], which is deemed the original language of the text (Harrington 2000: 825). The actual ancient title is unknown, but the frequent use of ''raz nihyeh'', translating to "the mystery of existence," "approaching mystery," or "the way things are" gave reason to title the work "The Secret of the Way Things are" (Davies, Brooke, and Callaway 2002: 140). A well-accepted theory is that the Sapiential Work was a pre-Qumranic text. In other words, it was not written for an isolated sect, but it ''was'' directed toward a specific audience (Elgvin 1996: 129). Many scholars assume the text to either have existed before the formation of the sect, or to have been a precursor to sect involvement (Harrington 2000: 826).

==Motifs==
Although the text itself is not considered [[apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic]], and does not reflect the developed philosophical dualism of the [[War Rule|War Scroll]] or the [[Community Rule]] (1Qs), the text does reflect [[Motif (narrative)|motif]]s of the [[end time]]s, judgment, and a predestined division of good and evil. The overall ideas and form of the text are comparable to [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]], Jesus' instructions and parables in the [[New Testament]] gospels, the [[book of James]], and especially the [[book of Daniel]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==Parallels==
Although there is no literal dependence between Daniel and the Sapiential Works, it is likely that they emerged from the same, or similar, scribal circles. Many phrases and ideas from Daniel pertaining to wisdom, revelation, and the elect recur in "The Secret of the Way Things Are." Similarly, both books reflect scribal activity with "a quest for divine communication," and "neither are concerned with the sacrificial cult of the Temple" (Elgvin 1996 : 131). The Work is also analogous to New Testament scripture, with recurring similarities found in Proverbs and the [[Gospel of Matthew]]. Although the terminology is not consistently parallel, the ideas and themes are comparable. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==Women==
An unusual aspect of this particular text is that it addresses women, which is very uncommon for an ancient Jewish text. 4Q413 appears to give advice to a woman, presumably the wife of the beginner being instructed (Harrington 2000: 826). This particular section uses feminine verbal forms, rather than the singular forms used throughout the rest of the instruction (Harrington 1996: 57).

'''''The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales''''' is a 1976 book by [[Austria|Austrian]]-born American author [[Bruno Bettelheim]], in which the author analyzes [[fairy tale]]s in terms of [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] psychoanalysis.

A 1991 article in the ''[[Journal of American Folklore]]'' presented a case that Bettelheim had engaged in plagiarism primarily from Julius Heuscher's ''A Psychiatric Study of Myths and Fairy Tales: Their Origin, Meaning, and Usefulness'' (1963).&lt;ref name=Journal-of-American-Folklore-Winter-1991/&gt;&lt;ref name=Los-Angeles-Times-February-7-1991/&gt;

==Structure and contents==
The book is divided into two main sections. The first, "A Pocketful of Magic," outlines Bettelheim's thoughts on the value of fairy tales for children. The second part, "In Fairy Land," presents psychoanalytical readings of several popular fairy tales, specifically:
*"[[Hansel and Gretel]]"
*"[[Little Red Riding Hood]]"
*"[[Jack and the Beanstalk]]"
*"[[Snow White]]"
*"[[Goldilocks and the Three Bears]]"
*"[[Sleeping Beauty|The Sleeping Beauty]]"
*"[[Cinderella]]"
*The "animal groom" cycle of fairy tales, including "[[Beauty and the Beast]]", "[[The Frog Prince]]" and "[[Bluebeard]]".

Bettelheim presents a case that fairy tales help children solve certain existential problems such separation anxiety, oedipal conflict, and sibling rivalries.  The extreme violence and ugly emotions of many fairy tales serve to deflect what may well be going on in the child's mind anyway.  A child's unrealistic fears often require unrealistic hopes.  And furthermore, "The Frog King" may be superior to modern sex education in that it acknowledges that a child may find sex disgusting, and this may serve a protective function for the child.&lt;ref name=New-York-Times-book-review-May-5-1976&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1976/05/05/archives/books-of-the-times-frog-king-as-sex-education-by-christopher.html?_r=0 Frog King as Sex Education], ''New York Times'', Books of the Times, Christopher Lehiyiann-Haltpt, May 5, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his introduction, Bettelheim stated that he was writing the book as “an educator and therapist of severely disturbed children.”&lt;ref name="The Uses of Enchantment, Bruno Bettelheim, 1975, 1976"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7WiODQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=%22If+we+hope+to+live+not+just+from+moment+to+moment,+but+in+true+consciousness+of+our+existence%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=12CBz9KaFH&amp;sig=Lv8f7Ym6g-FOZh9h0cKq7dW04ZQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiO16WzzdzVAhUnl1QKHRRZBREQ6AEIUjAM#v=onepage&amp;q=%22If%20we%20hope%20to%20live%20not%20just%20from%20moment%20to%20moment%2C%20but%20in%20true%20consciousness%20of%20our%20existence%22&amp;f=false The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales], Bruno Bettelheim, New York: Vintage Books (Random House), 1975, 1976.  "Portions of this book originally appeared in ''The New Yorker''."&lt;/ref&gt;
However, after his death his credentials in those fields were found to be faked, and Bettelheim had only taken three introductory classes in psychology.&lt;ref name="The Independent December 9, 1995"&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/turbulent-dreams-of-a-damaged-saint-1524787.html Turbulent dreams of a damaged saint], ''The Independent'' [UK], Nicholas Tucker, 8 December 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="New York Times, Book Review, January 13, 1997"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/13/books/an-icon-of-psychology-falls-from-his-pedestal.html?_r=0 An Icon of Psychology Falls From His Pedestal], ''New York Times'', Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, book review of ''The Creation of Dr. B'' by Richard Pollak, Jan. 13, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chicago Tribune, January 23, 1997"&gt;[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-01-23/features/9701230196_1_orthogenic-school-bruno-bettelheim-pollak Genius Or Fraud?

==Reception and influence==
In the U.S., Bettelheim and ''The Uses of Enchantment'' won the 1976 [[National Book Critics Circle Award]] for Criticism&lt;ref name=nbcc&gt;[http://bookcritics.org/awards/past_awards/ "All Past National Book Critics Circle Award Winners and Finalists"]. [[National Book Critics Circle]]. Retrieved 2012-03-09.&lt;/ref&gt;
and the 1977 [[National Book Award]] in [[List of winners of the National Book Award#Current|category Contemporary Thought]].&lt;ref name=nba1977&gt;
[https://www.nationalbook.org/awards-prizes/national-book-awards-1977 "National Book Awards – 1977"]. [[National Book Foundation]]. Retrieved 2012-03-09. &lt;br/&gt;There was a "Contemporary" or "Current" award category from 1972 to 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert A. Segal writes, ""It is the disjunction between Bettelheim's up-to-date approach to fairy tales and his old-fashioned approach to myths that is striking."&lt;ref name=Theorizing-About-Myth-Robert-Segal-1999&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_Po3t-bSoW8C&amp;pg=PA61&amp;lpg=PA61&amp;dq=%22disjunction+between+Bettelheim's+up-to-date+approach+to+fairy+tales+and+his+old-fashioned+approach+to+myths%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dygU-NLVu3&amp;sig=awN4S2OLL2Pxd-wsoOrU8wVYadg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjlwfDoipjRAhWX14MKHbNsBfYQ6AEIGzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22disjunction%20between%20Bettelheim's%20up-to-date%20approach%20to%20fairy%20tales%20and%20his%20old-fashioned%20approach%20to%20myths%22&amp;f=false Theorizing About Myth], Robert Alan Segal, University of Massachusetts Press, 1999, page 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Uses of Enchantment'' has been cited as an influence in many subsequent works that utilise fairy tales in adult terms, including the 2011 [[Catherine Hardwicke]] film ''[[Red Riding Hood (2011 film)|Red Riding Hood]]'' and the 2014 fantasy horror film ''[[Red Kingdom Rising]]''. It was claimed by [[Stephen Sondheim]] and [[James Lapine]] as the inspiration for their 1986 musical ''[[Into the Woods]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/07/19/specials/sondheim-woods.html Stage - Into the Woods], Frank Rich, ''New York Times'', November 6, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plagiarism==

In the Winter 1991 edition of the peer-reviewed ''[[Journal of American Folklore]]'', [[Alan Dundes]], then a 28-year veteran in the anthropology department at the University of California, Berkeley, presented a case that Bettelheim had copied key passages from ''A Psychiatric Study of Myths and Fairy Tales: Their Origin, Meaning, and Usefulness'' (1963, 1974 rev. ed.) by Julius Heuscher without giving appropriate credit, as well as unacknowledged borrowing from other sources.&lt;ref name=Journal-of-American-Folklore-Winter-1991&gt;Dundes, Alan: [https://www.jstor.org/pss/541135 "Bruno Bettelheim's Uses of Enchantment and Abuses of Scholarship"]. ''The Journal of American Folklore'', Vol. 104, N0. 411. (Winter, 1991): pages 74–83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Los-Angeles-Times-February-7-1991/&gt;&lt;ref name=A-Psychiatric-Study-Of-Fairy-Tales-Julius-Heuscher&gt;[http://iucat.iu.edu/iub/2289829 A Psychiatric Study of Fairy Tales: Their Origin, Meaning and Usefulness], Julius E. Heuscher, illus. by Melba Bennett, Springfield, Illinois: Thomas pub., 1963, 224 pages. See also [https://books.google.com/books?id=QUMhAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA2313&amp;lpg=PA2313&amp;dq=%22A+psychiatric+study+of+fairy+tales%22+revised&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ItgqMsBCNH&amp;sig=brUePMQAfpJuPYV9HlNr4ON_pN4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiMxfe9tvbPAhVkxYMKHbaiBGEQ6AEINzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=%22A%20psychiatric%20study%20of%20fairy%20tales%22%20revised&amp;f=false A Psychiatric Study of Fairy Tales: Their Origin, Meaning and Usefulness; an enlarged and thoroughly revised second edition], Julius E. Heuscher, Springfield, Illinois: Charles C. Thomas, publisher, April 1974, 422 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chicago-Tribune-February-7-1991/&gt;

Dundes states that Bettelheim engaged in "wholesale borrowing" of both "random passages" and "key ideas," primarily from Heuscher's book, but also from other sources.  Heuscher himself stated that he was not bothered by the disclosures.  Robert A. Georges, a professor of folklore at UCLA, states "it is clear he [Bettelheim] didn't do his homework."&lt;ref name=Los-Angeles-Times-February-7-1991&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1991-02-07/news/mn-1024_1_fairy-tales Bettelheim Plagiarized Book Ideas, Scholar Says : Authors: The late child psychologist is accused of 'wholesale borrowing' for study of fairy tales], ''Los Angeles Times'', Anne C. Roark, Feb. 7, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

Julius Heuscher himself did not consider it a big deal.  He said, "We all plagiarize. I plagiarize. Many times, I am not sure whether it came out of my own brain or if it came from somewhere else. . . . I'm only happy that I would have influenced Bruno Bettelheim. I did not always agree with him. But that does not matter. Poor Bruno Bettelheim. I would not want to disturb his eternal sleep with this."  (The ellipsis is in the ''Los Angeles Times'' article.)&lt;ref name=Los-Angeles-Times-February-7-1991/&gt;

Dundes also states that his own 1967 article on Cinderella was borrowed by Bettelheim without acknowledgement.  Jacquelyn Sanders, the director of the Orthogenic School at the University of Chicago in 1991, said she did not believe many people would agree with Dundes's accusations.  She stated, "I would not call that plagiarism.  I think the article is a reasonable scholarly endeavor, and calling it scholarly etiquette is appropriate. It is appropriate that this man deserved to be acknowledged and Bettelheim didn't. . . . But I would not fail a student for doing that, and I don't know anybody who would [ellipses in ''Chicago Tribune'' article]."&lt;ref name=Chicago-Tribune-February-7-1991&gt;{{Cite news

In reviewing a biography of Bettelheim in 1997, Sarah Boxer of the ''New York Times'' wrote, "Mr. Pollak gives a damning passage-for-passage comparison of the two [Bettelheim's 1976 ''Uses of Enchantment'' and Julius Heuscher's 1963 ''A Psychiatric Study of Fairy Tales'']."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/01/26/reviews/970126.boxer.html The Man He Always Wanted to Be], ''New York Times'', Books, Sarah Boxer, January 26, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grāmatu Nams '''Valters un Rapa''' (Book House Valters and Rapa) is a bookstore and publishing house in [[Riga]], [[Latvia]].

== History ==
In 1912, Janis Rapa together with the bibliophile Arturs Valters founded a [[limited partnership]] "A. Valters, J. Rapa and Company", a bookstore to serve Latvian intellectuals needs. In 1920 the limited partnership was changed to [[Joint Stock Company]] and went to new premises in 11 Teatra St. In 1924 Arturs Valters died, and in 1925 J. Grins came to assistance of J. Rapa.
Following the [[occupation of Latvia]] in 1940 the property owned by the Joint Stock Company was nationalized and operation of the company was stopped. There was established Publishing House of the State Printing and Publishing Department and its Central bookshop on the ground of the company.

In May 10, 1996, Valters un Rapa was re-established as a Joint-stock company. On October 28 of the same year Valters un Rapa published the first book of the re-established joint Stock Company – 2nd volume of collected works of [[Anna Brigadere]].

A '''winged unicorn''' (or '''flying unicorn''') is a fictional horse with wings like [[Pegasus]] and the horn of a [[unicorn]]. This creature has no specific name, but in some literature and media, it has been referred to as an '''alicorn''', a Latin word for the [[Unicorn horn|horn of a unicorn]], especially in alchemical texts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Odell |last= Shepard |title= The Lore of the Unicorn |year= 1930 |location= London |publisher= Unwin and Allen |isbn= 9781437508536}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as a '''pegacorn,''' a [[portmanteau]] of pegasus and unicorn.

Winged unicorns have been depicted in art. Ancient [[Achaemenid Assyria]]n seals depict winged unicorns and winged bulls as representing evil, but winged unicorns can also represent light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0OarxGMWrgkC&amp;pg=PA18 |page= 18 |isbn= 9780766185302 |title= The Unicorn: A Mythological Investigation |last= Brown |first= Robert |year= 2004 |publisher= Kessinger Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= The Ancient Seals from the Near East in the Metropolitan Museum: Old and Middle Persian Seals |first= Hans Henning |last= Von Der Osten |journal= The Art Bulletin |volume= 13 |issue= 2 |date= June 1931 |pages= 221–41 |jstor= 3050798}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irish poet [[W. B. Yeats]] wrote of imagining a winged beast that he associated with ecstatic destruction. The beast took the form of a winged unicorn in his 1907 play ''The Unicorn from the Stars'' and later that of the rough beast slouching towards Bethlehem in his poem "[[The Second Coming (poem)|The Second Coming]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Yeats's Conflicts with His Audience, 1897–1917 |first= David |last= Ward |journal= ELH |volume= 49 |issue= 1 |date= Spring 1982 |pages= 155–6 |jstor= 2872885}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3052">'''YoloArts''' (formerly known as the '''Yolo County Arts Council''') is a [[non-profit organization]], founded in 1981 as a recommendation of the [[Yolo County]] Cultural Plan to further the arts and culture of the county.

YoloArts mission is to cultivate and advocate support for all the arts, to participate in advancement of arts education in ours schools and community, and to foster communication among artists, business, education, government, and the residents of Yolo County.

==Programs==
YoloArts is known for its Arts Education and Outreach Programs which include Artists in Schools, ArtMix, Blues in YoloSchools, the Art &amp; Ag Project, Art in Public Places, Artists Workshops, YoloArts Musical Tour and Exhibitions at Gallery 625.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://yoloarts.org/programs-and-services | title=Art Education and Outreach Programs | accessdate=May 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
In 2012, [[National Endowment for the Arts]] chairman Rocco Landesman visited YoloArts to learn more about their Art &amp; Ag Project which has local Yolo County Artists interacting with local farmers at their farms to create artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=WDDB&amp;p_theme=wddb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;s_dispstring=allfields%28Art%20%2526%20Ag%20Project%29%20AND%20date%282012%29&amp;p_field_date-0=YMD_date&amp;p_params_date-0=date:B,E&amp;p_text_date-0=2012&amp;p_field_advanced-0=&amp;p_text_advanced-0=%28%22Art%22%20%26%20%22Ag%20Project%22%29&amp;xcal_numdocs=20&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;xcal_useweights=no | date=February 22, 2012 |title=Smith: Woodland put on the national map for 'Ag &amp; Art'| agency=The Daily Democrat | accessdate=May 14, 2012 | author=Smith, Jim}}{{registration required|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artists get regular, and safe, access to the landscapes they wish to paint or photograph. Farmers, in turn, benefit as well, with often publicly displayed art showcasing their land.

“This program has reminded people that the countryside is beautiful and the farmland is beautiful and if we don’t pay attention, it could be gone,” said Esparto resident Claire Haag, whose marriage is an art and ag project in itself — she’s a painter and her husband, James, is a [[walnut]] grower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.davisenterprise.com/local-news/ag-environment/ag-and-art-project-brings-nea-chair-to-yolo-county/ | title=Ag and Art Project brings NEA chair to Yolo | date=February 22, 2012 | agency=The Davis Enterprise | accessdate=May 14, 2012 | author=Ternus-Bellamy, Anne}}&lt;/ref&gt; Locally, the Art and Ag Project is celebrated every fall with an Art Farm Exhibition Gala that features an Art Harvest and Taste of Yolo. There farmers can often be found bidding on the artwork depicting their own land and homes.
