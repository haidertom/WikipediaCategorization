Princeton physicist [[Gerard O'Neill|Gerard K. O'Neill]]'s 1981 book, '''''2081: A Hopeful View of the Human Future''''' was an attempt to predict the technological and social state of humanity 100 years in the future. O'Neill's positive attitude towards both technology and human potential distinguished this book from gloomy predictions of a [[Malthusian catastrophe]] by contemporary scientists. [[Paul R. Ehrlich]] wrote in 1968 in ''[[The Population Bomb]]'', "in the 1970s and 1980s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death". The [[Club of Rome]]'s 1972 ''[[Limits to Growth]]'' predicted a catastrophic end to the Industrial Revolution within 100 years from resource exhaustion and pollution.

O'Neill's contrary view had two main components. First, he analyzed the previous attempts to predict the future of society—including many catastrophes that had not materialized. Second, he extrapolated historical trends under the assumption that the obstacles identified by other authors would be overcome by five technological "Drivers of Change". He extrapolated an average American family income in 2081 of $1 million/year. Two developments based on his own research were responsible for much of his optimism. In ''[[The High Frontier: Human Colonies in Space]]'' O'Neill described solar power satellites that provide unlimited clean energy, making it far easier for humanity to reach and exceed present developed-world living standards. Overpopulation pressures would be relieved as billions of people eventually emigrate to colonies in free space. These colonies would offer an Earth-like environment but with vastly higher productivity for industry and agriculture. These colonies and satellites would be constructed from asteroid or lunar materials launched into the desired orbits cheaply by the [[Mass Driver 1|mass drivers]] O'Neill's group developed.

== Part I: The Art of Prophecy ==
Previous futurist authors he cites:
* [[Edward Bellamy]]
* [[J.D. Bernal]]
* [[McGeorge Bundy]]
* [[Arthur C. Clarke]]
* [[George Darwin]]
* [[J. B. S. Haldane]]
* [[Robert Heilbroner]]
* [[Aldous Huxley]]
* [[Rudyard Kipling]]
* [[Thomas More]]
* [[George Orwell]]
* [[George Thompson (author)|George Thompson]]
* [[Konstantin Tsiolkovski]]
* [[Jules Verne]]
* [[H.G. Wells]]
* [[Eugene Zamiatin]]

Arthur C. Clarke's ''Profiles of the Future'' included a long list of predictions, many of which O'Neill endorsed. Two of his maxims that O'Neill quotes &lt;ref&gt;[[#ONeill81|O'Neill 1981]]: 27&lt;/ref&gt; seem to sum up O'Neill's attitude, as well:
* "anything that is theoretically possible will be achieved in practice, no matter what the technical difficulties, if it is desired greatly enough"
* "We can never run out of energy or matter, but we can all too easily run out of brains."

== Part II: The Drivers of Change ==
Sections are included on the five key "Drivers of Change" believed by O'Neill to be the focus of future development:
* [[Automation]]
* [[Colonization of space|Space Colonies]]
* [[Communications]]
* [[Computers]]
* [[Energy]]

O'Neill applied basic physics to understand the limits of possible change, using the history of the technology to extrapolate likely progress. He applied the history of computing to reason about how people and institutions will shape and be shaped by the likely changes. He predicted that future computers must run at a very low-voltage because of heat. The main basis of his technology extrapolation for computers is [[Moore's Law]], one of the greatest successes of [[Trend estimation]] in predicting human progress.

His predicted the social aspects of the future of computers. He identified computers as the most certain of his five "drivers of change", because their adoption could be driven primarily by individual or local decisions, while the other four such as space colonies depended on large-scale decision-making. He observed the success of minicomputers, calculators, and the first home computers, and predicted that every home would have a computer in a hundred years. With the aid of speculations by computer pioneers such as [[John von Neumann]] and the writers of "tracts" such as [[Yevgeny Zamyatin|Zamyatin]]'s ''[[We (novel)|We]]'', O'Neill also predicted that privacy would be under siege from computers in 2081.

O'Neill predicted that [[software engineering]] issues and the intractability of [[artificial intelligence]] problems would require massive programming efforts and very powerful processors to achieve truly usable computers. His prediction was based on the difficulties and failures of computer use he had observed in 1981, including a candid horror story of his own [[Princeton University]] library's attempt to computerize its operations. His computers of the future, represented by the robot butler his visitor to Earth encounters in 2081, included speaker-independent [[speech recognition]] and [[natural language processing]]. O'Neill correctly pointed out the huge difference between computers and human brains, and stated that, while a more human-like artificial brain is a worthy goal, computers will be vastly improved descendants of today's rather than truly intelligent and creative artificial brains.

== Part III: The World in 2081 ==

This section was written as a series of dispatches home from "Eric C. Rawson", a native of a distant space colony called "Fox Cluster". By analogy with American religious colonists such as the Puritans and Mormons, O'Neill suggests that such a colony might have been founded by a group of pacifists who chose to live about twice as far from the Sun as Pluto in order to avoid involvement in Earth's wars. His calculations indicate that colonies at this distance could have Earth-level sunlight using a mirror the same weight as the colony itself. Eric pays a visit to the Earth of 2081 to take care of family business and explore a world that is nearly as foreign to him as it is to us.

After each dispatch, O'Neill added a section that described his reasoning for each situation the visitor described, such as riding a "floater" train going thousands of miles per hour in vacuum, interacting with a household robot or visiting a fully enclosed Pennsylvania city with a tropical climate in midwinter. Each section was written from his perspective as a physicist. For example, his description of "Honolulu, Pennsylvania" included multiple roof layers that could be retracted in good weather. The city enjoyed an artificial tropical climate all year because of internal climate controls and advanced insulation. He also proposed magnetically levitated "floater" trains moving in very-low-pressure tunnels that would replace airplanes on heavily traveled routes.

==Part IV: Wild Cards==
This section explores, not the most probable outcomes, but "the limits of the possible": how likely some scenarios O'Neill considered less probable are, and what they might mean. These included nuclear annihilation, attaining immortality, and contact with extraterrestrial civilizations. For this last case, he presents a thought experiment about how a hypothetical alien civilization, the "Primans", could explore the galaxy with self-replicating robots, monitoring every planetary system in the Galaxy without betraying their own position, and destroying intelligent life (by building giant mirrors to incinerate the planet) if they felt threatened. This experiment seems to prove that conflict or even surprise contact with an intelligent alien life form—that staple of science fiction—is highly unlikely.

{{Platonism}}

The '''Allegory of the Cave''', or '''Plato's Cave''', was presented by the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] philosopher [[Plato]] in his work ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' (514a–520a) to compare "the effect of [[education]] ([[Wiktionary:παιδεία|παιδεία]]) and the lack of it on our [[physis|nature]]". It is written as a dialogue between Plato's brother [[Glaucon]] and his mentor [[Socrates]], narrated by the latter. The allegory is presented after the [[analogy of the sun]] (508b–509c) and the [[analogy of the divided line]] (509d–511e). All three are characterized in relation to [[dialectic]] at the end of Books&amp;nbsp;VII and VIII (531d–534e).

Plato has Socrates describe a group of people who have lived chained to the wall of a cave all of their lives, facing a blank wall. The people watch shadows projected on the wall from objects passing in front of a fire behind them, and give names to these shadows. The shadows are the prisoners' reality. Socrates explains how the philosopher is like a prisoner who is freed from the cave and comes to understand that the shadows on the wall are not reality at all, for he can perceive the true form of reality rather than the manufactured reality that is the shadows seen by the prisoners. The inmates of this place do not even desire to leave their prison, for they know no better life. The prisoners manage to break their bonds one day, and discover that their reality was not what they thought it was. They discovered the sun, which Plato uses as an analogy for the fire that man cannot see behind. Like the fire that cast light on the walls of the cave, the human condition is forever bound to the impressions that are received through the [[sense]]s. Even if these interpretations (or, in [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] terminology, intuitions) are an absurd misrepresentation of reality, we cannot somehow break free from the bonds of our human condition—we cannot free ourselves from phenomenal state just as the prisoners could not free themselves from their chains. If, however, we were to miraculously escape our bondage, we would find a world that we could not understand—the sun is incomprehensible for someone who has never seen it. In other words, we would encounter another "realm", a place incomprehensible because, theoretically, it is the source of a higher reality than the one we have always known; it is the realm of pure [[Theory of forms|Form]], pure fact.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, A. S. "Plato's Simile of Light. (Part II.) The Allegory of the Cave (Continued)". ''The Classical Quarterly'' 16, no. 1 (1922): 15–28. {{jstor|636164}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Socrates remarks that this allegory can be paired with previous writings, namely the analogy of the sun and the analogy of the divided line.

==Terminology==
The allegory of the cave is also called the '''''analogy of the cave''''', '''''myth of the cave''''', '''''metaphor of the cave''''', '''''parable of the cave''''', and '''''Plato's Cave'''''.&lt;ref&gt;The various English names of this allegory were often traditionally capitalized as if they were the names of a chapter in Plato's text, which is not correct, or according to an older style that capitalized all (famous) allegories and theories and even concepts. Wikipedia's manual of style does not follow this older practice, and neither do many modern publications in reliable sources nor, for example, the Encyclopædia Britannica and the Columbia Encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Imprisonment in the cave ===
Plato begins by having Socrates ask Glaucon to imagine a cave where people have been imprisoned from birth. These prisoners are chained so that their legs and necks are fixed, forcing them to gaze at the wall in front of them and not look around at the cave, each other, or themselves (514a–b).&lt;ref name="The Republic"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Plato|editor1-last=Rouse|editor1-first=W.H.D.|title=The Republic Book VII|publisher=Penguin Group Inc|pages=365–401}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behind the prisoners is a fire, and between the fire and the prisoners is a raised walkway with a low wall, behind which people walk carrying objects or puppets "of men and other living things" (514b).&lt;ref name="The Republic" /&gt; The people walk behind the wall so their bodies do not cast shadows for the prisoners to see, but the objects they carry do ("just as puppet showmen have screens in front of them at which they work their puppets" (514a)&lt;ref name="The Republic" /&gt;). The prisoners cannot see any of what is happening behind them, they are only able to see the shadows cast upon the cave wall in front of them. The sounds of the people talking echo off the walls, and the prisoners believe these sounds come from the shadows (514c).&lt;ref name="The Republic" /&gt;

Socrates suggests that the shadows are reality for the prisoners because they have never seen anything else; they do not realize that what they see are shadows of objects in front of a fire, much less that these objects are inspired by real things outside the cave which they do not see (514b-515a).&lt;ref name="The Republic" /&gt;

===Departure from the cave===

Plato then supposes that one prisoner is freed. This prisoner would look around and see the fire. The light would hurt his eyes and make it difficult for him to see the objects casting the shadows. If he were told that what he is seeing is ''real'' instead of the other version of reality he sees on the wall, he would not believe it. In his pain, Plato continues, the freed prisoner would turn away and run back to what he is accustomed to (that is, the shadows of the carried objects). He writes "... it would hurt his eyes, and he would escape by turning away to the things which he was able to look at, and these he would believe to be clearer than what was being shown to him."&lt;ref name="The Republic" /&gt;

Plato continues: "Suppose... that someone should drag him... by force, up the rough ascent, the steep way up, and never stop until he could drag him out into the light of the sun."&lt;ref name="The Republic" /&gt; The prisoner would be angry and in pain, and this would only worsen when the radiant light of the sun overwhelms his eyes and blinds him.&lt;ref name="The Republic" /&gt;

"Slowly, his eyes adjust to the light of the sun. First he can only see shadows. Gradually he can see the reflections of people and things in water and then later see the people and things themselves. Eventually, he is able to look at the stars and moon at night until finally he can look upon the sun itself (516a)."&lt;ref name="The Republic" /&gt; Only after he can look straight at the sun "is he able to reason about it" and what it is (516b).&lt;ref name="The Republic" /&gt; (See also [[Analogy of the Sun|Plato's Analogy of the Sun]], which occurs near the end of ''The Republic'', Book VI.&lt;ref&gt;Jowett, B. (ed.) (1941). ''Plato's The Republic''. New York: The Modern Library. {{OCLC|964319}}.&lt;/ref&gt;)

===Return to the cave===
Plato continues, saying that the freed prisoner would think that the world outside the cave was superior to the world he experienced in the cave; "he would bless himself for the change, and pity [the other prisoners]" and would want to bring his fellow cave dwellers out of the cave and into the sunlight (516c).&lt;ref name="The Republic" /&gt;

The returning prisoner, whose eyes have become accustomed to the sunlight, would be blind when he re-enters the cave, just as he was when he was first exposed to the sun (516e).&lt;ref name="The Republic" /&gt; The prisoners, according to Plato, would infer from the returning man's blindness that the journey out of the cave had harmed him and that they should not undertake a similar journey. Plato concludes that the prisoners, if they were able, would therefore reach out and kill anyone who attempted to drag them out of the cave (517a).&lt;ref name="The Republic" /&gt;

== Symbolism  ==
[[File:Plato - Allegory of the Cave.png|thumb|200px|right|"Plato's Cave Allegory" by Markus Maurer]] The allegory contains many forms of symbolism used to describe the illusions of the world. The cave represents the superficial world for the prisoners. The chains that prevent the prisoners from leaving the cave represent ignorance, meaning the chains are stopping them from learning the truth. The shadows that cast on the walls of the cave represent the superficial truth, which is an illusion that the prisoners see in the cave. The freed prisoner represents those in society who see the physical world for the illusion that it is. The sun that is glaring the eyes of the prisoners represents the real truth of the actual world.&lt;ref name="The Republic" /&gt;

==Themes in the allegory appearing elsewhere in Plato's work==
The allegory is probably related to Plato's [[theory of Forms]], according to which the "Forms" (or "[[Idea]]s"), and not the material world known to us through sensation, possess the highest and most fundamental kind of reality. Only knowledge of the Forms constitutes real knowledge or what Socrates considers "the good".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first=Stephen | last=Watt | contribution=Introduction: The Theory of Forms (Books 5–7) | title=Plato: Republic | year=1997 | pages=xiv–xvi | place=London | publisher=Wordsworth Editions | isbn=978-1-85326-483-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Socrates informs Glaucon that the most excellent people must follow the highest of all studies, which is to behold the Good. Those who have ascended to this highest level, however, must not remain there but must return to the cave and dwell with the prisoners, sharing in their labors and honors.

Plato's ''[[Phaedo]]'' contains similar imagery to that of the allegory of the Cave; a philosopher recognizes that before philosophy, his soul was "a veritable prisoner fast bound within his body... and that instead of investigating reality of itself and in itself is compelled to peer through the bars of a prison."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elliott|first=R. K.|title=Socrates and Plato's Cave|journal=Kant-Studien|year=1967|volume=58|issue=2|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarly discussion==
Scholars debate the possible interpretations of the allegory of the Cave, either looking at it from an [[Epistemology|epistemological]] standpoint – one based on the study of how Plato believes we come to know things – or through a political ([[Politeia]]) lens.&lt;sup&gt;[[Allegory of the Cave#cite note-Hall-6|[6]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Much of the scholarship on the allegory falls between these two perspectives, with some completely independent of either. The epistemological view and the political view, fathered by [[Richard Lewis Nettleship]] and A.S. Ferguson respectively, tend to be discussed most frequently.&lt;sup&gt;[[Allegory of the Cave#cite note-Hall-6|[6]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Nettleship interprets the allegory of the cave as representative of our innate intellectual incapacity, in order to contrast our lesser understanding with that of the philosopher, as well as an allegory about people who are unable or unwilling to seek truth and wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Dale. "INTERPRETING PLATO'S CAVE AS AN ALLEGORY OF THE HUMAN CONDITION." ''Apeiron: A Journal for Ancient Philosophy and Science'' 14, no. 2 (1980): 74-86. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.jstor.org/stable/40913453&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Ferguson, on the other hand, bases his interpretation of the allegory on the claim that the cave is an allegory of human nature and that it symbolizes the opposition between the philosopher and the corruption of the prevailing political condition.&lt;sup&gt;[[Allegory of the Cave#cite note-Nettleship-7|[7]]][[Allegory of the Cave#cite note-Ferguson-8|[8]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

Cleavages have emerged within these respective camps of thought, however. Much of the modern scholarly debate surrounding the allegory has emerged from [[Martin Heidegger]]'s exploration of the allegory, and philosophy as a whole, through the lens of human freedom in his book ''The Essence of Human Freedom: An Introduction to Philosophy and The Essence of Truth: On Plato's Cave Allegory and Theaetetus''.&lt;ref&gt;McNiell, William. "Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews." The Essence of Human Freedom: An Introduction to Philosophy and The Essence of Truth: On Plato's Cave Allegory and Theaetetus // Reviews // Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews // University of Notre Dame. Accessed December 09, 2016. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/23227/&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, [[Hannah Arendt]], an advocate of the political interpretation of the allegory, suggests that through the allegory, Plato "wanted to apply his own theory of ideas to politics".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Abensour, Miguel. ''Against the Sovereignty of Philosophy over Politics: Arendt's Reading of Plato's Cave Allegory Social Research''; Winter 2007; 74, 4; ProQuest Social Sciences Premium Collection pg. 955&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, Heidegger argues that the essence of truth is a way of being and not an object.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, Sally. "Discovering the Unhidden: Heidegger's Interpretation of Plato's Allegory of the Cave and Its Implications for Psychotherapy." ''Existential Analysis'' 22, no. 1 (January 2011). Accessed December 8, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Arendt criticised Heidegger's interpretation of the allegory, writing that "Heidegger…is off base in using the cave simile to interpret and 'criticize' Plato's theory of ideas".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Influence==
The themes and imagery of Plato's cave have appeared throughout Western thought and culture. Some examples include:

* Evolutionary biologist [[Jeremy Griffith]]'s book ''A Species In Denial'' includes the chapter "Deciphering Plato's Cave Allegory".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffith|first=Jeremy|title=A Species in Denial|year=2003|publisher=WTM Publishing &amp; Communications|location=Sydney|isbn=978-1-74129-000-4 |page=83 |url=http://www.worldtransformation.com/asid-deciphering-platos-cave-allegory/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The films ''[[The Conformist (1970 film)|The Conformist]]'', ''[[The Matrix]]'', ''[[Dark City (1998 film)|Dark City]]'', ''[[The Truman Show]]'' and ''[[City of Ember]]'' model Plato's Allegory of the Cave.&lt;ref&gt;''The Matrix and Philosophy: Welcome to the Desert of the Real'' by William Irwin.

The '''Alpine Club classification of the Eastern Alps''' ({{lang-de|Alpenvereinseinteilung der Ostalpen}}, '''AVE''') is a common division of the [[Eastern Alps]] into 75 [[mountain range]]s, based on the Moriggl Classification (ME) first published in 1924 by the [[German and Austrian Alpine Club]]. The present-day division established for the German-speaking world (less [[Switzerland]]) was compiled by the [[German Alpine Club|German]], [[Austrian Alpine Club|Austrian]] and [[South Tyrol Alpine Club]]s and published in 1984 and is also used for the basic numbering of [[Alpine Club map]]s for [[mountaineering]].

== Classification system ==
The Eastern Alps are divided into four main areas: the  [[Northern Limestone Alps]], the [[Central Eastern Alps]], the [[Southern Limestone Alps]], and the [[List of mountain groups in the Alpine Club classification of the Eastern Alps|Western Limestone Alps]]. These four main ranges are further divided into 75 sub-groups. The Northern Limestone and Central Eastern Alps are the largest with 27 groups each, while the Southern Limestone Alps have 15. The six groups of the Western Limestone Alps are also classed with the Central Eastern Alps.

The classification is based principally on [[orography|orographic]] considerations and takes account of the regional usage in terms of the names of the mountain groups. The amendments of 1984 address a number of [[Geology of the Alps|geological]] problems and have dropped many of the 1924 Morrigl groups, making more precise sub-divisions for them in other areas. These changes are evident from the missing serial numbers and sub-division letters. The Western Limestone Alps were added, an area which is not covered by the three Alpine Clubs and actually is a continuation of the [[Southern Alps (geology)|Southern]] and [[Swiss Alps]]. Unlike the previous scheme, the [[Salzburg Slate Alps]] were assigned to the Northern Limestone Alps as they are part of the [[greywacke zone]] that forms the [[Basement (geology)|basement]] of the Limestone Alps. The [[Ortler Alps]] and the [[Monte Sobretta|Sobretta]]-[[Monte Gavia|Gavia]] range were grouped into the Southern Limestone Alps, though geologically, they are north of the [[Periadriatic Seam]] and ranked part of the [[Austroalpine nappes]].

== Geographical characteristics ==
The Eastern Alps extend across six European countries: [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Slovenia]]. With 57 mountain groups, Austria has the largest share. It is followed by Italy with 23 and Switzerland with ten. There are seven mountain ranges in Germany and four in Slovenia. Liechtenstein shares one group.

The only [[four-thousander]] and the highest mountain in the Eastern Alps is the [[Piz Bernina]] at {{convert|4046|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Thus the [[Bernina Range]] is the highest of all the groups in the Eastern Alps. Next are the [[Ortler Alps]], whose highest peak, Mt. [[Ortler]] at {{convert|3905|m|ft|abbr=on}}, is the highest mountain in South Tyrol. The third highest range is the [[Glockner Group]] with the highest mountain in Austria: the [[Grossglockner]] at {{convert|3798|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Another 22 groups reach a height of 3,000 metres. The only group in the Northern Limestone Alps with a three-thousander is the [[Lechtal Alps]], whose highest summit is the [[Parseierspitze]] at {{convert|3036|m|ft|abbr=on}}. 39 groups are over 2000 metres high. Seven of the groups exceed 1000 metres—except for the [[Vienna Woods]], whose highest mountain, the [[Schöpfl]], just reaches an altitude of {{convert|893|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

== Mountain groups as per the Alpine Club classification ==
See [[List of mountain groups in the Alpine Club classification of the Eastern Alps]]

== Other classifications ==
Up to today, there is no internationally accepted classification of the Alps. Beside the common AVE arrangement, the [[Swiss Alpine Club]] subdivides the Swiss Alps (including the East Alpine parts) along [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantonal]] boundaries, while Austrian [[hydrography]] uses a slightly different orographic system. In [[Italy]] and [[France]] the segmentation is usually based on the 1926 ''[[Partizione delle Alpi]]''. In 2005, a new proposal was made by the Italian Alpinist, Sergio Marazzi, to merge the competing systems of the [[Alpine states]] into the ''Suddivisione Orografica Internazionale Unificata del Sistema Alpino'' ([[SOIUSA]]), but this has not gained acceptance.

The '''Blue Brain''', a Swiss national brain initiative, aims to create a digital reconstruction of the brain by [[Reverse engineering|reverse-engineering]] mammalian brain circuitry. The mission of the project, founded in May 2005 by the Brain and Mind Institute of the ''[[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne]]'' (EPFL) in Switzerland, is to use biologically-detailed digital reconstructions and simulations of the mammalian brain ([[brain simulation]]) to identify the fundamental principles of brain structure and function in health and disease.

The project is headed by the founding director [[Henry Markram]], who also launched the European [[Human Brain Project]], and co-directed by [[Felix Schürmann]] and [[Sean Hill (scientist)|Sean Hill]]. Using a [[Blue Gene]] [[supercomputer]] running Michael Hines's [[Neuron (software)|NEURON software]], the simulation does not consist simply of an [[artificial neural network]], but involves a biologically realistic model of [[neuron]]s,&lt;ref name="Brainsim"&gt;Graham-Rowe, Duncan. [https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7470--mission-to-build-a-simulated-brain-begins.html "Mission to build a simulated brain begins"], ''NewScientist'', June 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Jason. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8012496.stm Simulated brain closer to thought], BBC News.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ASC 2012"&gt;{{cite web|last=Segev|first=Idan|title=ASC 2012: Prof. Idan Segev - The blue brain|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBTjIGI44Tk|work=The Hebrew University of Jerusalem|accessdate=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an empirically reconstructed model [[connectome]].&lt;!--- [[The Brain with David Eagleman]] covers this effort for the mouse brain, if someone can figure out how to properly cite this segment. --&gt; It is hoped that it will eventually shed light on the nature of [[consciousness]].&lt;ref name="ASC 2012"/&gt;

There are a number of sub-projects, including the [[Cajal Blue Brain]], coordinated by the [[Supercomputing and Visualization Center of Madrid]] (CeSViMa), and others run by universities and independent laboratories.

==Goal==

===Neocortical column modelling===
The initial goal of the project, completed in December 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bluebrain.epfl.ch/Jahia/site/bluebrain/op/edit/pid/19085|title=Project Milestones|work=Blue Brain|accessdate=2008-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the simulation of a rat [[cortical column|neocortical column]], which is considered by some researchers to be the smallest functional unit of the [[neocortex]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=1569491 | pmid=15937015 | doi=10.1098/rstb.2005.1623 | volume=360 | title=The cortical column: a structure without a function | date=April 2005 | journal=Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. | pages=837–62 | last1 = Horton | first1 = JC | last2 = Adams | first2 = DL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Author: Rakic, P.  | Journal: National Academy of Sciences |105[34] | pp: 12099-12100 |  web: http://www.pnas.org/content/105/34/12099.full&lt;/ref&gt; (the part of the brain thought to be responsible for higher functions such as conscious thought). In humans, each column is about 2&amp;nbsp;mm in length, has a diameter of 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm and contains about 60,000 [[neuron]]s; [[Brown Rat|rat]] neocortical columns are very similar in structure but contain only 10,000 neurons (and 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; [[synapse]]s). Between 1995 and 2005, Markram mapped the types of neurons and their connections in such a column.

==Progress==
In November 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bluebrain.epfl.ch/page18700.html|title=News and Media information|work=Blue Brain|accessdate=2008-08-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919051656/http://bluebrain.epfl.ch/page18700.html|archivedate=2008-09-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the project reported the end of the first phase, delivering a data-driven process for creating, validating, and researching the neocortical column.

By 2005, the first single cellular model was completed. The first artificial cellular neocortical column of 10,000 cells was built by 2008. By July 2011, a cellular mesocircuit of 100 neocortical columns with a million cells in total was built. A cellular rat brain is planned{{update after|2015|7|31}} for 2014 with 100 mesocircuits totalling a hundred million cells. Finally a cellular human brain is predicted possible by 2023 equivalent to 1000 rat brains with a total of a hundred billion cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kurzweilai.net/henry-markram-simulating-the-brain-next-decisive-years|title=Henry Markram: Simulating the brain; the next decisive years, video [3/3] 07:00|accessdate=2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn_gEoQ8nQI#!|title=Henry Markram: Simulating the brain; the next decisive years - 07:00|accessdate=2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Now that the column is finished, the project is currently busying itself with the publishing of initial results in scientific literature, and pursuing two separate goals:
# construction of a simulation on the ''molecular level'',&lt;ref name="Brainsim"/&gt; which is desirable since it allows studying the effects of [[gene expression]];
# simplification of the column simulation to allow for parallel simulation of large numbers of connected columns, with the ultimate goal of simulating a whole neocortex (which in humans consists of about 1 million cortical columns).

In 2015, scientists at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) developed a quantitative model of the previously unknown relationship between the glial cell astrocytes and neurons.  This model describes the energy management of the brain through the function of the neuro-glial vascular unit (NGV).  The additional layer of neuron-glial cells is being added to Blue Brain Project models to improve functionality of the system.&lt;ref&gt;Multi-timescale Modeling of Activity-Dependent Metabolic Coupling in the Neuron-Glia-Vasculature Ensemble. PLOS Computational Biology, 2015. http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004036&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently,Blue Brain Project releases first-ever digital 3D brain cell atlas:- The Blue Brain Cell Atlas is like 'going from hand-drawn maps to Google Earth' -- providing previously unavailable information on major cell types, numbers and positions in all 737 brain regions. This comprehensive, interactive and dynamic online resource allows anyone to visualize every region in the mouse brain, cell-by-cell and in 3D, and freely download data for new analyses and modelling. It can also be continuously be updated with new findings.&lt;ref&gt;Science-Daily https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/11/181128082718.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funding===
The project is funded primarily by the [[Swiss]] government and the [[Future and Emerging Technologies]] (FET) Flagship grant from the [[European Commission]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/news/billion-euro-brain-simulation-and-graphene-projects-win-european-funds-1.12291|title=Billion-euro brain simulation and graphene projects win European funds|work=Nature, January 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and secondarily by grants and some donations from private individuals. The [[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne|EPFL]] bought the Blue Gene computer at a reduced cost because at that stage it was still a prototype and IBM was interested in exploring how different applications would perform on the machine. BBP was viewed a validation of the Blue Gene supercomputer concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://technology-report.com/2009/01/blue-brain-project-ibm-has-not-withdrawn-support/|title=Blue Brain Project - IBM has not withdrawn support|work=Henry Markram, Project Director as quoted by IBM Switzerland to Technology Report on January 19, 2009| accessdate=2009-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Documentary===

A 10-part documentary is being made by film director Noah Hutton, with each installment detailing the year-long workings of the project at the EPFL. Having started filming in 2009, the documentary is planned to be released in 2020, after the years of filming and editing have finished. Regular contributions from Henry Markram and the rest of the team provide an insight into the Blue Brain Project, while similar research tasks across the world are touched on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bluebrainfilm.com/bb/|title= Blue Brain Film Information}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cajal Blue Brain (Spain) ===
[[Image:UPM-CeSViMa-SupercomputadorMagerit.jpg|thumb|right|Cajal Blue Brain used the [[Magerit]] supercomputer ([[CeSViMa]])]]

The Cajal Blue Brain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://cajalbbp.cesvima.upm.es |title=Cajal Blue Brain Project |accessdate=2011-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; is coordinated by the [[Technical University of Madrid]] and uses the facilities of the [[Supercomputing and Visualization Center of Madrid]] and its supercomputer [[Magerit]]. The [[Cajal Institute]] also participates in this collaboration. The main lines of research currently being pursued at Cajal Blue Brain include neurological experimentation and computer simulations. Nanotechnology, in the form of a newly designed brain microscope, plays an important role in its research plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.azonano.com/news.asp?newsID=11626 |title=Nanotechnology Microscope for Brain Studies |accessdate=2011-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bottling''' is when a concert audience throws various objects at the performers onstage. This generally happens at festivals when one act in the lineup is of a different genre or audience from the rest of the bands, especially festivals where the majority of bands are related to [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[punk rock]] music styles.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://music.guardian.co.uk/readingandleeds2007/story/0,,2155832,00.html|title=Hitting rock bottom|publisher=[[guardian.co.uk]]|accessdate=2008-06-19 | location=London | first=Tim | last=Jonze | date=2007-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While bottling generally involves empty or full bottles of water, it is also common for bottles to contain [[urine]]. Other items such as garden furniture, [[mud]], [[fireworks]], broken glass, shoes and dead animals have also been recorded as thrown items.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

A '''chemical formula''' is a way of  presenting information about the chemical proportions of [[atom]]s that constitute a particular [[chemical compound]] or molecule, using [[chemical element]] symbols, numbers, and sometimes also other symbols, such as parentheses, dashes, brackets, commas and ''plus'' (+) and ''minus'' (−) signs. These are limited to a single typographic line of symbols, which may include subscripts and superscripts. A chemical formula is not a [[chemical nomenclature|chemical name]], and it contains no words. Although a chemical formula may imply certain simple chemical structures, it is not the same as a full chemical [[structural formula]]. Chemical formulas can fully specify the structure of only the simplest of [[molecule]]s and [[chemical substance]]s, and are generally more limited in power than are chemical names and structural formulas.

The simplest types of chemical formulas are called ''[[empirical formula]]s'', which use letters and numbers indicating the numerical ''proportions'' of atoms of each type. '''Molecular formulas''' indicate the simple numbers of each type of atom in a molecule, with no information on structure. For example, the empirical formula for glucose is CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (twice as many hydrogen atoms as carbon and oxygen), while its molecular formula is C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (12 hydrogen atoms, six carbon and oxygen atoms).

Sometimes a chemical formula is complicated by being written as a [[condensed formula]] (or condensed molecular formula, occasionally called a "semi-structural formula"), which conveys additional information about the particular ways in which the atoms are [[chemical bond|chemically bonded]] together, either in [[covalent bond]]s, [[ionic bond]]s, or various combinations of these types. This is possible if the relevant bonding is easy to show in one dimension. An example is the condensed molecular/chemical formula for ethanol, which is CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-OH or CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH. However, even a condensed chemical formula is necessarily limited in its ability to show complex bonding relationships between atoms, especially atoms that have bonds to four or more different [[substituent]]s.

Since a chemical formula must be expressed as a single line of chemical element symbols, it often cannot be as informative as a true structural formula, which is a graphical representation of the spatial relationship between atoms in chemical compounds (see for example the figure for butane structural and chemical formulas, at right). For reasons of structural complexity, there is no condensed chemical formula (or semi-structural formula) that specifies glucose (and there exist many different molecules, for example [[fructose]] and [[mannose]], that have the same [[molecular formula]] [[C6H12O6|C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] as glucose). Linear equivalent chemical ''names'' exist that can and do specify any complex structural formula (see [[chemical nomenclature]]), but such names must use many terms (words), rather than the simple element symbols, numbers, and simple typographical symbols that define a chemical formula.

Chemical formulas may be used in [[chemical equation]]s to describe [[chemical reaction]]s and other chemical transformations, such as the dissolving of ionic compounds into solution. While, as noted, chemical formulas do not have the full power of structural formulas to show chemical relationships between atoms, they are sufficient to keep track of numbers of atoms and numbers of electrical charges in chemical reactions, thus [[Chemical equation#Balancing chemical equations|balancing chemical equations]] so that these equations can be used in chemical problems involving conservation of atoms, and conservation of electric charge.

== Overview ==
A chemical formula identifies each constituent [[chemical element|element]] by its [[chemical symbol]] and indicates the proportionate number of atoms of each element. In empirical formulas, these proportions begin with a key element and then assign numbers of atoms of the other elements in the compound, by ratios to the key element. For molecular compounds, these ratio numbers can all be expressed as whole numbers. For example, the empirical formula of [[ethanol]] may be written C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O because the molecules of ethanol all contain two carbon atoms, six hydrogen atoms, and one oxygen atom. Some types of ionic compounds, however, cannot be written with entirely whole-number empirical formulas. An example is [[boron carbide]], whose formula of CB&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is a variable non-whole number ratio with n ranging from over 4 to more than 6.5.

When the chemical compound of the formula consists of simple [[molecule]]s, chemical formulas often employ ways to suggest the structure of the molecule. These types of formulas are variously known as ''molecular formulas'' and ''[[structural formula|condensed formulas]]''. A molecular formula enumerates the number of atoms to reflect those in the molecule, so that the molecular formula for [[glucose]] is C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; rather than the glucose empirical formula, which is CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. However, except for very simple substances, molecular chemical formulas lack needed structural information, and are ambiguous.

For simple molecules, a condensed (or semi-structural) formula is a type of chemical formula that may fully imply a correct structural formula. For example, [[ethanol]] may be represented by the condensed chemical formula CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH, and [[dimethyl ether]] by the condensed formula CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. These two molecules have the same empirical and molecular formulas (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O), but may be differentiated by the condensed formulas shown, which are sufficient to represent the full structure of these simple [[organic compound]]s.

Condensed chemical formulas may also be used to represent [[ionic compound]]s that do not exist as discrete molecules, but nonetheless do contain covalently bound clusters within them. These [[polyatomic ion]]s are groups of atoms that are covalently bound together and have an overall ionic charge, such as the sulfate {{chem|[S|O|4|]|2-}} ion. Each polyatomic ion in a compound is written individually in order to illustrate the separate groupings. For example, the compound [[dichlorine hexoxide]] has an empirical formula {{chem|Cl|O|3}}, and molecular formula {{chem|Cl|2|O|6}}, but in liquid or solid forms, this compound is more correctly shown by an ionic condensed formula {{chem|[ClO|2|]|+|[ClO|4|]|-}}, which illustrates that this compound consists of {{chem|[ClO|2|]|+}} ions and {{chem|[ClO|4|]|-}} ions. In such cases, the condensed formula only need be complex enough to show at least one of each ionic species.

Chemical formulas as described here are distinct from the far more complex chemical systematic names that are used in various systems of [[chemical nomenclature]]. For example, one systematic name for glucose is (2''R'',3''S'',4''R'',5''R'')-2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanal. This name, interpreted by the rules behind it, fully specifies glucose's structural formula, but the name is not a chemical formula as usually understood, and uses terms and words not used in chemical formulas. Such names, unlike basic formulas, may be able to represent full structural formulas without graphs.

== Empirical formula ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Acetic acid]] --&gt;
{{anchor|1=Empirical formulas}}
{{main|Empirical formula}}
In [[chemistry]], the [[empirical formula]] of a chemical is a simple expression of the relative number of each type of atom or ratio of the elements in the compound. Empirical formulas are the standard for [[ionic compound]]s, such as {{chem|CaCl|2}}, and for macromolecules, such as {{chem|SiO|2}}. An empirical formula makes no reference to [[isomer]]ism, structure, or absolute number of atoms. The term ''empirical'' refers to the process of [[elemental analysis]], a technique of [[analytical chemistry]] used to determine the relative percent composition of a pure chemical substance by element.

For example, [[hexane]] has a molecular formula of {{chem|C|6|H|14}}, or structurally {{chem|CH|3|CH|2|CH|2|CH|2|CH|2|CH|3}}, implying that it has a chain structure of 6 [[carbon]] atoms, and 14 [[hydrogen]] atoms. However, the empirical formula for hexane is {{chem|C|3|H|7}}. Likewise the empirical formula for [[hydrogen peroxide]], {{chem|H|2|O|2}}, is simply HO expressing the 1:1 ratio of component elements. [[Formaldehyde]] and [[acetic acid]] have the same empirical formula, {{chem|CH|2|O}}. This is the actual chemical formula for formaldehyde, but acetic acid has double the number of atoms.

== Molecular formula ==
Molecular formulas indicate the simple numbers of each type of atom in a molecule of a molecular substance. They are the same as empirical formulas for molecules that only have one atom of a particular type, but otherwise may have larger numbers. An example of the difference is the empirical formula for glucose, which is CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (''ratio'' 1:2:1), while its molecular formula is C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (''number of atoms'' 6:12:6). For water, both formulas are H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. A molecular formula provides more information about a molecule than its empirical formula, but is more difficult to establish.

A molecular formula shows the number of elements in a molecule, and determines whether it is a [[binary compound]], [[ternary compound]], [[quaternary compound]], or has even more elements.

== Condensed formula ==
{{Main|Condensed formula}}
[[File:Isobutane_numbered_2D.svg|thumb|right|150px|[[Isobutane]] structural formula&lt;br /&gt;Molecular formula: C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Condensed or semi-structural chemical formula: (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH]]

{{Image frame|content=&lt;chem&gt;H-\overset{\displaystyle H \atop |}{\underset{| \atop \displaystyle H}{C}}-\overset{\displaystyle H \atop |}{\underset{| \atop \displaystyle H}{C}}-\overset{\displaystyle H \atop |}{\underset{| \atop \displaystyle H}{C}}-\overset{\displaystyle H \atop |}{\underset{| \atop \displaystyle H}{C}}-H&lt;/chem&gt;|align=right|width=155|caption=''n''-[[Butane]] structural formula&lt;br /&gt;Molecular formula: C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Condensed or semi-structural formula: CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}

The [[connectivity (graph theory)|connectivity]] of a molecule often has a strong influence on its physical and chemical properties and behavior. Two molecules composed of the same numbers of the same types of atoms (i.e. a pair of [[isomer]]s) might have completely different chemical and/or physical properties if the atoms are connected differently or in different positions. In such cases, a [[structural formula]] is useful, as it illustrates which atoms are bonded to which other ones. From the connectivity, it is often possible to deduce the approximate [[molecular geometry|shape of the molecule]].

A condensed chemical formula may represent the types and spatial arrangement of [[Chemical bond|bonds]] in a simple chemical substance, though it does not necessarily specify [[isomer]]s or complex structures. For example, [[ethane]] consists of two carbon atoms single-bonded to each other, with each carbon atom having three hydrogen atoms bonded to it. Its chemical formula can be rendered as CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. In [[ethylene]] there is a double bond between the carbon atoms (and thus each carbon only has two hydrogens), therefore the chemical formula may be written: CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and the fact that there is a double bond between the carbons is implicit because carbon has a valence of four. However, a more explicit method is to write H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or less commonly H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C'''::'''CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The two lines (or two pairs of dots) indicate that a [[double bond]] connects the atoms on either side of them.

A [[triple bond]] may be expressed with three lines (HC≡CH) or three pairs of dots (HC:::CH), and if there may be ambiguity, a single line or pair of dots may be used to indicate a single bond.

Molecules with multiple [[functional group]]s that are the same may be expressed by enclosing the repeated group in [[parenthesis|round brackets]]. For example, [[isobutane]] may be written (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH. This condensed structural formula implies a different connectivity from other molecules that can be formed using the same atoms in the same proportions (isomers). The formula (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH implies a central carbon atom connected to one hydrogen atom and three [[methyl group|CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; groups]]. The same number of atoms of each element (10 hydrogens and 4 carbons, or C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;) may be used to make a straight chain molecule, ''n''-[[butane]]: CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

== Law of composition == 
In any given chemical compound, the elements always combine in the same proportion with each other. This is the [[law of constant composition]].

The law of constant composition says that, in any particular chemical compound, all samples of that compound will be made up of the same elements in the same proportion or ratio. For example, any water molecule is always made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom in a 2:1 ratio. If we look at the relative masses of oxygen and hydrogen in a water molecule, we see that 94% of the mass of a water molecule is accounted for by oxygen and the remaining 6% is the mass of hydrogen. This mass proportion will be the same for any water molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Law of Constant Composition|url=http://www.everythingmaths.co.za/science/grade-10/13-physical-and-chemical-change/13-physical-and-chemical-change-03.cnxmlplus|website=Everything Math and Science|publisher=SIYAVULA|accessdate=31 March 2016}} [[File:CC-BY-SA icon.svg|50px]] This material is available under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chemical names in answer to limitations of chemical formulas ===&lt;!-- what why here??? --&gt;
{{main|Chemical nomenclature}}
The alkene called '''but-2-ene''' has two isomers, which the chemical formula CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH=CHCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; does not identify. The relative position of the two methyl groups must be indicated by additional notation denoting whether the methyl groups are on the same side of the double bond (''cis'' or ''Z'') or on the opposite sides from each other (''trans'' or ''E''). Such extra symbols violate the rules for chemical formulas, and begin to enter the territory of more complex naming systems.{{Cn|reason=Sounds like opinion. Cite?|date=July 2018}}

As noted above, in order to represent the full structural formulas of many complex organic and inorganic compounds, [[chemical nomenclature]] may be needed which goes well beyond the available resources used above in simple condensed formulas.  See [[IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry]] and [[IUPAC nomenclature of inorganic chemistry 2005]] for examples. In addition, linear naming systems such as [[International Chemical Identifier]] (InChI) allow a computer to construct a structural formula, and [[simplified molecular-input line-entry system]] (SMILES) allows a more human-readable ASCII input. However, all these nomenclature systems go beyond the standards of chemical formulas, and technically are chemical naming systems, not formula systems.{{Cn|reason=Sounds like opinion. Cite?|date=July 2018}}

=== Polymers in condensed formulas ===

For [[polymer]]s in condensed chemical formulas, parentheses are placed around the repeating unit. For example, a [[hydrocarbon]] molecule that is described as CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is a molecule with fifty repeating units. If the number of repeating units is unknown or variable, the letter ''n'' may be used to indicate this formula: CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

=== Ions in condensed formulas ===
For [[ion]]s, the charge on a particular atom may be denoted with a right-hand superscript. For example, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, or Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. The total charge on a charged molecule or a [[polyatomic ion]] may also be shown in this way. For example: [[Hydronium|H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] or [[Sulfate|SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;]].  Note that + and - are used in place of +1 and -1, respectively.

For more complex ions, brackets [ ] are often used to enclose the ionic formula, as in [B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;, which is found in compounds such as [[Caesium dodecaborate|Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]]]. Parentheses ( ) can be nested inside brackets to indicate a repeating unit, as in [[Hexamminecobalt(III)_chloride|[Co(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]]. Here, (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; indicates that the ion contains six [[ammine|NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; groups]] bonded to [[cobalt]], and [ ] encloses the entire formula of the ion with charge +3. {{Elucidate|date=November 2012}}

This is strictly optional; a chemical formula is valid with or without ionization information, and Hexamminecobalt(III) chloride may be written as [Co(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; or [Co(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]Cl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.  Brackets, like parentheses, behave in chemistry as they do in mathematics, grouping terms together{{snd}} they are not specifically employed only for ionization states.  In the latter case here, the parentheses indicate 6 groups all of the same shape, bonded to another group of size 1 (the cobalt atom), and then the entire bundle, as a group, is bonded to 3 chlorine atoms.  In the former case, it is clearer that the bond connecting the chlorines is [[ionic bonding|ionic]], rather than [[covalent bond|covalent]].

== Isotopes ==

Although [[isotope]]s are more relevant to [[nuclear chemistry]] or [[stable isotope]] chemistry than to conventional chemistry, different isotopes may be indicated with a prefixed [[superscript]] in a chemical formula. For example, the phosphate ion containing radioactive phosphorus-32 is &amp;#91;&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;#93;&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;. Also a study involving stable isotope ratios might include the molecule &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O.

A left-hand subscript is sometimes used redundantly to indicate the [[atomic number]]. For example, &lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for dioxygen, and {{ComplexNuclide2|O|16|q=2}}  for the most abundant isotopic species of dioxygen. This is convenient when writing equations for [[nuclear reaction]]s, in order to show the balance of charge more clearly.

== Trapped atoms ==
[[File:Endohedral fullerene.png|thumb|180px|Traditional formula: MC&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br&gt;The "@" notation: M@C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]]
{{main|Endohedral fullerene}}
The @ symbol ([[at sign]]) indicates an atom or molecule trapped inside a cage but not chemically bound to it. For example, a [[buckminsterfullerene]] (C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;) with an atom (M) would simply be represented as MC&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; regardless of whether M was inside the fullerene without chemical bonding or outside, bound to one of the carbon atoms. Using the @ symbol, this would be denoted M@C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; if M was inside the carbon network. A non-fullerene example is [As@Ni&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;As&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;, an ion in which one As atom is trapped in a cage formed by the other 32 atoms.

This notation was proposed in 1991&lt;ref name=YanChai&gt;{{cite journal |title=Fullerenes wlth Metals Inside |author1=Chai, Yan |author2=Guo, Ting |author3=Jin, Changming |author4=Haufler, Robert E. |author5=Chibante, L. P. Felipe |author6=Fure, Jan |author7=Wang, Lihong |author8=Alford, J. Michael |author9=Smalley, Richard E. |journal=Journal of Physical Chemistry |volume=95 |issue=20 |year=1991 |pages=7564–7568 |doi=10.1021/j100173a002}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the discovery of [[fullerene]] cages ([[endohedral fullerene]]s), which can trap atoms such as [[Lanthanum|La]] to form, for example, La@C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; or La@C&lt;sub&gt;82&lt;/sub&gt;. The choice of the symbol has been explained by the authors as being concise, readily printed and transmitted electronically (the at sign is included in [[ASCII]], which most modern character encoding schemes are based on), and the visual aspects suggesting the structure of an endohedral fullerene.

== Non-stoichiometric chemical formulas ==

{{Main|Non-stoichiometric compound}}

Chemical formulas most often use [[integer]]s for each element. However, there is a class of compounds, called [[non-stoichiometric compound]]s, that cannot be represented by small integers. Such a formula might be written using [[decimal fraction]]s, as in Fe&lt;sub&gt;0.95&lt;/sub&gt;O, or it might include a variable part represented by a letter, as in Fe&lt;sub&gt;1–x&lt;/sub&gt;O, where x is normally much less than 1.

== General forms for organic compounds ==
A chemical formula used for a series of compounds that differ from each other by a constant unit is called a ''general formula''. It generates a [[homologous series]] of chemical formulas. For example, [[alcohols]] may be represented by the formula C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;(2n + 1)&lt;/sub&gt;OH  (''n'' ≥  1), giving the homologs [[methanol]], [[ethanol]], [[propanol]] for ''n''=1–3.

== Hill system ==
The '''Hill system''' (or Hill notation) is a system of writing empirical chemical formulas, molecular chemical formulas and components of a condensed formula such that the number of [[carbon]] [[atom]]s in a [[molecule]] is indicated first, the number of [[hydrogen]] atoms next, and then the number of all other [[chemical element]]s subsequently, in [[alphabetical order]] of the [[chemical symbols]]. When the formula contains no carbon,  all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

By sorting formulas according to the number of atoms of each element present in the formula according to these rules, with differences in earlier elements or numbers being treated as more significant than differences in any later element or number&amp;mdash;like sorting text strings into [[lexicographical order]]&amp;mdash;it is possible to [[collation|collate]] chemical formulas into what is known as Hill system order.

The Hill system was first published by [[Edwin A. Hill]] of the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Edwin A. Hill | title = On a system of indexing chemical literature; Adopted by the Classification Division of the U.S. Patent Office | journal = [[J. Am. Chem. Soc.]] | year = 1900 | volume = 22 | issue = 8 | pages = 478–494 | doi = 10.1021/ja02046a005}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the most commonly used system in chemical databases and printed indexes to sort lists of compounds.&lt;ref name="wiggins"&gt;Wiggins, Gary. (1991). ''Chemical Information Sources.'' New York: McGraw Hill. p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

A list of formulas in Hill system order is arranged alphabetically, as above, with single-letter elements coming before two-letter symbols when the symbols begin with the same letter (so "B" comes before "Be", which comes before "Br").&lt;ref name="wiggins"/&gt;

The following example formulae are written using the Hill system, and listed in Hill order:

* BrI
* CCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
* CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;I
* C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Br
* H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8637">'''Co-processing''' is the use of [[waste]] as raw material, or as a source of energy, or both to replace natural mineral resources (material recycling) and fossil fuels such as coal, petroleum and gas ([[energy recovery]]) in industrial processes, mainly in energy intensive industries (EII) such as [[cement]], [[Lime mortar|lime]], [[steel]], [[glass]], and [[power generation]]. Waste materials used for Co-processing are referred to as alternative fuels and raw materials (AFR).

==Concept of Co-processing==
Co-processing is a proven [[sustainable development]] concept that reduces demands on natural resources, reduces pollution and landfill space, thus contributing to reducing the [[environmental footprint]]. Co-processing is also based on the principles of [[industrial ecology]], which considers the best features of the flow of information, materials, and energy of biological ecosystems, with the aim of improving the exchange of these essential resources in the industrial world.

[[image:Types of Co-processing.gif]]

Figure 1: Types of Co-processing

In summary, the benefits of Co-processing are:
* to conserve natural (non-renewable) resources of energy and materials,
* to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in order to slow global warming and demonstrate a positive impact on integrated environmental indicators, such as the [[ecological footprint]],
* to reduce the environmental impacts of the extraction (mining or quarrying), transporting, and processing of raw materials,
* to reduce dependence on primary resource markets,
* to save landfill space and reduce the pollution caused by the disposal of waste, and
* to destroy waste completely eliminating potential future liabilities.

Co-processing contributes to the industrial competitiveness, is a complementary technology to concepts such as [[cleaner production]] or [[recycling]] and should be considered as a treatment alternative within an integrated waste management concept. Some EII offer co-processing as a sustainable waste management service. It is usually more cost effective to adapt existing facilities of EII than building new waste treatment capacities thereby reducing waste management cost to society.

The waste management hierarchy (see figure below) shows that Co-processing is a recovery activity which should be considered after waste prevention and recycling; Co-processing ranks higher in this hierarchy in comparison to disposal activities such as landfilling or incineration.

[[image:Waste hierarchy.gif]]

Figure 2: Waste Management Hierarchy

==Potential of Co-processing==

The global industrial demand for energy is roughly 45% of the total demand and the requirements of the energy intensive industries (EII) are more than half of the total industrial demand, at 27%.

Worldwide, wastes suitable for Co-processing have an energy potential equivalent to nearly 20% of the fossil fuel energy used by the EII and coal-fired power plants. By 2030, the thermal substitution rate of waste could rise to nearly 30%. In the [[EU-25]]  countries of Europe, the available energy potential in waste currently represents nearly 40% of this demand, and this is expected to rise to almost 50% by 2030.

The EU cement industry already uses more than 40% fuels derived from waste and biomass in supplying the thermal energy to the grey clinker making process. Although the choice for this so-called alternative fuels (AF) is typically cost driven, other factors are becoming more important. Use of AF provides benefits for both society and the company: CO2-emissions are lower than with fossil fuels, waste can be co-processed in an efficient and sustainable manner and the demand for certain virgin materials can be reduced. Yet there are large differences in the share of AF used between the European Union (EU) member states. Clearly, the societal benefits can be enlarged if more member states increase their AF share. In this study Ecofys assess the barriers and opportunities for further uptake of AF in 14 EU member states. Ecofys found that local factors constrain the market potential to a much larger extent than the technical and economic feasibility of the cement industry itself. In this summary they present the overall findings. The detailed assessments are available in separate cases studies.[https://cembureau.eu/media/1618/full-report-_-2017-05-11_ecofys_publication_alternativefuels_report.pdf Source]

Roughly 60% of the waste that could be used for Co-processing is biomass and therefore [[carbon neutral]]. In this way Co-processing offers a significant potential for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels. Furthermore, diverting industrial waste streams from landfills and incinerators without energy recovery contributes to reducing overall CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions when used to substitute fossil fuels through Co-processing (as illustrated in the figure below).

[[image:Reduction of Emissions through Co-Processing.gif]]

Figure 3: Reduction of Emissions through Co-processing

Other factors that must be considered when Co-processing waste include product quality standards, permitting aspects, and transparent communication in order to gain public acceptance.

==Coprocessing in Pharmaceutical Excipients Development==
Coprocessing is the combination of two or more excipients to form materials (coprocessed excipients) of superior functionality and limited unwanted effects. Co-processing is a tool that is employed by pharmaceutical excipients manufacturers and formulation scientists to develop materials with superior performance. Coprocessing is fundamentally based on particle engineering that allows modification of Critical Material Attributes (CMA) of the primary excipients. These modifications are reflected in the resulting coprocessed material as enhanced functionality. The primary excipients are established pharmacopoeial materials.

'''Composite video''' is an [[Video#Analog video|analog video]] transmission that carries [[Standard-definition television|standard definition]] video typically at [[480i]] or [[576i]] [[Display resolution|resolution]] as a single channel. Video information is [[Video coding format|encoded]] on one [[Communication channel|channel]], unlike the higher-quality [[S-video]] (two channels) and the even higher-quality [[component video]] (three or more channels). In all of these video formats, audio is carried on a separate connection. 

Composite video is also known by the initials '''CVBS''' for composite video baseband signal or color, video, blanking and sync,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/app-notes/index.mvp/id/734 |title=Video Basics |publisher=[[Maxim Integrated]] |access-date=2018-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lifewire.com/composite-video-the-basics-1846869 |title=Composite Video - The Basics |author=Robert Silva |date=November 8, 2017 |publisher=[[Lifewire]] |access-date=2018-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; or is simply referred to as ''SD video'' for the [[standard-definition television]] signal it conveys.

There are three dominant variants of composite video:  [[NTSC]], [[PAL]], and [[SECAM]].

== Signal components ==

[[File:Composite Video.svg|300px|thumb|right]]

A composite video signal combines, on one wire, the video information required to recreate a color picture, as well as line and [[frame synchronization]] pulses. The color video signal is a linear combination of the ''[[luminance]]'' of the picture and a [[modulation|modulated]] subcarrier which carries the ''[[chrominance]]'' or color information, a combination of [[hue]] and [[Colorfulness|saturation]]. Details of the combining process vary between the [[NTSC]], [[PAL]] and [[SECAM]] systems.&lt;!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]--&gt;

The [[Spectral density#Explanation|frequency spectrum]] of the modulated color signal overlaps that of the baseband signal, and separation relies on the fact that frequency components of the baseband signal tend to be near [[harmonics]] of the horizontal scanning rate, while the color carrier is selected to be an odd multiple of half the horizontal scanning rate; this produces a modulated color signal that consists mainly of harmonic frequencies that fall between the harmonics in the baseband [[Luma (video)|luma]] signal, rather than both being in separate continuous frequency bands alongside each other in the frequency domain. In other words, the combination of luma and [[Chrominance|chroma]] is indeed a frequency-division technique, but it is much more complex than typical [[frequency-division multiplexing]] systems like the one used to multiplex analog radio stations on both the AM and FM bands.

A gated and filtered signal derived from the color [[subcarrier]], called the burst or [[colorburst]], is added to the [[horizontal blanking interval]] of each line, excluding the [[Analog television#Vertical synchronization|vertical sync]] interval, as a synchronizing signal and amplitude reference for the [[chrominance]] signals. The burst signal is inverted in phase (180° out of phase) from the reference [[subcarrier]].&lt;ref name="SMPTE 170M-2004"&gt;{{cite book|title=SMPTE STANDARD for Television - Composite Analog Video Signal - NTSC for Studio Applications|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Signal modulation ==
Composite video can easily be directed to any broadcast channel simply by modulating the proper RF [[carrier wave]] with it. Most home [[analog video]] equipment record a signal in (roughly) composite format: [[LaserDisc]]s store a true composite signal, while consumer videotape formats (including [[VHS]] and [[Betamax]]) and lesser commercial and industrial tape formats (including [[U-Matic]]) use modified composite signals (generally known as ''color-under'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Patent 4323915|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=4323915.PN.&amp;OS=PN/4323915&amp;RS=PN/4323915|publisher=US Patent and Trademark Office|accessdate=12 May 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220125824/http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=4323915.PN.&amp;OS=PN%2F4323915&amp;RS=PN%2F4323915|archivedate=20 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On playback, these devices often give the user the option to output the baseband signal or to modulate it onto a [[very high frequency|VHF]] or [[ultra high frequency|UHF]] frequency compatible with a [[Tuner (radio)#Television|TV tuner]] (i.e., appearing on a selected TV channel). The professional [[television production]] [[video compression|uncompressed]] [[digital video]] [[Videocassette#Cassette formats|videocassette]] format known as [[D-2 (video)|D-2]] directly [[digital recording|records]] and reproduces standard [[NTSC]] composite video signals, using PCM encoding of the [[analog signal]] on the [[magnetic tape]].

== Standard connectors ==
In home applications, the composite video signal is typically connected using an [[RCA connector]] (phono plug), normally yellow. It is often accompanied with red and white (or black) connectors for right and left audio channels respectively. [[BNC connector]]s and higher quality [[coaxial cable]] are often used in professional [[television studio]]s and [[post-production]] applications. BNC connectors were also used for composite video connections on early home [[VCR]]s, often accompanied by either [[RCA connector|phono connectors]] or a 5-pin [[DIN connector]] for audio. The BNC connector, in turn post dated the [[UHF connector|PL-259]] connector which featured on first generation VCRs.

In Europe, [[SCART]] connections are often used instead of RCA jacks (and to a lesser extent, [[S-Video]]), so where available, [[component video|RGB]] is used instead of composite video with computers, video game consoles, and [[DVD]] players.

Video cables are 75 ohm impedance, low in capacitance. Typical values run from 52&amp;nbsp;pF/m for an [[HDPE]]-foamed dielectric precision video cable to 69&amp;nbsp;pF/m for a solid PE dielectric cable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bluejeanscable.com/store/subwoofer/LC1-design-notes.htm |title=LC-1 Audio Cable Design Notes |publisher=Blue Jeans Cable |date= |accessdate=2012-01-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128085452/http://www.bluejeanscable.com/store/subwoofer/LC1-design-notes.htm |archivedate=2011-11-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modulators ==
Some devices that connect to a TV, such as VCRs, older [[video game console]]s and [[home computer]]s of the 1980s, output a composite signal. This may then be converted to RF with an external box known as an [[RF modulator]] that generates the proper carrier (often for channel 3 or 4 in [[North America]], channel 36 in [[Europe]]). Sometimes this modulator was built into the product (such as video game consoles, VCRs, or the [[Atari]], [[Commodore 64]], or [[TRS-80 Color Computer|TRS-80 CoCo]] home-computers) and sometimes it was an external unit powered by the computer (in the case of the [[Texas Instruments TI-99/4A|TI-99/4A]] or some [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] modulators) or with an independent power supply. In the United States, using an external RF modulator frees the manufacturer from obtaining FCC approval for each variation of a device. Through the early 1980s, electronics that output a television channel signal were required to meet the same shielding requirements as broadcast television equipment, thus forcing manufacturers such as Apple to omit an RF modulator, and [[Texas Instruments]] to have their RF modulator as an external unit, which they had certified by the FCC without mentioning they were planning to sell it with a computer. In Europe, while most countries used the same broadcast standard, there were different modulation standards (PAL-G versus PAL-I, for example), and using an external modulator allowed manufacturers to make a single product and easily sell it to different countries by changing the modulator. Video game consoles on the other hand were less of an issue with FCC approval because the circuitry was inexpensive enough to allow for channel 3/4 outputs.

Modern day devices with analog outputs have typically omitted channel 3 and 4 outputs in favor of composite and S-video outputs (or have switched to using HDMI or other digital formats) as composite and S-video have become more common as inputs for TVs. In addition, many TV sets sold these days no longer have analog television tuners and cannot accept channel 3/4. But because composite video has a well-established market for both devices that convert it to [[channel 3/4 output]]s, as well as devices that convert things like [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] to composite, it has offered opportunities to [[repurposing|repurpose]] older [[composite monitor]]s for newer devices.

== Demodulation loss ==
The process of modulating RF with the original video signal, and then demodulating the original signal again in the TV, introduces several losses. This conversion also typically adds noise or interference to the signal as well. For these reasons, it is typically best to use composite connections instead of RF connections if possible. Almost all modern video equipment has at least composite connectors, so this typically is not a problem; however, older video equipment and some very low-end modern televisions have only RF input (essentially the antenna jack); while RF modulators are no longer common, they are still available to translate baseband signals for older equipment.

However, just as the modulation and demodulation of RF loses quality, the mixing of the various signals into the original composite signal does the same, causing a checkerboard video artifact known as [[dot crawl]]. Dot crawl is a defect that results from crosstalk due to the intermodulation of the chrominance and luminance components of the signal. This is usually seen when chrominance is transmitted with a high bandwidth, and its spectrum reaches into the band of the luminance frequencies. This has led to a proliferation of systems such as [[S-Video]] and [[component video]] to maintain the signals separately. [[Comb filter]]s are also commonly used to separate signals, and eliminate artifacts, from composite sources.

[[File:Elwro_800_Junior_jednostka_centralna_tyl.jpg|thumb|right|Rear of [[Poland|Polish]] computer Elwro 800 Junior. DIN output called "MONITOR" is just a Composite Video (no color info, only black and white), Sound (mono) and Ground output in that form. Despite computer being designed (and mainly made of Eastern components) on East side of the [[Iron curtain]] it can be connected to modern equipment like VGA-Composite video adapters or monitors with Composite Video input, for example using a popular and simple chinch-DIN cable.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oldcomputer.info/8bit/elwro800/index.htm|title=Elwro 800 Junior - MCbx|author=|date=|website=oldcomputer.info|accessdate=5 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318162308/http://oldcomputer.info/8bit/elwro800/index.htm|archivedate=18 March 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
== Aspect ratio in composite signal ==
When used for connecting a video source to a video display that supports both 4:3 and 16:9 display formats, the PAL and NTSC television standards provide for signaling pulses that will automatically switch the display from one format to the other. This is called [[Widescreen signaling|widescreen signalling]] (WSS).

== Extensions to the composite video standard ==
Since TV screens hide the [[vertical blanking interval]] of a composite video signal and even [[overscan|crop the edges of the picture]], extensions have been implemented by taking advantage of these unseen parts of the signal. Examples of these extensions include [[teletext]], [[closed captioning]], digital information regarding the show title, transmitting a set of reference colors that allows TV sets to automatically correct the hue maladjustments common with the NTSC color encoding system, etc.

Other extensions to the standard include [[S-video]]; S-video is an extension to the standard because it uses parallel signal paths for [[luminance]] and for [[chrominance]] (color), of which both of them can be connected to a composite video input but with either monochrome ([[Luma (video)|luma]]), or uniform-luma color (chroma) unless merging the signal paths with a filter was done.

A '''courtesy title''' is a form of address in systems of [[nobility]] used for children, former wives and other close relatives of a [[peerage (disambiguation)|peer]], as well as  certain officials such as some judges and members of the Scottish [[Landed gentry|gentry]]. These [[style (manner of address)|styles]] are used 'by courtesy' in the sense that the relatives, officials and others  do not themselves hold [[substantive title]]s.  There are several different kinds of courtesy titles in the [[British peerage]].

==Children of peers==

=== Courtesy titles===
[[File:George Percy, Early Percy.jpg|thumb|The son of the current [[Ralph Percy, 12th Duke of Northumberland|Duke of Northumberland]] is addressed by the courtesy title of [[George Percy, Earl Percy|Earl Percy]]]]
If a peer of one of the top three ranks (a [[duke]], [[marquess]] or [[earl]]) has more than one title, his eldest son - himself not a peer - may use one of his father's lesser titles "by courtesy".  However, the father continues to be the substantive holder of the peerage title and the son using the title by courtesy legally subordinate unless issued a [[writ of acceleration]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} If the eldest son of a duke or marquess has an eldest son, he may use a still lower title, if one exists.

For example, the [[Duke of Norfolk]] is also [[Earl of Arundel]] and [[Baron Maltravers]].  His eldest son is therefore styled "Earl of Arundel" (without the definite article "The" which indicates a substantive title). Lord Arundel's eldest son (should he have one during his father's lifetime) would be styled "Lord Maltravers".  However, only The Duke of Norfolk is actually a peer; his son Lord Arundel and his hypothetical grandson Lord Maltravers are not.

Courtesy titles are only used by the peer's eldest living son, and the eldest son's eldest living son, and so forth. Other descendants are not permitted to use the peer's [[subsidiary title]]s. Only the [[heir apparent]] (and heir apparent to the heir apparent, and so on) may use them. An [[heir presumptive]] (e.g., a brother, nephew, or cousin) does not use a courtesy title. However, Scottish practice allows the style ''[[Master (Peerage of Scotland)|Master/Mistress]] of X'' to an heir presumptive as well as to an heir apparent; for example, the brother of the present [[Marquess of Tweeddale]] has the title ''Master of Tweeddale''.

Wives are entitled to use the feminine form of their husbands' courtesy titles. Thus, the wife of an Earl of Arundel would be styled "Countess of Arundel" (again, without the article).

Holders of courtesy titles do not, at the [[Court of St James's]], have their title preceded by the definite article "The" (which is always written with the capital letter "T"): e.g., 'Earl of Arundel' rather than 'The Earl of Arundel'.

===Choosing a courtesy peer's title===
The actual courtesy title which is used is a matter of family tradition. For instance, the eldest son of [[Duke of Buccleuch and Queensberry|The Duke of Buccleuch and Queensberry]] is styled "[[Earl of Dalkeith]]", even though the duke is also the [[Marquess of Dumfriesshire]], a title which outranks the earldom.  Similarly, the eldest son of [[Marquess of Londonderry|The Marquess of Londonderry]] is styled "[[Viscount Castlereagh]]", even though the marquess is also the [[Earl Vane]].

Titles with the same name as a peer's main title are also not used as courtesy titles. For instance, [[Duke of Westminster|The Duke of Westminster]] is also [[Marquess of Westminster|The Marquess of Westminster]] and [[Earl Grosvenor|The Earl Grosvenor]] (amongst other titles). The duke's eldest son is not styled "Marquess of Westminster" (which would cause confusion between the son and the father), and so is styled "Earl Grosvenor" instead. The title used does not have to be exactly equivalent to the actual peerage: the eldest son of the current [[Duke of Wellington (title)|Duke of Wellington]] is styled [[Marquess of Douro|Marquess ''of'' Douro]], although the actual peerage possessed by his father is Marquess Douro (not ''of'' Douro).{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

If a peer of the rank of earl or above does not have any subsidiary titles of a name different from his main title, his eldest son usually uses an invented courtesy title of "Lord [Surname]". For instance, the eldest son of [[Earl of Devon|The Earl of Devon]] is styled "[[Lord Courtenay]]", even though the Earl has no [[baron|barony]] of that name, and similarly the eldest son of [[Earl of Guilford|The Earl of Guilford]] is styled "[[Lord North]]". The eldest son of [[Earl of Huntingdon|The Earl of Huntingdon]], who has no subsidiary titles, is styled "[[Viscount Hastings]]" to avoid confusion with the substantive peer [[Lord Hastings|The Lord Hastings]]. [[Earl Castle Stewart|The Earl Castle Stewart]]'s heir uses the style ''Viscount Stewart'' in order to avoid confusion with Lord Stewart, the eldest son of Viscount Castlereagh (the eldest son of [[Marquess of Londonderry|The Marquess of Londonderry]]).

=== Courtesy prefix of "Lord"===
Another form of courtesy title is the [[honorific]] prefix of "Lord" before the name. This non-peerage title is accorded to younger sons of dukes and marquesses. The courtesy title is added before the person's [[given name]] and [[surname]], as in the example of [[Lord Randolph Churchill]], although conversational usage drops the surname on secondary reference. The title persists after the death of the holder's father, but is not inherited by any of his children. The wife of the holder is entitled to the feminine form of her husband's title, which takes the form of "Lady", followed by her husband's [[given name]] and [[surname]], as in the example of [[Lady Randolph Churchill]]. The holder is addressed as "Lord Randolph" and his wife as "Lady Randolph".

=== Courtesy prefix of "Lady"===
The [[honorific]] prefix of "Lady" is used for the daughters of dukes, marquesses and earls. The courtesy title is added before the person's given name, as in the example [[Lady Diana Spencer]]. Because it is merely a courtesy with no legal implications, the honorific persists after the death of the holder's father but it is not inherited by her children.

The spouse of a woman with an honorific title does not hold any courtesy title in right of their spouse. Neither does the husband of a man with ''any'' title (including the husband of a peer).

=== Courtesy prefix of "The Honourable" ===
The younger sons of earls, along with all sons and daughters of viscounts, barons and lords of parliament are accorded the courtesy style of "[[The Honourable]]" before their name. This is usually abbreviated to "The Hon."  The title persists after the death of the holder's father, but it may not be inherited by the holder's children. It is used only in [[grammatical person|third person]] reference, not in speaking to the person.

===Married daughters===
The daughter of a duke, marquess, or earl who marries an untitled man becomes "Lady [''Given name''] [''Husband's surname'']".  The daughter of a viscount or baron who marries a commoner is styled "The Honourable [''Given name''] [''Husband's surname'']" (the given name is dropped and ''Mrs'' is substituted if the husband's right to the style derives from office or appointment rather than from ancestral peerage).

Any woman who marries a peer uses the feminine version of his peerage title, even if her own precedence is higher than his, as in the case of a duke's daughter marrying a baron, because a peerage is a substantive title, the usage of which is preferred to any courtesy style - unless she marries into the Royal Family. If a woman marries the younger son of a duke or marquess, she becomes "Lady [''Husband's given name''] [''Husband's surname'']." If she marries the younger son of an earl, viscount or baron, she becomes "The Hon. Mrs [''Husband's given name''] [''Husband's surname'']."

In case of a divorce, she may keep the same style as during marriage or she may choose to assume the style "Mrs [''Given name''] [''Husband's surname'']." Regardless of what she chooses, she loses all precedence acquired from marriage and because of the former option, there can be multiple ''Lady John Smiths''.

===Adoption===
Until 2004, children who had been adopted by peers had no right to any courtesy title. Pursuant to a Royal Warrant dated 30 April 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=57306 |page=6821 |date=2 June 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; these children are now automatically entitled to the same styles and courtesy titles as their siblings.  However, unlike biological children, they cannot inherit peerages from their parent&lt;ref&gt;See: Adoption Act 1976, section 44(1) and Adoption and Children Act 2002, chapter 4, section 71(1). "An adoption does not affect the descent of any peerage or dignity or title of honour."&lt;/ref&gt; (and thus, since they cannot be heirs, if a peer adopts a son and he is the oldest son, he would use the styles of younger sons). For example, actress [[Nimmy March]], the daughter of The Duke and Duchess of Richmond, was immediately elevated to Lady Naomi Gordon-Lennox on 30 April 2004.

Note that Scottish peerages' rules for courtesy titles and styles differ.

==Indirect inheritance==
Occasionally a peer succeeds to a peerage upon the death of a relative who is not one of his or her parents. When this happens, the relatives of the new peer may be allowed to use the courtesy titles or styles which would have been accorded them if the new peer had succeeded a parent or grandparent in the title.

For instance, [[Rupert Ponsonby, 7th Baron de Mauley]], succeeded his uncle in 2002. His brother Ashley had no title, as their father was only the younger son of a peer and was never actually Baron de Mauley. However, in 2003, Ashley was granted, by [[Warrant of Precedence]] from [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]], the style and precedence that would have been his had his father survived to inherit the barony, becoming ''The Honourable Ashley Ponsonby''. Precedence in such circumstances is usually granted but is not automatic.

== Spouses of peers ==
The wife of a substantive peer is legally entitled to the privileges of peerage: she is said to have a "life estate" in her husband's dignity. Thus a duke's wife is titled a "[[duchess]]", a marquess's wife a "[[marchioness]]", an earl's wife a "[[countess]]", a viscount's wife a "[[viscountess]]" and a baron's wife a "[[baron]]ess". Despite being referred to as a "peeress", she is not a peer in her own right: this is a 'style' and not a substantive title. However, this is considered a legal title, unlike the social titles of a peer's children.

The wives of eldest sons of peers hold their titles on the same basis as their husbands, i.e. by courtesy. Thus the wife of the Marquess of Douro is known as the "Marchioness of Douro".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bloomsbury Publishing|title=Scottish Clans and Territorial Houses|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=10jOCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=courtesy+title+the+younger++bloomsbury&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Yzj_a06MQb&amp;sig=FYFTl7XYZZvaOrqMgpf6m8kf8ik&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi79dLZ_5_OAhUBxpQKHZ_3DlMQ6AEILjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=courtesy%20title%20the%20younger%20%20bloomsbury&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 August 2016|work=Titles and Forms of Address: A Guide to Correct Use|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing – April 2016|date=2016|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Husbands ===
In the case of a woman who is a substantive peer in her own right, by succession or by first creation (i.e. ennoblement, most commonly in recent times under the [[Life Peerages Act 1958]]), her husband acquires no distinction in right of his wife. Thus, the husband of [[Virginia Bottomley|The Baroness Bottomley of Nettlestone]] has no courtesy title; he was simply called "Mr [[Peter Bottomley]]" until he was knighted and became "Sir Peter Bottomley".

In 2013, there was a [[private member's bill]] in the [[House of Lords]] to allow the spouse of a woman who holds an honour, if he or she enters civil partnership or marriage, to assume the title ''The Honourable''. This bill stalled, and was not passed by the end of the Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2012-13/honoursequalityoftitlesforpartners.html Honours (Equality of Titles for Partners) Bill 2012-13]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2013-14/equalitytitles.html Equality (Titles) Bill [HL&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; 2013-14]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Divorced wives ===
A peeress retains her legal right to the peerage style following divorce and even upon her remarriage to a non-peer.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1901/07/31/117970280.pdf | title=Divorced Peeresses Titles | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=31 July 1901 | accessdate=6 July 2013 | location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; A convention has developed whereby her Christian name is added in front of her title to distinguish her from any subsequent wife of her former husband. Hence, "Her Grace The Duchess of London" becomes "Mary, Duchess of London".  In written forms, she is not entitled to the use of the address "Her Grace..." but may be addressed as "Duchess". "The Rt Hon. The Lady London" becomes "Mary, Lady London" and may be addressed as "Lady London",  or "My Lady".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bloomsbury Publishing|title=Scottish Clans and Territorial Houses|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=10jOCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=courtesy+title+the+younger++bloomsbury&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Yzj_a06MQb&amp;sig=FYFTl7XYZZvaOrqMgpf6m8kf8ik&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi79dLZ_5_OAhUBxpQKHZ_3DlMQ6AEILjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=courtesy%20title%20the%20younger%20%20bloomsbury&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 August 2016|work=Titles and Forms of Address: A Guide to Correct Use|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing – April 2016|date=2016|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 August 1996 [[letters patent]] changed titles of divorced wives of [[British prince]]s, depriving their former wives of the style of [[Royal Highness]]. For this reason ''Her Royal Highness The Princess of Wales'' after divorce became [[Diana, Princess of Wales]]. The same happened to ''Her Royal Highness The Duchess of York'' who became  [[Sarah, Duchess of York]].

=== Widows ===
If a prince or peer dies, his wife's style does not change unless the new peer is a married man (or a woman, if the succession permits); traditionally the widowed peeress puts "[[Dowager]]" in her style, i.e. "The Most Hon. The Marchioness of London" becomes "The Most Hon. The Dowager Marchioness of London."

If a widowed peeress's son predeceases her, her daughter-in-law does not use the title of Dowager, but is styled, e.g. "The Most Hon. Mary, Marchioness of London", until her mother-in-law dies, at which point she may use the title of "Dowager Marchioness". In more recent times, some widows choose to be styled with their Christian names, instead of as Dowager,  e.g. "Olave, Lady Baden-Powell" ("Lady Olave Baden-Powell" would incorrectly imply she was the daughter of a duke, marquess or earl).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bloomsbury Publishing|title=Scottish Clans and Territorial Houses|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=10jOCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=courtesy+title+the+younger++bloomsbury&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Yzj_a06MQb&amp;sig=FYFTl7XYZZvaOrqMgpf6m8kf8ik&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi79dLZ_5_OAhUBxpQKHZ_3DlMQ6AEILjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=courtesy%20title%20the%20younger%20%20bloomsbury&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 August 2016|work=Titles and Forms of Address: A Guide to Correct Use|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing – April 2016|date=2016|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Divorced wives and widows who remarry ===
It used to be customary for women with higher titles from one marriage to retain them even on subsequent remarriage.  As Lord Macnaughten put it in the case of ''Earl Cowley v Countess Cowley'' [1901] AC 450:  ''"...everybody knows that it is a very common practice for peeresses (not being peeresses in their own right) after marrying commoners to retain the title lost by such marriage. It is not a matter of right. It is merely a matter of courtesy, and allowed by the usages of society."'' The divorce court, in the above case, granted the earl an injunction preventing his former wife from using his title; however this was overturned by the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]], whose decision was confirmed by the [[House of Lords]], on the grounds that ordinary courts of law lacked any jurisdiction in matters of honour.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;

The same practice was followed by widows who remarried.  A prominent example was [[Catherine Parr]], the last wife of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], who continued to be known as Queen Catherine even after her marriage to The Lord Seymour of Sudeley (and, indeed, she disputed precedence with the wife of her brother-in-law the Duke of Somerset on this basis). This usage died out later in the twentieth century, and women who remarry now ordinarily take a new married name and do not retain their former title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bloomsbury Publishing|title=Scottish Clans and Territorial Houses|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=10jOCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=courtesy+title+the+younger++bloomsbury&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Yzj_a06MQb&amp;sig=FYFTl7XYZZvaOrqMgpf6m8kf8ik&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi79dLZ_5_OAhUBxpQKHZ_3DlMQ6AEILjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=courtesy%20title%20the%20younger%20%20bloomsbury&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 August 2016|work=Titles and Forms of Address: A Guide to Correct Use|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing – April 2016|date=2016|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Civil partners ===
If a peer or knight enters into a [[Civil partnerships in the United Kingdom|civil partnership]], his or her partner is not entitled to a courtesy title.&lt;ref name="cnnquote"&gt;{{cite web |quote=The Queen herself knighted Sir Elton John, so his new bride would normally be called a lady. Would David Furnish be called Laddie? No chance, says the palace.

==Scottish courtesy titles==
[[Laird]] is a courtesy title  which applies to the owner of  certain long-established [[Scotland|Scottish]] estates; the title being attached to the estate. Traditionally, a laird is formally [[courtesy title|styled]] in the manner evident on the 1730 [[tombstone]] in a Scottish churchyard. It reads:  "[[The Much Honoured]] [''Forename'' (John)] [''Surname'' (Grant)] Laird of [''Lairdship'' (Glenmoriston)]". The section titled ''Scottish Feudal Baronies'' in [[Debrett's]]  states that the use of the prefix "The Much Hon." is "correct", but that "most lairds prefer the unadorned name and [[territorial designation]]".  The wife of a Laird is traditionally accorded the courtesy title of [[Lady]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davis|first1=Graeme|title=How to Trace Your Ancestry From Your Own Computer|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=nTGfBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT68&amp;lpg=PT68&amp;dq=laird+courtesy+title&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bCLnI3U2sn&amp;sig=BNvPWhqq4zIWhgBs4YB_5SDhgaE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjD0rnV44TUAhXEnpQKHf5zDZMQ6AEIajAP#v=onepage&amp;q=laird%20courtesy%20title&amp;f=false|publisher=Hachette UK, 31 Jul. 2009|accessdate=23 May 2014|quote=The Scottish title "Laird" is a courtesy title with no legal status...in reality, certain long-established estates have the title attached to them...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Titles and Forms of Address|isbn=9781408148129 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=UZKrBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT88&amp;dq=laird+title+of+wife+of&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjY-Oy7tsbKAhVhYqYKHfgTD6gQ6AEISDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=laird%20title%20of%20wife%20of&amp;f=false |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|date=31 January 2007|accessdate=26 January 2016|quote=The widow of a chief or laird continues to use the territorial style and the prefix Dowager may be used in the same circumstances ...

===Courtesy suffix of "Younger"===
A form of courtesy title granted is the suffix of "[[Younger (title)|The Younger]]"  (also  written   as '''Yr''' '''or yr''') at the end of the name. This title is granted to the [[Heir Apparent]] of a [[Laird]] (Lord) and is placed at the end of his or her name (example - Mr John Smith of Edinburgh, Younger). The wife of a Younger may herself place the title at the end of her name. The holder is addressed as the younger (example - The Younger of Edinburgh).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scotsbarons.org/male_heir.htm |title=The Convention of The Baronage of Scotland: Male Heir|publisher=scotsbarons.org|accessdate=16  September  2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bloomsbury Publishing|title=Scottish Clans and Territorial Houses|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=10jOCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=courtesy+title+the+younger++bloomsbury&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Yzj_a06MQb&amp;sig=FYFTl7XYZZvaOrqMgpf6m8kf8ik&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi79dLZ_5_OAhUBxpQKHZ_3DlMQ6AEILjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=courtesy%20title%20the%20younger%20%20bloomsbury&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 August 2016|work=Titles and Forms of Address: A Guide to Correct Use|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing – April 2016|date=2016|quote=The heirs of chiefs, chieftains and lairds are addressed in writing  with the distinction "the younger"  before or after the territorial designation...all unmarried daughters use the (territorial) title...It is not the custom for younger sons of a chief, chieftain or laird to use either the "Younger" or the territorial titles  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scottish Feudal Baronies|url=http://www.debretts.com/forms-address/titles/scottish-and-irish-titles/scottish-feudal-baronies|website=debretts.com|accessdate=11 February 2016|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Courtesy prefix of "Maid"===
The courtesy prefix of "Maid" is granted to the eldest daughter of a Laird (Lord). If the eldest daughter is also the [[heir presumptive]] she may either hold the title "Younger" or the title "Maid". The title is customary and not automatically given. The title is placed at the end of the name (example - Miss Ali Joy, Maid of Newcastle). The holder is addressed as "The Maid of [[Laird]]ship".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scottish Feudal Baronies|url=http://www.debretts.com/forms-address/titles/scottish-and-irish-titles/scottish-feudal-baronies|website=debretts.com|accessdate=11 February 2016|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precedence status of courtesy titles==
The courtesy titles and styles of children of peers are social, not legal. For this reason, in official documents, Lord John Smith is often referred to as ''John Smith, Esq., commonly called Lord John Smith''; The Hon. Mrs Smith would be called ''Mary Jane, Mrs Smith, commonly called The Hon. Mary Jane Smith''. Only peers in attendance at Parliament enjoy [[statute|statutory]] precedence. There is, however, official [[United Kingdom order of precedence|precedence]] accorded at the Court of St James's that results from being the wife or child of a peer, and to which social styles are attached. The wives of peers, however, are peeresses and legally enjoy their titles in exactly the same manner as peeresses in their own right.

Children of peers can outrank certain actual peers. For instance, the daughter of a duke outranks a countess. However, if the daughter of a duke marries an earl, she drops to the rank of countess, because her courtesy title is subsumed in his substantive title. But, if that same daughter marries a commoner, she retains her rank. If that daughter marries the eldest son of an earl, though he may be a courtesy peer, she may keep her rank until the son inherits the earldom, when she must drop to the rank of countess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bloomsbury Publishing|title=Scottish Clans and Territorial Houses|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=10jOCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=courtesy+title+the+younger++bloomsbury&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Yzj_a06MQb&amp;sig=FYFTl7XYZZvaOrqMgpf6m8kf8ik&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi79dLZ_5_OAhUBxpQKHZ_3DlMQ6AEILjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=courtesy%20title%20the%20younger%20%20bloomsbury&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 August 2016|work=Titles and Forms of Address: A Guide to Correct Use|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing – April 2016|date=2016|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judicial courtesy titles==
Following the creation of the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]], the first Justices of that Court held life peerages, and continued to hold them. However, the Government has announced that future appointees will not be created peers, and the first non-peer appointed to the Court was [[John Dyson, Lord Dyson|Sir John Dyson]]. In order to avoid any distinction between the Scottish Justices of the Court (who receive a judicial title), by Royal Warrant dated 10 December 2010 all Justices of the Supreme Court not holding a peerage are entitled to a judicial title, and retain the style (a courtesy title) for life.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=59746 |pages=6177–6178  |date=1 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, Sir John Dyson is now styled as ''Lord Dyson'' (instead of ''The Lord Dyson'').&lt;ref name="uksc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.supremecourt.uk/docs/pr_1013.pdf |title=Courtesy titles for Justices of the Supreme Court |date=13 December 2010 |publisher=[[The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] |accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wives of male justices not holding a peerage are styled as if they were wives of peers.

In Scotland, [[Senators of the College of Justice]] (judges who sit in the [[Court of Session]]) use the title Lord or Lady along with a surname or a territorial name. All Senators of the College have the honorific, The Honourable, before their titles, while those who are also Privy Counsellors or peers have the honorific, The Right Honourable. Senators are made Privy Counsellors upon promotion to the Inner House. For example, [[Alexander Wylie, Lord Kinclaven|Alexander Wylie]] is known as ''The Honourable Lord Kinclaven'', whilst [[Ronald Mackay, Lord Eassie|Ronald Mackay]] is known as ''The Right Honourable Lord Eassie''.  Some Senators also hold peerage titles, such as [[Lynda Clark, Baroness Clark of Calton|The Rt Hon. The Lady Clark of Calton]], and these would be used in place of judicial titles.

==Professional courtesy titles==
The title of "[[Doctor (title)|Doctor]]" (or the abbreviation "Dr") is used as a courtesy title in a number of fields by professionals who do not hold doctoral degrees. It is commonly used in this manner by qualified medical practitioners (except surgeons) and by qualified dentists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095724299|title=Doctor|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|work=Oxford Reference|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons]] also allows the use of "Doctor" as a courtesy title by its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.rcvs.org.uk/news-and-events/news/uk-veterinary-surgeons-to-use-courtesy-doctor-title/ |title=UK veterinary surgeons to use courtesy ‘Doctor’ title |publisher=[[Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons]] |date=6 March 2015 |accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title of ''[[Captain]]'' is used as a courtesy title by shipmasters in the merchant navy who do not hold the military rank of captain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifsma.org/tempannounce/captain.html|title=The Courtesy Title of "Captain"|publisher=International Federation of Shipmasters' Associations|accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used in oral address for naval officers below the rank of captain who are in command of a ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/captain-military-and-maritime-service-rank#ref755719|work=[[Encyclopedia Britannica]]|accessdate=27 June 2017|title= Captain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''cultural turn''' is a movement beginning in the early 1970s among scholars in the [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]] to make [[culture]] the focus of contemporary debates; it also describes a shift in emphasis toward ''meaning'' and away from a [[positivist]] [[epistemology]]. The cultural turn is described in 2005 by [[Lynette Spillman]] and [[Mark D. Jacobs]] as "one of the most influential trends in the humanities and social sciences in the last generation".&lt;ref name="Cultural sociology at the crossroads of the discipline"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jacobs|first1=Mark|last2=Spillman|first2=Lynette|title=Cultural sociology at the crossroads of the discipline|journal=Poetics|date=2005|volume=33|issue=1|pages=1–14|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304422X05000045 |deadurl=no |accessdate=25 March 2017|doi=10.1016/j.poetic.2005.01.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prominent [[historiographer]] argues that the cultural turn involved a "wide array of new theoretical impulses coming from fields formerly peripheral to the social sciences",&lt;ref name="steinmetz1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Steinmetz|first=G|title=State/Culture: State-Formation after the Cultural Turn|year=1999|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, NY|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially [[post-structuralism]], cultural studies, literary criticism, and various forms of linguistic analysis, which emphasized "the causal and socially constitutive role of cultural processes and systems of signification".&lt;ref name="steinmetz1"/&gt;

==Background==
The cultural turn in the late 20th century is interpreted as referring to either a substantive shift in society or an analytical shift in academia. The former argues that culture plays a more significant role in advanced societies, which fits with the notion of [[post-modernity]] as an historical era in which people "emphasizes the importance of art and culture for education, moral growth, and social criticism and change".&lt;ref name="sociologyencyclopedia2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steven|first1=Best|title=Culture Turn|journal=Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology |date=2007 |doi=10.1111/b.9781405124331.2007.x |url=http://www.sociologyencyclopedia.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405124331_yr2013_chunk_g97814051243319_ss1-202|accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter is movement within academia to place the concept of culture, and the related notions of ''meaning'', ''cognition'', ''affect'', and ''symbols'' at the center of methodological and theoretical focus. Some argue that the analytical shift is endogenous to the substantive shift.&lt;ref name="sociologyencyclopedia2007"/&gt;

Culture can be defined as "the social process whereby people communicate meanings, make sense of their world, construct their identities, and define their beliefs and values".&lt;ref name="sociologyencyclopedia2007"/&gt; Or, for [[Georg Simmel]], [[culture]] refers to "the cultivation of individuals through the agency of external forms which have been objectified in the course of history". Thus culture can be interpreted on a spectrum from purely individualistic [[solipsism]] to objective forms of social organization and interaction.

==History==

===Analytical shift===
One of the earliest works in which the term "cultural turn" showed up was [[Jeffrey C. Alexander]]'s chapter "The New Theoretical Movement" in [[Neil Smelser]]'s ''Handbook of Sociology'' (1988).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alexander|first=Jeffrey|title=Handbook of Sociology|year=1988|publisher=Sage Publications|location=Beverly Hills, CA|pages=77–101|editor=Smelser, N. J.|chapter=The New Theoretical Movement}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander, rightly pointed out that the origins of the cultural turn should be traced in the debate of idealism and materialism i.e. Marx and Hegel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|last=Eyerman|first=Ron|title=Jeffrey Alexander and the Cultural Turn in Social Theory|year=2004|publisher=Thesis Eleven&amp;#124;No. 79|pages=25–30|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the labeling of the movement, in the 1970s, "foundational works underlying and facilitating the turn to cultural forms of analysis" emerged: [[Hayden White]]'s ''[[Metahistory: The Historical Imagination in Nineteenth-Century Europe]]'' (1973), [[Clifford Geertz]]'s ''The Interpretation of Cultures: Selected Essays'' (1973), [[Michel Foucault]]'s ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' (1977), and [[Pierre Bourdieu]]'s ''Outline of a Theory of Practice'' (1977).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bonnell, V. E.  |author2=Hunt, L.|title=Beyond the Cultural Turn|year=1999|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the earlier twentieth century experienced a linguistic turn, mostly brought about by the thought of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], the cultural turn of the late twentieth century absorbed those criticisms and built on them.

The cultural turn has helped [[cultural studies]] to gain more respect as an academic discipline. With the shift away from [[high culture|high arts]] the discipline has increased its perceived importance and influence on other disciplines.

British historian Heather Jones argues that the [[World War I#Historiography|historiography of the First World War]] has been reinvigorated by the cultural turn in recent years.  Scholars have raised entirely new questions regarding military occupation, radicalizion of politics, race, and the male body.&lt;ref&gt;Heather Jones,  "As the centenary approaches: the regeneration of First World War historiography." ''Historical Journal'' (2013) 56#3 pp: 857-878&lt;/ref&gt;

===Substantive shift===
The cultural turn as an historical era that breaks substantively with the past is only tangentially related to cultural turn as analytical shift. Proponents of the former argue that:

{{quote|“The very sphere of culture itself has expanded, becoming coterminous with market society in such a way that the cultural is no longer limited to its earlier, traditional or experimental forms, but it is consumed throughout daily life itself, in shopping, in professional activities, in the various often televisual forms of leisure, in production for the market and in the consumption of those market products, indeed in the most secret folds and corners of the quotidian. Social space is now completely saturated with the image of culture.”|[[Fredric Jameson]]| 1998, p. 111&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jameson|first=Fredric|title=The Cultural Turn: Selected Writings on the Postmodern, 1983-1998|year=1998|publisher=Verso|location=Brooklyn}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Advertising]], [[amateur photography]], [[yellow journalism]] and an assortment of other forms of media arose after the politically charged 1960s. Moreover, this media was [[multicultural]], and attempted to target all races, ethnicities and age groups, as opposed to more exclusive media prior to the 1960s. This "[[new media]]" of a [[postmodern]] America brought about an expansion and differentiation of culture, which has only been rapidly expanded by the [[Internet]] and [[social media]].

==In rural studies==
In recent years, there has been something of a resurgence in [[rural studies]], which has become somewhat more mainstream than previously in the academic space of social science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Woods|first=M|title=Rural geography|date=2005|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing numbers of people have taken on important dualistic questions of society/space, nature/culture structure/agency and self/other from the perspective of rural studies. However, it is the 'cultural turn' in wider social science which has lent both respectability and excitement to the nexus with rurality, particularly with new foci on landscape, otherness and the spatiality of nature. With a conceptual fascination with difference, and a methodological fascination with [[ethnography]], cultural studies have provided a significant [[palimpsest]]ual overlay onto existing landscapes of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cloke|first=P|title=Country backwater to virtual village? Rural studies and 'the cultural turn'|journal=Journal of Rural Studies|date=October 1998|volume=13|issue=4|pages=367–375|doi=10.1016/s0743-0167(97)00053-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''decompiler''' is a [[computer program]] that takes an executable file as input, and attempts to create a high level source file which can be recompiled successfully. It is therefore the opposite of a [[compiler]], which takes a source file and makes an executable. Decompilers are usually unable to perfectly reconstruct the original source code, and as such, will frequently produce obfuscated code. Nonetheless, decompilers remain an important tool in the [[reverse engineering]] of [[computer software]].

==Introduction==
The term ''decompiler'' is most commonly applied to a program which translates [[executable]] programs (the output from a [[compiler]]) into [[source code]] in a (relatively) [[high level language]] which, when compiled, will produce an executable whose behavior is the same as the original executable program. By comparison, a [[disassembler]] translates an executable program into [[assembly language]] (and an assembler could be used to assemble it back into an executable program).

Decompilation is the act of using a decompiler, although the term can also refer to the output of a decompiler. It can be used for the recovery of lost source code, and is also useful in some cases for [[computer security]], [[interoperability]] and [[error correction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mike Van Emmerik |url=http://www.program-transformation.org/Transform/WhyDecompilation |title=Why Decompilation |publisher=Program-transformation.org |date=2005-04-29 |accessdate=2010-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of decompilation depends on the amount of information present in the code being decompiled and the sophistication of the analysis performed on it. The bytecode formats used by many virtual machines (such as the [[Java Virtual Machine]] or the [[.NET Framework]] [[Common Language Runtime]]) often include extensive [[metadata]] and high-level features that make decompilation quite feasible. The presence of [[Debugger|debug data]] can make it possible to reproduce the original variable and structure names and even the line numbers. [[Machine language]] without such metadata or debug data is much harder to decompile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|contribution=Decompiling Java Bytecode: Problems, Traps and Pitfalls|first1=Jerome|last1=Miecznikowski|first2=Laurie|last2=Hendren|
pages=111–127|editor=R Nigel Horspool|title=Compiler Construction: 11th International Conference, proceedings / CC 2002|
isbn=3-540-43369-4|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some compilers and post-compilation tools produce [[obfuscated code]] (that is, they attempt to produce output that is very difficult to decompile). This is done to make it more difficult to [[reverse engineer]] the executable.

==Design==
Decompilers can be thought of as composed of a series of phases each of which contributes specific aspects of the overall decompilation process.

===Loader===
The first decompilation phase loads and parses the input machine code or [[intermediate language]] program's binary file format. It should be able to discover basic facts about the input program, such as the architecture (Pentium, PowerPC, etc.) and the entry point. In many cases, it should be able to find the equivalent of the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; function of a [[C (programming language)|C]] program, which is the start of the '''user written''' code. This excludes the runtime initialization code, which should not be decompiled if possible. If available the symbol tables and debug data are also loaded. The front end may be able to identify the libraries used even if they are linked with the code, this will provide library interfaces. If it can determine the compiler or compilers used it may provide useful information in identifying code idioms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Decompilation of Binary Programs|journal=Software Practice and Experience|first1=Cristina|last1=Cifuentes|first2=K. John|last2=Gough|volume=25|issue=7|pages=811–829|date=July 1995|citeseerx = 10.1.1.14.8073|doi=10.1002/spe.4380250706}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disassembly===
The next logical phase is the disassembly of machine code instructions into a machine independent intermediate representation (IR). For example, the Pentium machine instruction
&lt;source lang="asm"&gt;
 mov    eax, [ebx+0x04]
&lt;/source&gt;
might be translated to the IR
 eax  := m[ebx+4];

===Idioms===
Idiomatic machine code sequences are sequences of code whose combined semantics is not immediately apparent from the instructions' individual semantics. Either as part of the disassembly phase, or as part of later analyses, these idiomatic sequences need to be translated into known equivalent IR. For example, the [[x86 assembly language|x86 assembly code]]:
&lt;source lang="nasm"&gt;
    cdq    eax             ; edx is set to the sign-extension of eax
    xor    eax, edx
    sub    eax, edx
&lt;/source&gt;
could be translated to
 eax  := abs(eax);

Some idiomatic sequences are machine independent; some involve only one instruction. For example, {{code|2=nasm|xor eax, eax}} clears the &lt;code&gt;eax&lt;/code&gt; register (sets it to zero). This can be implemented with a machine independent simplification rule, such as &lt;code&gt;a = 0&lt;/code&gt;.

In general, it is best to delay detection of idiomatic sequences if possible, to later stages that are less affected by instruction ordering. For example, the instruction scheduling phase of a compiler may insert other instructions into an idiomatic sequence, or change the ordering of instructions in the sequence. A pattern matching process in the disassembly phase would probably not recognize the altered pattern. Later phases group instruction expressions into more complex expressions, and modify them into a canonical (standardized) form, making it more likely that even the altered idiom will match a higher level pattern later in the decompilation.

It is particularly important to recognize the compiler idioms for [[subroutine]] calls, [[exception handling]], and [[switch statement]]s. Some languages also have extensive support for [[String (computer science)|string]]s or [[long integer]]s.

===Program analysis===
Various program analyses can be applied to the IR. In particular, expression propagation combines the semantics of several instructions into more complex expressions. For example,
&lt;source lang="asm"&gt;
    mov   eax,[ebx+0x04]
    add   eax,[ebx+0x08]
    sub   [ebx+0x0C],eax
&lt;/source&gt;
could result in the following IR after expression propagation:
 m[ebx+12]  := m[ebx+12] - (m[ebx+4] + m[ebx+8]);
The resulting expression is more like high level language, and has also eliminated the use of the machine register &lt;code&gt;eax&lt;/code&gt; . Later analyses may eliminate the &lt;code&gt;ebx&lt;/code&gt; register.

===Data flow analysis===
The places where register contents are defined and used must be traced using [[data flow analysis]]. The same analysis can be applied to locations that are used for temporaries and local data. A different name  can then be formed for each such connected set of value definitions and uses. It is possible that the same local variable location was used for more than one variable in different parts of the original program. Even worse it is possible for the data flow analysis to identify a path whereby a value may flow between two such uses even though it would never actually happen or matter in reality. This may in bad cases lead to needing to define a location as a union of types. The decompiler may allow  the user to explicitly break such unnatural dependencies which will lead to clearer code. This of course means a variable is potentially used without being initialized and so indicates a problem in the original program.

===Type analysis===
A good machine code decompiler will perform type analysis. Here, the way registers or memory locations are used result in constraints on the possible type of the location. For example, an &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; instruction implies that the operand is an integer; programs do not use such an operation on [[floating point]] values (except in special library code) or on [[Pointer (computer programming)|pointers]]. An &lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt; instruction results in three constraints, since the operands may be both integer, or one integer and one pointer (with integer and pointer results respectively; the third constraint comes from the ordering of the two operands when the types are different).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|contribution=Type-Based Decompilation|title=Programming languages and systems: 8th European Symposium on Programming Languages and Systems
|first1=Alan|last1=Mycroft|editor=S. Doaitse Swierstra|pages=208–223|year=1999|publisher=Springer-Verlag|isbn=3-540-65699-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various high level expressions can be recognized which trigger recognition of structures or arrays. However, it is difficult to distinguish many of the possibilities, because of the freedom that machine code or even some high level languages such as C allow with casts and pointer arithmetic.

The example from the previous section could result in the following high level code:
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
 struct T1 *ebx;
    struct T1 {
        int v0004;
        int v0008;
        int v000C;
    };
  ebx-&gt;v000C -= ebx-&gt;v0004 + ebx-&gt;v0008;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Structuring===
The penultimate decompilation phase involves structuring of the IR into higher level constructs such as &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loops and &lt;code&gt;if/then/else&lt;/code&gt; conditional statements. For example, the machine code
&lt;source lang="asm"&gt;
    xor eax, eax
 l0002:
    or  ebx, ebx
    jge l0003
    add eax,[ebx]
    mov ebx,[ebx+0x4]
    jmp l0002
 l0003:
    mov [0x10040000],eax
&lt;/source&gt;
could be translated into:
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
    eax = 0;
    while (ebx &lt; 0) {
        eax += ebx-&gt;v0000;
        ebx = ebx-&gt;v0004;
    }
    v10040000 = eax;
&lt;/source&gt;
Unstructured code is more difficult to translate into structured code than already structured code. Solutions include replicating some code, or adding boolean variables.&lt;ref&gt;C. Cifuentes. ''Reverse Compilation Techniques''. PhD thesis, Queensland University of Technology, 1994. (available as [http://www.labri.fr/perso/fleury/download/papers/binary_analysis/cifuentes-thesis.pdf PDF Chapter 6])&lt;/ref&gt;

===Code generation===
The final phase is the generation of the high level code in the back end of the decompiler. Just as a compiler may have several back ends for generating machine code for different architectures, a decompiler may have several back ends for generating high level code in different high level languages.

Just before code generation, it may be desirable to allow an interactive editing of the IR, perhaps using some form of [[graphical user interface]]. This would allow the user to enter comments, and non-generic variable and function names. However, these are almost as easily entered in a post decompilation edit. The user may want to change structural aspects, such as converting a &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loop to a &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop. These are less readily modified with a simple text editor, although source [[code refactoring]] tools may assist with this process. The user may need to enter information that failed to be identified during the type analysis phase, e.g. modifying a memory expression to an array or structure expression. Finally, incorrect IR may need to be corrected, or changes made to cause the output code to be more readable.

==Legality==
{{original research|date=April 2013}}
{{Expert-subject|Cyberlaw|section|talk=Legality section and copyright law|date=March 2011}}
The majority of computer programs are covered by [[copyright]] laws. Although the precise scope of what is covered by copyright differs from region to region, copyright law generally provides the author (the programmer(s) or employer) with a collection of exclusive rights to the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Information technology law|first=Diane|last=Rowland|year=2005|edition=3rd|publisher=Cavendish|isbn=1-85941-756-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rights include the right to make copies, including copies made into the computer's [[Random Access Memory|RAM]] (unless creating such a copy is essential for using the program).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#106|title=U.S. Copyright Office - Copyright Law: Chapter 1|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since the decompilation process involves making multiple such copies, it is generally prohibited without the authorization of the copyright holder. However, because decompilation is often a necessary step in achieving software  [[interoperability]], copyright laws in both the United States and Europe permit decompilation to a limited extent.

In the United States, the copyright [[fair use]] defense has been successfully invoked in decompilation cases. For example, in ''[[Sega v. Accolade]]'', the court held that Accolade could lawfully engage in decompilation in order to circumvent the software locking mechanism used by Sega's game consoles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.program-transformation.org/Transform/LegalityOfDecompilation |title=The Legality of Decompilation |publisher=Program-transformation.org |date=2004-12-03 |accessdate=2010-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (PUBLIC LAW 105–304&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-105publ304/pdf/PLAW-105publ304.pdf |title=DIGITAL MILLENNIUM COPYRIGHT ACT |publisher=US Congress |date=1998-10-28 |accessdate=2013-11-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) has proper exemptions for both Security Testing and Evaluation in §1205(i), and Reverse Engineering in §1205(f).

In Europe, the [[Computer Programs Directive|1991 Software Directive]] explicitly provides for a right to decompile in order to achieve interoperability. The result of a heated debate between, on the one side, software protectionists, and, on the other, academics as well as independent software developers, Article 6 permits decompilation only if a number of conditions are met:

*First, a person or entity must have a [[Software license agreement|license]] to use the program to be decompiled.
*Second, decompilation must be necessary to achieve [[interoperability]] with the target program or other programs. Interoperability information should therefore not be readily available, such as through manuals or [[Application programming interface|API]] documentation. This is an important limitation. The necessity must be proven by the decompiler. The purpose of this important limitation is primarily to provide an incentive for developers to document and disclose their products' interoperability information.&lt;ref&gt;B. Czarnota and R.J. Hart, ''Legal protection of computer programs in Europe: a guide to the EC directive''. 1991, London: Butterworths.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Third, the decompilation process must, if possible, be confined to the parts of the target program relevant to interoperability. Since one of the purposes of decompilation is to gain an understanding of the program structure, this third limitation may be difficult to meet. Again, the burden of proof is on the decompiler.

In addition, Article 6 prescribes that the information obtained through decompilation may not be used for other purposes and that it may not be given to others.

Overall, the decompilation right provided by Article 6 [[Codification (law)|codifies]] what is claimed to be common practice in the software industry. Few European lawsuits are known to have emerged from the decompilation right. This could be interpreted as meaning one of three things: 1) the decompilation right is not used frequently and the decompilation right may therefore have been unnecessary, 2) the decompilation right functions well and provides sufficient legal certainty not to give rise to legal disputes or 3) illegal decompilation goes largely undetected. In a recent report regarding implementation of the Software Directive by the European member states, the [[European Commission]] seems to support the second interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52000DC0199:EN:HTML|title=EUR-Lex - 52000DC0199 - EN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''droit''' ([[French language|French]] for ''[[right]]'' or ''[[Law]]'') is a legal title, claim or due.

==Droits of admiralty (English law)==
{{Update-EB|section=yes|date=March 2016}}
The term is used in [[English law]] in the phrase "[[droits of admiralty]]".  This refers to certain customary rights or perquisites, formerly belonging to the [[Admiralty|Lord High Admiral]], but now to the crown, for public purposes and paid into the [[Exchequer]]. These ''droits'' (see also [[Shipwreck|wreck]]) consisted of [[flotsam]], [[jetsam]], ligan -  (goods or wreckage on the sea bed that is attached to a buoy so that it can be recovered), [[treasure]], [[deodand]], [[derelict (maritime)]], within the admiral's jurisdiction; all [[Fine (penalty)|fines]], [[Forfeiture (law)|forfeitures]], [[ransom]]s, [[recognizance]]s and pecuniary punishments; all [[sturgeon]]s, [[whale]]s, [[porpoise]]s, [[dolphin]]s, [[orca|grampuses]] and such large fishes; all ships and goods of the enemy coming into any creek, road or port, by durance or mistake; all ships seized at sea, salvage, etc., with the share of prizes such shares being afterwards called "tenths", in imitation of the French, who gave their admiral a ''droit de dixième''. The droits of admiralty were definitely surrendered for the benefit of the public by Prince [[George of Denmark]], when Lord High Admiral of England in 1702. [[American law]] does not recognize any such droits, and the disposition of captured property is regulated by various acts of [[United States Congress|Congress]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=588}}

==Other legal connexions (French law, etc.)==
The term ''droit'' is also used in various legal connexions (i.e., [[French law]]), such as the ''droit'' of [[angary]], the ''droit d'achat'' ([[right of pre-emption]]) in the case of [[contraband]], the [[feudal]] ''droit de bris'' (see wreck), the ''[[droit de regale]]'' or ancient royal privilege of claiming the revenues and patronage of a vacant [[Diocese|bishopric]], and the feudal droites of [[seignory]] generally.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=588}}

In French, ''droit'' can mean ''the whole body of the [[Law]]'', as in the motto "[[dieu et mon droit]]," which is to say "God and my whole body of Law."  ''Droit d'auteur'' is a term for [[French copyright law]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

[[Image:Madame de Meuron.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Louise Elisabeth de Meuron|Madame de Meuron]], a Swiss eccentric, with her characteristic [[ear trumpet]] and hat]]
'''Eccentricity''' (also called '''quirkiness''') is unusual or odd [[behavior]] on the part of an individual. This behavior would typically be perceived as unusual or unnecessary, without being demonstrably [[Maladaptation|maladaptive]]. Eccentricity is contrasted with [[normality (behavior)|normal]] behavior, the nearly universal means by which individuals in society solve given problems and pursue certain priorities in everyday life. People who consistently display benignly eccentric behavior are labeled as "eccentrics".

==Etymology==
From Medieval Latin ''eccentricus'', derived from Greek ''ekkentros'', "out of the center", from ''ek''-, ''ex''- "out of" + ''kentron'', "center". ''Eccentric'' first appeared in English essays as a [[neologism]] in 1551 as an astronomical term meaning "a circle in which the earth, sun, etc. deviates from its center." Five years later, in 1556, an adjective form of the word was used. In 1685, the definition evolved from the literal to the figurative, and ''eccentric'' is noted to have begun being used to describe unconventional or odd behavior. A noun form of the word – a person who possesses and exhibits these unconventional or odd qualities and behaviors – appeared by 1832.

==Depictions==
Eccentricity is often associated with [[genius]], [[intellectual giftedness]], or [[creativity]]. People may perceive the individual's eccentric behavior as the outward expression of their unique [[intelligence]] or creative impulse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/belgium/1502358/Einstein-eccentric-genius-smoked-butts-picked-up-off-street.html |title=Einstein, eccentric genius, smoked butts picked up off street |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=2005-11-06 |accessdate=2006-09-27 |location=London |first=Justin |last=Stares |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208203922/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/belgium/1502358/Einstein-eccentric-genius-smoked-butts-picked-up-off-street.html |archivedate=2009-02-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this vein, the eccentric's [[habit (psychology)|habits]] are incomprehensible not because they are illogical or the result of madness, but because they stem from a mind so original that it cannot be conformed to societal norms. English [[utilitarian]] thinker [[John Stuart Mill]] ({{nowrap|b. 1806}}) wrote that "the amount of eccentricity in a society has generally been proportional to the amount of genius, mental vigour, and moral courage which it contained,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://quotationsbook.com/quote/11729/ |title=Mill, John Stuart quote – Eccentricity has always abounded when and where strength of character |publisher=Quotationsbook.com |date=2007-07-30 |accessdate=2010-03-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201053404/http://quotationsbook.com/quote/11729/ |archivedate=2010-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Mill |first=John Stuart |year=1859 |title= On Liberty |publisher=John W.Parker &amp; Son |place=London |edition= 2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AjpGAAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=editions%3AHMraC_Owoi8C&amp;hl=bg&amp;pg=PA120#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |pages=120–121|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and mourned a lack of eccentricity as "the chief danger of the time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philosophyparadise.com/quotes/mill.html |title=Famous John Stuart Mill Quotes |publisher=Philosophy Paradise |accessdate=2010-03-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100404015825/http://www.philosophyparadise.com/quotes/mill.html |archivedate=2010-04-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edith Sitwell]] ({{nowrap|b. 1887}}) wrote that eccentricity is "often a kind of innocent pride", also saying that geniuses and aristocrats are called eccentrics because "they are entirely unafraid of and uninfluenced by the opinions and vagaries of the crowd".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/show/93314 |title=Quote by Edith Sitwell: Eccentricity is not, as some would believe... |publisher=Goodreads |accessdate=2010-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eccentricity is also associated with great wealth. What would be considered signs of insanity in a poor person, some may accept as eccentricity in wealthy people.&lt;ref name="Battaglia1995"&gt;{{cite book |last=Battaglia |first=Debbora |title=Rhetorics of self-making |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zNL6_YSNv74C&amp;pg=PA48 |accessdate=10 November 2010 |date=1995-02-03 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-08799-6 |pages=48–49 |chapter=On Eccentricity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison to considerations of normality==
A person who is simply in a "[[wikt:fish out of water|fish out of water]]" situation is not, by the strictest definition, an eccentric since (presumably) he or she may be ordinary by the conventions of his or her native environment.

Eccentrics may or may not comprehend the standards for normal behavior in their culture. They are simply unconcerned by society's disapproval of their habits or beliefs. Many of history's most brilliant minds have displayed some unusual behaviors and habits.

Some eccentrics are pejoratively considered "[[Crank (person)|cranks]]" rather than geniuses. Eccentric behavior is often considered whimsical or quirky, although it can also be strange and disturbing. Many individuals previously considered merely eccentric, such as [[aviation]] [[business magnate|magnate]] [[Howard Hughes]], have recently been retrospectively diagnosed as actually having had [[mental disorder]]s ([[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] in Hughes' case).

Other people may have an eccentric taste in [[clothes]], or eccentric [[hobbies]] or collections they pursue with great vigor. They may have a pedantic and precise manner of speaking, intermingled with inventive wordplay.

Many individuals may even manifest eccentricities consciously and deliberately in an attempt to differentiate themselves from societal norms or enhance a sense of inimitable identity. Given the overwhelmingly positive stereotypes (at least in [[popular culture]] and especially with [[fictional characters]]) often associated with eccentricity, as detailed above, certain individuals seek to be associated with this sort of character type. However, this is not always successful as eccentric individuals are not necessarily charismatic and the individual in question may simply be dismissed by others as just [[Attention seeking|seeking attention]].

''Extravagance'' is a kind of eccentricity, related to abundance and wastefulness; refer to description in ''[[hyperbole]]''.

===Characteristics===
[[Psychologist]] David Weeks believes people with a mental illness "suffer" from their behavior while eccentrics are quite happy.&lt;ref name="weeks"&gt;Weeks, David and James, Jamie (1995) ''Eccentrics: A study of Sanity and Strangeness'', Villiard, {{ISBN|0-394-56565-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0876/is_n75/ai_18356303/ |title=Interview with David Weeks – "Nutrition Health Review", Winter, 1996 |publisher=Findarticles.com |date=2009-06-02 |accessdate=2010-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He even states eccentrics are ''less'' prone to mental illness than everyone else.

According to Weeks' study, there are several distinctive characteristics that often differentiate a healthy eccentric person from a regular person or someone who has a mental illness. The first five characteristics on Weeks' list are found in most people regarded as eccentric:&lt;ref name="weeks"/&gt;&lt;!-- The list keeps being changed, but it should conform to this source which is available online and refers to the study, which is not readily available to check: http://www.gnomesondope.com/stuff/on-being-eccentric/ --&gt;&lt;!-- Elsewhere Weeks claims 25:  Rather than paraphrase a long list, I quoted the central part and added a ref.--&gt;

* Enduring non-conformity
* [[Creativity|Creative]]
* Strongly motivated by an exceedingly powerful [[curiosity]] and related [[Exploration|exploratory]] behaviour
* An enduring and distinct feeling of differentness from others
* [[Idealism]] in the sense of wanting to make the world a better place and the people in it happier&lt;ref name="celebratingeccentrics.com"&gt;Weeks, David (2014) "The Definition of Eccentricity" {{cite web |url=http://celebratingeccentrics.com/the-definition-of-eccentricity/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202000754/http://celebratingeccentrics.com/the-definition-of-eccentricity/ |archivedate=2017-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Election monitoring''' is the observation of an [[election]] by one or more independent parties, typically from another country or a [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO), primarily to assess the conduct of an election process on the basis of national legislation and [[international election standards]]. There are national and international election observers. Monitors do not directly prevent [[electoral fraud]], but rather record and report such instances. Election observation increasingly looks at the entire electoral process over a longer period of time, rather than at election-day proceedings only. The [[Legitimacy (political science)|legitimacy]] of an election can be affected by the criticism of monitors, provided that they are themselves seen as unbiased. A notable individual is often appointed honorary leader of a monitoring organization in an effort to enhance its own legitimacy.

==History==
The first monitored election was that of an 1857 [[plebiscite]] in [[Moldavia]] and [[Wallachia]] (current Romania) that was monitored by most of the major European powers. Election monitoring was uncommon until after [[World War II]]. Election observation activities have expanded significantly following the end of the [[Cold War]], along with the development of international standards on the conduct of democratic elections and the process of monitoring elections by both international&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndi.org/files/1923_declaration_102705_0.pdf|title=Declaration of Principles for International Election Observation}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and domestic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gndem.org/sites/default/files/declaration/Declaration_of_Global_Principles.pdf |title=Declaration of Global Principles for Nonpartisan Election Observation and Monitoring by Citizen Organizations }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;  observing organizations.

In the 1990s, international election observation focused on elections in countries with weak democracies or democracies in transition. In recent years, however, there has been an increasing number of observer mission monitoring elections in long-standing democracies, including the [[United States]], [[France]], the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Switzerland]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==Organizations==
International organizations such as the [[Organization of American States]], the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]], the [[European Union]], the [[Commonwealth Secretariat]], the [[Council of Europe]] and the [[African Union]] regularly deploy monitoring teams. The [[United Nations]] no longer provides monitoring services, instead it focuses on electoral assistance. Individual governments also participate in monitoring efforts, generally under the umbrella of an international organization. These national efforts are normally managed by the local electoral commission. A wide array of NGOs also participate in monitoring efforts. The [[Carter Center]], for example, played a key role — with the [[United Nations]] Electoral Assistance Division and the [[National Democratic Institute]] — in building consensus on a common set of international principles for election observation.&lt;ref name=carterlist&gt;[http://www.cartercenter.org/peace/democracy/observed.html#table The Carter Center list of elections observed]. [[Carter Center|The Carter Center]].&lt;/ref&gt;

International observation is complemented in many countries by domestic observer groups.

==International Election Observation==
Standard international election observation missions, as deployed by, for the example, the [[European Commission]] or the OSCE [[Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights]] (ODIHR), monitor the entire electoral process. Election experts and long-term observers begin their work weeks before the actual election day, looking at candidate registration, the legal framework, the media situation, the work of the election administration, and the campaign environment. On election day, short-term observers monitor the opening of polling stations, the vote cast, and the counting and tabulation of results. After election day, observer remain in the country for another few weeks to monitor how possible election-related shortcomings and complaints are dealt with by the election administration and the judiciary. The findings of the observers are made public in reports issued after election day.

===Long Term Observers (LTO)===
Most observation missions send a small number of long-term monitors (known as LTOs) for a period of six to eight weeks. A larger number of short-term observers (known as STOs) then join the mission for the final week of the campaign. STOs provide mostly quantitative observation of polling station and count procedures, with LTOs supplying qualitative analysis and contextual information about the wider political situation.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

In some cases, the objectivity of some international observers is questioned.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/story/0,,1844618,00.html 'People power' is a global brand owned by America]. By Mark Almond. August 15, 2006. ''[[The Guardian]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Domestic Election Observation==
In addition to international organizations monitoring elections, citizen organizations—or coalitions of organizations —also monitor elections in their own country. [http://fafen.org/ Free and Fair Election Network (FAFEN)] in Pakistan is a coalition of 42 national civil society organizations working together to promote fair elections in Pakistan.The most common type of domestic election monitoring comes by way of party poll-watchers, who are [[partisan (political)|partisan]] individuals that are looking out for the interests of their party. Election day activities of partisan observation groups often included scrutinizing the accreditation, voting, counting and tabulations processes at polling units throughout election day.

There are, however, also numerous domestic nonpartisan observer groups in many countries.

==Local and regional election monitoring==
Though most international observer organizations have a mandate to observe parliamentary elections, the [[Congress of the Council of Europe]], in cooperation with the [[Venice Commission]], is specifically mandated to monitor local and regional elections and is unique in this regard. Since 1990, over 50 election processes have been observed by the Congress.

The Congress Strategy on election observation is based on three lines of action:
* Election monitoring by the Congress should contribute to setting up institutional frameworks which comply with the principles underlying local democracy as laid down in the [[European Charter of Local Self-Government]]. In light of this, the Congress puts the accent on post-election dialogue as part of the Congress' work on monitoring of local and regional democracy. The aim is to improve the follow-up given to the recommendations adopted by the Congress following election observation missions and to facilitate their implementation.
* Election monitoring by the Congress should contribute to promoting awareness about the significance of democracy at the local and regional level.
* Making full use of the unique role of the Congress in the field of election observation, efforts are also made to increase the operational capability of election observation missions.

== Background ==
The emo subculture gained popularity among Iraqi teens in 2011. Earlier, it had become popular in other Arab countries. Emo, an offshoot of [[hardcore punk]] music,{{cn|date=May 2014}} is associated in most of the world with teen [[fashion]] and [[social alienation |alienation]], but in the Arab world is also strongly associated with [[homosexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bambury|first=Brent|title=Iraq emo killings: Associated Press Bureau Chief in Baghdad Lara Jakes talks about emo culture in Iraq (audio report)|url=http://www.cbc.ca/player/Radio/Day+6/Full+Episodes/2012/ID/2210891443/?page=13&amp;sort=MostPopular|accessdate=27 September 2012|newspaper=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation {{!}} CBC Radio|date=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, [[Saudi Arabia]]'s religious police arrested 10 emo women for allegedly causing a disturbance in a coffee shop,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-05-23/saudi-emo-girls-busted-by-religious-cops/836866|title=Saudi 'emo' girls busted by religious cops|date=2010-05-23|newspaper=ABC News|language=en-AU|access-date=2016-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2008, conservative Egyptians criticized emo fashion-followers in [[Cairo]] for being "disciples of Satan and homosexuals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=al-Attabi|first=Kadhim|title=Emo subculture on the rise among Baghdad teens|url=http://news.monstersandcritics.com/middleeast/news/article_1656804.php/Emo-subculture-on-the-rise-among-Baghdad-teens|accessdate=11 March 2012|newspaper=Monsters and Critics|date=14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homosexuality is not illegal in Iraq but it is taboo, and many [[LGBT]] (lesbian/gay/bisexual/transgender) people in Iraq are discriminated against, abused or murdered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Iraqi 'emo' youths reportedly killed by conservative militias|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-17333275|accessdate=11 March 2012|publisher=BBC News|date=11 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In February 2012, the Baghdad [[Morality Police (Iraq)|Morality Police]] published a statement on the Iraqi Interior Ministry website criticizing emo teens for wearing "strange, tight clothes with pictures of skulls on them," and "rings in their noses and tongues." The statement condemned emo as [[Quake 3 Arena|Satanic]], and quoted Colonel [[Mushtaq Taleb al-Mahemdawi]] as saying the Morality Police had been given official approval by the Interior Ministry "to eliminate [the phenomenon] as soon as possible since it's detrimentally affecting the society and becoming a danger."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Abramovitch|first=Seth|title=Truth Check: Is Iraq Killing Hundreds of Emo Teens?|url=http://www.theatlanticwire.com/global/2012/03/truth-check-iraq-killing-hundreds-emo-teens/49736/|accessdate=11 March 2012|newspaper=Atlantic Monthly|date=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[New York Times]]'' reported that in the weeks following, anti-emo flyers, threatening death "unless gay men cut their hair, stopped wearing the clothing of devil worshippers and stopped listening to metal, emo and rap music", began appearing in neighbourhoods across Baghdad.&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;

== Killings ==
[[Ministry of Interior (Iraq)|Interior Ministry]] security officers say the number of dead is six. However, the [[Reuters]] news agency reported that hospital and security officials put the number at 14 or more, and [[human rights]] groups such as the [[Brussells Tribunal]] said the dead number as many as 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emerging from Iraq: Reports of Kidnapping and Murder of Gay and Lesbian People|url=http://www.iglhrc.org/cgi-bin/iowa/article/takeaction/resourcecenter/1492.html|publisher=International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission|accessdate=11 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Associated Press]] reported that an unnamed Interior Ministry official put the number at 58, and said all but one were male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Associated Press|title=Violent 'Emo Killings' Rattle Iraqi Youth|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/03/11/148419422/violent-emo-killings-rattle-iraqi-youth|accessdate=12 March 2012|publisher=NPR|date=11 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the BBC, the [[United Nations]] puts the number of dead at at least 12, but believes the real number is much higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Antelava|first=Natalia|title=BBC investigation reveals police persecution of gays in Iraq|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-19570870|accessdate=27 September 2012|publisher=BBC News|date=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responsibility for the murders ==
International human rights groups have called on Iraqi authorities to investigate the killings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=AFP|title=Rights groups urge Iraq to investigate ‘emo’ killings|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/03/16/201079.html|accessdate=26 March 2012|publisher=Al Arabiya|date=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying they are the work of paramilitary groups and the police,&lt;ref name="vice"&gt;{{cite news|last=Taete|first=Jamie Lee Curtis|title=IS THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT KILLING LGBT PEOPLE?|url=https://www.vice.com/en_se/read/is-the-iraqi-government-killing-LGBT-people|accessdate=11 March 2012|newspaper=Vice magazine|date=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; including groups such as the [[Mahdi Army]], created in 2003 by popular [[Shia]] cleric [[Muqtada al-Sadr]].&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt; Iraqi commentators and American professor of Middle Eastern history Mark Levine have speculated that deploying paramilitary groups against emo kids serves Iraqi authorities' interests by keeping the groups occupied, and deflecting their anger and unhappiness from other possible targets in chaotic post-war Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Levine|first=Mark|title=Killing emos, and the future, in Iraq|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2012/03/201231911938716976.html|accessdate=26 March 2012|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iraqi television network [[Al Sumaria]] reported that Sadr denied responsibility for the deaths, calling the emo teens fools and unnatural but saying they should be dealt with through legal means.&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="alarabiya" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Al Arabiya News" /&gt;

Following coverage of the murders, Iraqi officials denied there is any campaign to kill gay or emo teenagers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ruhayem|first=Rami|title=Iraq's Emo killings: A horror story out of control?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-17450437|accessdate=26 March 2012|publisher=BBC News|date=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and said the story has been made up to serve anti-religious, anti-government agendas. They say emo teens can dress as they please, and that the government will protect them.&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="alarabiya" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Al Arabiya News" /&gt;

In September 2012, the BBC interviewed 17 gay men and former policemen in Baghdad, all of whom had friends or boyfriends killed, and reported that all blamed the Iraqi Interior Ministry for inciting the murders, and said arrests and killings are still ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Antelava|first=Natalia|title=BBC investigation reveals police persecution of gays in Iraq|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-19570870|accessdate=27 September 2012|publisher=BBC News|date=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
In May 2012 as a result of the emo killings, according to the [[International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission]], the Dutch government "expanded" its asylum policy towards LGBT Iraqis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iraq Baseline Study 2013|url=http://iglhrc.org/sites/default/files/Iraq%20Baseline%20Study%20Final%20with%20Table%20of%20Contents%201.29.13.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003222620/http://www.iglhrc.org/sites/default/files/Iraq%20Baseline%20Study%20Final%20with%20Table%20of%20Contents%201.29.13.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=3 October 2013|publisher=The International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission  (IGLHRC)|accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[U.S. State Department|U.S. State department]]'s 2013 [[Country Reports on Human Rights Practices]] for Iraq reported that in 2013, Iraq's [[Cabinet of Iraq|Council of Ministers]] established an inter-ministerial committee that issued a statement saying LGBT people are "no different" from others, and that established a [[charter]] to describe the baseline protection owed to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iraq Human Rights Report 2013|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/220565.pdf|publisher=United States Department of State • Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor|accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
Israeli intelligence analyst Daniel Brode claims the murders are part of an overall shift inside the Iraqi Shiite-Arab population towards becoming "more religious, more conservative and more assertive," with the goal of consolidating its own power by creating a "fundamentalist Shiite government."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brode|first=Daniel|title=Iraq: The Next Shiite Islamic Republic?|url=http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=51322|accessdate=26 March 2012|newspaper=Middle East Online|date=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the [[2003_invasion_of_iraq|2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq]], sexual minorities there enjoyed a fair amount of freedom. But the invasion brought to power the conservative [[Islamic Dawa Party]], and [[Human Rights Watch]] says that since 2004, hundreds of Iraqi gay men have been killed. The campaign has been said to be led by the Mahdi Army, with Iraqi security forces said to have "colluded and joined in the killing." Witnesses told Human Rights Watch the killers break into houses and pick up people in the street, interrogating them to extract the names of other victims, and then kill them and mutilate their bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Anti-gay attacks on rise in Iraq|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8204853.stm|accessdate=27 September 2012|publisher=BBC News|date=17 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2007, according to the London-based human rights organization [[Iraqi LGBT]], Iraqi political and religious organizations had launched an organised, coordinated campaign to hunt, arrest, torture and kill everyone they perceived as gay. Iraqi LGBT says the Iraqi government forces gay people to give names and addresses of other gays, then arrests them and hands them over to paramilitary groups to be murdered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hilli|first=Ali|title=Viewpoint: Iraqi gays in 'hell on earth'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-19525137|accessdate=27 September 2012|publisher=BBC News|date=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper, American [[human rights]] activist [[Scott_Long_(human_rights_activist)|Scott Long]] described Iraq as "a devastated society with a broken political process and a fractured public" and said "it's not just wrong, it's counterproductive to call these murders "gay killings."" He called on Iraq to begin a debate about difference, saying "Iraqis need to discuss why the horrors of the last four decades have made otherness seem intolerable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Long|first=Scott|title=Massacre of emos in Iraq goes to core of a damaged society|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/18/iraq-massacre-emos-killing-gay|accessdate=27 July 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[topological space]] ''X'' is said to be equidimensional if for all points ''p'' in ''X'' the [[dimension]] at ''p'' that is, dim&amp;nbsp;''p''(''X'') is [[constant (mathematics)|constant]].  The [[Euclidean space]] is an example of an equidimensional space.  The [[disjoint union]] of two spaces ''X'' and ''Y'' (as topological spaces) of different dimension is an example of a non-equidimensional space.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17109">A '''feminist stripper''' is a professional [[exotic dancer]] who does not conform to the [[stereotypes]] associated with exotic dancers, and instead identifies positively with the identity of [[stripper]]. Feminist strippers are [[Sex-positive feminism|sex-positive feminists]] who view their profession as a choice and a [[career]] field. Feminist strippers interact with their profession in a positive manner and view it as a female centric form of power. They receive this sense of power by asserting their [[autonomy]] and by making informed decisions in regard to the regulation of their bodies.&lt;ref name=Advocate&gt;{{cite journal|last=Distiller|first=Natasha|title=Advocating for the Right to Sell Sex|journal=Agenda|year=2001|volume=47|pages=35–42|jstor=4066451}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/29/living/antonia-crane-stripper-essay/index.html?hpt=hp_c3|title=Inside the world of a feminist stripper|first=Antonia|last=Crane|date=15 December 2014|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Teela |last1=Sanders |first2=Kate |last2=Hardy |title=Flexible Workers Labour, Regulation and the Political Economy of the Stripping Industry.|chapter=Speaking Back - the feminist and class politics of stripping |date=2014|publisher=Taylor and Francis|location=Hoboken|isbn=9781317755333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The autonomy used by feminist strippers is seen through their ability to choose who they perform for, when they will perform, and how long it will last. They chose which types of [[performance]]s they will perform. According to Meyer's "since one must exercise control over one's life to be autonomous, autonomy is something that a person accomplishes, not something that happens to persons. But freedom is precisely a combination of self-creation and what happens to you”.&lt;ref name=Freedom&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brison|first=Susan J.|title=Contentious Freedom: Sex Work and Social Construction|journal=Hypatia|year=2006|volume=21|issue=4|pages=192–200|jstor=4640030|doi=10.1111/j.1527-2001.2006.tb01136.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is liberation in the free expression of their [[Human sexuality|sexuality]]. Becoming a stripper can give a "curious kind of control over those who watched".&lt;ref name="Selling Sex, Buying Power"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kesller-Haris|first=Alice|title=Selling Sex, Buying Power?

{{Feminism sidebar}}
== Benefits ==
Feminist strippers find benefits from their work, including but not limited to, the ability to create their own hours, and work on a [[pay scale]] that is a direct reflection of their skills and talents. Feminist strippers receive a sense of empowerment from performing for an audience on stage. Feminist strippers exercise their freedom of sexuality, that is their freedom to choose how to use their bodies in interaction with their environment, through their performances, and this freedom contributes to a feeling of power and control. The amount of pay received can place strippers in an economic position of superiority over women in other occupations.&lt;ref name=Bumping&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ross|first=Becki|title=Bumping and Grinding on the Line: Making Nudity Pay|journal=Labour/Le Travail|year=2000|issue=46|pages=221–250|jstor=25149100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hardships ==
Being a stripper subjects these women to [[criticism]] from many sides. They are commonly perceived negatively by [[society]] and by working in their field are subjected to [[surveillance]], [[arrest]], [[Detention (imprisonment)|detention]], forced [[Sexually transmitted disease|venereal disease]] testing, [[extortion]], [[violence]] and [[Social rejection|rejection]] from family and friends. The type of work and the place of work can hamper or make impossible negotiation of workplace benefits such as [[sick leave]], disability leave, or [[pension]] plans.&lt;ref name="Bumping"/&gt;

[[Occupational health]] issues remain a concern in a stripper's work. Stripping is a physically demanding job, and strippers later in life can experience physical pain and injury.

Strippers face the hardship of defending their work as legitimate work, and defending their justification of using their bodies for money.&lt;ref name=T-Shirt&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rickard|first=Wendy|title=Been There, Seen It, Done It, I've Got the T-shirt: British Sex Workers Reflect on Jobs, Hopes, the Future and Retirement|journal=Feminist Review|year=2001|issue=67|pages=111–132|jstor=1395535}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Safety is another point of concern and caution in a stripper's work place. [[Bouncer (doorman)|Bouncers]] and other employees can ensure that the workers are kept out of harm's way at all times. However, unwanted touching, derogatory language, and [[Sexism|sexist]] comments can all occur without protection from bouncers. This possibly unsafe and often uncomfortable environment contributes to a state of constant awareness within [[strip club]]s.&lt;ref name="Lions Den"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Price|first=Kim|title=Keeping the Dancers in Check: The Gendered Organization of Stripping Work in the Lions Den|journal=Gender and Society|year=2008|volume=22|issue=3|pages=367–389|jstor=27821650|doi=10.1177/0891243208316518}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The many different employees within strip clubs all contribute to a club's social structure and ultimately hierarchy. The job itself is overseen and controlled by the other workers within the club. "Absolute control by male club managers and bosses... tends to reproduce in the crudest possible way the structure of [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] power and female dependence" (buying power).{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}. Strippers must negotiate with men within a stigmatized, male-controlled profession. Because they are generally paid in cash, strippers must negotiate with and share their earnings with booking agents, and pay fines to club owners for infractions such as showing up late or skipping a gig.&lt;ref name="Bumping"/&gt;

== Representation in media and popular culture ==
{{Original research section|date=October 2014}}
The mainstream media has perpetuated the [[virgin/whore dichotomy]] to a point of a selfless identity for the everyday woman whose career is stripping. The movies ''[[Striptease (film)|Striptease]]'' and ''[[Showgirls]]'' have brought to life a few sides of the stripper that is now seen as typical. She is either portrayed as a home-wrecking, unintelligent, thief, or she is a mother doing what needs to be done to put food on the table for her child. These mainstream stereotypes fail to portray the woman who takes pleasure in her job and the woman who chooses to have this job.

"As an illustration, consider the situation of a young dancer who decides to undergo breast augmentation to increase her income per evening. After the surgery, she receives more attention, compliments, and money. Consequently, our hypothetical dancer feels more confident and powerful approaching men and soliciting dances, supporting the analysis of the sex radical feminists in her individual life. Simultaneously, from a [[radical feminist]] perspective (structural level), she is participating in and perpetuating an institutionalized beauty myth that reinforces women's subordinate status by rendering their value dependent on the approval of men."&lt;ref name="Mobius Stripping"/&gt;

== Criticism ==
There are many debates surrounding the justification of viewing stripping as a feminist action. Many feminists find stripping to violate [[human rights]] and dignity, saying that stripping, and sexual exploitation will be the "end of feminism." This criticism is supported by societal views of women who engage in sexual acts for money, and the social stigmas associated with sex acts. Social stigmas surrounding stripping such as gang affiliation, drug use, [[Sexually transmitted disease|STDs]], and prostitution contribute to the criticism of women who become exotic dancers.&lt;ref name="Sex Work"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Overall|first=Christine|title=What's Wrong with Prostitution?

== Exploitation ==
Feminists and non feminists alike can view stripping as exploitation of the female body, "the act of stripping overvalues physical perfection and abstracts the sexual qualities of the female body, it places voyeuristic men in the position of judges and arbiters of the female face." &lt;ref name="Selling Sex, Buying Power"/&gt; However, feminist strippers find the use of their body as a potential tool, to be sexually, psychologically, and emotionally empowering. Feminist strippers argue that they receive positive reinforcement while performing, and this reinforcement perpetuates their self empowerment. A main argument of feminism is the exploitation of the female body by the dominant group, i.e. males, is a main concern that perpetuates the domination of females because of their body. Many find problems with self-identified feminist strippers, because of this argument.&lt;ref name="Doing Gender"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Trautner |first=Mary Nell |title= Doing gender, doing class: the performance of sexuality in exotic dance clubs | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 771–788 | publisher = [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0891243205277253 | jstor = 27640850 | date = December 2005 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0891243205277253 |ref=harv |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gender inequality''' is the idea and situation that [[men]] and [[women]] are not equal. Gender inequality refers to unequal treatment or perceptions of individuals wholly or partly due to their [[gender]]. It arises from differences in [[gender role]]s.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; [[Gender systems]] are often [[Dichotomy|dichotomous]] and hierarchical. Gender inequality stems from distinctions, whether empirically grounded or socially constructed. Women lag behind men in many domains, including education, labor market opportunities and political representation and in pay.

==Natural gender differences==

Belmont, CA: Wadsworth/Thomson Learning, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a natural difference also in the relative physical strengths (on average) of the sexes, both in the lower body and more pronouncedly in the upper-body, though this does not mean that any given man is stronger than any given woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Maughan RJ, Watson JS, Weir J |year=1983 |title=Strength and cross-sectional area of human skeletal muscle |url=http://jp.physoc.org/content/338/1/37.abstract |journal=The Journal of Physiology |volume=338 |issue=1 |pages=37–49 |pmid=6875963 |pmc=1197179 |doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1983.sp014658}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Frontera, Hughes, Lutz, Evans |year=1991 |title=A cross-sectional study of muscle strength and mass in 45- to 78-yr-old men and women |url=http://jap.physiology.org/cgi/content/abstract/71/2/644 |journal =J Appl Physiol |volume=71 |issue=2|pages=644–50 |pmid=1938738|doi=10.1152/jappl.1991.71.2.644 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Men, on average, are taller, which provides both advantages and disadvantages.&lt;ref name="Samaras 2007 33–61"&gt;{{Cite book|title= Human body size and the laws of scaling |last= Samaras|first= Thomas|year=2007 |publisher=Nova Science|location=New York|isbn= 978-1-60021-408-0|pages= 33–61|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=PCU0RwDI6c4C}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Women live significantly longer than men,&lt;ref name=CIA&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2102.html|title=Life expectancy at birth, Country Comparison to the World|publisher=US [[Central Intelligence Agency]]|date=n.d.|website=CIA World Factbook|accessdate=12 Jan 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it is not clear to what extent this is a biological difference - see [[Life expectancy#gender differences|Life expectancy]].

This has historically been understood as a cause of the gendered wage gap but is no longer a predominant cause as women and men in certain occupations tend to have similar education levels or other credentials. Even when such characteristics of jobs and workers are controlled for, the presence of women within a certain occupation leads to lower wages. This earnings discrimination is considered to be a part of pollution theory. This theory suggests that jobs which are predominated by women offer lower wages than do jobs simply because of the presence of women within the occupation. As women enter an occupation, this reduces the amount of prestige associated with the job and men subsequently leave these occupations. The entering of women into specific occupations suggests that less competent workers have begun to be hired or that the occupation is becoming [[deskilling|deskilled]]. Men are reluctant to enter female-dominated occupations because of this and similarly resist the entrance of women into male-dominated occupations.&lt;ref name="Stratification"&gt;Massey, Douglas. "Categorically Unequal: The American Stratification System." NY: Russell Sage Foundation, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Page needed|date=October 2012}}

The gendered income disparity can also be attributed in part to [[occupational segregation]], where groups of people are distributed across occupations according to ascribed characteristics; in this case, gender.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Occupational gender segregation can be understood {{who|date=October 2012}} to contain two components or dimensions; horizontal segregation and vertical segregation. With horizontal segregation, occupational sex segregation occurs as men and women are thought to possess different physical, emotional, and mental capabilities. These different capabilities make the genders vary in the types of jobs they are suited for. This can be specifically viewed with the gendered division between manual and non-manual labor.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} With vertical segregation, occupational sex segregation occurs as occupations are stratified according to the power, authority, income, and prestige associated with the occupation and women are excluded from holding such jobs.&lt;ref name="Stratification"/&gt;

As women entered the workforce in larger numbers since the 1960s, occupations have become segregated based on the amount femininity or masculinity presupposed to be associated with each occupation.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Census data suggests that while some occupations have become more gender integrated (mail carriers, bartenders, bus drivers, and real estate agents), occupations including teachers, nurses, secretaries, and librarians have become female-dominated while occupations including architects, electrical engineers, and airplane pilots remain predominately male in composition.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Based on the census data, women occupy the [[Tertiary sector of economic activity|service sector]] jobs at higher rates than men. Women’s overrepresentation in service sector jobs, as opposed to jobs that require managerial work acts as a reinforcement of women and men into traditional [[gender role]]s that causes gender inequality.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, Charles, E. Social Inequality. 6th. Boston: Pearson Education, Inc., 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:US gender pay gap, by sex, race-ethnicity-2009.png|thumb|330px|Median weekly earnings of full-time wage and salary workers, by sex, race, and ethnicity, U.S., 2009.&lt;ref name="bls 2009"&gt;U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

“The gender wage gap is an indicator of women’s earnings compared with men’s. It is figured by dividing the average annual earnings for women by the average annual earnings for men.” (Higgins et al., 2014) 
Scholars disagree about how much of the male-female wage gap depends on factors such as experience, education, occupation, and other job-relevant characteristics. Sociologist Douglas Massey found that 41% remains unexplained,&lt;ref name="Stratification"/&gt; while CONSAD analysts found that these factors explain between 65.1 and 76.4 percent of the raw wage gap.&lt;ref name="CONSAD wage gap"&gt;{{cite web|author1=CONSAD research corp. |title=An Analysis of Reasons for the Disparity in Wages Between Men and Women |url=http://www.consad.com/content/reports/Gender%20Wage%20Gap%20Final%20Report.pdf |accessdate=30 October 2015 |date=12 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008051216/http://www.consad.com/content/reports/Gender%20Wage%20Gap%20Final%20Report.pdf |archivedate=October 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CONSAD also noted that other factors such as benefits and overtime explain "additional portions of the raw gender wage gap".

The [[glass ceiling]] effect is also considered a possible contributor to the gender wage gap or income disparity. This effect suggests that gender provides significant disadvantages towards the top of job hierarchies which become worse as a person’s career goes on. The term glass ceiling implies that invisible or artificial barriers exist which prevent women from advancing within their jobs or receiving promotions. These barriers exist in spite of the achievements or qualifications of the women and still exist when other characteristics that are job-relevant such as experience, education, and abilities are controlled for. The inequality effects of the glass ceiling are more prevalent within higher-powered or higher income occupations, with fewer women holding these types of occupations. The glass ceiling effect also indicates the limited chances of women for income raises and promotion or advancement to more prestigious positions or jobs. As women are prevented by these artificial barriers, from either receiving job promotions or income raises, the effects of the inequality of the glass ceiling increase over the course of a woman’s career.&lt;ref&gt;Cotter, David, Joan Hermsen, Seth Ovadia and Reeve Vanneman. "Social Forces: The Glass Ceiling Effect." Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Statistical discrimination (economics)|Statistical discrimination]] is also cited as a cause for income disparities and gendered [[inequality in the workplace]]. Statistical discrimination indicates the likelihood of employers to deny women access to certain occupational tracks because women are more likely than men to leave their job or the labor force when they become married or pregnant. Women are instead given positions that dead-end or jobs that have very little mobility.&lt;ref name="Burstein, Paul 1994"&gt;Burstein, Paul. "Equal Employment Opportunity: Labor Market Discrimination and Public Policy." Edison, NJ: Aldine Transaction, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Third World countries such as the Dominican Republic, female entrepreneurs are statistically more prone to failure in business. In the event of a business failure women often return to their domestic lifestyle despite the absence of income. On the other hand, men tend to search for other employment as the household is not a priority.&lt;ref&gt;Sherri Grasmuck and Rosario Espinal. "Market Success or Female Autonomy?" Sage Publications, Inc, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The gender earnings ratio suggests that there has been an increase in women’s earnings comparative to men. Men’s plateau in earnings began after the 1970s, allowing for the increase in women’s wages to close the ratio between incomes. Despite the smaller ratio between men and women’s wages, disparity still exists. Census&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov/ Census]&lt;/ref&gt; data suggests that women’s earnings are 71 percent of men's earnings in 1999.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Cotter, David, Joan Hermsen, and Reeve Vanneman. The American People Census 2000: Gender Inequality at Work. New York: Russell Sage Foundation, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The gendered wage gap varies in its width among different races. Whites comparatively have the greatest wage gap between the genders. With whites, women earn 78% of the wages that white men do. With African Americans, women earn 90% of the wages that African American men do.

There are some exceptions where women earn more than men: According to a survey on gender pay inequality by the [[International Trade Union Confederation]], female workers in the Gulf state of [[Bahrain]] earn 40 percent more than male workers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vedior.com/hr-portal/recruitment-news/women-earn-less-than-men-across-the-globe.html?c=3052 Women 'earn less than men across the globe'], Vedior, 4 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, a report by the International Labor Organization (ILO) reveals the wage gap between Cambodian women factory workers and other male counterparts. There was a $25 USD monthly pay difference conveying that women have a much lower power and being devalued not only at home but also in the workplace.&lt;ref name="opendemocracy.net"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/5050/theresa-de-langis/what's-woman-worth-wages-and-democracy-in-cambodia|title=What's a woman worth?: wages and democracy in Cambodia|date=2015-02-01|website=openDemocracy|access-date=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professional education and careers===
The gender gap also appeared to narrow considerably beginning in the mid-1960s. Where some 5% of first-year students in professional programs were female in 1965, by 1985 this number had jumped to 40% in law and medicine, and over 30% in dentistry and business school.&lt;ref&gt;Goldin, Claudia, and Lawrence F. Katz. "On The Pill: Changing the course of women's education." The Milken Institute Review, Second Quarter 2001: p3.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the highly effective [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pill]] was available, women planning professional careers, which required a long-term, expensive commitment, had to "pay the penalty of abstinence or cope with considerable uncertainty regarding pregnancy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goldin |first1=Claudia |last2=Katz |first2=Lawrence F. |year=2002 |title=The Power Of The Pill: Contraceptives And Women's Career And Marriage Decisions |url= |journal=Journal of Political Economy |volume=110 |issue=4 |page=731 |doi=10.1086/340778|citeseerx=10.1.1.473.6514 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This control over their reproductive decisions allowed women to more easily make long-term decisions about their education and professional opportunities. Women are highly underrepresented on boards of directors and in senior positions in the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catalyst.org/etc/Catalyst_Written_Testimony_To_JEC_With_Appendix.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719161242/http://www.catalyst.org/etc/Catalyst_Written_Testimony_To_JEC_With_Appendix.pdf|date=July 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, with reliable birth control, young men and women had more reason to delay marriage. This meant that the marriage market available to any women who "delay[ed] marriage to pursue a career... would not be as depleted. Thus the Pill ''could'' have influenced women's careers, college majors, professional degrees, and the age at marriage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goldin |first1=Claudia |year=2006 |title=The Quiet Revolution That Transformed Women's Employment, Education, And Family |url= |journal=American Economic Review |volume=96 |issue=2|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies on sexism in science and technology fields have produced conflicting results. Corinne et al. found that science faculty of both sexes rated a male applicant as significantly more competent and hireable than an identical female applicant. These participants also selected a higher starting salary and offered more career mentoring to the male applicant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Corinne |display-authors=etal |year=2012 |title=Science faculty's subtle gender biases favor male students |journal=PNAS |volume=109|issue= 41|pages=16474–16479|doi=10.1073/pnas.1211286109 |pmid=22988126 |pmc=3478626}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams and Ceci, however, found that science and technology faculty of both sexes "preferred female applicants 2:1 over identically qualified males with matching lifestyles" for tenure-track positions.&lt;ref name="Williams and Ceci STEM sexism"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=Wendy|last2=Stephen|first2=Ceci|title=National hiring experiments reveal 2:1 faculty preference for women on STEM tenure track|journal=PNAS|date=28 April 2015|volume=112|issue=17|pages=5360–5365|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/112/17/5360.abstract|accessdate=30 October 2015|pmid=25870272|doi=10.1073/pnas.1418878112|pmc=4418903}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies show parents are more likely to expect their sons, rather than their daughters, to work in a science, technology, engineering or mathematics field – even when their 15-year-old boys and girls perform at the same level in mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;What Lies Behind Gender Inequality in Education? 2015, s.n., S.l.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gender inequality in relationships====
Gender equality in relationships has been growing over the years but for the majority of relationships, the power lies with the male.&lt;ref name="van Hooff 2011 19–30"&gt;{{cite journal|last=van Hooff|first=Jenny H.|title=Rationalising inequality: heterosexual couples' explanations and justifications for the division of housework along traditionally gendered lines|journal=Journal of Gender Studies|date=March 2011|volume=20|issue=1|pages=19–30|doi=10.1080/09589236.2011.542016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even now men and women present themselves as divided along gender lines. A study done by Szymanowicz and Furnham, looked at the cultural stereotypes of intelligence in men and women, showing the gender inequality in self-presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Szymanowicz|first=Agata|author2=Adrian Furnham|title=Do intelligent women stay single? Cultural stereotypes concerning the intellectual abilities of men and women|journal=Journal of Gender Studies|date=March 2011|volume=20|issue=1|pages=43–54|doi=10.1080/09589236.2011.542019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This study showed that females thought if they revealed their intelligence to a potential partner, then it would diminish their chance with him. Men however would much more readily discuss their own intelligence with a potential partner. Also, women are aware of people’s negative reactions to IQ, so they limit its disclosure to only trusted friends. Females would disclose IQ more often than men with the expectation that a real true friend would respond in a positive way. Intelligence continues to be viewed as a more masculine trait, than feminine trait. The article suggested that men might think women with a high IQ would lack traits that were desirable in a mate such as warmth, nurturance, sensitivity, or kindness. Another discovery was that females thought that friends should be told about one’s IQ more so than males. However, males expressed doubts about the test’s reliability and the importance of IQ in real life more so than women. The inequality is highlighted when a couple starts to decide who is in charge of family issues and who is primarily responsible for earning income. For example, in Londa Schiebinger’s book, "Has Feminism Changed Science?", she claims that "Married men with families on average earn more money, live longer and happier, and progress faster in their careers," while "for a working woman, a family is a liability, extra baggage threatening to drag down her career."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schiebinger|first=Londa|title=Has Feminism Changed Science|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, statistics had shown that "only 17 percent of the women who are full professors of engineering have children, while 82 percent of the men do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schiebinger|first=Londa|title=Has Feminism Changed Science|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Attempts in equalizing household work====
Despite the increase in women in the labour force since the mid-1900s, traditional gender roles are still prevalent in American society. Women may be expected to put their educational and career goals on hold in order to raise children, while their husbands work. However, women who choose to work as well as fulfill a perceived gender role of cleaning the house and taking care of the children. Despite the fact that different households may divide chores more evenly, there is evidence that supports that women have retained the primary caregiver role within familial life despite contributions economically. This evidence suggest that women who work outside the home often put an extra 18 hours a week doing household or childcare related chores as opposed to men who average 12 minutes a day in childcare activities.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Ellen, and Jennifer Marshall. Issues of Gender. New York: Pearson Education, Inc., 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; One study by van Hooff showed that modern couples, do not necessarily purposefully divide things like household chores along gender lines, but instead may rationalize it and make excuses.&lt;ref name="van Hooff 2011 19–30"/&gt;  One excuse used is that women are more competent at household chores and have more motivation to do them. Another is that some say the demands of the males’ jobs is higher.

There was a study conducted at an "urban comprehensive school". They were asked questions regarding their views in sexual inequality. Many parents were for the equal pay for men and women. They also were in favor for men to help with the housework. In this study, the majority of the people who were interviewed wanted gender equality and more people wants a change in gender roles. Where men stay home, cleans, and cooks while the women can work and help support the family.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Gender roles have changed drastically over the past few decades. In the article, it says that in 1920-1966, there was data recorded that women spent the most time care-tending with the home and family. There was a study made with the gender roles with the males and females, The results showed that as women spend less time in the house, men have taken over the role as the mother. The article also said that women who work spend less time within the house and with their children if they have any. Furthermore, men are taking the roles of women in the homes and its changing as time goes on. Robin A. Douthitt, the author of the article, "The Division of Labor Within the Home: Have Gender Roles Changed?" concluded by saying, "(1) men do not spend significnatly more time with chil- dren when their wives are employed and (2) employed women spend signifi- cantly less time in child care than their full-time homemaker counterparts, over a 10-year period both mothers and fathers are spending more total time with children."

====Gender inequalities in relation to technology====
One survey showed that men rate their technological skills in activities such as basic computer functions and online participatory communication higher than women.  However, it should be noted that this study was a self-reporting study, where men evaluate themselves on their own perceived capabilities.  It thus is not data based on actual ability, but merely perceived ability, as participants' ability was not assessed. Additionally, this study is inevitably subject to the significant bias associated with self-reported data.&lt;ref&gt;Eszter Hargittai, What Causes Variation in Contributing to Participatory Web Sites?&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrary to such findings, a carefully controlled study that analyzed data sets from 25 developing countries led to the consistent finding that the reason why fewer women access and use digital technology is a direct result of their unfavorable conditions and ongoing discrimination with respect to employment, education and income.&lt;ref name="HilbertGend2011"/&gt; When controlling for these variables, women turn out to be more active users of digital tools than men. This turns the alleged digital gender divide into an opportunity: given women's affinity for ICT, and given that digital technologies are tools that can improve living conditions, ICT represents a concrete and tangible opportunity to tackle longstanding challenges of gender inequalities in developing countries, including access to employment, income, education and health services.

=== Property inheritance ===
Many countries have laws that give less inheritance of ancestral property for women compared to men.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.womanstats.org/substatics/Property%20Rights%20in%20Law%20and%20Practice%20for%20Women_2011tif_wmlogo3.png&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Qur'an]], {{Quran-usc|4|11}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Structural marginalization ===
Gender inequalities often stem from social structures that have institutionalized conceptions of gender differences.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

[[Marginalization]] occurs on an individual level when someone feels as if they are on the fringes or margins of their respective society. This is a social process and displays how current policies in place can affect people. For example, media advertisements display young girls with easy bake ovens (promoting being a housewife) as well as with dolls that they can feed and change the diaper of (promoting being a mother).

=== Gender stereotypes ===
{{main|Gender stereotypes}}
{{see also|Category:Feminism and the arts}}
Cultural stereotypes, which can dictate specific roles, are engrained in both men and women and these [[stereotype]]s are a possible explanation for gender inequality and the resulting gendered wage disparity. Women have traditionally been viewed as being caring and nurturing and are designated to occupations which require such skills.{{clarify|date=September 2012}}{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} While these skills are culturally valued,{{clarify|date=September 2012}} they were typically associated with domesticity, so occupations requiring these same skills are not economically valued.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Men have traditionally been viewed as the main worker in the home, so jobs held by men have been historically economically valued and occupations predominated by men continue to be economically valued and earn higher wages.&lt;ref name="Stratification"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2012}}

Gender Stereotypes influenced greatly by gender expectations, different expectations on gender influence how people determine their roles, appearance, behaviors, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Annual Review of Psychology Gender Stereotypes|journal = Annual Review of Psychology|volume = 69|pages = 275–298|last=Ellemers|first=Naomi|date=27 September 2017|doi = 10.1146/annurev-psych-122216-011719|pmid = 28961059}}&lt;/ref&gt; When expectations of gender roles deeply rooted in people's mind, people' values and ideas started to be influenced and leading to situation of stereotypes, which actualize their ideas into actions and perform different standards labelling the behaviors of people. Gender stereotypes limit opportunities of different gender when their performance or abilities were standardizing according to their gender-at-birth, that women and men may encounter limitations and difficulties when challenging the society through performing behaviors that their gender "not supposed" to perform. For example, men may receive judgments when they trying to stay at home and finish housework and allow their wives to go out and work instead, as men are expected to be work outside for earning money for the family.  The traditional concepts of gender stereotypes are being challenged nowadays in different societies and improvement could be observed that men could also be responsible for housework, women could also be construction worker in some societies. It is still a long process when traditional concepts and values have deep-rooted in people's mind, that higher acceptance towards gender roles and characteristics is homely to be gradually developed.

===Biological fertilisation stereotypes===
Bonnie Spanier coined the term hereditary inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schiebinger|first=London|title=Has Feminism Changed Science|year=2001|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=United States of America|isbn=978-0674005440}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her opinion is that some scientific publications depict human fertilization such that sperms seem to actively compete for the "passive" egg, even though in reality it is complicated (e.g. the egg has specific active membrane proteins that select sperm etc.)

===Sexism and discrimination===
Gender inequality can further be understood through the mechanisms of [[sexism]]. [[Discrimination]] takes place in this manner as men and women are subject to prejudicial treatment on the basis of gender alone. Sexism occurs when men and women are framed within two dimensions of social cognition.

Discrimination also plays out with networking and in preferential treatment within the economic market. Men typically occupy positions of power within the job economy. Due to taste or preference for other men because they share similar characteristics, men in these positions of power are more likely to hire or promote other men, thus discriminating against women.&lt;ref name="Stratification"/&gt;

{{See also|Sex differences in crime}}
Sonja B. Starr conducted a study in the US that found that the prison sentences that men serve are on average 63% longer than those that women serve when controlling for arrest offense and criminal history. However, the study does not purport to explain why this is the case. Starr does not believe that men are disadvantaged generally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Starr|first1=Sonja|title=Estimating Gender Disparities In Federal Criminal Cases|journal=Law and Economics Research Paper Series|date=August 2012|volume=12|issue=18|page=17|ssrn=2144002}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Men's rights]] advocates have argued that men being over-represented in both those who commit murder and the victims of murder is evidence that men are being harmed by outmoded cultural attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Woolf|first1=Quentin|title=Our attitude to violence against men is out of date|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/10752232/Our-attitude-to-violence-against-men-is-out-of-date.html|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In television and film ==
The [[New York Film Academy]] took a closer look at the women in Hollywood and gathered statistics from the top 500 films from 2007 to 2012, for their history and achievements, or lack of.

There was a 5:1 ratio of men to women working in films. 30.8% of women having speaking characters, who may or may not have been a part of the 28.8% of women who were written to wear revealing clothing compared to the 7% of men who did, or the 26.2% of women who wore little to no clothing opposed to the 9.4% of men who did the same.&lt;ref name="Gender Inequality in Film"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gender Inequality in Film|url=https://www.nyfa.edu/film-school-blog/gender-inequality-in-film/|website=New York Film Academy Blog|accessdate=10/4/2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study analyzing five years of text from over 2,000 news sources found a similar 5:1 ratio of male to female names overall, and 3:1 for names in entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Shor | first1=E. | last2=van de Rijt | first2=A. | last3 = Miltsov | first3 = A. | last4 = Kulkarni | first4 = Vivek | last5 = Skiena | first5 = S. | year=2015 |title=A Paper Ceiling: Explaining the Persistent Underrepresentation of Women in Printed News | url=https://www.mcgill.ca/sociology/files/sociology/2015_-_asr.pdf |journal = American Sociological Review |volume=80 |issue=5|pages=960–984 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2013 [[Academy Awards]], 140 men were nominated for an award, but only 35 women were nominated. No woman was nominated for directing, cinematography, film editing, writing (original screenplay), or original score that year. Since the Academy Awards began in 1929, only seven women producers have won the Best Picture category (all of whom were co-producers with men), and only eight women have been nominated for Best Original Screenplay. [[Lina Wertmuller]] (1976), [[Jane Campion]] (1994), [[Sofia Coppola]] (2004), and [[Kathryn Bigelow]] (2012) were the only four women to be nominated for Best Director, with Bigelow being the first woman to win for her film ''[[The Hurt Locker]]''. 77%  of the Academy Awards' voters are male.&lt;ref name="Gender Inequality in Film"/&gt;

A group of Hollywood actors have launched their own social movement titled #AskMoreOfHim. This movement is built on the basis of men speaking out against sexual misconduct against females.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gse.harvard.edu/news/18/02/harvard-edcast-ask-more-him|title=Harvard Edcast Ask More of Him|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   A number of male activists, specifically in the film industry, have signed an open letter explaining their responsibility in the ownership of their actions, as well as calling out the actions of others. The letter has been signed and supported by Friends actor David Schwimmer, shown above, among many others. The Hollywood Reporter published their support saying, “We applaud the courage and pledge our support to the courageous women — and men, and gender non-conforming individuals — who have come forward to recount their experiences of harassment, abuse and violence at the hands of men in our country. As men, we have a special responsibility to prevent abuse from happening in the first place... After all, the vast majority of sexual harassment, abuse and violence is perpetrated by men, whether in Hollywood or not.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/david-arquette-david-schwimmer-join-hollywood- men-activists-launch-askmoreofhim-campaign-1090121|title=David Schwimmer Join Hollywood Men and Activists to Launch #AskMoreOfHim Campaign|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This accountability is set to change the way women are seen and treated in the film and television industry, hopefully ending in the closing of the gap women are experiencing in pay, promotion, and overall respect. This initiative was created in response to the #MeToo movement. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/news/2018/01/31/445669/politics-policy-turning-corner-sexual-harassment/|title=Politics Turning Corner on Sexual Harassment|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The #MeToo movement, started by a single tweet, asked women to share their stories of sexual assault against men in a professional setting. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/metoo-hashtag-becomes-anti-sexual-harassment-assault-rallying-cry-n810986|title=Me Too Anti Sexual Harassment|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within one day, 30,000 women had used the hashtag sharing their stories.

== Impact and counteractions ==
Gender inequality and discrimination are argued to cause and perpetuate poverty and [[social vulnerability|vulnerability]] in society as a whole.&lt;ref name=ODI1&gt;Nicola Jones, Rebecca Holmes, Jessica Espey 2008. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=2386&amp;title=gender-mdgs-gender-lens-vital-pro-poor-results Gender and the MDGs: A gender lens is vital for pro-poor results]. London: [[Overseas Development Institute]]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310100258/http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=2386&amp;title=gender-mdgs-gender-lens-vital-pro-poor-results |date=March 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Household and intra-household knowledge and resources are key influences in individuals' abilities to take advantage of external livelihood opportunities or respond appropriately to threats.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; High education levels and social integration significantly improve the productivity of all members of the household and improve equity throughout society. Gender Equity Indices seek to provide the tools to demonstrate this feature of [[poverty]].&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

Poverty has many different factors, one of which is the gender wage gap.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}  Women are more likely to be living in poverty and the wage gap is one of the causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2016/demo/p60-256.html|title=Income and Poverty in the United States: 2015|last=Bureau|first=US Census|website=www.census.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many difficulties in creating a comprehensive response.&lt;ref name=ODI2&gt;Nicola Jones and Rebecca Holmes 2010. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4943&amp;title=gender-politics-social-protection Gender, politics and social protection]. London: [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is argued{{By whom|date=March 2016}} that the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) fail to acknowledge gender inequality as a cross-cutting issue.  Gender is mentioned in MDG3 and MDG5: MDG3 measures gender parity in education, the share of women in wage employment and the proportion women in national legislatures.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;  MDG5 focuses on maternal mortality and on universal access to reproductive health.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;  These targets are significantly off-track.&lt;ref name=ODI2/&gt;

Addressing gender inequality through [[social protection]] programmes designed to increase [[Gender equity|equity]] would be an effective way of reducing gender inequality, according to the [[Overseas Development Institute]] (ODI).&lt;ref name=ODI2/&gt; Researchers at the ODI argue for the need to develop the following in social protection in order to reduce gender inequality and increase growth:&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;
* Community childcare to give women greater opportunities to seek employment
* Support parents with the care costs (e.g. South African child/disability grants)
* Education stipends for girls (e.g. Bangladesh’s Girls Education Stipend scheme)
* Awareness-raising regarding [[gender-based violence]], and other preventive measures, such as financial support for women and children escaping abusive environments (e.g. NGO pilot initiatives in Ghana)
* Inclusion of programme participants (women and men) in designing and evaluating social protection programmes
* Gender-awareness and analysis training for programme staff
* Collect and distribute information on coordinated care and service facilities (e.g. access to [[micro-credit]] and micro-entrepreneurial training for women)
* Developing monitoring and evaluation systems that include sex-disaggregated data
The ODI maintains that society limits governments' ability to act on economic incentives.&lt;ref name=ODI2/&gt;

NGOs tend to protect women against gender inequality and [[structural violence]].

During war, combatants primarily target men.  Both sexes die however, due to disease, malnutrition and incidental crime and violence, as well as the battlefield injuries which predominately affect men.&lt;ref&gt;Ormhaug ''et al'' say "In a widely respected study on war mortality in Kosovo, Spiegel and Salama (2000) found that men were 8.9 times more likely to die from war-related trauma than women, which coincides with men being systematically targeted."&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2009 review  of papers and data covering war related deaths disaggregated by gender concluded "It appears to be difficult to say whether more men or women die from conflict conditions overall."&lt;ref name="Ormhaug"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Armed Conflict Deaths Disaggregated by Gender |author=Christin Ormhaug, in collaboration with Patrick Meier and Helga Hernes|publisher=PRIO|date=23 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ratio also depends on the type of war, for example in the [[Falklands War]] 904 of the 907 dead were men.  Conversely figures for war deaths in 1990, almost all relating to civil war, gave ratios in the order of 1.3 males per female.

Another opportunity to tackle gender inequality is presented by modern [[information and communication technologies]]. In a carefully controlled study,&lt;ref name="HilbertGend2011"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hilbert|first=Martin|date=November–December 2011|title=Digital gender divide or technologically empowered women in developing countries? A typical case of lies, damned lies, and statistics|journal=[[Women's Studies International Forum]]|volume=34|issue=6|pages=479–489|doi=10.1016/j.wsif.2011.07.001|postscript=.|ref=harv}} [http://martinhilbert.net/DigitalGenderDivide.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; it has been shown that women embrace digital technology more than men.  Given that digital information and communication technologies have the potential to provide access to employment, education, income, health services, participation, protection, and safety, among others ([[ICT4D]]), the natural affinity of women with these new communication tools provide women with a tangible bootstrapping opportunity to tackle social discrimination.

{{Main|Global Gender Gap Report}}
Gender inequality is a result of the persistent discrimination of one group of people based upon gender and it manifests itself differently according to race, culture, politics, country, and economic situation.  It is furthermore considered a causal factor of violence against women.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}   While gender discrimination happens to both men and women in individual situations, discrimination against women is an entrenched, global pandemic.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}  In the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], rape and violence against women and girls is used as a tool of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gettleman|first=Jeffrey|title=Rape Epidemic Raises Trauma of Congo War|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/07/world/africa/07congo.html?ref=congothedemocratirepublicof|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=February 16, 2011|date=October 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|date=March 2016}}  In Afghanistan, girls have had acid thrown in their faces for attending school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Filins|first=Dexter|title=A School Bus for Shamsia|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/23/magazine/23school-t.htm|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=February 16, 2011|date=August 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Considerable focus has been given to the issue of gender inequality at the international level by organizations such as the [[United Nations]] (UN), the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), and the [[World Bank]], particularly in developing countries.  The causes and effects of gender inequality vary geographically, as do methods for combating it.

===Asia===
{{See also|Sex-selective abortion}}
One example of the continued existence of gender inequality in Asia is the "[[Missing women of China|missing girls]]" phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kristoff|first=Nicholas D.|title=The Women's Crusade|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/23/magazine/23Women-t.html|date=August 23, 2009|website=New York Times|accessdate=February 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Many families desire male children in order to ensure an extra source of income. In China, females are perceived as less valuable for labor and unable to provide sustenance." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Xie|first1=Kevin|title=The Missing Girls from China|journal=Harvard International Review|date=Fall 2014 – Winter 2015|volume=36|issue=2|pages=33–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, gender inequality also reflected in educational aspect in rural China . Gender inequality existed because of gender stereotypes in rural China, families may consider that is useless for girls to acquire knowledge at school because they will marry someone one day and their major responsibility is to take care of housework.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hannum|first=Emily|last2=Kong|first2=Peggy|last3=Zhang|first3=Yuping|title=Family sources of educational gender inequality in rural China: A critical assessment|journal=International Journal of Educational Development|volume=29|issue=5|pages=474–486|doi=10.1016/j.ijedudev.2009.04.007|pmid=20161037|pmc=2753976|year=2009|url=http://opendocs.ids.ac.uk/opendocs/handle/123456789/12627}}&lt;/ref&gt; When people have expectations on the gender roles, that considering marriage is the major goals of a girl's life in rural China, gender inequality easily existed to limit the rights and opportunities of women.

=== Cambodia ===
A Cambodian said, "Men are gold, women are white cloth", emphasizing that women had a lower value and importance compared to men.&lt;ref name="opendemocracy.net"/&gt; In Cambodia, approximately 15% (485,000 hectares) of land was owned by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/gender/Jordan_Mar2012/Presentations/Panel%201.a/Panel%201.a_3_Cambodia.pdf|title=Measuring Women Status And Gender Statistics in Cambodia Through the Surveys and Census|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=National Institute of Statistics (NIS), Ministry of Planning|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Asian culture, there is a stereotype that women usually have lower status than men because males carry on the family name and hold the responsibilities to take care of the family. Females have a less important role, mainly to carry out domestic chores, and taking care of husbands and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.coedu.usf.edu/zalaquett/mcdp/Asian%20handout.htm|title=Characteristics of  the Traditional Asian Family|website=www.coedu.usf.edu|access-date=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women are also the main victims of  poverty as they have little or no access to education, low pay and low chances owning assets such as lands, homes or even basic items.&lt;ref name="opendemocracy.net"/&gt;

=== Europe ===
The Global Gender Gap Report put out by the [[World Economic Forum]] (WEF) in 2013 ranks nations on a scale of 0 to 1, with a score of 1.0 indicating full gender equality. A nation with 35 women and 65 men in political office would get a score of 0.538 as the WEF is measuring the gap between the two figures and not the actual percentage of women in a given category. While Europe holds the top four spots for gender equality, with [[Iceland]], [[Finland]], [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] ranking 1st through 4th respectively, it also contains two nations ranked in the bottom 30 countries, [[Albania]] at 108 and [[Turkey]] at 120. The [[Nordic countries|Nordic Countries]], for several years, have been at the forefront of bridging the gap in gender inequality. Every Nordic country, aside from [[Denmark]] who is at 0.778, has reached above a 0.800 score. In contrast to the Nordic nations, the countries of Albania and Turkey continue to struggle with gender inequality. Albania and Turkey failed to break the top 100 nations in 2 of 4 and 3 of 4 factors, respectively. However, despite the disparity, European nations continue to make advances in the many factors that are used to determine a nation's gender gap score.&lt;ref name="The Global Gender Gap Report 2013" /&gt;

==== Western Europe ====
[[Western Europe]], a region most often described as comprising the non-communist members of post-WWII Europe,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stylemanual.natgeo.com/home/E/europe-geographical-and-political|title=EUROPE, GEOGRAPHICAL AND POLITICAL - National Geographic Style Manual|website=stylemanual.natgeo.com|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; has, for the most part been doing well in eliminating the gender gap. Western Europe holds 12 of the top 20 spots on the Global Gender Gap Report for overall score. While remaining mostly in the top 50 nations, four Western European nations fall below that benchmark. [[Portugal]] is just outside of the top 50 at number 51 with score of 0.706 while Italy (71), Greece (81) and Malta (84) received scores of 0.689, 0.678 and 0.676, respectively.&lt;ref name="The Global Gender Gap Report 2013" /&gt;

==== Eastern Europe ====
A large portion of [[Eastern Europe]], a region most often described as the former communist members of post-WWII Europe,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; resides between 40th and 100th place in the Global Gender Gap Report. A few outlier countries include [[Lithuania]], which jumped nine places (37th to 28th) from 2011 to 2013, [[Latvia]], which has held the 12th spot for two consecutive years, Albania and Turkey.&lt;ref name="The Global Gender Gap Report 2013" /&gt;

===India===
{{main|Gender inequality in India}}
India ranking remains low in gender equality measures by the World Economic Forum, although the rank has been improving in recent years.&lt;ref name="The Global Gender Gap Report 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GenderGap_Report_2011.pdf 2011 Gender Gap Report] World Economic Forum, page 9&lt;/ref&gt; When broken down into components that contribute the rank, India performs well on political empowerment, but is scored near the bottom with China on [[sex selective abortion]]. India also scores poorly on overall female to male [[literacy]] and health rankings.

The [[World Economic Forum]] measures gender equity through a series of economic, educational, and political benchmarks.  It has ranked the United States as 19th (up from 31st in 2009) in terms of achieving gender equity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=World Economic Forum|year=2009|volume=Global Gender Gap Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The US Department of Labor has indicated that in 2009, "the median weekly earnings of women who were full-time wage and salary workers was... 80 percent of men's".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quick Stats on Women Workers |url=http://www.dol.gov/wb/stats/main.htm |website=U.S. Department of Labor |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426194948/http://www.dol.gov/wb/stats/main.htm |archivedate=April 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Department of Justice found that in 2009, "the percentage of female victims (26%) of intimate partner violence was about 5 times that of male victims (5%)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Crime Victimization Survey, 2010|publisher=Bureau of Justice Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "The United States ranks 41st in a ranking of 184 countries on maternal deaths during pregnancy and childbirth, below all other industrialized nations and a number of developing countries"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CEDAW 2011 website|url=http://www.cedaw2010.org/index.php/about-cedaw/cedaw-by-the-numbers|accessdate=February 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and women only represent 20% of members of Congress.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==== Political affiliations and behaviors ====
Existing research on the topic of gender/sex and politics has found differences in political affiliation, beliefs, and voting behavior between men and women, although these differences vary across cultures. Gender is omnipresent in every culture, and while there are many factors to consider when labeling people "Democrat" or "Republican"—such as race and religion—gender is especially prominent in politics.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Croucher|first=Stephen M.|last2=Spencer|first2=Anthony T.|last3=McKee|first3=Connie|date=2014-03-15|title=Religion, Religiosity, Sex, and Willingness to Express Political Opinions: A Spiral of Silence Analysis of the 2008 U.S. Presidential Election|journal=Atlantic Journal of Communication|volume=22|issue=2|pages=111–123|doi=10.1080/15456870.2014.890001|issn=1545-6870}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender in Communication: A Critical Introduction|last=DeFrancisco|first=Victoria Pruin|last2=Palczewski|first2=Catherine Helen|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4522-2009-3|location=Los Angeles|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studying gender and political behavior poses challenges, as it can be difficult to determine if men and women actually differ in substantial ways in their political views and voting behavior, or if biases and stereotypes about gender cause people to make assumptions.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ditonto|first=Tessa M.|last2=Hamilton|first2=Allison J.|last3=Redlawsk|first3=David P.|date=2013-05-14|title=Gender Stereotypes, Information Search, and Voting Behavior in Political Campaigns|journal=Political Behavior|language=en|volume=36|issue=2|pages=335–358|doi=10.1007/s11109-013-9232-6|issn=0190-9320}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, trends in voting behavior among men and women have been proven through research.

Research shows that women in postindustrial countries like the United States, Canada, and Germany primarily identified as conservative before the 1960s; however, as time has progressed and new waves of feminism have occurred, women have become more left-wing due to shared beliefs and values between women and parties more on the left.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Inglehart|first=Ronald|last2=Norris|first2=Pippa|date=2000-01-01|title=The Developmental Theory of the Gender Gap: Women's and Men's Voting Behavior in Global Perspective|journal=International Political Science Review / Revue Internationale de Science Politique|volume=21|issue=4|pages=441–463|jstor=1601598|doi=10.1177/0192512100214007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women in these countries typically oppose war and the death penalty, favor gun control, support environment protection, and are more supportive of programs that help people of lower socioeconomic statuses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Voting behaviors of men have not experienced as drastic of a shift over the last fifty years as women in their voting behavior and political affiliations. These behaviors tend to consistently be more conservative than women overall.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These trends change with every generation, and factors such as culture, race, and religion also must be considered when discussing political affiliation. These factors make the connection between gender and political affiliation complex due to intersectionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender in Communication: A Critical Introduction|last=DeFrancisco|first=Victoria Pruin|last2=Palczewski|first2=Catherine Helen|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4522-2009-3|location=Los Angeles|pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Candidate gender also plays a role in voting behavior. Women candidates are far more likely than male candidates to be scrutinized and have their competence questioned by both men and women when they are seeking information on candidates in the beginning stages of election campaigns.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Democrat male voters tend to seek more information about female Democrat candidates over male Democrat candidates. Female Republican voters tend to seek more information about female Republican candidates.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For this reason, female candidates in either party typically need to work harder to prove themselves competent more than their male counterparts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Challenges to women in politics ====
Overall, [[politics in the United States]] are dominated by men, which can pose many challenges to women who decide to enter the political sphere.  As the number of women participants in politics continue to increase around the world, the gender of female candidates serves as both a benefit and a hindrance within their campaign themes and advertising practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Yu-Kang|date=2014|title=Gender stereotypes as a double-edged sword in political advertising Persuasion effects of campaign theme and advertising style|url=|journal=International Journal of Advertising|doi=10.2501/IJA-33-2-203-234|pmid=|access-date=|volume=33|issue=2|pages=203–234}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overarching challenge seems to be that—no matter their actions—women are unable to win in the political sphere as different standards are used to judge them when compared to their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hillary Clinton in the News: Gender and Authenticity in American Politics|last=Parry-Giles|first=Shawn|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=Champaign|pages=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One area in particular that exemplifies varying perceptions between male and female candidates is the way female candidates decide to dress and how their choice is evaluated. When women decide to dress more masculine, they are perceived as being "conspicuous." When they decide to dress more feminine, they are perceived as "deficient."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flicker|first=Eva|date=2013|title=Fashionable (dis-)order in politics: Gender, power and the dilemma of the suit|url=|journal=International Journal of Media &amp; Cultural Politics|doi=10.1386/macp.9.2.201_3|pmid=|access-date=|volume=9|issue=2|pages=201–219}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, however, women in politics are generally expected to adhere to the masculine standard, thereby validating the idea that gender is binary and that power is associated with masculinity.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Charles|first=Nickie|date=2014-07-01|title=Doing Gender, Practising Politics: Workplace Cultures in Local and Devolved Government|journal=Gender, Work &amp; Organization|language=en|volume=21|issue=4|pages=368–380|doi=10.1111/gwao.12042|issn=1468-0432}}&lt;/ref&gt; As illustrated by the points above, these simultaneous, mixed messages create a "double-bind" for women. Some scholars go on to claim that this masculine standard represents symbolic violence against women in politics.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Political knowledge is a second area where male and female candidates are evaluated differently and where political science research has consistently shown women with a lower level of knowledge than their male counterparts.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dolan|first=Kathleen|date=2011-01-01|title=Do Women and Men Know Different Things? Measuring Gender Differences in Political Knowledge|journal=The Journal of Politics|volume=73|issue=1|pages=97–107|doi=10.1017/S0022381610000897|issn=0022-3816}}&lt;/ref&gt; One reason for this finding is the argument that there are different areas of political knowledge that different groups consider.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carpini|first=Michael|last2=Keeter|first2=Scott|year=1993|title=Measuring Political Knowledge: Putting First Things First|jstor=2111549|journal=American Journal of Political Science|volume=37|issue=4|pages=1179–1206|doi=10.2307/2111549|pmid=|url=https://repository.upenn.edu/asc_papers/24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this line of thought, scholars are advocating the replacement of traditional political knowledge with gender-relevant political knowledge because women are not as politically disadvantaged as it may appear.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

A third area that affects women's engagement in politics is their low level of political interest and perception of politics as a "men's game."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=Robert G.|date=2005-12-01|title=Religion, Race, and Gender Differences in Political Ambition|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S1743923X05050154|journal=Politics &amp; Gender|volume=null|issue=4|pages=577–596|doi=10.1017/S1743923X05050154|issn=1743-9248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite female candidates' political contributions being equal to that of male candidates, research has shown that women perceive more barriers to office in the form of rigorous campaigns, less overall recruitment, inability to balance office and family commitments, hesitancy to enter competitive environments, and a general lack of belief in their own merit and competence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lawless|first=Jennifer|last2=Fox|first2=Richard|date=2008|title=Why are women still not running for public office?|url=|journal=Issues in Governance Studies|volume=16|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Male candidates are evaluated most heavily on their achievements, while female candidates are evaluated on their appearance, voice, verbal dexterity, and facial features in addition to their achievements.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Steps needed for change ====
Several forms of action have been taken to combat institutionalized sexism. People are beginning to speak up or "talk back" in a constructive way to expose gender inequality in politics, as well as gender inequality and under-representation in other institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender in Communication: A Critical Introduction|last=DeFrancisco|first=Victoria Pruin|last2=Palczewski|first2=Catherine Helen|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4522-2009-3|location=Los Angeles|pages=117–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers who have delved into the topic of institutionalized sexism in politics have introduced the term "undoing gender." This term focuses on education and an overarching understanding of gender by encouraging "social interactions that reduce gender difference."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Some feminists argue that "undoing gender" is problematic because it is context-dependent and may actually reinforce gender. For this reason, researchers suggest "doing gender differently" by dismantling [[gender norm]]s and expectations in politics, but this can also depend on culture and level of government (e.g. local versus federal).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Another key to combating institutionalized sexism in politics is to diffuse gender norms through "gender-balanced decision-making," particularly at the international level, which "establishes expectations about appropriate levels of women in decision-making positions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Santos|first=Maria|last2=Amancio|first2=Ligia|last3=Alves|first3=Helder|date=2013|title=Gender and politics: The relevance of gender on judgments about the merit of candidates and the fairness of quotas|url=|journal=Portuguese Journal of Social Science|doi=10.1386/pjss.12.2.133_1|pmid=|access-date=|volume=12|issue=2|pages=133–149|hdl=10071/14575}}&lt;/ref&gt; In conjunction with this solution, scholars have started placing emphasis on "the value of the individual and the importance of capturing individual experience." This is done throughout a candidate's political career—whether that candidate is male or female—instead of the collective male or female candidate experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McDermott|first=Rose|date=2013-03-01|title=A Feminist Scientific Approach to the Analysis of Politics and Gender|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S1743923X12000761|journal=Politics &amp; Gender|volume=9|issue=1|pages=110–115|doi=10.1017/S1743923X12000761|issn=1743-9248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five recommended areas of further study for examining the role of gender in U.S. political participation are (1) realizing the "intersection between gender and perceptions"; (2) investigating the influence of "local electoral politics"; (3) examining "gender socialization"; (4) discerning the connection "between gender and political conservatism"; and (5) recognizing the influence of female political role models in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fox|first=Richard L.|date=2011-03-01|title=Studying Gender in U.S. Politics: Where Do We Go from Here?|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S1743923X10000589|journal=Politics &amp; Gender|volume=7|issue=1|pages=94–99|doi=10.1017/S1743923X10000589|issn=1743-9248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the fact that gender is intricately entwined in every societal institution, gender in politics can only change once gender norms in other institutions change, as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2240">'''Gossen's laws''', named for [[Hermann Heinrich Gossen]] (1810 – 1858), are three laws of economics:
* '''Gossen's First Law''' is the [[Law of diminishing marginal utility|"law" of diminishing marginal utility]]: that [[marginal utility|marginal utilities]] are diminishing across the ranges relevant to decision-making.
* '''[[Gossen's second law|Gossen's Second Law]]''', which presumes that [[utility]] is at least weakly quantified, is that in equilibrium an agent will allocate expenditures so that the ratio of marginal utility to price (marginal cost of acquisition) is equal across all [[Good (economics)|goods]] and [[Service (economics)|services]].
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial U/\partial x_i}{p_i}=\frac{\partial U/\partial x_j}{p_j}\,\forall\left(i,j\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:where
:* &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is utility
:* &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; is quantity of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th good or service
:* &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; is the price of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th good or service
* '''Gossen's Third Law''' is that [[scarcity]] is a precondition for economic value.

The citation referenced is the translation by Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen in which the traslator names only two laws: 1) ”If an enjoyment is experienced uninterruptedly, the corresponding intensity of pleasure decreases continuously until satiety is ultimately reached, at which point the intensity becomes nil." and, 2) "A similar decrease of the intensity of pleasure takes place if a previous enjoyment of the same kind of pleasure is repeated. Not only does the initial intensity of pleasure become smaller but also the duration of the enjoyment becomes shorter, so that satiety is reached sooner. Moreover, the sooner the repetition, the smaller becomes the initial intensity as well as the duration of the enjoyment." (p.lxxx)

"'''Haecceity'''" ({{IPAc-en|h|ɛ|k|ˈ|s|iː|ɪ|t|i|,_|h|iː|k|-}}; from the [[Latin]] ''haecceitas'', which translates as "thisness") is a term from [[medieval philosophy|medieval]] [[Scholasticism|scholastic philosophy]], first coined by followers of [[Duns Scotus]] to denote a concept that he seems to have originated: the discrete qualities, properties or characteristics of a thing that make it a ''particular'' thing. Haecceity is a person's or object's ''thisness'', the individualising difference between the concept "a man" and the concept "Socrates" (''i.e.'', a specific person).&lt;ref&gt;[[s:W. H. Gardner|Gardner, W. H.]], ''Gerald Manley Hopkins'' (1975), p. xxiii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology&lt;!--'To ti esti' redirects here--&gt;==
Haecceity is a literal translation of the equivalent term in [[Aristotle]]'s [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] '''''to ti esti'''''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (τὸ τί ἐστι)&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', 1030a&lt;/ref&gt; or "the what (it) is."

[[Charles Sanders Peirce]] later used the term as a non-descriptive reference to an individual.&lt;ref&gt;Bertman, M. A., ''Humanities Insights'' (2007), p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

==Haecceity and quiddity==
Haecceity may be defined in some dictionaries as simply the "essence" of a thing, or as a simple synonym for [[quiddity]] or [[hypokeimenon]]. However, such a definition deprives the term of its subtle distinctiveness and utility. Whereas haecceity refers to aspects of a thing that make it a ''particular'' thing, quiddity refers to the universal qualities of a thing, its "whatness", or the aspects of a thing it may share with other things and by which it may form part of a [[genus]] of things.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Hicks|Hicks, P.]], ''The Journey So Far'' (2003), p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;

Duns Scotus makes the following distinction:

{{quote|Because there is among beings something indivisible into subjective parts—that is, such that it is formally incompatible for it to be divided into several parts each of which is it—the question is not what it is by which such a division is formally incompatible with it (because it is formally incompatible by incompatibility), but rather what it is by which, as by a proximate and intrinsic foundation, this incompatibility is in it. Therefore, the sense of the questions on this topic [viz. of individuation] is: What is it in [''e.g.''] this stone, by which as by a proximate foundation it is absolutely incompatible with the stone for it to be divided into several parts each of which is this stone, the kind of division that is proper to a universal whole as divided into its subjective parts?|Duns Scotus|''Ordinatio'' II, d. 3, p. 1. q. 2, n. 48]}}

While terms such as haecceity, quiddity, [[noumenon]] and hypokeimenon all evoke the [[essence]] of a thing, they each have subtle differences and refer to different aspects of the thing's essence.

Haecceity thus enabled Scotus to find a middle ground in the [[Problem of universals|debate over universals]] between [[Nominalism]] and Realism.&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;

==Haecceity, sociology and philosophy==
The [[The Social Construction of Reality|social construction of reality]], [[ethnomethodology]], and [[conversation analysis]] are the main streams that elaborated during the 1960s a new kind of sociology—which influenced later sociology, philosophy, and political analysis. [[Harold Garfinkel]] is the founder of ethnomethodology, and teacher of Harvey Sacks, one of the founders of conversation analysis. He used the word haecceity in his seminal ''[[Studies in Ethnomethodology]]'' (1963), to enhance the indexical inevitable character of any expression, behavior or situation. According to him, the members display the social order they refer to within the settings of the situation they contribute to define. The study of particular situations in their "haecceity"&amp;nbsp;— aimed at disclosing the ordinary, ongoing social order that is constructed by the members and their practices&lt;ref&gt;Button, G., ed., ''Ethnomethodology and the Human Sciences'' (1991), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;— is the object of ethnomethodology.

In his famous paper generally referred to as "Parson's Plenum" (1988), Garfinkel used the term "Haecceities" to indicate the importance of the infinite [[contingency (philosophy)|contingencies]] in both situations and practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Rawls | first = Ann | contribution = Harold Garfinkel | editor-last = Ritzer | editor-first = George | editor-link = George Ritzer | title = [[The Blackwell Companion to Major Contemporary Social Theorists|The Blackwell companion to major contemporary social theorists]] | publisher = Blackwell | location = Malden, Massachusetts Oxford | year = 2003 | isbn = 9781405105958  | ref = harv | postscript = .}} Also available as: {{Cite journal | last = Rawls | first = Ann | title = Chapter 5. Harold Garfinkel | publisher = Wiley  | date = 2003 | doi = 10.1002/9780470999912.ch6 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/9780470999912.ch6 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405105958_chunk_g97814051059588 Extract.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Garfinkel was drawing on [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and [[Edmund Husserl]], logic and [[Bertrand Russell]], and perception theory and [[Nelson Goodman]]. Phenomenology is the field of studying the phenomena as such, and can thus be seen as a contemporary philosophical version of the medieval concept of haecceity.

[[Gilles Deleuze]] uses the term to denote entities that exist on the [[plane of immanence]]. The usage was likely chosen in line with his esoteric concept of difference and individuation, and critique of object-centered [[metaphysics]].

==Influence==
[[Gerard Manley Hopkins]] drew on Scotus&amp;nbsp;— whom he described as “of reality the rarest-veined unraveller”&lt;ref&gt;''Duns Scotus's Oxford'' quoted in Gardner, p. xxiv&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;— to construct his poetic theory of [[inscape]].

[[James Joyce]] made similar use of the concept of haecceitas to develop his idea of the secular [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Kearney|Kearney, R.]], ''Navigations'' (2007), pp. 133–4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Wood (critic)|James Wood]] refers extensively to haecceitas (as "thisness") in developing an argument about conspicuous detail in aesthetic [[literary criticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Bartosch, R., ''EnvironMentality: Ecocriticism and the Event of Postcolonial Fiction'' ([[Amsterdam]] &amp; [[New York City|New York]]: [[Rodopi (publisher)|Rodopi]], 2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=2QjiAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA270 p. 270].&lt;/ref&gt;

Individualism makes the individual its focus&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt; and so starts "with the fundamental premise that the human individual is of primary importance in the struggle for liberation."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; [[Classical liberalism]], [[existentialism]], and [[anarchism]] are examples of movements that take the human individual as a central unit of analysis.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[L.

==Etymology==
In the [[English language]], the word "individualism" was first introduced, as a pejorative, by the [[Owenism|Owenites]] in the late 1830s, although it is unclear if they were influenced by [[Saint-Simonianism]] or came up with it independently.&lt;ref name="Claeys"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Claeys, Gregory |authorlink=Gregory Claeys |title="Individualism," "Socialism," and "Social Science": Further Notes on a Process of Conceptual Formation, 1800–1850 |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |year=1986 |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=81–93 |doi=10.2307/2709596|jstor=2709596|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more positive use of the term in Britain came to be used with the writings of [[James Elishama Smith]], who was a [[millenarian]] and a [[Christian Israelite]]. Although an early [[Robert Owen|Owenite]] socialist, he eventually rejected its collective idea of property, and found in individualism a "universalism" that allowed for the development of the "original genius." Without individualism, Smith argued, individuals cannot amass property to increase one's happiness.&lt;ref name="Claeys"/&gt; [[William Maccall]], another [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] preacher, and probably an acquaintance of Smith, came somewhat later, although influenced by [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Thomas Carlyle]], and [[Romanticism|German Romanticism]], to the same positive conclusions, in his 1847 work "Elements of Individualism".&lt;ref name="Swart"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Swart, Koenraad W. |author-link=Koenraad W. Swart |title="Individualism" in the Mid-Nineteenth Century (1826–1860) |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |year=1962 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=77–90 |doi=10.2307/2708058|jstor=2708058|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The individual==
{{Main|Individual}}
An individual is a person or any specific object in a collection. In the 15th century and earlier, and also today within the fields of [[statistics]] and [[metaphysics]], individual means "indivisible", typically describing any numerically singular thing, but sometimes meaning "a person." (q.v. "The problem of [[proper name]]s"). From the 17th century on, individual indicates separateness, as in individualism.&lt;ref&gt;Abbs 1986, cited in Klein 2005, pp. 26–27&lt;/ref&gt; Individuality is the state or quality of being an individuated being; a person separated from everything with unique character by possessing his or her own needs, goals, and desires in comparison to other persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gerald N. Izenberg|title=Impossible Individuality: Romanticism, Revolution, and the Origins of Modern Selfhood, 1787-1802|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TQ60DyQi8mYC&amp;pg=PA18|date=3 June 1992|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=1-4008-2066-9|pages=18+}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Individuation principle  ===
{{main|Individuation}}
The principle of individuation
, or ''{{lang|la|principium individuationis}}'',&lt;ref name=Reese&gt;{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Philosophy and Religion |last=Reese |first=William L. |edition=1st |year=1980 |publisher=Humanities Press |location=Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey |isbn=0-391-00688-6 |page=251}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes the manner in which a thing is identified as distinguished from other things.&lt;ref name=Cambridge&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy |editor1-last= Audi |editor1-first=Robert |edition= 2nd |year= 1999|publisher= Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-63136-X |page=424}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Carl Jung]], individuation is a process of transformation, whereby the personal and [[collective unconscious]] is brought into consciousness (by means of dreams, [[active imagination]] or [[free association (psychology)|free association]] to takexamples) to be assimilated into the whole personality. It is a completely natural process necessary for the integration of the psyche to take place.&lt;ref name="jung1"&gt;Jung, C. G. (1962). Symbols of Transformation: An analysis of the prelude to a case of schizophrenia (Vol. 2, R. F. C. Hull, Trans.). New York: Harper &amp; Brothers.&lt;/ref&gt; Jung considered individuation to be the central process of human development.&lt;ref name="Jung's Individuation process"&gt;[http://soultherapynow.com/articles/individuation.html Jung's Individuation process] Retrieved on 2009-2-20&lt;/ref&gt; In ''L'individuation psychique et collective'', [[Gilbert Simondon]] developed a theory of individual and collective individuation in which the individual subject is considered as an effect of individuation rather than a cause. Thus, the individual atom is replaced by a never-ending [[Process philosophy|ontological process]] of individuation. Individuation is an always incomplete process, always leaving a "pre-individual" left-over, itself making possible future individuations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gilbert Simondon]]. ''L'individuation psychique et collective'' (Paris, Aubier, 1989; reprinted in 2007 with a preface by Bernard Stiegler)&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophy of [[Bernard Stiegler]] draws upon and modifies the work of [[Gilbert Simondon]] on individuation and also upon similar ideas in [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Sigmund Freud]]. For Stiegler "the ''I'', as a psychic individual, can only be thought in relationship to ''we'', which is a collective individual. The ''I'' is constituted in adopting a collective tradition, which it inherits and in which a plurality of ''I''&amp;nbsp;'s acknowledge each other's existence."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/video/bernard-stiegler-culture-and-technology Bernard Stiegler: Culture and Technology], tate.org.uk, 13 May 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Individualism and society==
Individualism holds that a person taking part in society attempts to learn and discover what his or her own interests are on a personal basis, without a presumed following of the interests of a societal structure (an individualist need not be an [[Egotism|egoist]]). The individualist does not follow one particular philosophy, rather creates an amalgamation of elements of many, based on personal interests in particular aspects that he/she finds of use. On a societal level, the individualist participates on a personally structured political and moral ground. Independent thinking and opinion is a common trait of an individualist. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], claims that his concept of "[[general will]]" in the "[[Social Contract (Rousseau)|social contract]]" is not the simple collection of individual wills and that it furthers the interests of the individual (the constraint of law itself would be beneficial for the individual, as the lack of respect for the law necessarily entails, in Rousseau's eyes, a form of [[ignorance]] and submission to one's [[Passion (emotion)|passions]] instead of the preferred [[wikt:autonomy|autonomy]] of [[reason]]).

Societies and groups can differ in the extent to which they are based upon predominantly "self-regarding" (individualistic, and/or self-interested) behaviors, rather than "other-regarding" (group-oriented, and group, or society-minded) behaviors. [[Ruth Benedict]] made a distinction, relevant in this context, between [[Guilt society|"guilt" societies]] (e.g., [[medieval Europe]]) with an "internal reference standard", and [[Shame society|"shame" societies]] (e.g., Japan, "bringing shame upon one's ancestors") with an "external reference standard", where people look to their peers for feedback on whether an action is "acceptable" or not.&lt;ref&gt;"The Chrysanthemum and the Sword: Patterns of Japanese Culture." Rutland, VT and Tokyo, Japan: Charles E. Tuttle Co. 1954 orig. 1946.&lt;/ref&gt;

Individualism is often contrasted&lt;ref name="Hayek 1994 17, 37–48"/&gt; either with [[totalitarianism]] or with [[collectivism]], but in fact, there is a spectrum of behaviors at the societal level ranging from highly individualistic societies through mixed societies to collectivist.

===Methodological individualism===
[[Methodological individualism]] is the view that phenomena can only be understood by examining how they result from the motivations and actions of individual agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2015/entries/methodological-individualism/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Joseph|last=Heath|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=1 January 2015|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In economics, people's behavior is explained in terms of rational choices, as constrained by prices and incomes. The economist accepts individuals' preferences as givens. [[Gary Becker|Becker]] and [[George Stigler|Stigler]] provide a forceful statement of this view:&lt;blockquote&gt;On the traditional view, an explanation of economic phenomena that reaches a difference in tastes between people or times is the terminus of the argument: the problem is abandoned at this point to whoever studies and explains tastes (psychologists? anthropologists? phrenologists? sociobiologists?). On our preferred interpretation, one never reaches this impasse: the economist continues to search for differences in prices or incomes to explain any differences or changes in behavior.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stigler|first=George|author2=Gary Becker|date=Mar 1977|title=De gustibus non est disputandum|journal=American Economic Review|volume=67|issue=2|page=76|jstor=1807222}}&lt;/ref&gt;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Competitive individualism===
It is a form of individualism that arises from competitive systems. The function of the system is to maintain an inequality in the society and fields of human engagement. This pins the ups and downs of a person's life onto themselves by not acknowledging a range of factors like influence of socioeconomic class, race, gender, etc. It supports the privilege theories that affirms position of certain individuals higher in the hierarchy of ranks at the expense of others. For better individuality cooperation is considered to be a better remedy for personal growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nancy Schniedewind|author2=Ellen Davidson|title=Open Minds to Equality: A Sourcebook of Learning Activities to Affirm Diversity and Promote Equity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nbc1aqFD88cC&amp;pg=PA23|year=2006|publisher=Rethinking Schools|isbn=978-0-942961-32-4|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political individualism==
{{quote box|align=right|width=30%|quote=With the abolition of private property, then, we shall have true, beautiful, healthy Individualism. Nobody will waste his life in accumulating things, and the symbols for things. One will live. To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist, that is all.|source=[[Oscar Wilde]], ''[[The Soul of Man under Socialism]]'', 1891}}

Individualists are chiefly concerned with protecting individual autonomy against obligations imposed by social institutions (such as the state or religious morality). For [[L. Susan Brown]] "Liberalism and anarchism are two political philosophies that are fundamentally concerned with individual [[Freedom of will|freedom]] yet differ from one another in very distinct ways. Anarchism shares with liberalism a radical commitment to individual freedom while rejecting liberalism's competitive property relations."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[Civil libertarianism]] is a strain of political thought that supports civil liberties, or which emphasizes the supremacy of [[individual rights]] and [[personal freedom]]s over and against any kind of authority (such as a [[State (polity)|state]], a [[corporation]], social norms imposed through [[peer pressure]], etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/civil%20libertarian?r=14|title=the definition of civil libertarian|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Civil libertarianism is not a complete [[ideology]]; rather, it is a collection of views on the specific issues of [[civil liberties]] and [[civil rights]]. Because of this, a civil libertarian outlook is compatible with many other political philosophies, and civil libertarianism is found on both the [[Right-wing politics|right]] and [[Left-wing politics|left]] in modern politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://politicalcompass.org/analysis2|title=The Political Compass|first=The Political|last=Compass|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For scholar [[Ellen Meiksins Wood]] "there are doctrines of individualism that are opposed to [[John Locke|Lockean individualism]] ... and non-lockean individualism may encompass [[socialism]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ellen Meiksins Wood]]. ''Mind and Politics: An Approach to the Meaning of Liberal and Socialist Individualism''. [[University of California Press]]. 1972.  {{ISBN|0-520-02029-4}}. p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

British Historians Emily Robinson, Camilla Schofield, Florence Sutcliffe-Braithwaite, and Natalie Thomlinson have argued that by the 1970s Britons were keen about defining and claiming their individual rights, identities and perspectives.  They demanded greater personal autonomy and self-determination and less outside control. They angrily complained that the 'establishment' was withholding it.  They argue this shift in concerns helped cause [[Thatcherism]], and was incorporated into Thatcherism's appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Emily Robinson, et al. "Telling stories about post-war Britain:  popular individualism and the 'crisis' of the 1970s." ''Twentieth Century British History'' 28.2 (2017): 268-304.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liberalism===
{{main|Liberalism}}
{{Liberalism sidebar |Ideas}}
Liberalism (from the Latin ''liberalis'', "of freedom; worthy of a free man, gentlemanlike, courteous, generous")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.nd.edu/cgi-bin/lookup.pl?stem=liberalis&amp;ending=|title=Latin Word Lookup|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the belief in the importance of individual freedom. This belief is widely accepted in the United States, Europe, Australia and other [[Western world|Western]] nations, and was recognized as an important value by many Western philosophers throughout history, in particular since [[the Enlightenment]]. It is often rejected by collectivist, Islamic, or [[confucian]] societies in [[Asia]] or the [[Middle East]] (though [[Taoist]]s were and are known to be individualists).&lt;ref&gt;The Ancient Chinese Super State of Primary Societies: Taoist Philosophy for the 21st Century, You-Sheng Li, June 2010, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] wrote praising "the idea of a polity administered with regard to equal rights and equal freedom of speech, and the idea of a kingly government which respects most of all the freedom of the governed".&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Aurelius, ''Meditations'', Oxford University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-19-954059-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For all intents and purposes, liberalism here refers to classical liberalism and should not be confused with [[modern liberalism in the United States]],.&lt;ref&gt;John C.

Liberalism has its roots in the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and rejects many [[Foundationalism|foundational]] assumptions that dominated most earlier theories of government, such as the [[Divine Right of Kings]], hereditary status, and [[state religion|established religion]]. [[John Locke]] is often credited with the philosophical foundations of [[classical liberalism]]. He wrote "no one ought to harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions."&lt;ref name = "locke"&gt;{{cite book | last = Locke | first = John | title = Two Treatises of Government (10th edition) | publisher = [[Project Gutenberg]] | year = 1690 | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/trgov10h.htm | accessdate = January 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century, liberal ideas began to influence governments in Europe, in nations such as The Netherlands, Switzerland, England and Poland, but they were strongly opposed, often by armed might, by those who favored absolute monarchy and established religion. In the 18th century, in America, the first modern liberal state was founded, without a monarch or a hereditary aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Paul E. Sigmund, editor, ''The Selected Political Writings of John Locke'', Norton, 2003, {{ISBN|0-393-96451-5}} p. iv "(Locke's thoughts) underlie many of the fundamental political ideas of American liberal constitutional democracy...", "At the time Locke wrote, his principles were accepted in theory by a few and in practice by none."&lt;/ref&gt; The American ''Declaration of Independence'' includes the words (which echo Locke) "all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are [[life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness]]; that to insure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the [[consent of the governed]]."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Jefferson, ''Declaration of Independence'', July 4, 1776.&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberalism comes in many forms. According to [[John N. Gray]], the essence of liberalism is toleration of different beliefs and of different ideas as to what constitutes a good life.&lt;ref&gt;John Gray, ''Two Faces of Liberalism'', The New Press, 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-56584-678-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authority, takes many shapes, but, broadly speaking, her enemies divide themselves into three classes: first, those who abhor her both as a means and as an end of progress, opposing her openly, avowedly, sincerely, consistently, universally; second, those who profess to believe in her as a means of progress, but who accept her only so far as they think she will subserve their own selfish interests, denying her and her blessings to the rest of the world; third, those who distrust her as a means of progress, believing in her only as an end to be obtained by first trampling upon, violating, and outraging her. These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity. Good representatives of the first are seen in the Catholic Church and the Russian autocracy; of the second, in the Protestant Church and the Manchester school of politics and political economy; of the third, in the atheism of Gambetta and the socialism of Karl Marx."

For influential Italian anarchist [[Errico Malatesta]] "All anarchists, whatever tendency they belong to, are individualists in some way or other. But the opposite is not true; not by any means. The individualists are thus divided into two distinct categories: one which claims the right to full development for all human individuality, their own and that of others; the other which only thinks about its own individuality and has absolutely no hesitation in sacrificing the individuality of others. The Tsar of all the Russias belongs to the latter category of individualists. We belong to the former."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Various_Authors__Anarchy_and_Organization__The_Debate_at_the_1907_International_Anarchist_Congress.html#toc2|title=Anarchy and Organization: The Debate at the 1907 International Anarchist Congress - The Anarchist Library|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Individualist anarchism====
{{Main|Individualist anarchism}}
Individualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasize the individual and their [[will (philosophy)|will]] over any kinds of external determinants such as groups, society, traditions, and ideological systems.&lt;ref name="ryner"&gt;"What do I mean by individualism?
I mean by individualism the moral doctrine which, relying on no dogma, [[loss of tradition|no tradition]], no external determination, appeals only to the individual conscience."[https://www.marxists.org/archive/ryner/1905/mini-manual.htm ''Mini-Manual of Individualism'' by Han Ryner]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tucker"&gt;"I do not admit anything except the existence of the individual, as a condition of his sovereignty. To say that the sovereignty of the individual is conditioned by Liberty is simply another way of saying that it is conditioned by itself." "Anarchism and the State" in ''Individual Liberty''&lt;/ref&gt; Individualist anarchism is not a single philosophy but refers to a group of individualistic philosophies that sometimes are in conflict.

In 1793, [[William Godwin]], who has often&lt;ref&gt;Everhart, Robert B. The Public School Monopoly: A Critical Analysis of Education and the State in American Society. Pacific Institute for Public Policy Research, 1982. p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; been cited as the first anarchist, wrote ''[[Political Justice]]'', which some consider to be the first expression of anarchism.&lt;ref name="godwinsep" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Ian. Political Ideology Today. Manchester University Press, 2001. p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;
Godwin, a philosophical anarchist, from a [[Rationalism|rationalist]] and [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] basis opposed revolutionary action and saw a [[Limited government|minimal state]] as a present "necessary evil" that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge.&lt;ref name="godwinsep"&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=godwin |title=William Godwin |last=Philip  |first=Mark|date=2006-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Enquiry Concerning Political Justice and its Influence on Modern Morals and Manners |last=Godwin |first=William |authorlink=William Godwin |year=1796 |publisher=G.G. and J.

Godwin advocated individualism, proposing that all cooperation in labour be eliminated on the premise that this would be most conducive with the general good.&lt;ref&gt;''Britannica Concise Encyclopedia''.

An influential form of individualist anarchism, called "egoism,"&lt;ref name="Goodway, David 2006, p. 99"&gt;Goodway, David. [[Anarchist Seeds Beneath the Snow]]. Liverpool University Press, 2006, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; or egoist anarchism, was expounded by one of the earliest and best-known proponents of individualist anarchism, the German [[Max Stirner]].&lt;ref name="SEP-Stirner"&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=max-stirner |title=Max Stirner |last=Leopold  |first=David|date=2006-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stirner's ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'', published in 1844, is a founding text of the philosophy.&lt;ref name="SEP-Stirner"/&gt; According to Stirner, the only limitation on the rights of the individual is their power to obtain what they desire,&lt;ref name="The Encyclopedia Americana p. 176"&gt;The Encyclopedia Americana: A Library of Universal Knowledge.

Henry David Thoreau (1817–1862), uno de los escritores próximos al movimiento de la filosofía trascendentalista, es uno de los más conocidos. Su obra más representativa es Walden, aparecida en 1854, aunque redactada entre 1845 y 1847, cuando Thoreau decide instalarse en el aislamiento de una cabaña en el bosque, y vivir en íntimo contacto con la naturaleza, en una vida de soledad y sobriedad. De esta experiencia, su filosofía trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armonía de los individuos con el entorno natural. Muchos han visto en Thoreau a uno de los precursores del ecologismo y del anarquismo primitivista representado en la actualidad por Jonh Zerzan. Para George Woodcock, esta actitud puede estar también motivada por una cierta idea de resistencia al progreso y de rechazo al materialismo creciente que caracteriza la sociedad norteamericana de mediados de siglo XIX."[http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf "Voluntary non-submission.

He is best known for his books ''[[Walden]]'', a reflection upon [[simple living]] in natural surroundings, and his essay, ''[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]]'', an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state. Later [[Benjamin Tucker]] fused Stirner's egoism with the economics of Warren and Proudhon in his eclectic influential publication ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]''.

===Ethical egoism===
{{Main|Ethical egoism}}
Ethical egoism (also called simply egoism)&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, Steven M. Is egoism morally defensible? Philosophia. Springer Netherlands. Volume 18, Numbers 2–3 / July 1988&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[normative ethics|normative ethical]] position that [[moral agent]]s ought to do what is in their own [[wikt:self-interest|self-interest]]. It differs from [[psychological egoism]], which claims that [[people]] ''do'' only act in their self-interest. Ethical egoism also differs from [[rational egoism]], which holds merely that it is [[rationality|rational]] to act in one's self-interest. However, these doctrines may occasionally be combined with ethical egoism.

Ethical egoism contrasts with ethical [[altruism (ethics)|altruism]], which holds that moral agents have an [[obligation]] to help and serve others. Egoism and altruism both contrast with ethical utilitarianism, which holds that a moral agent should treat one's [[self (philosophy)|self]] (also known as [[subject (philosophy)|the subject]]) with no higher regard than one has for others (as egoism does, by elevating self-interests and "the self" to a status not granted to others), but that one also should not (as altruism does) sacrifice one's own interests to help others' interests, so long as one's own interests (i.e. one's own [[desire (philosophy)|desires]] or [[well-being]]) are substantially-equivalent to the others' interests and well-being. Egoism, utilitarianism, and altruism are all forms of [[consequentialism]], but egoism and altruism contrast with utilitarianism, in that egoism and altruism are both [[Consequentialism#Agent-focused or agent-neutral|agent-focused]] forms of consequentialism (i.e. subject-focused or [[subjectivity|subjective]]), but utilitarianism is called agent-neutral (i.e. [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] and [[impartial]]) as it does not treat the subject's (i.e. the self's, i.e. the moral "agent's") own interests as being more or less important than if the same interests, desires, or well-being were anyone else's.

Ethical egoism does not, however, require moral agents to harm the interests and well-being of others when making moral deliberation; e.g. what is in an agent's self-interest may be incidentally detrimental, beneficial, or neutral in its effect on others. Individualism allows for others' interest and well-being to be disregarded or not, as long as what is chosen is efficacious in satisfying the self-interest of the agent. Nor does ethical egoism necessarily [[logical consequence|entail]] that, in pursuing self-interest, one ought always to do what one wants to do; e.g. in the long term, the fulfilment of short-term desires may prove detrimental to the self. Fleeting pleasance, then, takes a back seat to protracted [[eudaemonia]]. In the words of [[James Rachels]], "Ethical egoism [...] endorses selfishness, but it doesn't endorse foolishness."&lt;ref name="Rachels 2008, p. 534"&gt;Rachels 2008, p. 534.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stirner02.jpg|thumb|right|Caricature of [[Max Stirner]] taken from a sketch by [[Friedrich Engels]]. Egoist philosopher Max Stirner has been called a proto-[[existentialist]] philosopher while at the same time is a central theorist of individualist anarchism]]
Ethical egoism is sometimes the philosophical basis for support of [[libertarianism]] or individualist anarchism as in Max Stirner, although these can also be based on altruistic motivations.&lt;ref name=ridgely&gt;{{cite web

==== Egoist anarchism ====
{{Main|Egoist anarchism}}
[[Egoist anarchism]] is a [[Anarchist schools of thought|school of anarchist thought]] that originated in the [[philosophy of Max Stirner]], a nineteenth-century [[Young Hegelians|Hegelian]] philosopher whose "name appears with familiar regularity in historically orientated surveys of anarchist thought as one of the earliest and best-known exponents of [[individualist anarchism]]."&lt;ref name="SEP-Stirner"/&gt; According to Stirner, the only limitation on the rights of the individual is their power to obtain what they desire,&lt;ref name="The Encyclopedia Americana p. 176"/&gt; without regard for God, state, or morality.&lt;ref name="Miller, David 1987. p. 11"/&gt; Stirner advocated self-assertion and foresaw [[union of egoists|unions of egoists]], non-systematic associations continually renewed by all parties' support through an act of will,&lt;ref name=nonserviam&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://i-studies.com/journal/n/pdf/nsi-17.pdf#page=13 |title=The union of egoists |journal=Non Serviam |volume=1 |first=Svein Olav |last=Nyberg |pages=13–14 |location=Oslo, Norway |publisher=Svein Olav Nyberg |oclc=47758413 |accessdate=1 September 2012 |ref=harv |postscript={{inconsistent citations}} |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207042220/http://i-studies.com/journal/n/pdf/nsi-17.pdf |archivedate=7 December 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which Stirner proposed as a form of organisation in place of the [[state (polity)|state]].&lt;ref name=karl&gt;{{cite book | last = Thomas | first = Paul | title = Karl Marx and the Anarchists | publisher = [[Routledge]]/[[Kegan Paul]] | location = London | year = 1985 | isbn = 0-7102-0685-2 |page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Egoist anarchism|Egoist anarchists]] argue that egoism will foster genuine and spontaneous union between individuals.&lt;ref name=carlson /&gt; "Egoism" has inspired many interpretations of Stirner's philosophy but within anarchism it has also gone beyond Stirner.

===Existentialism===
{{Main|Existentialism}}
Existentialism is a term applied to the work of a number of [[19th century philosophy|19th-]] and [[20th century philosophy|20th-century philosophers]] who, despite profound doctrinal differences,&lt;ref&gt;Macquarrie, John. ''Existentialism'', New York (1972), pp. 18–21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Companion to Philosophy'', ed. Ted Honderich, New York (1995), p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt; generally held that the focus of philosophical thought should be to deal with the conditions of existence of the individual person and his or her emotions, actions, responsibilities, and thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;Macquarrie. ''Existentialism'', pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, D. E. ''Existentialism: A Reconstruction'' (Basil Blackwell, 1999, p. 8)&lt;/ref&gt; The early 19th century philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]], posthumously regarded as the father of existentialism,&lt;ref&gt;Marino, Gordon. ''Basic Writings of Existentialism'' (Modern Library, 2004, pp. ix, 3).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kierkegaard/&lt;/ref&gt; maintained that the individual solely has the responsibilities of giving one's own life [[Meaning (existential)|meaning]] and living that life [[Authenticity (philosophy)|passionately and sincerely]],&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Michael. ''Kierkegaard'' (Oneworld, 2003, pp. 4–6).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lowrie, Walter. ''Kierkegaard's attack upon "Christendom"'' (Princeton, 1968, pp. 37–40)&lt;/ref&gt; in spite of many existential obstacles and distractions including [[Philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard#Despair|despair]], [[angst]], [[Absurdism|absurdity]], [[Philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard#Alienation|alienation]], and [[boredom]].&lt;ref&gt;Corrigan, John. ''The Oxford handbook of religion and emotion'' (Oxford, 2008, pp. 387–88)&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent existential philosophers retain the emphasis on the individual, but differ, in varying degrees, on how one achieves and what constitutes a fulfilling life, what obstacles must be overcome, and what external and internal factors are involved, including the potential consequences of the [[Christian existentialism|existence]]&lt;ref&gt;Livingston, James et al. ''Modern Christian Thought: The Twentieth Century'' (Fortress Press, 2006, Chapter 5: Christian Existentialism).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Clancy.

Cooper ''Existentialism: A Reconstruction'' (Basil Blackwell, 1999, p. 8).&lt;/ref&gt; Many existentialists have also regarded traditional systematic or academic philosophy, in both style and content, as too abstract and remote from concrete human experience.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Breisach, ''Introduction to Modern Existentialism'', New York (1962), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walter Kaufmann, ''Existentialism: From Dostoevesky to Sartre'', New York (1956), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Existentialism became fashionable after [[World War II]] as a way to reassert the importance of human individuality and freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Guignon, Charles B. and Derk Pereboom. ''Existentialism: basic writings'' (Hackett Publishing, 2001, p. xiii)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freethought===
{{Main|Freethought}}
Freethought holds that individuals should not accept ideas proposed as [[truth]] without recourse to knowledge and [[reason]]. Thus, freethinkers strive to build their opinions on the basis of [[fact]]s, [[scientific method|scientific inquiry]], and [[logic]]al principles, independent of any logical [[fallacy|fallacies]] or intellectually limiting effects of authority, [[confirmation bias]], [[cognitive bias]], [[conventional wisdom]], [[popular culture]], [[prejudice]], [[sect]]arianism, [[tradition]], [[urban legend]], and all other [[dogma]]s. Regarding [[religion]], freethinkers hold that there is insufficient evidence to scientifically validate the existence of [[supernatural]] phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, James. [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZAwwaxdKMNAC Encyclopedia of Religion]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humanism===
{{Main|Humanism}}
Humanism is a perspective common to a wide range of [[ethics|ethical stances]] that attaches importance to human dignity, concerns, and capabilities, particularly rationality. Although the word has many senses, its meaning comes into focus when contrasted to the supernatural or to appeals to authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Compact Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2007|quote=humanism ''n.'' 1 a rationalistic system of thought attaching prime importance to human rather than divine or supernatural matters. 2 a Renaissance cultural movement that turned away from medieval scholasticism and revived interest in ancient Greek and Roman thought.|publication-date = 2007}} Typically, abridgments of this definition omit all senses except #1, such as in the [http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=38402&amp;dict=CALD Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary], [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/humanism Collins Essential English Dictionary], and {{cite book|title=Webster's Concise Dictionary|publisher=RHR Press|year = 2001|location=New York|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definitions of humanism (subsection) |publisher=Institute for Humanist Studies |url=http://humaniststudies.org/humphil.html |accessdate=16 Jan 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070118050402/http://humaniststudies.org/humphil.html |archivedate=2007-01-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 19th century, humanism has been associated with an anti-clericalism inherited from the 18th-century Enlightenment ''[[philosophes]]''. 21st century Humanism tends to strongly endorse [[human rights]], including [[reproductive rights]], [[gender equality]], [[social justice]], and the [[separation of church and state]].

===Hedonism===
{{Main|Hedonism}}
Philosophical hedonism is a meta-ethical theory of value which argues that [[pleasure]] is the only [[intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic good]] and pain is the only intrinsic bad.&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2013/entries/hedonism/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Andrew|last=Moore|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=1 January 2013|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic idea behind hedonistic thought is that pleasure (an umbrella term for all inherently likable emotions) is the only thing that is good in and of itself or by its very nature.  This implies evaluating the moral worth of character or behavior according to the extent that the pleasure it produces exceeds the pain it entails.  &lt;!-- This last sentence was:  "The normative implications of this are evaluating character or behavior as morally good to the extent that one is concerned with pleasure/pain qua pleasure/pain or an action leads to a greater balance of pleasure over pain than any other would." --&gt;

===Libertinism===
{{Main|Libertine}}
A libertine is one devoid of most moral restraints, which are seen as unnecessary or undesirable, especially one who ignores or even spurns accepted morals and forms of behaviour sanctified by the larger society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/libertine|title=libertine|publisher=|via=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=libertine|title=WordNet Search - 3.1|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Libertines place value on physical pleasures, meaning those experienced through the senses. As a philosophy, libertinism gained new-found adherents in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, particularly in [[France]] and [[Great Britain]]. Notable among these were [[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester]], and the [[Marquis de Sade]]. During the [[Baroque era]] in France, there existed a [[Freethought|freethinking]] circle of philosophers and intellectuals who were collectively known as ''libertinage érudit'' and which included [[Gabriel Naudé]], [[Élie Diodati]] and [[François de La Mothe Le Vayer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=René Pintard|title=Le Libertinage érudit dans la première moitié du XVIIe siècle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IeL29wMqdbgC&amp;pg=PA11|accessdate=24 July 2012|year=2000|publisher=Slatkine|isbn=978-2-05-101818-0|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/fideism/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Richard|last=Amesbury|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=1 January 2016|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The critic [[Vivian de Sola Pinto]] linked [[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester]]'s libertinism to [[Hobbesian]] [[materialism]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/02/20/specials/greene-monkey.html A Martyr to Sin]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Objectivism===
{{Libertarianism sidebar |Concepts}}
{{Main|Objectivism (Ayn Rand)}}
[[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] is a system of philosophy created by philosopher and novelist [[Ayn Rand]] (1905–1982) that holds: [[reality]] exists independent of consciousness; human beings gain knowledge rationally from perception through the process of concept formation and inductive and deductive logic; the moral purpose of one's life is the pursuit of one's own happiness or rational self-interest. Rand thinks the only social system consistent with this morality is full respect for individual rights, embodied in pure ''[[laissez faire]]'' [[capitalism]]; and the role of [[art]] in human life is to transform man's widest metaphysical ideas, by selective reproduction of reality, into a physical form—a work of art—that he can comprehend and to which he can respond emotionally. Objectivism celebrates man as his own hero, "with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute."&lt;ref&gt;"About the Author" in {{harvnb|Rand|1992|pp=1170–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophical anarchism===
{{Main|Philosophical anarchism}}
[[File:BenjaminTucker.jpg|upright=0.8|left|thumb|[[Benjamin Tucker]], American individualist anarchist who focused on economics calling them "Anarchistic-Socialism"&lt;ref&gt;Tucker said, ''"the fact that one class of men are dependent for their living upon the sale of their labour, while another class of men are relieved of the necessity of labour by being legally privileged to sell something that is not labour. . . . And to such a state of things I am as much opposed as any one. But the minute you remove privilege. . . every man will be a labourer exchanging with fellow-labourers . . . What Anarchistic-Socialism aims to abolish is usury . . . it wants to deprive capital of its reward."''Benjamin Tucker. ''Instead of a Book'', p. 404&lt;/ref&gt; and adhering to the [[Mutualism (economy)|mutualist]] economics of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] and [[Josiah Warren]]]]
Philosophical anarchism is an [[anarchist school of thought]]&lt;ref&gt;Wayne Gabardi, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1957102 review] of ''Anarchism'' by David Miller, published in ''American Political Science Review'' Vol. 80, No. 1. (Mar., 1986), pp. 300—02.&lt;/ref&gt; which contends that the [[Sovereign state|State]] lacks [[legitimacy (political)|moral legitimacy]] and – in contrast to revolutionary anarchism – does not advocate violent revolution to eliminate it but advocates peaceful evolution to superate it.&lt;ref&gt;According to scholar [[Allan Antliff]], Benjamin Tucker coined the term "philosophical anarchism," to distinguish peaceful evolutionary anarchism from revolutionary variants. ''Antliff, Allan. 2001. [https://books.google.com/books?id=dQTk-N4JWbYC Anarchist Modernism: Art, Politics, and the First American Avant-Garde]. University of Chicago Press. p. 4''&lt;/ref&gt; Though philosophical anarchism does not necessarily imply any action or desire for the elimination of the State, philosophical anarchists do not believe that they have an obligation or duty to obey the State, or conversely, that the State has a right to command.

Philosophical anarchism is a component especially of individualist anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;Outhwaite, William &amp; Tourain, Alain (Eds.). (2003). Anarchism. The Blackwell Dictionary of Modern Social Thought (2nd Edition, p. 12). Blackwell Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophical anarchists of historical note include [[Mohandas Gandhi]], William Godwin, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, Max Stirner,&lt;ref&gt;Michael Freeden identifies four broad types of individualist anarchism. He says the first is the type associated with William Godwin that advocates [[self-government]] with a "progressive rationalism that included benevolence to others." The second type is the amoral self-serving rationality of [[Egotism|Egoism]], as most associated with Max Stirner. The third type is "found in [[Herbert Spencer]]'s early predictions, and in that of some of his disciples such as [[Wordsworth Donisthorpe|Donisthorpe]], foreseeing the redundancy of the state in the source of social evolution." The fourth type retains a moderated form of Egoism and accounts for social cooperation through the advocacy of market. ''Freeden, Michael.

Thoreau's Proposals for Legislation. American Quarterly, Vol. 7, No. 3 (Autumn, 1955). p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary philosophical anarchists include A. John Simmons and [[Robert Paul Wolff]].

===Subjectivism===
{{Main|Subjectivism}}
Subjectivism is a philosophical tenet that accords primacy to subjective experience as fundamental of all measure and law. In extreme forms like [[Solipsism]], it may hold that the nature and existence of every object depends solely on someone's subjective awareness of it. For example, [[Wittgenstein]] wrote in [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]: "The subject doesn't belong to the world, but it is a limit of the world" (proposition 5.632). Metaphysical subjectivism is the theory that reality is what we perceive to be real, and that there is no underlying true reality that exists independently of perception. One can also hold that it is [[consciousness]] rather than perception that is reality ([[subjective idealism]]). In [[probability]], a subjectivism stands for the belief that probabilities are simply degrees-of-belief by rational agents in a certain proposition, and which have no objective reality in and of themselves.

[[Ethical subjectivism]] stands in opposition to [[moral realism]], which claims that moral propositions refer to objective facts, independent of human opinion; to [[error theory]], which denies that any moral propositions are true in any sense; and to [[non-cognitivism]], which denies that moral sentences express propositions at all. The most common forms of ethical subjectivism are also forms of [[moral relativism]], with moral standards held to be relative to each culture or society (c.f. [[cultural relativism]]), or even to every individual. The latter view, as put forward by [[Protagoras]], holds that there are as many distinct scales of good and evil as there are subjects in the world. Moral subjectivism is that species of moral relativism that relativizes moral value to the individual subject.

[[Horst Matthai Quelle]]  was a [[Spanish language]] [[Germany|German]] anarchist [[philosophy|philosopher]] influenced by [[Max Stirner]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com.ec"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=E6JFPiDRlikC&amp;pg=PA345&amp;lpg=PA345#v=onepage&amp;q=horst%20matthai%20el%20humanismo%20como%20problema%20humano Horst Matthai Quelle. ''Textos Filosóficos (1989-1999)''. p. 15]&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that since the individual gives form to the world, he is those objects, the others and the whole universe.&lt;ref name="books.google.com.ec"/&gt; One of his main views was a "theory of infinite worlds" which for him was developed by [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-socratic philosophers]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com.ec"/&gt;

====Solipsism====
{{Main|Solipsism}}
Solipsism is the [[philosophy|philosophical]] idea that only one's own [[mind]] is sure to exist. The term comes from [[Latin]] ''solus'' (alone) and ''ipse'' (self). Solipsism as an [[epistemology|epistemological]] position holds that [[knowledge]] of anything outside one's own mind is unsure. [[Philosophical skepticism|The external world]] and [[problem of other minds|other minds]] cannot be known, and might not exist outside the mind. As a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] position, solipsism goes further to the conclusion that the world and other minds do not exist. As such it is the only epistemological position that, by its own [[wikt:postulate#Pronunciation|postulate]], is both [[wikt:irrefutable#English|irrefutable]] and yet indefensible in the same manner. Although the number of individuals sincerely espousing solipsism has been small, it is not uncommon for one philosopher to accuse another's arguments of entailing solipsism as an unwanted consequence, in a kind of [[reductio ad absurdum]]. In the history of philosophy, solipsism has served as a [[skeptical hypothesis]].

==Economic individualism==
The [[doctrine]] of economic individualism holds that each individual should be allowed [[autonomy]] in making his or her own economic decisions as opposed to those decisions being made by the state, the [[community]], the corporation etc. for him or her.

===Liberalism===
{{Main|Liberalism}}
Classical liberalism is a political ideology that developed in the 19th century in [[England]], [[Western Europe]], and the [[Americas]]. It followed earlier forms of liberalism in its commitment to personal freedom and popular government, but differed from earlier forms of liberalism in its commitment to [[free markets]] and [[classical economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=sq-1z8VMhDEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA37#v=onepage|title=Modern Political Philosophy|first=Richard|last=Hudelson|date=1 January 1999|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable classical liberals in the 19th century include [[Jean-Baptiste Say]], [[Thomas Malthus]], and [[David Ricardo]]. Classical liberalism was revived in the 20th century by [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich Hayek]], and further developed by [[Milton Friedman]], [[Robert Nozick]], [[Loren Lomasky]], and [[Jan Narveson]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Conway (academic)|David Conway]]. ''Classical Liberalism: The Unvanquished Ideal.'' Palgrave Macmillan. 1998. {{ISBN|978-0-312-21932-1}} p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase ''classical liberalism'' is also sometimes used to refer to all forms of liberalism before the 20th century.

===Individualist anarchism and economics===
[[File:Emilearmand01.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.9|Influential [[Individualist anarchism in France|French individualist anarchist]] [[Emile Armand]]]]
In regards to economic questions within individualist anarchism there are adherents to [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] ([[Pierre Joseph Proudhon]], [[Emile Armand]], early Benjamin Tucker); [[natural rights]] positions (early Benjamin Tucker, [[Lysander Spooner]], Josiah Warren); and egoistic disrespect for "ghosts" such as private property and markets (Max Stirner, [[John Henry Mackay]], [[Lev Chernyi]], later Benjamin Tucker, [[Renzo Novatore]], [[illegalism]]). Contemporary individualist anarchist [[Kevin Carson]] characterizes American individualist anarchism saying that "Unlike the rest of the [[socialist]] movement, the individualist anarchists believed that the natural wage of labor in a free market was its product, and that economic exploitation could only take place when capitalists and landlords harnessed the power of the state in their interests. Thus, individualist anarchism was an alternative both to the increasing statism of the mainstream socialist movement, and to a [[classical liberal]] movement that was moving toward a mere apologetic for the power of big business." &lt;ref&gt;Kevin Carson. ''Organization Theory: A Libertarian Perspective''. BOOKSURGE. 2008. p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mutualism====
{{main|Mutualism (economic theory)}}
Mutualism is an [[anarchist school of thought]] which can be traced to the writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, who envisioned a society where each person might possess a [[means of production]], either individually or collectively, with trade representing equivalent amounts of labor in the [[free market]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mutualist.org/ Mutualist.org Introduction]&lt;/ref&gt; Integral to the scheme was the establishment of a mutual-credit bank which would lend to producers at a minimal interest rate only high enough to cover the costs of administration.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, David. 1987. "Mutualism." The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Political Thought. Blackwell Publishing. p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Mutualism is based on a [[labor theory of value]] which holds that when labor or its product is sold, in exchange, it ought to receive goods or services embodying "the amount of labor necessary to produce an article of exactly similar and equal utility".&lt;ref&gt;Tandy, Francis D., 1896, ''[[Voluntary Socialism]]'', chapter 6, paragraph 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Receiving anything less would be considered exploitation, theft of labor, or [[usury]].

Marx went one way; Warren and Proudhon the other. Thus were born State Socialism and Anarchism...Authority, takes many shapes, but, broadly speaking, her enemies divide themselves into three classes: first, those who abhor her both as a means and as an end of progress, opposing her openly, avowedly, sincerely, consistently, universally; second, those who profess to believe in her as a means of progress, but who accept her only so far as they think she will subserve their own selfish interests, denying her and her blessings to the rest of the world; third, those who distrust her as a means of progress, believing in her only as an end to be obtained by first trampling upon, violating, and outraging her. These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity. Good representatives of the first are seen in the Catholic Church and the Russian autocracy; of the second, in the Protestant Church and the Manchester school of politics and political economy; of the third, in the atheism of Gambetta and the socialism of Karl Marx."

I have labelled this negative pole 'socialist orthodoxy', composed of both Leninists and social democrats...What I suggested was that these Left communist thinkers differentiated their own understandings of communism from a strand of socialism that came to follow a largely electoral road in the West, pursuing a kind of social capitalism, and a path to socialism that predominated in the peripheral and semi- peripheral countries, which sought revolutionary conquest of power and led to something like state capitalism. Generally, the Left communist thinkers were to find these paths locked within the horizons of capitalism (the law of value, money, private property, class, the state), and they were to characterize these solutions as statist, substitutionist and authoritarian."

Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy calls it "right libertarianism" but states: "Libertarianism is often thought of as 'right-wing' doctrine. This, however, is mistaken for at least two reasons. First, on social—rather than economic—issues, libertarianism tends to be 'left-wing'. It opposes laws that restrict consensual and private sexual relationships between adults (e.g., gay sex, non-marital sex, and deviant sex), laws that restrict drug use, laws that impose religious views or practices on individuals, and compulsory military service. Second, in addition to the better-known version of libertarianism—right-libertarianism—there is also a version known as '[[left-libertarianism]]'. Both endorse full self-ownership, but they differ with respect to the powers agents have to appropriate unappropriated natural resources (land, air, water, etc.)."&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] entry on [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/libertarianism Libertarianism], [[Stanford University]], July 24, 2006 version.&lt;/ref&gt;

==As creative independent lifestyle==
[[File:Oscar Wilde portrait.jpg|upright=0.7|left|thumb|[[Oscar Wilde]], famous [[Irish people|Irish]] [[socialist]] writer of the [[decadent movement]] and famous [[dandy]]]]
The anarchist&lt;ref&gt;"The most ambitious contribution to literary anarchism during the 1890s was undoubtedly Oscar Wilde ''The Soul of Man under Socialism''. Wilde, as we have seen, declared himself an anarchist on at least one occasion during the 1890s, and he greatly admired [[Peter Kropotkin]], whom he had met. Later, in ''De Profundis'', he described Kropotkin's life as one "of the most perfect lives I have come across in my own experience" and talked of him as "a man with a soul of that beautiful white Christ that seems coming out of Russia." But in ''The Soul of Man under Socialism'', which appeared in 1890, it is Godwin rather than Kropotkin whose influence seems dominant." George Woodcock. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements.'' 1962. (p. 447)&lt;/ref&gt; writer and [[bohemianism|bohemian]] [[Oscar Wilde]] wrote in his famous essay ''[[The Soul of Man under Socialism]]'' that "Art is individualism, and individualism is a disturbing and disintegrating force. There lies its immense value. For what it seeks is to disturb monotony of type, slavery of custom, tyranny of habit, and the reduction of man to the level of a machine."&lt;ref name="flag.blackened.net"/&gt; For anarchist historian [[George Woodcock]] "Wilde's aim in ''The Soul of Man under Socialism'' is to seek the society most favorable to the artist...for Wilde art is the supreme end, containing within itself enlightenment and regeneration, to which all else in society must be subordinated...Wilde represents the anarchist as [[aesthete]]."&lt;ref name="Anarchism 1962. p. 447"/&gt; The word individualism in this way has been used to denote a personality with a strong tendency towards self-creation and experimentation as opposed to tradition or popular mass opinions and behaviors.&lt;ref name="thefreedictionary.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bohemia: The Underworld of Art"/&gt;

Anarchist writer [[Murray Bookchin]] describes a lot of individualist anarchists as people who "expressed their opposition in uniquely personal forms, especially in fiery tracts, outrageous behavior, and aberrant lifestyles in the cultural ghettos of fin de siècle New York, Paris, and London. As a credo, individualist anarchism remained largely a bohemian lifestyle, most conspicuous in its demands for sexual freedom ('[[free love]]') and enamored of innovations in art, behavior, and clothing."&lt;ref name="bohemian individualism"/&gt;

In relation to this view of individuality, French Individualist anarchist [[Emile Armand]] advocates [[ethical egoism|egoistical]] denial of social conventions and dogmas to live in accord to one's own ways and desires in daily life since he emphasized anarchism as a way of life and practice. In this way he opines "So the anarchist individualist tends to reproduce himself, to perpetuate his spirit in other individuals who will share his views and who will make it possible for a state of affairs to be established from which authoritarianism has been banished. It is this desire, this will, not only to live, but also to reproduce oneself, which we shall call "activity".&lt;ref name="lifeactivity"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaz.org/~dan/individualist-anarchist/library/emile-armand/life-activity.html|title=Emil Armand "Anarchist Individualism as a Life and Activity"|first=|last=_wlo:dek|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''Imperfect garden : the legacy of humanism'', humanist philosopher [[Tzvetan Todorov]] identifies individualism as an important current of socio-political thought within modernity and as examples of it he mentions [[Michel de Montaigne]], [[François de La Rochefoucauld (writer)|François de La Rochefoucauld]], [[Marquis de Sade]], and [[Charles Baudelaire]].&lt;ref name="Princeton University Press 2002"&gt;''Imperfect garden : the legacy of humanism''. Princeton University Press. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In La Rochefoucauld, he identifies a tendency similar to [[stoicism]] in which "the honest person works his being in the manner of a sculptor who searches the liberation of the forms which are inside a block of marble, to extract the truth of that matter."&lt;ref name="Princeton University Press 2002"/&gt; In Baudelaire he finds the [[dandy]] trait in which one searches to cultivate "the idea of beauty within oneself, of satisfying one's passions of feeling and thinking."&lt;ref name="Princeton University Press 2002"/&gt;

The [[Russian American|Russian-American]] poet [[Joseph Brodsky]] once wrote that "The surest defense against Evil is extreme individualism, originality of thinking, whimsicality, even—if you will—eccentricity. That is, something that can't be feigned, faked, imitated; something even a seasoned imposter couldn't be happy with."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quotes.dictionary.com/The_surest_defense_against_Evil_is_extreme_individualism |title=Dictionary.com - The world's favorite online dictionary! |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119120030/http://quotes.dictionary.com/The_surest_defense_against_Evil_is_extreme_individualism |archivedate=2010-11-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] famously declared, "Whoso would be a man must be a nonconformist"—a point of view developed at length in both the life and work of [[Henry David Thoreau]]. Equally memorable and influential on [[Walt Whitman]] is Emerson's idea that "a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of small minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines." Emerson opposes on principle the reliance on civil and religious social structures precisely because through them the individual approaches the divine second-hand, mediated by the once original experience of a genius from another age. "An institution," he explains, "is the lengthened shadow of one man." To achieve this original relation one must "Insist on one's self; never imitate" for if the relationship is secondary the connection is lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/emerson/#H2|title=Emerson, Ralph Waldo - Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6476">In [[Marxist theory]], '''interpellation''' is an important concept regarding the notion of [[ideology]]. It is associated in particular with the work of French philosopher [[Louis Althusser]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=[[Louis Althusser]]|year=1971|title=Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses (Notes towards an Investigation)|url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/althusser/1970/ideology.htm|journal=Lenin and Philosophy and Other Essays}}(Verso: 1970, p.11)&lt;/ref&gt; According to Althusser, every society is made up of [[Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses|Ideological State Apparatuses]] (ISAs) and [[Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses|Repressive State Apparatuses]] (RSAs) which are instrumental to constant reproduction of the relations to production of that given society. While ISAs belong to the private domain and refer to private institutions (family, church but also the media and politics), the RSA is one public institution (police/military) controlled by the government. Consequently, 'interpellation' describes the process by which [[ideology]], embodied in major social and political institutions (ISAs and RSAs), constitutes the very nature of individual [[subject (philosophy)|subject]]s' identities through the process of "hailing" them in social interactions.

Althusser’s thought has made significant contributions to other French philosophers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; notably [[Derrida]], [[Kristeva]], [[Roland Barthes|Barthes]], [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], and [[Gilles Deleuze|Deleuze]].

== Overview ==
In "Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses (Notes Towards an Investigation)",&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Althusser introduces the concepts of Ideological State Apparatuses (ISA), Repressive State Apparatuses (RSAs), ideology, and interpellation. In his writing, Althusser argues that "there is no ideology except by the subject and for the subject".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This notion of subjectivity becomes central to his writings.

To illustrate this concept, Althusser gives the example of a friend who knocks on a door. The person inside asks "Who is there?" and only opens the door once the "It’s me" from the outside sounds familiar. By doing so, the person inside partakes in "a material ritual practice of ideological recognition in everyday life".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In other words, Althusser’s central thesis is that "you and I are always already subjects" and are constantly engaging in everyday rituals, like greeting someone or shaking hands, which makes us subjected to ideology.

Althusser goes further to argue that "all ideology hails or interpellates concrete individuals as concrete subjects" and emphasizes that "ideology ‘acts’ or ‘functions’ in such a way that it ... ‘transforms’ the individual into subjects".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is made possible through Althusser’s notion of interpellation or hailing which is a non-specific and unconscious process. For example, when a police officer shouts (or hails) "Hey, you there!" and an individual turns around and so-to-speak ‘answers’ the call, he becomes a subject. Althusser argues that this is because the individual has realized that the hailing was addressed at him which makes him subjective to the ideology of democracy and law.

Consequently, individual subjects are presented principally as produced by social forces, rather than acting as powerful independent agents with self-produced identities.

Althusser's argument here strongly draws from [[Jacques Lacan]]'s concept of the [[mirror stage]]. However, unlike Lacan who distinguishes between the "I" and the "subject", Althusser collapses both concepts into one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

== Other applications ==
German philosophers [[Theodor W. Adorno|Theodor Adorno]] and [[Max Horkheimer]] employ a method of analysis similar to Althusser's notion of interpellation in their text ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]'', although they do so 26 years before "Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses" was released. Rather than situating their analysis on the State, Adorno and Horkheimer argue that the mass media is responsible for the construction of passive subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

| access-date = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; So unlike the police officer in Althusser’s example who reinforces the ideology of democracy and law, the mass media has now taken over this role and interpellates, or hails at, the passive consumer.

[[Feminism|Feminist]] scholar and [[Queer theory|queer]] theorist [[Judith Butler]] has critically applied a framework based on interpellation to highlight the [[Social constructionism|social construction]] of [[Gender identity|gender identities]]. She argues that by hailing "It’s a boy/girl," the newborn baby is ultimately positioned as subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media theorist [[David Gauntlett]] argues that "interpellation occurs when a person connects with a media text: when we enjoy a magazine or TV show, for example, this
uncritical consumption means that the text has ''interpellated'' us into a certain set of assumptions, and caused us to tacitly accept a particular approach to the world."&lt;ref&gt;David Gauntlett. ''Media, Gender and Identity: An Introduction''. London: Routledge, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Knowledge of human nature''' is the ability to correctly assess the [[behavior]] or [[Moral character|character]] of people based on a [[first impression (psychology)|first impression]], and to gauge how they think and predict how they will act.

[[Experience|Life experience]], [[intuition (psychology)|intuition]], [[intelligence]], and [[wisdom]] are the decisive factors which contribute to this ability. Knowledge of [[human nature]]  is not innate, but is acquired through frequent contact with people and experience with many different people.

Knowledge of human nature can be used to judge people correctly, to motivate them, to give other people good advice, to deepen relationships, etc. However, it can also be used to exploit people to one's own advantage, for example, if one wants to persuade people, to seduce them, or to sell them something.

There are numerous models for the theoretical acquisition of knowledge of human nature, such as the [[Myers-Briggs Type Indicator]] or the [[Enneagram of Personality|Enneagram]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9510">'''Land footprint''' is the real amount of [[land]], wherever it is in the world, that is needed to produce a product, or used by an organisation or by a nation.&lt;ref name="europa1"&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/enveco/resource_efficiency/pdf/FootRev_Report.pdf Giljum, S., Lutter, S., Bruckner, M., Aparcana, S., Heinke, J., Gerten, D. et al. (2013, May 3). State-of-Play of National Consumption-Based Indicators: A review and evaluation of available methods and data to calculate footprint-type (consumption-based) indicators for materials, water, land and carbon.] Vienna: Sustainable Europe Research Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==

Land footprint is a [[resource consumption|consumption]]-based indicator, i.e. it looks at the [[natural resources|resources]] needed to create a final product, or by an organisation or country, wherever they are in the world. This is in contrast to production-based indicators, which just look at resource use within a country.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} For example, cows will require land to graze on within a country, but may also be fed by feed grown on land in another country. This production vs consumption approach is extensively discussed in [[greenhouse gas emissions accounting]], where [[carbon footprint]] is the consumption-based indicator.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

== Related concepts ==

Land footprint is closely linked to a number of other concepts, including:

* ''Ghost acres'' (or ghost hectares), a term that started to be in use in the 1960s, for example by Georg Borgström in his book "The Hungry Planet: The modern world at the edge of Famine" in 1965, refers to the area of land abroad that is used to grow feed for animals within a country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GI8wAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=the+hungry+planet%3A+the+modern+world+at+the+edge+of+famine&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=ghost |title=The hungry planet: the modern world at the edge of famine - Georg Borgström - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* ''Embedded land'' or "Virtual land", is the land that is effectively embedded in an imported product; i.e. the land used to produce the product (including any [[supply chain]], such as [[soybean|soya]] feed for [[meat production|beef]]).
* ''Global cropland'', as used in the [[International Resource Panel]] report on global [[land use]], is part of the total land footprint, but doesn't include e.g. [[Built-up area|built-up land]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.unep.org/resourcepanel/Publications/AreasofAssessment/AssessingGlobalLandUseBalancingConsumptionw/tabid/132063/Default.aspx International Resource Panel. (2014). Assessing global land use: Balancing consumption with sustainable supply.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Indirect land use change impacts of biofuels|Indirect land use change]]'', used in the debate on [[biofuels]], is a related concept, that looks at the land needed to grow biofuels, then considers the indirect impacts that this use of land may have on other land use in the country concerned.

[[Ecological footprint]] is measured using a different approach, with two key differences to land footprint:

* Ecological footprint adds together both real land use and an calculated (but not really existing) area of forest to absorb CO&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt; emissions, to incorporate part of the impacts of climate change. In contrast, land footprint looks only at real land use, and is often used in association with [[carbon footprint]] to cover all climate changing emissions.
* Ecological footprint adjusts land areas to [[global hectares]], while land footprint is based on real land area - or an estimate of it.

==Research==
The International Resource Panel has produced a detailed report on land, "Assessing global land use: Balancing consumption with sustainable supply",&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; which establishes a [[planetary boundary]] for cropland, and proposes a potential safe operating space target of 0.2 ha of cropland per person per year. This is in contrast to the current EU use of cropland of around 0.31 ha per person per year.

The most detailed study of Europe's land footprint (including forestry) and how this is traded with the rest of the work was published by Sustainable European Research Institute (SERI) in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Sustainable Europe Research Institute. (2011). Europe’s global land demand: A study on the actual land embodied in European imports and exports of agriculture and forestry products. http://seri.at/en/global-responsibility/2011/10/19/europes-global-land-demand-a-study-on-the-actual-land-embodied-in-european-imports-and-exports-of-agricultural-and-forestry-products/&lt;/ref&gt; A briefing on this study is available from [[Friends of the Earth Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foeeurope.org/sites/default/files/publications/FoEE_Briefing_Europe_Global_Land_Demand_1011.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531011838/http://www.foeeurope.org/sites/default/files/publications/FoEE_Briefing_Europe_Global_Land_Demand_1011.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of Germany's land balance&lt;ref&gt;Meier, T., Christen, O., Semler, E., Jahreis, G., Voget-Kleschin, L., Schrode, A. et al. (2013). Balancing virtual land imports by a shift in the diet. Using a land balance approach to assess the sustainability of food consumption. Germany as an example. Appetite, 74C, 20-34.&lt;/ref&gt; modelled the impact of changes in diet and consumption of stimulants (e.g. coffee, wine etc.) on Germany's land balance. It found that a switch to a healthier diet, with less meat and with reduced stimulants, could lead to no net land imports, while a switch to vegetarian or vegan diets would lead to Germany being a net exporter of land.

Sustainable Europe Research Institute have also examined potential scenarios for reducing Europe's land footprint, including dietary changes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foeeurope.org/sites/default/files/seri_land_footprint_scenario_nov2013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==In policy==

The EU's 7th Environmental action plan &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32013D1386:EN:NOT |title=EUR-Lex - 32013D1386 - EN |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2014-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; calls for examination of land (and other) footprints:

:"To set a framework for action to improve resource efficiency aspects beyond GHG emissions and energy, targets for reducing the overall lifecycle environmental impact of consumption will be set.. Indicators and targets for land, water, material and carbon footprints as well as their role within the European Semester should also be considered in this regard."

The European Parliament's own initiative report on "Resource efficiency: moving towards a circular economy",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=European Parliament|title=European Parliament resolution of 9 July 2015 on resource efficiency: moving towards a circular economy|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&amp;reference=P8-TA-2015-0266&amp;format=XML&amp;language=EN|accessdate=29 July 2015|date=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was voted on 9 July 2015, includes the following text calling for action from the European Commission on land and other footprints:
:"Urges the Commission to propose, by the end of 2015, a lead indicator and a dashboard of sub-indicators on resource efficiency, including ecosystem services; points out that the use of these harmonised indicators should be legally binding as of 2018, and they should measure [[resource consumption]], including imports and exports, at EU, Member State and industry level and take account of the whole lifecycle of products and services and should be based on the footprint methodology, measuring at least land, water and material use and carbon;"

A study of the four resource footprint indicators, carried for the European Commission&lt;ref name="europa1"/&gt; examined what data was available to measure the land footprint, carbon footprint, water footprint &amp; material footprint at economy level. This study concluded that Land Footprint needed methodological improvement and harmonisation, and that a common, international, multi-regional input output database would make it easier to calculate all four footprints.

[[Friends of the Earth Europe]], together with a wider Land Footprint Coalition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.foeeurope.org/Groups-unite-Europe-cut-use-world-land-180313 |title=Groups unite to call for Europe to cut its use of world’s land &amp;#124; Friends of the Earth Europe |publisher=Foeeurope.org |date=2013-03-18 |accessdate=2014-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been advocating for Land Footprint to be used to measure resource consumption, as part of a wider project that argues that four footprints - land, [[Water footprint|water]], [[Carbon footprint|carbon]] &amp; material (equivalent to either RMC or TMC, see [[Material Flow Accounting]]) - are an effective way of measuring &amp; managing Europe's resource use.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foeeurope.org/sites/default/files/publications/FoEE_SERI_measuring_europes_resource_use_0609.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The coalition, which includes [[Slow Food|Slow Food Europe]] and [[Birdlife]], are also calling for Europe to reduce its land footprint.

'''Lean product development''' ('''LPD''') is a [[Lean manufacturing|lean]] approach to counter the challenges of [[New product development|product development]], notably:
* Lack of innovative solutions
* Long [[development cycle]] times
* Many [[redevelopment]] cycles
* High development costs
* Long [[production cycle]] times
* High [[production cost]]s

==History of lean product development==
[[Toyota]] started its journey with lean product development&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kimoto|first1=Shoji|title=Quest for the Dawn|date=1991|publisher=Dougherty Co|isbn=1878150014|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; at Toyota Loom Works (see [[History of Toyota]]). Their early approach is notably different from the lean manufacturing that became famous through the book "[[The Machine That Changed the World (book)|The Machine that changed the world]]".

When Toyota started manufacturing cars, there was a difference in manufacturing conditions between Japan and the USA. Toyota had few educated engineers and little prior experience. Car companies in US employed a well-educated work force in the cities and benefited from the research and student skill-sets of established engineering schools. To tackle this shortfall in knowledge and experience, Toyota conducted an incremental approach to development that built on their existing knowledge and became the basis of the lean systems Toyota uses today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ward|first1=Allen|title=Lean Product and Process Development|publisher=LEI|isbn=978-1934109137|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sato|first1=Masaaki|title=The Toyota Leaders: An Executive Guide|date=December 16, 2008|publisher=Vertical|isbn=978-1934287231|pages=40–45|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allen Ward studied Toyota’s lean product development system and found parallels with the US [[airplane industry]]. For instance, the Wright brothers’ method&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Melvin|first1=Bob|title=Knowledge Based Product Development: A Practical Guide|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|isbn=1492705969|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; of constructing their airplanes became one of the legacies they passed on to the aviation industry. This approach enabled the USA to create one of World War II's most successful fighter planes from scratch in the short span of six months. After the war, Toyota incorporated many of the airline industry's findings into its own product development methodology.

==Differences between lean product development and lean production==
While some basic principles and guidelines are applicable across lean product development and lean production (such as waste reduction), many applications of lean process for development have focused more on the production approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lean.enst.fr/wiki/pub/Lean/LesPublications/LeanDevBalleBalle.pdf|title=Lean Development|publisher=Business Strategy Review|last2=Ballé|first2=Freddy|pages=17–22|last1=Ballé|first1=Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of production is to manufacture products reliably within margins of control. The flow of value is physically evident, and the link between cause and effect is easy to see. For example, feedback on adjusting the speed of production is immediately realized in an increase or decrease in rejected items. Any decisions made must be based on best practice.

On the other hand, the purpose of product development is to design new products that improve the lives of customers. This is a complex space where the flow of value can only be discerned at an abstract level and where cause and effect might be separated by time and space. For example, feedback on the decision to design a certain feature will not be received until the product has been built and is in the hands of the customer. This means that decisions are made on short-cycle experimentation, prototyping, set-based design, and emergent practice. A premium is placed on creating reusable knowledge and reducing risk at handover points.

An essential point about these differences is summarized in the advice Jim Womack gives Harley Davidson: "''Don't try to bring lean manufacturing upstream to product development. The application of Lean in product development and manufacturing are different. Some aspects may look similar, but they are not! Be leery of an expert with experience in lean manufacturing that claims to know product development''" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Oosterwal|first1=Dantar|title=The Lean Machine|date=January 13, 2010|publisher=Productivity Press|isbn=978-0814432884|pages=131–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common high level concepts associated with lean product development are:
# [[Knowledge creation|Creation of re-usable knowledge]]. Knowledge is created and maintained so that it can be leveraged for successive products or iterations. 
# Set-based [[concurrent engineering]]. Different stages of product development run simultaneously rather than consecutively to decrease development time, improve productivity, and reduce costs.  
# Teams of responsible experts. Lean product development organizations develop cross-functional teams and reward competence building in teams and individuals.
# Cadence and pull. Managers of lean product development organizations develop autonomous teams, where engineers plan their own work and work their own plans.  
# Visual management. [[Information graphics|Visualization]] is a main enabler of lean product development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holmdahl|first1=Lars|title=Visual Management in Lean Product Development|isbn=978-91-979196-1-6|pages=1–15|url=http://www.larsholmdahl.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Entrepreneurial system designer. The lean product development organization makes one person responsible for the engineering and aesthetic design, and market and business success, of the product.

== Results of lean product development ==
Lean product development has been claimed to produce the following results:
* Increase innovation ten-fold&lt;ref name=ward&gt;Allen Ward - Lean Product and Process Development&lt;/ref&gt;
* Increase introduction of new products 400%-500% &lt;ref name=ward/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Oosterwal|first1=Dantar|title=The Lean Machine|date=January 13, 2010|publisher=Productivity Press|isbn=978-0814432884|pages=237–240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies such as Toyota can attribute their success to lean product development. In 2000, Toyota launched 14 new products, a larger product line than GM's entire product offering. At that point, Toyota had just 70,000 employees while GM had more than five times as many.&lt;ref name=ward/&gt;

==  Applicability of lean product development ==

Researchers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ottosson|first1=Stig|title=Handbook in Innovation Management|date=2006|publisher=www.complexityforum.com|url=http://www.complexityforum.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; divide product development projects accordingly to their need drivers:
* '''Wished''': there is no such product on the market, only a wish for such a product. These projects can be on the edge of what is possible to do.
* '''Wanted''': there are only a few basic similar products on the market that usually require improvement.
* '''Needed''': there are enough products in existence so knowledge about this is abundant on the market.

For example, the mobile phone was a ''Wanted'' product in the 1990s because it was on the leading edge of technology. Today it is regarded as a ''Needed'' product. It is common in the market. There is enough knowledge in the public domain so that even small companies can make a good mobile phone.

Product development methods can be classified according to whether they are focused on handling stable or non-stable conditions. Lean product development is a dynamic method of product development that handles unstable conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holmdahl|first1=Lars|title=Visual Management in Lean Product Development|isbn=978-91-979196-1-6|pages=18–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of need drivers and stability (or lack of stability) on product development are illustrated in the table below.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=September 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7935">In a [[Theory of relativity|relativistic theory]] of [[physics]], a '''Lorentz scalar''' is an expression, formed from items of the theory, which evaluates to a [[scalar (physics)|scalar]], [[invariant (physics)|invariant]] under any [[Lorentz transformation]]. A Lorentz scalar may be generated from e.g., the scalar product of vectors, or from contracting tensors of the theory. While the components of vectors and tensors are in general altered under Lorentz transformations, Lorentz scalars remain unchanged.

A Lorentz scalar is not always immediately seen to be an invariant scalar in the [[Scalar (mathematics)|mathematical sense]], but the resulting scalar value is invariant under any basis transformation applied to the vector space, on which the considered theory is based. A simple Lorentz scalar in [[Minkowski spacetime]] is the ''spacetime distance'' ("length" of their difference) of two fixed events in spacetime. While the "position"-4-vectors of the events change between different inertial frames, their spacetime distance remains invariant under the corresponding Lorentz transformation. Other examples of Lorentz scalars are the "length" of 4-velocities (see below), or the [[Ricci curvature]] in a point in spacetime from [[General relativity]], which is a contraction of the [[Riemann curvature tensor]] there.

==Simple scalars in special relativity==

===The length of a position vector===

[[Image:Fermi walker 1.png|frame|left|World lines for two particles at different speeds.]]
In [[special relativity]] the location of a particle in 4-dimensional [[spacetime]] is given by 
:&lt;math&gt; x^{\mu} = (ct, \mathbf{x} )&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{v} t &lt;/math&gt; is the position in 3-dimensional space of the particle, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity in 3-dimensional space and &lt;math&gt; c &lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]].

The "length" of the vector is a Lorentz scalar and is given by

:&lt;math&gt; x_{\mu} x^{\mu} = \eta_{\mu \nu} x^{\mu} x^{\nu} =  (ct)^2 -  \mathbf{x} \cdot \mathbf{x} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  (c\tau)^2&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is the proper time as measured by a clock in the rest frame of the particle and the [[Minkowski metric]] is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\eta^{\mu\nu} =\eta_{\mu\nu} = \begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.

This is a time-like metric.

Often the alternate signature of the [[Minkowski metric]] is used in which the signs of the ones are reversed.

:&lt;math&gt;\eta^{\mu\nu} =\eta_{\mu\nu} = \begin{pmatrix}
-1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.

This is a space-like metric.

In the Minkowski metric the space-like interval &lt;math&gt; s &lt;/math&gt; is defined as

:&lt;math&gt; x_{\mu} x^{\mu} = \eta_{\mu \nu} x^{\mu} x^{\nu} =   \mathbf{x} \cdot \mathbf{x} - (ct)^2 \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  s^2 &lt;/math&gt;.

We use the space-like Minkowski metric in the rest of this article.

===The length of a velocity vector===

[[Image:Fermi walker 2.png|frame|left|The velocity vectors in spacetime for a particle at two different speeds. In relativity an acceleration is equivalent to a rotation in spacetime]]

The velocity in spacetime is defined as

:&lt;math&gt; v^{\mu} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  {dx^{\mu} \over d\tau} = \left (c {dt \over d\tau},  { dt \over d\tau}{d\mathbf{x} \over dt} \right ) =  \left ( \gamma c,  \gamma { \mathbf{v} }  \right ) = \gamma \left (  c, { \mathbf{v} }  \right )&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; \gamma \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\   { 1 \over {\sqrt {1 - {{\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{v} } \over c^2} } } } &lt;/math&gt;.

The magnitude of the 4-velocity is a Lorentz scalar,

:&lt;math&gt; v_{\mu} v^{\mu} = -c^2\,&lt;/math&gt;.

Hence, c is a Lorentz scalar.

===The inner product of acceleration and velocity===

The 4-acceleration is given by

:&lt;math&gt; a^{\mu} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  {dv^{\mu} \over d\tau} &lt;/math&gt;.

The 4-acceleration is always perpendicular to the 4-velocity

:&lt;math&gt; 0 = {1 \over 2} {d \over d\tau} \left ( v_{\mu}v^{\mu} \right ) = {d v_{\mu} \over d\tau}  v^{\mu} = a_{\mu} v^{\mu} &lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore, we can regard acceleration in spacetime as simply a rotation of the 4-velocity. The inner product of the acceleration and the velocity is a Lorentz scalar and is zero. This rotation is simply an expression of energy conservation:

:&lt;math&gt; {d E \over d\tau} = \mathbf{F} \cdot { \mathbf{v}} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; E &lt;/math&gt; is the energy of a particle and &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} &lt;/math&gt; is the 3-force on the particle.

==Energy, rest mass, 3-momentum, and 3-speed from 4-momentum==

The 4-momentum of a particle is

:&lt;math&gt; p^{\mu} = m v^{\mu} =   \left ( \gamma m c,  \gamma {  m \mathbf{v} }  \right ) = \left ( \gamma m c,   {   \mathbf{p} }  \right ) = \left ( {E \over c } ,   {   \mathbf{p} }  \right ) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; m &lt;/math&gt; is the particle rest mass, &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{p} &lt;/math&gt; is the momentum in 3-space, and

:&lt;math&gt; E = \gamma m c^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

is the energy of the particle.

===Measurement of the energy of a particle===

Consider a second particle with 4-velocity &lt;math&gt; u &lt;/math&gt; and a 3-velocity &lt;math&gt;  \mathbf{u}_2 &lt;/math&gt;. In the rest frame of the second particle the inner product of &lt;math&gt; u &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt; is proportional to the energy of the first particle

:&lt;math&gt; p_{\mu} u^{\mu} = -  { E_1}  &lt;/math&gt;

where the subscript 1 indicates the first particle.

Since the relationship is true in the rest frame of the second particle, it is true in any reference frame. &lt;math&gt; E_1 &lt;/math&gt;, the energy of the first particle in the frame of the second particle, is a Lorentz scalar. Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt;  { E_1} =  \gamma_1 \gamma_2 m_1 c^2 - \gamma_2 \mathbf{p}_1 \cdot \mathbf{u}_2  &lt;/math&gt;

in any inertial reference frame, where &lt;math&gt;  E_1 &lt;/math&gt; is still the energy of the first particle in the frame of the second particle .

===Measurement of the rest mass of the particle===

In the rest frame of the particle the inner product of the momentum is

:&lt;math&gt; p_{\mu} p^{\mu} = - (mc)^2  \,&lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore, the rest mass (m) is a Lorentz scalar. The relationship remains true independent of the frame in which the inner product is calculated.
In many cases the rest mass is written as &lt;math&gt; m_{0} &lt;/math&gt; to avoid confusion with the relativistic mass, which is &lt;math&gt; \gamma m_{0} &lt;/math&gt;

===Measurement of the 3-momentum of the particle===

Note that

:&lt;math&gt;  \left ( p_{\mu} u^{\mu} /c \right )  ^2  + p_{\mu} p^{\mu} = { E_1^2 \over c^2 } -(mc)^2 = \left ( \gamma_1^2 -1 \right ) (mc)^2 = \gamma_1^2 { {\mathbf{v}_1 \cdot \mathbf{v}_1 } }m^2 = \mathbf{p}_1 \cdot \mathbf{p}_1&lt;/math&gt;.

The square of the magnitude of the 3-momentum of the particle as measured in the frame of the second particle is a Lorentz scalar.

===Measurement of the 3-speed of the particle===

The 3-speed, in the frame of the second particle, can be constructed from two Lorentz scalars

:&lt;math&gt; v_1^2 = \mathbf{v}_1 \cdot \mathbf{v}_1  = { { \mathbf{p}_1 \cdot \mathbf{p}_1 c^4 } \over  { E_1^2  } } &lt;/math&gt;.

==More complicated scalars==

Scalars may also be constructed from the tensors and vectors, from the contraction of tensors (such as &lt;math&gt;F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;), or combinations of contractions of tensors and vectors (such as &lt;math&gt;g_{\mu\nu}x^{\mu}x^{\nu}&lt;/math&gt;).

According to the teachings of Mahāyāna traditions, "Mahāyāna" also refers to the path of the [[Bodhisattva]] seeking complete enlightenment for the benefit of all sentient beings, also called "Bodhisattvayāna", or the "Bodhisattva Vehicle".&lt;ref name="autogenerated38"&gt;[[Damien Keown]] (2003), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=985a1M7L1NcC&amp;pg=PA38 A Dictionary of Buddhism]'', [[Oxford University Press]], p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|"The Mahayana, 'Great Vehicle' or 'Great Carriage' (for carrying all beings to nirvana), is also, and perhaps more correctly and accurately, known as the Bodhisattvayana, the bodhisattva's vehicle." - Warder, A.K. (3rd edn. 1999). ''Indian Buddhism'': p. 338}} A bodhisattva who has accomplished this goal is called a [[samyaksaṃbuddha]], or "fully enlightened Buddha". A samyaksaṃbuddha can establish the [[Dharma]] and lead disciples to enlightenment. Mahayana Buddhists teach that enlightenment can be attained in a single lifetime, and this can be accomplished even by a layperson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mahayana Buddhism:  What is Mahayana Buddhism?|url=http://www.religionfacts.com/mahayana|website=religionfacts.com|publisher=[[ReligionFacts]]|accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mahāyāna tradition is the largest major tradition of Buddhism existing today, with 53.2% of practitioners, compared to 35.8% for [[Theravada]] and 5.7% for [[Vajrayana]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson |first1=Todd M. |last2=Grim |first2=Brian J. |title=The World's Religions in Figures: An Introduction to International Religious Demography |url=http://media.johnwiley.com.au/product_data/excerpt/47/04706745/0470674547-196.pdf |accessdate=2 September 2013 |year=2013 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |location=Hoboken, NJ |page=36 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020100448/http://media.johnwiley.com.au/product_data/excerpt/47/04706745/0470674547-196.pdf |archivedate=20 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the course of its history, Mahāyāna Buddhism spread from India to various other [[South Asia|South]], [[East Asia|East]] and [[Southeast Asia]]n countries such as [[Bangladesh]], [[Nepal]], [[Bhutan]], [[China]], [[Taiwan]], [[Mongolia]], [[Korea]], [[Japan]], [[Vietnam]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]]. Mahayana Buddhism also spread to other South and Southeast Asian countries, such as [[Afghanistan]], [[Thailand]], [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], the [[Maldives]], [[Pakistan]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Burma]], [[Iran]] and other Central Asian countries before being replaced by Theravada Buddhism or other religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sZRGAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA95&amp;lpg=PA95&amp;dq=buddhist+viharas+found+in+modern+day+iran&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6fa8kamUbK&amp;sig=TrrlAWcGC-OtT9yWpqHTrnfrPG0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjxxY-w8ZPYAhUOw2MKHbBkCpIQ6AEIdDAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=buddhist%20viharas%20found%20in%20modern%20day%20iran&amp;f=false |last=Foltz |first=Richard |title=Religions of Iran:From Prehistory to the Present |page=95 |quote=In the centuries before the Arab conquests Buddhism was spread throughout the eastern Iranian world.

Large Mahāyāna scholastic centers thrived during the latter period of Buddhism in India, between the seventh and twelfth centuries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Major traditions of Mahāyāna Buddhism today include [[Chan Buddhism]], [[Korean Seon]], [[Japanese Zen]], [[Pure Land Buddhism]], [[Nichiren Buddhism]] and [[Buddhism in Vietnam|Vietnamese Buddhism]]. It may also include the [[Vajrayana]] traditions of [[Tiantai]],  [[Tendai]], [[Shingon Buddhism]], and [[Tibetan Buddhism]], which add esoteric teachings to the Mahāyāna tradition.

==Etymology==

According to Jan Nattier, the term ''Mahāyāna'' ("Great Vehicle") was originally an honorary synonym for ''Bodhisattvayāna'' ("[[Bodhisattva]] Vehicle")&lt;ref name="Nattier, Jan 2003 p. 174"&gt;Nattier, Jan (2003), ''A few good men: the Bodhisattva path according to the Inquiry of Ugra'': p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;— the vehicle of a bodhisattva seeking [[buddhahood]] for the benefit of all sentient beings.&lt;ref name="autogenerated38"/&gt; The term ''Mahāyāna'' (which had earlier been used simply as an epithet for Buddhism itself) was therefore adopted at an early date as a synonym for the path and the teachings of the bodhisattvas. Since it was simply an honorary term for ''Bodhisattvayāna'', the adoption of the term ''Mahāyāna'' and its application to Bodhisattvayāna did not represent a significant turning point in the development of a Mahāyāna tradition.&lt;ref name="Nattier, Jan 2003 p. 174"/&gt;

The earliest Mahāyāna texts often use the term ''Mahāyāna'' as a synonym for ''Bodhisattvayāna'', but the term ''[[Hinayana|Hīnayāna]]'' is comparatively rare in the earliest sources. The presumed dichotomy between ''Mahāyāna'' and ''Hīnayāna'' can be deceptive, as the two terms were not actually formed in relation to one another in the same era.&lt;ref&gt;Nattier, Jan (2003), ''A few good men: the Bodhisattva path according to the Inquiry of Ugra'': p. 172&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the earliest and most important references to ''Mahāyāna'' are those that occur in the ''[[Lotus Sutra|Lotus Sūtra]]'' (Skt. ''Saddharma Puṇḍarīka Sūtra'') dating between the 1st century BCE and the 1st century CE.&lt;ref&gt;W. Rahula, (1996). [http://www.budsas.org/ebud/ebdha125.htm ''Theravada - Mahayana Buddhism'']; in: "Gems of Buddhist Wisdom", Buddhist Missionary Society, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia&lt;/ref&gt; Seishi Karashima has suggested that the term first used in an earlier [[Gāndhārī language|Gandhāri]] [[Prakrit]] version of the ''Lotus Sūtra'' was not the term ''mahāyāna'' but the Prakrit word ''mahājāna'' in the sense of ''mahājñāna'' (great knowing).&lt;ref name=Williams2004&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Buddhism. Vol. 3. The origins and nature of Mahāyāna Buddhism.'' Routledge. 2004. p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karashima, Seishi (2000), [https://web.archive.org/web/20070705053037/http://iriab.soka.ac.jp/orc/Publications/ARIRIAB/pdf/ARIRIAB-04.pdf Who composed the Lotus Sutra?], Annual Report of The International Research Institute for Advanced Buddhology at Soka University  4, p. 170 (note 115)&lt;/ref&gt; At a later stage when the early Prakrit word was converted into Sanskrit, this ''mahājāna'', being phonetically ambivalent, was mistakenly converted into ''mahāyāna'', possibly because of what may have been a double meaning in the famous [[Upaya#Parable of the burning house|Parable of the Burning House]], which talks of three vehicles or carts (Skt: ''yāna'').{{refn|group=note|Karashima: "I have assumed that, in the earliest stage of the transmission of ''the Lotus Sūtra'', the Middle Indic forn ''jāṇa'' or *''jāna'' (Pkt &amp;lt; Skt ''jñāna'', ''yāna'') had stood in these places ... I have assumed, further, that the Mahāyānist terms ''buddha-yānā'' ("the Buddha-vehicle"), ''mahāyāna'' ("the great vehicle"), ''hīnayāna'' ("the inferior vehicle") meant originally ''buddha-jñāna'' ("buddha-knowledge"), ''mahājñāna'' ("great knowledge") and ''hīnajñāna'' ("inferior knowledge")." Karashima, Seishi (2001). Some Features of the Language of the Saddharma-puṇḍarīka-sūtra, ''Indo-Iranian Journal'' 44: 207-230}}&lt;ref name=Williams2004/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karashima, Seishi (2015), [https://web.archive.org/web/20150526143324/http://iriab.soka.ac.jp/orc/Publications/ARIRIAB/pdf/ARIRIAB-18.pdf Vehicle (yāna) and Wisdom (jñāna) in the Lotus Sutra - the Origin of the Notion of yāna in Mahayāna Buddhism], Annual Report of The International Research Institute for Advanced Buddhology at Soka University 18, 163-196&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins===

The origins of Mahāyāna are still not completely understood.&lt;ref name="Hirakawa Akira 1993, p. 260"&gt;Akira, Hirakawa (translated and edited by Paul Groner) (1993. ''A History of Indian Buddhism''. Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass: p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest Western views of Mahāyāna assumed that it existed as a separate school in competition with the so-called "Hīnayāna" schools. The earliest Mahāyāna texts often depict strict adherence to the path of a bodhisattva, and engagement in the ascetic ideal of a monastic life in the wilderness, akin to the ideas expressed in the ''[[Rhinoceros Sutra|Rhinoceros Sūtra]]''.{{refn|group=note|"As scholars have moved away from this limited corpus, and have begun to explore a wider range of Mahayana sūtras, they have stumbled on, and have started to open up, a literature that is often stridently ascetic and heavily engaged in reinventing the forest ideal, an individualistic, antisocial, ascetic ideal that is encapsulated in the apparently resurrected image of “wandering alone like a rhinoceros”. ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism'' (2004): p. 494}}

The earliest textual evidence of "Mahāyāna" comes from [[sūtras]] originating around the beginning of the common era. Jan Nattier has noted that some of the earliest Mahāyāna texts such as the ''[[Ugrapariprccha Sutra|Ugraparipṛccha Sūtra]]'' use the term "Mahāyāna", yet there is no doctrinal difference between Mahāyāna in this context and the early schools, and that "Mahāyāna" referred rather to the rigorous emulation of [[Gautama Buddha]] in the path of a bodhisattva seeking to become a fully enlightened buddha.&lt;ref name="Nattier, Jan 2003 p. 193-194"&gt;Nattier, Jan (2003), ''A few good men: the Bodhisattva path according to the Inquiry of Ugra'': p. 193-194&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also no evidence that Mahāyāna ever referred to a separate formal school or sect of Buddhism, but rather that it existed as a certain set of ideals, and later doctrines, for bodhisattvas.&lt;ref name="Nattier, Jan 2003 p. 193-194"/&gt; Paul Williams has also noted that the Mahāyāna never had nor ever attempted to have a separate [[Vinaya]] or ordination lineage from the [[early schools of Buddhism]], and therefore each [[bhikkhu|bhikṣu]] or [[bhikkhuni|bhikṣuṇī]] adhering to the Mahāyāna formally belonged to an early school. Membership in these ''nikāyas'', or monastic sects, continues today with the [[Dharmaguptaka]] nikāya in East Asia, and the [[Mulasarvastivada|Mūlasarvāstivāda]] nikāya in [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. Therefore, Mahāyāna was never a separate rival sect of the early schools.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul (2008) ''Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations'': pp. 4-5&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Harrison clarifies that while monastic Mahāyānists belonged to a nikāya, not all members of a nikāya were Mahāyānists.&lt;ref&gt;Guang Xing. The Concept of the Buddha: Its Evolution from Early Buddhism to the Trikaya Theory. 2004. p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; From Chinese monks visiting India, we now know that both Mahāyāna and non-Mahāyāna monks in India often lived in the same monasteries side by side.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul (2000) ''Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition'': p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible that, formally, Mahāyāna would have been understood as a group of monks or nuns within a larger monastery taking a vow together (known as a "''kriyākarma''") to memorize and study a Mahāyāna text or texts.

The Chinese monk [[Yijing (monk)|Yijing]], who visited India in the 7th century CE, distinguishes Mahāyāna from Hīnayāna as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul (2008) ''Mahāyāna Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations'': p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Both adopt one and the same Vinaya, and they have in common the prohibitions of the five offences, and also the practice of the [[Four Noble Truths]]. Those who venerate the bodhisattvas and read the Mahayana sūtras are called the Mahāyānists, while those who do not perform these are called the Hīnayānists.}}

Much of the early extant evidence for the origins of Mahāyāna comes from early Chinese translations of Mahāyāna texts. These Mahāyāna teachings were first propagated into [[China]] by [[Lokaksema (Buddhist monk)|Lokakṣema]], the first translator of Mahāyāna sūtras into [[Chinese language|Chinese]] during the 2nd century CE.{{refn|group=note|"The most important evidence&amp;nbsp;— in fact the only evidence&amp;nbsp;— for situating the emergence of the Mahayana around the beginning of the common era was not Indian evidence at all, but came from China. Already by the last quarter of the 2nd century CE, there was a small, seemingly idiosyncratic collection of substantial Mahayana sutras translated into what Erik Zürcher calls 'broken Chinese' by an Indoscythian, whose Indian name has been reconstructed as Lokaksema." ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism'' (2004): p. 492}}

===Earliest Mahayana sutras===

Based on the testimony of [[Chandrakirti|Candrakīrti]] (7th cent.) several scholars have suggested that the [[Prajnaparamita|Prajñāpāramitā sūtras]], which are among the earliest [[Mahayana sutras]],&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Buddhist Thought.'' Routledge, 2000, pages 131.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations 2nd edition.'' Routledge, 2009, pg. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; developed among the [[Mahāsāṃghika]] along the [[Krishna River|Kṛṣṇa River]] in the [[Andhra Pradesh#Early history|Āndhra]] region of southern India.&lt;ref name=Xing65-66&gt;Guang Xing. ''The Concept of the Buddha: Its Evolution from Early Buddhism to the Trikaya Theory.'' 2004. pp. 65-66 "Several scholars have suggested that the Prajñāpāramitā probably developed among the Mahasamghikas in Southern India, in the Andhra country, on the Krishna River."&lt;/ref&gt; However, more recently Seishi Karashima has argued for their origin in the Gandhara region.&lt;ref&gt;Karashima, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The earliest Mahāyāna sūtras include the very first versions of the [[Prajñāpāramitā]] genre, along with texts concerning [[Aksobhya|Akṣobhya Buddha]], which were probably written down in the 1st century BCE in the south of India.&lt;ref name="Hirakawa Akira 1993, p. 263"&gt;Akira, Hirakawa (translated and edited by Paul Groner) (1993. ''A History of Indian Buddhism''. Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass: pp. 253, 263, 268&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The south (of India) was then vigorously creative in producing Mahayana Sutras"&amp;nbsp;– Warder, A.K. (3rd edn. 1999). ''Indian Buddhism'': p. 335.&lt;/ref&gt; Guang Xing states, "Several scholars have suggested the Prajñāpāramitā probably developed among the Mahāsāṃghikas in southern India, in the Āndhra country, on the Kṛṣṇa River."&lt;ref name=Xing65-66/&gt; [[A.K. Warder]] believes that "the Mahāyāna originated in the south of India and almost certainly in the Āndhra country."&lt;ref&gt;Warder, A.K. ''Indian Buddhism''. 2000. p. 313&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthony Barber and Sree Padma note that "historians of Buddhist thought have been aware for quite some time that such pivotally important Mahayana Buddhist thinkers as [[Nāgārjuna]], [[Dignaga]], [[Candrakīrti]], [[Āryadeva]], and [[Bhavaviveka]], among many others, formulated their theories while living in Buddhist communities in Āndhra."&lt;ref&gt;Padma, Sree. Barber, Anthony W. ''Buddhism in the Krishna River Valley of Andhra.'' SUNY Press 2008, pg. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; They note that the ancient Buddhist sites in the lower Kṛṣṇa Valley, including [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amaravati]], [[Nagarjunakonda|Nāgārjunakoṇḍā]] and [[Jaggaiahpet|Jaggayyapeṭa]] "can be traced to at least the third century BCE, if not earlier."&lt;ref&gt;Padma, Sree. Barber, Anthony W. ''Buddhism in the Krishna River Valley of Andhra.'' SUNY Press 2008, pg. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Akira Hirakawa notes the "evidence suggests that many Early Mahayana scriptures originated in South India."&lt;ref&gt;Akira, Hirakawa (translated and edited by Paul Groner) (1993. ''A History of Indian Buddhism''. Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass: p. 252, 253&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars think that the earliest Mahāyāna sūtras were mainly composed in the south of India, and later the activity of writing additional scriptures was continued in the north.{{refn|group=note|Warder: "The sudden appearance of large numbers of (Mahayana) teachers and texts (in North India in the second century AD) would seem to require some previous preparation and development, and this we can look for in the South." - Warder, A.K. (3rd edn. 1999). ''Indian Buddhism'': p. 335.}} However, the assumption that the presence of an evolving body of Mahāyāna scriptures implies the contemporaneous existence of distinct religious movement called "Mahāyāna", may be a serious misstep.{{refn|group=note|"But even apart from the obvious weaknesses inherent in arguments of this kind there is here the tacit equation of a body of literature with a religious movement, an assumption that evidence for the presence of one proves the existence of the other, and this may be a serious misstep." - ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism'' (2004): p. 493}} Some scholars further speculate that the [[Prajñāpāramitā]] sūtras were written in response to the ultrarealism of [[abhidharma]].&lt;ref&gt;Skilton, Andrew (2004 ). ''A Concise History of Buddhism.'' p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some early Mahāyāna sūtras were translated by the [[Kushan|Kuṣāṇa]] monk [[Lokaksema (Buddhist monk)|Lokakṣema]], who came to China from the kingdom of [[Gandhara|Gandhāra]]. His first translations to Chinese were made in the Chinese capital of [[Luoyang]] between 178 and 189 CE.&lt;ref&gt;''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism'' (2004): p. 492&lt;/ref&gt; Some Mahāyāna sūtras translated during the 2nd century CE include the following:&lt;ref&gt;Akira, Hirakawa (translated and edited by Paul Groner) (1993).

This corpus of texts often emphasizes ascetic practices and forest dwelling, absorbed in states of meditative concentration.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul (2008) ''Mahāyāna Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations:'' p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Harrison points to the enthusiasm in the Lokakṣema sūtra corpus for the extra ascetic practices, for dwelling in the forest, and above all for states of meditative absorption (''[[Samadhi (Buddhism)|samādhi]]''). Meditation and meditative states seem to have occupied a central place in early Mahāyāna, certainly because of their spiritual efficacy but also because they may have given access to fresh revelations and inspiration.}}

===Earliest inscriptions===

The earliest stone inscription containing a recognizably Mahāyāna formulation and a mention of the Buddha [[Amitābha]] was found in the Indian subcontinent in [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]], and dated to around 180 CE. Remains of a statue of a Buddha bear the [[Brāhmī script|Brāhmī]] inscription: "Made in the year 28 of the reign of King [[Huvishka|Huviṣka]], ... for the Blessed One, the Buddha Amitābha."

''Early Buddhist Transmission and Trade Networks.'' 2010. p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of the name "Mahāyāna" in Indian inscriptions in the period before the 5th century is very limited in comparison to the multiplicity of Mahāyāna writings transmitted from [[Central Asia]] to [[China]] at that time.{{refn|group=note|"Certainly, we have for this period an extensive body of inscriptions from virtually all parts of India. ...

===Early Mahāyāna Buddhism===

During the period of early Mahāyāna Buddhism, four major types of thought developed: [[Madhyamaka|Mādhyamaka]], [[Yogacara|Yogācāra]], [[Buddha-nature]] (''Tathāgatagarbha''), and [[Buddhist logic]] as the last and most recent.&lt;ref&gt;Akira, Hirakawa (translated and edited by Paul Groner) (1993. ''A History of Indian Buddhism''. Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass: p. 8,9&lt;/ref&gt; In India, the two main philosophical schools of the Mahāyāna were the Mādhyamaka and the later Yogācāra.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Peter (1993). ''An Introduction to Buddhism.'' Cambridge University Press: p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Kushan Empire]], Mahayana Buddhism teachings encouraged societies to give generous donations to the Buddhist monasteries, which gave the people "religious merits".&lt;ref&gt;Xinru Liu, ''The Silk Road in World History'', (New York: Oxford University Press, 2010), 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier stage forms of Mahāyāna such as the doctrines of Prajñāpāramitā, Yogācāra, Buddha Nature, and the [[Pure Land Buddhism|Pure Land]] teachings are still popular in East Asia. In some cases these have spawned new developments, while in others they are treated in the more traditional syncretic manner. Paul Williams has noted that in this tradition in the Far East, primacy has always been given to study of the sūtras.&lt;ref name="Williams, Paul 1989 p.103"&gt;Williams, Paul (1989). ''Mahayana Buddhism'': p.103&lt;/ref&gt;

==Doctrine==
[[File:Gandhara, bodhisattva assiso, II sec..JPG|thumb|upright|[[Bodhisattva]] seated in [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyāna]]. [[Afghanistan]], 2nd century]]

Few things can be said with certainty about Mahāyāna Buddhism,{{refn|group=note|"There are, it seems, very few things that can be said with certainty about Mahayana Buddhism", ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism'' (2004): p. 492}} especially its early Indian form, other than that the Buddhism practiced in China, Indonesia, Vietnam, Korea, Tibet, and Japan is Mahāyāna Buddhism.{{refn|group=note|"But apart from the fact that it can be said with some certainty that the Buddhism embedded in China, Korea, Tibet, and Japan is Mahayana Buddhism, it is no longer clear what else can be said with certainty about Mahayana Buddhism itself, and especially about its earlier, and presumably formative, period in India.", ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism'' (2004): p. 492}} Mahāyāna can be described as a loosely bound collection of many teachings with large and expansive doctrines that are able to exist simultaneously.{{refn|group=note|"It has become increasingly clear that Mahayana Buddhism was never one thing, but rather, it seems, a loosely bound bundle of many, and&amp;nbsp;— like Walt Whitman&amp;nbsp;— was large and could contain, in both senses of the term, contradictions, or at least antipodal elements." - ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism'' (2004): p. 492}}

Mahāyāna constitutes an inclusive tradition characterized by plurality and the adoption of new [[Mahayana sutras]] in addition to the earlier [[Āgama (Buddhism)|āgama]]s. Mahāyāna sees itself as penetrating further and more profoundly into the Buddha's [[Dharma]]. An Indian commentary on the ''[[Mahāyānasaṃgraha]]'', entitled ''Vivṛtaguhyārthapiṇḍavyākhyā'', gives a classification of teachings according to the capabilities of the audience:&lt;ref&gt;Hamar, Imre. ''Reflecting Mirrors: Perspectives on Huayan Buddhism.'' 2007. p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[A]ccording to disciples' grades, the Dharma is [classified as] inferior and superior. For example, the inferior was taught to the merchants [[Trapusa and Bahalika|Trapuṣa and Ballika]] because they were ordinary men; the middle was [[Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta|taught to the group of five]] because they were at the stage of saints; the eightfold ''Prajñāpāramitās'' were taught to bodhisattvas, and [the ''Prajñāpāramitās''] are superior in eliminating conceptually imagined forms.}}

There is also a tendency in Mahāyāna sūtras to regard adherence to these sūtras as generating spiritual benefits greater than those that arise from being a follower of the non-Mahāyāna approaches to Dharma. Thus the ''[[Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra]]'' claims that the Buddha said that devotion to Mahāyāna is inherently superior in its virtues to following the [[śrāvaka]] or [[pratyekabuddha]] paths.&lt;ref&gt;Hookham, Dr. Shenpen, trans. (1998). ''The Shrimaladevi Sutra''. Oxford: Longchen Foundation: p.27&lt;/ref&gt;

The fundamental principles of Mahāyāna doctrine were based on the possibility of universal liberation from [[dukkha]] for all beings (hence the "Great Vehicle") and the existence of buddhas and bodhisattvas embodying Buddha-nature. The Pure Land school of Mahāyāna simplifies the expression of [[Faith in Buddhism|faith]] by allowing salvation to be alternatively obtained through the grace of the buddha [[Amitābha]] by having faith and devoting oneself to [[nianfo|mindfulness of the Buddha]]. This [[Buddhist devotion|devotional lifestyle]] of Buddhism has greatly contributed to the success of Mahāyāna in East Asia, where spiritual elements traditionally relied upon mindfulness of the Buddha, mantras and [[dhāraṇī]]s, and reading sutras. In Chinese Buddhism, most monks, let alone lay people, practice Pure Land, some combining it with [[Chan Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;Welch (1967). ''Practice of Chinese Buddhism''. Harvard: p. 396&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Mahāyāna schools believe in supernatural bodhisattvas who devote themselves to the [[pāramitā]]s, ultimate knowledge (Skt. ''sarvajñāna''), and the liberation of all sentient beings.

===Bodhisattva===
{{Main|Bodhisattva}}
The Mahāyāna tradition holds that pursuing only the release from suffering and attainment of Nirvāṇa is too narrow an aspiration, because it lacks the motivation of actively resolving to liberate all other sentient beings from [[saṃsāra]], "suffering". One who engages in this path is called a bodhisattva. Bodhisattvas could reach nirvana, but they believe it is more important to help others on their path of finding nirvana rather than committing fully to nirvana themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Xinru Liu, ''The Silk Road in World History'', (New York: Oxford University Press, 2010), 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

The defining characteristic of a bodhisattva is [[bodhicitta]], the intention to achieve omniscient Buddhahood ([[Trikaya]]) as fast as possible, so that one may benefit infinite sentient beings. Sometimes the term bodhisattva is used more restrictively to refer to those sentient beings on the [[Bhūmi (Buddhism)|grounds]]. As Ananda Coomaraswamy notes, "The most essential part of the Mahayana is its emphasis on the Bodhisattva ideal, which replaces that of the [[arhat]], or ranks before it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Coomaraswamy|first=Ananda |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Buddha and the Gospel of Buddhism |year=1975 |publisher=University Books, Inc. |location=Boston|page=229 |lccn=64056434}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mahāyāna teachings, being a high-level bodhisattva involves possessing a mind of great compassion and [[prajñā (Buddhism)|prajñā]] (wisdom) to realize the reality of inherent [[Śūnyatā|emptiness]] and [[pratītyasamutpāda|dependent origination]]. Mahāyāna teaches that the practitioner will finally realize the attainment of [[Buddhahood]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Six pāramitās are traditionally required for bodhisattvas:{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Expedient means===
{{Main|Upaya}}
Expedient means&lt;ref&gt;Pye, Michael (1978). Skilful Means&amp;nbsp;— A concept in Mahayana Buddhism. London, UK: Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co. Ltd. {{ISBN|0-7156-1266-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Skt. ''[[upaya|upāya]]'') is found in the ''[[Lotus Sutra]]'', one of the earliest-dated sutras, and is accepted in all Mahāyāna schools of thought. It is any effective method that aids awakening. It does not necessarily mean that some particular method is "untrue" but is simply any means or stratagem that is conducive to spiritual growth and leads beings to awakening and [[nirvana]]. Expedient means could thus be certain motivational words for a particular listener or even the [[Noble Eightfold Path]] itself. Basic Buddhism (what Mahāyāna would term ''[[śrāvakayāna]]'' or ''[[pratyekabuddhayāna]]'') is an expedient method for helping people begin the noble Buddhist path and advance quite far. But the path is not wholly traversed, according to some schools, until the practitioner has striven for and attained Buddhahood for the liberation of all other sentient beings from suffering.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Some scholars have stated that the exercise of expedient means, "the ability to adapt one's message to the audience, is also of enormous importance in the Pāli canon."{{refn|group=note|Gombrich: "It is true that the term translated 'expounding in means', upaya-kausalya, is post-canonical, but the exercise of expounding to which it refers, the ability to adapt one's message to the audience, is of enormous importance in the Pali Canon." Gombrich, Richard F. (1997). ''How Buddhism Began''. Munshiram Manoharlal: p. 17}} In fact the Pāli term ''upāya-kosalla'' does occur in the Pāli Canon, in the ''Sangiti Sutta'' of the ''Digha Nikāya''.&lt;ref&gt;Walshe, M. trans. (1987). ''Thus Have I Heard: the Long Discourses of the Buddha''. Wisdom: p. 486&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liberation===
Mahāyāna Buddhism includes a rich cosmology, with various Buddhas and bodhisattvas residing in different worlds and buddha-realms. The concept of [[trikaya|the three bodies]] (''trikāya'') supports these constructions, making the Buddha himself a transcendental figure. Dr. Guang Xing describes the Mahāyāna Buddha as "an omnipotent divinity endowed with numerous supernatural attributes and qualities ...[He] is described almost as an omnipotent and almighty godhead."&lt;ref&gt;Guang Xing (2005). ''The Three Bodies of the Buddha: The Origin and Development of the Trikaya Theory''. Oxford: Routledge Curzon: pp.1 and 85&lt;/ref&gt;

Under various conditions, the realms Buddha presides over could be attained by devotees after their death so, when reborn, they could strive towards buddhahood in the best possible conditions. Depending on the sect, liberation into a buddha-realm can be obtained by faith, visualization, or sometimes even by the repetition of Buddha's name. These practices are common in Pure Land Buddhism.{Dr. Guang Xing, The Three Bodies of the Buddha: The Origin and Development of the Trikaya Theory, RoutledgeCurzon, Oxford, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;1}

===Buddha nature===
[[File:Ajanta Ellora buddha statue aurangabad maharastra.jpg|thumb|The Buddha flanked by [[bodhisattva]]s. Cave 4, [[Ajanta Caves|Ajaṇṭā Caves]], [[Maharashtra|Mahārāṣtra]], India]]

{{Main|Buddha nature}}

''Buddha-nature'', ''Buddha-dhatu'' or ''Buddha Principle'' ([[Sanskrit|Skt]]: ''Buddha-dhātu'', ''Tathāgatagarbha''; [[Japanese language|Jap]]: ''Bussho''), is taught differently in various Mahayana Buddhism traditions. Broadly speaking Buddha-nature is concerned with ascertaining what allows sentient beings to become Buddhas.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul. ''Buddhist Thought.'' Routledge 2000, page 160.&lt;/ref&gt; The term, Buddha nature, is a translation of the Sanskrit coinage, 'Buddha-dhātu', which seems first to have appeared in the ''[[Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Paul Williams, ''Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations'', Second Edition, Routledge, Oxford, 2009, p. 317&lt;/ref&gt; where it refers to "a sacred nature that is the basis for [beings'] becoming buddhas",&lt;ref name="Kevin Trainor 2004, p. 207"&gt;Kevin Trainor, ''Buddhism: The Illustrated Guide'', Oxford University Press, 2004, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; and where it is also spoken of as the 'Self' (''atman'').&lt;ref name="Professor Michael Zimmermann 2002 pp. 82"&gt;Zimmermann, Michael (2002), [https://web.archive.org/web/20131111023508/http://iriab.soka.ac.jp/orc/Publications/BPPB/pdf/BPPB-06.pdf  ''A Buddha Within: The Tathāgatagarbhasūtra''], Biblotheca Philologica et Philosophica Buddhica VI, The International Research Institute for Advanced Buddhology, Soka University, pp. 82-83&lt;/ref&gt;

It is called ''Tathāgatagarbha'' ''Buddha-dhātu'' at the stage of sentient beings because it is covered with defilements, and it is called ''[[Dharmakaya|Dharmakāya]]'' at the stage of Buddhahood, because its pure nature is revealed.&lt;ref&gt;Xing Guang (2005), ''The Concept of the Buddha: Its Evolution from Early Buddhism to the Trikāya Theory'', p.88&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|The Dharmakaya is in "Tibetan Buddhism [...] considered to be equivalent to the mind of the Buddha", since it is synonymous with perfect enlightenment (saṃbodhi).&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of Buddhism "dharma-kaya", Oxford University Press 2003&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The teaching of a "Buddha nature" (Skt. ''tathāgatagarbha'') may be based on the "[[luminous mind]]" concept found in the ''[[Āgama (Buddhism)|Āgamas]]''. The essential idea, articulated in the Buddha nature sūtras, but not accepted by all Mahāyānists, is that no being is without a concealed but indestructible interior link to the awakening of ''[[bodhi]]'' and that this link is an uncreated element (''dhātu'') or principle deep inside each being, which constitutes the deathless, diamond-like "essence of the self".&lt;ref&gt;''Nirvāṇa Sūtra''&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2014}} The ''Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra'' states: "The essence of the Self (''ātman'') is the subtle Buddha nature..." while the later ''[[Lankavatara Sutra|Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra]]'' states that the Buddha nature might be taken to be self (''ātman''), but it is not. In the ''sagathakam'' section of that same sutra, however, the Tathagatagarbha as the Self is not denied, but affirmed: "The ''Atma'' [Self] characterised with purity is the state of self-realization; this is the Tathagata's Womb (''garbha''), which does not belong to the realm of the theorisers."&lt;ref&gt;Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki, ''The Lankavatara Sutra'', Prajna Press, Boulder, 1978, p. 282&lt;/ref&gt; In the Buddha nature class of sūtras, the word "self" (''ātman'') is used in a way defined by and specific to these sūtras. (See [[Atman (Buddhism)]].)

[[File:Descent of Amida and 25 Bodhisattvas (Fukushima Museum).jpg|thumb|150px|''Descent of [[Amitābha|Amida]] and 25 [[Bodhisattva]]s'', [[Kamakura period]] (1185-1333), [[Fukushima Museum]], [[Japan]]]]

According to some scholars, the Buddha nature discussed in some Mahāyāna sūtras does not represent a substantial self (''ātman''); rather, it is a positive language and expression of [[Shunyata|emptiness]] (''śūnyatā'') and represents the potentiality to realize Buddhahood through Buddhist practices.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071023073728/http://zencomp.com/greatwisdom/ebud/ebdha191.htm Heng-Ching Shih, ''The Significance Of "Tathagatagarbha"—A Positive Expression Of "Sunyata".'']&lt;/ref&gt; It is the "[[true self]]" in representing the innate aspect of the individual that makes actualizing the ultimate personality possible.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

The actual "seeing and knowing" of this Buddha essence is said to usher in nirvanic liberation. This Buddha essence or "Buddha nature" is stated to be found in every single person, ghost, god and sentient being. In the Buddha nature sūtras, the Buddha is portrayed as describing the Buddha essence as uncreated, deathless and ultimately beyond rational grasping or conceptualisation. Yet, it is this already real and present, hidden internal element of [[bodhi|awakeness]] (''bodhi'') that, according to the Buddha nature sūtras, prompts beings to seek liberation from worldly suffering, and lets them attain the spotless bliss that lies at the heart of their being. Once the veils of negative thoughts, feelings, and unwholesome behaviour (the ''[[Kleśā (Buddhism)|kleśas]]'') are eliminated from the mind and character, the indwelling Buddha principle (''Buddha-dhātu'': Buddha nature) can shine forth unimpededly and transform the seer into a Buddha.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Prior to the period of these sūtras, Mahāyāna [[metaphysics]] was dominated by teachings on [[Shunyata|emptiness]], in the form of [[Madhyamaka]] philosophy. The language used by this approach is primarily negative, and the Buddha nature genre of sūtras can be seen as an attempt to state orthodox Buddhist teachings of [[dependent origination]] and on the mysterious reality of nirvana using positive language instead, to prevent people from being turned away from Buddhism by a false impression of nihilism. In these sūtras the perfection of the wisdom of not-self is stated to be the true self; the ultimate goal of the path is then characterized using a range of positive language that had been used in Indian philosophy previously by essentialist philosophers, but was now transmuted into a new Buddhist vocabulary that described a being who has successfully completed the Buddhist path.&lt;ref&gt;King, Sallie B. [https://web.archive.org/web/20070927131119/http://www.nanzan-u.ac.jp/SHUBUNKEN/publications/nlarc/pdf/Pruning%20the%20bodhi%20tree/Pruning%209.pdf  ''The Doctrine of Buddha-Nature is impeccably Buddhist'']. In: Jamie Hubbard (ed.), Pruning the Bodhi Tree: The Storm Over Critical Buddhism, Univ of Hawaii Press 1997, pp. 174-179. {{ISBN|0824819497}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A different view is propounded by Tathagatagarbha specialist,  Michael Zimmermann, who sees key Buddha-nature sutras such as the ''Nirvana Sutra'' and the ''Tathagatagarbha Sutra'', as well as the ''Lankavatara Sutra'', enunciating an affirmative vision of an eternal, indestructible Buddhic Self. Zimmermann observes:&lt;ref name="Professor Michael Zimmermann 2002 pp. 82"/&gt;

{{quote|the existence of an eternal, imperishable self, that is, buddhahood, is definitely the basic point of the ''TGS'' [''Tathagatagarbha Sutra''] ... the ''Mahaparinirvanasutra'' and the ''Lankavatarasutra'' characterize the ''tathagatagarbha'' explicitly as ''atman'' [Self].}}

The ''[[Uttaratantra]]'' (an [[Exegesis|exegetical]] treatise on [[Buddha nature]]) sees Buddha nature not as [[samskrta|caused and conditioned]] (''saṃskṛta''), but as eternal, uncaused, unconditioned, and incapable of being destroyed, although temporarily concealed within worldly beings by adventitious defilements.&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian, C. D. (2005), ''Metaphysics and Mysticism in Mahayana Buddhism''. Delhi: Sri Satguru Publications: p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; According to C. D. Sebastian, the ''Uttaratantra's'' reference to a transcendental self (''[[Ātman (Buddhism)|ātma]]-[[paramita|pāramitā]]'') should be understood as "the unique essence of the universe",&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian, C. D. (2005), ''Metaphysics and Mysticism in Mahayana Buddhism''. Delhi: Sri Satguru Publications: p. 151; cf. also p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; thus the universal and [[immanent]] essence of Buddha nature is the same throughout time and space.&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian,  C. D. (2005), ''Metaphysics and Mysticism in Mahayana Buddhism''. Delhi: Sri Satguru Publications: p. 278&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scriptures==

===Āgamas===

{{Main|Mahayana sutras}}
Mahāyāna Buddhism takes the basic teachings of the Buddha as recorded in early scriptures as the starting point of its teachings, such as those concerning karma and rebirth, [[Anatman|anātman]], [[Shunyata|emptiness]], [[dependent origination]], and the [[Four Noble Truths]]. Mahāyāna Buddhists in East Asia have traditionally studied these teachings in the [[Āgama (Buddhism)|Āgamas]] preserved in the [[Chinese Buddhist canon]]. "Āgama" is the term used by those traditional Buddhist schools in India who employed Sanskrit for their basic canon. These correspond to the [[Nikāya]]s used by the Theravāda school. The surviving Āgamas in Chinese translation belong to at least two schools, while most of the Āgamas teachings were never translated into Tibetan.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

In addition to accepting the essential scriptures of the [[early Buddhist schools]] as valid, Mahāyāna Buddhism maintains large collections of sūtras that are not used or recognized by the Theravāda school. These were not recognized by some individuals in the early Buddhist schools. In other cases, Buddhist communities were divided along these doctrinal lines. In Mahāyāna Buddhism, the [[Mahayana sutras|Mahāyāna sūtras]] are often given greater authority than the Āgamas. The first of these Mahāyāna-specific writings were written probably around the 1st century BCE&lt;ref name="Hirakawa Akira 1993, p. 252"&gt;Akira, Hirakawa (translated and edited by Paul Groner) (1993). ''A History of Indian Buddhism''. Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass: p. 252&lt;/ref&gt; or 1st century CE.&lt;ref name="Buddhism 2004, page 293"&gt;''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism'' (2004): p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 4th century Mahāyāna abhidharma work ''Abhidharmasamuccaya'', [[Asanga|Asaṅga]] refers to the collection which contains the āgamas as the ''Śrāvakapiṭaka'' and associates it with the [[sravaka|śrāvaka]]s and [[pratyekabuddha]]s.&lt;ref name="autogenerated199"&gt;Boin-Webb, Sara (tr). Rahula, Walpola (tr). Asanga. ''Abhidharma Samuccaya: The Compendium of Higher Teaching.'' 2001. pp. 199-200&lt;/ref&gt; Asaṅga classifies the Mahāyāna sūtras as belonging to the ''Bodhisattvapiṭaka'', which is designated as the collection of teachings for bodhisattvas.&lt;ref name="autogenerated199"/&gt;

===Turnings of the Dharma Wheel===

Dating back at least to the ''[[Sandhinirmocana Sutra|Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra]]'' is a classification of the corpus of Buddhism into three categories, based on ways of understanding the nature of reality, known as the "[[three turnings of the wheel of dharma|Three Turnings of the Dharma Wheel]]". According to this view, there were three such "turnings":&lt;ref name=Kitagawa80&gt;[[Joseph Kitagawa|Kitagawa, Joseph Mitsuo]] (2002). ''The Religious Traditions of Asia: Religion, History, and Culture''. Routledge. {{ISBN|0-7007-1762-5}}: p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

#In the first turning, the Buddha taught the [[Four Noble Truths]] at [[Varanasi]] for those in the [[shravaka|śravaka]] vehicle. It is described as marvelous and wonderful, but requiring interpretation and occasioning controversy.&lt;ref name=Samdhinirmocana&gt;Keenan, John (2000). ''The Scripture on the Explication of the Underlying Meaning''. Numata Center. {{ISBN|1-886439-10-9}}: p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; The doctrines of the first turning are exemplified in the ''[[Dhammacakkapavattana Sutta|Dharmacakra Pravartana Sūtra]]''. This turning represents the earliest phase of the Buddhist teachings and the earliest period in the history of Buddhism.
#In the second turning, the Buddha taught the Mahāyāna teachings to the bodhisattvas, teaching that all phenomena have no-essence, no arising, no passing away, are originally quiescent, and essentially in cessation. This turning is also described as marvelous and wonderful, but requiring interpretation and occasioning controversy.&lt;ref name=Samdhinirmocana /&gt; Doctrine of the second turning is established in the Prajñāpāramitā teachings, first put into writing around 100 BCE. In Indian philosophical schools, it is exemplified by the Mādhyamaka school of [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna]].
#In the third turning, the Buddha taught similar teachings to the second turning, but for everyone in the three vehicles, including all the śravakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas. These were meant to be completely explicit teachings in their entire detail, for which interpretations would not be necessary, and controversy would not occur.&lt;ref name=Samdhinirmocana /&gt; These teachings were established by the ''Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra'' as early as the 1st or 2nd century CE.&lt;ref name="Powers_1993"&gt;{{Citation |last=Powers |first=John |year=1993 |title=Hermeneutics and tradition in the Saṃdhinirmocana-sūtra |publisher=Brill Academic Publishers |pages=4–11 |isbn=90-04-09826-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Indian philosophical schools, the third turning is exemplified by the Yogācāra school of Asaṅga and [[Vasubandhu]].

Some traditions of Tibetan Buddhism consider the teachings of Esoteric Buddhism and Vajrayāna to be the third turning of the Dharma Wheel. Tibetan teachers, particularly of the [[Gelug]]pa school, regard the second turning as the highest teaching, because of their particular interpretation of Yogācāra doctrine. The [[Tathagatagarbha|Buddha Nature]] teachings are normally included in the third turning of the wheel.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} The Chinese tradition has a different scheme.

The Chinese T'ien-T'ai believed the Buddha taught over Five Periods. These are:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Soka Gakkai Dictionary of Buddhism, 'Five Periods'&lt;/ref&gt;

# The Flower Garland Period.
# The Agama Period.
# The Correct and Equal Period (provisional Mahayana Sutras, including the Amida, Mahavairochana and Vimalakirti Sutras).
# The Wisdom Period (Perfection of Wisdom Sutras).
# The Lotus and Nirvana Period (when Shakyamuni taught from the standpoint of his Enlightenment).

===Early canon===
Scholars have noted that many key Mahāyāna ideas are closely connected to the earliest texts of Buddhism. The seminal work of Mahāyāna philosophy, [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna's]] ''[[Mulamadhyamakakarika|Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]]'', mentions the canon's ''Katyāyana Sūtra'' (SA 301) by name, and may be an extended commentary on that work.&lt;ref&gt;Kalupahana, David (2006). ''Mulamadhyamakakarika of Nagarjuna.'' Motilal Banarsidass: p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Nāgārjuna systematized the [[Madhyamaka|Mādhyamaka]] school of Mahāyāna philosophy. He may have arrived at his positions from a desire to achieve a consistent exegesis of the Buddha's doctrine as recorded in the canon. In his eyes the Buddha was not merely a forerunner, but the very founder of the Mādhyamaka system.&lt;ref&gt;Lindtner, Christian (1997). ''Master of Wisdom.'' Dharma Publishing: p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt; Nāgārjuna also referred to a passage in the canon regarding "[[Nirvana#Luminous consciousness|nirvanic consciousness]]" in two different works.&lt;ref&gt;Lindtner, Christian (1997). ''Master of Wisdom.'' Dharma Publishing: p. 322. Lindtner says that Nāgārjuna is referencing the DN.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yogacara|Yogācāra]], the other prominent Mahāyāna school in dialectic with the Mādhyamaka school, gave a special significance to the canon's ''Lesser Discourse on Emptiness'' (MA 190).&lt;ref&gt;Nagao, Gadjin M.; Kawamura, Leslie S., trans. (1991). ''Madhyamika and Yogachara.'' Albany: SUNY Press: p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; A passage there (which the discourse itself emphasizes) is often quoted in later Yogācāra texts as a true definition of [[Śūnyatā|emptiness]].&lt;ref&gt;Nagao, Gadjin M.; Kawamura, Leslie S., trans. (1991). ''Madhyamika and Yogachara.'' Albany: SUNY Press: p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Walpola Rahula]], the thought presented in the Yogācāra school's ''[[Abhidharma-samuccaya]]'' is undeniably closer to that of the Pali [[Nikayas]] than is that of the Theravadin [[Abhidhamma]].&lt;ref&gt;Dan Lusthaus, ''Buddhist Phenomenology.'' Routledge, 2002, page 44, note 5. Lusthaus draws attention to Rahula's ''Zen and the Taming of the Bull.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the Mādhyamikas and the Yogācārins saw themselves as preserving the Buddhist Middle Way between the extremes of nihilism (everything as unreal) and substantialism (substantial entities existing). The Yogācārins criticized the Mādhyamikas for tending towards nihilism, while the Mādhyamikas criticized the Yogācārins for tending towards substantialism.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Peter (1993). ''An Introduction to Buddhism.'' Cambridge University Press: p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Key Mahāyāna texts introducing the concepts of [[bodhicitta]] and [[Buddha nature]] also use language parallel to passages in the canon containing the Buddha's description of "[[luminous mind]]" and appear to have evolved from this idea. &lt;ref&gt;Analayo "The Luminous Mind in Theravāda and Dharmaguptaka Discourses" Journal of the Oxford Centre for Buddhist Studies, 2017, 13: 10-51;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Peter (1989).Consciousness Mysticism in the Discourses of the Buddha. In Werner, Karel ed., ''The Yogi and the Mystic.'' Curzon Press: p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theravāda school==
{{Main|Theravada}}

===Role of the Bodhisattva===
In the early Buddhist texts, and as taught by the modern Theravada school, the goal of becoming a teaching Buddha in a future life is viewed as the aim of a small group of individuals striving to benefit future generations after the current Buddha's teachings have been lost, but in the current age there is no need for most practitioners to aspire to this goal. Theravada texts do, however, hold that this is a more perfectly virtuous goal.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Peter (2000). ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics''. Cambridge University Press: p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Williams writes that some modern Theravada meditation masters in [[Thailand]] are popularly regarded as bodhisattvas.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Williams, ''Mahāyāna Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations.'' Taylor &amp; Francis, 1989, page 328.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Cholvijarn observes that prominent figures associated with the [[Dhammakaya Movement|Self perspective]] in Thailand have often been famous outside scholarly circles as well, among the wider populace, as Buddhist meditation masters and sources of miracles and sacred [[amulet]]s. Like perhaps some of the early Mahāyāna forest hermit monks, or the later Buddhist Tantrics, they have become people of power through their meditative achievements. They are widely revered, worshipped, and held to be arhats or (note!) bodhisattvas.}}

===Theravāda and Hīnayāna===
In the 7th century, the Chinese Buddhist monk [[Xuanzang]] describes the concurrent existence of the [[Mahavihara|Mahāvihara]] and the [[Abhayagiri Dagaba|Abhayagiri]] Vihara in [[Sri Lanka]]. He refers to the monks of the Mahāvihara as the "Hīnayāna Sthaviras" (''Theras''), and the monks of the Abhayagiri Vihara as the "Mahāyāna Sthaviras".&lt;ref&gt;Baruah, Bibhuti. ''Buddhist Sects and Sectarianism.'' 2008. p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; Xuanzang further writes:&lt;ref&gt;Hirakawa, Akira. Groner, Paul. ''A History of Indian Buddhism: From Śākyamuni to Early Mahāyāna.'' 2007. p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The Mahāvihāravāsins reject the Mahāyāna and practice the Hīnayāna, while the Abhayagirivihāravāsins study both Hīnayāna and Mahāyāna teachings and propagate the ''[[Tripiṭaka]]''.}}

The modern Theravāda school is usually described as belonging to Hīnayāna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Monier-Williams |first=Sir Monier |year=1889 |title=Buddhism in Its Connexion with Brāhmanism and Hindūism: And in Its Contrast with Christianity |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uiUVAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Buddhism&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1&amp;ei=ykWVSNfIPIbujgGgrbXqAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Buddhism&amp;f=false |publisher=John Murray}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gombrich&gt;Gombrich, Richard Francis (1988).

''The Oxford Handbook of Global Religions'': P.83&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors have argued that it should not be considered such from the Mahāyāna perspective. Their view is based on a different understanding of the concept of Hīnayāna. Rather than regarding the term as referring to any school of Buddhism that hasn't accepted the Mahāyāna canon and doctrines, such as those pertaining to the role of the bodhisattva,&lt;ref name=gombrich/&gt;&lt;ref name=gellner/&gt; these authors argue that the classification of a school as "Hīnayāna" should be crucially dependent on the adherence to a specific [[phenomenology of religion|phenomenological]] position. They point out that unlike the now-extinct [[Sarvastivada|Sarvāstivāda]] school, which was the primary object of Mahāyāna criticism, the Theravāda does not claim the existence of independent [[Dharma#In Buddhist phenomenology|entities]] (''dharmas''); in this it maintains the attitude of early Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, Frank J. and Mahinda, Deegalle (1996). ''Pali Buddhism.'' Routledge Press: p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;King, Richard (1999). ''Indian Philosophy: An Introduction to Hindu and Buddhist Thought.'' Edinburgh University Press: p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nyanaponika, Nyaponika Thera, Nyanaponika, Bhikkhu Bodhi (1998). ''Abhidhamma Studies: Buddhist Explorations of Consciousness and Time.'' Wisdom Publications: p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents of Mahāyāna Buddhism disagreed with the substantialist thought of the Sarvāstivādins and [[Sautrantika|Sautrāntikas]], and in emphasizing the doctrine of [[sunyata|emptiness]], Kalupahana holds that they endeavored to preserve the early teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Kalupahana, David (2006). ''Mulamadhyamakakarika of Nagarjuna.'' Motilal Banarsidass: p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The Theravādins too refuted the Sarvāstivādins and Sautrāntikas (and other schools) on the grounds that their theories were in conflict with the non-substantialism of the canon. The Theravāda arguments are preserved in the ''[[Kathavatthu|Kathāvatthu]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kalupahana, David (2006). ''Mulamadhyamakakarika of Nagarjuna.'' Motilal Banarsidass: p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some contemporary Theravādin figures have indicated a sympathetic stance toward the Mahāyāna philosophy found in texts such as the ''[[Heart Sutra|Heart Sūtra]]'' (Skt. ''Prajñāpāramitā Hṛdaya'') and Nāgārjuna's ''[[Mulamadhyamakakarika|Fundamental Stanzas on the Middle Way]]'' (Skt. ''Mūlamadhyamakakārikā'').&lt;ref&gt;Lopez, Donald S. and Dge-ʼdun-chos-ʼphel (2006). ''The Madman's Middle Way: Reflections on Reality of the Tibetan Monk Gendun Chopel.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3923">The '''marginal revenue productivity theory of wages''' is a theory in [[neoclassical economics]] stating that [[wage]]s are paid at a level equal to the '''marginal revenue product''' of [[Labour (economics)|labor]], MRP (the value of the [[marginal product]] of labor), which is the increment to revenues caused by the increment to output produced by the last laborer employed.  In a model, this is justified by an assumption that the firm is profit-maximizing and thus would employ labor only up to the point that marginal labor costs equal the marginal revenue generated for the firm.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel S. Hamermesh. 1986. The demand for labor in the long run. ''Handbook of Labor Economics'' (Orley Ashenfelter and Richard Layard, ed.) p. 429.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The marginal revenue product (MRP) of a worker is equal to the product of the marginal product of labour (MP) (the increment to output from an increment to labor used) and the marginal revenue (MR) (the increment to sales revenue from an increment to output): MRP = MP × MR. The theory states that workers will be hired up to the point when the marginal revenue product is equal to the wage rate. If the marginal revenue brought by the worker is less than the wage rate, then employing that laborer would cause a decrease in profit.

The idea that payments to factors of production equal their marginal productivity had been laid out by [[John Bates Clark]] and [[Knut Wicksell]], in simpler models. Much of the MRP theory stems from Wicksell's model.

==Mathematical relation==

The marginal revenue product of labour MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is the increase in revenue per unit increase in the variable input =  ∆TR/∆L 

:MR = ∆TR/∆Q

:MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = ∆Q/∆L

:MR x MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = (∆TR/∆Q) x (∆Q/∆L) = ∆TR/∆L

The change in output is not limited to that directly attributable to the additional worker. Assuming that the firm is operating with diminishing marginal returns then the addition of an extra worker reduces the average productivity of every other worker (and every other worker affects the marginal productivity of the additional worker).

As above noted the firm will continue to add units of labor until the MRP equals the wage rate ''w''&amp;mdash;mathematically until

:MRP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = ''w''

:MR(MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''w''

:MR = w/MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;

:MR = MC which is the profit maximizing rule.

==Marginal revenue product in a perfectly competitive market==

Under [[perfect competition]], marginal revenue product is equal to marginal physical product (extra unit produced as a result of a new employment) multiplied by price.

:&lt;math&gt;MRP = MPP \times \text{MR(=AR=D) as perfectly competitive labour market}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;MRP = MPP \times \text{Price}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:
This is because the firm in [[perfect competition]] is a [[price taker]]. It does not have to lower the price in order to sell additional units of the good.

==MRP in monopoly or imperfect competition==

Firms operating as monopolies or in imperfect competition face downward-sloping [[demand curve]]s. To sell extra units of output, they would have to lower their output's price. Under such market conditions, marginal revenue product will not equal MPP×Price. This is because the firm is not able to sell output at a fixed price per unit. Thus the MRP curve of a firm in [[monopoly]] or in [[imperfect competition]] will slope downwards, when plotted against labor usage, at a faster rate than in perfect specific competition.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3856">A '''marginal value''' is
#a [[Value (mathematics)|value]] that holds true given particular constraints,
#the ''change'' in a value associated with a specific change in some [[Dependent and independent variables|independent variable]], whether it be of that variable or of a [[Dependent and independent variables|dependent variable]], or
#[when underlying values are quantified] the ''[[ratio]]'' of the change of a dependent variable to that of the independent variable.
(This third case is actually a special case of the second).

In the case of [[Differentiability#Continuity and differentiability|differentiability]], at the limit, a marginal change is a [[Differential (infinitesimal)|mathematical differential]], or the corresponding [[Derivative (calculus)|mathematical derivative]].

These uses of the term “marginal” are especially common in [[economics]], and result from conceptualizing constraints as ''borders'' or as ''margins''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Wicksteed|Wicksteed, Philip Henry]]; ''The Common Sense of Political Economy'' (1910),] Bk I Ch 2 and elsewhere.&lt;/ref&gt;  The sorts of marginal values most common to economic analysis are those associated with ''unit'' changes of resources and, in [[mainstream economics]], those associated with ''infinitesimal'' changes.  Marginal values associated with units are considered because many decisions are made by unit, and [[marginalism]] explains ''unit price'' in terms of such marginal values.  Mainstream economics uses infinitesimal values in much of its analysis for reasons of mathematical tractability.

== Quantified conception ==

Assume a functional relationship
:&lt;math&gt;y=f\left(x_1 ,x_2 ,\ldots,x_n \right)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Discrete change ===
If the value of &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; is ''discretely'' changed from &lt;math&gt;x_{i,0}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;x_{i,1}&lt;/math&gt; while other independent variables remain unchanged, then the marginal value of the change in &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta x_i =x_{i,1}-x_{i,0}&lt;/math&gt;
and the “marginal value” of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; may refer to
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta y=f\left(x_1 ,x_2 ,\ldots ,x_{i,1},\ldots,x_n \right)-f\left(x_1 ,x_2 ,\ldots ,x_{i,0},\ldots,x_n \right)&lt;/math&gt;
or to
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{f\left(x_1 ,x_2 ,\ldots ,x_{i,1},\ldots,x_n \right)-f\left(x_1 ,x_2 ,\ldots ,x_{i,0},\ldots,x_n \right)}{x_{i,1}-x_{i,0}}&lt;/math&gt;

==== Example ====
If an individual saw her income increase from $50000 to $55000 per annum, and part of her response was to increase yearly purchases of [[amontillado]] from 2 casks to three casks, then
*the marginal increase in her income was $5000
*the marginal effect on her purchase of amontillado was an increase of 1 cask, or of 1 cask per $5000.

=== Infinitesimal margins ===
If ''infinitesimal'' values are considered, then a marginal value of &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; would be &lt;math&gt;dx_i&lt;/math&gt;, and the “marginal value” of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; would typically refer to
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial y}{\partial x_i}=\frac{\partial f\left(x_1 ,x_2 ,\ldots,x_n \right)}{\partial x_i}&lt;/math&gt;

(For a linear functional relationship &lt;math&gt;y = a + b\cdot x&lt;/math&gt;, the marginal value of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; will simply be the co-efficient of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; (in this case, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;) and this will not change as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; changes. However, in the case where the functional relationship is non-linear, say &lt;math&gt;y = a\cdot b^x&lt;/math&gt;, the marginal value of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; will be different for different values of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.)

==== Example ====
Assume that, in some economy, aggregate consumption is well-approximated by
:&lt;math&gt;C=C\left(Y\right)&lt;/math&gt;
where
*&lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is [[Measures of national income and output|aggregate income]].
Then the ''[[marginal propensity to consume]]'' is
:&lt;math&gt;MPC=\frac{dC}{dY}&lt;/math&gt;

A metamodel or surrogate model is a model of a model, and metamodeling is the process of generating such metamodels. Thus '''metamodeling''' or '''meta-modeling''' is the analysis, construction and development of the frames, rules, constraints, models and theories applicable and useful for [[Scientific modelling|modeling]] a predefined class of problems. As its name implies, this concept applies the notions of [[meta-]] and modeling in [[software engineering]] and [[systems engineering]]. Metamodels are of many types and have diverse applications.&lt;ref&gt; [[Saraju Mohanty]], Chapter 12 Metamodel-Based Fast AMS-SoC Design Methodologies, "[http://www.mhprofessional.com/product.php?isbn=0071825711 Nanoelectronic Mixed-Signal System Design]", {{ISBN|978-0071825719}} and 0071825711, 1st Edition, McGraw-Hill, 2015. &lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
A metamodel or surrogate model is a model of the model, i.e. a simplified model of an actual model of a circuit, system, or software like entity.&lt;ref&gt; Oleg Garitselov, [[Saraju Mohanty]], and Elias Kougianos, "[http://www.cse.unt.edu/~smohanty/Publications_Journals/2012/Mohanty_IEEE-TSM-2012Feb.pdf A Comparative Study of Metamodels for Fast and Accurate Simulation of Nano-CMOS Circuits] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923211500/http://www.cse.unt.edu/~smohanty/Publications_Journals/2012/Mohanty_IEEE-TSM-2012Feb.pdf |date=23 September 2015 }}", IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), Vol. 25, No. 1, February 2012, pp. 26–36. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [[Saraju Mohanty]] [http://www.cse.unt.edu/~smohanty/Presentations/2012/Mohanty_SRC-TxACE_Talk_2012-04-27.pdf Ultra-Fast Design Exploration of Nanoscale Circuits through Metamodeling] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923211443/http://www.cse.unt.edu/~smohanty/Presentations/2012/Mohanty_SRC-TxACE_Talk_2012-04-27.pdf |date=23 September 2015 }}, Invited Talk, Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC), Texas Analog Center for Excellence (TxACE), 27 April 2012. &lt;/ref&gt; Metamodel can be a mathematical relation or algorithm representing input and output relations. A [[model (abstract)|model]] is an abstraction of phenomena in the [[Real life (reality)|real world]];  a metamodel is yet another abstraction, highlighting properties of the model itself.  A model conforms to its metamodel in the way that a computer program conforms to the grammar of the programming language in which it is written. Various types of metamodels include polynomial equations, neural network, [[Kriging]], etc. "Metamodeling" is the construction of a collection of "concepts" (things, terms, etc.) within a certain domain. Metamodeling typically involves studying the output and input relationships and then fitting right metamodels to represent that behavior.  

Common uses for metamodels are:
* As a [[logical schema|schema]] for [[semantic]] data that needs to be exchanged or stored
* As a language that supports a particular method or process
* As a language to express additional semantics of existing information
* As a mechanism to create tools that work with a broad class of models at run time
* As a schema for modeling and automatically exploring sentences of a language with applications to automated test synthesis
* As an approximation of a higher-fidelity model for use when reducing computational cost is necessary

Because of the "meta" character of metamodeling, both the [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] and theory of metamodels are of relevance to [[wikt:metascience|metascience]], [[metaphilosophy]], [[metatheory|metatheories]] and [[systemics]], and meta-consciousness.  The concept can be useful in [[mathematics]], and has practical applications in [[computer science]] and [[computer engineering]]/[[software engineering]]. The latter are the main focus of this article.

=== Definition ===
In [[software engineering]], the use of [[model (abstract)|model]]s is an alternative to more common code-based development techniques. A model always conforms to a unique metamodel. One of the currently most active branch of [[Model Driven Engineering]] is the approach named [[model-driven architecture]] proposed by [[Object Management Group|OMG]]. This approach is based on the utilization of a language to write metamodels called the [[Meta-Object Facility|Meta Object Facility or MOF]]. Typical metamodels proposed by [[Object Management Group|OMG]] are [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]], [[SysML]], SPEM or CWM. [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] has also published the standard metamodel [[ISO/IEC 24744]].&lt;ref&gt;International Organization for Standardization / International Electrotechnical Commission, 2007. [http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=38854 ISO/IEC 24744]. Software Engineering - Metamodel for Development Methodologies.&lt;/ref&gt; All the languages presented below could be defined as MOF metamodels.

=== Metadata modeling ===
[[Metadata modeling]] is a type of metamodeling used in [[software engineering]] and [[systems engineering]] for the analysis and construction of models applicable and useful to some predefined class of problems. (see also: [[data modeling]]).

=== Model transformations ===
One important move in [[Model Driven Engineering]] is the systematic use of [[Model Transformation Language]]s. The OMG has proposed a standard for this called [[QVT]] for Queries/Views/Transformations. [[QVT]] is based on the [[Meta-Object Facility]] or MOF. Among many other [[Model Transformation Language]]s (MTLs), some examples of implementations of this standard are AndroMDA, [[VIATRA]], [[Tefkat]], [[MT (Model Transformation Language)|MT]], [[ManyDesigns Portofino]].

=== Relationship to ontologies ===
Meta-models are closely related to [[Ontology (computer science)|ontologies]]. Both are often used to describe and analyze the relations between concepts&lt;ref&gt;E. Söderström, et al. (2001) "Towards a Framework for Comparing Process Modelling Languages", in: ''Lecture Notes In Computer Science''; Vol. 2348. Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering. Pages: 600 – 611, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ontologies: express something meaningful within a specified universe or [[domain of discourse]] by utilizing a grammar for using vocabulary. The grammar specifies what it means to be a well-formed statement, assertion, query, etc. (formal constraints) on how terms in the ontology’s controlled vocabulary can be used together.&lt;ref name=PidcockArticle&gt;

* Meta-modeling: can be considered as an ''explicit'' description (constructs and rules) of how a domain-specific model is built. In particular, this comprises a formalized specification of the domain-specific notations. Typically, metamodels are – and always should follow - a strict rule set.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Types of metamodels ===
For software engineering, several ''types'' of models (and their corresponding modeling activities) can be distinguished:
*[[Metadata modeling]] (MetaData Model)
*[[Meta-Process Modeling]] (MetaProcess Model)
*Executable Meta-Modeling (combining both of the above and much more, as in the general purpose tool [[Kermeta]])
*[[Model Transformation Language]] (see below)

*[[Neural network]] Metamodels
*[[Kriging]] Metamodels
*[[Piecewise Polynomial (Spline) Metamodels]]
*[[Gradient-Enhanced Kriging (GEK)]]

=== Zoos of metamodels ===
A library of similar metamodels has been called a Zoo of metamodels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metamodel.com/wisme-2004/present/22.pdf Jean-Marie Favre: Towards a Basic Theory to Model Driven Engineering.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061015181841/http://www.metamodel.com/wisme-2004/present/22.pdf |date=15 October 2006 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
There are several types of meta-model zoos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eclipse.org/gmt/am3/zoos/ AtlanticZoo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060429205711/http://www.eclipse.org/gmt/am3/zoos/ |date=29 April 2006 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some are expressed in ECore. Others are written in [[Meta-Object Facility|MOF]] 1.4 - [[XML Metadata Interchange|XMI]] 1.2. The metamodels expressed in [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]]-[[XML Metadata Interchange|XMI]]1.2 may be uploaded in [[Poseidon for UML]], a [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] [[computer-aided software engineering|CASE]] tool.

{{Distinguish|Monad (disambiguation){{!}}Monad}}

In [[abstract algebra]], a branch of [[mathematics]], a '''monoid''' is an [[algebraic structure]] with a single [[associative]] [[binary operation]] and an [[identity element]].

Monoids are studied in [[semigroup]] theory, because they are semigroups with identity. Monoids occur in several branches of mathematics; for instance, they can be regarded as [[category (mathematics)|categories]] with a single [[object (category theory)|object]]. Thus, they capture the idea of [[function composition]] within a set. In fact, all functions from a set into itself form naturally a monoid with respect to function composition. Monoids are also commonly used in [[computer science]], both in its foundational aspects and in practical programming. The set of [[string (computer science)|strings]] built from a given set of [[Character (computing)|characters]] is a [[free monoid]]. The [[transition monoid]] and [[syntactic monoid]] are used in describing [[finite-state machine]]s, whereas [[trace monoid]]s and [[history monoid]]s provide a foundation for [[process calculi]] and [[concurrent computing]]. Some of the more important results in the study of monoids are the [[Krohn–Rhodes theorem]] and the [[star height problem]]. The history of monoids, as well as a discussion of additional general properties, are found in the article on [[semigroup]]s.

{{Algebraic structures |group}}

== Definition ==

Suppose that ''S'' is a [[set (mathematics)|set]] and • is some [[binary operation]] {{nowrap|1=''S'' × ''S'' → ''S''}}, then ''S'' with • is a '''monoid''' if it satisfies the following two axioms:

; Associativity: For all ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' in ''S'', the equation {{nowrap|1=(''a'' • ''b'') • ''c'' = ''a'' • (''b'' • ''c'')}} holds.
; Identity element: There exists an element ''e'' in ''S'' such that for every element ''a'' in ''S'', the equations {{nowrap|1=''e'' • ''a'' = ''a'' • ''e'' = ''a''}} hold.

In other words, a monoid is a [[semigroup]] with an [[identity element]]. It can also be thought of as a [[magma (algebra)|magma]] with associativity and identity. The identity element of a monoid is unique.&lt;ref&gt;If both ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; satisfy the above equations, then ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; • ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  For this reason the identity is regarded as a [[Constant (mathematics)|constant]], i. e. 0-ary (or nullary) operation. The monoid therefore is characterized by specification of the [[Tuple|triple]] (''S'', • , ''e'').

Depending on the context, the symbol for the binary operation may be omitted, so that the operation is denoted by juxtaposition; for example, the monoid axioms may be written &lt;math&gt;(ab)c = a(bc)&lt;/math&gt; and {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;ea=ae=a&lt;/math&gt;.}} This notation does not imply that it is numbers being multiplied.

A monoid in which each element has an [[inverse element|inverse]] is a [[group (mathematics)|group]].

== Monoid structures ==

===Submonoids===
A '''submonoid''' of a monoid {{nowrap|(''M'', •)}} is a [[subset]] ''N'' of ''M'' that is closed under the monoid operation and contains the identity element ''e'' of ''M''.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Some authors omit the requirement that a submonoid must contain the identity element from its definition, requiring only that it have ''an'' identity element, which can be distinct from that of ''M''.&lt;/ref&gt; Symbolically, ''N'' is a submonoid of ''M'' if {{nowrap|''N'' ⊆ ''M''}}, {{nowrap|''x'' • ''y'' ∈ ''N''}} whenever {{nowrap|''x'', ''y'' ∈ ''N''}}, and {{nowrap|''e'' ∈ ''N''}}. ''N'' is thus a monoid under the binary operation inherited from ''M''.

===Generators===
A subset ''S'' of ''M'' is said to be a '''generator''' of ''M'' if ''M'' is the smallest set containing ''S'' that is [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under the monoid operation, or equivalently ''M'' is the result of applying the [[finitary closure operator]] to ''S''. If there is a generator of ''M'' that has finite cardinality, then ''M'' is said to be '''finitely generated'''. Not every set ''S'' will generate a monoid, as the generated structure may lack an identity element.

===Commutative monoid===
A monoid whose operation is [[commutative]] is called a '''commutative monoid''' (or, less commonly, an '''abelian monoid'''). Commutative monoids are often written additively. Any commutative monoid is endowed with its '''algebraic''' [[preorder]]ing ≤, defined by {{nowrap|''x'' ≤ ''y''}} if there exists ''z'' such that {{nowrap|1=''x'' + ''z'' = ''y''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Michel | last1=Gondran| first2=Michel | last2=Minoux | title=Graphs, Dioids and Semirings: New Models and Algorithms | year=2008 | location=Dordrecht | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] |isbn=978-0-387-75450-5 | zbl=1201.16038 | series=Operations Research/Computer Science Interfaces Series | volume=41 | page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An '''order-unit''' of a commutative monoid ''M'' is an element ''u'' of ''M'' such that for any element ''x'' of ''M'', there exists a positive integer ''n'' such that {{nowrap|''x'' ≤ ''nu''}}. This is often used in case ''M'' is the [[Ordered group|positive cone]] of a [[Partially ordered set|partially ordered]] [[abelian group]] ''G'', in which case we say that ''u'' is an order-unit of ''G''.

===Partially commutative monoid===
A monoid for which the operation is commutative for some, but not all elements is a [[trace monoid]]; trace monoids commonly occur in the theory of [[concurrent computation]].

== Examples ==
* Out of the 16 possible [[truth table#Truth table for all binary logical operators|binary Boolean operator]]s, each of the four that has a two sided identity is also commutative and associative and thus makes the set {False, True} a commutative monoid. Under the standard definitions, [[Logical conjunction|AND]] and [[Logical biconditional|XNOR]] have the identity True while [[Exclusive disjunction|XOR]] and [[Logical disjunction|OR]] have the identity False. The monoids from AND and OR are also [[idempotent]] while those from XOR and XNOR are not.
* The [[natural number]]s, '''N''', form a commutative monoid under addition (identity element [[0 (number)|zero]]), or multiplication (identity element [[1 (number)|one]]). A submonoid of '''N''' under addition is called a [[numerical monoid]].
* The [[positive integer]]s, {{nowrap|'''N''' ∖ {0}&lt;nowiki/&gt;}}, form a commutative monoid under multiplication (identity element one).
* Given a set A, all subsets of A form a commutative monoid under intersection operation (identity element is A itself).
* Given a set A, all subsets of A form a commutative monoid under union operation (identity element is the empty set).
* Generalizing the previous example, every bounded [[semilattice]] is an [[idempotent]] commutative monoid.
** In particular, any bounded [[lattice (order)|lattice]] can be endowed with both a [[Join and meet|meet]]- and a [[Join and meet|join]]- monoid structure. The identity elements are the lattice's top and its bottom, respectively. Being lattices, [[Heyting algebra]]s and [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]s are endowed with these monoid structures.
* Every [[singleton set]] {''x''} closed under a binary operation • forms the trivial (one-element) monoid, which is also the [[trivial group]].
* Every [[group (mathematics)|group]] is a monoid and every [[abelian group]] a commutative monoid.
* Any [[semigroup]] ''S'' may be turned into a monoid simply by adjoining an element ''e'' not in ''S'' and defining {{nowrap|1=''e'' • ''s'' = ''s'' = ''s'' • ''e''}} for all {{nowrap|''s'' ∈ ''S''}}. This conversion of any semigroup to the monoid is done by the [[free functor]] between the [[category of semigroups]] and the [[category of monoids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The ''q''-theory of Finite Semigroups: A New Approach|volume=71|series=Springer Monographs in Mathematics|first1=John|last1=Rhodes|first2=Benjamin|last2=Steinberg|publisher=Springer|year=2009|isbn=9780387097817|page=22|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8L0QIEj0PI4C&amp;pg=PA22}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
** Thus, an idempotent monoid (sometimes known as ''find-first'') may be formed by adjoining an identity element ''e'' to the [[left zero semigroup]] over a set ''S''. The opposite monoid (sometimes called ''find-last'') is formed from the [[right zero semigroup]] over ''S''.
*** Adjoin an identity ''e'' to the left-zero semigroup with two elements {''lt''; ''gt''}. Then the resulting idempotent monoid {{nowrap|{''lt''; ''e''; ''gt''}&lt;nowiki/&gt;}} models the [[lexicographical order]] of a sequence given the orders of its elements, with ''e'' representing equality.
* The elements of any [[unital algebra|unital]] [[ring (algebra)|ring]], with addition or multiplication as the operation.
** The [[integer]]s, [[rational number]]s, [[real number]]s or [[complex number]]s, with addition or multiplication as operation.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson (2009), p. 29, examples 1, 2, 4 &amp; 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
** The set of all ''n'' by ''n'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] over a given ring, with [[matrix addition]] or [[matrix multiplication]] as the operation.
* The set of all finite [[string (computer science)|strings]] over some fixed alphabet Σ forms a monoid with [[string concatenation]] as the operation. The [[empty string]] serves as the identity element. This monoid is denoted Σ&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; and is called the '''[[free monoid]]''' over Σ.
* Given any monoid ''M'', the ''opposite monoid'' M&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt; has the same carrier set and identity element as ''M'', and its operation is defined by ''x'' •&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt; {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''y'' • ''x''}}. Any [[commutative monoid]] is the opposite monoid of itself.
* Given two sets ''M'' and ''N'' endowed with monoid structure (or, in general, any finite number of monoids, ''M''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''M&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''), their [[cartesian product]] {{nowrap|''M'' × ''N''}} is also a monoid (respectively, {{nowrap|''M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' × ... × ''M&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}}). The associative operation and the identity element are defined pairwise.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson (2009), p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fix a monoid ''M''. The set of all functions from a given set to ''M'' is also a monoid. The identity element is a [[constant function]] mapping any value to the identity of ''M''; the associative operation is defined [[pointwise]].
* Fix a monoid ''M'' with the operation • and identity element ''e'', and consider its [[power set]] ''P''(''M'') consisting of all [[subset]]s of ''M''. A binary operation for such subsets can be defined by {{nowrap|1=''S'' • ''T'' = { ''s'' • ''t'' : ''s'' ∈ ''S'', ''t'' ∈ ''T'' }&lt;nowiki/&gt;}}. This turns ''P''(''M'') into a monoid with identity element {''e''}. In the same way the power set of a group ''G'' is a monoid under the [[product of group subsets]].
* Let ''S'' be a set. The set of all functions {{nowrap|''S'' → ''S''}} forms a monoid under [[function composition]]. The identity is just the [[identity function]]. It is also called the '''[[full transformation monoid]]''' of ''S''. If ''S'' is finite with ''n'' elements, the monoid of functions on ''S'' is finite with ''n''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; elements.
* Generalizing the previous example, let ''C'' be a [[category (mathematics)|category]] and ''X'' an object in ''C''. The set of all [[endomorphism]]s of ''X'', denoted End&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''), forms a monoid under composition of [[morphism]]s. For more on the relationship between category theory and monoids see below.
* The set of [[homeomorphism]] [[Class (set theory)|classes]] of [[compact surface]]s with the [[connected sum]]. Its unit element is the class of the ordinary 2-sphere. Furthermore, if ''a'' denotes the class of the [[torus]], and ''b'' denotes the class of the projective plane, then every element ''c'' of the monoid has a unique expression the form {{nowrap|1=''c'' = ''na'' + ''mb''}} where ''n'' is the integer ≥ 0 and ''m'' = 0, 1, or 2. We have {{nowrap|1=3''b'' = ''a'' + ''b''}}.
* Let &lt;math&gt;\langle f\rangle&lt;/math&gt; be a cyclic monoid of order ''n'', that is, &lt;math&gt;\langle f\rangle = \{f^0,f^1,\dots,f^{n-1}\}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;f^n = f^k&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;0 \le k &lt; n&lt;/math&gt;. In fact, each such ''k'' gives a distinct monoid of order ''n'', and every cyclic monoid is isomorphic to one of these.

Moreover, ''f'' can be considered as a function on the points &lt;math&gt;\{0,1,2,\dots,n-1\}&lt;/math&gt; given by

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; \dots &amp; n-2 &amp; n-1 \\
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; \dots &amp; n-1 &amp; k\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

or, equivalently

: &lt;math&gt;f(i) := \begin{cases} i+1, &amp; \mbox{if }  0 \le i &lt; n-1  \\ k,  &amp; \mbox{if } i = n-1. \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

Multiplication of elements in &lt;math&gt;\langle f\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is then given by function composition.

Note also that when &lt;math&gt;k = 0&lt;/math&gt; then the function ''f'' is a permutation of &lt;math&gt;\{0,1,2,\dots,n-1\}&lt;/math&gt;
and gives the unique [[cyclic group]] of order ''n''.

== Properties ==
In a monoid, one can define positive integer powers of an element ''x'' : ''x''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x'', and ''x''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x'' • ... • ''x'' (''n'' times) for ''n'' &gt; 1 . The rule of powers ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n'' + ''p''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; • ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; is obvious.

From the definition of a monoid, one can show that the identity element ''e'' is unique. Then, for any ''x'', one can set ''x''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = ''e'' and the rule of powers is still true with nonnegative exponents.

It is possible to define [[inverse element|invertible elements]]: an element ''x'' is called invertible if there exists an element ''y'' such that {{nowrap|1=''x'' • ''y'' = ''e''}} and {{nowrap|1=''y'' • ''x'' = ''e''}}. The element ''y'' is called the inverse of ''x''. If ''y'' and ''z'' are inverses of ''x'', then by associativity {{nowrap|1=''y'' = (''zx'')''y'' = ''z''(''xy'') = ''z''}}. Thus inverses, if they exist, are unique.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, I.5. p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

If ''y'' is the inverse of ''x'', one can define negative powers of ''x'' by setting {{nowrap|1=''x''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; = ''y''}} and  {{nowrap|1=''x''&lt;sup&gt;−''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''y'' • ... • ''y''}} (''n'' times) for {{nowrap|''n'' &gt; 1}}. And the rule of exponents is still verified for all integers ''n'', ''p''. This is why the inverse of ''x'' is usually written ''x''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. The set of all invertible elements in a monoid ''M'', together with the operation •, forms a [[group (mathematics)|group]]. In that sense, every monoid contains a group (possibly only the [[trivial group]] consisting of only the identity).

However, not every monoid sits inside a group. For instance, it is perfectly possible to have a monoid in which two elements ''a'' and ''b'' exist such that {{nowrap|1=''a'' • ''b'' = ''a''}} holds even though ''b'' is not the identity element. Such a monoid cannot be embedded in a group, because in the group we could multiply both sides with the inverse of ''a'' and would get that {{nowrap|1=''b'' = ''e''}}, which isn't true. A monoid {{nowrap|(''M'', •)}} has the [[cancellation property]] (or is [[cancellative]]) if for all ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' in ''M'', {{nowrap|1=''a'' • ''b'' = ''a'' • ''c''}} always implies {{nowrap|1=''b'' = ''c''}} and {{nowrap|1=''b'' • ''a'' = ''c'' • ''a''}} always implies {{nowrap|1=''b'' = ''c''}}. A commutative monoid with the cancellation property can always be embedded in a group via the [[Grothendieck group|Grothendieck construction]]. That is how the additive group of the integers (a group with operation +) is constructed from the additive monoid of natural numbers (a commutative monoid with operation + and cancellation property). However, a non-commutative cancellative monoid need not be embeddable in a group.

If a monoid has the cancellation property and is ''finite'', then it is in fact a group. Proof: Fix an element ''x'' in the monoid. Since the monoid is finite, {{nowrap|1=''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;}} for some {{nowrap|''m'' &gt; ''n'' &gt; 0}}. But then, by cancellation we have that {{nowrap|1=''x''&lt;sup&gt;''m'' − ''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''e''}} where ''e'' is the identity. Therefore, {{nowrap|1=''x'' • ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''m'' − ''n'' − 1&lt;/sup&gt; = ''e''}}, so ''x'' has an inverse.

The right- and left-cancellative elements of a monoid each in turn form a submonoid (i.e. obviously include the identity and not so obviously are closed under the operation). This means that the cancellative elements of any commutative monoid can be extended to a group.

It turns out that requiring the cancellative property in a monoid is not required to perform the Grothendieck construction – commutativity is sufficient. However, if the original monoid has an [[absorbing element]] then its Grothendieck group is the trivial group. Hence the homomorphism is, in general, not injective.

An '''inverse monoid''' is a monoid where for every ''a'' in ''M'', there exists a unique ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; in ''M'' such that {{nowrap|1=''a'' = ''a'' • ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; • ''a''}} and {{nowrap|1=''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; • ''a'' • ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}. If an inverse monoid is cancellative, then it is a group.

In the opposite direction, a '''[[zerosumfree monoid]]''' is an additively written monoid in which {{nowrap|1=''a'' + ''b'' = 0}} implies that {{nowrap|1=''a'' = 0}} and {{nowrap|1=''b'' = 0}}:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Tensor products of structures with interpolation| first=Friedrich | last=Wehrung|journal=Pacific Journal of Mathematics|volume=176|issue=1|year=1996|pages=267–285 | zbl=0865.06010 | url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.pjm/1102352063 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; equivalently, that no element other than zero has an additive inverse.

==Acts and operator monoids==
{{main|monoid act}}
Let ''M'' be a monoid, with the binary operation denoted by • and the identity element denoted by ''e''. Then a (left) '''''M''-act''' (or left act over ''M'') is a set ''X'' together with an operation {{nowrap|⋅ : ''M'' × ''X'' → ''X''}} which is compatible with the monoid structure as follows:
* for all ''x'' in ''X'': {{nowrap|1=''e'' ⋅ ''x'' = ''x''}};
* for all ''a'', ''b'' in ''M'' and ''x'' in ''X'': {{nowrap|1=''a'' ⋅ (''b'' ⋅ ''x'') = (''a'' • ''b'') ⋅ ''x''}}.
This is the analogue in monoid theory of a (left) [[group action]]. Right ''M''-acts are defined in a similar way. A monoid with an act is also known as an '''[[operator monoid]]'''. Important examples include [[transition system]]s of [[semiautomata]]. A [[transformation semigroup]] can be made into an operator monoid by adjoining the identity transformation.

== Monoid homomorphisms ==
[[File:Exponentiation as monoid homomorphism svg.svg|thumb|x150px|Example monoid homomorphism {{nowrap|''x'' ↦ 2&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;}} from {{nowrap|{{color|#004000|('''N''', +, 0)}}}} to {{nowrap|{{color|#400000|('''N''', ×, 1)}}}}. It is injective, but not surjective.]]
A [[homomorphism]] between two monoids {{nowrap|(''M'', ∗)}} and {{nowrap|(''N'', •)}} is a function {{nowrap|''f'' : ''M'' → ''N''}} such that
* ''f''(''x'' ∗ ''y'') = ''f''(''x'') • ''f''(''y'') for all ''x'', ''y'' in ''M''
* ''f''(''e''&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;,
where ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; are the identities on ''M'' and ''N'' respectively. Monoid homomorphisms are sometimes simply called '''monoid morphisms'''.

Not every [[semigroup homomorphism]] is a monoid homomorphism, since it may not map the identity to the identity of the target monoid, even though the element it maps the identity to will be an identity of the image of the mapping. In contrast, a semigroup homomorphism between groups is always a [[group homomorphism]], as it necessarily preserves the identity. Since for monoids this isn't always true, it is necessary to state this as a separate requirement.

A [[bijective]] monoid homomorphism is called a monoid [[isomorphism]]. Two monoids are said to be isomorphic if there is a monoid isomorphism between them.

==Equational presentation==
{{main|Presentation of a monoid}}

Monoids may be given a '''presentation''', much in the same way that groups can be specified by means of a [[group presentation]]. One does this by specifying a set of generators Σ, and a set of relations on the [[free monoid]] Σ&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;. One does this by extending (finite) [[binary relation]]s on Σ&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; to monoid congruences, and then constructing the quotient monoid, as above.

Given a binary relation {{nowrap|''R'' ⊂ Σ&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; × Σ&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}}, one defines its symmetric closure as {{nowrap|''R'' ∪ ''R''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}. This can be extended to a symmetric relation {{nowrap|''E'' ⊂ Σ&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; × Σ&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}} by defining {{nowrap|''x'' ~&lt;sub&gt;''E''&lt;/sub&gt; ''y''}} if and only if {{nowrap|1=''x'' = ''sut''}} and {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''svt''}} for some strings {{nowrap|''u'', ''v'', ''s'', ''t'' ∈ Σ&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}} with {{nowrap|(''u'',''v'') ∈ ''R'' ∪ ''R''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Finally, one takes the reflexive and transitive closure of ''E'', which is then a monoid congruence.

In the typical situation, the relation ''R'' is simply given as a set of equations, so that &lt;math&gt;R=\{u_1=v_1,\cdots,u_n=v_n\}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, for example,
: &lt;math&gt;\langle p,q\,\vert\; pq=1\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
is the equational presentation for the [[bicyclic monoid]], and

: &lt;math&gt;\langle a,b \,\vert\; aba=baa, bba=bab\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
is the [[plactic monoid]] of degree 2 (it has infinite order). Elements of this plactic monoid may be written as &lt;math&gt;a^ib^j(ba)^k&lt;/math&gt; for integers ''i'', ''j'', ''k'', as the relations show that ''ba'' commutes with both ''a'' and ''b''.

== Relation to category theory ==
{{Group-like structures}}
Monoids can be viewed as a special class of [[category theory|categories]]. Indeed, the axioms required of a monoid operation are exactly those required of [[morphism]] composition when restricted to the set of all morphisms whose source and target is a given object.&lt;ref name=Awo10&gt;{{cite book | zbl=1100.18001 | title=Category Theory | volume=49 | series=Oxford Logic Guides | first=Steve | last=Awodey | authorlink=Steve Awodey | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | year=2006 | isbn=0-19-856861-4 | page=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That is,
: ''A monoid is, essentially, the same thing as a category with a single object.''
More precisely, given a monoid {{nowrap|(''M'', •)}}, one can construct a small category with only one object and whose morphisms are the elements of ''M''. The composition of morphisms is given by the monoid operation •.

Likewise, monoid homomorphisms are just [[functor]]s between single object categories.&lt;ref name=Awo10/&gt;  So this construction gives an [[equivalence of categories|equivalence]] between the [[category of monoids|category of (small) monoids]] '''Mon''' and a full subcategory of the category of (small) categories '''Cat'''. Similarly, the [[category of groups]] is equivalent to another full subcategory of '''Cat'''.

In this sense, category theory can be thought of as an extension of the concept of a monoid. Many definitions and theorems about monoids can be generalised to small categories with more than one object. For example, a quotient of a category with one object is just a quotient monoid.

Monoids, just like other algebraic structures, also form their own category, '''Mon''', whose objects are monoids and whose morphisms are monoid homomorphisms.&lt;ref name=Awo10/&gt;

There is also a notion of [[monoid (category theory)|monoid object]] which is an abstract definition of what is a monoid in a category. A monoid object in '''[[category of sets|Set]]''' is just a monoid.

== Monoids in computer science ==
In computer science, many [[abstract data types]] can be endowed with a monoid structure. In a common pattern, a [[sequence]] of elements of a monoid is "[[fold (higher-order function)|folded]]" or "accumulated" to produce a final value. For instance, many iterative algorithms need to update some kind of "running total" at each iteration; this pattern may be elegantly expressed by a monoid operation. Alternatively, the associativity of monoid operations ensures that the operation can be [[parallelization|parallelized]] by employing a [[prefix sum]] or similar algorithm, in order to utilize multiple cores or processors efficiently.

Given a sequence of values of type ''M'' with identity element &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; and associative operation &lt;math&gt;\bullet&lt;/math&gt;, the ''fold'' operation is defined as follows:
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{fold}: M^{*} \rarr M = l \mapsto \begin{cases} \varepsilon &amp; \mbox{if } l = \mathrm{nil} \\ m \bullet \mathrm{fold} \, l' &amp; \mbox{if } l = \mathrm{cons} \, m \, l' \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

In addition, any [[data structure]] can be 'folded' in a similar way, given a serialization of its elements. For instance, the result of "folding" a [[binary tree]] might differ depending on pre-order vs. post-order [[tree traversal]].

== MapReduce ==
An application of monoids in computer science is so-called [[MapReduce]] programming model (see [https://erikerlandson.github.io/blog/2016/09/05/expressing-map-reduce-as-a-left-folding-monoid/ Encoding Map-Reduce As A Monoid With Left Folding]). MapReduce, in computing, consists of two or three operations. Given a dataset, "Map" consists of mapping arbitrary data to elements of a specific monoid. "Reduce" consists of folding those elements, so that in the end we produce just one element.

For example, if we have a [[multiset]], in a program it is represented as a map from elements to their numbers. Elements are called keys in this case. The number of distinct keys may be too big, and in this case the [[multiset]] is being sharded. To finalize reduction properly, the "Shuffling" stage regroups the data among the nodes. If we do not need this step, the whole Map/Reduce consists of mapping and reducing; both operation are parallelizable, the former due to its element-wise nature, the latter due to associativity of the monoid.

==Complete monoids==
A '''complete monoid''' is a commutative monoid equipped with an [[infinitary sum]] operation &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_I&lt;/math&gt; for any [[index set]] ''I'' such that:&lt;ref name="droste"&gt;Droste, M., &amp; Kuich, W.

and

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{j \in J}{\sum_{i \in I_j}{m_i}} = \sum_{i \in I}(m_i)\;  \textrm{if} \bigcup_{j\in J} I_j=I\; \textrm{and}\; I_j \cap I_{j'} = \emptyset\; \textrm{for}\; j\neq j'&lt;/math&gt;

A '''continuous monoid''' is an ordered commutative monoid in which every [[directed set]] has a [[least upper bound]] compatible with the monoid operation:

&lt;math&gt;a + \sup S = \sup(a + S) \ . &lt;/math&gt;

These two concepts are closely related: a continuous monoid is a complete monoid in which the infinitary sum may be defined as

: &lt;math&gt; \sum_I a_i = \sup \sum_E a_i &lt;/math&gt;

where the supremum on the right runs over all finite subsets ''E'' of ''I'' and each sum on the right is a finite sum in the monoid.&lt;ref name=Kuich11/&gt;

'''Parametrization''' (or '''parameterization'''; also '''parameterisation''', '''parametrisation''') is the process of finding [[parametric equation]]s of a [[curve]], a [[surface (mathematics)|surface]], or, more generally, a [[manifold]] or a [[algebraic variety|variety]], defined by an [[implicit equation]]. The inverse process is called [[implicitization]].&lt;ref name="hughes"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/828768012|title=Calculus : Single and multivariable.|last=Hughes-Hallet|first=Deborah|last2=McCallum|first2=William G.|last3=Gleason|first3=Andrew M.|date=2012-01-01|publisher=John wiley|year=|isbn=9780470888612|location=|pages=780|oclc=828768012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "To parameterize" by itself means "to express in terms of [[parameter]]s".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/parameterize|title=Definition of PARAMETERIZE|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parametrization is a [[mathematical]] process consisting of expressing the state of a [[system]], [[process (science)|process]] or model as a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of some independent quantities called [[parameter]]s. The state of the system is generally determined by a finite set of [[coordinate]]s, and the parametrization consists thus of one [[function of several real variables]] for each coordinate. The number of parameters is the number of [[degrees of freedom]] of the system.

For example, the position of a [[point (geometry)|point]] that moves on a [[curve (geometry)|curve]] in the [[three-dimensional space]] is determined by the time needed to reach the point when starting from a fixed origin. If {{math|''x'', ''y'', ''z''}} are the coordinates of the point, the movement is thus described by a parametric equation &lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
x&amp;=f(t)\\y&amp;=g(t)\\z&amp;=h(t),
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''t''}} denotes the time. Such a parametric equation determines completely the curve, without the need of any interpretation of {{math|''t''}} as a time, and is thus called a ''parametric equation'' of the curve (this is sometimes abbreviated by saying that one has a ''parametric curve''). One gets similarly the parametric equation of a surface by considering functions of two parameters {{math|''t''}} and {{math|''u''}}.

== Non-uniqueness ==
Parametrizations are not generally [[unique (mathematics)|unique]]. The ordinary [[three-dimensional]] object can be parametrized (or 'coordinatized') equally efficiently with [[Cartesian coordinate]]s (x,y,z), [[cylindrical polar coordinates]] ([[Radial distance (geometry)|ρ]], [[Azimuth|φ]], [[Signed distance function|z]]), [[spherical coordinate]]s ([[Radial distance (geometry)|r]],φ,θ) or other [[coordinate system]]s.

Similarly, the color space of human [[Trichromacy|trichromatic color vision]] can be parametrized in terms of the three colors red, green and blue, [[RGB]], or with cyan, magenta, yellow and black, [[CMYK]].

== Dimensionality ==
Generally, the minimum number of parameters required to describe a model or geometric object is equal to its [[dimension]], and the scope of the parameters—within their allowed ranges—is the [[parameter space]]. Though a good set of parameters permits identification of every point in the parameter space, it may be that, for a given parametrization, different parameter values can refer to the same 'physical' point. Such mappings are [[surjective]] but not [[injective]]. An example is the pair of cylindrical polar coordinates (ρ,φ,z) and (ρ,φ + 2π,z).

== Parametrization invariance ==
As indicated above, there is arbitrariness in the choice of parameters of a given model, geometric object, etc. Often, one wishes to determine intrinsic properties of an object that do not depend on this arbitrariness, which are therefore independent of any particular choice of parameters. This is particularly the case in physics, wherein parametrization [[Invariant (physics)|invariance]] (or 'reparametrization invariance') is a guiding principle in the search for [[physical theory|physically acceptable theories]] (particularly in [[general relativity]]).

For example, whilst the location of a fixed point on some curved line may be given by a set of numbers whose values depend on how the curve is parametrized, the [[length]] (appropriately defined) of the curve between ''two'' such fixed points will be independent of the particular choice of parametrization (in this case: the method by which an arbitrary point on the line is uniquely indexed). The length of the curve is therefore a parameterization-invariant quantity. In such cases parameterization is a mathematical tool employed to extract a result whose value does not depend on, or make reference to, the details of the parameterization. More generally, parametrization invariance of a physical theory implies that either the [[dimension]]ality or the volume of the parameter space is larger than is necessary to describe the physics (the quantities of physical significance) in question.

Though the theory of [[general relativity]] can be expressed without reference to a coordinate system, calculations of physical (i.e. observable) quantities such as the curvature of [[spacetime]] invariably involve the introduction of a particular coordinate system in order to refer to spacetime points involved in the calculation. In the context of general relativity then, the choice of coordinate system may be regarded as a method of 'parameterizing' the spacetime, and the insensitivity of the result of a calculation of a physically-significant quantity to that choice can be regarded as an example of parameterization invariance.

As another example, physical theories whose observable quantities depend only on the ''relative'' distances (the ratio of distances) between pairs of objects are said to be [[scale invariant]]. In such theories any reference in the course of a calculation to an absolute distance would imply the introduction of a parameter to which the theory is invariant.

'''Patience''' is an English feminine given name referring to the [[virtue]] of [[patience]]. It was a name created by the [[Puritan]]s in the 1600s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.behindthename.com/name/patience&lt;/ref&gt; It has seen steady, though infrequent, usage in the United States throughout its history. The name has ranked among the top 1,000 names given to newborn girls in the United States since 1994, when it returned to the top 1,000 for the first time since 1894. In 2011, it was the 843rd most popular name given to newborn American girls.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ssa.gov/cgi-bin/babyname.cgi&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7897">The '''Pollyanna principle''' (also called '''Pollyannaism''' or '''positivity bias''') is the tendency for people to remember pleasant items more accurately than unpleasant ones.{{sfn|Matlin|Stang|1978|p=260}} Research{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} indicates that at the subconscious level, the mind has a tendency to focus on the optimistic; while at the conscious level, it has a tendency to focus on the negative. This subconscious bias towards the positive is often described as the Pollyanna principle and is similar to the [[Barnum effect|Forer effect]].&lt;ref&gt;http://apsychoserver.psych.arizona.edu/JJBAReprints/PSYC621/Forer_The%20fallacy%20of%20personal%20validation_1949.pdf Forer BR (1949). The fallacy of personal validation: A classroom demonstration of gullibility ''Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology''. 44, 118-123&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The name derives from the 1913 novel ''[[Pollyanna]]'' by [[Eleanor H. Porter]] describing a girl who plays the "glad game"—trying to find something to be glad about in every situation. The novel has been adapted to film several times, most famously in [[Pollyanna (1920 film)|1920]] and [[Pollyanna (1960 film)|1960]]. An early use of the name "Pollyanna" in psychological literature was in 1969 by Boucher and Osgood who described a ''Pollyanna hypothesis'' as a universal human tendency to use evaluatively positive words more frequently and diversely than evaluatively negative words in communicating.{{sfn|Boucher|Osgood|1969}} Empirical evidence for this tendency has been provided by computational analyses of large corpora of text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dodds|first=Peter Sheridan|last2=Clark|first2=Eric M.|last3=Desu|first3=Suma|last4=Frank|first4=Morgan R.|last5=Reagan|first5=Andrew J.|last6=Williams|first6=Jake Ryland|last7=Mitchell|first7=Lewis|last8=Harris|first8=Kameron Decker|last9=Kloumann|first9=Isabel M.|date=2015-02-24|title=Human language reveals a universal positivity bias|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/112/8/2389|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=112|issue=8|pages=2389–2394|doi=10.1073/pnas.1411678112|issn=0027-8424|pmid=25675475|pmc=4345622|arxiv=1406.3855|bibcode=2015PNAS..112.2389D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holtz|first=Peter|last2=Deutschmann|first2=Emanuel|last3=Dobewall|first3=Henrik|date=2017-08-23|title=Cross-Cultural Psychology and the Rise of Academic Capitalism: Linguistic Changes in CCR and JCCP Articles, 1970-2014|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0022022117724902|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology|language=en|volume=48|issue=9|pages=1410–1431|doi=10.1177/0022022117724902|issn=0022-0221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Pollyanna principle'' was described by Matlin and Stang in 1978 using the [[archetype]] of Pollyanna more specifically as a psychological principle which portrays the [[nostalgia|positive bias people have when thinking of the past]]. According to the Pollyanna Principle, the brain processes information that is pleasing and agreeable in a more precise and exact manner as compared to unpleasant information. We actually tend to remember past experiences as more rosy than they actually occurred.{{sfn|Matlin|Stang|1978}}

Researchers Margaret Matlin and David Stang provided substantial evidence of the Pollyanna Principle. They found that people expose themselves to positive stimuli and avoid negative stimuli, they take longer to recognize what is unpleasant or threatening than what is pleasant and safe, and they report that they encounter positive stimuli more frequently than they actually do. Matlin and Stang also determined that selective recall was a more likely occurrence when recall was delayed: the longer the delay, the more selective recall that occurred.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

The Pollyanna principle has been observed on online social networks as well. For example, [[Twitter]] users preferentially share more, and are emotionally affected more frequently by, positive information.{{sfn|Ferrara|Yang|2015a}}{{sfn|Ferrara|Yang|2015b}}

However, the Pollyanna principle does not always apply to individuals suffering from [[Depression (mood)|depression]] or [[anxiety]], who tend to either have more [[depressive realism]] or a negative bias.{{sfn|Carr|2004}}

The '''prime time''' or the '''peak time''' is the block of [[broadcast programming]] taking place during the middle of the evening for [[television program]]ming.

The term ''prime time'' is often defined in terms of a fixed time period – for example (in the [[United States]]), from 8:00p.m. to 11:00p.m. (Eastern and Pacific Time) or 7:00p.m. to 10:00p.m. (Central and Mountain Time).

During [[Muslim holidays|Eid]] Season, most of the TV Stations broadcast their especially produced shows and World Television Premiers starting from 15.00 to 24.00.
In [[Ramadan]], the broadcasters also air special Religious and Cooking shows starting from 14.00 to 20.00 affecting the primetime hours. Besides, Late Night Talkshows are also aired from 01.00 to 04.00 with Ramadan being exception.&lt;ref&gt;http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tv/channel/ntv-bangladesh/params/tvchannel/channelid-10000000016910000&lt;/ref&gt; Religious shows are also broadcast simultaneously from 01.00 along with Talkshows and News Analysis.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thedailystar.net/arts-entertainment/tv/eid-delights-the-small-screen-1424986&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
In [[Television in the People's Republic of China|Chinese television]], the 19:00-to-22:00 time slot is known as '''Golden Time''' ([[Traditional Chinese]]: 黄金時間; [[Simplified Chinese]]: 黄金时间; [[Pinyin]]: Huángjīn shíjiān). The term also influenced a nickname of a strip of holidays in known as [[Golden Week (China)|Golden Week]].

====Hong Kong and Macau====
Prime time usually takes place from 19:00 until 22:00. After that, programs classified as “PG” (Parental Guidance) are allowed to be broadcast. Frontline dramas appear during this time slot in Cantonese, as well as movies in English.

=== India ===
In [[India]], prime time occurs between 20:00 and 22:30. The main news programs are broadcast at 20:30, and the highest-rated television program is preceded by it at 20:00. Usually, programmes during prime time are domestic dramas, foreign drama series (mostly American), movies and entertainment programmes.

===Indonesia===
Prime time usually takes place from 18:00 to 23:00 [[Time in Indonesia|WIB]], preceded by a daily newscast at 17:00 (although some channels broadcast their daily evening newscasts earlier, usually at 16:00 or 16:30). After prime time, programs classified as '''Adult''', as well as cigarette commercials, are allowed to be broadcast,.

Like another [[Islam by country|Muslim-majority country]], there is also a 'midnight prime time' during [[suhoor|sahur]] time in a month of [[Ramadan]]. It takes place from 02:00 (or 02:30 in some channels) and ends at the [[Fajr]] prayer call, varies between 04:30 and 05:00. The time slot is usually filled with comedy and religious programming.

===Iraq===
In [[Iraq]], prime time runs from 20:00 to 23:00. The main news programs are broadcast at 20:00 and the highest-rated television program airs at 21:00.

===Japan===
In [[Japanese television programs|Japanese television]], the 19:00-to-22:00 time slot is also known as {{Nihongo|'''Golden Time'''|ゴールデン・タイム|gōruden taimu|extra=or just '''Golden'''}}. The term also influenced a nickname of a strip of holidays in known as [[Golden Week (Japan)|Golden Week]].

===Malaysia===
[[Malaysia]]n prime time starts with the main news from 20:00 to 20:30 (now 20:00 to 21:00) and ends either at 23:00 or 0:30, or possibly later. Usually, programmes during prime time are domestic dramas, foreign drama series (mostly American), films and entertainment programmes. Programmes classified as 18 are not allowed to be broadcast before 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. but on [[Radio Televisyen Malaysia|RTM]], most programmes on this slot are rated U (U means ''Umum'' in Malay and literally General Viewing or General Audiences in English) throughout the whole day. However, programmes broadcast after 23:00 are still considered prime time. As of December 2010, [[NTV7]]'s prime time continues until 12:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. Programmes during prime time may have longer commercial breaks due to number of viewers.

Some domestic prime time productions may be affected because of certain major sporting events such as [[FIFA World Cup]]. However, only FIFA World Cup in the [[Americas]] did not affect the domestic prime time programmes.

=== Pakistan ===
In [[Pakistan]], The prime time begins between 20:00 - 22:00 [[Pakistan Standard Time]]. During this time majority of the local channels broadcast news and or drama serials, however on state channels it has been observed that they broadcast Khabarnama (New Bulletin) from past many decades.

===Philippines===
In the Philippines, prime time blocks begin at 18:00 (now 17:50 or 17:00) and run until about 23:00 (or 23:30) on weekdays, and 19:00 to 23:00 on weekends. The weekday prime time blocks usually consists of local [[teleserye]]s (soap operas) and foreign television series. The network's highest-rated programs are usually aired right after the evening newscast at 20:00, while a foreign series usually precedes the late night newscast.

On weekends, non-scripted programming such as talent shows, reality shows and current affairs shows air in prime time. For the minor networks, prime time consists of American television series on weekdays, with encores of those shows on weekends. Prime time originally started earlier at around 19:00, but the evening newscasts were lengthened to 90 minutes and now start at 18:30, instead of the original one-hour newscast that starts at 18:00.

In the 1990s, the commercial channel [[Sat.1]] suffered a significant loss of audience share when it tried moving the start of its prime time to 20.00.

===Greece===
In [[Greece]], prime time runs from 21.00 (usually following the news) to 24.00.

===Hungary===
In [[Hungary]], prime time on weekdays on the two big commercial stations ([[RTL Klub]] and [[TV2 (Hungary)|TV2]]) starts at 19.00 with game shows, tabloid and docu-reality programmes. At 21.00, two popular soap operas air: ''Barátok közt'' and ''Jóban Rosszban'', which follows at 21.30. American and other series, movies, talk-shows and magazines run until 23.30. The prime-time lineup is preceded by daily news programmes at 18.30. At weekends prime time begins at 19.00, with blockbuster movies and television shows.

Before 15 March 2015, the public television station [[M1 (TV channel)|M1]] began its prime time with a game show at 18.30, which was followed by the daily news programme ''Híradó'' at 19.30. After the news, the channel broadcast American and other series, talk shows, magazines, and news programmes until 22.00, after which came the daily news magazine ''Este'' and the late edition of ''Híradó''.

From 15 March 2015, [[Duna Televízió|Duna]] began broadcasting all of the entertainment programming transferred to it from that date from M1, meaning that prime time on Duna now begins at 18.00, starting with the simulcast of the 18.00 edition of Híradó from the newly re-launched news channel, M1.

===Iceland===
In [[Iceland]], prime time starts at 19:30. It is preceded by a daily newscast at 19:00.

===Italy===
In [[Italy]], prime time (called "prima serata") is from 21:00&amp;nbsp;to 23:30. It usually follows news and, on some networks (like [[Rai 1]] and [[Canale 5]]), a slot called “access prime time”. Shows, movies, and sport events are usually shown during prime time.

===Netherlands===
Much like in Germany, prime time in the [[Netherlands]] usually begins at 20:30 in order to not compete with [[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting|NOS]]'s flagship 20:00 newscast.

===Norway===
In [[Norway]], prime time starts at 19:45. On the [[NRK1]] channel it is preceded by the daily newscast ''[[Dagsrevyen]]'' at 19:00. Locally, prime time is called {{lang|no|beste sendetid}} (lit. "best time for broadcasting").

===Poland===
In [[Poland]], prime time starts around 20:00 (sometimes 20:30). On ([[TVP 1]]) It is preceded by a daily newscast at 19:30, on ([[TVN (Poland)|TVN]]) the newscast is aired at 19:00 followed by the newsmagazine Uwaga at 19:50 (weekdays)/19:45 (weekends) and then the soap Na Wspólnej at 20:05 (Monday to Thursday, from Friday to Sunday (at 20:00) various: movies on Friday, show or movies (Winter and Summer) at Saturday, and programme or movies (Winter and Summer) at Sunday), on ([[Polsat]]) the news is aired at 18:50, followed by a sitcom Świat według Kiepskich at 19:30.

===Russia===
In [[Russia]] television prime time is between 19:00 and 23:00 on working days and from 15:00 to 01:00 on holidays.
On radio stations there are morning, day and evening prime times. The most common division:
morning — 6:30 to 10:00;
day — с 12:00 to 14:00;
evening - 16:00 to 21:00.

===Slovakia===
Public television in Slovakia consists of two channels; on the main channel ([[Jednotka]]) prime time starts at 20:10, and on the second one ([[Dvojka]]) prime time programming starts at 20:00. The two biggest private broadcasters set the start of prime time programming at 20:20 ([[Markíza]]) and 20:30 ([[TV JOJ|JOJ]]). Generally, however, prime time is considered to be from 20:00 to 23:00.

===Slovenia===
In [[Slovenia]], prime time, the period in which the most-watched shows are broadcast, is from 8:00pm to 11:00pm. It is preceded by daily newscasts; Dnevnik RTV SLO (7:00pm–8:00pm) on TV SLO 1, 24ur (6:55pm–8:00pm) on POP TV, Svet na Kanalu A (6:00pm–7:00pm; 7:50pm–8:0pm), and Danes (7:30pm–8:00pm) on Planet TV.

===Spain===
In [[Spain]], prime time refers to the time period in which the most-watched shows are broadcast. Prime time in Spain starts quite late when compared to most nations as it runs from 22:30 till 01:00. Most news programmes in Spain air at 21:00 for an hour and prime time follows. However, due to fierce competition, especially among the private stations prime time has even been delayed until 23:00. Most channels are delaying prime time in order to protect their top shows from sporting events.

In the 1990s, prime time in Spain began at 21:00, moving to 21:30 in the latter half of the 1990s and 22:00 in the early 2000s. Commercial broadcaster [[laSexta]] and the second channel from the Public broadcasting [[La 2 (Spain)|La 2]] have attempted to shift prime time back to 21:30 in 2006 and Spring 2007, but these attempts have been unsuccessful. Fellow public channel [[La 1 (Spain)|La 1]] also tried to pull prime time back to 21:00 in early 2015, to no avail.

The lateness in the start of prime time in Spain is also due to Spanish culture. Spanish people generally work from 09:00-14:00 and then from 17:00-20:00 as opposed to the standard 09:00-17:00. The popular late night show ''Crónicas Marcianas'' during the late 1990s–2000 also helped to extend prime time well into the early hours with the show being watched by a share of 40%, despite finishing at 02:00.

Spain might also be unique in that it has a second prime time, running from 14:30-17:00 which coincides with the extended Spanish lunch break. Shows airing in the secondary prime time period on many occasions beat those prime time shows at night on a daily basis. The second prime time only occurs on weekdays, though and the slot is usually filled with [[The Simpsons]], news, soap operas and talk shows.

===Sweden===
In [[Sweden]], prime time starts at 20:00. It is preceded by a daily newscast at 19:30 and local news at 19:50.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, the term used is '''peak time''', early peak is 17:30 to 20:00 and late peak is 20:00 to 23:00.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/itc/itc_publications/codes_guidance/programme_code/section_4.asp.html|title=Regulator Archives|publisher=|accessdate=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Latin America==
In a great part of [[Television in Latin America|Latin America]]n countries, prime time is considered to be from 6:00 or 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. to 10:00 or 11:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. The time slot is usually used for [[news]], [[telenovelas]] and [[television series]], and special time slots are used for [[reality shows]], with great popularity, especially in [[Television in Mexico|Mexico]] and [[Television in Brazil|Brazil]]. In Mexico, Prime Time is known as ''horario estelar'' ("Stellar Time"). In Brazil, it is called ''horário nobre'' (“noble time”), which is the time the three most famous telenovelas in the country are shown each weekday and on Saturdays. There are also news programs, reality shows, and sitcoms.

===Argentina===
In [[Television in Argentina|Argentina]], prime time is considered to be from 8.00 p.m. until 12.00 a.m.; with the most successful series and telenovelas in the country (such as ''[[Los Roldán]]'' and ''[[Valientes]]''), and entertainment shows, like CQC (Caiga Quien Caiga).

===Chile===
In [[Chile]], prime time is considered to be from 10.30 p.m. until 01.00 a.m.; with the most successful series and telenovelas in the country (such as ''Socias'' and ''Las Vega's''). Investigation entertainment shows (like ''[[Informe especial|Informe Especial]]'', ''Contacto'', ''Apuesto por tí'') also air.

==North America==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2018}}
[[File:Dayparting in the United States.svg|thumb|right|U.S. TV [[dayparting]]; prime time is in light purple]]
In [[North America]], [[television network]]s feed their prime time programming in two blocks: one for the [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]], [[Central Time Zone|Central]], and [[Mountain Time Zone|Mountain]] [[time zone]]s, and one for the [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific]], [[Alaskan Time Zone|Alaskan]], and [[Hawaii-Aleutian time zone|Hawaiian]] time zones, to their local [[network affiliate]]s. In [[Atlantic Canada]] (including [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]) as well as Alaska and Hawaii, there is no change in the interpretation or usage of “prime time” as the concept is not attached to time zones in any way. Affiliates in the Mountain, Alaskan, and Hawaii-Aleutian zones are either on their own to delay broadcast by an hour or two, or collectively form a small, regional network feed with others in the same time zone.

Prime time is commonly defined as 8:00-11:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. Eastern/Pacific and 7:00-10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. Central/Mountain. On Sundays, the major broadcast television networks traditionally begin their primetime programming at 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. (Eastern/Pacific, 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. Central/Mountain) instead. Some networks such as [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], [[The CW]], and [[MyNetworkTV]] only broadcast from 8:00-10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., a time period known as "common prime". Most networks air primetime programming nightly, but the smaller MyNetworkTV only broadcasts prime time programs on weekdays, and The CW only broadcasts on weekdays and Sundays as of 2018, leaving weekends to their affiliates. In Canada, [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] and [[Global Television Network|Global]] both follow the same model as the larger U.S. networks (although CTV may occasionally air programming in the 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. hour in the event of scheduling conflicts with other U.S. imports), while [[CBC Television]], [[Citytv (TV network)|Citytv]] and [[CTV Two]] only schedule prime time programs within the common prime period (with the 10:00 p.m.&amp;nbsp;p.m. hour dedicated to syndicated programming on City and CTV Two, and CBC airing its news program ''[[The National (TV program)|The National]]'').

The major networks have come to consider Saturday prime time as a [[graveyard slot]], and have largely abandoned scheduling of new scripted programming on that night. The major networks still maintain a prime time programming schedule on Saturdays; while live sporting events (most commonly [[college football]] in the United States and [[ice hockey]] in Canada) are generally preferred to fill the time slot, they typically air encores of programs aired earlier in the week, films, non-scripted reality programs, [[true crime]] programs produced by their news divisions and, occasionally, [[Burning off|burned off]] episodes of low-rated or cancelled series.

Prime time can be extended or truncated if coverage of sporting events run past their allotted end time. Since the "[[Heidi Game]]" incident in 1968, in which [[NBC]] cut away from coverage of a [[New York Jets]]/[[Oakland Raiders]] football game on the east coast in order to show a movie (and, in the process, causing viewers to miss an unexpected comeback by the Raiders to win the game), the later [[National Football League]] mandated that all games be broadcast in their entirety in the markets of the teams involved. Due to this rule, game telecasts may sometimes overrun into the 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. ET hour. [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] previously scheduled repeats of its animated series in the 7:00 hour, allowing themselves to simply pre-empt the reruns if a game ran long. This was later replaced by a half-hour-long wrap-up show, ''[[The OT]]''. In contrast, [[CBS]] does not, as its weekly newsmagazine ''[[60 Minutes]]'' has traditionally aired as close to 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. ET as possible. Even if a game runs past that hour, CBS shows ''60 Minutes'' in its entirety after the conclusion of coverage, and the rest of the prime time schedule on the East Coast is shifted to compensate. For example, if game coverage were to end at 7:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., prime time would end at 11:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.

However, in the rare case where the NFL game runs excessively late (8 p.m. or later), the series scheduled to air at 10 p.m. is preempted, with the West Coast usually receiving a repeat of the 10 p.m. series instead. In an extreme case, CBS's prime time can be extended past midnight during broadcasts of the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]]. This does not necessarily apply universally; in 2001, after an [[XFL]] game went into double overtime, causing a 45-minute delay of a highly promoted episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', [[NBC]] made a decision to cut off all future XFL broadcasts at 11:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. ET. Since the launch of [[NBCSN]], NBC has occasionally invoked this curfew by moving event overruns to the channel when allowed.

Until the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) regulated time slots prior to prime time with the now-defunct [[Prime Time Access Rule]] in the 1971–1972 season, networks began programming at 7:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. Eastern and Pacific/6:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. Central and Mountain on weeknights. The change helped instigate what is colloquially known as the "[[rural purge]]"—a long-term trend away from programs appealing to older and rural audiences in favor of programs catering towards younger, "urban" viewers. As a result, the hour became a lucrative timeslot for syndicated programming in the years that followed, with [[game show|game]] and [[variety show]]s, as well as other syndicated reruns, becoming popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-09-14/entertainment/ca-4986_1_prime-time-lineup|title=Syndicated-tv Reviews :  Prime-time Lead-ins On Nbc: Joke's On Viewers|last=ROSENBERG|first=HOWARD|date=1987-09-14|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1987-09-13/entertainment/8703100482_1_checkerboard-format-network-budget-viewers|title=COMEDIES TRYING TO GET THE JUMP ON GAME SHOWS|last=Daley|first=Steve|work=Chicago Tribunemaccess-date=2018-09-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/2004/12/02/tvs-rural-purge/2516ce4b-9140-4f92-b30f-6bb3a9582ca1/|title=TV's 'Rural Purge'|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast majority of prime time programming in English-speaking North America comes from the United States, with only a limited amount produced in [[Canada]]. The [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] mandates quotas for [[Canadian content]] in prime time; these quotas indicate at least half of Canadian prime time programs must be Canadian in origin, but the majority of this is served by national and [[local news]] or localized entertainment gossip shows such as [[Global Television Network|Global]]'s ''[[Entertainment Tonight Canada|ET Canada]]'' and [[CTV Television Network|CTV]]'s ''[[eTalk]]''.

Likewise, the vast majority of Spanish-language programming in North America comes from [[Mexico]]. [[Televisa]], a Mexican network, provides the majority of programming to the dominant U.S.-based Spanish broadcaster, [[Univision]]. Univision does produce a fairly large amount of unscripted Spanish-language programming, the best known having been the long-running variety show ''[[Sábado Gigante]]'', hosted and created by Chilean national [[Don Francisco (television host)|Don Francisco]]. Univision's distant second-place competitor, [[Telemundo]], produces a much greater share of in-house content, including a long line of [[telenovela]]s.

In Quebec, the largest Francophone area of North America, French-language programming consists of originally produced programs (most of which are produced in [[Montreal]], with a few produced in Quebec City) and a few French-language dubs of English language programs. On all of the Quebec networks, entertainment programming is scheduled only between 8 and 10 p.m., with the 10-11 p.m. hour given over to a network newscast or a nightly talk show.

===Prime time in the context of U.S. radio/TV-revenues===
Prime time is the [[daypart]] (a block of a day's programming schedule) with the most viewers and is generally where [[television networks]] and local stations reap much of their advertising revenues. In recent years television advertising expenditure in the US has been highest during prime-time drama shows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statista.com/statistics/223207/genre-breakdown-of-primetime-tv-ad-spend-in-the-us/ Genre breakdown of primetime TV advertising expenditure in the United States in 2011]. Nielsen. April 2012. Retrieved November 6, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nielsen ratings]] system is explicitly designed for the optimum measurement of audience viewership by dayparts with prime time being of most interest. Most people tend to watch television at prime time, as most often, based on standard [[working time]], the end of the work day coincides with prime time viewing hours. Most viewers sit down to watch TV after dinner. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} This is usually the main reason for the high ratings for television programming at this time, as well as the attraction of the timeslot for advertisers.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

The existence of prime time in the United States is largely an artifact of now repealed regulations of the [[Federal Communications Commission]], which limited the number of hours that a network can require its affiliates to broadcast.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Additionally, networks may also choose to provide [[Network affiliate|local affiliates]] the opportunity to air [[sport]]ing events or other special events which may fall outside of standard designated network broadcast times.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Prime time for radio is called “Drive time” and, in Eastern and Pacific Time, is 6–10 a.m. and 3–7 p.m. and, for Mountain and Central Time, is 5–9 a.m. and 2–6 p.m.

A survey by Nielsen revealed that viewers watched almost two hours worth of TV during prime time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketingcharts.com/wp/television/how-much-tv-do-people-watch-during-the-day-28359/ How Much TV Do People Watch During the Day?] Marketingcharts.com. April 4, 2013. Retrieved November 5, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oceania==

===Australia===
Prime time in [[Television in Australia|Australia]] is officially from 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. to midnight, following [[Australian Eastern Standard Time]], with the highest ratings normally achieved between 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. to 9:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.

===New Zealand===
Traditionally, prime time in [[Television in New Zealand|New Zealand]] is considered to be 7:30pm to 10:30pm, but can be extended to cover the entire evening of television (5:30pm to 11:00pm).

{{wiktionary}}
A '''rabbit punch''' is a [[punch (strike)|blow]] to the back of the head or to the base of the [[skull]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://healthyliving.azcentral.com/rabbit-punching-boxing-3702.html |title=What Is Rabbit Punching in Boxing? |first=Matthew |last=Lee |publisher=AZCentral}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered especially dangerous because it can damage the [[cervical vertebrae]] and subsequently the [[spinal cord]], which may lead to serious and irreparable [[spinal cord injury]].  A rabbit punch can also detach the victim's brain from the brain stem,{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} which can kill instantly.

The punch's name is derived from the use of the technique by [[hunter]]s to kill [[rabbit]]s with a quick, sharp [[strike (attack)|strike]] to the back of the head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Langer |first=Richard |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040501011125/http://www.motherearthnews.com/menarch/archive/issues/015/015-018-01.htm |title=Extract from "Grow it!" |publisher=''www.motherearthnews.com'' |url=http://www.motherearthnews.com/menarch/archive/issues/015/015-018-01.htm |archivedate=2004-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3423">The '''rank-dependent expected utility''' model (originally called '''anticipated utility''') is a [[generalized expected utility]]  model of choice under [[uncertainty]], designed to explain the behaviour observed in the [[Allais paradox]], as well as for the observation that many people both purchase lottery tickets (implying [[risk-loving]] preferences) and insure against losses (implying [[risk aversion]]).

A natural explanation of these observations is that individuals overweight low-probability events such as winning the lottery, or suffering a disastrous insurable loss. In the Allais paradox, individuals appear to forgo the chance of a very large gain to avoid a one per cent chance of missing out on an otherwise certain large gain, but are less risk averse when offered the chance of reducing an 11 per cent chance of loss to 10 per cent.

A number of attempts were made to model preferences incorporating probability theory, most notably the original version of [[prospect theory]], presented by [[Daniel Kahneman]] and [[Amos Tversky]] (1979). However, all such models involved violations of first-order [[stochastic dominance]]. In prospect theory, violations of dominance were avoided by the introduction of an 'editing' operation, but this gave rise to violations of [[transitive relation|transitivity]].

The crucial idea of rank-dependent expected utility was to overweigh only unlikely extreme outcomes, rather than all unlikely events. Formalising this insight required transformations to be applied to the cumulative probability distribution function, rather than to individual probabilities ([[John Quiggin|Quiggin]], 1982, 1993).

The central idea of rank-dependent weightings was then incorporated by [[Daniel Kahneman]] and [[Amos Tversky]] into prospect theory, and the resulting model was referred to as [[cumulative prospect theory]] (Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1992).

==Formal representation==

As the name implies, the rank-dependent model is applied to the increasing rearrangement &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}_{[ \; ]}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt; which satisfies &lt;math&gt;y_{[1]}\leq y_{[2]}\leq ...\leq
y_{[S]}&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;W(\mathbf{y})=\sum_{s\in \Omega }h_{[s]}(\mathbf{\pi })u(y_{[s]}) &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\pi }\in \Pi ,u:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} ,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h_{[s]}(
\mathbf{\pi })&lt;/math&gt; is a probability weight such that 
&lt;math&gt;h_{[s]}(\mathbf{\pi })=q\left( \sum\limits_{t=1}^{s}\pi _{[t]}\right)
-q\left( \sum\limits_{t=1}^{s-1}\pi _{[t]}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

for a transformation function &lt;math&gt;q:[0,1]\rightarrow [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;q(0)=0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;
q(1)=1 &lt;/math&gt;.

Note that 
&lt;math&gt;\sum_{s\in \Omega }h_{[s]}(\mathbf{\pi })=q\left( \sum\limits_{t=1}^{S}\pi
_{[t]}\right) =q(1)=1 &lt;/math&gt;
so that the decision weights sum to 1.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7545">The '''right of reply''' generally means the right to defend oneself against public criticism in the same venue where it was published. In some countries, such as Brazil, it is a legal or even constitutional right. In other countries, it is not a legal right as such, but a right which certain media outlets and publications choose to grant to people who have been severely criticised by them, as a matter of editorial policy.

==By Law==

===Brazil===
The [[Brazilian Constitution]] guarantees the right of reply (''direito de resposta'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Constituicao/Constituicao.htm] (article 5, V) Retrieved November 12, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===

====European Union====
In Europe, there have been proposals for a legally enforceable right of reply that applies to all [[mass media|media]], including [[newspapers]], [[magazines]], and other print media, along with [[radio]], [[television]], and the [[internet]]. In 1974, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe already voted a resolution granting a right of reply to all individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=09000016805048e1 |title=Resolution of the Committee of Ministers on the Right of Reply|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 1 of a 2004 [[Council of Europe]] recommendation defined a right of reply as: ''offering a possibility to react to any information in the media presenting inaccurate facts &amp;hellip; which affect &amp;hellip; personal rights''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search.coe.int/cm/Pages/result_details.aspx?ObjectID=09000016805db3b6 |title=Draft Recommendation of the Committee of Ministers to Member States on the Right of Reply in the New Media Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mediawise.org.uk/display_page.php?id=823 |title=MediaWise submission to DCMS consultation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060116213940/http://www.mediawise.org.uk/display_page.php?id=823 |archivedate=2006-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Individual countries====
In the federal system of [[Germany]], the individual federal states are responsible for education, cultural affairs, and also the press and electronic media. All press laws of the 16 federal states guarantee the right to a counter presentation of factual statements which are deemed to be wrong by the individuals and organisations concerned. This is based on article 11 the national press law of 1874, and is found in all 16 laws as §11 or §10 in slightly modified versions.

[[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]] have similar laws on the book. In Austria this is in article 9 of the national media law, in Switzerland in article 28g of the civil code.

In [[France]], the right to a corrective reply goes back to the [[:fr:loi sur la liberté de la presse du 29 juillet 1881|article 13 of the ''Law on the freedom of the press'' of July 29, 1881]] and is renewed and extended to broadcast and digital media via various laws and decrees.

The [[Belgium|Belgian]] law on the right to reply emerged in 1831 as article 13 of the 1831 decree on the press. This was replaced 130 years later by the law on the ''droit de réponse'' or «loi du 23 juin 1961». Originally referring only to the printed press, this law was amended in 1977 by the law of  «4 mars 1977 relative au droit de réponse dans l’audiovisuel» i.e. audiovisual media, published in the ''Moniteur Belge'' of March 15, 1977.&lt;ref name="RDTI_2007-27"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Obs_Avis-No5"/&gt; Since the federalisation of the Belgian state in 1980, the language communities are responsible for the media, and so the Flemish community has passed in 2005 a decrée dated March 4, 2005, which regulates the right to reply in articles 177 to 199, and the German language community has passed the decree of 27 June 2005, which simply refers to the law of 1961 as amended in 1977.&lt;ref name="RDTI_2007-27"/&gt;{{rp|p.32}}

===United Nations===

The United Nations recognises the "International Right of Correction" through the "Convention on the International Right of Correction", which entered into force on August 24, 1962.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/instree/u1circ.htm Convention on the International Right of Correction, 435 U.N.T.S. 191, entered into force August 24, 1962.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
A Florida right of reply law (referring to print media) was overturned by ''[[Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo]]'', [[Case citation|418 U.S. 241]] (1974), while a FCC policy (referring to broadcast media) was affirmed in ''[[Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC]]'',  [[Case citation|395 U.S. 367]]  (1969).

==By editorial policy==

===BBC===
A right of reply can also be part of the editorial policy of a news publication or an academic journal. The [[BBC]]'s Editorial Guidelines state:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/editorialguidelines/page/guidelines-fairness-right-of-reply/ |title=BBC - Editorial Guidelines - Guidelines - Section 6: Fairness, Contributors and Consent - Right of Reply |author= |date= |work= |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2012-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote style="font-style:italic;"&gt;When our output makes allegations of wrongdoing, iniquity or incompetence or lays out a strong and damaging critique of an individual or institution the presumption is that those criticised should be given a "right of reply", that is, given a fair opportunity to respond to the allegations.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Australasian Journal of Philosophy''===
The ''[[Australasian Journal of Philosophy]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s editorial policy says:&lt;ref&gt;AJP: [http://www.ajp.aap.org.au/editorial-policy.html Editorial Policy] Retrieved August 3, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote style="font-style:italic;"&gt;[A]uthors of the materials being commented on [in Discussion Notes] may be given a right of reply (subject to the usual refereeing), on the understanding that timely publication of the Note will take priority over the desirability of including both Note and Reply in the same issue of the Journal.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The literal translation of the [[Latin]] "'''''salva veritate'''''" is "with (or by) unharmed truth", using [[ablative|ablative of manner]]: "''salva''" meaning "rescue," "salvation," or "welfare," and "''veritate''" meaning "reality" or "truth". Thus, ''Salva veritate'' (or '''intersubstitutivity''') is the logical condition by which two expressions may be interchanged without altering the [[truth-value]] of statements in which the expressions occur. Substitution ''salva veritate'' is not possible in [[opaque context]]s.&lt;ref&gt;L.T.F. Gamut, ''Logic, Language and Meaning'', 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

== Leibniz ==

The phrase occurs in two fragments from [[Gottfried Leibniz]]'s ''General Science. Characteristics'':

* In Chapter 19, Definition 1, Leibniz writes: "Two terms are the same (''eadem'') if one can be substituted for the other ''without altering the truth of any statement'' (''salva veritate'')."
* In Chapter 20, Definition 1, Leibniz writes: "Terms which can be substituted for one another wherever we please ''without altering the truth of any statement'' (''salva veritate''), are the same (''eadem'') or coincident (''coincidentia''). For example, '[[triangle]]' and 'trilateral', for in every proposition demonstrated by [[Euclid]] concerning 'triangle', 'trilateral' can be substituted ''without loss of [[truth]]'' (''salva veritate'')."

==Quine==

[[Willard Van Orman Quine|W.V.O. Quine]] takes substitutivity ''salva veritate'' to be the same as the "indiscernibility of identicals". Given a true statement, one of its two terms may be substituted for the other in any true statement and the result will be true.&lt;ref&gt;W.V.O. Quine, ''Quintessence: Reference and Modality'', 2004, p. 378&lt;/ref&gt; He continues to show that depending on context, the statement may change in value, In fact, the whole [[Quantification (logic)|quantified]] [[modal logic]] of necessity is dependent on context and empty otherwise; for it collapses if [[essence]] is withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;W.V.O. Quine, ''Quintessence: Reference and Modality'', 2004, pp. 356–357&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the statements:
{| style="width:90%"
|  style="width:10%" align="left"   | (1)
|  style="width:80%" align="center" | Giorgione = Barbarelli,
|-
|  style="width:10%" align="left"   | (2)
|  style="width:80%" align="center" | Giorgione was so-called because of his size
|}
are true;  however, replacement of the name 'Giorgione' by the name 'Barbarelli' turns (2) into the falsehood:
{| style="width:90%"
|  style="width:10%" align="left"   | &amp;nbsp;
|  style="width:80%" align="center" | Barbarelli was so-called because of his size.&lt;ref&gt;W.V.O. Quine, ''Quintessence: Reference and Modality'', 2004, p. 361&lt;/ref&gt;
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Quine's example here refers to [[Giorgio Barbarelli]]'s [[sobriquet]] "Giorgione", an Italian name roughly glossed as "Big George."

In [[mathematics]], applying the '''Schwarz reflection principle''' is a way to extend the domain of definition of an [[analytic function]] of a [[complex variable]], ''F'', which is defined on the [[upper half-plane]] and has well-defined and [[real number]] boundary values on the [[real axis]]. In that case, the putative extension of ''F'' to the rest of the [[complex plane]] is

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{F(\bar{z})}&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;F(\bar{z})=\overline{F(z)}.&lt;/math&gt;

That is, we make the definition that agrees along the real axis.

The result proved by [[Hermann Schwarz]] is as follows. Suppose that ''F'' is a [[continuous function]] on the closed upper half plane &lt;math&gt;\left\{ z \in \mathbb{C}\ |\ \mathrm{Im}(z) \geq 0 \right\} &lt;/math&gt;, [[Holomorphic function|holomorphic]] on the upper half plane &lt;math&gt;\left\{ F(z) \in \mathbb{C}\ |\ \mathrm{Im}(z) &gt; 0 \right\} &lt;/math&gt;, which takes real values on the real axis. Then the extension formula given above is an [[analytic continuation]] to the whole complex plane.

In practice it would be better to have a theorem that allows ''F'' certain singularities, for example ''F'' a [[meromorphic function]]. To understand such extensions, one needs a proof method that can be weakened. In fact [[Morera's theorem]] is well adapted to proving such statements. [[Contour integral]]s involving the extension of ''F'' clearly split into two, using part of the real axis. So, given that the principle is rather easy to prove in the special case from Morera's theorem, understanding the proof is enough to generate other results.

The principle also adapts to apply to [[harmonic function]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5265">{{see also|Tie-breaking in Swiss-system tournaments}}
The '''Sonneborn–Berger score''' (or the '''Neustadtl score''') is a [[Tie-breaking in Swiss-system tournaments|scoring system]] often used to [[tiebreakers|break ties]] in [[chess tournaments]]. As the Neustadtl score it is named after [[Hermann Neustadtl]], who proposed it in a letter published in ''[[The Chess Monthly (1879–1896)|Chess Monthly]]'' in 1882.

It is often called the Sonneborn–Berger score, though this is something of a misnomer, since [[William Sonneborn]] and [[Johann Berger]] were actually strong critics of the system; they proposed [[#Non-Neustadtl Sonneborn–Berger score|their own tie-breaking system]] that added in the raw score of each player but that did not help with tiebreaking and was therefore never popular and is not in use today.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

More common tiebreaking methods in [[chess tournaments]] include the Neustadtl Sonneborn–Berger score, head-to-head score, [[Koya score]], or favouring the player with the most wins (or black games). In [[Swiss system]] events, comparison of the [[Buchholz score]]s and the sum of progressive scores are common.

==Neustadtl Sonneborn–Berger score==
A player's ''Neustadtl Sonneborn–Berger score'' is calculated by adding the sum of the conventional scores of the players he/she has defeated to half the sum of the conventional scores of those he/she has [[draw (chess)|drawn]] against.

The main point is to give more value for a win/draw against a player ranked high, than for a win/draw against a player ranked low in the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chess.com/tournaments/help#tiebreak Chess.com: Tie-break methods]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since players may share the same Neustadtl score, further means of breaking ties may be required; common methods include considering the score in games played between the tied players or favouring the player with the most wins. Some tournaments do not use Neustadtl to break ties at all ([[Linares chess tournament|Linares]], for example, gives preference to the player with the most wins), and others use no tie-breaking method at all, sharing the prize money on offer between players. In national championships or events which act as qualifying tournaments for others, there may be a [[blitz chess|blitz]] playoff between the tied players. Neustadtl remains the most common tie-breaking method in [[round-robin tournament]]s, though in [[Swiss system]] events, comparison of the [[Buchholz score]]s and the [[sum of progressive scores]] is more common.

===Example===
As an example of the system in action, here is the [[crosstable]] of the 1975–80 [[World Correspondence Chess Championship]] Final (here '''cs''' indicates conventional score, '''ns''' Neustadtl score):

                   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15  cs   ns
 1.  Sloth         X ½ ½ 1 ½ ½ 1 1 ½  1  ½  1  1  1  1  11   69.5
 2.  Zagorovsky    ½ X 0 ½ 1 ½ 1 1 1  ½  1  1  1  1  1  11   66.75
 3.  Kosenkov      ½ 1 X ½ ½ ½ ½ ½ 1  1  ½  1  1  1  1  10½  67.5
 4.  Khasin        0 ½ ½ X ½ 1 ½ 0 1  1  ½  1  ½  1  ½  8½   54.75
 5.  Kletsel       ½ 0 ½ ½ X ½ ½ ½ ½  0  1  1  ½  1  1  8    47.75
 6.  De Carbonnel  ½ ½ ½ 0 ½ X ½ ½ 0  1  ½  ½  0  1  1  7    45.25
 7.  Arnlind       0 0 ½ ½ ½ ½ X ½ 1  0  ½  ½  1  1  ½  7    42.5
 8.  Dunhaupt      0 0 ½ 1 ½ ½ ½ X 0  ½  1  0  1  ½  1  7    41.5
 9.  Maedler       ½ 0 0 0 ½ 1 0 1 X  1  ½  ½  ½  ½  1  7    41.5
 10. Estrin        0 ½ 0 0 1 0 1 ½ 0  X  1  1  1  0  1  7    40.5
 11. Walther       ½ 0 ½ ½ 0 ½ ½ 0 ½  0  X  0  1  ½  1  5½   33.25
 12. Boey          0 0 0 0 0 ½ ½ 1 ½  0  1  X  ½  ½  1  5½   28.5
 13. Abramov       0 0 0 ½ ½ 1 0 0 ½  0  0  ½  X  ½  1  4½   24.75
 14. Siklos        0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ½ ½  1  ½  ½  ½  X  1  4½   22.75
 15. Nun           0 0 0 ½ 0 0 ½ 0 0  0  0  0  0  0  X  1    7.75

As can be seen, both [[Jørn Sloth]] and [[Vladimir Zagorovsky]] finished with 11/14, but Sloth was declared Correspondence Chess World Champion because of his superior Neustadtl score. For its part, Nun added 7.75 points as the result of his two draws: (8.5 + 7)/2 = 7.75 .

==Non-Neustadtl Sonneborn-Berger score ==
The ''Non-Neustadtl Sonneborn–Berger score'' is a scoring system used in [[chess]] tournaments and is considered an improvement to the [[#Neustadtl Sonneborn–Berger score|Neustadtl score]] proposed by William Sonneborn and [[Johann Berger]]. Sonneborn was a strong critic of the Neustadtl score, and suggested adding in the player's raw score. Berger supported this. However, adding in the raw score does no good when ranking tied players, and the suggestion died out and is seldom used today. However, the Neustadtl score is now commonly known as the Sonneborn–Berger score.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Oxford Companion to Chess]], Hooper and Whyld, 1992, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, he was the Patriarch of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam, a currently banned organisation in his homeland. He was notable for his activism for human and religious rights in Vietnam. 

In 1977, Quang wrote a letter to then-[[Prime Minister of Vietnam|Prime Minister]] [[Phạm Văn Đồng]] detailing counts of oppression by the communist regime. For this, he and five other senior monks were arrested and detained.&lt;ref name="hdvnbtdt.org"/&gt; In 1982, he was arrested and put on permanent house arrest for opposition to governmental policy after publicly denouncing the establishment of the state-controlled Vietnam Buddhist Church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/reuters/2008/07/06/asia/OUKWD-UK-VIETNAM-MONK.php ''International Herald Tribune'' article: "Dissident patriarch of Vietnam Buddhist group dies"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Newton's theory of gravitation]] and in various relativistic [[classical theories of gravitation]], such as [[general relativity]], the '''tidal tensor''' represents 
#''tidal accelerations'' of a cloud of (electrically neutral, nonspinning) [[test particle]]s,
#''tidal stresses'' in a small object immersed in an ambient gravitational field.

The tidal tensor represents the relative acceleration due to gravity of two test masses separated by an infinitesimal distance. The component &lt;math&gt;\Phi_{{a}{b}}&lt;/math&gt; represents the relative acceleration in the &lt;math&gt;\hat{a}&lt;/math&gt; direction produced a displacement in the &lt;math&gt;\hat{b}&lt;/math&gt; direction.

==Tidal tensor for a spherical body==
The most common example of tides is the tidal force around a spherical body (''e.g.'', a planet or a moon).
Here we compute the tidal tensor for the gravitational field outside an isolated spherically symmetric massive object.  According to Newton's gravitational law, the acceleration ''a'' at a distance ''r'' from a central mass ''m'' is 
:&lt;math&gt; a = -Gm/r^2&lt;/math&gt;
(to simplify the math, in the following derivations we use the convention of setting the [[gravitational constant]] G to one. To calculate the differential accelerations, the results are be multiplied by G.)

Let us adopt the [[frame field|frame]] in [[polar coordinates]] for our three-dimensional Euclidean space, and consider infinitesimal displacements in the radial and azimuthal directions, &lt;math&gt; \partial_r, \partial_\theta,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\partial_\phi&lt;/math&gt;, which are given the subscripts 1, 2, and 3 respectively.

:&lt;math&gt; \vec{\epsilon}_1 = \partial_r, \; \vec{\epsilon}_2 = \frac{1}{r} \, \partial_\theta, \; \vec{\epsilon}_3 = \frac{1}{r \sin \theta} \, \partial_\phi&lt;/math&gt;
We will directly compute each component of the tidal tensor, expressed in this frame.
First, compare the gravitational forces on two nearby objects lying on the same radial line at distances from the central body differing by a distance ''h'':
:&lt;math&gt; m/(r+h)^2 - m/r^2 = -2mh/r^3 + 3mh^2/r^4 + O(h^3) &lt;/math&gt;
Because in discussing tensors we are dealing with [[multilinear algebra]], we retain only first order terms, so &lt;math&gt;\Phi_{11} = -2m/r^3&lt;/math&gt;.  Since there is no acceleration in the &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; direction due to a displacement in the radial direction, the other radial terms are zero: &lt;math&gt;\Phi_{12} = \Phi_{13} = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarly, we can compare the gravitational force on two nearby observers lying at the same radius &lt;math&gt;r = r_0&lt;/math&gt; but displaced by an (infinitesimal) distance ''h'' in the &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; direction.  Using some elementary trigonometry and the small angle approximation, we find that the force vectors differ by a vector tangent to the sphere which has magnitude
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{m}{r_0^2} \, \sin(\theta) \approx \frac{m}{r_0^2} \, \frac{h}{r_0} = \frac{m}{r_0^3} \, h&lt;/math&gt;
By using the small angle approximation, we have ignored all terms of order &lt;math&gt;O(h^2)&lt;/math&gt;, so the tangential components are &lt;math&gt;\Phi_{22} = \Phi_{33} = m/r^3&lt;/math&gt;.  Again, since there is no acceleration in the radial direction due to displacements in either of the azimuthal directions, the other azimuthal terms are zero: &lt;math&gt;\Phi_{21} = \Phi_{31} = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Combining this information, we find that the tidal tensor is diagonal with frame components
&lt;math&gt;\Phi_{\hat{a}\hat{b}} = \frac{m}{r^3}\operatorname{diag}(-2,1,1)&lt;/math&gt;
This is the ''Coulomb form'' characteristic of spherically symmetric central force fields in Newtonian physics.

==Hessian formulation==
In the more general case where the mass is not a single spherically symmetric central object, the tidal tensor can be derived from the [[gravitational potential]] &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, which obeys the [[Poisson equation]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta U = 4 \pi \, \mu&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the mass density of any matter present, and where &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Laplace operator]].  Note that this equation implies that in a [[vacuum solution]], the potential is simply a [[harmonic function]].

The ''tidal tensor'' is given by the ''traceless part'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last= |first= |author-link= |arxiv=1201.4827 |title=Evidence for Quadratic Tidal Tensor Bias from the Halo Bispectrum |journal= Physical Review D|volume= 86|issue= 8|date=13 January 2018 |last1= Baldauf|first1= Tobias|last2= Seljak|first2= Uros|last3= Desjacques|first3= Vincent|last4= McDonald|first4= Patrick|doi= 10.1103/PhysRevD.86.083540|bibcode= 2012PhRvD..86h3540B}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_{ab} = J_{ab} - \frac{1}{3} \, {J^m}_m \, \eta_{ab}&lt;/math&gt;
of the [[Hessian matrix|Hessian]]
:&lt;math&gt; J_{ab} = \frac{\partial^2 U}{\partial x^a \, \partial x^b}&lt;/math&gt;
where we are using the standard ''Cartesian chart'' for E&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, with the Euclidean [[metric tensor]]
:&lt;math&gt; ds^2 = dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2, \; -\infty &lt; x,y,z &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;
Using standard results in vector calculus, this is readily converted to expressions valid in other coordinate charts, such as the ''polar spherical chart''
:&lt;math&gt; ds^2 = d\rho^2 + \rho^2 \, \left( d\theta^2 + \sin(\theta)^2 \, d\phi^2 \right) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; 0 &lt; \rho &lt; \infty, \; 0 &lt; \theta &lt; \pi, \; -\pi &lt; \phi &lt; \pi&lt;/math&gt;

===Spherically symmetric field===

As an example, we can calculate the tidal tensor for a spherical body using the Hessian.  Next, let us plug the gravitational potential &lt;math&gt;U = -m/\rho&lt;/math&gt; into the Hessian.  We can convert the expression above to one valid in polar spherical coordinates, or we can convert the potential to Cartesian coordinates before plugging in.  Adopting the second course, we have &lt;math&gt;U = -m/\sqrt(x^2+y^2+z^2)&lt;/math&gt;, which gives
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_{ab} = \frac{m}{(x^2+y^2+z^2)^{5/2}} \, \left[ \begin{matrix} y^2+z^2-2x^2 &amp; -3xy &amp; -3xz \\ -3xy &amp; x^2+z^2-2y^2 &amp; -3yz \\ -3xz &amp; -3yz &amp; x^2+y^2-2z^2 \end{matrix} \right] &lt;/math&gt;
After a rotation of our frame, which is adapted to the polar spherical coordinates, this expression agrees with our previous result.  (The easiest way to see this is probably to set y,z to zero so that the off-diagonal terms vanish and &lt;math&gt;\rho=x&lt;/math&gt;, and then invoke the spherical symmetry.)

'''Virtue ethics''' (or '''aretaic ethics'''&lt;ref&gt;David Carr, Jan Steutel (eds.), ''Virtue Ethics and Moral Education'', Routledge, 1999, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPAc-en|ˌ|ær|ə|ˈ|t|eɪ|.|ɪ|k}}, from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[wikt:ἀρετή|ἀρετή]] (''[[arete (moral virtue)|arete]]'')) are [[normative ethics|normative ethical]] theories which emphasize [[virtues]] of mind and character. Virtue ethicists discuss the nature and definition of [[virtues]] and other related problems. These include how virtues are acquired, how they are applied in various real life contexts, and whether they are rooted in a universal human nature or in a plurality of cultures.

== Key concepts ==
The western tradition's key concepts derive from [[ancient Greek philosophy]]. These theories include ''[[arete (moral virtue)|arete]]'' (excellence or virtue), ''[[phronesis]]'' (practical or moral wisdom), and ''[[eudaimonia]]'' (flourishing).

A virtue is generally agreed to be a character trait, such as a habitual action or settled sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2013/entries/ethics-virtue/|title=Virtue Ethics|last=Hursthouse|first=Rosalind|date=2013-01-01|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, a virtue is a positive trait that makes its possessor a good human being. A virtue is thus to be distinguished from single actions or feelings. [[Rosalind Hursthouse]] says:  &lt;blockquote&gt;A virtue such as honesty or generosity is not just a tendency to do what is honest or generous, nor is it to be helpfully specified as a “desirable” or “morally valuable” character trait. It is, indeed a character trait—that is, a disposition which is well entrenched in its possessor, something that, as we say “goes all the way down”, unlike a habit such as being a tea-drinker—but the disposition in question, far from being a single track disposition to do honest actions, or even honest actions for certain reasons, is multi-track. It is concerned with many other actions as well, with emotions and emotional reactions, choices, values, desires, perceptions, attitudes, interests, expectations and sensibilities. To possess a virtue is to be a certain sort of person with a certain complex mindset. (Hence the extreme recklessness of attributing a virtue on the basis of a single action.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;Practical wisdom is an acquired trait that enables its possessor to identify the thing to do in any given situation.&lt;ref&gt;Pincoffs, Edmund (1971). Quandary ethics. _Mind_ 80 (320):552-571.
&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike theoretical wisdom, practical reason results in action or decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2016/entries/aristotle-ethics/|title=Aristotle's Ethics|last=Kraut|first=Richard|date=2016-01-01|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Spring 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As John McDowell puts it, practical wisdom involves a "perceptual sensitivity" to what a situation requires.&lt;ref&gt;McDowell, John. "Virtue and Reason". _The Monist_. 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Eudaimonia]]'' (εὐδαιμονία) is a state variously translated from Greek as 'well-being', 'happiness', 'blessedness', and in the context of virtue ethics, 'human flourishing'.&lt;ref&gt;Pojman, L.P. &amp; Fieser, J. (2009). Virtue Theory. In ''Ethics: Discovering Right and Wrong'' (pp. 146-169). (6th ed.)  Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Eudaimonia'' in this sense is not a subjective, but an objective, state. It characterizes the well-lived life. According to Aristotle, the most prominent exponent of ''eudaimonia'' in the Western philosophical tradition, "eudaimonia" is the proper goal of human life. It consists of exercising the characteristic human quality—[[reason]]—as the soul's most proper and nourishing activity. In his ''Nicomachean Ethics'', Aristotle, like Plato before him, argued that the pursuit of ''eudaimonia'' is an "activity of the soul in accordance with perfect virtue",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aristotle|title=Nicomachean Ethics|pages=Book I}}&lt;/ref&gt; which further could only properly be exercised in the characteristic human community—the ''[[polis]]'' or [[city-state]].

Although ''eudaimonia'' was first popularized by Aristotle, it now belongs to the tradition of virtue theories generally. For the virtue theorist, ''eudaimonia'' describes that state achieved by the person who lives the proper human life, an outcome that can be reached by practicing the virtues.  A virtue is a habit or quality that allows the bearer to succeed at his, her, or its purpose. The virtue of a knife, for example, is sharpness; among the virtues of a racehorse is speed. Thus, to identify the virtues for human beings, one must have an account of what the human purpose is.

==History of virtue==
{{Catholic philosophy |expanded=all}}
Like much of the Western tradition, virtue theory seems to have originated in ancient [[Greek Philosophy|Greek philosophy]].

Virtue ethics began with [[Socrates]], and was subsequently developed further by [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and the [[Stoics]].&lt;ref&gt;P Gardiner - [http://jme.bmj.com/content/29/5/297 A virtue ethics approach to moral dilemmas in medicine] Journal of Medical Ethics / Volume 29, Issue 5 https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jme.29.5.297 Accessed November 24th, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Bowin -  [https://people.ucsc.edu/~jbowin/virtue.pdf Aristotle's Virtue Ethics] [[University of California, Santa Cruz |University of Santa Cruz (California)]] Accessed November 24th, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T. Chappell (2010) - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IiXfj1PCr9YC&amp;pg Plato: Oxford Bibliographies Online Research Guide] [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IiXfj1PCr9YC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=Virtue+ethics+began+with+Socrates&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWwdOl6dfXAhVK1xoKHfxgBnYQ6AEIPzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Virtue%20ethics%20began%20with%20Socrates&amp;f=false p.10] {{ISBN|019980902X}}  Accessed November 24th, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Virtue ethics refers to a collection of [[normative]] ethical philosophies that place an emphasis on being rather than doing.  Another way to say this is that in virtue ethics, morality stems from the identity or character of the individual, rather than being a reflection of the actions (or consequences thereof) of the individual.  Today, there is debate among various adherents of virtue ethics concerning what specific virtues are morally praiseworthy.  However, most theorists agree that morality comes as a result of intrinsic virtues. Intrinsic virtues are the common link that unites the disparate normative philosophies into the field known as virtue ethics. Plato and Aristotle's treatment of virtues are not the same. Plato believes virtue is effectively an end to be sought, for which a friend might be a useful means. Aristotle states that the virtues function more as means to safeguard human relations, particularly authentic friendship, without which one's quest for happiness is frustrated.

Discussion of what were known as the [[Four Cardinal Virtues]] – [[wisdom]], [[justice]], [[Cardinal virtues|fortitude]], and [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]] – can be found in Plato's ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''. The virtues also figure prominently in Aristotle's moral theory (see below). Virtue theory was inserted into the study of [[history]] by moralistic historians such as [[Livy]], [[Plutarch]], and [[Tacitus]].  The Greek idea of the virtues was passed on in Roman philosophy through [[Cicero]] and later incorporated into [[Christian]] moral theology by [[St. Ambrose]] of Milan. During the [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] period, the most comprehensive consideration of the virtues from a theological perspective was provided by St. [[Thomas Aquinas]] in his ''[[Summa Theologica|Summa Theologiae]]'' and his ''Commentaries on the [[Nicomachean Ethics]]''.

Though the tradition receded into the background of European philosophical thought in these centuries, the term "virtue" remained current during this period, and in fact appears prominently in the tradition of [[classical republicanism]] or [[classical liberalism]]. This tradition was prominent in the intellectual life of 16th-century [[Italy]], as well as 17th- and 18th-century Britain and America; indeed the term "virtue" appears frequently in the work of [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], [[David Hume]], the republicans of the [[English Civil War]] period, the 18th-century English [[British Whig Party|Whigs]], and the prominent figures among the [[Scottish Enlightenment]] and the [[Founding Fathers|American Founding Fathers]].

===Contemporary "aretaic turn"&lt;!--"Aretaic turn" redirects here--&gt;===
Although some [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophers (e.g. [[David Hume|Hume]]) continued to emphasise the virtues, with the ascendancy of [[utilitarianism]] and [[deontology]], virtue theory moved to the margins of Western philosophy. The contemporary revival of virtue theory is frequently traced to the philosopher [[G. E. M. Anscombe]]'s 1958 essay "[[Modern Moral Philosophy]]". Following this:
* In the 1976 paper "[[The Schizophrenia of Modern Ethical Theories]]", Michael Stocker summarises the main aretaic criticisms of deontological and consequentialist ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stocker | first1 = Michael | year = 1976 | title = The Schizophrenia of Modern Ethical Theories | url = | journal = The Journal of Philosophy | volume = 73 | issue = 14| pages = 453–466 | doi = 10.2307/2025782 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Philippa Foot]], who published a collection of essays in 1978 entitled ''Virtues and Vices.''
* [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] has made an effort to reconstruct a virtue-based theory in dialogue with the problems of modern and [[postmodernism|postmodern]] thought; his works include ''[[After Virtue]]'' and ''Three Rival Versions of Moral Enquiry''.
* [[Paul Ricoeur]] has accorded an important place to Aristotelian [[teleological ethics]] in his [[hermeneutical]] [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of the subject, most notably in his book ''Oneself as Another''.
* Theologian [[Stanley Hauerwas]] has also found the language of virtue quite helpful in his own project.
* [[Rosalind Hursthouse]] has published ''On Virtue Ethics''.
* [[Roger Crisp]] and [[Michael Slote]] have edited a collection of important essays titled ''Virtue Ethics''.
* [[Martha Nussbaum]] and [[Amartya Sen]] have employed virtue theory in theorising the [[capability approach]] to [[international development]].
* [[Julia Annas]] wrote ''The Morality of Happiness'' (1993).
* [[Lawrence C. Becker]] identified current virtue theory with [[Stoicism]] (or [[Modern Stoicism]]) in ''A New Stoicism.'' (1998).

The '''aretaic turn'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; in moral philosophy is paralleled by analogous developments in other philosophical disciplines. One of these is [[epistemology]], where a distinctive [[virtue epistemology]] has been developed by [[Linda Trinkaus Zagzebski|Linda Zagzebski]] and others. In political theory, there has been discussion of "virtue politics", and in legal theory, there is a small but growing body of literature on [[virtue jurisprudence]]. The aretaic turn also exists in [[United States of America|American]] [[constitutional theory]], where proponents argue for an emphasis on virtue and vice of constitutional [[adjudicator]]s.

Aretaic approaches to morality, epistemology, and jurisprudence have been the subject of intense debates. One criticism that is frequently made focuses on the problem of guidance; opponents, such as Robert Louden in his article "Some Vices of Virtue Ethics", question whether the idea of a virtuous moral actor, believer, or judge can provide the guidance necessary for action, belief formation, or the decision of legal disputes.

== Lists of virtues ==
There are several different lists of particular virtues. Socrates argued that virtue is knowledge, which suggests that there is really only one virtue.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, Meno.&lt;/ref&gt; The Stoics concurred, claiming the four cardinal virtues were only aspects of true virtue. John McDowell is a recent defender of this conception. He argues that virtue is a "perceptual capacity" to identify how one ought to act, and that all particular virtues are merely "specialized sensitivities" to a range of reasons for acting.&lt;ref&gt;McDowell, John. "Virtue and reason." ''The monist'' 62.3 (1979): 331-350.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Aristotle's list

Aristotle identifies approximately eighteen virtues that enable a person to perform their human function well.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Nicomachean Ethics.''&lt;/ref&gt;  He distinguished virtues pertaining to emotion and desire from those pertaining to the mind.&lt;ref&gt;Nicomachean Ethics, Book II.&lt;/ref&gt; The first he calls "moral" virtues, and the second intellectual virtues (though both are "moral" in the modern sense of the word).  Each moral virtue was a mean (see [[Golden mean (philosophy)|golden mean]]) between two corresponding vices, one of excess and one of deficiency. Each intellectual virtue is a mental skill or habit by which the mind arrives at truth, affirming what is or denying what is not.&lt;ref&gt;''Nicomachean Ethics'' Book VI&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Nicomachean Ethics'' he discusses about 11 moral virtues:

;Moral Virtues

1. '''Courage''' in the face of fear

2. '''Temperance''' in the face of pleasure and pain

3. '''Liberality''' with wealth and possessions

4. '''Magnificence''' with great wealth and possessions

5. '''Magnanimity''' with great honors

6. '''Proper ambition''' with normal honors

7. '''Truthfulness''' with self-expression

8. '''Wittiness''' in conversation

9. '''Friendliness''' in social conduct

10. '''Modesty''' in the face of shame or shamelessness

11. '''Righteous indignation''' in the face of injury

;Intellectual virtues
# [[Nous]] (intelligence), which apprehends fundamental truths (such as definitions, self-evident principles)
# [[Episteme]] (science), which is skill with inferential reasoning (such as proofs, syllogisms, demonstrations)
# Sophia (theoretical wisdom), which combines fundamental truths with valid, necessary inferences to reason well about unchanging truths.
Aristotle also mentions several other traits: 
* Gnome (good sense) -- passing judgment, "sympathetic understanding" 
* Synesis (understanding) -- comprehending what others say, does not issue commands
* [[Phronesis]] (practical wisdom) -- knowledge of what to do, knowledge of changing truths, issues commands
* Techne (art, craftsmanship)
Aristotle's list is not the only list, however. As [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] observed in ''[[After Virtue]]'',  thinkers as diverse as: [[Homer]]; the authors of the [[New Testament]]; [[Thomas Aquinas]]; and [[Benjamin Franklin]]; have all proposed lists.&lt;ref&gt;MacIntyre, ''After Virtue'', chp 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Some philosophers criticise virtue ethics as [[culturally relative]]. Since different people, cultures and societies often have different opinions on what constitutes a virtue, perhaps there is no one objectively right list.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

For example, regarding what are the most important virtues, Aristotle proposed the following nine: wisdom; prudence; justice; fortitude; courage; liberality; magnificence; magnanimity; temperance.  In contrast, one modern-era philosopher proposed as the four cardinal virtues:  ambition/humility;  love;  courage;  and honesty.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Kaufmann, W.]], 1961. The Faith Of A Heretic. Doubleday &amp; Co., pages 317-338.&lt;/ref&gt;

As another example, regarding virtues once supposedly applicable to women, many would have once considered a virtuous woman to be quiet, servile, and industrious. This conception of female virtue no longer holds true in many modern societies. Proponents of virtue theory sometimes respond to this objection by arguing that a central feature of a virtue is its ''universal applicability''. In other words, any character trait defined as a virtue must reasonably be universally regarded as a virtue for all sentient beings. According to this view, it is inconsistent to claim for example servility as a female virtue, while at the same time not proposing it as a male one.

Other proponents of virtue theory, notably [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], respond to this objection by arguing that any account of the virtues must indeed be generated out of the community in which those virtues are to be practiced: the very word ''ethics'' implies "[[ethos]]". That is to say that the virtues are, and necessarily must be, grounded in a particular time and place. What counts as virtue in 4th-century Athens would be a ludicrous guide to proper behavior in 21st-century Toronto, and vice versa. To take this view does not necessarily commit one to the argument that accounts of the virtues must therefore be static: moral activity—that is, attempts to contemplate and practice the virtues—can provide the cultural resources that allow people to change, albeit slowly, the ethos of their own societies. [[Alasdair MacIntyre|MacIntyre]] appears to take this position in his seminal work on virtue ethics, ''[[After Virtue]]''. One might cite (though [[Alasdair MacIntyre|MacIntyre]] does not) the rapid emergence of [[abolitionism|abolitionist]] thought in the [[slave]]-holding societies of the 18th-century [[Atlantic world]] as an example of this sort of change: over a relatively short period of time, perhaps 1760 to 1800, in Britain, France, and British America, slave-holding, previously thought to be morally neutral or even virtuous, rapidly became seen as vicious among wide swathes of society. While the emergence of abolitionist thought derived from many sources, the work of [[David Brion Davis]], among others,{{who|date=January 2011}} has established that one source was the rapid, internal evolution of moral theory among certain sectors of these societies, notably the [[Quakers]].

Another objection to virtue theory is that the school does not focus on what ''sorts of actions'' are morally permitted and which ones are not, but rather on what sort of qualities someone ought to foster in order to become a good person. In other words, while some virtue theorists may not condemn, for example, murder as an inherently immoral or impermissible sort of action, they may argue that someone who commits a murder is severely lacking in several important virtues, such as [[compassion]] and [[wikt:fairness|fairness]]. Still, antagonists of the theory often object that this particular feature of the theory makes virtue ethics useless as a universal norm of acceptable conduct suitable as a base for [[legislation]]. Some virtue theorists concede this point, but respond by opposing the very notion of legitimate legislative [[authority]] instead, effectively advocating some form of [[anarchism]] as the political ideal.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} Others argue that laws should be made by virtuous legislators. Still others argue that it is possible to base a judicial system on the moral notion of virtues rather than rules.

Some virtue theorists might respond to this overall objection with the notion of a "bad act" also being an act characteristic of [[vice]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} That is to say that those acts that do not aim at virtue, or stray from virtue, would constitute our conception of "bad behavior". Although not all virtue ethicists agree to this notion, this is one way the virtue ethicist can re-introduce the concept of the "morally impermissible".  One could raise objection with Foot that she is committing an [[argument from ignorance]] by postulating that what is not virtuous is unvirtuous.  In other words, just because an action or person 'lacks of evidence' for virtue does not, [[ceteris paribus|all else constant]], imply that said action or person is unvirtuous.

=== Subsumed in deontology and utilitarianism ===

[[Martha Nussbaum]] has suggested that while virtue ethics is often considered to be anti-[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], "suspicious of theory and respectful of the wisdom embodied in local practices",&lt;ref name="Nussbaum" /&gt; it is actually neither fundamentally distinct from, nor does it qualify as a rival approach to deontology and utilitarianism. She argues that philosophers from these two Enlightenment traditions often include theories of virtue. She pointed out that [[Immanuel Kant|Kant's]] "Doctrine of Virtue" (in ''[[The Metaphysics of Morals]]'') "covers most of the same topics as do classical Greek theories", "that he offers a general account of virtue, in terms of the strength of the will in overcoming wayward and selfish inclinations; that he offers detailed analyses of standard virtues such as courage and self-control, and of vices, such as avarice, mendacity, servility, and pride; that, although in general he portrays inclination as inimical to virtue, he also recognizes that sympathetic inclinations offer crucial support to virtue, and urges their deliberate cultivation."&lt;ref name="Nussbaum"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nussbaum|first=Martha C.|title=Virtue Ethics: A Misleading Category?|journal=The Journal of Ethics|year=1999|volume=3|issue=3|pages=163–201|jstor=25115613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nussbaum also points to considerations of virtue by utilitarians such as [[Henry Sidgwick]] (''[[The Methods of Ethics]]''), [[Jeremy Bentham]] (''[[The Principles of Morals and Legislation]]''), and [[John Stuart Mill]], who writes of moral development as part of an argument for the moral equality of women (''[[The Subjection of Women]]''). She argues that contemporary virtue ethicists such as [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], [[Bernard Williams]], [[Philippa Foot]], and [[John McDowell]] have few points of agreement, and that the common core of their work does not represent a break from Kant.

=== Utopianism and pluralism ===

[[Robert Louden]] criticises virtue ethics on the basis that it promotes a form of unsustainable [[utopianism]]. Trying to come to ''a'' single set of virtues is immensely difficult in contemporary societies as, according to Louden, they contain "more ethnic, religious, and class groups than did the moral community which Aristotle theorized about" with each of these groups having "not only its own interests but its own set of virtues as well". Louden notes in passing that MacIntyre, a supporter of virtue-based ethics, has grappled with this in ''[[After Virtue]]'' but that ethics cannot dispense with building rules around acts and rely only on discussing the moral character of persons.&lt;ref name="Louden"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Louden|first=Robert B.|title=On Some Vices of Virtue Ethics|journal=American Philosophical Quarterly|date=July 1984|volume=21|issue=3|pages=227–236|jstor=20014051}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Topics in virtue ethics ==

=== Virtue ethics as a category ===
Virtue ethics can be contrasted to [[deontological]] ethics and [[consequentialist]] ethics by an examination of the other two (the three being together the most predominant contemporary normative ethical theories).

[[Deontological ethics]], sometimes referred to as duty ethics, places the emphasis on adhering to ethical principles or duties.  How these duties are defined, however, is often a point of contention and debate in deontological ethics.  One of the predominant rule schemes utilized by deontologists is the [[Divine Command Theory]]. Deontology also depends upon meta-ethical [[Philosophical realism|realism]], in that it postulates the existence of [[moral absolute]]s that make an action moral, regardless of circumstances.  For more information on deontological ethics refer to the work of [[Immanuel Kant]].

The next predominant school of thought in normative ethics is [[consequentialism]].  While deontology places the emphasis on doing one's duty, which is established by some kind of moral imperative (in other words, the emphasis is on obedience to some higher moral absolute), consequentialism bases the morality of an action upon the consequences of the outcome.  Instead of saying that one has a moral duty to abstain from murder, a consequentialist would say that we should abstain from murder because it causes undesirable effects.  The main contention here is what outcomes should/can be identified as objectively desirable.  The [[Greatest Happiness Principle]] of [[John Stuart Mill]] is one of the most commonly adopted criteria.  Mill asserts that our determinant of the desirability of an action is the net amount of happiness it brings, the number of people it brings it to, and the duration of the happiness.  He also tries to delineate classes of happiness, some being preferable to others, but there is a great deal of difficulty in classifying such concepts.  
{{see|Utilitarianism|Utilitarianism (book)|On Liberty}}
Virtue ethics differs from both deontology consequentialism as it focuses on being over doing. A virtue ethicist identifies [[virtues]], desirable characteristics, that the moral or virtuous person embodies.  Possessing these virtues is what makes one moral, and one's actions are a mere reflection of one's inner morality.  To the virtue philosopher, action cannot be used as a demarcation of morality, because a virtue encompasses more than just a simple selection of action.  Instead, it is about a way of being that would cause the person exhibiting the virtue to make a certain "virtuous" choice consistently in each situation.  There is a great deal of disagreement within virtue ethics over what are virtues and what are not.  There are also difficulties in identifying what is the "virtuous" action to take in all circumstances, and how to define a virtue.

Consequentialist and deontological theories often still employ the term 'virtue', but in a restricted sense, namely as a tendency or disposition to adhere to the system's principles or rules.  These very different senses of what constitutes virtue, hidden behind the same word, are a potential source of confusion.  This disagreement over the meaning of virtue points to a larger conflict between virtue theory and its philosophical rivals.  A system of virtue theory is only intelligible if it is [[teleological]]: that is, if it includes an account of the purpose (''telos'') of human life, or in popular language, the [[meaning of life]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}  Obviously, strong claims about the purpose of human life, or of what the good life for human beings is, will be highly controversial.  Virtue theory's necessary commitment to a teleological account of human life thus puts the tradition in sharp tension with other dominant approaches to normative ethics, which, because they focus on actions, do not bear this burden.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Virtue ethics mainly deals with the honesty and morality of a person. It states that practicing good habits such as honesty, generosity makes a moral and virtuous person. It guides a person without specific rules for resolving the ethical complexity.

=== Virtue and politics ===
Virtue theory emphasises [[Aristotle]]'s belief in the [[polis]] as the acme of political organisation, and the role of the virtues in enabling human beings to flourish in that environment. Classical republicanism in contrast emphasises [[Tacitus]]' concern that power and luxury can corrupt individuals and destroy liberty, as Tacitus perceived in the transformation of the [[Roman Republic]] into the [[Roman Empire]]; virtue for classical republicans is a shield against this sort of corruption and a means to preserve the good life one has, rather than a means by which to achieve the good life one does not yet have. Another way to put the distinction between the two traditions is that virtue ethics relies on Aristotle's fundamental distinction between the human-being-as-he-is from the human-being-as-he-should-be, while classical republicanism relies on the Tacitean distinction of the human-being-as-he-is from the human-being-as-he-is-at-risk-of-becoming.&lt;ref&gt;J.G.A. Pocock, The Machiavellian Moment&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Applied virtue ethics ===
Virtue ethics has a number of contemporary applications.

;Social and political philosophy
Within the field of social ethics, [[Deirdre McCloskey]] argues that virtue ethics can provide a basis for a balanced approach to understanding capitalism and capitalist societies.&lt;ref&gt;McCloskey, D. ''The Bourgeois Virtues: Ethics for an Age of Commerce.'' (2007) Chicago: University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|978-0-226-55664-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Education
Within the field of [[philosophy of education]], [[James Page (Australian educationist)|James Page]] argues that virtue ethics can provide a rationale and foundation for [[peace education]].&lt;ref&gt;Page, James S. (2008) '' Peace Education: Exploring Ethical and Philosophical Foundations. '' Charlotte: Information Age Publishing. {{ISBN|978-1-59311-889-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

; Health care and medical ethics

[[Thomas Alured Faunce]] has argued that whistleblowing in the healthcare setting would be more respected within clinical governance pathways if it had a firmer academic foundation in virtue ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Faunce TA Developing and Teaching the Virtue-Ethics Foundations of Healthcare Whistle Blowing Monash Bioethics Review 2004; 23(4): 41-55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Faunce TA and Jefferys S. Whistleblowing and Scientific Misconduct: Renewing Legal and Virtue Ethics Foundations Journal of Medicine and Law 2007, 26 (3): 567-84&lt;/ref&gt; He called for whistleblowing to be expressly supported in the [[UNESCO]] Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;Faunce TA and Nasu H. Normative Foundations of Technology Transfer and Transnational Benefit Principles in the UNESCO Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human RightsJournal of Medicine and Philosophy, 0 : 1 – 26, 2009 {{doi|10.1093/jmp/jhp021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barry Schwartz argues that "practical wisdom" is an antidote to much of the inefficient and inhumane bureaucracy of modern health care systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/barry_schwartz_on_our_loss_of_wisdom?language=en|title=Our loss of wisdom|last=Schwartz|first=Barry|website=www.ted.com|access-date=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Technology and the virtues

In her book ''Technology and the Virtues'',&lt;ref&gt;https://global.oup.com/academic/product/technology-and-the-virtues-9780190498511?cc=ca&amp;lang=en&amp;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shannon Vallor]] proposed a series of 'technomoral' virtues that people need to cultivate in order to flourish in our socio-technological world: Honesty (Respecting Truth), Self-control (Becoming the Author of Our Desires), Humility (Knowing What We Do Not Know), Justice (Upholding Rightness), Courage (Intelligent Fear and Hope), Empathy (Compassionate Concern for Others), Care (Loving Service to Others), Civility (Making Common Cause), Flexibility (Skillful Adaptation to Change), Perspective (Holding on to the Moral Whole), and Magnanimity (Moral Leadership and Nobility of Spirit).

'''Women in Shakespeare''' is a topic within the especially general discussion of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s dramatic and poetic works. Main characters such as [[The Dark Lady#The Dark Lady|Dark Lady]] of the [[Shakespeare's sonnets|sonnets]] have elicited a substantial amount of criticism, which received added impetus during the [[second-wave feminism]] of the 1960s. A considerable number of book-length studies and academic articles investigate the topic, and several [[moons of Uranus]] are named after women in Shakespeare.

In Shakespeare's tragedies and his plays in general, there are several types of female characters. They influence other characters, but are also often underestimated. Women in Shakespearean plays have always had important roles, sometimes the leading role. Whether they are there to change the story or stabilize it, they are there for a reason. Some women are stronger than others, and their effect on the play is different for each one. They often surpass the male heroes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

== Historiography ==

=== 19th-century criticism ===

[[File:Characteristics of Women – Lady Macbeth.jpg|thumb|Depiction of Lady Macbeth from Anna Jameson's 1832 ''Characteristics of Women'']]
Early criticism of female characters in Shakespeare's drama focused on the positive attributes the dramatist bestows on them and often claimed that Shakespeare realistically captured the "essence" of femininity. [[Helen Zimmern]], in the preface to the English translation of Louis Lewes's study ''The Women of Shakespeare'', argued in 1895 that "of Shakespeare's ''dramatis personae'', his women are perhaps the most attractive, and also, in a sense, his most original creations, so different are they, as a whole, from the ideals of the feminine type prevalent in the literature of his day."&lt;ref&gt;

Lewes himself strikes a similar tone of praise in his conclusion: "The poet's magic wand has laid open the depths of woman's nature, wherein, beside lovely and exquisite emotion, terrible passions play their dangerous and fatal part."&lt;ref&gt;Lewes, ''The Women of Shakespeare'', 369.&lt;/ref&gt;

This early period of women in Shakespeare, which ends in the beginning of the twentieth century, is characterised by a very conventional tone and treatment and the confirmation of [[female submission]]. The editors of a 1983 collection called ''The Woman's Part'', referencing three books by women authors from the 19th century (an authoritative book, ''Shakespeare's Heroines: Characteristics of Women'' by [[Anna Brownell Jameson|Anna Jameson]], originally published 1832, and two fictional biographies in novel form of two of Shakespeare's heroines from 1885) conclude that these early critics are "uneasy" when Shakespeare's heroines behave "unwomanly", and that adaptations of their stories "praise girlish sweetness and modesty in a style that today appears effusive." These are, they say, "culturally induced limitations" on the part of the female critics and authors studying and adapting Shakespeare's women.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Modern criticism ===

Recent critics take a variety of approaches to the topic. For feminist critics influenced by [[Feminism#French feminism|French feminism]], the analysis of the female body in Shakespeare's plays has proven fruitful. Carol Chillington Rutter, author of ''Enter the Body: Women and Representation on Shakespeare's Stage'' (2001), focuses for instance on the body of Cordelia, as her father, [[King Lear]], carries her on to the stage; on the body of [[Ophelia (character)|Ophelia]] in the grave; and on the bodies of the two women on the bed at the end of ''[[Othello]]'', "a play that destroys women."&lt;ref&gt;

A '''zebu''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|z|iː|b|(|j|)|uː|,_|ˈ|z|eː|b|uː}}; ''Bos primigenius indicus'' or ''Bos indicus'' or ''Bos taurus indicus''), sometimes known as '''indicine cattle''' or '''humped cattle''', is a species or subspecies of domestic [[cattle]] originating in [[South Asia]]. Zebu are characterised by a fatty hump on their shoulders, a large [[dewlap]], and sometimes drooping ears. They are well adapted to withstanding high temperatures, and are farmed throughout the [[Tropics|tropical]] countries, both as pure zebu and as [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]s with [[taurine cattle]], the other main type of domestic cattle. Zebu are used as [[draught animal|draught]] and [[riding animal]]s,  [[dairy cattle]], and  [[beef cattle]], as well as for byproducts such as [[Hide (skin)|hide]]s and [[Feces|dung]] for [[fuel]] and [[manure]]. Zebu, namely [[Miniature Zebu]], are kept as [[companion animal]]s. In 1999, researchers at [[Texas A&amp;M University]] successfully cloned a zebu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/437391.stm |title=Cloning gives second chance for bull |date=1999-09-03 |work=BBC News |publisher=[[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]] |accessdate=2008-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy and name==
The scientific name of zebu cattle was originally ''Bos indicus'', but they are now more commonly classified within the [[species]] ''Bos taurus'' as ''B. t. indicus'', together with taurine cattle (''B. t. taurus'') and the [[Extinction|extinct]] ancestor of both of them, the [[aurochs]] (''B. t. primigenius'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mammal Species of the World: Information on taurus|url=http://www.departments.bucknell.edu/biology/resources/msw3/browse.asp?id=14200687|accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taurine ("European") cattle are descended from the Eurasian aurochs, while zebu are descended from the [[Indian aurochs]]. "Zebu" may be either singular or plural, but "zebus" is also an acceptable plural form. The [[Spanish language|Spanish]] name, ''cebu'' or ''cebú'', is also present in a few English works.

==Origin==
[[Image:Rampurva bull capital side.jpg|thumb|upright|An early representation of a zebu, on the [[Rampurva]] [[capital (architecture)|capital]] of the [[Pillars of Ashoka]], third century BC]]
Zebu cattle are thought to be derived from [[Indian aurochs]], sometimes regarded as a [[subspecies]], ''B. p. namadicus.''&lt;ref name="Vuure"&gt;{{cite book |author=van Vuure, Cis |year=2005 |title=Retracing the Aurochs: History, Morphology and Ecology of an Extinct Wild Ox |publisher=Pensoft Publishers |location=Sofia-Moscow |isbn=954-642-235-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wild Asian aurochs disappeared during the time of the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]] from its range in the [[Indus River]] basin and other parts of the South Asian region possibly due to interbreeding with domestic zebu and resultant fragmentation of wild populations due to loss of habitat.&lt;ref name="IWH2"&gt;{{cite book |author=Rangarajan, Mahesh |year=2001 |title=India's Wildlife History |page=4 |location=[[Delhi]], India |publisher=Permanent Black |isbn=978-81-7824-140-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeological evidence including pictures on pottery and rocks suggests that the species were present in Egypt around 2000 BC and were thought to be imported from the near east or south. ''Bos indicus'' is believed to have first appeared in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] between 700 and 1500 and was introduced to the [[Horn of Africa]] around 1000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 2743556|title = Rethinking the Role of Bos indicus in Sub-Sahara Africa|last = Marshall|first = Fiona|date = April 1989 |journal=[[Current Anthropology]] |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages= |doi = 10.1086/203737 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Breeds and hybrids==
[[File:Hariana_02.JPG|thumbnail|[[Haryanvi cattle|Hariana]] breed of Zebu cattle in north [[India]]]]
Some 75 breeds of zebu are known, split about evenly between African breeds and Indian ones. The major zebu cattle breeds of the world include [[Gyr cattle|Gyr]], [[Kankrej cattle and Guzerat cattle|Kankrej and Guzerat]], [[Indo-Brazilian cattle|Indo-Brazilian]], [[Brahman (cattle)|Brahman]],[[Cholistani (cattle)|Cholistani]], [[Nelore]], [[Ongole cattle|Ongole]], [[Sahiwal cattle|Sahiwal]], [[Red Sindhi cattle|Red Sindhi]], [[Butana and Kenana cattle|Butana and Kenana]], [[Boran cattle|Boran]], [[Baggara cattle|Baggara]], Tharparkar, [[Kangayam cattle|Kangayam]], [[Southern Yellow cattle|Southern Yellow]], Kedah-Kelantan, and Local Indian Dairy (LID). Kedah-Kelantan and LID originated from Malaysia. Other breeds of zebu are quite local, like the [[Haryanvi cattle|Hariana]] of [[Haryana]] and eastern [[Punjab, India|Punjab]]&lt;ref&gt;"Hariana — India: Haryana, eastern Punjab" page 245 ''In'' Porter, Valerie (1991) ''Cattle: A Handbook to the Breeds of the World'' Helm, London, {{ISBN|0-8160-2640-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Rath of [[Alwar district|Alwar]] in eastern [[Rajasthan]].&lt;ref&gt;"Rath — India: Alwar and eastern Rajasthan" page 246 ''In'' Porter, Valerie (1991) ''Cattle: A Handbook to the Breeds of the World'' Helm, London, {{ISBN|0-8160-2640-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The African [[sanga cattle]] breeds originated from hybridization of zebu with indigenous African humpless cattle; they include the [[Afrikaner cattle|Afrikaner]], [[Red Fulani cattle|Red Fulani]], [[Ankole-Watusi]], and many other breeds of central and southern Africa.  Sanga cattle can be distinguished from pure zebu by having smaller humps located farther forward on the animals.
[[File:Zébus de Madagascar 02.jpg|thumb|Zebu market in [[Madagascar]]]]

Zebu were imported to Africa over many hundreds of years, and interbred with [[taurine cattle]] there. Genetic analysis of African cattle has found higher concentrations of zebu genes all along the east coast of Africa, with especially pure cattle on the island of [[Madagascar]], either implying that the method of dispersal was cattle transported by ship or alternatively, the zebu may have reached East Africa via the coastal route (Pakistan, Iran, Southern Arabian coast) much earlier and crossed over to Madagascar. Partial resistance to [[rinderpest]] led to another increase in the frequency of zebu in Africa.

Zebu, which can tolerate extreme heat,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/07/food-ark/cattle-breeds#/1 |title=Food Ark - Cattle Breeds - Pictures, More From National Geographic Magazine |publisher=Ngm.nationalgeographic.com |date=2013-04-25 |accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; were imported into [[Brazil]] in the early 20th century and crossbred with [[Charolais cattle]], a European taurine breed. The resulting breed, 63% Charolais and 37% zebu, is called the [[Canchim]]. It has a better meat quality than the zebu and better heat resistance than European cattle. The zebu breeds used were primarily Indo-Brazilian with some Nelore and Guzerat.

Many breeds are complex mixtures of the zebu and various taurine types, and some also have [[yak]], [[gaur]], or [[banteng]] genes.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Zebu are very common in much of Asia, including China, India, Nepal, and almost all countries in Southeast Asia. In Asia, taurine cattle are only found in the northern regions such as [[Japan]], [[Korea]], and [[Mongolia]], possibly domesticated separately from the other taurine cattle originating from Europe and Africa).  Other species of cattle domesticated in parts of Asia include yak, gaur, banteng, and [[water buffalo]].

[[Hanwoo]] is a traditional Korean taurine–zebu hybrid breed.

==Characteristics==
Zebu have humps on the shoulders, large dewlaps, and droopy ears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?zebu|publisher=Online Medical Dictionary|accessdate=2007-09-08|title=Definition: Zebu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to taurine cattle, zebus are well adapted to the hot, dry environment of the tropics. Adaptations include resistance to drought and tolerance of intense heat and sunlight.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Review of a Reproductive Performance of Female Bos Indicus (zebu) Cattle|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=mR7422SxIw4C|publisher = ILRI (aka ILCA and ILRAD)|date = 1989-01-01|isbn = 9789290530992|first = E.|last = Mukasa-Mugerwa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reproduction==
Zebu are generally mature enough to begin reproducing around 44 months old. This is based on the development of their bodies to withstand the strain of carrying and lactation. Early reproduction can place too much stress on the body and possibly shorten lifespans. Carrying time of the calf averages at 285 days, but varies depending on the age and nutrition of the mother. The sex of the calf may also affect the carrying time, as male calves are carried for a shorter period than females. Location, breed, body weight, and season affect the overall health of the animal and in return may also affect the carrying period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = ILCA Monograph No. 6|last = Mukasa-Mugerwa|first = E.|publisher = ILCA|year = 1989|isbn = |location = Addis Ababa, Ethiopia|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
[[File:India.Mumbai.04.jpg|thumb|Draft zebu pulling a cart in [[Mumbai]], India]]
[[File:Female zebu cattle.JPG|thumbnail|Female zebu in Sri Lanka]]
Zebu are used as [[draught animal|draught]] and [[riding animal]]s, [[dairy cattle]], as well as for byproducts such as hides, [[Feces|dung]] for [[fuel]] and [[manure]], and bone for knife handles and the like. Zebu, mostly [[Miniature Zebu|miniature zebu]], are kept as [[pet]]s. {{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

''B. t. indicus'' cows commonly have low production of milk. They do not produce milk until maturation later in their lives and do not produce much, giving it solely to their calves. When ''B. t. indicus'' is crossed with ''B. t. taurus,'' production generally increases.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Genetic analysis has shown that the αS1 gene is most likely to have originated in ''B. t. indicus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2052.2009.01861.x | volume=40 | issue=4 | title=Characterization and genetic analysis of bovine αs1-caseinIvariant | journal=Animal Genetics | pages=479–485 | last1 = Lühken | first1 = G.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
