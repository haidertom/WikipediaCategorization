'''AMAX''' is an [[United States|American]] certification program developed by the [[Electronic Industries Association]] (EIA) and the [[National Association of Broadcasters]] (NAB) in 1993.  This quality control program addressed both consumer receiver developments and air chains of broadcast [[AM broadcasting|AM]] [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] stations. [[Tuner (radio)|Tuners]] and [[radio receiver|receivers]] offering AMAX Stereo were designed to capture the widest audio [[frequency response]] and [[stereophonic sound|stereo]] separation of [[AM stereo]] broadcasts, where available.

==Prerequisites==
AMAX Stereo products are not widely available to the public.  To qualify for AMAX  certification, the [[Amplitude Modulation|AM]] receivers must have the following features:

* They must have wide audio [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]]: 7,500 [[hertz]] for home and automotive applications and 6,500 hertz for portable radios.
* They must have some form of bandwidth control, either manual or automatic, including at least two bandwidth provisions, such as "[[narrowband|narrow]]" and "[[wideband|wide]]".
* They must meet receiver standards for low total harmonic distortion and proper [[National Radio Systems Committee|NRSC]]-1 audio de-emphasis curve.
* They must [[attenuate]] the inter-station high frequency 10,000 hertz "whistle" sounds.
* They must have provisions for an external AM antenna connection.
* They must be capable of tuning the expanded AM band (up to 1,700&amp;nbsp;kHz).
* They must meet [[National Radio Systems Committee|NRSC]]-1 receiver standards for audio distortion and audio [[de-emphasis]].
* Home and automotive receivers must have effective [[noise blanker|noise blanking]].

An effective noise blanker is new to home audio products.  This AMAX feature actively reduces the noise and interference encountered from monaural and [[AM stereo|stereo AM]] stations during degraded reception conditions, such as during a localized lightning storm.  A wide range of noises are successfully suppressed and the resulting audio seems almost clean until the noise is so intense, that the blanking approaches full-time.  [[Motorola]] says that this is believed to be the most effective noise blanking yet offered within the consumer market.

According to the EIA and National Association of Broadcasters, tuners and receivers that are qualified to carry the AMAX stereo certification logo will capture the widest audio frequency response and highest quality stereo separation of AM stereo broadcasts that modern technology can offer.  In addition, AMAX tuners and receivers will capture all of the [[fidelity]] transmitted from monaural AM stations.  Its audio response is more than two octaves greater than a standard AM radio.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8948">'''Artificial imagination''', also called synthetic imagination or machine imagination, is defined as the artificial simulation of [[human]] [[imagination]] by general or special purpose [[computers]] or [[artificial neural networks]].

The term artificial imagination is also used to describe a property of [[machines]] or [[Computer program|programs]]. Some of the traits that researchers hope to simulate include [[creativity]], vision, [[digital art]], [[humor]], and [[satire]].

Artificial imagination research uses tools and insights from many fields, including [[computer science]], [[rhetoric]], [[psychology]], [[creative arts]], [[philosophy]], [[neuroscience]], [[affective computing]], [[Artificial Intelligence]], [[cognitive science]], [[computational linguistics|linguistics]], [[operations research]], [[creative writing]], [[probability]] and [[logic]].

Practitioners in the field are researching various aspects of Artificial imagination, such as Artificial ([[visual]]) imagination,&lt;ref&gt;''Visual Information Retrieval Using Synthesized Imagery'' http://portal.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=1282303&amp;type=pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
Artificial ([[aural]]) Imagination,&lt;ref&gt;''AUDIO CONTENT TRANSMISSION'' by Xavier Amatriain &amp; Perfecto Herrera, {{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; modeling/filtering content based on human emotions  and  Interactive Search. Some articles on the topic speculate on how artificial imagination may evolve to create an [[artificial world]] "people may be comfortable enough to escape from the real world".&lt;ref&gt;''Hypertext and “the Hyperreal”'' by Stuart Moulthrop, [[Yale University]] http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=74224.74246&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[researchers]] such as G. Schleis and M. Rizki have focused on using artificial [[neural networks]] to simulate artificial imagination.&lt;ref&gt;''Learning from a random player using the reference neuron model'' in the ''Proceedings of the 2002 Congress on 
Evolutionary Computation, 2002.'' http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1007019&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important project is being led by Hiroharu Kato and Tatsuya Harada at the University of Tokyo in Japan. They have developed a computer capable of translating a description of an object into an image, which could be the easiest way to define what imagination is. Their idea is based on the concept of an image as a series of pixels divided into short sequences that correspond to a specific part of an image. The scientists call this sequences “visual words” and those can be interpreted by the machine using statistical distribution to read an create an image of an object the machine has not encountered.

The topic of artificial imagination has gotten interest from scholars outside the computer science domain, such as noted communications scholar [[Ernest Bormann]], who came up with the [[Symbolic Convergence Theory]] and worked on a project to develop artificial imagination in computer systems.&lt;ref&gt;''Twentieth-Century Roots of Rhetorical 
Studies'', by Jim A. Kuypers and Andrew King, 2001. published by Praeger/Greenwood, page 225.&lt;/ref&gt; An interdisciplinary research seminar on artificial imagination and [[postdigital]] art has been taking place since 2017 at the [[Ecole Normale Supérieure]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;''Postdigital Artificial Imagination''http://postdigital.ens.fr&lt;/ref&gt;

''How to Build a Mind: Toward Machines with Imagination'' by [[Igor Aleksander]] is an academic book on the topic; ''Artificial Imagination'',&lt;ref&gt;''Artificial Imagination'' https://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Imagination-Special-Photostory-Washington/dp/098147621X&lt;/ref&gt; a roman à clef, is a non-academic book supposedly written by an Artificial imagination system.

== Typical artificial imagination ==

The typical application of artificial imagination is for an interactive search. Interactive searching has been developed since the mid-1990s, accompanied by the World Wide Web's development and the optimization of search engines. Based on the first query and feedback from a user, the databases to be searched are reorganized to improve the searching results.

''How artificial imagination can contribute to interactive search''

Artificial imagination allows us to synthesize images and to develop a new image, whether it is in the database, regardless its existence in the real world. For example, the computer shows results that are based on the answer from the initial query. The user selects several relevant images, and then the technology analyzes these selections and reorganizes the images'  ranks to fit the query. In this process, artificial imagination is used to synthesize the selected images and to improve the searching result with additional relevant synthesized images. This technique is based on several algorithms, including the [[Rocchio algorithm]] and the [[evolutionary algorithm]]. The ''Rocchio algorithm'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dalton, Gerard,|first=Buckley, Chris|date=June 1, 1990|title=Improving retrieval performance by relevance feedback|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199006)41:4&lt;288::AID-ASI8&gt;3.0.CO;2-H/abstract|journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science|volume=41|issue=4|pages=288–297|via=|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199006)41:4&lt;288::AID-ASI8&gt;3.0.CO;2-H}}&lt;/ref&gt; locating a query point near relevant examples and far away from irrelevant examples, is simple and works well in a small system where the databases are arranged in certain ranks. The ''evolutionary synthesis'' is composed of two steps: a standard algorithm and an enhancement of the standard algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=December 2008|title=Using an artificial imagination for texture retrieval|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.330.1562&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|journal=2008 19th International Conference on Pattern Recognition|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Artificial Imagination for Interactive Search|last=|first=|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=19–28|quote=|via=|url=http://press.liacs.nl/publications/An%20artificial%20imagination%20for%20interactive%20search.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through feedback from the user, there would be additional images synthesized so as to be suited to what the user is looking for.

== General artificial imagination ==
Artificial imagination has a more general definition and wide applications. The traditional fields of artificial imagination include visual imagination and aural imagination. More generally, all the actions to form ideas, images and concepts can be linked to imagination. Thus, artificial imagination means more than only generating graphs. For example, moral imagination is an important research subfield of artificial imagination, although classification of artificial imagination is difficult.&amp;nbsp;

Morals are an important part to human beings' logic, while artificial morals are important in artificial imagination and artificial intelligence. A common criticism of artificial intelligence is whether human beings should take responsibility for machines‘ mistakes or decisions and how to develop well-behaved machines. As nobody can give a clear description of the best moral rules, it is impossible to create machines with commonly accepted moral rules. However, recent research about artificial morals circumvent the definition of moral. Instead, machine learning methods are applied to train machines to imitate human morals. As the data about moral decisions from thousands of different people are considered, the trained moral model can reflect widely accepted rules.&amp;nbsp;

Memory is another big field of artificial imagination. Researchers like [[Aude Oliva]] have performed extensive work on artificial memory, especially visual memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/105/38/14325.short|title=Visual long-term memory has a massive storage capacity for object details|last=Oliva|first=Aude|date=|access-date=|doi=10.1073/pnas.0803390105|volume=105|issue=38|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|pages=14325–14329|year=2008|bibcode=2008PNAS..10514325B|pmc=2533687}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to visual imagination, the visual memory focuses more on how machine understand, analyse and store pictures in a human way. In addition, characters like spatial features are also considered. As this field is based on the brains' biological structures, extensive research on neuroscience has also been performed, which makes it a large intersection between biology and computer science.

Community '''assembly rules''' are a set of controversial rules in [[ecology]], first proposed by [[Jared Diamond]].&lt;ref name="Diamond1975"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ecology and Evolution of Communities |editor=Cody ML, Diamond JM |publisher=Belknap Press, [[Harvard University Press]] |location=Cambridge, MA |year=1975 |url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674224445 |pages=342&amp;ndash;444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==

The rules were developed after more than a decade of research into the avian assemblages on islands near [[New Guinea]]. The rules assert that competition is responsible for determining the patterns of assemblage composition.  Diamond's paper sparked nearly two decades worth of controversy in the literature, from the late seventies through the late nineties{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} and is considered a turning point in community ecology{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}. The disagreement continues to this day.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

===Rule 1: Forbidden species combinations===
The first rule is "forbidden species combinations". Diamond's hypothesis was that competition, not random immigration, was the main force structuring the species composition of islands.

So for example, the [[Bismarck black myzomela]] (''Myzomela pammelaena'') excludes the [[black sunbird]] (''Nectarinia sericea''). The Bismarck black myzomela lives on 23 of the 41 surveyed islands in the Bismarck Archipelago, but not on any of the 14 islands inhabited by the black sunbird. The two birds are about the same size, and both use their curved bills to sip nectar; Diamond argued that competition affects their distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Stokstad (2009) 'On the Origin of Ecological Structure', ''Science'' 2 Oct 2009 pp. 33&amp;ndash;35.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rule 2: Reduced niche overlap===

Case tested the assembly rule that species occurring together on islands should have less [[Ecological niche|niche]] overlap than random assemblages because they have undergone specialization.&lt;ref name="Ted1983"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Case |first=Ted |year=1983 |title=Niche overlap and the assembly of island lizard communities |jstor=3544102 |journal=Oikos |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=427&amp;ndash;433 |doi=10.2307/3544102}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His study measured niche overlap of lizards on 37 islands near [[Baja California]] and compared niche overlap to the median niche overlap of computer generated random species assemblages. Case found that 30 of the 37 islands had lower niche overlap than the random assemblages and that some of the competition is due to [[interspecific competition]].

==Testing==
Testing the assembly rules is a complex process that often uses computer simulations to compare experimental data with characteristics of random assemblages of species.  The rules are generally regarded as hypotheses that need to be tested on an individual basis, not as accepted conclusions.

==Alternative theory==

As a reaction to the assembly rules controversy, ecologist [[Stephen Hubbell]] proposed that the abundance and diversity of species in a community is determined mainly by random dispersal, speciation, and extinction. This came to be known as the [[unified neutral theory of biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Hubbell, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a [https://scholar.google.ca/scholar?start=0&amp;q=Banff+International+Research+Station&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,5 wide range of research publications] citing lectures, meetings and reports from BIRS.

== Research program ==

The Banff International Research Station hosts [http://www.birs.ca/programs/general-program-descriptions five types of meetings]:

# ''5-Day Workshops'': These make up the core program at BIRS, with up to 42 participants per workshop, 48 weeks per year. Some workshops have only 21 participants, and they share a week at BIRS, running concurrently.
# ''2-Day Workshops'': Weekend workshops, typically consisting of 25 people, and typically from the surrounding areas in [[Alberta]] and [[British Columbia]].
# ''Focused Research Groups'':  Up to 8 people from different institutions meet for 1–2 weeks, to work on a specific problem or finish up major projects.
# ''Research in Teams'':  2–4 people from different institutions meet for 1–2 weeks to concentrate on their research.
# ''Summer Schools and Training Camps'': instructional meetings for up to 40 students for up to 14 days.

The [http://www.birs.ca/events/2013/5-day-workshops core program of 5-day workshops] is created two years in advance. Every summer, BIRS issues a [http://www.birs.ca/announcements/2012-06-15/call-for-proposals-2014 Call for Proposals], soliciting applications for workshops from the global scientific community. Each year, it gets more competitive to get a space in the 48 available weeks at BIRS: 79 proposals were received for the 2003 program, and 168 were received for the 2014 program.&lt;ref name=2014Program&gt;{{cite web|title=The 2014 Scientific Program Announcement|url=http://www.birs.ca/announcements/2013-02-08/2014-scientific-program|publisher=BIRS Website|accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An extensive peer-review process by international experts culminates in the selection of the scientific program for a given year.&lt;ref name=2014Program /&gt;&lt;ref name=REVIEW&gt;{{cite web|title=The Review Process: Ensuring High Calibre Research|url=http://www.birs.ca/about/governance/scientific-management/review-process|publisher=BIRS Website|accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Summer schools and training camps must apply through the same process as 5-day workshops. An example of a summer school is the [http://www.birs.ca/events/2012/summer-schools/12ss012 International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) training camp], to prepare high school students for competing at the [http://www.imo-official.org/ IMO]. The other types of meetings are far less competitive, and may be applied for at any time, through the [https://www.birs.ca/proposals/ BIRS website].

== Meeting facilities ==

The Banff International Research Station occupies two buildings on the campus of the [[Banff Centre]], in [[Banff National Park]]. One of the buildings, Corbett Hall, is a residence building that provides bedrooms, a common lounge area, a small library, and space for small teams of people to work. The other building, TransCanada PipeLines Pavilion, hosts administrative offices, two lecture rooms, and a series of smaller rooms for break-out sessions and research teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Description of Facilities|url=http://www.birs.ca/facilities/description-of-facilities|publisher=BIRS Website|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As part of the Banff Centre campus, BIRS researchers have full access to all of its [http://www.banffcentre.ca/conferences/ amenities and services].

The idea behind this choice of location for a research facility is to create an atmosphere where scientists can remove themselves from day-to-day life, and immerse themselves in their research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Klarreich|first=Erica|journal=Nature|date=30 August 2001|issue=412|page=846|title=...as mathematicians beat retreat to Alberta|doi=10.1038/35091220|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v412/n6850/full/412846c0.html|accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Automated lecture capture ==

In 2012, the Banff International Research Station installed a fully automated [[lecture capture]] system.&lt;ref name=AVR&gt;{{cite web|title=Automated Video Recording|url=http://www.birs.ca/facilities/automated-video |publisher=BIRS Website|accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It provides [[Streaming media|live video streaming]] and [[video recording]] of the lectures that take place in its main lecture room. Video recordings are automatically posted on the [http://www.birs.ca/videos/ BIRS website] within a few minutes after a lecture ends. Use of the system is opt-in, decided by the individual lecturers at the time of their lecture, via a [[touchscreen]] panel in the lecture room. The automated system at BIRS employs high quality cameras to ensure that mathematics written on chalkboards can be seen clearly. Embedded [[microphones]] and [[Audio signal processing|audio processing systems]] capture both the lecturer and questions from the audience.

Recent research videos recorded at BIRS are also available in the [https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/banff-international-research/id307566214 iTunes podcast directory].

McGraw Hill Higher Education, Boston, MA, USA. {{ISBN|978-0-07-325839-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It correctly explains the mechanism underlying the laws of [[Mendelian inheritance]] by identifying chromosomes with the paired [[allele|factors]] (particles) required by Mendel's laws. It also states that chromosomes are linear structures with [[gene]]s located at specific sites called [[Locus (genetics)|loci]] along them.&lt;ref name=holmgren/&gt;

It states simply that chromosomes, which are seen in all dividing cells and pass from one generation to the next, are the basis for all genetic inheritance.
Over a period of time random mutation
creates changes in the DNA sequence of a gene. Genes are located on chromosomes.

The chromosome theory of inheritance is credited to papers by [[Walter Sutton]] in 1902&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, W.S. (1902).
 [http://www.biolbull.org/cgi/reprint/4/1/24 On the morphology of the chromosome group in ''Brachystola magna.''] Biol. Bull. 4: 24-39.&lt;/ref&gt; and 1903,&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, W.S. (1903).

Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, pp. 27-41.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to independent work by [[Theodor Boveri]] during roughly the same period.&lt;ref&gt;Boveri, T.H. (1904). Ergebnisse über die Konstitution der chromatischen Substanz des Zelkerns. Fisher, Jena.&lt;/ref&gt; Boveri was studying [[sea urchin]]s, in which he found that all the chromosomes had to be present for proper [[embryonic development]] to take place. Sutton's work with [[grasshopper]]s showed that chromosomes occur in matched pairs of maternal and paternal chromosomes which separate during meiosis and "may constitute the physical basis of the Mendelian law of heredity".&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, W.S. (1902), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

This groundbreaking work led [[Edmund Beecher Wilson|E.B. Wilson]] in his classic text to name the chromosome theory of inheritance the "Sutton-Boveri Theory".&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, E.B. (1925). ''The Cell in Development and Heredity'', 3rd edition. Macmillan, New York. p. 923.&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson was close to both men, since the young Sutton was his student and the prominent Boveri was his friend (in fact, Wilson dedicated the afore-mentioned book to Boveri). Although the naming precedence is now often reversed to "Boveri-Sutton", there are some who argue that Boveri didn't actually articulate the theory until 1904.&lt;ref&gt;Martins, L.A.-C.P. (1999). [http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=s1415-47571999000200022&amp;script=sci_arttext Did Sutton and Boveri propose the so-called Sutton-Boveri chromosome hypothesis?] Genet. Mol. Biol. [online]. Vol.22, n.2, pp. 261-272 [Retrieved 2011-03-03].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Verification==
The proposal that chromosomes carried the factors of Mendelian inheritance was initially controversial, but in 1913 it gained strong support when [[Eleanor Carothers]] documented definitive evidence of [[independent assortment]] of chromosomes in a species of grasshopper.&lt;ref&gt;Crow, E.W. and Crow, J. F.  [http://www.genetics.org/cgi/content/full/160/1/1 100 Years Ago: Walter Sutton and the Chromosome Theory of Heredity] ''Genetics,'' Vol. 160, 1-4, January 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  Debate continued, however, until 1915 when [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]]'s work on inheritance and [[genetic linkage]] in the fruit fly ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' provided incontrovertible evidence for the proposal.&lt;ref name=GNN/&gt;&lt;ref name=mader/&gt; The unifying theory stated that inheritance patterns may be generally explained by assuming that genes are located in specific sites on chromosomes.

The gas can be [[natural gas]] (which is mainly [[methane]]) or a [[liquefied petroleum gas]], such as [[propane]], [[butane]], or a mixture of both.

== History ==
In 1852 the University of Heidelberg hired Bunsen and promised him a new laboratory building.  The city of Heidelberg had begun to install [[coal-gas]] street lighting, and so the university laid gas lines to the new laboratory.

The designers of the building intended to use the gas not just for illumination, but also in burners for laboratory operations.  For any burner lamp, it was desirable to maximize the temperature and minimize luminosity.  However, existing laboratory burner lamps left much to be desired not just in terms of the heat of the flame, but also regarding economy and simplicity.

While the building was still under construction in late 1854, Bunsen suggested certain design principles to the university's mechanic, [[Peter Desaga]], and asked him to construct a prototype. Similar principles had been used in an earlier burner design by [[Michael Faraday]], as well as in a device patented in 1856 by the gas engineer R. W. Elsner. The Bunsen/Desaga design succeeded in generating a hot, sootless, non-luminous flame by mixing the gas with air in a controlled fashion before combustion.  Desaga created adjustable slits for air at the bottom of the cylindrical burner, with the flame igniting at the top.  By the time the building opened early in 1855 Desaga had made 50 burners for Bunsen's students.  Two years later Bunsen published a description, and many of his colleagues soon adopted the design.  Bunsen burners are now used in laboratories all around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Ihde, Aaron John | title = The development of modern chemistry| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=34KwmkU4LG0C&amp;pg=PA233| date = 1984| publisher = Courier Dover Publications| isbn = 978-0-486-64235-2| pages = 233–236 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
[[File:Bunsen_burner_flame_types.jpg|thumb|left|Bunsen burner flames depend on air flow in the throat holes (on the burner side, not the needle valve for gas flow): 1. air hole closed (safety flame used for lighting or default), 2. air hole slightly open, 3. air hole half-open, 4. air hole fully open (roaring blue flame).]]
The device in use today safely burns a continuous stream of a flammable [[gas]] such as [[natural gas]] (which is principally [[methane]]) or a [[liquefied petroleum gas]] such as [[propane]], [[butane]], or a mixture of both.

The hose barb is connected to a gas nozzle on the laboratory bench with rubber tubing.  Most laboratory benches are equipped with multiple gas nozzles connected to a central gas source, as well as vacuum, [[nitrogen]], and steam nozzles.  The gas then flows up through the base through a small hole at the bottom of the barrel and is directed upward. There are open slots in the side of the tube bottom to admit air into the stream using the [[Venturi effect]], and the gas burns at the top of the tube once ignited by a flame or spark.  The most common methods of lighting the burner are using a [[match]] or a [[spark lighter]].

The amount of air mixed with the gas stream affects the completeness of the [[combustion]] reaction.  Less air yields an incomplete and thus cooler reaction, while a gas stream well mixed with air provides oxygen in a [[stoichiometric]] amount and thus a complete and hotter reaction.  The air flow can be controlled by opening or closing the slot openings at the base of the barrel, similar in function to the [[Choke valve|choke]] in a [[carburettor]].

[[File:Laboratory tripod with other lab equipments.jpg|thumb|A Bunsen burner situated below a [[Tripod (laboratory)|tripod]]]]
If the collar at the bottom of the tube is adjusted so more air can mix with the gas before combustion, the flame will burn hotter, appearing blue as a result.  If the holes are closed, the gas will only mix with ambient air at the point of combustion, that is, only after it has exited the tube at the top.  This reduced mixing produces an incomplete reaction, producing a cooler but brighter yellow, which is often called the "safety flame" or "[[luminous flame]]".  The yellow flame is [[luminosity|luminous]] due to small [[soot]] particles in the flame, which are heated to [[incandescence]]. The yellow flame is considered "dirty" because it leaves a layer of carbon on whatever it is heating.  When the burner is regulated to produce a hot, blue flame, it can be nearly invisible against some backgrounds. The hottest part of the flame is the tip of the inner flame, while the coolest is the whole inner flame. Increasing the amount of fuel gas flow through the tube by opening the [[needle valve]] will increase the size of the flame.  However, unless the airflow is adjusted as well, the flame temperature will decrease because an increased amount of gas is now mixed with the same amount of air, starving the flame of oxygen.

Generally, the burner is placed underneath a [[Tripod (laboratory)|laboratory tripod]], which supports a [[Beaker (glassware)|beaker]] or other container. The burner will often be placed on a suitable [[heatproof mat]] to protect the laboratory bench surface.

A Bunsen burner is also used in [[microbiology]] laboratories to sterilise pieces of equipment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chemistry.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/safety/sop/SOP_Spreading_Bacterial_Cultures.pdf |title=Spreading Liquid Cultures of Bacteria on Agar-Media Plates |publisher=chemistry.ucla.edu |accessdate=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to produce an updraft that forces airborne contaminants away from the working area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3941987/ |doi= 10.3791/2754 |title= Aseptic Laboratory Techniques: Volume Transfers with Serological Pipettes and Micropipettors |first=Erin R. |last=Sanders |journal=Journal of Visualized Experiments |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==
Other burners based on the same principle exist. The most important alternatives to the Bunsen burner are:
* [[Teclu burner]] – The lower part of its tube is conical, with a round screw nut below its base. The gap, set by the distance between the nut and the end of the tube, regulates the influx of the air in a way similar to the open slots of the Bunsen burner. The Teclu burner provides better mixing of air and fuel and can achieve higher flame temperatures than the Bunsen burner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title =  Ein neuer Laboratoriums-Brenner|first = Nicolae|last = Teclu|authorlink = Nicolae Teclu|journal = [[J. Prakt. Chem.]]|year = 1892|volume = 45|issue = 1|pages = 281–286|doi = 10.1002/prac.18920450127}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Partha, Mandal Pratim  |author2=Mandal, B.  |lastauthoramp=yes | title = A Text Book of Homoeopathic Pharmacy| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=u-y_sS546R8C&amp;pg=PA46| date = 2002-01-01| publisher = New Central Book Agency| location = Kolkata, India| isbn = 978-81-7381-009-1| page = 46 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Meker-Fisher burner|Meker burner]] – The lower part of its tube has more openings with larger total cross-section, admitting more air and facilitating better mixing of air and gas. The tube is wider and its top is covered with a wire grid. The grid separates the flame into an array of smaller flames with a common external envelope, and also prevents [[Oxy-fuel welding and cutting#Flashback|flashback]] to the bottom of the tube, which is a risk at high air-to-fuel ratios and limits the maximum rate of air intake in a conventional Bunsen burner. Flame temperatures of up to {{convert|1100|-|1200|°C|°F|-2}} are achievable if properly used. The flame also burns without noise, unlike the Bunsen or Teclu burners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zco6AAAAIAAJ|page=38|title=Domestic Science, Volume 2|first= Charles W. |last=Hale| publisher=Cambridge University Press|location= London|year= 1915}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tirrill burner]] – The base of the burner has a needle valve which allows the regulation of gas intake directly from the Burner, rather than from the gas source.  Maximum temperature of flame can reach 1560&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;Flinn scientific.  http://www.flinnsci.com/store/Scripts/prodView.asp?idproduct=14010&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''cambium''' (plural '''cambia''' or '''cambiums'''), in plants, is a tissue layer that provides partially undifferentiated [[plant cell|cell]]s for plant growth. It is found in the area between [[xylem]] and [[phloem]]. It forms parallel rows of cells, which result in secondary tissues.&lt;ref&gt;http://botanydictionary.org/cambium.html&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several distinct kinds of cambium found in plant stems and roots:

* [[Cork cambium]], a tissue found in many vascular plants as part of the [[periderm]].
* [[Unifacial cambium]], which ultimately produces cells to the interior of its cylinder.
* [[Vascular cambium]], a lateral [[meristem]] in the vascular tissue of plants.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13104">'''Channel 37''' is a purposefully unused [[UHF television broadcasting|ultra-high frequency (UHF) television broadcasting]] television channel in the United States, Canada and Mexico. The frequency range allocated to this channel is important for [[radio astronomy]], so broadcasting is not licensed.

==History==
Channel 37 in System M and N{{clarify|date=September 2018}} countries occupies a [[band (radio)|band]] of [[UHF]] frequencies from 608 to 614 [[Hertz|MHz]]. This band is particularly important to [[radio astronomy]] because it allows observation in a region of the spectrum in between the dedicated frequency allocations near 410&amp;nbsp;MHz and 1.4&amp;nbsp;GHz. The area reserved or unused differs from nation to nation and region to region (as for example the EU and British Isles have slightly different reserved frequency areas).

One radio astronomy application in this band is for [[very-long-baseline interferometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sites.nationalacademies.org/xpedio/groups/bpasite/documents/webpage/bpa_048869.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310090720/http://sites.nationalacademies.org/xpedio/groups/bpasite/documents/webpage/bpa_048869.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When UHF channels were being allocated in the United States in 1952, channel 37 was assigned to 18 communities across the country. One of them, [[Valdosta, Georgia]], featured the only [[construction permit]] ever issued for channel 37: WGOV-TV, owned by Eurith Dickenson "Dee" Rivers Jr., son of the [[Eurith D. Rivers|former governor of Georgia]] (hence the call letters). Rivers received the CP on February 26, 1953, but WGOV-TV never made it to the air; on October 28, 1955 they requested an allocation on channel 8, but the petition was denied.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uhftelevision.com/articles/channel37.html History of UHF television: Why Is There No Channel 37?]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) adopted a 10-year moratorium on any allocation of stations to Channel 37. A new ban on such stations took effect at the beginning of 1974, and was made permanent by a number of later FCC actions. As a result of this, and similar actions by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]], Channel 37 has never been used by any [[terrestrial television|over-the-air]] [[television station]] in Canada or the United States.

== Allocation issues ==
Reservations and use outside the US have a non-exclusive legal status
* The [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) enacted such a ban on Channel 37, but Radio Astronomy has no Exclusive Status on this channel.
* [[Mexico]] observes a similar ban on the use of this TV channel, but the allocation, like Canada's, is not exclusive. 
* Guatemala has a ban on Channel 37.
* Most [[NTSC]] System-M countries have an informal ban on Channel 37 as well, but don't give radio astronomy exclusive use of the channel.

Since July 2000, Channel 37 may be used in the US for medical [[telemetry]] equipment on a co-primary basis.{{clarify|date=September 2018}} This equipment must emit no more than one [[watt]] of [[effective radiated power]], and is for use in hospitals and other such facilities.
* The power level permitted by the FCC is many times more than the amount allowed for [[Title 47 CFR Part 15|Part 15]] [[Low-power broadcasting|unlicensed broadcasting]].
* In US areas set aside for radio-frequency silence, this equipment is banned by statute and regulation. 
* This seemingly low power level can be troublesome for radio astronomy equipment, which depends on detecting extraordinarily low [[signal strength]]s. Any use of the same frequencies raises the [[noise floor]], thereby decreasing the [[signal-to-noise ratio]], and making the work more difficult.

[[Channel 1 (NTSC-M)|Channel 1]] was also removed from the TV [[bandplan]] in the late 1940s, [[channel 70|channels 70]] to [[channel 83|83]] (800&amp;nbsp;MHz band) by the 1980s mainly for [[Advanced Mobile Phone System|AMPS]] [[mobile phone]]s and, in June 2009, channels 52 to 69 (700&amp;nbsp;MHz band) for [[mobile phone]]s, [[emergency service]]s and [[mobile TV]] services such as [[Qualcomm]]'s now-defunct [[MediaFLO]] (channel 55).  Additional channels from 38 to 51 (600&amp;nbsp;MHz band) are being taken away from TV broadcasters after [[FCC auction 1000]] ended in early 2017, which will leave channel 37 as a [[guard band]] between repacked TV stations and more mobile networks, for which [[T-Mobile USA]] won most of the licenses.

Certain channels, 14 through 20, are used for land mobile communications in some large metropolitan areas in the U.S.  However, facilities using this decades-old co-allocation are just treated as another station to avoid interference to in their local area.

The channels displayed by [[cable converter box]]es under these numbers are not on the same frequencies as their over-the-air counterparts; there are also [[virtual channel]] numbering schemes in use in [[digital television]] which do not map directly to fixed frequency channel assignments. As such, a "cable 37" channel may (and most often does) exist, but on a much lower frequency.

== Fictional usage ==
Channel 37 is sometimes seen in fiction, the same way [[telephone number]]s with the "[[555 (telephone number)|555]]" [[telephone exchange]] [[Telephone prefix|prefix]] are used.

Channel 37 has been used as a hypothetical example in instruction manuals, where it serves a role analogous to the fictitious [[example.com|example.org]] and [[example.com|example.net]] [[Internet domain]]s and the [[Reserved IP addresses|{{IPaddr|2001:db8}} IP address]].

== Outside North America ==

===In NTSC-M countries===
Outside North America, channel 37 is actively used in these countries where NTSC-M is used:
*In the [[Philippines]], Channel 37 was used by [[DWAO-TV|UNTV-37]] in Metro Manila as [[Progressive Broadcasting Corporation]]'s analog channel. However, its digital broadcast assignment is on Channel 38 (ISDB-T). It is used by [[DYCB-TV|ABS-CBN TV-3]] in Cebu City, Cebu as [[ABS-CBN]]'s digital channel (ISDB-T). However, its analog broadcasts primarily on Channel 3. It is used by [[DYAF-TV|ABS-CBN TV-10]] in Iloilo City, Iloilo as [[ABS-CBN]]'s digital channel (ISDB-T). However, its analog broadcasts primarily on Channel 10. Also used by [[DXMJ-TV|GMA TV-5]] in Davao as [[GMA Network]]'s digital channel (ISDB-T). However, its analog broadcasts primarily on Channel 5. 
* in [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[WIN TV (Trinidad and Tobago)|WIN-TV]] is broadcast on Channels 37 and 39, using [[NTSC]]
* In the [[Dominican Republic]] channel 37 is also used for the ''CDN'' news channel
* In [[South Korea]] [[KBS2|KBS 2TV]]'s Analog channel on gwanak-san Transmission station.(01.Jan.2012 04:00 closed.)

===In other countries===
In these other countries, the [[frequency allocation]] for these TV channels is different:
* in the UK (many [[transmitter]]s used by the [[Five (TV channel)|Five]] network actually broadcast on channel 37)
* in Western Europe, Channel 37 is used fairly widely as a relay transmitter frequency.
* In Malaysia, NTV7 broadcasts in PAL on CCIR Channel 37 (599.25&amp;nbsp;MHz)

Channel 37 is not the same frequency as it is in the countries using the System-M/N standard. At least in the UK, 606–614&amp;nbsp;MHz is reserved for radio astronomy.

The UK's namesake "Channel 37", while different in frequency, was formerly part of a small group of channels reserved for non-broadcast purposes such as [[RF modulator]]s in video players.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tinsleyviaduct.com/phil/channel5.html five analogue reception issues] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406124750/http://www.tinsleyviaduct.com/phil/channel5.html |date=April 6, 2008 }}, tinsleyviaduct.com&lt;/ref&gt; The UK-named 34-37 channel range is no longer reserved in this manner.

In Japan, [[Television channel frequencies#Japan 2|UHF television channel frequencies]] are offset by one channel compared to North American channel naming convention. Japan's channel 36 is in use by [[TV Asahi]] in some regions.

== Global UHF TV allocation table (605–615 MHz) ==
This Radio Astronomy Allocation is between the following wavelengths:
* 605&amp;nbsp;MHz = 0.49552 m = 49.55&amp;nbsp;cm
* 615&amp;nbsp;MHz = 0.48747 m = 48.75&amp;nbsp;cm
* Assume either a 100&amp;nbsp;kHz or a 250&amp;nbsp;kHz guardband with respect to this allocation.

== Legal note ==
As national (and ITU) frequency allocations can have multiple users (or no users at all) there should be some disambiguation as to what the various kinds of allocation schemes are
* ''No Allocation'' and ''Primary Status'' could be considered equivalent legal status. Very often the lack of allocation implies an internal regulatory coherence with ITU-R regulations freeing up this band for Astronomy.
* ''Assignment'' and ''Primary Status'' could be considered equivalent legal statuses as well.

[[File:Mount Storm Power Plant, Areial.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mount Storm Lake]] is a {{convert|1200|acre|km2}} cooling pond for a power plant in [[Grant County, West Virginia]].]]
A '''cooling pond''' is a man-made body of [[water]] primarily formed for the purpose storing heated water and/or supplying [[cooling water]] to a nearby [[power plant]] or industrial facility such as a [[petroleum refining|petroleum refinery]], [[pulp and paper mill]], [[chemical plant]], [[steel mill]] or [[smelter]].

==Overview==
Cooling ponds are used where sufficient land is available, as an alternative to [[cooling tower]]s or discharging of heated water to a nearby [[river]] or [[coastal waters|coastal bay]], a process known as “once-through cooling.” The latter process can cause [[thermal pollution]] of the receiving waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Environmental Science |last1=Mongillo |first1=John F. |last2=Zierdt-Warshaw |first2=Linda |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2000 |publisher=[[University of Rochester Press]] |location=Rochester, NY |isbn=978-1-57356-147-1 |page=93 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Water in Environmental Planning |last1=Dunne |first1=Thomas |last2=Leopold |first2=Luna B. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1978 |publisher=[[W.H. Freeman]] |location=New York |isbn=978-0-7167-0079-1 |page=722 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooling ponds are also sometimes used with [[HVAC|air conditioning systems]] in large buildings as an alternative to cooling towers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Basic Refrigeration and Air Conditioning |last=Ananthanarayanan |first=P.N. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2005 |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |location= |isbn=978-0-07-049500-5 |page=218 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pond receives [[thermal energy]] in the water from the plant’s [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condensers]] during the process of energy production and the thermal energy is then dissipated mainly through [[evaporation]].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Washington, D.C. (1970). [http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=9100H0DE.txt “An Engineering-Economic Study of Cooling Pond Performance.”] Document no. 16130DFX0570. Water Pollution Control Research Series. p.5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bengtson, Harlan (2010). [http://www.brighthub.com/engineering/mechanical/articles/64576.aspx “Steam Power Plant Condenser Cooling—Part 1: Introduction to Alternatives.”] brighthub.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Once the water has cooled in the pond, it is reused by the plant. New water is added to the system (“make-up” water) to replace the water lost through evaporation.

A 1970 cooling pond research study done by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] stated cooling ponds as having a lower overall electrical cost than [[Cooling tower|cooling towers]] while providing the same benefits. They also concluded that a cooling pond will work optimally within 5 degrees Fahrenheit of natural water temperature with an area encompassing approximately 4 acres per megawatt of dissipated thermal energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/springerreference_32156|work=SpringerReference|publisher=Springer-Verlag|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
Lake Anna is a cooling pond in Virginia, which provides cooling water for the North Anna Nuclear Generating Station. This pond has recreational uses such as  fishing, swimming, boating, camping, and picnicking as well as being a cooling pond for the nuclear plant. Chernobyl's cooling pond has abundant wildlife, despite the radiation present in the area. Some accounts of wels catfish ''(Silurus glanis)'' growing up to 350 pounds and having a lifespan of up to 50 years in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.earthtouchnews.com/wtf/wtf/yes-there-are-giant-catfish-in-chernobyls-cooling-pond-but-theyre-not-radiation-mutants/|title=Yes, there are giant catfish in Chernobyl's cooling pond – but they're not radiation mutants|work=Earth Touch News Network|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Columbia station in Pardeeville, Wisconsin is a coal fired power plant with a capacity of 1000 MW. A duel cooling system is used for heat rejection that consists of a cooling pond and two cooling towers. The pond and towers are connected in a parallel arrangement to help dissipate thermal energy at expedited rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Joerg |first=Kirchhoff |date=1995|title=Optimized Combination of a Cooling Pond and Cooling Tower System for Condenser Cooling at a Steam Cycle Power Plant |url=https://minds.wisconsin.edu/handle/1793/7801|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |

'''Cyber sovereignty''' is a phrase used in the field of internet governance to describe governments' desire to exercise control over the Internet within their own borders, including political, economic, cultural and technological activities. In his 2015 book ''[[Data and Goliath]]'', American security expert [[Bruce Schneier]] says the cyber sovereignty movement, in countries such as [[Russia]], [[China]], [[France]] and [[Saudi Arabia]], was given an enormous boost by the [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|2013 revelations of widespread international NSA surveillance]], which those countries pointed to as justification for their activities and evidence of U.S. hypocrisy on Internet freedom issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Data and Goliath: The Hidden Battles to Collect Your Data and Control Your World|last = Schneier|first = Bruce|publisher = W.W.

'''''Death by a Thousand Cuts''''' is a book by the historians [[Timothy Brook]] and Gregory Blue and scientific [[research]]er Jérôme Bourgon which examines the use of [[slow slicing]] or ''lingchi'', a form of [[torture]] and [[capital punishment]] practised in [[Mid-Imperial China|mid]]- and [[Late Imperial China|late-Imperial]] China from the tenth century until its abolition in 1905.&lt;ref name="HarvardBlurb"&gt;{{cite web

==Synopsis==
{{Expand section|date=January 2010}}
''Death by a Thousand Cuts'' investigates the use of [[slow slicing]] or ''lingchi'', a form of torture and capital punishment practised in mid- and late-Imperial China from the tenth century until its abolition in 1905.&lt;ref name="HarvardBlurb"/&gt; ''Lingchi'' involved repeatedly slicing the [[convict]]'s flesh beyond the point of death.&lt;ref name="TimesHigherEducation"&gt;{{cite web

By the time of the final imperial dynasty, the punishment could be meted out for an offence as simple as striking a teacher.&lt;ref name="TimesHigherEducation"/&gt;

The authors argue that this was more than a physical punishment, as the victim was [[Sedative|sedated]] with [[opium]] and killed early in the process, but about denying the victim "somatic integrity"&lt;ref name="NewYorker"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SomaticIntegrity"&gt;Somatic integrity: the vital capacity to be whole as an organism, which would be denied if the body were cut into pieces.&lt;/ref&gt; and denying them any hope of a [[Afterlife|life after death]] which, the authors argue, caused them to feel [[shame]].&lt;ref name="NewYorker"/&gt;

==Reception==
A staff reviewer at ''[[The New Yorker]]'' describes the book as a "fascinating study".&lt;ref name="NewYorker"/&gt;

A staff reviewer at ''[[The Times]]'' states that "the authors present a nuanced picture of state-imposed execution and, without at any time condoning, succeed in their goal of contextualising ''lingchi'' in relation to Western forms of punishment" and that "this challenging and important work will appeal not solely to [[Sinology|Sinologists]],&lt;ref name="Sinology"&gt;Sinology: the study of China  and things related to China.&lt;/ref&gt; but to [[Legal history|legal historians]] and students of visual representation."&lt;ref name="TimesHigherEducation"/&gt;

Jonathan Mirsky in ''[[Literary Review]]'' writes that "[the authors] write coolly and formally, but this is a book primarily about torment."&lt;ref name="LiteraryReview"&gt;{{cite web

'''Diploblasty''' is a condition of the [[blastula]] in which there are two primary [[germ layer]]s: the [[ectoderm]] and [[endoderm]].

Diploblastic organisms are organisms which develop from such a blastula, and include [[cnidaria]] and [[ctenophora]], formerly grouped together in the phylum Coelenterata, but later understanding of their differences resulted in their being placed in separate phyla.

The endoderm allows them to develop true [[Biological tissue|tissue]]. This includes tissue associated with the gut and associated glands. The ectoderm, on the other hand, gives rise to the epidermis, the nervous tissue, and if present, nephridia.

Simpler animals, such as [[sea sponges]], have one germ layer and lack true tissue organization.

All the more complex animals (from flat worms to humans) are [[triploblastic]] with three germ layers (a [[mesoderm]] as well as ectoderm and endoderm). The mesoderm allows them to develop true [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]].

Groups of diploblastic animals alive today include jellyfish, corals, sea anemones and comb jellies.

'''Eloquentia Perfecta,''' a tradition of the [[Society of Jesus]], is a value of Jesuit rhetoric that revolves around cultivating a person as a whole, as one learns to speak and write for the common good.

Steven Mallioux, a Professor of Rhetoric at [[Loyola Marymount University|LMU]], concluded that "an optimal orator would combine written and oral language concepts such as morality or ethics and intelligence." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mallioux|first=Steven|date=2013|title=A Good Person Speaking Well: Eloquentia Perfecta in U.S. Jesuit Colleges: A Brief Genealogy|url=|journal=Conversations on Jesuit Higher Education: Vol. 43, Article 6.|volume=|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept has expanded from education in Jesuit colleges and preaching this tradition and guiding [[Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola|Spiritual Exercises]] to courses in American Colleges such as [[Loyola Marymount University|Loyola Marymount University]], [[University of San Francisco]], and [[Fordham University]].

[[Loyola Marymount University|LMU]]'s core curriculum provides a few aspects that construct Eloquentia Perfecta, the first being that "It incorporates the traditional mode of rhetoric through writing, reading, speaking, and listening." The second aspect is, "The remediation of this form of rhetoric in terms of adapting to the information age and its digital elements." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lmu.edu/AssetFactory.aspx?did=65635|title=JESUIT RHETORICAL ARTS: ELOQUENTIA PERFECTA|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History  ==

=== Ancient History ===
In ancient Athens, they had a goal of "perfect eloquence" in their education system, which was long before the Jesuits existed.  They believed that speech had great power and could achieve many things with "perfect eloquence" way of speaking.  [[Isocrates]] taught the "art of word" in his school that he opened and continued with words are needed to express one's thoughts.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Malley|first=John W.|date=May 16, 2011|title=Eloquentia: a short history|url=|journal=America|publisher=America Press, Inc.|volume=204|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1500's ===
Jesuit education is believed by many Jesuits that the late sixteenth century's [[Ratio Studiorum]] was the founding document of Jesuit education. Under [[Ratio Studiorum]], "perfect eloquence" was renamed Eloquentia Perfecta.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Ratio was developed from an idea from [[Ignatius of Loyola]] vision of education which had a baseline of classical humanities with a Renaissance focus. In addition, there was some math and history. As students go up to higher education, there is an integration of the study of science, logic, philosophy, and theology. With each progressive year of education, the Jesuit values of Eloquentia Perfecta is integrated into the curriculum. The goals were not explicit but Eloquentia Perfecta are the ides of "developing an eloquent and mature. For example, when students gave speeches, they had to adapt to different audiences and be able to speak in a variety of styles to persuade the audience.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Changing Practice of Liberal Education and Rhetoric in Jesuit Education, 1600-2000|last=Leigh|first=David|publisher=Fordham University Press|year=2016|isbn=978-0-8232-6453-7|location=New York, NY|pages=125–137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1700's ===
As education of the eighteenth century arose, Jesuit education in France was revised with the addition of sciences, plays, speeches, and the discussion of philosophical ideas. Along with the revision, however, Jesuit education maintained the practices of lectures, critical thinking, public speaking, as well as challenging students with quizzes and exams.  The differences between traditional thinking and modern thinking provided a divide during changing times in the Enlightenment. The goal of education remained as the education aimed to strengthen the students communication skills with leadership skills, emotions, and eloquence. Students who attended Universities in the eighteenth century had the option of only getting a master's degree, however towards the end of the century, universities had incorporate BAs (Bachelor of Arts) and BSs (Bachelor of Science) degrees that students could get. If the student wanted to continue their education then they could get their master's as well.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== 1900's ===
American Jesuit liberal-arts-colleges in the mid-twentieth-century had a new major discipline incorporated into their educational system. In college, students would have to take two thirds of their college requirement credits on liberal education and the other third on their major. Before the twentieth century, students had to learn about classical core education, however, it has changed to a professional field which includes nursing, business, and education. Furthermore, there are still studies in rhetoric and logic that students are required to take involving speech and debate. In the education system, some teachers still use earlier Jesuit colleges methods where they provide lectures and exams while others use more recent methods like discussion and question-answer from students. Graduates from college during this time period say that the most crucial benefit they got out of their educational experience was that they "learned to think", which means integrating concepts from the old and new ideas in society in involving a person's mind and character.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Education  ==

=== Jesuit Rhetoric ===
In 1599, the [[Society of Jesus]] was presented with ''[[Ratio Studiorum]],'' which included Jesuit educational framework and rules for the professors of rhetoric.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Within this framework was the values of Eloquentia Perfecta which was, and continues to be, taught in Jesuit schools worldwide. These schools aim to promote Eloquentia Perfecta by educating their students into ideal [[orator]]s by incorporating critical thinking, civic responsibility, and ethics into a Jesuit rhetoric curriculum.

Gert Beista, the author of ''The Beautiful Risk of Education'', explains that there are three objectives to Jesuit rhetoric that focuses on, "reconnecting with the question of purpose in education." The first is that Jesuit rhetoric provides students with the knowledge, skills, and judgment that enables them to ‘‘do something’’ within their current society such as training for real-world issues with eloquence. The second of the three objectives is ''socialization'' where Beista states that, "Through education, we become members of and part of particular social, cultural and political orders." The last objective is what Beista likes to call, ''subjectification.'' This term is characterized to be the opposite of socialization, in which its emphasis is on individualization and independence in one's thinking and actions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mailloux|first=Steven|date=|title=Jesuit Eloquentia Perfecta and Theotropic Logology|url=|journal=Studies in Philosophy and Education|volume=34|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eloquentia Perfecta in Jesuit Colleges ===
Although Jesuit rhetoric promotes the study of Eloquentia Perfecta, by midcentury in the United States, Jesuit rhetorical studies differed little in comparison to rhetorical studies in non-Jesuit Schools. This is due to the similarity of the fundamental study of Aristotle, Cicero, and Quintilian. After the American Civil War, however, non-Jesuit colleges began to differ in the curriculum. This divergence was due to the molding of non-Jesuit schools by the elective system, while Jesuit colleges conserved classical courses involving Greek and Latin literature.

With the advancements of Jesuit rhetoric, Jesuit colleges introduced three important rhetorics written by Jesuits. These three rhetorics included ''Ars Dicendi'' by German Jesuit [[Joseph Kleutgen]], ''A Practical Introduction to English Rhetoric'', and ''The Art of Oratorical Composition'' both written by a Belgian-born Jesuit, [[Charles Coppen]]s. Coppens taught at multiple American Jesuit colleges including the Jesuit seminary [[St. Stanislaus Kostka Church (St. Louis, Missouri)|St. Stanislaus]] in Missouri. He defines the three terms rhetoric, oratory, and eloquence. Coppens states that rhetoric is, “the art of inventing, arranging, and expressing thought in a manner adapted to influence or control the minds and wills of others.” He defines oratory as, “the branch of rhetoric which expresses through orally.” Lastly, he defines eloquence as, “the expression or utterance of strong emotion in a manner adapted to excite correspondent emotions in others.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rhetorical Ways of Proceeding: Eloquentia Perfecta in American Jesuit Colleges|last=Mailloux|first=Steven|publisher=Fordham University Press|year=2016|isbn=9780823264520|location=United States of America|pages=162–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ignation Pedagogy ===
The [[Ignatius of Loyola]] created a document of the ''Spiritual Exercises,'' a sequence of meditations that have been utilized in universities. These spiritual practices have been around since the sixteenth century and have been more accessible to people around the world as it was published over 4,500 times. Jesuit Spiritual Exercises have been the groundwork of Ignation pedagogy, also known as the [[Ignatian Pedagogical Paradigm|Ignation pedagogical paradigm]]. Ignition pedagogy, which started in 1980's, is the discipline that cultivates a person's understanding, behavior, and contemplation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Unfinished Business of Eloquentia Perfecta in Twenty-First-Century Jesuit Higher Education|last=Gannett|first=Cinthia|publisher=Fordham University Press|year=2016|isbn=978-0-8232-6453-7|location=New York, New York|pages=277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Eloquentia Perfecta in Modern Times  ==

=== Adaptation to Rhetorical Changes in Eloquentia Perfecta ===
Many scholars might have the assumption that the original traditions of Eloquentia Perfecta have been erased in the later century, both through religious and academic teachings. However, though the term has been altered to fit modern society communication, the traditional teachings of the topic are very much alive.  Through both digital technology and verbal communication, Eloquentia Perfecta continues to carry on the original goal of rhetorical eloquence to spread justice to all. Many of the Jesuit scholars have had to really adapt to new medians of expression and constantly have to recreate lesson plans for students to adapt to current societal standards. As stated by Morgan T. Reitmeyer and Susan A. Sci in their article, How To Talk Ethically: Cultivating the Digital Citizen through Eloquentia Perfecta, "News is no longer something to simply consume; rather it is something to which we are compelled to respond within a wide array of media." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parmach|first=Robert J.|date=September 1, 2013|title=Talking Back: Eloquentia Perfecta: A Way of Proceeding|url=|journal=Article 24|volume=46|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As social justice has become a social phenomenon for current day societies, mainly because news is so easily accessible through digital devices, people are feeling more compelled to speak with Eloquentia Perfecta to portray their message.

=== Eloquentia Perfecta in the Digital Age ===
As many Jesuit-affiliated universities have created a required course for all incoming first year students to take on Eloquentia Perfecta, the goal of Eloquentia Perfecta teachings remain, which is to spread the oral and written justice to people all over. Our society's culture today is a place for people to share their voices publicly using all different types of technology. Many of the digital platforms (i.e. Snapchat, Twitter, and Instagram) allow people to integrate their personal insight and moral judgments to their followers. There are many famous people whom use their public voice on these platforms in society to relay eloquent, and justice messages to the public. Many of these messages relate to real-life issues within different cultures around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reitmeyer|first=Morgan T|last2=Sci|first2=Susan A.|date=March 1, 2013|title=How To Talk Ethically: Cultivating the Digital Citizen through Eloquentia Perfecta|url=|journal=Article 19|volume=43|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== People ===
One prime example of Eloquentia Perfecta, being  [[Jeannie Gaffigan]], a writer, actress, and Catholic comedian, was awarded the Inaugural Eloquentia Perfecta Award from Fordham’s Graduate School of Religion and Religious Education (GRE) and the Paulist Press in October 2016.  The award was given to Gaffigan because of her constant dedication to capturing the core significance of humanity.  As a public figure, and social activist, she shines light on the idea that humanity is full of flaws that must be addressed.  She bases her career on bringing people from all over the world together through skepticism, errors and uncertainty.  As she receives much of her inspiration through Catholic religion, one of her most inspirational quotes to live by is by St. Ignatius of Loyola, founder of Society of Jesus, which reads, “Love ought to manifest itself in deeds rather than in words,” and spreads this faith through her many social platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.fordham.edu/faith-and-service/catholic-comedian-jeannie-gaffigan-accepts-eloquentia-perfecta-award/|title=Catholic Comedian Jeannie Gaffigan Accepts Eloquentia Perfecta Award|work=Fordham Newsroom|access-date=2017-04-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eloquentia Perfecta and Other Rhetorical Phrases of Past and Modern Tradition ===
'''''"Eloquentia Perfecta."'''''

Eloquentia Perfecta is the most fundamental goal of all of these four practices listed below.  The perfect eloquence is achieved through literature of many different cultures, where one must first understand other cultural and rhetorical languages to master this practice.  These practices were all created in the early ages of Jesuit teachings, yet all still are related to modern day times. Eloquentia Perfecta is ultimately the only quality in which one must have to fulfill any sort of leadership role. Many believe that it is more important to have perfect eloquence in language and communication than it is to have any sore of technology-based skills in higher up positions in society.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O’Malley|first=John S.J|date=March 1, 2013|title="Not for Ourselves Alone:" Rhetorical Education in the Jesuit Mode With Five Bullet Points for Today|url=|journal=Article 4|volume=43|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''“The fly in the bottle.”'''''

This metaphor first came alive by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] in 1914.  It originally was used to help students get out of their comfort ones and expand their critical thinking skills by becoming exposed to different languages and cultures.  It have been adopted into modern day education where educators can push students to think about the questions of life that don't necessarily apply to their particular areas of skill.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''''“Heritage and Perspective.”'''''

"Heritage and Perspective" became a popular value in school, as it teaches past-recognition.  It is based on the idea that modern day citizens are formed by the past and must grasp the concept that the past is still relevant to today's world. Without the knowledge of the past it is hard to understand some of the current situations in which an individual in society might get caught up in.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''''“We are not born for ourselves alone.”'''''

[[Pedro Arrupe|Father Pedro Arrupe]] made the assertion that all students must become people of the world who help people to truly reach the fundamental goal of academic Jesuit teachings.  He meant this in a rhetorical and philosophical way and not only referred to pure Jesuit practice. Women and men should be serving others to truly reach the Jesuit-practice goals.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''''“The spirit of finesse.”'''''

This phrase became well known by [[Henri-Irénée Marrou|Henri Marrou]], as he dubbed it as the opposite of “geometric spirit.” This phrase is made to push its followers into a humane mentality.  It is meant to “weave webs with words that reflect the webs we weave with our lives, which are not neat geometric patterns but broken in places and filled with knots and tangles.” &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Epigenetic theories of homosexuality''' concern the studies of changes in [[gene expression]] or cellular [[phenotype]] caused by mechanisms other than changes in the underlying [[DNA sequence]], and their role in the development of [[homosexuality]].&lt;ref name="Friberg"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Rice WR, Friberg U, Gavrilets S. 2013. Homosexuality via canalized sexual development: A testing protocol for a new epigenetic model. BioEssays 35: 343-368 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Rice W. R., Friberg U., and Gavrilets S. 2016. Sexually antagonistic epigenetic marks that canalize sexually dimorphic development. Molecular Ecology 12: DOI: 10.1111/mec.13490 &lt;/ref&gt;
[[Epigenetics]] examines the set of chemical reactions that switch parts of the [[genome]] on and off at strategic times and locations in the organism's [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]]. However, epigenetic theories tangle a multiplicity of initiating causes and of resulting final effects and will never lead to a single cause or a single result. Hence, any interpretation of such theories may not focus just one isolated reason of a multiplicity of causes or of effects.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.volkswagenstiftung.de/de/evolution/ausbildungskonzepte.html Ausbildungskonzept "Integrated approaches to teach and study the role of evolution for the emergence of biological complexity"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of affecting the organism's DNA sequence, non-genetic factors may cause the organism’s genes to express themselves differently. DNA in the human body is wrapped around [[histone]]s, which are [[protein]]s that package and order DNA into structural units. DNA and histone are covered with [[chemical tag]]s known as the [[epigenome]], which shapes the physical structure of the genome.&lt;ref&gt;[http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/epigenetics/ "The Epigenome at a Glance."] Genetic Science Learning Center. The University of Utah, 2013. Web. 10 Apr. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It tightly wraps inactive genes on the DNA sequence making those genes unreadable while loosely wrapping active genes making them more expressive. The more tightly wrapped the gene, the less it will be expressed in the organism. These epigenetic tags react to stimuli presented from the outside world. It adjusts specific genes in the genome to respond to humans' rapidly changing environments. 
The idea of epigenetics and gene expression has been a theory applied to the origins of homosexuality in humans. One team of researchers examined the effects of [[epi-mark]]s buffering [[XY sex-determination system|XX]] [[fetus]]es and [[XY sex-determination system|XY]] fetuses from certain [[androgen]] exposure and used published data on fetal androgen signaling and [[gene regulation]] through non-genetic changes in DNA packaging to develop a new model for homosexuality.&lt;ref name="Richards"&gt;Richards, Sabrina. [http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/33773/title/Can-Epigenetics-Explain-Homosexuality-/ "Can Epigenetics Explain Homosexuality?."] The Scientist. N.p., 1 Jan. 2013. Web. 13 Apr. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers found that stronger than average epi-marks, epigenomes that are wrapped tightly around the DNA sequence, convert [[sexual preference]] in individuals without altering [[genitalia]] or [[sexual identity]].&lt;ref&gt;"National Geographic Explains the Biology of Homosexuality." YouTube. YouTube, 04 Feb. 2009. Web. 13 Apr. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
This research gives support to the [[hypothesis]] that homosexuality stems from the under expression of certain genes on the DNA sequence involved with sexual preferences. This theory as well as other concepts involved with epi-marks, [[twin studies]], and fetal androgen signaling will be explored here.

== Epigenetic marks ==
{{details|Epigenetics}}

Epigenetic marks (epi-marks) are temporary "switches" that control how our genes are expressed during [[gestation]] and after birth. Moreover, epi-marks  are modifications of histone proteins.&lt;ref&gt;Ruthenburg, A., C. Allis, and J. Wysocka. "Methylation of Lysine 4 on Histone H3: Intricacy of Writing and Reading a Single Epigenetic Mark." Molecular Cell 25.1 (2007): 15-30. Print. {{pmid|17218268}} {{doi|10.1016/j.molcel.2006.12.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epigenetic marks are modifications of the [[methyl]] and [[acetyl]] groups that bind to DNA histones thereby changing how the proteins function and as a result, alter gene expression.&lt;ref&gt;Jablonka E and MJ Lamb (2010). Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. In: M Pigliucci and GB Müller Evolution, the expanded synthesis&lt;/ref&gt; Epi-marks change how the histones function and as a result, influence the way genes are expressed.&lt;ref name="Friberg"&gt;William R. Rice, Friberg, Urban and Sergey Gavrilets. "Homosexuality as a Consequence of Epigenetically Canalized Sexual Development." The Quarterly Review of Biology 87.4 (2012): n. pag. Print. {{pmid|23397798}} {{doi|10.1086/668167}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epigenetic marks promote normal [[sexual development]] during [[fetal development]]. However, they can be passed on to [[offspring]] through the process of [[mitosis]]. When they are transferred from one parent to an offspring of the opposite sex, it can contribute to an altered sexual development, thus leading to [[masculinization]] of female offspring and [[feminization (biology)|feminization]] of male offspring.&lt;ref name="LiveScience"&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/25431-gene-regulation-homosexuality.html "Gene Regulation May Explain How Homosexuality Flourishes."] LiveScience.com. N.p., n.d. Web. 12 Apr. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; However, these epi-marks hold no consistency between individuals in regard to strength and variability.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

== Twin studies ==

[[Identical twin]]s have identical DNA, which leads to the perceived conclusion that all identical twins are either [[heterosexual]] or homosexual. However, it is evident that this is not the case, consequently leaving a gap in the explanation for homosexuality. A "gay" gene does not produce homosexuality. Rather, epigenetic modifications act as temporary "switches" that regulate how the genes are expressed.&lt;ref name="LiveScience"/&gt; Of the pairs of identical twins in which one twin is homosexual, only twenty percent of the other twins are homosexual, which leads to the hypothesis that even though identical twins share the same DNA, homosexuality is created by something else rather than the genes. Epigenetic transformation allows the on and off switching of certain genes, subsequently shaping how cells respond to androgen signaling, which is critical in sexual development.&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt;
Another example of epigenetic consequences is evident in [[multiple sclerosis]] in [[monozygotic]] (identical) twins. There are pairs of twins that are discordant with multiple sclerosis and do not both show the trait. After [[gene testing]], it was suggested that DNA was identical and that epigenetic differences contributed to the gene difference between identical twins.&lt;ref&gt;Handunnetthi, Lahiru, Adam Handel, and Sreeram V. Ramagopalan. Contribution of Genetic, Epigenetic and Transcriptomic Differences to Twin Discordance in Multiple Sclerosis. Ebsco Host. Psyc Info, 2010. Web. {{pmid|20819009}} {{doi|10.1586/ern.10.116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects of fetal androgen exposure ==

While in the fetal stages, hormonal influences of [[androgen]], specifically [[testosterone]], cause feminine qualities in regard to sexual development in females and masculine qualities in males. In typical sexual development, females are exposed to minimal amounts of testosterone, thus feminizing their sexual development, while males are typically exposed to high levels of testosterone, which masculinize their development. Epi-marks play a critical role in this development by acting as a buffer between the fetus and androgen exposure. Moreover, they predominantly protect XY fetuses from androgen underexposure while protecting XX fetuses from androgen overexposure.&lt;ref name="Friberg"/&gt; However, when androgen overexposure happens in XX fetuses, research suggests they can show masculinized behavior in comparison to females who undergo normal levels of androgen exposure. The research also suggests that excess androgen exposure in females led to reduced heterosexual interest in adulthood than did females with normal levels of androgen.&lt;ref&gt;Brook, Charles, Gerard S. Conway, and Melissa Hines. "Androgen and Psychosexual Development: Core Gender Identity, Sexual Orientation, and Recalled Childhood Gender Role Behavior in Women and Men with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH)." Journal of Sex Research 41.1 (2004): 75-81. Online {{pmid|15216426}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Heritability ==

New epi-marks are usually produced with each generation, but these marks sometimes carry over between [[generation]]s. Sex-specific epi-marks are produced in early fetal development that protect each sex from the natural disparity in testosterone that occurs during later stages of fetal development. Different epi-marks protect different sex-specific traits from being masculinized or feminized—some affect the genitals, others affect sexual identity, and yet others affect sexual preference. However, when these epi-marks are transmitted across generations from fathers to daughters or mothers to sons, they may cause reversed effects, such as the feminization of some traits in sons and similarly a partial masculinization of daughters. Furthermore, the reversed effects of feminization and masculinization can lead to a reversed sexual preference. For example, sex-specific epi-marks normally prevent female fetuses from being masculinized through exposure of atypically high [[testosterone]], and vice versa for male fetuses. Sex-specific epi-marks are normally erased and not passed between generations. However, they can sometimes escape erasure and are then transferred from a father's genes to a daughter or from a mother's genes to a son. When this happens, this may lead to an altered sexual preference.&lt;ref name="Friberg"/&gt; Epi-marks normally protect parents from variation in sex hormone levels during fetal development, but can carry over across generations and subsequently lead to homosexuality in opposite-sex offspring. This demonstrates that [[gene coding]] for these epi-marks can spread in the population because they benefit the development and fitness of the parent but only rarely escape erasure, leading to same-sex sexual preference in offspring.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

'''Evolutionary biology'''  is the subfield of [[biology]] that studies the [[evolution|evolutionary processes]] that produced the [[Biodiversity|diversity of life]] on [[Earth]], starting from [[Last universal common ancestor|a single common ancestor]]. These processes include [[natural selection]], [[common descent]], and [[speciation]].

The discipline emerged through what [[Julian Huxley]] called the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] (of the 1930s) of understanding from several previously unrelated fields of biological research, including [[genetics]], [[ecology]], [[systematics]], and [[paleontology]].

Current research has widened to cover the [[genetic architecture]] of adaptation, [[molecular evolution]], and the different forces that contribute to evolution including [[sexual selection]], [[genetic drift]] and [[biogeography]]. The newer field of [[evolutionary developmental biology]] ("evo-devo") investigates how [[embryogenesis|embryonic development]] is controlled, thus creating a wider synthesis that integrates [[developmental biology]] with the fields covered by the earlier evolutionary synthesis.

==Subfields==
[[Evolution]] is the central unifying concept in biology. Biology can be divided in various ways. One way is by the level of [[biological organisation]], from  [[molecular biology|molecular]] to [[cell biology|cell]], organism to [[population biology|population]]. An earlier way is by perceived [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic group]], with fields such as [[zoology]], [[botany]], and [[microbiology]], reflecting what were once seen as the major divisions of life.
A third way is by approach, such as field biology, [[theoretical biology]], [[experimental evolution]], and paleontology. These alternative ways of dividing up the subject can be combined with evolutionary biology to create subfields like [[evolutionary ecology]] and [[evolutionary developmental biology]].

More recently, the merge between the biological science and applied sciences gave birth to new fields that are extensions of evolutionary biology, such as [[evolutionary robotics]], engineering,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ls.toyaku.ac.jp/~lcb-7/en/keywords/evolutionaryengineering.html|title=Evolutionary engineering|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161216072919/http://www.ls.toyaku.ac.jp/~lcb-7/en/keywords/evolutionaryengineering.html|archivedate=16 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[evolutionary algorithms|algorithms]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.vu.nl/~gusz/ecbook/Eiben-Smith-Intro2EC-Ch2.pdf|title=What is an Evolutionary Algorithm?|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809084921/http://www.cs.vu.nl/~gusz/ecbook/Eiben-Smith-Intro2EC-Ch2.pdf|archivedate=9 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[evolutionary economics|economics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/krugman/www/evolute.html|title=What economists can learn from evolutionary theorists|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170730010043/http://web.mit.edu/krugman/www/evolute.html|archivedate=30 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-eaed1/index.html|title=Investigating architecture and design|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818215737/https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-eaed1/index.html|archivedate=18 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic mechanisms of evolution are applied directly or indirectly to come up with novel designs or solve problems that are difficult to solve otherwise. The research generated in these applied fields in turn contribute to progress, especially thanks to work on evolution in [[computer science]] and engineering fields such as [[mechanical engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783642072857|title=Introduction to Evolutionary Computing: A.E.

== History ==
{{Main|History of evolutionary thought}}

The idea of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]] was proposed by [[Charles Darwin]] in 1859, but evolutionary biology, as an [[academic discipline]] in its own right, emerged during the period of the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] in the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smocovitis |first=Vassiliki Betty |year=1996 |title=Unifying Biology: The Evolutionary Synthesis and Evolutionary Biology |location=Princeton, NJ |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-03343-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the 1980s that many universities had departments of evolutionary biology. In the [[United States]], many universities have created departments of ''molecular and cell biology'' or ''ecology and evolutionary biology'', in place of the older departments of [[botany]] and [[zoology]]. [[Palaeontology]] is often grouped with [[earth science]].

[[Microbiology]] too is becoming an evolutionary discipline, now that microbial physiology and [[genomics]] are better understood. The quick generation time of bacteria and [[virus]]es such as [[bacteriophage]]s makes it possible to explore evolutionary questions.

Many biologists have contributed to shaping the modern discipline of evolutionary biology. [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]] and [[E. B. Ford]] established an empirical research programme. [[Ronald Fisher]], [[Sewall Wright]] and [[J. S. Haldane]] created a sound theoretical framework. [[Ernst Mayr]] in [[systematics]], [[George Gaylord Simpson]] in paleontology and [[G. Ledyard Stebbins]] in [[botany]] helped to form the modern synthesis.

== Current research topics ==
Current research in evolutionary biology covers diverse topics and incorporates ideas from diverse areas, such as [[molecular genetics]] and [[computer science]].

First, some fields of evolutionary research try to explain phenomena that were poorly accounted for in the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]]. These include [[speciation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=2004 |title=What is speciation and how should we study it? |journal= American Naturalist |volume=163 |issue=6 |pages=914–923 |doi= 10.1086/386552 |jstor=10.1086/386552 |author=Wiens JJ |pmid=15266388 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[evolution of sexual reproduction]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=2009 |title=The evolutionary enigma of sex |journal= American Naturalist |volume=174 |issue=s1 |pages=S1–S14 |doi=10.1086/599084 |author=Otto SP |pmid=19441962}}&lt;/ref&gt; the evolution of [[Co-operation (evolution)|cooperation]], the [[evolution of ageing]], and [[evolvability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2007 |title=Evolvability as the proper focus of evolutionary developmental biology |journal= Evolution &amp; Development |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=393–401 |doi= 10.1111/j.1525-142X.2007.00176.x |author=Jesse Love Hendrikse |author2=Trish Elizabeth Parsons |author3=Benedikt Hallgrímsson }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, biologists ask the most straightforward evolutionary question: "what happened and when?". This includes fields such as [[paleobiology]], as well as [[systematics]] and [[phylogenetics]].

Third, the modern evolutionary synthesis was devised at a time when nobody understood the molecular basis of genes. Today, evolutionary biologists try to determine the [[genetic architecture]] of interesting evolutionary phenomena such as [[adaptation]] and speciation. They seek answers to questions such as how many genes are involved, how large are the effects of each gene, how interdependent are the effects of different genes, what do the genes do, and what changes happen to them (e.g., [[point mutations]] vs. [[gene duplication]] or even [[polyploidy|genome duplication]]). They try to reconcile the high [[heritability]] seen in [[twin studies]] with the difficulty in finding which genes are responsible for this heritability using [[genome-wide association studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2009|title=Finding the missing heritability of complex diseases|journal=Nature|volume=461|issue=7265|pages=747–753|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v461/n7265/full/nature08494.html|doi=10.1038/nature08494|author=Manolio TA|author2=Collins FS|author3=Cox NJ|author4=Goldstein DB|author5=Hindorff LA|author6=Hunter DJ|author7=McCarthy MI|author8=Ramos EM|author9=Cardon LR|author10=Chakravarti A|author11=Cho JH|author12=Guttmacher AE|author13=Kong A|author14=Kruglyak L|author15=Mardis E|author16=Rotimi CN|author17=Slatkin M|author18=Valle D|author19=Whittemore AS|author20=Boehnke M|author21=Clark AG|author22=Eichler EE|author23=Gibson G|author24=Haines JL|author25=Mackay TFC|author26=McCarroll SA|author27=Visscher PM|pmid=19812666|pmc=2831613|bibcode=2009Natur.461..747M|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110729160819/http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v461/n7265/full/nature08494.html|archivedate=29 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One challenge in studying genetic architecture is that the classical [[population genetics]] that catalysed the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]] must be updated to take into account modern molecular knowledge. This requires a great deal of mathematical development to relate DNA sequence data to evolutionary theory as part of a theory of [[molecular evolution]]. For example, biologists try to infer which genes have been under strong selection by detecting [[selective sweeps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=2002 |title=Detecting recent positive selection in the human genome from haplotype structure |journal=Nature |volume=419 |pages=832–837 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v419/n6909/full/nature01140.html |doi=10.1038/nature01140 |issue=6909 |pmid=12397357 |author=Sabeti PC |author2=Reich DE |author3=Higgins JM |author4=Levine HZP |author5=Richter DJ |author6=Schaffner SF |author7=Gabriel SB |author8=Platko JV |author9=Patterson NJ |author10=McDonald GJ |author11=Ackerman HC |author12=Campbell SJ |author13=Altshuler D |author14=Cooper R |author15=Kwiatkowski D |author16=Ward R |author17=Lander ES |bibcode=2002Natur.419..832S |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110327154520/http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v419/n6909/full/nature01140.html |archivedate=27 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourth, the modern evolutionary synthesis involved agreement about which forces contribute to evolution, but not about their relative importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=1988| title=Evolutionary progress |chapter= Progress in evolution and meaning in life | pages=49–79 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |author=Provine WB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current research seeks to determine this. Evolutionary forces include [[natural selection]], [[sexual selection]], [[genetic drift]], [[genetic hitchhiking|genetic draft]], developmental constraints, mutation bias and [[biogeography]].

An evolutionary approach is key to much current research in organismal biology and [[ecology]], such as in [[life history theory]]. [[Gene finding|Annotation of genes]] and their function relies heavily on comparative approaches. The field of [[Evolutionary developmental biology|evolutionary developmental biology ("evo-devo")]] investigates how developmental processes work, and compares them in different organisms to determine how they evolved.

==Journals==
Some [[scientific journal]]s specialise exclusively in evolutionary biology as a whole, including the journals ''[[Evolution (journal)|Evolution]]'', ''[[Journal of Evolutionary Biology]]'', and ''[[BMC Evolutionary Biology]]''. Some journals cover sub-specialties within evolutionary biology, such as the journals ''[[Systematic Biology]]'', ''[[Molecular Biology and Evolution]]'' and its sister journal ''Genome Biology and Evolution'', and ''[[Cladistics (journal)|Cladistics]].

Other journals combine aspects of evolutionary biology with other related fields. For example, ''[[Molecular Ecology]]'', ''[[Proceedings of the Royal Society#Proceedings of the Royal Society B|Proceedings of the Royal Society of London Series B]]'', ''[[The American Naturalist]]'' and ''Theoretical Population Biology'' have overlap with ecology and other aspects of organismal biology. Overlap with ecology is also prominent in the review journals ''[[Trends in Ecology and Evolution]]'' and ''[[Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics]]''. The journals ''[[Genetics (journal)|Genetics]]'' and ''[[PLoS Genetics]]'' overlap with molecular genetics questions that are not obviously evolutionary in nature.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5385">The '''G-less cassette''' transcription assay is a method used in [[molecular biology]] to determine [[Promoter (genetics)|promoter]] strength ''in vitro''. The technique involves quantification of an mRNA product with the use of a plasmid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Reverse Transcriptase-Coupled Quantitative Real Time PCR Analysis of Cell-Free Transcription on the Chromatin-Assembled p21 Promoter |date=2014-11-12 |pmc=3160311 | pmid=21886803 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0023617 |volume=6 |journal=PLOS ONE |pages=e23617 | last1 = Park | first1 = JH | last2 = Magan | first2 = N}}&lt;/ref&gt; The G-less cassette is part of a pre-constructed vector, usually containing a [[multiple cloning site]] (MCS) upstream of the cassette. For this reason, promoters of interest can be inserted directly into the MCS to ultimately measure the accuracy and efficiency of a promoter in recruiting transcription machinery.

[[File:Glesscassetteassay.png|thumb|'''A promoter is cloned into the &lt;br /&gt;G-less cassette plasmid.'''&lt;br /&gt;
'''(a)''' A pre-made plasmid with a 365-nt G-less sense strand is subjected to promoter insertion. '''(b)''' The promoter is cloned into the multiple cloning site (MCS) immediately upstream of the transcription start site. A polymerase is used transcribe the G-less cassette. Once the cassette has been transcribed and first guanosine triphosphate in the sense strand beyond the cassette is detected, transcription is prematurely terminated. A radiolabeled 365-nt transcript is released. The transcripts produced in a G-less cassette assay may be subjected to gel electrophoresis to confirm their length and autoradiography to determine relative promoter strength.]]

==Method==
The G-less cassette is a [[reporter gene]] that encodes a transcript lacking [[guanine]] nucleotides in the [[Sense (molecular biology)|sense]] strand of the DNA (hence "'''G'''-less").&lt;ref name="Baniahmad2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Aria Baniahmad|title=Thyroid Hormone Receptors: Methods and Protocols|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DDuqWMe_6xEC&amp;pg=PA211|year=2002|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-59259-174-9|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; A plasmid containing such a gene  is located downstream of a MCS. After the promoter is inserted into the MCS, [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] proceeds with the addition of radiolabeled UTP, CTP, and ATP (as well as non-radiolabeled/cold nucleotides) and continues until the end of the G-less cassette is reached and guanine residues are once again apparent in the sense strand of the DNA. The absence of GTP ''in vitro'' results in transcription being prematurely terminated at the first guanine residue in the sense strand following the cassette. [[Gel electrophoresis]] is performed on the transcription products and the amount of radioactivity is quantified by [[autoradiograph]]y or [[Phosphorimager|phosphorimaging]] to determine the strength of the promoter of interest.

==Application==
The G-less cassette technique is used to determine promoter strength beyond basal levels of transcription (i.e. in the presence of [[transcription activators]] or [[transcription factor]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Poly(A) signal-dependent degradation of unprocessed nascent transcripts accompanies poly(A) signal-dependent transcriptional pausing in vitro |date=2014-11-12 |pmc=2802029 | pmid=19926725 |doi=10.1261/rna.1622010 |volume=16 |journal=RNA |pages=197–210 | last1 = Kazerouninia | first1 = A | last2 = Ngo | first2 = B | last3 = Martinson | first3 = HG}}&lt;/ref&gt;). For example, to measure the effects of a [[TATA box]] [[consensus sequence]] modification in ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' in the presence of [[TFIID]], G-less cassettes were implemented to measure the relative strength of each promoter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Minimal components of the RNA polymerase II transcription apparatus determine the consensus TATA box |date=2014-11-12 |pmc=2396422 | pmid=18385157 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkn130 |volume=36 |journal=Nucleic Acids Res |pages=2906–16 | last1 = Bjornsdottir | first1 = G | last2 = Myers | first2 = LC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
The G-less assay can be performed on a circular plasmid to measure levels of transcription. A circular plasmid provides a more efficient template in many systems when compared to other assays such as runoff transcription, in which a cleaved end is required. This method generates radiolabeled transcripts very efficiently because it bypasses the unnecessary process of performing other indirect mRNA product measurements. The promoter is inserted into a circular plasmid containing the G-less cassette, which will generate a transcript of a certain length that omits random and nonspecific transcription throughout the plasmid. Most crude systems, such as HeLa nuclear extracts, are used because they contain low amounts of contaminating GTP that lead to background transcription and may occasionally cause random transcription to read through the G-less cassette.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= G-less cassette in vitro transcription using HeLa cell nuclear extracts|date=2014-11-12 |pmid=20194456 | doi=10.1101/pdb.prot5387 |volume=2010 |journal=Cold Spring Harb Protoc |pages=pdb.prot5387 | last1 = Carey | first1 = MF | last2 = Peterson | first2 = CL | last3 = Smale | first3 = ST}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2714">The '''gastrocolic reflex''' or '''gastrocolic response''' is one of a number of physiological reflexes controlling the [[motility]], or [[peristalsis]], of the [[gastrointestinal tract]].  It involves an increase in motility of the [[colon (anatomy)|colon]] consisting primarily of giant migrating contractions in response to stretch in the [[stomach]] and byproducts of digestion in the [[small intestine]].  Thus, this reflex is responsible for the urge to defecate following a meal. The small intestine also shows a similar motility response.  The gastrocolic reflex helps make room for more food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Sherwood |last=Lauralee |title=Human Physiology: From Cells to Systems |edition=7th |year=2009 |page=635 |publisher=Cengage Learning| isbn=978-0-495-39184-5| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gOmpysGBC90C&amp;pg=PT663&amp;dq=gastrocolic+reflex&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=U2xHTJ-aOITGlQfdxq2YBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=gastrocolic%20reflex&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reflex was demonstrated by myoelectric recordings in the colons of animals and humans, which showed an increase in electrical activity within as little as 15 minutes after eating.  The recordings also demonstrated that the gastrocolic reflex is uneven in its distribution throughout the colon.  The [[sigmoid colon]] is more greatly affected than the right side of the colon in terms of a phasic response; however, the tonic response across the colon is uncertain.  When pressure within the rectum becomes increased, the gastrocolic reflex acts as a stimulus for defecation.  A number of [[neuropeptides]] have been proposed as mediators of the gastrocolic reflex.  These include [[serotonin]], [[neurotensin]], [[cholecystokinin]] (CCK), and [[gastrin]].

Clinically, the gastrocolic reflex has been implicated in pathogenesis of [[irritable bowel syndrome]]: the very act of eating or drinking can provoke an overreaction of the gastrocolic response in some patients with irritable bowel syndrome due to their heightened visceral sensitivity, and this can lead to abdominal pain, [[diarrhea]], or [[constipation]].&lt;ref&gt;Sjölund K, Ekman R, Lindgren S, Rehfeld J (1996): ''Disturbed motilin and cholecystokinin release in the irritable bowel syndrome'' in Scand J Gastroenterol, 31:11, pp 1110–4, {{PMID|8938905}}, DOI 10.3109/00365529609036895&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, the serotonin (5HT&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) antagonist [[ondansetron]] decreases the tonic response to stretch.

The 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL) conducted by the US Department of Education found that 36% of participants scored as either "basic" or "below basic" in terms of their health literacy and concluded that approximately 80 million Americans have limited health literacy.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Health Literacy of America's Adults: Results From the 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy|last=Kutner|first=MA|last2=Greenberg|first2=E|last3=Jin|first3=Y|last4=Paulson|first4=C|publisher=National Center for Education Statistics|year=2006|isbn=|location=Washington, DC|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These individuals have difficulty with common health tasks including reading the label of a prescribed drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=America's Health Literacy: Why We Need Accessible Health Information|url=http://health.gov/communication/literacy/issuebrief/|website=health.gov|accessdate=2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several factors may influence health literacy. However, the following factors have been shown to strongly increase this risk: age (especially patients 65 years and older), limited English language proficiency or English as a second language, less education, and lower socioeconomic status. Patients with low health literacy understand less about their medical conditions and treatments and overall report worse health status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1999-02-10|title=Health literacy: report of the Council on Scientific Affairs. Ad Hoc Committee on Health Literacy for the Council on Scientific Affairs, American Medical Association|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10022112|journal=JAMA|volume=281|issue=6|pages=552–557|issn=0098-7484|pmid=10022112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various interventions, such as simplifying information and illustrations, avoiding [[jargon]], using "[[The teach-back method|teach-back]]" methods, and encouraging patients' questions, have improved health behaviors in persons with low health literacy. The proportion of adults aged 18 and over in the U.S., in the year 2010, who reported that their health care providers always explained things so they could understand them was about 60.6%.&lt;ref name="healthypeople.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/health-communication-and-health-information-technology/national-snapshot|title=Health Communication and Health Information Technology - Healthy People 2020|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This number increased 1% from 2007 to 2010.&lt;ref name="healthypeople.gov" /&gt; The [[Healthy People program#Healthy People 2010 and Healthy People 2020|Healthy People 2020]] initiative of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] has included health literacy as a pressing new topic, with objectives for improving it in the decade to come.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topicsobjectives2020/overview.aspx?topicid=18|title=Health Communication and Health Information Technology - Healthy People 2020|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Society as a whole is responsible for improving health literacy. Most importantly, improving health literacy is the responsibility of healthcare and public health professionals and systems.

==Characteristics==

=== Plain language ===
In order to have a patient that understands health terms and can make proper health decisions, the language used by health professionals has to be at a level that others who are not in the medical field can understand. Health professionals must know their audience in order to better serve their patients. The language used by these professionals should be [[plain language]]. Plain language is a strategy for making written and oral information easier to understand; it is communication that users can understand the first time they read or hear it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Health Literacy - Fact Sheet: Health Literacy Basics|url = http://health.gov/communication/literacy/quickguide/factsbasic.htm|website = health.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some key elements of plain language include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plainlanguage.gov/howto/guidelines/FederalPLGuidelines/TOC.cfm|title=Federal Plain Language Guidelines: Table of Contents|website=www.plainlanguage.gov|access-date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Organizing information so most important points come first
* Breaking complex information into understandable chunks
* Using simple language and defining technical terms
* Using active voice
* Using lists and tables to make complex material easier to understand

The National Institute of Health (NIH) recommends that patient education materials should be not written higher than a 6th-7th grade reading level; further recommendations provided by the NIH Office of Communications and Public Liaison are published in their [https://www.nih.gov/institutes-nih/nih-office-director/office-communications-public-liaison/clear-communication "Clear Communication" Initiative.]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nih.gov/institutes-nih/nih-office-director/office-communications-public-liaison/clear-communication|title=Clear Communication|work=National Institutes of Health (NIH)|access-date=2018-11-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Factors ===
Many factors determine the health literacy level of [[health education]] materials or interventions: [[Reading level|readability]] of the text, the patient's current state of health, [[language barrier]]s of the patient, cultural appropriateness of the materials, format and style, sentence structure, use of illustrations, and numerous other factors.

A study of 2,600 patients conducted in 1995 by two US hospitals found that between 26% and 60% of patients could not understand medication directions, a standard [[informed consent]] form, or materials about scheduling an appointment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=M. V. Williams|year=1995|title=Inadequate functional health literacy among patients at two public hospitals|journal=JAMA|volume=274|issue=21|pages=677–82|url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/274/21/1677|accessdate=2006-06-30|doi=10.1001/jama.274.21.1677|pmid=7474271|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL) conducted by the US Department of Education found that 36% of participants scored as either "basic" or "below basic" in terms of their health literacy and  concluded that approximately 80 million Americans have limited health literacy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==History==
The young and multidisciplinary field of '''health literacy''' emerged from two groups of experts: physicians, health providers such as nurses,&lt;ref&gt;Dickens, C., and Piano, MR. (2013) "Health literacy and nursing: an update." The American Journal of Nursing.  Jun;113(6):52-7. doi: 10.1097/01.NAJ.0000431271.83277.2f.&lt;/ref&gt; and health educators; and [[Adult Basic Education]] (ABE) and [[English as a second language]] (ESL) practitioners in the field of education. [[Physicians]] and [[nurses]] are a source of patient comprehension and compliance studies. Adult Basic Education / English for Speakers of Languages Other Than English (ABE/ESOL) specialists study and design interventions to help people develop reading, writing, and conversation skills and increasingly infuse curricula with health information to promote better health literacy. A range of approaches to adult education brings health literacy skills to people in traditional classroom settings, as well as where they work and live.

===Biomedical approach===
The [[biomedical approach]] to health literacy that became dominant (in the U.S.) during the 1980s and 1990s often depicted individuals as lacking health literacy or "suffering" from low health literacy. This approach assumed that recipients are passive in their possession and reception of health literacy and believed that models of literacy and health literacy are politically neutral and universally applicable. This approach is found lacking when placed in the context of broader ecological, critical, and cultural approaches to health. This approach has produced, and continues to reproduce, numerous correlational studies.&lt;ref&gt;Pleasant &amp; Kuruvilla, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Level of health literacy is considered adequate when the population has sufficient knowledge, skills, and confidence to guide their own health, and people are able to stay healthy, recover from illness, and/or live with disability or disease.&lt;ref name="McMurray"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anne McMurray|title=Community Health and Wellness: A Sociological Approach|location=Brisbane|publisher=Elsevier|year=2007|ISBN=978-0-7295-3788-9|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McMurray states that health literacy is important in a community because it addresses health inequities. It is no coincidence that individuals with lower levels of health literacy live, disproportionally, in communities with lower socio-economic standing. A barrier to achieving adequate health literacy for these individuals is a lack of awareness, or understanding of, information and resources relevant to improving their health. This knowledge gap arises from both patients being unable to understand information presented to them and hospitals' inadequate efforts and materials to address these literacy gaps.

A more robust view of health literacy includes the ability to [[Scientific literacy|understand scientific concepts]], content, and health research; skills in spoken, written, and online communication; critical interpretation of mass media messages; navigating complex systems of health care and governance; knowledge and use of community capital and resources; and using cultural and indigenous knowledge in health decision making.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nutbeam|first=D.|date=2000-09-01|title=Health literacy as a public health goal: a challenge for contemporary health education and communication strategies into the 21st century|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/heapro/15.3.259|journal=Health Promotion International|language=en|volume=15|issue=3|pages=259–267|doi=10.1093/heapro/15.3.259|issn=1460-2245}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ratzan|first=S.

This perspective defines health literacy as the wide range of skills, and competencies that people develop over their lifetimes to seek out, comprehend, evaluate, and use health information and concepts to make informed choices, reduce health risks, and increase quality of life.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zarcadoolas|first=Christina|last2=Pleasant|first2=Andrew|last3=Greer|first3=David S.|date=June 2005|title=Understanding health literacy: an expanded model|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15788526|journal=Health Promotion International|volume=20|issue=2|pages=195–203|doi=10.1093/heapro/dah609|issn=0957-4824|pmid=15788526}}&lt;/ref&gt; While various definitions vary in wording, they all fall within this conceptual framework.

Defining health literacy in that manner builds the foundation for a multi-dimensional model of health literacy built around four central domains:&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

*fundamental literacy,
*scientific literacy,
*civic literacy, and
*cultural literacy.

There are several tests, which have verified reliability in the academic literature that can be administered in order to test one's health literacy. Some of these tests include the Medical Term Recognition Test (METER), which was developed in the United States (2 minute administration time) for the clinical setting.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Altin|first1=Sibel|last2=Finke|first2=Isabelle|last3=Kautz-Freimuth|first3=Sibylle|last4=Stock|first4=Stephanie|title=The evolution of health literacy assessment tools: a systematic review|journal=BMC Public Health|date=2014|volume=14|issue=1|page=1207|doi=10.1186/1471-2458-14-1207|pmc=4289240|pmid=25418011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The METER includes many words from the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM) test.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; The Short Assessment of Health Literacy in Spanish and English populations (SAHL-S&amp;E) uses word recognition and multiple choice questions to test a person's comprehension.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; The CHC-Test measures Critical Health Competencies and consists of 72 items designed to test a person's understanding of medical concepts, literature searching, basic statistics, and design of experiments and samples.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

==Patient safety and outcomes==
According to an [[Institute of Medicine]] (2004) report, low health literacy negatively affects the treatment outcome and safety of care delivery.&lt;ref&gt;The Institute of Medicine: [http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10883.html#toc Health Literacy: A Prescription to End Confusion] (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of health literacy affects all segments of the population.  However, it is disproportionate in certain demographic groups, such as the [[elderly]], [[ethnic minorities]], recent [[immigrants]], and persons with low general [[literacy]].&lt;ref&gt;2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy [http://nces.ed.gov/NAAL/index.asp?file=AssessmentOf/HealthLiteracy/HealthLiteracyResults.asp&amp;PageID=158 The Health Literacy of America's Adults] Retrieved 9 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; These populations have a higher risk of hospitalization, longer hospital stays, are less likely to comply with treatment, are more likely to make errors with medication,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Terry C.

The mismatch between a clinician's [[communication]] of content and a patient's ability to understand that content can lead to medication errors and adverse medical outcomes. Health literacy skills are not only a problem in the general population. Health care professionals (doctors, nurses, public health workers) can also have poor health literacy skills, such as a reduced ability to clearly explain health issues to patients and the public.&lt;ref&gt;American Society of Anesthesiology abstracts (October 25, 2005), Aaron M.

In addition to tailoring the content of what health professionals communicate to their patients, a well arranged layout, pertinent illustrations, and intuitive format of written materials can improve the usability of health care literature. This in turn can help in effective communication between healthcare providers and their patients.&lt;ref name="IJGM_Gill2012"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2012|title=Readability Assessment of Concussion and Traumatic Brain Injury Publications by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|journal=[[International Journal of General Medicine]]|volume=5|pages=923–933|doi=10.2147/IJGM.S37110|first1=P.S.|last1=Gill|first2=T.S.|last2=Gill|first3=A.|last3=Kamath|first4=B.|last4=whisnant|url=http://www.dovepress.com/getfile.php?fileID=14417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Risk identification===
Identifying a patient as having low health literacy is essential for a healthcare professional to conform their health intervention in a way that the patient will understand. When patients with low health literacy receive care that is tailored to their more limited medical knowledge base, results have shown that health behaviors drastically improve. This has been seen with: correct medication use and dosage, utilizing health screenings, as well as increased exercise and smoking cessation. Effective visual aids have shown to help supplement the information communicated by the doctor in the office. In particular, easily readable brochures and videos have shown to be very effective.&lt;ref&gt;Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality: Evidence Report/Technology Assessment: Number 87 [http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/epcsums/litsum.htm Literacy and Health Outcomes]&lt;/ref&gt; Healthcare professionals can use many methods to attain patients' health literacy. A multitude of tests used during research studies and three minute assessments commonly used in doctors offices are examples of the variety of tests healthcare professionals can use to better understand their patients' health literacy.&lt;ref name="TOFLA"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Conversation/&gt;&lt;ref name=NPSF/&gt;

The American Medical Association showed that asking simple single item questions, such as "How confident are you in filling out medical forms by yourself?", is a very effective and direct way to understand from a patient's point of view how they feel about interacting with their healthcare provider and understanding their health condition.&lt;ref name=Questions/&gt;

===Intervention===
In order to be understood by patients with insufficient health literacy, health professionals must intervene to provide clear and concise information that can be more easily understood. Avoidance of medical jargon, illustrations of important concepts, and confirming information by a "teach back" method have shown to be effective tools to communicating essential health topics with health illiterate patients.&lt;ref name=Conversation&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality|url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/perspectives/conversation-cultural-competence-cindy-brach-senior-health-policy-researcher-ahrq|title=A Conversation on Cultural Competence With Cindy Brach, Senior Health Policy Researcher, AHRQ|date=2013-04-17|accessdate=2013-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; A program called "Ask Me 3"&lt;ref name=NPSF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askme3.org/index.asp|title=National Patient Safety Foundation|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308091008/http://www.askme3.org/index.asp|archivedate=2008-03-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is designed to bring public and physician attention to this issue, by letting patients know that they should ask three questions each time they talk to a doctor, nurse, or pharmacist:
*What is my main problem?
*What do I need to do?
*Why is it important for me to do this?

There have also been large-scale efforts to improve health literacy. For example, a public information program by the US Department of Health and Human Services encourages patients to improve healthcare quality and avoid errors by asking questions about health conditions and treatment.&lt;ref name=Questions&gt;Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality: [http://www.ahrq.gov/questionsaretheanswer/ Questions Are the Answer], retrieved 2008-10-18&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the IROHLA (Intervention Research on Health Literacy of the Ageing population)  project, funded by the European Union (EU), seeks to develop evidence-based guidelines for policy and practice to improve health literacy of the ageing population in EU member states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irohla.eu/home/|title=Home|publisher=|access-date=2015-06-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613081655/http://www.irohla.eu/home/|archive-date=2015-06-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project has developed a framework and identified and validated interventions which together constitute a comprehensive approach of addressing health literacy needs of the elderly.

===Health illiterate-related diabetes prevalence in Vietnamese-American populations===
Diabetes is a rapidly growing health problem among immigrants—affecting approximately 10 percent of Asian-Americans.  It is the fifth-leading cause of death in Asian-Americans between the ages of 45 and 64.  In addition, type 2 diabetes is the most common form of the disease.  Those who are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes have high levels of blood glucose because the body does not effectively respond to insulin.  It is a lifelong disease with no known cure.  Diabetes is a chronic, debilitating, and costly social burden—costing healthcare systems about $100 billion annually.&lt;ref name="Cabiglio"&gt;Cabiglio, Josie. Diabetes on the rise among Asians.  Nguoi Viet 2. Web. 7 Dec 2010.
{{cite web|url=http://nguoi-viet.com/absolutenm/anmviewer.asp?a%3D41207%26z%3D126|title=Archived copy|accessdate=2011-12-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061126043141/http://www.nguoi-viet.com/absolutenm/anmviewer.asp?a=41207&amp;z=126|archivedate=2006-11-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diabetes disproportionately affects underserved and ethnically diverse populations, such as Vietnamese-American communities.  The relationship between the disease and health literacy level is in part because of an individual's ability to read English, evaluate blood glucose levels, and communicate with medical professionals.  Other studies also suggest lack in knowledge of diabetes symptoms and complications.&lt;ref name="Glazier"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Glazier R.H. | year = 2004 | title = Neighborhood recent immigration and hospitalization in Toronto, Canada | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Public Health | volume = 95 | issue = | pages = 130–134 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to an observational cross-sectional study conducted, many Vietnamese-American diabetic patients show signs of poor blood glucose control and adherence due to inadequate self-management knowledge and experience.&lt;ref name="Mull"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mull Dorothy S.

==== Oral health literacy in school teachers of Mangalore, India ====
The problem of low oral health literacy (OHL) is often neglected which may lead to poor oral health outcomes and under utilization of oral care services. A cross-sectional survey of  school teachers working in schools at Mangalore, India was undertaken. Details regarding demographics, medical, and dental history, oral hygiene practices and habits, diet history, and decay promoting the potential of school teachers were obtained using face-to-face interview method. The Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Dentistry-99 (REALD-99) was used to assess their OHL.The OHL was high in the school teachers with the REALD-99 scores ranging from 45 to 95 with a mean score of 75.83 ± 9.94. Th This study found that there was a statistically significant difference between OHL and education, frequency of brushing and the filled teeth. Although this study indicated high OHL levels among school teachers in Mangalore, India the magnitude of dental caries in this population was also relatively high and very few had a healthy periodontium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simon|first=Arun K|last2=Rao|first2=Ashwini|last3=Rajesh|first3=GuruRaghavendran|last4=Shenoy|first4=Ramya|last5=Pai|first5=Mithun B.

eHealth literacy describes the relatively modern concept of an individual's ability to search for, successfully access, comprehend, and appraise desired health information from electronic sources and to then use such information to attempt to address a particular health problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jmir.org/2006/2/e9/|title=eHealth Literacy: Essential Skills for Consumer Health in a Networked World|first1=Cameron D|last1=Norman|first2=Harvey A|last2=Skinner|date=1 January 2006|publisher=|volume=8|issue=2|doi=10.2196/jmir.8.2.e9|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|page=e9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the increasing influence of the internet for information-seeking and health information distribution purposes, eHealth literacy has become an important topic of research in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayat|first=T|last2=Brainin|first2=E|last3=Neter|first3=E|date=|title=With Some Help From My Network: Supplementing eHealth Literacy With Social Ties|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|volume=19|issue=3|pages=e98.|doi=10.2196/jmir.6472|via=|pmc=5391437|pmid=28360024|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stellefson (2011) states, "8 out of 10 Internet users report that they have at least once looked online for health information, making it the third most popular Web activity next to checking email and using search engines in terms of activities that almost everybody has done."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jmir.org/2011/4/e102/|title=eHealth Literacy Among College Students: A Systematic Review With Implications for eHealth Education|first1=Michael|last1=Stellefson|first2=Bruce|last2=Hanik|first3=Beth|last3=Chaney|first4=Don|last4=Chaney|first5=Bethany|last5=Tennant|first6=Enmanuel Antonio|last6=Chavarria|date=1 January 2011|publisher=|volume=13|issue=4|doi=10.2196/jmir.1703|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|page=e102}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though in recent years, individuals may have gained access to a multitude of health information via the Internet, access alone does not ensure that proper search skills and techniques are being used to find the most relevant online and electronic resources. As the line between a reputable medical source and an amateur opinion can often be blurred, the ability to differentiate between the two is important.

Health literacy requires a combination of several different literacy skills in order to facilitate eHealth promotion and care.  Six core skills are delineated by an eHealth literacy model referred to as the Lily model.  The Lily Model's six literacies are organized into two central types: analytic and context-specific.  Analytic type literacies are those skills that can be applied to a broad range of sources, regardless of topic or content (i.e., skills that can also be applied to shopping or researching a term paper in addition to health) whereas context-specific skills are those that are contextualized within a specific problem domain (can solely be applied to health).  The six literacies are listed below, the first three of the analytic type and the latter three of the context-specific:
* Traditional literacy
* Media literacy
* Information literacy
* Computer literacy
* Scientific literacy
* Health literacy

According to Norman (2006), both analytical and context-specific literacy skills are "required to fully engage with electronic health resources."  As the World Wide Web and technological innovations are more and more becoming a part of the healthcare environment, it is important for information technology to be properly utilized to promote health and deliver health care effectively. Furthermore, it was argued by Hayat Brainin &amp; Neter (2017), that digital media fosters the creation of interpersonal ties, that can supplement eHealth literacy. According to Hayat Brainin &amp; Neter (2017), individuals with low eHealth literacy who were able to recruit help when performing online activities demonstrated higher health outcomes compared to similar individuals who did not find help. Also relating to the proliferation of digital media is the fact that many individuals now can create their own ‘media content’ ([[user-generated content]]). This means that the boundary between “information” and “media” content, as proposed by Norman in 2006, now is increasingly blurred, creating additional challenges for health practitioners (Holmberg, 2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Holmberg C | year = 2016 | title = If You can't beat It-Use It: why and how clinicians need to consider social media in the treatment of adolescents with obesity | url = | journal = European Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 70 | issue = 9| pages = 977–8 | doi = 10.1038/ejcn.2016.126 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested that the move towards [[Patient-centred care|patient-centered care]] and the greater use of technology for self-care and self-management requires higher health literacy on the part of the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=Henna|last2=Xie|first2=Bo|title=Health literacy in the eHealth era: A systematic review of the literature|journal=Patient Education and Counseling|date=January 2017|doi=10.1016/j.pec.2017.01.015|volume=100|pages=1073–1082}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been noted in several research studies, for example among adolescent patients with obesity.&lt;ref&gt;Holmberg, C., Berg, C., Dahlgren, J., Lissner, L., &amp; Chaplin, J. E. (2018). Health literacy in a complex digital media landscape: Pediatric obesity patients’ experiences with online weight, food, and health information. Health Informatics Journal. Mar 1:1460458218759699. doi: 10.1177/1460458218759699&lt;/ref&gt;

== Improvement ==

=== Incorporate information through the university level ===
The [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] created a National Action Plan to Improve Health Literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://health.gov/communication/hlactionplan/pdf/Health_Literacy_Action_Plan.pdf|title=National Action Plan to Improve Health Literacy|date=|accessdate=|website=|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the goals of the National Action Plan is to incorporate health and science information in childcare and education through the university level. The target is to educate people at an early stage; that way individuals are raised with health literacy and will have a better quality of life. The earlier an individual is exposed to health literacy skills the better for the person and the community.

Programs such as Head Start&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ohs|title=Home - Office of Head Start - Administration for Children and Families|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) - Food and Nutrition Service|url=http://www.fns.usda.gov/wic/women-infants-and-children-wic|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have impacted our society, especially the low income population. Head Start provides low-income children and their families early childhood education, nutrition, and health screenings. Health literacy is integrated in the program for both children and parents through the education given to the individuals. WIC serves low-income pregnant women and new mothers by supplying them with food, health care referrals, and nutrition education. Programs like these help improve the health literacy of both the parent and the child, creating a more knowledgeable community with health education.

Although programs like Head Start and WIC have been working with the health literacy of a specific population, much more can be done with the education of children and young adults. Now, more and more adolescents are getting involved with their health care. It is crucial to educate these individuals in order for them to make informed decisions.

Many schools in the country incorporate a health class in their curriculum. These classes provided an excellent opportunity to facilitate and develop health literacy in today's children and adolescents. The skills of how to read food labels, the meaning of common medical terms, the structure of the human body, and education on the most prevalent diseases in the United States should be taught in both private and public schools. This way new generations will grow with health literacy and would hopefully make knowledgeable health decisions.

=== Framework and potential intervention points ===
The National Library of Medicine defines health literacy as:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=|title=Health Literacy: A Prescription to End Confustion|last=Nielsen-Bohlmn|first=Lynn|date=2004|journal=Institute of Medicine|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"The degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health literacy
information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions."}}

Based on this clinical definition, health literacy gives
individuals the skills that they need to both understand and effectively
communicate information and concerns. Bridging that gap between literacy skills
and the ability of the individual in health contexts, the ''Health Literacy Framework'' highlights the health outcomes and costs
associated with health contexts including cognitive abilities, social skills,
emotional state, and physical conditions such as visual and auditory contributions.

''Potential Intervention Points'' are illustrated in reflection of the ''Health Literacy Framework.''
While these potential intervention points include interactions such as those of individuals and the education systems
that they are engaged with, their health systems, and societal factors as they
relate to health literacy, these points are not 
components of a causal model.  The three
potential intervention points are culture and society, the health system, and
the education system. Health outcomes and costs are the products of the health
literacy developed during diversity of exposure to these three potential intervention
points.

Referring to shared ideas, meanings, and values that
influence an individual's beliefs and attitudes, cultural and societal
influences are a significant intervention point for health literacy
development. As interactions with healthcare systems often first occur at the
family level, deeply rooted beliefs and values can shape the significance of
the experience. Included components that reflect the development of health
literacy both culturally and societally are native language, socioeconomic status,
gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as mass media exposure. These
are pathways to understanding American life paralleling conquests for a health
literate America.

The health system is an intervention point in the ''Health Literacy Framework''. For the
purposes of this framework, health literacy refers to an individual's
interaction with people performing health-related activities in settings such
as hospitals, clinics, physician's offices, home health care, public health agencies,
and insurers.

In the United States, the education system consists of [[K-12]] curricula. In addition to this standard educational
setting, adult education programs are also environments in which individuals
can develop traditional literacy skills founded in comprehension and real-world
application of knowledge via reading and writing.  Tools for educational development provided by
these systems impact an individual's capacity to obtain specific knowledge
regarding health. Reflecting components of traditional literacy such as
cultural and conceptual knowledge, oral literacy (listening and speaking,)
print literacy (reading and writing,) and numeracy, education systems are also
potential intervention points for health literacy development.

=== Development of a health literacy program ===
A successful health literacy program will have many goals that all work together to improve health literacy. Many people assume these goals should communicate health information to the general public, however in order to be successful the goals should not only communicate with people but also take into account social and environmental factors that influence lifestyle choices.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nutbeam|first=D.|date=2000-09-01|title=Health literacy as a public health goal: a challenge for contemporary health education and communication strategies into the 21st century|url=https://academic.oup.com/heapro/article/15/3/259/551108/Health-literacy-as-a-public-health-goal-a|journal=Health Promotion International|language=en|volume=15|issue=3|pages=259–267|doi=10.1093/heapro/15.3.259|issn=0957-4824}}&lt;/ref&gt; A good example of this is the movement to end smoking. When a health literacy program is put into place where only the negative side effects of smoking are told to the general public it is doomed to fail. However, when there is a larger program put in – one that includes strategies outlining how to quit smoking, raises tobacco prices, reduces access to tobacco by minors, and reflect social a social unacceptability of smoking – it will be much more effective.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services suggests a National Action Plan to implement a comprehensive Health Literacy Program. They include 7 goals:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|first=Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion|date=2010|title=National Action Plan to Improve Health Literacy|url=https://health.gov/communication/hlactionplan/pdf/Health_Literacy_Action_Plan.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Develop and disseminate health and safety information that is accurate, accessible, and actionable
# Promote changes in the health care system that improve health information, communication, informed decision making, and access to health services
# Incorporate accurate, standards-based, and developmentally appropriate health and science information and curricula in child care and education through the university level
# Support and expand local efforts to provide adult education, English language instruction, and culturally and linguistically appropriate health information services in the community
# Build partnerships, develop guidance, and change policies
# Increase basic research and the development, implementation, and evaluation of practices and interventions to improve health literacy
# Increase the dissemination and use of evidence-based health literacy practices and interventions
These goals should be taken into account when implementing a health literacy program.

There are also goals for the outcomes of a Health Literacy Program.

''Health Related Goals''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Promoting and protect health and prevent disease
* Understand, interpret, and analyze health information
* Apply health information over a variety of life events and situations
* Navigate the healthcare system 
* Actively participate in encounters with healthcare professionals and workers
* Understand and give consent
* Understand and advocate for rights

===Libraries===
Libraries have increasingly recognised that they can play a role in health literacy since the 2000s, influenced by the [[Medical Library Association]].  Library initiatives have included running education programs, fostering partnerships with health organisations, and using outreach efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=13 June 2016|title=Health literacy and libraries: a literature review|journal=[[Reference Services Review]]|volume=44|issue=2|pages=191–205|doi=10.1108/RSR-02-2016-0005|last1=Barr-Walker|first1=Jill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1724">'''Heatwork''' is the combined effect of temperature and time. It is important to several industries:

*[[Ceramic]]s
*Glass and metal [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]]
*Metal [[heat treating]]

[[Pyrometric device]]s can be used to gauge heat work as they deform or contract due to heatwork to produce temperature equivalents. Within tolerances, firing can be undertaken at lower temperatures for a longer period to achieve comparable results. When the amount of heatwork of two firings is the same, the pieces may look identical, but there may be differences not visible, such as mechanical strength and [[microstructure]]. Heatwork is taught in material science courses, but is not a precise measurement or a valid scientific concept.

The '''Istituto Affari Internazionali (IAI)''' (English: Institute of International Affairs) is an Italian non-profit organization founded in 1965 by [[Altiero Spinelli]], its first director, thanks to joint contributions from the Fondazione Olivetti, the cultural and political association Il Mulino and the Nord e Sud Research Center, as well as to substantial support from the [[Ford Foundation]]. Spinelli took North American and British [[think tanks]] as a model: he created a flexible private organization, distinct from university institutes and governmental or ministerial research centers, yet capable of inter-acting and cooperating with the government, the public administration, national economic actors and foreign academic centers. These are still the IAI's outstanding features today.

In 1991 the Institute moved to Palazzo Rondinini, an elegant eighteenth century building in the heart of [[Rome]]. Many of the activities organized by the Institute take place in its [[Baroque]] ceremonial rooms. The Institute's main objective is to promote an understanding of the problems of international politics through studies, research, training, meetings and publications, with the aim of increasing the opportunities of all countries to move in the direction of supranational organization, democratic freedom and social justice (IAI Statute, Article 1).&lt;ref name="IAI Statute"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iai.it/sites/default/files/statute2014.pdf |title=IAI Statute |publisher=Istituto Affari Internazionali |date= |accessdate=May 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

Research focuses on the following thematic areas:
*	[[European Union]], politics and institutions
*	Global actors ([[United States]], [[Latin America]], [[Asia]], [[Africa]])
*	[[Eastern Europe]] and [[Eurasia]] ([[Turkey]], [[Balkans]], [[Caucasus]], [[Ukraine]])
*	[[Mediterranean]] and [[Middle East]]
*	[[Security]] and [[Military science|defence]]
*	[[Energy development|Energy]] and [[Climate change|climate]]
*	[[Multilateralism]] and [[global governance]] ([[international political economy]], [[WTO]], [[G7]])
*	[[Foreign relations of Italy|Italy's foreign policy]]
*	[[Emerging technologies|Technology]] and [[international relations]]

The research staff is made up of nearly 40 researchers, including area or project directors. Most of the research projects are carried out together with other institutes with similar characteristics.

The Institute is an active participant in – and has sometimes even been a promoter of – important transnational research networks:
*	Council of Councils&lt;ref&gt; Council of Councils [http://www.cfr.org/councilofcouncils] &lt;/ref&gt;
*	EuroMeSCo (EuroMediterranean Study Commission)&lt;ref&gt; EuroMeSCo [http://www.euromesco.net] &lt;/ref&gt;
*	ETTG (European Think Tanks Group)&lt;ref&gt; ETTG [https://ettg.eu] &lt;/ref&gt;
*	New-Med (OSCE New-Med Track II Network)&lt;ref&gt; New-Med [http://www.osce.org/networks/newmedtrackII] &lt;/ref&gt;
*	[[TEPSA]] (Trans European Policy Studies Association)&lt;ref&gt; TEPSA [http://tepsa.be] &lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==

* '''The International Spectator''', a peer reviewed English-language foreign policy quarterly, published by Routledge (Taylor &amp; Francis Group)&lt;ref&gt; Routledge [http://www.tandfonline.com/rspe] &lt;/ref&gt;
* '''IAI Research Papers''' and '''Quaderni IAI''', two series of books on problems of international affairs in either English or Italian&lt;ref&gt; IAI Research Papers [http://www.iai.it/en/pubblicazioni/lista/all/iai-research-papers] &lt;/ref&gt;

The '''MIT Center for Information Systems Research''' (CISR) is a research center at the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]] founded in 1974. MIT CISR's research focuses on the use of information technology and management in complex organizations. Its mission is to "develop concepts and frameworks to help executives address the IT-related challenges of leading increasingly dynamic, global, and information-intensive organizations."&lt;ref&gt;[http://cisr.mit.edu/about/our-mission/ Center for Information Systems Research: Our mission], 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center for Information Systems Research has done groundbreaking research in the areas of managerial computing, [[Executive information system|executive support systems]], [[critical success factor]]s, [[Corporate governance of information technology|IT governance]], [[IT portfolio management]], [[operating model]], and [[enterprise architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gardner|first=Dana|title=Enterprise Architecture and Transformation at the Crossroads|url=http://www.ecommercetimes.com/story/74616.html|work=E-Commerce News|publisher=ECT News Network, Inc.|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zaino|first=Jennifer|title=MIT's Jeanne Ross On Bringing Psych Skills To Enterprise Architecture|url=http://smartenterpriseexchange.com/groups/smart-architect/blog/2012/02/08/enterprise-architects-maybe-it-s-time-to-revisit-psych-101|work=Smart Enterprise Exchange|publisher=UBM TechWeb|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Center for Information Systems Research (CISR) was established in 1974 by the MIT Alfred P. Sloan School of Management. Its initial mission was described as: ''To conduct research on the effective use of computer-based [[information systems]], and in particular concern itself with helping [[Management|manager]]s deal with questions of information system effectiveness''.&lt;ref name="CISR 1974"&gt;Alfred P. Sloan School of Management, Center for Information Systems Research (1974) ''[https://openlibrary.org/books/OL17993694M/Statement_of_purpose_structure_and_research_goals. Statement of Purpose, Structure and Research Goals]''. REPORT CISR-1. SLOAN WP 749-74, November 1, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; Among its first scientists were [[John F. Rockart]], [[Norman Rasmussen]], [[Peter Chen]], [[John J. Donovan]], [[Stuart Madnick]], Henry D. Jacoby, Peter G.W. Keen, Charles B. Stabell, Steve Alter and Michael J. Ginzberg.&lt;ref name="CISR 1974"/&gt;

Over the years the Center for Information Systems Research has published a series of about 400 working papers, and has held many seminars and conferences. Together with other early IT research centers, such as the Management Information Systems Research Center at Minnesota (established in 1968), they helped to shape the young information systems discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Ives, Blake, Margrethe H. Olson, and Ron Weber. "Guest editorial: a valued institution builder: Gordon B. Davis." ''MIS Quarterly'' 29.3 (2005): v-xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first long standing director of the Center for Information Systems Research was [[John F. Rockart]], who managed the Center from 1976 to 2000; Professor [[Michael Scott Morton]] was the first director, from 1974 to 1976. He was succeeded by [[Peter Weill]], who was succeeded in 2008 by the current director [[Jeanne W. Ross]]. Peter Weill is currently the chairman of MIT CISR.

Other researchers and (former) faculty members associated with the Center for Information Systems Research are [[John F. Rockart]], [[Dale L. Goodhue]], [[Stuart Madnick]], [[JoAnne Yates]], [[Wanda Orlikowski]], [[Peter Weill]], [[Jeanne W. Ross]], [[Cynthia Beath]] and [[Shoshana Zuboff]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11936">{{short description|A pipeline or tunnel that discharges municipal or industrial wastewater, stormwater, combined sewer overflows, cooling water, or brine effluents from water desalination plants to the sea}}
A '''marine outfall''' is a pipeline or tunnel that discharges municipal or industrial [[wastewater]], [[stormwater]], [[combined sewer overflow]]s, [[cooling water]], or [[brine]] effluents from [[water desalination]] plants to the sea. Usually they discharge under the sea's surface (submarine outfall). In the case of municipal wastewater, effluent is often being discharged after having undergone no or only primary [[Wastewater treatment|treatment]], with the intention of using the assimilative capacity of the sea for further treatment. Submarine [[outfall]]s are common throughout the world and probably number in the thousands. More than 200 outfalls alone have been listed in a single international database maintained by the Institute for Hydromechanics at [[Karlsruhe University]] for the [[International Association of Hydraulic Engineering and Research]] (IAHR) / [[International Water Association]] (IWA) Committee on Marine Outfall Systems.&lt;ref name="Database"&gt;[http://www.outfalls.net.ms/ Outfalls Database] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080628233110/http://www.outfalls.net.ms/ |date=2008-06-28 }} Click on "Activities", then "Outfalls repository", then "database", then "Output"&lt;/ref&gt;

The World's first marine outfall was built in [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]], United States, in 1910. In Latin America and the Caribbean there were 134 outfalls with more than 500 m length in 2006 for wastewater disposal alone, according to a survey by the Pan American Center for Sanitary Engineering and Environmental Sciences (CEPIS) of [[Pan American Health Organization|PAHO]]. According to the survey, the largest number of municipal wastewater outfalls in the region exist in Venezuela (39), Chile (39) and Brazil (22).&lt;ref  name="Database"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The World's largest marine outfall is located in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bwsc.org/about_bwsc/systems/outfall_maps/outfall_maps.asp&lt;/ref&gt;Currently, Boston has approximately 235 miles of combined sewers and 37 active CSO outfalls. Lots of outfalls are simply known by a public used name, e.g. Boston Outfall.&lt;ref name="MWWD2002"&gt;[http://people.ufpr.br/~tobias.dhs/outfalls/download/MWWD2002-outfalls%20database%20and%20exchange.pdf OUTFALLS DATABASE AND INFORMATION EXCHANGE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150728014543/http://people.ufpr.br/~tobias.dhs/outfalls/download/MWWD2002-outfalls%20database%20and%20exchange.pdf |date=2015-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bwsc.org/ABOUT_BWSC/systems/outfall_maps/CSO_INNERHARBOR.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bwsc.org/ABOUT_BWSC/systems/outfall_maps/CSO_DORCHESTERBAY.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bwsc.org/ABOUT_BWSC/systems/outfall_maps/CSO_CHARLES.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages ==

According to the Australian engineer [[Sharon Beder]] the main advantages of marine outfalls for the discharge of wastewater are:
*the natural [[:wikt:dilution|dilution]] and [[Dispersion (chemistry)|dispersion]] of [[organic matter]], [[pathogens]] and other pollutants
*the ability to keep the sewage field submerged because of the depth at which the [[sewage]] is being released
*the greater die-off rate of pathogens due to the greater distance they will have to travel to shore.&lt;ref name="Beder"&gt;Beder, Sharon: [http://www.herinst.org/sbeder/sewage/phd.html From Pipe Dreams to Tunnel Vision: Engineering Decision-Making and Sydney's Sewerage System], Ph.D. Thesis, UNIVERSITY OF NEW SOUTH WALES, AUSTRALIA 1989, Chapter 8: The 'Science' and 'Metaphysics' of Submarine Outfalls&lt;/ref&gt;

They also tend to be less expensive than advanced wastewater treatment plants, using the natural assimilative capacity of the sea instead of energy-intensive treatment processes in a plant. For example, preliminary treatment of wastewater is sufficient with an effective outfall and diffuser. The costs of preliminary treatment are about one tenth that of secondary treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Philip JW Roberts:"Underwater and underused: The case of marine outfalls in wastewater disposal", in Water21, Magazine of the International Water Association, October 2010, pp. 22-26&lt;/ref&gt; Preliminary treatment also requires much less land than advanced wastewater treatment.

== Disadvantages ==

Marine outfalls for partially treated or untreated wastewater remain controversial. Still according to [[Sharon Beder]], the design calculation and computer models for pollution modeling have been criticized, arguing that dilution has been overemphasized and that other mechanisms work in the opposite direction, such as [[bioaccumulation]] of [[toxins]], [[sedimentation]] of [[sludge]] particles and [[Flocculation|agglomeration]] of sewage particles with [[Fat|grease]]. Accumulative mechanisms include slick formation, windrow formation, [[flocculate]] formation and agglomerated formation. Grease or wax can interfere with dispersion, so that bacteria and viruses could be carried to remote locations where the concentration of bacterial predators would be low and the die-off rate much lower.&lt;ref name="Beder"/&gt;

== Technology ==

Outfalls vary in diameter from as narrow as 15&amp;nbsp;cm to as wide as 8 m; the widest registered outfall in the world with 8 m diameter is located in [[Navia (Spain)]] for the discharge of industrial wastewater. Outfalls vary in length from 50 m to 55&amp;nbsp;km, the longest registered outfalls being the [[Boston]] outfall with a length of 16&amp;nbsp;km and an industrial outfall in [[Ankleshwar]] (India) with a length of 55&amp;nbsp;km. The depth of the deepest point of an outfall varies from 3 m to up to 60 m, the deepest registered outfall being located in [[Macuto, Vargas]] (Venezuela) for the discharge of untreated municipal wastewater.

Outfall materials include [[polyethylene]], [[stainless steel]], [[carbon steel]], [[glass-reinforced plastic]], [[reinforced concrete]], [[cast iron]] or tunnels through rock. Common installation methods for pipelines are float and sink, bottom pull and top pull.&lt;ref name="Database"/&gt;

== Controversies ==

In the 1960s the city of [[Sydney]] decided to build ocean sewage outfalls to discharge partially treated sewage 2–4&amp;nbsp;km offshore at a cost of US$ 300 million. In the late 1980s, however, the government promised to upgrade the coastal treatment plants so that sewage would be treated to at least secondary treatment standards before discharge into the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/sbeder/sewage/elephants.html Sharon Beder, 'Getting into Deep Water: Sydney's Extended Ocean Sewage Outfalls'] in Pam Scott, ed., A Herd of White Elephants: Australia's Science &amp; Technology Policy, Hale and Iremonger, Sydney, 1992, pp62-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

The submarine outfall in [[Cartagena, Colombia]] was financed with a loan by the [[World Bank]]. It was subsequently challenged by residents claiming that the wastewater caused damage to the marine environment and to fisheries. The case was taken up by the [[World Bank's Inspection Panel]], which contracted two independent three-dimensional modeling efforts in 2006. Both "confirmed that the 2.85km long submarine outfall (was) adequate."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2006/12/13/000020953_20061213134653/Rendered/INDEX/38182.txt World Bank Inspection Panel Progress Report on Cartagena Water Supply, Sewerage and Environmental Management Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

'''MesoHABSIM''' builds upon pre-existing physical habitat simulation models (e.g. PHABSIM) which is an essential component of the United States government's methods for establishing minimum [[stream flow]] requirements. 
MesoHABSIM is an augmentation of this system, designed during a restoration study of the [[Quinebaug River]].&lt;ref&gt;Northeast Instream Habitat Program. Northeast Instream Habitat Program – Quinbaug River 10 November. 2008. {{cite web |url=http://neihp.org/projects/quinebaug/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725063409/http://www.neihp.org/projects/quinebaug/index.htm |archivedate=25 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The changing spatial distributions of physical attributes of a river as a result of variations in flow and the biological responses of aquatic species to these changes, provide the basis for simulating the consequences of [[ecosystem]] alteration, and consequently the justification of restoration measures. MesoHABSIM modifies the data acquisition technique and analytical approach of similar models by changing the scale of resolution from micro- to meso-scales. Due to this increase in scale, the model takes variations in stream morphology along the river into account and allows for application in larger-scale projects.

== Data collection and analysis ==

Mesohabitat types are defined by their hydromorphological units (HMUs), such as pools and [[rapids]], [[geomorphology]], [[land cover]] and other [[hydrological]] characteristics. Mesohabitats are mapped under multiple flow conditions at extensive sites along the river. Fish data is collected in randomly distributed mesohabitats where habitat surveys are also conducted. This allows modeling of available fish habitat at a range of flows. Rating curves represent the changes in relative area of suitable habitat in response to flow and allow for the determination of habitat quantity at any given flow within the range of surveys. These rating curves can be developed for river units of any size allowing conclusions to be drawn about the suitability of channel patterns or habitat structures for various species of fish for specific sections as well as for the entire river. Rating curves can also be used to evaluate the benefits of various restoration measures on the entire fish community. In combination with hydrologic time series, rating curves are used to create Continuous Under Threshold (CUT) curves for the analysis of frequency, magnitude and duration of significant habitat events. The CUT curve technique described by Capra et al. (1995)&lt;ref&gt;Capra, H., B. Pascal, and Y. Souchon. 1995. A new tool to interpret magnitude and duration of fish habitat variations. Regulated Rivers: Research and Management. 10: 281–289.&lt;/ref&gt;  defines critical thresholds and determines what habitat variability and availability is necessary to support the target river [[fauna]]. CUT curves evaluate durations of unsuitable habitat under a specified threshold by comparing continuous durations in days under this threshold to the cumulative durations in the study period. A highly useful product of the CUT curves are reference tables that can be used to determine how long a given species can tolerate unsuitable conditions depending on its life stage.

== Results ==

To use physical habitat models to analyze and predict ecosystem potential, compositions must also be determined of the native fish community and a subset of species must be selected for model development. The development of a Reference Fish Community (RFC) is based on the Target Fish Community approach, described by Bain and Meixler (2000).&lt;ref&gt;Meixler. 2000. Defining a Target Fish Community for Planning and Evaluating Enhancement on the Quinebaug River in Massachusetts and Connecticut. Report for Quinebaug River Study Agencies. [[Cornell University]], Ithaca, NY&lt;/ref&gt; A comprehensive list of species is generated from literature sources and available regional data collected on relatively intact river reaches. The species are ranked on the basis of abundance in long-term fish collection data from multiple rivers of similar character. Securing habitat for naturally occurring [[dominant species (ecology)]] should preserve the most profound characteristics of the ecosystem, providing survival conditions for the majority of the aquatic community and therefore a reference for restoration efforts. The simplest way to create a river habitat model is therefore to select the five to ten highest ranking species for model development. It can then be assumed that community structure reflects habitat structure; therefore, the most common species should indicate the most common habitat. Since habitat availability forms the structure of aquatic fauna, the affinity between the structure of the river habitat and the structure of the fish community can be used as a measure of habitat quality.

The results of MesoHABSIM creates the framework for integrative analysis of many aspects of the ecosystem. It also allows managers to recreate reference conditions and evaluate possible instream and watershed restoration measures or alterations (such as dam removals or changes in water withdrawals). From the perspective of resource managers, it not only allows for quantitative measures of ecological integrity, but also creates a basis for making decisions where trade-offs between resource use and river restoration need to be considered.

'''Morphogenesis''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''morphê'' shape and ''genesis'' creation, literally, "beginning of the shape") is the [[biological process]] that causes an [[organism]] to develop its shape. It is one of three fundamental aspects of [[developmental biology]] along with the control of [[cell growth]] and [[cellular differentiation]], unified in [[evolutionary developmental biology]] (evo-devo).

The process controls the organized spatial distribution of cells during the [[Developmental biology|embryonic development]] of an [[organism]]. Morphogenesis can take place also in a mature organism, in [[cell culture]] or inside [[tumor cell]] masses. Morphogenesis also describes the development of [[unicellular]] life forms that do not have an embryonic stage in their life cycle, or describes the [[evolution]] of a body structure within a [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic group]].

Morphogenetic responses may be induced in organisms by [[hormone]]s, by environmental chemicals ranging from substances produced by other organisms to [[toxin|toxic chemicals]] or [[radioactive isotope|radionuclides]] released as pollutants, and other plants, or by mechanical stresses induced by spatial patterning of the cells.

==History==
{{further|evolutionary developmental biology#History}}

Some of the earliest ideas and mathematical descriptions on how physical processes and constraints affect biological growth, and hence [[natural patterns]] such as the [[spirals]] of [[phyllotaxis]], were written by [[D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson]] in his 1917 book ''[[On Growth and Form]]''&lt;ref name=Thompson1917&gt;{{cite book |year=1917 |author=Thompson, D'Arcy Wentworth |title=On Growth and Form |url=https://archive.org/stream/ongrowthform1917thom#page/n7/mode/2up |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Montell2008&gt;{{citation |date=5 December 2008 |author=Montell, Denise J |title=Morphogenetic Cell Movements: Diversity from Modular Mechanical Properties |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=322 |pages=1502–1505 |url=http://irb.chu-montpellier.fr/fr/PDF/DU2009-I/15-12-2008_Introduction_Publi_2.pdf |bibcode=2008Sci...322.1502M |doi=10.1126/science.1164073 |pmid=19056976}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref label|a|a|none}} and [[Alan Turing]] in his ''[[The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis]]'' (1952).&lt;ref name=Turing&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Turing | first= A. M. | title=The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis | journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B]] | volume=237 | pages=37–72 | year=1952 | doi=10.1098/rstb.1952.0012| issue=641| ref=harv |bibcode=1952RSPTB.237...37T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Where Thompson explained animal body shapes as being created by varying rates of growth in different directions, for instance to create the [[Gastropod shell|spiral shell]] of a [[snail]], Turing correctly predicted a mechanism of morphogenesis, the diffusion of two different chemical signals, one activating and one deactivating growth, to set up patterns of development, decades before the formation of such patterns was observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hiscock |first1=Tom W. |last2=Megason |first2=Sean G. |title=Orientation of Turing-like Patterns by Morphogen Gradients and Tissue Anisotropies |journal=Cell Systems |date=2015 |volume=1 |issue=6 |pages=408–416 |doi=10.1016/j.cels.2015.12.001 |url=http://www.cell.com/cell-systems/abstract/S2405-4712(15)00215-X|pmc=4707970 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fuller understanding of the mechanisms involved in actual organisms required the discovery of the structure of [[DNA]] in 1953, and the development of [[molecular biology]] and [[biochemistry]].

==Genetic and molecular basis==
[[File:Gap gene expression.svg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Evolutionary developmental biology|Morphogenesis is controlled]] by a [[evo-devo gene toolkit|"toolkit" of genes]] which switch development on and off at precise times and places. Here, [[gap gene]]s in the fruit fly are switched on by genes such as ''[[bicoid]]'', setting up stripes which create the body's segmental form.]]
{{further|evolutionary developmental biology|transcription factor|gene regulatory network}}

Several types of molecules are important in morphogenesis. [[Morphogen]]s are soluble molecules that can diffuse and carry signals that control cell differentiation via concentration gradients. Morphogens typically act through binding to specific protein [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s. An important class of molecules involved in morphogenesis are [[transcription factor]] proteins that determine the fate of cells by interacting with [[DNA]]. These can be coded for by master regulatory [[gene]]s, and either activate or deactivate the [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of other genes; in turn, these secondary gene products can regulate the expression of still other genes in a regulatory cascade of [[gene regulatory network]]s. At the end of this cascade are classes of molecules that control cellular behaviors such as [[cell migration]], or, more generally, their properties, such as [[cell adhesion]] or cell contractility. For example, during [[gastrulation]], clumps of [[stem cell]]s switch off their cell-to-cell adhesion, become migratory, and take up new positions within an embryo where they again activate specific cell adhesion proteins and form new tissues and organs. Developmental signaling pathways implicated in morphogenesis include Wnt, [[Hedgehog signaling pathway|Hedgehog]], and ephrins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kouros-Mehr |first=H. |author2=Werb, Z.|title=Candidate regulators of mammary branching morphogenesis identified by genome-wide transcript analysis |journal=Dev. Dyn. |year=2006 |volume=235 |issue=12 |pages=3404–12 |pmid=17039550 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dvdy.20978/abstract;jsessionid=D75C4FD14C482BF9B054F966403A15B4.d03t02 |doi=10.1002/dvdy.20978 |pmc=2730892}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cellular basis==

[[File:P19 cell sorting out.png|thumb|upright|Cell sorting out with cultured [[P19 cell|P19 embryonal carcinoma cells]]. Live cells were stained with [[DiI]] (red) or DiO (green). The red cells were [[Genetic engineering|genetically altered]] and express higher levels of [[E-cadherin]] than the green cells. The mixed culture forms large multi-cellular aggregates.]]

At a tissue level, ignoring the means of control, morphogenesis arises because of cellular proliferation and motility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Montévil |first=Maël|last2=Speroni |first2=Lucia |last3=Sonnenschein |first3=Carlos |last4=Soto |first4=Ana M. |date=2016 |title=Modeling mammary organogenesis from biological first principles: Cells and their physical constraints|url=https://www.academia.edu/27958448/Modeling_mammary_organogenesis_from_biological_first_principles_cells_and_their_physical_constraints|journal=Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology |series=From the Century of the Genome to the Century of the Organism: New Theoretical Approaches |volume=122 |issue=1 |pages=58–69 |doi=10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2016.08.004 |pmid=27544910|pmc=5563449 |arxiv=1702.03337 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Morphogenesis also involves changes in the cellular structure or how cells interact in tissues. These changes can result in tissue elongation, thinning, folding, invasion or separation of one tissue into distinct layers. The latter case is often referred as [[cell sorting]]. Cell "sorting out" consists of cells moving so as to sort into clusters that maximize contact between cells of the same type. The ability of cells to do this has been proposed to arise from differential cell adhesion by [[Malcolm Steinberg]] through his [[Differential Adhesion Hypothesis]]. Tissue separation can also occur via more dramatic [[cellular differentiation]] events during which epithelial cells become mesenchymal (see [[Epithelial-mesenchymal transition]]). Mesenchymal cells typically leave the epithelial tissue as a consequence of changes in cell adhesive and contractile properties. Following epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cells can migrate away from an epithelium and then associate with other similar cells in a new location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gilbert, Scott F. |title=Developmental biology |publisher=Sinauer Associates |location=Sunderland, Mass |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=0-87893-243-7 |edition=6th |chapter=Morphogenesis and Cell Adhesion |chapterurl=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?highlight=morphogenesis&amp;rid=dbio.section.372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cell-cell adhesion===
During embryonic development, cells are restricted to different layers due to differential affinities. One of the ways this can occur is when cells share the same cell-to-cell [[adhesion]] molecules. For instance, homotypic cell adhesion can maintain boundaries between groups of cells that have different adhesion molecules. Furthermore, cells can sort based upon differences in adhesion between the cells, so even two populations of cells with different levels of the same adhesion molecule can sort out. In [[cell culture]] cells that have the strongest adhesion move to the center of a mixed aggregates of cells. Moreover, cell-cell adhesion is often modulated by cell contractility, which can exert forces on the cell-cell contacts so that two cell populations with equal levels of the same adhesion molecule can sort out. The molecules responsible for adhesion are called cell adhesion molecules (CAMs). Several types of cell adhesion molecules are known and one major class of these molecules are [[cadherins]]. There are dozens of different cadherins that are expressed on different cell types. Cadherins bind to other cadherins in a like-to-like manner: E-cadherin (found on many epithelial cells) binds preferentially to other E-cadherin molecules. Mesenchymal cells usually express other cadherin types such as N-cadherin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Hulpiau, P.; van Roy, F. |title=Molecular evolution of the cadherin superfamily |journal=Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=349–69 |date=February 2009 |pmid=18848899 |doi=10.1016/j.biocel.2008.09.027}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Angst, B.; Marcozzi, C.; Magee, A. |title=The cadherin superfamily: diversity in form and function |journal=J Cell Sci |volume=114 |issue=Pt 4 |pages=629–41 |date=February 2001 |pmid=11171368}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extracellular matrix===
The [[extracellular matrix]] (ECM) is involved in keeping tissues separated, providing structural support or providing a structure for cells to migrate on. [[Collagen]], [[laminin]], and [[fibronectin]] are major ECM molecules that are secreted and assembled into sheets, fibers, and gels. Multisubunit transmembrane receptors called [[integrin]]s are used to bind to the ECM. Integrins bind extracellularly to fibronectin, laminin, or other ECM components, and intracellularly to [[microfilament]]-binding proteins [[ACTN1|α-actinin]] and [[talin (protein)|talin]] to link the [[cytoskeleton]] with the outside. Integrins also serve as receptors to trigger [[signal transduction]] cascades when binding to the ECM. A well-studied example of morphogenesis that involves ECM is [[mammary gland]] ductal branching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fata JE, Werb Z, Bissell MJ |title=Regulation of mammary gland branching morphogenesis by the extracellular matrix and its remodeling enzymes |journal=Breast Cancer Res. |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=1–11 |year=2004 |pmid=14680479 |pmc=314442 |doi=10.1186/bcr634 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sternlicht MD |title=Key stages in mammary gland development: the cues that regulate ductal branching morphogenesis |journal=Breast Cancer Res. |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=201 |year=2006 |pmid=16524451 |pmc=1413974 |doi=10.1186/bcr1368 |url=http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/8/1/201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cell contractility===
Tissues can change their shape and separate into distinct layers via cell contractility. Just as in muscle cells, [[myosin]] can contract different parts of the cytoplasm to change its shape or structure. Myosin-driven contractility in embryonic tissue morphogenesis is seen during the separation of [[germ layers]] in the [[model organism]]s ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'', ''[[Drosophila]]'' and [[zebrafish]]. There are often periodic pulses of contraction in embryonic morphogenesis. A model called the cell state splitter involves alternating cell contraction and expansion, initiated by a bistable organelle at the apical end of each cell. The organelle consists of [[microtubules]] and [[microfilaments]] in mechanical opposition. It responds to local mechanical perturbations caused by morphogenetic movements. These then trigger traveling [[embryonic differentiation waves]] of contraction or expansion over presumptive tissues that determine cell type and is followed by cell differentiation. The cell state splitter was first proposed to explain [[neural plate]] morphogenesis during [[gastrulation]] of the [[axolotl]]&lt;ref&gt;Gordon R, Brodland GW. [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02797122 The cytoskeletal mechanics of brain morphogenesis. Cell state splitters cause primary neural induction.] Cell Biophys. 1987 Dec;11:177-238.&lt;/ref&gt; and the model was later generalized to all of morphogenesis.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, NK,Gordon,R.

==Cancer morphogenesis==
[[Cancer]] can result from disruption of normal morphogenesis, including both tumor formation and tumor [[metastasis]].&lt;ref name="pmid18988924"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Fosslien E | title=Cancer morphogenesis: role of mitochondrial failure | journal= [[Annals of Clinical &amp; Laboratory Science]] | volume=38 | issue=4 | pages=307–329 | year=2008 | url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/46f0/82429de96d81a47589aa0c84b3ad68517cbd.pdf  | PMID = 18988924 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mitochondrion|Mitochondrial]] dysfunction can result in increased cancer risk due to disturbed morphogen signaling.&lt;ref name="pmid18988924" /&gt;

'''''{{lang|en|Multimodal Architecture and Interfaces}}''''' is an [[open standard]] developed by the [[W3C|World Wide Web Consortium]] since 2005. It was published as a [[W3C recommendation#Recommendation .28WD.29|Recommendation]] of the W3C on October 25, 2012. The document is a [[Specification (technical standard)|technical report specifying]] a multimodal [[system architecture]] and its generic [[Software interface|interfaces]] to facilitate integration and [[multimodal interaction]] management in a computer  system. It has been developed by the  W3C's [[W3C MMI|Multimodal Interaction Working Group]].

==Description==
[[Image:MMI-Modalites.png|thumb|A multimodal architecture|250px|left]]
The ''Multimodal Architecture and Interfaces'' recommendation introduces a generic structure and a communication protocol to allow the modules in a [[Multimodal interaction|multimodal]] system to communicate with each other.

This specification proposes an [[event-driven architecture]] as a general frame of reference focused in the [[control flow]] data exchange. It can be used to determine the basic infrastructures needed to command the application's multimodal services.

The architecture is also proposed to facilitate the task of implementing several types of multimodal services providers on multiple devices: mobile devices and cell phones, [[Domestic technology|home appliances]], [[Internet of Things]] objects, television and home networks, enterprise applications, web applications,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=RAGGETT, Dave. |author2=FROUMENTIN, Max.  |author3=HOSCHKA, Philipp.  |year=2004|title=Towards Multimodal Web Interaction|url =http://www.springerlink.com/content/m875422005157930/|journal=Building the Information Society |volume=156|publisher=Springer Boston|pages=133–138|accessdate=2011-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[intelligent car|"smart" cars]] or on medical devices and applications.

===Logical structure===
[[Image:MMI-Framework.png|thumb|The MMI Architecture in the MMI Runtime Framework|250px|left]]
''Multimodal Architecture and Interfaces'' is the specified description of a larger services infrastructure called [http://www.w3.org/TR/mmi-framework/ The Runtime Framework] which provides the main functions that a multimodal system can need. This framework is at a higher level of abstraction than the MMI architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.larson-tech.com/Writings/multimodal.pdf|title=Standard Languages for Developing Multimodal Applications |author=James A. LARSON |date=22 February 2005|publisher=Larson Technical Services|accessdate=2011-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.w3.org/TR/mmi-framework/ The MMI Runtime Framework] is the [[Runtime system|runtime support]] and communication modules of the multimodal system  while MMI Architecture is the description and the specification of its main modules, its interfaces and its communication modes.

[[Image:MMI-MVC.png|thumb|The MVC design pattern in the MMI Architecture|250px|right]]
The ''Multimodal Architecture and Interfaces'' specification is based on the [[Model–view–controller|MVC]] design pattern, that proposes to organize the [[user interface]] structure in three parts: the ''Model'', the ''View'' and the ''Controller''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/web/library/wa-multimodarch1/#N1011B|title=The W3C Multimodal Architecture, Part 1: Overview and challenges. What you should know about the emerging architecture for distributed multimodal applications|author=Gerald MCCOBB |date=8 May 2007|publisher=[[IBM]]|accessdate=2011-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This design pattern is also shown by the Data-Flow-Presentation architecture from the Voice Browser Working Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/Voice/2006/DFP|title=The Voice Browser DFP Framework|author=VBWG|date=8 Feb 2006|publisher=[[w3.org]]|accessdate=2011-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:MMI-RusianDoll.png|thumb|Recursion in the MMI Architecture|250px|right]]
A particularity of this architecture is that although the presentation layer represented by the''View'' has traditionally been associated with [[Graphical user interface|graphical interfaces]]; this recommendation abstraction generalizes the ''View'' to the broader context of the [[multimodal interaction]], where the user can use a combination of visual, auditory, biometric and / or tactile modalities.

The MMI Architecture recommendation distinguishes three types of components: the '''''Interaction Manager''''' – IM, the '''''Data Component''''' – DC and the '''''[[Modality (human-computer interaction)|Modality]] Components''''' – MC. This distinction is similar to the separation between the ''Controller'', the ''Model'' and the presentation documents of the ''View'' in the MVC pattern.

Another characteristic is [[Recursion (computer science)|recursion]]. The modules are black boxes and it is possible to encapsulate several components in a more complex component, which communicate with an '''''Interaction Manager''''' at a higher level. In this way, the architecture follows [[Nested hierarchy#Nested hierarchy|the nested dolls principle]] .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= Patrizia |last=GRIFONI|year=2009|title=Multimodal Human Computer Interaction and Pervasive Services  |publisher=IGI Global|isbn=1-60566-386-7|pages=538}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The specification also covers the issues of a [[Distributed computing|distributed]] implementation on multiple material resources in a network or a [[Centralized computing|centralized]] implementation, with all the modules installed in a single material support. Information sharing between modules is [[Loose coupling|loose coupled]]. This promotes low dependence between modules, reducing the impact of changes in one module on other modules, and facilitating the modules' reuse. In this way, the modules have little or no knowledge of the functioning of any other modules and the communication between modules is done through the exchange of messages following a precise [[communication protocol]] provided by the architecture's [[API]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.conversational-technologies.com/images/Distributed_Multimodality_in_the_W3C_Multimodal_Architecture.pdf|title=Distributed Multimodality in the W3C Multimodal Architecture|author=Deborah DAHL |date=26 April 2010|publisher=Conversational Technologies|accessdate=2011-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The MMI architecture modules ==
[[Image:MMI-Modules.png|thumb|MMI Architecture Modules|250px|right]]

===The interaction manager===
The  interaction manager is a logical component, responsible for all message exchanges between the components of the system and the multimodal [http://www.w3.org/TR/mmi-framework/ Runtime Framework]. It is a [[Bus (computing)|communication bus]] and also an [[Event (computing)|event handler]].

Each application can configure at least one Interaction Manager to define the required interaction logic. This controller is the core of the multimodal interaction:
* It manages the specific behaviors triggered by the events exchanged between the various input and output components.
* It manages the communication between the modules and the [[Client (computing)|client application]].
* It ensures consistency between multiple inputs and outputs and provides a general perception of the application's current status.
* It is responsible for data synchronization.
* It is responsible for [[Focus (computing)|focus]] management.
* It manages communication with any other entity outside the system.

===The modality components===
The modality components are responsible for specific tasks, including handling inputs and outputs in various ways, such as speech, writing, video, etc..

These are logical entities that handles the input and output of different hardware devices (microphone, graphic tablet, keyboard) and software services (motion detection, biometric changes) associated with the multimodal system. For example, (see figure below), a modality component '''&lt;big&gt;A&lt;/big&gt;''' can be charged at the same time of the speech recognition and the audio input management. Another modality component '''&lt;big&gt;B&lt;/big&gt;''' can manage the complementary command inputs on two different devices: a graphics tablet and a microphone. Two modality components '''&lt;big&gt;C&lt;/big&gt;''', can manage separately two complementary inputs given by a single device: a camcorder. And finally, a modality component '''&lt;big&gt;D&lt;/big&gt;''', can use an external recognition web service and only be responsible for the control of communication exchanges needed for the recognition task.

[[Image:MMI-MC.png|thumb|Input abstraction in the modality components|1094px|center]]
In all four cases the system has a generic modality component for the detection of a voice command input, despite the differences in implementation. Any modality component can potentially wrap multiple features provided by multiple physical devices but also more than one modality component could be included in a single device. To this extent the modality component is an abstraction of the same kind of input handled and implemented differently in each case.

For this reason, the W3C recommendation currently does not describe in detail the structure or implementation of the modality components. It focuses only on the need of a communication interface with the Interaction Manager and the need of an implementation that follows a specific [[communication protocol]]: the [http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-mmi-arch-20110125/#LifeCycleEvents Life-Cycle Events].

[[Image:MMI-DC cases.png|thumb|Public and private data component|250px|right]]

===The data component===
The data component's primary role is to save the public data of the application that may be required by one or several modality components or by other modules (e.g., the [http://www.w3.org/TR/mmi-framework/ Framework's] session module).

The data component can be an internal module '''&lt;big&gt;A&lt;/big&gt;''' or an external module '''&lt;big&gt;B&lt;/big&gt;''' to the Interaction Manager (see Figure). This depends on the implementation chosen by each application. However, the Interaction Manager is the only module that has direct access to the Data Component and only the Interaction Manager can view and edit the data and communicate with external servers if necessary. As a result, the Modality Components must use the Interaction Manager as an intermediary to access the public data of the multimodal application.

However, for the storage of private data, each Modality Component can implement its own Data Component. This private Data Component can also access external servers '''&lt;big&gt;B&lt;/big&gt;''' (see Figure) and keep the data that the Modality Component may require, for example, in the speech recognition task. This can be the case of an implementation following the principle of nested dolls given by the MMI architecture recommendation.

==Communication protocol between different modules==
In the MMI architecture, the [[communication protocol]] is [[Asynchronous system|asynchronous]], bi-directional and based on the exchange of [[event notification]]s that are raised by the system following a user action or some internal activity.

This protocol defines the exchange mode and how to establish and end the communication between modules. In the case of this specification, it is reflected in the [http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-mmi-arch-20110125/#LifeCycleEvents Life-Cycle Events]. These are six standard control events that are proposed for controlling devices and material services (such as a video player or a sound reproduction device) and two notifications proposed for monitoring the current status of the multimodal system.
[[Image:MMI-Events.png|thumb|The MMI Life-Cycle Events|250px|right]]

=== The Standard Life-Cycle Events ===
The specification recommends eight standard Life-Cycle Events specified as pairs of Request &gt; Response exchanges:
* '''NewContext''' ( [http://www.w3.org/TR/mmi-arch/#d3e638 NewContextRequest / NewContextResponse] )
:Indicates the creation of a cycle of interaction (context) between zero, one or more users with one or multiple modality components. The context is the longest period of interaction in which the modules must keep the information available.
:The context is associated with the semantics of the user's and system's activity during the interaction cycle. This allows to the implementation decide whether to keeping the information still makes sense for the execution of the current activity.
:Usually the context is created from user input. The event is normally sent by one or more modality components to the interaction manager that must answer the query.
:For example, a modality component responsible for managing the inputs associated with the finger gesture ( touchmove ) in a web page viewed on a touch screen. At the beginning of the physical interaction, the modality component will send the query:
&lt;div style="margin-left:2%;width:98%;"&gt;
&lt;source lang="xml" enclose="div"&gt;
&lt;mmi:mmi xmlns:mmi="http://www.w3.org/2008/04/mmi-arch" version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;mmi:newContextRequest requestID="myReq1" source="myPointerMC.php" target="myIM.php" data="myMCStatus.xml" /&gt;
&lt;/mmi:mmi&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
:At this request the Interaction Manager will respond:
&lt;div style="margin-left:2%;width:98%;"&gt;
&lt;source lang="xml" enclose="div"&gt;
&lt;mmi:mmi xmlns:mmi="http://www.w3.org/2008/04/mmi-arch" version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;mmi:newContextResponse requestID="myReq1" source="myIM.php" target="myPointerMC.php" context="myContextID1" status="success" /&gt;
&lt;/mmi:mmi&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
:It is also possible that the Interaction Manager is at the origin of the request. In this case the syntax remains the same but the value of '''''source''''' and '''''target''''' properties must change.

* '''ClearContext''' ( [http://www.w3.org/TR/mmi-arch/#d3e1576 ClearContextRequest / ClearContextResponse] )
:Sent by the interaction manager, the event marks the end of the cycle of interaction (context) and request the freed of the resources that were allocated to the current interaction context. The ClearContext event may be associated with the end of user or system activity. For example:
&lt;div style="margin-left:2%;width:98%;"&gt;
&lt;source lang="xml" enclose="div"&gt;
&lt;mmi:mmi xmlns:mmi="http://www.w3.org/2008/04/mmi-arch" version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;mmi:clearContextRequest requestID="myReq2" source="myPointerMC.php" target="myIM.php" context="myContextID1" /&gt;
&lt;/mmi:mmi&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
:Upon receipt the request, the modality component may give as an answer:
&lt;div style="margin-left:2%;width:98%;"&gt;
&lt;source lang="xml" enclose="div"&gt;
&lt;mmi:mmi xmlns:mmi="http://www.w3.org/2008/04/mmi-arch" version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;mmi:clearContextResponse requestID="myReq2" source="myPointerMC.php" target="myIM.php" context="myContextID1" status="success" /&gt;
&lt;/mmi:mmi&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
* '''Prepare''' ( [http://www.w3.org/TR/mmi-arch/#d3e753 PrepareRequest / PrepareResponse] )
:Sent by the interaction manager, this event control signals to the modality component that it must be prepared to start its task and that it can load data that will be required to perform its work. For example:
&lt;div style="margin-left:2%;width:98%;"&gt;
&lt;source lang="xml" enclose="div"&gt;
&lt;mmi:mmi xmlns:mmi="http://www.w3.org/2008/04/mmi-arch" version="1.0" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;
&lt;mmi:prepareRequest requestID="myReq3" source="myIM.php" target="myDisplayMC.php" context="myContextID2" &gt;
&lt;mmi:content&gt;
&lt;svg:svg width="100%" height="100%" version="1.1"&gt;
&lt;rect width="300" height="100" style="fill:rgb(0,0,255);stroke-width:1; stroke:rgb(0,0,0)"/&gt;
&lt;/svg:svg&gt;
&lt;/mmi:content&gt;
&lt;/mmi:prepareRequest&gt;
&lt;/mmi:mmi&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
:If there are multiple documents or data to be loaded during the preparation phase, the Interaction Manager could trigger the PrepareRequest event several times without starting the task after each request. Nevertheless, each request call must be answered. In our example, if the content has been properly preloaded the answer is:
&lt;div style="margin-left:2%;width:98%;"&gt;
&lt;source lang="xml" enclose="div"&gt;
&lt;mmi:mmi xmlns:mmi="http://www.w3.org/2008/04/mmi-arch" version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;mmi:prepareResponse requestID="myReq3" source="myDisplayMC.php" target="myIM.php" status="success" context="myContextID2"&gt;
&lt;/mmi:prepareResponse&gt;
&lt;/mmi:mmi&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
* '''Start''' ( [http://www.w3.org/TR/mmi-arch/#StartRequest StartRequest / StartResponse] )
:Sent by the Interaction Manager this control event signals to the Modality Component that it may start its task. For example:
&lt;div style="margin-left:2%;width:98%;"&gt;
&lt;source lang="xml" enclose="div"&gt;
&lt;mmi:mmi xmlns:mmi="http://www.w3.org/2008/04/mmi-arch" version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;mmi:startRequest requestID="myReq4" source="myIM.php" target="myPlayerMC.php" context="myContextID3" data="myPlayerParams.xml"&gt;
&lt;mmi:contentURL href="myAnimation.swf"/&gt;
&lt;/mmi:startRequest&gt;
&lt;/mmi:mmi&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
:If during the execution of its work the Modality Component receives a new StartRequest event it may either start the new task, or report the failure. In the case of a successful execution the answer must be:
&lt;div style="margin-left:2%;width:98%;"&gt;
&lt;source lang="xml" enclose="div"&gt;
&lt;mmi:mmi xmlns:mmi="http://www.w3.org/2008/04/mmi-arch" version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;mmi:startResponse requestID="myReq4" source="myPlayerMC.php" target="myIM.php" status="success" context="myContextID3"&gt;
&lt;/mmi:startResponse&gt;
&lt;/mmi:mmi&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
:In the case of a failure, the response may be for example:
&lt;div style="margin-left:2%;width:98%;"&gt;
&lt;source lang="xml" enclose="div"&gt;
&lt;mmi:mmi xmlns:mmi="http://www.w3.org/2008/04/mmi-arch" version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;mmi:startResponse requestID="myReq4" source="myPlayerMC.php" target="myIM.php" status="failure" context="myContextID3"&gt;
&lt;mmi:statusInfo&gt;
NoContent
&lt;/mmi:statusInfo&gt;
&lt;/mmi:startResponse&gt;
&lt;/mmi:mmi&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
* '''Cancel''' ( [http://www.w3.org/TR/mmi-arch/#d3e1132 CancelRequest / CancelResponse] )
:Sent by the Interaction Manager, this control event signals to the Modality Component that it should stop its current task. For example:
&lt;div style="margin-left:2%;width:98%;"&gt;
&lt;source lang="xml" enclose="div"&gt;
&lt;mmi:mmi xmlns:mmi="http://www.w3.org/2008/04/mmi-arch" version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;mmi:cancelRequest requestID="myReq5" source="myIM.php" target="mySpokerMC.php" context="myContextID4" Immediate="true"/&gt;
&lt;/mmi:mmi&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
:The Modality Component response may be:
&lt;div style="margin-left:2%;width:98%;"&gt;
&lt;source lang="xml" enclose="div"&gt;
&lt;mmi:mmi xmlns:mmi="http://www.w3.org/2008/04/mmi-arch" version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;mmi:cancelResponse requestID="myReq5" source="mySpokerMC.php" target="myIM.php" context="myContextID4" status="success" data="myMCStatus.xml"/&gt;
&lt;/mmi:mmi&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
* '''Pause''' ( [http://www.w3.org/TR/mmi-arch/#d3e1257 PauseRequest / PauseResponse] )
:Sent by the Interaction Manager, this control event signals to the Modality Component that it must pause its current task. For example, the request for a Modality Component that manages the input of a graphics tablet may be:
&lt;div style="margin-left:2%;width:98%;"&gt;
&lt;source lang="xml" enclose="div"&gt;
&lt;mmi:mmi xmlns:mmi="http://www.w3.org/2008/04/mmi-arch" version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;mmi:pauseRequest requestID="myReq6" source="myIM.php" target="myWriterMC.php" context="myContextID5" immediate="false"/&gt;
&lt;/mmi:mmi&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
:And the response of the Modality Component may be:
&lt;div style="margin-left:2%;width:98%;"&gt;
&lt;source lang="xml" enclose="div"&gt;
&lt;mmi:mmi xmlns:mmi="http://www.w3.org/2008/04/mmi-arch" version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;mmi:pauseResponse requestID="myReq6" source="myWriterMC.php" target="myIM.php" context="myContextID5" status="success" data="myMCStatus.xml"/&gt;
&lt;/mmi:mmi&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
* '''Resume''' ( [http://www.w3.org/TR/mmi-arch/#d3e1385 ResumeRequest / ResumeResponse] )
:Sent by the Interaction Manager, this control event signals to the Modality Component that the task previously paused should resume:
&lt;div style="margin-left:2%;width:98%;"&gt;
&lt;source lang="xml" enclose="div"&gt;
&lt;mmi:mmi xmlns:mmi="http://www.w3.org/2008/04/mmi-arch" version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;mmi:resumeRequest requestID="myReq7" source="myIM.php" target="myWriterMC.php" context="myContextID5"/&gt;
&lt;/mmi:mmi&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
:The Modality Component's response may be:
&lt;div style="margin-left:2%;width:98%;"&gt;
&lt;source lang="xml" enclose="div"&gt;
&lt;mmi:mmi xmlns:mmi="http://www.w3.org/2008/04/mmi-arch" version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;mmi:resumeResponse requestID="myReq7" source="myWriterMC.php" target="myIM.php" context="myContextID5" status="success"/&gt;
&lt;/mmi:mmi&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
* '''Status''' ( [http://www.w3.org/TR/mmi-arch/#d3e1697 StatusRequest / StatusResponse] )
:It is sent either by the Interaction Manager or by the Modality Components. This event indicates whether the cycle of interaction is still running, that is, if the context is "alive". For example, a Modality Component may need to monitor the status of the system to stop a process in case of fault or standby. In this case, it may send to the Interaction Manager :
&lt;div style="margin-left:2%;width:98%;"&gt;
&lt;source lang="xml" enclose="div"&gt;
&lt;mmi:mmi xmlns:mmi="http://www.w3.org/2008/04/mmi-arch" version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;mmi:statusRequest requestID="myReq8" source="myRecorderMC.php" target="myIM.php" requestAutomaticUpdate="true" /&gt;
&lt;/mmi:mmi&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
:Given that the request don't have the '''''context''''' parameter, the controller should return the system or the host server status and not the status of the current interaction context. To this request, the Interaction Manager may respond:
&lt;div style="margin-left:2%;width:98%;"&gt;
&lt;source lang="xml" enclose="div"&gt;
&lt;mmi:mmi xmlns:mmi="http://www.w3.org/2008/04/mmi-arch" version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;mmi:statusResponse requestID="myReq8" source="myIM.php" target="myRecorderMC.php" status="alive" AutomaticUpdate="true" /&gt;
&lt;/mmi:mmi&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

=== The Notifications ===
The specification also recommends two types of notifications, which one, the Extension Notification, can contain control or command data to handle devices or material services. For this reason this notification is regarded like an exception, a standard control event that is not described as a pair Request &gt; Response (in a previous version it was called the [http://www.w3.org/TR/2006/WD-mmi-arch-20061211/#N103BB Data Event]). The two notifications are:
* '''Extension''' ( [http://www.w3.org/TR/mmi-arch/#d3e1515 ExtensionNotification] )
:This event is used to communicate application-specific control data or any other needed data. It can be generated  either by the Interaction Manager or by a Modality Component. It ensures the [[extensibility]] of the architecture by giving a generic API dedicated to the application-specific needs. For example, a Modality Component that handles a DVD player may indicate to the system an interaction with the DVD's main menu:

[[File:Optoisolator Pinout.svg|thumb|right|Schematic diagram of an opto-isolator showing source of light (LED) on the left, dielectric barrier in the center, and sensor (phototransistor) on the right.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Real-world schematic diagrams omit the barrier symbol, and use a single set of directional arrows.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

An '''opto-isolator''' (also called an '''optocoupler''', '''photocoupler''', or '''optical isolator''') is an [[electronic component]] that transfers electrical [[Signal|signals]] between two isolated circuits by using light.&lt;ref&gt;Graf, p. 522.&lt;/ref&gt; Opto-isolators prevent [[high voltage]]s from affecting the system receiving the signal.&lt;ref name=L2&gt;Lee et al., p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Commercially available opto-isolators withstand input-to-output voltages up to 10&amp;nbsp;[[Volt|kV]]&lt;ref name=H145&gt;Hasse, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; and voltage transients with speeds up to 25&amp;nbsp;kV/[[microsecond|μs]].&lt;ref name=J279&gt;Joffe and Kai-Sang Lock, p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt;

A common type of opto-isolator consists of an [[Light emitting diode|LED]] and a [[phototransistor]] in the same opaque package. Other types of source-sensor combinations include LED-[[photodiode]], LED-[[thyristor#photothyristors|LASCR]], and [[lamp (electrical component)|lamp]]-[[photoresistor]] pairs. Usually opto-isolators transfer digital (on-off) signals, but some techniques allow them to be used with analog signals.

==History==
The value of optically coupling a solid state light emitter to a semiconductor detector for the purpose of electrical isolation was recognized in 1963 by Akmenkalns, et al. (US patent 3,417,249). Photoresistor-based opto-isolators were introduced in 1968. They are the slowest, but also the most [[linear#Electronics|linear]] isolators and still retain a niche market in the audio and music industries.  Commercialization of LED technology in 1968–1970 caused a boom in [[optoelectronics]], and by the end of the 1970s the industry developed all principal types of opto-isolators. The majority of opto-isolators on the market use bipolar silicon phototransistor sensors.&lt;ref&gt;Graf, p. 522; PerkinElmer, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; They attain medium data transfer speed, sufficient for applications like [[electroencephalography]].&lt;ref name=ANA&gt;See Ananthi, pp. 56, 62 for a practical example of an opto-coupled EEG application.&lt;/ref&gt; The fastest opto-isolators use [[PIN diode]]s in [[photodiode#Photoconductive mode|photoconductive mode]].

==Operation==
An opto-isolator contains a source (emitter) of light, almost always a [[infrared|near infrared]] [[light-emitting diode]] (LED), that converts electrical input signal into light, a closed optical channel (also called dielectrical channel&lt;ref name=M100/&gt;), and a [[photodetector|photosensor]], which detects incoming light and either generates electric [[energy]] directly, or [[modulation|modulates]] [[electric current]] flowing from an external power supply. The sensor can be a [[photoresistor]], a [[photodiode]], a [[phototransistor]], a [[silicon-controlled rectifier]] (SCR) or a [[TRIAC|triac]]. Because LEDs can sense light in addition to emitting it, construction of symmetrical, bidirectional opto-isolators is possible. An optocoupled [[solid-state relay]] contains a photodiode opto-isolator which drives a power switch, usually a complementary pair of [[MOSFET]]s. A [[slotted optical switch]] contains a source of light and a sensor, but its optical channel is open, allowing [[modulation]] of light by external objects obstructing the path of light or reflecting light into the sensor.

==Electric isolation==
[[File:Optoisolator topologies both.svg|thumb|right|Planar (top) and silicone dome (bottom) layouts - cross-section through a standard [[dual in-line package]]. Relative sizes of LED (red) and sensor (green) are exaggerated.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Based on conceptual drawings published by Basso and by Mims, p. 100. Real-world LEDs and sensors are much smaller; see the photograph in Avago, p. 3 for an example.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Electronic equipment and signal and power transmission lines can be subjected to voltage surges induced by [[lightning]], [[electrostatic discharge]], [[Electromagnetic interference|radio frequency transmissions]], switching pulses (spikes) and perturbations in power supply.&lt;ref name=H43&gt;Hasse, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Remote lightning strikes can induce surges up to 10&amp;nbsp;[[Volt|kV]], one thousand times more than the voltage limits of many electronic components.&lt;ref name=H60&gt;Hasse, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; A circuit can also incorporate high voltages by design, in which case it needs safe, reliable means of interfacing its high-voltage components with low-voltage ones.&lt;ref&gt;See Basso for a discussion of such interfacing in [[Switched-mode power supply|switched-mode power supplies]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The main function of an opto-isolator is to block such high voltages and voltage transients, so that a surge in one part of the system will not disrupt or destroy the other parts.&lt;ref name=L2/&gt;&lt;ref name=HH595&gt;Horowitz and Hill, p. 595.&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, this function was delegated to [[isolation transformer]]s, which use [[inductive coupling]] between [[Galvanic isolation|galvanically isolated]] input and output sides. Transformers and opto-isolators are the only two classes of electronic devices that offer ''reinforced protection'' — they protect both the equipment ''and'' the human user operating this equipment.&lt;ref name=H48/&gt; They contain a single physical isolation barrier, but provide protection equivalent to [[Appliance classes#Class II|double isolation]].&lt;ref name=H48&gt;Jaus, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Safety, testing and approval of opto-couplers are regulated by national and international standards: [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 60747-5-2, [[European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization|EN (CENELEC)]] 60747-5-2, [[Underwriters Laboratories|UL]] 1577, [[Canadian Standards Association|CSA]] Component Acceptance Notice #5, etc.&lt;ref name=H50&gt;Jaus, pp. 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt; Opto-isolator specifications published by manufacturers always follow at least one of these regulatory frameworks.

An opto-isolator connects input and output sides with a beam of light [[modulation|modulated]] by input current. It transforms useful input signal into light, sends it across the [[dielectric]] channel, captures light on the output side and transforms it back into electric signal. Unlike transformers, which pass energy in both directions&lt;ref group=note&gt;A transformer can have as many coils as necessary. Each coil can act as a ''primary'', pumping energy into a common [[magnetic core]], or as a ''secondary'' – picking up energy stored in the core.&lt;/ref&gt; with very low losses, opto-isolators are unidirectional (see [[#Bidirectional opto-isolators|exceptions]]) and they cannot transmit ''[[Power (physics)|power]]''.&lt;ref name=J277/&gt; Typical opto-isolators can only modulate the flow of energy already present on the output side.&lt;ref name=J277&gt;Joffe and Kai-Sang Lock, p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike transformers, opto-isolators can pass [[direct current|DC]] or slow-moving signals and do not require [[impedance matching|matching impedances]] between input and output sides.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The input side circuitry and the LED must be matched, the output side and the sensor must be matched, but there is, usually, no need to match input ''and'' output sides.&lt;/ref&gt; Both transformers and opto-isolators are effective in breaking [[Ground loop (electricity)|ground loops]], common in industrial and stage equipment, caused by high or noisy return currents in [[Ground wire#Electronics|ground wires]].&lt;ref&gt;Joffe and Kai-Sang Lock, pp. 268, 276.&lt;/ref&gt;

The physical layout of an opto-isolator depends primarily on the desired isolation voltage. Devices rated for less than a few kV have planar (or sandwich) construction.&lt;ref name=M174&gt;Mataré, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; The sensor [[Die (integrated circuit)|die]] is mounted directly on the lead frame of its package (usually, a six-pin or a four-pin [[dual in-line package]]).&lt;ref name=M100/&gt; The sensor is covered with a sheet of glass or clear plastic, which is topped with the LED die.&lt;ref name=M100/&gt; The LED beam fires downward. To minimize losses of light, the useful absorption spectrum of the sensor must match the output spectrum of the LED, which almost invariably lies in the near infrared.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; The optical channel is made as thin as possible for a desired [[breakdown voltage]].&lt;ref name=M174/&gt; For example, to be rated for short-term voltages of 3.75&amp;nbsp;kV and transients of 1&amp;nbsp;kV/μs, the clear [[polyimide]] sheet in the [[Avago Technologies|Avago]] ASSR-300 series is only 0.08&amp;nbsp;mm thick.&lt;ref&gt;[[Avago Technologies]] (2007). ''[http://www.avagotech.com/docs/AV02-0452EN ASSR-301C and ASSR-302C (datasheet)]''. Retrieved November 3, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Breakdown voltages of planar assemblies depend on the thickness of the transparent sheet&lt;ref name=M174/&gt; and the configuration of bonding wires that connect the dies with external pins.&lt;ref name=M100/&gt; Real in-circuit isolation voltage is further reduced by [[insulator (electrical)#Design|creepage]] over the [[printed circuit board|PCB]] and the surface of the package. Safe design rules require a minimal clearance of 25&amp;nbsp;mm/kV for bare metal conductors or 8.3&amp;nbsp;mm/kV for coated conductors.&lt;ref&gt;Bottrill et al., p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

Opto-isolators rated for 2.5 to 6&amp;nbsp;kV employ a different layout called ''silicone dome''.&lt;ref name=Basso/&gt; Here, the LED and sensor dies are placed on the opposite sides of the package; the LED fires into the sensor horizontally.&lt;ref name=Basso/&gt; The LED, the sensor and the gap between them are encapsulated in a blob, or dome, of transparent [[silicone]]. The dome acts as a [[mirror|reflector]], retaining all stray light and reflecting it onto the surface of the sensor, minimizing losses in a relatively long optical channel.&lt;ref name=Basso/&gt; In ''double mold'' designs the space between the silicone blob ("inner mold") and the outer shell ("outer mold") is filled with dark dielectric compound with a matched [[thermal expansion#Coefficient of thermal expansion|coefficient of thermal expansion]].&lt;ref name=VI/&gt;

===Resistive opto-isolators===
{{main|Resistive opto-isolator}}
&lt;!-- [[File:OEP series optocouples.jpg|thumb|right|Obsolete photoresistor opto-couples (Russian OEP series pictured) retain a niche in modern [[guitar amplifier]] market.]] --&gt;
The earliest opto-isolators, originally marketed as ''light cells'', emerged in the 1960s. They employed miniature [[incandescent light bulb]]s as sources of light, and [[cadmium sulfide]] (CdS) or [[cadmium selenide]] (CdSe) photoresistors (also called light-dependent resistors, LDRs) as receivers. In applications where control linearity was not important, or where available current was too low for driving an incandescent bulb (as was the case in vacuum tube amplifiers), it was replaced with a [[neon lamp]]. These devices (or just their LDR component) were commonly named ''Vactrols'', after a trademark of Vactec, Inc. The trademark has since been [[genericized trademark|genericized]],&lt;ref group=note&gt;According to the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]], trademark registered in 1969 for "photocell combined with a light source" is now dead ([http://tess2.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4005:pnh880.2.4 USPTO database record serial number 72318344]. Retrieved November 5, 2010). The same trademark, registered in 1993 for "medico-surgical tubing connector sold as a component of suction catheters" is now live and owned by Mallinckrodt Inc. ([http://tess2.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4005:pnh880.2.2 USPTO database record serial number 74381130]. Retrieved November 5, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; but the original Vactrols are still being manufactured by [[PerkinElmer]].&lt;ref&gt;Weber, p. 190; PerkinElmer, p. 28; Collins, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Vactec was purchased by [[EG&amp;G]] (Edgerton, Germeshausen, and Grier, Inc.), a defense contractor, in 1983. In 1999 EG&amp;G purchased formerly independent PerkinElmer, and changed own name PerkinElmer (see [[reverse takeover]]). An unrelated company, Silonex (a division of [[Carlyle Group]]) brands its photoresistive opto-isolators ''Audiohm Optocouplers''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The turn-on and turn-off lag of an incandescent bulb lies in hundreds of [[milliseconds]] range, which makes the bulb an effective [[low-pass filter]] and [[rectifier]] but limits the practical modulation frequency range to a few [[Hertz]]. With the introduction of [[light-emitting diode]]s (LEDs) in 1968–1970,&lt;ref&gt;Schubert, pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; the manufacturers replaced incandescent and neon lamps with LEDs and achieved response times of 5&amp;nbsp;milliseconds and modulation frequencies up to 250&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref&gt;PerkinElmer, pp. 6–7: "at 1 [[Foot-candle|fc]] of illumination the response times are typically in the range of 5&amp;nbsp;ms to 100&amp;nbsp;ms."&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''Vactrol'' was carried over on LED-based devices which are, as of 2010, still produced in small quantities.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, p. 190; PerkinElmer, pp. 2,7,28; Collins, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

Photoresistors used in opto-isolators rely on bulk effects in a uniform film of [[semiconductor]]; there are no [[p-n junction]]s.&lt;ref name=P3/&gt; Uniquely among photosensors, photoresistors are non-polar devices suited for either AC or DC circuits.&lt;ref name=P3/&gt; Their resistance drops in reverse proportion to the intensity of incoming light, from virtually infinity to a residual floor that may be as low as less than a hundred [[Ohm]]s.&lt;ref name=P3/&gt; These properties made the original Vactrol a convenient and cheap [[automatic gain control]] and [[Dynamic range compression|compressor]] for telephone networks. The photoresistors easily withstood voltages up to 400&amp;nbsp;volts,&lt;ref name=P3&gt;PerkinElmer, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; which made them ideal for driving [[vacuum fluorescent display]]s. Other industrial applications included [[photocopier]]s, industrial [[automation]], professional light measurement instruments and [[Exposure (photography)#Automatic exposure|auto-exposure meters]].&lt;ref name=P3/&gt; Most of these applications are now obsolete, but resistive opto-isolators retained a niche in audio, in particular [[guitar amplifier]], markets.

American guitar and organ manufacturers of the 1960s embraced the resistive opto-isolator as a convenient and cheap [[tremolo]] modulator. [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]]'s early tremolo effects used two [[vacuum tubes]]; after 1964 one of these tubes was replaced by an optocoupler made of a LDR and a neon lamp.&lt;ref&gt;Fliegler and Eiche, p. 28; Teagle and Sprung, p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; To date, Vactrols activated by pressing the [[Effects unit#Stompboxes|stompbox pedal]] are ubiquitous in the music industry.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortages of genuine PerkinElmer Vactrols forced the [[Do it yourself|DIY]] guitar community to "roll their own" resistive opto-isolators.&lt;ref name=C181&gt;Collins, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; Guitarists to date prefer opto-isolated effects because their superior [[Ground (electricity)#Separating low signal ground from a noisy ground|separation of audio and control grounds]] results in "inherently high quality of the sound".&lt;ref name=C181/&gt; However, the [[distortion]] introduced by a photoresistor at [[line level]] signal is higher than that of a professional electrically-coupled [[Variable-gain amplifier|voltage-controlled amplifier]].&lt;ref&gt;PerkinElmer, pp. 35–36; Silonex, p. 1 (see also distortion charts on subsequent pages).&lt;/ref&gt; Performance is further compromised by slow fluctuations of resistance owing to [[light history]], a [[memory effect]] inherent in [[cadmium]] compounds. Such fluctuations take hours to settle and can be only partially offset with [[Feedback#Electronic engineering|feedback]] in the control circuit.&lt;ref&gt;PerkinElmer, pp. 7, 29, 38; Silonex, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photodiode opto-isolators===

[[File:Optically isolated.jpg|thumb|right|A fast photodiode opto-isolator with an output-side amplifier circuit.]]

Diode opto-isolators employ LEDs as sources of light and silicon [[photodiode]]s as sensors. When the photodiode is reverse-biased with an external voltage source, incoming light increases the reverse current flowing through the diode. The diode itself does not generate energy; it modulates the flow of energy from an external source. This mode of operation is called [[photodiode#Photoconductive mode|photoconductive mode]]. Alternatively, in the absence of external bias the diode converts the energy of light into [[Electric potential energy|electric energy]] by charging its terminals to a voltage of up to 0.7&amp;nbsp;V. The rate of charge is proportional to the intensity of incoming light. The energy is harvested by draining the charge through an external high-impedance path; the ratio of current transfer can reach 0.2%.&lt;ref name=T5/&gt; This mode of operation is called [[Photodiode#Photovoltaic mode|photovoltaic mode]].

The fastest opto-isolators employ [[PIN diode]]s in photoconductive mode. The response times of PIN diodes lie in the [[nanosecond|subnanosecond]] range; overall system speed is limited by delays in LED output and in biasing circuitry. To minimize these delays, fast digital opto-isolators contain their own LED drivers and output amplifiers optimized for speed. These devices are called ''full logic opto-isolators'': their LEDs and sensors are fully encapsulated within a digital logic circuit.&lt;ref&gt;Horowitz and Hill, pp. 596–597.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hewlett-Packard]] 6N137/HPCL2601 family of devices equipped with internal output amplifiers was introduced in the late 1970s and attained 10&amp;nbsp;[[Baud|MBd]] data transfer speeds.&lt;ref&gt;Porat and Barna, p. 464. See also full specifications of currently produced devices: ''[http://www.avagotech.com/docs/AV02-0940EN 6N137 / HCPL-2601 datasheet]''. [[Avago Technologies]]. March 2010. Retrieved November 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It remained an industry standard until the introduction of the 50&amp;nbsp;MBd [[Agilent Technologies]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;The former semiconductor division of Agilent Technologies operates as an independent company, [[Avago Technologies]], since 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; 7723/0723 family in 2002.&lt;ref name=AVA2002&gt;''[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/TRADE+NEWS%3A+Agilent+Technologies+Introduces+Industry's+Fastest...-a094761414 Agilent Technologies Introduces Industry's Fastest Optocouplers]''.

Retrieved November 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Photodiode opto-isolators can be used for interfacing analog signals, although their [[Diode#Current–voltage characteristic|non-linearity]] invariably [[Amplitude distortion|distorts the signal]]. A special class of analog opto-isolators introduced by [[Burr-Brown Corporation|Burr-Brown]] uses ''two'' photodiodes and an input-side [[operational amplifier]] to compensate for diode non-linearity. One of two identical diodes is wired into the [[feedback|feedback loop]] of the amplifier, which maintains overall current transfer ratio at a constant level regardless of the non-linearity in the second (output) diode.&lt;ref name=HH598/&gt;

A novel idea of a particular optical analog signal isolator was submitted on 3, June 2011. The proposed configuration consist of two different parts. One of them transfers the signal, and the other establishes a negative feedback to ensure that the output signal has the same features as the input signal. This proposed analog isolator is linear over a wide range of input voltage and frequency.&lt;ref&gt;Modern Applied Science Vol 5, No 3 (2011). ''[http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/mas/article/view/9543/7725  A Novel Approach to Analog Signal Isolation through Digital Opto-coupler (YOUTAB)]''.&lt;/ref&gt; However linear opto couplers using this principle have been available for many years, for example the IL300.&lt;ref&gt;Vishay website, IL300 data (accessed 10-20-2015), ''http://www.vishay.com/optocouplers/list/product-83622/''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Solid-state relays]] built around [[MOSFET]] switches usually employ a photodiode opto-isolator to drive the switch. The gate of a MOSFET requires relatively small total [[electric charge|charge]] to turn on and its leakage current in steady state is very low. A photodiode in photovoltaic mode can generate turn-on ''charge'' in a reasonably short time but its output ''voltage'' is many times less than the MOSFET's [[threshold voltage]]. To reach the required threshold, solid-state relays contain stacks of up to thirty photodiodes wired in series.&lt;ref name=VI&gt;Vishay Semiconductor.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phototransistor opto-isolators===

Phototransistors are inherently slower than photodiodes.&lt;ref name=B61&gt;Ball, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest and the slowest but still common 4N35 opto-isolator, for example, has rise and fall times of 5 [[microsecond|μs]] into a 100 Ohm load&lt;ref&gt;Horowitz and Hill, p. 596. Ball p. 68, provides rise and fall time of 10 μs but does not specify load impedance.&lt;/ref&gt; and its bandwidth is limited at around 10 kilohertz - sufficient for applications like [[electroencephalography]]&lt;ref name=ANA/&gt; or [[Pulse-width modulation#Power delivery|pulse-width motor control]].&lt;ref name=B68&gt;Ball, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Devices like PC-900 or 6N138 recommended in the original 1983 [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface]] specification&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.midi.org/techspecs/electrispec.php MIDI Electrical Specification Diagram &amp; Proper Design of Joystick/MIDI Adapter]''. MIDI Manufacturers Association. 1985. Retrieved November 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; allow digital data transfer speeds of tens of kiloBauds.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Phototransistors must be properly [[biasing|biased]] and loaded to achieve their maximum speeds, for example, the 4N28 operates at up to 50&amp;nbsp;kHz with optimum bias and less than 4&amp;nbsp;kHz without it.&lt;ref name=P73&gt;Pease, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

Design with transistor opto-isolators requires generous allowances for wide fluctuations of parameters found in commercially available devices.&lt;ref name=P73/&gt; Such fluctuations may be destructive, for example, when an opto-isolator in the [[Feedback loop#Electronic engineering|feedback loop]] of a [[DC-to-DC converter]] changes its [[transfer function]] and causes spurious oscillations,&lt;ref name=Basso&gt;Basso.&lt;/ref&gt; or when unexpected delays in opto-isolators cause a [[short circuit]] through one side of an [[H-bridge]].&lt;ref&gt;Ball, pp. 181–182. Shorting one side of an H-bridge is called ''shoot-through''.&lt;/ref&gt; Manufacturers' [[datasheet]]s typically list only worst-case values for critical parameters; actual devices surpass these worst-case estimates in an unpredictable fashion.&lt;ref name=P73/&gt; [[Bob Pease]] observed that current transfer ratio in a batch of 4N28's can vary from 15% to more than 100%; the datasheet specified only a minimum of 10%. Transistor [[Bipolar junction transistor#Transistor .27alpha.27 and .27beta.27|beta]] in the same batch can vary from 300 to 3000, resulting in 10:1 variance in [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]].&lt;ref name=P73/&gt;

Opto-isolators using [[field-effect transistor]]s (FETs) as sensors are rare and, like vactrols, can be used as remote-controlled analog potentiometers provided that the voltage across the FET's output terminal does not exceed a few hundred mV.&lt;ref name=HH598&gt;Horowitz and Hill, p. 598.&lt;/ref&gt; Opto-FETs turn on without injecting switching charge in the output circuit, which is particularly useful in [[sample and hold]] circuits.&lt;ref name=HH595/&gt;

===Bidirectional opto-isolators===

All opto-isolators described so far are uni-directional. Optical channel always works one way, from the source (LED) to the sensor. The sensors, be it photoresistors, photodiodes or phototransistors, cannot emit light.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Exception: Ternary and quaternary [[gallium arsenide phosphide|GaAsP]] photodiodes can generate light. - Mims, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; But LEDs, like all semiconductor diodes,&lt;ref group=note&gt;"Even the garden variety signal diodes you use in circuits have a small photovoltaic effect. There are amusing stories of bizarre circuit behavior finally traced to this." - Horowitz and Hill McCoulny, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; are capable of detecting incoming light, which makes possible construction of a two-way opto-isolator from a pair of LEDs. The simplest bidirectional opto-isolator is merely a pair of LEDs placed face to face and held together with [[heat-shrink tubing]]. If necessary, the gap between two LEDs can be extended with a [[optical fiber|glass fiber insert]].&lt;ref name=M102&gt;Mims vol. 2, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Visible spectrum]] LEDs have relatively poor transfer efficiency, thus [[infrared#Different regions in the infrared|near infrared spectrum]] [[gallium arsenide|GaAs]], [[gallium arsenide|GaAs:Si]] and [[aluminium gallium arsenide|AlGaAs:Si]] LEDs are the preferred choice for bidirectional devices. Bidirectional opto-isolators built around pairs of GaAs:Si LEDs have current transfer ratio of around 0.06% in either [[photodiode#Photovoltaic mode|photovoltaic]] or [[photodiode#Photoconductive mode|photoconductive]] mode — less than photodiode-based isolators,&lt;ref&gt;Photodiode opto-isolators have current transfer ratios of up to 0.2% - Mataré, p. 177, table 5.1.&lt;/ref&gt; but sufficiently practical for real-world applications.&lt;ref name=M102/&gt;

==Types of configurations==
{{Anchor |optosensor}}
Usually, optocouplers have a ''closed pair'' configuration. This configuration refers to optocouplers enclosed in a dark container wherein the source and sensor are facing each other.

Some optocouplers have a ''slotted coupler/interrupter'' configuration. This configuration refers to optocouplers with an open slot between the source and sensor that has the ability to influence incoming signals. The ''slotted coupler/interrupter'' configuration is suitable for object detection, vibration detection, and bounce-free switching.

Some optocouplers have a ''reflective pair'' configuration. This configuration refers to optocouplers that contain a source that emits light and a sensor that only detects light when it has reflected off an object. The ''reflective pair'' configuration is suitable for the development of tachometers, movement detectors and reflectance monitors.

The later two configurations are frequently referred to as 'optosensors'.

'''Phantom power''', in the context of [[Professional audio|professional audio equipment]], is [[Direct current|DC]] electric [[Electric power|power]] transmitted through [[microphone]] cables to operate microphones that contain active electronic circuitry.&lt;ref&gt;David Miles Huber, Robert E. Runstein  ''Modern Recording Techniques'', Focal Press 2009 {{ISBN|0-240-81069-4}}, page 117&lt;/ref&gt;
It is best known as a convenient power source for [[condenser microphone]]s, though many active [[DI unit|direct box]]es also use it. The technique is also used in other applications where power supply and signal communication take place over the same wires.

[[File:Oktava319.jpg|thumb|upright| A [[condenser microphone]] requires power to produce a DC polarizing voltage and to power an internal amplifier required to drive long cables]]
Phantom power supplies are often built into [[mixing console]]s, [[microphone preamplifiers]] and similar equipment. In addition to powering the circuitry of a microphone, traditional condenser microphones also use phantom power for polarizing the microphone's transducer element.

==History==
Phantom powering was used in [[telephone]] systems since the introduction of the rotary-dial telephone in 1919 before it was applied to condenser microphones. One such application in the telephone system was to provide a [[Direct current|DC]] signaling path around transformer connected amplifiers in analogue line transmission systems. The first known commercially available phantom-powered microphone was the [[Schoeps]] model CMT 20, which came out in 1964, built to the specifications of French radio with 9–12 volt DC phantom power; the positive pole of this powering was grounded. Microphone preamplifiers of the [[Nagra]] IV-series tape recorders offered this type of powering as an option for many years and Schoeps continued to support "negative phantom" until the CMT series was discontinued in the mid-1970s, but it is obsolete now.

In 1966, [[Neumann GmbH]] of Berlin, Germany, presented a new type of transistorized microphone to the [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]], NRK. Norwegian Radio had requested phantom-powered operation. Since NRK already had 48 V available in their studios for their emergency lighting systems, this voltage was used for powering the new microphones (model KM 84), and is the origin of 48-V phantom power. This arrangement was later standardized in DIN 45596.

==Standards==
The International Electrotechnical Commission Standards Committee's "Multimedia systems - Guide to the recommended characteristics of analogue interfaces to achieve interoperability" (IEC 61938:2013) specifies parameters for microphone phantom power delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/6142|title=IEC 61938:2013 {{!}} IEC Webstore|website=webstore.iec.ch|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three variants are defined by the document: P12, P24 and P48. In addition, two additional variants (P12L and SP48) are mentioned for specialized applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.prosoundtraining.com/2012/09/07/battery-powered-phantom-power-supplies/|title=Battery Powered Phantom Power Supplies|date=2012-09-07|work=Prosoundtraining|access-date=2018-03-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KApvYcQkY_gC|title=Eargle's The Microphone Book: From Mono to Stereo to Surround - A Guide to Microphone Design and Application|last=Rayburn|first=Ray A.|date=2012-11-12|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9781136118135|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most microphones now use the P48 standard (maximum available power is 240&amp;nbsp;mW). Although 12 and 48 volt systems are still in use, the standard recommends 24 volt supply for new systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/gov.in.is.15572.2005|title=IS 15572: Audio, Video and Audiovisual Systems - Interconnections and Matching Values - Preferred Matching Values of Analogue Signlas|last=Bureau of Indian Standards|date=2005-01-01|language=English|quote=This Indian Standard which is identical with lEC 61938 (1996) ... Although 12 V and 48 V systems are still in use, 24 V systems are preferred for new developments.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical information==
Phantom powering consists of a [[phantom circuit]] where direct current is applied equally through the two [[Signaling (telecommunication)|signal]] lines of a [[balanced audio connector]] (in modern equipment, both pins 2 and 3 of an [[XLR connector]]). The supply voltage is referenced to the ground pin of the connector (pin 1 of an XLR), which normally is connected to the cable shield or a ground wire in the cable or both. When phantom powering was introduced, one of its advantages was that the same type of balanced, shielded microphone cable that studios were already using for [[dynamic microphone]]s could be used for condenser microphones. This is in contrast to microphones with [[Vacuum tube|vacuum-tube]] circuitry, most of which require special, multi-conductor cables.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;There are phantom-powered vacuum tube microphones, such as the [http://www.microtechgefell.com/index.php/en/microphones/studio-a-recording/large-membrane-tube-mics/340-um900-roehrenmikrofon Microtech Gefell UM900] and [http://www.audio-technica.com/cms/wired_mics/187139bf88c8539d/index.html/ Audio-Technica AT3060]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Injection.png|thumb|right| One method of supplying phantom power. A microphone or other device can obtain DC power from either signal line to ground terminal, and two capacitors block this DC from appearing at the output. R1 and R2 should be 6.81k ohms for "P48" 48 volt phantom. R3-6 and [[Zener diode]]s 1-4 protect the output to a maximum of 10v.]]

With phantom power, the supply voltage is effectively invisible to balanced microphones that do not use it, which includes most dynamic microphones. A balanced signal consists only of the differences in voltage between two signal lines; phantom powering places the same DC voltage on both signal lines of a balanced connection. This is in marked contrast to another, slightly earlier method of powering known as "parallel powering" or "T-powering" (from the German term ''Tonaderspeisung''), in which DC was overlaid directly onto the signal in differential mode. Connecting a conventional microphone to an input that had parallel powering enabled could very well damage the microphone.

The IEC 61938 Standard defines 48-volt, 24-volt, and 12-volt phantom powering. The signal conductors are positive, both fed through resistors of equal value (6.81 [[kilohm|kΩ]] for 48 V, 1.2 kΩ for 24 V, and 680 Ω for 12 V), and the shield is [[ground (electricity)|ground]]. The 6.81&amp;nbsp;kΩ value is not critical, but the resistors must be matched to within 0.1%&lt;ref&gt;http://sound.whsites.net/project96.htm&lt;/ref&gt; or better to maintain good [[Common-mode rejection ratio|common-mode rejection]] in the circuit. The 24-volt version of phantom powering, proposed quite a few years after the 12 and 48 V versions, was also included in the DIN standard and is in the IEC standard, but it was never widely adopted by equipment manufacturers.
[[File:Audio-Technica AT8801 Phantom Power Supply.jpg|thumb|right| An external phantom power supply.]]

Many mixer boards have a switch for turning phantom power on or off; in most high-end equipment this can be done individually by channel, or on smaller mixers all mic channels can be either on or off, also this can be done in groups in most mid-range boards and some smaller ones. If it is desired to disconnect phantom power from one channel only, this can be done by using a 1:1 isolation transformer or blocking capacitors. Phantom powering can cause equipment malfunction or even damage if used with cables or adapters that connect one side of the input to ground, or if certain equipment other than microphones is connected to it.

[[Instrument amplifier]]s rarely provide phantom power. To use equipment requiring it with these amplifiers, a separate power supply must be inserted into the line. These are readily available commercially, or alternatively are one of the easier projects for the amateur electronics constructor.

==Caveats==
Some microphones offer a choice of internal battery powering or (external) phantom powering. In some such microphones it is advisable to remove the internal batteries when phantom power is being used since batteries may corrode and leak chemicals. Other microphones are specifically designed to switch over to the internal batteries if an external supply fails, which may be useful.

Phantom powering is not always implemented correctly or adequately, even in professional-quality preamps, mixers, and recorders. In part this is because first-generation (late-1960s through mid-1970s) 48-volt phantom-powered condenser microphones had simple circuitry and required only small amounts of operating current (typically less than 1&amp;nbsp;[[Milliampere|mA]] per microphone), so the phantom supply circuits typically built into recorders, mixers, and preamps of that time were designed on the assumption that this current would be adequate. The original DIN 45596 phantom-power specification called for a maximum of 2&amp;nbsp;mA. This practice has carried forward to the present; many 48-volt phantom power supply circuits, especially in low-cost and portable equipment, simply cannot supply more than 1 or 2&amp;nbsp;mA total without breaking down. Some circuits also have significant additional resistance in series with the standard pair of supply resistors for each microphone input; this may not affect low-current microphones much, but it can disable microphones that need more current.

Mid-1970s and later condenser microphones designed for 48-volt phantom powering often require much more current (e.g., 2–4&amp;nbsp;mA for Neumann transformerless microphones, 4–5&amp;nbsp;mA for the Schoeps CMC ("Colette") series and Josephson microphones, 5–6&amp;nbsp;mA for most [[Shure]] KSM-series microphones, 8&amp;nbsp;mA for CAD Equiteks and 10&amp;nbsp;mA for Earthworks). The IEC standard gives 10&amp;nbsp;mA as the maximum allowed current per microphone. If its required current is not available, a microphone may still put out a signal, but it cannot deliver its intended level of performance. The specific symptoms vary somewhat, but the most common result will be reduction of the maximum sound-pressure level that the microphone can handle without overload (distortion). Some microphones will also show lower sensitivity (output level for a given sound-pressure level).

Most [[ground lift]] switches have the unwanted effect of disconnecting phantom power. There must always be a DC current path between pin 1 of the microphone and the negative side of the 48 volt supply, if power is to reach the microphone's electronics. Lifting the ground, which is normally pin 1, breaks this path and disables the phantom power supply.

There is a common belief that connecting a dynamic or ribbon microphone to a phantom-powered input will damage it. There are three possibilities for this damage to occur. If there is a fault in the cable, phantom power may damage some mics by applying a voltage across the output of the microphone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |quote=Sending Phantom Power to an old (prior to 1970 design) ribbon microphone without an isolating transformer, while using a bad cable, which has the ground (pin 1) shorted to pin 2 or pin 3 of the XLR. This is the one classic example why everybody says - do not send phantom power to ribbon microphones, but the chances of this “perfect storm” to happen are really not that big. |title=Can phantom power damage your microphones? |url=http://avstomusic.blogspot.com/2012/05/can-phantom-power-damage-your.html |date=2012-05-24 |accessdate=2013-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equipment damage is also possible if a phantom-powered input connected to an unbalanced dynamic microphone&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d7ft6F8ZUdcC&amp;pg=PA130 |title=The Sound Reinforcement Handbook |author=Gary Davis |publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation |date=1989 |page=130 |isbn=9781617745454}}&lt;/ref&gt; or electronic musical instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jan13/articles/qanda-0113-3.htm |title=Q.

This is particularly a problem with long microphone cables.

==Digital phantom power==
Digital microphones complying with the [[Audio Engineering Society|AES 42]] standard may be provided with phantom power at 10 volts, impressed on both audio leads and ground.  This supply can furnish up to 250 mA to digital microphones. A keyed variation of the usual [[XLR connector]], the [[XLD connector]], may be used to prevent accidental interchange of analog and digital devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Francis Rumsey |author2=John Watkinson |title=Digital interface handbook third edition |publisher=Elsevier |year=2004 |ISBN=0-240-51909-4 |page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other microphone powering techniques==
T-power, also known as A-B powering&lt;ref&gt;

Michael Talbot-Smith ''Sound assistance'', Focal Press, 1999 {{ISBN|0-240-51572-2}}, pages 94,95

&lt;/ref&gt; or T12, described in DIN 45595, is an alternative to phantom powering that is still widely used in the world of production film sound. Many mixers and recorders intended for that market have a T-power option. Many older Sennheiser and Schoeps microphones use this powering method, although newer recorders and mixers are phasing out this option. Adapter barrels, and dedicated power supplies, are made to accommodate T powered microphones. There is often no audible difference between microphones featuring this method and microphones with P48 powering. In this scheme, 12 volts is applied through 180 ohm resistors between the microphone's "hot" terminal (XLR pin 2) and the microphone's "cold" terminal (XLR pin 3). This results in a 12 volt potential difference with significant current capability across pins 2 and 3, which would likely cause permanent damage if applied to a dynamic or ribbon microphone.

Plug-in-power (PiP), is the low-current 3&amp;nbsp;V to 5&amp;nbsp;V supply provided at the microphone jack of some consumer equipment, such as portable recorders and computer [[sound card]]s. It is also defined in IEC 61938.&lt;ref&gt;https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/6142&lt;/ref&gt; It is unlike phantom power since it is an unbalanced interface with a low voltage (around +5 volts) connected to the signal conductor with return through the sleeve; the DC power is in common with the audio signal from the microphone. A Capacitor is used to block the DC from subsequent audio frequency circuits.  It is often used for powering [[electret microphone]]s, which will not function without power. It is suitable only for powering microphones specifically designed for use with this type of power supply. Damage may result if these microphones are connected to true (48&amp;nbsp;V) phantom power through a 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm to XLR adapter that connects the XLR shield to the 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm sleeve.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.microphone-data.com/media/filestore/articles/Powering%20mics-10.pdf Chris Woolf ''Powering Microphones'', retrieved 2013 April 28&lt;/ref&gt; Plug-in-power is covered by Japanese standard CP-1203A:2007&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jeita.or.jp/cgi-bin/standard_e/list.cgi?cateid=1&amp;subcateid=6|title=JEITA / JEITA Standards / AV&amp;IT Technology Standardization / Interface|website=www.jeita.or.jp|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A similar line-powering scheme is found in computer sound cards. Both plug-in-power and soundcard power are defined in the second edition of IEC 61938.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/6142|title=IEC 61938:2013 {{!}} IEC Webstore|website=webstore.iec.ch|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These alternative powering schemes are sometimes improperly referred to as "phantom power" and should not be confused with true 48-volt phantom powering described above.

Some condenser microphones can be powered with a 1.5 volt cell contained in a small compartment in the microphone or in an external housing.

Phantom power is sometimes used by workers in [[avionics]] to describe the DC bias voltage used to power aviation microphones, which use a lower voltage than professional audio microphones.  Phantom power used in this context is 8 to 16 volts DC in series with a 470 ohm (nominal) resistor as specified in [[Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics|RTCA Inc.]] standard DO-214.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rtca.org/ RTCA DO-214&lt;/ref&gt; These microphones evolved from the [[carbon microphone]]s used in the early days of aviation and the telephone which relied on a DC bias voltage across the carbon microphone element.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6061">A '''plantibody''' is an [[antibody]] that is produced by plants that have been [[Genetic Engineering|genetically engineered]] with animal DNA. An antibody (also known as an immunoglobulin) is a complex protein within the body that recognizes [[antigen]]s on viruses and other dangerous compounds in order to alert the [[immune system]] that there are pathogens within the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Molecular Perspective: antibodies|url=http://theoncologist.alphamedpress.org/content/6/6/547.full|accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transgenic plants become transformed with the DNA and produce antibodies that are similar to those inserted. The term plantibody and the concept are trademarked by the company [[Biolex]].

==Production==
A plantibody is produced by insertion of genes encoding antibodies into a [[transgenic]] plant. The plantibodies are then modified by intrinsic plant mechanisms (N-glycosylation).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/103366.html Plantibody (antibody synthesized by plants)], ''Springfild Reference''.&lt;/ref&gt; Plantibodies are purified through processes such as [[filtration]], [[chromatography]], and [[diafiltration]]. It is less costly to produce antibodies in transgenic plants than in transgenic animals. 
==Advantages==
Transgenic plants offer an attractive method for large-scale production of antibodies for [[immunotherapy]].&lt;ref name=CNRS/&gt; Antibodies produced in plants have many advantage that are beneficial to humans, plants, and the economy as well. They can be purified cheaply and in large numbers. The many seeds of plants allow for ample storage, and they have no risk of transmitting diseases to humans because the antibodies are produced without the need of the [[antigen]] or infectious microorganisms. Plants could be engineered to produce antibodies which fight off their own plant diseases and pests, for example, nematodes, and eliminate the need for toxic pesticides.

== Applications ==
Antibodies generated by plants are cheaper, easier to manage, and safer to use than those obtained from animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Medical Molecular Farming|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1360138501019227|accessdate=26 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The applications are increasing because recombinant DNA is very useful in creating proteins that are identical when exposed into a plant's. A recombinant DNA is an artificial DNA that is created by combining two or more sequences that would not normally come together. In this way, DNA injected into a plant is turned into recombinant DNA and manipulated. The favorable properties of plants are likely to make the plant systems a useful alternative for small, medium and large scale production throughout the development of new antibody-based pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 19183896 | doi=10.1007/978-1-59745-407-0_7 | volume=483 | title=Production of plantibodies in Nicotiana plants | journal=Methods Mol Biol | pages=103-34 | last1 = Ayala | first1 = M | last2 = Gavilondo | first2 = J | last3 = Rodríguez | first3 = M | last4 = Fuentes | first4 = A | last5 = Enríquez | first5 = G | last6 = Pérez | first6 = L | last7 = Cremata | first7 = J | last8 = Pujol | first8 = M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical===
The main reason plants are being used to produce antibodies is for treatment of illnesses such as immune disorders, cancer, and inflammatory diseases, given the fact that the plantibodies also have no risk of spreading diseases to humans.&lt;ref name=CNRS&gt;{{cite news|title=Antibodies in plants|url=http://www.cnrs.fr/Cnrspresse/n393/html/en393a04.htm|accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the past 2 decades, research has shown that plant-derived antibodies have become easier to produce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Plant cell factories and mucosal vaccines|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0958166903000260|accessdate=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commercial===
Plantibodies are close to passing clinical trials and becoming approved commercially because of key points.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} Plants are more economical than most forms of creating antibodies and the technology for harvesting and maintaining them is already present. Plants also reduce the chance of coming in contact with [[pathogen]]s, making their antibodies safer to use. Plantibodies can be made at an affordable cost and easier manufacturing due to the availability and relatively easy manipulation of genetic information in crops such as potatoes, soybean, alfalfa, rice, wheat and tobacco.

==Outlook==
Commercial use is not yet legalized{{where|date=October 2014}}, but clinical trials are underway to implement the use of plantibodies for humans as injections. So far, companies have started conducting human tests of pharmaceutical products, creating plantibodies that include:
* Hepatitis B vaccine
* Antibody to fight cavity causing bacteria
* Antibodies to prevent sexually transmitted diseases
* Antibodies for non-Hodgkin's -cell lymphoma
* Vaccine against HIV virus

By being able to genetically alter plants to create specific antibodies, it is easier to produce antibodies that will fight diseases not only for plants but for human as well. For that reason, plantibody applications will move more towards the medicinal field.

&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all discussions of polarization in [[political science]] consider polarization in the context of [[political party|political parties]] and democratic systems of government. When polarization occurs in a [[two-party system]], like the [[United States]], moderate voices often lose power and influence.&lt;ref name = dimaggio-96/&gt;&lt;ref name=mann-12&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mann |first=Thomas E. |author2=Ornstein, Norman J. |title=It's Even Worse Than It Looks: How the American constitutional system collided with the new politics of extremism | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CQORs1_S2sgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140705154533/http://books.google.com/books?id=CQORs1_S2sgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2014-07-05 | publisher=[[Basic Books]] | year=2012 | isbn=978-0465031337}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mccarty-06&gt;{{cite book|last=McCarty|first=Nolan|title=Polarized America : the dance of ideology and unequal riches|year=2006|publisher=MIT Press|at=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=978-0262134644 |author2=Poole, Keith T. |author3=Rosenthal, Howard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions and measurements==

Political polarization refers to the cases in which an individual's stance on a given issue, policy, or person is more likely to be strictly defined by their identification with a particular political party (e.g., [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] or [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]) or [[political ideology|ideology]] (e.g., [[liberalism|liberal]] or [[conservatism|conservative]]).&lt;ref name=dimaggio-96/&gt;&lt;ref name=baldassarri-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=fiorina-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=abramowitz-08&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abramowitz|first=Alan I.|author2=Saunders, Kyle L.|title=Is Polarization a Myth?|journal=The Journal of Politics|date=27 March 2008|volume=70|issue=2|page=542|doi=10.1017/S0022381608080493}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bafumi-09&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bafumi|first=Joseph|author2=Shapiro, Robert Y.|title=A New Partisan Voter|journal=The Journal of Politics|date=27 January 2009|volume=71|issue=1|page=1|doi=10.1017/S0022381608090014|url=http://ftp.columbia.edu/cu/alliance/documents/EDF/Monday/Shapiro_Bafumi_reading.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to DiMaggio et al. (1996), "Polarization is both a state and a process. Polarization as a state refers to the extent to which opinions on an issue are opposed in relation to some theoretical maximum. Polarization as a process refers to the increase in such opposition over time."&lt;ref name=dimaggio-96/&gt; Some political scientists argue that polarization requires divergence on a broad range of issues based on a consistent set of beliefs.&lt;ref name=dimaggio-96/&gt;&lt;ref name=fiorina-08/&gt; Others argue polarization occurs when there are stark partisan or ideological divides, even if the opinion is polarized only on a few issues.&lt;ref name=baldassarri-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=abramowitz-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=bafumi-09/&gt;

Political scientists typically distinguish between two types of political polarization: elite polarization and popular polarization. "Elite polarization" refers to the polarization of political elites, like [[party organizer]]s and [[elected officials]], while "popular polarization" (or mass polarization) refers to the polarization in the electorate and general public. In either context, opinions and policy positions are characterized by strict adherence to [[party line (politics)|party lines]]. Elite polarization and popular polarization can occur at the same time or independent of each other. A central issue in the study of political polarization is investigating the relationship between elite polarization and popular polarization, particularly any causal relationships between the two.&lt;ref name=fiorina-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=mccarty-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=hetherington-09&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hetherington|first=Marc J.|title=Review Article: Putting Polarization in Perspective|journal=British Journal of Political Science|date=17 February 2009|volume=39|issue=2|page=413|doi=10.1017/S0007123408000501}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=layman-06&gt;{{cite journal|last=Layman|first=Geoffrey C.|author2=Carsey, Thomas M. |author3=Horowitz, Juliana Menasce |title=Party Polarization in American Politics: Characteristics, Causes, and Consequences|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|date=1 June 2006|volume=9|issue=1|pages=83–110|doi=10.1146/annurev.polisci.9.070204.105138}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=carmines-12&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carmines|first=E.

===Elite polarization===

[[File:NOMINATE polarization.jpg|thumb|Political polarization in the United States House of Representatives (DW-Nominate scores)]]
Elite polarization refers to polarization in the party-in-government and party-as-organization.&lt;ref name=baldassarri-08/&gt; It occurs when party members (both elected government officials and activists within the party organization itself) grow more internally homogenous on policy positions and more divergent relative to members of other parties. Polarized political parties are internally cohesive, unified, programmatic, and ideologically distinct; they are typically found in a [[parliamentary system]] of democratic governance.&lt;ref name=mann-12/&gt;&lt;ref name=mccarty-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=layman-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=carmines-12/&gt; 

In a [[two-party system]] like the U.S., a polarized [[legislature]] has two important characteristics: first, there is little-to-no ideological overlap between members of the two parties; and second, almost all conflict over legislation and policies is split across the broad liberal/conservative ideological divide. This leads to the conflation of political parties and ideologies (i.e., Democrat and Republican become nearly perfect synonyms for liberal and conservative) and the collapse of the ideological center.&lt;ref name="mann-12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mccarty-06" /&gt;&lt;ref name="layman-06" /&gt;&lt;ref name="carmines-12" /&gt;

The vast majority of studies on elite polarization focus on legislative and deliberative bodies. For many years, political scientists measured polarization by examining the ratings of party members published by interest groups, but now, most analyze [[recorded vote|roll-call voting]] patterns to determine trends in party-line voting and party unity.&lt;ref name="Fiorina-08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McCarty-06" /&gt; Many political scientists studying American politics rely on Poole and Rosenthal's [[NOMINATE (scaling method)|DW-NOMINATE scores]], which assign a single liberal-conservative score to each congressperson, enabling comparisons of members from different Congresses. There is much more research on polarization in Congress than on polarization in the other branches of government or in state governments.&lt;ref name="McCarty-06" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hetherington-09" /&gt;&lt;ref name="layman-06" /&gt; Azzimonti's political polarization index is more comprehensive instead because it is based on media coverage of newspaper articles reporting political disagreement about policy in all branches of government.&lt;ref&gt;Azzimonti, Marina "[http://marina-azzimonti.com/papers/Polariz2.pdf The political polarization index]"&lt;/ref&gt; Recent work by Gentzkow, Shapiro, and Taddy has used the text of the Congressional Record to document differences in speech patterns between Republicans and Democrats as a measure of polarization. They find that polarization has increased dramatically since 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Gentzkow, Matthew, and Shapiro, Jesse, and Taddy, Matt [http://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/politext.pdf Measuring Polarization in High-Dimensional Data: Method and Application to Congressional Speech]"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popular polarization===

Popular polarization, or mass polarization, occurs when the electorate's attitudes towards political issues, policies, and people are starkly divided along partisan lines. Members of the electorate and general public typically become less moderate in cases of popular polarization.&lt;ref name=mccarty-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=layman-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=carmines-12/&gt;&lt;ref name=claassen-08&gt;{{cite journal|last=Claassen|first=R.L.|author2=Highton, B.|title=Policy Polarization among Party Elites and the Significance of Political Awareness in the Mass Public|journal=Political Research Quarterly|date=9 September 2008|volume=62|issue=3|pages=538–551|doi=10.1177/1065912908322415}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., media accounts typically simplify popular polarization to a divide between [[red states and blue states]] or a "[[Culture war#United States of America|culture war]]" between values-voters and progressives. Political scientists, though, generally agree that such accounts are too simplistic and ignore the complex factors that can account for polarization.&lt;ref name=layman-06/&gt;&lt;ref name="fiorina-06"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fiorina |first=Morris P. |author2=Samuel A. Abrams |author3=Jeremy C. Pope |title=Culture War? The Myth of a Polarized America | publisher=[[Pearson Longman]] | year=2006 | isbn=978-0321276407 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many political scientists consider political polarization a top-down process, in which elite polarization leads to – or at least precedes – popular polarization. However, polarization among elites does not necessarily produce polarization within the electorate, and polarized electoral choices can often reflect elite polarization rather than voters' preferences.&lt;ref name=fiorina-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=mccarty-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=hetherington-09/&gt;&lt;ref name=carmines-12/&gt;&lt;ref name=claassen-08/&gt;

Political scientists studying popular polarization typically rely on data from [[opinion polls]] and election surveys. They look for trends in respondents' opinions on a given issue, their voting history, and their political ideology (conservative, liberal, moderate, etc.), and they try to relate those trends to respondents' party identification and other potentially polarizing factors (like geographic location or income bracket).&lt;ref name=dimaggio-96/&gt;&lt;ref name=hetherington-09/&gt; Political scientists typically limit their inquiry to issues and questions that have been constant over time, in order to compare the present day to what the political climate has historically been.&lt;ref name=claassen-08/&gt; Oft-cited public opinion polls in the U.S. include those run by the [[Pew Research Center]] and [[Gallup, Inc.]], while political scientists also rely on more academic surveys, like the [[General Social Survey]] and the election surveys and "feeling thermometer" polls conducted by [[National Election Studies]].&lt;ref name=fiorina-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=layman-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=carmines-12/&gt;&lt;ref name=claassen-08/&gt;

==Causes==
There are various causes of political polarization and these include political parties, [[redistricting]], the public's [[political ideologies|political ideology]], and the mass media.

===Party polarization===
Some scholars argue that diverging parties has been one of the major driving forces of polarization as policy platforms have become more distant. This theory is based on recent trends in the [[United States Congress]], where the [[majority party]] prioritizes the positions that are most aligned with its [[party platform]] and political ideology.&lt;ref name=ura-12&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ura|first=Joseph Daniel|author2=Ellis, Christopher R.|title=Partisan Moods: Polarization and the Dynamics of Mass Party Preferences|journal=The Journal of Politics|date=10 February 2012|volume=74|issue=1|pages=277–291|doi=10.1017/S0022381611001587}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adoption of more ideologically distinct positions by political parties can cause polarization among both elites and the electorate. For example, after the passage of the [[Voting Rights Act]], the number of conservative Democrats in Congress decreased, while the number of conservative Republicans increased. Within the electorate during the 1970s, [[Southern Democrats]] shifted toward the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], showing polarization among both the elites and the electorate of both main parties.&lt;ref name=mann-12 /&gt;&lt;ref name=abramowitz-98&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abramowitz|first=Alan I.|author2=Saunders, Kyle L.|title=Ideological Realignment in the U.S. Electorate|journal=The Journal of Politics|date=August 1998|volume=60|issue=3|page=634|doi=10.2307/2647642|jstor=10.2307/2647642}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=galston-09&gt;{{cite journal|last=Galston|first=William A.|title=Political Polarization and the U.S. Judiciary|journal=UKMC Law Review|year=2009|volume=77|issue=207|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/umkc77&amp;div=15&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political scientists have shown politicians have an incentive to advance and support polarized positions.&lt;ref name=beniers-07&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beniers|first=Klaas J.|author2=Dur, Robert|title=Politicians’ motivation, political culture, and electoral competition|journal=International Tax and Public Finance|date=1 February 2007|volume=14|issue=1|pages=29–54|doi=10.1007/s10797-006-8878-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; These argue that during the early 1990s, the Republican Party used polarizing tactics to become the majority party in the [[United States House of Representatives]]—which political scientists [[Thomas E. Mann]] and [[Norman Ornstein]] refer to as [[Newt Gingrich]]'s "guerrilla war."&lt;ref name=mann-12/&gt; What political scientists have found is that moderates are less likely to run than are candidates who are in line with party doctrine, otherwise known as "party fit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomsen|first1=Danielle M.|title=Ideological Moderates Won't Run: How Party Fit Matters for Partisan Polarization in Congress|journal=The Journal of Politics|date=2014|volume=76|issue=3|pages=786–797|doi=10.1017/s0022381614000243|jstor=0022381614000243}}&lt;/ref&gt;Other theories state politicians who cater to more extreme groups within their party tend to be more successful, helping them stay in office while simultaneously pulling their constituency toward a polar extreme.&lt;ref name=hirano-09&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hirano|first=Shigeo, Jr. |author2=James M. Snyder |author3=Michael M. Ting|title=Distributive Politics with Primaries|journal=Journal of Politics|year=2009|volume=71|issue=4|pages=1467–1480|url=http://www.yale.org/leitner/resources/docs/snyder.pdf|doi=10.1017/s0022381609990247}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by Nicholson (2012) found voters are more polarized by contentious statements from leaders of the opposing party than from the leaders of their own party. As a result, political leaders may be more likely to take polarized stances.&lt;ref name=nicholson-12&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nicholson|first=Stephen P.|title=Polarizing Cues|journal=American Journal of Political Science|date=1 January 2012|volume=56|issue=1|pages=52–66|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00541.x|pmid=22400143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With regards to [[multiparty systems]], [[Giovanni Sartori]] (1966, 1976) claims the splitting of ideologies in the public constituency causes further divides within the political parties of the countries. He theorizes that the extremism of public ideological movement is the basis for the creation of highly polarized multiparty systems. Sartori named this polarizing phenomenon [[polarized pluralism]] and claimed it would lead to further polarization in many opposing directions (as opposed to in simply two directions, as in a polarized two-party system) over policy issues.&lt;ref name=sartori-66&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sartori|first=Giovanni|title=European political parties: the case of polarized pluralism|journal=Political Parties and Political Development|year=1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sartori-76&gt;{{cite book|last=Sartori|first=Giovanni|title=Parties and party systems : a framework for analysis|year=1976|publisher=ECPR|location=Colchester|isbn=978-0954796617|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ywr0CcGDNHwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|edition=[Nouvelle édition]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=johnston-08&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnston|first=Richard|title=Polarized Pluralism in the Canadian Party System: Presidential Address to the Canadian Political Science Association, June 5, 2008|journal=Canadian Journal of Political Science|date=17 December 2008|volume=41|issue=4|page=815|doi=10.1017/S0008423908081110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polarization in multiparty systems can also be defined along two ideological extremes, like in the case of [[India]] in the 1970s. Ideological splits within a number of India's major parties resulted in two polarized coalitions on the right and left, each consisting of multiple political parties.&lt;ref name=davey-72&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davey|first=Hampton|title=Polarization and Consensus in Indian Party Politics|journal=Asian Survey|date=1 August 1972|volume=12|issue=8|pages=701–716|doi=10.2307/2643110|jstor=10.2307/2643110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political fund-raisers and donors can also exert significant influence and control over legislators. Party leaders are expected to be productive fund-raisers, in order to support the party's campaigns. After ''[[Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission]]'', special interests in the U.S. were able to greatly impact elections through increased undisclosed spending, notably through [[Super PACs|Super political action committees]]. Some, such as ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' opinion writer [[Robert G. Kaiser|Robert Kaiser]], argued this allowed wealthy people, corporations, unions, and other groups to push the parties' policy platforms toward ideological extremes, resulting in a state of greater polarization.&lt;ref name=mann-12 /&gt;&lt;ref name=kaiser-10&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaiser|first=Robert G.|title=So damn much money : the triumph of lobbying and the corrosion of American government|year=2010|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0307385888|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AJxU1MzQZVoC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|edition=1st Vintage Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars, such as Raymond J. La Raja and David L. Wiltse, note that this does not necessarily hold true for mass donors to political campaigns. These scholars argue a single donor who is polarized and contributes large sums to a campaign does not seem to usually drive a politician toward political extremes.&lt;ref name=la-raja-11&gt;{{cite journal|last=La Raja|first=R.J.|author2=Wiltse, D.L.|title=Don't Blame Donors for Ideological Polarization of Political Parties: Ideological Change and Stability Among Political Contributors, 1972–2008|journal=American Politics Research|date=13 December 2011|volume=40|issue=3|pages=501–530|doi=10.1177/1532673X11429845|url=http://apr.sagepub.com/content/40/3/501.short}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tam-cho-07"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tam Cho|first=Wendy K.|author2=Gimpel, James G.|title=Prospecting for (Campaign) Gold|journal=American Journal of Political Science|date=1 April 2007|volume=51|issue=2|pages=255–268|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5907.2007.00249.x|url=http://cho.pol.illinois.edu/wendy/papers/krige.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The public===
In democracies and other [[Representative democracy|representative governments]], citizens vote for the political actors who will represent them. Some scholars argue that political polarization reflects the public's ideology and voting preferences.&lt;ref name=galston-09/&gt;&lt;ref name=garner-10&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Garner | first1 = Andrew | last2 = Palmer | first2 = Harvey | title = Polarization and issue consistency over time | journal = [[Political Behavior (journal)|Political Behavior]] | volume = 33 | issue = 2 | pages = 225–246 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | doi = 10.1007/s11109-010-9136-7 | date = June 2011 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11109-010-9136-7 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mason-12&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mason|first=Lilliana |title=The rise of uncivil agreement: issue versus behavioral polarization in the American electorate|journal=[[American Behavioral Scientist]]|date=January 2013|volume=57|issue=1|pages=140–159 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] |doi= 10.1177/0002764212463363 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0002764212463363 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=murakami-07&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murakami|first=Michael H.|title=How party polarization affects candidate evaluations: the role of ideology|journal=Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Political Science Association, Hyatt Regency Chicago and the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers, Chicago, Illinois |year=2007|url=http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/1/0/3/3/pages210336/p210336-1.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dixit and Weibull (2007) claim that political polarization is a natural and regular phenomenon. They argue that there is a link between public differences in ideology and the polarization of representatives, but that an increase in preference differences is usually temporary and ultimately results in compromise.&lt;ref name=dixit-07&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dixit|first1=Avinash K. | last2 = Weibull |first2= Jörgen W. |title=Political polarization|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]|date=1 May 2007|volume=104|issue=18 |pages=7351–7356 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0702071104 | jstor = 25427490 | publisher = [[National Academy of Sciences]] | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0702071104 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Morris P.

Religious, ethnic, and other cultural divides within the public have often influenced the emergence of polarization. According to Layman et al. (2005), the ideological split between U.S. Republicans and Democrats also crosses into the religious cultural divide. They claim that Democrats have generally become more [[moderate]] in religious views whereas Republicans have become more traditionalist. For example, political scientists have shown that in the United States, voters who identify as Republican are more likely to vote for a strongly [[evangelical]] candidate than Democratic voters.&lt;ref name=campbell-11&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell|first1=David E.|last2 = Green | first2 = John C. | last3 = Layman | first3 = Geoffrey C. |title=The party faithful: partisan images, candidate religion, and the electoral impact of party identification|journal=[[American Journal of Political Science]]|date= January 2011|volume=55|issue=1|pages=42–58 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-5907.2010.00474.x | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2010.00474.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; This correlates with the rise in polarization in the United States.&lt;ref name=layman-05&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Layman |first1= Geoffrey C. | last2 =Green | first2 = John C. |title=Wars and rumours of wars: the contexts of cultural conflict in American political behaviour|journal=[[British Journal of Political Science]]|date=January 2006|volume=36|issue=1 |pages=61–89 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press|Cambridge Journals]] |doi=10.1017/S0007123406000044 | jstor = 4092316 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0007123406000044  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory contends that religion does not contribute to full-group polarization, but rather, [[coalition]] and party activist polarization causes party shifts toward a political extreme.&lt;ref name=brooks-04&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://sociology.fas.nyu.edu/docs/IO/3858/A_Great_Divide.pdf|last=Brooks|first=Clem|author2=Manza, Jeff|title=A great divide?

In some post-colonial countries, the public may be polarized along ethnic divides that remain from the colonial regime.&lt;ref name=bhavnani-08&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bhavnani|first1=Ravi | last2 =Miodownik | first2= Dan|title=Ethnic polarization, ethnic salience, and Civil War |journal=[[Journal of Conflict Resolution]] |date=February 2009 |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=30–49 |doi=10.1177/0022002708325945 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0022002708325945 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[South Africa]] in the late 1980s, members of the conservative, pro-apartheid [[National Party of South Africa]] were no longer supportive of [[apartheid]], and, therefore, no longer ideologically aligned with their party.

[[Economic inequality]] can also motivate the polarization of the public. For example, in post-[[World War I]] [[Germany]], the [[Communist Workers Party of Germany|Communist Workers Party]], and the [[Nazism|National Socialists]], a [[fascism|fascist]] party, emerged as the dominant political ideologies and proposed to address Germany's economic problems in drastically different ways.&lt;ref name=sartori-66/&gt;&lt;ref name=sartori-76/&gt; In [[Venezuela]] in the late 20th century, the entrance of the oil industry into the local economy caused economic disparities that led to sharp ideological divides.

===Redistricting===
[[Gerrymandering]] or the manipulation of the electoral borders to favor a political party or the electoral outcome affect the redistricting process in the U.S. It has been linked to the rise in polarization by some political scientists.&lt;ref name=yoshinaka-11&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yoshinaka|first=Antoine &amp; Chad Murphy|title=The Paradox of Redistricting: How Partisan Mapmakers Foster Competition but Disrupt Representation|journal=Political Research Quarterly|date=June 2011|volume=64|issue=2|pages=435–447|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/873115158/|doi=10.1177/1065912909355716}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars argue that the practice of redistricting creates political polarization by making more homogeneous, ideologically distinct districts.

(2007), this makes it easier for more extreme candidates to win elections (and re-election) as the makeup of the voting block shifts in the direction of a polar extreme. This effect is more modest when analyzed over multiple election cycles and in the United States as a whole.&lt;ref name=carson-07&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carson|first=J.L.|author2=Crespin, M.H. |author3=Finocchiaro, C.J. |author4= Rohde, D.W. |title=Redistricting and Party Polarization in the U.S. House of Representatives|journal=American Politics Research|date=28 September 2007|volume=35|issue=6|pages=878–904|doi=10.1177/1532673X07304263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Politically motivated redistricting has been associated with the rise in partisanship in the U.S. House of Representatives between 1992 and 1994.&lt;ref name=mckee-08&gt;{{cite journal|last=McKee|first=SEth C.|title=The Effects of Redistricting on Voting Behavior in Incumbent U.S. House Elections, 1992–1994|journal=Political Research Quarterly|date=March 2008|volume=61|issue=1|pages=122–133|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/215329960?accountid=10141|doi=10.1177/1065912907306473}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kousser-96&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kousser|first=J|title=Estimating the Partisan Consequences of Redistricting Plans – Simply|journal=Legislative Studies Quarterly|date=November 1996|volume=21|issue=4|pages=521–541|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/60821189?accountid=10141|doi=10.2307/440460|jstor=440460}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many political scientists however, argue that redistricting practices have not played a major role in causing political polarization.

===The media===
The mass media has grown as an institution over the past half-century. Political scientists argue that this has particularly affected the voting public in the last three decades, as previously less partisan viewers are given more polarized news media choices. The mass media's current, fragmented, high-choice environment has induced a movement of the audience from more even-toned political programming to more antagonistic and one-sided broadcasts and articles. These programs tend to appeal to partisan viewers who watch the polarized programming as a self-confirming source for their ideologies.&lt;ref name=mann-12/&gt;&lt;ref name=hetherington-09/&gt;&lt;ref name=hollander-08&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hollander|first=B.A.|title=Tuning Out or Tuning Elsewhere?

(2010). ''Program or be programmed: Ten commands for a digital age.'' Berkeley, CA: Soft Skull Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This method of personalizing web content results in ''[[filter bubble]]s'', a term coined by digital activist [[Eli Pariser]] that refers to the polarized ideological bubbles that are created by computer algorithms filtering out unrelated information and opposing views.&lt;ref&gt;Pariser, E. (2011). ''The filter bubble: What the internet is hiding from you''. New York, NY: The Penguin Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 study found ideological segregation of online news consumption is lower than the segregation of most offline news consumption and lower than the segregation of face-to-face interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gentzkow|first=Matthew|last2=Shapiro|first2=Jesse M.|date=2011-11-01|title=Ideological Segregation Online and Offline *|url=https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/126/4/1799/1924154/Ideological-Segregation-Online-and-Offline?redirectedFrom=fulltext|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|language=en|volume=126|issue=4|pages=1799–1839|doi=10.1093/qje/qjr044|issn=0033-5533}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the filter bubbles effects of online media consumption are exaggerated. Other research also shows that online media does not contribute to the increased polarization of opinions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hohenberg|first=Clemm von|last2=Bernhard|last3=Maes|first3=Michael|last4=Pradelski|first4=Bary S.R.|date=2017-05-25|title=Micro influence and macro dynamics of opinions|ssrn=2974413}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 study found that providing people with impartial, objective information has the potential to reduce political polarization, but the effect of information on polarization is highly sensitive to contextual factors. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duhaime|first=Erik|last2=Apfelbaum|first2=Evan|date=2017|title=Can Information Decrease Political Polarization? Evidence From the U.S. Taxpayer Receipt |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550616687126|journal=Social Psychological and Personality Science|volume=8|issue=7|page=736|language=en|doi=10.1177/1948550616687126}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, polarization over government spending was reduced when people were provided with a "Taxpayer Receipt," but not when they were also asked how they wanted the money to be spent.  This suggests that subtle factors like the mood and tone of partisan news sources may have a large effect on how the same information is interpreted.

===The public===

Opinions on polarization's effects on the public are mixed. Some argue that the growing polarization in government has directly contributed to political polarization in the electorate,&lt;ref name=layman-06/&gt; but this is not unanimous.&lt;ref name=wilkerson-13/&gt;&lt;ref name=hibbing-08&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hibbing|first=John R.|author2=Christopher W.

Some scholars argue that polarization lowers public interest in politics, [[party identification]] and [[voter turnout]].&lt;ref name=layman-06/&gt; It encourages confrontational dynamics between parties that can lower overall public trust and approval in government.&lt;ref name="hetherington-08"&gt;{{cite book|title=Red and blue nation?

Brady|location=Washington, DC|chapter=Turned Off or Turned On? How Polarization Affects Political Engagement}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and causes the public to perceive the general political debate as less civil,&lt;ref name=layman-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=brady-06/&gt; which can alienate voters. More polarized candidates, especially when voters aren't aware of the increase, also tend to be less representative of the public's wishes.&lt;ref name="layman-06" /&gt;&lt;ref name="brady-06" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hetherington-08" /&gt;

On the other hand, others assert that elite polarization has galvanized the public's political participation in the United States, citing greater voting and nonvoting participation, engagement and investment in campaigns, and increased positive attitude toward government responsiveness.&lt;ref name=hetherington-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=dodson-10&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dodson|first=Kyle|title=The Return of the American Voter?

===The media===

As Mann and Ornstein argue, political polarization and the proliferation of media sources have "reinforce[d] tribal divisions, while enhancing a climate where facts are no longer driving the debate and deliberation, nor are they shared by the larger public."&lt;ref name=mann-12/&gt;  As other scholars have argued, the media often support and provoke the stall and closed rules tactics that disrupt regular policy procedure.&lt;ref name=mann-12/&gt;&lt;ref name=mutz-06&gt;{{cite book|last=Mutz|first=Diana C.|title=Red and blue nation?

While the media are not immune to general public opinion and reduced polarization allows them to appeal to a larger audience,&lt;ref name=rosenstiel-06&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenstiel|first=Thomas|title=Red and blue nation? Volume One: characteristics and causes of America's polarized politics|year=2006|publisher=Brookings Institution|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-0815760832|chapter=Two Alternative Perspectives}}&lt;/ref&gt; polarized environments make it easier for the media and [[advocacy group|interest groups]] to hold elected officials more accountable for their policy promises and positions,&lt;ref name="epstein-07" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mutz-06" /&gt; generally healthy for democracy.&lt;ref name="epstein-07" /&gt;

===Judicial systems===

[[Judicial system]]s can also be affected by the implications of political polarization. For the United States, in particular, polarization lowers confirmation rates of judges;&lt;ref name=binder-00/&gt; In 2012, the confirmation rate of presidential circuit court appointments was approximately 50% as opposed to the above 90% rate in the late 1970s and early 1980s.&lt;ref name=mann-12/&gt; More polarized parties have more aggressively block nominees and used tactics to hinder executive agendas.&lt;ref name=binder-00/&gt;&lt;ref name=dionne-10&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dionne|first=E.J., Jr.|author2=William A. Galston|title=A Half-Empty Government Can't Govern: Why Everyone Wants to Fix the Appointments Process, Why It Never Happens, and How We Can Get It Done|journal=Brookings|date=14 December 2010|url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2010/12/14-appointments-galston-dionne}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political scientist Sarah Binder (2000) argues that "senatorial intolerance for the opposing party’s nominees is itself a function of polarization."&lt;ref name=binder-00/&gt; Negative consequences of this include higher vacancy rates on appellate courts, longer case-processing times and increased caseloads for judges.&lt;ref name=mann-12/&gt;&lt;ref name=galston-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=binder-00/&gt;

Political scientists argue that in highly polarized periods, nominees become less reflective of the moderate voter as "polarization impacts the appointment and ideological tenor of new federal judges."&lt;ref name=binder-00/&gt; It also influences the politics of senatorial [[advice and consent]], giving partisan presidents the power to appoint judges far to the left or right of center on the federal bench, obstructing the legitimacy of the judicial branch.&lt;ref name=galston-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=binder-00/&gt;

Ultimately, the increasing presence of ideology in a judicial system impacts the judiciary's credibility.&lt;ref name=epstein-07/&gt;  Polarization can generate strong partisan critiques of federal judges, which can damage the public perception of the justice system and the legitimacy of the courts as nonpartisan legal arbiters.&lt;ref name=binder-00/&gt;&lt;ref name="wittes-08"&gt;{{cite book|title=Red and blue nation?

Brady|edition=[Online-Ausg.]|location=Washington, DC|chapter=Comments on Chapter 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Foreign policy===

Political polarization can undercut unified agreement on [[foreign policy]] and harm a nation's international standing;&lt;ref name=epstein-07/&gt;&lt;ref name=mccormick-90&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCormick|first=James M.|author2=Eugene R. Wittkopf|title=Bipartisanship, Partisanship, and Ideology in Congressional-Executive Foreign Policy Relations, 1947–1988|journal=The Journal of Politics|date=November 1990|volume=52|issue=4|pages=1077–1100|url=http://www3.nccu.edu.tw/~lorenzo/McCormick%20Wittkopf%20Bipartisanship.pdf|doi=10.2307/2131683}}&lt;/ref&gt; divisiveness on foreign affairs  strengthens enemies, discourages allies and destabilize a nation's determination.&lt;ref name=epstein-07/&gt;

Political scientists point to two primary implications of polarization with regards to the [[Foreign policy of the United States|foreign policy of the United States"]]. First, when the United States conducts relations abroad and appears divided, allies are less likely to trust its promises, enemies are more likely to predict its weaknesses, and uncertainty as to the country's position in world affairs rises.&lt;ref name="mccormick-90" /&gt;&lt;ref name=wilson-08&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=James Q.|title=Red and blue nation?

== Global Perspective ==
Outside of the U.S., there are plenty of modern day examples of polarization in politics. A bulk of the research into global polarization comes from Europe. One example includes [[Pasokification]] in Greece. This is the trend from a shift from the center-left to a more far-left stance. Pasokification was caused by the Greek populous growing dissatisfied with the country's centrist, left wing party and how they handled the [[Great Recession]] and the austerity measures the European Union put in place during recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blackwater|first=Bill|date=Summer 2016|title=Morality and left-wing politics: a case study of Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party|url=|journal=Renewal|volume=24|pages=|via=Gale Literature Resource Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the shift further to the left was a massive benefits to the liberal population in Greece, the results in Greece (as well as other nations like Germany, Sweden and Italy) have not been able to sustain themselves. Parties who have made the shift left have recently shown a decline in the voting booths, evidence their supporters are uneasy of the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eaton|first=George|date=2018|title=Corbynism 2.0|url=|journal=New Statesman|volume=147|pages=|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The shift in Greece to the far-left is similar to the shift in countries like Poland, France and the U.K. to more far-right conservative positions. In those countries, there is heavy anti-Islam sentiment and the rise of [[Populism|populist]] commentary. The general population of the right in these countries tends to hold onto these more aggressive stances and pulls the parties further to the right. These stances include populist messages with Islamophobic, isolationist, and anti-LGBTQ language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zarkov|first=Dubravka|date=2017-06-16|title=Populism, polarization and social justice activism|journal=European Journal of Women's Studies|language=en|volume=24|issue=3|pages=197–201|doi=10.1177/1350506817713439|issn=1350-5068}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Palonen|first=Emilia|date=2009|title=Political Polarisation and Populism in Contemporary Hungary|url=|journal=Parliamentary Affairs|volume=62|pages=318-334|via=Electronic Journal Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the polarization in these nations leads to either a more socialist left wing party, or more nationalist right wing party. These more polarized parties grow from the discontent of more moderate parties inability to provide progressive changes in either direction.   

== Critiques ==
There have long been numerous scholarly debates that argue over the concept of political polarization, both in whether it is valid, and how it can accurately be measured. There are four primary arguments against the validity of political polarization: 1) Limitations of the Two-Party System, 2) Issue Partisanship, 3) Cultural Differences, and 4) Westernized Focuses.

=== Limitations of the two-party system ===
By solely acknowledging voting patterns, one cannot make an accurate conclusion as to the presence or absence of political polarization, because in the United States, there is a limited number of presidential candidates in the two-party system. To assume that the majority of voters are mostly or completely in agreement with the plethora of political issues within their party is a false assumption.&lt;ref name="Baldassarri-08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fiorina-08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fiorina-06" /&gt; Despite contrary beliefs, there are many liberal Republicans and conservative Democrats in the U.S. who have differing political beliefs within their parties. However, these voters most often align with their party because of the limited choice of candidates, and to do otherwise (i.e. vote for a third-party candidate) is perceived as a waste of time.&lt;ref name="Baldassarri-08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fiorina-08" /&gt;

=== Issue partisanship ===
Despite various claims that argue American society is more polarized today than leading up to the U.S. Civil War,&lt;ref name="abramowitz-08" /&gt; numerous scholars explain that much evidence shows there is a relatively stable public opinion on the majority of sociopolitical issues.&lt;ref name="baldassarri-08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fiorina-06" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Religion, politics, and support for same-sex marriage in the United States, 1988–2008|last = Sherkat|first = Darren|date = 2011|journal = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Where the most polarization exists, rather, is in the "hot topic" or "sensitive" issues (e.g. abortion, gay marriage, U.S. involvement in war).&lt;ref name="layman-06" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Polarization, secularization, or differences as usual? The denominational cleavage in U.S. social attitudes since the 1970s.|last = Bolzendahl|first = |date = 2005|journal = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over-reliance on focusing on opinions regarding social issues to draw conclusion about political polarization is not a valid measurement to fully represent the concept.&lt;ref name="fiorina-08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fiorina-06" /&gt;

In regard to views on public policies, Fiorina and Abrams (2008) found virtually no evidence of an increase in widespread political polarization over the past thirty years. Nonetheless, many scholars explain that it is not an increase in ideological coherence among individuals which separates them; it is the partisan extremism (i.e. Democrat v. Republican) which eventually separates voters into one party or the other.&lt;ref name="baldassarri-08" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Political polarization projection: Social projection of partisan attitude extremity and attitudinal processes.|last = Van Boven|first = |date = 2012|journal = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Religious convictions and political choice|last = Greenawalt|first = Kent|publisher = |year = 1988|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural differences ===
Proponents of the cultural differences argument are critical of political polarization because of numerous factors, influences, and demographics.&lt;ref name="abramowitz-05" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Purple America|last = Ansolabehere|first = |date = 2006|journal = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The future of red, blue and purple America.|last = Teixeira|first = |publisher = |year = 2009|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among voter demographic features, there is much evidence of race, sex, age, and educational attainment as being some of the main influences in voting behaviors.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/elections/how_groups_voted/voted_12.html|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20130123073800/http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/elections/how_groups_voted/voted_12.html|dead-url =yes|archive-date =2013-01-23|title =U.S. elections: How groups voted in 2012|date =2012|accessdate =|website =|publisher =|last =|first =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these factors, the geographic region often plays a major role in voting behavior.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Lastly, one's socioeconomic status is a reliable predictor of voting behavior.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://hdl.handle.net/10022/AC:P:8392|title = Voting behavior based on socioeconomic status|last = Brown|first = |date = 2009|journal = |doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of these factors and influences compel researchers to reconsider the causes of political polarization.

=== Westernized focus ===
Much like many academic studies, political polarization scholars often are too narrowly focused within one nation and, thus, make broad generalizations regarding the concept from a national study. To have a better picture of the presence or absence of political polarization, scholars must consider widening the scope of their studies to the international contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Globalization's cultural consequences|last = Holton|first = |date = 2000|journal = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Globalization and culture: Global mélange.|last = Pieterse|first = |publisher = |year = 2009|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{expert needed|1=Mathematics|date=July 2015}}
Engineers use '''reflection lines''' to judge a surface's ''quality''. Reflection lines reveal surface flaws, particularly discontinuities in normals indicating that the surface is not &lt;math&gt;C^2&lt;/math&gt;. Reflection lines may be created and examined on physical surfaces or virtual surfaces with the help of [[computer graphics]]. For example, the shiny surface of an [[automobile body]] is illuminated with reflection lines by surrounding the car with parallel light sources. Virtually, a surface can be rendered with reflection lines by modulating the surfaces point-wise color according to a simple calculation involving the [[surface normal]], viewing direction and a [[square wave]] [[environment map]].

[[File:Reflection-lines-biharmonic-triharmonic.jpg|thumbnail|Reflection lines visualized on surfaces ''completed'' using a biharmonic and triharmonic equation with &lt;math&gt;C^1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C^2&lt;/math&gt; surface continuity respectively. Derivative discontinuities near the yellow-purple boundary on the left reveal normal discontinuities. Below are pseudocolor visualizations of curvature.]]

== Mathematical Definition ==

Let us consider a point  &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; on a surface &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; with (possibly non-unit length) normal &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. If an observer views this point from infinity at an incoming direction &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; then the reflected view direction &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is:

&lt;math&gt; r = (2/|n|^2)((n \cdot v)n -v).&lt;/math&gt;

For reflection lines we consider repeated infinite, non-dispersive light sources parallel to some line &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and therefore perpendicular to a plane &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. Define the vector &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; to be the reflection direction &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; projected onto the plane &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;d = r - (r \cdot a)a &lt;/math&gt;

and similarly let &lt;math&gt;v_a&lt;/math&gt; be the unit viewing direction projected onto &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;v_a = \hat{v_a}/|\hat{v_a}|, \hat{v_a} = v - (v \cdot a)a&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, define &lt;math&gt;a^\perp&lt;/math&gt; to be the direction lying in &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; perpendicular to &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_a&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;a^\perp = a \times v_a&lt;/math&gt;

Then the *reflection line function* &lt;math&gt;\theta(p): M \rightarrow (-\pi,\pi]&lt;/math&gt; is a [[scalar function]] mapping points on the surface to angles between &lt;math&gt;v_a&lt;/math&gt; and the projected reflected view direction &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;\theta = \arctan{L( r \cdot a^\perp,r \cdot v_a)}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;arctan(y,x)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[atan2]] function producing a number in the range &lt;math&gt;(-\pi,\pi]&lt;/math&gt;.

Finally, to render the reflection lines positive values &lt;math&gt;\theta&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; are mapped to a light color and non-positive values to a dark color.&lt;ref&gt;Gingold et al. "Shape Optimization Using Reflection Lines"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Highlight lines ==

'''Highlight lines''' are a view-independent alternative to reflection lines.&lt;ref&gt;Beier and Chen. "Highlight-line algorithm for realtime surface-quality assessment"&lt;/ref&gt; Here the projected normal is directly compared against some arbitrary vector &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; perpendicular to the light source:

&lt;math&gt;\theta = \arctan{( n_a \cdot a^\perp,n_a \cdot x)}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;n_a&lt;/math&gt; is the surface normal projected on the light source plane &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;\hat{n_a}/|\hat{n_a}|, \hat{n_a} = n - (n \cdot a)a&lt;/math&gt;

The relationship between reflection lines and  highlight lines is likened to that between specular and diffuse shading.

{{Eastern Orthodox sidebar|expanded=worship}}
'''Russian Orthodox bell ringing''' has a history starting from the [[baptism of Rus]] in 988 and plays an important role in the traditions of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].

==Theology==
The ringing of bells is one of the most essential elements of an Orthodox church.&lt;ref name="ZB"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Church bell]]s are rung to:
*Summon the faithful to services
*Express the triumphal joy of the Christian Church
*Announce important moments during the services both to those in church and to those who are not able to be physically present in the church, so that all may be united in prayer
*Strengthen Christians in piety and faith by its sound, which Orthodox Christians believe is "alloyed with divine grace to disperse and destroy the forces of cruelty and of demonic suggestion"&lt;ref name="RB"&gt;{{Citation

*Proclaim important events, such as the death of a member of the church; the arrival of an important person, such as the [[bishop]] or civil ruler; an emergency such as [[fire]] or [[flood]]; or victory in battle (as dramatically recreated in the triumphant conclusion of the [[1812 Overture]]).

The use of bells is not only practical, but is also considered to be spiritual. Bells are sometimes referred to as "singing icons", because they establish the [[acoustics|acoustic]] space of an Orthodox [[temple]] just as painted [[icon]]s and [[hymnology|hymnography]] define its visual and [[nous|noetic]] space, respectively.  Icons are considered "scripture in image" as bells are "scripture in sound".

There are several liturgical services which point out the importance of bells in the Russian Orthodox Church: ''[[Blessing]] the [[Foundation (engineering)|Foundation]] of a New [[Bell tower|Bell Tower]]'', ''Blessing a New Bell Tower'' (after construction is completed), ''Blessing, Naming, and [[Chrismation|Chrismating]] a Bell''. There is also a service for the blessing of a bell ringer.

Bells are blessed with a ritual containing many of the elements of the [[Baptism|Rite of Baptism]]. The new bell is blessed with [[holy water]] and [[censed]], both outside and inside, and the priest [[Laying on of hands|lays hands]] on the bell to bless it.  During the rite, the bell is "named" (that is, [[consecration|consecrated]] in honour of a [[saint]], whose [[icon]] has often been molded into the side of the bell when it was [[Bellfounding|cast]] at the [[foundry]]—but though a bell may be called the "Gabriel" bell, it would never be called the "St. Gabriel" bell, because a bell is not a saint).

The bell is also [[anointed]] with [[chrism]], just as an Orthodox Christian is at [[chrismation]]. The theological understanding of bells as "weapons" in [[spiritual warfare]], and their role in the Christian life is emphasized during the rite by the [[scripture]] [[lection|lesson]] from {{bibleverse||Numbers|10:1-10|HE}}:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: Make for yourself two silver trumpets … And they shall be for you for the calling of the assembly … When you sound an alarm … And if you shall go forth to war … And in the days of your rejoicing …"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The use of bells is symbolic of the proclamation of the [[Gospel]]. Sometimes Orthodox churches and monasteries will combine the use of bells with the striking of a wooden or metal [[semantron]], with the semantron being sounded first, then the bells being rung later. The quieter and simpler sound of the semantron is understood to symbolize the [[Old Testament]] [[prophet]]s, for it is the symbol only of a coming event, whereas the ringing of the bells is spread far into the air symbolizing the annunciation of the Gospel throughout the world.&lt;ref name="RB"/&gt;

==History==
[[Image:The Tsar Bell Moscow.jpg|thumb|The [[Tsar Bell]] standing beside the [[Ivan the Great Bell Tower]] in [[Moscow]]; the sculpting of the wall of the bell can be seen in the broken section.]]

After the conversion of [[Kievan Rus]] to Christianity in the 10th century, bells came gradually into use everywhere. Originally, a flat piece of wood or metal called a [[semantron]] would be beaten rhythmically with a mallot to summon the faithful to services.  This was especially true in [[monastery|monasteries]], some of which still to this day use both semantrons and bells.

While the semantron was inherited from Greece, the use of church bells was imported into Russia from Western Europe.&lt;ref name="ZB"/&gt;  The [[Russian language|Russian]] word for bell is ''kolokol'', which comes from the German word ''glocke'', derived from the Latin ''clocca'', which in turn appears to come from the Irish ''clog''.&lt;ref name="CatEn"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;   The word for bell in [[Church Slavonic]] is ''kampan'', which is derived from Latin ''campana''. During the fifteenth century the semantron began to be gradually replaced by bells.&lt;ref name="RB"/&gt;  At that time, several [[foundry|foundries]] for [[Bellfounding|bell making]] were established in Russia.  Russian church bells are commonly cast using a mixture of bronze and tin, often with silver added to the [[bell metal]], to produce their unique sonority and resonance. Russian bells also tend to differ from Western bells in the proportion of their height to width, and the method of varying the thickness of the walls of the bell. The clapper ("tongue") of the bell also follows a different design than that used in the West.

The art of bellfounding reached its pinnacle in the 18th century, with the production of unimaginably huge bells. The largest bell in the world, the [[Tsar Bell]] (218 [[Short ton|tons]]) was cast in 1733 for the [[Ivan the Great Bell Tower]] in [[Moscow]]. Unfortunately, the Tsar Bell was damaged in a fire in 1737 before it could be successfully hung, and stands today at the base of the tower. The largest working bell in the world is the [[Dormition]] Bell (144,000 [[pound (mass)|lb]]) which hangs in the same Ivan the Great Bell Tower.

After the [[Bolshevik Revolution]], the [[Soviet Union]] severely [[persecution of Christians|persecuted Christianity]]. Numerous bells were destroyed and during certain periods the production of church bells all but stopped. After [[revolutions of 1989|the fall of the Iron Curtain]] the production of bells resumed, and has experienced a surge of activity as many of the churches that were destroyed are being rebuilt.

==Technique of ringing==

[[File:Bell-ringer yaroslavl 2012.ogv|thumb|Bell-ringer demonstrating Russian ringing on a portable belfry]]

Technically, bells rung in the Russian tradition are sounded exclusively by [[Chime (bell instrument)|chiming]] (i.e., moving only the clapper so that it strikes the side of a stationary bell) and never by swinging the bell. For the Russian tradition a special complex system of ropes is used, designed individually for each belltower. All the ropes are gathered at approximately one point, where the bell-ringer (''zvonar'') stands. Some ropes (the smaller ones) are played by hand, the bigger ropes are played by foot. The major part of the ropes (usually - all ropes) are not actually pulled, but rather pressed. Since one end of every rope is fixed, and the ropes are kept in tension, a press or even a punch on a rope makes a clapper strike the side of its bell.

The secrets of this technique have passed from generation to generation, but by the 20th century this art was almost lost. Training took place only at workshops until 2008, then the first permanent traditional bell-ringing school opened in Moscow, under the leadership of [[Drozdihin Ilya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvkultura.ru/news.html?id=267190&amp;cid=178 |title=Russia. The TV channel "Culture". The school bell ringers opens in Moscow |publisher=Tvkultura.ru |date=2008-10-15 |accessdate=2014-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No melody is employed, as in the Western [[carillon]], but rather a complicated polyrhythmical sequence of sounds is produced. "The foundation of Orthodox bell ringing lies not in melody but in rhythm, with its intrinsic dynamic, and in the interaction of the [[timbre]]s of [various] bells."&lt;ref name="RB"/&gt; These sequences have a very special [[harmony]], since Russian bells (unlike Western European ones) are not tuned to a single note.  Western bells usually have an [[octave]] between the loudest upper tone ("ring") and the loudest lower tone ("hum"). Russian bells have a [[Leading-tone|seventh]] between these sounds. Generally, a good Russian bell is tuned to produce a whole scale of sounds (up to several dozen of them). This effect is accomplished both by the composition of the [[alloy]] from which the bell is cast and the sculpting of the sides of the bell in the mold.

==Types of ringing==
[[Image:C0230-Old-Kstovo-church.jpg|thumb|A bell-ringer works the ropes on top of a small church in Old [[Kstovo]].]]

The Russian Orthodox [[typicon]] provides for different types of [[Campanology|bell ringing]]. Different ringing is used on different days (on working days, on Sunday, on holy days, during [[Fasting|fast]]s, [[Lent]], [[Easter]] etc.) Different ringing is required for different services (for morning service, service for the dead, [[Liturgy]], etc.). These differences are accomplished by ringing particular bells in particular ways.

===Terminology===
To understand the Russian Orthodox method of bell ringing, it is necessary to recognize a few items of terminology. The bells in an Orthodox bell tower (''zvonnitsa'') are organized into three groups:
* ''Zazvonny''— the smallest, or [[soprano]] bells.
* ''Podzvonny''— the middle, or [[alto]] bells.
* ''Blagovestnik''— the largest, or [[Bass (vocal range)|bass]] bells.

Within each of these three groups there may be several bells of varying size, all within the general range of the group. The larger the bell, the deeper its voice.

A ''zvon'' is a toll on any bell or bells.

A ''zvonar'' is a bell ringer. In the Orthodox church, this is a [[tonsure]]d (clerical) position, and there is a distinct service of the "Setting Apart of a Bell Ringer". The use of electric bells is forbidden in the Orthodox Church, because it is a sacred function, and may only be performed by a member of the church. Before he goes into the belltower, the zvonar will go to the priest (or the [[igumen]] if it is a [[monastery]]) for a [[blessing]] to ring the bells.

Different ringing is used at different moments of the service (before the service, during the most essential parts of the [[All-Night Vigil]] or [[Divine Liturgy]], while the departed is being carried to the [[cemetery]], etc.). Four kinds of canonical tolls are distinguished, which, rung separately or in combination, comprise all the diversity of Orthodox bell-ringing: ''Blagovest'', ''Perebor'', ''Perezvon'', and ''Trezvon''.

===Blagovest===
[[Image:Seattle - St. Nicholas Cathedral bells 02.jpg|thumb|left|Bells at St. Nicholas Russian Orthodox Memorial Cathedral, [[Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]].]]

The [[blagovest]] is the measured striking of a single large bell (called the ''blagovestnik''). Blagovest means "[[annunciation]]", or "[[Gospel|good news]]" because with this ringing the believers are notified that the [[Divine Service (Eastern Orthodoxy)|divine service]] is about to begin in the church.

As a separate toll before the beginning of a divine service, the blagovest commences
with three slow strokes (i.e., with rather long pauses between), and thereafter continues
with more frequent, measured strokes, sometimes ending with three more slow strokes. According to the Typikon, the blagovest should last for as long as it takes to read through [[Psalm 119|Psalm 118]] ([[Septuagint]]; KJV: Psalm 119) once, or [[Psalm 51|Psalm 50]] (KJV: Psalm 51) twelve times.

Depending on the type of the divine service, the blagovest is classified as "regular"
(''obyknovenny'', i.e., fast and often accomplished by swinging the clapper to both sides of
the bell), or "Lenten" (''postny'', i.e., slow, and on only one side of the bell). On [[Great Feasts]] the blagovest is tolled on the largest blagovestnik in the tower and the toll as a rule is faster, louder, and longer.

Besides the normal blagovest, in Orthodox ringing there is another, named “[[tidal]]”
(''valovoy'') or "great" (''bolshoi''), when strokes on the largest blagovestnik are mixed with
tolls on another blagovestnik.

The Blagovest can be sounded on different bells, depending on the day. Large bell towers typically have five ''Blagovestniki'' (ranged from larger to smaller): 
*[[Great Feast|Festal]] or Triumphal (''Prazdnichny'' or ''Torzhestvenny'')
*[[Polyeleos]] (''Polyeleyny'')
*[[Lord's Day|Sunday]] (''Voskresny'')
*Daily or [[Feria]]l (''Budnichny'' or ''Prostodnevny'')
*Small or [[Great Lent|Lenten]] (''Maly'' or ''Postny'').

===Perebor===
The ''Perebor'' {{lang-ru|[[:ru:Перебор|Перебор]]}}) is the funeral zvon. Each individual bell is struck once, from the smallest to the largest, in a slow, steady peal. After that, all of the bells are struck together at the same time. Striking the bells from the smallest to the largest symbolizes the stages of a person’s life from birth to death; the final striking of all the bells together symbolizes the end of earthly life. During the perebor, each stroke of a bell should not be made until the sound of the previous bell has died away. The perebor may be repeated as many times as necessary, and is tolled as the body of the deceased is carried from the temple (church building) to the grave.

===Perezvon===
The ''Perezvon'' ({{lang-ru|[[:ru:Перезвон|Перезвон]]}}) is the striking of each of the bells, once or several times, from largest to the smallest, with a final stroke on all at once. The pattern may be repeated many times, but the final stroke on all bells is made only at the very end.

This peal symbolizes what the Orthodox Church holds to be the ''[[kenosis]]'' (self-emptying) of [[God the Son]] when he became [[incarnation (Christianity)|incarnate]] ({{bibleverse||Philippians|2:7-8|KJV}}), and is sounded only twice a year, on [[Great Friday]] and [[Great Saturday]] during those moments which recount Jesus' [[Death and Resurrection of Jesus|death on the cross]] and his [[Holy Sepulchre|burial]].

===Trezvon===
[[File:Fort Ross Festival 2018-6075.jpg|thumb|Victor Avdienko, Bell Ringer &amp; Percussionist, San Francisco Symphony, ringing bells in front of the orthodox chapel at the [[Fort Ross]] Festival 2018, Sonoma County, California]]
The ''Trezvon'' (triple-peal) is the rhythmical ringing of multiple bells, using all the major groups of the bell scale. The trezvon is the most joyous of the various types of rings.  The order of ringing the different bells is not fixed, but may be composed by the bell-ringer himself and prompted by his creativity and self-expression. For the trezvon, the elaborate pattern is repeated three times, with a short pause between each repetition. All three groups of bells participate in the trezvon (soprano, alto, bass), and each group has its own part in the peal. Traditionally, the [[meter (music)|meter]] for a trezvon is 3/4 or 4/4. The largest bell which can participate in it is the blagovestnik which was used to ring the blagovest for the given service, or a smaller bell, but not a larger one.

The trezvon is usually rung in three stages: the ''beginning'', the ''zvon'' itself, and the ''finale''. The beginning usually consists of three slow tolls on the blagovestnik for that day, symbolizing the [[Holy Trinity]]. The main part of the trezvon, the zvon, is often performed in several movements— one, two, or three, often called “verses”— each of which is finished with one, two, or three chords (formed by striking several select bells at once), corresponding to the number of verses.  Each movement might have its own particular rhythm, dynamic, and composition. The trezvon is usually finished with three chords. The length of the
trezvon is normally the length of the time it takes to read of Psalm 50; but on more festive occasions it should be longer.

The ''Dvuzvon'' (double-peal) is the same as a Trezvon, except the pattern is repeated only twice instead of three times.

==Occasions==
The above types of zvons may be combined and rung at particular times during the same service, or used exclusively on certain occasions. The following are general guidelines, and cannot accommodate the full richness and diversity of the Russian Orthodox Church. There are also variations in local tradition.

*All-Night Vigil
*Divine Liturgy
*Holy Week and Pascha
*Feast days
*Funerals

The '''sea surface microlayer''' (SML) is the top 1000 micrometers (or 1 millimeter) of the ocean surface.  It is the boundary layer where all exchange occurs between the [[atmosphere]] and the [[ocean]].&lt;ref name="liss"&gt;Liss, P.S., Duce, R.A., 1997. The Sea Surface and Global Change. Cambridge Univ. Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;  The chemical, physical, and biological properties of the SML differ greatly from the sub-surface water just a few centimeters beneath.&lt;ref name="zhang"&gt;Zhang, Zhengbin et al. (2003). Studies on the sea surface microlayer II. The layer of sudden change of physical and chemical properties. Journal of Colloid and Interface Science. 264, 148-159.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview of Properties ==
Organic compounds such as [[amino acids]], [[carbohydrates]], [[fatty acids]], and [[phenols]] are highly enriched in the SML interface.  Most of these come from [[biota (ecology)|biota]] in the sub-surface waters, which decay and become transported to the surface,&lt;ref name="aller"&gt;Aller, J., Kuznetsova, M., Jahns, C., Kemp, P.

Dissolved Organic Materials in Surface Microlayers: Temporal and Spatial Variability and Relation to Sea State. Limnology and Oceanography, 28.3. 415-431&lt;/ref&gt; though other sources exist also such as [[atmospheric deposition]], coastal [[Surface runoff|runoff]], and anthropogenic nutrification.&lt;ref name="liss"/&gt;  The relative concentration of these compounds is dependent on the nutrient sources as well as [[climate]] conditions such as [[wind speed]] and [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]].&lt;ref name="carlson-1983"/&gt; These [[organic compounds]] on the surface create a "film," referred to as a "slick" when visible,&lt;ref name="zhang"/&gt; which affects the physical and optical properties of the interface. These films occur because of the [[hydrophobic]] tendencies of many organic compounds, which causes them to protrude into the air-interface.&lt;ref name="liss"/&gt;&lt;ref name="carlson-1982"&gt;Carlson, David J. (1982). Surface microlayer phenolic enrichments indicate sea surface slicks. Nature. 296.1. 426-429.&lt;/ref&gt;  The existence of organic [[surfactants]] on the ocean surface impedes wave formation for low wind speeds.  For increasing concentrations of surfactant there is an increasing critical wind speed necessary to create ocean waves.&lt;ref name="liss"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zhang"/&gt;  Increased levels of organic compounds at the surface also hinders air-sea gas exchange at low wind speeds.&lt;ref name="woodcock"&gt;Woodcock, A. (1953). Salt nuclei in marine air as a function of altitude and wind force.

However, the major supplier of materials comes from the SML.&lt;ref name="aller"/&gt;

{{unreferenced|date=March 2010}}

In [[civil engineering]], '''serviceability''' refers to the conditions under which a building is still considered useful.  Should these [[Limit state design|limit states]] be exceeded, a structure that may still be structurally sound would nevertheless be considered unfit. It refers to conditions other than the building strength that render the buildings unusable. Serviceability limit state design of structures includes factors such as durability, overall stability, fire resistance, deflection, cracking and excessive vibration. 

For example, a [[skyscraper]] could sway severely and cause the occupants to be sick (much like [[sea-sickness]]), yet be perfectly sound structurally.  This building is in no danger of collapsing, yet since it is obviously no longer fit for human occupation, it is considered to have exceeded its [[serviceability limit]] state.

==Serviceability limit==
A serviceability limit defines the performance criterion for serviceability and corresponds to a conditions beyond which specified service requirements resulting from the planned use are no longer met. 
In [[limit state design]], a structure fails its serviceability if the criteria of the serviceability limit state are not met during the specified service life and with the required reliability. Hence, the serviceability limit state identifies a civil engineering structure which fails to meet technical requirements for use even though it may be strong enough to remain standing.
A structure that fails serviceability has exceeded a defined limit for one of the following properties:
* Excessive [[Deflection (engineering)|deflection]]
* Vibration
* Local deformation (engineering)
Serviceability limits are not typically defined by building code developer, government or regulatory agency. Building codes tend to be restricted to ultimate limits related to public and occupant safety. Global geopolitical variations are likely to exist.

[[File:Waveguide slotted line.jpg|thumb|'''Figure 1.''' Waveguide slotted line]]
'''Slotted lines''' are used for [[microwave]] measurements and consist of a movable probe inserted into a slot in a [[transmission line]].   They are used in conjunction with a microwave power source and usually, in keeping with their low-cost application, a low cost [[Schottky diode]] detector and [[VSWR meter]] rather than an expensive [[microwave power meter]].

Slotted lines can measure [[standing wave]]s, [[wavelength]], and, with some calculation or plotting on [[Smith chart]]s, a number of other parameters including [[reflection coefficient]] and [[electrical impedance]].  A precision variable [[Attenuator (electronics)|attenuator]] is often incorporated in the test setup to improve accuracy.  This is used to make level measurements, while the detector and VSWR meter are retained only to mark a reference point for the attenuator to be set to, thus eliminating entirely the detector and meter measurement errors.  The parameter most commonly measured by a slotted line is SWR. This serves as a measure of the accuracy of the impedance match to the item under test.  This is especially important for transmitting antennas and their feed lines; high [[standing wave ratio]] on a radio or TV antenna can distort the signal, increase transmission line loss and potentially damage components in the transmission path, possibly even the transmitter. 

Slotted lines are no longer widely used, but can still be found in budget applications.  Their main drawback is that they are labour-intensive to use and require calculation, tables, or plotting to make use of the results.  They need to be made with mechanical precision and the probe and its detector need to be adjusted with care, but they can give very accurate results.

==Description==
The slotted line is one of the basic instruments used in [[radio frequency]] test and measurement at [[microwave]] frequencies.  It consists of a precision [[transmission line]], usually [[co-axial cable|co-axial]] but [[waveguide]] implementations are also used, with a movable insulated [[Test probe#Near-field probe|probe]] inserted into a longitudinal slot cut into the line.  In a co-axial slotted line, the slot is cut into the outer conductor of the line.  The probe is inserted past the outer conductor, but not so far that it touches the inner conductor.  In a rectangular waveguide, the slot is usually cut along the centre of the broad wall of the waveguide.  Circular waveguide slotted lines are also possible.&lt;ref&gt;Multiple sources: {{ubl|style=margin-left:1em|Gupta, page 113| Voltmer, pages&amp;nbsp;146–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slotted lines are relatively cheap&lt;ref group=note&gt;[[Thomas H. Lee (engineering professor)|Thomas H. Lee]] even describes a [[microstrip]] slotted line for use up to {{nowrap|5 GHz}} that he claims can be made for less than $10.  He calls this a "{{nowrap|40 dB}} cost reduction" over the price of a network analyser.  That is, its cost is 10,000 times less than an analyser costing $100,000 (Lee, pages xv, 268-271).&lt;/ref&gt; and can perform many of the measurements done by more expensive equipment such as [[Network analyzer (electrical)|network analysers]].  However, slotted line measurement techniques are more labour-intensive and often do not directly output the desired parameter; some calculation or plotting is frequently required.  In particular, they can only carry out a measurement at one spot frequency at a time so producing a plot of a parameter versus [[frequency]] is very time consuming.  This is to be compared to modern instruments like network and [[Spectrum analyzer|spectrum analysers]] which are intrinsically [[Radio-frequency sweep|frequency swept]] and produce a plot instantly.  Slotted lines have now largely been superseded, but are still found where [[capital cost]]s are an issue.  Their remaining uses are mostly in the [[millimetre band]], where modern test apparatus is either prohibitively expensive or not available at all, and with academic laboratories and hobbyists.  They are also useful as a teaching aid as the user is more directly exposed to basic line phenomena than with more sophisticated instruments.&lt;ref&gt;Multiple sources: {{ubl|style=margin-left:1em|Das &amp; Das, page 496| Lee, pages 246, 251, 268| Voltmer, page 146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
The slotted line works by sampling the [[electric field]] inside the transmission line with the probe.  For accuracy, it is important that the probe disturbs the field as little as possible.  For this reason the probe diameter and slot width are kept small (usually around {{nowrap|1 mm}}) and the probe is inserted in no further than necessary.  It is also necessary in waveguide slotted lines to place the slot at a position where the current in the waveguide walls is parallel to the slot.  The current will then not be disturbed by the presence of the slot as long as it is not too wide.  For the [[waveguide dominant mode|dominant mode]] this is on the centre-line of the broad face of the waveguide, but for some [[transverse mode|other modes]] it may need to be off-centre.  This is not an issue for the co-axial line because this operates in the [[Transverse electromagnetic mode|TEM]] (transverse electromagnetic) mode and hence the current is everywhere parallel to the slot.  The slot may be tapered at its ends to avoid [[discontinuity (transmission lines)|discontinuities]] causing reflections.&lt;ref&gt;Multiple sources: {{ubl|style=margin-left:1em|Das &amp; Das, pages&amp;nbsp;497–498| Gupta, page 113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disturbance to the field inside the line caused by the insertion of the probe is minimised as far as possible.  There are two parts to this disturbance.  The first part is due to the power the probe has extracted from the line and manifests as a [[lumped element model|lumped equivalent circuit]] of a [[resistor]].  This is minimised by limiting the distance the probe is inserted into the line so that only enough power is extracted for the detector to operate effectively.  The second part of the disturbance is due to energy stored in the field around the probe and manifests as a lumped equivalent of a [[capacitor]].  This [[capacitance]] can be cancelled out with an [[inductance]] of equal and opposite [[electrical impedance|impedance]].  Lumped inductors are not practical at microwave frequencies; instead, an adjustable [[stub (electronics)|stub]] with an inductive equivalent circuit is used to "tune out" the probe capacitance.  The result is an equivalent circuit of a high impedance in [[Shunt (electrical)|shunt]] across the line which has little effect on the transmitted power in the line.  The probe is more sensitive as a result of this tuning and the distance it is inserted can be further limited as a result.&lt;ref&gt;Voltmer, page 148&lt;/ref&gt;

==Test setup==
[[File:Annotated slotted line test station.png|320 px|thumb|'''Figure 2.''' A test setup using a waveguide slotted line]]
[[File:Slotted line.png|thumb|'''Figure 3.''' Co-axial slotted line]]
A typical test setup with a waveguide slotted line is shown in figure 2.  Referring to this figure, power from a test equipment source (not shown)  enters the apparatus through the co-axial cable on the left and is converted to waveguide format by means of a [[co-ax to waveguide launcher|launcher]] (1).   This is followed by a section of waveguide (2) providing a transition to a smaller size of guide.  An important component in the setup is the [[Isolator (microwave)|isolator]] (3) which prevents power being reflected back into the source.  Depending on the test conditions, such [[Signal reflection|reflections]] can be large and a high-power source may be damaged by the returning wave.  The power entering the slotted line is controlled by a rotary variable [[Attenuator (electronics)|attenuator]] (4).  This is followed by the slotted line itself (5) above which is the probe mounted on a movable carriage.  The carriage also carries the probe adjustements: (6) is the probe depth adjustment, (7) is a length of co-axial section with tuning adjustments, and (8) is a ''detector'', which uses either a point contact ''crystal rectifier'' or a Schottky barrier diode.&lt;ref name="HC"&gt;H. C. Torrey, C. A. Whitmer, ''Crystal Rectifiers'', New York: McGraw-Hill, 1948&lt;/ref&gt; The right-hand end of the slotted line is terminated in a [[Impedance matching|matched load]] (9) which absorbs all the power exiting the end of the waveguide.  The load can be replaced by the component or system that it is desired to test.  It can also be replaced with a reference short-circuit (10) which is used to calibrate the slotted line.  The carriage can be moved along the slotted line by means of a rotary knob (11) which simultaneously moves a [[vernier gauge]] (12) for accurate measurement of the probes position along the line.&lt;ref&gt;Das &amp; Das, pages&amp;nbsp;496–498&lt;/ref&gt;

The probe is connected to a detector and a display meter (not shown in figure 2).  These can be, respectively, a [[thermistor]] and power meter, or an [[envelope detector]] and [[VSWR meter]].  The detector can be a crystal detector or a [[Schottky barrier diode]].  The detector is mounted on the probe assembly, usually a distance λ/4&lt;ref group=note&gt;'''λ''', the customary symbol for [[wavelength]].  It is usually most convenient to give distances on transmission lines in terms of wavelengths of the transmitted wave, or sometimes, when the distance involved is small or not an exact multiple of a quarter wavelength, in [[radian]]s where θ=2πλ radians.&lt;/ref&gt; from the probe tip as shown in figure 3.  This is because the detector looks almost like a short circuit to the transmission line, and this distance will convert it to an open circuit through the [[quarter-wave impedance transformer]] effect.  Thus, the detector has minimal effect on loading the line.  The probe tuning stub can be seen on figure 3 branching from the line linking the probe to the detector.  Figure 2 has a slightly different arrangement; the main probe into the waveguide leads to a vertical co-axial tuning and adjustment section but the detector is on a horizontal side-section with a secondary probe into the upright co-axial section.&lt;ref&gt;Das &amp; Das, pages&amp;nbsp;496–497&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurements==
Measurements of microwave power can be made directly, usually with a thermistor based detector and meter.  However, these instruments are expensive and a common meter used in measurements with a slotted line is instead a cheaper low-frequency VSWR meter.  The microwave power source is [[amplitude modulation|amplitude modulated]] with, typically, a {{nowrap|1 kHz}} signal which is recovered by the envelope detector in the probe and sent to the VSWR meter.  This scheme is preferred to simply detecting the unmodulated [[carrier signal|carrier]] directly, which would result in a [[direct current|DC]] output, because a stable, narrowband, [[tuned amplifier]] can be used to amplify the {{nowrap|1 kHz}} signal.  A large amplification is required in the VSWR meter because the limit of the square law range&lt;ref group=note&gt;'''square law''', of a detector diode, the range over which the demodulated output voltage is proportional to the square of the carrier voltage on the line.&lt;/ref&gt; of the detector diode is no more than {{nowrap|10 μW}}.&lt;ref&gt;Multiple sources: {{ubl|style=margin-left:1em|Das &amp; Das, page 496| Voltmer, page 147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maxima and minima===
[[File:Standing Wave Ratio.svg|thumb|'''Figure 4.'''  Standing wave patterns on a line for various reflection coefficients showing maxima and minima]]
When the slotted line is terminated with a precision matching load there is no variation in the detected power along the line, other than a very small decrease due to losses in the line.  However, when this is replaced by a [[device under test]] (DUT) which is not perfectly matched to the line there will be a [[Reflections of signals on conducting lines|reflection back towards the source]].  This causes a [[standing wave]] to be set up on the line with periodic [[maxima and minima]] (collectively, ''extrema'') due to alternating constructive and destructive [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]].  These extrema are found by moving the probe back and forth along the line and the level at that point can then be measured on the meter.&lt;ref&gt;Gupta, pages&amp;nbsp;113–114&lt;/ref&gt;

The extrema are not of any great interest in themselves, but are used in the calculation of several more useful parameters.  Some of these parameters require the measurement of the exact position of the extremum.  Either maxima or minima can equally be used, from a mathematical point of view, but minima are preferred because they are always much sharper than maxima, especially for large reflections, as shown in figure 4.  Additionally, the probe causes less disturbance to the field near a minimum than it does near a maximum.&lt;ref&gt;Voltmer, pages&amp;nbsp;147–148&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wavelength===
[[Wavelength]] is determined by measuring the distance between two adjacent minima.  This distance will be λ/2.  There is no need for a DUT, better results are obtained with the reference short in position.&lt;ref&gt;Multiple sources: {{ubl|style=margin-left:1em|Das &amp; Das, page 498| Voltmer, page 148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standing wave ratio===
[[Standing wave ratio]] (SWR or VSWR) is a basic parameter and the one most commonly measured on a slotted line.  This quantity is of particular importance for transmitter [[Antenna (radio)|antennae]].  A high SWR indicates a poor match between the feed line and the antenna, which increases wasted power, can cause damage to components in the transmission path, possibly including the transmitter, and cause distortion to TV, FM stereo and digital signals.  With the input power set so that the maxima are at 0 [[dBm]], a measurement of a minimum in decibels will directly give SWR (after discarding the minus sign).&lt;ref&gt;Gupta, pages&amp;nbsp;112–113&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reflection coefficient===
The [[reflection coefficient]], ρ, is the ratio of the reflected wave to the incident wave.  In general it is a [[complex number]].  The magnitude of the reflection coeffient can be calculated from the VSWR measurement by,

:&lt;math&gt; | \rho | = \frac{\mathrm{VSWR}-1}{\mathrm{VSWR}+1}&lt;/math&gt;

where VSWR is the standing wave ratio expressed as a voltage ratio (not in [[decibel]]s).  However, to completely characterise the reflection coefficient, the phase of ρ must also be found.  This is done on a slotted line by measuring the distance of the first minimum from the DUT.  Moving the probe right up to the DUT is not practicable so a different approach is usually adopted.  The position of the first minimum when the reference short is in place is noted.  The distance back along the line from this reference point to the next minimum when the DUT is in place will be the same as the distance from the DUT to the first minimum.  This is so because the reference short guarantees a minimum at the DUT position.&lt;ref&gt;Multiple sources: {{ubl|style=margin-left:1em|Gupta, pages&amp;nbsp;112–113| Lee, pages&amp;nbsp;248–249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Phase (waves)|phase]] part of ρ is given by,

:&lt;math&gt;\angle \rho = \frac{4\pi}{\lambda} x - \pi&lt;/math&gt;

where λ is the wavelength and ''x'' is the distance to the first minimum as described earlier.  The magnitude and phase representation of ρ can, if required, be expressed as real and imaginary parts instead by the usual manipulation of complex numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Multiple sources: {{ubl|style=margin-left:1em|Connor, pages&amp;nbsp;29–32| Das &amp; Das, page 498, 514-515| Lee, pages&amp;nbsp;248–249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impedance===
The impedance, ''Z'', of the DUT can be calculated from the reflection coefficient by,

:&lt;math&gt;Z = Z_0 \frac {1 + \rho}{1 - \rho}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the characteristic impedance of the line.  An alternative method is to plot the VSWR and distance to the node (in wavelengths) on a [[Smith chart]].  These quantities are directly measured by the slotted line.  From this plot the DUT impedance (normalised to ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) can be read directly off the Smith chart.&lt;ref&gt;Multiple sources: {{ubl|style=margin-left:1em|Connor, pages&amp;nbsp;34–38| Das &amp; Das, pages&amp;nbsp;514–515| Gupta, page 112, 114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accuracy considerations==

Good slotted lines are precision made instruments.  They need to be because mechanical defects can affect accuracy.  Some of the mechanical issues that are relevant to this include [[Backlash (engineering)|backlash]] of the vernier, concentricity of the inner and outer conductor, circularity of the outer conductor, centrality and straightness of the inner conductor, variations in cross-section, and the ability of the carriage to maintain a constant probe depth.  Issues with probe tuning and disturbances to the field have already been discussed, but the insulated spacers holding the centre conductor in place can also disturb the field.  Consequently, these are made as discrete as is compatible with mechanical strength.  However, the greatest source of inaccuracy is usually not the slotted line itself, but the characteristics of the detector diode.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, pages&amp;nbsp;251–252&lt;/ref&gt;

The detected voltage signal output of the Schottky barrier diodes typically used in microwave detectors have a square law relationship to the power being measured and meters are calibrated accordingly.  However, as the power increases, the diode deviates significantly from a square law and remains accurate up to an output voltage of only around {{nowrap|5-10 mV}}.  This can be improved a little by adding a load resistor to the detector output, but this also has the undesirable effect of decreasing sensitivity.  Another technique is to reduce the range of power being measured (so that it is brought within the square law range of the detector) by measuring at a point other than a maximum.  The maximum is then calculated from the known mathematical shape of the standing wave pattern.  This has the objection that it adds significantly to the labour required to make the measurements, as does the technique of precisely calibrating the detector and adjusting the readings on the meter according to a calibration chart.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, pages&amp;nbsp;252–254&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to completely eliminate errors in the detector and meter if a precision variable attenuator is used in the test setup.  In this technique a minimum is first found and the attenuator adjusted so that the meter is indicating precisely some convenient mark.  A maximum is then found and the attenuation increased until the meter is indicating the same mark.  The amount the attenuation had to be increased is the VSWR of the standing wave.  Accuracy here depends on the accuracy of the attenuator and not at all on the detector.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, page 253&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''stable ocean hypothesis''' (SOH) is one of several hypotheses within larval fish [[ecology]] that attempt to explain recruitment variability (Figure 1;&lt;ref name="northwestern1"&gt;Houde, E. 2008. Emerging from Hjort’s shadow. Journal of Northwestern Atlantic Fisheries Science 41:53-70.&lt;/ref&gt; Table 1). The SOH is the notion that favorable and somewhat stable physical and biological [[ocean]] conditions, such as the flow of [[current (ocean)|current]]s and [[food]] availability, are important to the survival of young fish larvae and their future recruitment. In the presence of stable ocean conditions, concentrations of [[prey]] form in stratified ocean layers; more specifically, stable ocean conditions refer to “calm periods in [[upwelling]] [[ecosystem]]s (sometimes called 'Lasker events')” that cause the [[water column]] to become vertically stratified.&lt;ref name="northwestern1"/&gt; The concept is that these strata concentrate both fish larvae and [[plankton]], which results an increase of the fish larvae feeding because of the density-dependent increase in [[predator-prey interaction]]s. [[Reuben Lasker|Lasker]] is attributed with constructing this hypothesis in the late 1970s &lt;ref name="recruitment80"&gt;Lasker, R. 1981.

==Case study evidence==
To support this hypothesis, Reuben Lasker cited the disconnect between spawning stock [[biomass]] and the recruitment of numerous fish species.&lt;ref name="hydrgraphische1997"&gt;Dippner, J. W. 1997. Recruitment success of different fish stocks in the North Sea in relation to climate variability. Deutsche Hydrgraphische Zeitschrift 49 (2-3): 277-293.&lt;/ref&gt; One explanation of this disconnect suggests larval recruitment is influenced by spatial and temporal patterns of their food, like [[phytoplankton]] or [[zooplankton]], which can be greatly affected by ocean currents and mixing.&lt;ref&gt;Haury, L. R., McGowan, J. A., and Wiebe, P. H. 1978. Patterns and processes in the time-space scales of plankton distribution. Spatial Pattern in Plankton Communities (ed. J. H. Steele), p. 277-327. Plenum, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; In his publication Marine fish larvae: Morphology, ecology, and relation to fisheries (1981), he points out, for example, the [[Peru]]vian [[anchovy]] fishery collapse that resulted from a dramatic decrease in population size during the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Valdivia, G., J. E. 1978. The anchoveta and El Niño. Rapp. P. –v. Réun. Cons. Int. Explor. Mer 173:196-202.&lt;/ref&gt;  Officials and researchers from the [[Peruvian government]] and [[United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization]] submitted that the causal factors were a combination of strong fishing pressure and weak year classes that resulted in insufficient reproduction and recruitment to support the [[fishery]].&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, G. T. (chairman). 1974. Report of the fourth session of the panel of experts on stock assessment on Peruvian anchoveta. Instituto del Mar del Peru (Callao), Boletin 2:605-719.&lt;/ref&gt; This explanation seemed to explain the diminished population trends of similar species from other regions, including the [[Pacific sardine|Pacific]] and Japanese [[sardine]]s and the Atlanto-Scandian [[herring]].&lt;ref name="recruitment80"/&gt;

Lasker, however, opposed this conclusion while citing the seemingly miraculous recovery of the troubled Japanese sardine population from scarcity (e.g. thousands of landed tons) to prominent abundance (e.g. more than a million landed tons).&lt;ref name="recruitment80"/&gt;  Another researcher studying the rebound of the Japanese sardine, Kondo (1980), identified an unusually strong 1972-year class, which produced successful recruitments in the years that followed. Kondo also noted altered ocean current patterns that increased zooplankton availability in spatiotemporal coincidence with the hatching of the sardine larvae.&lt;ref name="recruitment80"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fluctuations1980"&gt;Kondo, K. 1980. The recovery of the Japanese Sardine – the biological basis of stock-size fluctuations. Rapp. P.-v. Reun. Cons. Int. Explor. Mer. 177:322-354.&lt;/ref&gt; The result was increased larval survival and the eventual rebound of the population.&lt;ref name="recruitment80"/&gt; Thus, the observed trend is that strong year class anomalies can have major impacts on population sizes and their future stability and growth.&lt;ref name="hydrgraphische1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fluctuations1980"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hjort, J. 1926.

Du Cons., 1:5-38.&lt;/ref&gt; This concept also illustrates how plankton abundance and ocean currents can be driving factors associated with such trends.&lt;ref name="hydrgraphische1997"/&gt; Clearly, these patterns become important when considering the predictive models necessary to manage and sustain important fisheries and the stocks that support them.

==Experimental support==
Lasker also conducted studies using first-feeding anchovy larvae (during their critical period or the nutritional source transition from yolk sac to external food sources in very young larvae) to further test and eventually support his ideas.&lt;ref name="theilacker1970"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chlorophyll1975"/&gt;&lt;ref name="proportions329"/&gt; During one at-sea experiment, Lasker introduced water derived from various oceanic layers containing natural assortments of plankton as prey for the young anchovy larvae.

He observed that anchovy larvae would first feed only when introduced to layers from below the surface containing high levels of [[chlorophyll]] and certain species of phytoplankton.&lt;ref name="theilacker1970"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chlorophyll1975"/&gt;&lt;ref name="proportions329"/&gt;&lt;ref name="southward84"&gt;Blaxter, J. H. S. and A. J. Southward. 1992. Advances in Marine Biology, Vol. 28, p.84 -85. Academic Press Limited, San Diego.&lt;/ref&gt; These feeding-suitable phytoplankton assemblages were correlated with non-mixing [[thermocline]] layers. This conjecture was supported when foul weather swept up during the study and mixed the previously stratified layers (including a particulate layer below the surface) that had been sampled and introduced to the larvae. Samples derived from the same depths that proved ideal to induce first feeding prior to the storm no longer contained the necessary phytoplankton varieties and abundances; as a result, the young larvae did not feed on the post-storm samples and were unable to survive. Thus, Lasker eventually hypothesized that high-energy events that cause destratification of ocean layers have negative impacts on first-feeding northern anchovy larvae by destabilizing and decreasing their prey availability.&lt;ref name="recruitment80"/&gt;&lt;ref name="southward84"/&gt;

==Conditions and controversy==
In the book ''Advances in Marine Biology'', Heath (1992) astutely outlines some of the limitations and [[controversy]] associated with the SOH.&lt;ref&gt;Blaxter and Southward, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Three major limiting conditions include, but are not limited to:
# Species- and region-specific: SOH is based primarily on experimental studies of Pacific anchovy in the [[California Current|California current system]] (CCS) and should, therefore, be used cautiously when extrapolating to other species and regions.&lt;ref name="theilacker1970"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chlorophyll1975"/&gt;&lt;ref name="proportions329"/&gt;
# Life-stage specific: Lasker’s suggestion that storms ultimately have negative impacts on first-feeding anchovy larvae should come with the disclaimer that this applies only to first-feeding larvae entering the critical period. Older anchovy larvae can, in fact, be positively affected by storm activity, which often prompts increases in planktonic production.&lt;ref&gt;Mullin, M. M., E. R. Brooks, F. M. H. Reid, J. Napp, and E. F. Stewart. 1985. Vertical structure of nearshore plankton off southern California: a storm and a larval fish food web. Fish Bull. 83(2):151-170.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wroblewski, J. S., J. G. Richman, and G. L. Mellor. 1989. Optimal wind condition for the survival of larval northern anchovy, Engraulis mordax: a modeling investigation. Fish Bull., U.S. 87:387-395.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Does not consider storm-absent survival of larvae: Admittedly, one study supported the SOH by documenting a correlation between increased daily [[mortality rate]]s of first-feeding anchovy larvae and intervals of unperturbed, storm-absent conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Peterman, R. M. and M. J. Bradford. 1987. Wind speed and mortality rate of a marine fish, the northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax). Science 235:354-356.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet it is important to realize, as Peterman and Bradford did, that all this evidence does not affirm a certain relationship between larval survival and [[severe weather]]; this is particularly true given the lack of data regarding larval survival in the absence of storm events for context and comparison. Furthermore, Peterman and Bradford (1987) did not find a strong relationship between the larval survival rates documented adjacent to wind/storm events and recruitment levels observed months afterward.&lt;ref name="northwestern1"/&gt;

==Conclusions and modern perspective==
Lasker’s SOH and the many other explanations of recruitment in larval variability are certainly relevant. However, current consensus is that larval recruitment and survival are, to some extent, dependent upon all of these processes and more;&lt;ref name="northwestern1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cowan, J.

'''Structured English Immersion (SEI)''' is a technique for rapidly teaching English to [[English as a Foreign or Second Language|English Language Learners]].  The term was coined by Keith Baker and Adriana de Kanter in a 1983 recommendation to schools to make use of [[Official bilingualism in Canada|Canada's]] successful [[French immersion]] programs.&lt;ref name="Case for SEI"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian model was developed to encourage bilingualism through immersing Anglophones in the minority language and replaced [[language policies of the Canadian provinces and territories|many English-only laws in various Canadian provinces]] before the 1960s, while in the United States the same approach was advocated to force minority speakers to adopt English.

More recently, SEI has been defined as a methodology in which English language learners (ELLs) learn English through structured and sequential lessons. Specially developed for ELLs, these lessons are  based, to a large degree, on the mainstream curricula. (Haver, Johanna J., ''Structured English Immersion,'' Corwin Press, 2002)

In the 2009 U.S. Supreme Court decision, Horne v. Flores, the majority opinion stated, "Research on ELL instruction indicates there is documented, academic support for the view that SEI is significantly more effective than [[bilingual education]]. Findings of the Arizona State Department of Education in 2004 strongly support this conclusion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author      = SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  SEI is mandatory in California, Arizona and Massachusetts where voter initiatives opted to restrict the use of bilingual education in preference for SEI.

== SEI Framework ==
Only Arizona mandates that its public schools implement SEI models as follows:
* Significant amounts of the school day are dedicated to the explicit teaching of the English language, and students are grouped for this instruction according to their level of English proficiency.&lt;ref name="Case for SEI" /&gt;
* "The English language is the main content of SEI instruction. Academic content plays a supporting, but subordinate, role."&lt;ref name="Case for SEI" /&gt;
* "English is the language of instruction; students and teachers are expected to speak, read, and write in English."&lt;ref name="Case for SEI" /&gt;
* "Teachers use instructional methods that treat English as a foreign language."&lt;ref name="Case for SEI" /&gt;
* "Students learn discrete English grammar skills."&lt;ref name="Case for SEI" /&gt;
* "Rigorous time lines are established for students to exit from the program."&lt;ref name="Case for SEI" /&gt;
* SEI program graduates continue to receive support services until they are reclassified as "fluent English proficient" whereby Federal law then requires students be monitored for two years after reclassification.&lt;ref name="Case for SEI" /&gt;

Analysis of the surgical stress response can be used for evaluation of surgical techniques and comparisons of different anaesthetic protocols. Moreover, they can be performed both in the intraoperative or postoperative period. 
If there is a choice between different techniques for a surgical procedure, one method to evaluate and compare the surgical techniques is to subject one group of patients to one technique, and the other group of patients to another technique, after which the surgical stress responses triggered by the procedures are compared.

== Methods ==

Examples of used parameters are [[blood pressure]], [[heart rate]], [[heart rate variability]], [[photoplethysmography]] and [[skin conductance]]. Essentially, physiologic parameters are measured in order to assess sympathetic tone as a surrogate measure of stress. [[Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring]] can also be used.
Examples of commonly used biomarkers are [[adrenaline]], [[cortisol]], [[interleukin]]s, [[noradrenaline]] and [[vasopressin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Höglund|first1=OV|last2=Hagman|first2=R|last3=Olsson|first3=K|last4=Olsson|first4=U|last5=Lagerstedt|first5=AS|title=Intraoperative Changes in Blood Pressure, Heart Rate, Plasma Vasopressin, and Urinary Noradrenalin During Elective Ovariohysterectomy in Dogs: Repeatability at Removal of the 1st and 2nd Ovary.|journal=Veterinary surgery : VS|date=Aug 8, 2014|pmid=25130060|doi=10.1111/j.1532-950X.2014.12264.x|volume=43|pages=852–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Joris|first1=JL|last2=Chiche|first2=JD|last3=Canivet|first3=JL|last4=Jacquet|first4=NJ|last5=Legros|first5=JJ|last6=Lamy|first6=ML|title=Hemodynamic changes induced by laparoscopy and their endocrine correlates: effects of clonidine.|journal=Journal of the American College of Cardiology|date=November 1998|volume=32|issue=5|pages=1389–96|pmid=9809953|doi=10.1016/s0735-1097(98)00406-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Loss of nitrogen (urea) was observed already in the 1930s in fracture patients by the Scottish physician [[David Cuthbertson]]. The reason for the patients' catabolic response was not understood at the time, but later attention was turned to the stress reaction caused by the surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cuthbertson|first=DP|title=The disturbance of metabolism produced by bony and non-bony injury, with notes on certain abnormal conditions of bone.|journal=The Biochemical Journal|year=1930|volume=24|issue=4|pages=1244–63|pmid=16744448|pmc=1254622|doi=10.1042/bj0241244}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilmore|first=DW|title=From Cuthbertson to fast-track surgery: 70 years of progress in reducing stress in surgical patients.|journal=Annals of Surgery|date=Nov 2002|volume=236|issue=5|pages=643–8|pmid=12409671|doi=10.1097/00000658-200211000-00015|pmc=1422623}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The evolutionary background is believed to be that a wounded animal increases its chance of survival by using stored energy reserves. The stress reaction thus initiates a catabolic state by an increased release of catabolic hormones. Additionally immunosuppressive hormones are also released. 
In a surgery patient, the stress reaction is considered detrimental for wound healing. However, surgical stress reduced mortality from endotoxin shock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kamei|first1=K|last2=Nimura|first2=Y|last3=Nagino|first3=M|last4=Aono|first4=K|last5=Nakashima|first5=I|title=Surgical stress reduces mortality from endotoxin shock.|journal=Langenbeck's archives of surgery / Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Chirurgie|date=January 2002|volume=386|issue=7|pages=512–7|pmid=11819109|doi=10.1007/s00423-001-0261-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, development of new surgical techniques and anaesthetic protocols aim to minimise the surgical stress reaction.

'''Swarm behaviour''', or '''swarming''', is a [[Collective animal behaviour|collective behaviour]] exhibited by entities, particularly animals, of similar size which aggregate together, perhaps milling about the same spot or perhaps moving ''en masse'' or [[Animal migration|migrating]] in some direction. It is a highly interdisciplinary topic.&lt;ref name=Bouffanais&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bouffanais|first1=Roland|title=Design and Control of Swarm Dynamics|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-981-287-750-5|edition=First|url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9789812877505}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a term, ''swarming'' is applied particularly to insects, but can also be applied to any other entity or animal that exhibits swarm behaviour. The term ''[[flocking (behavior)|flocking]]'' or ''murmuration'' can refer specifically to swarm behaviour in birds, ''[[herd behaviour|herding]]'' to refer to swarm behaviour in [[tetrapods]], and [[shoaling and schooling|''shoaling'' or ''schooling'']] to refer to swarm behaviour in fish. [[Phytoplankton]] also gather in huge swarms called [[Algal bloom|''blooms'']], although these organisms are [[algae]] and are not self-propelled the way animals are. By extension, the term “swarm” is applied also to inanimate entities which exhibit parallel behaviours, as in a [[Swarm robotics|robot swarm]], an [[earthquake swarm]], or a swarm of stars.

From a more abstract point of view, swarm behaviour is the collective motion of a large number of [[Self-propelled particles|self-propelled entities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1 = O'Loan|author2 = Evans|doi = 10.1088/0305-4470/32/8/002|title = Alternating steady state in one-dimensional flocking|year = 1998|journal = Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and General|volume = 32|issue = 8|pages = L99–L105|arxiv = cond-mat/9811336|bibcode = 1999JPhA...32L..99O }}&lt;/ref&gt; From the perspective of the mathematical modeller, it is an [[emergence|emergent]] behaviour arising from simple rules that are followed by individuals and does not involve any central coordination. Swarm behaviour is also studied by [[active matter]] physicists as a phenomenon which is not in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]], and as such requires the development of tools beyond those available from the [[statistical physics]] of systems in thermodynamic equilibrium.

Swarm behaviour was first simulated on a computer in 1986 with the simulation program [[boids]].&lt;ref name="Reynolds"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Reynolds CW | year = 1987 | title = Flocks, herds and schools: A distributed behavioral model | citeseerx = 10.1.1.103.7187 | journal = Computer Graphics | volume = 21 | issue = 4| pages = 25–34 | doi = 10.1145/37401.37406 | isbn = 0-89791-227-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This program simulates simple [[Agent-based model in biology|agents]] (boids) that are allowed to move according to a set of basic rules. The model was originally designed to mimic the flocking behaviour of birds, but it can be applied also to schooling fish and other swarming entities.

In recent decades, scientists have turned to modeling swarm behaviour to gain a deeper understanding of the behaviour.

Early studies of swarm behaviour employed mathematical models to simulate and understand the behaviour. The simplest mathematical models of animal swarms generally represent individual animals as following three rules:
* Move in the same direction as their neighbours
* Remain close to their neighbours
* Avoid collisions with their neighbours

The [[boids]] computer program, created by [[Craig Reynolds (computer graphics)|Craig Reynolds]] in 1986, simulates swarm behaviour following the above rules.&lt;ref name="Reynolds" /&gt; Many subsequent and current models use variations on these rules, often implementing them by means of concentric "zones" around each animal. In the "zone of repulsion", very close to the animal, the focal animal will seek to distance itself from its neighbours to avoid collision. Slightly further away, in the "zone of alignment", the focal animal will seek to align its direction of motion with its neighbours. In the outermost "zone of attraction", which extends as far away from the focal animal as it is able to sense, the focal animal will seek to move towards a neighbour.

The shape of these zones will necessarily be affected by the sensory capabilities of a given animal. For example, the visual field of a bird does not extend behind its body. Fish rely on both vision and on [[hydrodynamic]] perceptions relayed through their [[lateral line]]s, while Antarctic [[krill]] rely both on vision and hydrodynamic signals relayed through [[antenna (biology)|antennae]].

However recent studies of starling flocks have shown that each bird modifies its position, relative to the six or seven animals directly surrounding it, no matter how close or how far away those animals are.&lt;ref name="Ballerini et al"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.0711437105 |vauthors=Ballerini M, Cabibbo N, Candelier R, Cavagna A, Cisbani E, Giardina I, Lecomte V, Orlandi A, Parisi G, Procaccini A, Viale M, Zdravkovic V |title= Interaction ruling animal collective behavior depends on topological rather than metric distance: Evidence from a field study |journal=Proc.

It remains to be seen whether this applies to other animals. Another recent study, based on an analysis of high-speed camera footage of flocks above Rome and assuming minimal behavioural rules, has convincingly simulated a number of aspects of flock behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hildenbrandt H, Carere C, Hemelrijk CK | year = 2010 | title = Self-organized aerial displays of thousands of starlings: a model | url = http://beheco.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/6/1349.full | journal = Behavioral Ecology | volume = 21 | issue = 6| pages = 1349–1359 | doi = 10.1093/beheco/arq149 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hemelrijk CK, Hildenbrandt H | year = 2011 | title = Some causes of the variable shape of flocks of birds | url = http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0022479 | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 6 | issue = 8| page = e22479 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0022479 | pmid=21829627 | pmc=3150374| bibcode=2011PLoSO...622479H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rug.nl/sciencelinx/exhibits/swarming/index|title=Zwermen en scholen - Swarming - Permanente expo - Bezoek onze expo's &amp; workshops! - Science LinX - Rijksuniversiteit Groningen|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rug.nl/fmns-research/beso/_people/hemelrijk|title=Onderzoek aan de Faculteit Wiskunde en Natuurwetenschappen - Faculteit Wiskunde en Natuurwetenschappen - Over ons - Rijksuniversiteit Groningen|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary models===
In order to gain insight into why animals evolve swarming behaviours, scientists have turned to evolutionary models that simulate populations of evolving animals. Typically these studies use a [[genetic algorithm]] to simulate [[evolution]] over many generations. These studies have investigated a number of hypotheses attempting to explain why animals evolve swarming behaviours, such as the [[selfish herd theory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Olson RS, Knoester DB, Adami C | year = 2013 | title = Critical Interplay Between Density-dependent Predation and Evolution of the Selfish Herd | url = http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2463372.2463394 | journal = Proceedings of GECCO 2013 | pages = 247–254 | doi = 10.1145/2463372.2463394 | isbn = 9781450319638 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ward CR, Gobet F, Kendall G | year = 2001 | title = Evolving collective behavior in an artificial ecology | url = http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=569757 | journal = Artificial Life | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 191–209 | doi = 10.1162/106454601753139005 | pmid=11580880}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Reluga TC, Viscido S | year = 2005 | title = Simulated evolution of selfish herd behavior | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519304005715 | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 234 | issue = 2 | pages = 213–225 | doi = 10.1016/j.jtbi.2004.11.035 | pmid=15757680}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wood AJ, Ackland GJ | year = 2007 | title = Evolving the selfish herd: emergence of distinct aggregating strategies in an individual-based model | url = http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/274/1618/1637 | journal = Proc Biol Sci | volume = 274 | issue = 1618 | pages = 1637–1642 | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2007.0306 | pmid=17472913 | pmc=2169279}}&lt;/ref&gt; the predator confusion effect,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Olson RS, Hintze A, Dyer FC, Knoester DB, Adami C | year = 2013 | title = Predator confusion is sufficient to evolve swarming behaviour | url = http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/10/85/20130305 | journal = J.

===Emergence===
{{Main|Emergence}}

The concept of emergence—that the properties and functions found at a hierarchical level are not present and are irrelevant at the lower levels–is often a basic principle behind [[Self-organization|self-organizing systems]].&lt;ref name="importance-ppt"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.authorstream.com/Presentation/wdorsey-88049-hierarchy-life-biology-education-ppt-powerpoint/ |accessdate=6 October 2009 |title=Hierarchy of Life |date=14 September 2008 |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of [[Biological organisation|self-organization in biology]] leading to emergence in the natural world occurs in ant colonies. The queen does not give direct orders and does not tell the ants what to do.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Instead, each ant reacts to stimuli in the form of chemical scents from larvae, other ants, intruders, food and buildup of waste, and leaves behind a chemical trail, which, in turn, provides a stimulus to other ants. Here each ant is an autonomous unit that reacts depending only on its local environment and the genetically encoded rules for its variety. Despite the lack of centralized decision making, ant colonies exhibit complex behaviours and have even been able to demonstrate the ability to solve geometric problems. For example, colonies routinely find the maximum distance from all colony entrances to dispose of dead bodies.

===Stigmergy===
{{Main|Stigmergy}}

A further key concept in the field of swarm intelligence is [[stigmergy]].&lt;ref name="Parunak2003"&gt;Parunak, H. v D. (2003). [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.116.1990&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf  "Making swarming happen"] In: Proceedings of Conference on Swarming and Network Enabled Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), McLean, Virginia, USA, 3 January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Marsh2007&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Marsh L. |author2=Onof C. | year = 2008 | title = Stigmergic epistemology, stigmergic cognition | url = http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/10004/1/3z2fx4r7prqwob3vfdq.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Cognitive Systems Research | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 136–149 | doi = 10.1016/j.cogsys.2007.06.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stigmergy is a mechanism of indirect coordination between agents or actions. The principle is that the trace left in the environment by an action stimulates the performance of a next action, by the same or a different agent. In that way, subsequent actions tend to reinforce and build on each other, leading to the spontaneous emergence of coherent, apparently systematic activity. Stigmergy is a form of self-organization. It produces complex, seemingly intelligent structures, without need for any planning, control, or even direct communication between the agents. As such it supports efficient collaboration between extremely simple agents, who lack any memory, intelligence or even awareness of each other.&lt;ref name=Marsh2007 /&gt;

===Swarm intelligence===
{{Main|Swarm intelligence}}

[[Swarm intelligence]] is the [[collective behaviour]] of [[decentralization|decentralized]], [[Self-organization|self-organized]] systems, natural or artificial. The concept is employed in work on [[artificial intelligence]]. The expression was introduced by [[Gerardo Beni]] and Jing Wang in 1989, in the context of [[Cellular automaton|cellular robotic]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;Beni, G., Wang, J. Swarm Intelligence in Cellular Robotic Systems, Proceed. NATO Advanced Workshop on Robots and Biological Systems, Tuscany, Italy, June 26–30 (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

Swarm intelligence systems are typically made up of a population of simple [[Agent-based model in biology|agents]] such as [[boids]] interacting locally with one another and with their environment. The agents follow very simple rules, and although there is no centralized control structure dictating how individual agents should behave, local, and to a certain degree random, interactions between such agents lead to the [[emergence]] of intelligent global behaviour, unknown to the individual agents.

Swarm intelligence research is multidisciplinary. It can be divided into natural swarm research studying biological systems and artificial swarm research studying human artefacts. There is also a scientific stream attempting to model the swarm systems themselves and understand their underlying mechanisms, and an engineering stream focused on applying the insights developed by the scientific stream to solve practical problems in other areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dorigo | first1 = M | last2 = Birattari | first2 = M | year = 2007 | title = Swarm intelligence | url = http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Swarm_intelligence | journal = Scholarpedia | volume = 2 | issue = 9| page = 1462 | doi = 10.4249/scholarpedia.1462 | bibcode = 2007SchpJ...2.1462D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Algorithms===
Swarm algorithms follow a Lagrangian approach or an [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Eulerian]] approach.&lt;ref name="Li et al"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Li YX, Lukeman R, Edelstein-Keshet L | display-authors = etal | year = 2007 | title = Minimal mechanisms for school formation in self-propelled particles | url = http://www.math.ubc.ca/~keshet/Papers/YXL_Lukeman_LEK.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena | volume = 237 | issue = 5| pages = 699–720 | doi = 10.1016/j.physd.2007.10.009 |bibcode = 2008PhyD..237..699L }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Eulerian approach views the swarm as a [[Field (physics)|field]], working with the density of the swarm and deriving mean field properties.

Simulations demonstrate that a suitable "nearest neighbour rule" eventually results in all the particles swarming together, or moving in the same direction.

[[Particle swarm optimization]] is another algorithm widely used to solve problems related to swarms. It was developed in 1995 by [[James Kennedy (social psychologist)|Kennedy]] and [[Russell C.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The algorithm was simplified and it was observed to be performing optimization. The system initially seeds a population with random solutions. It then searches in the [[Candidate solution|problem space]] through successive generations using [[stochastic optimization]] to find the best solutions. The solutions it finds are called [[Point particle|particles]]. Each particle stores its position as well as the best solution it has achieved so far. The particle swarm optimizer tracks the [[Maxima and minima|best local value]] obtained so far by any particle in the local neighbourhood. The remaining particles then move through the problem space following the lead of the optimum particles. At each time iteration, the particle swarm optimiser accelerates each particle toward its optimum locations according to simple [[mathematical formulae|mathematical rules]]. Particle swarm optimization has been applied in many areas. It has few parameters to adjust, and a version that works well for a specific applications can also work well with minor modifications across a range of related applications.&lt;ref&gt;Hu X [http://www.swarmintelligence.org/tutorials.php Particle swarm optimization: Tutorial].

====Altruism====
Researchers in Switzerland have developed an algorithm based on [[Hamilton's rule]] of kin selection. The algorithm shows how [[Altruism in animals|altruism]] in a [[swarm]] of entities can, over time, evolve and result in more effective swarm behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://genevalunch.com/blog/2011/05/04/altruism-helps-swarming-robots-fly-better-study-shows/ Altruism helps swarming robots fly better] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915092222/http://genevalunch.com/blog/2011/05/04/altruism-helps-swarming-robots-fly-better-study-shows/ |date=2012-09-15 }} ''genevalunch.com'', 4 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Waibel | first1 = M | last2 = Floreano | first2 = D | last3 = Keller | first3 = L | year = 2011 | title = A quantitative test of Hamilton's rule for the evolution of altruism | url = http://www.plosbiology.org/article/fetchObjectAttachment.action?uri=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1000615&amp;representation=PDF | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 9 | issue = 5| page = 1000615 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000615 | pmid=21559320 | pmc=3086867}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insects===
[[File:Mueckenschwarm 50p 1600kbit.ogv|thumb|right|Swarm of [[nematocera]], flying around a treetop]]

The behaviour of insects that live in [[Colony (biology)|colonies]], such as ants, bees, wasps and termites, has always been a source of fascination for children, naturalists and artists. Individual insects seem to do their own thing without any central control, yet the colony as a whole behaves in a highly coordinated manner.&lt;ref name=SwarmSmarts&gt;Bonabeau E and Theraulaz G (2008) "Swarm Smarts". In ''Your Future with Robots'' Scientific American Special Editions.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have found that cooperation at the colony level is largely [[Self-organization|self-organized]]. The group coordination that emerges is often just a consequence of the way individuals in the colony interact. These interactions can be remarkably simple, such as one ant merely following the trail left by another ant. Yet put together, the cumulative effect of such behaviours can solve highly complex problems, such as locating the shortest route in a network of possible paths to a food source. The organised behaviour that emerges in this way is sometimes called [[swarm intelligence]].&lt;ref name=SwarmSmarts /&gt;

====Ants====
[[File:Ants eating fruit.jpg|thumb|right|A swarm of [[ant]]s which have discovered a food source]]
{{See also|Ant colony|Ant colony optimization|Ant mill|Ant robotics|Artificial ants}}

Individual ants do not exhibit complex behaviours, yet a colony of ants collectively achieves complex tasks such as constructing nests, taking care of their young, building bridges and foraging for food. A colony of ants can collectively select (i.e. send most workers towards) the best, or closest, food source from several in the vicinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Czaczkes|first1=T.J.|last2=Grüter|first2=C.|last3=Ratnieks|first3=F. L. W.|title=Trail pheromones: an integrative view of their role in colony organisation|journal=Annual Review of Entomology|date=2015|volume=60|pages=581–599|doi=10.1146/annurev-ento-010814-020627|pmid=25386724}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such collective decisions are achieved using positive feedback mechanisms. Selection of the best food source is achieved by ants following two simple rules. First, ants which find food return to the nest depositing a [[pheromone]] chemical. More pheromone is laid for higher quality food sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beckers|first1=R.|last2=Deneubourg|first2=J. L.|last3=Goss|first3=S|title=Modulation of trail laying in the ant Lasius niger (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) and its role in the collective selection of a food source|journal=Journal of Insect Behavior|date=1993|volume=6|issue=6|pages=751–759|doi=10.1007/BF01201674}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, if two equidistant food sources of different qualities are found simultaneously, the pheromone trail to the better one will be stronger. Ants in the nest follow another simple rule, to favor stronger trails, on average. More ants then follow the stronger trail, so more ants arrive at the high quality food source, and a positive feedback cycle ensures, resulting in a collective decision for the best food source. If there are two paths from the ant nest to a food source, then the colony usually selects the shorter path. This is because the ants that first return to the nest from the food source are more likely to be those that took the shorter path. More ants then retrace the shorter path, reinforcing the pheromone trail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goss|first1=S.|last2=Aron|first2=S.|last3=Deneubourg|first3=J. L.|last4=Pasteels|first4=J. M.|title=Self-organized shortcuts in the Argentine ant|journal=Naturwissenschaften|date=1989|volume=76|issue=12|pages=579–581|doi=10.1007/BF00462870|bibcode=1989NW.....76..579G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The successful techniques used by [[ant]] colonies have been studied in computer science and robotics to produce distributed and fault-tolerant systems for solving problems. This area of [[biomimetics]] has led to studies of ant locomotion, search engines that make use of "foraging trails", fault-tolerant storage and networking algorithms.&lt;ref name="SANdisk"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dicke E, Byde A, Cliff D, Layzell P |year=2004 |chapter=An ant-inspired technique for storage area network design |title=Proceedings of Biologically Inspired Approaches to Advanced Information Technology: First International Workshop, BioADIT 2004 LNCS 3141 |pages=364–379 |editor1=A.

====Bees====
[[File:Bee swarm feb08.jpg|thumb|Bees swarming on a shrub]]
{{Main|Bees algorithm|Swarming (honey bee)}}

When a honey bee swarm emerges from a hive they do not fly far at first. They may gather in a tree or on a branch only a few meters from the hive. In this new location, the bees cluster about the queen and send 20 -50 scout bees out to find a suitable new nest locations.The scout bees are the most experienced foragers in the cluster. An individual scout returning to the cluster promotes a location she has found. She uses a dance similar to the [[waggle dance]] to indicate direction and distance to others in the cluster. The more excited she is about her findings the more excitedly she dances. If she can convince other scouts to check out the location she found, they may take off, check out the proposed site and promote the site further upon their return. Several different sites may be promoted by different scouts at first. After several hours and sometimes days, slowly a favourite location emerges from this decision making process. When all scouts agree on a final location the whole cluster takes off and flies to it. Sometimes, if no decision is reached, the swarm will separate, some bees going in one direction; others, going in another. This usually results in failure, with both groups dying. A swarm may fly for a kilometre or more to the scouted out location, though some species may establish new colonies within as little as 500 meters from the natal nest, such as ''[[Apis dorsata]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oldroyd|first1=BP|title=Colony relatedness in aggregations of ''Apis dorsata'' Fabricius (Hymenoptera, Apidae)|journal=Insectes Sociaux|date=1998|volume=47|pages=94–95|doi=10.1007/s000400050015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This collective decision making process is remarkably successful in identifying the most suitable new nest site and keeping the swarm intact. A good nest site has to be large enough to accommodate the swarm (about 15 litres in volume), has to be well protected from the elements, receive a certain amount of warmth from the sun, be some height above the ground, have a small entrance and resist the infestation of ants - hence why trees are often selected.&lt;ref&gt;Milius, Susan [http://www.sciencenews.org/view/feature/id/43117/title/Swarm_Savvy Swarm Savvy], How bees, ants and other animals avoid dumb collective decisions; Science News, May 9th, 2009; Vol.175 #10 (p. 16)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/10/081003081637.htm Bee Swarms Follow High-speed 'Streaker' Bees To Find A New Nest]; ScienceDaily (Nov. 24, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Seeley | first1 = Thomas D. | last2 = Visscher | first2 = P.

====Cockroaches====
Similar to ants, [[cockroach]]es leave chemical trails in their faeces as well as emitting airborne [[pheromones]] for swarming and mating. Other cockroaches will follow these trails to discover sources of food and water, and also discover where other cockroaches are hiding. Thus, cockroaches can exhibit [[Emergence#Emergent properties and processes|emergent behaviour]],&lt;ref name="viegas"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://animal.discovery.com/news/briefs/20060327/cockroach.html |title=Cockroaches Make Group Decisions |publisher=[[Discovery Channel]] |author=Jennifer Viegas |accessdate=10 June 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704111419/http://animal.discovery.com/news/briefs/20060327/cockroach.html |archivedate=4 July 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which group or swarm behaviour emerges from a simple set of individual interactions.

Cockroaches are mainly nocturnal and will run away when exposed to light. A study tested the hypothesis that cockroaches use just two pieces of information to decide where to go under those conditions: how dark it is and how many other cockroaches there are. The study conducted by José Halloy and colleagues at the [[Université Libre de Bruxelles|Free University of Brussels]] and other European institutions created a set of tiny [[robot]]s that appear to the roaches as other roaches and can thus alter the roaches' perception of [[critical mass (sociodynamics)|critical mass]]. The robots were also specially scented so that they would be accepted by the real roaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Locusts====
[[File:Schwarm Wanderheuschrecke.jpg|thumb|upright|A 19th century depiction of a swarm of [[desert locust]]s]]
{{see also|Marching locusts}}

''[[Locusts]]'' are the swarming phase of the short-horned [[grasshopper]]s of the family [[Acrididae]]. Some species can breed rapidly under suitable conditions and subsequently become gregarious and migratory. They form bands as [[nymph (biology)|nymphs]] and swarms as adults—both of which can travel great distances, rapidly stripping fields and greatly [[pest (organism)|damaging crops]]. The largest swarms can cover hundreds of square miles and contain billions of locusts. A locust can eat its own weight (about 2&amp;nbsp;grams) in plants every day. That means one million locusts can eat more than one ton of food each day, and the largest swarms can consume over 100,000 [[tonne]]s each day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/bugs/locust.html Locust ''Locustidae''] ''National Geographic''. Retrieved 12 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Swarming in locusts has been found to be associated with increased levels of [[serotonin]] which causes the locust to change colour, eat much more, become mutually attracted, and breed much more easily. Researchers propose that swarming behaviour is a response to overcrowding and studies have shown that increased tactile stimulation of the hind legs or, in some species, simply encountering other individuals causes an increase in levels of serotonin. The transformation of the locust to the swarming variety can be induced by several contacts per minute over a four-hour period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7858996.stm|title=Locust swarms 'high' on serotonin|date=29 January 2009|publisher=|via=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1242/jeb.00648 |vauthors=Rogers SM, Matheson T, Despland E, Dodgson T, Burrows M, Simpson SJ |date = November 2003|title=Mechanosensory-induced behavioural gregarization in the desert locust ''Schistocerca gregaria'' |journal=J.

An individual locust's response to a loss of alignment in the group appears to increase the randomness of its motion, until an aligned state is again achieved.

====Insect migration====
[[File:Monarch flock.jpg|thumb|Cluster of [[Monarch butterfly|monarch butterflies]]. Monarch butterflies migrate to [[Santa Cruz, California]] where they [[overwinter]]]]
{{Main|Insect migration}}
{{see also|Lepidoptera migration}}
[[Insect migration]] is the seasonal movement of [[insect]]s, particularly those by species of [[dragonflies]], [[beetle]]s, [[butterflies]] and [[moth]]s. The distance can vary from species to species, but in most cases these movements involve large numbers of individuals. In some cases the individuals that migrate in one direction may not return and the next generation may instead migrate in the opposite direction. This is a significant difference from [[bird migration]].

[[Monarch butterfly|Monarch butterflies]] are especially noted for their lengthy annual migration. In North America they make massive southward migrations starting in August until the first frost. A northward migration takes place in the spring. The monarch is the only butterfly that migrates both north and south as the birds do on a regular basis. But no single individual makes the entire round trip. Female monarchs deposit eggs for the next generation during these migrations.&lt;ref&gt;Pyle, Robert Michael, "National Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Butterflies", p712-713, Alfred A. Knopf, New York, {{ISBN|0-394-51914-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The length of these journeys exceeds the normal lifespan of most monarchs, which is less than two months for butterflies born in early summer. The last generation of the summer enters into a non-reproductive phase known as [[diapause]] and may live seven months or more.&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dbc.uci.edu/~pjbryant/biodiv/lepidopt/danaidae/monarchm.htm |title=Monarch, Danaus plexippus |accessdate=2008-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121215095741/http://www.dbc.uci.edu/~pjbryant/biodiv/lepidopt/danaidae/monarchm.htm |archivedate=2012-12-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  During diapause, butterflies fly to one of many overwintering sites. The generation that overwinters generally does not reproduce until it leaves the overwintering site sometime in February and March. It is the second, third and fourth generations that return to their northern locations in the United States and Canada in the spring.

====Bird migration====

Approximately 1800 of the world's 10,000 bird species are long-distance migrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sekercioglu, C.H.|year=2007|title=Conservation ecology: area trumps mobility in fragment bird extinctions|journal=Current Biology |volume=17|pages=R283–R286|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2007.02.019|pmid=17437705|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary motivation for migration appears to be food; for example, some hummingbirds choose not to migrate if fed through the winter. Also, the longer days of the northern summer provide extended time for [[breeding in the wild|breeding]] birds to feed their young. This helps [[Diurnality|diurnal]] birds to produce larger [[Clutch (eggs)|clutch]]es than related non-migratory species that remain in the tropics. As the days shorten in autumn, the birds return to warmer regions where the available food supply varies little with the season. These advantages offset the high stress, physical exertion costs, and other risks of the migration such as predation.

Many birds migrate in flocks. For larger birds, it is assumed that flying in flocks reduces energy costs. The V formation is often supposed to boost the efficiency and range of flying birds, particularly over long [[Bird migration|migratory]] routes. All the birds except the first fly in the [[upwash]] from one of the [[wingtip vortices]] of the bird ahead. The upwash assists each bird in supporting its own weight in flight, in the same way a [[Glider aircraft|glider]] can climb or maintain height indefinitely in rising air. Geese flying in a [[V formation]] save energy by flying in the updraft of the wingtip vortex generated by the previous animal in the formation. Thus, the birds flying behind do not need to work as hard to achieve lift. Studies show that birds in a V formation place themselves roughly at the optimum distance predicted by simple aerodynamic theory.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20090521201002/http://stinet.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA401264 Drag Reduction from Formation Flight.

Other animals may use similar drafting techniques when migrating. [[Lobster]]s, for example, migrate in close single-file formation "lobster trains", sometimes for hundreds of miles.

The Mediterranean and other seas present a major obstacle to soaring birds, which must cross at the narrowest points. Massive numbers of large [[Bird of prey|raptor]]s and storks pass through areas such as [[Gibraltar]], [[Falsterbo]], and the [[Bosphorus]] at migration times. More common species, such as the [[European honey buzzard]], can be counted in hundreds of thousands in autumn. Other barriers, such as mountain ranges, can also cause funnelling, particularly of large diurnal migrants. This is a notable factor in the [[Central America]]n migratory bottleneck. This concentration of birds during migration can put species at risk. Some spectacular migrants have already gone extinct, the most notable being the [[passenger pigeon]]. During migration the flocks were a mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) wide and 300 miles (500&amp;nbsp;km) long, taking several days to pass and containing up to a billion birds.

}}

The term "shoal" can be used to describe any group of fish, including mixed-species groups, while "school" is used for more closely knit groups of the same species swimming in a highly synchronised and polarised manner.

Fish derive many benefits from shoaling behaviour including defence against predators (through better predator detection and by diluting the chance of capture), enhanced [[foraging]] success, and higher success in finding a mate.&lt;ref name="Pitcher 1993"&gt;Pitcher TJ and Parish JK (1993) [https://books.google.com/books?id=10lElCT7v5wC&amp;pg=PA363&amp;dq=%22Behaviour+of+teleost+fishes%22+%22%22Functions+of+shoaling+behaviour+in+teleosts%22%22&amp;num=50&amp;ei=JzYKSpyWM42GkQSM992bBA "Functions of shoaling behaviour in teleosts"] In: Pitcher TJ (ed) ''Behaviour of teleost fishes''. Chapman and Hall, New York, pp 363–440&lt;/ref&gt; It is also likely that fish benefit from shoal membership through increased [[hydrodynamic]] efficiency.&lt;ref name="Hoare et al. 2000"&gt;Hoare DJ, Krause J, Peuhkuri N and Godin JGJ (2000) [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119004845/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 ''Body size and shoaling in fish''] Journal of Fish Biology, 57(6) 1351-1366.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fish use many traits to choose shoalmates. Generally they prefer larger shoals, shoalmates of their own species, shoalmates similar in size and appearance to themselves, healthy fish, and kin (when recognised). The "oddity effect" posits that any shoal member that stands out in appearance will be preferentially targeted by predators. This may explain why fish prefer to shoal with individuals that resemble them. The oddity effect would thus tend to homogenise shoals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Snekser JL, Ruhl N, Bauer K, McRobert SP | year = 2010 | title = The Influence of Sex and Phenotype on Shoaling Decisions in Zebrafish | url = http://comparativepsychology.org/2010ijcpissue1/05.Snekser_etal_Final.pdf | format = PDF | journal = International Journal of Comparative Psychology | volume = 23 | issue =  | pages = 70–81 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110725190329/http://comparativepsychology.org/2010ijcpissue1/05.Snekser_etal_Final.pdf | archivedate = 2011-07-25 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One puzzling aspect of shoal selection is how a fish can choose to join a shoal of animals similar to themselves, given that it cannot know its own appearance. Experiments with [[zebrafish]] have shown that shoal preference is a learned ability, not innate. A zebrafish tends to associate with shoals that resemble shoals in which it was reared, a form of [[imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Engeszer RE, Ryan MJ, Parichy DM | year = 2004 | title = Learned Social Preference in Zebrafish | url = http://www.sbs.utexas.edu/ryan/Publications/2004/2004CurrBiol14%20881.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Current Biology | volume = 14 | issue = 10| pages = 881–884 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2004.04.042 | pmid = 15186744 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other open questions of shoaling behaviour include identifying which individuals are responsible for the direction of shoal movement. In the case of [[fish migration|migratory]] movement, most members of a shoal seem to know where they are going. In the case of foraging behaviour, captive shoals of [[golden shiner]] (a kind of [[minnow]]) are led by a small number of experienced individuals who knew when and where food was available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1006/anbe.1999.1314 |author=Reebs, S.G. |title=Can a minority of informed leaders determine the foraging movements of a fish shoal? |journal=Animal Behaviour |volume=59 |issue=2 |pages=403–9 |year=2000 |pmid=10675263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radakov estimated herring schools in the North Atlantic can occupy up to 4.8 cubic kilometres with fish densities between 0.5 and 1.0 fish/cubic metre. That's several billion fish in one school.&lt;ref&gt;Radakov DV (1973) ''Schooling in the ecology of fish.'' Israel Program for Scientific Translation, translated by Mill H.

Between May and July huge numbers of [[sardine]]s spawn in the cool waters of the [[Agulhas Bank]] and then follow a current of cold water northward along the east coast of South Africa. This great migration, called the [[sardine run]], creates spectacular feeding frenzies along the coastline as marine predators, such as dolphins, sharks and gannets attack the schools.

Later work suggested that swimming activity in krill varied with stomach fullness. Satiated animals that had been feeding at the surface swim less actively and therefor sink below the mixed layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Current Biology |year=2006 |volume=16 |pmid=16461267 |issue=3 |pages=83–4 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2006.01.044 |title=Satiation gives krill that sinking feeling |author1=Geraint A. Tarling  |author2=Magnus L. Johnson |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; As they sink they produce faeces which may mean that they have an important role to play in the Antarctic carbon cycle. Krill with empty stomachs were found to swim more actively and thus head towards the surface. This implies that vertical migration may be a bi- or tri-daily occurrence. Some species form surface swarms during the day for feeding and reproductive purposes even though such behaviour is dangerous because it makes them extremely vulnerable to predators.&lt;ref name="howard"&gt;Howard, D.: "[http://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/c1198/chapters/133-140_Krill.pdf Krill]", pp.&amp;nbsp;133–140 in Karl, H.A. et al.

====Copepods====
[[File:Copepodkils.jpg|thumb|right|This copepod has its antenna spread (click to enlarge). The antenna detects the pressure wave of an approaching fish.]]
{{See also|Hunting copepods}}

[[Copepod]]s are a group of tiny [[crustacean]]s found in the sea and lakes. Many species are [[plankton]]ic (drifting in sea waters), and others are [[benthos|benthic]] (living on the ocean floor). Copepods are typically {{convert|1|to|2|mm|in|2}} long, with a teardrop shaped body and large [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]]. Although like other crustaceans they have an armoured [[exoskeleton]], they are so small that in most species this thin armour, and the entire body, is almost totally transparent. Copepods have a compound, median single eye, usually bright red, in the centre of the transparent head.

Copepods also swarm. For example, monospecific swarms have been observed regularly around [[coral reef]]s and [[sea grass]], and in lakes. Swarms densities were about one million copepods per cubic metre. Typical swarms were one or two metres in diameter, but some exceeded 30 cubic metres. Copepods need visual contact to keep together, and they disperse at night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hamner | first1 = WM | last2 = Carleton | first2 = JH | year = 1979 | title = Copepod swarms: Attributes and role in coral reef ecosystems | url = http://72.48.224.78/lo/toc/vol_24/issue_1/0001.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Limnol.

Spring produces [[Algal bloom|blooms]] of swarming [[phytoplankton]] which provide food for copepods. Planktonic copepods are usually the dominant members of the [[zooplankton]], and are in turn major food organisms for many other marine animals. In particular, copepods are prey to [[forage fish]] and [[jellyfish]], both of which can assemble in vast, million-strong swarms. Some copepods have extremely fast [[escape response]]s when a predator is sensed and can jump with high speed over a few millimetres (see animated image below).

&lt;gallery&gt;

File:Jelly cc4.jpg|Swarms of [[jellyfish]] also prey on copepods
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Planktonic copepods are important to the [[carbon cycle]]. Some scientists say they form the largest animal [[biomass]] on earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Johannes Dürbaum |author2=Thorsten Künnemann |lastauthoramp=yes |date=November 5, 1997 |title=Biology of Copepods: An Introduction |url=http://www.uni-oldenburg.de/zoomorphology/Biologyintro.html |publisher=[[Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg]] |accessdate=December 8, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526164720/http://www.uni-oldenburg.de/zoomorphology/Biologyintro.html |archivedate=May 26, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They compete for this title with [[Antarctic krill]]. Because of their smaller size and relatively faster growth rates, however, and because they are more evenly distributed throughout more of the world's oceans, copepods almost certainly contribute far more to the [[secondary productivity]] of the world's oceans, and to the global ocean [[carbon sink]] than [[krill]], and perhaps more than all other groups of organisms together. The surface layers of the oceans are currently believed to be the world's largest carbon sink, absorbing about 2 billion tons of carbon a year, the equivalent to perhaps a third of [[greenhouse gas|human carbon emissions]], thus reducing their impact. Many planktonic copepods feed near the surface at night, then sink into deeper water during the day to avoid visual predators. Their moulted exoskeletons, faecal pellets and respiration at depth all bring carbon to the deep sea.

====Algal blooms====
Many single-celled organisms called [[phytoplankton]] live in oceans and lakes. When certain conditions are present, such as high nutrient or light levels, these organisms reproduce explosively. The resulting dense swarm of phytoplankton is called an [[algal bloom]]. Blooms can cover hundreds of square kilometres and are easily seen in satellite images. Individual phytoplankton rarely live more than a few days, but blooms can last weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsey R and Scott M (2010) [http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/Phytoplankton/page1.php What are phytoplankton] [[NASA Earth Observatory]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NOAA_HAB&gt;[http://www.glerl.noaa.gov/res/Centers/HumanHealth/docs/habs.pdf Harmful algal blooms in the Great Lakes] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616173236/http://www.glerl.noaa.gov/res/Centers/HumanHealth/docs/habs.pdf |date=2010-06-16 }} 2009, [[NOAA]], Center of Excellence for Great Lakes and Human Health.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plants ===
Scientists have attributed swarm behavior to plants for hundreds of years. In his 1800 book, ''Phytologia: or, The philosophy of agriculture and gardening'', [[Erasmus Darwin]] wrote that plant growth resembled swarms observed elsewhere in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Phytologia.html?id=YggpAAAAYAAJ|title=Phytologia: Or, The Philosophy of Agriculture and Gardening. With the Theory of Draining Morasses and with an Improved Construction of the Drill Plough|last=Darwin|first=Erasmus|date=1800-01-01|publisher=P. Byrne|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While he was referring to more broad observations of plant morphology, and was focused on both root and shoot behavior, recent research has supported this claim.

Roots, in particular, display observable swarm behavior, growing in patterns that exceed the statistical threshold for random probability, and indicate the presence of communication between individual root apexes. The primary function of plant roots is the uptake of soil nutrients, and it is this purpose which drives swarm behavior. Plants growing in close proximity have adapted their growth to assure optimal nutrient availability. This is accomplished by growing in a direction that optimizes the distance between nearby roots, thereby increasing their chance of exploiting untapped nutrient reserves. The action of this behavior takes two forms: maximization of distance from, and repulsion by, neighboring root apexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ciszak|first=Marzena|last2=Comparini|first2=Diego|last3=Mazzolai|first3=Barbara|last4=Baluska|first4=Frantisek|last5=Arecchi|first5=F.

Plant responses are often complex, integrating multiple inputs to inform an autonomous response. Additional inputs that inform swarm growth includes light and gravity, both of which are also monitored in the transition zone of a root's apex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baluška|first=František|last2=Mancuso|first2=Stefano|last3=Volkmann|first3=Dieter|last4=Barlow|first4=Peter W.|date=2010-07-01|title=Root apex transition zone: a signalling–response nexus in the root|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1360138510000889|journal=Trends in Plant Science|volume=15|issue=7|pages=402–408|doi=10.1016/j.tplants.2010.04.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; These forces act to inform any number of growing "main" roots, which exhibit their own independent releases of inhibitory chemicals to establish appropriate spacing, thereby contributing to a swarm behavior pattern. Horizontal growth of roots, whether in response to high mineral content in soil or due to [[stolon]] growth, produces branched growth that establish to also form their own, independent root swarms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/961862730|title=Plant behaviour and intelligence|last=J.|first=Trewavas, A.|date=2014|publisher=Oxford university press|isbn=9780199539543|oclc=961862730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swarming is also used to describe groupings of some kinds of [[Bacteria#Predators|bacteria]] such as [[myxobacteria]]. Myxobacteria swarm together in "wolf packs", actively moving using a process known as [[bacterial gliding]] and keeping together with the help of intercellular molecular [[Signal transduction|signals]].&lt;ref name="Allison C, Hughes C 1991 403–422"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Reichenbach_2001&gt;{{cite journal |author=Reichenbach H |title=Myxobacteria, producers of novel bioactive substances |journal=J Ind Microbiol Biotechnol |year=2001 |pages=149–56 |volume=27 |issue=3 |pmid=11780785 |doi=10.1038/sj.jim.7000025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mathematical modelling of [[flocking behaviour]] is a common technology, and has found uses in animation. Flocking simulations have been used in many films&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gabbai |first=J.M.E. |title=Complexity and the Aerospace Industry: Understanding Emergence by Relating Structure to Performance using Multi-Agent Systems |year=2005 |publisher=University of Manchester Doctoral Thesis |place=Manchester |url=http://www.gabbai.com/academic/complexity-and-the-aerospace-industry-understanding-emergence-by-relating-structure-to-performance-using-multi-agent-systems/}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Crowd simulation|generate crowds]] which move realistically. Tim Burton's ''[[Batman Returns]]'' was the first movie to make use of swarm technology for rendering, realistically depicting the movements of a group of bats using the [[boids]] system. [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]] made use of similar technology, known as [[Massive (software)|massive]], during battle scenes. Swarm technology is particularly attractive because it is cheap, robust, and simple.

An ant-based computer simulation using only six interaction rules has also been used to evaluate aircraft boarding behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Livermore R (2008) [http://computing-reports.open.ac.uk/2008/TR2008-25.pdf "A multi-agent system approach to a simulation study comparing the performance of aircraft boarding using pre-assigned seating and free-for-all strategies"] ''Open University'', Technical report No 2008/25.&lt;/ref&gt; Airlines have also used ant-based routing in assigning aircraft arrivals to airport gates. An airline system developed by [[Douglas A. Lawson]] uses swarm theory, or [[swarm intelligence]]—the idea that a colony of ants works better than one alone. Each pilot acts like an ant searching for the best airport gate. "The pilot learns from his experience what's the best for him, and it turns out that that's the best solution for the airline," Lawson explains. As a result, the "colony" of pilots always go to gates they can arrive and depart quickly. The program can even alert a pilot of plane back-ups before they happen. "We can anticipate that it's going to happen, so we'll have a gate available," says Lawson.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/videos/2008/0406-planes_trains_and_ant_hills.htm "Planes, Trains and Ant Hills: Computer scientists simulate activity of ants to reduce airline delays"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124132227/https://www.sciencedaily.com/videos/2008/0406-planes_trains_and_ant_hills.htm |date=2010-11-24 }} ''Science Daily'', 1 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herd behaviour]] in [[marketing]] has been used to explain the dependencies of customers' mutual behaviour. ''[[The Economist]]'' reported a recent conference in [[Rome]] on the subject of the simulation of adaptive human behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Swarming the shelves: How shops can exploit people's herd mentality to increase sales? | publisher= The Economist | date= 2006-11-11 | page= 90}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shared mechanisms to increase impulse buying and get people "to buy more by playing on the herd instinct." The basic idea is that people will buy more of products that are seen to be popular, and several feedback mechanisms to get product popularity information to consumers are mentioned, including [[smart card]] technology and the use of [[RFID|Radio Frequency Identification Tag]] technology. A "swarm-moves" model was introduced by a [[Florida Institute of Technology]] researcher, which is appealing to supermarkets because it can "increase sales without the need to give people discounts."

{{main|Swarming (military)}}

[[Swarming (military)|Military swarming]] is a behaviour where autonomous or partially autonomous units of action attack an enemy from several different directions and then regroup. ''Pulsing'', where the units shift the point of attack, is also a part of military swarming. Military swarming involves the use of a decentralized force against an opponent, in a manner that emphasizes mobility, communication, unit autonomy and coordination or synchronization.&lt;ref name=Edwards-2000&gt;{{cite book
 | title=Swarming on the Battlefield: Past, Present, and Future

 | url=https://www.rand.org/pubs/monograph_reports/MR1100
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically military forces used principles of swarming without really examining them explicitly, but now active research consciously examines military doctrines that draw ideas from swarming.

Merely because multiple units converge on a target, they are not necessarily swarming. Siege operations do not involve swarming, because there is no manoeuvre; there is convergence but on the besieged fortification. Nor do [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla ambushes]] constitute swarms, because they are "hit-and-run". Even though the ambush may have several points of attack on the enemy, the guerillas withdraw when they either have inflicted adequate damage, or when they are endangered.

In 2014 the U. S. [[Office of Naval Research]] released a video showing tests of a swarm of small autonomous drone attack boats that can steer and take coordinated offensive action as a group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/06/tech/innovation/navy-swarm-boats/ U.S. Navy could 'swarm' foes with robot boats], ''CNN'', 13 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Myths==

* There is a popular myth that [[lemming]]s commit [[mass suicide]] by swarming off cliffs when they migrate. Driven by strong biological urges, some species of lemmings may migrate in large groups when population density becomes too great. Lemmings can swim and may choose to cross a body of water in search of a new habitat. In such cases, many may drown if the body of water is so wide as to stretch their physical capability to the limit. This fact combined with some unexplained fluctuations in the population of Norwegian lemmings gave rise to the myth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildlifenews.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=wildlife_news.view_article&amp;articles_id=56&amp;issue_id=6 |title=Lemming Suicide Myth Disney Film Faked Bogus Behavior |first=Riley |last=Woodford |publisher= |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103112042/http://www.wildlifenews.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=wildlife_news.view_article&amp;articles_id=56&amp;issue_id=6 |archivedate=January 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Piranha]] have a reputation as fearless fish that swarm in ferocious and predatory packs. However, recent research, which started "with the premise that they school as a means of cooperative hunting", discovered that they were in fact rather fearful fish, like other fish, who schooled for protection from their predators, such as cormorants, caimans and dolphins. A researcher described them as "basically like regular fish with large teeth".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/24/science/24obse.html?_r=1 Red-Bellied Piranha Is Really Yellow] ''New York Times'', 24 May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''swivel''' is a connection that allows the connected object, such as a [[swivel gun|gun]] or [[swivel chair|chair]], to [[rotate]] horizontally or vertically. A common design for a swivel is a [[cylindrical]] [[Rod (geometry)|rod]] that can turn freely within a support structure. The rod is usually prevented from slipping out by a [[nut (hardware)|nut]], [[washer (mechanical)|washer]] or thickening of the rod. The device can be attached to the ends of the rod or the center. Another common design is a [[sphere]] that is able to rotate within a support structure. The device is attached to the sphere. A third design is a hollow cylindrical rod that has a rod that is slightly smaller than its inside diameter inside of it. They are prevented from coming apart by [[flange]]s. The device may be attached to either end.

A swivel joint for a [[pipe (material)|pipe]] is often a [[screw thread|threaded]] connection in between which at least one of the pipes is curved, often at an angle of 45 or 90 degrees. The connection is tightened enough to be water- or air-tight and then tightened further so that it is in the correct position.

The '''thermomechanical cuttings cleaner (TCC)''' is a patented technology mainly used by service providers in the [[oil and gas industry]] to separate and recover the components of oil-contaminated drilling waste.&lt;ref name="Clean team"&gt;{{cite news|title=The clean team|url=http://www.europeanoilandgas.co.uk/article-page.php?contentid=18061&amp;issueid=501|accessdate=21 August 2013|newspaper=European Oil &amp; Gas|date=4 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A TCC converts [[kinetic energy]] to [[thermal energy]] in a thermal desorption process which efficiently transforms drilling waste into re-usable products.&lt;ref name=Mypaper&gt;{{cite news|title=Thermal separation technology|url=http://www.mypaper.se/show/text.asp?pid=345154162864355&amp;page=102|accessdate=21 August 2013|newspaper=Norway Exports - Oil &amp; Gas|page=100|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Using kinetic energy instead of indirect heating allows for very short retention times and as a consequence the quality of the separated components is not affected by the treatment. Thus the recovered water, base oil and solids can be re-used after the treatment process.&lt;ref name="Drilling Contractor"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mazerov|first=Katie|title=Bulk tanks, thermal systems advance environmental efficiency of cuttings handling|url=http://www.drillingcontractor.org/bulk-tanks-thermal-systems-advance-environmental-efficiency-of-cuttings-handling-11047|accessdate=21 August 2013|newspaper=Drilling Contractor|date=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development''' ('''UNCSD'''), also known as '''Rio 2012''', '''Rio+20''' ({{IPA-pt|ˈʁi.u ˈmajʒ ˈvĩtʃi}}), or '''Earth Summit 2012''' was the third international conference on [[sustainable development]] aimed at reconciling the economic and environmental goals of the global community. Hosted by Brazil in [[Rio de Janeiro]] from 13 to 22 June 2012,{{cn|date=June 2018}}{{dubious|Conflicting info about dates|date=June 2018}} Rio+20 was a 20-year follow-up to the 1992 [[Earth Summit|United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] (UNCED) held in the same city, and the 10th anniversary of the 2002 [[Earth Summit 2002|World Summit on Sustainable Development]] (WSSD) in [[Johannesburg]].

The ten-day mega-summit, which culminated in a three-day high-level UN conference, was organized by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs and included participation from 192 UN member states – including 57 Heads of State and 31 Heads of Government, private sector companies, NGOs and other groups. The decision to hold the conference was made by UN General Assembly Resolution A/RES/64/236 on 24 December 2009. It was intended to be a high-level conference, including heads of state and government or other representatives and resulting in a focused political document designed to shape global environmental policy.&lt;ref name="about.html"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncsd2012.org/about.html |title=Rio+20 – United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development |publisher=Uncsd2012.org |date=22 June 2012 |accessdate=4 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140818215812/http://www.uncsd2012.org/about.html |archivedate=18 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
In 1992, the first conference of its kind, the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), commonly referred to as the Rio Conference or Earth Summit, succeeded in raising public awareness of the need to integrate environment and development. The conference drew 109 heads of state to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to address what were dubbed urgent problems of environmental protection and socio-economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/earthsummit/ |title=United Nations Earth Summit+5 |publisher=United Nations |date=27 June 1997 |accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Earth Summit influenced subsequent UN conferences, including Rio+20 and set the global green agenda. "The World Conference on Human Rights, for example, focused on the right of people to a healthy environment and the right to development; controversial demands that had met with resistance from some Member States until the Earth Summit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/geninfo/bp/enviro.html/ |title=Earth_Summit |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major outcomes of the conference include the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) —a climate-change agreement that led to the [[Kyoto Protocol]], [[Agenda 21]], the [[United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD) and the [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification]] (UNCCD). It also created new international institutions, among them the Commission on Sustainable Development, tasked with the follow-up to the Rio Conference and led to the reform of the [[Global Environment Facility]].&lt;ref name="isfd.html"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncsd2012.org/isfd.html |title=Rio+20 – United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development |publisher=Uncsd2012.org |date=29 July 2011 |accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten years later, [[Earth Summit 2002]] informally nicknamed Rio+10 was held in Johannesburg, South Africa with the goal of again bringing together leaders from government, business and NGOs to agree on a range of measures toward similar goals. At Rio+10, [[sustainable development]] was recognized as an overarching goal for institutions at the national, regional and international levels. There, the need to enhance the integration of sustainable development in the activities of all relevant United Nations agencies, programs and funds was highlighted. The discussion also encompassed the role of institutions in stepping up efforts to bridge the gap between the international financial institutions and the multilateral development banks and the rest of the UN system.&lt;ref name="isfd.html"/&gt;

Major outcomes of that conference include the [[Johannesburg Declaration]] and almost 300 international partnership initiatives meant to help achieve the [[Millennium Development Goals]].

== Objectives ==
[[File:Rio+20 statue of liberty and Dilma Rousseff.JPG|thumb|Demonstration at Rio+20. Picture shows effigy of Brazilian President [[Dilma Rousseff]] with a chainsaw and embracing a replica of the Statue of Liberty.]]
[[File:Demonstration against Ahmadinejad in Rio.jpg|thumb|Demonstration against the President of Iran [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] during the conference.]]

The conference had three objectives:
# Securing renewed political commitment for sustainable development
# Assessing the progress and implementation gaps in meeting previous commitments.
# Addressing new and emerging challenges.

== Conference themes ==
The official discussions had two main themes:
# How to build a [[green economy]] to achieve sustainable development and lift people out of poverty, including support for developing countries that will allow them to find a green path for development.
# How to improve international coordination for sustainable development by building an institutional framework.

==Rio+20==

In the months leading up to the beginning of the conference, negotiators held frequent informal consultations at UN headquarters in New York City, and in the two weeks before the conference was scheduled to begin, they managed to reach consensus on the sensitive language in the then proposed outcome document for the summit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ictsd.org/i/news/bridgesweekly/136199/ |title=Agreement Reached on Weakened Outcome Text as Leaders Arrive for Rio Summit &amp;#124; International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development |publisher=Ictsd.org |date=31 July 2014 |accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Billed as the biggest UN event ever organized—with 15,000 soldiers and police guarding about 130 heads of state and government, from 192 countries, and the more than 45,000 individuals gathered in Rio de Janeiro—the 10-day mega-conference was intended to be a high-level international gathering organized to re-direct and renew global political commitment to the three dimensions of sustainable development: economic growth, social improvement and environmental protection; focusing on reducing poverty while promoting  jobs growth, clean energy and more fair, sustainable uses of resources; goals first established at Earth Summit in 1992.&lt;ref name="about.html"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncsd2012.org/rio20/newsletter.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=4 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825072833/http://www.uncsd2012.org/rio20/newsletter.html |archivedate=25 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environment.gov.au/rio/index.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724110850/http://www.environment.gov.au/rio/index.html |date=24 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conference centered around Agenda 21, the outcome document from Earth Summit 1992. That document was considered revolutionary in that it essentially created the term sustainable development and created the global environmental agenda for the next 20 years. The representatives of participating governments gathered in Rio to discuss what was then the draft text of the outcome document.

Rio+20 sought to secure affirmations for the political commitments made at past Earth Summits and set the global environmental agenda for the next 20 years by assessing progress towards the goals set forth in Agenda 21 and implementation gaps therein, and discussing new and emerging issues.
&lt;ref name="Gerhardt"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Gerhardt|first=Tina|date=20 June 2012|title=Rio+20 Kicks Off|url=http://www.progressive.org/rio_20_kicks_off.html|work=[[The Progressive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN wanted Rio to endorse a UN "green economy roadmap", with environmental goals, targets and deadlines, whereas developing countries preferred establishing new "sustainable development goals" to better protect the environment, guarantee food and power to the poorest, and alleviate poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jun/19/rio-20-earth-summit-1992-2012 | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=John | last=Vidal | title=Rio+20: Earth summit dawns with stormier clouds than in 1992 | date=19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rio+20 attracted many protests, and more than 500 parallel events, exhibitions, presentations, fairs and announcements as a wide range of diverse groups struggled to take advantage of the conference in order to gain international attention. The British online newspaper, The Guardian reported that, "Downtown Rio de Janeiro was partly shut-down as an estimated 50,000 protesters, some of whom were naked, took to the streets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2012/jun/21/rio20-summit-opens-protests-video | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Rio+20 summit opens amid protests – video | date=21 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Participation===

A few key global leaders—mostly G20 leaders and namely United States President Barack Obama, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and UK Prime Minister David Cameron—did not attend the conference and blamed their absence on the ongoing [[European sovereign-debt crisis]]. Their collective absence was seen as a reflection of their administrations' failure to prioritize sustainability issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jun/11/david-cameron-rio-earth-summit | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=John | last=Vidal | title=David Cameron criticised for skipping Rio+20 Earth summit | date=11 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"In not attending, the prime minister is sending out a powerful signal that the UK government does not see sustainability as a priority", Joan Walley, chair of the UK environmental audit committee said to The Guardian.

== Outcomes ==
The primary result of the conference was the nonbinding document, "The Future We Want," a 49-page work paper.&lt;ref name="Gerhardt"/&gt; In it, the heads of state of the 192 governments in attendance renewed their political commitment to sustainable development and declared their commitment to the promotion of a sustainable future. The document largely reaffirms previous action plans like Agenda 21.&lt;ref name="slideshare"&gt;{{cite web|author=uncsd2012 |url=http://www.slideshare.net/uncsd2012/the-future-we-want-rio20-outcome-document |title=The Future We Want Rio+20 Outcome Document |publisher=Slideshare.net |date=19 June 2012 |accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some important outcomes include the following:

“The text includes language supporting the development of [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs), a set of measurable targets aimed at promoting sustainable development globally. It is thought that the SDGs will pick up where the Millennium Development Goals leave off and address criticism that the original Goals fail to address the role of the environment in development."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ictsd.org/i/news/biores/136257/ |title=Agreement Reached on Weakened Outcome Text as Leaders Arrive for Rio Summit &amp;#124; International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development |publisher=Ictsd.org |date=15 July 2014 |accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attempt to shore up the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) in order to make it the "leading global environmental authority"&lt;ref name="slideshare"/&gt; by setting forth eight key recommendations including, strengthening its governance through universal membership, increasing its financial resources and strengthening its engagement in key UN coordination bodies.

Nations agreed to explore alternatives to GDP as a measure of wealth that take environmental and social factors into account in an effort to assess and pay for 'environmental services' provided by nature, such as carbon sequestration and habitat protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jun/23/rio-20-earth-summit-document | location=London | work=The Guardian | first1=Jonathan | last1=Watts | first2=Liz | last2=Ford | title=Rio+20 Earth Summit: campaigners decry final document | date=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recognition that "fundamental changes in the way societies consume and produce are indispensable for achieving global sustainable development." EU officials suggest it could lead to a shift of taxes so workers pay less and polluters and landfill operators pay more.

The document calls the need to return ocean stocks to sustainable levels "urgent" and calls on countries to develop and implement science-based management plans.&lt;ref name="slideshare"/&gt;

All nations reaffirmed commitments to phase out fossil fuel subsidies.

In addition to the outcome text, there were over 400 voluntary commitments for sustainable development made by Member States.

At the [[African Ministerial Conference on the Environment]], 40 African countries agreed to implement "The Future We Want."&lt;ref name="Africa"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=42897&amp;Cr=sustainable+development&amp;Cr1= | title=At UN-backed conference, African countries adopt sustainable development measures | publisher=UN News Centre | date=14 September 2012 | accessdate=16 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

===Environmental and Indigenous Rights Activists===

Activists took initiative at Rio+20 by staging numerous loud protests, and making their voices heard.  Numbered in the thousands, these activists joined forces to stand up to what they considered exploitation and degradation of the [[Earth]], as well as the negation of the rights of [[indigenous peoples]]. This group is ever more relevant in Brazil as [[deforestation]] threatens [[Amazon Basin|Amazonian]] ethnic groups everyday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wallace |first=Scott |title=Last of the Amazon|url=http://environment.nationalgeographic.com/environment/habitats/last-of-amazon/ |work=National Geographic |accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to holding signs and shouting chants, the crowds took a theatric route to convey their messages. Firstly, they poked at Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, claiming she has given in to the global North's corporate hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/22/megastars-of-the-earth-summit/|title=Stars of the Earth Summit|first=Taylor|last=Barnes|date=4 August 1692|website=Green Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rousseff's controversy has arisen over her steadfast desire to further industrialize Brazil, and its economy. Additionally, the crowds assembled for a ritual and symbolic "tearing up" of the plenary's negotiated text,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jonathan Watts, in Rio de Janeiro |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jun/21/rio-20-protesters-text-agreement |title=The Guardian June 21, 2012 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; conveying their disapproval.

Thousands of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) gathered at the Flamengo Park in Rio. They criticized the draft negotiating text, particularly for its failure to mention planetary boundaries or nuclear energy, in light of the Fukushima disaster in Japan.&lt;ref name="Gerhardt"/&gt; Organizations, such as [[Greenpeace]] and the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], as well as members of indigenous communities, activists and artists participated. The Danish artist [[Jens Galschiøt]], the leader of the group [[AIDOH]], and the [[Group 92]] used his [[Freedom to Pollute]] sculptures to focus on global warming and its resulting increased flow of refugees. About 20,000 flyers about [[Freedom to Pollute]] were distributed during [[Rio+20]] and a related television program was produced in Denmark.

===Ahmadinejad Visit to Rio===
There was some controversy over Iran's involvement in the Rio+20 conference. Iran sent a delegation, which included President [[Ahmadinejad]], to Rio in June to attend the summit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1477999-ahmadinejad-otra-vez-en-america-latina |title=Ahmadinejad, otra vez en América latina |publisher=Lanacion.com.ar |accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irandailybrief.com/2012/05/30/iranian-president-to-attend-rio20-conference/ |title=Iranian president to attend Rio+20 Conference " Iran Daily Brief |publisher=Irandailybrief.com |date=30 May 2012 |accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy of Iranian attendance at the summit surrounds the fact that Iran has serious environmental issues, which it has refused to address, continuing human rights violations and is refusing to cooperate with the [[IAEA]] over its contentious nuclear program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://g1.globo.com/globo-news/jornal-das-dez/videos/t/todos-os-videos/v/iraniano-acredita-que-ahmadinejad-vem-a-rio-20-para-mostrar-que-o-ira-tem-amigos/1971439/ |title=Iraniano acredita que Ahmadinejad vem à Rio +20 para mostrar que o Irã tem amigos – GloboNews – Vídeos do Jornal das Dez – Catálogo de Vídeos |publisher=G1.globo.com |date=30 May 2012 |accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahmadinejad was met with demonstrations, attended by thousands of people, on his arrival in Rio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/8136098@N05/7388334902/ |title=Activists walk through Rio, demonstrating against the presence of the Iranian delegation at the summit |publisher=Flickr.com |date=17 June 2012 |accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/8136098@N05/7388322554/ |title=Activists walk through Rio, demonstrating against the presence of the Iranian delegation at the summit |publisher=Flickr.com |date=17 June 2012 |accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Iranian delegation were met with protesters waving banners with the slogan "Ahmadinejad go home" on their arrival in Rio on 20 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rozen |first=Laura |url=http://backchannel.al-monitor.com/index.php/2012/06/blame-it-on-rio-israeli-delegate-says-irans-president-waved-at-them/ |title=Blame it on Rio? Israeli delegate says Iran's Ahmadinejad waved at them &amp;#124; The Back Channel |publisher=Backchannel.al-monitor.com |date=25 June 2012 |accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participation by Civil Societies==
[[File:Rio-hindi.PNG|thumb|RIO +20 Logo in Hindi created by CCLP Worldwide Team]]

During RIO +20 event and preparatory events UNCSD had given ample opportunities to various stakeholders to contribute towards Rio +20 and Civil Societies had taken part in various sphere including organizing side events, promoting the RIO event, submitting literature and also helped the rio secretariat with translation work.The logo and promotion of RIO +20 was available in languages used in United Nations however Civil societies took part in producing the logo image and literature in other local and National languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncsd2012.org/index.php?page=view&amp;nr=1070&amp;type=230&amp;menu=38 |title=Rio+20 : The Seventh issue of the magazine |publisher=Uncsd2012.org |date=11 April 2012 |accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==ProjectEarth Network==
Ecology and Environment Inc., a New York-based Environmental Engineering and Consultation company partnered with UNCSD to create Project Earth Network, an online platform where schools around the world could showcase their remarkable environmental projects. In coordination with the Rio+20 event, the platform hosted a World Environment Day Global School Contest in which 7th graders at the International School of Ulaanbaatar (ISU) in Mongolia were declared the Global Winners for their awareness campaign on the environmental impact of plastic shopping bags, including research on plastic bag manufacturing processes, development of videos documenting plastic bag waste, and a school presentation at which reusable cloth shopping bags were sold to approximately 50 percent of the community.

Sarasota, Fla.'s Brookside Middle School won in the World Environment Day contest's North American sub-category for its mangrove propagule growth project while International School of Brussels in Belgium won the European sub-category, for their creation of a sustainable food source and composting program. The Middle-Eastern sub-category winner was [[Hridith Sudev]], a seventh grader from [[Indian School Salalah]] in Oman for his organization, '[[Project GreenWorld International]]' which helped promote sustainable awareness across the region through interactive projects. Hridith Sudev later went on to become an inventor and the organization has become a global environmental presence. The World Environment Day contest followed an Earth Day "Green Schools" contest regionally focused toward 6th to 12th grade students in the Western New York area.

The idea behind the platform was to encourage sustainability in students across the world. Despite the huge response, the platform was taken down two years later due to technical and economic constraints but has since remained as a positive legacy through the activities of students who were first recognized by the network.

'''Vivian Morgan Carkeek''' (November 23, 1879 - December 29, 1934) was an [[United States|American]] attorney and businessman from [[Seattle, Washington]].

Born to Morgan and Emily Carkeek,&lt;ref&gt;Dorpat, Paul (August 19, 2005). "Celebrating in Style," Pacific NW Magazine, [http://www.seattletimes.com/pacific-nw-magazine/celebrating-in-style/ ''Seattle Times''] ("The Carkeeks were English immigrants, and their children, Guendolen and Vivian, kept the family's Anglo-Saxon flame lit. More than a student of the King Arthur legend, the lawyer Vivian Carkeek was a true believer, and for years the national president of the Knights of the Round Table. Guendolen was packed off to England as a teenager to go to school, although she wound up living in Paris and marrying a Russian count. Later, she returned to Seattle to help revive the historical society that her mother founded in 1911.")&lt;/ref&gt; one of the area's early pioneer families for whom [[Carkeek Park]] is named, Carkeek graduated from the [[University of Washington School of Law]]'s inaugural class in 1901 (a classmate of [[Walter B. Beals]] and [[Walter M. French]], who later married Vivian's cousin, Bessie Westlake Carkeek), and was a partner at the firm Carkeek, McDonald, Harris and Coryell.&lt;ref&gt;''American Legal News'' (1915), vol. 26, p. 38 (Washington news: "Announcement has been made of the dissolution of the law firm of Carkeek, McDonald &amp; Kapp, 1207 American Bank Building, Seattle, by the retirement of F.C.

Carkeek, like his mother and [[Guendolen Plestcheeff|sister]], was passionately interested in the history of the Seattle area, and he served briefly as president of the Seattle Historic Society, which his mother had founded in 1911, and was a founding officer of the Associates of Eighty-Nine, which was established in 1919 to perpetuate remembrance of the [[Great Seattle Fire]]. In the early 1930s he financed the acquisition of theater historian J. Willis Sayre's private collection of 12,500 theatrical programs for the [[Seattle Public Library]]. Carkeek also established the "Vivian Carkeek Prize" which is annually awarded "for the best student contribution to the ''Washington Law Review'' on a point of Washington law or any point of peculiar interest to Washington attorneys".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honors &amp; Awards|url=https://www.law.washington.edu/students/academics/honors.aspx|website=School of Law|publisher=[[University of Washington]]|accessdate=December 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="orbis"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Flom|first1=Eric|title=Silent Film Stars on the Stages of Seattle|date=2009|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0786439084|pages=11–12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FRUhxhNTZngC&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Associates of Eighty-Nine Will Celebrate June 6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HYpNAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=December 23, 2016|work=Business Chronicle of the Pacific Northwest|date=May 31, 1919}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Workplace communication''' is the process of exchanging information and ideas, both verbal and non-verbal, within an organization. An organization may consist of employees from different parts of the society. These may have different cultures and backgrounds, and can be used to different norms. To unite activities of all employees and restrain from any missed deadline or activity that could affect the company negatively, [[communication]] is crucial. Effective workplace communication ensures that all the organizational objectives are achieved. Workplace communication is tremendously important to organizations because it increases productivity and efficiency. Ineffective workplace communication leads to communication gaps between employees, which causes confusion, wastes time, and reduces productivity. Misunderstandings that cause friction between people can be avoided by effective workplace communication.Effective communication, also called open communication, prevents barriers from forming among individuals within companies that might impede progress in striving to reach a common goal. For businesses to function as desired, managers and lower-level employees must be able to interact clearly and effectively with each other through verbal communication and non-verbal communication to achieve specific business goals. Effective communication with clients plays a vital role in development of an organization and success of any business. When communicating, [[nonverbal communication]] must also be taken into consideration. How a person delivers a message has a lot of influence on the meaning of this one. 

Another important aspect to have effective workplace communication is taking into consideration the different backgrounds of employees. "While diversity enriches the environment, it can also cause communication barriers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Guo|first1=Kristina L.|last2=Sanchez|first2=Yesenia|last3=Borkowski|first3=Nancy|title=Organizational Behavior in Workplace|date=Dec 23, 2009|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt; Difficulties arise when a coworker’s cultural background leads him or her to think differently than another. It is for this reason that knowing about [[intercultural communication]] at work and learning how to treat others without offending them can bring several benefits to the company.

==Method of communication==

Different people absorb information in different ways. To make sure that the information conveyed is understood by all, the method used for communication must be simple, clear, and precise. When presenting vital information, using pictures will make way for easy understanding. The presence of trust inside a corporation will also simplify the use of communication. Relationships must be established between coworkers to create a tension-free workplace. Messages should be sent and received with no alterations. To achieve healthy relationships in the workplace, behaviors such as bullying, taking credit for someone else's work and [[Free rider problem|free riding]] should be avoided. These will create toxic relationships that will, in the long run, impact negatively a company and the productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DeIuliis|first1=David, PhD.|title="Workplace Communication"|journal=Communication Research Trends.|date=2016|volume=35|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preferring [[two-way communication]] is considered best for communicating. Adequate importance can be given for discussion, questions and clarifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Henson|first=Baden|title=Communication in the workplace|year=2007|publisher=Wiley|location=Milton, Old|ISBN=0-7314-0650-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==

The content of the information plays a major role in workplace communication. The level of detail must be according to the grasping capacity of the audience. Giving too much detail may get the audience bored and too little detail won’t make them involved. Use of [[jargon]] while communicating is not considered good for effective workplace communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sudden|first=Marsha|title=Effective workplace communication : skills for success in life and on the job|year=2007|publisher=JUST Works|location=Indianapolis, Ind.|ISBN=1-59357-433-9|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Frequency==

While formal workplace communication that is done too rarely or too often is not good for an organization, frequent informal workplace communication has its benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Whitaker|first=Steve |author2=David Frolic |author3=Owen Day-Jones|title=Informal workplace communication: what is it like and how might we support it?|journal=CHI '94 Proceedings of the SIGHS conference on Human factors in computing systems: celebrating interdependence|date=April 24–28, 1994|pages=131–137}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A perfect balance is required for the proper functioning of an organization. Information must be communicated as and when required rather than holding unnecessary meetings frequently. At the same time crucial information must not be held till the last hour or day, instead they must be communicated early to engage employees in the objectives of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Picardi|first=Richard P.|title=Skills of workplace communication : a handbook for T &amp; D specialists and their organizations|year=2001|publisher=Quorum Books|location=West port, Conn.|ISBN=978-1-56720-362-2|edition=[Online-Gauss.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skills==

Getting the message across efficiently depends on the skills of the communicator such as presentation skills, group facilitation skills, negotiation and written communication skills. Successful communication also depends upon the capacity of the employees to understand the information. This requires providing the employees some basic financial literacy like financial statements, sales, profitability, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Person|first=Sharon J. Person, Steven M.|title=Workplace communication : process and product|year=2007|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|ISBN=0-13-228808-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When selecting a candidate, most employers seek for those who have strong speaking and writing skills. Problem solving and self- motivation are also highly necessary skills among the workplace. These allow rapidly changing environments to become less of a challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stevens|first1=B|title=What communication skills do employers want? Silicon Valley Recruiters Respond|journal=Journal of employment counseling|date=March 2005|volume=42|issue=1|pages=2-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tools==

With the fast evolution of technology, companies have to stay up to date with communication tools that facilitate the workplace communication. Some of these include email, blogs, instant messaging and even social media sites such as [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]]. It is important to keep in mind that sending an email, a fax or a letter does not necessarily mean that communication has taken place. Only when a message has been sent, received and understood by the intended receiver, it can be said that communication has occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Guo|first1=Kristina L.|last2=Sanchez|first2=Yesenia|last3=Borkowski|first3=Nancy|title=Organizational Behavior in Workplace|date=Dec 23, 2009|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though they facilitate communication, studies have shown that communication tools may distract employees from their duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jackson|first1=T|last2=Dawson|first2=R|last3=Wilson|first3=D|title=Reducing the effect of email interruption on employees|journal=International Journal of Information Management|date=2003|volume=21|issue=1|page=55-65}}&lt;/ref&gt; To reduce the interrupt effect, methods such as employee training and changing of environment can be implemented. Employees making themselves unavailable during specific times of the day or week can also help resolve this issue. This will increase concentration and as a result, productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Conaill|first1=Brid|last2=Frohlich|first2=David|title=Timespace in the workplace: dealing with interruptions|journal=Conference Companion on Human Factors in Computing Systems|date=1995|volume=CHI 95|pages=262-263|doi=10.1145/223355.223665}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The solution to have effective communication in a workplace can be achieved by having a central portal where everybody can access all the relevant information, communications, documents, and contracts in one place. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ramadas|first1=Nidhin|title=Effective tools for workplace communication|url=https://axerosolutions.com/blogs/timeisenhauer/pulse/283/5-foolproof-business-communication-tools-every-company-should-be-using|website=axerosolutions|accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Barriers==

Common barriers to effective communication at workplace:

Physical barriers: Physical structure, location and construction of the workplace acts as a barrier to effective communication. Employees seated remotely from each other hinders effective interaction. 

Language barriers: Employees with different native languages will be working in an organization. As everyone in organization are not comfortable with native language of the other person, language acts as a barrier for effective workplace communication. 

Cultural barriers: Employees from different cultures, following different practices will be working in an organization. This cultural diversity among the employees can act as barrier for effective communication at workplace. 

Emotional barriers: Emotional barriers like fear, inferiority, shyness, lack of self confidence and skills will stop an employee in communicating effectively with his colleagues.

Perception barriers: Employees will have different experiences, values, preferences and attitudes.These may lead to a variety of assumptions and can act as a communication barrier.
