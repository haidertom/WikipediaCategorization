In [[chemistry]], '''antagonism''' is a phenomenon wherein two or more agents in combination have an overall effect that is less than the sum of their individual effects.

The word is most commonly used in this context in [[biochemistry]] and [[toxicology]]: interference in the physiological action of a chemical substance by another having a similar structure. For instance, a [[receptor antagonist]] is an agent that reduces the response that a [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]] produces when the receptor antagonist binds to a [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] on a [[cell (biology)|cell]]. An example of this is the [[interleukin-1]] receptor antagonist. The opposite of antagonism is [[synergy]]. It is a negative type of synergism.

Experiments with different combinations show that binary mixtures of [[natural phenol|phenol]]ics can lead to either a [[synergy|synergetic]] [[antioxidant effect of natural phenols|antioxidant effect]] or to an antagonistic effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11746-003-0812-z|title=Antioxidant activity of phenolic compounds in 2,2′-azobis (2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH)-induced oxidation: Synergistic and antagonistic effects|journal=Journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society|volume=80|issue=10|pages=1007|year=2003|last1=Peyrat-Maillard|first1=M.

'''Automatic gain control''' ('''AGC'''), also called '''automatic volume control''' ('''AVC'''), is a closed-loop [[feedback]] regulating circuit in an [[amplifier]] or chain of amplifiers, the purpose of which is to maintain a suitable signal amplitude at its output, despite variation of the signal amplitude at the input. The average or peak output signal level is used to dynamically adjust the [[gain (electronics)|gain]] of the amplifiers, enabling the circuit to work satisfactorily with a greater range of input signal levels. It is used in most [[radio receiver]]s to equalize the average  volume ([[loudness]]) of different radio stations due to differences in received [[signal strength]],   as well as variations in a single station's radio signal due to  [[fading]].  Without AGC the sound emitted from an [[amplitude modulation|AM]] [[radio]] receiver would vary to an extreme extent from a weak to a strong signal; the AGC effectively reduces the volume if the signal is strong and raises it when it is weaker.  In a typical receiver the AGC feedback control signal is usually taken from the [[detector (radio)|detector]] stage and applied to control the gain of the IF or RF amplifier stages.

==How it works==
The signal to be gain controlled (the detector output in a radio) goes to a [[diode]] &amp; [[capacitor]], which produce a peak-following DC voltage. This is fed to the RF gain blocks to alter their bias, thus altering their gain. Traditionally all the gain-controlled stages came before the signal detection, but it is also possible to improve gain control by adding a gain-controlled stage after signal detection.

== Example use cases ==

=== AM radio receivers ===
In 1925, [[Harold Alden Wheeler]] invented automatic volume control (AVC) and obtained a patent.  [[Karl Küpfmüller]] published an analysis of AGC systems in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;K. Küpfmüller, "Über die Dynamik der selbsttätigen Verstärkungsregler", ''Elektrische Nachrichtentechnik'', vol. 5, no. 11, pp. 459-467, 1928. (German) [http://ict.open.ac.uk/classics/2.pdf On the dynamics of automatic gain controllers], (English translation)&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1930s most new commercial broadcast receivers included automatic volume control.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10094&amp;page=281 Memorial Tributes: National Academy of Engineering, Volume 9] (2001) page 281, retrieved 2009 Oct 23&lt;/ref&gt;

AGC is a departure from linearity in AM radio [[receiver (radio)|receiver]]s.&lt;ref&gt;F. Langford-Smith (ed.), ''[[Radiotron Designer's Handbook]]'' 4th ed., RCA, 1953, chapter 27 section 3&lt;/ref&gt; Without AGC, an AM radio would have a linear relationship between the signal amplitude and the sound waveform – the sound [[amplitude]], which correlates with loudness, is proportional to the radio signal amplitude, because the information content of the signal is carried by the changes of amplitude of the [[carrier wave]]. If the circuit were not fairly linear, the modulated signal could not be recovered with reasonable [[fidelity]]. However, the strength of the signal received will vary widely, depending on the power and distance of the [[transmitter]], and signal path [[attenuation]]. The AGC circuit keeps the receiver's output level from fluctuating too much by detecting the overall strength of the signal and automatically adjusting the gain of the receiver to maintain the output level within an acceptable range. For a very weak signal, the AGC operates the receiver at maximum gain; as the signal increases, the AGC reduces the gain.

It is usually disadvantageous to reduce the gain of the [[RF front end]] of the receiver on weaker signals as low gain can worsen [[signal-to-noise ratio]] and [[blocking (radio)|blocking]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qsl.net/va3iul/Files/Automatic_Gain_Control.pdf Automatic gain control in receivers] by Iulian Rosu, VA3IUL&lt;/ref&gt; therefore, many designs reduce gain only for stronger signals.

Since the AM detector diode produces a DC voltage proportional to signal strength, this voltage can be fed back to earlier stages of the receiver to reduce gain. A filter network is required so that the audio components of the signal don't appreciably influence gain; this prevents "modulation rise" which increases the effective modulation depth of the signal, distorting the sound. [[Communications receiver]]s may have more complex AVC systems, including extra amplification stages, separate AGC detector diodes, different time constants for broadcast and shortwave bands, and application of different levels of AGC voltage to different stages of the receiver to prevent distortion and cross-modulation.&lt;ref&gt;Langford-Smith 53, page 1108&lt;/ref&gt; Design of the AVC system has a great effect on the usability of the receiver, tuning characteristics, audio fidelity, and behavior on overload and strong signals.&lt;ref&gt;Langford-Smith 53, chapter 25 page 1229&lt;/ref&gt;

FM receivers, even though they incorporate limiter stages and detectors that are relatively insensitive to amplitude variations, still benefit from AGC to prevent overload on strong signals.

=== Radar ===

A related application of AGC is in [[radar]] systems, as a method of overcoming unwanted [[clutter (radar)|clutter]] echoes. This method relies on the fact that clutter returns far outnumber echoes from targets of interest. The receiver's gain is automatically adjusted to maintain a constant level of overall visible clutter. While this does not help detect targets masked by stronger surrounding clutter, it does help to distinguish strong target sources. In the past, radar AGC was electronically controlled and affected the gain of the entire radar receiver. As radars evolved, AGC became computer-software controlled, and affected the gain with greater granularity, in specific detection cells.
Many [[Electronic warfare#Electronic attack .28EA.29|radar countermeasures]] use a radar's AGC to fool it, by effectively "drowning out" the real signal with the spoof, as the AGC will regard the weaker, true signal as clutter relative to the strong spoof.

=== Audio/video ===

An [[Magnetic tape sound recording|audio tape]] generates a certain amount of [[noise]]. If the level of the [[Signal (electronics)|signal]] on the tape is low, the noise is more prominent, i.e., the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] is lower than it could be. To produce the least noisy recording, the recording level should be set as high as possible without being so high as to [[clipping (audio)|clip]] or [[distortion|distort]] the signal. In professional [[high-fidelity]] recording the level is set manually using a [[peak-reading]] meter.  When high fidelity is not a requirement, a suitable recording level can be set by an AGC circuit which reduces the gain as the average signal level increases. This allows a usable recording to be made even for speech some distance from the [[microphone]] of an audio recorder. Similar considerations apply with [[VCRs]].

A potential disadvantage of AGC is that when recording something like music with quiet and loud passages such as classical music, the AGC will tend to make the quiet passages louder and the loud passages quieter, compressing the [[dynamic range]]; the result can be a reduced musical quality if the signal is not re-expanded when playing, as in a [[companding]] system.

Some [[reel-to-reel]] [[tape recorders]] and [[cassette deck]]s have AGC circuits. Those used for high-fidelity generally don't.

Most VCR circuits use the amplitude of the [[vertical blanking interval|vertical blanking pulse]] to operate the AGC. Video copy control schemes such as [[Macrovision]] exploit this, inserting spikes in the pulse which will be ignored by most [[television]] sets, but cause a VCR's AGC to overcorrect and corrupt the recording.

===Vogad===

A voice-operated gain-adjusting device&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037/dir-039/_5820.htm Vogad at Federal Standard 1037C]&lt;/ref&gt; or volume-operated gain-adjusting device&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
(vogad) is a type of AGC or [[Audio level compression|compressor]] for [[microphone]] amplification. It is usually used in radio transmitters to prevent [[overmodulation]] and to reduce the [[dynamic range]] of the signal which allows increasing average transmitted power. In [[telephony]], this device takes a wide variety of input amplitudes and produces a generally consistent output amplitude.

In its simplest form, a limiter can consist of a pair of back-to-back [[Clamper (electronics)|clamp diode]]s, which simply shunt excess signal amplitude to ground when the diode conduction threshold is exceeded. This approach will simply clip off the top of large signals, leading to high levels of distortion.

While clipping limiters are often used as a form of last-ditch protection against overmodulation, a properly designed vogad circuit actively controls the amount of gain to optimise the modulation depth in real time. As well as preventing overmodulation, it boosts the level of quiet signals so that undermodulation is also avoided. Undermodulation can lead to poor signal penetration in noisy conditions, consequently vogad is particularly important for voice applications such as [[radiotelephone]]s.

A good vogad circuit must have a very fast attack time, so that an initial loud voice signal does not cause a sudden burst of excessive modulation. In practice the attack time will be a few milliseconds, so a clipping limiter is still sometimes needed to catch the signal on these short peaks. A much longer decay time is usually employed, so that the gain does not get boosted too quickly during the normal pauses in natural speech. Too short a decay time leads to the phenomenon of "breathing" where the background noise level gets boosted at each gap in the speech. Vogad circuits are normally adjusted so that at low levels of input the signal is not fully boosted, but instead follow a linear boost curve. This works well with [[noise cancellation|noise cancelling]] microphones.

=== Telephone recording===
Devices to record both sides of a [[telephone]] conversation must record both the relatively large signal from the local user and the much smaller signal from the remote user at comparable loudnesses. Some telephone recording devices incorporate automatic gain control to produce acceptable-quality recordings.

=== Biological===

As is the case with many concepts found in engineering, automatic gain control is also found in biological systems, especially sensory systems.  For example, in the [[vertebrate]] [[visual system]], calcium dynamics in the [[retina]]l [[photoreceptor cell|photoreceptor]]s adjust gain to suit light levels.  Further on in the visual system, cells in V1 are thought to mutually inhibit, causing normalization of responses to contrast, a form of automatic gain control.  Similarly, in the [[auditory system]], the [[Olivocochlear system#Effects of electrical stimulation|olivocochlear efferent]] neurons are part of a biomechanical gain control loop.&lt;ref&gt;

== Recovery times ==

Similar to all automatic control system the time dynamics of AGC operation may be important in many applications. Some AGC systems are slow to react to the need for gain changes, others may react very rapidly. An example of an application where fast AGC recovery time is required is in receivers used in Morse code communications where so-called [[QSK operation (full break-in)|full break-in]] or QSK operation is necessary to enable receiving stations to interrupt sending stations mid-character (e.g. between dot and dash signals).

[[File:Pax cultura.svg|thumb|right|Banner of Peace sign]]

The '''banner of peace''' is a symbol of the [[Roerich Pact]]. This pact is the first international treaty dedicated to the protection of artistic and scientific institutions and historical monuments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uscbs.org/1935-roerich-pact.html Roerich Pact: Treaty on the Protection of Artistic and Scientific Institutions and Historic Monuments]&lt;/ref&gt; It was signed on April 15, 1935. The banner of peace was proposed by [[Nicholas Roerich]] for an international pact for the protection of culture values.

== Description ==
Roerich described the sign thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[the] proposed banner is the symbol of whole world, not a country, but the whole civilized world. The Banner proposed has on the white background three united amaranth spheres as a symbol of Eternity and Unity. Although we don't know when this Banner will fly over all cultural monuments but undoubtedly the seed has been sprouted. Already it attracts the attention of great intellects and is directed from one heart to another, awaking the idea of Peace and Benevolence among peoples."&lt;ref name="r2"&gt;"Banner of Peace." ''Collected articles''. Moscow: International Centre of the Roerichs, 1995. P. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We are asked to collect where the signs of our Banner of Peace are. The sign of trinity is found scattered around the whole world. Now anybody can explain it by various ways. One says that it is the past, present and future united by the circle of eternity. Others explain it as a religion, knowledge and art in the circle of culture."&lt;ref name="r2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

The following description of the sign appears in the official text of the pact:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/ART/325-480004?OpenDocument Treaty on the Protection of Artistic and Scientific Institutions and Historic Monuments (Roerich Pact). Washington, 15 April 1935. Art. 3]&lt;/ref&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"In order to identify the monuments and institutions mentioned in article I, use may be made of a distinctive flag (red circle with a triple red sphere in the circle on a white background) in accordance with the model attached to this treaty."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Origin ==
In the text of the pact, Roerich wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Banner of Peace, as is now well-known, is the symbol of the Roerich Pact. This great humanitarian ideal provides in the field of mankind's cultural achievements the same guardianship as the Red Cross provides in alleviating the physical sufferings of man."&lt;ref&gt;"Aims and History." ''The Roerich Pact and Banner of Peace''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The origin of Roerich's idea for the creation of the Banner of Peace sign was an ancient [[Russian icon]] by [[Andrei Rublev]]. Roerich wrote about this in his letter to Baron M.A. Taube: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"At last I can send you a home photo of my last picture dedicated to meaning sense of the banner sign. You can show this photo to some committee members and also to anybody whom, as you believe, it may be useful. Say to all ignoramuses which try to substitute their self-interested and ill-intentioned explanations of the sense of this picture. What may be more ancient and more genuine than Byzantine conception which stretches in the depth of centuries to the origin united Christianity and so beautifully implemented in Rublev's icon "Saint life-giving Trinity" from the Holy Trinity-St. Sergius Lavra? Just this symbol – the symbol of ancient Christianity, consecrated for us by name of St. Sergius, gives me a hint to our sign. Its sense is expressed on the proposed photo with conservation of all elements and their positions according to the Rublev's icon. Let this photo will be with You at Paris in the case of any new attempts to destroy already existing. In addition, I send You a photo of St. Queen of the Banner – Madonna Oriflamma." (Letter from N.K. Roerich to Baron M. Taube, 13.02.1932.)&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

N.K. Roerich has adduced the following illustrations of presence of the Banner of Peace components in the pictures and icons of great spiritual devotees from various religions:{{clarify|date=June 2013}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Our post from various countries today brings us much news about the propagation of our Pact for protection of cultural values. We have received a copy of an ancient icon of St Nicholas the Miracle-Worker &lt;…&gt;, which is confirmed to printing by metropolitan Antony. From other regions we have received a photo of an edition of Kiev-Pecherskaya Laura press from 1860 of the service to Venerable Sergius of Radonezh, the Miracle-Worker. From Spain we have received a picture of St. Domingo from "Silos" (archaeological museum, Madrid). Also from Spain we have received a picture of St. Michael made by Bartolommeo Vermekho (1440). At all these pictures the sign of Banner of Peace can be seen. It is useful to remember this for many."&lt;ref&gt;Roerich, N.K. Diary pages. V.1. "Half century."&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The sign of the banner was also found at the Temple of Heaven.  "Tamga" of Tamerlane consists of the same sign. The sign of Three Treasures is well known for many countries of the East. On the chest of Tibetan women one can see a large fibula which is the sign. The same fibulas we see also in Caucasian findings and in Scandinavia. Madonna of Strasbourg has the same sign as well as the Spanish Saints. The same sign is on the icons of St. Sergius and St. Nicholas Miracle-Worker. The sign as a large breast fibula is depicted on Christ's breast on the well-known H. Memling's picture. When we go over sacramental pictures of Byzantine, Roma, the same symbol ties the sacramental pictures on over the world."&lt;ref&gt;Roerich, N.K. Diary pages. V.1. "The signs."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Conditions of using the banner of peace sign ==
The monuments and institutions, on which the banner of peace sign is proposed to establish, must be included by National governments in the special list. 

'''ARTICLE IV'''

&lt;blockquote&gt;The signatory Governments and those which accede to this treaty, shall send to the Pan American Union, at the time of signature or accession, or at any time thereafter, a list of the monuments and institutions for which they desire the protection agreed to in this treaty. The Pan American Union, when notifying the Governments of signatures or accessions, shall also send the list of monuments and institutions mentioned in this article, and shall inform the other Governments of any changes in said list.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

'''ARTICLE V'''

&lt;blockquote&gt;The monuments and institutions mentioned in article I shall cease to enjoy the privileges recognized in the present treaty in case they are made use of for military purposes.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Roerich wrote about these conditions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Institutions, collections and missions, registered under [[Roerich Pact]], exhibit a distinctive flag which gives them the right to special protection and respect from belligerent countries and peoples of all countries participating in the treaty."&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

It is seen from above words that in order to get the right for exhibition of the distinctive banner one must be registered by Pact bodies. The same standing exists concerning a distinctive banner of [[Red Cross]] (which also created on the basis of ancient symbol – cross).

== Important cultural events with the Banner of Peace ==
In 1990, Russian cosmonauts [[Aleksandr Nikolayevich Balandin|Aleksandr Balandin]] and [[Anatoly Solovyev]] performed a space flight on orbital station [[Mir]] with the banner of peace on board. [[Mir EO-6|This flight]] lasted from February to August, including nine days with the banner outside the craft, completing 144 orbits of the Earth.&lt;ref name="r7"&gt;{{cite web| title= Banner of Peace hall |url= http://en.icr.su/museum/layout/banner/03.php |publisher= International Centre of the Roerichs |accessdate= 3 November 2017 |page= 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An international scientific "banner of peace" project was conducted in 1997, with the banner of peace again delivered into the orbiting Mir. The aim of this action was to call for protecting life and beauty on Earth. Many international crews worked in Mir with the banner aboard. Cosmonaut Paul Vinogradov, a participant of the project, said: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We have raised the banner of peace over the Earth in order that a space of culture excludes the space of war and animosity forever. We call all the peoples and nations to building of new spiritual, scientific and artistic cooperation."&lt;ref name="r7"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After completing the project and returning from orbit, the banner of peace was passed to the International Centre of the Roerichs. It is now exhibited there. 

On January 5, 1999, the banner of peace was presented to President [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] of [[Kazakhstan]]. Space pilot A.A. Leonov and professor S.P. Kapitsa participated in the ceremony, which was conducted in the Presidential Palace in [[Almaty]].&lt;ref&gt;"Museum named after N.K. Roerich." ''Museum guide''. Moscow: International Centre of the Roerichs, Master-Bank, 2006. P. 429.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Mountaineering|Mountaineers]] have lifted the banner of peace over many mountain peaks. Among these are the following:
: - [[Elbrus]];&lt;ref name="r9"&gt;Presentation of Banner of Peace to President of Kazakh Republic N.A.Nazarbayev. (shorthand record). / Journal “New Epoch. Problems. Searches. Studies” N 2(21), 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;
: - [[Belukha]], Roerich peak, Urusvati peak, Svetoslav Roerich peak (Altai);&lt;ref name="r9" /&gt;
: - [[Khan Tengri|Khan-Tengri]] (Middle Asia) ;
: - [[Everest]] ([[Himalayas]])

The banner of peace was first raised at the [[North Pole]] by the famous traveler [[Fyodor Konyukhov]] in 1988.  In 1999, participants of the first international complex Antarctic expedition "Towards to XXI" raised the banner of peace at the [[South Pole]]. The banners from these expeditions are now exhibited in the International Centre of the Roerichs.&lt;ref name="r7" /&gt;

In October, 2004 during the celebration of Roerich's 100th anniversary, the banner of peace which had been to the space station was presented to the Indian Parliament. Taking the banner, Speaker S. Chatterji said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"It will be kept in the library of Indian Parliament as most precious treasure."&lt;ref&gt;Martovitskaya, M. "Banner of Peace on the earth, in mountains and at the orbit". ''Culture'', No. 14, April 14–20, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24823">'''Biotic stress''' is [[stress (biological)|stress]] that occurs as a result of damage done to an organism by other living organisms, such as [[bacteria]], [[viruses]], [[fungi]], [[parasites]], beneficial and harmful insects, [[weed]]s, and cultivated or [[native plant]]s.{{sfn|Flynn|2003}} It is different from [[abiotic stress]], which is the negative impact of non-living factors on the organisms such as temperature, sunlight, wind, salinity, flooding and drought.{{sfn|Yadav|2012}} The types of biotic stresses imposed on an organism depend the climate where it lives as well as the species' ability to resist particular stresses. Biotic stress remains a broadly defined term and those who study it face many challenges, such as the greater difficulty in controlling biotic stresses in an experimental context compared to abiotic stress.

The damage caused by these various living and nonliving agents can appear very similar.{{sfn|Flynn|2003}} Even with close observation, accurate [[diagnosis]] can be difficult.{{sfn|Flynn|2003}} For example, [[brown]]ing of leaves on an [[oak tree]] caused by drought stress may appear similar to leaf browning caused by [[oak wilt]], a serious vascular disease caused by a fungus, or the browning caused by [[anthracnose]], a fairly minor leaf disease.

==Agriculture==
Abiotic stressors are a major focus of agricultural research, due to the vast economic losses caused to cash crops. The relationship between biotic stress and plant yield affects economic decisions as well as practical development. The impact of biotic injury on [[crop yield]] impacts [[population dynamics]], plant-stressor [[coevolution]], and ecosystem nutrient cycling.{{sfn|Peterson| Higley|2001}}

Biotic stress also impacts [[horticultural]] [[plant health]] and natural [[habitat]]s ecology. It also has dramatic changes in the host recipient. Plants are exposed to many stress factors, such as [[drought]], high [[soil salinity|salinity]] or pathogens, which reduce the [[crop yield|yield]] of the cultivated plants or affect the quality of the harvested products. Although there are many kinds of biotic stress, the majority of plant diseases are caused by fungi.{{sfn| Carris| Little| Stiles| 2012}} ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' is often used as a model plant to study the responses of plants to different sources of stress.{{sfn| Karim|2007}}

=== In history ===
Biotic stresses have had huge repercussions for humanity; an example of this is the [[potato blight]], an [[oomycete]] which caused widespread [[Great Famine (Ireland)|famine]] in England, Ireland and Belgium in the 1840s.{{sfn| Flexas|2012}} Another example is grape [[phylloxera]] coming from North America in the 19th century, which led to the [[Great French Wine Blight]].{{sfn| Flexas|2012}}

=== Today ===

Losses to pests and disease in crop plants continue to pose a significant threat to agriculture and [[food security]]. During the latter half of the 20th century, agriculture became increasingly reliant on synthetic chemical pesticides to provide control of pests and diseases, especially within the [[intensive farming]] systems common in the developed world. However, in the 21st century, this reliance on chemical control is becoming unsustainable. Pesticides tend to have a limited lifespan due to the emergence of resistance in the target pests, and are increasingly recognised in many cases to have [[biodiversity loss|negative impacts on biodiversity]], and on the health of agricultural workers and even consumers.{{sfn| Roberts| 2013}}

=== Tomorrow ===
Due to the implications of climate change, it is suspected that plants will have increased susceptibility to pathogens.{{sfn| Garrett| Dendy| Frank|Rouse|2006}} Additionally, elevated threat of abiotic stresses (i.e. drought and [[heat stress|heat]]) are likely to contribute to plant pathogen susceptibility.{{sfn| Garrett| Dendy| Frank|Rouse|2006}}

== Effect on plant growth ==

=== Photosynthesis ===

Many biotic stresses affect photosynthesis, as chewing insects reduce leaf area and virus infections reduce the rate of photosynthesis per leaf area. Vascular-wilt fungi compromise the water transport and photosynthesis by inducing stomatal closure.{{sfn| Flexas|2012}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Balachandran et al|first=|date=1997|title=Concepts of plant biotic stress. Some insights into the stress physiology of virus infected plants, from the perspective of photosynthesis|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1399-3054.1997.tb04776.x|journal=Physiologia Plantarum|volume=100|pages=203-213|via=|doi=10.1111/j.1399-3054.1997.tb04776.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Response to stress ==
Plants have co-evolved with their parasites for several hundred million years. This co-evolutionary process has resulted in the selection of a wide range of plant defences against microbial pathogens and herbivorous pests which act to minimise frequency and impact of attack. These defences include both physical and chemical adaptations, which may either be expressed constitutively, or in many cases, are activated only in response to attack. For example, utilization of high metal ion concentrations derived from the soil allow plants to reduce the harmful effects of biotic stressors (pathogens, herbivores etc.); meanwhile preventing the infliction of severe metal toxicity by way of safeguarding metal ion distribution throughout the plant with protective physiological pathways.{{sfn|Poschenrieder|2006}} Such induced resistance provides a mechanism whereby the costs of defence are avoided until defense is beneficial to the plant. At the same time, successful pests and pathogens have evolved mechanisms to overcome both constitutive and induced resistance in their particular host species. In order to fully understand and manipulate plant biotic stress resistance, we require a detailed knowledge of these interactions at a wide range of scales, from the molecular to the community level.{{sfn| Roberts| 2013}}

=== Inducible defense responses to insect herbivores. ===
In order for a plant to defend itself against biotic stress, it must be able to differentiate between an abiotic and biotic stress. A plants response to herbivores starts with the recognition of certain chemicals that are abundant in the saliva of the herbivores. These compounds that trigger a response in plants are known as elicitors or herbivore-associated molecular patterns (HAMPs).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Plant Physiology and Development|last=Taiz Lincoln, Zeiger Eduardo, Møller Ian Max, Murphy Angus|first=|publisher=Sinauer Associations, Inc|year=2015|isbn=9781605352558|location=USA|pages=706}}&lt;/ref&gt; These HAMPs trigger signalling pathways throughout the plant, initiating its defence mechanism and allowing the plant to minimise damage to other regions.These HAMPs trigger signalling pathways throughout the plant, initiating its defence mechanism and allowing the plant to minimise damage to other regions. Phloem feeders, like aphids, do not cause a great deal of mechanical damage to plants, but they are still regarded as pests and can seriously harm crop yields. Plants have developed a defence mechanism using salicylic acid pathway, which is also used in infection stress, when defending itself against phloem feeders. Plants perform a more direct attack on an insects digestive system. The plants do this using proteinase inhibitors. These proteinase inhibitors prevent protein digestion and once in the digestive system of an insect, they bind tightly and specifically to the active site of protein hydrolysing enzymes such as trypsin and chymotrypsin.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Plant Physiology and Development|last=Taiz Lincoln, Zeiger Eduardo, Møller Ian Max, Murphy Angus|first=|publisher=Sinauer Associations, Inc|year=2015|isbn=9781605352558|location=USA|pages=706}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mechanism is most likely to have evolved in plants when dealing with insect attack. 

Plants detect elicitors in the insects saliva. Once detected, a signal transduction network is activated. The presence of an elicitor causes an influx of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions to be released in to the cytosol. This increase in cytosolic concentration activates target proteins such as Calmodulin and other binding proteins. Downstream targets, such as phosphorylation and transcriptional activation of stimulus specific responses, are turned on by Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dependent protein kinases.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Plant Physiology and Development|last=Taiz Lincoln, Zeiger Eduardo, Møller Ian Max, Murphy Angus|first=|publisher=Sinauer Associations, Inc|year=2015|isbn=9781605352558|location=USA|pages=706}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Arabidopsis, over expression of the IQD1 calmodulin-binding transcriptional regulator leads to inhibitor of herbivore activity. The role of calcium ions in this signal transduction network is therefore important.

Calcium Ions also play a large role in activating a plants defensive response. When fatty acid amides are present in insect saliva, the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs)  are activated. These genes when activated, play a role in the jasmonic acid pathway.&lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Plant Physiology and Development|last=Taiz Lincoln, Zeiger Eduardo, Møller Ian Max, Murphy Angus|first=|publisher=Sinauer Associations, Inc|year=2015|isbn=9781605352558|location=USA|pages=706}}&lt;/ref&gt; The jasmonic acid pathway is also referred to as the Octadecanoid pathway.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octadecanoid_pathway|title=Octadecanoid pathway|last=|first=|date=|website=Wikipedia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=July 2018}} This pathway is vital for the activation of defence genes in plants. The production of jasmonic acid, a phytohormone, is a result of the pathway. In an experiment using virus-induced gene silencing of two calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) in a wild tobacco ( ''Nicotiana attenuata)'', it was discovered that the longer herbivory continued the higher the accumulation of jasmonic acid in wild-type plants and in silenced plants, the production of more defence metabolites was seen as well as the decrease in the growth rate of the herbivore used, the tobacco hornworm (''Manduca sexta).''&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt; This example demonstrates the importance of MAP kinases in plant defence regulation.

=== Inducible defense responses to pathogens ===
Plants are capable of detecting invaders through the recognition of non-self signals despite the lack of a [[circulatory]] or [[immune system]] like those found in animals. Often a plant's first line of defense against microbes occurs at the plant cell surface and involves the detection of microorganism-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs).&lt;ref name="Plant Defenses"&gt;[https://www.nature.com/articles/nri3141]&lt;/ref&gt; MAMPs include nucleic acids common to viruses and endotoxins on bacterial cell membranes which can be detected by specialized pattern-recognition receptors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2729760/pdf/nihms137527.pdf | pmc=2729760 | pmid=19423812 | doi=10.1126/science.1171647 | volume=324 | title=Innate immunity in plants: an arms race between pattern recognition receptors in plants and effectors in microbial pathogens | year=2009 | journal=Science | pages=742–4 | last1 = Boller | first1 = T | last2 = He | first2 = SY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another method of detection involves the use of plant immune receptors to detect effector molecules released into plant cells by pathogens. Detection of these signals in infected cells leads to an activation of [[effector-triggered immunity]] (ETI), a type of innate immune response.&lt;ref name="Comparing signaling mechanisms engaged in pattern-triggered and effector-triggered immunity"&gt;{{cite journal|url = https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136952661000049X?via%3Dihub | doi=10.1016/j.pbi.2010.04.006 | volume=13 | title=Comparing signaling mechanisms engaged in pattern-triggered and effector-triggered immunity | year=2010 | journal=Current Opinion in Plant Biology | pages=459–465 | last1 = Tsuda | first1 = Kenichi | last2 = Katagiri | first2 = Fumiaki}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the pattern recognition immunity (PTI) and effector-triggered immunity (ETI) result from the upregulation of multiple defense mechanisms including defensive chemical signaling compounds.&lt;ref name = "Comparing signaling mechanisms engaged in pattern-triggered and effector-triggered immunity"/&gt; An increase in the production of [[salicylic acid]] (SA) has been shown to be induced by pathogenic infection. The increase in SA results in the production of [[pathogenesis related]] (PR) genes which ultimately increase plant resistance to biotrophic and hemibiotrophic pathogens. Increases in [[jasmonic acid]] (JA) synthesis near the sites of pathogen infection have also been described.&lt;ref name="Role of plant hormones in plant defence responses"&gt;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11103-008-9435-0]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Role of Salicylic Acid and Jasmonic Acid in Pathogen Defence"&gt;[https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.1055/s-2006-924025]&lt;/ref&gt; This physiological response to increase JA production has been implicated in the [[ubiquitination]] of jasmonate ZIM domains (JAZ) proteins, which inhibit JA signaling, leading to their degradation and a subsequent increase in JA activated defense genes.&lt;ref name = "Role of plant hormones in plant defence responses"/&gt;

Studies regarding the upregulation of defensive chemicals have confirmed the role of SA and JA in pathogen defense. In studies utilizing ''[[Arabidopsis]]'' mutants with the bacterial ''NahG'' gene, which inhibits the production and accumulation of SA, were shown to be more susceptible to pathogens than the wild-type plants. This was thought to result from the inability to produce critical defensive mechanisms including increased PR gene expression.&lt;ref name = "The Role of Salicylic Acid and Jasmonic Acid in Pathogen Defence"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Salicylic Acid, a Multifaceted Hormone to Combat Disease"&gt;[https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.phyto.050908.135202?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed]&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies conducted by injecting tobacco plants and ''Arabidopsis'' with salicylic acid resulted in higher resistance of infection by the alfalfa and tobacco mosaic viruses, indicating a role for SA biosynthesis in reducing viral replication.&lt;ref name = "Salicylic Acid, a Multifaceted Hormone to Combat Disease"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microbiologyresearch.org/docserver/fulltext/jgv/67/10/JV0670102135.pdf?expires=1525640302&amp;id=id&amp;accname=guest&amp;checksum=643BFB19B19A6F97871E7FE103FAB68E]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, studies performed using ''Arabidopsis'' with mutated jasmonic acid biosynthesis pathways have shown JA mutants to be at an increased risk of infection by soil pathogens.&lt;ref name = "The Role of Salicylic Acid and Jasmonic Acid in Pathogen Defence"/&gt;

Along with SA and JA, other defensive chemicals have been implicated in plant viral pathogen defenses including [[abscisic acid]] (ABA), [[gibberellic acid]] (GA), [[auxin]], and [[peptide hormone]]s.&lt;ref name = "Role of plant hormones in plant defence responses"/&gt; The use of hormones and innate immunity presents parallels between animal and plant defenses, though pattern-triggered immunity is thought to have arisen independently in each.&lt;ref name = "Plant Defenses"/&gt;

=== Cross tolerance with abiotic stress ===

* Evidence shows that a plant undergoing multiple stresses, both abiotic and biotic (usually pathogen or herbivore attack), can produce a positive effect on plant performance, by reducing their susceptibility to biotic stress compared to how they respond to individual stresses. The interaction leads to a crosstalk between their respective hormone signalling pathways which will either induce or antagonize another restructuring genes machinery to increase tolerance of defense reactions.{{sfn| Rejeb| Pastor| Mauch-Mani|2014}}
* [[Reactive oxygen species]] (ROS) are key signalling molecules produced in response to biotic and abiotic stress cross tolerance. ROS are produced in response to biotic stresses during the oxidative burst.{{sfn|Perez| Brown| 2014}}
* Dual stress imposed by ozone (O3) and pathogen affects tolerance of crop and leads to altered host pathogen interaction (Fuhrer, 2003). Alteration in pathogenesis potential of pest due to O3 exposure is of ecological and economical importance.{{sfn|Raju| Gossel| Ramanathan| Sudhakar |2015}}
* Tolerance to both biotic and abiotic stresses has been achieved. In maize, breeding programmes have led to plants which are tolerant to drought and have additional resistance to the parasitic weed ''[[Striga hermonthica]]''.{{sfn|Atkinson| Urwin| 2012}}{{sfn|Fuller| Lilley| Urwin|2008}}

== Remote sensing ==
The [[Agricultural Research Service]] (ARS) and various government agencies and private institutions have provided a great deal of fundamental information relating spectral reflectance and thermal emittance properties of soils and crops to their agronomic and biophysical characteristics. This knowledge has facilitated the development and use of various remote sensing methods for non-destructive monitoring of plant growth and development and for the detection of many environmental stresses that limit plant productivity. Coupled with rapid advances in computing and position locating technologies, remote sensing from ground-, air-, and space-based platforms is now capable of providing detailed spatial and temporal information on plant response to their local environment that is needed for site specific agricultural management approaches.{{sfn|Pinter| Hatfield| Schepers| Barnes|2003}} This is very important in today's society because with increasing pressure on global food productivity due to population increase, result in a demand for stress-tolerant crop varieties that has never been greater.

'''Carbon Process Management (CPM)''' is a management process which promotes environmental effectiveness in organizations. It is designed to maximize efficiencies in the consumption of resources that contribute to climate change. When implemented effectively, CPM techniques can reduce operating costs, realizing gains in [[brand equity]], competitive advantage and stakeholder value. Initially introduced by [[First Carbon Solutions]], CPM uses [[Kaizen|Japanese kaizen]] philosophy which continuously improves workplace practices to reduce wastage, this is combined [[Business process management|business process management (BPM)]] which increases efficiency. Governments who resorts to legal mechanisms and regulation to deal with the risks of climate change, techniques such as CPM are directed towards a corporate approach in helping reduce [[Greenhouse gas|greenhouse gas emissions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Carbon management and sustainability  | url=http://www.firstcarbonsolutions.com/ | work= First Carbon Solutions | accessdate=2010-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Outsourcing 2010: Green growth, public sector deals and rise of the SME |url=http://www.silicon.com/technology/it-services/2010/01/12/outsourcing-2010-green-growth-public-sector-deals-and-rise-of-the-sme-39745317/ |work=Silicon, a CBS Interactive Limited |accessdate=2010-02-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323065152/http://www.silicon.com/technology/it-services/2010/01/12/outsourcing-2010-green-growth-public-sector-deals-and-rise-of-the-sme-39745317/ |archivedate=2010-03-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Going green |url=http://www.bworldonline.com/main/content.php?id=5871 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923221516/http://www.bworldonline.com/main/content.php?id=5871 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2015-09-23 |work=Business World Online |accessdate=2010-02-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= What is your carbon footprint?  | url= http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=551149&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=85 | work=Philippine Star | accessdate=2010-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10211">The '''Common Image Generator Interface''' (CIGI) (pronounced sig-ee), is an on-the-wire data protocol that allows communication between an Image Generator and its host simulation.  The interface is designed to promote a standard way for a host device to communicate with an image generator (IG) within the industry. 

CIGI enables plug-and-play by standard-compliant image generator vendors and reduces integration costs when upgrading visual systems.

[[File:Airplane CIGI-communication.jpg|thumb|Sample communication between an Image Generator Host, and a Viewer.]]

== Background ==

Most high-end simulators do not have everything running on a single machine the way popular home software Flight Simulators are currently implemented. The airplane model is run on one machine, normally referred to as the host, and the out the window visuals or scene graph program is run on another, usually referred to as an Image Generator (IG).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mail-archive.com/flightgear-devel@flightgear.org/msg00183.html&lt;/ref&gt; Frequently there are multiple IGs required to display the surrounding environment created by a host.  CIGI is the interface between the 'host' and the IGs. 

The main goal of CIGI is to capitalize on previous investments through the use of a common interface. CIGI is designed to assist suppliers and integrators of IG systems with ease of integration, code reuse, and overall cost reduction.

In the past most image generators provided their own proprietary interface; every host had to implement that interface making changing image generators a costly ordeal. CIGI was created to standardize the interface between the host and the image generator so that little modification would be needed to switch image generators. The CIGI initiative was largely spearheaded by The Boeing Company during the early 21st century.

The latest version of CIGI (CIGI 4.0) was developed by the Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization (SISO) in the form of SISO-STD-013-2014, Standard for Common Image Generator Interface (CIGI), Version 4.0, dated 22 August 2014. SISO-STD-013-2014 is freely available from SISO&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sisostds.org/ProductsPublications/Standards/SISOStandards.aspx/&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Definitions ==

'''Image generator''' – In this context an image generator consists of one or more rendering channels that produce an image that can be used to visualize an “Out-The-Window” scene, or images produced by various sensor simulations such as Infra-red, Day TV, Electro-Optical, and Night Vision.

'''Host simulation''' – In this context a “Host” is the computational system that provides information about the device being simulated so that the image generator can portray the correct scenery to the user. This information is passed via CIGI to the image generator.

== Maturation ==

CIGI 4 is the latest version of the standard as was approved by the [[Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization]] on August 22, 2014.  CIGI became an ''international SISO standard'' known as SISO-STD-013-2014; which contains the CIGI version 4.0 Interface Control Document (ICD)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sisostds.org/ProductsPublications/Standards/SISOStandards.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;.

CIGI 4.0 is the official standard, published by [[Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization | SISO]].  Previous versions of CIGI were spearheaded by Boeing include CIGI v3.3&lt;ref&gt;http://cigi.sourceforge.net/specification.php&lt;/ref&gt;,  in November 2008, v3.2&lt;ref&gt;http://cigi.sourceforge.net/files/CIGI_ICD_3_2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; April 2006, v3.1&lt;ref&gt;http://cigi.sourceforge.net/files/CIGI_ICD_3_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; June 2004, v3&lt;ref&gt;http://cigi.sourceforge.net/files/CIGI_ICD_3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; November 2003, v2&lt;ref&gt;http://cigi.sourceforge.net/files/CIGI_ICD_2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in March 2002, and the original (v1) in March 2001&lt;ref&gt;http://cigi.sourceforge.net/files/CIGI_ICD_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Protocol dependencies ==

UDP: Typically, CIGI uses UDP as its transport protocol, but it should be noted that CIGI does not require a specific transport mechanism, only packet definition conformance. CIGI traffic does not have a well known port; however, the use of ports 8004-8005 has been widely adopted by commercial image generator vendors implementations.  [Ref:&lt;ref&gt;https://wiki.wireshark.org/CIGI&lt;/ref&gt;]

== Development Tools ==

=== Host Emulator ===

The ''Host Emulator'' can be used as a surrogate to manipulate the interface when a simulation Host is not available. It is a Windows-based image generator Host application used to develop, integrate and test image generators that use the CIGI protocol. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for the creation, modification and deletion of entities; manipulation of views; control of environmental attributes and phenomena; and other host functions.

The ''Host Emulator'' has several features that are useful for integration and testing. A free-flight mode allows for fixed-wing and rotorcraft flight, movement along entity axes and free rotation using a joystick or a joystick-like widget.  Scripting and record/playback features support regression testing, demonstrations and other tasks needing exact reproduction of certain sequences of events. A packet-level snoop feature allows the user to examine the contents of CIGI messages, image generator response times and latencies.

A ''Heartbeat Monitor'' Window shows a graphical timing history of the Image Generator’s data frame rate. Other features include explicit packet creation, animation control, missile flyouts and a situation display window (Host Emulator 3.x only).

=== Multi-Purpose Viewer ===

The ''Multi-Purpose Viewer'' (MPV) provides the basic functionality expected of an Image Generator, such as loading and displaying a terrain database, displaying entities and so forth. The Multi-Purpose Viewer can be used as a surrogate to manipulate the interface when a real Image Generator is not available. The MPV is capable of operating with both the Windows and Linux operating systems.

=== CIGI Class Library ===

The CCL is an object-oriented software interface that automatically handles message composition and decomposition (i.e. packing, unpacking and byte swapping to the ICD specification) on both the Host and Image Generator sides of the interface. The CCL interprets Host or Image Generator messages based on compile time parameters. It also performs error handling and translation between different versions of CIGI.

Each packet type has its own class. The individual packet members are accessed through packet class accessors. Outgoing messages are constructed by placing each packet into the outgoing buffer using a streaming operator. Incoming messages are parsed using callback or event-based mechanisms that supply the using program with fully populated packet objects.

=== Current tool suite ===

A set of CIGI development tools for the ''Host Emulator'', and ''CIGI Class Library'' were developed by Chas Whitley and members of the SISO CIGI Product Support Group.  The latest packages are available on the RTeng.Pro website at:

* http://www.rteng.pro/CIGI/

Specifically:

* http://www.RTeng.Pro/CIGI/CurrentVersion/zip/ccl_4_0_v2_vc10.zip
* http://www.RTeng.Pro/CIGI/CurrentVersion/zip/HostEmulator_v4.0.0_vc10.zip
* http://www.RTeng.Pro/CIGI/CurrentVersion/zip/HostEmulator_v4.0.0_vc12.zip

Comments/Suggestions to the package can be directed to the SISO discussion board at:  https://discussions.sisostds.org/index.htm?A0=SAC-PSG-CIGI

=== Wireshark ===

''Wireshark'' is a free and open source packet analyzer. It is used for network troubleshooting, analysis, software and communications protocol development, and education.  Wireshark provides a dissector for CIGI packets.  As of October 2016, “The CIGI dissector is fully functional for CIGI version 2 and 3. Version 1 is not yet implemented.”&lt;ref&gt;https://wiki.wireshark.org/CIGI&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Older versions of CIGI ===
A CIGI Interface Control Document (ICD) and development suite is available in open source format. The tools, ICD, and accompanying user documentation can be found and downloaded from the [http://cigi.sourceforge.net/ CIGI sourceforge web site].

The sourceforge version of the MPV is limited in its support of CIGI data packets and is intended to grow as needs arise. The MPV uses CIGI 3 as its interface, but the MPV is backward-compatible with earlier CIGI versions through the use of the CCL. The MPV uses the [[OpenSceneGraph | Open Scene Graph]] library to render a scene. The scene graph is manipulated according to the CIGI commands received from the Host via the CCL. The MPV itself is an application layer that consists of a small kernel leveraging heavily on a plug-in architecture for ease of maintainability and flexibility.

An implementer can implement the interface from scratch, however a full suite of integration tools is available. These tools consist of three elements. The ''Host Emulator'' (HE), the ''Multi-Purpose Viewer'' (MPV), and the ''CIGI Class Library'' (CCL).

The '''conservation and restoration of archaeological sites''' is the process of professionally protecting an archaeological site from further damage and restore it to a previous state. 
Archaeological sites require an extra level of care in regards to their conservation and restoration. Archaeology, even with through documentation, is a destructive force. This is because once a site has been even partially excavated, it cannot be put back the way it was, so in order to continue getting information from the site, it must be conserved to the current best standards.

==Life of a site==
According to Ashurst and Shalom, archaeological sites have several phases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ashurst|first1=John|last2=Shalom|first2=Asi|title=Reading 38: Short Story: The Demise, Discovery, Destruction and Salvation of a Ruin (2007) in "Archaeological Sites: Conservation and Management"|date=2012|publisher=The Getty Conservation Institute|location=Los Angeles|page=353-364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#'''Creation of the Site:''' During this phase, the site is in use and has been established.
#'''Deterioration:''' After the site has been abandoned, natural forces take hold of the area and begin to weaken any structures that have been built. Animals also will burrow through the remnants, destroying floors, walls, and moving objects around. As walls and structures fall, they settle in different patterns and wind and water fill in the openings with dirt and dust.
#'''Identification:''' The site might be identified by archaeologists, or it might be identified by locals or other non-professionals. 
#'''Excavation:''' There are many ways that an excavation can take place. One is that locals or other interested people decide that they want to investigate themselves. Whether this is simply for pot hunting (illegal digging and collecting of artifacts) or as more of an actual attempt at amateur excavation, it can easily damage the site and regularly makes interpretation more difficult. Even when excavated by professionals, sometimes improper techniques or documentation can actually lead to further damage. If done properly, archaeological excavations will reveal many aspects, while still protecting others and detailed documentation takes place to allow the site to be virtually reconstructed as best as possible.
#'''Further Deterioration:''' If the site is then left open, there is a renewal of deterioration since areas are now re-exposed to the weather. 
#'''Ignorant Repair:''' There are many instances where people, with good intentions, attempt to conserve and repair a site. However, it results in more damage than assistance. Some ways that this happens is the use of inappropriate materials, inappropriate uses, as well as the lack of understanding of the original condition of the site (example: construction techniques, last used layout, et cetera). 
#'''Correct Conservation:''' In this instance, correct conservation materials and techniques are used in order to preserve the condition the site was found in, and in rare cases rebuild where things have fallen over. The basic goal, however, is simply to preserve how it was found.
#'''Reburial:''' In the case that the site cannot be properly preserved while in the open (due to funding or other reasons), one of the better conservation techniques is simply to rebury the site in order to protect it from further deterioration.&lt;ref name="Reburial"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Demas|first1=Martha|title="Site unseen": The Case for Reburial of Archaeological Sites|journal=Conservation and Management of Archaeological Sites|volume=6|issue=3-4|pages=137-154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of these phases can be repeated and happen in a variety of orders.

==Dangers==
===Weathering===
The source of most damage is weather. Erosion through wind, rain, freeze-thaw, and evaporation are extremely common and other than covering the site entirely cannot be prevented. However, more dramatic factors are natural disasters: floods, fires, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, et cetera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meier|first1=Hans-Rudolf|last2=Petzet|first2=Michael|last3=Will|first3=Thomas|title=Cultural Heritage and Natural Disasters| date=2008|publisher=TUDpress|location=Germany|url=http://www.international.icomos.org/risk/2007/natural_disasters/HR_Special_2007_Disasters_ebook_20091116.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best way to protect archaeological sites from these larger events is to formulate a [[risk management]] plan. The basics of this are to first identify what threatens the site the most and then determine its susceptibility to it. This plan will be much like that for any structure or area, the only difference is that there are no codes that must be upheld.

An example of how some locations are dealing with this is in Florida, where they have faced many floods as well as soil erosion. A technique they have been putting into effect is easements in order to protect the archaeological sites from this risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conservation Easements|url=http://dos.myflorida.com/historical/archaeology/cultural-resource-protection/conservation-easements/|website=Florida Division of Historical Resources|publisher=Florida Department of State}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
[[File:Phoenix-Pueblo Grande Ruin-Hohokam Village-2.JPG|thumb|Pueblo Grande Ruin-Hohokam Village. Note the buildings in the background; this is in downtown Phoenix, Arizona.]]
An unfortunate risk to archaeological sites is development itself. As the world continues to develop and build new buildings and roadways, many times archaeological sites are damaged. An example of this is in Arizona. There was an Ancient Puebloan site that dates to A.D. 900-1350 was damaged by construction activities while putting in a new road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeMar|first1=David|title=The Result of a Damage Assessment and Limited Data Recovery Conducted at Site AZ-P-43-22 Located Near Pine Springs Wide Ruins Chapter, Fort Defiance Agency, Apache County, Arizona|date=May 15, 1996|publisher=San Juan County Museum Association|location=Farmington, NM}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the damage was assessed, it was determined that the site is not eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. However, this determination was made because there is not enough remaining for it to be of any "information important in prehistory or history."

While development cannot be discontinued simply to protect archaeological sites, having a basic understanding of what might be impacted before development takes place could help protect sites and at least the information they can provide. The Arizona Antiquities Act of 1960 is an example of some ways in which archaeological sites can be protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haury|first1=Emil|title=The Arizona Antiquities Act of 1960|journal=Kiva|volume=26|issue=1|pages=19-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vandalism===
Vandalism is also a prominent force of damage to archaeological sites. A range of actions can be considered, including graffiti, carving, deconstruction, and burning. These can be intentional or unintentional. Intentional vandalism is when visitors know that there is an archaeological site and yet still chose to harm it in some way. Unintentional vandalism happens when the visitor vandalizes while not realizing they are at an archaeological site.

An example of an unintentional vandalism is if someone is hunting small game and they see several rock around and decide to pile them up into a berm to shoot from behind. Unbeknownst to them, those rocks were not just naturally placed but actually a collapsed wall of an ancient building, with the majority of it underground. An example of intentional vandalism is graffiti. This can be considered intentional even if the visitors are unaware of the location being an archaeological site, because there is purposeful destruction even of a natural location. [[Tumamoc Hill]] in Tucson, Arizona has been subjected to this form of vandalism for centuries. Tumamoc Hill has a site on its top and has rock art all along the sides. It appears as though visitors throughout history have decided to join in on this tradition by adding their own initials and artwork.&lt;ref name="Tumamoc"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hartmann|first1=Gayle|last2=Boyle|first2=Peter|title=New Perspectives on the Rock Art and Prehistoric Settlement Organization of Tumamoc Hill, Tucson, Arizona|date=2013|publisher=Arizona State Museum, The University of Arizona|location=Tucson|isbn=978-1-889747-93-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to protect an archaeological site from vandalism, a combination of techniques needs to be used. The most important is education of the public. This isn't just in terms of explaining that vandalism is bad, but rather to also educate them on the importance of these sites and what can be lost if they do chose to vandalize the site. This can be as easily done as adding signage. Another strategy is to discourage the activity through adding barriers, patrols, or even full-time observation. Another vital way to help is to routinely survey the area in order to track changes. This technique can also assist in terms of weathering damage.&lt;ref name="Tumamoc" /&gt;

===War===
[[File:Taller Buddha of Bamiyan before and after destruction.jpg|thumb|Taller Buddha of Bamiyan before and after destruction ]]
Throughout history, war has also caused much destruction of archaeological and historical sites. The Nazis during World War II destroyed many buildings during the [[planned destruction of Warsaw]], including several palaces and other buildings dating back to before the 13th century. In more recent times, the Taliban destroyed the sacred Buddha statue in Afghanistan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rashid|first1=Ahmed|title=After 1,700 Years, Buddhas fall to Taliban dynamite|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/1326063/After-1700-years-Buddhas-fall-to-Taliban-dynamite.html|website=The Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ISIS YouTube videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Perez|first1=Chris|title=ISIS ransacks museum, destroys 2,000-year-old artifacts|url=https://nypost.com/2015/02/26/isis-destroys-ancient-iraqi-artifacts/|website=New York Post|publisher=NYP Holdings, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prevention of this is virtually impossible without large-scale efforts such as those done by the [[Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program]] that has become popularized by the 2014 movie ''[[The Monuments Men]]''.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==People involved==
===Archaeologists===
The goal of archaeologists as well as other archaeological site conservators is "To preserve the physical remains of our past and to employ them in perpetuating our historical heritage."&lt;ref name="Arch" &gt;{{cite book|last1=South|first1=Stanley|title=The Role of the Archaeologist in the Conservation-Preservation Process in "Preservation and Conservation: Principles and Practices"|date=1976|publisher=The Preservation Press|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=35-43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The way an archaeologist can assist in this is to be as thorough in their documentation as possible. This way, even if the site is physically destroyed, there are existing records of how it once was. It is also important that archaeologists use excavation techniques that impact the site as little as possible and saves features. A current technique used is that the entire site is not actually excavated, only parts that are viewed as being able to answer research questions the best.&lt;ref name="Arch" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marshall|first1=John|title=Reading 9: Conservation Manual (1923) in "Archaeological Sites: Conservation and Management"|date=2012|publisher=Getty Conservation Institute|location=Los Angeles|pages=47-49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A previous technique used was to reconstruct walls and other features of the site in order to make it look more like it did when in use, however that has been mostly going out of style and instead the preservation of how the site was found is growing greater and greater in importance.

===Visitors===
Visitors hold a large responsibility in regards to archaeological site preservation. This goes beyond just vandalism. Even just their presence can be harmful for a site. An example of this happened at [[Recapture Canyon]] in Utah. In 2007, the United States Bureau of Land Management (BLM) had to close access to the canyon to off-road vehicles due to the damage it was causing local archaeological sites.&lt;ref name="BLM"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crandall|first1=Megan|title=BLM Statement Regarding Proposed Illegal ATV Ride in Recapture Canyon|url=http://www.blm.gov/ut/st/en/info/newsroom/2014/may/blm_statement_regarding.html|website=BLM}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, several visitors did not listen to this and actually created a wider trail through the canyon. Also, in May 2014 a large protest was held. This protest consisted of hundreds of protesters riding off-road vehicles through the canyon itself.&lt;ref name="BLM" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kuzmanic|first1=Joyce|title=Blanding: OHV riders, militia protest BLM ride through Recapture Canyon|url=http://www.stgeorgeutah.com/news/archive/2014/05/10/jek-ohv-riders-militia-gather-protest-blm/#.VTFlM5MtwjU|publisher=St. George News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the large amount of people going through in such a short amount of time, it is very possible that the protest itself caused further damage.

In order to combat further damage, archaeological sites that are open to the public are given trails that do not actually impact the site while still giving visitors a good view of it. It is important for visitors to understand their own impact on archaeological sites they visit. If there is a designated path, they should remain on it. If they see artifacts, they can point to them and take pictures but not pick them up and move them.

===Conservators===
Conservators are the leaders in going the extra mile for archaeological site conservation. It is these specialists that need to formulate the largest and longest-lasting plan. Martha Demas has created a great outline that conservators can rely on in order to create the most impactful plan.&lt;ref name="Reburial" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Demas|first1=Martha|title=Reading 64: Planning of Conservation and Management of Archaeological Sites: A Values-Based Approach (2000) in "Archaeological Sites: Conservation and Management"|date=2012|publisher=Getty Conservation Institute|location=Los Angeles|pages=653-675}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#Identification and description
##Aims: ''What are the aims and expectations of the planning process?''
##Stakeholders: ''Who should be involved in the planning process?''
##Documentation and Description: ''What is known about the site and what needs to be understood?''
#Assessment and Analysis

#Periodic Review and Revision

==Techniques==
The purpose of any technique used on an archaeological site is to strengthen its ability to resist damage and/or reinstate its cultural significance and ability to teach about its history.

===Restoration===
Restoration is the "returning of the existing fabric of a place to a known earlier state by removing accretions or by reassembling existing components without the introduction of new material."&lt;ref name="Rest"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woolfitt|first1=Catherine|title=Reading 51: Preventive Conservation of Ruins: Reconstruction, Reburial and Enclosure (2007) in "Archaeological Sites: Conservation and Management"|date=2012|publisher=Getty Conservation Institute|location=Los Angeles|pages=503-513}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest difficulty in this technique is the lack of introducing new material. Ideally, this is the primary technique to be used in order to strengthen the site from further damage.

===Reconstruction===
[[File:Pucllana Archaeological site - restoration.jpg|thumb|[[Huaca Pucllana]] Reconstruction Effort]]
Reconstruction is "returning a place to a known earlier state; distinguished from restoration by the introduction of new material into the fabric."&lt;ref name="Rest" /&gt; The aim of restoration is to "preserve and reveal the aesthetic and historic value of the monument and is based on respect for original material and authentic documents."&lt;ref name="ICOMOS"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Petzet|first1=Michael|title=International Charters for Conservation and Restoration|date=2004|publisher=ICOMOS|location=Germany|edition=2|url=http://openarchive.icomos.org/431/1/Monuments_and_Sites_1_Charters.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also debate on whether this is considered conservation work or not, due to potential miss use of that fact in order to over-reconstruct.&lt;ref name="Rest" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rest2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Price|first1=Nicholas|title=Reading 52: The Reconstruction of Ruins: Principles and Practices (2009) in "Archaeological Sites: Conservation and Management"|date=2012|publisher=Getty Conservation Institute|location=Los Angeles|pages=514-527}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appropriateness of this technique is highly dependent upon the region, the amount of known knowledge of the site itself, as well as the actual condition of the site. The older a site, the more difficult it is to be confident in the reconstruction. Reconstruction should also be identifiable upon inspection as well as reversible.&lt;ref name="Rest2" /&gt; A common form of reconstruction is the re-plastering of floors and walls. Due to weathering, the plaster that originally protected surfaces has eroded away and left the surfaces vulnerable. The re-plastering then adds that layer of protection back and in many cases was at least the same technique as originally even if it isn't exactly the same material.

===Recreation/renovation===
Recreation/renovation is the "speculative creation of a presumed earlier state on the basis of surviving evidence from that place to other sites, and on deductions drawn from that evidence using new materials."&lt;ref name="Rest" /&gt; This is the least favorable option as it is less likely to reinstate the originality of the site and many times includes the destruction of existing authentic materials in order to add new materials. It is deemed justifiable if it is the only form of effective conservation available. 
or if conservation measures prove to be unfeasible.&lt;ref name="ICOMOS" /&gt;

===Relocation===
[[File:Abusimbel.jpg|thumb|Mid-move of the Abu Simbel Temples]]
Relocation is a dramatic form of conservation which involves the physical movement of the site or part of the site itself.&lt;ref name="ICOMOS" /&gt; This should only take place if the site would be heavily damaged or even eliminated if it were to not be moved. A famous example of this is the move of the [[Abu Simbel temples]]. The movement of these temples was expensive as well as challenging, but if the move did not take place they would be completely underwater due to the construction of the [[Aswan High Dam]].

{{Linguistics}}
'''Constraint-based grammars''' can perhaps be best understood in contrast to [[generative grammar]]s. A generative grammar lists all the transformations, merges, movements, and deletions that can result in all [[well-formedness|well-formed]] sentences, while constraint-based grammars, take the opposite approach, allowing anything that is not otherwise constrained. "The grammar is nothing but a set of constraints that structures are required to satisfy in order to be considered well-formed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pollard|first1=Carl|title=The nature of constraint-based grammar|url=http://isli.khu.ac.kr/journal/content/data/15/1.pdf|website=11th Pacific Asian conference on language, information and computation}}&lt;/ref&gt; "A constraint-based grammar is more like a data base or a knowledge representation system than it is like a collection of algorithms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pollard|first1=Carl|title=The nature of constraint-based grammar|url=http://isli.khu.ac.kr/journal/content/data/15/1.pdf|website=11th Pacific Asian conference on language, information and computation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Critical Commons''' is an online repository of user-generated media. The archive is a project of the [[Media Arts and Practice]] division of the [[USC School of Cinematic Arts]]. The project supports the [[fair use]] of copyrighted media by educators.

Critical Commons was established in 2008 by [[Steve F. Anderson]] and is an ongoing project of the [[Media Arts and Practice]] division of the [[USC School of Cinematic Arts]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2138">In [[astrophysics]], the '''Darwin–Radau equation''' gives an approximate relation between the [[moment of inertia factor]] of a planetary body and its rotational speed and shape.  The moment of inertia factor is directly related to the largest principal [[moment of inertia]], ''C''.  It is assumed that the rotating body is in [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] and is an [[ellipsoid of revolution]].  The Darwin–Radau equation states&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bourda | first = G |author2=Capitaine N | year = 2004 | title = Precession, nutation, and space geodetic determination of the Earth's variable gravity field | journal = [[Astronomy and Astrophysics]] | volume = 428 | pages = 691–702 | doi = 10.1051/0004-6361:20041533 | bibcode=2004A&amp;A...428..691B|arxiv = 0711.4575 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

where ''M'' and ''R&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' represent the mass and mean equatorial radius of the body.  Here λ is the [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|d'Alembert]] parameter and the [[Rodolphe Radau|Radau]] parameter η is defined as

'''Deep inspiration breath-hold''' (DIBH) is a method of delivering [[radiotherapy]] while limiting [[Exposure (radiation)|radiation exposure]] to the heart and lungs.&lt;ref name='International Journal of Radiation Oncology'&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=10524412|year=1999|author1=Hanley|first1=J|title=Deep inspiration breath-hold technique for lung tumors: The potential value of target immobilization and reduced lung density in dose escalation|journal=International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics|volume=45|issue=3|pages=603–11|last2=Debois|first2=M.

J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used primarily for treating left-sided [[breast cancer]].

The technique involves a patient holding their breath during treatment. In DIBH techniques, treatment is only delivered at certain points in the breathing cycle, where the patient holds their breath. Since the relative positions of organs in the chest naturally changes during breathing, this allows treatment to be delivered to the target (tumour) while other organs are in the optimal position to receive least dose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deep Inspiration Breath Hold Technique (DIBH)|url=http://www.actionradiotherapy.org/for-patients/deep-inspiration-breath-hold-technique-dibh/|website=Action Radiotherapy|accessdate=4 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment Methods ==
In the DIBH technique, the patient is initially maintained at quiet tidal [[breathing]] (i.e. normal, relaxed breathing),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Palmer|first1=John|last2=Allen|first2=Julian|last3=Mayer|first3=Oscar|title=Tidal Breathing Analysis|journal=NeoReviews|date=May 2004|volume=5|issue=5|pages=e186–e193|doi=10.1542/neo.5-5-e186}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by a deep inspiration, a deep expiration, a second deep inspiration, and breath-hold. At this point the patient is at approximately 100% [[vital capacity]], and simulation, verification, and treatment take place during this phase of breath-holding.&lt;ref name=":0" &gt;{{cite journal|pmid=10924975|year=2000|author1=Rosenzweig|first1=K. E.|title=The deep inspiration breath-hold technique in the treatment of inoperable non-small-cell lung cancer|journal=International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics|volume=48|issue=1|pages=81–7|last2=Hanley|first2=J|last3=Mah|first3=D|last4=Mageras|first4=G|last5=Hunt|first5=M|last6=Toner|first6=S|last7=Burman|first7=C|last8=Ling|first8=C.

A.|doi=10.1016/s0360-3016(00)00583-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients will have their lung capacity and natural breathing cycle measured so that a comfortable breath-hold capacity can be set. During DIBH, the patient may wear a pair of video goggles which displays their breathing cycle and shows them when they need to inhale and hold their breath.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Deep Inspiration Breath-Hold |url = http://www.linford-wood.com/our-services/radiotherapy/deep-inspiration-breath-hold/|website = Linford Wood Medical Centre|access-date = 2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients who cannot maintain DIBH can still benefit from lung tracking techniques, for example [[4DCT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bourland|first1=J. Daniel|title=Image-Guided Radiation Therapy|date=2012|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781439802731|page=196|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Za2WhskWHWcC&amp;pg=PA196|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two basic methods of performing DIBH: free-breathing breath-hold, and [[spirometry]]-monitored deep inspiration breath hold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Latty|first1=Drew|last2=Stuart|first2=Kirsty E.|last3=Wang|first3=Wei|last4=Ahern|first4=Verity|title=Review of deep inspiration breath-hold techniques for the treatment of breast cancer|journal=Journal of Medical Radiation Sciences|date=March 2015|volume=62|issue=1|pages=74–81|doi=10.1002/jmrs.96|pmc=4364809|pmid=26229670}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Free-breathing breath-hold===
Free-breathing breath-hold, also known as real-time position management (RPM) DIBH utilises an infra-red camera and markers placed on the patient to track movement of their chest, and their breathing.&lt;ref name="Nagata15"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nagata|first1=Yasushi|title=Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy: Principles and Practices|date=2015|publisher=Springer|isbn=9784431548836|page=52|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cvlUCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA52|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spirometry-monitored breath-hold===
Spirometry based designs are known as active breathing coordinator (ABC) DIBH systems. ABC utilises a mouth piece for the patient which can be used to control the flow of air to provide more reproducible results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bellon|first1=Jennifer R.|last2=Wong|first2=Julia S.|last3=MacDonald|first3=Shannon M.|last4=Ho|first4=Alice Y.|title=Radiation Therapy Techniques and Treatment Planning for Breast Cancer|date=2016|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319403922|page=80|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b0gWDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=80|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness==
The DIBH technique provides an advantage to conventional free-breathing treatment by decreasing lung density, reducing normal safety margins, and enabling more accurate treatment. These improvements contribute to the effective exclusion of normal lung tissue from the high-dose region and permit the use of higher treatment doses without increased risks of [[toxicity]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Treatment of patients with the DIBH technique is feasible in a clinical setting. With this technique, consistent lung inflation levels are achieved in patients, as judged by both spirometry and verification films. Breathing-induced tumor motion is significantly reduced using DIBH compared to free breathing, enabling better target coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=11072177|year=2000|author1=Mah|first1=D|title=Technical aspects of the deep inspiration breath-hold technique in the treatment of thoracic cancer|journal=International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics|volume=48|issue=4|pages=1175–85|last2=Hanley|first2=J|last3=Rosenzweig|first3=K.

==Future research ==
There is currently no clear selection criteria to predict which patients will benefit most from the DIBH technique, other than left [[breast]] laterality. There is evidence to suggest [[parasagittal]] cardiac contact distance is a promising metric for selection and should be assessed in all future DIBH planning studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Review of deep inspiration breath-hold techniques for the treatment of breast cancer|journal = Journal of Medical Radiation Sciences|date = 2015-03-01|issn = 2051-3895|pmc = 4364809|pmid = 26229670|pages = 74–81|volume = 62|issue = 1|doi = 10.1002/jmrs.96|first = Drew|last = Latty|first2 = Kirsty E|last2 = Stuart|first3 = Wei|last3 = Wang|first4 = Verity|last4 = Ahern}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[music theory]], the '''descending tetrachord''' is a series of four notes from a [[scale (music)|scale]], or [[tetrachord]], arranged in order from highest to lowest, or descending order. For example, &lt;sub&gt;{{music|scale|8}}&lt;/sub&gt;-{{music|b}}&lt;sub&gt;{{music|scale|7}}&lt;/sub&gt;-{{music|b}}&lt;sub&gt;{{music|scale|6}}&lt;/sub&gt;- &lt;sub&gt;{{music|scale|5}}&lt;/sub&gt;, as created by the [[Andalusian cadence]]. The descending tetrachord may fill a [[perfect fourth]] or a [[chromatic fourth]].

Within the field of [[molecular biology]], the '''epitranscriptome''' includes all the biochemical modifications of the [[RNA]] (the [[transcriptome]]) within a [[Cell (biology)|cell]]. In analogy to [[epigenetics]] that describes "functionally relevant changes to the [[genome]] that do not involve a change in the [[Nucleic acid sequence|nucleotide sequence]]", epitranscriptomics involves all functionally relevant changes to the [[transcriptome]] that do not involve a change in the [[ribonucleotide]] sequence. Thus, the epitranscriptome can be defined as the ensemble of such functionally relevant changes. 

There are several types of RNA modifications that impact [[gene expression]]. These modifications happen to many types of cellular RNA including, but not limited to, [[ribosomal RNA]] (rRNA), [[transfer RNA]] (tRNA), [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA), and [[small nuclear RNA]] (snRNA). The most common and well-understood mRNA modification at present is N&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-Methyladenosine (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A), which has been observed to occur an average of three times in every mRNA molecule.

Currently, work is focused on determining the types of and location of RNA modifications, determining if these modification have function, and if so, what is their mechanism of action. Similar to the [[epigenome]], the epitranscriptome has "writers" and "erasers" that mark RNA and "readers" that translate those marks into function. One function that has been elucidated involves the [[enzyme]] [[ADAR|adenosine deaminase (ADAR)]], which acts on RNA. ADAR affects a series of cellular processes, including alternative splicing, microRNAs, the [[innate immune system]], and leads to protein recoding especially for important receptors in the [[central nervous system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tajaddod M, Jantsch MF, Licht K | title = The dynamic epitranscriptome: A to I editing modulates genetic information | journal = Chromosoma | volume = 125 | issue = 1 | pages = 51–63 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 26148686 | pmc = 4761006 | doi = 10.1007/s00412-015-0526-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discovered in 1974,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Desrosiers R, Friderici K, Rottman F | title = Identification of methylated nucleosides in messenger RNA from Novikoff hepatoma cells | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 71 | issue = 10 | pages = 3971–5 | date = October 1974 | pmid = 4372599 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.71.10.3971 | pmc = 434308 }}&lt;/ref&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A is the most abundant [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] mRNA modification&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/b106365|title=Fine-Tuning of RNA Functions by Modification and Editing|last=Bokar|first=Joseph A. | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg|isbn=9783540244950|series=Topics in Current Genetics|pages=141–177|doi=10.1007/b106365}}&lt;/ref&gt;; most mRNAs contain approximately three m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A residues.&lt;ref name="Yue_2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yue Y, Liu J, He C | title = RNA N6-methyladenosine methylation in post-transcriptional gene expression regulation | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 29 | issue = 13 | pages = 1343–55 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 26159994 | doi = 10.1101/gad.262766.115 | pmc = 4511210 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some mRNA transcripts do not contain any m&lt;sup href="adenosine"&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A at all, while others may have 10 or more.&lt;ref name="Kennedy_2017"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kennedy EM, Courtney DG, Tsai K, Cullen BR | title = Viral Epitranscriptomics | journal = Journal of Virology | volume = 91 | issue = 9 | pages = e02263–16 | date = May 2017 | pmid = 28250115 | doi = 10.1128/jvi.02263-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "epitranscriptome" was coined following transcriptome-wide mappings of m&lt;sup href="Chemical bond"&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A sites,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Meyer KD, Saletore Y, Zumbo P, Elemento O, Mason CE, Jaffrey SR | title = Comprehensive analysis of mRNA methylation reveals enrichment in 3' UTRs and near stop codons | journal = Cell | volume = 149 | issue = 7 | pages = 1635–46 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22608085 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2012.05.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dominissini D, Moshitch-Moshkovitz S, Schwartz S, Salmon-Divon M, Ungar L, Osenberg S, Cesarkas K, Jacob-Hirsch J, Amariglio N, Kupiec M, Sorek R, Rechavi G | title = Topology of the human and mouse m6A RNA methylomes revealed by m6A-seq | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7397 | pages = 201–6 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22575960 | doi = 10.1038/nature11112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but does not necessarily exclude other post-transcriptional mRNA modifications. How, and in response to what stimulus, the cell endogen&lt;s&gt;e&lt;/s&gt;ously regulates the level of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation remains unclear at present. However, it is known that the levels of this epitranscriptional mark are dynamically altered during embryonic development.

The m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A RNA methylomes of different eukaryotic organisms have two common characteristics. First of all, the mark is usually found in the R[G &gt; A]m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;AC[U&gt;A&gt;C&gt;] or RRm&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;ACH sequence. Secondly, this mark is enriched in specific regions of the [[transcriptome]]; it is mostly found close to [[stop codon]]s, in [[Three prime untranslated region|3’-UTR]]s and in long internal [[exon]]s.&lt;ref name="Yue_2015" /&gt; Nevertheless, m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A levels vary between different RNAs within a cell and between different cell types of the same organism. The mechanisms controlling the addition of m&lt;sup href="immune system"&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A to some types of RNA have been described, but others remain unknown.&lt;ref name="Noack_2018" /&gt;

==== "Writers," "erasers," and "readers" ====
The terms, “writer”, “eraser” and “reader” have been associated with [[RNA modification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Licht K, Jantsch MF | title = Rapid and dynamic transcriptome regulation by RNA editing and RNA modifications | journal = The Journal of Cell Biology | volume = 213 | issue = 1 | pages = 15–22 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 27044895 | pmc = 4828693 | doi = 10.1083/jcb.201511041 }}&lt;/ref&gt; “Eraser” is a general term used to describe an enzyme that demethylates m&lt;sup href="ribosome"&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A. Proteins that recognize and bind to m&lt;sup href="Methylation"&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A are known as “readers”. However, some of the mRNA modifications prevent the binding of some RNA binding proteins; these are called “anti-readers”.&lt;ref name="Peer_2017"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Peer E, Rechavi G, Dominissini D | title = Epitranscriptomics: regulation of mRNA metabolism through modifications | journal = Current Opinion in Chemical Biology | volume = 41 | pages = 93–98 | date = December 2017 | pmid = 29125941 | doi = 10.1016/j.cbpa.2017.10.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The “writers” and “erasers” of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A mark are mostly located in [[nuclear speckles]] (subnuclear structures enriched in [[Precursor mRNA|pre-mRNA]] splicing factors), where mRNA is processed and stored.&lt;ref name="Peer_2017" /&gt;

The m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A mark is added by a m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A [[methyltransferase]] complex post-transcriptionally. This “writer” complex is composed of [[METTL3]], [[METTL14]], [[WTAP (gene)|Wilms tumor 1-associated protein (WTAP)]], KIAA1429 and [[RBM15]].&lt;ref name="Roignant_2017"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Roignant JY, Soller M | title = 6A in mRNA: An Ancient Mechanism for Fine-Tuning Gene Expression | journal = Trends in Genetics | volume = 33 | issue = 6 | pages = 380–390 | date = June 2017 | pmid = 28499622 | doi = 10.1016/j.tig.2017.04.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; METTL3 is the catalytic subunit, whereas METTL14 is involved in the stability of the complex and RNA recruitment. WTAP is also needed in aiding the recruitment of mRNA, whereas RBM15 and its paralog RBM15B are only involved in the recruitment of lncRNAs. The role RBM15 and RBM15B may have in recruiting other types of RNA to the methyltransferase complex remains unknown.&lt;ref name="Gonzales-van_Horn_2017"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gonzales-van Horn SR, Sarnow P | title = Making the Mark: The Role of Adenosine Modifications in the Life Cycle of RNA Viruses | journal = Cell Host &amp; Microbe | volume = 21 | issue = 6 | pages = 661–669 | date = June 2017 | pmid = 28618265 | doi = 10.1016/j.chom.2017.05.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The specific recognition sites of the writers are not known, but the minimal sequence required is 5’-Rm&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;AC-3’.&lt;ref name="Kennedy_2017" /&gt; METTL3 has been proposed to also be a “reader” of the m&lt;sup href="MicroRNA"&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A mark. This function is localized in the [[cytoplasm]], where it promotes the recruitment of [[Eukaryotic initiation factor 3|eIF3]].&lt;ref name="Peer_2017" /&gt; Discovery of the METTL3 complex proved that m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A is a reversible mark, and this fact was crucial for the development of the field of epitranscriptomics.&lt;ref name="Batista_2017"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Batista PJ | title = 6-methyladenosine and Its Implications in Human Disease | journal = Genomics, Proteomics &amp; Bioinformatics | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 154–163 | date = June 2017 | pmid = 28533023 | doi = 10.1016/j.gpb.2017.03.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the [[YTH domain]] protein family act as “readers” of m&lt;sup href="Small nuclear RNA"&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A. The study of these proteins has been key in understanding the functions and effects of mRNA methylations.&lt;ref name="Roignant_2017" /&gt; It has been shown that three members of the human YTH domain family of proteins have higher binding affinities to methylated mRNA.&lt;ref name="Wang_2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang X, He C | title = Dynamic RNA modifications in posttranscriptional regulation | journal = Molecular Cell | volume = 56 | issue = 1 | pages = 5–12 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25280100 | doi = 10.1016/j.molcel.2014.09.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The YTH protein [[YTHDF3|YTHDF2]] affects mRNA by directing methylated mRNA from the translational pool to mRNA decay sites. As a result, methylated mRNA has a shorter [[half-life]] than unmethylated mRNA.

So far, two “erasers” of the m&lt;sup href="Polysome"&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A mark have been identified. ALKBH5 is a demethylase found in mammals that removes the methyl group of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A.&lt;ref name="Roignant_2017" /&gt; The second one is the fat mass and obesity associated protein ([[FTO gene|FTO]]), a demethylase that converts m&lt;sup href="MicroRNA"&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A back to [[adenosine]]. FTO preferentially demethylates the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A found closer to the mRNA cap.&lt;ref name="Roignant_2017" /&gt; This oxidative process has three steps and two intermediates: N&lt;sup href="2'-O-methylation"&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-hydroxymethyladenosine (hm&lt;sup href="methyltransferase"&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) and N&lt;sup href="polyuridylation"&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-formyladenosine (f&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A). FTO is most commonly found in nuclear speckles; however, in some species low levels of FTO can also be found in the cytoplasm.&lt;ref name="Yue_2015" /&gt; Dysfunctional FTO correlates with alterations in body weight and disease, while Alkbh5 knockout mice have impaired fertility.&lt;ref name="Wang_2014" /&gt; These two facts reflect how important the proper regulation of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A modification is for normal body function. Moreover, mutations in FTO can lead to developmental failures, brain atrophy and physiological disorders in adulthood.&lt;ref name="Noack_2018" /&gt;

==== Role in the life-cycle of mRNA ====
mRNA methylation is important throughout the entire life-cycle of the mRNA, starting with the alternative [[polyadenylation]] (APA) of some transcripts. m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A sites are often located in the last [[exon]], mostly in the 3’-UTR. The presence of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A in the 3’-UTR promotes the use of the proximal APA site, resulting in a shorter 3’-UTR. Splicing of the pre-mRNA transcripts is also greatly affected by m&lt;sup href="RNA modification"&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A. Furthermore, nuclear export of mature mRNAs depends on m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A; when the m&lt;sup href="Epitranscriptomic sequencing"&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A “writers” are inhibited, there is a delay in the export of the mature mRNAs. However, normal nuclear export does not solely depend on m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A, other mRNA marks such as 5'-methylcytosine (m&lt;sup href="Transcriptomics"&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;C) are also involved.&lt;ref name="Peer_2017" /&gt;

The m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A mark has a notable effect on [[Translation (biology)|translational dynamics]].&lt;ref name="Choi_2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Choi J, Ieong KW, Demirci H, Chen J, Petrov A, Prabhakar A, O'Leary SE, Dominissini D, Rechavi G, Soltis SM, Ehrenberg M, Puglisi JD | title = N(6)-methyladenosine in mRNA disrupts tRNA selection and translation-elongation dynamics | journal = Nature Structural &amp; Molecular Biology | volume = 23 | issue = 2 | pages = 110–5 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26751643 | doi = 10.1038/nsmb.3148 | pmc = 4826618 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are various ways in which m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A is involved in translational efficiency. For instance, this modification modulates multiple steps in the process of tRNA incorporation. On the one hand, it slows down [[Guanosine triphosphate|GTP]] hydrolysis by [[EF-Tu]] by 12-fold and the [[Peptidyl transferase|peptidyl transfer]] reaction by two-fold. It also causes a 1.5-fold increase in the amount of GTP hydrolyzed per peptidyl transfer, which indicates that a lot of proofreading is required. Moreover, because it is just a modified adenosine base, m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A base-pairs with [[uridine]] during decoding. However, the adenosine’s methylation hinders tRNA accommodation and translation elongation. When a m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A-modified [[codon]] interacts with its cognate tRNA (the tRNA with the anticodon that is complementary to a particular codon), it acts more like a near-cognate codon interaction instead of the cognate codon interaction. This can be seen in the delay in the tRNA accommodation, which is dependent upon both the position of the m&lt;sup href="Digital object identifier"&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A in the mRNA codons and on how accurate the translation is. Overall, this m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A modification leads to a kinetic loss of a factor of 18.&lt;ref name="Choi_2016" /&gt; To summarize, translation-elongation dynamics are slower for codons with m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A and different locations of these modified nucleotides in the mRNA codons affect decoding dynamics in different ways.

However, this mark can also increase translational efficiency. The m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A “reader” YTHDF1 induces the association of the modified mRNA with the [[ribosome]]. Furthermore, it also recruits the translation initiation factor eIF3 to the mRNA independently of METTL3. Additionally, eIF3 also acts as a “reader” of a m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A located in the 5’-UTR of the mRNA, which results in recruitment of the [[Eukaryotic small ribosomal subunit (40S)|40S]] translational preinitiation complex.&lt;ref name="Batista_2017" /&gt; This interaction is involved in cap-independent translation, which happens during the cellular response to [[heat shock]] stress.&lt;ref name="Peer_2017" /&gt;

m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation also modulates mRNA stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang X, Lu Z, Gomez A, Hon GC, Yue Y, Han D, Fu Y, Parisien M, Dai Q, Jia G, Ren B, Pan T, He C | title = N6-methyladenosine-dependent regulation of messenger RNA stability | journal = Nature | volume = 505 | issue = 7481 | pages = 117–20 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24284625 | doi = 10.1038/nature12730 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The "reader" YTHDF2 binds to m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A-containing mRNAs and decreases their stability by recruiting them to [[P-bodies]], in a process called methylation-dependent mRNA decay.&lt;ref name="Peer_2017" /&gt; This process is needed to rapidly degrade [[pluripotency]] transcription factor transcripts, to enable the commitment of a pluripotent stem cell to a specific cell lineage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhao BS, He C | title = Fate by RNA methylation: m6A steers stem cell pluripotency | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 16 | pages = 43 | date = February 2015 | pmid = 25723450 | doi = 10.1186/s13059-015-0609-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reduced levels of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A in mice embryos lead to embryonic lethality during the early stages of development.&lt;ref name="Noack_2018" /&gt;

==== Role of N&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-Methyladenosine (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) in alternative splicing ====
[[File:Figure_1._m6A_RNA_modification_regulation_of_alternative_splicing_mechanism.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Figure_1._m6A_RNA_modification_regulation_of_alternative_splicing_mechanism.png|thumb|503x503px|Exons of the pre-mRNA are shown in blue and introns (non-coding sequence) are in red. a) Alternative splicing involves the removal of introns from the pre-mRNA transcript. b) Adenine is methylated, forming the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A modification. c) The modified m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A is located in a uridine rich RNA stem loop, reducing the stability of the loop and increasing the accessibility to the single strands. The HNRNPC protein (involved in pre-mRNA processing) can now bind to the more accessible uridine rich region on the loop (the HNRPNC binding site), leading to the excision of intron.]]

[[Stem-loop|Stem loop]] structures can sometimes be found in [[intron]]s. m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A residues located in these stem-loops weaken base-pairing interactions within the stem, thus altering the structure of the mRNA. This phenomenon is known as m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A-Switch.&lt;ref name="Roignant_2017" /&gt;  The m&lt;sup href="Digital object identifier"&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A mark has an important role in [[alternative splicing]], since it increases the accessibility of [[HNRNPC|hnRNPC]] to its binding site. The heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C (hnRNPC) is a RNA-binding protein that complexes with both [[heterogeneous nuclear RNA]] (hnRNA) and [[pre-mRNA]] to participate in [[pre-mRNA processing]]. hnRNPC binds to a uridine-rich region in introns that can usually form stem-loops. The destabilization of the stem-loop exposes the hnRNPC binding site, which increases the accessibility of the protein to the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu N, Zhou KI, Parisien M, Dai Q, Diatchenko L, Pan T | title = N6-methyladenosine alters RNA structure to regulate binding of a low-complexity protein | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 45 | issue = 10 | pages = 6051–6063 | date = June 2017 | pmid = 28334903 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkx141 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because hnRNPC must be bound to pre-mRNA in order to fulfill its function, increased accessibility means higher activity of hnRNPC. Therefore, m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A residues located in stem-loops of introns enhance the activity of hnRNPC, which results in increased alternative splicing. Evidence supporting this claim identified that decreased m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A levels in the transcriptome lead to significantly reduced hnRNPC binding.&lt;ref name="Roignant_2017" /&gt;

m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A also has additional roles in alternative splicing by acting as the binding site for [[YTHDC1]] (YTHDC1 binds to m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A residues located in alternative exons). YTHDC1 has a double role in alternative splicing. First of all, it recruits the serine and arginine-rich splicing factor 3 (SRSF3), which promotes exon inclusion. In addition, YTHDC1 blocks binding of SRSF10, a protein involved in [[Exon skipping|exon-skipping]].&lt;ref name="Roignant_2017" /&gt;

Due to the role of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A in alternative splicing, pre-mRNAs have higher levels of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A than mature mRNAs. Moreover, m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A is more abundant in mRNAs that undergo alternative splicing compared to genes that code a single [[isoform]]. This is because alternatively spliced mRNAs are enriched in METTL3 binding sites. Splicing is affected in Mettl3 [[Knockout mouse|knock-out mice]], resulting in increased frequency of exon skipping and intron retention.&lt;ref name="Peer_2017" /&gt; However, m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A is not a general unspecific splicing factor, it only participates in the alternative splicing of certain mRNAs and lncRNAs.&lt;ref name="Noack_2018" /&gt;

==== Other roles of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A ====
m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A is not only found on mRNAs, various non-coding RNAs also contain this mark. For instance, [[XIST]], the lncRNA that initiates [[X-inactivation]], is enriched in m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A. These m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A are recognized and bound by the YTH domain protein YTHDC1. XIST mediated silencing of the X chromosome is negatively affected when XIST is not modified with m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A.&lt;ref name="Peer_2017" /&gt;

RNA molecules containing m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A are involved in UV-induced [[DNA repair|DNA damage repair]] mechanisms. When DNA is damaged, poly(A)+ transcripts containing numerous m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A residues accumulate in the region. This facilitates the accessibility of DNA-repairing proteins, such as DNA polymerase K, so that they can fulfil their function.&lt;ref name="Peer_2017" /&gt;

==== Disease ====
Alterations in the pathways leading to the addition of the removal of the m&lt;sup href="International Standard Serial Number"&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A mark result in impaired gene expression and cellular function, which can lead to disease.

Normal m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A levels are altered in a number of [[cancer]]s. Reduced m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A levels due to down regulation of METTL3 and/or METTL14 lead to the activation of a number of [[oncogene]]s, such as the gene encoding ADAM metallopeptidase domain 19 (ADAM19). Moreover, loss of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A also results in the down regulation of [[Tumor suppressor gene|tumor suppressors]] like [[CDKN2A|cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A]] (CDKN2A) and [[BRCA2|breast cancer 2]] (BRCA2). On the other hand, increased m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A levels inhibit [[tumor progression]] in certain types of cancer.&lt;ref name="Batista_2017" /&gt; In addition, [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|single nucleotide polymorphisms]] (SNPs) on the gene encoding FTO have been associated with increased risk of [[Breast cancer|breast]] and [[pancreatic cancer]]. Altered m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A levels also contribute to hypoxia-induced enrichment of breast cancer stem cells phenotype.&lt;ref name="Leighton_2018"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Leighton LJ, Ke K, Zajaczkowski EL, Edmunds J, Spitale RC, Bredy TW | title = Experience-dependent neural plasticity, learning, and memory in the era of epitranscriptomics | journal = Genes, Brain, and Behavior | volume = 17 | issue = 3 | pages = e12426 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 28926184 | doi = 10.1111/gbb.12426 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All things considered, “writers” and “erasers” of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A mark may be good potential drug targets in [[cancer therapy]].

Metabolic disorders are also affected by the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A mark due to the role of FTO. Overexpression of FTO results in increased body and [[Adipose tissue|fat mass]], whereas loss of FTO leads to a reduction in [[lean body mass]]. However, the mechanisms by which changes in FTO expression affect body and fat mass are not understood.&lt;ref name="Batista_2017" /&gt;

=== N1-methyladenosine (m&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;A) ===
N1-methyladenosine is a modified nucleoside in which a methyl group is added to N1 of the [[adenosine]] base. This modification introduces a positive charge on the nitrogen atom to which the methyl group is added, because the modified nitrogen donates its [[lone pair]] to the carbon atom of the methyl group in order to form a [[Chemical bond|bond]]. N1-methyladenosine modification is thought to regulate tRNA and rRNA stability, as well as potentially alter protein-RNA interactions or RNA secondary structures. This modification results in the [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|melting]] of double-stranded RNA, due to alterations in the RNA structure. The N1-methyladenosine modification is less common than the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A modification, with modified transcripts usually only containing a single m&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;A modification, whereas they may contain several m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A residues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dominissini D, Nachtergaele S, Moshitch-Moshkovitz S, Peer E, Kol N, Ben-Haim MS, Dai Q, Di Segni A, Salmon-Divon M, Clark WC, Zheng G, Pan T, Solomon O, Eyal E, Hershkovitz V, Han D, Doré LC, Amariglio N, Rechavi G, He C | title = The dynamic N(1)-methyladenosine methylome in eukaryotic messenger RNA | journal = Nature | volume = 530 | issue = 7591 | pages = 441–6 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26863196 | doi = 10.1038/nature16998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies of these modifications have been slow to advance due to a lack of sound methodology to locate and identify them. A few methods, such as MeRIP-seq and m&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;A-ID-seq, have been developed, but the particular adenosine that is modified still cannot be identified. A [[computation]]al tool based on the data generated from these methods called RAMPed has been developed to try to identify these particular modifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen W, Lin H | title = Recent Advances in Identification of RNA Modifications | journal = Non-Coding RNA | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 1 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 29657273 | doi = 10.3390/ncrna3010001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 5-methylcytosine (m&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;C) ===
[[5-Methylcytosine|5-methylcytosine]], commonly abbreviated as "m&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;C", is a chemical modification first identified in tRNA. Since its initial identification, 5-methylcytosine has been found in a variety of different cellular structures ranging from a variety of RNAs and even DNA. Two different kinds of RNA m&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;C "writers" have been identified: NOP2/SUN RNA methyltransferase (NSUN) and DNA methyltransferase-2. It is important to note that DNMT-2 is a protein that falls under the [[DNA methyltransferase|DNMT]] family, which contains three other DNMTs (1, 3a, and 3b) known to demonstrate methylation activity in relation to the genome. Uniquely, DNMT-2 is the only DNMT that has been confirmed to methylate both DNA and RNA, although its overall [[DNA methylation]] function is significantly less than that of its counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schaefer M, Lyko F | title = Solving the Dnmt2 enigma | journal = Chromosoma | volume = 119 | issue = 1 | pages = 35–40 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 19730874 | doi = 10.1007/s00412-009-0240-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While these writers have been identified, as of now, there are no known m&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;C "erasers"; in a broader sense, this means that reamination, or the conversion of 5-methylcytosine back into cytosine, has not been observed in RNA.&lt;ref name="Jacob_2017"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jacob R, Zander S, Gutschner T | title = The Dark Side of the Epitranscriptome: Chemical Modifications in Long Non-Coding RNAs | journal = International Journal of Molecular Sciences | volume = 18 | issue = 11 | pages = 2387 | date = November 2017 | pmid = 29125541 | doi = 10.3390/ijms18112387 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 5-methylcytosine modifications are typically found approximately 100 nucleotides downstream of translation initiation sites. This may provide some insight into the purpose of these modifications; for instance, this may indicate that these modifications are important for controlling the fate of the RNA, such as whether it will be translated or not in the case of mRNA. However, the exact purpose of the methylation at specific cytosines in RNA is currently unknown. One possibility may be that m&lt;sup href="Digital object identifier"&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;C may be associated with RNA transport, since the [[ALYREF|Aly/REF export factor]] is a known m&lt;sup href="International Standard Serial Number"&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;C binding protein.&lt;ref name="Jacob_2017" /&gt; On the other hand, m&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;C modifications could possibly be associated with the regulation of genes involved in energy and lipid metabolism, through modulation of the overall RNA translational fate.&lt;ref name="Wang_2014" /&gt;

=== Adenosine-to-Inosine ===
Adenosine-to-Inosine (A-to-I) modifications were described well before the conception of epitranscriptomics. These modifications are very common in tissues and cells of the nervous system, and malfunctions in this deamination can result in a variety of different human diseases. A-to-I deamination has been shown to cause changes in the overall RNA structure or cause changes to the protein-coding mRNAs, although changes in codons and the amino acid they code for are not commonly seen.&lt;ref name = "Shafik_2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shafik A, Schumann U, Evers M, Sibbritt T, Preiss T | title = The emerging epitranscriptomics of long noncoding RNAs | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1859 | issue = 1 | pages = 59–70 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26541084 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbagrm.2015.10.019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A-to-I RNA editing is described in more detail on the [[RNA editing|RNA editing page]].

=== Queuosine ===
[[File:Queuosine_-_Queuosin.svg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Queuosine_-_Queuosin.svg|thumb|The chemical structure of queuosine]]
[[Queuine]] (Q) is a modified nucleotide at position 34 in tRNA (queuosine is the name of the [[nucleoside]], while queuine is the name of the nucleotide). Nucleotide modifications in tRNA are not uncommon, as tRNA is one of the most heavily modified types of RNA, and nearly 80 types of modified nucleotides have been identified. Queuosine is a very heavily modified version of [[guanosine]] (G).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Morris RC, Elliott MS | title = Queuosine modification of tRNA: a case for convergent evolution | journal = Molecular Genetics and Metabolism | volume = 74 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 147–59 | date = 2001-09-01 | pmid = 11592812 | doi = 10.1006/mgme.2001.3216 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Modifications in tRNA have the well-known ability to control and modulate gene expression. The regulation of gene expression typically comes from some structural changes to the stem-loop structure of the tRNA. The editing that tRNA undergoes may have developed as a response to rare codons, and tRNA counteracts frameshifts by utilizing the modified bases. Other similar modifications to nucleotides impact the ability of tRNA to initiate translation, thus impeding gene expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Persson BC | title = Modification of tRNA as a regulatory device | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = 1011–6 | date = June 1993 | pmid = 7689685 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2958.1993.tb01645.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This modification is particularly widespread and found amongst a variety of organisms, indicating that perhaps convergent evolution took place in the development of this nucleoside. Eukaryotic cells cannot synthesize queuosine, so they must rely on prokaryotes of the microbiome to produce and increase the availability of it within the body. Depleted levels of Q34 (queuine at position 34) are associated with the development of tumors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gustilo EM, Vendeix FA, Agris PF | title = tRNA's modifications bring order to gene expression | journal = Current Opinion in Microbiology | volume = 11 | issue = 2 | pages = 134–40 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18378185 | doi = 10.1016/j.mib.2008.02.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2′-O-methylation ===
[[2'-O-methylation]] refers to the methylation of the 2' hydroxyl group of the ribose within an RNA nucleotide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kiss T | title = Small nucleolar RNA-guided post-transcriptional modification of cellular RNAs | journal = The EMBO Journal | volume = 20 | issue = 14 | pages = 3617–22 | date = July 2001 | pmid = 11447102 | doi = 10.1093/emboj/20.14.3617 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 2'-O-methylation is found in the [[five-prime cap]] of mRNAs in higher eukaryotes.&lt;ref name="Thiel_2011"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Züst R, Cervantes-Barragan L, Habjan M, Maier R, Neuman BW, Ziebuhr J, Szretter KJ, Baker SC, Barchet W, Diamond MS, Siddell SG, Ludewig B, Thiel V | title = Ribose 2'-O-methylation provides a molecular signature for the distinction of self and non-self mRNA dependent on the RNA sensor Mda5 | journal = Nature Immunology | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | pages = 137–43 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21217758 | doi = 10.1038/ni.1979 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is involved in differentiating between self and non-self mRNA.&lt;ref name="Wang_2014" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Daffis S, Szretter KJ, Schriewer J, Li J, Youn S, Errett J, Lin TY, Schneller S, Zust R, Dong H, Thiel V, Sen GC, Fensterl V, Klimstra WB, Pierson TC, Buller RM, Gale M, Shi PY, Diamond MS | title = 2'-O methylation of the viral mRNA cap evades host restriction by IFIT family members | journal = Nature | volume = 468 | issue = 7322 | pages = 452–6 | date = November 2010 | pmid = 21085181 | doi = 10.1038/nature09489 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Without the 2′-O-methylation mark the [[immune system]] triggers higher levels of [[Interferon type I|type 1 interferon]] activity.&lt;ref name="Thiel_2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wang_2014" /&gt; While this modification is not currently known to be a response to any particular phenomenon, not everything is fully understood about the mechanisms of this modification due to the difficulty of studying small RNA molecules. However, the effect on RNA stability this modification has could be regulated to modulate transcript levels.

=== Pseudouridylation ===
[[Pseudouridine]] (Ψ, 5-ribosyluracil) is the most abundant RNA modification; in fact, at one time it was considered the "fifth nucleotide". This isomer of uridine is found in various types of RNA, such as snRNA, tRNA, [[small nucleolar RNA]] (snoRNA) and many others.&lt;ref name="Jacob_2017"/&gt; Pseudouridine increases the stability of the modified RNA by making the sugar-phosphate backbone more rigid and by facilitating [[base stacking]] interactions (pseudouridine contains an extra hydrogen bond donor). When it comes to [[Watson-Crick base pair]] interactions, the pseudouridine-adenosine base pair is more stable than the uridine-adenosine base pair; therefore, pseudouridine increases stability.&lt;ref name = "Shafik_2016" /&gt; Apart from increasing RNA stability, this modification is also involved in regulation of translation. All eukaryotic [[stop codon]]s contain one uridine (UAA, UGA and UGA); conversion of this uridine to pseudouridine results in suppression of translational termination and generation of unexpected sense codons.&lt;ref name="Jacob_2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shafik_2016" /&gt; The artificial process of pseudouridylation has an effect on the function of mRNA: it changes the genetic code by making non-canonical base pairing possible in the [[ribosome]] decoding center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Meier UT | title = Pseudouridylation goes regulatory | journal = The EMBO Journal | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–4 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 21206510 | pmc = 3020123 | doi = 10.1038/emboj.2010.323 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pseudouridylation reactions are catalyzed by enzymes that contain the pseudouridine synthase domain; 13 such enzymes have been identified in humans, which are called pseudouridine synthases (PUS). These enzymes can be either RNA-dependent or RNA-independent depending on whether a small RNA is needed to guide the enzyme to its target or not. Additionally, different PUS enzymes work in different cell compartments. For instance, [[Pus4|PUS4]] (also known as TruB pseudouridine synthase family member 1, TRUB1) and [[Pus7 protein|PUS7]], which are responsible for most of the mRNA pseudouridylation, are located in the nucleus or the cytoplasm. On the other hand, several PUS enzymes, such as [[PUS1]] and TRUB2 are located in the [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]], modifying a number of mitochondrial mRNAs (mt-mRNAs).&lt;ref name="Jacob_2017" /&gt; In tRNA, PUS1 and PUS7 modify the second uridine in the UGUAR consensus sequence, as long as this sequence is located in a very structured region of the tRNA.&lt;ref name="Pereira-Montecinos_2017"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pereira-Montecinos C, Valiente-Echeverría F, Soto-Rifo R | title = Epitranscriptomic regulation of viral replication | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1860 | issue = 4 | pages = 460–471 | date = April 2017 | pmid = 28219769 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbagrm.2017.02.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To date, no pseudouridine erasers or readers have been identified. It is thought that pseudouridylation is most probably an irreversible process.&lt;ref name="Shafik_2016" /&gt;

Pseudouridine is most commonly found in tRNAs, with almost all tRNA molecules having at least one pseudouridine. Therefore, because the addition of pseudouridine happens during the normal processing of tRNA, it is not considered a epitranscriptomic mark. However, pseudouridine acts as a epigenetic mark in mRNAs and ncRNAs of the brain, since pseudouridylation in these two RNAs responds dynamically to stress and differentiation in the cell,&lt;ref name="Leighton_2018" /&gt; giving reason to believe that pseudouridylation may act as an important regulatoyr mechanism for RNA function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zaringhalam M, Papavasiliou FN | title = Pseudouridylation meets next-generation sequencing | journal = Methods | volume = 107 | pages = 63–72 | date = September 2016 | pmid = 26968262 | doi = 10.1016/j.ymeth.2016.03.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pseudouridylation in mRNA can be conserved, tissue-specific or inducible, which reflects plasticity and regulatory function.&lt;ref name="Shafik_2016" /&gt; Furthermore, expression of TRBU1, which is mostly expressed in the brain, goes up due to fear conditioning. In addition, expression of the ncRNAs needed to guide RNA-dependent PUS enzymes also goes up in response to fear.&lt;ref name="Leighton_2018"/&gt;
==== Pseudouridine detection and sequencing methods ====
{{main|Epitranscriptomic sequencing}}

There are three major techniques for the site-specific mapping of pseudouridine in RNA, called Pseudo-seq, Ψ-seq and PSI-seq. All these methods are based on the unique reaction between pseudouridine and N-cyclohexyl-N'-(2-morpholinoethyl)carbodiimide metho-p-toluenesulfonate (CMCT). The RNA to be analyzed is fragmented and incubated with CMCT. Even if CMCT can form covalent bonds with U, G and Ψ residues, only Ψ-CMC is resistant to alkaline hydrolysis (U-CMC and G-CMC get hydrolyzed). Next, [[Reverse transcriptase|reverse transcription]] is done to obtain a cDNA library, with the [[Complementary DNA|cDNAs]] terminating one nucleotide downstream the pseudouridine residue. [[DNA sequencing|Next generation sequencing]] of the cDNA library will indicate where the modified pseudouridine residue is located in the RNA. In order to do this, two cDNA libraries are prepared, one in which the RNA has undergone CMC treatment and the other one without CMC treatment. Differences in the length of the reads between the two libraries will indicate where the Ψ residues are.&lt;ref name="Jacob_2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pereira-Montecinos_2017" /&gt; Another method is called CeU-Seq, which uses a [[Biotinylation|biotinylated]] derivative of CMCT. This enables the purification and enrichment of biotinylated transcripts (transcripts modified with pseudouridine) with [[streptavidin]] columns, therefore reducing the library size and increasing sensitivity.&lt;ref name="Shafik_2016" /&gt;

Other pseudouridine detection methods include site-specific cleavage and radioactive-labeling followed by ligation-assisted extraction and thin-layer chromatography ([[Epitranscriptomic sequencing|SCARLET]]) and mass spectrometry.

== Modifications specific to different types of RNA ==

=== Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) ===
Ribosomal RNA, or [[Ribosomal RNA|rRNA]], forms the nucleic acid component of ribosomes. rRNA modifications take place in and around the [[peptidyl transferase]]center, the [[active site]] of the [[ribosome]]. Some modifications include pseudouridines, 2′-O-methylations on backbone sugars, and [[Methylation|methylated]] bases. It is not well known what the biological effects of these modifications are on the rRNA molecule, but one hypothesis is that they help stabilize the structure and enhance the function of the ribosome, especially during ribosome formation. Moreover, these modifications may alter the chemical properties of the rRNA such that the correct tertiary structure is favored. 2'-O-methylation prevents backbone [[hydrolysis]]; other noted modifications also seem to help with stabilizing rRNA [[secondary structure|secondary structures]] and preventing damage to rRNA strands. 2'-O-methylation also helps to increase [[base stacking]] forces, stabilizing the secondary and tertiary structure of rRNA even further. Collectively, these modifications in rRNA are indispensable to ribosomal function.&lt;ref name="Wang_2014" /&gt;

=== Transfer RNA (tRNA) ===
[[File:3d_tRNA.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:3d_tRNA.png|thumb|A 3D model of the complex cruciform structure of tRNA]]
[[Transfer RNA]]s, which are RNAs that participate in [[Translation (biology)|translation]], contain the greatest number of modifications of any type of RNA, with up to one-fourth of the nucleosides in these molecules containing some sort of modification in eukaryotes.&lt;ref name="Wang_2014" /&gt; There are several known reasons for the wide variety of modifications found in tRNA. First of all, such modifications allow for easier differentiation between different tRNA molecules, such as separating the initiator [[TRNAMet cytidine acetyltransferase|tRNA&lt;sup&gt;Met&lt;/sup&gt;]] from [[Elongator complex protein 5|elongator]] tRNA&lt;sup&gt;Met.&lt;/sup&gt;. Moreover, they increase overall tRNA stability. Some studies have shown that the modifications of tRNA can be dynamic and adaptive to the changes of the environment. Examples include methylation of cytosine groups by tRNA methyltransferase [[TRM4 (gene)|(Trm4]]) in response to the depletion of nutrients in the body. The tRNA's cruciform structure is incredibly important to its overall function and such a complicated structure is maintained by post-transcriptional modifications. A primary example of this is the methylation of [[guanosine]] at junctions within the tRNA structure. These methylguanosine impact the overall tertiary structure by disrupting any potential canonical hydrogen bonding (hydrogen bonds that are conventional Watson-Crick base pairs), thus creating a loop at the core of the tRNA. Other modifications are integral for creating and maintaining the extreme bends in the structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Väre VY, Eruysal ER, Narendran A, Sarachan KL, Agris PF | title = Chemical and Conformational Diversity of Modified Nucleosides Affects tRNA Structure and Function | journal = Biomolecules | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 29 | date = March 2017 | pmid = 28300792 | doi = 10.3390/biom7010029 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Messenger RNA (mRNA) ===
[[Messenger RNA]] is the bridge between the genetic code and the resulting proteins, as it is what carries the necessary information that gets translated into proteins. Modifications to the actual, physical genetic code are likely to be deleterious; therefore, minor modifications, such as methylation, done to mRNA are preferable (nevertheless, modifications are still seen throughout the genome). The four major types of modifications done to mRNA are N7-methylguanine (at the [[5′ cap]]), [[N6-Methyladenosine|N&lt;sup href="International Standard Serial Number"&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-methyladenosine]], [[5-Methylcytosine|5-methylcytosine]], and [[2'-O-methylation|2′-O-methylation]]. The modification seen at the 5' cap perfectly demonstrates how modifications to mRNA can impact its function, as the 5' cap is necessary to initiate translation. Therefore, modifications, such as N7-methylguanine during RNA processing, to the 5' cap may effect the ability of the [[ribosome]] to initiate translation. It is important to note that not all modifications happening to the mRNA are epigenetic, some, like the N7-methylguanosine cap, are [[RNA editing]].

mRNA molecules demonstrate something known as "modification stoichiometry". Modification stoichiometry is when only a portion of transcripts have a specific modification at a particular modification site. Typically, under normal cell conditions, the modification stoichiometry is very low, there are a very few number of transcripts that have specific modifications. However, as cell conditions change, the fraction of modified transcripts can change as well.&lt;ref name="Lewis_2017"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lewis CJ, Pan T, Kalsotra A | title = RNA modifications and structures cooperate to guide RNA-protein interactions | journal = Nature Reviews. Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 202–210 | date = March 2017 | pmid = 28144031 | doi = 10.1038/nrm.2016.163 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with other types of RNA, modifications impact the overall structure of the mRNA. Altering the its structure may cause the mRNA to take different paths. For example, a normal transcript might be fated to be translated; however, the introduction of a modified base can disrupt its structure and send it down a different path, and that particular transcript may now be targeted for degradation.&lt;ref name="Lewis_2017" /&gt;

=== Short non-coding RNA (sncRNA) modifications ===
Modifications can also happen in short non-coding RNAs, including [[small nuclear RNA]] (snRNA) and [[microRNA]] (miRNA).&lt;ref name="Li_2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Li S, Mason CE | title = The pivotal regulatory landscape of RNA modifications | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | year = 2014 | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 127–50 | pmid = 24898039 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-genom-090413-025405 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wang_2014" /&gt; However, these modifications are less common than those in mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.&lt;ref name="Li_2014" /&gt;

==== Short nuclear RNA (snRNA) ====
Some ''trans-''spliced [[Small nuclear RNA|snRNA]]s have been observed to have a N&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,N&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,7-trimethylguanosine cap.&lt;ref name="Li_2014" /&gt; This particular modification to the guanosine cap is rare in snRNAs. [[Trans-splicing]] is a phenomenon in which exons from two different primary RNA transcripts are ligated together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bruzik JP, Van Doren K, Hirsh D, Steitz JA | title = Trans splicing involves a novel form of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles | journal = Nature | volume = 335 | issue = 6190 | pages = 559–62 | date = October 1988 | pmid = 2971142 | doi = 10.1038/335559a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These rare variants have been seen during development in ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C.elegans]]'' and are associated with [[polysome]]s.&lt;ref name="Li_2014" /&gt; How this modification is regulated in certain cell types and the exact function of this modification remains largely unknown, although it has been speculated that this modification may help define a special subset of trimethylguanosine-regulated RNAs.&lt;ref name="Li_2014" /&gt;

==== MicroRNA (miRNA) ====
Some [[MicroRNA|miRNA]]s in plants have been seen to contain [[2'-O-methylation]], a modification to the ribose sugar that is added by the [[methyltransferase]] HEN1. This modification is thought to protect the miRNA against [[polyuridylation]], which would result in its subsequent degradation.&lt;ref name="Wang_2014" /&gt;

In addition, pri-miRNAs have been shown to contain m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A. This reversible modification may affect their cellular localization and function during miRNA processing.&lt;ref name="Wang_2014" /&gt;

=== Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) ===
The family of long [[non-coding RNA]]s includes a variety of different kinds of RNA, including, but not limited to, [[circular RNA]] (circRNA), nuclear lncRNA, long intergenic non-coding RNA, and [[enhancer RNA]]. The development of [[next-generation sequencing]] has made the study of lncRNA more accessible (because lncRNA is not very common in the cell relative to other types of RNA).

Editing and modifications to lncRNA have demonstrated to result in changes in RNA expression and rate of mutation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilusz JE, Sunwoo H, Spector DL | title = Long noncoding RNAs: functional surprises from the RNA world | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 23 | issue = 13 | pages = 1494–504 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19571179 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1800909 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 5-methylcytosine (m&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;C), N&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-methyladenosine (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A), and pseudouridine are the three most common and most studied modifications occurring in lncRNA.&lt;ref name="Jacob_2017" /&gt; Modifications to the nucleotide structure are likely to impact the structure of lncRNAs and modulate their overall function. The study of the reversibility of these modifications is an active area of research. These modifications impact a variety of different qualities including the lncRNA's function and the initiation of translation. Modifications to lncRNAs have been demonstrated to impact where they localize within the cell and while complicated structures, such as the crucifix of tRNA, are not typically found in lncRNA, modifications may alter their structure and impact the overall function and pathway the lncRNA takes.&lt;ref name="Wang_2014" /&gt;

== Viral epitranscriptomics ==
Viral epitranscriptomics is the field that studies RNA modifications in viral transcripts that do not affect the sequence of the transcript but that are functionally relevant. So far, the studies have been focused on viral transcripts of mammalian [[virus]]es. Mammalian viral transcripts must function in a mammalian cell, so they must acquire the same epigenetic marks as the [[Host (biology)|host cell]]. For this, viruses make use of the numerous mRNA modifying enzymes found in the host cells.&lt;ref name="Pereira-Montecinos_2017" /&gt;

=== m6A in viral transcripts ===
The most widely described RNA modification in mammalian viruses is m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A, which was first identified in [[Orthomyxoviridae|Influenza virus]] mRNAs, in 1976.&lt;ref name="Peer_2017" /&gt; The epitranscriptomic analysis of viral transcripts has revealed that m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A levels in viral and cellular transcripts are similar. Nevertheless, in some viruses such as [[Adenoviridae|adenovirus-2]], m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A levels are higher in viral mRNAs.&lt;ref name="Pereira-Montecinos_2017" /&gt; As with cellular RNAs, m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A is predominantly added in the nucleus by METTL3, with the assistance of several cofactors such as METTL14, WTAP, KIAA1429 and RBM15/RMB15B.

Studies of the viral m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A mark have mostly been conducted with [[HIV]].&lt;ref name="Gonzales-van_Horn_2017" /&gt; Despite the high mutagenic rate of this virus, m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A sites have been evolutionarily conserved. This is due to the fact that m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A is involved in regulating multiple stages in the HIV life-cycle. In addition to the normal functions m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A has in pre-mRNA splicing, nuclear export, mRNA stability and translation; this mark also inhibits the recognition of viral transcripts by [[Toll-like receptor]]s and RIG-1 receptors. As a result, m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A positively influences viral replication.&lt;ref name="Kennedy_2017" /&gt; On the other hand, HIV also regulates the addition of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A mark in a number of cellular mRNAs. For instance, 56 cellular transcripts that only contain m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A during HIV infection have been identified. The effect this mark has on cellular transcripts during the course of the viral infection remains unknown.&lt;ref name="Pereira-Montecinos_2017" /&gt;

Even if m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A-marked viral transcripts are involved in regulating gene expression of a number of different viruses, the mechanisms by which this happens have not been identified. To date, three possible models have been proposed.&lt;ref name="Gonzales-van_Horn_2017" /&gt;

Although METTL3 and METTL14 are mostly localized in the nucleus, they can also be found in the cytoplasm, where they methylate the genomes and transcripts of cytoplasmic RNA viruses. As opposed to nuclear viruses, loss of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A on [[hepatitis C virus]] (HCV, a cytoplasmic RNA virus) increases the production of infectious HCV virions, which indicates that in this particular virus the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A mark has a negative effect on virus production. Nevertheless, in other cytoplasmic RNA viruses such as [[dengue virus]] and [[Yellow fever|yellow fever virus]], m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A sites have been selected for during evolution, suggesting that the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A mark is beneficial for these viruses.&lt;ref name="Kennedy_2017" /&gt;

Since m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A enhances viral replication, m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A can be used as a target for [[antiviral therapy]]. The major challenge is to target this mark in viral transcripts without causing major effects to the host cells, as normally occurring cellular m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A marks will also be depleted. The [[S-adenosylhomocysteine]] (SAC) hydrolase inhibitor 3-dezaadenosine (DAA) can be used as an antiviral drug, because it inhibits the addition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A.&lt;ref name="Kennedy_2017" /&gt; However, it is yet to be determined whether this drug has any off-target effects.&lt;ref name="Gonzales-van_Horn_2017" /&gt;
[[File:N6-2'-O-dimethyladenosine.jpg|thumb|N&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;,2-O-dimethyladenosine (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;)]]

=== Other viral transcript modifications ===
m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A is not the only RNA modification that can be found in viral RNAs. For instance, N&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;,2-O-dimethyladenosine (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;) can be found in influenza and [[Herpes simplex virus|herpes simplex virus type 1]], even though the effect this mark has on the life cycle of these viruses remains unknown. Another modification commonly found in [[coronavirus]]es, [[flavivirus]]es and [[Poxviridae|poxviruses]] (all of them are cytoplasmic viruses) is the 2'-O-methylation of ribose moieties. The addition of this mark is catalyzed by a viral methyltransferase. 2'-O-methylation binds to and inhibits Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR-7), which is involved in activating the production of [[Proinflammatory cytokine|inflammatory cytokines]]. Moreover, this modification enables viral RNAs to evade the antiviral actions of the [[IFIT proteins]], a family of [[interferon]]-induced proteins that limit viral replication.&lt;ref name="Gonzales-van_Horn_2017" /&gt;

== MODOMICS ==
MODOMICS is a comprehensive [[database]] that contains information about RNA modifications. MODOMICS provides the following information: the chemical structure of the modified RNAs, the RNA modifying pathways, the location of the modifications in the RNA sequences, the enzymes responsible for the modifications and [[Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry|liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry]](LC/MS) data of the modified RNAs. As of November 2017, the database contained 163 different RNA modifications, as well as 340 different enzymes and [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]] involved in the modifications. This database classifies RNA modifying pathways according to their starting point. The LC/MS data has been very useful in determining the specific mass of the modified RNAs, which facilitates the identification of the modification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Boccaletto P, Machnicka MA, Purta E, Piatkowski P, Baginski B, Wirecki TK, de Crécy-Lagard V, Ross R, Limbach PA, Kotter A, Helm M, Bujnicki JM | title = MODOMICS: a database of RNA modification pathways. 2017 update | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 46 | issue = D1 | pages = D303-D307 | date = January 2018 | pmid = 29106616 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkx1030 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8423">'''Ethanol precipitation''' is a method used to purify and/or concentrate [[RNA]], [[DNA]], and [[polysaccharide]]s such as [[pectin]] and [[xyloglucan]] from [[aqueous solutions]] by adding [[ethanol]] as an antisolvent.

== DNA precipitation ==
=== Theory ===
[[Image:Na+H2O.svg|thumb|right|The first [[solvation shell|hydration shell]] of a sodium ion dissolved in water]]
DNA is [[chemical polarity|polar]] due to its highly charged [[phosphate]] backbone. Its polarity makes it water-soluble (water is polar) according to the principle [[Solubility#Polarity|"like dissolves like"]].

Because of the high polarity of water, illustrated by its high [[dielectric constant]] of 80.1 (at 20 °C), electrostatic forces between [[Electric charge|charged particles]] are considerably lower in aqueous solution than they are in a [[vacuum]] or in air.

This relation is reflected in [[Coulomb's law]], which can be used to calculate the force acting on two charges &lt;math&gt;q_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q_2&lt;/math&gt; separated by a distance &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; by using the dielectric constant &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_r&lt;/math&gt; (also called relative static permittivity) of the medium in the denominator of the equation (&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_0&lt;/math&gt; is an [[electric constant]]):

&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_r\varepsilon_0} \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

At an atomic level, the reduction in the force acting on a charge results from water molecules forming a [[Solvation shell|hydration shell]] around it. This fact makes water a very good solvent for charged compounds like salts. Electric force which normally holds salt [[crystal]]s together by way of [[ionic bonds]] is weakened in the presence of water allowing ions to separate from the crystal and spread through solution.

The same mechanism operates in the case of negatively charged phosphate groups on a DNA backbone: even though positive ions are present in solution, the relatively weak net electrostatic force prevents them from forming stable ionic bonds with phosphates and [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitating]] out of solution.

[[Ethanol]] is much less polar than water, with a dielectric constant of 24.3 (at 25 °C). This means that adding ethanol to solution disrupts the screening of charges by water. If enough ethanol is added, the electrical attraction between phosphate groups and any positive ions present in solution becomes strong enough to form stable [[ionic bonds]] and DNA precipitation. This usually happens when ethanol composes over 64% of the solution. As the mechanism suggests, the solution has to contain positive ions for precipitation to occur; usually Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; plays this role

=== Practice ===
[[Image:Tabletop centrifuge.jpg|thumb|150px|A laboratory tabletop centrifuge]]
DNA is precipitated by first ensuring that the correct concentration of positive ions is present in solution (too much will result in a lot of salt co-precipitating with DNA, too little will result in incomplete DNA recovery) and then adding two to three volumes of at least 95% ethanol. Many protocols advise storing DNA at low temperature at this point, but there are also observation that it may not improve DNA recovery, and may even lower precipitation efficiency while using over-night incubation time.&lt;ref name="a1"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zeugin JA, Hartley JL |title=Ethanol Precipitation of DNA |journal=Focus |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=1–2 |year=1985 |url=http://www.invitrogen.com/etc/medialib/en/filelibrary/pdf/focus.Par.56415.File.dat/Focus%20Volume%207%20Issue%204.PDF |accessdate=2008-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="a2"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Crouse J, Amorese D |title=Ethanol Precipitation: Ammonium Acetate as an Alternative to Sodium Acetate |journal=Focus |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=3–5 |year=1987 |url=http://www.invitrogen.com/etc/medialib/en/filelibrary/pdf/focus.Par.34900.File.dat/Focus%20Voume%209%20Issue%202.pdf |accessdate=2008-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122123626/http://www.invitrogen.com/etc/medialib/en/filelibrary/pdf/focus.Par.34900.File.dat/Focus%20Voume%209%20Issue%202.pdf |archivedate=2009-11-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, good efficiency can be achieved at room temperature, but when possible degradation is taken into account, it is probably better to incubate DNA on wet ice. Optimal incubation time depends on the length and concentration of DNA. Smaller fragments and lower concentrations will require longer times to achieve acceptable recovery. For very small lengths and low concentrations over-night incubation is recommended. In such cases use of carriers like [[tRNA]], [[glycogen]] or linear [[polyacrylamide]] can greatly improve recovery.

During incubation DNA and some salts will precipitate from solution, in the next step this precipitate is collected by [[laboratory centrifuge|centrifugation]] in a microcentrifuge tube at high speeds (~12,000[[standard gravity|g]]). Time and speed of centrifugation has the biggest effect on DNA recovery rates. Again smaller fragments and higher dilutions require longer and faster centrifugation. Centrifugation can be done either at room temperature or in 4 °C or 0 °C.
During centrifugation precipitated DNA has to move through ethanol solution to the bottom of the tube, lower temperatures increase [[viscosity]] of the solution and larger volumes make the distance longer, so both those factors lower efficiency of this process requiring longer centrifugation for the same effect.&lt;ref name="a1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="a2" /&gt;
After centrifugation the supernatant solution is removed, leaving a ''pellet'' of crude DNA. Whether the pellet is visible depends on the amount of DNA and on its purity (dirtier pellets are easier to see) or the use of co-precipitants.

In the next step, 70% ethanol is added to the pellet, and it is gently mixed to break the pellet loose and wash it. This removes some of the salts present in the leftover supernatant and bound to DNA pellet making the final DNA cleaner. This suspension is centrifuged again to once again pellet DNA and the supernatant solution is removed. This step is repeated once.

Finally, the pellet is air-dried and the DNA is resuspended in water or other desired [[buffer solution|buffer]]. It is important not to over-dry the pellet as it may lead to [[denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturation]] of DNA and make it harder to resuspend.

[[Isopropanol]] can also be used instead of ethanol; the precipitation efficiency of the isopropanol is higher making one volume enough for precipitation. However, isopropanol is less volatile than ethanol and needs more time to air-dry in the final step. The pellet might also adhere less tightly to the tube when using isopropanol.&lt;ref name="a0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5975">The '''Faulkes Telescope Project''' (FTP) is supported by the  [[Dill Faulkes]] Educational Trust. It provides access to 1,500 hours of observing time on two 2-metre class telescopes located in Hawaii ([[Faulkes Telescope North]] in [[Hawaii]]) and Australia ([[Faulkes Telescope South]] in [[Australia]]). This time is dedicated to education and public outreach, mainly in the UK, but also for smaller, selected projects in [[Europe]] and the [[US]].  

FTP has operated a UK-wide educational programme since 2004, and currently works with science education projects across Europe and further afield (e.g. USA, Russia, Israel), including many EU-based science, maths and ICT programmes. FTP specialises in providing physics and maths education and outreach via astronomy and space science, utilising the unique access it can provide to research-grade facilities. The basic philosophy is to engage learners in “real science”, making them active participants in a range of astronomical research projects, ranging from observations of the solar system to distant galaxies. Teacher training (both face-to-face and online) is a core component of the FTP educational philosophy, and project staff have been involved in professional development work both in the UK and overseas, with teacher training days being held in Moscow, Santa Barbara, Munich, Lisbon, Paris and several other venues in Portugal and Spain.

FTP operates a broad range of educational programmes, with a strong emphasis on teacher training and engaging students with “real science”. A variety of research projects are currently being run on the FTs, with schools often participating in the role of data gatherers, particularly in long-term monitoring or short-term intensive studies or Target of Opportunity requests for transient objects (e.g. GRBs, supernovae, NEOs or X-ray systems in outburst).  

The project also provides extensive educational materials which can be accessed and downloaded free of charge from their educational resources website. These resources include astronomy video tutorials, online astronomy training, paper-based documents for use in the classroom, and pre-packaged data from the telescopes to use with the exercises detailed online.

==Robotic Telescopes==
The robotic telescopes used by the Faulkes Telescope Project are owned and operated by Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network (LCOGTN). Users must register for an account via FTP and, providing they meet the criteria for an account (as explained on the FTP website), the account details will be emailed out to the registered user. Students and teachers can then go online and book time on the telescope and run their own 29-minute-long real-time observational session on one of the telescopes,  remotely controlling it over the internet.  These telescopes are the largest robotic telescopes in the world available for UK schools to control in real time.

The project was the winner of the 2008 [[Sir Arthur Clarke Award]] in the category of Achievement in Education.

The Faulkes Telescope  Projects in cooperation with [[Hands-On Universe]] runs many student observing projects such as supernovae observations, asteroid observations, the Lifecycle of Stars project and Hickson Compact Group of Galaxies project. Details of these, and many more projects can be found on the Faulkes educational website.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7482">In [[evolutionary biology]], people often speak of the '''four Fs''' which are said to be the four basic and most primal drives ([[motivation]]s or [[instincts]]) that [[animal]]s (including humans) are [[evolutionarily]] [[adapted]] to have, follow, and achieve:&lt;!-- for a citation that animals have these four drives see those that describe or use the term "four drives" or its four terms --&gt; [[fight-or-flight response|''fighting'', ''fleeing'']], [[eating|''feeding'']] and [[reproduction|fornicating]].

The list of the four activities appears to have been first introduced in the late 1950s and early 1960s in articles by psychologist [[Karl H. Pribram]], with the fourth entry in the list sometimes being replaced by other terms such as "sex"&lt;ref name="Pribram60"&gt;{{cite article|title=A Review of Theory in Physiological Psychology|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|date=January 1960|volume=60|issue=1|pages=1&amp;ndash;40|last=Pribram|first=Karl H.|authorlink=Karl H. Pribram|doi=10.1146/annurev.ps.11.020160.000245|url=https://saltworks.stanford.edu/assets/sw906gh1421.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11,13}} or "mating and maternal behavior",&lt;ref name="Pribram58"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pribram|first=Karl H.|authorlink=Karl H.

Conventionally, the four Fs were described as adaptations which helped the organism to find food, avoid danger, defend its territory, et cetera. However, in his book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', [[Richard Dawkins]] argued that adaptive traits do not evolve to benefit individual organisms, but to benefit the passing on of genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/619142755|title=The evolution of culture|last=Linquist|first=Stefan Paul|date=|publisher=Ashgate|others=|year=2010|isbn=0754627616|location=Farnham|pages=|oclc=619142755}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Four Fs and vertebrates ==
In the case of [[vertebrate]]s, this list corresponds to the motivational behaviours that drive the activity in the [[hypothalamus]]. The hypothalamus responds to these motivations by regulating activity in the [[endocrine system]] to [[releasing hormone|release hormone]]s to alter the [[ethology|behaviour]] of the animal.&lt;ref name="Lambert11"&gt;{{cite article|last=Lambert|first=Kelly|title=A Tale of Two Rodents|journal=Scientific American Mind|year=2011|volume=22|pages=36&amp;ndash;43|doi=10.1038/scientificamericanmind0911-36|url=http://www.nature.com/scientificamericanmind/journal/v22/n4/full/scientificamericanmind0911-36.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; These hormones include [[epinephrine]] (adrenalin) to increase blood flow and heart rate for a sufficient fight-or-flight response,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/769803483|title=Marks' basic medical biochemistry : a clinical approach|last=Lieberman|first=Michael|date=2013|publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|others=Marks, Allan D., Peet, Alisa.|year=|isbn=9781608315727|edition=4th|location=Philadelphia|pages=|oclc=769803483}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[ghrelin]], which is commonly described as “the hunger hormone”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sakata|first=Ichiro|last2=Sakai|first2=Takafumi|date=2010|title=Ghrelin cells in the gastrointestinal tract|journal=International Journal of Peptides|volume=2010|doi=10.1155/2010/945056|issn=1687-9775|pmc=2925405|pmid=20798855}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to explore the influences of the hypothalamus as a drive on the four Fs, researchers lesioned the lateral areas of the hypothalamus of rats. This resulted in a reduction in the interest of eating (''feeding''). If these animals were not fed or cared for they starved to death, even when enough food was present around them. The influence of the hypothalamus is also clear when researchers overstimulated the hypothalamus. When the lateral areas of the hypothalamus were treated with [[Electrical brain stimulation|electrical brain stimulation (EBS)]], the animals would start eating uncontrollably, which resulted in gaining excess weight rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/776541087|title=Psychology: themes and variations|last=Weiten|first=Wayne|date=2012|publisher=Cengage/Wadsworth|year=|isbn=9781111354749|edition=9th|location=Belmont, Calif.|pages=|oclc=776541087}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/830351091|title=Fundamental neuroscience|last=Squire|first=Larry R.|date=|publisher=Elsevier/Academic Press|others=|year=2013|isbn=9780123858719|edition=4th|location=Amsterdam|pages=|oclc=830351091}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keesey|first=R.

The hypothalamus consists of clusters of highly similarly functioning nerve cells. These nerve cells operate so intimately that signals may get misinterpret.

Some head-shells are designed to allow variable weights to be attached. For example, the H4-S Stanton Head-shell comes with 2g and 4g screw-in weights. Extra weight can be useful to prevent skipping if the DJ is [[scratching]] the record.

==H-4 Bayonet Mount==
Most of them use a standard H-4 Bayonet Mount, which will fit all S shape tonearms. The bayonet has a standard barrel whose dimensions are 8 mm diameter and 12 mm length, with its four pins connected to the four colour-coded head-shell lead wires.

'''Hilton's law''', espoused by [[John Hilton (surgeon)|John Hilton]] in a series of medical lectures given in 1860–1862,&lt;ref&gt;Hilton, J. (1863). On Rest and Pain: a Course of Lectures on the Influence of Mechanical and Physiological Rest in the Treatment of Accidents and Surgical Diseases, and the Diagnostic Value of Pain, delivered at the Royal College of Surgeons of England in the years 1860, 1861, and 1862&lt;/ref&gt; is the observation that in the study of [[anatomy]], the  nerve supplying the muscles extending directly across and acting at a given joint not only supplies the muscle, but also innervates the joint and the skin overlying the muscle.&lt;ref name="BD Chaurasia"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Krishna|first1=Garg|title=BD Chaurasia's Human Anatomy (Regional and Applied Dissection and Clinical) Volume 2 - Lower limb, abdomen, and pelvis|date=2010|publisher=CBS Publishers and Distributors Pvt Ltd|location=India|isbn=978-81-239-1864-8|page=56|edition=Fifth|chapter= Front of the thigh (Chapter 3)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Keith L. et al. (2010) ''Clinically Oriented Anatomy'', 6th Ed, p.633&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the [[musculocutaneous nerve]] supplies the [[elbow|elbow joint]] of humans with pain and [[proprioception]] fibres. It also supplies  coracobrachialis, [[biceps brachii]], [[brachialis]], and the forearm skin close to the insertion of each of those muscles.
(The capsule and ligament receive an abundant sensory nerve supply. A sensory nerve supplyinvg a joint also supplies the muscles moving the joint and the skin overlying the insertions of these muscles, a fact that has been codified  as HILTON'S JOINT.)
Hilton's law arises as a result of the [[embryology|embryological]] development of humans (or indeed other animals). Hilton based his law upon his extensive anatomical knowledge and clinical experiences. As with most British surgeons of his day (1805–1878), he intensely studied anatomy.

The knee joint is supplied by branches from [[femoral nerve]], [[sciatic nerve]], and [[obturator nerve]] because all the three nerves are supplying the muscles moving the joint. These nerves not only innervate the muscles, but also the fibrous capsule, ligaments, and synovial membrane of the knee joint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joint - skeleton - Articular nerves|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/joint-skeleton/Articular-nerves#ref471052|publisher=Encyclopedia Brittanica|accessdate=19 February 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312205621/https://www.britannica.com/science/joint-skeleton/Articular-nerves|archivedate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extensions of the law==
Hilton's law is described above. Similar observations can be made, to extend the theory; often a nerve will supply ''both'' the muscles and skin relating to a particular joint. The observation often holds true in reverse - that is to say, a nerve that supplies skin or a muscle will often supply the applicable joint.

:''For information about the form of substance abuse known as ''huffing'', see [[inhalant]].  For the Transformers character, see [[Huffer (Transformers)]]. For the surname, see [[Huffer (surname)]]''

In [[aviation]], a '''huffer''' is an external engine that creates large volumes of pressurized air used to start large gas [[turbine]] [[jet engines]] on some types of [[aircraft]].

The huffer works by blowing compressed air via flexible hose to the aircraft's [[bleed air]] system.  From there, the air flows via a pilot controlled valve to the engine's starter motor.  The starter motor converts the energy of the moving air to rotational torque.  The starter motor is linked via shaft to the N2 or core of the engine and spins the compressor and first stage turbine. Once there is enough air flowing through the [[Gas compressor|compressor]] and the [[combustion chamber]] to light the engine, fuel in the form of vaporized [[kerosene]] starts flowing and an igniter similar to a [[spark plug]] ignites the fuel. Then fuel flow is increased to spin the engine up to its normal idle speed, at which point the engine is self-sustaining and no longer needs the support of the starter.

In some earlier jet engines, the air from the huffer acted directly on the compressor or turbine blades to cause them to spin without the need for the air starter motor.

Some aircraft turbine engines do not use compressed air to start, but instead are started using an electric starter motor. This is attached to the main turbine shaft and does the same job as the air starter motor. The application of the huffer is primarily seen when an aircraft's [[Auxiliary Power Unit]] is not working, or to military aircraft, many of which use a huffer to save on weight.

'''ISO 690''' is an [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] [[standardization|standard]] for [[Citation|bibliographic referencing]] in different kind of [[documents]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Bob |last=Stayton |date=September 2007 |chapter=Customizing bibliography output |chapterurl=http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/CustomBiblio.html |title=DocBook XSL: The Complete Guide |edition=4th |isbn=978-0-9741521-3-4 |publisher=Sagehill Enterprises |location=[[Santa Cruz, California]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:690:ed-3:v1:en|title=ISO 690:2010(en). Online Browsing Platform (OBP).|last=|first=|date=|website=www.iso.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes [[electronic documents]], and specifies the elements to be included in references to published documents, and the order in which the elements of the reference should be stated. Punctuation and style (output mask) are not part of the standard; it is a standard [[separation of presentation and content|for content more than for presentation]]. Thus, it influences a user's [[XML]] and [[XSL]], although not necessarily the [[CSS]].

ISO 690 covers references to published material in both print and non-print form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:690:ed-3:v1:en|title=International Standard.

Even though ISO 690:2010(E) generally suggests to place the date of publication after ''place'' and ''publisher'' (referred to as "production information"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=International Standard. ISO 690. Reference number ISO 690:2010(E). Information and documentation - Guidelines for bibliographic references and citations to information resources|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|editor-last=ISO 2010|edition=3|location=Geneva (Switzerland)|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;) it also hints to the [[Parenthetical referencing|Harvard system]] style (name-date system) and provides also various examples of its way of citation in the annex of ISO 690:2010(E).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=International Standard.

==Parts of the document==
Until 2010, ISO 690 appeared in two ISO documents:
* ISO 690:1987 (''Information and documentation - Bibliographic references - Content, form and structure'');
* ISO 690-2:1997 (''Information and documentation - Bibliographic references - Part 2: Electronic documents or parts thereof'')

==Examples of citation (ISO 690:1987)==

Basically, the application of older version of ISO standard is not a fault.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1646">The '''Indian National Chemistry Olympiad''' ('''INChO''' for short) is an [[Olympiad]] in [[Chemistry]] held in [[India]].

The theory part of the INChO examination is held in end-January/beginning February of every year. It is conducted by the [[Indian Association of Chemistry Teachers]]. School students (usually of standards 11, 12) first need to qualify the [[National Standard Examination in Chemistry]] (NSEC) held in November of the preceding year. Among the 30,000+ students who sit for the NSEC, only the top 1% are selected for the INChO.

About 35 students are selected from the written examination. A total of 30 students are selected from these to attend the Orientation-Cum-Selection-Camp (OCSC), chemistry, held at [[HBCSE]], Mumbai.

Most of the students qualifying the INChO are those completing their twelfth standard. However, there have been some cases of students qualifying INChO at the end of eleventh, or tenth standard itself.

[[File:Balancer with wine 3.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Balancing cart, a simple robotics system 1976. The cart contains a [[servo system]] which monitors the angle of the rod and moves the cart back and forth to keep it upright.]]

An '''inverted pendulum''' is a [[pendulum]] that has its [[center of mass]] above its [[Lever|pivot]] point.  It is [[unstable equilibrium|unstable]] and without additional help will fall over. It can be suspended stably in this inverted position by using a [[control system]] to monitor the angle of the pole and move the pivot point horizontally back under the center of mass when it starts to fall over, keeping it balanced.  The inverted pendulum is a classic problem in [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] and [[control theory]] and is used as a benchmark for testing control strategies.  It is often implemented with the pivot point mounted on a cart that can move horizontally under control of an electronic servo system as shown in the photo; this is called a '''cart and pole''' apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;C.A. Hamilton Union College Senior Project 1966&lt;/ref&gt; Most applications limit the pendulum to 1 [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degree of freedom]] by affixing the pole to an [[axis of rotation]]. Whereas a normal pendulum is stable when hanging downwards, an inverted pendulum is inherently unstable, and must be actively balanced in order to remain upright; this can be done either by applying a [[torque]] at the pivot point, by moving the pivot point horizontally as part of a [[feedback]] system, changing the rate of rotation of a mass mounted on the pendulum on an axis parallel to the pivot axis and thereby generating a net torque on the pendulum, or by oscillating the pivot point vertically. A simple demonstration of moving the pivot point in a feedback system is achieved by balancing an upturned broomstick on the end of one's finger.  

A second type of inverted pendulum is a [[tiltmeter]] for tall structures, which consists of a wire anchored to the bottom of the foundation and attached to a float in a pool of oil at the top of the structure that has devices for measuring movement of the neutral position of the float away from its original position.

== Overview ==
A pendulum with its bob hanging directly below the support [[Lever|pivot]] is at a [[Mechanical equilibrium|stable equilibrium]] point; there is no torque on the pendulum so it will remain motionless, and if displaced from this position will experience a restoring torque which returns it toward the equilibrium position.  A pendulum with its bob in an inverted position, supported on a rigid rod directly above the pivot, 180° from its stable equilibrium position, is at an [[unstable equilibrium]] point.  At this point again there is no torque on the pendulum, but the slightest displacement away from this position will cause a gravitation torque on the pendulum which will accelerate it away from equilibrium, and it will fall over.  
  
In order to stabilize a pendulum in this inverted position, a [[feedback controller|feedback control system]] can be used, which monitors the pendulum's angle and moves the position of the pivot point sideways when the pendulum starts to fall over, to keep it balanced.   The inverted pendulum is a classic problem in [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] and [[control theory]] and is widely used as a benchmark for testing control algorithms ([[PID controller]]s, [[state space representation]], [[neural networks]], [[fuzzy control]], [[genetic algorithm]]s, etc.). Variations on this problem include multiple links, allowing the motion of the cart to be commanded while maintaining the pendulum, and balancing the cart-pendulum system on a see-saw. The inverted pendulum is related to rocket or missile guidance, where the center of gravity is located behind the center of drag causing aerodynamic instability.&lt;ref&gt;http://exploration.grc.nasa.gov/education/rocket/rktstab.html&lt;/ref&gt; The understanding of a similar problem can be shown by simple robotics in the form of a balancing cart. Balancing an upturned broomstick on the end of one's finger is a simple demonstration, and the problem is solved by self-balancing [[personal transporter]]s such as the [[Segway PT]], the [[self-balancing scooter|self-balancing hoverboard]] and the [[self-balancing unicycle]].

Another way that an inverted pendulum may be stabilized, without any feedback or control mechanism, is by oscillating the pivot rapidly up and down.  This is called [[Kapitza's pendulum]].  If the [[oscillation]] is sufficiently strong (in terms of its acceleration and amplitude) then the inverted pendulum  can recover from perturbations in a strikingly counterintuitive manner. If the driving point moves in [[simple harmonic motion]],  the pendulum's motion is described by the [[Mathieu equation]].

==Equations of motion==

The [[equations of motion]] of inverted pendulums are dependent on what constraints are placed on the motion of the pendulum.  Inverted pendulums can be created in various configurations resulting in a number of Equations of Motion describing the behavior of the pendulum.

===Stationary pivot point===
In a configuration where the pivot point of the pendulum is fixed in space, the equation of motion is similar to that for an [[Pendulum (mathematics)|uninverted pendulum]].  The equation of motion below assumes no friction or any other resistance to movement, a rigid massless rod, and the restriction to [[2-dimensional]] movement.

:&lt;math&gt;\ddot \theta - {g \over \ell} \sin \theta = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\ddot \theta &lt;/math&gt; is the [[angular acceleration]] of the pendulum, &lt;math&gt;g &lt;/math&gt; is the [[standard gravity]] on the surface of the Earth, &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; is the length of the pendulum, and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the angular displacement measured from the equilibrium position.

When added to both sides, it will have the same sign as the angular acceleration term:

:&lt;math&gt;\ddot \theta = {g \over \ell} \sin \theta&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the inverted pendulum will accelerate away from the vertical unstable equilibrium in the direction initially displaced, and the acceleration is inversely proportional to the length. Tall pendulums fall more slowly than short ones.

'''Derivation using torque and moment of inertia:'''
[[Image:cart-pendulum.svg|thumb|300px| A schematic drawing of the inverted pendulum on a cart. The rod is considered massless. The mass of the cart and the point mass at the end of the rod are denoted by M and m. The rod has a length l.]]

The pendulum is assumed to consist of a point mass, of mass &lt;math&gt;m &lt;/math&gt;, affixed to the end of a massless rigid rod, of length &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;, attached to a pivot point at the end opposite the point mass.

The net [[torque]] of the system must equal the [[moment of inertia]] times the angular acceleration:
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau}_{\mathrm{net}}=I \ddot \theta&lt;/math&gt;
The torque due to gravity providing the net torque:
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau}_{\mathrm{net}}= m g \ell \sin \theta\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
Where &lt;math&gt; \theta\ &lt;/math&gt; is the angle measured from the inverted equilibrium position.

The resulting equation:
:&lt;math&gt; I \ddot \theta= m g \ell \sin \theta\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The moment of inertia for a point mass:
:&lt;math&gt;I = m R^2&lt;/math&gt;
In the case of the inverted pendulum the radius is the length of the rod, &lt;math&gt; \ell &lt;/math&gt;.

Substituting in &lt;math&gt;I = m \ell ^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; m \ell ^2 \ddot \theta= m g \ell \sin \theta\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Mass and &lt;math&gt;\ell^2&lt;/math&gt; is divided from each side resulting in:
:&lt;math&gt;\ddot \theta = {g \over \ell} \sin \theta&lt;/math&gt;

===Inverted pendulum on a cart===
An inverted pendulum on a cart consists of a mass &lt;math&gt; m &lt;/math&gt; at the top of a pole of length &lt;math&gt; \ell &lt;/math&gt; pivoted on a horizontally moving base as shown in the adjacent image.  The cart is restricted to [[linear motion]] and is subject to forces resulting in or hindering motion.

===Essentials of stabilization===
The essentials of stabilizing the inverted pendulum can be summarized qualitatively in three steps.
[[Image:Inverted Pendulum control essentials.JPG|thumb|600px| The simple stabilizing control system used on the cart with wine glass above.]]

1.	If the tilt angle &lt;math&gt; \theta &lt;/math&gt; is to the right, the cart must accelerate to the right and vice versa.

2.	The position of the cart &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; relative to track center is stabilized by slightly modulating the null angle (the angle error that the control system tries to null) by the position of the cart, that is, null angle &lt;math&gt; = \theta + k x &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt; is small.  This makes the pole want to lean slightly toward track center and stabilize at track center where the tilt angle is exactly vertical.  Any offset in the tilt sensor or track slope that would otherwise cause instability translates into a stable position offset.  A further added offset gives position control.

3.	A normal pendulum subject to a moving pivot point such as a load lifted by a crane, has a peaked response at the pendulum radian frequency of &lt;math&gt; \omega_p = \sqrt {g/\ell} &lt;/math&gt;.  To prevent uncontrolled swinging, the frequency spectrum of the pivot motion should be suppressed near &lt;math&gt; \omega_p &lt;/math&gt;.  The inverted pendulum requires the same suppression filter to achieve stability.

Note that, as a consequence of the null angle modulation strategy, the position feedback is positive, that is, a sudden command to move right will produce an initial cart motion to the left followed by a move right to rebalance the pendulum.  The interaction of the pendulum instability and the positive position feedback instability to produce a stable system is a feature that makes the mathematical analysis an interesting and challenging problem.

=== Lagrange's Equations ===
The equations of motion can be derived using  [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrange's equations]].  We refer to the drawing to the right where &lt;math&gt;\theta(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the angle of the pendulum of length &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the vertical direction and the acting forces are gravity and an external force ''F'' in the x-direction. Define &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; to be the position of the cart. The [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] &lt;math&gt;L = T - V&lt;/math&gt; of the system is:

:&lt;math&gt;
L = \frac{1}{2} M v_1^2  + \frac{1}{2} m v_2^2 - m g \ell\cos\theta 
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;v_1&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the cart and &lt;math&gt;v_2&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the point mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;math&gt;v_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_2&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed in terms of x and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; by writing the velocity as the first derivative of the position;
:&lt;math&gt;
v_1^2=\dot x^2
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
v_2^2=\left({\frac{d}{dt}}{\left(x- \ell\sin\theta\right)}\right)^2 + \left({\frac{d}{dt}}{\left( \ell\cos\theta \right)}\right)^2
&lt;/math&gt;
Simplifying the expression for &lt;math&gt;v_2&lt;/math&gt; leads to:
:&lt;math&gt;
v_2^2= \dot x^2 -2 \ell \dot x \dot \theta\cos \theta + \ell^2\dot \theta^2

&lt;/math&gt;

The Lagrangian is now given by:
:&lt;math&gt;
L = \frac{1}{2} \left(M+m \right ) \dot x^2 -m \ell \dot x \dot\theta\cos\theta + \frac{1}{2} m \ell^2 \dot \theta^2-m g \ell\cos \theta
&lt;/math&gt;
and the equations of motion are:
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}{\partial{L}\over \partial{\dot x}} - {\partial{L}\over \partial x} = F
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}{\partial{L}\over \partial{\dot \theta}} - {\partial{L}\over \partial \theta} = 0
&lt;/math&gt;
substituting &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; in these equations and simplifying leads to the equations that describe the motion of the inverted pendulum:
:&lt;math&gt;
\left ( M + m \right ) \ddot x - m \ell \ddot \theta \cos \theta + m \ell \dot \theta^2 \sin \theta = F
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\ell \ddot \theta - g \sin \theta = \ddot x \cos \theta
&lt;/math&gt;
These equations are nonlinear, but since the goal of a control system would be to keep the pendulum upright the equations can be linearized around &lt;math&gt;\theta \approx 0&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Newton's Second Law===

Oftentimes it is beneficial to use [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's Second Law]] instead of [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrange's equations]] because Newton's equations give the reaction forces at the joint between the pendulum and the cart. These equations give rise to two equations for each body one in the x-direction and the other in the y-direction. The equations of motion of the cart are shown below where the LHS is the sum of the forces on the body and the RHS is the acceleration.

:&lt;math&gt;
F-R_x = M \ddot x
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
F_N - R_y - M g = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

In the equations above &lt;math&gt;R_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_y&lt;/math&gt; are reaction forces at the joint. &lt;math&gt;F_N&lt;/math&gt; is the normal force applied to the cart. This second equation only depends on the vertical reaction force thus the equation can be used to solve for the normal force. The first equation can be used to solve for the horizontal reaction force. In order to complete the equations of motion, the acceleration of the point mass attached to the pendulum must be computed. The position of the point mass can be given in inertial coordinates as

:&lt;math&gt;
\vec r_P = (x-\ell \sin \theta) \hat x_I + \ell \cos \theta \hat y_I
&lt;/math&gt;

Taking two derivatives yields the acceleration vector in the inertial reference frame.

:&lt;math&gt;
\vec a_{P/I} = (\ddot x + \ell \dot \theta^2 \sin \theta  - \ell \ddot \theta \cos \theta ) \hat x_I + (-\ell \dot \theta^2 \cos \theta  - \ell \ddot \theta \sin \theta) \hat y_I
&lt;/math&gt;

Then, using Newton's second law, two equations can be written in the x-direction and the y-direction. Note that the reaction forces are positive as applied to the pendulum and negative when applied to the cart. This is due to Newton's Third Law.

:&lt;math&gt;
R_x = m(\ddot x + \ell \dot \theta^2 \sin \theta  - \ell \ddot \theta \cos \theta )
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
R_y - m g = m (-\ell \dot \theta^2 \cos \theta  - \ell \ddot \theta \sin \theta)
&lt;/math&gt;

The first equation allows yet another way to compute the horizontal reaction force in the event the applied force &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is not known. The second equation can be used to solve for the vertical reaction force. The first equation of motion is derived by substituting &lt;math&gt;F-R_x = M \ddot x&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;R_x = m(\ddot x + \ell \dot \theta^2 \sin \theta  - \ell \ddot \theta \cos \theta )&lt;/math&gt; which yields

:&lt;math&gt;
\left (M+m \right) \ddot x  - m \ell \ddot \theta \cos \theta  + m \ell \dot \theta^2 \sin \theta  = F
&lt;/math&gt;

By inspection this equation is identical to the result from Lagrange's Method. In order to obtain the second equation the pendulum equation of motion must be dotted with a unit vector which runs perpendicular to the pendulum at all times and is typically noted as the x-coordinate of the body frame. In inertial coordinates this vector can be written using a simple 2-D coordinate transformation

:&lt;math&gt; 
\hat x_B = \cos \theta \hat x_I + \sin \theta \hat y_I
&lt;/math&gt;

The pendulum equation of motion written in vector form is &lt;math&gt;\sum \vec F = m \vec a_{P/I}&lt;/math&gt;. Dotting &lt;math&gt;\hat x_B&lt;/math&gt; with both sides yields the following on the LHS (note that a transpose is the same as a dot product)

:&lt;math&gt;
(\hat x_B)^T\sum \vec F = (\hat x_B)^T (R_x \hat x_I + R_y \hat y_I - m g \hat y_I) = (\hat x_B)^T(R_p \hat y_B - m g \hat y_I) = -m g \sin \theta
&lt;/math&gt;

In the above equation the relationship between body frame components of the reaction forces and inertial frame components of reaction forces is used. The assumption that the bar connecting the point mass to the cart is massless implies that this bar cannot transfer any load perpendicular to the bar. Thus, the inertial frame components of the reaction forces can be written simply as &lt;math&gt;R_p \hat y_B&lt;/math&gt; which signifies that the bar can only transfer loads along the axis of the bar itself. This gives rise to another equation which can be used to solve for the tension in the rod itself

:&lt;math&gt;
R_p = \sqrt{ R_x^2 + R_y^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

The RHS of the equation is computed similarly by dotting &lt;math&gt;\hat x_B&lt;/math&gt; with the acceleration of the pendulum. The result (after some simplification) is shown below.

:&lt;math&gt;
m(\hat x_B)^T(\vec a_{P/I}) = m(\ddot x \cos \theta - \ell \ddot \theta)
&lt;/math&gt;

Combining the LHS with the RHS and dividing through by m yields

:&lt;math&gt;
\ell \ddot \theta - g \sin \theta = \ddot x \cos \theta
&lt;/math&gt;

which again is identical to the result of Lagrange's method. The benefit of using Newton's method is that all reaction forces are revealed to ensure that nothing will be damaged.
[[File:Kapitza pendulum.svg|thumb|upright=0.7|Drawing showing how a Kapitza pendulum can be constructed: a motor rotates a crank at a high speed, the crank vibrates a lever arm up and down, which the pendulum is attached to with a pivot.]]

==Kapitza's pendulum==
{{main|Kapitza's pendulum}}

An inverted pendulum in which the pivot is oscillated rapidly up and down can be stable in the inverted position.  This is called [[Kapitza's pendulum]], after Russian physicist [[Pyotr Kapitza]] who first analysed it.  The equation of motion for a pendulum connected to a massless, oscillating base is derived the same way as with the pendulum on the cart. The position of the point mass is now given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\left( -\ell \sin \theta , y + \ell \cos \theta    \right)&lt;/math&gt;
and the velocity is found by taking the first derivative of the position:
:&lt;math&gt;v^2=\dot y^2-2 \ell \dot y \dot \theta \sin \theta  + \ell^2\dot \theta ^2.&lt;/math&gt;[[Image:Inverted pendulum oscillatory base.svg|thumb|right|500px|Plots for the inverted pendulum on an oscillatory base. The first plot shows the response of the pendulum on a slow oscillation, the second the response on a fast oscillation]]

The [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] for this system can be written as:
:&lt;math&gt;
 L = \frac{1 }{2} m \left ( \dot y^2-2 \ell \dot y \dot \theta \sin \theta  + \ell^2\dot \theta ^2   \right) - m g \left( y + \ell \cos \theta  \right )
&lt;/math&gt;
and the equation of motion follows from:
:&lt;math&gt;
{\mathrm{d} \over \mathrm{d}t}{\partial{L}\over \partial{\dot \theta}} - {\partial{L}\over \partial \theta} = 0
&lt;/math&gt;
resulting in:
:&lt;math&gt;
\ell \ddot \theta - \ddot y \sin \theta = g \sin \theta.
&lt;/math&gt;
If ''y'' represents a [[simple harmonic motion]], &lt;math&gt;y = A \sin \omega t&lt;/math&gt;, the following [[differential equation]] is:
:&lt;math&gt;
\ddot \theta - {g \over \ell} \sin \theta = -{A \over \ell} \omega^2 \sin \omega t \sin \theta.
&lt;/math&gt;

This equation does not have elementary closed-form solutions, but can be explored in a variety of ways.  It is closely approximated by the [[Mathieu equation]], for instance, when the amplitude of oscillations are small. Analyses show that the pendulum stays upright for fast oscillations. The first plot shows that when &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is a slow oscillation, the pendulum quickly falls over when disturbed from the upright position. The angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; exceeds 90° after a short time, which means the pendulum has fallen on the ground. If  &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is a fast oscillation the pendulum can be kept stable around the vertical position.  The second plot shows that when disturbed from the vertical position, the pendulum now starts an oscillation around the vertical position (&lt;math&gt;\theta = 0&lt;/math&gt;). The deviation from the vertical position stays small, and the pendulum doesn't fall over.

==Types of inverted pendulums==
Achieving stability of an inverted pendulum has become a common engineering challenge for researchers.&lt;ref&gt;http://robotics.ee.uwa.edu.au/theses/2003-Balance-Ooi.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; There are different variations of the inverted pendulum on a cart ranging from a rod on a cart to a multiple segmented inverted pendulum on a cart. Another variation places the inverted pendulum's rod or segmented rod on the end of a rotating assembly. In both, (the cart and rotating system) the inverted pendulum can only fall in a plane. The inverted pendulums in these projects can either be required to only maintain balance after an equilibrium position is achieved or be able to achieve equilibrium by itself. Another platform is a two-wheeled balancing inverted pendulum. The two wheeled platform has the ability to spin on the spot offering a great deal of maneuverability.&lt;ref&gt;http://csuchico-dspace.calstate.edu/bitstream/handle/10211.4/145/4%2022%2009%20Jose%20Miranda.pdf?sequence=1&lt;/ref&gt; Yet another variation balances on a single point.  A [[spinning top]], a [[unicycle]], or an inverted pendulum atop a spherical ball all balance on a single point. As derived above the inverted pendulum can also be achieved by having a vertically oscillating base.

==Examples of inverted pendulums==
Arguably the most prevalent example of a stabilized inverted pendulum is a [[human being]].  A person standing upright acts as an inverted pendulum with his feet as the pivot, and without constant small muscular adjustments would fall over.  The human nervous system contains an unconscious [[feedback]] [[control system]], the [[sense of balance]] or [[righting reflex]], that uses [[proprioceptive]] input from the eyes, muscles and joints, and orientation input from the [[vestibular system]] consisting of the three [[semicircular canals]] in the [[inner ear]], and two [[otolith]] organs, to make continual small adjustments to the skeletal muscles to keep us standing upright.  Walking, running, or balancing on one leg puts additional demands on this system.  Certain diseases and alcohol or drug intoxication can interfere with this reflex, causing [[dizziness]] and [[disequilibrium (medicine)|disequilibration]], an inability to stand upright.  A [[field sobriety test]] used by police to test drivers for the influence of alcohol or drugs, tests this reflex for impairment.     

Some simple examples include balancing brooms or meter sticks by hand. 
 
The inverted pendulum has been employed in various devices and trying to balance an inverted pendulum presents a unique engineering problem for researchers.&lt;ref&gt;http://csuchico-dspace.calstate.edu/bitstream/handle/10211.4/145/4%2022%2009%20Jose%20Miranda.pdf?sequence=1&lt;/ref&gt; The inverted pendulum was a central component in the design of several early [[seismometer]]s due to its inherent instability resulting in a measurable response to any disturbance.&lt;ref&gt;https://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/topics/seismology/history/part12.php&lt;/ref&gt;

The inverted pendulum model has been used in some recent [[personal transporter]]s, such as the two-wheeled [[self-balancing scooter]]s and single-wheeled [[electric unicycle]]s. These devices are kinematically unstable and use an electronic feedback [[servo system]] to keep them upright.

'''Islamic ethics''' (أخلاق إسلامية), defined as "good character," historically took shape gradually from the 7th century and was finally established by the 11th century.&lt;ref name="EoI_Akhlaq" /&gt; It was eventually shaped as a successful amalgamation of the [[Qur'an]]ic teachings, the teachings of the Prophet [[Muhammad]], the [[precedent]]s of [[Ulema|Islamic jurists]] (see [[Sharia]] and [[Fiqh]]), the [[Jahiliyyah|pre-Islamic]] [[Arab]]ian tradition, and non-Arabic elements (including [[Persia]]n and [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] ideas) embedded in or integrated with a generally [[Islam]]ic structure.&lt;ref name="EoI_Akhlaq" /&gt; Although Muhammad's preaching produced a "radical change in [[moral value]]s based on the sanctions of the new religion and the present religion, and fear of God and of the Last Judgment", the tribal practice of Arabs did not completely die out. Later [[Muslim scholars]] expanded the religious ethic of the Qur'an and [[Hadith]] in immense detail.&lt;ref name="EoI_Akhlaq"&gt;{{harvnb|Bearman|Bianquis|Bosworth|van Donzel|2009|loc=Akhlaq}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Foundational motives==
The foundational source in the gradual codification of Islamic ethics was the Muslim understanding and interpretations of the Qur'an and practices of Muhammad. Its meaning has always been in context of active submission to God (Arabic: [[Allah]]), performed by the community in unison. The motive force in Islamic ethics is the notion that every human being is called to "command the good and forbid the [[evil]]" in all spheres of life. Muslims understand the role of Muhammad as attempting to facilitate this submission. Another key factor in the field of Islamic ethics is the belief that mankind has been [[fitrah|granted the faculty to discern]] God's will and to abide by it. This faculty most crucially involves reflecting over the meaning of existence. Therefore, regardless of their environment, humans are believed to have a [[moral responsibility]] to submit to God's will and to follow Islam (as demonstrated in the Qur'an, {{Quran-usc-range|7|172|173}}).&lt;ref name="EncEthic"&gt;{{harvnb|Becker|Becker|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This natural inclination is, according to the Qur'an, subverted by mankind's focus on material success: such focus first presents itself as a need for basic survival or security, but then tends to manifest into a desire to become distinguished amongst one's peers. Ultimately, the focus on [[materialism]], according to the Islamic texts, hampers with the innate reflection as described above, resulting in a state of ''[[jahiliyya]]'' or "heedlessness."&lt;ref name="EncEthic"/&gt;
Muslims believe that Muhammad, like other [[prophets in Islam]], was sent by God to remind human beings of their moral responsibility, and challenge those ideas in society which opposed submission to God. According to Kelsay, this challenge was directed against five main characteristics of pre-Islamic Arabia:&lt;ref name="EncEthic"/&gt;

# The division of Arabs into varying tribes (based upon blood and kinship). This categorization was confronted by the ideal of a unified community based upon [[taqwa|Islamic piety]], an "''[[ummah]]'';"
# The acceptance of the worship of a multitude of deities besides Allah - a view challenged by strict [[Tawhid|Islamic monotheism]], which dictates that Allah has no partner in worship nor any equal;
# The trait of ''muruwwa'' ([[Masculine|manliness]]), which Islam discouraged, instead emphasizing on the traits of humility and piety;
# The focus on achieving fame or establishing a legacy, which was replaced by the concept that mankind would be called to account before God on the [[Qiyamah|day of resurrection]];
# The reverence of and compliance with ancestral traditions, a practice challenged by Islam — which instead assigned primacy to submitting to God and following revelation.

These changes lay in the reorientation of society as regards to identity and life of the Muslim belief, [[world view]], and the hierarchy of values. From the viewpoint of subsequent generations, this caused a great transformation in the society and moral order of life in the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. For Muhammad, although [[pre-Islamic Arabia]] exemplified "heedlessness," it was not entirely without merit. Muhammad approved and exhorted certain aspects of the Arab pre-Islamic tradition, such as the care for one’s near kin, for widows, orphans, and others in need and for the establishment of [[justice]]. However, these values would be re-ordered in importance and placed in the context of strict [[monotheism]].&lt;ref name="EncEthic"/&gt;

==Moral commandments==

In the 17th chapter, "Al-Israa" ("The Night Journey"), verses {{Quran-usc-range|17|22|39}}, the [[Qur'an]] provides a set of moral stipulations which are "among the (precepts of) wisdom, which thy Lord has revealed to thee" that can be reasonably categorised as ten in number. According to S. A. Nigosian, Professor of religious studies at [[University of Toronto|the University of Toronto]], these resemble the Ten Commandments in the Bible and "represents the fullest statement of the code of behavior every Muslim must follow".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nigosian|2004|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these verses are not regarded by Islamic scholars as set apart from any other moral stipulations in the Qur'an, nor are they regarded as a substitute, replacement, or abrogation of some other set of commandments as found in the previous revelations.  
# '''Worship only God:''' Do not make with Allah another god; lest you will sit disgraced and forsaken. ({{cite quran|17|22|style=ref}})
# '''Be kind, honourable and humble to one's parents:''' And your Lord has decreed that you not worship except Him alone, and to be good to the parents. Whether one or both of them reach old age [while] with you, say not to them [so much as], a word of disrespect, and do not repel them but speak to them a noble word. ({{cite quran|17|23|style=ref}}) And lower to them the wing of humility out of mercy and say, "My Lord, have mercy upon them as they brought me up [when I was] small." ({{cite quran|17|24|style=ref}})
# '''Be neither miserly nor wasteful in one's expenditure:''' And give the relative his right, and [also] the poor and the traveler, and do not spend wastefully. ({{cite quran|17|26|style=ref}}) Indeed, the spendthrifts are brothers of the devil, and the devil is, to his lord, ungrateful. ({{cite quran|17|27|style=ref}}) And if you [must] turn away from the needy awaiting mercy from your Lord which you expect, then speak to them a gentle word. ({{cite quran|17|28|style=ref}}) And do not make your hand [as] chained to your neck or extend it to its utmost reach, so that you [thereby] become blamed and insolvent. ({{cite quran|17|29|style=ref}})
# '''Do not engage in 'mercy killings' for fear of starvation:''' And do not kill your children for fear of poverty. We provide for them and for you. Indeed, their killing is ever a great sin. ({{cite quran|17|31|style=ref}})
# '''Do not commit adultery:''' And do not approach unlawful sexual intercourse. Indeed, it is an immorality and an evil way. ({{cite quran|17|32|style=ref}})
# '''Do not kill unjustly:''' And do not kill the soul which Allah has forbidden, except by right. And whoever is killed unjustly - We have given his heir authority, but let him not exceed limits in [the matter of] taking life. Indeed, he has been supported [by the law]. ({{cite quran|17|33|style=ref}})
# '''Care for orphaned children:''' And do not approach the property of an orphan, except in the way that is best, until he reaches maturity...({{cite quran|17|34|style=ref}})
# '''Keep one's promises:''' ...fulfill (every) engagement [i.e. promise/covenant], for (every) engagement will be questioned (on the Day of Reckoning). ({{cite quran|17|34|style=ref}})
# '''Be honest and fair in one's interactions:''' And give full measure when you measure, and weigh with an even balance. That is the best [way] and best in result. ({{cite quran|17|35|style=ref}})
# '''Do not be arrogant in one's claims or beliefs:''' And do not pursue that of which you have no knowledge. Indeed, the hearing, the sight and the heart - all those will be questioned. ({{cite quran|17|36|style=ref}}) And do not walk upon the earth exultantly. Indeed, you will never tear the earth [apart], and you will never reach the mountains in height. ({{cite quran|17|37|style=ref}})

Many Muslim theologians see the [[Golden rule#Islam|'''Golden Rule''']] implicit in some verses of the Qur'an and in the [[Hadith]]. The Golden Rule was agreed 1993 also by Muslims as a central unconditional ethical norm in the [[Declaration Toward a Global Ethic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|PWR|1993|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early reforms under Islam==
{{main|Early reforms under Islam}}

Many reforms in human rights took place under [[Islam]] between 610 and 661, including the period of [[Muhammad]]'s  mission and the rule of the [[Rashidun|four immediate successors]] who established the [[Rashidun Empire|Rashidun Caliphate]]. Historians generally agree that Muhammad preached against what he saw as the social evils of his day,&lt;ref&gt;Alexander (1998), p.452&lt;/ref&gt; and that Islamic social reforms in areas such as [[social security]], family structure, [[slavery]], and the rights of women and [[Ethnic minority|ethnic minorities]] improved on what was present in existing [[Arab]] society at the time.&lt;ref name="EoI_Akhlaq"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LewisNYRB"&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watt (1974), p.234&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson (2004) p.21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haddad, Esposito (1998), p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gallagher|2007|p=293}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, according to [[Bernard Lewis]], Islam "from the first denounced [[Aristocracy|aristocratic]] privilege, rejected [[hierarchy]], and adopted a formula of the career open to the talents."&lt;ref name="LewisNYRB"/&gt; [[John Esposito]] sees Muhammad as a reformer who condemned practices of the pagan Arabs such as [[female infanticide]], [[exploitation of labour|exploitation]] of the poor, [[usury]], murder, false contracts, and theft.&lt;ref name="Espos"&gt;Esposito (2005) p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; Bernard Lewis believes that the egalitarian nature of Islam "represented a very considerable advance on the practice of both the [[Greco-Roman]] and the [[Persian Empire|ancient Persian]] world."&lt;ref name="LewisNYRB"/&gt;

The [[Constitution of Medina]], also known as the ''Charter of Medina'', was drafted by Muhammad in 622. It constituted a formal agreement between Muhammad and all of the significant tribes and families of Yathrib (later known as [[Medina]]), including [[Muslim]]s, [[Jew]]s, and [[pagan]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Firestone (1999) p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bearman|Bianquis|Bosworth|van Donzel|2009|loc=Muhammad}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Watt|1956}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Serjeant|1964|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The document was drawn up with the explicit concern of bringing to an end the bitter intertribal fighting between the clans of the Aws ([[Banu Aus|Aus]]) and [[Khazraj]] within Medina.  To this effect it instituted a number of rights and responsibilities for the Muslim, Jewish and pagan communities of Medina bringing them within the fold of one community-the [[Ummah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Serjeant|1978|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Constitution established the security of the community, [[freedom of religion]], the role of Medina as a [[haram]] or sacred place (barring all violence and weapons), the [[Women's rights|security of women]], stable tribal relations within Medina, a tax system for supporting the community in time of conflict, parameters for exogenous political alliances, a system for granting protection of individuals, a judicial system for resolving disputes, and also regulated the paying of [[Blood money (term)|blood-wite]] (the payment between families or tribes for the slaying of an individual in lieu of [[Eye for an eye|lex talionis]]).

Muhammad made it the responsibility of the Islamic government to provide food and clothing, on a reasonable basis, to [[Prisoners of war|captives]], regardless of their religion. If the prisoners were in the custody of a person, then the responsibility was on the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Maududi (1967), Introduction of Ad-Dahr, "Period of revelation", pg. 159&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis states that Islam brought two major changes to ancient slavery which were to have far-reaching consequences. "One of these was the presumption of freedom; the other, the ban on the enslavement of free persons except in strictly defined circumstances," Lewis continues. The position of the Arabian slave was "enormously improved": the Arabian slave "was now no longer merely a chattel but was also a human being with a certain religious and hence a [[social status]] and with certain quasi-legal rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Esposito states that reforms in [[women's rights]] affected marriage, divorce, and [[inheritance]].&lt;ref name="Espos" /&gt; Women were not accorded with such legal status in other cultures, including the West, until centuries later.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Lindsay. p.6224&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Oxford Dictionary of Islam'' states that the general improvement of the status of Arab women included prohibition of female infanticide and recognizing women's full personhood.&lt;ref name="OxfordDicT"&gt;Esposito (2004), p. 339&lt;/ref&gt; "The [[dowry]], previously regarded as a bride-price paid to the father, became a nuptial gift retained by the wife as part of her personal property."&lt;ref name="Espos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="majid"&gt;Khadduri (1978)&lt;/ref&gt; Under Islamic law, marriage was no longer viewed as a "status" but rather as a "contract", in which the woman's consent was imperative.&lt;ref name="Espos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OxfordDicT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="majid"/&gt; "Women were given inheritance rights in a [[patriarchal society]] that had previously restricted inheritance to male relatives."&lt;ref name="Espos"/&gt; [[Annemarie Schimmel]] states that "compared to the pre-Islamic position of women, Islamic legislation meant an enormous progress; the woman has the right, at least according to the letter of the law, to administer the wealth she has brought into the family or has earned by her own work."&lt;ref name = "Schimmel"&gt;Schimmel (1992) p.65&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Montgomery Watt]] states that Muhammad, in the historical context of his time, can be seen as a figure who testified on behalf of women's rights and improved things considerably. Watt explains: "At the time Islam began, the conditions of women were terrible - they had no [[Property|right to own property]], were supposed to be the property of the man, and if the man died everything went to his sons." Muhammad, however, by "instituting rights of property ownership, inheritance, education and divorce, gave women certain basic safeguards."&lt;ref&gt;Maan, McIntosh (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Haddad and Esposito state that "Muhammad granted women rights and privileges in the sphere of [[Family|family life]], marriage, education, and economic endeavors, rights that help improve women's status in society."&lt;ref&gt;Haddad, Esposito (1998) p.163&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[Robert Bellah]] (''Beyond belief'') argues that Islam in its seventh-century origins was, for its time and place, "remarkably modern...in the high degree of commitment, involvement, and participation expected from the rank-and-file members of the community."  This because, he argues, that Islam emphasized on the equality of all Muslims, where leadership positions were open to all. Dale Eickelman writes that Bellah suggests "the early Islamic community placed a particular value on individuals, as opposed to collective or group responsibility."&lt;ref&gt;McAuliffe (2005) vol. 5, pp. 66-76. "Social Sciences and the Qur’an"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmentalism==
{{see also|Muslim Agricultural Revolution}}

Perhaps due to resource scarcity in most Islamic nations, there was an emphasis on limited (and some claim also sustainable) use of [[natural capital]], i.e. producing land. Traditions of [[haram (site)]] and [[hima (environmental protection)|hima]], an Arabic term meaning "protected place", and early [[urban planning]] were expressions of strong social obligations to stay within [[carrying capacity]] and to preserve the [[natural environment]] as an obligation of [[Caliph|khalifa]] or "stewardship".&lt;ref name="Haq"&gt;{{harvnb|Haq|2001|pp=111–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Muslims established themselves in [[Madinah]], Muhammad surveyed the
natural resources in the region—the wadis (riverbeds); the rich, black volcanic soil; the high rangelands—and decreed that they be preserved and set aside as a hima.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Verde|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hadith]]s on agriculture and [[environmental philosophy]] were compiled in the "Book of Agriculture" of the ''[[Sahih Bukhari]]'', which included the following saying:&lt;ref name="Haq" /&gt;

{{quote|text=There is none amongst the believers who plants a tree, or sows a seed, and then a bird, or a person, or an animal eats thereof, but it is regarded as having given a charitable gift [for which there is great recompense].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sahih Bukhari]]'' 3:513&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Several such statements concerning the environment are also found in the Qur'an, such as the following:&lt;ref name="Haq" /&gt;

{{quote|text=And there is no animal in the earth nor bird that flies with its two wings, but that they are communities like yourselves.{{cite quran|6|38}}}}

The earliest known treatises dealing with environmentalism and [[environmental science]], especially pollution, were [[Islamic medicine|Arabic medical treatises]] written by [[al-Kindi]], [[Qusta ibn Luqa]], [[al-Razi]], [[Ibn Al-Jazzar]], [[al-Tamimi]], [[al-Masihi]], [[Avicenna]], [[Ali ibn Ridwan]], [[Ibn Jumay]], [[Isaac Israeli ben Solomon]], [[Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi (medieval writer)|Abd-el-latif]], Ibn al-Quff, and [[Ibn al-Nafis]]. Their works covered a number of subjects related to pollution such as air pollution, [[water pollution]], [[soil contamination]], [[municipal solid waste]] mishandling, and [[environmental impact assessment]]s of certain localities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gari|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Córdoba, Spain|Cordoba]], [[Al-Andalus]] also had the first [[waste container]]s and [[waste disposal]] facilities for [[litter]] collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Scott|1904}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Artz|1980|pp=148–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;([[cf.]] [http://www.1001inventions.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=main.viewSection&amp;intSectionID=441 References] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229042135/http://www.1001inventions.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=main.viewSection&amp;intSectionID=441 |date=2008-02-29 }}, 1001 Inventions)&lt;/ref&gt;

"In order to preserve the natural environment by not polluting, plant trees, support environmentally-friendly goods and products, Muslims must rectify themselves through simplicity, contentment, resisting endless desires, and then remembering God as well as following His commands".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=The Holy Quran and the Environment |url=http://www.rissc.jo/index.php/english-publications.html |year=2010 |chapter=The Relationship between The Environment and Man. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818180319/http://www.rissc.jo/index.php/english-publications.html |archivedate=2013-08-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
Many medieval Muslim thinkers pursued [[humanistic]] and [[Rationalism|rational]] approaches in discourses regarding [[values]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goodman|2003|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Democratic participation===
{{main|Islamic democracy}}
{{further|Shura|Ijma}}

In the early Islamic [[Caliphate]], the head of state, the Caliph, had a position based on the notion of a successor to Muhammad's political authority, who, according to Sunnis, were ideally elected by the people or their representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martin|2004|pp=116–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Rashidun]] Caliphs, later Caliphates during the [[Islamic Golden Age]] had a lesser degree of democratic participation, but since "no one was superior to anyone else except on the basis of piety and virtue" in Islam, and following the example of Muhammad, later Islamic rulers often held [[public consultation]]s with the people in their affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weeramantry|1997|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Electing or appointing a Caliph

[[Fred Donner]], in his book ''The Early Islamic Conquests'' (1981), argues that the standard Arabian practice during the early Caliphates was for the prominent men of a kinship group, or tribe, to gather after a leader's death and elect a leader from amongst themselves, although there was no specified procedure for this [[shura]], or consultative assembly. Candidates  were usually from the same lineage as the deceased leader, but they were not necessarily his sons. Capable men who would lead well were preferred over an ineffectual direct heir, as there was no basis in the majority Sunni view that the head of state or governor should be chosen based on lineage alone. Al-Mawardi has written that the caliph should be [[Quraysh (tribe)|Qurayshi]]. [[Al-Baqillani|Abu Bakr Al-Baqillani]] has said that the leader of the Muslims simply should be from the majority. [[Abu Hanifa an-Nu‘man]] also wrote that the leader must come from the majority.&lt;ref name=2muslims&gt;{{harvnb|Al-Ghamdy|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Majlis ash-Shura

Traditional Sunni Islamic lawyers agree that ''[[shura]]'', loosely translated as 'consultation of the people', is a function of the caliphate. The [[Majlis-ash-Shura|Majlis ash-Shura]] advise the caliph. The importance of this is premised by the following verses of the Qur'an:{{or|date=October 2010}}

{{quote|text={{cite quran|42|38|expand=no|quote=...those who answer the call of their Lord and establish the prayer, and who conduct their affairs by Shura. [are loved by God]}}}}
{{quote|text={{cite quran|3|159|expand=no|quote=...consult them (the people) in their affairs. Then when you have taken a decision (from them), put your trust in Allah}}}}

The [[majlis]] is also the means to elect a new caliph. Al-Mawardi has written that members of the majlis should satisfy three conditions: they must be just, they must have enough knowledge to distinguish a good caliph from a bad one, and must have sufficient wisdom and judgment to select the best caliph. Al-Mawardi also said in emergencies when there is no caliphate and no majlis, the people themselves should create a majlis, select a list of candidates for caliph, then the majlis should select from the list of candidates.&lt;ref name=2muslims/&gt; Some modern interpretations of the role of the Majlis ash-Shura include those by Islamist author [[Sayyid Qutb]] and by [[Taqiuddin al-Nabhani]], the founder of a transnational political movement devoted to the revival of the Caliphate. In an analysis of the shura chapter of the Qur'an, Qutb argued Islam requires only that the ruler consult with at least some of the ruled (usually the elite), within the general context of God-made laws that the ruler must execute.  Taqiuddin al-Nabhani, writes that Shura is important and part of "the ruling structure" of the Islamic caliphate, "but not one of its pillars," and may be neglected without the Caliphate's rule becoming unIslamic.  Non-Muslims may serve in the majlis, though they may not vote or serve as an official.

===Religious pluralism===
Islamic legal framework included [[religious pluralism]]. Classical [[Sharia]], the [[religious law]]s and courts of  [[Christianity|Christian]]s, [[Jews]] and [[Hinduism|Hindus]], were usually accommodated within the Islamic legal framework, as seen in the early Caliphate, [[Al-Andalus]], [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|Indian subcontinent]], and the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman Millet]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weeramantry|1997|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sachedina|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Non-Muslims were allowed to engage in religious practices that was usually forbidden by Islamic law. In a notable example, [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] practice of [[incest]]uous "self-marriage" where a man could marry his mother, sister or daughter, was to be tolerated according to [[Ibn Qayyim]] (1292–1350). He based his opinion on the precedent that the prophet Muhammad, who did not forbid such self-marriages among Zoroastrians despite coming in contact with them and having knowledge of their practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jackson|2005|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious minorities were also free to do whatever they wished in their own homes, provided they did not publicly engage in illicit sexual activity in ways that could threaten public morals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jackson|2005|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freedom of expression===
Citizens of the Rashidun Caliphate were also free to criticize the [[Rashidun]] Caliphs, as the [[rule of law]] was binding on the [[head of state]] just as much as it was for the citizens. In a notable incident, when [[Umar]] tried to investigate a disturbance, by entering a home without permission, he was criticized for his behavior; he was also later criticized for the judgement he gave in that case.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bontekoe|Stepaniants|1997|pp=250–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also numerous other situations where citizens insulted Caliph Umar, but he tolerated the insults and simply provided them explanations. Similar situations also occurred during the time of Caliph [[Ali]]. For example, there was an occasion when he was giving a [[Khutbah|sermon]] and a [[Kharijites|Kharijite]] rudely interrupted him with insulting language. Though he was urged to punish the interrupter, Ali declined on the grounds that his "right to freedom of speech must not be imperilled."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bontekoe|Stepaniants|1997|p=251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad]] quotes a letter by a cousin of Caliph [[al-Ma'mun]], in which he gives permission to a Christian he was attempting to convert to speak his mind freely, as evidence that in Islam even religious controversies were not exempt from open discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ahmad|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to George Makdisi and Hugh Goddard, "the idea of [[academic freedom]]" in universities was "modelled on Islamic custom" as practiced in the medieval [[Madrasah]] system from the 9th century. Islamic influence was "certainly discernible in the foundation of the first deliberately planned university" in Europe, the [[University of Naples Federico II]] founded by [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]] in 1224.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goddard|2000|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter written by the fourth Rashidun Caliph and first cousin of the prophet Muhammad, [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] to his governor of Egypt, [[Malik al-Ashtar]]. The Caliph advises his governor on dealings with the poor masses thus:

===Human rights===
{{see also|Sharia|Early reforms under Islam|Caliphate|Islamic Jurisprudence: An International Perspective|Women in Islam|Islamic feminism}}

In the field of human rights, early [[Ulema|Islamic jurists]] introduced a number of advanced legal concepts which anticipated similar modern concepts in the field. These included the notions of the [[charitable trust]] and the [[Trust law|trusteeship]] of property; the notion of brotherhood and [[social solidarity]]; the notions of human [[dignity]] and the [[dignity of labour]]; the notion of an ideal law; the condemnation of [[anti-social behavior]]; the [[presumption of innocence]]; the notion of "bidding unto good" (assistance to those in distress); and the notions of [[sharing]], [[Duty of care|caring]], [[universalism]], fair [[industrial relations]], fair contract, commercial [[integrity]], freedom from [[usury]], [[women's rights]], [[privacy]], [[abuse]] of rights, [[juristic person]]ality, [[individual freedom]], [[equality before the law]], [[Legal aid|legal representation]], non-[[Ex post facto law|retroactivity]], supremacy of the law, [[judicial independence]], judicial [[impartiality]], limited [[sovereignty]], [[Toleration|tolerance]], and democratic participation. Many of these concepts were adopted in [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]] through contacts with [[Islamic Spain]] and the [[Emirate of Sicily]], and through the [[Crusades]] and the [[Latin translations of the 12th century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weeramantry|1997|pp=129–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|reason=1.

For neutral point of view, this credit claim to Islam must be balanced by a summary of dispute.|date=July 2013}}

The concept of [[inalienable rights]] was found in early Islamic law and jurisprudence, which denied a ruler "the right to take away from his subjects certain rights which inhere in his or her person as a human being." Islamic rulers could not take away certain rights from their subjects on the basis that "they become rights by [[reason]] of the fact that they are given to a subject by a law and from a source which no ruler can question or alter."&lt;ref name="Weeramantry132,135"&gt;{{harvnb|Weeramantry|1997|pp=132, 135}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that [[John Locke]]'s formulation of inalienable rights and conditional rulership, which were present in Islamic law centuries earlier, may have also been influenced by Islamic law, through his attendance of lectures given by [[Edward Pococke]], a professor of [[Islamic studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weeramantry|1997|pp=8, 135, 139–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Islamic law recognized two sets of human rights. In addition to the category of [[civil and political rights]] (covered in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]), Islamic law also recognized an additional category: [[social rights|social]], economic and [[cultural rights]]. This latter category was not recognized in the [[Western law|Western legal]] tradition until the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weeramantry|1997|pp=7, 135}}&lt;/ref&gt; The right of [[privacy]], which was not recognized in Western legal traditions until modern times, was recognized in Islamic law since the beginning of Islam.&lt;ref name="Weeramantry136-7"&gt;{{harvnb|Weeramantry|1997|pp=136–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of women's rights, women generally had more legal rights under Islamic law than they did under Western legal systems until the 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Badawi|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, "French married women, unlike their Muslim sisters, suffered from restrictions on their legal capacity which were removed only in 1965."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Badr|Mayer|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noah Feldman, a [[Harvard University]] law professor, notes:

{{quote|text=As for sexism, the common law long denied married women any property rights or indeed legal personality apart from their husbands. When the British applied their law to Muslims in place of Shariah, as they did in some colonies, the result was to strip married women of the property that Islamic law had always granted them — hardly progress toward equality of the sexes.&lt;ref name=Feldman/&gt;}}

In the ''[[North Carolina Law Review]]'' journal, Professor John Makdisi of the [[University of North Carolina School of Law]] writes in "The Islamic Origins of the Common Law" article:

{{quote|text=[T]he manner in which an act was qualified as morally good or bad in the spiritual domain of Islamic religion was quite different from the manner in which that same act was qualified as legally valid or invalid in the temporal domain of Islamic law. Islamic law was secular, not canonical... Thus, it was a system focused on ensuring that an individual received justice, not that one be a good person.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Makdisi|1999|p=1704}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Count Leon Ostorog, a French jurist, wrote the following on classical Islamic law in 1927:

{{quote|text=Those Eastern thinkers of the ninth century laid down, on the basis of their theology, the principle of the Rights of Man, in those very terms, comprehending the rights of individual liberty, and of inviolability of person and property; described the supreme power in Islam, or Califate, as based on a contract, implying conditions of capacity and performance, and subject to cancellation if the conditions under the contract were not fulfilled; elaborated a Law of War of which the humane, chivalrous prescriptions would have put to the blush certain belligerents in World War I; expounded a doctrine of toleration of non-Moslem creeds so liberal that our West had to wait a thousand years before seeing equivalent principles adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weeramantry|1997|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some scholars have suggested that the idea of "a charter defining the duties of a sovereign toward his subjects, as well as subjects toward the sovereign", which led to the "genesis of European legal structures" and the development of the ''[[Magna Carta]]'', may have been "brought back by Crusaders who were influenced by what they had learned in the [[Levant]] about the governing system" established by [[Saladin]]. It has also been suggested that "much of the West’s understanding of liberalism in law, economics and society has roots in medieval Islam."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sullivan|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another influence of Islamic law on European law was the [[presumption of innocence]], which was introduced to Europe by King [[Louis IX of France]] soon after he returned from [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] during the [[Crusades]]. Prior to this, European legal procedure consisted of either [[trial by combat]] or [[trial by ordeal]]. In contrast, Islamic law was based on the presumption of innocence from its beginning, as declared by the Caliph [[Umar]] in the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boisard|1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other freedoms and rights recognized in the Islamic legal system based on the Qur'an since the 7th century, but not recognized in the Western world until much later, include "the rights to know, to choose belief and behaviour, to read and write, the right to power, and even the right to choose government."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Splichal|2002|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Rule of law

Islamic jurists anticipated the concept of the [[rule of law]], the equal subjection of all classes to the ordinary law of the land, where no person is above the law and where officials and private citizens are under a [[duty]] to obey the same law. A [[Qadi]] (Islamic judge) was also not allowed to discriminate on the grounds of religion, [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[Human skin color|colour]], [[kinship]] or [[prejudice]]. There were also a number of cases where [[Caliph]]s had to appear before judges as they prepared to take their verdict.&lt;ref name="Weeramantry132,135" /&gt; The following [[hadith]] established the principle of rule of law in relation to [[nepotism]] and accountability:&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 56, Number 681&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=Narrated ‘Aisha: The people of Quraish worried about the lady from Bani Makhzum who had committed theft. They asked, "Who will intercede for her with Allah's Apostle?" Some said, "No one dare to do so except Usama bin Zaid the beloved one to Allah's Apostle." When Usama spoke about that to Allah's Apostle Allah's Apostle said: "Do you try to intercede for somebody in a case connected with Allah’s Prescribed Punishments?" Then he got up and delivered a sermon saying, "What destroyed the nations preceding you, was that if a noble amongst them stole, they would forgive him, and if a poor person amongst them stole, they would inflict Allah's Legal punishment on him. By Allah, if Fatima, the daughter of Muhammad (my daughter) stole, I would cut off her hand."}}

Various Islamic lawyers do however place multiple conditions, and stipulations e.g. the poor cannot be penalised for stealing out of poverty, before executing such a law, making it very difficult to reach such a stage. It is well known during a time of drought in the [[Rashidun Empire|Rashidun caliphate]] period, capital punishments were suspended until the effects of the drought passed.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

According to Noah Feldman, a law professor at [[Harvard University]], the legal scholars and jurists who once upheld the rule of law were replaced by a law governed by the state due to the [[Codification (law)|codification]] of Sharia by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the early 19th century:&lt;ref name=Feldman&gt;{{harvnb|Feldman|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=How the scholars lost their exalted status as keepers of the law is a complex story, but it can be summed up in the adage that partial reforms are sometimes worse than none at all. In the early 19th century, the Ottoman empire responded to military setbacks with an internal reform movement. The most important reform was the attempt to codify Shariah. This Westernizing process, foreign to the Islamic legal tradition, sought to transform Shariah from a body of doctrines and principles to be discovered by the human efforts of the scholars into a set of rules that could be looked up in a book.}}

{{quote|text=Once the law existed in codified form, however, the law itself was able to replace the scholars as the source of authority. Codification took from the scholars their all-important claim to have the final say over the content of the law and transferred that power to the state.}}

;Accountability of rulers

Sunni Islamic lawyers have commented on when it is permissible to disobey, [[Impeachment|impeach]] or remove rulers in the Caliphate. This is usually when the rulers are not meeting public responsibilities obliged upon them under Islam. Al-Mawardi said that if the rulers meet their Islamic responsibilities to the public, the people must obey their laws, but if they become either unjust or severely ineffective then the Caliph or ruler must be impeached via the [[Majlis-ash-Shura|Majlis ash-Shura]]. Similarly Al-Baghdadi believed that if the rulers do not uphold [[justice]], the ummah via the majlis should give warning to them, and if unheeded then the Caliph can be impeached. [[Al-Juwayni]] argued that Islam is the goal of the ummah, so any ruler that deviates from this goal must be impeached. Al-Ghazali believed that [[oppression]] by a caliph is enough for impeachment. Rather than just relying on impeachment, [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani]] obliged [[rebellion]] upon the people if the caliph began to act with no regard for Islamic law. Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani said that to ignore such a situation is ''[[haraam]]'', and those who cannot revolt inside the caliphate should launch a struggle from outside. Al-Asqalani used two [[ayah]]s from the Qur'an to justify this:

{{quote|text={{cite quran|33|67|end=68|expand=no|quote=...And they (the sinners on qiyama) will say, 'Our Lord! We obeyed our leaders and our chiefs, and they misled us from the right path. Our Lord! Give them (the leaders) double the punishment you give us and curse them with a very great curse'...}}}}

Islamic lawyers commented that when the rulers refuse to step down via successful impeachment through the Majlis, becoming dictators through the support of a corrupt army, if the majority agree they have the option to launch a revolution against them. Many noted that this option is only exercised after factoring in the potential cost of life.&lt;ref name=2muslims/&gt;

;Right of revolution

According to scholar [[Bernard Lewis]], the [[Qur'an and Sunnah]] have several points to make on governance regarding the [[right of revolution]] in Islam:

{{quote|text=The Quran, for example, makes it clear that there is a duty of obedience: "Obey God, obey the Prophet, obey those who hold authority over you." And this is elaborated in a number of sayings attributed to Muhammad. But there are also sayings that put strict limits on the duty of obedience. Two dicta attributed to the Prophet and universally accepted as authentic are indicative. One says, "there is no obedience in sin"; in other words, if the ruler orders something contrary to the divine law, not only is there no duty of obedience, but there is a duty of disobedience. This is more than the right of revolution that appears in Western political thought. It is a duty of revolution, or at least of disobedience and opposition to authority. The other pronouncement, "do not obey a creature against his creator," again clearly limits the authority of the ruler, whatever form of ruler that may be.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Medical ethics==
{{main|Bimaristan}}

The ethical standards of Muslim physicians was first laid down in the 9th century by [[Ishaq ibn 'Ali al-Ruhawi]], who wrote the ''Adab al-Tabib'' (''Conduct of a Physician''), the first treatist dedicated to [[medical ethics]]. He regarded physicians as "guardians of souls and bodies", and wrote twenty chapters on various topics related to medical ethics, including:&lt;ref name=Ethics&gt;[http://www.muslimheritage.com/topics/default.cfm?ArticleID=570 Islamic Science, the Scholar and Ethics], Foundation for Science Technology and Civilisation.&lt;/ref&gt;
* What the physician must avoid and beware of
* The manners of [[visitor]]s
* The care of [[Cure|remedies]] by the physician
* The [[dignity]] of the medical [[profession]]
* The [[Test (assessment)|examination]] of physicians
* The removal of corruption among physicians

Because Islam views itself as a total system governing all areas, Islamic medical ethics view the patient as a whole. Classical texts speak more about "health", than "illness", showing an emphasis on prevention rather than cure.&lt;ref name=Paladin/&gt;

===Drugs===
The earliest known [[Prohibition (drugs)|prohibition]] of illegal drugs occurred under [[Sharia|Islamic law]], which prohibited the use of [[Hashish]], a preparation of [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], as a [[recreational drug]]. Classical [[Ulema|jurists]] in medieval [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]], however, accepted the use of the Hashish drug for medicinal and therapeutic purposes, and agreed that its "medical use, even if it leads to mental derangement, remains exempt" from punishment. In the 14th century, the Islamic scholar [[Az-Zarkashi]] spoke of "the permissibility of its use for medical purposes if it is established that it is beneficial."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mathre|1997|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Mary Lynn Mathre, with "this legal distinction between the [[intoxicant]] and the medical uses of cannabis, medieval [[Kalam|Muslim theologians]] were far ahead of present-day [[American law]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mathre|1997|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical peer review===

The first documented description of a [[peer review]] process is found in the ''Ethics of the Physician'' by [[Ishaq ibn 'Ali al-Ruhawi]] (854–931) of al-Raha, [[Syria]], where the notes of a practising [[Islamic medicine|Islamic physician]] were reviewed by peers and the physician could face a lawsuit from a maltreated patient if the reviews were negative.&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Spier|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Al Kawi|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neuroethics===
{{main|Islamic psychology}}
Islamic [[neuroethics]] and [[neurotheology]] hold a sympathetic attitude towards the mentally ill, as exemplified in [[An-Nisa|Sura 4]]:5 of the Qur'an:&lt;ref name=Paladin&gt;{{harvnb|Paladin|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=Do not give your property which God assigned you to manage to the insane: but feed and cloth the insane with this property and tell splendid words to him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Qur'an]], [[An-Nisa|Sura 4]]:5&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This Quranic verse summarized Islam's attitudes towards the mentally ill, who were considered unfit to manage property but must be treated [[humane]]ly and be kept under care by a [[Legal guardian|guardian]], according to [[Sharia|Islamic law]].&lt;ref name=Paladin/&gt; This positive neuroethical understanding of [[mental health]] consequently led to the establishment of the first [[psychiatric hospital]]s in the medieval Islamic world from the 8th century,&lt;ref name=Dening-57&gt;{{harvnb|Youssef|Youssef|Dening|1996|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an early scientific understanding of [[neuroscience]] and [[psychology]] by medieval [[Islamic medicine|Muslim physicians]] and psychologists, who discovered that mental disorders are caused by [[Abnormality (behavior)|dysfunctions]] in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Youssef|Youssef|Dening|1996|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military ethics==
{{main|Islamic military jurisprudence}}

The early Islamic treatises on [[international law]] from the 9th century onwards covered the application of Islamic ethics, [[Islamic economic jurisprudence]] and [[Islamic military jurisprudence]] to international law,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelsay|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were concerned with a number of modern international law topics, including the [[law of treaties]]; the treatment of diplomats, [[hostage]]s, [[refugee]]s and [[prisoners of war]]; the [[right of asylum]]; [[Laws of war|conduct on the battlefield]]; protection of women, children and [[non-combatant]] civilians; contracts across the lines of [[battle]]; the use of [[poison]]ous weapons; and devastation of enemy territory.&lt;ref name=Weeramantry&gt;{{harvnb|Weeramantry|1997|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Islamic legal principles of international law were mainly based on Qur'an and the [[Sunnah]] of Muhammad, who gave various injunctions to his forces and adopted practices toward the conduct of war. The most important of these were summarized by Muhammad's [[caliph|successor]] and [[Sahaba|close companion]], [[Abu Bakr]], in the form of ten rules for the Muslim army:&lt;ref name=Zuhur&gt;{{harvnb|Aboul-Enein|Zuhur|2004|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=Stop, O people, that I may give you ten rules for your guidance in the battlefield. Do not commit treachery or deviate from the right path. You must not mutilate dead bodies. Neither kill a child, nor a woman, nor an aged man. Bring no harm to the trees, nor burn them with fire, especially those which are fruitful. Slay not any of the enemy's flock, save for your food. You are likely to pass by people who have devoted their lives to monastic services; leave them alone.&lt;ref name=Zuhur/&gt;}}

===Prisoners of war===
{{main|Prisoners of war in Islam}}

After Sultan [[al-Kamil]] defeated the [[Franks]] during the [[Crusades]], Oliverus Scholasticus praised the Islamic [[laws of war]], commenting on how al-Kamil supplied the defeated Frankish army with food:&lt;ref name=Weeramantry/&gt;

{{quote|text=Who could doubt that such goodness, friendship and charity come from God? Men whose parents, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, had died in agony at our hands, whose lands we took, whom we drove naked from their homes, revived us with their own food when we were dying of hunger and showered us with kindness even when we were in their power.&lt;ref name="Weeramantry136-7" /&gt;}}

==Peace and justice==
{{main|Peace In Islamic Thought}}

As in other [[Abrahamic faith|Abrahamic]] religions, peace is a basic concept of [[Islam]]. The [[Arabic language|Arabic]] term "Islam" itself (إسلام) is usually translated as "submission"; submission of desires to the will of God. It comes from the term ''aslama'', which means "to surrender" or "resign oneself".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Islam | encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam Online | author=L. Gardet, J. Jomier}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lane|p=1413}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arabic word ''[[S-L-M|salaam]]'' (سلام) ("peace") has the same [[S-L-M|root]] as the word ''Islam''.&lt;ref name="Harper"&gt;{{harvnb|Harper|2001|loc=Islam}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One Islamic interpretation is that individual personal peace is attained by utterly submitting to [[Allah]]. The greeting "[[S-L-M|Salaam alaykum]]", favoured by [[Muslims]], has the literal meaning "Peace be with you".&lt;ref name="Harper" /&gt; Muhammad is reported to have said once, "Mankind are the dependents, or slaves of God, and the most beloved of them to God are those who are the most excellent to His dependents." "Not one of you believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself." Great Muslim scholars of prophetic tradition such as [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani]] and Sharafuddin al [[Al-Nawawi|Nawawi]] have said&lt;ref&gt;[[Fath al-Bari]] and sharh [[sahih bukhari]] by Imam Al Nawawi&lt;/ref&gt; that the words "his brother" mean any person irrespective of faith.

==Welfare==
{{main|Bayt al-mal}}

The concepts of [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] and pension were introduced in early Islamic law as forms of ''[[Zakat]]'' (charity), one of the [[Five Pillars of Islam]], since the time of the [[Abbasid]] [[caliph]] [[Al-Mansur]] in the 8th century. The taxes (including ''Zakat'' and ''[[Jizya]]'') collected in the [[treasury]] of an Islamic government was used to provide income for the needy, including the [[Poverty|poor]], [[Old age|elderly]], [[orphan]]s, [[widow]]s, and the [[Disability|disabled]]. According to the Islamic jurist [[Al-Ghazali]] (Algazel, 1058–1111), the government was also expected to store up food supplies in every region in case a [[disaster]] or [[famine]] occurs. The [[Caliphate]] was thus one of the earliest [[welfare state]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Crone|2005|pp=308–309}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hamid|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 9th century, funds from the treasury were also used towards the ''[[Waqf]]'' ([[charitable trust]]s), often for the purpose of building of [[Madrassah]]s and [[Bimaristan]] hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Crone|2005|pp=309–310, 312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal welfare===
{{See also|Islam and animals}}

Concern for the treatment of animals can be found in the Qur'an and in the teachings of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad, which inspired debates over [[animal rights]] by later medieval Muslim scholars. The 10th-century work, "''Disputes Between Animals and Man''", part of the [[Epistles of the Brethren of Purity]], has been considered a classic in this regard. Inspired by the [[Ayah|Qur'anic verse]]: "all the creatures that crawl on the earth and those that fly with their wings are communities like yourselves" (6:38), the [[Shafi'i]] jurist [['Izz al-Din Ibn 'Abd al-Salam al-Sulami]] (d. 1262) formulated the first full-fledged charter of the rights of livestock and animals in his legal treatise ''Rules for Judgement in the Cases of Living Beings'' (''Qawa'id al-ahkam fi masalih al-anam'') which was based on the stories and sayings of Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sardar|2011|p=270}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coward|1995|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bekoff|2010|p=464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28431">An '''isotopic signature''' (also '''isotopic fingerprint''') is a ratio of non-radiogenic '[[Stable isotope ratio|stable isotopes]]', stable [[Radiogenic nuclide|radiogenic isotopes]], or unstable [[radioactive]] isotopes of particular elements in an investigated material. The ratios of isotopes in a sample material are measured by [[isotope-ratio mass spectrometry]] against an [[Reference Materials for Stable Isotope Analysis|isotopic reference material]]. This process is called [[isotope analysis]].

==Stable isotopes==
The [[atomic mass]] of different isotopes affect their [[chemical kinetics|chemical kinetic]] behavior, leading to natural [[isotope separation]] processes.

===Carbon isotopes===
{{Hatnote|1=Main article: [[δ13C|δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]]}} &lt;!--Can't get superscript to work otherwise with template: {{Main article|δ13C}} --&gt;

{{Algal carbon isotopes}}
For example, different sources and sinks of [[methane]] have different affinity for the [[Carbon-12|&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C]] and [[carbon-13|&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]] isotopes, which allows distinguishing between different sources by the &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C/&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C ratio in methane in the air. In [[geochemistry]], [[paleoclimatology]] and [[paleoceanography]] this ratio is called [[Δ13C|δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]]. The ratio is calculated with respect to [[Δ13C#Reference standard|Pee Dee Belemnite]] (PDB) [[Reference Materials for Stable Isotope Analysis|standard]]:

:&lt;math chem&gt;\delta \ce{^{13}C}_\mathrm{sample} = \left(\frac{\ce{^{13}C/^{12}C}_\ce{sample}}{\ce{^{13}C/^{12}C}_\mathrm{standard}} - 1\right) \cdot 1000&lt;/math&gt; &amp;permil;

Similarly, carbon in inorganic [[carbonate]]s shows little isotopic fractionation, while carbon in materials originated by [[photosynthesis]] is depleted of the heavier isotopes. In addition, there are two types of plants with different biochemical pathways; the [[C3 carbon fixation]], where the isotope separation effect is more pronounced, [[C4 carbon fixation]], where the heavier &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C is less depleted, and [[Crassulacean Acid Metabolism]] (CAM) plants, where the effect is similar but less pronounced than with C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; plants. Isotopic fractionation in plants is caused by physical (slower diffusion of &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C in plant tissues due to increased atomic weight) and biochemical (preference of &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C by two enzymes: [[RuBisCO]] and [[phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase]]) factors.&lt;ref&gt;Park S. Nobel (2009) Physicochemical and Environmental Plant Physiology. P.410.&lt;/ref&gt; The different isotope ratios for the two kinds of plants propagate through the [[food chain]], thus it is possible to determine if the principal diet of a human or an animal consists primarily of C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; plants ([[rice]], [[wheat]], [[soybeans]], [[potato]]es) or C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; plants ([[maize|corn]], or [[corn-fed beef|corn-fed]] [[beef]]) by [[isotope analysis]] of their flesh and bone collagen (however, to obtain more accurate determinations, carbon isotopic fractionation must be also taken into account, since several studies have reported significant &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C discrimination during biodegradation of simple and complex substrates).&lt;ref name="FernandezCadisch2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fernandez|first1=Irene|last2=Cadisch|first2=Georg|title=Discrimination against13C during degradation of simple and complex substrates by two white rot fungi|journal=Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry|volume=17|issue=23|year=2003|pages=2614–2620|issn=0951-4198|doi=10.1002/rcm.1234|pmid=14648898|bibcode=2003RCMS...17.2614F}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FernandezMahieu2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fernandez|first1=I.|last2=Mahieu|first2=N.|last3=Cadisch|first3=G.|title=Carbon isotopic fractionation during decomposition of plant materials of different quality|journal=Global Biogeochemical Cycles|volume=17|issue=3|year=2003|pages=n/a|issn=0886-6236|doi=10.1029/2001GB001834|bibcode = 2003GBioC..17.1075F }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Within C3 plants processes regulating changes in δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C are well understood, particularly at the leaf level,&lt;ref name="FarquharEhleringer1989"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farquhar|first1=G D|last2=Ehleringer|first2=J R|last3=Hubick|first3=K T|title=Carbon Isotope Discrimination and Photosynthesis|journal=Annual Review of Plant Physiology and Plant Molecular Biology|volume=40|issue=1|year=1989|pages=503–537|issn=1040-2519|doi=10.1146/annurev.pp.40.060189.002443}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also during wood formation.&lt;ref name="McCarrollLoader2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCarroll|first1=Danny|last2=Loader|first2=Neil J.|title=Stable isotopes in tree rings|journal=Quaternary Science Reviews|volume=23|issue=7–8|year=2004|pages=771–801|issn=0277-3791|doi=10.1016/j.quascirev.2003.06.017|bibcode = 2004QSRv...23..771M |citeseerx=10.1.1.336.2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eweda Silveira Lobo Sternberg1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ewe|first1=Sharon M.L|last2=da Silveira Lobo Sternberg|first2=Leonel|last3=Busch|first3=David E|title=Water-use patterns of woody species in pineland and hammock communities of South Florida|journal=Forest Ecology and Management|volume=118|issue=1–3|year=1999|pages=139–148|issn=0378-1127|doi=10.1016/S0378-1127(98)00493-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many recent studies combine leaf level isotopic fractionation with annual patterns of wood formation (i.e. tree ring δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C) to quantify the impacts of climatic variations and atmospheric composition&lt;ref name="CabaneiroFernandez2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cabaneiro|first1=Ana|last2=Fernandez|first2=Irene|title=Disclosing biome sensitivity to atmospheric changes: Stable C isotope ecophysiological dependences during photosynthetic  uptake in Maritime pine and Scots pine ecosystems from southwestern Europe|journal=Environmental Technology &amp; Innovation|volume=4|year=2015|pages=52–61|issn=2352-1864|doi=10.1016/j.eti.2015.04.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; on physiological processes of individual trees and forest stands.&lt;ref name="SilvaAnand2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Silva|first1=Lucas C.

Similarly, marine fish contain more &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C than freshwater fish, with values approximating the C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; plants respectively.&lt;!--bones are composed of an inorganic matrix and organic collagen --&gt;

The ratio of carbon-13 and carbon-12 isotopes in these types of plants is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author1 = O'Leary | first1 = M. H.| title = Carbon Isotopes in Photosynthesis| jstor = 1310735| journal = BioScience| volume = 38| issue = 5| pages = 328–336| year = 1988| doi = 10.2307/1310735}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; plants: -16 to -10 ‰
* CAM plants: -20 to -10 ‰
* C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; plants: -33 to -24 ‰

[[Limestone]]s formed by precipitation in [[sea]]s from the atmospheric carbon dioxide contain normal proportion of &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C. Conversely, [[calcite]] found in [[salt dome]]s originates from carbon dioxide formed by [[oxidation]] of [[petroleum]], which due to its plant origin is &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-depleted. The layer of limestone deposited at the Permian extinction 252 Mya can be identified by the 1% drop in &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C/&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C.

The [[carbon-14|&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C isotope]] is important in distinguishing [[biosynthetized]] materials from man-made ones. [[Biogenic]] chemicals are derived from biospheric carbon, which contains &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C. Carbon in artificially made chemicals is usually derived from [[fossil fuel]]s like [[coal]] or [[petroleum]], where the &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C originally present has decayed below detectable limits. The amount of &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C currently present in a sample therefore indicates the proportion of carbon of biogenic origin.

===Nitrogen isotopes===
{{hatnote|1=Main article: [[δ15N|δ&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N]]}}
[[Isotopes of nitrogen#Nitrogen-15|Nitrogen-15]], or &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N, is often used in [[agriculture|agricultural]] and [[medicine|medical]] research, for example in the [[Meselson–Stahl experiment]] to establish the nature of [[DNA replication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Meselson |first=M. |last2=Stahl |first2=F.

Nitrogen-15 is extensively used to trace [[Ammoniacal nitrogen#Mineral nitrogen|mineral nitrogen]] compounds (particularly [[fertilizers]]) in the environment. When combined with the use of other isotopic labels, &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N is also a very important [[Isotopic tracer|tracer]] for describing the fate of nitrogenous [[Persistent organic pollutant|organic pollutants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Marsh | first1 = K.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tissues and [[hair]] of [[vegan]]s therefore contain significantly lower δ&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N than the bodies of people who eat mostly meat. Similarly, a terrestrial diet produces a different signature than a marine-based diet. Isotopic [[hair analysis|analysis of hair]] is an important source of information for [[archaeology|archaeologists]], providing clues about the ancient diets and differing cultural attitudes to food sources.&lt;ref&gt;Michael P. Richardsa,b,1 and Erik Trinkausc [http://www.pnas.org/content/106/38/16034.full Isotopic evidence for the diets of European Neanderthals and early modern humans] ''PNAS September 22, 2009vol. 106 no. 38 16034-16039''&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of other environmental and physiological factors can influence the nitrogen isotopic composition at the base of the [[food web]] (i.e. in plants) or at the level of individual animals. For example, in arid regions, the [[nitrogen cycle]] tends to be more 'open' and prone to the loss of &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N, increasing δ&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N in soils and plants.&lt;ref name="Handley"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Handley |first=L.L |last2=Austin |first2=A.

===Oxygen isotopes===
{{hatnote|1=Main article: [[δ18O|δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O]]}}
Oxygen comes in three variants, but the &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;[[Oxygen|O]] is so rare that it is very difficult to detect (~0.04% abundant).&lt;ref name="iupac_abundance"&gt;{{cite journal| journal = Pure Appl.

As the vapor tension depends on the concentration of dissolved salts, the &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;[[Oxygen|O]]/&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O ratio shows correlation on the [[salinity]] and temperature of water. As oxygen gets built into the shells of [[calcium carbonate]] secreting organisms, such sediments prove a chronological record of temperature and salinity of the water in the area.

Oxygen isotope ratio in atmosphere varies predictably with time of year and geographic location; e.g. there is a 2% difference between &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O-rich precipitation in Montana and &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O-depleted precipitation in Florida Keys. This variability can be used for approximate determination of geographic location of origin of a material; e.g. it is possible to determine where a shipment of [[uranium oxide]] was produced. The rate of exchange of surface isotopes with the environment has to be taken in account.&lt;ref name="nucfor"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=W3FnEOg8tS4C&amp;pg=PA399&amp;dq=%22nuclear+forensics%22&amp;num=50&amp;cd=4#v=onepage&amp;q=%22nuclear%20forensics%22&amp;f=false Nuclear Forensic Analysis - Kenton J.

==Radiogenic isotopes==

===Lead isotopes===
Lead consists of four stable [[isotopes of lead|isotopes]]: &lt;sup&gt;204&lt;/sup&gt;Pb, &lt;sup&gt;206&lt;/sup&gt;Pb, &lt;sup&gt;207&lt;/sup&gt;Pb, and &lt;sup&gt;208&lt;/sup&gt;Pb. Local variations in [[uranium]]/[[thorium]]/[[lead]] content cause a wide location-specific variation of isotopic ratios for lead from different localities. Lead emitted to the atmosphere by industrial processes has an isotopic composition different from lead in minerals. Combustion of [[gasoline]] with [[tetraethyllead]] additive led to formation of ubiquitous micrometer-sized lead-rich [[particulate]]s in car exhaust [[smoke]]; especially in urban areas the man-made lead particles are much more common than natural ones. The differences in isotopic content in particles found in objects can be used for approximate geolocation of the object's origin.&lt;ref name="nucfor"/&gt;

==Radioactive isotopes==
[[Hot particles]], radioactive particles of [[nuclear fallout]] and [[radioactive waste]], also exhibit distinct isotopic signatures. Their radionuclide composition (and thus their age and origin) can be determined by [[mass spectrometry]] or by [[gamma ray spectrometer|gamma spectrometry]]. For example, particles generated by a nuclear blast contain detectable amounts of &lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;[[Cobalt|Co]] and &lt;sup&gt;152&lt;/sup&gt;[[Europium|Eu]]. The [[Chernobyl accident]] did not release these particles but did release &lt;sup&gt;125&lt;/sup&gt;[[Antimony|Sb]] and &lt;sup&gt;144&lt;/sup&gt;[[Cerium|Ce]]. Particles from underwater bursts will consist mostly of irradiated sea salts. Ratios of &lt;sup&gt;152&lt;/sup&gt;[[Europium|Eu]]/&lt;sup&gt;155&lt;/sup&gt;Eu, &lt;sup&gt;154&lt;/sup&gt;Eu/&lt;sup&gt;155&lt;/sup&gt;Eu, and &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;[[Plutonium|Pu]]/&lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu are also different for fusion and fission [[nuclear weapon]]s, which allows identification of hot particles of unknown origin.

==Applications==

===Archaeological studies===
In archaeological studies, stable isotope ratios have been used to track diet within the time span formation of analyzed tissues (10-15 years for bone collagen and intra-annual periods for tooth enamel bioapatite) from individuals; "recipes" of foodstuffs (ceramic vessel residues); locations of cultivation and types of plants grown (chemical extractions from sediments); and migration of individuals (dental material).{{cn|date=March 2018}}

===Forensics===
With the advent of stable [[isotope ratio mass spectrometry]], isotopic signatures of materials find increasing use in [[forensics]], distinguishing the origin of otherwise similar materials and tracking the materials to their common source. For example, the isotope signatures of plants can be to a degree influenced by the growth conditions, including moisture and nutrient availability. In case of synthetic materials, the signature is influenced by the conditions during the chemical reaction. The isotopic signature profiling is useful in cases where other kinds of profiling, e.g. characterization of [[impurities]], are not optimal. Electronics coupled with scintillator detectors are routinely used to evaluate isotope signatures and identify unknown sources.

A study was published demonstrating the possibility of determination of the origin of a common brown [[pressure sensitive adhesive|PSA]] [[packaging tape]] by using the carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen isotopic signature of the backing polymer, additives, and [[adhesive]].&lt;ref&gt;James F. Carter, Polly L. Grundy, Jenny C. Hill, Neil C. Ronan, Emma L. Titterton and Richard Sleeman "Forensic isotope ratio mass spectrometry of packaging tapes" Analyst, 2004, 129, 1206 - 1210, {{doi|10.1039/b409341k}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Measurement of carbon isotopic ratios can be used for detection of [[adulteration]] of [[honey]]. Addition of sugars originated from corn or sugar cane (C4 plants) skews the isotopic ratio of sugars present in honey, but does not influence the isotopic ratio of proteins; in an unadulterated honey the carbon isotopic ratios of sugars and proteins should match.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = González Martı́n | first1 = I.| last2 = Marqués Macı́as | first2 = E.| last3 = Sánchez Sánchez | first3 = J.| last4 = González Rivera | first4 = B.| title = Detection of honey adulteration with beet sugar using stable isotope methodology| journal = Food Chemistry| volume = 61| issue = 3| pages = 281–286| year = 1998| doi = 10.1016/S0308-8146(97)00101-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; As low as 7% level of addition can be detected.&lt;ref name="honeycouncil.ca"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140101171222/http://www.honeycouncil.ca/documents/HivelightsNov2004.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

His pioneering work with [[Howard Penman]] on [[evapotranspiration]] is applied worldwide as the [[Penman-Monteith]] equation. It predicts [[evapotranspiration]] and is recommended by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] for calculating irrigation quantities.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; Monteith's research on the role of the environment in agriculture, the physics of crop microclimate, physiology of crop growth and yield, radiation climatology, heat balance in animals,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Heat Loss from Animals and Man|last=|first=|publisher=Butterworths|year=1974|isbn=040870652X|editor-last=Monteith|editor-first=John L.|location=London|pages=|editor-last2=Mount|editor-first2=Laurence E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and instrumentation for measuring physical and physiological variables in agriculture has been published in journals throughout the world&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rmets.org/about-us/history-society/distinguished-voices-audio|title=Distinguished Voices Audio: John Lennox Monteith DSc FRS FRMetS (interview: 2 hours 40 mins in 4 parts)|last=|first=|date=1994|website=Royal Meteorological Society|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

He was President of the [[Royal Meteorological Society]] from 1978 to 1980. In his presidential address in 1980 he advised colleagues that unless they could understand how crop yields were determined by weather events, they would have little hope of predicting how crop yields would vary as a result of [[global warming]] and elevated {{co2}} levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Carter | first1 = T.

His nomination for the [[Royal Society]] reads: {{centred pull quote|Dr. Monteith has made outstanding contributions to knowledge and understanding of the micro-climatology of field crops. In the physics, he has achieved complete energy, water, and carbon dioxide balances; in the biology, he has linked transpiration, assimilation and respiration rates with stomatal responses to light intensity, leaf orientation, ventilation and soil water stress. His early work on the physics of dew is unlikely to be superseded: his radiation studies embrace a survey for the British Isles down to the attenuation and spectral changes as sunlight filters through a crop canopy. He has been highly successful in devising or improving apparatus, and he has added much to the concept of "potential photosynthesis" as a measure of how a plant ought to grow in a given environment. In the application of physical principles to plant ecology he has few peers, and is an acknowledged leader in this aspect of crop meteorology.&lt;ref name="royal"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://collections.royalsociety.org/DServe.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqCmd=show.tcl&amp;dsqSearch=(RefNo==%27EC%2F1971%2F17%27) |title=EC/1971/17: Monteith, John Lennox |publisher=The Royal Society |archivedate=25 June 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QbSbeikG?url=https://collections.royalsociety.org/DServe.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqCmd=show.tcl&amp;dsqSearch=%28RefNo%3D%3D%27EC%2F1971%2F17%27%29 |location=London |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2447">'''Llinás's law''', or '''law of no interchangeability of neurons''', is a statement in [[neuroscience]] made by [[Rodolfo Llinás]] in 1989, during his Luigi Galvani Award Lecture at the Fidia Research Foundation Neuroscience Award Lectures .&lt;ref&gt;Llinás, Rodolfo (1990). "Intrinsic Electrical Properties of Mammalian Neurons and CNS Function". Fidia Research Foundation Neuroscience Award Lectures, 1988–1989 (Raven Press) 4:  p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A [[neuron]] of a given kind (e.g. a [[thalamus|thalamic]] cell) cannot be functionally replaced by one of another type (e.g. an [[Inferior olivary nucleus|inferior ollivary]] cell) even if their [[synapse|synaptic]] connectivity and the type of [[neurotransmitter]] outputs are identical. (The difference is that the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of thalamic cells are extraordinarily different from those of inferior olivary neurons).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Llinás|first=Rodolfo R.|date=2014|title=Intrinsic electrical properties of mammalian neurons and CNS function: a historical perspective|journal=Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience|volume=8|pages=320|doi=10.3389/fncel.2014.00320|issn=1662-5102|pmc=4219458|pmid=25408634}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The statement of this law is a consequence of an article written by Rodolfo Llinas himself in 1988 and published in [[Science (journal)|Science]] with the title "The Intrinsic Electrophysiological Properties of Mammalian Neurons: Insights into Central Nervous System Function",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Llinas|first=R. R.|date=1988-12-23|title=The intrinsic electrophysiological properties of mammalian neurons: insights into central nervous system function|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/242/4886/1654|journal=Science|language=en|volume=242|issue=4886|pages=1654–1664|doi=10.1126/science.3059497|issn=0036-8075|pmid=3059497}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is considered a watershed due to its more than 2000 citations in the scientific literature, marking a major shift in viewpoint in neuroscience around the functional aspect. Until then, the prevailing belief in neuroscience was that just the connections and [[neurotransmitters]] released by neurons was enough to determine their function. Research by Llinás and colleagues during the 80's with vertebrates revealed this previously held dogma was wrong.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11785">In [[cultural studies]], '''media culture''' refers to the current [[Western world|Western]] [[capitalist]] society that emerged and developed from the 20th century, under the [[influence of mass media]].&lt;ref name="Jansson2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thoman1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomas2012p30"/&gt; The term alludes to the overall impact and intellectual guidance exerted by the media (primarily TV, but also the press, radio and cinema), not only on public opinion but also on [[Taste (sociology)|taste]]s and [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]].

The alternative term '''mass culture''' conveys the idea that such culture emerges spontaneously from the masses themselves, like popular art did before the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Adorno (1963) quotation: {{quotation|...the interpretation agreeable to its advocates: that it is a matter of something like a culture that arises spontaneously from the masses themselves, the contemporary form of popular art.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expression media culture, on the other hand, conveys the idea that such culture is the product of the mass media. Another alternative term for media culture is "image culture."&lt;ref name="Jansson2002"&gt;Jansson (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thoman1992"&gt;Thoman (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

Media culture, with its declinations of advertising and public relations, is often considered as a system centered on the manipulation of the mass of society.&lt;ref name="Bignell2007p21"/&gt; [[Corporate media]] "are used primarily to represent and reproduce dominant ideologies."&lt;ref name="Nomai2008p5"&gt;Nomai (2008) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y4auF2ysN0wC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA5 pp.5], 41&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent in the development of this perspective has been the work of [[Theodor Adorno]] since the 1940s.&lt;ref name="Bignell2007p21"&gt;Bignell (2007) [https://books.google.com/books?id=0lVabD9fYBIC&amp;pg=PA21 pp.21-2]&lt;/ref&gt; Media culture is associated with [[consumerism]], and in this sense called alternatively "consumer culture."&lt;ref name="Jansson2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomas2012p30"&gt;Thomas (2012) [https://books.google.com/books?id=v76Ksn6vFIIC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30 p.30] quotation: {{quotation|The twenty-first century Western world, driven by American corporate and consumer ideology, is a perpetual media culture that depends on sound bites and ''the next thing'', leaving the public reduced  to media consumers never allowed time to reflect on the information. Volume and speed have consumed and obliterated nuance, ethics, and accuracy.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Over-quotation|section|date=February 2011}}
{{quote|"[[Popular culture]] and the mass media have a symbiotic relationship: each depends on the other in an intimate collaboration."|K. Turner (1984), p. 4&lt;ref&gt;Shuker, Roy (1994). ''Understanding Popular Music'', p. 4. {{ISBN|0-415-10723-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[news media]] mines the work of [[scientist]]s and [[scholar]]s and conveys it to the [[general public]], often emphasizing elements that have inherent appeal or the power to amaze. For instance, [[giant panda]]s (a species in remote Chinese woodlands) have become well-known items of popular culture; [[intestinal parasite|parasitic worms]], though of greater practical importance, have not. Both scholarly facts and news stories get modified through popular transmission, often to the point of outright falsehoods.

[[Hannah Arendt]]'s 1961 essay "The Crisis in Culture" suggested that a "market-driven media would lead to the displacement of culture by the dictates of [[entertainment]]."&lt;ref name=nomuzak&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nomuzak.co.uk/dumbing_down.html |title=Dumbing down |publisher=Nomuzak.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029011017/http://nomuzak.co.uk/dumbing_down.html |archivedate=October 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susan Sontag]] argues that in our culture, the most "...intelligible, persuasive values are [increasingly] drawn from the entertainment industries", which has spelt the "undermining of standards of seriousness." As a result, "tepid, the glib, and the senselessly cruel" topics are becoming the norm.&lt;ref name=nomuzak/&gt;
Some critics argue that popular culture is "dumbing down": "newspapers that once ran foreign news now feature celebrity gossip, pictures of scantily dressed young ladies... television has replaced high-quality drama with gardening, cookery, and other "lifestyle" programmes [and] reality TV and asinine soaps," to the point that people are constantly immersed in [[trivia]] about [[celebrity culture]].&lt;ref name=nomuzak/&gt;

According to Altheide and Snow, media culture means that within a culture, the media increasingly influences other institutions (e.g. politics, religion, sports), which become constructed alongside a media logic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Altheide, D. L., &amp; Snow, R. P.|title=Media Logic|date=1979|publisher=Sage|location=Beverly Hills, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1950s, television has been the main medium for molding [[public opinion]].&lt;ref name="Diggs-Brown2011p53"&gt;Diggs-Brown, Barbara (2011) [https://books.google.com/books?id=7c0ycySng4YC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;lpg=PA53 ''Strategic Public Relations: Audience Focused Practice''] p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

In Rosenberg and White's book ''Mass Culture'', [[Dwight Macdonald]] argues that "Popular culture is a debased, trivial culture that voids both the deep realities ([[sex]], [[death]], [[failure]], [[tragedy]]) and also the simple spontaneous pleasures... The masses, debauched by several generations of this sort of thing, in turn come to demand trivial and comfortable cultural products."&lt;ref name=nomuzak/&gt; Van den Haag argues that "all mass media in the end alienate people from personal experience and though appearing to offset it, intensify their moral isolation from each other, from the reality and from themselves."&lt;ref name=nomuzak/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van den Haag, in Bernard Rosenberg and David Manning White, ''Mass Culture'', p. 529.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics have lamented the "replacement of high art and authentic folk culture by tasteless industrialised artefacts [[mass production|produced on a mass scale]] in order to satisfy the [[lowest common denominator]]."&lt;ref name=nomuzak/&gt; This "mass culture emerged after the Second World War and have led to the concentration of mass-culture power in ever larger global media conglomerates." The popular press decreased the amount of news or information and replaced it with entertainment or [[titillation]] that reinforces "fears, [[prejudice]], scapegoating processes, [[paranoia]], and aggression."&lt;ref name=nomuzak/&gt; Critics of television and film have argued that the quality of TV output has been diluted as stations pursue ratings by focusing on the "glitzy, the superficial, and the popular". In film, "Hollywood culture and values" are increasingly dominating film production in other countries. Hollywood films have changed from creating formulaic films which emphasize "shock-value and superficial [[:wikt:thrill|thrill]][s]" and the use of special effects, with themes that focus on the "basic [[instinct]]s of aggression, revenge, violence, [and] greed." The plots "often seem [[simplistic]], a standardized template taken from the shelf, and dialogue is minimal." The "characters are shallow and unconvincing, the dialogue is also simple, unreal, and badly constructed."&lt;ref name=nomuzak/&gt;

More recently, scholars turned to the concept of the [[Mediatization (media)|mediatization]] of culture to address the various processes through which culture is influenced by the modus operandi of the media. On one hand, the media are cultural institutions and artifacts of their own, on the other hand, other domains have become dependent on the media and their various affordances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=S. Hjarvard  |author2=L. N. Petersen|title=Mediatization and cultural change|journal=MedieKultur|date=2013|issue=54|pages=1–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Through religion==
Media culture, in its mass marketing, has been compared to the role of religions in the past. It has been considered as taking the place of the old traditional religions.&lt;ref&gt;from Debord (1977) thesis 20: "The spectacle is the material reconstruction of the religious illusion."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Debord (1967) thesis 25 on the spectacle and the [[sacred]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nomai2008p176"&gt;Nomai (2008) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y4auF2ysN0wC&amp;pg=PA176 p.176]&lt;/ref&gt; The waves of enthusiasm and fervent exaltation for a given product, a characteristic [[consumerist]] phenomenon, has been compared to the "ecstasies of the convulsions and miracles of the old religious fetishism".&lt;ref name="Thesis67"&gt;Debord (1977) Thesis 67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;from Debord (1977) thesis 132: "The masters who make history their private property, under the protection of myth, possess first of all a private ownership of the mode of illusion: in China and Egypt they long held a monopoly over the immortality of the soul ... The growth of their real historical power goes together with a popularization of the possession of myth and illusion."&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, the [[Catholic Church]], the dominant religious institution in the Western world, has been considered retrospectively as an antecedent and sophisticated form of [[public relations]], [[advertiser]] and [[multinational corporation]], selling its product to a mass of worshipers/consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Ballardini, Bruno (2006) [https://books.google.com/books?id=n1zyAAAACAAJ ''Gesù lava più bianco.

[[File:Hydroxyl radical.png|thumb|The [[hydroxyl radical]], [[Lewis structure]] shown, contains one unpaired electron]]

In [[chemistry]], a '''radical''' is an [[atom]], [[molecule]], or [[ion]] that has an [[unpaired electron|unpaired valence electron]].&lt;ref&gt;IUPAC Gold Book [http://goldbook.iupac.org/R05066.html ''radical (free radical)''] [http://www.iupac.org/goldbook/R05066.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hayyan | first1 = M. | last2 = Hashim | first2 = M.A. | last3 = AlNashef | first3 = I.M. | year = 2016 | title = Superoxide Ion: Generation and Chemical Implications | url = | journal = Chem. Rev. | volume = 116 | issue = 5| pages = 3029–85 | doi = 10.1021/acs.chemrev.5b00407 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
With some exceptions, these unpaired electrons make radicals highly [[chemical reaction|chemically reactive]].  Many radicals spontaneously [[dimer (chemistry)|dimerize]].  Most organic radicals have short lifetimes.

A notable example of a radical is the [[hydroxyl radical]] (HO•), a molecule that has one unpaired electron on the oxygen atom. Two other examples are [[triplet oxygen]] and [[methylene radical|triplet carbene]] (''':'''{{chem|CH|2}}) which have two unpaired electrons.

Radicals may be generated in a number of ways, but typical methods involve [[redox reaction]]s. [[Ionizing radiation]], heat, electrical discharges, and [[electrolysis]] are known to produce radicals. Radicals are intermediates in many chemical reactions, more so than is apparent from the balanced equations.

Radicals are important in [[combustion]], [[atmospheric chemistry]], [[polymerization]], [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] chemistry, [[biochemistry]], and many other chemical processes. A large fraction of natural products is generated by radical-generating enzymes.  In living organisms, the radicals [[superoxide]] and [[nitric oxide]] and their reaction products regulate many processes, such as control of vascular tone and thus blood pressure. They also play a key role in the intermediary metabolism of various biological compounds. Such radicals can even be messengers in a process dubbed [[redox signaling]].  A radical may be trapped within a ''[[Cage effect (chemistry)|solvent cage]]'' or be otherwise bound.

==Depiction in chemical reactions==
&lt;!-- "Mass spectrum analysis" links here --&gt; 
In chemical equations, radicals are frequently denoted by a dot placed immediately to the right of the atomic symbol or molecular formula as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Cl}_2 \; \xrightarrow{UV} \; 2 {\mathrm{Cl} \cdot}&lt;/math&gt;

Radical [[reaction mechanism]]s use single-headed arrows to depict the movement of single electrons:

[[File:Radical.svg|centre|300px]]

The [[Homolysis (chemistry)|homolytic]] cleavage of the breaking bond is drawn with a 'fish-hook' arrow to distinguish from the usual movement of two electrons depicted by a standard curly arrow. The second electron of the breaking bond also moves to pair up with the attacking radical electron; this is not explicitly indicated in this case.

Radicals also take part in [[radical addition]] and [[radical substitution]] as [[reactive intermediate]]s. [[Chain reaction#Chemical chain reactions|Chain reactions]] involving radicals can usually be divided into three distinct processes.  These are ''initiation'', ''propagation'', and ''termination''.
*'''Initiation''' reactions are those that result in a net increase in the number of radicals. They may involve the formation of radicals from stable species as in Reaction 1 above or they may involve reactions of radicals with stable species to form more radicals.
*'''Propagation''' reactions are those reactions involving radicals in which the total number of radicals remains the same.
*'''Termination''' reactions are those reactions resulting in a net decrease in the number of radicals. Typically two radicals combine to form a more stable species, for example: 2Cl'''·'''→ Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

== Formation ==
&lt;!--[[Single-electron transfer]] and [[Single electron transfer]] redirect here--&gt;

===Homolysis===
Radicals can form by [[Bond cleavage|breaking of covalent bonds]] by [[Homolysis (chemistry)|homolysis]]. The homolytic [[Bond dissociation energy|bond dissociation energies]], usually abbreviated as "Δ''H''{{px1}}°" are a measure of bond strength. Splitting H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into 2H•, for example, requires a Δ''H''{{px1}}° of +435 k[[Joule per mole|J'''·'''mol{{smallsup|-1}}]], while splitting Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into 2Cl• requires a Δ''H''{{px1}}° of +243 kJ'''·'''mol{{smallsup|-1}}.  For weak bonds, homolysis can be induced thermally.  Strong bonds require high energy photons or even flames to induce homolysis.

===From other radicals===
Radicals or charged species add to non-radicals to give new radicals.  This process is the basis of the [[radical chain]] reaction.
Being prevalent and a diradical, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reacts with many organic compounds to generate radicals together with hydroperoxide radical.  This process is related to [[rancidification]] of unsaturated fats.

===One electron redox===
Radicals may also be formed by single-electron [[Redox|oxidation or reduction]] of an atom or molecule.  These redox reactions occur in electrochemical cells and in ionization chambers of mass spectrometers.

==Persistence and stability==
[[File:VitE.gif|frame|right|The radical derived from ''[[tocopherol|α-tocopherol]]'']]
Although radicals are generally short-lived due to their reactivity, there are long-lived radicals. These are categorized as follows:

===Stable radicals===
The prime example of a stable radical is molecular [[dioxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Another common example is [[nitric oxide]] (NO). Organic radicals can be long lived if they occur in a [[conjugated system|conjugated π system]], such as the radical derived from [[tocopherol|α-tocopherol]] ([[vitamin E]]). There are also hundreds of examples of [[Tetrasulfur tetranitride|thiazyl]] radicals, which show low reactivity and remarkable thermodynamic stability with only a very limited extent of π [[resonance stabilization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Oakley | first1 = Richard T. | title = Progress in Inorganic Chemistry | volume = 36 | pages = 299–391 | year = 1988 | doi = 10.1002/9780470166376.ch4 | format=PDF | url = http://www.chembio.uoguelph.ca/oakley/papers/rto_086.pdf | department = Cyclic and Heterocyclic Thiazenes (section) | series = Progress in Inorganic Chemistry | isbn = 978-0-470-16637-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rawson | first1 = J | last2 = Banister | first2 = A | last3 = Lavender | first3 = I | title = Advances in Heterocyclic Chemistry | volume = 62 | pages = 137–247 | year = 1995 | doi = 10.1016/S0065-2725(08)60422-5 | department = The Chemistry of Dithiadiazolylium and Dithiadiazolyl Rings (section) =  | series = Advances in Heterocyclic Chemistry | isbn = 978-0-12-020762-6  }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persistent radicals===
Persistent radical compounds are those whose longevity is due to [[Steric effects|steric crowding]] around the radical center, which makes it physically difficult for the radical to react with another molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ar50097a003|title=Persistent carbon-centered radicals|year=1976|last1=Griller|first1=David|first2=Keith U.|journal=Accounts of Chemical Research|volume=9|pages=13–19|last2=Ingold}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of these include Gomberg's [[triphenylmethyl radical]], [[Fremy's salt]] (Potassium nitrosodisulfonate, (KSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NO·), [[aminoxyls]], (general formula R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NO·) such as [[TEMPO]], [[TEMPOL]], nitronyl nitroxides, and azephenylenyls and radicals derived from PTM (perchlorophenylmethyl radical) and TTM (tris(2,4,6-trichlorophenyl)methyl radical). Persistent radicals are generated in great quantity during combustion, and "may be responsible for the [[oxidative stress]] resulting in cardiopulmonary disease and probably cancer that has been attributed to exposure to airborne fine particles".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1 = Lomnicki S.|author2 = Truong H.|author3 = Vejerano E.|author4 = Dellinger B.|title = Copper oxide-based model of persistent free radical formation on combustion-derived particulate matter|journal = Environ. Sci. Technol.|year = 2008|volume = 42|issue = 13|pages = 4982–88|pmid = 18678037|doi = 10.1021/es071708h|bibcode = 2008EnST...42.4982L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diradicals===
[[Diradical]]s are molecules containing two radical centers. Multiple radical centers can exist in a molecule. Atmospheric oxygen naturally exists as a diradical in its ground state as [[triplet oxygen]]. The low reactivity of atmospheric oxygen is due to its diradical state. Non-radical states of dioxygen are actually less stable than the diradical. The relative stability of the oxygen diradical is primarily due to the [[Quantum chemistry|spin-forbidden]] nature of the triplet-singlet transition required for it to grab electrons, i.e., "oxidize". The diradical state of oxygen also results in its paramagnetic character, which is demonstrated by its attraction to an external magnet.&lt;ref&gt;However, [[paramagnetism]] does not necessarily imply radical character.&lt;/ref&gt; Diradicals can also occur in [[Transition metal oxo complex|metal-oxo complexes]], lending themselves for studies of [[spin forbidden reactions]] in [[transition metal]] chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Svensson|first=Mats|date=1999|title=Timing is Critical: Effect of Spin Changes on the Diastereoselectivity in Mn(Salen)-Catalyzed Epoxidation|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=121|issue=21|pages=5083–84|doi=10.1021/ja9809915}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactivity==
{{Main|Free radical reaction}}
Radical alkyl intermediates are stabilized by similar physical processes to [[carbocations]]: as a general rule, the more substituted the radical center is, the more stable it is. This directs their reactions. Thus, formation of a tertiary radical (R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C·) is favored over secondary (R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;HC·), which is favored over primary (RH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C·). Likewise,  radicals next to functional groups such as carbonyl, nitrile, and ether are more stable than tertiary alkyl radicals.

Radicals attack double bonds. However, unlike similar ions, such radical reactions are not as much directed by electrostatic interactions. For example, the reactivity of nucleophilic ions with α,β-unsaturated compounds (C=C–C=O) is directed by the electron-withdrawing effect of the oxygen, resulting in a partial positive charge on the carbonyl carbon. There are two reactions that are observed in the ionic case: the carbonyl is attacked in a direct addition to carbonyl, or the vinyl is attacked in [[conjugate addition]], and in either case, the charge on the nucleophile is taken by the oxygen. Radicals add rapidly to the double bond, and the resulting α-radical carbonyl is relatively stable; it can couple with another molecule or be oxidized. Nonetheless, the electrophilic/neutrophilic character of radicals has been shown in a variety of instances. One example is the alternating tendency of the copolymerization of [[maleic anhydride]] (electrophilic) and [[styrene]] (slightly nucleophilic).

In intramolecular reactions, precise control can be achieved despite the extreme reactivity of radicals. In general,  radicals attack the closest reactive site the most readily. Therefore, when there is a choice, a preference for five-membered rings is observed: four-membered rings are too strained, and collisions with carbons six or more atoms away in the chain are infrequent.

Triplet [[carbene]]s and [[nitrene]]s, which are diradicals, have distinctive chemistry.

==Combustion==
[[File:Spectrum of blue flame.png|thumb|right|350px|Spectrum of the blue flame from a [[butane]] torch showing excited molecular radical band emission and [[Swan bands]]]]
{{main|Combustion#Reaction mechanism}}
A familiar radical reaction is [[combustion]]. The [[oxygen]] molecule is a stable [[diradical]], best represented by ·O-O·. Because [[Spin (physics)|spins]] of the electrons are parallel, this molecule is stable.  While the [[ground state]] of oxygen is this unreactive spin-unpaired ([[Triplet oxygen|triplet]]) diradical, an extremely reactive spin-paired ([[Singlet oxygen|singlet]]) state is available. For combustion to occur, the [[energy barrier]] between these must be overcome. This barrier can be overcome by heat, requiring high temperatures.  The triplet-singlet transition is also "[[Forbidden mechanism|forbidden]]".  This presents an additional barrier to the reaction.  It also means molecular oxygen is relatively unreactive at room temperature except in the presence of a catalytic heavy atom such as iron or copper.

Combustion consists of various radical chain reactions that the singlet radical can initiate. The [[flammability]] of a given material strongly depends on the concentration of radicals that must be obtained before initiation and propagation reactions dominate leading to [[combustion]] of the material. Once the combustible material has been consumed, termination reactions again dominate and the flame dies out.  As indicated,  promotion of propagation or termination reactions alters flammability.  For example, because lead itself deactivates radicals in the gasoline-air mixture, [[tetraethyl lead]] was once commonly added to gasoline. This prevents the combustion from initiating in an uncontrolled manner or in unburnt residues ([[engine knocking]]) or premature ignition ([[preignition]]).

When a hydrocarbon is burned, a large number of different oxygen radicals are involved. Initially, [[hydroperoxyl|hydroperoxyl radical]] (HOO·) are formed. These then react further to give [[organic hydroperoxide]]s that break up into [[hydroxyl radical]]s (HO·).

==Polymerization==
In addition to combustion, many [[polymerization]] reactions involve radicals. As a result, many plastics, enamels, and other polymers are formed through [[radical polymerization]]. For instance, [[drying oil]]s and [[alkyd]] paints harden due to radical crosslinking by oxygen from the atmosphere.

Recent advances in radical polymerization methods, known as [[living polymerization|living radical polymerization]], include:
*Reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer ([[RAFT (chemistry)|RAFT]])
*Atom transfer radical polymerization ([[ATRP (chemistry)|ATRP]])
*Nitroxide mediated polymerization (NMP)
These methods produce polymers with a much narrower distribution of molecular weights.

==Atmospheric radicals==
{{See also|Oxygen cycle|Ozone-oxygen cycle}}
The most common radical in the lower atmosphere is molecular dioxygen. [[Photodissociation]] of source molecules produces other radicals. In the lower atmosphere, important radical are produced by the photodissociation of [[nitrogen dioxide]] to an oxygen atom and [[nitric oxide]] (see {{EquationNote|eq. 1. 1}} below), which plays a key role in [[Photochemical smog|smog]] formation—and the photodissociation of ozone to give the excited oxygen atom O(1D) (see {{EquationNote|eq. 1. 2}} below). The net and return reactions are also shown ({{EquationNote|eq. 1. 3}} and {{EquationNote|eq. 1. 4}}, respectively).
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;chem&gt;{NO2} -&gt;[h \nu] {NO} + {O}&lt;/chem&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 1. 1}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;chem&gt;{O} + {O2} -&gt; {O3}&lt;/chem&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 1. 2}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;chem&gt;{NO2} + {O2} -&gt;[h \nu] {NO} + {O3}&lt;/chem&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 1. 3}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;chem&gt;{NO} + {O3} -&gt; {NO2} + {O2}&lt;/chem&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 1. 4}}}}
In the upper atmosphere, the photodissociation of normally unreactive [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s (CFCs) by solar [[ultraviolet radiation]] is an important source of radicals (see eq. 1 below). These reactions give the chlorine radical, Cl•, which catalyzes the conversion of [[ozone]] to O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, i.e., [[Ozone depletion]] ({{EquationNote|eq. 2. 2}}–{{EquationNote|eq. 2. 4}} below).
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;chem&gt;{CFCS} -&gt;[h \nu] {Cl.}&lt;/chem&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 2. 1}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;chem&gt;{Cl.} + {O3} -&gt; {ClO.} + {O2}&lt;/chem&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 2. 2}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;chem&gt;{O3} -&gt;[h \nu] {O} + {O2}&lt;/chem&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 2. 3}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;chem&gt;{O} + {ClO.} -&gt; {Cl.} + {O2}&lt;/chem&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 2. 4}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;chem&gt;{2O3} -&gt;[h \nu] 3O2&lt;/chem&gt;|{{EquationRef|eq. 2. 5}}}}
Such reactions cause the depletion of the [[ozone layer]], especially since the chlorine radical is free to engage in another reaction chain; consequently, the use of chlorofluorocarbons as [[refrigerant]]s has been restricted.

==In biology==
{{See also|Dioxygen in biological reactions}}
Radicals play important roles in biology.  Many of these are necessary for life, such as the intracellular killing of bacteria by phagocytic cells such as [[granulocyte]]s and [[macrophage]]s. Radicals are involved in [[signal transduction|cell signalling]] processes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pacher P, Beckman JS, Liaudet L |title=Nitric oxide and peroxynitrite in health and disease |journal=Physiol. Rev. |volume=87 |issue=1 |pages=315–424 |year=2007 |pmid=17237348 |doi=10.1152/physrev.00029.2006 |pmc=2248324}}&lt;/ref&gt; known as [[redox signaling]].  For example, radical attack of linoleic acid produces a series of [[13-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid]]s and [[9-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid]]s, which may act to regulate localized tissue inflammatory and/or healing responses, pain perception, and the proliferation of malignant cells. Radical attacks on arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid produce a similar but broader array of signaling products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3389/fphys.2013.00366 | volume=4 | title=Lipid peroxidation: pathophysiological and pharmacological implications in the eye | journal=Frontiers in Physiology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DeoxyadenosylRadical.png|thumb|Structure of the [[deoxyadenosyl radical]], a common biosynthetic intermediate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Broderick, J.B.; Duffus, B.R.; Duschene, K.S.; Shepard, E.M. |title=Radical S-Adenosylmethionine Enzymes|journal=Chemical Reviews|year=2014|volume=114|pages=4229–317|doi= 10.1021/cr4004709}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Radicals may also be involved in [[Parkinson's disease]], senile and drug-induced [[deafness]], [[schizophrenia]], and [[Alzheimer's]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Floyd | first1 = R.A. | year = 1999 | title = Neuroinflammatory processes are important in neurodegenerative diseases: An hypothesis to explain the increased formation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species as major factors involved in neurodegenerative disease development | url = | journal = Free Radical Biology and Medicine | volume = 26 | issue = 9–10| pages = 1346–55 | doi =  10.1016/s0891-5849(98)00293-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The classic free-radical syndrome, the iron-storage disease [[hemochromatosis]], is typically associated with a constellation of free-radical-related symptoms including movement disorder, psychosis, skin pigmentary [[melanin]] abnormalities, deafness, arthritis, and diabetes mellitus. The [[free-radical theory]] of aging proposes that radicals underlie the [[Senescence|aging process]] itself. Similarly, the process of mito[[hormesis]] suggests that repeated exposure to radicals may extend life span.

Because radicals are necessary for life, the body has a number of mechanisms to minimize radical-induced damage and to repair damage that occurs, such as the [[enzyme]]s [[superoxide dismutase]], [[catalase]], [[glutathione peroxidase]] and [[glutathione reductase]]. In addition, [[antioxidant]]s play a key role in these defense mechanisms. These are often the three vitamins, [[vitamin A]], [[vitamin C]] and [[vitamin E]] and [[polyphenol antioxidant]]s. Furthermore, there is good evidence indicating that [[bilirubin]] and [[uric acid]] can act as antioxidants to help neutralize certain radicals. Bilirubin comes from the breakdown of [[red blood cell]]s' contents, while uric acid is a breakdown product of [[purine]]s. Too much bilirubin, though, can lead to [[jaundice]], which could eventually damage the central nervous system, while too much uric acid causes [[gout]].&lt;ref&gt;An overview of the role of radicals in biology and of the use of electron spin resonance in their detection may be found in {{cite book|author=Rhodes C.J.|title=Toxicology of the Human Environment – the critical role of free radicals|publisher=Taylor and Francis|place= London|year= 2000|isbn= 0-7484-0916-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reactive oxygen species===
[[Reactive oxygen species]] or ROS are species such as [[superoxide]], [[hydrogen peroxide]], and [[hydroxyl radical]], commonly associated with cell damage. ROS form as a natural by-product of the normal metabolism of [[oxygen]] and have important roles in cell signaling.
Two important oxygen-centered radicals are [[superoxide]] and [[hydroxyl radical]]. They derive from molecular oxygen under reducing conditions. However, because of their reactivity, these same radicals can participate in unwanted side reactions resulting in cell damage. Excessive amounts of these radicals can lead to cell injury and [[death]], which may contribute to many diseases such as [[cancer]], [[stroke]], [[myocardial infarction]], [[diabetes]] and major disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rajamani Karthikeyan |author2=Manivasagam T |author3=Anantharaman P |author4=Balasubramanian T |author5=Somasundaram ST |title=Chemopreventive effect of Padina boergesenii extracts on ferric nitrilotriacetate (Fe-NTA)-induced oxidative damage in Wistar rats |journal=J. Appl. Phycol.| year=2011|doi=10.1007/s10811-010-9564-0 |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=257–63}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Many forms of [[cancer]] are thought to be the result of reactions between radicals and [[DNA]], potentially resulting in [[mutation]]s that can adversely affect the [[cell cycle]] and potentially lead to malignancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mukherjee | first1 = P.K. | last2 = Marcheselli | first2 = V.L. | last3 = Serhan | first3 = C.N. | last4 = Bazan | first4 = N.G. | year = 2004 | title = Neuroprotecin D1: A docosahexanoic acid-derived docosatriene protects human retinal pigment epithelial cells from oxidative stress | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA | volume = 101 | issue = 22| pages = 8491–96 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0402531101 | pmid=15152078 | pmc=420421| bibcode = 2004PNAS..101.8491M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the symptoms of [[Senescence|aging]] such as [[atherosclerosis]] are also attributed to radical induced oxidation of cholesterol to 7-ketocholesterol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=10224662 | volume=31 | title=7-Ketocholesterol | year=1999 | journal=Int. J. Biochem.

Radicals produced by [[cigarette]] [[smoke]] are implicated in inactivation of [[alpha 1-antitrypsin]] in the [[lung]]. This process promotes the development of [[emphysema]].

[[Oxybenzone]] has been found to form radicals in sunlight, and therefore may be associated with cell damage as well. This only occurred when it was combined with other ingredients commonly found in sunscreens, like [[titanium oxide]] and [[octyl methoxycinnamate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Serpone | first1 = N | last2 = Salinaro | first2 = A | last3 = Emeline | first3 = AV | last4 = Horikoshi | first4 = S | last5 = Hidaka | first5 = H | last6 = Zhao | first6 = JC | year = 2002 | title = An in vitro systematic spectroscopic examination of the photostabilities of a random set of commercial sunscreen lotions and their chemical UVB/UVA active agents | url = | journal = Photochemical &amp; Photobiological Sciences | volume = 1 | issue = 12| pages = 970–81 | doi=10.1039/b206338g}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ROS attack the [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]], [[linoleic acid]], to form a series of [[13-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid]] and [[9-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid]] products that serve as signaling molecules that may trigger responses that counter the tissue injury which caused their formation.  ROS attacks other polyunsaturated fatty acids, e.g. [[arachidonic acid]] and [[docosahexaenoic acid]], to produce a similar series of signaling products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.3389/fphys.2013.00366 | volume=4 | title=Lipid peroxidation: pathophysiological and pharmacological implications in the eye | journal=Frontiers in Physiology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and nomenclature==
[[File:Gombergm01.jpg|right|thumb|[[Moses Gomberg]] (1866–1947), the founder of radical chemistry]]
Until late in the 20th century the word "radical" was used in chemistry to indicate any connected group of atoms, such as a [[methyl|methyl group]] or a [[carboxyl]], whether it was part of a larger molecule or a molecule on its own. The qualifier "free" was then needed to specify the unbound case.  Following recent nomenclature revisions, a part of a larger molecule is now called a [[functional group]] or [[substituent]], and "radical" now implies "free".  However, the old nomenclature may still appear in some books.

The term radical was already in use when the now obsolete [[radical theory]] was developed. [[Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau]] introduced the phrase "radical" in 1785 and the phrase was employed by [[Antoine Lavoisier]] in 1789 in his [[Traité Élémentaire de Chimie]]. A radical was then identified as the root base of certain acids (the Latin word "radix" meaning "root"). Historically, the term ''radical'' in [[radical theory]] was also used for bound parts of the molecule, especially when they remain unchanged in reactions. These are now called [[functional group]]s. For example, [[methanol|methyl alcohol]] was described as consisting of a methyl "radical" and a hydroxyl "radical". Neither are radicals in the modern chemical sense, as they are permanently bound to each other, and have no unpaired, reactive electrons; however, they can be observed as radicals in [[mass spectrometry]] when broken apart by irradiation with energetic electrons.

In a modern context the first [[organic compound|organic]] (carbon–containing) radical identified was [[triphenylmethyl radical]], (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C•.  This species was discovered by [[Moses Gomberg]] in 1900. In 1933 [[Morris S. Kharasch|Morris Kharash]] and [[Frank R. Mayo|Frank Mayo]] proposed that free radicals were responsible for [[anti-Markovnikov addition]] of [[hydrogen bromide]] to [[allyl bromide]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Peroxide Effect in the Addition of Reagents to Unsaturated Compounds. I. The Addition of Hydrogen Bromide to Allyl Bromide'' M.S. Kharasch, Frank R. Mayo J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1933, 55, pp. 2468–96 {{DOI|10.1021/ja01333a041}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Radicals: Reactive Intermediates with Translational Potential'' Ming Yan, Julian C. Lo, Jacob T. Edwards, and Phil S. Baran J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2016, 138 (39), pp. 12692–714 {{DOI|10.1021/jacs.6b08856}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most fields of chemistry, the historical definition of radicals contends that the molecules have nonzero electron spin. However, in fields including [[spectroscopy]], [[chemical reaction]], and [[astrochemistry]], the definition is slightly different. [[Gerhard Herzberg]], who won the Nobel prize for his research into the electron structure and geometry of radicals, suggested a looser definition of free radicals: "any transient (chemically unstable) species (atom, molecule, or ion)".&lt;ref&gt;G. Herzberg (1971), "The spectra and structures of simple free radicals", {{ISBN|0-486-65821-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The main point of his suggestion is that there are many chemically unstable molecules that have zero spin, such as C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and so on. This definition is more convenient for discussions of transient chemical processes and astrochemistry; therefore researchers in these fields prefer to use this loose definition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.free-radicals-symposium-05.ch/index2.html 28th International Symposium on Free Radicals] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716014949/http://www.free-radicals-symposium-05.ch/index2.html |date=2007-07-16 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnostics==
Radicals typically exhibit [[paramagnetism]], but the bulk magnetic properties of an ion or molecule are often not conveniently measured. [[Electron spin resonance]] is instead the definitive and most widely used technique for characterizing radicals.  The nature of the atom bearing the unpaired electron and its neighboring atoms can often be deduced by the EPR spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Electron Paramagnetic Resonance|last=Chechik|first=Victor|last2=Carter|first2=Emma|last3=Murphy|first3=Damien|year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-872760-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of radicals can also be detected or inferred by [[chemical trap|chemical reagents that trap]] (i.e. combine with) radicals. Often these traps are themselves radicals, such as [[TEMPO]].

'''Radical evil''' ({{lang-de|das radikal Böse}}) is a phrase used by German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] in ''[[Religion within the Bounds of Reason Alone]]'' (1793), one representing the Christian term, radix malorum.

There Kant writes:

{{quote|The depravity of human nature, then, is not so much to be called badness, if this word is taken in its strict sense, namely, as a disposition (subjective principle of maxims) to adopt the bad, as bad, into one’s maxims as a spring (for that is devilish); but rather perversity of heart, which, on account of the result, is also called a bad heart. This may co-exist with a Will [“Wille”] good in general, and arises from the frailty of human nature, which is not strong enough to follow its adopted principles, combined with its impurity in not distinguishing the springs (even of well-intentioned actions) from one another by moral rule. So that ultimately it looks at best only to the conformity of its actions with the law, not to their derivation from it, that is, to the law itself as the only spring. Now although this does not always give rise to wrong actions and a propensity thereto, that is, to vice, yet the habit of regarding the absence of vice as a conformity of the mind to the law of duty (as virtue) must itself be designated a radical perversity of the human heart (since in this case the spring in the maxims is not regarded at all, but only the obedience to the letter of the law).

The '''Radio Research Project''' was a [[social research]] project funded by the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] to look into the effects of mass media on society.&lt;ref&gt;La musa venal. Producción y consumo de la cultura industrial&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, the Rockefeller Foundation started funding research to find the effects of new forms of mass media on society, especially radio.  Several universities joined up and a headquarters was formed at the [[Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs|School of Public and International Affairs]] at [[Princeton University]].  

:A particularly influential program of effects research was pursued in the Office of Radio Research (ORR) established by the Rockefeller Foundation under the auspices of Princeton University. Managed by [[Paul Lazarsfeld]], Austrian émigré psychologist, the program was overseen by [[Hadley Cantril]], Princeton psychologist, and [[Frank Stanton (executive)|Frank Stanton]], director of research at CBS. The program was designed by Cantril and Stanton to determine why  people listened to radio. Stanton, a psychological researcher who soon became CBS president, was naturally interested in what lured people to programs and to what extent a program and its [[ad]]s boosted sales of products.&lt;ref&gt;J. Michael Sproule (1997) ''Propaganda and Democracy'', page 64, [[Cambridge University Press]] {{ISBN|0-521-47022-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the subjects of the Project's first studies were [[soap opera]]s, known as [[radio drama]]s at the time.

The Radio Project also conducted research on the infamous [[Halloween]] broadcast of ''[[The War of the Worlds (radio)|The War of the Worlds]]'' in 1938. Of the estimated 6 million people who heard this broadcast, they found that 25% accepted the program's reports of mass destruction. The majority of these did not think they were hearing a literal invasion from Mars, but rather an attack by Germany. The researchers determined that radio broadcasts from the [[Munich Crisis]] may have lent credence to this supposition.

A third research project was that of listening habits. Because of this, a new method was developed to survey an audience – this was dubbed the [[Little Annie Project]]. The official name was the [[Stanton-Lazarsfeld Program Analyzer]]. This allowed one not only to find out if a listener liked the performance, but how they felt at any individual moment, through a dial which they would turn to express their preference (positive or negative). This has since become an essential tool in focus group research.

[[Theodor Adorno]] produced numerous reports on the effects of "atomized listening" which radio supported and of which he was highly critical. However, because of profound methodological disagreements with Lazarsfeld over the use of techniques such as listener surveys and "Little Annie" (Adorno thought both grossly simplified and ignored the degree to which expressed tastes were the result of commercial marketing), Adorno left the project in 1941.

A '''reading disability''' is a condition in which a sufferer displays difficulty reading. Examples of reading disabilities include: [[Dyslexia|Developmental Dyslexia]], [[Alexia (acquired dyslexia)]], and [[Hyperlexia]] (word-reading ability well above normal for age and IQ).

==Definition==
[[National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke]] defines reading disability or dyslexia as follows: "Dyslexia is a brain-based type of learning disability that specifically impairs a person's ability to read. These individuals typically read at levels significantly lower than expected despite having normal intelligence. Although the disorder varies from person to person, common characteristics among people with dyslexia are difficulty with spelling, phonological processing (the manipulation of sounds), and/or rapid visual-verbal responding. In adults, dyslexia usually occurs after a brain injury or in the context of dementia. It can also be inherited in some families, and recent studies have identified a number of genes that may predispose an individual to developing dyslexia." &lt;ref&gt;{{NINDS|dyslexia}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The NINDS definition is not in keeping with the bulk of scientific studies that conclude that there is no evidence to suggest that dyslexia and intelligence are related. The Rose Review 2009&lt;ref name="Identifying and Teaching Children and Young People with Dyslexia and Literacy Difficulties"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rose|first1=James|title=Sir|url=http://dera.ioe.ac.uk/14790/7/00659-2009DOM-EN_Redacted.pdf|website=Institute of Education|publisher=United Kingdom Government|accessdate=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Definition is more in keeping with modern research and debunked discrepancy model of dyslexia diagnosis:&lt;ref name="Discrepancy Definitions of Reading Disability: Has Intelligence Led Us Astray?"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stanovich|first1=K|title=
Discrepancy Definitions of Reading Disability: Has Intelligence Led Us Astray? |journal=Reading Research Quarterly|date=Winter 1991|volume=26|issue=1|pages=7–29|jstor=747729}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Dyslexia is a learning difficulty that primarily affects the skills involved in accurate and fluent word reading and spelling.
*Characteristic features of dyslexia are difficulties in phonological awareness, verbal memory and verbal processing speed.
*Dyslexia occurs across the range of intellectual abilities.
*It is best thought of as a continuum, not a distinct category, and there are no clear cut-off points.
*Co-occurring difficulties may be seen in aspects of language, motor co-ordination, mental calculation, concentration and personal organisation, but these are not, by themselves, markers of dyslexia.
*A good indication of the severity and persistence of dyslexic difficulties can be gained by examining how the individual responds or has responded to well founded intervention.

===Dyslexia===
{{Main article|Dyslexia}}
Dyslexia is a [[learning disability]] that manifests itself as a difficulty with word decoding and/or reading fluency. Comprehension may be affected as a result of difficulties with decoding, but is not a primary feature of dyslexia. It is separate and distinct from reading difficulties resulting from other causes, such as a non-neurological deficiency with vision or hearing, or from poor or inadequate [[reading instruction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stanovich KE |title=Explaining the differences between the dyslexic and the garden-variety poor reader: the phonological-core variable-difference model |journal=Journal of Learning Disabilities |volume=21 |issue=10 |pages=590–604 |date=December 1988 |pmid=2465364 |doi=10.1177/002221948802101003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that dyslexia affects between 5–17% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McCandliss BD, Noble KG |title=The development of reading impairment: a cognitive neuroscience model |journal=Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=196–204 |year=2003 |pmid=12953299 |doi=10.1002/mrdd.10080 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Czepita2006 &gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Czepita D, Lodygowska E |title=[Role of the organ of vision in the course of developmental dyslexia] |language=Polish |journal=Klin Oczna |volume=108 |issue=1–3 |pages=110–3 |year=2006 |pmid=16883955 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Birsh2005"&gt;{{cite book |last=Birsh |first=Judith R. |year=2005 |chapter=Research and reading disability |editor=Judith R.

==Research==
Rice ECE Faculty perform research in the following areas: [[Computer Engineering]]; Data Science, [[Neuroengineering]]; [[Photonics]], Electronics and [[Nanodevices|Nano-devices]], and Systems.&lt;ref name=research&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ece.rice.edu/research/|title=ECE Research|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rice has a long history in [[digital signal processing]] (DSP) dating back to its inception in the late 1960s.

Computer Engineering faculty have a research focus in analog and mixed-signal design, [[VLSI]] signal processing, [[computer architecture]] and [[embedded systems]], [[biosensors]] and [[computer vision]], and hardware security and storage systems, including applications to education. Biosensors and mobile wireless healthcare are growing application areas in embedded systems research. [[Smartphones]] with imaging devices are leading to new areas in computer vision and sensing. In the area of computer architecture, research interests include parallel computing, large-scale storage systems, and resource scheduling for performance and power.

Data Science faculty integrate the foundations, tools and techniques involving data acquisition (sensors and systems), [[data analytics]] ([[machine learning]], [[statistics]]), data storage and computing infrastructure (GPU/CPU computing, [[FPGA]]s, [[cloud computing]], security and privacy) in order to enable meaningful extraction of actionable information from diverse and potentially massive data sources.

Neuroengineering faculty are members of the [[Rice Center for Neuroengineering]], a collaborative effort with [[Texas Medical Center]] researchers. They develop technology for treating and diagnosing [[neural disease]]s. Current research areas include interrogating [[neural circuits]] at the cellular level, analyzing neuronal data in real-time, and manipulating healthy or diseased neural circuit activity and connectivity using [[nanoelectronics|nano electronics]], [[optics]], and emerging [[photonics]] technologies.

Photonics, Electronics and Nano-device researchers focus on [[nanophotonics]] and [[plasmonic]]s, optical [[nanosensor]] and nano-actuator development, studies of new materials, in particular [[nanomaterials]] and magnetically active materials; imaging and image processing, including [[multispectral imaging]] and [[terahertz imaging]]; ultrafast spectroscopy and dynamics; laser applications in remote and point sensing, especially for trace gas detection;&lt;ref name=tittel&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ece.rice.edu/Content.aspx?id=2147484234|title=Tittel Receives Award from Welch Foundation|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; nanometer-scale characterization of surfaces, molecules, and devices; [[organic semiconductor]] devices; single-molecule transistors; and applications of [[Nanoshells]] in biomedicine.

Current Rice ECE Systems research spans a wide range of areas including image and video analysis, representation, and compression; [[wavelets]] and multiscale methods; [[statistical signal processing]], [[pattern recognition]], and learning theory; distributed signal processing and sensor networks; communication systems; computational neuroscience; and wireless networking.

[[Image:Banksia serrata2.jpg|thumb|right|Fire has triggered the opening of the [[follicle (fruit)|follicles]] and the release of seed in this ''[[Banksia serrata]]'' fruiting structure]]
'''Serotiny''' is an [[ecological]] adaptation exhibited by some [[seed plant]]s, in which seed release occurs in response to an environmental trigger, rather than spontaneously at seed maturation.&lt;ref name="Lamont 1991 277–317"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lamont|first=B.|author2=Lemaitre, D. |author3=Cowling, R. |author4=Enright, N. |title=Canopy seed storage in woody-plants|journal=Botanical Review|year=1991|volume=57|issue=4|pages=277–317 |doi=10.1007/bf02858770}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common and best studied trigger is [[fire]]. However, the term ''serotiny'' refers more broadly to plants that release their seeds over a long period of time, irrespective of the trigger or whether release is spontaneous.&lt;ref name="Lamont 1991 277–317"/&gt; In this sense, the term is synonymous with [[bradyspory]].

Possible triggers include:
* Death of the parent plant or branch (necriscence, this death can be caused by fire)
* Wetting (hygriscence)
* Warming by the sun (soliscence)
* Drying atmospheric conditions (xeriscence)
* Fire (heat, essentially: pyriscence)
* Fire followed by wetting (pyrohydriscence)
Fire is the most common and best studied case.&lt;ref name="Lamont 1991 277–317"/&gt; Some plants may respond to more than one of these triggers. For example, ''[[Pinus halepensis]]'' exhibits primarily fire-mediated serotiny,&lt;ref name=Hernandez2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hernández-Serrano|first=A|author2=Verdú M. |author3=González-Martínez S.C. |author4=Pausas J.G. |title=Fire structures pine serotiny at different scales|journal=American Journal of Botany|year=2013|doi=10.3732/ajb.1300182|url=http://www.uv.es/jgpausas/papers/Hernandez-2013-AmJBot-serotiny.pdf |volume=100 |pages=2349–2356 |pmid=24222682}}&lt;/ref&gt; but responds weakly to drying atmospheric conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nathan|first=R|author2=Safriel, U. |author3=Noy-Meir, I. |author4=Schiller, G. |title=Seed release without fire in Pinus halepensis, a Mediterranean serotinous wind-dispersed tree|journal=Journal of Ecology|year=1999|volume=87|issue=4|pages=659–669 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2745.1999.00382.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Sierras sequoias and some ''[[Banksia]]'' species are strongly serotinous with respect to fire, but also release some seed in response to plant or branch death.

Serotiny can occur in various degrees. Plants that retain all of their seed indefinitely in the absence of a trigger event are strongly serotinous. Plants that eventually release some of their seed spontaneously in the absence of a trigger are weakly serotinous. Finally, some plants release all of their seed spontaneously after a period of seed storage, but the occurrence of a trigger event curtails the seed storage period, causing all seed to be released immediately; such plants are essentially non-serotinous, or facultatively serotinous.

==Fire-mediated serotiny==
In the [[southern hemisphere]], fire-mediated serotiny is found in [[angiosperms]] in fire-prone parts of [[Australia]] and [[South Africa]]. It is extremely common in the [[Proteaceae]] of these areas, and also occurs in other taxa, such as ''[[Eucalyptus]]'' ([[Myrtaceae]]) and even exceptionally in ''[[Erica sessiliflora]]'' ([[Ericaceae]]).

Thus the follicles open after fire, but seed release does not occur. As the cone dries, wetting by rain or humidity causes the cone scales to expand and reflex, promoting seed release.&lt;ref name=Dawson1997&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dawson|first=C|author2=Vincent JFV |author3=Rocca A-M |title=How pine cones open|journal=Nature|year=1997|volume=390|pages=668–668|doi=10.1038/37745|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v390/n6661/abs/390668a0.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seed separator thus acts as a lever against the seeds, gradually prying them out of the follicle over the course of one or more wet-dry cycles. The effect of this adaptation is to ensure that seed release occurs not in response to fire, but in response to the onset of rains following fire. Flammability is also related to serotinous species such as Gamba Grass.

The relative importance of serotiny can vary among populations of the same plant species. For example, North American populations of lodgepole pine (''[[Pinus contorta]]'') can vary from being highly serotinous to having no serotiny at all, opening annually to release seed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Muir | first1 = P.

Red squirrels (''[[Red squirrel|Sciurus vulgaris]]'') and red crossbills (''[[Red crossbill|Loxia curvirostra]]'') will eat seeds, and so serotinous cones, which last in the canopy longer, are more likely to be chosen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Benkman | first1 = C.W. | last2 = Holimon | first2 = W.C. | last3 = Smith | first3 = J.W. | year = 2001 | title = The influence of a competitor on the geographic mosaic of coevolution between crossbills and lodgepole pine | url = | journal = Evolution | volume = 55 | issue = | pages = 282–294 | doi = 10.1554/0014-3820(2001)055[0282:TIOACO]2.0.CO;2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Talluto | first1 = M.

Pyriscence can be understood as an adaptation to an environment in which fires are regular, and in which post-fire environments offer the best germination and seedling survival rates. In Australia, for example, fire-mediated serotiny occurs in areas that are not only prone to regular fires, but also possess [[oligotrophic]] soils and a seasonally dry climate. This results in intense competition for nutrients and moisture, leading to very low seedling survival rates. The passage of fire, however, reduces competition by clearing out undergrowth, and results in an [[ash bed]] that temporarily increases soil nutrition; thus the survival rates of post-fire seedlings is greatly increased. Furthermore, releasing a large number of seeds at once, rather than gradually, increases the possibility that some of those seeds will escape predation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bradshaw|first=S. Don |author2=Kingsley W. Dixon |author3=Stephen D. Hopper |author4=Hans Lambers |author5=Shane R. Turner |title=Little evidence for fire-adapted plant traits in Mediterranean climate regions|journal=Trends in Plant Science|year=2011|volume=16|issue=2|pages=69–76|doi=10.1016/j.tplants.2010.10.007|pmid=21095155}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar pressures apply in Northern Hemisphere conifer forests, but in this case there is the further issue of [[allelopathic]] leaf litter, which suppresses seed germination. Fire clears out this litter, eliminating this obstacle to germination.

==Evolution==
Serotinous adaptations occur in at least 530 species in 40 genera, in multiple (paraphyletic) lineages.  Serotiny likely evolved separately in these species, but may in some cases have been lost by the related non-serotinous species.

In the genus ''Pinus'', serotiny likely evolved because of the atmospheric conditions during the [[Cretaceous]] period.&lt;ref name="He2012" /&gt; The atmosphere during the Cretaceous had higher oxygen and carbon dioxide levels than our atmosphere. Fire occurred more frequently than it does currently, and plant growth was high enough to create an abundance of flammable material. Many ''Pinus'' species adapted to this fire-prone environment with serotinous pine cones.

A set of conditions must be met in order for long-term seed storage to be evolutionarily viable for a plant:
* The plant must be phylogenetically able (pre-adapted) to develop the necessary reproductive structures
* The seeds must remain viable until cued to release
* Seed release must be cued by a trigger that indicates environmental conditions that are favorable to germination,
* The cue must occur on an average timescale that is within the reproductive lifespan of the plant
* The plant must have the capacity and opportunity to produce enough seeds prior to release to ensure population replacement&lt;ref name="Lamont 1991 277–317"/&gt;
* Serotiny must be heritable&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hernández-Serrano|first1=Ana|title=Heritability and quantitative genetic divergence of serotiny, a fire-persistence plant trait|journal=Annals of Botany|date=2014|volume=114|pages=571–577|doi=10.1093/aob/mcu142|url=http://www.uv.es/jgpausas/papers/Hernandez-2014-AnnBot_heritability-serotiny.pdf|pmid=25008363|pmc=4204669}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Ronan Point - Daily Telegraph.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Ronan Point, following the gas explosion.]] --&gt;
'''Robustness''' is the ability of a structure to withstand events like fire, explosions, impact or the consequences of [[human error]], without being damaged to an extent disproportionate to the original cause - as defined in EN 1991-1-7 of the Accidental Actions [[Eurocode]].&lt;ref name=1991-1-7&gt;{{cite book|title=EN 1991-1-7 Eurocode 1 - Actions on structures - Part 1-7: General actions - Accidental actions|publisher=CEN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A structure [[Structural design|designed]] and [[construction|constructed]] to be robust should not suffer from [[disproportionate collapse]] (progressive collapse) under accidental loading.&lt;ref name=steel&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.steelconstruction.info/Structural_robustness|title=Structural robustness|publisher=SteelConstruction.info|accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buildings of some kinds, especially [[large-panel system building | large-panel system]]s and [[precast concrete]] buildings, are disproportionately more susceptible to collapse; others, such as [[reinforced concrete|in situ cast concrete structures]], are disproportionately less susceptible. The method employed in making a structure robust will typically depend on and be tailored to the kind of structure it is, as in [[steel frame]]d building structural robustness is typically achieved through appropriately designing the system of connections between the frame's constituents.&lt;ref name=steel /&gt;

==Design considerations==
Three alternative measures are used, sometimes jointly, to achieve structural robustness and reduce the risk of disproportionate collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pci.org/resources/sustainability/cfcs/cmsIT/baseComponents/fileManagerProxy.cfc?method=GetFile&amp;fileID=44F28004-F174-BEA5-48CC735D83EBA0B0|title=FIB bulletin 43 Structural connections for precast concrete buildings|publisher=FIB|accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dec.fct.unl.pt/sites/www.dec.fct.unl.pt/files/documentos/formacao/ispcs/accidental_actions.pdf|title=International seminar on Precast Concrete Structures Accidental Actions and Progressive Collapse Arnold Van Acker|publisher=Department of Civil Engineering Universidade Nova de Lisboa|accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These are: 
* Reducing the possibility of occurrence of accidental loading.
* Preventing the propagation of a possible initial failure and increasing redundancy. Which includes the indirect method and the alternative load path method.
* Designing the structure to withstand accidental loading. Sometimes referred to as specific load resistance method.

==Robustness requirements in Eurocodes==
The requirements for structures in consequence classes 2 and 3 can be found in [[EN_1991#Part_1-7:_General_actions_-_Accidental_Actions|EN 1991-1-7]] Eurocode 1 - Actions on structures - Part 1-7: General actions - Accidental actions. Additional requirements and requirements for structures in consequence class 1 can be found in the material specific Eurocode parts, [[EN 1992]] for concrete structures, [[EN 1993]] for steel structures and so on.

In EN 1991-1-7 buildings are categorised in consequences classes, considering the building type, occupancy and size.&lt;ref name=1991-1-7 /&gt;

'''Consequence class 1''', low consequences of failure:
*Single occupancy houses not exceeding 4 storeys.
*Agricultural buildings.
*Buildings into which people rarely go, provided no part of the building is closer to another building, or area where people do go, than a distance of 1.5 times the building height.

'''Consequence class 2a''', lower risk group - medium consequences of failure: 
*5 storey single occupancy houses.
*Hotels not exceeding 4 storeys.
*Flats, apartments and other residential buildings not exceeding 4 storeys.
*Offices not exceeding 4 storeys.
*Industrial buildings not exceeding 3 storeys.
*Retail premises not exceeding 3 storeys of less than 1000 m² floor area in each storey.
*Single storey educational buildings.
*All buildings not exceeding two storeys to which the public are admitted and which contain floor areas not exceeding 2000 m² at each storey.

'''Consequence class 2b''', upper risk group - medium consequences of failure: 
*Hotels, flats, apartments and other residential buildings greater than 4 storeys but not exceeding 15 storeys.
*Educational buildings greater than single storey but not exceeding 15 storeys.
*Retail premises greater than 3 storeys but not exceeding 15 storeys.
*Hospitals not exceeding 3 storeys.
*Offices greater than 4 storeys but not exceeding 15 storeys.
*All buildings to which the public are admitted and which contain floor areas exceeding 2000 m² but not exceeding 5000 m² at each storey.
*Car parking not exceeding 6 storeys.

'''Consequence class 3''', high consequences of failure:
*All buildings defined above as Class 2 Lower and Upper Consequences Class that exceed the limits on area and number of storeys.
*All buildings to which members of the public are admitted in significant numbers.
*Stadia accommodating more than 5000 spectators.
*Buildings containing hazardous substances and / or processes.

For buildings intended for more than one type of use, the consequences class should be that of the most onerous type.&lt;ref name=steel /&gt;

Buildings in consequence class 1 should be designed and constructed in accordance with EN 1990 - 1999 for satisfying stability in normal use, no specific consideration (required by EN 1991-1-7) is necessary with regard to accidental actions from unidentified causes.

Buildings in consequence class 2a (in addition to what is recommended for consequence class 1) should be provided with effective horizontal ties, or effective anchorage of suspended floors to walls.

Buildings in consequence class 2b (in addition to what is recommended for consequence class 1 and 2a) should be provided with effective vertical ties in all supporting columns and walls, or alternatively the building should be checked to ensure that upon the notional removal of each supporting column and each beam supporting a column, or any nominal section of load-bearing wall (one at a time in each storey of the building) the building remains stable and the local damage does not exceed a certain limit. Where the removal of such columns and sections of walls would result in an extent of damage in excess of the agreed limit, such elements should be designed as a key element.

For buildings in consequence class 3 a systematic risk assessment of the building taking into account both foreseeable and unforeseeable hazards, is required.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6157">The '''Tanner scale''' (also known as the '''Tanner stages''') is a scale of [[Child development|physical development in children]], [[adolescent]]s and [[adult]]s. The scale defines physical measurements of development based on external [[primary sex characteristic|primary]] and [[secondary sex characteristic]]s, such as the size of the [[breast]]s, [[genitals]], testicular volume and development of [[Pubic hair|pubic]] hair. This scale was first identified by [[James Mourilyan Tanner|James Tanner]], a British pediatrician, and thus bears his name.&lt;ref&gt;{{WhoNamedIt|synd|3082|Tanner's stages}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid5440182"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Marshall WA, Tanner JM |title=Variations in the pattern of pubertal changes in boys|journal=Arch.

Due to [[Human variability|natural variation]], individuals pass through the Tanner stages at different rates, depending in particular on the timing of [[puberty]]. In [[HIV]] treatment, the Tanner scale is used to determine which treatment regimen to follow (adult, adolescent or pediatric).
==Definitions of stages==
Adapted from text by Lawrence Neinstein, M.D.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chla.org/profile/lawrence-neinstein-md Lawrence S. Neinstein, M.D.: Adolescent Medicine - Children's Hospital Los Angeles CA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307161350/http://www.chla.org/profile/lawrence-neinstein-md |date=2016-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genitals (male)===
[[File:Tanner scale-male.svg|166px|thumb|Illustration of the Tanner scale for males.]]
; Tanner I
: [[Testicle|testicular]] volume less than 1.5 [[liter|ml]]; small penis (prepubertal; typically age nine and younger)
; Tanner II
: testicular volume between 1.6 and 6 ml; skin on scrotum thins, reddens and enlarges; penis length unchanged (9–11)
; Tanner III
: testicular volume between 6 and 12 ml; scrotum enlarges further; penis begins to lengthen (11–12.5)
; Tanner IV
: testicular volume between 12 and 20 ml; scrotum enlarges further and darkens; penis increases in length (12.5–14)
; Tanner V
: testicular volume greater than 20 ml; adult scrotum and penis (14+)

===Breasts (female)===
[[File:Tanner scale-female.svg|240px|thumb|Illustration of the Tanner scale for females.]]
; Tanner  I
: no glandular tissue: [[areola]] follows the skin contours of the chest (prepubertal) (typically age 10 and younger)
; Tanner II
: [[Thelarche|breast bud]] forms, with small area of surrounding glandular tissue; areola begins to widen (10–11.5)
; Tanner III
: breast begins to become more elevated, and extends beyond the borders of the areola, which continues to widen but remains in contour with surrounding breast (11.5–13)
; Tanner IV
: increased breast sizing and elevation; areola and [[nipple|papilla]] form a secondary mound projecting from the contour of the surrounding breast (13–15)
; Tanner V
: breast reaches final adult size; areola returns to contour of the surrounding breast, with a projecting central papilla. (15+)

===Pubic hair (both male and female)===

; Tanner I
: no pubic hair at all ([[Puberty|prepubertal]]) (typically age 10 and younger)
; Tanner II
: small amount of long, downy hair with slight pigmentation at the base of the [[human penis|penis]] and [[scrotum]] (males) or on the [[labia majora]] (females) (10–11.5)
; Tanner III
: hair becomes more coarse and curly, and begins to extend laterally (11.5–13)
; Tanner IV
: adult–like hair quality, extending across [[mons pubis|pubis]] but sparing medial thighs (13–15)
; Tanner V
: hair extends to medial surface of the thighs (15+)

==Criticism==
The scale has been criticized by the [[pornography]] industry for its potential to lead to false [[child pornography]] convictions, such as in the case when United States federal authorities used it to assert that pornographic actress [[Lupe Fuentes]] was underage. Fuentes personally appeared at the trial and provided documentation that showed that the DVDs in question were legally produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://business.avn.com/articles/Lupe-Fuentes-Saves-Man-From-Bogus-Child-Porn-Charge-394003.html |title=Lupe Fuentes Saves Man From Bogus ‘Child Porn’ Charge|date=April 16, 2010|work=AVN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adult Film Star Verifies Her Age, Saves Fan From 20 Years In Prison|url=http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2010/04/adult-film-star-verifies-her-age-saves-fan-20-years-prison |work=Radar Online|date=April 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tanner, the author of the classification system, has argued that age classification using the stages of the scale represents invalid use. Tanner stages do not match with chronological age, but rather maturity stages and thus are not diagnostic for age estimation.&lt;ref name="pmid9882230"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosenbloom|first=AL|author2=Tanner, JM |title=Misuse of Tanner puberty stages to estimate chronologic age.|journal=Pediatrics|date=December 1998|volume=102|issue=6|page=1494|doi=10.1542/peds.102.6.1494|pmid=9882230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''tenement''' (from the Latin [[wiktionary:tenere#Latin|tenere]] ''to hold''), in law, is anything that is held, rather than owned.  This usage is a holdover from [[feudalism]], which still forms the basis of all real-estate law in the English-speaking world, in which the [[monarch]] alone owned the [[allodial title]] to all the land within his [[Realm|kingdom]].

Under feudalism, land itself was never privately "owned" but rather was "held" by a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (from Latin ''teneo'' "to hold") as a [[Fee (feudal tenure)|fee]], being merely a legal right over land known in modern law as an [[estate in land]]. This was held from a superior [[lord|overlord]], ( a [[mesne lord]]), or from [[The Crown|the crown]] itself in which case the holder was termed a [[tenant-in-chief]], upon some manner of service under one of a variety of [[feudal land tenure]]s.  The thing held is called a tenement, the holder is called a [[leasehold estate|tenant]], the manner of his holding is called a [[tenure]], and the superior is called the [[landlord]], or lord of the fee. These forms are still preserved in law, even though feudalism itself is extinct, because all real estate law has developed from them over centuries.

[[Feudal land tenure]] existed in many varieties. The sole surviving form in the United States is that species of [[freehold (law)|freehold]] known as ''free [[socage]]''. Here the service to be performed is known and fixed, and not of a base or servile nature; the "lord of the fee" is the State itself, and the service due to this "lord" is payment of the taxes upon the real estate.  The major consequences, in the modern world, of this feudal approach, as distinguished from ownership, are, first, the [[wiktionary:forfeit|forfeiture]] of the tenement upon failure to perform the service (that is, non-payment of taxes), and second, the doctrine of [[eminent domain]], whereby the "lord of the fee" might take back the estate, provided he make [[just compensation]]. Also existing in a vestigial form is the concept of [[escheat]], under which an estate of a holder without heirs returns to the ownership of the state.

An interesting side effect of this is that government entities do not pay real estate taxes to other government entities since government entities own the land rather than hold the land.  Localities that depend on real estate taxes to provide services are often put at a disadvantage when the state or federal government acquires a piece of land.  Sometimes, to mollify local public opinion, the state or federal government may volunteer to make payments in lieu of taxes ([[PILOT (finance)|PILOT]] or PILT programs) to local governments.

'''''The Historical Novel''''' is a 1924 book by [[Herbert Butterfield]]. It originated in an undergraduate essay and gained the Le Bas Prize for Butterfield. It was originally published by [[Cambridge University Press]], one of the conditions for the prize.

==Summary==
The work was Butterfield's first publication. It developed from the embryo of a paper, presented to the Peterhouse History Society in the Michaelmas term, which he then expanded.

It examines the relationship between the form of the [[Historical fiction#Historical novel|historical novel]] on the one hand and the formal study of history on the other. It explores the style of historical fictions, the way in which they engage with evidence (and how that differs from the orthodox [[historical method]]) and the extent to which such a form of writing affects mainstream historical scholarship itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Historical Novel|url=http://www.cambridge.org/gb/academic/subjects/history/regional-and-world-history-general-interest/historical-novel-essay|website=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Butterfield sees the historical novel as a form which is a kind of 'fusion' of other styles and approaches. In particular, he sees a potential in it for a form of historical empathy that can provide deep insights into the motivations behind the actions of historical protagonists such as [[Napoleon]]; it can also be used to marshall a sense of nationalistic or patriot feeling becoming, itself, a "maker of history" rather than merely a reflector or mirror of the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Groot|first1=Jerome|title=The Historical Novel|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=113525320X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=82avWVrVeukC&amp;pg=PT3&amp;lpg=PT3&amp;dq=%22Historical+Novel%22+Butterfield&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Fq9dzFHgBi&amp;sig=VSrtwqcq63ddSQzblX0xd-Z_smw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ftXTU-HTH-zZ0QWA5YCgAQ&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Historical%20Novel%22%20Butterfield&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of its purposes, according to Butterfield, was to help us 'feel' a particular epoch of the past in ways in which traditional historical writing might not because of the different role and importance of the imagination in the case of the historical novel. Another important element of historical fiction for Butterfield was its role in bringing to light the existence of uncertainty in human affairs as lived by real people: the historian, in his view, tends to have a retrospective reach which draws out trajectories and processes over time, but the characters in a historical novel live as real human beings do, being only aware of probabilities and potential situations rather than knowing precisely where certain events and phenomena are headed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lowenthal|first1=David|title=The Past is a Foreign Country|date=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521294800|pages=226–227|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jMqsAQZmv5IC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;dq=%22Historical+Novel%22+Butterfield&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=G9jTU_bFBcOV7AbymYFw&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Historical%20Novel%22%20Butterfield&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work did not display Butterfield's later detestation of the form of the historical novel; later on, moreover, he referred to the arguments in his first publication in disparaging terms, arguing that it was 'a bad book'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bentley|first1=Michael|title=The Life and Thought of Herbert Butterfield: History, Science and God|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=1139502859|pages=45–6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c1r2DMbwZegC&amp;pg=PT52&amp;dq=%22Historical+Novel%22+Butterfield&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sNbTU86WN8_H7AaE_ID4CA&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Historical%20Novel%22%20Butterfield&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 17, 2012, at ''Rocknest'', the first [[X-ray crystallography#Mineralogy and metallurgy|X-ray diffraction analysis]] of [[Martian soil]] was performed. The results revealed the presence of several minerals, including [[feldspar]], [[pyroxene]]s and [[olivine]], and suggested that the Martian soil in the sample was similar to the weathered basaltic soils of [[Hawaii Volcanoes|Hawaiian volcanoes]]. The sample used is composed of [[dust]] distributed from [[Martian soil#Atmospheric dust|global dust storms]] and local fine sand. So far, the materials ''Curiosity'' has analyzed are consistent with the initial ideas of deposits in Gale Crater recording a transition through time from a wet to dry environment.&lt;ref name="NASA-20121030"&gt;{{cite web |last=Brown |first=Dwayne |title=NASA Rover's First Soil Studies Help Fingerprint Martian Minerals|url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2012/oct/HQ_12-383_Curiosity_CheMin.html |date=October 30, 2012 |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=October 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On November 22, 2012, the ''Curiosity'' rover analyzed a rock named "[[Rocknest 3 (rock)|Rocknest 3]]" with the [[Curiosity rover#Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS)|APXS]] and then resumed traveling toward "Point Lake" overlook on its way to [[Glenelg, Mars|Glenelg Intrigue]].&lt;ref name="Space-20121122"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=Thanksgiving on Mars: Working Holiday for Curiosity Rover |url=http://www.space.com/18594-mars-thanksgiving-curiosity-rover.html |date=November 22, 2012 |publisher=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=November 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 3, 2012, NASA reported that ''[[Curiosity (rover)|Curiosity]]'' performed its first extensive [[soil analysis]], revealing the presence of [[Water on Mars|water molecules]], [[sulfur]] and [[chlorine]] in the [[Martian soil]].&lt;ref name="NASA-20121203"&gt;{{cite web |last=Brown |first=Dwayne |last2=Webster |first2=Guy |last3=Neal-Jones |first3=Nancy |title=NASA Mars Rover Fully Analyzes First Martian Soil Samples |url=http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/news/whatsnew/index.cfm?FuseAction=ShowNews&amp;NewsID=1399 |date=December 3, 2012 |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=December 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20121203"&gt;{{cite web |last=Chang |first=Ken |title=Mars Rover Discovery Revealed |url=http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/03/mars-rover-discovery-revealed |date=December 3, 2012 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=December 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The presence of [[perchlorates]] in the sample seems highly likely. The presence of [[sulfate]] and [[sulfide]] is also likely because [[sulfur dioxide]] and [[hydrogen sulfide]] were detected. Small amounts of [[chloromethane]], [[dichloromethane]] and [[trichloromethane]] were detected. The source of the carbon in these molecules is unclear.

Using SAM's [[mass spectrometer]], scientists measured [[isotopes]] of [[helium]], [[neon]], and [[argon]] that [[cosmic rays]] produce as they go through rock. The fewer of these isotopes they find, the more recently the rock has been exposed near the surface. The 4-billion-year-old lakebed rock drilled by ''Curiosity'' was uncovered between 30 million and 110 million years ago by winds which sandblasted away 2 meters of overlying rock. Next, they hope to find a site tens of millions of years younger by drilling close to an overhanging outcrop.&lt;ref name="SCI-2013-Farley"&gt;{{cite journal |date=2013 |title=In Situ Radiometric and Exposure Age Dating of the Martian Surface |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume=343 |issue=6169 |pages=1247166 |doi=10.1126/science.1247166 |displayauthors=1 |last1=Farley |first1=K.

The absorbed dose and dose equivalent from galactic cosmic rays and [[solar energetic particle]]s on the Martian surface for ~300 days of observations during the current solar maximum was measured. These measurements are necessary for human missions to the surface of Mars, to provide microbial survival times of any possible extant or past life, and to determine how long potential organic [[biosignature]]s can be preserved.  This study estimates that a 1-meter depth drill is necessary to access possible viable [[radioresistant]] microbe cells.  The actual absorbed dose measured by the [[Radiation assessment detector|Radiation Assessment Detector]] (RAD) is 76 mGy/yr at the surface.  Based on these measurements, for a round trip Mars surface mission with 180 days (each way) cruise, and 500 days on the Martian surface for this current solar cycle, an astronaut would be exposed to a total mission dose equivalent of ~1.01 [[sievert]]. Exposure to 1 sievert is associated with a 5 percent increase in risk for developing fatal cancer. NASA's current lifetime limit for increased risk for its astronauts operating in low-Earth orbit is 3 percent.&lt;ref name="SREF-20131209"&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff |title=Understanding Mars' Past and Current Environments|url=http://spaceref.com/mars/understanding-mars-past-and-current-environments.html|date=December 9, 2013 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=December 20, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Maximum shielding from galactic cosmic rays can be obtained with about 3 meters of [[Martian soil]].&lt;ref name="SCI-2013-Hassler"&gt;{{cite journal|date=2013 |title=Mars' Surface Radiation Environment Measured with the Mars Science Laboratory's Curiosity Rover|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume=343 |issue=6169 |pages=1244797 |doi=10.1126/science.1244797 |displayauthors=1 |last1=Hassler |first1=D.

On December 17, 2015, NASA reported that as ''Curiosity'' climbed higher up Mount Sharp, the composition of rocks were changing substantially. For example, rocks found higher up the mountain contained much higher levels of [[silica]] than the [[Basalt|basaltic rocks]] found earlier. After further analysis, the silica-rich rocks on Mars were found to be [[Tridymite#Mars|tridymite]], a mineral that is not commonly found on Earth.

They can arise within a short time and then persist for weeks to months. During the southern season of summer, the sunlight heats dust particles and brings them higher into the atmosphere. This creates wind, which in turn stirs up more dust. This results in a feedback loop that scientists are still trying to understand. NASA reported on June 20, 2018 that the dust storm had grown to completely cover the entire planet.&lt;ref name="NASA-20180620"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Shekhtman |first1=Lonnie |last2=Good |first2=Andrew |title=Martian Dust Storm Grows Global; Curiosity Captures Photos of Thickening Haze |url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7164 |date=June 20, 2018 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=June 21, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SPC-20180621"&gt;{{cite web |last=Malik |first=Tariq |title=Epic Dust Storm on Mars Now Completely Covers the Red Planet |url=https://www.space.com/40952-mars-dust-storm-2018-covers-entire-planet.html |date=June 21, 2018 |work=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=June 21, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 7, 2018, NASA announced a cyclical seasonal variation in atmospheric [[methane]], as well as the presence of  [[kerogen]] and other complex [[organic compound]]s. The organic compounds were from [[mudstone]] rocks aged approximately 3.5 billion years old, sampled from two distinct sites in a dry lake in the [[Pahrump Hills]] of the [[Gale (crater)|Gale crater]]. The rock samples, when [[Pyrolysis|pyrolyzed]] via the ''Curiosity''{{'}}s [[Sample Analysis at Mars]] instrument, released an array of organic molecules; these include sulfur-containing [[thiophene]]s, [[aromatic]] compounds such as [[benzene]] and [[toluene]], and [[aliphatic]] compounds such as [[propane]] and [[butene]]. The concentration of organic compounds are 100-fold higher than earlier measurements. The authors speculate that the presence of sulfur may have helped preserve them. The products resemble those obtained from the breakdown of [[kerogen]], a precursor to oil and natural gas on Earth. NASA stated that these findings are not evidence that life existed on the planet, but that the organic compounds needed to sustain microscopic life were present, and that there may be deeper sources of organic compounds on the planet.&lt;ref name="NASA-20180607"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Brown |first1=Dwayne |last2=Wendel |first2=JoAnna |last3=Steigerwald |first3=Bill |last4=Jones |first4=Nancy |last5=Good |first5=Andrew |title=Release 18-050 - NASA Finds Ancient Organic Material, Mysterious Methane on Mars |url=https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-finds-ancient-organic-material-mysterious-methane-on-mars |date=June 7, 2018 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=June 7, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20180607vid"&gt;{{cite web |author=NASA |title=Ancient Organics Discovered on Mars - video (03:17) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0gsz8EHiNc |date=June 7, 2018 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=June 7, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SPC-20180607"&gt;{{cite web |last=Wall |first=Mike |title=Curiosity Rover Finds Ancient 'Building Blocks for Life' on Mars |url=https://www.space.com/40819-mars-methane-organics-curiosity-rover.html |date=June 7, 2018 |work=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=June 7, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20180607"&gt;{{cite news |last=Chang |first=Kenneth |title=Life on Mars?

A '''Vegetative Treatment System''' (VTS) is a combination of treatment steps for managing [[Surface runoff|runoff]]. It treats runoff by settling, [[Infiltration (hydrology)|infiltrating]], and nutrient usage. Individual components of a VTS include, a settling structure, an outlet structure, a distribution system, and a Vegetative Treatment Area (VTA). All these components when used together are considered to be a Vegetative Treatment System.

==Introduction==
A '''Vegetative Treatment System (VTS)''' is a new alternative treatment option for treating the runoff from an [[animal feeding operation]] in an effort to protect water quality in [[South Dakota]] (SD). A VTS consists of a [[sediment basin]] to settle the solids from the feedlot, and uses controlled release of the liquids to a vegetated treatment area (VTA).

The VTA area is commonly confused with vegetative buffer (or filter) strips. A [[buffer strip]] is a narrow strip of vegetation (usually 30–60 feet wide) between cropland or a water source, such as a [[river]], [[lake]], or [[stream]]. In contrast, a VTA is a specifically sized area of [[Perennial plant|perennial]] vegetation to which runoff from a [[barnyard]] or [[feedlot]] is applied uniformly. The VTA utilizes the water holding capacity of the soil to store the runoff water until the nutrients and water can be used by the vegetation. Therefore, the application of the runoff to the VTA must be at a rate to prevent deep percolation below the root zone, and not allow the flow to extend past the end of the VTA.

A '''VTS''' can be an economical alternative to runoff retention (holding) ponds for controlling runoff from an open lot feeding production system ([[feedlot]]s). A Vegetative Treatment Area (VTA) is an area of perennial vegetation, such as a grass or a forage. The VTA is used to treat runoff from a feedlot or barnyard. It treats runoff by settling, infiltration, and nutrient use.  Runoff passes through buffers with some “filtering” of pollutants, but no attempt is made to control solids or flow. A VTS, however, collects runoff from a barnyard or feedlot, separates the solids from the liquids, and uniformly distributes the liquid over the vegetated area. Little or no runoff should leave a VTA.

Runoff is first collected from an open lot or barnyard area in a [[sediment]] settling structure, usually a basin. Such basins are very effective for removing most solids. The runoff then flows into a VTA where the  soil treats and stores the runoff. Once the runoff is in the soil, natural processes allow plants to use the nutrients. The general idea behind VTS technology is that the plants will take up the nutrients contained in the runoff and that natural processes will eliminate undesirable components such as pathogens. There are many different types of VTA’s such as level, infiltration basins, sloped, sprinkler, dual and multiple systems, etc.

A Vegetative Treatment System can be used to manage runoff from open lots of both [[Animal feeding operation|AFOs]] and [[CAFO]]s. VTS systems for large [[CAFO]]s can be permitted under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System ([[Clean Water Act|NPDES]]) in the US.

==Advantages==
* May provide lower initial investment and operating costs
*  More aesthetically palatable than large ponds 
* No long-term storage of runoff required, such as holding or evaporation ponds 
*  Fewer safety issues 
* Land designated for VTA can produce usable forage

==Disadvantages==
* A VTA may not be a “closed” system;
*  Saturated soils from previous rains could allow a discharge 
*  Special management required during runoff events
*  The VTAs can be damaged by a lack of maintenance and attention - gullies, erosion, and poor vegetation stands dramatically reduce their effectiveness 
*  Not currently permittable in SD by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources 
*  The VTAs may not provide the same level of water quality improvement as a total runoff containment system, such as holding or evaporation ponds provide

'''World energy resources''' are the estimated maximum capacity for energy production given all available resources on [[Earth]]. They can be divided by type into [[fossil fuel]], [[nuclear fuel]] and [[renewable resource]]s.

== Fossil fuel ==
{{Main article|Fossil fuel}}

Remaining reserves of fossil fuel are estimated as:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bp.com/liveassets/bp_internet/globalbp/globalbp_uk_english/reports_and_publications/statistical_energy_review_2008/STAGING/local_assets/2010_downloads/statistical_review_of_world_energy_full_report_2010.pdf  Proven energy reserves, BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

{|class="wikitable"
!width="100"|'''   Fuel   '''
!width="150"|'''Proven energy reserves in [[Zetta-|Z]][[Joule|J]] (end of 2009)'''
|-
|   Coal  || &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;19.8
|-
|   Gas   || &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;36.4
|-
|   Oil   || &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;8.9
|}

These are the proven energy reserves; real reserves may be up to a factor 4 larger. Significant uncertainty exists for these numbers. Estimating the remaining fossil fuels on the planet depends on a detailed understanding of Earth's crust. While modern drilling technology makes it possible to drill wells in up to 3&amp;nbsp;km of water to verify the exact composition of the geology, one half of the [[ocean]] is deeper than 3&amp;nbsp;km, leaving about a third of the planet beyond the reach of detailed analysis.

In addition to uncertainty in real reserves, there is significant uncertainty in technological and economical factors that impact what percentage of reserves can be recovered gainfully. In general the easiest to reach deposits are the first extracted. Factors affecting the cost of exploiting the remaining reserves include the accessibility of fossil deposits, the level of sulfur and other pollutants in the oil and the coal, transportation costs, and societal instability in producing regions.

===Coal===
{{Main article|Coal#World_coal_reserves|l1=World coal reserves}}
Coal is the most abundant and burned fossil fuel. This was the fuel that launched the industrial revolution and has continued to grow in use; China, which already has many of the world's most polluted cities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,501031124-543833,00.html The Middle Landfill]&lt;/ref&gt; was in 2007 building about two coal-fired power plants every week.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6769743.stm  China building more power plants]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/041707/opi_opinion1.shtml COAL: Scrubbing its future]&lt;/ref&gt; Coal is the fastest growing fossil fuel and its large reserves would make it a popular candidate to meet the energy demand of the global community, short of global warming concerns and other pollutants.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/11/business/worldbusiness/11chinacoal.html Pollution From Chinese Coal Casts a Global Shadow] accessed 14 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[International Energy Agency]] the proven reserves of coal are around 909 billion tonnes, which could sustain the current production rate for 155 years,&lt;ref&gt;IEA (2006), p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; although at a 5% growth per annum this would be reduced to 45 years, or until 2051. With the [[Fischer–Tropsch process]] it is possible to make liquid fuels such as diesel and jet fuel from coal. In the United States, 49% of electricity generation comes from burning coal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/epa/epat1p1.html EIA sources of electricity]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural gas===
{{Main article|Natural gas}}
Natural gas is a widely available fossil fuel with estimated 850 000&amp;nbsp;km³ in recoverable reserves and at least that much more using enhanced methods to release shale gas.  Improvements in technology and wide exploration led to a major increase in recoverable natural gas reserves as shale fracking methods were developed.  At present usage rates, natural gas could supply most of the world's energy needs for between 100 and 250 years, depending on increase in consumption over time.

===Oil===
{{See also|Oil reserves|Peak oil}}
It is estimated that there may be 57&amp;nbsp;ZJ of oil reserves on Earth (although estimates vary from a low of 8&amp;nbsp;ZJ,&lt;ref name=EIA&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[Statistical Review of World Energy 2009]], [[BP]] | url = http://www.bp.com/liveassets/bp_internet/globalbp/globalbp_uk_english/reports_and_publications/statistical_energy_review_2008/STAGING/local_assets/2009_downloads/statistical_review_of_world_energy_full_report_2009.xls#'Primary%20Energy%20-%20Consumption'!A1 | title = Consumption by fuel, 1965 - 2008 | format = XLS | date = July 31, 2006 | accessdate = 2009-10-24 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090708203819/http://www.bp.com/liveassets/bp_internet/globalbp/globalbp_uk_english/reports_and_publications/statistical_energy_review_2008/STAGING/local_assets/2009_downloads/statistical_review_of_world_energy_full_report_2009.xls#'Primary%20Energy%20-%20Consumption'!A1 | archivedate = July 8, 2009 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; consisting of currently proven and recoverable reserves, to a maximum of 110&amp;nbsp;ZJ&lt;ref name="Oil Gas Industry Stats"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.oiljobsource.com/oil-gas-industry-statistics.html|title=Oil Gas Industry Stats| publisher= oiljobsource.com| accessdate=2011-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;) consisting of available, but not necessarily recoverable reserves, and including optimistic estimates for unconventional sources such as [[tar sands|oil sands]] and [[oil shale]]. Current consensus among the 18 recognized estimates of supply profiles is that the peak of extraction will occur in 2020 at the rate of 93-million barrels per day (mbd). Current oil consumption is at the rate of 0.18&amp;nbsp;ZJ per year (31.1 billion barrels) or 85 mbd.

There is growing concern that [[peak oil|peak oil production]] may be reached in the near future, resulting in severe [[Oil price increases since 2003|oil price increases]].&lt;ref name="wsj111907golddavis"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also theories that peak of the global oil production may occur in as little as 2–3 years. The ASPO predicts peak year to be in 2010. Some other theories present the view that it has already taken place in 2005. World crude oil production (including lease condensates) according to [[US EIA]] data decreased from a peak of 73.720 mbd in 2005 to 73.437 in 2006, 72.981 in 2007, and 73.697 in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/ipsr/t41d.xls International Petroleum Monthly] Retrieved 10 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; According to peak oil theory, increasing production will lead to a more rapid collapse of production in the future, while decreasing production will lead to a slower decrease, as the [[Normal distribution|bell-shaped curve]] will be spread out over more years.

In a stated goal of increasing oil prices to $75/barrel, which had fallen from a high of $147 to a low of $40, [[OPEC]] announced decreasing production by 2.2 mbd beginning 1 January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7786456.stm Opec agrees record oil output cut] retrieved 21 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainability===
Political considerations over the security of supplies, environmental concerns related to [[global warming]] and [[sustainability]] are expected to move the world's energy consumption away from fossil fuels. The concept of [[peak oil]] shows that about half of the available petroleum resources have been produced, and predicts a decrease of production.

A government moves away from fossil fuels would most likely create economic pressure through [[emissions trading|carbon emissions]] and [[green tax]]ation. Some countries are taking action as a result of the [[Kyoto Protocol]], and further steps in this direction are proposed. For example, the [[European Commission]] has proposed that the [[energy policy of the European Union]] should set a binding target of increasing the level of renewable energy in the EU's overall mix from less than 7% in 2007 to 20% by 2020.&lt;ref name="roadmap21"&gt;{{cite web | title = Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council: Renewable Energy Roadmap: Renewable Energies in the 21st century; building a sustainable future - COM(2006) 848 | url = http://ec.europa.eu/energy/energy_policy/doc/03_renewable_energy_roadmap_en.pdf | format = PDF | publisher = Commission of the European Communities | date = 10 January 2007 | accessdate = 2007-01-27 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070128104118/http://ec.europa.eu/energy/energy_policy/doc/03_renewable_energy_roadmap_en.pdf | archivedate = 28 January 2007 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The antithesis of sustainability is a disregard for limits, commonly referred to as the Easter Island Effect, which is the concept of being unable to develop sustainability, resulting in the depletion of natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://strategy.sauder.ubc.ca/nemetz/jibe.pdf Basic Concepts of Sustainable Development for Business Students]&lt;/ref&gt; Some estimate that, assuming current consumption rates, current oil reserves could be completely depleted by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Proved1 Reserves of Oil and Natural Gas, Most Recent Estimates|url=http://www.eia.gov/international/reserves.html|publisher=Energy Information Administration|accessdate=14 November 2016|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217151346/http://www.eia.gov/international/reserves.html|archivedate=17 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nuclear fuel==
{{See also|Nuclear power|Nuclear energy policy}}

===Nuclear energy===
{{See also|Nuclear fuel}}
The [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] estimates the remaining uranium resources to be equal to 2500&amp;nbsp;ZJ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Global Ur Resources to Meet Projected Demand: Latest Edition of "Red Book" Predicts Consistent Supply Up to 2025| url= http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/News/2006/uranium_resources.html | date = 2 June 2006 | publisher = International Atomic Energy Agency | accessdate= 2007-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This assumes the use of [[breeder reactor]]s, which are able to create more [[fissile]] material than they consume. [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] estimated currently proved economically recoverable uranium deposits for once-through fuel cycles reactors to be only 2 ZJ. The ultimately recoverable uranium is estimated to be 17 ZJ for once-through reactors and 1000 ZJ with reprocessing and fast breeder reactors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Nakicenovic, Nebojsa| title= IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios |url= http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc/emission/071.htm| publisher = Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change | accessdate=2007-02-20|display-authors=etal}} [[Special Report on Emissions Scenarios]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Resources and technology do not constrain the capacity of nuclear power to contribute to meeting the energy demand for the 21st century. However, political and environmental concerns about [[nuclear safety]] and [[radioactive waste]] started to limit the growth of this energy supply at the end of last century, particularly due to a number of [[List of civilian nuclear accidents|nuclear accidents]]. Concerns about [[nuclear proliferation]] (especially with [[plutonium]] produced by breeder reactors) mean that the development of nuclear power by countries such as [[Nuclear program of Iran|Iran]] and [[Syria]] is being actively discouraged by the international community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7364269.stm |title=Syria 'had covert nuclear scheme' |newspaper=BBC News |date=2008-04-25 |accessdate=2010-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although at the beginning of the 21st century uranium is the primary nuclear fuel worldwide, others such as thorium and hydrogen had been under investigation since the middle of the 20th century.

Thorium reserves significantly exceed those of uranium, and of course hydrogen is abundant. It is also considered by many to be easier to obtain than [[uranium]]. While [[uranium mines]] are enclosed underground and thus very dangerous for the miners, [[thorium]] is taken from open pits, and is estimated to be roughly three times as abundant as uranium in the Earth's crust.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/crux/2015/01/16/thorium-future-nuclear-energy/#.VPfjkXbFo1w&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1960s, numerous facilities throughout the world have burned [[Thorium]].

===Nuclear fusion===
Alternatives for energy production through fusion of hydrogen has been under investigation since the 1950s.  No materials can withstand the temperatures required to ignite the fuel, so it must be confined by methods which use no materials.  Magnetic and inertial confinement are the main alternatives ([[Cadarache]], [[Inertial confinement fusion]]) both of which are hot research topics in the early years of the 21st century.

[[Fusion power]] is the process driving the sun and other stars. It generates large quantities of heat by fusing the nuclei of hydrogen or helium isotopes, which may be derived from seawater. The heat can theoretically be harnessed to generate electricity. The temperatures and pressures needed to sustain fusion make it a very difficult process to control. Fusion is theoretically able to supply vast quantities of energy, with relatively little pollution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efda.org/fusion_energy/safety_and_the_environment.htm Fusion Energy: Safety] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720021002/http://www.efda.org/fusion_energy/safety_and_the_environment.htm |date=2011-07-20 }} European Fusion Development Agreement (EFDA).  2006.  Retrieved on 2007-04-03&lt;/ref&gt; Although both the United States and the European Union, along with other countries, are supporting fusion research (such as investing in the [[ITER]] facility), according to one report, inadequate research has stalled progress in fusion research for the past 20&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fire.pppl.gov/us_fusion50yr_dean.pdf Fifty years of U.S. fusion research - An overview of programs st]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renewable resources==
{{Main article|Renewable resource}}
Renewable resources are available each year, unlike non-renewable resources, which are eventually depleted. A simple comparison is a coal mine and a forest. While the forest could be depleted, if it is managed it represents a continuous supply of energy, vs. the coal mine, which once has been exhausted is gone. Most of earth's available energy resources are renewable resources. Renewable resources account for more than 93 percent of total U.S. energy reserves. Annual renewable resources were multiplied times thirty years for comparison with non-renewable resources. In other words, if all non-renewable resources were uniformly exhausted in 30 years, they would only account for 7 percent of available resources each year, if all available renewable resources were developed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/pub_summaries/renew_es.html Renewable Resources in the U.S. Electricity Supply]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solar energy===
{{Main article|Solar energy}}
Renewable energy sources are even larger than the traditional fossil fuels and in theory can easily supply the world's energy needs. 89&amp;nbsp;PW&lt;ref name="Tester 2005"&gt;{{cite book | last = Tester | first = Jefferson W. | authorlink = | title = Sustainable Energy: Choosing Among Options | publisher = The MIT Press | date = 2005 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-262-20153-4 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Page numbers are needed on all book sources, pls fill in for Tester --&gt; of solar power falls on the planet's surface. While it is not possible to capture all, or even most, of this energy, capturing less than 0.02% would be enough to meet the current energy needs. Barriers to further solar generation include the high price of making [[solar cells]] and reliance on weather patterns to generate electricity. Also, current solar generation does not produce electricity at night, which is a particular problem in high northern and southern latitude countries; energy demand is highest in winter, while availability of solar energy is lowest. This could be overcome by buying power from countries closer to the equator during winter months, and may also be addressed with technological developments such as the development of inexpensive energy storage. Globally, solar generation is the fastest growing source of energy, seeing an annual average growth of 35% over the past few years. [[Japan]], [[Europe]], [[China]], [[United States|U.S.]] and [[Solar power in India|India]] are the major growing investors in solar energy. Solar power's share of worldwide electricity usage at the end of 2014 was 1%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/REN12-GSR2015_Onlinebook_low1.pdf pg31&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wind power===
{{Main article|Wind power}}
The available wind energy estimates range from 300&amp;nbsp;TW to 870&amp;nbsp;TW.&lt;ref name="Tester 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gcep.stanford.edu/research/exergycharts.html Exergy Flow Charts]&lt;/ref&gt; Using the lower estimate, just 5% of the available wind energy would supply the current worldwide energy needs. Most of this wind energy is available over the open ocean. The [[ocean]]s cover 71% of the planet and wind tends to blow more strongly over open water because there are fewer obstructions.

===Wave and tidal power===
{{Main article|Wave power|Tidal power}}
At the end of 2005, 0.3&amp;nbsp;GW of electricity was produced by [[tidal power]].&lt;ref name="Renewables2006"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/download/RE_GSR_2006_Update.pdf | format = PDF | publisher = Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century | title = Renewables, Global Status Report 2006 | date = 2006 | accessdate = 2007-04-03 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110718181410/http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/download/RE_GSR_2006_Update.pdf | archivedate = 2011-07-18 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the [[tidal forces]] created by the Moon (68%) and the Sun (32%), and the Earth's relative rotation with respect to Moon and Sun, there are fluctuating tides. These tidal fluctuations result in [[dissipation]] at an average rate of about 3.7 TW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0967-0637(98)00070-3 | volume=45 | title=Abyssal recipes II: energetics of tidal and wind mixing | year=1998 | journal=Deep Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers | pages=1977–2010 | last1 = Munk | first1 = Walter| bibcode=1998DSRI...45.1977M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another physical limitation is the energy available in the tidal fluctuations of the oceans, which is about 0.6 EJ ([[exa]][[joule]]).&lt;ref&gt;Marchuk, G.I. and Kagan, B.A. (1989) "Dynamics of Ocean Tides", Kluwer Academic Publishers, {{ISBN|978-90-277-2552-3}}. See page 225.&lt;/ref&gt; Note this is only a tiny fraction of the total [[rotational energy|rotational energy of the Earth]]. Without forcing, this energy would be dissipated (at a dissipation rate of 3.7 TW) in about four [[Half|semi]]-[[Day|diurnal]] tide periods. So, dissipation plays a significant role in the tidal dynamics of the oceans. Therefore, this limits the available tidal energy to around 0.8 TW (20% of the dissipation rate) in order not to disturb the tidal dynamics too much. {{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

Waves are derived from wind, which is in turn derived from solar energy, and at each conversion there is a drop of about two orders of magnitude in available energy. The total power of waves that wash against the earth's shores adds up to 3 TW.&lt;ref&gt;Tester, et al., p. 593&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geothermal===
{{Main article|Geothermal power}}
Estimates of exploitable worldwide [[geothermal power|geothermal energy]] resources vary considerably, depending on assumed investments in technology and exploration and guesses about geological formations. According to a 1999 study, it was thought that this might amount to between 65 and 138&amp;nbsp;GW of electrical generation capacity 'using enhanced technology'.&lt;ref&gt;

A 2006 report by [[MIT]] that took into account the use of [[Enhanced Geothermal System]]s (EGS) concluded that it would be affordable to generate 100&amp;nbsp;GWe (gigawatts of electricity) or more by 2050, just in the [[United States]], for a maximum investment of 1 billion US dollars in research and development over 15 years.&lt;ref name="INEL"&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[MIT]] | title = The Future of Geothermal Energy | url = http://geothermal.inel.gov/publications/future_of_geothermal_energy.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate=2007-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MIT report calculated the world's total EGS resources to be over 13&amp;nbsp;YJ, of which over 200&amp;nbsp;ZJ would be extractable, with the potential to increase this to over 2&amp;nbsp;YJ with technology improvements - sufficient to provide all the world's energy needs for several [[Millennium|millennia]].&lt;ref name="INEL" /&gt; The total heat content of the Earth is 13,000,000 YJ.&lt;ref name="GEO" /&gt;

===Biomass===
{{Main article|biomass|biofuel}}
Production of biomass and biofuels are growing industries as interest in sustainable fuel sources is growing. Utilizing waste products avoids a [[food vs fuel]] trade-off, and burning [[Methane|methane gas]] reduces greenhouse gas emissions, because even though it releases carbon dioxide, carbon dioxide is 23 times less of a greenhouse gas than is methane. Biofuels represent a sustainable partial replacement for fossil fuels, but their net impact on [[greenhouse gas]] emissions depends on the agricultural practices used to grow the plants used as feedstock to create the fuels. While it is widely believed that biofuels can be carbon-neutral, there is evidence that biofuels produced by current farming methods are substantial net carbon emitters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Rosenthal | first=Elisabeth | title=Biofuels Deemed a Greenhouse Threat | newspaper=[[New York Times]] | date=2008-02-08 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/08/science/earth/08wbiofuels.html}} Registration required. "Almost all biofuels used today cause more greenhouse gas emissions than conventional fuels if the full emissions costs of producing these “green” fuels are taken into account, two studies being published Thursday have concluded."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Farigone | first1=Joseph | last2=Hill | first2=Jason | last3=Tillman | first3=David | last4=Polasky | first4=Stephen | last5=Hawthorne | first5=Peter | title=Land Clearing and the Biofuel Carbon Debt | journal=Science | volume=319 | pages=1235–1238 | date=2008-02-29 | doi=10.1126/science.1152747 | pmid=18258862 | issue=5867 | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;| bibcode=2008Sci...319.1235F }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Searchinger | first1=Timothy | last2=Heimlich | first2=Ralph | last3=Houghton | first3=R.
