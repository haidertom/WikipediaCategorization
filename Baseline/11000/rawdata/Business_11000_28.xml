'''Adam Film World (AFW)''' and '''Adam Film World Guide (AFWG)''' were [[magazines]] about [[pornographic film]], published in the [[United States]], starting in 1966 as ''The Adam Film Quarterly.'' The first issue's cover price was $1 and the cover story was about ''[[Fanny Hill|The Notorious Daughter of Fanny Hill]]'',  an erotic movie directed by [[Peter Stootsberry]] and produced by [[Bradford Hallworth]].&lt;ref name="moviemags-afq"&gt;[http://www.moviemags.com/main.php?title=ADAM%20FILM%20QUARTERLY&amp;etos=1966 "Adam Film Quarterly"], ''The Site of Movie Magazines''. Retrieved 4 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Knight Publishing Corp. had launched ''Adam'' magazine in the 1950s as an attempt to follow ''[[Playboy]]'s'' success. ''Adam Film Quarterly'' was spun off from that magazine by [[William Rotsler]] in 1966 to cover the [[sexploitation film]] industry.&lt;ref name="moviemags-afq" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=David|last=Church|title=Between Fantasy and Reality: Sexploitation, Fan Magazines, and William Rotsler's "Adults-Only" Career|journal=Film History: An International Journal|volume=26|number=3|year=2014|doi=10.1353/fih.2014.0016|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/fih/summary/v026/26.3.church.html |pp=&lt;!--106–143--&gt;111–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Originally, like ''Playboy'', the publication also covered mainstream films and included feature stories on stars such as [[Orson Welles]] or [[Judy Garland]]. However, by 1969 it was renamed ''Adam Film World'' and issued monthly.&lt;ref name="moviemags-afw"&gt;[http://www.moviemags.com/main.php?title=ADAM%20FILM%20WORLD&amp;etos=1969 "Adam Film World"], ''The Site of Movie Magazines''. Retrieved 4 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Internet Adult Film Database]] owes its start to [[Peter Van Aarle]], who began keeping notes on index cards on adult movies he had seen or were reviewed in ''Adam Film World'' starting in 1982.&lt;ref name="remembering"&gt;{{cite web|title=remembering peter van aarle |url=http://www.iafd.com/peter.asp |publisher=IAFD |accessdate=2012-09-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020102448/http://www.iafd.com/peter.asp |archivedate=2007-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Adam Film World'' was called "one of the industry's leading [[trade publications]]" in 1994 by the [[Associated Press]].&lt;ref&gt;John Horn, Associated Press Writer, "[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=A-gyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=vQcGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6802,316002&amp;dq=adam-film-world&amp;hl=en VCRs have made 'adult' films big business]," ''Fredericksburg (Va.) Free Lance-Star'', Dec. 2, 1994, p. B3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2001 book ''Pornography and Sexual Representation'', Joseph Slade states, "Extremely valuable are the reports, [[Film criticism|reviews]] and [[gossip]] of ''Adam Film World and Adult Video Guide'', the oldest American monthly devoted to explicit cinema and generally more reliable than similar magazines, though the information on actors and actresses should be approached with caution. Best described as a [[fan magazine]], ''Adam Film World'' hypes the careers of performers for a credulous audience, but partly for that reason it is unparalleled as a guide to the mores and customs of the [[porn]] [[subculture]]."&lt;ref name="sladebook"&gt;Joseph W. Slade, ''Pornography and Sexual Representation: A Reference Guide'', Volume I, Greenwood Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-313-31519-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Slade pointed out that the magazine's Interviews with performers were, to an extent, similar to [[celebrity]] interviews in popular mainstream magazines: "Actors and actresses usually begin by talking about their parents, their [[adolescence]], their own children, lovers, the importance of grooming, then move on to discussions of [[Breast augmentation|augmented breasts]], relative [[Human penis size|penis sizes]], favorite costars and [[Film director|directors]], referred techniques of [[oral sex|oral]], [[Sexual intercourse|vaginal]], or [[anal sex]], [[striptease]] dancing on tour as a sideline and—most important—their [[fan clubs]] or their [[Premium-rate telephone number|900-telephone numbers]]."&lt;ref name="sladebook"/&gt;

The publication is also notable for having issued the first movie awards for excellence in pornographic film, first with the [[#X-Caliber Awards|X-Caliber Awards]] in 1975,&lt;ref name="afw0876"&gt;Thomas H. Hilton, "Film World's Own Porn Awards", ''Adam Film World'', Vol. 5, No. 12, August 1976, pp. 34-37.&lt;/ref&gt; then replacing them with the [[#Adam Film World Guide Awards|AFWG awards]] starting in 1981 when its sister publication, ''Adam Film World Guide'', was launched.&lt;ref name="afwg0581"&gt;''Adam Film World Guide'', Vol. 1, No. 1, May 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; Today the role of adult film awards has been mostly supplanted by ''Adult Video News,'' with its [[AVN Awards]], which launched a decade later.

''Adam Film World Guide'', in turn, spawned an annual ''Directory of Adult Films'' starting in 1984. The annuals were "important directories of...hard-core films and videos of the previous eighteen months, with lists of notable films of the past, capsule reviews that rate [[eroticism]] from 'warm' to 'volcanic,' addresses of [[distributors]] and [[retail]] outlets, brief [[biographies]] of actors, directors, and [[Film producer|producers]] and indexes by theme, director, and performer."&lt;ref name="sladebook" /&gt;

Edward S. Sullivan was the first editor of ''Adam Film World'', followed briefly in 1984 by John Zeus, while former [[pornographic film actor]] [[Tim Connelly]] was editor, under the name Jeremy Stone, from 1985 to 2003.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Connelly, as Stone, was inducted into the [[XRCO Hall of Fame|X-Rated Critics Organization Hall of Fame]] in the [[Fifth Estate]] category in 1998.&lt;ref name="xrco"&gt;[http://www.bwdl.net/XRCO-2/hall.htm XRCO Hall of Fame] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007005528/http://www.bwdl.net/XRCO-2/hall.htm |date=2007-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knight Publishing eventually expanded to add several other magazine titles such as ''Adam Black Video Illustrated'', ''Adam Gay Video'', and ''Cinema X Monthly'' and several others, but ''Adam Film World'' remained the flagship of the group until it was discontinued in the late 1990s in favour of ''Adam Film World Guide''. By 2008, owner [[Bentley Morriss]] put the company up for sale. When a buyer was not found, the magazine empire folded.&lt;ref name="xbiz"&gt;Tod Hunter, "[http://www.xbiz.com/news/news_piece.php?id=96066&amp;mi=all&amp;q='Adam+Film+World'+Reportedly+on+Hold+Pending+Sale 'Adam Film World' Reportedly on Hold Pending Sale]", Xbiz.com, July 2, 2008. (Retrieved Sept. 25, 2012.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==X-Caliber Awards==
The ''Adam Film World'' annual X-Caliber Awards based their selection of winners "largely on the votes of readers who are members of the audiences of the adult theaters."&lt;ref name="afw1277"&gt;Thomas H. Hilton, "The First Annual Erotica Awards", ''Adam Film World'', December 1977, pp. 18-21.&lt;/ref&gt; although after the popular vote is counted, "an editorial panel makes the final selections".&lt;ref name="afw0179"&gt;Frank Thistle, "The Second Annual Erotica Awards," ''Adam Film World'', January 1979, pp. 24-27, 72.&lt;/ref&gt; The winners were announced annually starting with the August 1976 issue for films released the previous year. By the second year, the Z-Caliber Awards, for the worst movies, were also introduced.&lt;ref name="afw0877"&gt;Thomas H. Hilton, "The Porn Awards", ''Adam Film World'', Vol. 6, No. 6, August 1977, pp. 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, ''Adam Film World'' revived its awards with a new name, the Adam Film World Guide Awards, to coincide with the launch of a sister magazine, ''Adam Film World Guide''. Rather than giving single awards in several categories, ''AFWG'' had only a few categories — top films, top videos, top sex scenes, best male and female performers and best director — but named the top five or top 10 of each. Then, until 2003, in the annual ''AFWG Directory of Adult Films'' it ranked the top three movies of the year, a combination of movies shot on film and those shot on videotape:

Starting with the 2002 awards, ''Adam Film World Guide'' changed the focus of the annual awards. Rather than naming the top 10 films and top 10 videos (which the ''Directory'' then condensed into a list of the year's top three movies), ''AFWG'' just named one top film, one top video and 51 other awards to movies and individuals for a wide range of categories such as Best Asian Starlet, Best Fetish Vignette Movie, Best Couples Movie, Best Gonzo Comedy, Best Music, Best Box Cover Art and Best All-Girl Orgy Series.

With movies shot on film and videotape giving way to digital, the Best Films and Best Videos categories were eventually combined into Best Movie, and so in 2005, ''Adam Film World Guide Directory'' stopped naming the previous year's top three movies, thereafter just reprinting the entire list of ''AFWG'' individual awards. The final awards, for movies released in 2007, were published in the July 2008 issue of ''Adam Film World Guide''.

==''Adam Black Video'' Top 25==
''Adam Black Video Directory'' was an annual publication produced from 1998 to 2007, which grew out of ''Adam Black Video Illustrated''.

In the late 1990s ''Adam Black Video Directory'' decided the time had come to honor a list of the best black and interracial movies of all time, because there had been few awards given for them in the past. Adding a few new ones each year, by 2000 the list had grown to a top 25, with a tie for 6th place (shown with year of release in brackets): 1. ''[[Black Throat]]'' (1985), 2. ''[[Maverdick]]'' (1995), 3. ''[[Let Me Tell Ya 'bout White Chicks]]'' (1984), 4. ''[[Nasty Video Magazine 5]]'' (1999), 5. ''[[Friend to the Black Man]]'' (1998), 6. ''[[Harlem Candy]]'' (1987), 6. ''[[N.B.A. (Nuttin' But Ass)]]'' (1996), 7. ''[[The Look 2000]]'' (1997), 8. ''[[The Legend of Reggie D]]'' (1989), 9. ''[[The Adventures of Dick Black the Black Dick]]'' (1987), 10. ''[[Pussyman 7]]'' (1994), 11. ''[[Starbangers 2]]'' (1994), 12. ''[[Escape to Pleasure Island]]'' (1998), 13. ''[[My Black Ass]]'' (1997), 14. ''[[Booty Bitch]]'' (1995), 15. ''[[African Angels]]'' (1996), 16. ''[[Hot Rod Honeyz]]'', 17. ''[[Black Butt Jungle]]'' (1998), 18. ''[[Kink World]]'' (1993), 19. ''[[Mac' In 2]]'' (1996), 20. ''Centerfold'' (1997), 21. ''Dear John'' (1993), 22. ''[[Buttman Back in Rio 4]]'', 23. ''The Dream Team'' (1996), 24. ''[[Isis Blublue filme]]'' (1998) and 25 ''[[Bomb Ass Pussy]]'' (1998).&lt;ref&gt;''Adam Black Video Directory 2000''&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Adam Gay Video'' "Dave" Awards==
Originated in 1989 by ''Adam Gay Video Directory'' editor Dave Kinnick, [[Dave Awards|The "Dave" Awards]] were originally announced in Kinnick's monthly "Video Review" column in ''[[Men (magazine)|Advocate Men]] Magazine''. They moved to ''Adam Gay Video 1996 Directory'' after the column ceased in December 1994.&lt;ref name="Adam 1996"&gt;

==Notes==
{{Refbegin}}
{{note|vulgar|1}}Some of the terminology used by ''Adam Film World'' for some of the awards was deleted or replaced by something less vulgar in these instances.

{{note|worst|2}}In announcing the Z-Caliber Awards in 1977, ''Adam Film World'' did not give Worst Direction or Worst Sinematography Awards, saying "We had a couple more Z-Calibers in mind but have deleted them just to be nice—also the contenders were running neck-and-neck."&lt;ref name="afw0877" /&gt; In announcing the 1978 awards, the previous year's awards were also noted and this time a Worst Sinematography Award for 1977 was named, but the Worst Direction for that year was "withheld by request".&lt;ref name="afw1078" /&gt;

{{note|error|3}}The 2002 ''Adam Film World Guide Directory'' listed ''Marissa'' as first runner-up and ''Beast'' as second runner-up, however, this was changed to ''Euphoria'' and ''Taboo 2001'' in subsequent directories. It is likely ''Marissa'' and ''Beast'' were the incorrect entries because ''Euphoria'' was named best video that year and since all four movies were shot-on-video productions, it would be the most likely to make the top three movies list overall.

'''Alcohol advertising''' is the [[advertising|promotion]] of [[alcoholic beverage]]s by [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] producers through a variety of [[mass media|media]]. Along with [[tobacco advertising]], alcohol advertising is one of the most highly regulated forms of [[marketing]]. Some or all forms of alcohol advertising is banned in some countries. There have been some important studies about alcohol advertising published, such as J.P. Nelson's in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=51224 | title=Author Page for Jon P. Nelson | work=[[SSRN]] | accessdate=January 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientific research, health agencies and universities have, over the decades, been able to demonstrate a correlation between alcohol beverage advertising and alcohol consumption, especially among initially non-drinking youth.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grenard|first=Jerry L.|last2=Dent|first2=Clyde W.|last3=Stacy|first3=Alan W.|date=2013|title=Exposure to Alcohol Advertisements and Teenage Alcohol-Related Problems|journal=Pediatrics|volume=131|issue=2|pages=369–379|doi=10.1542/peds.2012-1480|pmc=3557408|pmid=23359585}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Snyder|first=Leslie B.|last2=Milici|first2=Frances Fleming|last3=Slater|first3=Michael|last4=Sun|first4=Helen|last5=Strizhakova|first5=Yuliya|date=2006|title=Effects of Alcohol Advertising Exposure on Drinking Among Youth|url=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/204410?resultClick=1|journal=Archives of Pediatrics &amp; Adolescent Medicine|language=en|volume=160|issue=1|pages=|doi=10.1001/archpedi.160.1.18|issn=1072-4710|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=P.|last2=Bruijn|first2=A. de|last3=Angus|first3=K.|last4=Gordon|first4=R.|last5=Hastings|first5=G.|date=2009|title=Impact of Alcohol Advertising and Media Exposure on Adolescent Alcohol Use: A Systematic Review of Longitudinal Studies|url=https://academic.oup.com/alcalc/article/44/3/229/178279|journal=Alcohol and Alcoholism|language=en|volume=44|issue=3|pages=229–243|doi=10.1093/alcalc/agn115|issn=0735-0414|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is an equally significant body of research positing that alcohol advertising does not ''cause'' higher consumption and rather merely reflects greater public demand, with many commentators suggesting that effective alcohol campaigns only increase a producer's market share and also brand loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;J.P.

==Target marketing==
The [[target market|intended audience]] of the alcohol [[advertising campaign]]s have changed over the years, with some brands being specifically targeted towards a particular [[demographic profile|demographic]].  Some drinks are traditionally seen as a male drink, particularly [[beer]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2015/10/beer-still-perceived-as-a-mans-drink/|title=Beer Still 'Perceived as a Man's Drink'|last=Eads|first=Lauren|date=2015|website=The Drinks Business|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[whiskies]], while others are drunk by females.  Some brands have allegedly been specifically developed to appeal to people that would not normally drink that kind of beverage. These ads may contribute to underage consumption and binge drinking.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2011 a study found that twenty-two percent of twelfth graders had binge drank in the past two weeks,&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, L. D., O’Malley, P. M., Bachman, J. G., &amp; Schulenberg, J. E. (2012). ''[http://monitoringthefuture.org/pubs/monographs/mtf-overview2011.pdf Monitoring the Future national results on adolescent drug use: Overview of key findings, 2011]''. Ann Arbor: Institute for Social Research, The University of Michigan.&lt;/ref&gt; this figure doubled for kids in college.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=White|first=Aaron|last2=Hingson|first2=Ralph|date=2014|title=The Burden of Alcohol Use|journal=Alcohol Research : Current Reviews|volume=35|issue=2|pages=201–218|issn=2168-3492|pmc=908712|pmid=24881329}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies suggest that the use of alcohol before the brain fully develops can alter or negatively affect the development of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ewing|first=Sarah W.Feldstein|last2=Sakhardande|first2=Ashok|last3=Blakemore|first3=Sarah-Jayne|date=2014|title=The effect of alcohol consumption on the adolescent brain: A systematic review of MRI and fMRI studies of alcohol-using youth|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213158214000874|journal=NeuroImage: Clinical|volume=5|pages=420–437|via=ScienceDirect}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One area in which the alcohol industry has faced criticism and tightened legislation is in their alleged targeting of young people. Central to this is the development of [[alcopop]]s &amp;ndash; [[sweetness|sweet-tasting]], brightly coloured drinks with names that may appeal to a younger audience. However, numerous government and other reports have failed to support that allegation.&lt;ref name="Minors. Los Angeles Times 2006, pp. 357-69"&gt;(FTC Says Alcohol Type Not Aimed at Minors. Los Angeles Times, June 5, 2002;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archive.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2010/11/20/targeting_youth_to_start_drinking/|title=Targeting youth to start drinking|last=Jackson|first=Derrick Z.|date=2010-11-20|work=Boston Globe|access-date=2018-03-27|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/04/australia-ignoring-power-to-stop-alcohol-ads-reaching-children-experts-say|title=Australia failing to stop alcohol ads reaching children, experts say|last=Davey|first=Melissa|date=2017-10-04|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been several disputes over whether alcohol advertisements are targeting teens.  There happens to be heavy amounts of alcohol advertising that appears to make drinking fun and exciting.  Alcohol advertisements can be commonly seen in virtually any medium, they are especially known for sponsoring sporting events, concerts, magazines, and they are widely found on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.quitnow.gov.au/internet/anpha/publishing.nsf/Content/F641F67C6D6F52C5CA257C86001D5F19/$File/Alcohol%20Advertising%20DRAFT%20REPORT%20MASTER%20DOCUMENT%2020.2.14%20(D14-3314).pdf|title=Alcohol Advertising: The effectiveness of current regulatory codes in addressing community concern|last=|first=|date=2014|website=Australian National Preventative Health Agency|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the vendors’ websites require an age of 21 to enter, but there is no restriction besides simply entering a birth date. A study done by the [[American Journal of Public Health]] concluded that Boston train passengers between the ages of 11 and 18 saw an alcohol-related advertisement everyday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gentry|first=Elisabeth|last2=Poirier|first2=Katie|last3=Wilkinson|first3=Tiana|last4=Nhean|first4=Siphannay|last5=Nyborn|first5=Justin|last6=Siegel|first6=Michael|date=2011-10-01|title=Alcohol Advertising at Boston Subway Stations: An Assessment of Exposure by Race and Socioeconomic Status|url=http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2011.300159|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=101|issue=10|pages=1936–1941|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2011.300159|issn=0090-0036|pmc=3222337}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been studies similar to this, which supports the allegation that underage consumption of alcohol is in correlation with the exposure of alcohol ads.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In response, many cities have recognized the effect of alcohol-related ads on adolescents and in some cities these advertisements have been banned on public transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://adage.com/article/cmo-strategy/new-york-city-buses-trains-ban-alcohol-ads/311057/|title=As Alcohol Ads Sprawl Elsewhere, New York Buses and Trains Go Dry|last=Schultz|first=E.J.|date=2017|work=AdAge|access-date=2018-03-27|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is difficult to make definite allegations regarding youth exposure to these types of advertisements but it is necessary to find ways in which these allegations may be limited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?sid=115e9800-0c0b-4970-b6bd-ea87983bc2e4%40sessionmgr13&amp;vid=6&amp;hid=19&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=a9h&amp;AN=47513354 Web.ebscohost.com]. {{paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse reports the rates of binge alcohol use in 2008 were 1.5 percent among 12 or 13 years old, 6.9 percent among 14 or 15 years old, 17.2 percent among 16 or 17 years old, 33.7 percent among persons aged 18 to 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report| author = Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration| date = 2009| title = Results from the 2008 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: National Findings| url = http://www.dpft.org/resources/NSDUHresults2008.pdf| publisher = Office of Applied Studies, NSDUH Series H-36, HHS Publication No. SMA 09-4434| publication-place = Rockville, MD| access-date = November 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the rates for each group of underage alcohol usage increased by a fourth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report| author = Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration| date = 2010| title = Results from the 2009 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: Volume I.

According to 2001 College Alcohol Study (CAS), continuous alcohol promotions and advertisements including lowering prices on certain types of alcohol on a college campus have increased the percentage of alcohol consumption of that college community. Alcohol advertising on college campuses have also shown to increase binge drinking among students. However, it is concluded that the consistency of these special promotions and ads could also be useful in reducing binge drinking and other related drinking problems on campus. (Kuo, 2000, [[Henry Wechsler|Wechsler]] 2000, Greenberg 2000, Lee 2000).&lt;ref&gt;

* Results from one study indicate that beer advertisements are a significant predictor of an adolescent's knowledge, preference, and loyalty for beer brands, as well as current drinking behavior and intentions to drink (Gentile, 2001).
* Television advertising changes attitudes about drinking.  Young people report more positive feelings about drinking and their own likelihood to drink after viewing alcohol ads (Austin, 1994; Grube, 1994).
* The alcohol industry spends $2 billion per year on all media advertising (Strasburger, 1999).
* The beer brewing industry itself spent more than $770 million on television ads and $15 million on radio ads in 2000 (Center for Science in the Public Interest, 2002).

Research clearly indicates that, in addition to parents and peers, alcohol advertising and marketing significantly affect youth decisions to drink. (The Center on Alcohol Marketing and Youth [CAMY]).

"While many factors may influence an underage person's drinking decisions, including among other things parents, peers and the media, there is reason to believe that advertising also plays a role." (Federal Trade Commission, Self-Regulation in the Alcohol Industry, 1999)

Parents and peers substantially affect youth decisions to drink. However, research clearly indicates that alcohol advertising and marketing also have a significant effect by influencing youth and adult expectations and attitudes, and helping to create an environment that promotes underage drinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.camy.org/resources/fact-sheets/alcohol-advertising-and-youth/index.html|title=Alcohol Advertising and Youth|last=Stephenson|first=Steve|website=Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though people these days must put themselves into that situation, David H. Jernigan (2005: 314) underlines how “more than fifteen percent of twelve-year-olds will be likely to create the situation where youth are more likely per capita to see the magazine than adults over twenty-one years, the legal drinking age in the United States”.

===Malt liquor===
{{Main|Malt liquor#Advertising}}

The target market for [[malt liquor]] in the United States has been among the [[African-American]] and [[Hispanic]] populations in cities. Advertisers use themes of power and sexual dominance to appeal to customers. Critics have objected to ads targeting this segment of the population, which suffers disproportionately high rates of alcohol-related illness and poor access to medical care.

=== Among adolescents ===
Peter Anderson and his colleagues performed longitudinal studies and concluded that “alcohol advertising and promotion increases the likelihood that adolescents will start to use alcohol, and to drink more if they are already using alcohol.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Peter|last2=Bruijn|first2=Avalon de|last3=Angus|first3=Kathryn|last4=Gordon|first4=Ross|last5=Hastings|first5=Gerard|date=2009-05-01|title=Impact of Alcohol Advertising and Media Exposure on Adolescent Alcohol Use: A Systematic Review of Longitudinal Studies|url=http://alcalc.oxfordjournals.org/content/44/3/229|journal=Alcohol and Alcoholism|language=en|volume=44|issue=3|pages=229–243|doi=10.1093/alcalc/agn115|issn=0735-0414|pmid=19144976}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth D. Waiters, Andrew J. Treno, and Joel W. Grube’s discussions with a sample of youth, ages 9–15, support this claim. They found that these youth saw the purpose of beer commercials is to urge people to buy the product based on not only its quality, but also on “its relationship to sexual attractiveness.” They see the “attractive young adults drink beer to personally rewarding ends” and the “youth-oriented music” and are influenced to drink alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waiters|first=Elizabeth D.|last2=Treno|first2=Andrew J.|last3=Grube|first3=Joel W.|date=2001-12-01|title=Alcohol Advertising and Youth: A Focus-Group Analysis of What Young People Find Appealing in Alcohol Advertising|url=http://cdx.sagepub.com/content/28/4/695|journal=Contemporary Drug Problems|language=en|volume=28|issue=4|pages=695–718|doi=10.1177/009145090102800409|issn=0091-4509}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advertising around the world==
The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) has specified that the advertising and promotion of alcohol needs to be controlled. In September 2005, the WHO Euro Region adopted a Framework for Alcohol Policy for the Region. This has 5 ethical principles which includes "All children and adolescents have the right to grow up in an environment protected from the negative consequences of alcohol consumption and, to the extent possible, from the promotion of alcoholic beverages".&lt;ref&gt;

Cross-border television advertising within the [[European Union]] was previously regulated by the 1989 Television without Frontiers Directive, a [[Harmonisation of law|harmonisation]] measure designed to remove barriers to international trade as part of the [[common market]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:1989:298:0023:0030:EN:PDF Council Directive 89/552/EEC of 3 October 1989 on the coordination of certain provisions laid down by Law, Regulation or Administrative Action in Member States concerning the pursuit of television broadcasting activities]&lt;/ref&gt; Article 15 of this Directive sets out the restrictions on alcohol advertising:
* "it may not be aimed specifically at minors or, in particular, depict minors consuming these beverages;
* it shall not link the consumption of alcohol to enhanced physical performance or to driving;
* it shall not create the impression that the consumption of alcohol contributes towards social or sexual success;
* it shall not claim that alcohol has therapeutic qualities or that it is a stimulant, a sedative or a means of resolving personal conflicts;
* it shall not encourage immoderate consumption of alcohol or present abstinence or moderation in a negative light;
* it shall not place emphasis on high alcoholic content as being a positive quality of the beverages."

This article on alcohol advertising restrictions is implemented in each EU country largely through the self-regulatory bodies dealing with advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://adage.com/article/global-news/alcohol-advertisers-launch-regulation-pact-europe/234141/|title=Alcohol Advertisers Launch Self-Regulation Pact in Europe|last=Wentz|first=Laurel|date=2012|work=AdAge|access-date=2018-03-27|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU law 'TV without Frontiers' Directive has subsequently been expanded to cover new media formats such as digital television. Now called the 'Audiovisual Media Services Directive', the provisions regarding restrictions on alcohol advertising are laid out in Article 22 and are identical to the above.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2010:095:0001:0024:EN:PDF Directive 2010/13/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 March 2010 on the coordination of certain provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States concerning the provision of audiovisual media services (Audiovisual Media Services Directive)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some countries, such as [[France]], [[Norway]], [[Russia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Russia slaps ban on alcohol advertising in media|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18960770|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ukraine]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/56294/ Tobacco, alcohol advertising bans take effect in printed media], [[Kyiv Post]] (January 1, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Myanmar]], [[Sri Lanka]],&lt;ref name="SriLanka" /&gt; and [[Kenya]] have banned all alcohol advertising on television and billboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4080074.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Africa - Kenya to outlaw alcohol adverts|publisher=|accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{see also|Alcohol advertising on college campuses|Alcohol consumption by youth in the United States}}

In the United States, spirits advertising has [[self-regulatory bodies]] that create standards for the ethical advertising of alcohol. The special concern is where advertising is placed.

Currently, the standard is that alcohol advertisements can only be placed in media where 70% of the audience is over the legal drinking age. Alcohol advertising's creative messages should not be designed to appeal to people under the age of 21, for example, using cartoon characters as spokespeople is discouraged. Advertising cannot promote brands based on alcohol content or its effects. Advertising must not encourage irresponsible drinking. Another issue in media placement is whether media vendors will accept alcohol advertising. The decision to accept an individual ad or a category of advertising is always at the discretion of the owner or publisher of a media outlet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alcohol.org/|title=Did You Know?: How Advertising of Alcohol in the U.S. is Regulated|last=|first=|date=|website=Alcohol.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, U.S. Surgeon General [[Antonia Novello]] criticized alcoholic beverage companies for "unabashedly targeting teenagers" with "sexual imagery, cartoons, and rock and rap music" in television and print ads.{{refn|name=Davidson}}{{rp|113–5}} The [[Federal Trade Commission]] conducted an investigation in 2002 into possible targeting to those under the age of 21. However, this investigation and those of some scholars have not found evidence of such targeting.&lt;ref name="Minors. Los Angeles Times 2006, pp. 357-69"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Jon P. Alcohol advertising in magazines: Do beer, wine, and spirits ads target youth? ''[[Contemporary Economic Policy]]'', July 2006, pp. 357-69).&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns exist that irresponsible advertising practices or "pushing the envelope" with audience composition may lead to permanent legislation governing the advertising of beverage alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discus.org/industry/code/code.htm "Code"].

===Asia===

In [[Malaysia]], alcohol advertising on radio and televisions was outlawed in 1995. On Malaysian television, alcohol advertising is not shown before 10:00 pm and during Malay-language programs. However, non-Malay newspapers and magazines are allowed to continue alcohol advertising. [[Supermarket]]s and [[hypermarket]]s have also been criticized for advertising alcohol products on trolleys, which is controversial because Islam is the state religion of the country. After the ban of alcohol advertising on Malaysian radio and televisions, they continued to build the brands with sponsorships of concerts and entertainment events.

In [[Singapore]], alcohol advertisement is not allowed to be shown during programmes intended for children and young persons and during Malay-language programmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iogt.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Alcohol-Advertising_A-Global-Legal-Perspective.pdf|title=Alcohol Advertising: A Global Legal Perspective|last=|first=|date=2011|website=Global Advertising Lawyers Alliance|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Indonesia]], alcohol advertising was legal in the 1990s, but have since been completely banned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/publications/policy_indonesia.pdf 2004 Global Status Report: Alcohol Policy]. World Health Organisation. Retrieved 2018-03-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hong Kong]], alcohol advertising is not allowed to be shown during Family Viewing Hour programmes.

In the [[Philippines]], alcohol advertising is allowed. Alcohol warning is also shown in the end of the advertisement explaining with the words: "Drink Moderately". In 2012, the warning was changed to "Drink Responsibly".

In Thailand, alcohol advertisements are still allowed, but must accompanied by a warning message. See [[Alcohol advertising in Thailand]].

In [[Sri Lanka]], public advertising on alcohol is banned totally since 2006.&lt;ref name="SriLanka"&gt;

In Russia, advertising alcohol products is banned from almost all media (including television and billboards) since January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-18960770|title=Russia bans alcohol ads in media|date=2012-07-23|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before that, alcohol advertising was restricted from using images of people drinking since mid-2000's.

In Sweden, since 2010 advertisements are legal for wine and beer, but not on television and radio. Non-periodic magazines are allowed to advertise alcoholic beverages above 15%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.notisum.se/rnp/sls/lag/20101622.htm Alkohollag (2010:1622)]&lt;/ref&gt; These advertisements must contain warnings, but which are worded less strongly than the warnings on tobacco products - for example, "[[Fetal alcohol syndrome|Avoid drinking while pregnant]]," as opposed to "[[Tobacco packaging warning messages#Sweden|smoking kills]]." These rules were introduced into the law 2010&lt;ref&gt;[http://rkrattsbaser.gov.se/sfsr?fritext=1994%3A1738&amp;sort=desc&amp;post_id=1 Regeringskansliets rättsdatabaser Alkohollag (1994:1738)]&lt;/ref&gt; based on the provisions of an [[EU directive]], {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} provisionally applied by Swedish newspapers since 2005. Before that alcohol advertisements were forbidden, except for "class 1 beer" or "[[light beer]]." Such advertisements were common, as stronger beers which shared a name with advertised light beers, may have benefit from this.

In Finland, [[Parliament of Finland]] decided to ban alcohol outdoor advertising, except during sport events. This new law is going to take place in January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lib.eduskunta.fi/Resource.phx/kirjasto/oikeudellinentieto/tietopaketit/alkoholimainonta.htx | title=Alkoholimainonnan rajoittaminen | publisher=Eduskunnan Kirjasto | accessdate=14 November 2014|language=fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] have banned several ads that don't comply with the restrictions in the EU directive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Strongbow's YouTube spoof and seven other banned alcohol adverts|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/34474456/strongbows-youtube-spoof-and-seven-other-banned-alcohol-adverts|work=BBC Newsbeat|date=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Norway, Advertising on alcohol is banned totally since 1975.

In September 2017, Facebook announced it would allow users to hide all alcohol advertisements. The move is debated within the UK, as Alcohol Research UK group welcomed the change, while the Alcohol Standards Authority, said the UK already had some of the strictest rules in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Strongbow's YouTube spoof and seven other banned alcohol adverts|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-41332082|work=BBC News|date=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2018, Ireland introduced a law banning alcohol advertisements near schools, children play areas, public transportation, and cinemas, as well as restricting visibility of alcohol products in stores. The legislation will take effect November 2019. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ireland’s minister for health Simon Harris has signed a “groundbreaking” law to ban alcohol advertising near schools and play areas and restrict visibility of alcohol in stores over the next two years.|url=https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2018/11/ireland-passes-ground-breaking-alcohol-advertising-law/|work=Spirits Business|date=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responsible drinking campaigns ==

There have been various campaigns to help prevent [[alcoholism]], under-age drinking and [[driving under the influence|drunk driving]]. The [[Portman Group]], an association of leading drinks producers in the UK, are responsible for various such campaigns. These include [[drinking culture|responsible drinking]], drink driving (and [[designated driver]]s), [[proof of age]] cards.  The ''Drink Aware'' campaign,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://drinkaware.co.uk/|title=Home|publisher=|accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, aims to educate people about how to drink sensibly and avoid [[binge drinking]]. The web site address is displayed as part of all of the adverts for products made by members of the group.

[[The Century Council]], financially supported by a group of alcoholic beverage distillers in the United States, promotes responsible decision-making regarding drinking or non-drinking and works to reduce all forms of irresponsible consumption. Since its founding in 1991, it has invested over 175 million dollars in its programs.

Many campaigns by the alcoholic beverage industry that advocate responsible drinking presuppose that drinking for recreational purposes is a positive activity and reinforce this idea as an example of sensible consumption. Persons who believe alcohol can never simultaneously be used "sensibly" and recreationally would obviously disagree with the focus or direction of these campaigns.

A controversial anti-drunk driving advertisement in South Africa has threatened the public with rape in prison. The campaign is still underway with no reported complaints to the advertising standards authorities.&lt;ref&gt;

== Sponsorship in sport ==
[[File:Brad Keselowski, 2013 STP Gas Booster 500.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Miller Lite]] sponsored car of [[Brad Keselowski]] in the [[NASCAR]] [[Sprint Cup Series]]]]
The [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]]ship of sporting events and sportspeople is banned in many countries. For example, the primary club competition in European [[rugby union]], the [[Heineken Cup]], is called the ''H Cup'' in [[France]] because of that country's restrictions on alcohol advertising. However, such sponsorship is still common in other areas, such as the [[United States]], although such sponsorship is controversial as children are often a target audience for major professional sports leagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB9073/index1.html | title=Forging the Link Between Alcohol Advertising and Underage Drinking | publisher=Rand Corporation | date=2006 | accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/resources/educational/teaching_backgrounders/alcohol/alcohol_ads_and_sports.cfm "Alcohol ads and sports"]. Media-awareness.ca.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806133216/http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/resources/educational/teaching_backgrounders/alcohol/alcohol_ads_and_sports.cfm |date=August 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alcohol advertising is common in [[motor racing]] competitions, and is particularly prominent in [[NASCAR]] and [[IndyCar]].  One major example of this was the [[Busch Series]] (now known as the Xfinity Series), sponsored by a brand of [[beer]] sold by [[Anheuser-Busch]]. That sponsorship, which started in the series' conversion from a national Late Model Sportsman races around the country to the present touring format in 1982, ended after 2007.

[[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]], the best-known Anheuser-Busch brand, has sponsored IndyCar drivers such as [[Mario Andretti]], [[Bobby Rahal]] and [[Paul Tracy]], as well as NASCAR Cup drivers such as [[Terry Labonte]], [[Neil Bonnett]], [[Darrell Waltrip]], [[Bill Elliott]], [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]], [[Kasey Kahne]] and currently [[Kevin Harvick]]. Meanwhile, [[Miller Brewing Company|Miller]] has sponsored [[Al Unser]], [[Danny Sullivan]], Bobby Rahal, [[Rusty Wallace]], [[Kurt Busch]] and currently [[Brad Keselowski]].

Furthermore, NASCAR mandates drivers under 21 not be permitted to wear any alcohol-branded sticker on their cars. In cases with below drinking age drivers, a specialised "[[Pole position|Coors Pole Award - 21 Means 21]]" sticker is placed on such drivers' cars. One team, [[Petty Enterprises]], refuses to participate in alcohol advertising and forfeits all alcohol monies and bonuses.

For distilled spirits, teams must run a responsible drinking sticker clearly visible on the car. For [[Jack Daniel's]], the theme is "Pace Yourself, Drink Responsibly", and includes on NASCAR's Web site a waving yellow flag warning drinkers. For [[Crown Royal]], the television ads feature the car with the slogan "Be a champion, Drink Responsibly" and it acting as a pace car to drivers, warning them of responsibility. Jim Beam has radio ads and NASCAR mandated statements about alcohol control. None of the three, however, is a full-time sponsor, as they alternate sponsorship with other products unrelated to their firm on the car.  (Jim Beam's parent, Fortune Brands, sometimes has its [[Moen (company)|Moen Faucet]]s replace Jim Beam on the car in selected races.)

Although [[tobacco]] companies have been the main source of financial backing in [[Formula One]], some alcohol brands have also been associated with the sport. For example, [[Martini &amp; Rossi|Martini]] appears on the [[Williams F1]] car while [[Johnnie Walker]] has sponsored [[McLaren]] since 2006.

Anheuser-Busch, being a conglomerate with non-alcoholic properties, complies with the French alcohol advertising ban in Formula One by placing their Busch Entertainment theme park logos (mostly [[SeaWorld]]) where their Budweiser logo would appear on the [[Williams F1]] car at races where alcohol advertising is banned and in Middle Eastern countries, where alcohol advertising is discouraged. A few companies, however, have added responsible drinking campaigns with their sponsorship, notably the 1989–90 [[British Touring Car Championship|BTCC]] [[Ford Sierra|Ford Sierra RS500]] of [[Tim Harvey]] and [[Laurence Bristow]], which was sponsored by [[Labatt]]. Throughout the two seasons, the car bore a "Please Don't Drink and Drive" message.

Some stadiums, particularly in the U.S., bear the names of breweries or beer brands via [[naming rights]] arrangements, such as [[Busch Stadium]], [[Coors Field]], and [[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|Miller Park]]; those three venues are all in or near the cities of their headquarters.

[[Diageo]] are a major sponsor of many sporting events through their various brands.  For example, [[Johnnie Walker]] sponsor the [[Johnnie Walker Championship at Gleneagles|Championship at Gleneagles]] and [[Johnnie Walker Classic|Classic]] [[golf]] tournaments along with the Team [[McLaren]] Formula One car.

[[Cricket]] is a sport with a large amount of alcohol sponsorship. [[The 2005 Ashes]], for example, featured sponsorship hoardings by brands such as [[Red Stripe]], [[Thwaites Brewery|Thwaites Lancaster Bomber]] and [[Wolf Blass|Wolf Blass wines]]. In nations like India and Sri Lanka where alcoholic advertising is generally prohibited, those regulations are rounded with distillers offering clothing lines and sports equipment marked with one of their brands or separate [[soft drink]] or [[bottled water]] lines within tournaments such as the [[Indian Premier League]] and test matches, such as [[United Spirits Limited]]'s [[McDowell's No.1]] and [[Pernod Ricard]]'s [[Royal Stag]].

[[Rugby union]] also has a substantial amount of alcohol sponsorship. The [[All Blacks]] feature [[Steinlager]] sponsorship prominently. The [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland national team]] has a long-established relationship with [[The Famous Grouse]], a brand of [[Scotch whisky]]. [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]] has a more recent relationship with the [[Brains Brewery|Brains]] brewery (But wear "Brawn" when playing in France), and the [[South Africa national rugby union team|Springboks]] of [[South Africa]] agreed for [[South African Breweries]] to put the Lion Lager, then, the [[SABMiller brands#Castle brewery|Castle Lager]] brand on their shirt until 2004. [[Magners]] was the title sponsor of the [[Pro14|Celtic League]], the top competition in [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]], [[Guinness]] is the title sponsor of the [[Guinness Premiership]], the top competition in [[England]], and the beer brand [[Tooheys New]] was the [[Australia]]n sponsor of the Southern Hemisphere [[Super Rugby|Super 14]] competition through the 2006 season. [[Bundaberg Rum]] is one of the sponsors of the [[Australia national rugby union team]].

[[Rugby league in Australia]] is sponsored by [[Victoria Bitter]] and [[Bundaberg Rum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21475237-23289,00.html|title=Nocookies|work=The Australian|accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campaigns ==

=== Guinness ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Guinness Toucan-ad.jpg|thumb|One of the [[Guinness]] advertising posters from the Gilroy Era of the 40's]] --&gt;
[[Guinness]]' iconic stature can be attributed in part to its advertising campaigns. One of the most notable and recognizable series of adverts was created by [[S.H. Benson]]'s advertising, primarily [[John Gilroy (artist)|John Gilroy]], in the 1930s and 1940s.  Gilroy was responsible for creating posters which included such phrases such as "Guinness for Strength", "It's a Lovely Day for a Guinness", and most famously, "Guinness is Good For You". The posters featured Gilroy's distinctive artwork and more often than not featured animals such as a [[kangaroo]], [[ostrich]], [[Pinniped|seal]], [[lion]], and notably a [[toucan]], which has become as much a symbol of Guinness as the [[Trinity College Harp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=I8KVxbDmAfkC&amp;dq=gilroy+toucan+symbol&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=The Search for God and Guinness: A Biography of the Beer that Changed the World|last=Mansfield|first=Stephen|date=2009-10-12|publisher=Thomas Nelson|isbn=9781418580674|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guinness advertising paraphernalia attracts high prices on the collectible market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/goodness-guinness-memorabilias-worth-90000-8143706|title=How one man's passion for Guinness earned him £90,000|last=Read|first=Simon|date=2016-06-09|work=Mirror|access-date=2018-03-26|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a campaign reminiscent of [[viral marketing]] techniques, one advert quickly appeared as a [[screensaver]] distributed over the [[Internet]]. It was a simple concept, featuring [[Dublin]] actor Joe McKinney dancing around the drink while it was given time to settle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=haribokey|title=Guinness Anticipation Advert|date=2008-09-30|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5HU5axz6GI|accessdate=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The accompanying music ([[Mambo (music)|mambo]] tune ''Guaglione'' by [[Pérez Prado]]) was released as a single and reached number one on the Irish charts in September 1994 and number two on the [[1995 in British music|UK charts]] in May 1995 (see [[List of number-one singles of 1994 (Ireland)]] [[List of UK top 10 singles in 1995]]).

In Malaysia, Singapore, and Hong Kong, Guinness launched a $8 million advertising campaign using the fictional character of Adam King to promote the embodiment of Guinness as a man could be incredibly powerful. The advertising campaign was handled by advertising firm, [[Saatchi &amp; Saatchi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.josh.com.my/whoisadamking.com/ Who is Adam King?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809072150/http://www.josh.com.my/whoisadamking.com/ |date=2007-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Africa]], the character of [[Michael Power (advertisement)|Michael Power]] has been used since 1999 to boost sales.

Today, Guinness' principal television campaign in North America consists of [[limited animation]] commercials featuring two eccentric scientists in 19th-century dress complimenting one another's ideas as "brilliant!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=boreczkizoli|title=guinness ad|date=2007-04-29|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DPKf7y1F-Q|accessdate=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Absolut ===
[[Absolut]] vodka is made in [[Sweden]] and was introduced to the United States in the year 1979. Its launch was a true challenge due to a variety of factors: Sweden was not perceived as a vodka-producing country, the bottle was very awkward for bartenders to use, and vodka was perceived as a cheap, tasteless drink. Absolut's advertising campaign by [[TBWA]] exploited the shape of the bottle to create clever advertisements that caused people to become involved in the advertising, and the brand took off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.uxeria.com/en/absolut-the-story-of-the-unusual-bottle/|title=Absolut - the story of the (un)usual bottle - Uxeria Blog|last=Markiewicz|first=Magdalena|date=|website=blog.uxeria.com|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before Absolut, there were very few distinctions in the vodka category. Today there are regular, premium, and superpremium vodkas each at different price points and qualities. Flavoured vodka varieties have become numerous and may be found commonly in stores in the U.S.A.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2015/04/flavoured-vodka-not-dead-but-market-evolving/|title=Flavoured Vodka Market not Dead but Evolving|last=|first=|date=2015|website=The Spirits Business|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alcohol sponsorship in sport===
Sport has been suggested to be one of the primary, if not the dominant, medium for the promotion of alcohol and drinking to the general population with the majority of advertising spend an advertising placement occurring in sport.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.camy.org/bin/s/a/Alcohol_Advertising_on_Sports_Television.pdf "Alcohol Advertising on Sports Television 2001 to 2003"].

The '''Arbeitskreis Börse''' (abbreviated '''AKB''' or '''AK Boerse''') is a [[non-profit organization]] located in [[Mannheim]] ([[Germany]]), focused on [[investment banking]], [[capital markets]], consulting and [[start-up companies]] within the [[financial technology]] sector. It is the oldest financial association lead by students in Germany and with over 1,000 members among the largest student organizations in Germany. The Arbeitskreis Börse is dedicated to connect students interested in financial markets associated with worldwide leading [[bank]]s and [[consulting firms]]. These include [[Bank of America Merrill Lynch]], [[KPMG]] and [[Oliver Wyman]], which are premium partners of Arbeitskreis Börse. It is organized first and foremost by students of the [[University of Mannheim]] but is receiving increasing support from students of other tertiary establishments in [[Mannheim]].
{{TOC limit|2}}

== History ==
The Arbeitskreis Börse was founded in response to a perceived gap in the services provided by student societies at the [[University of Mannheim]]. Students interested in the [[stock exchange]] and [[financial markets]], that sought to actively participate in [[capital markets]] did not have the opportunity to do so whilst engaging on campus as no such opportunity had yet been offered. 
Therefore, a small group of students independently organized an evening event within the university with the aim of creating a platform for students interested in the financial markets . Supported by the University this group developed into a non-profit association which was registered by the city of [[Mannheim]] on November 6th 1984.

Corresponding with positive developments within financial markets, membership within the Arbeitskreis Börse steadily grew to exceed 1,000 students within a few years. Through their stock market analysis and research papers the Arbeitskries Börse rapidly became well throughout the [[Rhine-Neckar]] area, which led to leading global investment banks and consulting firms taking notice of the Arbeitskreis Börse. At the [[University of Mannheim]] the lecture series "Semester Program of the Arbeitskreis Börse" was established and the Arbeitskreis Börse focused on building partnerships with financial institutions within the European financial hubs, London and Frankfurt in the following years. To satisfy external requests the "Kreis der Freunde und Förderer des AKB" was founded in October 1988, an association that could be joined by everyone interested in the Arbeitskreis Börse.

Today the Arbeitskreis Börse is the largest finance association run by students in Germany and the largest student society at the [[University of Mannheim]]. The Arbeitskreis Börse still provides the same extensive semester program and within the framework of their lectures they attract renowned speakers from both the world's leading investment banks and consulting firms. While doing this the students of the [[University of Mannheim]] get the chance to develop business contacts at several networking events. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akboerse.de/wir-ueber-uns/historie/|title= History of Arbeitskreis Börse|accessdate =2016-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==
As a student initiative, the Arbeitskreis Börse is mainly organized by students of the [[University of Mannheim]] in addition to several students from other tertiary establishments in [[Mannheim]]. In June, the Arbeitskreis Börse annually appoints its new leading team and executive board. The team is made up of the heads of five resorts: member management, [[event management]], [[Information technology|IT]], [[marketing]] and social events. The executive board consists of five additional students who are responsible for resort management, [[finances]], working groups, semester programme, special events, contacts to the university, developments of the Arbeitskreis Börse as an association, premium partners and other cooperation partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akboerse.de/wir-ueber-uns/team/|title= Team of Arbeitskreis Börse|accessdate= 2016-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arbeitskreis Börse is supported by external partners, including [[Oliver Wyman]], [[Boston Consulting Group|BCG]], [[Bank of America Merrill Lynch]], [[KPMG]], [[PricewaterhouseCoopers|PwC]] as well as the [[Mannheim Business School]] and alumni.

== Activities and semester program ==
The Arbeitskreis Börse attempts to form a direct link between the theoretical frameworks covered in academic studies and the practical application of these within a company. 
During each semester various events are organized on Mannheim's main [[campus]] - the [[Mannheim Palace]] in [[Mannheim]], [[Baden-Württemberg]], [[Germany]]. Firstly topical lectures are held by renowned individuals from within the financial or consulting industry, these have for instance included Armin von Falkenhayn, Head of Global Corporate and Investment Banking Germany at [[Bank of America Merrill Lynch]]; Dr. Marcus Schenk, [[Chief Financial Officer]] at [[Deutsche Bank]]: Christian Zorn, Head of Investment Banking Germany at [[Morgan Stanley]] and Frank Mattern, former [[CEO]] at [[McKinsey &amp; Co.]]. Occasionally representatives of other industries such as [[Kurt Bock]], [[CEO]] at [[BASF SE]], are invited to hold such lectures. Secondly, several company [[workshops]] as well as student work groups are conducted to support Mannheim students aspiring a career in the financial sector. Within these lectures, the various companies prepare case studies that provide insight into their structure and everyday work environment. Following these lectures, the audience is able to discuss specific topics with top tier personalities and get to know company recruiters as well as employees.

The companies that have held lectures or offered workshops during the past years in cooperation with the Arbeitskreis Börse are - besides the premium partners [[Bank of America Merrill Lynch]], [[KPMG]] and [[Oliver Wyman]] - leading banks such as [[Morgan Stanley]], [[Goldman Sachs]], [[J. P. Morgan]], [[Credit Suisse]], [[Commerzbank]], [[Fidelity]], [[Deutsche Bank]], [[Barclays]], [[Royal Bank of Scotland]], [[Lazard]], [[N M Rothschild &amp; Sons]], [[UBS]], [[RBC Capital Markets]], [[Leonardo &amp; Co.]] and [[Jefferies]], the central banks [[European Central Bank]] and [[Deutsche Bundesbank]] in addition to leading consulting firms such as [[Bain &amp; Company]], [[Boston Consulting Group]], [[McKinsey &amp; Co.]], [[Roland Berger Strategy Consultants]], [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]], [[L.E.K. Consulting]], [[strategy&amp;]]. Further cooperating companies are [[Ernst &amp; Young]], [[Perella Weinberg Partners]], Blackstone, [[3i|3I]], [[Fresenius]] and [[BASF SE]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akboerse.de/events/archiv/|title=Event archives of Arbeitskreis Börse|accessdate=2016-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lectures ===
In cooperation with several company partners the Arbeitskreis Börse organizes an extensive lecture series every semester, composed of up to 12 company presentations and technical lectures concerned with current topics from the financial community and industry. To do so, companies from the fields of [[investment banking]], [[asset management]], [[consulting]] and [[auditing]] are invited to create a thought provoking presentation that explores various points of view. The lectures demonstrate relationships between the latest case studies and theoretical foundations from academia as well as findings from their business applications. At the following get-together with snacks and drinks students have the opportunity to get in personal contact with the speakers, to discuss specialist topics and ask questions regarding internships and career options.&lt;ref name="Startseite"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akboerse.de/start/|title=akboerse.de|accessdate=2016-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Workshops ===
Similar to this, the Arbeitskreis Börse, in cooperation with company partners organises numerous workshops every semester. Case studies offer a rare opportunity to gain better insight into specific business divisions and to analyse complex business matters. After the presentation of results, students come into contact with employees and are able ask specific questions and acquire information about a potential career within these companies. Getting to know preferences and strengths during the workshops makes it easier for a single business division or a certain enterprise to make a decision.&lt;ref name="Startseite" /&gt;

=== Working groups ===
Another task of the Arbeitskreis Börse is to transmit knowledge in Excel and Bloomberg and to encourage active discussions with problems from the area of finance industry and management consultancy. Students can meet weekly to acquire and deepen fundamental knowledge in the respective subject areas under instruction from experienced Alumni to be optimally prepared for internships and entry into the workforce. To advanced students, a platform to discuss highly demanding problems is offered. The knowledge acquired in the working groups is indispensable for future entry into financial business.&lt;ref name="Startseite" /&gt;

=== Social events ===
During each semester, numerous social events take place, which promote cohesion among members and help familiarise students with recently joined fellow students as well provide a temporary escape from stressful university life. Thus the students become part of a large community that outlasts their time at university and allows Alumni to return to Mannheim annually.&lt;ref name="Startseite" /&gt;

The '''Biosciences Federation''' (BSF) was a [[United Kingdom]] body formed in 2002.

==Function==
The Federation aimed to unite the [[bioscience]] community over issues of common interest that related to both research and teaching. These organisations are a key component of the UK's [[knowledge economy]]. It also aimed to influence the formulation of UK policy relating to biosciences, and to promote public debate on ethical issues. Its interests were in using knowledge gained in research to benefit society, and the impact of legislation on the life sciences industry.

===Events===
Each November, it would hold the ''Life Sciences Careers Conference''.

==Structure==
During October 2009, the Biosciences Federation was merged with the [[Institute of Biology]] (IoB) to form the [[Society of Biology]] (which boasts some 80,000 members).&lt;ref&gt;[http://societyofbiology.org/newsandevents/news/view/19 - The IoB &amp; BSF merge to form the Society of Biology (5 October 2009)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The last president of the Federation was Dame [[Nancy Rothwell]] (2006–9); [[Richard Dyer (biologist)|Richard Dyer]], former director of the [[Babraham Institute]], was the chief executive officer (2006–9). Sir [[Tom Blundell]] was a former president (2004–6).

===Affiliated organisations in the federation===
From 2007, the Biosciences Federation encompassed 51 member or associated organisations that covered the entire range of life sciences; these included 
* [[Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry]]
* [[Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour]]

==Activities==
The Federation responded to government consultations on biology-related issues; these responses were published on the Federation's website. It also distributed science policy news to a range of organisations that included universities, research councils, pharmaceutical companies and government bodies. The Federation hosted several life sciences careers conferences and symposia on issues such as [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] publishing. It also supported the annual award for scientific communication.

[[File:Boutors Khoury - Avec sa femme et ses enfants.jpg|thumb|right|Boutros el-Khoury with his spouse and children.]]
Khoury was born in 1907 in the village of [[Karmsaddeh|Karm Sadde]], in the [[Zgharta District|Zghorta District]] ([[North Governorate|North Lebanon]]), the son of Salim and Myriam el-Khoury. His family hailed from the [[Lebanese diaspora]] in the [[French West Africa|French colonies]] of [[West Africa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Arsan |first1=Andrew |title=Interlopers of empire: the Lebanese diaspora in colonial French West Africa |date=2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=9780199333387 |accessdate=24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with some members, including his father, residing in Senegal . Khoury lost his parents at an early age: his father died abroad on the day he was born, while his mother passed away when he was three years old. Khoury was subsequently raised first by his grandparents and then by his paternal aunt, Sayde Khoury, while his father's uncle, Abbas Abboud, who resided in Senegal, supported him financially. It was Abboud who initiated Khoury to the world of [[business]] and [[commerce]] early on in his life.

===Education===
Khoury studied at the Mar Yaacoub school in his home village and graduated from the al-Alam school in the village of [[Daraya, Zgharta|Daraya, Zghorta]].

==Business career==

Khoury pursued a career in business, and by the 1960s had become one of the wealthiest men in Lebanon thanks to his investments in various sectors of the economy.

Khoury's career began at the age of 20. He started out in the [[oil]] business, dividing his time between his home village and [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] until, the beginnings of the 1930s, he moved permanently to [[North Governorate|North Lebanon]]’s capital, where it was easier for him to run his business and broaden his contacts. He then shifted easily from [[trade]] to [[industry]] and conducted many successful partnerships with well-established businessmen in various fields, founding companies such as the Stephan and Khoury company (created with Joseph and Sayed Stephan of [[Kfarsghab]]), the Kfoury–Khoury company (founded with Al Kfoury from [[Khenchara]], [[Metn District]]), the “Al Ghazzal Transports” with Ghattas el-Murr, and Fadel Al-Ghandour from [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]], among others.

===La Kadisha===
[[File:Boutros Khoury - Devant Al-Kadisha.jpg|left|thumb|In front of "La Kadisha" with various political figures.]]
Over the course of the 1920s, Khoury gained a thorough understanding of financial [[investment]]. In accordance with the traditional role played at that time by the [[Lebanese diaspora]] in the country's economy, the young sheikh reinvested the money he received from his family abroad, including his great-uncle Abboud from [[Senegal]], in various local businesses.

In this respect, his experience in the [[hydroelectric]] company "La Kadisha" highlighted early on his innate talents as a businessman. The company had been founded in 1924 by prominent figures in [[Bsharri]], such as the Keirouz and Geagea families, with the [[Maronite Catholic Archeparchy of Tripoli|Maronite Archbishop of Tripoli]], [[Anthony Peter Arida]], also playing an important role. Under the [[Greater Lebanon|French Mandate]], the company had obtained the concession to provide electricity in [[North Governorate|North Lebanon]], from the [[Kadisha Valley]] to the city of [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Lebanon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Official Gazette of the Lebanese Government |date=7 August 1924}}&lt;/ref&gt; First introduced into the company through his uncle Abbas, Khoury quickly rose through its ranks, and in 1929, at the age of 22, was elected to the administrative council. In 1929, La Kadisha merged with the Abu Ali hydroelectric plant, the power concession for which had been granted to the Stephan brothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Official Gazette of the Lebanese Government |date=4 April 1930}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 10, 1930, Khoury was re-elected to the new council. He gradually acquired a majority stake in the company, until on May 14, 1953, he bought the majority of shares owned by the French shareholders of the companies La Pyrénéenne and La Toulousaine. He then became president of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=[[Le Commerce du Levant]] |date=20 May 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khoury's years working in the administration of La Kadisha had a significant impact on his economic and political outlook. The economic thought of Albert Naccache, author of La Kadisha [[hydroelectric]] project, was especially influential. Naccache advocated greater industrial development in Lebanon, contrary to the widespread ideology at the time that was influenced by the ideas of [[Michel Chiha]], according to which Lebanon was a “merchant republic” devoid of any raw materials. Naccache called for the establishment of a large network of hydroelectric power plants across the country that would be financed and managed entirely by Lebanese capital and executives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Interview with Albert Naccache |publisher=[[L'Orient-Le Jour|L'Orient]] |date=30 March 1926}}&lt;/ref&gt; This experience gave Khoury a taste for industrial adventure and contributed to his grander vision for the national economy.

===Agriculture===

[[File:Boutros Khoury work desk.jpg|thumb|right|The young Sheikh Boutros el-Khoury.]]
Khoury's interest in [[agriculture]] also began at an early age, due to his rural upbringing. He started trading in agricultural products, beginning with [[olive oil]], which he sold through [[North Governorate|North Lebanon]] before committing to the purchase and resale of [[flour]] and [[wheat]] to the whole of [[Lebanon]]. From the late 1940s onward, he negotiated the cost price per kilogram of both flour and wheat with the Ministry of National Economy. His concern for the agricultural industry and the rural world was evident from the start of his parliamentary career: He was elected as head of the Commission of Agriculture and Food Supply for two consecutive terms in 1946 and 1947, as well as head of the Commission of Public Works in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=[[L'Orient-Le Jour|L'Orient]] |date=20 March 1946}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=[[L'Orient-Le Jour|L'Orient]] |date=19 March 1947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, Khoury became involved in the fight against the monopolization of [[staple foods]] and rising prices and became one of the leading figures in the world of trade. He was often consulted by authorities in times of national emergency. During the [[1958 Lebanon crisis]], he belonged to the group of traders that sounded the alarm about the paralysis of commercial activity in the country, and publicly encouraged the unloading of boats in the Port of Beirut to avoid food shortages.
 
In addition to his involvement in the wheat trade, Khoury also revolutionized [[sugar]] production in Lebanon. In 1963, in his capacity as representative of [[sugar refiner]]s, he advised [[Prime Minister of Lebanon]] [[Rashid Karami]] on the measures to be taken to meet the country's sugar requirements for the following year. His suggestion was to encourage the production of [[sugar beet]], almost nonexistent in Lebanon at the time, in order to boost domestic output and allow the country to move towards self-sufficiency in sugar production. He was also one of the largest shareholders in the [[Anjar, Lebanon|Anjar]] sugar factory, playing a key role in the resolution of the sugar beet crisis that lasted from December 1964 to June 1965 and which saw the [[Bekaa]] peasants clashing with the management of the factory itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=[[L'Orient-Le Jour|L'Orient]] |date=30 December 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khoury's stature and position as a prominent industrialist made him inclined to a traditional and benevolent social paternalism towards the peasants. To help Lebanese farmers and combat rural exodus, he was actively involved with the Banque de Crédit Agricole, Industriel et Foncier (BCAIF), founded in 1954, becoming chairman in 1958. During the banana crisis caused by the violent storm of November 20, 1964, which destroyed production for an entire season, Khoury offered long-term loans to banana growers in order to alleviate their difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=[[L'Orient-Le Jour|Le Jour]] |date=24 December 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industry and commerce===

[[File:Boutros Khoury - Camille Chamoun - Antoine Abed Tripoli.jpg|thumb|right|Boutros el-Khoury with [[Lebanese President]] [[Camille Chamoun]], [[Maronite Catholic Archeparchy of Tripoli|Maronite Archbishop of Tripoli]] [[Antoine Abed]] and [[Mufti]] of [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] Kazem Mikati.]]
Khoury was one of the pillars of Lebanese industry during the second half of the 20th century, and he was a keen supporter of investment of Lebanese capital in the industrial sector, which he advocated as a means of increasing the national income and curbing unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=[[L'Orient-Le Jour|Le Jour]] |date=17 October 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also president of the Association of Industrialists from 1965 to 1975, and called for the establishment of a Ministry of Industry.

Khoury's first industrial ventures were in the [[electricity]] sector. He invested at an early stage in the La Kadisha company, and in 1948 founded another [[hydroelectric]] company, Al-Bared, with two other partners . Through these two companies, Khoury helped to solve the electricity crisis that plagued Lebanon between 1952 and 1954. He proposed linking Beirut to the networks of Qadisha, Nahr el-Bared and Nahr el-Joz to overcome the power cuts in the capital, with Al-Bared handling the operation. In an effort to strengthen the energy sector, he demanded in 1956 a government loan of 5 million [[Lebanese pound|LBP]] to La Kadisha in order to avoid an increase in electricity tariffs.

Khoury was also involved in the [[cement]] industry. In 1963, he became a shareholder in the Lebanese Cement Company, founded in 1929 by the [[Maronite Church|Maronite Patriarchate]] in [[Chekka]], having supplied its factories with electricity through the Al-Bared company since 1956.

[[File:Boutros Khoury - Dans l'une de ses usines.jpg|left|thumb|Boutros el-Khoury at one of his factories.]]
In 1952, through several companies founded in conjunction with various business partners from [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] Khoury helped establish a [[Free-trade zone|free zone]] in the [[Port of Tripoli (Lebanon)|Port of Tripoli]], building port facilities and warehouses and supplying the necessary machinery for the transfer of goods. This expanded the port significantly, as well as strengthening [[North Governorate|North Lebanese]] industry in general. He then founded several import–export companies with his partners to encourage trade and transit operations, which inevitably led him to become more closely involved in the [[maritime transport]] sector. He became a ship owner and founded the Maritime Boutros S. El-Khoury Agency in the 1960s.

Khoury also invested in numerous other areas, founding or co-founding over 50 companies both in [[Lebanon]] and abroad. Sectors to which he contributed included [[aluminum]] and [[pressed wood]] production, the [[petroleum industry]], the drinks industry (notably [[juices]] and [[sparkling water]]), the [[hospitality industry]] (hotels), the [[insurance]] sector, and the land and [[real estate]] industry.

===Banking===

[[File:L'Association des Industriels avec le President Suleiman Franjieh.jpg|thumb|right|The Association of Lebanese Industrialists with [[Lebanese President]] [[Suleiman Frangieh]].]]
Khoury's involvement in the Lebanese [[banking]] sector contributed to the emergence of the “Golden Age” in the domestic banking industry in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Saffiedine |first1=Hicham |title=Economic Sovereignty and the Fetters of Finance: The Making of Lebanon’s Central Bank |date=June 2015 |publisher=University of Toronto |location=Toronto |url=https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/77732}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became one of the main figures of the Lebanese banking sector, alongside people like Pierre Edde, [[Hussein Al Oweini]] and Philippe Takla. In addition to his role in the BCAIF, which played a leading role in the economic affairs of the country, he also participated in the establishment of many banking institutions, including the project "Bank Al-Ahli Al-Mahjar", which never took shape but whose purpose was to link the capitals of the diaspora to those of the motherland. Following the same principle, the [[BLOM Bank]] (Banque du Liban et d’Outre-Mer) was created a year later in 1951. The Sheikh was one of its founders, also serving as its vice-president. BLOM Bank remains one of the leading banks in [[Lebanon]]. He was also one of the founders of Al-Madina Bank, established in 1982. He was a shareholder in the Bank of Industry and Labor and invested momentarily funds in Al-Mahjar Bank and Bank of the Mediterranean (Banque de la Méditerranée) in the 1980s.

The success of BLOM attracted Arab and foreign capital to the institution. In May 1960, Khoury secured a 5 million [[USD]] loan for the BCAIF, largely through his personal negotiations with Hart Perry, director of the American Bank Institution known as the Credit Fund. Also through the BCAIF, he led similar negotiations on behalf of the Lebanese government to obtain a US wheat loan in 1964, efforts which resulted in the agreement of a $17 million deal in July 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=[[L'Orient-Le Jour|Le Jour]] |date=19 July 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sheikh also maintained relations with leading personalities in the international banking community, including [[David Rockefeller]], adviser to the [[World Bank]].

In his capacity as chairman of the BCAIF's board of directors, Khoury also worked closely with the Lebanese government in efforts to alleviate problems in the banking sector. In 1964, he chaired the banking consortium that regulated the resolution of the “Land Bank” crisis. He was also involved in the 1966 project to establish a Development Bank, for the financing of industrial and tourism projects. Additionally, he was a key figure in the resolution of the “Intra-banking crisis” of 1968, during which Lebanon's [[central bank]], the [[Banque du Liban]] (BDL), asked the BCAIF to handle the management and liquidation of 10 banks in distress.

===Contribution to social dialogue===

[[File:Boutros Khoury Conferance de presse de l'Association des Industriels.jpg|thumb|right|Boutros el-Khoury at the press conference of the Association of Lebanese Industrialists.]]
Khoury's role in the Lebanese business world gave him a decisive voice in the dialogue that emerged between [[trade union]]ists and managers in the second half of the 1960s. As a representative of the [[industrialists]], he was commonly invited by the ruling class to participate in the settlement of social crises. While usually chosen to represent the employers in these discussions, Khoury often adopted a conciliatory position, reflecting his role as a mediator in both politics and business.

On the question of wage increases in the private sector, demanded by unions as early as November 1964, Khoury welcomed the adoption in January 1965 of the wage increase law, which in his opinion guaranteed continued cooperation between employers and workers, as well as increasing living standards.

Khoury was also committed to improving worker productivity, providing funds for [[vocational training]] and collaborating with the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs on the modernization of the [[Dekwaneh]] accelerated vocational training center.

Khoury's conciliatory tendencies did not outweigh his [[economic liberalism]], however, and while he was sensitive to worker well-being, he believed that the state should also work in the interests of employers in order to improve the whole economic sector. He remained a proponent of [[free trade]], which also led him to defend the interests of [[industrialists]] and [[capitalists]]. During the fruit crisis of June 1966, he condemned the measures of the Union of Farmers—defended by [[Kamal Jumblatt]] and the leftist parties—as an attempt to [[nationalization|nationalize]] the fruit industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=[[L'Orient-Le Jour|Le Jour]] |date=12 June 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political activity==

[[File:Camille Chamoun Boutros Khoury.jpg|gauche|thumb|left|El-Khoury with [[Lebanese President]] [[Camille Chamoun]].]]

Khoury's social skills and talents as a mediator also served him well in his political career. He established himself at an early age as an influential figure in his home village of [[Karmsaddeh|Karm Sadde]], and received as a consequence the honorary title of "[[Sheikh]]". He was therefore elected mayor of the village at a very young age.

Khoury's reputation, in [[North Governorate|North Lebanon]] and across the country, grew as a result of his business successes and growing leadership skills, along with his participation in the [[Independence of Lebanon|Lebanese independence]] movement led by [[Bechara El Khoury]] against the [[French Mandate of Lebanon|French Mandate]]. He rapidly became established as an important political leader in [[Zgharta District|Zghorta]], and was elected [[Member of Parliament|member]] of the [[Lebanese Parliament]] from 1943 to 1947. He showed little interest in a purely political career, however, retiring from parliament and instead adopting a role as an advisor and mediator in political circles.

[[File:Boutros el-Khoury public photo.jpg|left|thumb|Sheikh Boutros el-Khoury was known as "the man and friend of all regimes.".]]
Khoury built strong ties with Lebanon's most prominent post-independence political figures, including [[Camille Chamoun]], [[Fouad Chehab]], [[Rashid Karami]], [[Charles Helou]], [[Suleiman Frangieh]] and [[Elias Sarkis]]. He often acted as an intermediary and conciliator between different factions, holding frequent social events to this end at either his residence or [[St. Georges Hotel, Beirut|St. George's Hotel]] in [[Beirut]]. His prominence and influence in political circles earned him the title of “the man and friend of all regimes.”

Khoury's political connections also afforded him various business advantages, thanks in large part to the government contracts he was able to obtain. In 1964, in close cooperation with [[Lebanese President]] [[Fouad Chehab]], he negotiated with the [[United States]] a 25 million [[USD]] wheat loan. Contracts such as this gave Khoury the opportunity to play a decisive role in the country's political economy.

===The 1974 crisis and civil war===

[[File:Sheikh Boutros el-Khoury - Front Libanais.jpg|right|thumb|Boutros el-Khoury attends a [[Lebanese Front]] meeting.]]
Khoury's authority and influence within both the economic and the political establishment was particularly evident during the social crisis of 1974 and the subsequent [[Lebanese civil war]].

The social unrest that shook the country in the early 1970s was driven in part by the activities of the General Confederation of Lebanese Workers (Confédération Générale des Travailleurs Libanais, CGTL). The CGTL protested against the deterioration of living conditions, and in June 1974 presented the government with a list of demands, which included the amendment of Article 50 of the Labor Code, authorizing [[Unfair dismissal|arbitrary dismissal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Liban: géographie, économie, histoire et politique |date=October 2015 |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Universalis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the president of the Association of Industrialists resigned on July 11, 1974 to signify his total rejection of trade union demands, and refused any negotiation, a move that prolonged the crisis considerably.

Khoury's position during this conflict was in line with that of the rest of the Lebanese business world, traditionally committed to private initiative and individual and contractual freedom, which were endorsed by the constitution. His commitment to the [[Lebanese Front]] during the civil war was thus consistent with his pre-1975 stance: he financed the purchase of weapons used by the [[Al-Tanzim]] militia and Camille Chamoun's [[National Liberal Party (Lebanon)|National Liberal Party]], which were fighting the Islamist-progressive militas calling for reforms in the economic and political spheres.

==Charity Work==

[[File:Boutros el-Khoury in Europe.jpg|thumb|right|Sheikh Boutros el-Khoury abroad wearing a hat instead of his favorite [[Fez|tarboush]].]]
Khoury was also renowned for his [[philanthropy|philanthropic]] activities and generous donations to [[charity (practice)|charity]]. He was always committed to help in times of [[humanitarian crisis]] or [[natural hazards]] and used his influence for fundraising purposes: during the [[flood]]s of [[North Governorate|North Lebanon]] on December 22, 1955, he participated in the committee of dignitaries organizing the relief efforts in [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]]. Similarly, he was one of the first to donate money during the [[earthquake]] of March 16, 1956, which affected the [[Chouf]] and [[South Lebanon]] regions, and formed a committee to organize fundraising among industrialists. In March 1960, he donated to the Red Cross for the benefit of the victims of the [[1960 Agadir earthquake|Agadir earthquake]]. In 1974, he became a member of the National Committee for Victims of [[Cyprus]].

==Personal life==
Khoury married Najibe Abboud, a relative of his mentor Abbas, on September 19, 1926. The couple had seven children.

==Death and legacy==
[[File:Statue Boutros Khoury.jpg|thumb|left|Commemorative statue of Boutros el-Khoury in [[Karmsaddeh|Karm Sadde]].]]
[[File:Caricature Boutros Khoury.jpg|thumb|right|Caricature by Pierre Sadek published in [[An-Nahar]].]]
Khoury died in 1984 in [[Beirut]] at the age of 77.

Khoury has since become established in Lebanese collective memory as the quintessential [[self-made man]], due to his rural origins and his impressive social ascent during his work in [[Tripoli, Lebanon]] and [[Beirut]]. His legacy has been examined in various books, both fiction and non-fiction. Similarly, a commemorative statue was erected in his home village of [[Karmsaddeh|Karm Sadde]] to honor him.

Khoury was also known for wearing the [[Fez|tarboush]], which became his trademark, both in the newspapers and in the political cartoons made of him by the famous Lebanese cartoonist Pierre Sadek. He was also known for his great sense of humor.

'''Clive Ian Calder''' (born 13 December 1946) is a South African-born British [[billionaire]] record executive and businessman primarily known for co-founding the [[Zomba Group of Companies|Zomba Group]] with [[Ralph Simon]], and its subsidiary [[Jive Records]].

==Early life==
Calder was born in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa, and grew up there, off [[Louis Botha Avenue]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.izwi.com/emigretalent/onfolio-files/Clive%20Calder.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415160551/http://www.izwi.com/emigretalent/onfolio-files/Clive%20Calder.htm |date=15 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Career==
Calder started his first record company in 1971 in South Africa.  By 1975 they had relocated to London and had begun [[Zomba Group of Companies|Zomba]] as an artist and producer management company.  By 1978 Zomba had expanded to include publishing, and opened offices in New York City.  In 1981 they formed their first record label [[Jive Records|Jive]] and Calder began to create a name for Jive as an important outlet for hip hop and rap. 

Jive's success was followed by [[Silvertone Records (1980)|Silvertone Records]] in 1988 and countless others throughout the nineties.  After an unspecified "ethical disagreement," Calder bought Simon's stake in Zomba and became the sole owner in 1990. In the late nineties, Jive expanded its success to include teen pop phenomenons such as [[Backstreet Boys]], [[*NSYNC]] and [[Britney Spears]], all of which topped the charts. In 2002 he sold [[Zomba Group of Companies|Zomba]] for US$2.74 billion to the German-based media group [[Bertelsmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Zomba-Records-Ltd-Company-History.html|title=History of Zomba Records Ltd. – FundingUniverse|work=fundinguniverse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though he was offered a position within the [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]], he instead chose to stay on temporarily as an advisor during the integration period, but left the business in 2003. The Zomba Label Group, which had been founded by BMG as parent for all Zomba labels in 2004, was integrated with all its labels into [[RCA/Jive Label Group|BMG Label Group]] in 2007, while at the same time the Zomba brand ceased to exist. In 2009 the group was renamed as RCA/Jive Label Group under [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music]], in October 2011 [[Jive Records]], as well as the whole Jive brand, was discontinued, with their most artists being moved to [[RCA Records]] and partly to [[Epic Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/record-labels/rca-s-peter-edge-tom-corson-on-the-shuttering-1005394732.story|title=RCA's Peter Edge, Tom Corson on the Shuttering of Jive, J and Arista|work=Billboard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Calder is married, with two children, and lives in the [[Cayman Islands]].&lt;ref name="Forbes" /&gt;

The '''''College National Fed Challenge''''' competition is an academic competition similar to the [[National Fed Challenge]] high school competition.  The College Fed Challenge is a yearly team competition for undergraduate college students inspired by the working of the [[Federal Open Market Committee]]. The competition is intended to encourage students to learn more about the U.S. macro economy, the [[Federal Reserve System]] and the implementation of monetary policy. The College Fed Challenge also aims at promoting interest in economics and finance as subjects for advanced study and as the basis for a career.&lt;ref name="ramapo"&gt;“Ramapo College of New Jersey EEA:Fed Challenge 2010 Competition,” Ramapo.edu, 8 November 2010, [http://www.ramapo.edu/eea/challenge/index.html.]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==

'''College Fed Challenge Mission'''

	- The College Federal Reserve Challenge of the Federal Reserve System is a yearly academic competition sponsored by several reserve banks and is administered by the Eastern Economic Association. The College Federal Reserve Challenge consists of teams of three to five students from nearby colleges and universities.  Each team is responsible for creating a presentation 20 minutes in length to be delivered in front of a panel of judges consisting of academics and professional economists.  Concluding the presentation, a 15-minute question and answer session ensues between the collegiate group and the panel. By advancing through three rounds of local competition, successful teams win recognition, with the first place team continuing to [[Washington, D.C.]] to compete against other regional winners at the Board of Governors.&lt;ref name="ramapo"/&gt;
In addition to the educational benefits and confidence arising through rigorous competition, students benefit from opportunities to apply their economic experiences in the real world.  These skills learned can be applied to acquire internships, discover potential career paths, and hone skills of public speaking, logical thinking, writing, and analysis. Instructors of undergraduate institutions benefit through the use of a venue to develop enthusiasm for the study of economics and to integrate their curriculum with an active learning experience.&lt;ref name="ramapo"/&gt;

'''Goals'''
	
* To develop an understanding of the components of a modern economy and their long-term contribution to economic growth and development, while appreciating the short-run fluctuations which lead to business cycle activity.
* To comprehend the role of the Federal Reserve System in creating monetary policy designed to promote economic stabilization in furtherance of achieving the dual mandate of price level stability and maximum employment while assuring moderate long-term interest rates and financial system stability.
* To understand the short-run and long-run interactions of monetary policy with regard to unemployment, inflation, economic growth, fiscal policy, and exchange rate stability.
* To promote an understanding of current political and economic issues which impact on overall economic and financial system activity.
* To increase students' awareness and understanding of the unique role of the Federal Reserve in the economy.
* To develop students' research, cooperation, presentation, and critical thinking skills.&lt;ref name="ramapo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="handbook"&gt;“The College Fed Challenge Handbook,” The Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, 30 May 2007, {{cite web |url=http://www.richmondfed.org/education/for_teachers/academic_competitions/college_fed_challenge/participants_resources/pdf/handbook.pdf. |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609181213/http://www.richmondfed.org/education/for_teachers/academic_competitions/college_fed_challenge/participants_resources/pdf/handbook.pdf. |archivedate=2012-06-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==

	Teams of 3–5 students present current macroeconomic and financial information to a panel compiled of professional economists, bankers, financial analysts, and academics.  Each team is afforded 15 minutes to analyze and present various macroeconomic theories which if implemented, could lead to economic prosperity.  At the end of the 15-minute presentation the team must formulate a monetary plan for the Federal Reserve Bank to implement.  A 15-minute question and answer session involving the presenting team and the panel follows the 15-minute presentation.  Panel members quiz the students on current events, economic definitions, and macroeconomic policy during the 15-minute session.&lt;ref name="ramapo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="harvardfc"&gt;[http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~fed/college.html “Harvard College Fed Challenge,” hcs.harvard.edu, 8 November 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;
	Teams compete in two rounds at the regional competition which takes place at a nearby Federal Reserve Bank.  Winners of the regional competition advance to the final round in the national competition, held in Washington, DC.&lt;ref name="laf"&gt;“Lafayette, Reigning National Champion in College Fed Challenge, Will Host Regional Competition,” Lafayette.edu, 8 November 2010, [http://www.lafayette.edu/about/news/2010/10/13/college-fed-challenge/.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scoring==

	The panel of judges score each team after the 15-minute question and answer session.  A maximum of 50 points are awarded accordingly.  Judges use a scoring rubric which analyzes the team's “Knowledge of the Fed, current state of the economy, and monetary policy”, “Responses to Judges questions”, “Quality of the presentation”, “Research and analysis”, and “Teamwork and cooperation”.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt;

The '''Confederation of Danish Industry (DI)''' is one of Denmark's business organizations ([[chamber of commerce|chambers of commerce]]) and [[employers' organization]]s. DI's members are 10,000 private enterprises in [[manufacturing]] and the [[service industry]], from virtually all sub-sectors. Also, a number of sectoral employers' associations and branch federations are included in DI's framework, being integrated in part or in full in DI. Moreover, the members of DI in each county constitute a regional federation dealing with regional policy as well as educational issues. The organization represents its members in public discussions of new [[politics|political]] ideas, and it comments on current events in Denmark. The DI director general and CEO is Karsten Dybvad.

==History==
The first employer association in Denmark was established in 1885 by companies within the iron industry in Copenhagenas as Foreningen af Fabrikanter i Jernindustrien i København. A national organisation with the name Sammenslutningen af Arbejdsgivere inden for Jernindustrien i Danmark was established in 1902. In the 1980s, it changed its name to Jernets Arbejdsgiverforening. Other companies within the manufacturing industry were organized in Arbejdsgiverforeningen Industrifagene. These two employer associations merged on 1 January 1990 under the name Industriens Arbejdsgivere.

In 1992 Industriens Arbejdsgivere merged with Industrirådet under the name Dansk Industri. On 1 May 2008, Dansk Industri merged with  HTS Handel, Transport og Service under the name DI.

==Governance==
The confederation is financed and owned by its members and governed by a council and executive committee elected by the annual general assembly. DI's management oversees the daily activities of 600 [[employees]].

[[COWI A/S]]-CEO Lars-Peter Søbye siicceeded Lars Mikkelgaard-Jensen  as president of the executive committee in September 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://finans.dk/erhverv/ECE9902593/cowitopchef-bliver-ny-formand-for-di/?ctxref=forside|title=Cowi-topchef bliver ny formand for DIe|language=Danish|website=Jyllands-Posten|accessdate=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
The confederation's activities can be categorised as follows: &lt;br&gt;
• Policy advocacy - at local, national, and international level. &lt;br&gt; 
• Membership services - information, advisory services, and consulting. &lt;br&gt;  
• Network relations - between members and with society at large.

==Early years==
Lavrov was born in [[Moscow]], Russia. He studied at private school called Kommersant, spent a year in London and later moved to [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]].&lt;ref name="htc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Egor Lavrov |publisher=100thousandclub.com |year=2008 |url=http://www.100thousandclub.com/ru/article_en.asp?ref=274062 |accessdate=5 August 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080802205001/http://www.100thousandclub.com/ru/article_en.asp?ref=274062 |archivedate=2 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He finished school in Prague and came back to Moscow during a period of rising interest in the Internet in Russia. He later joined [[Plekhanov Russian Economic University|Plekhanov Institute of the National Economy]]&lt;ref name="htc"/&gt; and started his own business at the same time.

==Early political and business career==
Larov's first business was the first Internet-related magazine in Russia called ''Planeta Internet''.&lt;ref name="htc"/&gt; It was later sold to [[Smolensky Bank]] who paid about 2 million dollars to Lavrov when he was just 16 years old.&lt;ref name="htc"/&gt;

Lavrov's next step in business was the GFX Advertisement Company that later was acquired by the "Plaza Group" and transformed to "PLAZA Internet" that was a base for Internet projects of Egor Lavrov and Umar Dzhabrailov such as "obozrenie.ru" and "fuck.ru".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ru:Кто купит скандальное доменное имя? |publisher=clickz.ru |language=Russian |url=http://www.clickz.ru/cont/stat1.shtml?ac=v&amp;book=7&amp;page=2&amp;id=5 |accessdate=28 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050118150032/http://www.clickz.ru/cont/stat1.shtml?ac=v&amp;book=7&amp;page=2&amp;id=5 |archivedate=January 18, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Lavrov was 19 he became a head of the election campaign of [[Umar Dzhabrailov]] who ran for the [[President of Russia]].

Dzhabrailov came in last with 0.8 percent of the vote but became [[Chechnya]]'s representative in the [[Federation Council of Russia]].&lt;ref name="COE"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://assembly.coe.int/ASP/AssemblyList/ALMemberDetails.asp?MemberID=5410|authorlink=|title=Mr Umar DZHABRAILOV|publisher=Council of Europe|year=2008|accessdate=5 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''G.hn''' is a specification for [[home networking]] with data rates up to 2 Gbit/s and operation over four types of legacy wires: [[telephone wiring]], [[coaxial cable]]s, [[power line]]s and [[plastic optical fiber]]. A single G.hn semiconductor device is able to network over any of the supported home wire types. Some benefits of a multi-wire standard are lower equipment development costs and lower deployment costs for service providers (by allowing customer self-install).&lt;ref name="instatwebinar"/&gt;

==History==
'''G.hn''' was developed under the [[International Telecommunication Union]]'s Telecommunication Standardization sector (the [[ITU-T]]) and promoted by the HomeGrid Forum and several other organizations. ITU-T Recommendation (the ITU's term for standard) '''G.9960''', which received approval on October 9, 2009,&lt;ref name="ituapproval"&gt;[http://www.itu.int/newsroom/press_releases/2009/46.html New ITU standard opens doors for unified 'smart home' network], ITU Press Release&lt;/ref&gt; specified the [[physical layer]]s and the architecture of G.hn. The Data Link Layer (Recommendation G.9961) was approved on June 11, 2010.&lt;ref name="dllapproval"&gt;[http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/United-Nations-ITU-Ts-Ghn-Approved-as-Global-Standard-for-Wired-Home-Networking-1274797.htm United Nations ITU-T's G.hn Approved as Global Standard for Wired Home Networking]&lt;/ref&gt;

Key promoters CEPCA, HomePNA, and UPA, creators of two of these interfaces, united behind the latest version of the standard in February 2009.&lt;ref name="hgf-liaison"/&gt;

The ITU-T extended the technology with [[MIMO|multiple input, multiple output]] (MIMO) technology to increase data rates and signaling distance&lt;ref name="TOVIM14"&gt;{{cite book

This new feature was approved in March 2012 under [[G.9963]] Recommendation.

Amendments to the main [[G.9960]]/[[G.9961]] added new functionalities to the base standard:
* Neighbouring domains interference mitigation (distributed [[NDIM]])
* Power saving modes
* PSD management
* New transmission profiles
* Layer 2 configuration management protocol [[LCMP]]

==Technical specifications==

===Technical overview===
G.hn specifies a single [[physical layer]] based on [[fast Fourier transform]] (FFT) [[orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing]] (OFDM) modulation and [[low-density parity-check code]] (LDPC) [[forward error correction]] (FEC) code. G.hn includes the capability to notch specific frequency bands to avoid interference with [[amateur radio]] bands and other licensed radio services. G.hn includes mechanisms to avoid interference with legacy home networking technologies&lt;ref name="coexwp"&gt;[http://homegridforum.typepad.com/homegrid_forum/2009/04/new-whitepaper-on-coexistance.html HomeGrid Forum White-paper: G.hn Compatibility with Existing Home Networking Technologies], HomeGrid Forum Blog&lt;/ref&gt; and also with other wireline systems such as [[VDSL2]] or other types of [[DSL]] used to access the home.

OFDM systems split the transmitted signal into multiple [[orthogonal]] sub-carriers. In G.hn each one of the sub-carriers is modulated using [[QAM]]. The maximum QAM constellation supported by G.hn is 4096-QAM (12-bit QAM).

The G.hn [[Media Access Control]] is based on a [[time division multiple access]] (TDMA) architecture, in which a "domain master" schedules Transmission Opportunities (TXOPs) that can be used by one or more devices in the "domain". There are two types of TXOPs:
* Contention-Free Transmission Opportunities (CFTXOP), which have a fixed duration and are allocated to a specific pair of transmitter and receiver. CFTXOP are used for implementing TDMA Channel Access for specific applications that require [[quality of service]] (QoS) guarantees.
* Shared Transmission Opportunities (STXOP), which are shared among multiple devices in the network. STXOP are divided into Time Slots (TS). There are two types of TS:
** Contention-Free Time Slots (CFTS), which are used for implementing "implicit" [[token passing]] Channel Access. In G.hn, a series of consecutive CFTS is allocated to a number of devices. The allocation is performed by the "domain master" and broadcast to all nodes in the network. There are pre-defined rules that specify which device can transmit after another device has finished using the channel. As all devices know "who is next", there is no need to explicitly send a "token" between devices. The process of "passing the token" is implicit and ensures that there are no [[collision]]s during Channel access.
** Contention-Based Time Slots (CBTS), which are used for implementing [[CSMA/CARP]] Channel Access. In general, CSMA systems cannot completely avoid collisions, so CBTS are only useful for applications that do not have strict Quality of Service requirements.

====Optimization for each medium====
Although most elements of G.hn are common for all three media supported by the standard (power lines, phone lines and coaxial cable), G.hn includes media-specific optimizations for each media. Some of these media-specific parameters include:&lt;ref name=ghnwebinar&gt;[http://www.homegridforum.org/resource_library/rl_requests?document_id=f00f2ab4c8d967a2786750d72f90fade73130c2b&amp;document_title=G.hn+Technology+Overview+-+NEW HomeGrid Forum - G.hn Technology Overview], (registration required)&lt;/ref&gt;
* OFDM Carrier Spacing: 195.31&amp;nbsp;kHz in coaxial, 48.82&amp;nbsp;kHz in phone lines, 24.41&amp;nbsp;kHz in power lines.
* FEC Rates: G.hn's FEC can operate with [[code rate]]s 1/2, 2/3, 5/6, 16/18 and 20/21. Although these rates are not media specific, it is expected that the higher code rates will be used in cleaner media (such as coaxial) while the lower code rates will be used in noisy environments such as power lines.
* [[Automatic repeat request]] (ARQ) mechanisms: G.hn supports operation both with and without ARQ (re-transmission). Although this is not media specific, it is expected that ARQ-less operation is sometimes appropriate for cleaner media (such as coaxial) while ARQ operation is appropriate for noisy environments such as power lines.
* Power levels and frequency bands: G.hn defines different power masks for each media.
* MIMO support: Recommendation [[G.9963]] includes provisions for transmitting G.hn signals over multiple AC wires (phase, neutral, ground), if they are physically available.&lt;ref name="TOVIM14"/&gt;

====Security====
G.hn uses the [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] (AES) encryption algorithm (with a 128-bit key length) using the [[CCMP (cryptography)|CCMP]] protocol to ensure [[confidentiality]] and message integrity. [[Authentication]] and [[key exchange]] is done following [[ITU-T]] Recommendation [[X.1035]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.ds2.es/ds2blog/2009/05/top-ten-things-about-ghn-standard.html Top Ten Things You Need to Know About the New G.hn Standard]&lt;/ref&gt;

G.hn specifies [[Network topology#Point-to-point|point-to-point]] security inside a domain, which means that each pair of transmitter and receiver uses a unique encryption key which is not shared by other devices in the same domain. For example, if node [[Placeholder names in cryptography|Alice]] sends data to node [[Placeholder names in cryptography|Bob]], node [[Placeholder names in cryptography|Eve]] (in the same domain as Alice and Bob) will not be able to easily eavesdrop their communication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.ds2.es/ds2blog/2009/09/introduction-ghn-security.html An introduction to G.hn security]&lt;/ref&gt;

G.hn supports the concept of relays, in which one device can receive a message from one node and deliver it to another node farther away in the same domain. Relaying provides for utilizability of multiple transport media and complex network topologies. While a relay can read the source and target addresses, it cannot read the message's content due to its body being end-to-end-encrypted.

====Profiles====

The G.hn architecture includes the concept of profiles. Profiles are intended to address G.hn nodes with significantly different levels of complexity. In G.hn the higher complexity profiles are [[proper superset]]s of lower complexity profiles, so that devices based on different profiles can interoperate with each other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://q4sg15.itu.ch/ties/Mtgs09/2009-05-Geneva/09GS-U12R2.doc Updated Issues List for G.hn - Geneva May 2009], (ITU membership required)&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of G.hn devices based on high complexity profiles are Residential Gateways or Set-Top Boxes. Examples of G.hn devices based on low complexity profiles are home automation, home security and Smart Grid devices.

=== Spectrum ===
The G.hn spectrum depends on the medium as shown in the diagram below:
[[File:Spectrum-v1.0.png|alt=G.hn spectral usage|none|frame]]

===Protocol stack===
[[Image:G.hn protocol stack.001.png|thumb|border|right|300px|upright|G.hn protocol stack]]
G.hn specifies the physical layer and the [[Data Link Layer]], according to the [[OSI model]].&lt;ref name="ghnwebinar" /&gt;

*The G.hn [[Data Link Layer]] (Recommendation G.9961) is divided into three sub-layers:
** The Application Protocol Convergence (APC) Layer, which accepts frames (usually in [[Ethernet]] format) from the upper layer (Application Entity) and encapsulates them into G.hn APC [[protocol data unit]]s (APDUs). The maximum payload of each APDU is 2&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; bytes.
** The [[Logical Link Control]] (LLC), which is responsible for [[encryption]], [[Packet aggregation|aggregation]], [[Packet segmentation|segmentation]] and [[Automatic repeat-request]]. This sub-layer is also responsible for "relaying" of APDUs between nodes that may not be able to communicate through a direct connection.
** The [[Medium Access Control]] (MAC), which schedules Channel Access.
*The G.hn physical layer (Recommendation G.9960) is divided into three sub-layers:
** The Physical Coding Sub-layer (PCS), responsible for generating [[PHY]] [[Header (computing)|headers]].
** The Physical Medium Attachment (PMA), responsible for [[Scrambler|scrambling]] and [[forward error correction]] coding/decoding.
** The Physical Medium Dependent (PMD), responsible for bit-loading and [[OFDM]] [[modulation]].

The PMD sub-layer is the only sub-layer in the G.hn stack that is "medium dependent" (i.e., some parameters may have different values for each media -  power lines, phone lines and coaxial cable). The rest of sub-layers (APC, LLC, MAC, PCS and PMA) are "medium independent".

The interface between the Application Entity and the Data Link Layer is called A-interface. The interface between the Data Link Layer and the physical layer is called Medium Independent Interface (MII). The interface between the physical layer and the actual transmission medium is called Medium Dependent Interface (MDI).

==Status==
Recommendation G.9960 was granted approval at the October 2009 Study Group 15 plenary meeting.&lt;ref name="approval"&gt;[http://www.homegridforum.org/news_events/pr/10_09_09/ UNITED NATIONS ITU-T RATIFIES G.HN STANDARD FOR WIRED HOME NETWORKING]&lt;/ref&gt;

Recommendation G.9961 received approval on June 11, 2010.&lt;ref name="dllapproval" /&gt;  During that meeting, concerns about regulatory conformance were raised and an amendment to the G.hn standard was proposed that eliminated the passband (100&amp;nbsp;MHz to 200&amp;nbsp;MHz) and reduced the baseband operational spectrum (from 100&amp;nbsp;MHz to 80&amp;nbsp;MHz).  Other changes included in the amendment included a reduction of transmit power to meet regulatory complaints raised at the meeting. In June 2011, during a joint Forum held by ITU-T, [[ITU-R]] and other organizations, it was recognized that "ITU-T G.hn was considered to have electromagnetic compatibility (EMC)  and mitigation techniques that go well beyond those considered essential for protecting radio services", and that "Non-ITU compliant home network equipment may cause problems".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/net/pressoffice/press_releases/2011/18.aspx Forum highlights radio interference fears]&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010, Sigma Designs announced the first G.hn-compliant chipset, called CG5110.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sigmadesigns.com/uploads/library/press_releases/101025.pdf Sigma Designs Unveils Industry’s First G.hn Chipset]&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2011, Lantiq introduced a family of G.hn-compliant chips, called HNX176 and HNX156.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lantiq.com/news/press/161-ghn-standard-for-home-networking-applications/ Lantiq Introduces Family of Chips Supporting Global ITU-T G.hn Standard for Home Networking Applications]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, four silicon vendors (Lantiq, Marvell Semiconductor, Metanoia and Sigma Designs) announced their participation in an open interoperability plugfest in Geneva, hosted by HomeGrid Forum, Broadband Forum and ITU.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homegridforum.org/content/pages.php?pg=news_press_releases_item&amp;rec_id=102 G.hn Moves from Specification to Reality]&lt;/ref&gt;

The HomeGrid Forum showcased the world’s first live public demonstration of G.hn interoperability at CES, January 10–13, 2012. HomeGrid Forum members Lantiq, Marvell, Metanoia, and Sigma Designs joined together to highlight real-world G.hn capabilities.&lt;ref name="homegridforum.org"&gt;http://www.homegridforum.org/content/pages.php?pg=news_press_releases_item&amp;rec_id=161&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, Tangotec Ltd. announced that it will have a fully compliant ITU-T G.hn chipset family available in 2012. Tangotec demonstrated G.hn capabilities over all three media at CES 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20120103005223/en/Tangotec-Announces-ITU-T-G.hn-chipset&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, Marvell and HomeGrid Forum announced that Marvell's G.hn silicon had passed all compliance tests and was now the first compliance certified G.hn silicon. To be first certified G.hn silicon only interop testing remains.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bizjournals.com/sacramento/prnewswire/press_releases/California/2012/12/05/AQ24408&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marketwatch.com/story/homegrid-forum-announces-first-ghn-silicon-certification-2012-12-05&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analysts===

In 2008, several marketing firms promoted G.hn and made optimistic predictions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abiresearch.com/press/1150-New+G.hn+Home+Networking+Standard+Has+Significant+Potential New G.hn Home Networking Standard Has Significant Potential], ABI Research&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="itupr"&gt;[http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/newslog/New+Global+Standard+For+Fully+Networked+Home.aspx New global standard for fully networked home]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=coppergatepr&gt;[http://www.copper-gate.com/news_events/press_releases/?release=46 CopperGate Communications Commits to G.hn]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other organizations===

On February 25, 2009, three home networking organizations that promoted previously incompatible technologies ([[CEPCA]], [[HomePNA]] and the [[Universal Powerline Association]]), announced they agreed to work with Homegrid Forum to promote G.hn as the single next-generation standard for wired home networking, and to work to ensure coexistence with existing products in the market.&lt;ref name="hgf-liaison"/&gt;

On October 2008, the [[Continental Automated Buildings Association]] (CABA) and HomeGrid Forum signed a liaison agreement to support HomeGrid Forum’s efforts in conjunction with ITU-T G.hn to make it easy for consumers to connect devices and enjoy innovative applications using existing home wiring.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homegridforum.org/news_events/pr/10_27_08/ HomeGrid Forum and CABA Ink Liaison Agreement to Promote Development and Deployment of Advanced Intelligent Home Networks]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Related standards===
[[Image:Ghnta.png|thumb|border|right|200px|upright|Relationship between G.hnta and G.hn]]
[[ITU G.9970]] (also known as G.hnta) is a Recommendation developed by ITU-T that describes the generic architecture for home networks and their interfaces to the operators' broadband access networks.

[[ITU G.9972]] (also known as G.cx) is a Recommendation developed by ITU-T that specifies a coexistence mechanism for home networking transceivers capable of operating over power line wiring. The coexistence mechanism would allow G.hn devices which implement G.9972 to coexist with other devices implementing G.9972 and operating on the same power line wiring.

==Applications==

The major motivation for wired home networking technologies was [[IPTV]], especially when offered by a service provider as part of a [[triple play (telecommunications)|triple play service]], voice and data service offering such as [[AT&amp;T]]'s [[U-Verse]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://homegridforum.typepad.com/homegrid_forum/2009/03/multiple-home-networking-organizations-working-with-homegrid-forum-to-promote-ghn-technology.html Multiple industries converging around the G.hn standard], HomeGrid Forum Blog&lt;/ref&gt; [[Smart Grid]] applications like [[home automation]] or [[demand side management]] can also be targeted by G.hn-compliant devices that implement low-complexity profiles.&lt;ref name="BERGU12"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Berger, Lars T.|author2=Iniewski, Krzysztof|date=April 2012|title=Smart Grid - Applicacions, Communications and Security|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|id=712376|pages=1–16|isbn=978-1-1180-0439-5|url=http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118004396.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== IPTV ===

In many customers' homes the [[residential gateway]] that provides [[Internet access]] is not located close to the IPTV [[set-top box]]. This scenario becomes very common as service providers start to offer service packages with multiple set-top boxes per subscriber.

G.hn can connect the residential gateway to one or more set-top boxes, by using the existing home wiring. Using G.hn, IPTV service providers do not need to install new [[Ethernet]] wires, or [[802.11]] wireless networks. Because G.hn supports any kind of home wiring, end users might install the IPTV home network by themselves, thus reducing the cost to the service provider.&lt;ref name="whyunified"&gt;[http://homegridforum.typepad.com/homegrid_forum/2008/10/why-do-we-need-a-unified-standard-at-all-1.html "Why do we need a unified standard at all?"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622050023/http://homegridforum.typepad.com/homegrid_forum/2008/10/why-do-we-need-a-unified-standard-at-all-1.html |date=June 22, 2009 }}, HomeGrid Forum Blog&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Home networks ===

Although [[Wi-Fi]] technology is popular for consumer home networks, G.hn is also intended for use in this application. G.hn is an adequate solution for consumers in situations in which using wireless is not needed (for example, to connect a stationary device like a TV or a [[network-attached storage]] device), or is not desired (due to [[Wireless security|security]] concerns) or is not feasible (for example, due to limited range of wireless signals).

=== Consumer electronics ===

[[Consumer electronics]] (CE) products can support Internet connectivity using technologies such as Wi-Fi, [[Bluetooth]] or [[Ethernet]]. Many products not traditionally associated with computer use (such as TVs or [[Hi-Fi]] equipment) provide options to connect to the Internet or to a computer using a [[home network]] to provide access to digital content.

G.hn is intended to provide high-speed connectivity to CE products capable of displaying [[high definition television]].

Integrating the power connection and the data connection provides potential energy savings in CE devices. Given that CE devices (such as [[Home cinema|home theater]] receivers) very often run on standby or "[[vampire power]]", they represent major savings to homeowners if their power connection is also their data connection - the device could reliably be turned off when it is not displaying any source.

===Smart grid===

&lt;!-- This is an attempt to summarize a lot of the text on energy management contributed by 142.177.114.210 on May 16th 2009 --&gt;

Because G.hn can operate over wires including [[AC power|AC]] and [[Direct current|DC]] power lines, it can provide the communication infrastructure required for [[smart grid]] applications. A comprehensive smart grid system requires reaching into every AC outlet in a home or building so that all devices can participate in energy conserving strategies.

On September 2009, the US [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] included G.hn as one of its standards for the smart grid "for which it believed there
was strong stakeholder consensus", as part of an early draft of the "NIST Framework and Roadmap for Smart Grid Interoperability Standards".&lt;ref name="nist"&gt;[https://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/releases/smartgrid_092409.html Commerce Secretary Unveils Plan for Smart Grid Interoperability]&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2010 G.hn was removed from the final version of the "Standards Identified for Implementation".&lt;ref name="newNist"&gt;[http://hanfan2.blogspot.com/2010/01/nist-smart-grid-interoperability.html NIST Smart Grid Interoperability Standards Roadmap]&lt;/ref&gt;

The broad concept of a smart grid includes applications with overlapping scopes such as [[demand side management]], [[energy conservation]] measures, [[Advanced Metering Infrastructure]] (AMI) and home networks.&lt;ref name="BERGU12"/&gt;

Because G.hn supports popular protocols like [[IPv4]] and [[IPv6]], G.hn-based networks can easily be integrated with IP-based networks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.ds2.es/ds2blog/2009/05/why-smart-grid-must-use-ip-standards.html Why the Smart Grid must be based on IP standards]&lt;/ref&gt; Well-known network management protocols like the [[Simple Network Management Protocol]] (SNMP) can manage IP networks including G.hn devices.

'''AHK Thailand''' or the '''German-Thai Chamber of Commerce (GTCC)''' is a non-profit entity which promotes bilateral economic relations between [[Germany]] and [[Thailand]]. It is a member of the German Chambers of Commerce Worldwide Network ([[Auslandshandelskammer|AHK]]s), with 130 locations in 90 countries around the world.

[[File:Information file GTCC.pdf|thumb|Information file GTCC]]

== History ==
In 1959 German businesses in Thailand founded a "German Business Group". Such a business group proved to be too small for the occasion and therefore, soon led to the creation of bilateral Chamber of Commerce.&lt;ref name=Years&gt;German-Thai Chamber of Commerce (2008): 150 Years German-Thai Economic Relations.&lt;/ref&gt;

The German-Thai Chamber of Commerce (GTCC) was officially founded by 57 German and Thai business representatives on 19 July 1962. The inauguration ceremony took place at the Erawan Hotel, [[Bangkok]].&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch-Thailändische Handelskammer(1998): 140 Jahre Deutsch-Thailändische Wirtschaftsbeziehungen 1858-1998.Bangkok:DarnsuthaPress Co.,Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1965, the GTCC had grown to 100 member companies, and to around 300 during the following 20 years.&lt;ref name=Years/&gt; Since 2017, total membership has been more than 600, making it one of the largest foreign chambers of commerce in Thailand.

== Board of Directors and management ==
[http://thailand.ahk.de/en/about-us/honorary-board/ The Board of Directors] includes fourteen figures in Bangkok's business community, Thai, German and other nationals. Ensuring that the services offered by the Chamber are efficient, comprehensive and up-to-date, the board sets the broad lines of Chamber policy. [http://thailand.ahk.de/en/about-us/honorary-board/ The current president of the German-Thai Chamber of Commerce] is Mr. Markus Lorenzini. Since July 2015, the Chamber is managed by the Executive Director Dr. Roland Wein and Deputy Executive Director, Marius Mehner.&lt;ref name=Handbook&gt;GTCC Handbook &amp; Directory 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6189">{{nihongo|'''Hideshi Hamaguchi''' |濱口 秀司|Hamaguchi Hideshi}} is a Japanese [[concept]] creator and [[strategist]] in the business field. Hamaguchi is also called a business designer or an innovation designer.

He is considered a leading mind in creative concept development, strategy-building and decision management in the United States and Japan.
 
A self-proclaimed "creative visual thinker" and "diagram-lover", Hamaguchi uses visual models to bring what he calls "[[simplexity]]" and "structured chaos" to the process of brainstorming, helping businesses generate creative ideas and strategies in various industries &amp; businesses.

==Education==
Hamaguchi holds a B.S. in Chemical Engineering from [[Kyoto University]], [[Kyoto]], [[Japan]]

==Professional==
Hamaguchi is acknowledged for the [[BET theory]] of TiO2 ([[titanium dioxide]],) an energy production photocatalyst called the Honda-Fujishima effect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6TFN-3YCN376-8H&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=9962f1e45ebe45b9817d39023cf88d57 Titanium(IV) oxide photocatalyst of ultra-high activity&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamaguchi started his business career with [[Panasonic Corporation]] (former [[Matsushita Electric Works]], Ltd.) in Japan. In 1993, he became one of their first corporate [[decision analysts]], supporting board members and executives with strategic decision making. In 1994, he created the concept of the [[Intranet]] and developed Japan's first corporate [[Intranet]] with [[Toru Takasuka]].

From 1998 to 2001, he served as a strategist at Ziba Design, Inc. in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]] and led award winning projects, including IDEA ([[International Design Excellence Awards]]) gold awarded projects.

While at Ziba, he created the concept of the world's first [[USB flash drive]]. IBM first marketed the drives in North America in 2000, with its product the "DiskOnKey" (manufactured by the Israeli company [[M-Systems]]). In 2002, he helped the start-up of MDRM, an Israeli company developing technology for [[digital rights management]] through [[flash memory]] cards. ([[SanDisk]] acquired MDRM in December 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://investor.sandisk.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=86495&amp;p=irol-newsArticle_Print&amp;ID=658477&amp;highlight= SanDisk Acquires MDRM]&lt;/ref&gt;)

In 2001, Hamaguchi returned to [[Panasonic Electric Works]], Ltd. During his time there he was Director of the New Business Planning Group in Japan and Executive Vice President of Panasonic Electric Works Laboratory of America, Inc. in the U.S.A.

In 2006 he founded [[LUNARR]] Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portlandonfire.com/hideshihamaguchi/ Hideshi Hamaguchi | Portland On Fire&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; with his business partner [[Toru Takasuka]] in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], Oregon, U.S.A.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/portland/stories/2007/10/01/smallb1.html Tracking progress - Portland Business Journal:&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He was COO of [[LUNARR]], Inc.

In 2009 he returned to Ziba Design as Director of Strategy.

In 2012 he became a juror of the [[Red Dot]] Design Award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.red-dot.org/jury2012.html?cHash=878d60c4069b7a8e85cb667839e26bb7&amp;detail=4671]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.red-dot.org/4806.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamaguchi has developed his own theory and methodology (Model Based Approach) for creative concept and strategy building through his experiences in various industries, businesses and technologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.picmet.org/newsletter/tmn.asp?news_ID=314&amp;NL_code=18 Portland International Engineering and Technology Management Center&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka''' (''CA Sri Lanka'') is a [[professional accountancy body]] in  [[Sri Lanka]].  The Institute was established by Act of Parliament, No. 23 of 1959 as the sole organisation in Sri Lanka with the right to awarding the [[Chartered Accountant]] designation. The Institute is responsible for setting [[Accounting and Auditing Standards]] in Sri Lanka, and is considered the ''National Body of Accountants' in the country.{{fact|date=August 2018}}

==Membership==
In Sri Lanka, only members of CA Sri Lanka can practice as "Chartered Accountant". There are two grades of members;
* Associate (ACA)
* Fellow (FCA)

Associate membership is gained after completing three levels of examinations and serving as a clerk serving under articles with a member of the Institute in practice or with a member of the Institute who is a salaried employee in the service of a firm of accountants for a minimum three-year practical training period. They are known as [[articled clerk]]s during this period.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.casrilanka.com/casl/images/pdf/members/parliament_act.pdf Act of Incorporation And Regulations Of The Institute Of Chartered Accountants Of Sri Lanka]&lt;/ref&gt; Fellowship is awarded to senior Chartered accountants.

Chartered accountants holding practicing certificates may also become "Registered [[Auditor]]s", who are able to perform statutory [[financial audit]]s in accordance with the ''Companies Act, No. 07 of 2007''. Chartered Accountants can also register as [[Company Secretaries]].

==Affiliations==
The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka enjoys agreements with the [[ICAEW|Institute of Chartered Accountants of England and Wales]], [[CPA Australia]], and several other leading international accountancy bodies.

CA Sri Lanka is a member of the [[International Federation of Accountants]], [[Confederation of Asian and Pacific Accountants]]  and a founder member of the [[South Asian Federation of Accountants]]. CA Sri Lanka is also a member of the Chartered Accountants Worldside

==Criticisms==
CA Sri Lanka has been criticized for allowing audit firms to take undue advantage of articled clerks who would have to work in these firms for low wages to cover the practical training period required by the institute, which intern is headed by partners of these firms.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/ca-sri-lanka-audit-firms-their-slaves/ CA Sri Lanka, Audit Firms &amp; Their Slaves]&lt;/ref&gt;

During Webb's time as CIFA President, it was reported that British players were being offered up to £70k to represent Cayman Islands at international football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Caymans launch World Cup trawl|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/feb/29/newsstory.sport4|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=24 March 2016|date=29 February 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was wrongly thought that anyone with a British passport was eligible for the Cayman Islands national team. In March 2000, FIFA intervened and prevented several English players playing for the Cayman Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=BILL MARWICK|author2=ANGUS WRIGHT|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-18729577.html|title=FIFA's darkness falls on Brannan's island in the sun.|work=The Scotsman|publisher=ECM Publishers, Inc. 2000.|accessdate=March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===CONCACAF===
Webb was unanimously elected to lead the Confederation of North, Central America and the Caribbean Football Association (CONCACAF) on May 23, 2012, in Budapest, Hungary. He became the fourth President in the Confederation’s history, and the youngest leader of any regional association within FIFA to reach this position.{{cn|date=June 2015}}

As President of CONCACAF, Webb also became FIFA Vice President and an official member of the governing body’s Executive Committee. Moreover, on March 2013 Webb was appointed by FIFA President [[Joseph Blatter]] as Chairman of the FIFA anti-discrimination task force, which will oversee all matters related to discrimination within global football.

At the time of his appointment, in 2012, Webb was President of the Cayman Islands Football Association (CIFA).

Webb appointed a new Miami-based General Secretary, [[Enrique Sanz de Santamaría]], enabling the CONCACAF head office to relocate to [[Miami]].&lt;ref name="concacaf-2012-7-13"&gt;{{cite web|title=CONCACAF appoints Enrique Sanz as General Secretary |url=http://www.concacaf.com/page/ConfederationDetail/0,,12813~2848973,00.html |publisher=CONCACAF.com |accessdate=14 July 2012 |date=13 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120720005131/http://www.concacaf.com/page/ConfederationDetail/0%2C%2C12813~2848973%2C00.html |archivedate=20 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corruption==
{{Main|2015 FIFA corruption case}}
In September 2014 Webb was one of several FIFA officials to call for the publication of the [[Garcia Report]] into allegations of corruption surrounding Russia and Qatar's bids for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018]] and [[2022 FIFA World Cup]]s.&lt;ref name=GuardSep14&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/sep/24/michael-garcia-fifa-investigation-public-world-cup|title=Fifa prosecutor Michael Garcia calls for World Cup report to be made public|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=September 24, 2014|accessdate=September 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{wikinews|FIFA ethics committee recommends lifetime ban of former FIFA vice-president}}
On 27 May 2015, Webb was arrested for corruption charges. The indictment, which named fourteen other individuals related to FIFA, included racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy. In addition to senior soccer officials, the indictment also named sports-marketing executives from the United States and South America who are accused of paying more than $150 million in bribes and kickbacks in exchange for media deals associated with major soccer tournaments. Other soccer officials charged are [[Eduardo Li]], [[Eugenio Figueredo]], [[Jack_Warner_(football_executive)|Jack Warner]], [[Julio Rocha Lopez]], [[Costas Takkas]], [[Rafael Esquivel]] and [[Nicolás Leoz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/28/sports/soccer/fifa-officials-arrested-on-corruption-charges-blatter-isnt-among-them.html |title= FIFA Inquiry Yields Indictments; U.S. Officials Vow to Pursue More |first1= Matt |last1= Apuzzo |first2= Stephanie |last2= Clifford |first3= William K. |last3= Rashbaummay |date= 27 May 2015 |accessdate= 27 May 2015 |work= The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charges were also made against the sports-marketing executives [[Alejandro Burzaco]], [[Aaron Davidson]], [[Hugo Jinkis]] and Mariano Jinkis. Authorities also charged José Margulies as an intermediary who facilitated illegal payments.&lt;ref name="FIFA Inquiry Yields Indictments" /&gt; In November 2015 Webb pleaded guilty and agreed to forfeit more than US$6.7 million.

Following his a suspension, he was replaced by [[Alfredo Hawit]] at CONCACAF and Bruce Blake at CIFA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hawit becomes CONCACAF acting president after Webb charged|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/28/hawit-becomes-concacaf-acting-president-after-webb/|publisher=Washington Times|accessdate=7 June 2015|date=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caymanfootball.com/cifa-statement/ |title=CIFA Statement |publisher=Cayman Islands Football Association |date=3 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150604071754/http://caymanfootball.com/cifa-statement/ |archivedate= 4 June 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Following a few years as usability consultant in the late 90’s and a few years at the [[Swedish National Police Board]] as Product Manager,&lt;ref name="calvinayre"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://calvinayre.com/2012/07/24/poker/jonas-odman-bodog-recreational-poker-model/ |title=Jonas Odman and the Bodog Recreational Poker Model &amp;#124; Poker News |publisher=CalvinAyre.com |date=2012-07-24 |accessdate=2014-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ödman joined Ongame in 2004 as Product Manager for Ongame Network, Ongame’s B2B arm. Ödman worked during the sales process of Ongame to Austrian publicly traded company [[Bwin.Party Digital Entertainment|Bwin]] (then Betandwin).

Following the sale of Ongame in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globeinvestor.com/servlet/ArticleNews/story/PRNEWS/20051216/UKF008 |title=Betandwin.Com to Acquire Ongame e-Solutions AB |publisher=Globeinvestor.com |date=2006-02-04 |accessdate=2014-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ödman was one of the founders of [[Gnuf.com]], a [[Malta]]-based poker and casino website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prleap.com/pr/88834/ |title=Gnuf.Com Launches Microgaming Powered Casino |publisher=Prleap.com |date=2007-08-09 |accessdate=2014-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2009 Ödman joined Bodog Network as Vice President&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUs7d3mD-PI&amp;feature=related |title=Jonas Odman part 1/2 &amp;#124; QuadJacks Poker Radio Friday January 20, 2012 |publisher=YouTube |date=2012-01-21 |accessdate=2014-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and made a presentation at the EiG conference in Copenhagen titled “The Ultimate Solution to Rakeback Problems”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egrmagazine.com/news/solution_to_rakeback_issue_in_online_poker_is_available_says_bodog_network_ |title=Bodog's Solution to the Rakeback Problem - Latest News in Online Poker |publisher=Egrmagazine.com |date=2009-09-25 |accessdate=2014-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first step of what would later be known as the Bodog Recreational Poker Model.&lt;ref name="calvinayre" /&gt; Two years later, in November 2011, Bodog Network launched a new software with a new feature: Anonymous Tables for all tables, including tournaments.&lt;ref name="pocketfives"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cardplayer.com/poker-news/12409-bodog-introduces-new-anonymous-poker-tables |title=CardPlayer, Bodog Introduces New Anonymous Poker Tables |publisher=CardPlayer.com |date=2011-11-30 |accessdate=2014-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was another controversial step initiated by Ödman and created a storm of angry reactions in the poker forums&lt;ref name="pocketfives" /&gt; but has with time proven to be very successful. In June 2012 Ödman took over as President of Bodog Network.

In June 2013 Ödman left Bodog Network&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jones |first=Nick |url=http://pokerfuse.com/news/industry/bodog-president-steps-down-wants-to-try-recreational-poker-model-in-the-us-26-06/ |title=Bodog President Steps Down, Wants to Try Recreational Poker Model in the US &amp;#124; Pokerfuse Online Poker News |publisher=Pokerfuse.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and started to work on a new venture in California.

==Personal life==
Ödman started playing cards at a very young age and played junior elite bridge in Sweden in the late 80’s. Ödman won his first poker tournament in Las Vegas in July 2006, a $7,200 first prize at the [[The Mirage|Mirage Casino]]. He also played in [[WSOP Main Event]] that year but did not cash.

==Business career==
In 1971, he worked for the Israel Discount Bank – which was founded by his grandfather, [[Leon Yehuda Recanati]]. In 1979, he was appointed deputy CEO with responsibility for all branches and marketing. He largely escaped the scandal of the [[1983 Israel bank stock crisis]].&lt;ref name="ha081012"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lipson|first1=Nathan|title=The Losses of Leon Recanati|url=https://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/business/the-losses-of-leon-recanati-1.259224|accessdate=24 December 2017|publisher=Haaretz|date=October 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1986, he transferred to IDB Holding, the investment side of the family business where he rotated through various chairmanships at [[Shufersal|Supersol]], [[Delek]] and Clal, and later served as co-CEO and co-chairman of IDB Holding.&lt;ref name=JewishVirtualLibrary /&gt;

In May 2003, the family sold IDB Holding to [[Nochi Dankner]]&lt;ref name=HaaretzLosses&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/business/the-losses-of-leon-recanati-1.259224 Haaretz: "The losses of Leon Recanati - He had it all: money, prestige - but the scion of the banking family wanted more" By Nathan Lipson] December 10, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and divided its assets. With his share, Recanati established Glenrock, an investment company,  which he ran with his wife Shula Recanati and Ziv Kop.&lt;ref name=HaaretzLosses /&gt; It has three divisions: ''GlenRock America'' assists Israeli businesses in entering the American market and also serves as a conduit for American investors to invest in Israel (headed by Larry Graev); ''GlenRock Israel'' invests in local technology companies; and ''GlenRock Italy'' advises Israeli businesses in penetrating the Italian market and serves as a bridge for Italian investors interested in investing in Israel (headed by Rony Benatof).&lt;ref name=JewishVirtualLibrary /&gt;

In 2007, he purchased a 50.4% stake (73% total with two minority partners) in the Gmul Investment Company for NIS 600 million more than twice its market capitalization. Gmul had stakes in real estate, hotels, investments, and automotive. It was founded in 1950 by Bank Hapoalim, the Histadrut labor federation and several pension funds then sold to the brothers Jules and Eddy Trump, who listed it on the [[Tel Aviv Stock Exchange]], and then sold in October 2003 to Eyal Yona and Amnon Barzilay.&lt;ref name=HaaretzLosses /&gt; Performance at Gmul deteriorated. Recanati stated: "At this point I can say that buying control of Gmul was the worst deal I have ever made...

In [[economics]] and in particular [[neoclassical economics]], the '''marginal product''' or '''marginal physical productivity''' of an input ([[factor of production]]) is the change in output resulting from employing one more unit of a particular input (for instance, the change in output when a firm's labor is increased from five to six units), assuming that the quantities of other inputs are kept constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title =The Making of the Classical Theory of Economic Growth|last=Brewer

 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=jBR4jmf75gYC&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;dq=Edward%20West%20diminishing&amp;pg=PA163#v=onepage&amp;q=Edward%20West%20diminishing&amp;f=false
 |year=2010
 |publisher =Routledge
 |isbn=0415486203
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The marginal product of a given input can be expressed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
as:
:&lt;math&gt;MP =  \frac{\Delta Y}{\Delta X}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Delta X&lt;/math&gt; is the change in the firm's use of the input (conventionally a one-unit change) and &lt;math&gt;\Delta Y&lt;/math&gt; is the change in quantity of output produced (resulting from the change in the input). Note that the quantity &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; of the "product" is typically defined ignoring [[externalities|external costs and benefits]].

If the output and the input are infinitely divisible, so the marginal "units" are infinitesimal, the marginal product is the mathematical [[derivative]] of the [[production function]] with respect to that input. Suppose a firm's output ''Y'' is given by the production function:
:&lt;math&gt;Y=F(K,L)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''K'' and ''L'' are inputs to production (say, capital and labor). Then the marginal product of capital (''MPK'') and marginal product of labor (''MPL'') are given by:

:&lt;math&gt;MPK=\frac{\partial F}{\partial K}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;MPL=\frac{\partial F}{\partial L}&lt;/math&gt;

In the "law" of [[diminishing returns|diminishing marginal returns]], the marginal product initially increases when more of an input (say labor) is employed, keeping the other input (say capital) constant. Here, labor is the variable input and capital is the fixed input (in a hypothetical two-inputs model). As more and more of variable input (labor) is employed, marginal product starts to fall. Finally, after a certain point, the marginal product becomes negative, implying that the additional unit of labor has ''decreased'' the output, rather than increasing it. The reason behind this is the diminishing [[marginal productivity of labor]].

The marginal product of labor is the slope of the [[total product]] curve, which is the production function plotted against labor usage for a fixed level of usage of the capital input.

In the neoclassical theory of [[perfect competition|competitive markets]], the [[marginal product of labor]] equals the [[real vs. nominal in economics|real]] wage. In aggregate models of perfect competition, in which a single good is produced and that good is used both in consumption and as a capital good,  the [[marginal product of capital]] equals its [[rate of profit|rate of return]]. As was shown in the [[Cambridge capital controversy]], this proposition about the marginal product of capital cannot generally be sustained in multi-commodity models in which capital and consumption goods are distinguished.

'''Relationship of marginal product (MPP) with the total product (TPP)'''

The relationship can be explained in three phases-
(1) Initially, as the quantity of variable input is increased, TPP rises at an increasing rate. In this phase, MPP also rises.
(2) As more and more quantities of the variable inputs are employed, TPP increases at a diminishing rate. In this phase, MPP starts to fall.
(3) When the TPP reaches its maximum, MPP is zero. Beyond this point, TPP starts to fall and MPP becomes negative.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2143">The '''Master of Science in Project Management (M.S.P.M.)''', also known as '''Master in Project Management (M.P.M.)''' is a professional advanced [[academic degree|degree]] in [[project management]].

Candidates of M.P.M. programs are required to have at least a [[Bachelor's degree]] from an accredited [[university]] and significant work experience (12 years on average). Most programs require 36-42 graduate credits and a [[thesis]] or final project. While programs may vary, most curricula are designed to provide professionals with the knowledge, skills and abilities to lead and manage effectively. Students normally engage in the study of concepts, methodologies and analytic techniques necessary for successful leadership of programs/projects within complex organizations. Curricula typically focus on problem solving and decision-making using case studies, teaming exercises, hands-on applications, active participation, research and integrative exercises. Lecture and laboratory sessions require the application of critical thinking to problem solving within notional and actual situations.

These Master programs usually provide general education revolving around business organization. Such degree is not only for future project managers but also offers opportunities in consultancy, business analysis, business development, operations management, supply chain management, business administration, or any other area of business or management.

Vargas is named after the husband of his mother (and his legal father), Octavio Vargas. He has two paternal half-siblings.

Vargas studied at the Colegio San Juan Bosco, where he get graduated of [[bachiller]] in [[physics]] y [[mathematics]]. Later, he graduated as a civil engineer at the [[Universidad de Puerto Rico|Mayagüez Campus]] of the University of Puerto Rico.

After graduation began his professional life as a supervising engineer in the engineering department and buildings of the [[CODETEL|Compañía Dominicana de Teléfonos]] (CODETEL), circa 1974. Years later, he built Planinco, his first company.

Vargas received a substantial inheritance when his biological father, who was serving as senator for La Vega Province, died in a car accident in 1994.

He is married with María de los Ángeles García Frangie, and he has three children: Alberto Manuel (b. 1986), Alan Omar (b. 1987), and Miguel Paúl (b. 1981).

Miguel Vargas Maldonado began his political career in the mid-1970s, the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD), which has fought for nearly forty years. In the party leadership he has held the roles of Vice President, member of the Presidium, a member of the National Executive Committee (CEN) and the Political Commission and National Secretary of Finance.

Between 1982 and 1984, in the government of Salvador Jorge Blanco (PRD 1982–1986), he was director general of the "Water Supply and Sewerage Corporation of Santo Domingo CAASD". In the government of Hipolito Mejia (2000–2004), it was "Secretary of State for Public Works and Communications".

He was appointed as Chancellor of the Dominican Republic President Danilo Medina by 16 August 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elcaribe.com.do/2016/08/16/danilo-designa-miguel-vargas-como-ministro-relaciones-exteriores Danilo designa a Miguel Vargas como ministro de Relaciones Exteriores]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Primary Dominican Revolutionary Party (2007) ==
On 28 January 2007, Vargas Maldonado beat his opponent Milagros Ortiz Bosch, with about 80% of the votes, thus becoming the official candidate of the PRD to the Presidency of the Republic for the elections of 16 May 2008.

== Campaign proposals as a presidential candidate election 2008 ==
Vargas Maldonado said that, if elected president in 2008, would cut taxes in order to boost the economy. Grant 50% of charges of public administration to women, and increase spending on social investment. His election campaign was based on his proposals to deal with pressing problems of the Dominican people as unemployment, crime, homelessness and high tax rates, as well as criticism of the government administration of President Leonel Fernandez Reyna (2004–2008 ).
== Election Results 2008 ==
In the elections of 16 May 2008, voting for the PRD candidate with Vargas as obtained rose 33% in 2004 to 41% in 2008. However, he won by the PLD candidate and candidate for reelection, Dr. Leonel Fernandez, with over 53% of the vote.
== PRD President ==
On Sunday 7 June 2009 Miguel Vargas was elected by the Political Commission of the PRD as party president. The election was decided by 244 votes in favor. Perredeísta membership of that body at that time was 312 people.
== Election Results 2010 ==
Chaired by Miguel Vargas, the PRD attended the congressional and municipal elections on 16 May 2010. Although the result in terms of votes absolutes improved from the last election, no seat was achieved in the Senate . However, enrollment of deputies and mayors increased, which was considered a breakthrough by the PRD.
== PRD Convention 2011 ==
On 6 March 2011 was held a convention where Vargas competed against former president of the Dominican Republic Hipolito Mejia, the official candidacy for president. In a closed dispute, the convention Mejia won with 53.30% against a 46.70%. The loser pre-candidate Vargas, claimed that some records in his favor were not counted, and other members of opposing parties, as the PLD and PRSC, could vote at this convention not having been excluded from the list of voters.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In his sworn statement of assets 2011 to run for the presidential candidate for the PRD declared a heritage of more than 100 million pesos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.listin.com.do/la-republica/2011/2/15/177542/Precandidatos-de-PRD-declaran-patrimonio-de-RD152-millones  Precandidatos del PRD declaran patrimonio]&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2014 was the subject of controversy when it was discovered that received a loan from the [[Banco de Reservas]] on 13 December 2011 for $15&amp;nbsp;million, well above the equity amount Vargas said owning earlier this year, although the offered guarantees were previously rejected by the management of the Bank Valuations.&lt;ref name=prestamo&gt;{{cite web|title=Revelan Miguel Vargas recibió préstamo privilegiado de RD$585 MM del Banreservas|url=http://www.diariolibre.com/noticias/2014/01/14/i438121_revelan-miguel-vargas-recibi-prstamo-privilegiado-rd585-del-banreservas.html|accessdate=10 April 2014|date=14 January 2014|publisher=Diario Libre|location=Santo Domingo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of his party insinuated that the loan, which was approved in eleven days, would be related to Vargas Maldonado's refusal to participate in favor of the party's presidential candidate [[Hipólito Mejía]] in the election campaign 2012.&lt;ref name=prestamo/&gt;

He is currently president of the PRD. He is also president of the "Socialist International for Latin America and the Caribbean" and, since 2013, vice president of the [[International Socialist]] worldwide.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4538">{{Expand Serbian|Никола Спасић|date=April 2015}} [[File:Bista Nikole Spasića.JPG|thumb|Bust of Nikola Spasić in Belgrade.]]
'''Nikola Spasić''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Никола Спасић}}, [[Belgrade]], 2 November 1838 – [[Corfu]], 28 November 1916) was a [[Serbia]]n businessman, [[Benefactor (law)|benefactor]], [[humanitarian]], and one of the leaders of the [[Serbian Chetnik Organization]] in [[Old Serbia]] and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]. He was the president of the Board of Directors of the Belgrade Exchange in 1903 and the initiator-founder-builder of the [[Nikola Spasić Endowment Building in Belgrade]]. He also initiated and financed the construction of four major edifices in [[Knez Mihailova Street]], the third of which, built immediately proceeding the First Balkan War, was the Grand Passage, designed by Nikola Nestorović

==Biography==
Nikola Spasić was the descendant of a Serbian family, which, "desperately poor", moved to Belgrade from the countryside during the 1804-1813 [[First Serbian Uprising]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Spasić trained for 15 years as an artisan and merchant before opening, with his brother, the first leather workshop and store in 1865. The shop manufactured and vended ''opanci'' ([[Opanak]]), Balkan peasant footwear similar to the [[moccasin]]; this light, leather footwear was widely accepted as part of the Serbian national costume and was worn in the 19th century both in the city and the village. By the time of the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] acquired full independence in 1878, Nikola Spasić was sufficiently rich to completely withdraw from business. The value of the property that the Endowment of Nikola Spasić had at its disposal following his death was close to that of the [[Nobel Foundation]].
 
Throughout his career, Spasić maintained a consistent professional attitude: he ran his business in the same way over the years and had an unwavering relation to his clients, which was reflected in his persistent, frugal, diligent self-control and modesty. This, coupled with his humanitarian work, would be how he would be remembered in the city of Belgrade. At the same time, for the architectural design of his buildings, Spasić always selected the best Serbian architects, his buildings featured the latest technical devices, the construction material of the highest quality, with the entire building inventory procured from European centres. 

Nikola Spasić's will and last testament, drawn up in 1912, expressly forbade the sale of any of his Belgrade buildings. Rather, it called for their exploitation in order to raise funds and therefore finance all the undertakings of the Endowment of Nikola Spasić. The main goal of the endowment set by Spasić was the economic development of the nation.
 
For Nikola Spasić, the capable entrepreneur, the promise of architecture was a dream he pursued to the end. Just a few days before his death on the island of Corfu, where he arrived as a war refugee, Spasić revealed in a letter, his hope that he would return one day to liberated Belgrade, accompanied by Viennese architect [[Konstantin Jovanović]], who he planned to engage to design new remarkable edifices.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17847">'''Organizational Intelligence''' (OI) is the capability of an organization to comprehend and conclude knowledge relevant to its business purpose. In other words, it is the intellectual capacity of the entire organization.  With relevant organizational intelligence comes great potential value for companies and therefore organizations find study where their strengths and weaknesses lie in responding to change and complexity. Organizational Intelligence embraces both [[knowledge management]] and [[organizational learning]], as it is the application of [[knowledge management]] concepts to a business environment, additionally including learning mechanisms, comprehension models and business value network models, such as the [[balanced scorecard]] concept. Organizational Intelligence consists of the ability to make sense of complex situations and act effectively, to interpret and act upon relevant events and signals in the environment. It also includes the ability to develop, share and use knowledge relevant to its business purpose as well as the ability to reflect and learn from experience

While organizations in the past have been viewed as compilations of tasks, products, employees, profit centers and processes, today they are seen as intelligent systems that are designed to manage knowledge. Scholars have shown that organizations engage in learning processes using tacit forms of intuitive knowledge, hard data stored in computer networks and information gleaned from the environment, all of which are used to make sensible decisions. Because this complex process involves large numbers of people interacting with diverse information systems, organizational intelligence is more than the aggregate intelligence of organizational members; it is the intelligence of the organization itself as a larger system.

==Organizational Intelligence vs Operational Intelligence==
Organizational Intelligence and [[operational intelligence]] are usually seen as subsets of [[business analytics]], since both are types of know-how that have the goal of improving business performance across the enterprise.  Operational Intelligence is often linked to or compared with [[real-time business intelligence]] (BI) since both deliver visibility and insight into business operations.  Operational Intelligence differs from BI in being primarily activity-centric, whereas BI is primarily data-centric and relies on a database (or [[Hadoop]] cluster) as well as after-the-fact and report-based approaches to identifying patterns in data.  By definition, Operational Intelligence works in real-time and transforms unstructured data streams—from log file, sensor, network and service data—into real-time, actionable intelligence.
  
While Operational Intelligence is activity-focused and BI is data-focused, Organizational Intelligence differs from these other approaches in being workforce- or organization-focused.  Organizational Intelligence helps companies understand the relationships that drive their business—by identifying communities as well as employee workflow and collaborative communications patterns across geographies, divisions, and internal and external organizations.

==Information Process==
There are many aspects that organizations must consider in the three steps that they take to gain information. Without these considerations, organizations may experience strategic challenges.

===Acquiring Information===
First of all, organizations must acquire applicable information to make beneficial predictions. An organization must ask what they already know and need to know. They must also know the timeframe in which the information is needed and where and to find it. To make the best judgements, they must also evaluate the value of the information. Seemingly valuable information that costs more to find than gain from can hurt the company. If judged valuable, the organization must find the most efficient means of acquiring it.&lt;ref&gt;Frappaolo, Carl. Knowledge Management: A Primer. England: Capstone, 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Processing Information===
After acquiring the right information, an organization must know how to properly process it. They need to know how they can make new information more retrievable and how they can make sure that the information gets disseminated to the right people. The organization must figure out how to secure it and how long and if long, how they need to preserve it.&lt;ref&gt;Frappaolo, Carl. Knowledge Management: A Primer. England: Capstone, 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Utilization of Information===
The last step includes the utilization of the information. An organization should ask themselves if they are looking at the right information and if so, if they are placing them in the right context. They must consider the possible environmental changes alter the informational value and determine all the relevant connections and patterns. Not forgetting to know if they are including the right people in the decision making process and if there are any technology that can improve the decision making.&lt;ref&gt;Frappaolo, Carl. Knowledge Management: A Primer. England: Capstone, 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizational Ignorance==

There are briefly four dimensions of problems that many organizations face when dealing with information. This is also referred to as organizational ignorance.

===Uncertainty===

An organization may be uncertain when it does not possess enough or the right information. To exemplify, a company may be uncertain in a competitive landscape because it does not have enough information to see how the competitors will act. This does not imply that the context of the situation is complex or unclear. Uncertainty can even exist when the range of possibilities is small and simple. There are different degrees of uncertainty. First of all an organization can be completely determined (complete certainty), have some probabilities (risk), probabilities estimated with lesser confidence (subjective uncertainty), unknown probabilities (traditional uncertainty) or undefined (complete uncertainty). However even with the lack of clarity, uncertainty assumes that the context of the problem is clear and well understood.

===Complexity===

An organization may be processing more information than they can manage. Complexity doesn’t always correlate with vagueness or unpredictability. Rather, it occurs when there are too much or when the scope is too large to process. Organizations with complexity problems have interrelated variables, solutions and methods. Managing these problems is dependent of the individuals and the organizations. For instance, uninformed and novices must deal with each elements and relationships one by one but experts can perceive the situation better and find familiar patterns more easily. Organizations facing complexity must have the capacity to locate, map, collect, share, exploit on what the organizations need to know.

===Ambiguity===

An organization may not have a conceptual framework for interpreting the information. If uncertainty represents not having answers, and complexity represents difficulty in finding them, ambiguity represents not being able to formulate the right questions. Ambiguity cannot be resolved by increasing the amount of information. An organization must be able to interpret and explain the information in collective agreement. Hypotheses should be continuously made and discussed and key communication activities such as face-to-face conversations must be made. Resolving ambiguity in the earlier stages than competitors gives organizations much advantage because it helps organizations to make more appropriate and strategic decisions and have better awareness.

===Equivocality===

An organization may be having competing frameworks for interpreting a job. Equivocality refers to multiple interpretations of the field. Each interpretation is unambiguous but differ from each other and they may be mutually exclusive or in conflict. Equivocality result not only because everyone’s experiences and values are unique but also from unreliable or conflicting preferences and goals, different interests or vague roles and responsibilities.

==Information Organization and culture==

A culture of the organization describes how the organization will work in order to succeed. It can simply be described as the organization’s atmosphere or values. Organizational culture is important because it can be used as a successful leadership tool to shape and improve the organization. Once the culture is settled, it can be used by the leader to deliver his/her vision to the organization. Moreover, if the leader deeply understands the organizational culture, he/she can also use it to predict a future outcome in certain situations.

===Control===
An organization with control culture is company oriented and reality oriented. They will succeed by controlling and keeping restrictions. The organization will value timeliness of information, security and hierarchical standardization. They make plans and maintain a process. This organization has stability, predictability and authority. For example, an organization with control culture can be monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Gary J. Managerial Dilemmas: Political Leadership in Hierarchies. S.l.: [s.n.]. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competence===
An organization with competence culture is company oriented and possibility oriented. They will succeed by being the best with exclusivity of the information. The organization values efficiency, accuracy and achievement. They look for creativity and expertise from the people in the organization. For example, an organization with competence culture can be...&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Gary J. Managerial Dilemmas: Political Leadership in Hierarchies. S.l.: [s.n.]. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultivation===
An organization with cultivation culture is people oriented and possibility oriented. They will succeed by growing people, who fulfill the shared vision. The organization values self-actualization and brilliance. They also prioritizes the idea from people. For example, an organization with cultivation culture can be technological utopianism. 

=== Collaboration ===
An organization with collaboration culture is people oriented and reality oriented. They will succeed by working together. The organization values affiliation and teamwork. They also prioritizes people in the organization. This organization has accessibility and inclusiveness of information. For example, an organization with collaboration culture can be anarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Gary J. Managerial Dilemmas: Political Leadership in Hierarchies. S.l.: [s.n.]. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organizational Intelligence and Innovation ===
An organization’s leadership effectiveness is closely related to the organization’s intelligence and innovation. There are six leadership factors that determines organization’ atmosphere :  flexibility (how freely people can communicate with each other and innovate), responsibility (sense of loyalty to the organization), the standards set by people in the organization,  appropriate feedback and rewards, the clear vision shared by people and the amount of commitment to the goal. Combination of these factors result in six different leadership styles: Coercive/Commanding, Authoritative/Visionary, Affiliative, Democratic, Coaching and Pacesetting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stevenson|first1=Herb|title=Leadership Style, Emotional Intelligence, and Organizational Effectiveness|url=http://www.clevelandconsultinggroup.com/articles/leadership-style-emotional-intelligence-organizational-effectiveness.php#_ftn1|website=www.clevelandconsultinggroup.com|accessdate=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, organizational intelligence is a collection of individual intelligence. The leadership style of the organization and its atmosphere are related to the organization's innovation. Innovation happens when there are new information getting shared and processed efficiently in the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Glynn|first1=Mary Ann|title=Innovative Genius: A Framework for Relating Individual and Organizational Intelligences to Innovation|journal=The Academy of Management Review|date=Oct 1996|volume=21|pages=1081–1111|doi=10.5465/amr.1996.9704071864|jstor=259165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==

===Round Table===
In King Arthur's Round Table, Harvard professor David Perkins uses the metaphor of the Round Table to discuss how collaborative conversations create smarter organizations. The Round Table is one of the most familiar stories of Arthurian legend since it’s meant to signal the shift in power from a king who normally sat at the head of a long table and made long pronouncements while everyone else listened. By reducing hierarchy and making collaboration easier, Arthur discovered an important source of power—organizational intelligence—that allowed him to unite medieval England.

===Lawnmower Paradox===
The lawnmower paradox, another metaphor from Perkins’ book, describes the fact that, while pooling physical effort is easy, pooling mental effort is hard. "It’s a lot easier for 10 people to collaborate on mowing a large lawn than for 10 people to collaborate on designing a lawnmower." An organization’s intelligence is reflected by the types of conversations—face-to-face and electronic, from the mailroom to the boardroom—which members have with one another.  "At the top, top level, organizational intelligence depends on ways of interacting with one another that show good knowledge processing and positive symbolic conduct."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

[[Image:Pert chart colored.svg|thumb|309px|PERT network chart for a seven-month project with five [[Milestone (project management)|milestones]] (10 through 50) and six activities (A through F).]]

The '''program '''(or '''project''') '''evaluation and review technique''' ('''PERT''') is a statistical tool used in [[project management]], which was designed to analyze and represent the [[task (project management)|tasks]] involved in completing a given [[project]]. 

First developed by the [[United States Navy]] in the 1950s, it is commonly used in conjunction with the [[critical path method]] (CPM).

== Overview ==
Project Evaluation and Review Techniques is commonly abbreviated to PERT.
PERT is a method of analyzing the tasks involved in completing a given project, especially the time needed to complete each task, and to identify the minimum time needed to complete the total project. It incorporates uncertainty by making it possible to schedule a project while not knowing precisely the details and [[Duration (project management)|durations]] of all the activities. It is more of an event-oriented technique rather than start- and completion-oriented, and is used more in projects where time is the major factor rather than cost. It is applied to very large-scale, one-time, complex, non-routine infrastructure and Research and Development projects.

Program Evaluation Review Technique (PERT) offers a management tool, which relies "on arrow and node diagrams of ''activities'' and ''events'': arrows represent the ''activities'' or work necessary to reach the ''events'' or nodes that indicate each completed phase of the total project."&lt;ref name="MB 1968"/&gt;

PERT and CPM are complementary tools, because "CPM employs one time estimate and one cost estimate for each activity; PERT may utilize three time estimates (optimistic, expected, and pessimistic) and no costs for each activity. Although these are distinct differences, the term PERT is applied increasingly to all critical path scheduling."&lt;ref name="MB 1968"/&gt;

==History==
"PERT" was developed primarily to simplify the planning and scheduling of large and complex projects. It was developed for the [[United States Navy Special Projects Office|U.S. Navy Special Projects Office]] in 1957 to support the U.S. Navy's Polaris nuclear submarine project.&lt;ref name="MRCW 1959"&gt;Malcolm, D. G., J. H. Roseboom, C. E. Clark, [[Willard Fazar|W. Fazar]]. "Application of a Technique for Research and Development Program Evaluation," ''OPERATIONS RESEARCH,'' Vol. 7, No. 5, September–October 1959, pp. 646–669&lt;/ref&gt; It found applications all over industry. An early example was it was used for the [[1968 Winter Olympics]] in [[Grenoble]] which applied PERT from 1965 until the opening of the 1968 Games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1968/or1968.pdf 1968 Winter Olympics official report.] p. 49. Accessed 1 November 2010. {{en icon}} &amp; {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; This project model was the first of its kind, a revival for [[scientific management]], founded by Frederick Taylor ([[Taylorism]]) and later refined by Henry Ford ([[Fordism]]). [[DuPont]]'s [[critical path method]] was invented at roughly the same time as PERT.

[[File:PERT Summary Report Phase 2, 1958.jpg|thumb|upright|''PERT Summary Report Phase 2'', 1958]]
Initially PERT stood for ''Program Evaluation Research Task,'' but by 1959 was already renamed.&lt;ref name="MRCW 1959"/&gt; It had been made public in 1958 in two publications of the U.S. Department of the Navy, entitled ''Program Evaluation Research Task, Summary Report, Phase 1.''&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Dept. of the Navy. ''[http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/735902.pdf Program Evaluation Research Task, Summary Report, Phase 1].'' Washington, D.C., Government Printing Office, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt;  and ''Phase 2.''&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Dept. of the Navy. ''[https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/100954569 Program Evaluation Research Task, Summary Report, Phase 2].'' Washington, D.C., Government Printing Office, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1959 article in  ''The American Statistician'' the main [[Willard Fazar]], Head of the Program Evaluation Branch, Special Projects Office, U.S. Navy, gave a detailed description of the main concepts of the PERT. He explained:

{{Quote|Through an electronic computer, the PERT technique processes data representing the major, finite accomplishments (events) essential to achieve end-objectives; the inter-dependence of those events; and [[Estimation (project management)|estimates]] of time and range of time necessary to complete each activity between two successive events. Such time expectations include estimates of "most likely time", "optimistic time", and "pessimistic time" for each activity. The technique is a management control tool that sizes up the outlook for meeting objectives on time; highlights danger signals requiring management decisions; reveals and defines both methodicalness and slack in the flow plan or the network of sequential activities that must be performed to meet objectives; compares current expectations with [[Schedule (project management)|scheduled]] completion dates and computes the probability for meeting scheduled dates; and simulates the effects of options for decision&amp;nbsp;— before decision.&lt;br /&gt;The concept of PERT was developed by an operations research team staffed with representatives from the Operations Research Department of [[Booz Allen Hamilton]]; the Evaluation Office of the [[Lockheed Martin Space Systems|Lockheed Missile Systems Division]]; and the Program Evaluation Branch, Special Projects Office, of the Department of the Navy.&lt;ref name="SDFJWM 1959"&gt;[[Willard Fazar]] cited in: B. Ralph Stauber, H. M. Douty, Willard Fazar, Richard H. Jordan, William Weinfeld and Allen D. Manvel. "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2682310 Federal Statistical Activities]." ''The American Statistician'' 13(2): 9-12 (Apr., 1959) , pp. 9-12&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:PERT Guide for management use, June 1963.jpg|thumb|upright|''PERT Guide for management use'', June 1963]]
Ten years after the introduction of PERT in 1958 the American [[librarian]] Maribeth Brennan published a selected [[bibliography]] with about 150 publications on PERT and CPM, which had been published between 1958 and 1968. The origin and development was summarized as follows:
{{Quote|PERT originated in 1958 with the... [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris missile]] design and construction scheduling. Since that time, it has been used extensively not only by the [[aerospace industry]] but also in many situations where management desires to achieve an objective or complete a task within a scheduled time and cost expenditure; it came into popularity when the algorithm for calculating a maximum value path was conceived. PERT and CPM may be calculated manually or with a computer, but usually they require major computer support for detailed projects. A number of colleges and universities now offer instructional courses in both.&lt;ref name="MB 1968"&gt;Brennan, Maribeth, ''PERT and CPM: a selected bibliography,''  Monticello, Ill., Council of Planning Librarians, 1968. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For the subdivision of work units in PERT&lt;ref&gt;Desmond L. Cook (1966), ''Program Evaluation and Review Technique.'' p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; another tool was developed: the [[Work Breakdown Structure]]. The Work Breakdown Structure provides "a framework for complete networking, the Work Breakdown Structure was formally introduced as the first item of analysis in carrying out basic PERT/COST."&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Bright Maynard]] (1967), ''Handbook of Business Administration.'' p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
=== Events and activities ===
In a PERT diagram, the main building block is the ''event'', with connections to its known predecessor events and successor events.
* ''PERT event'': a point that marks the start or completion of one or more activities. It consumes no time and uses no resources. When it marks the completion of one or more activities, it is not "reached" (does not occur) until ''all'' of the activities leading to that event have been completed.
* ''predecessor event'': an event that immediately precedes some other event without any other events intervening. An event can have multiple predecessor events and can be the predecessor of multiple events.
* ''successor event'': an event that immediately follows some other event without any other intervening events. An event can have multiple successor events and can be the successor of multiple events.

Besides events, PERT also knows activities and sub-activities:
* ''PERT activity'': the actual performance of a task which consumes time and requires resources (such as labor, materials, space, machinery). It can be understood as representing the time, effort, and resources required to move from one event to another. A PERT activity cannot be performed until the predecessor event has occurred.
* ''PERT sub-activity'': a PERT activity can be further decomposed into a set of sub-activities. For example, activity A1 can be decomposed into A1.1, A1.2 and A1.3. Sub-activities have all the properties of activities; in particular, a sub-activity has predecessor or successor events just like an activity. A sub-activity can be decomposed again into finer-grained sub-activities.

=== Time ===
PERT has defined four types of time required to accomplish an activity:
* ''optimistic time'': the minimum possible time required to accomplish an activity (o) or a path (O), assuming everything proceeds better than is normally expected
* ''pessimistic time'': the maximum possible time required to accomplish an activity (p) or a path (P), assuming everything goes wrong (but excluding major catastrophes).
* ''most likely time'': the best estimate of the time required to accomplish an activity (m) or a path (M), assuming everything proceeds as normal.
* ''expected time'': the best estimate of the time required to accomplish an activity (te) or a path (TE), accounting for the fact that things don't always proceed as normal (the implication being that the expected time is the average time the task would require if the task were repeated on a number of occasions over an extended period of time).
::: '''te''' =  ('''o''' + '''4m''' + '''p''') ÷ '''6'''
:::&lt;math&gt;TE = \sum_{i=1}^n te_i&lt;/math&gt;
* ''standard deviation of time'' : the variability of the time for accomplishing an activity (σ&lt;sub&gt;te&lt;/sub&gt;) or a path (σ&lt;sub&gt;TE&lt;/sub&gt;)
::: '''σ&lt;sub&gt;te&lt;/sub&gt;''' =  ('''p''' - '''o''') ÷ '''6'''
:::&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{TE} = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n {\sigma_{te_i}}^2}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Management tools ===
PERT supplies a number of tools for management with determination of concepts, such as:
* ''[[Float (project management)|float]] or [[Float (project management)|slack]]'' is a measure of the excess time and resources available to complete a task. It is the amount of time that a project task can be delayed without causing a delay in any subsequent tasks (''free float'') or the whole project (''total float''). Positive slack would indicate ''ahead of schedule''; negative slack would indicate ''behind schedule''; and zero slack would indicate ''on schedule''.
* ''[[critical path method|critical path]]'': the longest possible continuous pathway taken from the initial event to the terminal event. It determines the total calendar time required for the project; and, therefore, any time delays along the critical path will delay the reaching of the terminal event by at least the same amount.
* ''critical activity'': An activity that has total float equal to zero. An activity with zero float is not necessarily on the critical path since its path may not be the longest.
* ''[[wikt:lead#Verb_2|Lead]] time'': the time by which a ''predecessor event'' must be completed in order to allow sufficient time for the activities that must elapse before a specific PERT event reaches completion.
* ''lag time'': the earliest time by which a ''successor event'' can follow a specific PERT event.
* ''[[Critical path method|fast tracking]]'': performing more critical activities in parallel
* ''[[Critical path method|crashing critical path]]'': Shortening duration of critical activities

==Implementation==

The first step to scheduling the project is to determine the tasks that the project requires and the order in which they must be completed.  The order may be easy to record for some tasks e.g.When building a house, the land must be graded before the foundation can be laid) while difficult for others (there are two areas that need to be graded, but there are only enough bulldozers to do one).  Additionally, the time estimates usually reflect the normal, non-rushed time.  Many times, the time required to execute the task can be reduced for an additional cost or a reduction in the quality.

=== Example ===
In the following example there are seven tasks, labeled ''A'' through ''G''.  Some tasks can be done concurrently (''A'' and ''B'') while others cannot be done until their predecessor task is complete (''C'' cannot begin until ''A'' is complete).  Additionally, each task has three time estimates: the optimistic time estimate (''o''), the most likely or normal time estimate (''m''), and the pessimistic time estimate (''p'').  The expected time (''te'') is computed using the formula (''o'' + 4''m'' + ''p'') ÷ 6.

Once this step is complete, one can draw a [[Gantt chart]] or a network diagram.

Note (1) the [[critical path method|critical path]] is in red, (2) the [[Float (project management)|slack]] is the black lines connected to non-critical activities, (3) since Saturday and Sunday are not work days and are thus excluded from the schedule, some bars on the Gantt chart are longer if they cut through a weekend.]]
:[[Image:Pert example gantt chart.png|frame|none|A Gantt chart created using [[OmniPlan]].  Note (1) the [[critical path method|critical path]] is highlighted, (2) the [[Float (project management)|slack]] is not specifically indicated on task 5 (d), though it can be observed on tasks 3 and 7 (b and f), (3) since weekends are indicated by a thin vertical line, and take up no additional space on the work calendar, bars on the Gantt chart are not longer or shorter when they do or don't carry over a weekend.]]

=== Next step, creating network diagram by hand or by using diagram software ===
A network diagram can be created by hand or by using diagram software.  There are two types of network diagrams, activity on arrow ([[Arrow Diagramming Method|AOA]]) and activity on node ([[Precedence Diagram Method|AON]]).  Activity on node diagrams are generally easier to create and interpret.  To create an AON diagram, it is recommended (but not required) to start with a node named ''start''.  This &lt;nowiki&gt;"activity"&lt;/nowiki&gt; has a duration of zero (0).  Then you draw each activity that does not have a predecessor activity (''a'' and ''b'' in this example) and connect them with an arrow from start to each node.  Next, since both ''c'' and ''d'' list ''a'' as a predecessor activity, their nodes are drawn with arrows coming from ''a''.  Activity ''e'' is listed with ''b'' and ''c'' as predecessor activities, so node ''e'' is drawn with arrows coming from both ''b'' and ''c'', signifying that ''e'' cannot begin until both ''b'' and ''c'' have been completed.  Activity ''f'' has ''d'' as a predecessor activity, so an arrow is drawn connecting the activities.  Likewise, an arrow is drawn from ''e'' to ''g''.  Since there are no activities that come after ''f'' or ''g'', it is recommended (but again not required) to connect them to a node labeled ''finish''.

:[[Image:pert example network diagram.gif|frame|none|A network diagram created using [[Microsoft Project]] (MSP).  Note the [[critical path method|critical path]] is in red.]]

:[[Image:pert example node legend.GIF|frame|right|A node like this one (from [[Microsoft Visio]]) can be used to display the activity name, duration, ES, EF, LS, LF, and slack.]]

By itself, the network diagram pictured above does not give much more information than a Gantt chart; however, it can be expanded to display more information.  The most common information shown is:
# The activity name
# The expected duration time
# The early start time (ES)
# The early finish time (EF)
# The late start time (LS)
# The late finish time (LF)
# The [[float (project management)|slack]]

In order to determine this information it is assumed that the activities and normal duration times are given.  The first step is to determine the ES and EF.  The ES is defined as the maximum EF of all predecessor activities, unless the activity in question is the first activity, for which the ES is zero (0).  The EF is the ES plus the task duration (EF = ES + duration).

*The ES for ''start'' is zero since it is the first activity.  Since the duration is zero, the EF is also zero.  This EF is used as the ES for ''a'' and ''b''.
*The ES for ''a'' is zero.  The duration (4 work days) is added to the ES to get an EF of four.  This EF is used as the ES for ''c'' and ''d''.
*The ES for ''b'' is zero.  The duration (5.33 work days) is added to the ES to get an EF of 5.33.
*The ES for ''c'' is four.  The duration (5.17 work days) is added to the ES to get an EF of 9.17.
*The ES for ''d'' is four.  The duration (6.33 work days) is added to the ES to get an EF of 10.33.  This EF is used as the ES for ''f''.
*The ES for ''e'' is the greatest EF of its predecessor activities (''b'' and ''c'').  Since ''b'' has an EF of 5.33 and ''c'' has an EF of 9.17, the ES of ''e'' is 9.17.  The duration (5.17 work days) is added to the ES to get an EF of 14.34.  This EF is used as the ES for ''g''.
*The ES for ''f'' is 10.33.  The duration (4.5 work days) is added to the ES to get an EF of 14.83.
*The ES for ''g'' is 14.34.  The duration (5.17 work days) is added to the ES to get an EF of 19.51.
*The ES for ''finish'' is the greatest EF of its predecessor activities (''f'' and ''g'').  Since ''f'' has an EF of 14.83 and ''g'' has an EF of 19.51, the ES of ''finish'' is 19.51.  ''Finish'' is a milestone (and therefore has a duration of zero), so the EF is also 19.51.

Barring any [[Theory of Constraints|unforeseen events]], the project should take 19.51 work days to complete.  The next step is to determine the late start (LS) and late finish (LF) of each activity.  This will eventually show if there are activities that have [[float (project management)|slack]].  The LF is defined as the minimum LS of all successor activities, unless the activity is the last activity, for which the LF equals the EF.  The LS is the LF minus the task duration (LS = LF − duration).

*The LF for ''finish'' is equal to the EF (19.51 work days) since it is the last activity in the project.  Since the duration is zero, the LS is also 19.51 work days.  This will be used as the LF for ''f'' and ''g''.
*The LF for ''g'' is 19.51 work days.  The duration (5.17 work days) is subtracted from the LF to get an LS of 14.34 work days.  This will be used as the LF for ''e''.
*The LF for ''f'' is 19.51 work days.  The duration (4.5 work days) is subtracted from the LF to get an LS of 15.01 work days.  This will be used as the LF for ''d''.
*The LF for ''e'' is 14.34 work days.  The duration (5.17 work days) is subtracted from the LF to get an LS of 9.17 work days.  This will be used as the LF for ''b'' and ''c''.
*The LF for ''d'' is 15.01 work days.  The duration (6.33 work days) is subtracted from the LF to get an LS of 8.68 work days.
*The LF for ''c'' is 9.17 work days.  The duration (5.17 work days) is subtracted from the LF to get an LS of 4 work days.
*The LF for ''b'' is 9.17 work days.  The duration (5.33 work days) is subtracted from the LF to get an LS of 3.84 work days.
*The LF for ''a'' is the minimum LS of its successor activities.  Since ''c'' has an LS of 4 work days and ''d'' has an LS of 8.68 work days, the LF for ''a'' is 4 work days.  The duration (4 work days) is subtracted from the LF to get an LS of 0 work days.
*The LF for ''start'' is the minimum LS of its successor activities.  Since ''a'' has an LS of 0 work days and ''b'' has an LS of 3.84 work days, the LS is 0 work days.

=== Next step, determination of critical path and possible slack ===
The next step is to determine the [[critical path method|critical path]] and if any activities have [[float (project management)|slack]].  The critical path is the path that takes the '''longest''' to complete.  To determine the path times, add the task durations for all available paths.  Activities that have slack can be delayed without changing the overall time of the project.  Slack is computed in one of two ways, slack = LF − EF ''or'' slack = LS − ES.  Activities that are on the critical path have a slack of zero (0).

*The duration of path ''adf'' is 14.83 work days.
*The duration of path ''aceg'' is 19.51 work days.
*The duration of path ''beg'' is 15.67 work days.

The critical path is ''aceg'' and the critical time is 19.51 work days.  It is important to note that there can be more than one critical path (in a project more complex than this example) or that the critical path can change.  For example, let's say that activities ''d'' and ''f'' take their pessimistic (b) times to complete instead of their expected (T&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;) times.  The critical path is now ''adf'' and the critical time is 22 work days.  On the other hand, if activity ''c'' can be reduced to one work day, the path time for ''aceg'' is reduced to 15.34 work days, which is slightly less than the time of the new critical path, ''beg'' (15.67 work days).

Assuming these scenarios do not happen, the slack for each activity can now be determined.

*''Start'' and ''finish'' are milestones and by definition have no duration, therefore they can have no slack (0 work days).
*The activities on the critical path by definition have a slack of zero; however, it is always a good idea to check the math anyway when drawing by hand.
** LF&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; – EF&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = 4 − 4 = 0
** LF&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; – EF&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = 9.17 − 9.17 = 0
** LF&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; – EF&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; = 14.34 − 14.34 = 0
** LF&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; – EF&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; = 19.51 − 19.51 = 0
*Activity ''b'' has an LF of 9.17 and an EF of 5.33, so the slack is 3.84 work days.
*Activity ''d'' has an LF of 15.01 and an EF of 10.33, so the slack is 4.68 work days.
*Activity ''f'' has an LF of 19.51 and an EF of 14.83, so the slack is 4.68 work days.

Therefore, activity ''b'' can be delayed almost 4 work days without delaying the project.  Likewise, activity ''d'' '''or''' activity ''f'' can be delayed 4.68 work days without delaying the project (alternatively, ''d'' and ''f'' can be delayed 2.34 work days each).

== As project scheduling tool ==
=== Advantages ===
*  PERT chart explicitly defines and makes visible [[Dependency (project management)|dependencies]] (precedence relationships) between the work breakdown structure (commonly [[Work breakdown structure|WBS]]) elements.
*  PERT facilitates identification of the critical path and makes this visible.
*  PERT facilitates identification of early start, late start, and slack for each activity.
*  PERT provides for potentially reduced project duration due to better understanding of dependencies leading to improved overlapping of activities and tasks where feasible.
* The large amount of project data can be organized and presented in diagram for use in decision making.
* PERT can provide a probability of completing before a given time.

=== Disadvantages ===
* There can be potentially hundreds or thousands of activities and individual dependency relationships.
* PERT is not easily scalable for smaller projects.
* The network charts tend to be large and unwieldy, requiring several pages to print and requiring specially-sized paper.
* The lack of a timeframe on most PERT/CPM charts makes it harder to show status, although colours can help, ''e.g.'', specific colour for completed nodes.

=== Uncertainty in project scheduling ===

During project execution, however, a real-life project will never execute exactly as it was planned due to uncertainty. This can be due to ambiguity resulting from subjective estimates that are prone to human errors or can be the result of variability arising from unexpected events or risks. The main reason that PERT may provide inaccurate information about the project completion time is due to this schedule uncertainty. This inaccuracy may be large enough to render such estimates as not helpful.

One possible method to maximize solution robustness is to include safety in the baseline schedule in order to absorb the anticipated disruptions. This is called ''proactive scheduling''. A pure proactive scheduling is a utopia; incorporating safety in a baseline schedule which allows for every possible disruption would lead to a baseline schedule with a very large make-span. A second approach, termed ''reactive scheduling'', consists of defining a procedure to react to disruptions that cannot be absorbed by the baseline schedule.

'''Robert Michael Ballantyne''' (24 April 1825&amp;nbsp;– 8 February 1894) was a Scottish author of [[young-adult literature|juvenile fiction]] who wrote more than 100 books. He was also an accomplished artist, and exhibited some of his [[water-colours]] at the [[Royal Scottish Academy]].{{r|TimesObit}}

==Early life==
Ballantyne was born in Edinburgh on 24 April 1825, the ninth of ten children and the youngest son, to Alexander Thomson Ballantyne (1776–1847) and his wife Anne (1786–1855). Alexander was a newspaper editor and printer in the family firm of "Ballantyne &amp; Co" based at Paul's Works on the [[Canongate]],{{sfnp |Lees |1832 |p=48 |ps=}} and Robert's uncle [[James Ballantyne]] (1772–1833) was the printer for Scottish author [[Sir Walter Scott]].{{r|ODNB}} In 1832-33 the family is known to have been living at 20 Fettes Row, in the  northern New Town of Edinburgh.{{sfnp |Lees |1832 |p=48 |ps=}} A UK-wide [[panic of 1825|banking crisis]] in 1825 resulted in the collapse of the Ballantyne printing business the following year with debts of £130,000,{{r|McKinstry2002}} which led to a decline in the family's fortunes.{{r|ODNB}}

Ballantyne went to Canada aged 16, and spent five years working for the [[Hudson's Bay Company]]. He traded with the local Native Americans for furs, which required him to travel by canoe and sleigh to the areas occupied by the modern-day provinces of Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec, experiences that formed the basis of his novel ''Snowflakes and Sunbeams'' (1856).{{r|ODNB}} His longing for family and home during that period impressed him to start writing letters to his mother. Ballantyne recalled in his autobiographical ''Personal Reminiscences in Book Making'' (1893) that "To this long-letter writing I attribute whatever small amount of facility in composition I may have acquired."{{sfnp |Ballantyne |2004 |p=4 |ps=}}

==Writing career==
In 1847 Ballantyne returned to Scotland to discover that his father had died. He published his first book the following year, ''Hudson's Bay: or, Life in the Wilds of North America'', and for some time was employed by the publishers [[Constable &amp; Robinson|Messrs Constable]]. In 1856 he gave up business to focus on his literary career, and began the series of adventure stories for the young with which his name is popularly associated.{{r|TimesObit}}

''The Young Fur-Traders'' (1856), ''[[The Coral Island]]'' (1857), ''The World of Ice'' (1859), ''Ungava: a Tale of Eskimo Land'' (1857), ''The Dog Crusoe'' (1860), ''The Lighthouse'' (1865), ''Fighting the Whales'' (1866), ''Deep Down'' (1868), ''[[The Pirate City: An Algerine Tale|The Pirate City]]'' (1874), ''Erling the Bold'' (1869), ''The Settler and the Savage'' (1877), and more than 100 other books followed in regular succession, his rule being in every case to write as far as possible from personal knowledge of the scenes he described.{{r|TimesObit}} ''The Gorilla Hunters. A tale of the wilds of Africa'' (1861) shares three characters with ''The Coral Island'': Jack Martin, Red Rover and Peterkin Gay. Here Ballantyne relied factually on [[Paul du Chaillu]]'s ''Exploration in Equatorial Guinea'', which had appeared early in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Jarndyce. The New York Antiquarian Fair, March 8–11, 2018.[https://www.jarndyce.co.uk/online_catalogues/E-LIST%20NEW%20YORK%20BOOK%20FAIR%202018.pdf Retrieved 28 February 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Coral Island'' is the most popular of Ballantyne's novels still read and remembered today,{{r|Forman}} but because of one mistake he made in that book, in which he gave an incorrect thickness of coconut shells, he subsequently attempted to gain first-hand knowledge of his subject matter. For instance, he spent some time living with the lighthouse keepers at the [[Bell Rock Lighthouse|Bell Rock]] before writing ''The Lighthouse'', and while researching for ''Deep Down'' he spent time with the [[tin]] miners of [[Cornwall]].{{r|TimesObit}}

In 1866 Ballantyne married Jane Grant (c.&amp;nbsp;1845&amp;nbsp;– c.&amp;nbsp;1924), with whom he had three sons and three daughters.{{r|ODNB}}

==Later life and death==
Ballantyne spent his later years in [[Harrow, London]], before moving to Italy for the sake of his health, possibly suffering from undiagnosed [[Ménière's disease]]. He died in Rome on 8 February 1894, and was buried in the [[Protestant Cemetery, Rome|Protestant Cemetery]] there.{{r|ODNB}}

==Legacy==
A [[Greater London Council]] plaque commemorates Ballantyne at "Duneaves" on Mount Park Road in Harrow.{{r|EngHet}}

One of the young men influenced by Ballantyne was [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] (1850–94). He was so impressed with the story of ''The Coral Island'' (1857) that he based portions of his famous book ''[[Treasure Island]]'' (1881) on themes found in Ballantyne. He honoured Ballantyne in the introduction to ''Treasure Island'' with the following poem:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
To the Hesitating Purchaser

:If sailor tales to sailor tunes,
:Storm and adventure, heat and cold,
:If schooners, islands, and maroons,
:And buccaneers, and buried gold,
:And all the old romance, retold
:Exactly in the ancient way,
:Can please, as me they pleased of old,
:The wiser youngsters of today:

:So be it, and fall on! If not,
:If studious youth no longer crave,
:His ancient appetites forgot,
:[[William Henry Giles Kingston|Kingston]], or Ballantyne the brave,
:Or [[James Fenimore Cooper|Cooper]] of the wood and wave:
:So be it, also! And may I
:And all my pirates share the grave
:Where these and their creations lie!&lt;/poem&gt;}}

'''Sir Robert James Kerridge''' (30 October 1901 &amp;ndash; 26 April 1979) was a New Zealand businessman, cinema proprietor, film distributor, tourism promoter and entrepreneur. He was born in [[Christchurch]], [[North Canterbury]], [[New Zealand]] on 30 October 1901. He developed a theatre chain that owned or controlled 133 cinemas, the biggest exhibition chain in New Zealand or Australia. In 1946 Kerridge sold 50 per cent of his cinema chain to the [[J. Arthur Rank Organisation]] of London, netting the vendors almost £1 million, and a [[Rolls Royce]] car for Kerridge. The chain was renamed '''Kerridge Odeon'''.&lt;ref name="DNZB Kerridge"&gt;{{DNZB|title=Robert James Kerridge|first= L. R.|last= Shelton|id=4k10|accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
'''''The Intangibles of Leadership''''' uncovers patterns in the attributes that truly distinguish those who succeed at the top. After more than a decade of senior executive assessments, CEO interviews, and proprietary research, Davis found that extraordinary leaders possess certain characteristics that fall between the lines of existing leadership models, yet are fundamental to executive success. Davis explains each of these qualities, the people who exemplify them, how to detect them in others, and how to develop the subtle characteristics that will enable leaders to stand out from the pack. The book has been highly reviewed and was named as a "Top Business Book of 2010 by Library Journal".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libraryjournal.com/lj/collectiondevelopmentspecialty2/888437-483/lj_best_business_books_2010.html.csp#management BS010611BestBusiness&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120052045/http://www.libraryjournal.com/lj/collectiondevelopmentspecialty2/888437-483/lj_best_business_books_2010.html.csp#management |date=2013-01-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ten Intangibles outlined in the book are:
# Wisdom
# Will
# Executive Maturity
# Integrity
# Social Judgment
# Presence
# Self-Insight
# Self-Efficacy
# Fortitude
# Fallibility

According to the author, the book is a practical atlas of the characteristics that most define extraordinary leaders and their underlying psychological mechanisms. It was designed as a mirror to help executives think about how they approach leadership and gain insights that can enable them to grow and develop.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2577">'''Thomas Scott Cadden''' (December 2, 1923 – November 2, 2007) was a pioneering television commercial producer, director, writer, and songwriter during the 50s, 60s, and 70s. He is best known for composing the famous [[Mr. Clean]] [[advertising jingle]] written in 1957 for use with the product's introduction in 1958. He produced, directed and wrote the [[Mr. Clean]] commercials until the 1970s. The Mr. Clean jingle is still used today in a more contemporary arrangement.

Other Cadden highlights were commercials written for Curad [[adhesive bandage]]s, [[Pringles]] potato snacks, [[Head &amp; Shoulders]] anti-[[dandruff]] [[shampoo]], and [[Alka Seltzer]], and scores of other commercials and jingles.  Cadden was a part of a [[Chicago]] trio of jingle writers featuring Bill Walker and [[Dick Marx]] (father of singer/songwriter [[Richard Marx]]).

Cadden was born in [[Baxter Springs, Kansas]], in 1923. He learned to play the piano at a very early age.  In 1941 he attended the University of Kansas, but his college was interrupted by World War II military service in Europe and the Pacific from 1942 to 1946. Cadden returned to the University to finish his degree in journalism.  Cadden was initiated into [[Kappa Tau Alpha]] Journalism Society in 1977. He was also a very active member of the Kansas Alpha [[Phi Kappa Psi]] fraternity in [[Lawrence, Kansas]].  Cadden retired from advertising in the 1980s and wrote ''What a Bunch of Characters'', a book on fifty [[film]] actors. In the 1990s and early 2000s Cadden would make special appearances as a guest of [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] during Mr. Clean advertising promotions.  Thomas Scott Cadden passed in [[Glenview, Cook County, Illinois|Glenview, Illinois]], of complications from pneumonia.

The '''Tomé Fèteira, [[SA (corporation)|S.A.]]''' is a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[tool]] manufacturing company. It produces [[file (tool)|files]], [[saw|saw blades]], bowsaws, [[handle]]s, [[forging]] machines, and automatic cutting machines.

The company was founded in 1856 by Joaquim Tomé Fèteira, a [[metalworking]] craftsman from Vieira de Leiria in the [[Marinha Grande Municipality]]. Metalworking was already traditional in the region, providing tools for the [[timber industry]] connected to the nearby Pine Forest of Leiria.

After its founding, the production of the company soon exceeded the needs of the local timber industry, and the company started to sell products to the rest of Portugal. By early 20th century, the company had begun to export its products. In the 1940s, foreign sales accounted for 4/5 of its production.

The company was named PME Leader and PME Excellency in 2010 by IAPMEI.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1325">The '''United Rubber Workers of Great Britain''' was an organisation representing workers involved in the processing of [[rubber]] and other waterproof materials in the United Kingdom.

The union was founded in 1889 as the '''Waterproof Trade Union''', then in 1891 changed its name to the '''India Rubber, Cable and Asbestos Workers' Union'''.  Before [[World War I]] it was renamed the '''United Rubber Workers of Great Britain'''.  Its membership fell to only 312 in 1936, at the end of a long trade depression, but it survived and by 1945, membership had risen to more than 4,000 people.  It then changed its name to the '''Rubber, Plastic and Allied Workers' Union'''.&lt;ref name="marsh"&gt;Arthur Marsh and Victoria Ryan, ''Historical Directory of Trade Unions'', vol.2, pp.316-317&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, the union merged into the [[National Union of General and Municipal Workers]].&lt;ref name="marsh" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8049">'''Dr. Vivian Chan''' (born 21 September 1984) is a British Australian entrepreneur and businesswoman. She is the co-founder and CEO of [[Sparrho]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wauters|first1=Robin|title=Startup Spotlight: Q&amp;A with Vivian Chan, founder of scientific info recommendation engine Sparrho|url=http://tech.eu/features/4074/startup-spotlight-sparrho-vivian-chan/|website=Tech.eu|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a London-based startup blending [[machine learning]] and expert human curation to democratise science.

== Early life ==
Born in Hong Kong, Chan's family moved to Australia aged 6. She grew up back and forth between Hong Kong and Australia, eventually settling in Australia's Gold Coast. Her parents worked in education and her grandparents in publishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Costa|first1=Crissy|title=52 Founders in London.

== Education ==
Chan attended [[Trinity Lutheran College (Queensland)|Trinity Lutheran College]] and went on to read biotechnology at the [[University of Queensland]] (UQ), achieving a BBiotech in Drug Design and Development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UQ Biotech graduate takes science to new levels|url=http://www.scmb.uq.edu.au/testimonial-vivian-chan|website=The University of Queensland|accessdate=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After spending a year working at UQ as an Investment Process Manager in life sciences for the venture fund Uniseed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cambridge Chemistry: The Right Mix|url=http://www.science.uq.edu.au/vivian-chan|website=The University of Queensland}}&lt;/ref&gt;, she received a Cambridge Commonwealth scholarship to study for a PhD in protein crystallography at the [[University of Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr Vivian Chan|url=http://www.csap.cam.ac.uk/network/vivian-chan/|website=University of Cambridge|accessdate=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst at Cambridge, she was voted into the role of president of the Cambridge University Technology &amp; Enterprise Club (CUTEC) from 2010-2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cambridge University Technology &amp; Enterprise Club|url=http://www.cutec.org/|website=CUTEC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chan was still in this role when she was approached by [[Alice Bentinck]] and Matthew Clifford of [[Entrepreneur First]], who were seeking to recruit 30 graduates with entrepreneurship ambition. Chan had recently completed her PhD and was a member of the EF student advisory board, so decided to apply "at the last minute" and was selected to take part in EF's first cohort in 2012-13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Young|first1=Tiffany|title=Dr. Vivian Chan - Democratising Science!|url=http://www.breakfastwithtiffany.co.uk/blog/2016/4/30/dr-vivian-chan-democratising-science|website=Breakfast With Tiffany|accessdate=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, she met Nilu Satharasinghe, an experienced startup founder with a background in [[machine learning]] and a MSc in [[computer science]] from the [[University of Oxford]].

== Sparrho ==
Chan and Satharasinghe founded [[Sparrho]] in 2013 as a solution to issues in staying up to date with scientific literature encountered over the course of Chan's biochemistry PhD. Inspiration for Sparrho came from Steve, a postdoctoral researcher in Chan's research lab who would read several key journals and bring paper recommendations to Chan's research group every morning. When Chan described this problem to Satharasinghe, he suggested 'digitising Steve'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The biochemistry of an entrepreneur: Vivian Chan from Sparrho|url=http://eastldn.co.uk/2015/06/17/the-biochemistry-of-an-entrepreneur-vivian-chan-from-sparrho/|website=EastLDN|accessdate=8 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea grew into the creation of Sparrho, a science research discovery platform combining artificial and human intelligence to help research professionals and layman users stay up-to-date with new scientific publications and patents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Sparrho: Making science more discoverable, understandable and sharable|url=https://about.sparrho.com/index.htm#_=_|website=Sparrho|accessdate=8 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of Q2 2017, Sparrho has raised a total of $3 million of funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Magistretti|first1=Berenice|title=Sparrho raises $3 million to democratize access to science research|url=https://venturebeat.com/2017/07/10/sparrho-raises-3-million-to-democratize-access-to-scientific-research/|website=VentureBeat|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Honours and awards ==

'''Yellowfin''' is an Australian-headquartered [[business intelligence]] (BI), analytics, [[dashboard]] and [[report]]ing software vendor. It develops and markets a suite of products that are used to transform, access, analyse and report on data held in common business sources including [[spreadsheets]], Web [[API]]s and [[database]]s.

== History ==

Yellowfin was founded in Melbourne, Australia in 2003 by a group of business intelligence industry veterans.

The company released its first product, a [[ROLAP]] (Relational OLAP) browser-based web application for a [[Software as a service|SAAS]] software vendor in 2004. This resulted in an early specialization in providing both embedded reporting capabilities to software companies as well as support for the complexities of multi-tenancy hosted environments.

The product is based on an open server architecture and was developed in Java. The design provided the basis for subsequent releases to introduce additional levels of functionality. Amongst these were the development of an integrated [[location intelligence]] module (2009), a social media layer (2010), and a responsive [[Mobile business intelligence|mobile BI]] platform (2012).&lt;ref name="mobile"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/technology/enterprise/marvels-on-your-mobile-20100322-qrb0.html |work=Sydney Morning Herald |title=Marvels on your mobile |date=March 23, 2010 |first=Lia |last=Timson}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Further innovations include the pioneering of Storyboard, a Collaboration module (2014), and Content Canvas for free-form visualizations (2016).

In 2017, Yellowfin launched 7.4 with its first AI/ML capabilities for Augmented Analytics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Augmented Analytics |url=https://www.gartner.com/webinar/3846165}}&lt;/ref&gt; using machine-assisted insights, data science integration and ETL capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New Era of Analytics: Combine the best of mind and machine |url=https://www.jenunderwood.com/2018/02/12/new-era-analytics-combine-mind-and-machine/ |website=Jen Underwood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, with the launch of Yellowfin 8 and the introduction of two additional products – Yellowfin Stories and Yellowfin Signals  –  the company changed its approach, releasing the platform as a suite of five packaged products. Yellowfin Signals is continuing development in the augmented analytics space, enabling a machine automated analytics product. 

Due to the early association with other software vendors, Yellowfin has continued to specialize in the embedded business intelligence market providing its solution as a [[White-label product|white label product]].  The company's primary business model is growth via channel sales through resellers, software partners as well as industry alliances such as [[Sybase]].&lt;ref name="Sybase"&gt;[http://www.sybase.com.au/detail?id=1059730 Sybase Partnership with Yellowfin], Sybase.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of these partnerships Yellowfin has over 3 million end users and 27,000 clients in over 75 countries. The software is used across a broad range of industries including financial services,&lt;ref name="financial services"&gt;[http://www.istart.co.nz/index/HM20/AL210753/AR211274 iStart Paymark signs Yellowfin], Financial Services,&lt;/ref&gt; retail,&lt;ref name="retail "&gt;[http://www.techworld.com.au/article/256922/plumber_350_linux_desktops_bonanza_yellowfin_bi Techworld, Plumber's 350 Linux desktops bonanza for Yellowfin BI], Retail.&lt;/ref&gt; telecommunications, logistics,&lt;ref name="logistics "&gt;[http://www.crn.com.au/Feature/214521,logistics-swings--roundabouts.aspx CRN, Logistics is getting smarter thanks to data warehousing and business intelligence], Logistics.&lt;/ref&gt; professional services and government.
