'''Aboriginal sites of New South Wales''' consist of a large number of places in the Australian state of [[New South Wales]] where it is still possible to see visible signs of the activities and culture of the Australian Aboriginals who previously occupied these areas.

These sites are comparable with the [[petroglyphs]] of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] and the [[Rock Art]] found elsewhere in Australia, but are not restricted to rock carvings. Many of the sites are on the (now defunct) [[Register of the National Estate]].&lt;ref&gt;Heritage of Australia, Macmillan Publishers, 1981, pp.50-67&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and description==

The [[Aboriginal Australians]] arrived in the north of [[Australia]] around 50,000 years ago. Sites over 22,000 years old have been found in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]] area west of Sydney, while sites going back 40,000 years exist at [[Lake Mungo]].&lt;ref&gt;2003 Guide to NSW National Parks (National Parks and Wildlife Service) 2003, p.59&lt;/ref&gt; There are some thousands of known sites, many but not all located in national parks. Some sites are also found in more suburban settings; rock carvings can be seen in the Sydney suburbs of [[North Bondi, New South Wales|Bondi]] and [[Tamarama, New South Wales|Tamarama]].

Their art was part of day-to-day life and would normally have had a purpose. One such purpose is thought to have been what some people call "wish fulfilment magic"—or sympathetic magic—in which the act of creating the magical work is thought to bring about the event depicted in the work. For example, a hunting scene—a common subject in rock carvings—would be aimed at bringing about the desired reality of good hunting.&lt;ref&gt;Aboriginal Art of Australia, Barbara Mullins (Mulavon Pty Ltd) 1986, p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also many artworks that were created for specific ceremonial purposes and which were not intended to last after the ceremony was over.&lt;ref&gt;Aboriginal Art of Australia, p.33&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to such themes, there were also works of a more secular nature, which could be created for a number of reasons, including the instruction and entertainment of children.

There are substantial variations in the character of art developed in different parts of New South Wales. Art in the western part of the state could be very different from the art created in coastal areas.  Aboriginal sites in the state are administered by the [[National Parks and Wildlife Service (New South Wales)|National Parks and Wildlife Service]] of New South Wales. All known sites are recorded on the register known as the Aboriginal Heritage Information Management System (AHIMS), which is run by the National Parks and Wildlife Service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/licences/AboriginalHeritageInformationManagementSystem.htm AHIMS website:Retrieved 17 September 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is generally a policy of protecting Aboriginal sites, although a small number of sites are publicised. Notable examples are those at the Basin Track, Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, and the Bulgandry site, Brisbane Water National Park. However, most sites are not publicised, and restricted sites (colloquially known as sacred sites) will never be made public. If anyone thinks they have a legitimate reason for wanting to inspect sites that are not normally available to the public, they can apply to AHIMS for permission.

The sites are of many different types, for example:
* Paintings
* Rock carvings
* [[Hand stencil]]s
* Charcoal drawings
* Shell middens
* Shield trees
* Restricted sites

Image:Imitation1.jpg|European imitation, Grotto Point, [[Sydney Harbour National Park]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;

'''Paintings''' cover a wide range of subjects, both spiritual and secular. Coloured pigmentation was created with ochre (giving a red/orange colour), charcoal (for a black pigmentation) and ash (for grey pigmentation). One good example is the rock shelter popularly known as Baiame's Cave, at [[Milbrodale, New South Wales|Milbrodale]], with paintings depicting a large figure that may be [[Baiame]], the Sky Father.

'''Rock carvings''', also known as petroglyphs or Rock Engravings, are of a style known as "simple figurative", which conventional archaeological thinking dates to the last 5000 years. Other engravings show [[Europe]]an [[sailing ships]], and so cannot be more than about 200 years old. Thus we are left with a date range of 5000–200 years ago. It is likely that some of the freshest engravings represent the later part of that time range, whilst the most worn represent the earliest part. However, the situation is complicated by the fact that we know the engravings were sometimes "re-grooved" during ceremonies. Carvings could be very large. In some carvings, the figure of Baiame the Sky Father could be eighteen metres tall.&lt;ref&gt;Aboriginal Art of Australia, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to pictorial carvings, there are many grinding grooves, caused by grinding stone implements on a rock surface to shape them and give them an edge. Areas like Sydney and the Blue Mountains have many rock carvings because they predominantly consist of sandstone (known as Hawkesbury sandstone), which is a very suitable surface for rock carvings. See [[Sydney Rock Engravings]] for the main article on these.

'''Hand stencils''' can often be found in rock shelters and caves, which have given them protection from the elements over the years. They were created by placing the hand on a rocky surface and blowing pigmentation around it, leaving the silhouette of the hand on the rock. There is often a number of them in one place. The best-known example is Red Hands Cave, in the [[Blue Mountains National Park]], which has many stencils, including those created by children as well as adults.&lt;ref&gt;Sydney and Blue Mountains Bushwalks, Neil Paton (Kangaroo Press) 2004, p.170&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charcoal drawings''' were exactly that: drawings executed with a piece of charcoal. Like the rock carvings, they could be of a wide range of subjects, with animals often featured.

'''Shell middens''' developed in occupation sites where shell fish were consumed. Over the years, layers of shells would build up, creating a concentration of many shells in the soil around the occupation site.

'''Shield trees''' are seen occasionally in the Sydney bush. A substantial piece of bark would be cut out of a tree and used as a shield or tray. A visible "scar" was thus left behind, which could vary considerably in size, some being quite large.

'''Restricted areas''' (otherwise known as sacred sites) are usually of a spiritual nature and were restricted to adult males and, in some cases, women. These sites could include ceremonial sites, bora grounds, men's sites and women's birthing sites.

==Occupation sites and sacred sites==

It is necessary to distinguish between occupation sites and sacred sites, a subject about which there is often great confusion. Many people think that all Aboriginal sites are "sacred sites", but the reality is more complex. Before white settlement, most indigenous sites were occupation sites, which were used by all members of a tribe. Sacred sites, on the other hand, were restricted to adult males, except for certain women's sites. In more recent times, all indigenous sites 
have become known as sacred sites; those that were previously known as sacred sites are now known as restricted sites.

==Imitations==

It is worth noting that there are many imitation sites, in which Europeans created imitations of Aboriginal art, usually in the form of rock carvings. One of the most prominent examples is a large carving of a kangaroo alongside a walking track at Grotto Point, in the [[Sydney Harbour National Park]]. This has been known for some time to be an imitation (or fake, as some would say).&lt;ref&gt;Walks in the Sydney Harbour National Park, Neil Paton (Kangaroo Press) 1987, p.31&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

'''''Allegory of Justice''''' is an oil on panel painting, commissioned on 6 January 1543 from [[Giorgio Vasari]] by cardinal [[Alessandro Farnese (cardinal)|Alessandro Farnese]] for the main room of the [[Palazzo della Cancelleria]] in Rome. It and the rest of the [[Farnese collection]] were later moved to Naples and it is now in the [[National Museum of Capodimonte]].

The '''architecture of [[Samoa]]''' is characterised by openness, with the design mirroring the culture and life of the [[Samoan people]] who inhabit the [[Samoa Islands]].&lt;ref name="googleDocPaper"&gt;[https://docs.google.com/gview?a=v&amp;q=cache:DOXF5EmAXHQJ:cipa.icomos.org/fileadmin/papers/antalya/18.pdf+Samoan+architecture&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=nz&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESj5F2Hi2o5ky61cj5k0RYuhkP7QK3jXf--TVo-gFvFnX7FPUhIsZAiBfepQNLdkcHGDNJKvQklcamttUpUwPmIIKfywhI1WuXT3foYgi6MtyxVo5X3dtXviyBKxMVtrghbfMvE7&amp;sig=AFQjCNFlPg6HbFWZKFxFh2Hl4VdUNaUBgg] Recording the Cultural Heritages of Samoa and the Fiji Islands, U. Herbig, G. Zohrer, F. Samoliy. Retrieved 26 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Architectural concepts are incorporated into [[Samoan proverbs]], oratory and metaphors, as well as linking to other art forms in Samoa, such as boat building and [[Pe'a|tattooing]]. The spaces outside and inside of traditional Samoan architecture are part of cultural form, ceremony and ritual.

'''''Fale''''' is the Samoan word for all types of houses, from small to large.

In general, traditional Samoan architecture is characterized by an oval or circular shape, with wooden posts holding up a domed roof. There are no walls. The base of the architecture is a skeleton frame.

Before European arrival and the availability of Western materials, a Samoan ''fale'' did not use any metal in its construction.

==Lashing ''{{okina}}Afa''==
[[File:Magimagi - Mainbeam.jpg|right|thumb|120px|Similar Fijian lashing (''[[magimagi]]'')]]
[[File:Magimagi - Diags.jpg|right|thumb|120px|''afa'' woven pattern]]
The ''fale'' is lashed and tied together with a plaited [[sennit]] rope called ''{{okina}}afa'', handmade from dried [[coconut]] fibre. The ''{{okina}}afa'' is woven tight in complex patterns around the wooden frame, and binds the entire construction together. ''{{okina}}Afa'' is made from the husk of certain varieties of coconuts with long fibres, particularly the ''niu'afa'' (''afa'' palm). The husks are soaked in fresh water to soften the interfibrous portion.  The husks from mature nuts must be soaked from four to five weeks, or perhaps even longer, and very mature fibre is best soaked in salt water, but the green husk from a special variety of coconut is ready in four or five days.
Soaking is considered to improve the quality of the fibre. Old men or women then beat the husk with a mallet on a wooden [[anvil]] to separate the fibres, which, after a further washing to remove interfibrous material, are tied together in bundles and dried in the sun. When this stage is completed, the fibres are manufactured into sennit by plaiting, a task usually done by elderly men or ''[[fa'amatai|matai]]'', and performed at their leisure. This usually involves them seated on the ground rolling the dried fibre strands against their bare thigh by hand, until heavier strands are formed. These long, thin strands are then woven together into a three-ply plait, often in long lengths, that is the finished sennit. The sennit is then coiled in bundles or wound tightly in very neat cylindrical rolls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An Introduction to Samoan Custom |last=Grattan |first=F.J.H.  |year=1985 |publisher=R. McMillan |location=New Zealand |isbn=0-908712-13-8|page= |pages=164, 165 |url=http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-GraIntr-_N65654.html|accessdate=14 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Making enough lengths of ''afa'' for an entire house can take months of work. The construction of an ordinary traditional ''fale'' is estimated to use 30,000 to 50,000 feet of ''{{okina}}afa''. The lashing construction of the Samoan ''fale'' is one of the great architectural achievements of [[Polynesia]].&lt;ref name="Columbia"&gt;[http://app.cul.columbia.edu:8080/ac/handle/10022/AC:P:2113]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Space as social construct : the vernacular architecture of rural Samoa by Anne Elizabeth Guernsey Allen, Columbia University Abstract. Retrieved 26 October 2009
&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar lashing technique was also used in traditional boat building, where planks of wood were 'sewn' together in parts. ''{{okina}}Afa'' has many other uses in Samoan material culture, including ceremonial items, such as the ''fue'' fly whisk, a symbol of orator status. This lashing technique was also used in other parts of Polynesia, such as the ''[[magimagi]]'' of [[Fiji]].

==Cultural space==
[[File:Samoan fale, Lelepa village, Savaii, Samoa 2009.JPG|left|thumb|250px|Situated by the beach and raised a meter off the ground, this ''fale tele'' in [[Lelepa (village)|Lelepa]] village on [[Savai'i|Savai'i Island]] has an iron roof replacing traditional thatching for the roof, although ''pola'' (suspended in photo), traditional 'wall blinds' around the poles of the ''fale'' are still used.]]
The form of a ''fale'', especially the large meeting houses, creates both physical and invisible spatial areas, which are clearly understood in Samoan custom, and dictate areas of social interaction. The use and function of the ''fale'' is closely linked to the Samoan system of social organisation, especially the ''[[Fa'amatai]]'' chiefly system.

Those gathered at a formal gathering or ''fono'' are always seated cross-legged on mats on the floor, around the ''fale'', facing each other with an open space in the middle. The interior directions of a ''fale'', east, west, north and south, as well as the positions of the posts, affect the seating positions of chiefs according to rank, the place where orators (host or visiting party) must stand to speak or the side of the house where guests and visitors enter and are seated. The space also defines the position where the 'ava makers (''aumaga'') in the [[Samoa 'ava ceremony]] are seated and the open area for the presentation and exchanging of cultural items such as the ''[['ie toga]]'' fine mats.

The front of a Samoan house is that part that faces the main thoroughfare or road through the village. The floor is quartered, and each section is named: ''Tala luma'' is the front side section, ''tala tua'' the back section, and ''tala'', the two end or side sections.&lt;ref name=tp/&gt; The middle posts, termed ''matua tala'' are reserved for the leading chiefs and the side posts on the front section, termed ''pou o le pepe'' are occupied by the orators. The posts at the back of the house, ''talatua'', indicate the positions maintained by the 'ava makers and others serving the gathering.&lt;ref name=tp&gt;An Account of Samoan History up to 1918 by Te'o Tuvale. NZ Electronic Text Centre. Retrieved 27 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The immediate area exterior of the ''fale'' is usually kept clear, and is either a grassy lawn or sandy area if the village is by the sea. The open area in front of the large meeting houses, facing the main thoroughfare or road in a village, is called the ''malae'', and is an important outdoor area for larger gatherings and ceremonial interaction.

The word "''fale''" is also constructed with other words to denote social groupings or rank, such as the ''faleiva'' (house of nine) orator group in certain districts. The term is also used to describe certain buildings and their functions. The word for hospital is ''falema'i'', "house of the ill".

The simplest types of ''fale'' are called ''faleo'o'', which have become popular as ecofriendly and low-budget [[beach fale|beach accommodations]] in local tourism. Every family complex in Samoa has a ''fale tele'', the meeting house, "big house".

The site on which the house is built is called ''tulaga fale'' (place to stand).&lt;ref name=tp/&gt;

==''Tufuga fau fale''==
The builders in Samoan architecture were also the architects, and they belonged to an exclusive ancient guild of master builders, ''Tufuga fau fale''. The Samoan word ''tufuga'' denotes the status of master craftsmen who have achieved the highest rank in skill and knowledge in a particular traditional art form. The words ''fau-fale'' means ''house builder''. There were ''Tufuga'' of navigation (''Tufuga fau va'a'') and [[pe'a|Samoan tattooing]] (''Tufuga ta tatau'').
Contracting the services of a ''Tufuga fau fale'' required negotiations and cultural custom.&lt;ref name="nzetc"&gt;[http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-BucSamo-t1-body1-d2-d8-d12.html] Samoan Material Culture by Te Rangi Hiroa ([[Te Rangi Hīroa|Sir Peter Buck]]), p.87. Retrieved 26 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of ''fale''==
[[File:Cocos nucifera - Köhler–s Medizinal-Pflanzen-187.jpg|left|thumb|100px|Coconut husk of nut used to make ''afa'' rope]]
[[File:Samoa houses circa 1930s-photographer and location unknown.jpg|thumb|upright|200px|''Fale tele'' in a village]]

The '''fale tele''' (big house), the most important house, is usually round in shape, and serves as a meeting house for chief council meetings, family gatherings, funerals or chief title investitures. The ''fale tele'' is always situated at the front of all other houses in an extended family complex. The houses behind it serve as living quarters, with an outdoor cooking area at the rear of the compound.&lt;ref name=tp/&gt; At the front is an open area, called a ''malae''. The ''malae'', (similar to ''marae'' concept in [[Māori culture|Māori]] and other Polynesian cultures), is usually a well-kept, grassy lawn or sandy area. The ''malae'' is an important cultural space where interactions between visitors and hosts or outdoor formal gatherings take place.

The open characteristics of Samoan architecture are also mirrored in the overall pattern of house sites in a village, where all ''fale tele'' are situated prominently at the fore of all other dwellings in the village, and sometimes form a semicircle, usually facing seawards.

In modern times, with the decline of traditional architecture and the availability of western building materials, the shape of the ''fale tele'' has become rectangular, though the spatial areas in custom and ceremony remain the same.
[[File:Fale on Manono Island.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''Faleo'o'' (''[[beach fale]]'') with simple roof thatching on [[Manono Island]], 2009]]
Traditionally, the '''afolau''' (long house), a longer ''fale'' shaped like a stretched oval, served as the dwelling house or guest house.

The '''faleo'o''' (small house), traditionally long in shape, was really an addition to the main house. It is not so well constructed and is situated always at the back of the main dwelling.&lt;ref name=tp/&gt; In modern times, the term is also used for any type of small and simple ''fale'', which is not the main house of dwelling. Popular as a "grass hut" or [[beach fale]] in village tourism, many are raised about a meter off the ground on stilts, sometimes with an iron roof. In a village, families build a ''faleo'o'' beside the main house or by the sea for resting during the heat of the day or as an extra sleeping space at night if there are guests.

The '''tunoa''' (cook house) is a flimsy structure, small in size, and not really to be considered as a house. In modern times, the cook house, called the ''umukuka'', is at the rear of the family compound, where all the cooking is carried out in an earth oven, ''umu'', and pots over the fire. In most villages, the ''umukuka'' is really a simple open shed made with a few posts with an iron roof to protect the cooking area from the weather.

==Construction==
[[File:Seumanutafa's house Apia 1896.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Samoan ''fale'' construction 1896]]
Construction of a ''fale'', especially the large and important ''fale tele'', often involves the whole extended family and help from their village community.

The ''Tufuga fai fale'' oversees the entire building project. Before construction, the family prepares the building site. Lava, coral, sand or stone materials are usually used for this purpose. The ''Tufuga'', his assistants (''autufuga'') and men from the family cut the timber from the forest.

The main supporting posts, erected first, vary in number, size and length depending on the shape and dimensions of the house. Usually they are between 16 and 25 feet in length and six to 12&amp;nbsp;inches in diameter, and are buried about four feet in the ground. The term for these posts is ''poutu'' (standing posts); they are erected in the middle of the house, forming central pillars.

Attached to the ''poutu'' are cross pieces of wood of a substantial size called ''so'a''. The ''so'a'' extend from the ''poutu'' to the outside circumference of the ''fale'' and their ends are fastened to further supporting pieces called ''la'au fa'alava''.
[[File:Samoa Tourism Office, Apia, 2009.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Samoa tourism office in [[Apia]] incorporating traditional design of a ''Fale'']]
The ''la'au fa'alava'', placed horizontally, are attached at their ends to wide strips of wood continuing from the ''faulalo'' to the ''auau''. These wide strips are called ''ivi'ivi''. The ''faulalo'' is a tubular piece (or pieces) of wood about four inches in diameter running around the circumference of the house at the lower extremity of the roof, and is supported on the ''poulalo''. The ''auau'' is one or more pieces of wood of substantial size resting on the top of the ''poutu''. At a distance of about two feet between each are circular pieces of wood running around the house and extending from the ''faulalo'' to the top of the building. They are similar to the ''faulalo''.

The ''poulalo'' are spaced about three to four feet apart and are sunk about two feet in the ground. They average three to four inches in diameter, and extend about five feet above the floor of the ''fale''. The height of the ''poulalo'' above the floor determines the height of the lower extremity of the roof from the ground.

On the framework are attached innumerable ''aso'', thin strips of timber (about half an inch by a quarter by 12 to 25 feet in length). They extend from the ''faulalo'' to the ''ivi'ivi'', and are spaced from one to two inches apart. Attached to these strips at right angles are further strips, ''paeaso'', the same size as ''aso.'' As a result, the roof of the ''fale'' is divided into an enormous number of small squares.&lt;ref name=tp/&gt;

==Timber==
[[File:Samoan house under construction 1914.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''Fale'' under construction, 1914]]
Most of the timber is grown in forests on family land. The timber was cut in the forest and carried to the building site in the village. The heavy work involved the builder's assistants, members of the family and help from the village community.

The main posts were from the [[Breadfruit|breadfruit tree]] (''ulu''), or ''ifi lele'' or ''pou muli'' if this wood was not available. The long principal rafters had to be flexible, so [[Coconut palm|coconut]] wood (''niu'') was always selected. The breadfruit tree was also used for other parts of the main framework.&lt;ref name="nzetc2"&gt;[http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-BucSamo-t1-body1-d2-d7-d1.html] Samoan Material Culture by Te Rangi Hiroa (Sir Peter Buck), p.22. Retrieved 31 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, the timbers most frequently used in the construction of Samoan houses are:-

Posts (''poutu'' and ''poulalo''): ''ifi lele'', ''pou muli'', ''asi'', ''ulu'', ''talia'', ''launini'u'' and ''aloalovao''.
''Fau'': ''ulu'', ''fau'', ''niu'', and ''uagani''
''Aso'' and ''paeso'': ''niuvao'', ''ulu'', ''matomo'' and ''olomea''

The ''auau'' and ''talitali'' use ''ulu'' and the ''so'a' used both ''ulu'' and ''niu''.

==Thatch==
[[File:Samoan.village.on.the.Manu’a.Island.Group.Andrew.Thomas 1890-1910.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Samoan ''fale'' in the [[Manu'a]] island group, showing thatched roof and woven ''pola'' blinds, circa 1890 - 1910]]
The completed, domed framework is covered with thatch (''lau'' leaves), which is made by the women. The best quality of thatch is made with the dry leaves of the [[sugarcane]]. If sugarcane leaf was not available, the palm leaves of the coconut tree was used in the same manner.&lt;ref name="nzetc2"/&gt; The long, dry leaves are twisted over a three-foot length of ''lafo'', which are then fastened by a thin strip of the frond of the coconut being threaded through the leaves close up to the ''lafo'' stem.

These sections of thatch are fastened to the outside of the framework of the ''fale'' beginning at the bottom and working up to the apex. They are overlapped, so each section advances the thatching about three inches. This means there is really a double layer of thatch covering the whole house. The sections are fastened to the ''aso'' at each end by ''afa''.

Provided the best quality of thatch is used and it has been truly laid, it will last about seven years. On an ordinary dwelling house, about 3000 sections of thatch are laid.

==''Pola''==
Protection from sun, wind or rain, as well as from prying eyes, was achieved by suspending from the ''fau'' running round the house several of a sort of drop-down Venetian blind, called ''pola.'' The fronds of the coconut tree are plaited into a kind of mat about a foot wide and three feet long. A sufficient number of ''pola'' to reach from the ground to the top of the ''poulalo'' are fastened together with ''afa'' and are tied up or let down as the occasion demands. Usually, one string of these mats covers the space between two ''poulalo'' and so on round the house. They do not last for long, but being quickly made, are soon replaced. They afford ample protection from the elements, and it being possible to let them down in sections; seldom is the whole house is closed up.

==Flooring==
The natural foundations of a ''fale'' site are coral, sand, and lava, with sometimes a few inches of soil in some localities. Drainage is therefore good. The top layers of the flooring are smooth pebbles and stones. When occupied, the house floors are usually covered or partially covered with native mats.

In modern times, concrete is used for flooring.

==Mythology==
[[File:Round Samoan houses with blue roofs, Lepea village with Mt Vaea beyond.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Round ''fale tele'' in [[Lepea]] village, with [[Mount Vaea]] beyond, the burial place of [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]]]
In [[Samoan mythology]], an explanation of why Samoan houses are round is explained in a story about the god [[Tagaloa]], also known as Tagaloalagi (Tagaloa of the Heavens).

Following is the story, as told by Samoan historian Te'o Tuvale in ''An Account of Samoan History up to 1918''.

*During the time of Tagaloalagi, the houses in Samoa varied in shape, and this led to many difficulties for those who wished to have a house built in a certain manner. Each carpenter was proficient in building a house of one particular shape only, and it was sometimes impossible to obtain the services of the carpenter desired. A meeting of all the carpenters in the country was held to try to decide on some uniform shape. The discussion waxed enthusiastic, and as there seemed no prospect of a decision being arrived at, it was decided to call in the services of Tagaloalagi. After considering the matter, he pointed to the dome of Heaven and to the horizon and he decreed that in future, all houses built would be of that shape, and this explains why all the ends of Samoan houses are as the shape of the heavens extending down to the horizon.&lt;ref name=tp/&gt;

An important tree in Samoan architecture is the coconut palm. In Samoan mythology, the first coconut tree is told in a legend called [[Sina and the Eel]].

'''Asa Koma''' ("Red Hill") is an [[archaeological site]] in [[Djibouti]].

==Overview==
Asa Koma is an inland lake area on the Gobaad Plain. Pottery predating the mid-2nd millennium BC has been found at the site.{{When|date=July 2016}} The ware is characterized by punctate and incision geometric designs, which bear a similarity to the Sabir culture phase 1 ceramics from Ma'layba in [[Southern Arabia]].&lt;ref name="Ohvah"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walter Raunig|first1=Steffen Wenig|title=Afrikas Horn|date=2005|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=3447051752|page=439|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=JpNY7VPn1WUC|accessdate=7 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, ceramics like some of the pottery from Sihi on the Saudi coast and Subr on the Yemeni littoral have been found here.&lt;ref name="Iuoni"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Istituto universitario orientale (Naples, Italy)|title=Annali, Volume 58|date=1998|publisher=Edizione universitarie|page=527|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=zNtiAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long-horned humpless cattle bones have also been discovered at Asa Koma, suggesting that domesticated cattle was present by around 3,500 years ago.&lt;ref name="Connah"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Connah|first1=Graham|title=Forgotten Africa: An Introduction to Its Archaeology|date=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1134403038|page=46|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=ggD1wdQxBOcC|accessdate=7 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Assumption of the Virgin''''', 1475 - 1476, is a large (228.6 x 377.2&amp;nbsp;cm) painting in [[tempera]] on wood panel by [[Francesco Botticini]]. It portrays [[Assumption of the Virgin|Mary's assumption]] and was commissioned as the [[altarpiece]] for [[San Pier Maggiore, Florence|a church]] in [[Florence]] and is now in the [[National Gallery]], London.

[[Image:Francesco Botticini - The Assumption of the Virgin.jpg|thumb|278px|right|''Assumption of the Virgin'']]

The disciples gather around Mary's lily-filled tomb with looks of amazement. There are [[donor portrait]]s of [[Matteo Palmieri]], who commissioned the work, kneeling on the left, and his wife on the right. In Heaven above, surrounded by the [[Christian angelic hierarchy|nine choirs of angels]], [[Jesus]] raises his hand in blessing to his kneeling mother.

Among the lesser angels around Jesus and Mary are [[saints]]. Together with Palmieri's poem ''La città di vita'', this mixing of saints with angels raised questions about the orthodoxy of the donor Palmieri, and possibly that of the painter Botticini himself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/francesco-botticini-the-assumption-of-the-virgin Francesco Botticini, The Assumption of the Virgin; NG1126, The National Gallery, London]&lt;/ref&gt;

The major [[effects of the automobile on societies]] include the development of diverse customs and [[tradition]]s.
[[Image:Januaristormens förödelse.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Car accident omen]]

Some drivers believe that a new car is in greater danger than a used car of getting into an accident or having a collision.{{why|date=April 2018}} Some drivers will leave change under their seats. Others use one coin to scratch the car, based on the (false) belief that since the car is new and nothing has happened to it yet, the chances of something bad happening to the car is greater when compared to a used car which already has its fair share of dents and scratches. In hopes of preventing a high damaging accident, they will place a small nick or scratch on the car in an area where it will not be seen. The inside of the wheel well is one commonly scratched area.{{cnl|date=April 2018}}

There are also a few practices associated with graduations. In the days leading up to a graduation, some drivers (and in some cases friends of the driver) will write on the car windows with washable paint. The messages usually congratulate the driver of the car and list the driver’s school and year of graduation. After graduating from high school or college, some drivers choose to hang their tassel from the rearview mirror.{{cnl|date=April 2018}}

Some people throw change under a bed in hopes of bringing good luck to the new home. Change is known world wide as a good luck charm.{{cnl|date=April 2018}}
[[Image:Mourning Car.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Mourning Car decked with flags]]

==Religious==

There are also religious acts that are associated with automobiles. This can include getting the car blessed by a cleric or placing an object of religious significance inside the car.

A predominately [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] practice is to place a medal of [[Saint Christopher]], the patron saint of truck drivers and travelers in general,&lt;ref&gt;[http://saints.sqpn.com/saint-christopher/ ''“Saint Christopher“''] Saints.SQPN.com. (Accessed 20/12/14)&lt;/ref&gt; inside the car.  Usually, the driver will have this medal blessed by a priest.  An ancient legend, mentioned by [[Erasmus]] in the ''[[Praise of Folly]]'', holds that those who see an image of Saint Christopher cannot die through misadventure during that day.  Not surprisingly,  images of Saint Christopher became popular automobile accessories.  Through the presence of the medal, the driver is asking the Saint to pray on his or her behalf for a safe and uneventful journey.

A somewhat more sombre purpose originally stood behind the familiar [[Depiction of Jesus|plastic Jesus]] that some Christians have mounted on their dashboards.  The original plastic Jesus was circulated by the [[Sacred Heart Auto League]], founded in 1955 by Father Gregory Bezy, [[Priests of the Sacred Heart|SCJ]].  This devotional society placed the traditional Roman Catholic figure of Jesus displaying his [[Sacred Heart]] on the dashboard.  Father Bezy was moved to do this as a "practical answer to what he considered the ever-increasing dangers of our overcrowded streets and highways."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shl.org/site/PageServer?pagename=AutoLeague&amp;JServSessionIdr005=5jpwoj3pk1.app2a Sacred Heart Auto League], official site. (Accessed 8/12/06)&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, in the event of a fatal accident, Father Bezy hoped that the last thing the riders would see would be the image of Jesus, and as such face Eternity with faith and contrition.

The plastic dashboard Jesus proved popular among non-Catholic Christians as well.  The figure is well known enough to have inspired a [[folk song]] ''Plastic Jesus'', originally attributed to [[Ed Rush]] and [[George Cromarty]], which has acquired many anonymous folk variants.  One frequent set of verses has it open:

:''I don't care if it rains or freezes&lt;br&gt;Long as I got my Plastic Jesus&lt;br&gt;Riding on the dashboard of my car.''
:''Through my trials and tribulations&lt;br&gt;And my travels through the nations&lt;br&gt;With my Plastic Jesus I'll go far.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guntheranderson.com/v/data/plastic0.htm ''Plastic Jesus''] lyrics and chords. (Accessed 8/12/06)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Catholics will also hang [[rosary beads]] from their rearview mirror.

Catholics and other Christians may also hang crosses or [[crucifix]]es from the rearview mirror.

==Cars for special occasions==
[[Image:Cadillac Fleetwood Wedding.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Wedding Transport]]
Cars are often decorated, and have wishes written on them, and various streamers or trailing objects attached, in celebrations of [[wedding]]s and [[graduation]]s.

[[Image:Cadillac Fleetwood hearse 1990s.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Hearse]]
[[Image:Limosin vid Keybar - Avenyn - i Göteborg, 11 aug 2006.JPG|right|thumb|180px|Limousine]]
A frequent [[wedding tradition]] in the United States involves the decoration of the vehicle the bride and groom drive take at the conclusion of the wedding ceremony.  Typically, various ribbons and streamers are attached, and words written upon the surface of the vehicle, and often [[tin can]]s are attached to its fenders or bumpers by strings to serve as noisemakers.  [[Jan Brunvand]]'s ''American Folklore: An Encyclopedia'' speculates that the decoration of the car and its equipment with noisemakers may perpetuate the [[Charivari|shivaree]], a custom in which newlyweds were given a noisy serenade; when [[honeymoon]] travel became a custom, it made a traditional local shivaree impractical, so the vehicle is given a noisy sendoff instead.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Brunvand, ''American Folklore: An Encyclopedia'' (Garland, 1988) {{ISBN|0-8153-3350-1}}. ("Weddings")&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cars are used chiefly for special occasions and social rituals, such as [[limousines]].

==Truck drivers and taxicab drivers==
[[Image:LKWs.gif|left|thumb|180px|Trucks and Truck Drivers]]
[[Image:CB-Handfunkgeraet.jpg|right|thumb|180px|CB Radio]]
Various professions revolving around motor vehicles acquire a folklore of their own.  [[Truck driver]]s, since they tend to work in isolation, tend to develop a social network of their own.  They circulate a number of [[tall tale]]s that relate generally to their profession, usually involving the outwitting of [[state police]] and other traffic or tax authorities.  They also create an elaborate body of customs and lore surrounding the use of [[citizen's band radio]], with its own jargon and "[[pseudonym|handles]]", which came to national notice in the 1970s.  A widespread bit of popular folklore circulated among other motorists that truck drivers knew which [[restaurant]]s to patronize and which to avoid, so eateries that were obviously frequented by truck drivers were esteemed by the general public.  With the arise of national restaurant chains, this bit of folklore is fading.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Brunvand, ''American Folklore: An Encyclopedia'' (Garland, 1988) {{ISBN|0-8153-3350-1}}. ("Truck drivers")&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar folklore surrounds [[taxicab]] drivers, involving the tales they tell among each other, and the tales that circulate about them.
[[Image:Checker.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Taxicab]]

==Car coining==

There is a practice in New Jersey and New York of tossing a few coins onto the floor of a newly purchased car as a sign of good luck. This practice originated as a practical one.  Because of the area's many toll roads, many drivers would carry change in their cars.  The friends and family of the new car owner would throw coins onto the floor of the new car so if the driver ever ran out of his own money, he could always reach down and find some extra money on the floor.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.churchill.com/car-insurance/tips/driving-rituals&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ben Singkol''''' is a 2001 novel written by [[Filipino National Artist]] [[F. Sionil José]]. It is about Benjamin "Ben" Singkol, who is described as “perhaps the most interesting character” created by the author. Based on José's novel, Singkol is a renowned novelist who wrote the book entitled "''Pain''", an [[autobiography]] written during the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines]]. Through the fictional novel Singkol recalled the hardships experienced by the Filipinos during the occupation. Singkol was described to be a coward, a "''supot''" or an [[circumcision|uncircumcised]] [[Men in the Philippines|man]] who did not only run away from such a “[[rites of passage|ritual of manhood]]” but also evaded his “[[Defensive fighting position|foxhole]] in [[Bataan]] when the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese soldiers]] were closing in”. Singkol was a “runner” or “evader” throughout much of his lifetime, while being haunted by the “poverty of his boyhood” and of the “treachery that he may have committed” in the past. In 1982, Singkol began receiving letters from a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] named Haruko Kitamura.&lt;ref name=KBC&gt;[http://www.kabayancentral.com/book/others/mb8845321.html "Ben Singkol" by F.

'''Bespoke tailoring''' {{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Bespoke.ogg|b|i|ˈ|s|p|oʊ|k}} is clothing made to an individual buyer's specifications by a [[tailor]]. 

==Clothing==

===Meaning of the term===
The word ''[[bespoke]]'' is derived from the verb "bespeak", to speak for something, in the specialised meaning "to give order for it to be made".&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Nathan (1756). ''An Universal Etymological English Dictionary''. R. Ware.&lt;/ref&gt; The term bespoke in fashion is reserved for individually patterned and crafted men's clothing, analogous to women's [[haute couture]],&lt;ref&gt;''Art of Textile Designing''. Global Media. {{ISBN|81-89940-03-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast with mass-manufactured [[ready-to-wear]] (also called off-the-peg or off-the-rack). The term originated from [[Savile Row]], a street in London considered the "Golden Mile of tailoring".&lt;ref name=Norton&gt;{{cite web|last=Norton|first=Kate|title=Savile Row Never Goes Out of Style|url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2006-10-31/savile-row-never-goes-out-of-stylebusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice|work=Bloomberg Businessweek|accessdate=14 December 2013|date=31 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bespoke clothing is traditionally cut from a pattern drafted from scratch for the customer, and so differs from [[ready-to-wear]], which is factory made in finished condition and standardised sizes, and from [[made to measure]], which is produced to order from an adjusted block pattern. The opposition of terms did not initially imply that a bespoke garment was necessarily well built, but since the development of ready-to-wear in the beginning of the twentieth century,&lt;ref&gt;Ugolini, Laura (2003). ''Men and Menswear: Sartorial Consumption in Britain 1880–1939'', p. 181. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. {{ISBN|0-7546-0384-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; bespoke clothing is now more expensive and is generally accompanied by a high quality of construction.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;In article published in ''[[Textile History]]'' (Volume 34, Number 2, November 2003 , pp. 192–213. ''Ready-to-wear or Made-to-measure? Consumer Choice in the British Menswear Trade'') Laura Ugolini concluded that "interested and well-informed male consumers generally preferred to buy bespoke suits: while usually more expensive than their ready-made counterparts, these were also perceived to be better quality, better looking, and better value, and therefore most likely to enhance the wearer's sense of self-worth as a manly, discerning and successful consumer".&lt;/ref&gt;

While the distinction conferred by haute couture is protected by law in France,&lt;ref group="n"&gt;A certain number of formal criteria, including the design for private customers with one or more fittings, must be met for a fashion house to use the label and a list of eligible houses is made official every year by the French Ministry of Industry.&lt;/ref&gt; the British [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] has ruled it is a fair practice to use the term "bespoke" for products that do not fully incorporate traditional construction methods.&lt;ref name="Cockroft"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2149810/Savile-Row-tailors-lose-fight-to-preserve-the-term-bespoke.html |first=Lucy| last=Cockroft| title=Savile Row tailors lose fight to preserve the term bespoke|work = The Telegraph |date=2008-06-19 |accessdate=2008-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Savile Row Bespoke Association]], a trade group of traditional tailors, disagrees.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;The tailor Richard Anderson wrote an article in the Telegraph to explain that "the ASA has got the ruling wrong" ({{cite web
|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2151888/Savile-Row-tailor-Richard-Anderson-bespoke-must-mean-bespoke.html|title=Savile Row tailor Richard Anderson: bespoke must mean bespoke |accessdate=2008-10-10|first=Richard|last=Anderson|date=2008-06-18|work=The Telegraph}}).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sim"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0ea5cbf6-4eed-11dd-ba7c-000077b07658.html|title=The b-word: not cut and dried|accessdate=2008-10-10 |first=Josh|last=Sim|date=2008-07-12|work=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compared to made-to-measure===
Between the extremes of bespoke and ready-to-wear, there has existed since the end of the 19th century&lt;ref group="n"&gt;In 1895, the [[Leeds]] Factory Clothing Co. veered between calling itself "manufacturing clothiers" and "bespoke tailors" (''cf.'' {{cite book
|author     = Benson, John
|year       = 2003
|title      = A Nation of Shopkeepers: Five Centuries of British Retailing
|publisher  = Houghton Mifflin Cookbooks
|isbn       = 1-86064-708-1
|page       = 102
}}).&lt;/ref&gt; a "grey area of garments for which the customer was measured, but that were then made up to the closest standard size, often, but by no means always, in a factory."&lt;ref&gt;Benson, John (2003). ''A Nation of Shopkeepers: Five Centuries of British Retailing'', p.102. I.B.Tauris. {{ISBN|1-86064-708-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction made here is between bespoke, created without use of a pre-existing pattern, and [[made to measure]], which alters a standard-sized pattern to fit the customer.&lt;ref name="Norton"/&gt; Technological change makes this distinction more subtle, since fittings are increasingly required for   made-to-measure. A bespoke service may require an individually-cut pattern, which is then kept should further suits be required;    made-to-measure measurements are often stored on a computer. Even hand-work, often cited as a benchmark of bespoke, is now increasingly found in made-to-measure garments, while machine-making plays some part in the creation of most bespoke suits. With a bespoke suit, a pattern is designed and made from scratch based on the client's measurements, often from 20+ measurements involving multiple fittings, and takes considerably longer to produce than a made-to-measure garment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sharpsense.ca/blogs/style-guide/made-to-measure-vs-bespoke-vs-off-the-rack |title=Made to Measure vs Bespoke vs Off the Rack |publisher=sharpsense.ca |accessdate=2017-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This ensures a precise fit, particularly in the shoulders as well as the posture areas. This [[custom-fit|custom fit]] is handy for clients with short or long necks, high or low shoulders, excess girth, high hips, large or flat seats, and more. Made-to-measure cannot adjust for these shapes and slopes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://joeydimz.com/bespoke |title=Bespoke |publisher=joeydimz.com |accessdate=2017-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, new technologies have allowed for bespoke garments to be made with [[lean manufacturing]] practices and digital patterning, making new patterns within minutes and fully bespoke garments in hours, at a price point similar to made to measure or even [[mass production]].

===Advertising Standards Authority ruling===
In June 2008, the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] (ASA), a British advertising regulator, ruled that an advertisement describing a suit "put into a 'working-frame' where it would be cut and sewn by machine"&lt;ref name="Asa"&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.asa.org.uk/asa/adjudications/Public/TF_ADJ_44555.htm

 |archivedate=2008-11-22 
 |df= 
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; as a "bespoke suit uniquely made according to your personal measurements &amp; specification"&lt;ref name="Asa"/&gt; was not breaching the Authority's self-proclaimed advertising codes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; notably the truthfulness rule,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |title=The CAP Code: truthfulness rule

 |archivedate=2008-09-15 
 |df= 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; because the use of the term bespoke was not deemed likely to confuse. The ruling was significant in formalising a less traditional definition of bespoke clothing, even though the older distinction with made-to-measure was recognised.

The ruling cited the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' definition of bespoke as "made to order", and considered that despite the fact a bespoke suit was "fully hand-made and the pattern cut from scratch, with an intermediary baste stage which involved a first fitting so that adjustments could be made to a half-made suit",&lt;ref name="Asa"/&gt; while a suit made-to-measure "would be cut, usually by machine, from an existing pattern, and adjusted according to the customer's measurements",&lt;ref name="Asa"/&gt; "both fully bespoke and made-to-measure suits were "made to order" in that they were made to the customer's precise measurements and specifications, unlike off-the-peg suits".&lt;ref name="Asa"/&gt;

Some, such as the etymologist [[Michael Quinion]], considered the ruling showed that "the historic term of art had moved on".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-bes4.htm |title= Bespoke|accessdate=2008-10-09 |first=Michael |last=Quinion |date= 2008-09-13| work=World Wide Words}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some others concluded that "bespoke tailoring has traditionally, if unofficially, meant something more than the dictionary definition allows"&lt;ref name="Sim"/&gt; and that the ASA "took a rather ignorant decision to declare that there is no difference between bespoke and made-to-measure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Black Grace''' is an internationally touring [[modern dance]] [[dance company|company]], formed in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]] in 1995. [[Neil Ieremia]], the group's founder and choreographer, draws on [[Māori people|Māori]] and [[Pacific Islander]] indigenous dance, as well as modern dance and [[hip hop]].&lt;ref name="Temin"/&gt; Ieremia graduated from the Auckland Performing Arts School and joined the Douglas Wright Dance Company, the leading New Zealand contemporary-dance company at the time. However, the founding members, such as Sam Fuataga and Sean MacDonald, initially had more experience with sports such as rugby, basketball and running than with dance. Performances remain infused with athleticism and may occasionally include a bit of whimsy that is less common in those of other troupes. In ''Human Language'', as the female dancers dance before them, the male dancers inflate toy balloons and look upward in mimicry of courting behavior of certain bird species.&lt;ref name="La Rocco"&gt;{{cite news | last = LA ROCCO | first = CLAUDIA | title = Muscular Men With Balloons and a Bunny | work = The New York Times | publisher = The New York Times Company | date = 20 September 2005 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/20/arts/dance/20vict.html | accessdate = 2008-04-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coming from a story-telling tradition called ''slap dancing'' that includes speaking, singing and slapping their bodies, Ieremia incorporates these elements in his choreography. Musical accompaniment includes Samoan indigenous music, Bach and hip hop.&lt;ref name="Temin"&gt;{{cite news   | last = Temin  | first = Christine  | title = Black Grace troupe melds Maori culture and modern dance  | work = The Boston Globe  | publisher = Globe Newspaper Company  | date = 12 August 2004  | url = http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2004/08/12/black_grace_troupe_melds_maori_culture_and_modern_dance/?page=full  | accessdate = 2008-04-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the foremost contemporary dance company in New Zealand,&lt;ref name="O’Sullivan"/&gt; the company has toured extensively in that country, as well as the [[Netherlands]], and [[North America]]. Their first appearance in the United States in August 2004 at the [[Jacob's Pillow]] Dance Festival in [[New York City]] was well received. By the end of a week of performances, they were performing before "vociferously enthusiastic, soldout houses."&lt;ref name="Dunning"&gt;{{cite news | last = DUNNING | first = JENNIFER | title = A Maori-Modern Fusion Takes a New York Stage | work = The New York Times | publisher = The New York Times Company | date = 15 September 2005 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/15/arts/dance/15grac.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin | accessdate = 2008-04-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Black Grace performed at the World Expo, [[Aichi]] and [[Tokyo]].&lt;ref name="O’Sullivan"/&gt; A documentary on the group, ''Black Grace: From Cannon's Creek to Jacob's Pillow'', premiered 21 June 2007 on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]].&lt;ref name="O’Sullivan"&gt;{{cite web  | last = O’Sullivan  | first = Aileen  | authorlink =  |author2=Toby Mills  | title = Black Grace: From Cannon’s Creek to Jacob’s Pillow  | publisher = Seannachie Productions and Tawera Productions  | date = 21 June 2007  | url = https://www.pbs.org/blackgrace/  | accessdate = 2008-04-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2008, Black Grace gave two forty-minute performances before more than 10,000 people at [[WOMADelaide]] in southern Australia. An all-male company, four guest female dancers performed with six males in its eleven city 2008 tour of North America.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite news| last = Smith| first = Craig| title = Black Grace notes| work = The Santa Fe New Mexican| publisher = The New Mexican, Inc.| date = 2008-03-27| url = http://www.santafenewmexican.com/Pasatiempo/Black-Grace-notes| archive-url = https://archive.is/20080517003216/http://www.santafenewmexican.com/Pasatiempo/Black-Grace-notes| dead-url = yes| archive-date = 2008-05-17| accessdate = 2008-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2008, the members are variously of Māori, Pacific Island, New Zealand and Australian descent. MacDonald and Ieremia are the only founding members that remain in the troupe.

According to Ieremia, a New Zealander of [[Samoa]]n ancestry, the term ''black'' in the company name refers to  ''courage'' in the New Zealand Māori/Pacific Islander argot of the 1980s. ''Grace'' is a quality that he admires and to which he aspires.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;

A '''Breton lai''', also known as a '''narrative lay''' or simply a '''lay''', is a form of medieval [[Old French|French]] and English romance literature. Lais are short (typically 600–1000 lines), [[rhyme]]d tales of love and [[chivalry]], often involving supernatural and fairy-world Celtic motifs. The word "lay" or "lai" is thought to be derived from the Old High German and/or Old Middle German ''leich'', which means play, melody, or song,&lt;ref&gt;"lay, n.4." The Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd ed. 1989. OED Online. Oxford UP. 21 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; or as suggested by [[Jack Zipes]] in ''The Oxford Companion to Fairy Tales'', the Irish word ''laid'' (song).&lt;ref "Z62&gt;Zipes, 62&lt;/ref&gt;

Zipes writes that Arthurian legends may have been brought from Wales, Cornwall and Ireland to Brittany;  on the continent the songs were performed in various places by harpists, minstrels, storytellers.&lt;ref name= "Z62"&gt;Zipes, Jack, ''The Oxford Companion to Fairytales''. Oxford UP. 2009 62-63&lt;/ref&gt; Zipes reports the earliest recorded lay is Robert Biker's Lai du Cor, dating to the mid- to late-12th century.&lt;ref name= "Z62"/&gt;

The earliest of the Breton lais to survive is probably [[The Lais of Marie de France]], thought to have been composed in the 1170s by [[Marie de France]], a French poet writing in England at Henry II's court between the late 12th and early 13th centuries.&lt;ref name= "Z62"/&gt; From descriptions in Marie's lais, and in several anonymous Old French lais of the 13th century, we know of earlier lais of Celtic origin, perhaps more lyrical in style, sung by [[Brittany|Breton]] [[minstrel]]s. It is believed that these Breton lyrical lais, none of which has survived, were introduced by a summary narrative setting the scene for a song, and that these summaries became the basis for the narrative lais.

The earliest written Breton lais were composed in a variety of [[Old French]] dialects, and some half dozen lais are known to have been composed in [[Middle English]] in the 13th and 14th centuries by various English authors.&lt;ref&gt;Claire Vial, "The Middle English Breton Lays and the Mists of Origin", in ''Palimpsests and the Literary Imagination of Medieval England'', eds. Leo Carruthers, Raeleen Chai-Elsholz, Tatjana Silec. New York: Palgrave, 2011. 175-91.&lt;/ref&gt;

Breton lais may have inspired [[Chrétien de Troyes]], and likely were responsible for spreading Celtic and [[Fairy|fairy-lore]] into Continental Europe. An example of a 14th-century Breton lai has the king of the [[fairies]] carrying away a wife to the land of fairy.&lt;ref name= "Z62"/&gt;

==Old French Lais==
* [[The Lais of Marie de France]] — twelve canonical lais generally accepted as those of Marie de France.
* The so-called [[:Category:Anonymous lais|Anonymous Lais]] — eleven lais of disputed authorship.  While these lais are occasionally interspersed with the Marian lais in Medieval manuscripts, scholars do not agree that these lais were actually written by Marie.
* Several lais are known only in Old Norse translation, translated into [[Old Norwegian]] prose in the thirteenth century, where they were known as the ''[[Strengleikar]]''. These are ''[[Guruns ljóð]]'', ''[[Ricar hinn gamli]]'', ''[[Tveggia elskanda strengleikr]]'', and ''[[Strandarljóð]]'' ('The Lay of the Beach'), which gives a detailed description of [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]]'s commissioning of what appears to be a lyric lai to commemorate a period spent at [[Barfleur]].&lt;ref&gt;''Strengleikar: An Old Norse Translation of Twenty-one Old French Lais'', ed. and trans. by Robert Cook and Mattias Tveitane, Norrøne tekster, 3 (Oslo: Norsk historisk kjeldeskrift-institutt, 1979).&lt;/ref&gt;

*CTBUH conferred a new "Global icon award" on 25 October 2010, the first recipient of this award was [[Burj Khalifa]].&lt;ref name="ctbuh.org"&gt;{{ cite web | title = Burj Khalifa won "Global Icon" Award | publisher = Council on Tall Buildings And Urban Habitate | url = http://www.ctbuh.org/Events/Awards/2010Awards/2010AwardsDinner/tabid/1710/language/en-US/Default.aspx | accessdate = 2010-11-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The awards committee selects awards from each category, while the Best Tall Building Overall is selected from the four regional winners. Initially only the special awards such as The Lynn S. Beedle Lifetime Achievement Award, and Fazlur Khan Lifetime Achievement Medal were given. In 2007 the CTBUH started awarding the skyscraper awards and in 2012 added a new award (Innovation Award). In 2013 a new 10 Year Award was added. In 2014 the Urban Habitat and Performance awards were issued for the first time.

==Awards Criteria==

The CTBUH uses the following award criteria for skyscrapers.&lt;ref name="criteria"/&gt;

*The project must be completed and occupied (topped out architecturally, fully clad, and at least partially occupied), no earlier than 1 January of the previous year, and no later than 1 October of the current awards year.
*The project advanced architectural form, structure, building systems, sustainable design strategies, and provides life safety for its occupants.
*The project must exhibited sustainable qualities at a broadest level.
*The project must have achieved a high standard of excellence and quality.
*The site planning and response to its immediate context must ensure rich and meaningful urban environments.
*The contributions of the project should be generally consistent with the values and mission of the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH).

The criteria for the Innovation Award:&lt;ref name="criteria"/&gt;

*Demonstrate a specific area of innovation within design or construction.
*Should be applicable to other tall building projects.
*Single innovative element (single project can be nominated multiple times for different innovations)
*Building can also be submitted for Best Tall Building Award

The criteria for the 10 Year Award:&lt;ref name="criteria"/&gt;

*Demonstrate successful performance over time.
*Must have been completed between 10–12 years since the current award year (In the inaugural year submissions of buildings completed between 10–15 years since the current award year will be considered).

The criteria for The Lynn S. Beedle Lifetime Achievement Award:&lt;ref name="criteria"/&gt;

*The award recognizes an individual who has made extraordinary contributions to the advancement of tall building and the urban environment during his or her professional career.
*The candidate may be from any area of specialization, including, but not limited to: architecture, structure, building systems, construction, academia, planning, development or management.
*The contributions of the award recipient should be generally consistent with the values and mission of the CTBUH and its founder, Dr. Lynn S. Beedle.
*The award is not intended to be awarded posthumously, although it may be so awarded in some cases.

The criteria for Fazlur Khan Lifetime Achievement Medal:&lt;ref name="criteria"/&gt;

*The award recognizes an individual for his/her demonstrated excellence in technical design and/or research that has made a significant contribution to a discipline for the design of tall buildings and the built urban environment.
*The candidate may or may not be a member of the Council.
*The personal attributes of the award recipient should be of high professional integrity and individual's contributions generally be consistent with the mission of the CTBUH.

The Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat bestowed a new award for Burj Khalifa at its annual "Best Tall Buildings Awards Ceremony" on 25 October 2010 when Burj Khalifa honored as first recipient of CTBUH's new Tall Building "Global Icon" Award. According to CTBUH the new "Global Icon" award recognizes those very special supertall skyscrapers that make a profound impact, not only on the local or regional context, but on the genre of tall buildings globally. Which is innovative in planning, design and execution, the building must have influenced and re-shaped the field of tall building architecture, engineering, and urban planning. It is intended that the award will only be conferred on an occasional basis, when merited by an exceptional project perhaps every ten or fifteen years.&lt;ref name="ctbuh.org"/&gt;

Former CTBUH Awards Chair Gordon Gill, of Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture said:

"There was discussion amongst members of the jury that the existing 'Best Tall Building of the Year' award was not really appropriate for the Burj khalifa. We are talking about a building here that has changed the landscape of what is possible in architecture a building that became internationally recognized as an icon long before it was even completed. 'Building of the Century' was thought a more appropriate title for it."&lt;ref name="ctbuh.org"/&gt;

The '''creative class''' is a posited [[social class|socioeconomic class]] identified by American economist and social scientist [[Richard Florida]], a professor and head of the Martin Prosperity Institute at the [[Rotman School of Management]] at the [[University of Toronto]]. According to Florida, the creative class are a key driving force for economic development of [[post-industrial]] [[cities]] in the [[United States]].

==Overview==
Florida describes the creative class as comprising 40 million workers (about 30 percent of the U.S. workforce). He breaks the class into two broad sections, derived from [[Standard Occupational Classification System]] codes:
* Super-creative core: This group comprises about 12 percent of all U.S. jobs. It includes a wide range of occupations (e.g. science, engineering, education, [[computer programming]], research), with arts, design, and media workers forming a small subset. Florida considers those belonging to this group to "fully engage in the creative process" (2002, p.&amp;nbsp;69). The Super-Creative Core is considered innovative, creating commercial products and consumer goods. The primary job function of its members is to be creative and innovative. "Along with problem solving, their work may entail problem finding" (Florida, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;69).
* Creative [[professional]]s: These professionals are the classic [[Knowledge workers|knowledge-based workers]] and include those working in healthcare, business and finance, the legal sector, and education. They "draw on complex bodies of knowledge to solve specific problems" using higher degrees of education to do so (Florida, 2002).

In addition to these two main groups of creative people, the usually much smaller group of [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]]s is also included in the creative class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Florida|first1=Richard|title=Bohemia and Economic Geography|journal=Journal of Economic Geography|date=2002|volume=2|pages=55–71|doi=10.1093/jeg/2.1.55|url=http://creativeclass.com/rfcgdb/articles/6%20Bohemia_and_Economic_Geography.pdf|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2002 study, Florida concluded that the creative class would be the leading force of growth in the economy expected to grow by over 10 million jobs in the next decade, which would in 2012 equal almost 40% of the population.

== Background ==
The social theories advanced by Florida have sparked much debate and discussion. Florida's work proposes that a new or emergent class—or demographic segment made up of knowledge workers, intellectuals and various types of artists—is an ascendant economic force, representing either a major shift away from traditional agriculture- or industry-based economies or a general restructuring into more complex economic hierarchies.

The theses developed by Florida in various publications were drawn from, among other sources, U.S. Census Bureau demographic data, focusing first on economic trends and shifts apparent in major U.S. cities, with later work expanding the focus internationally.

A number of specific cities and regions (including [[California]]'s [[Silicon Valley]], [[Boston]]'s [[Route 128 (Massachusetts)|Route 128]], [[Research Triangle|The Triangle]] in North Carolina, [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Seattle]], [[Bangalore]], [[Dublin]] and [[Sweden]]) have come to be identified with these economic trends. In Florida's publications, the same places are also associated with large Creative Class populations.

Florida argues that the creative class is socially relevant because of its members' ability to spur regional economic growth through innovation (2002).

Walter Grünzweig, professor for American Studies at [[Technical University of Dortmund]], has shown that the origin of the term “creative class” does not lie with Florida, but instead goes back to a passage in [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]'s essay "Power" in his collection ''[[The Conduct of Life]]'' (1860).&lt;ref&gt;Grünzweig, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emerson, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Occupations ==
Florida says that the creative class is a class of workers whose job is to create meaningful new forms (2002). It is composed of scientists and engineers, university professors, poets and architects, and also includes "people in design, education, arts, music and entertainment, whose economic function is to create new ideas, new technology and/or creative content" (Florida, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;8). The designs of this group are seen as broadly transferable and useful. Another sector of the Creative Class includes positions that are [[Knowledge economy|knowledge intensive]]; these usually require a high degree of formal education (Florida, 2002). Examples of workers in this sector are health professionals and business managers, who are considered part of the sub-group called Creative Professionals. Their primary job is to think and create new approaches to problems. [[Creativity]] is becoming more valued in today's global society. Employers see creativity as a channel for self-expression and job satisfaction in their employees. About 38.3 million Americans and 30 percent of the American workforce identify themselves with the creative class. This number has increased by more than 10 percent in the past 20 years.

The creative class is also known for its departure from traditional workplace attire and behavior. Members of the creative class may set their own hours and dress codes in the workplace, often reverting to more relaxed, casual attire instead of business suits and ties. Creative class members may work for themselves and set their own hours, no longer sticking to the 9–5 standard. Independence is also highly regarded among the creative class and expected in the workplace (Florida, 2002).

== The global economy ==
The Creative Class is not a class of workers among many, but a group believed to bring economic growth to countries that can attract its members. The economic benefits conferred by the Creative Class include outcomes in new ideas, high-tech industry and regional growth. Even though the Creative Class has been around for centuries, the U.S. was the first large country to have a Creative Class dealing with information technology, in the 1960s and 1970s. In the 1960s less than five percent of the U.S. population was part of the Creative Class, a number that has risen to 26 percent. Seeing that having a strong Creative Class is vital in today's global economy, Europe is now almost equal with America's numbers for this group. Inter-city competition to attract members of the Creative Class has developed.

Following an empirical study across 90 nations, Rindermann et al. (2009)&lt;ref name="Talent Development &amp; Excellence Vol. 1, No. 1, 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The impact of smart fractions, cognitive ability of politicians and average competence of peoples on social development |journal=International Research Association for Talent Development and Excellence |year=2009 |last=Rindermann |first=Heiner |authorlink=Heiner_Rindermann |last2=Sailer |first2=Michael |last3=Thompson |first3=James |authorlink3=|issn=1869-2885 |format=PDF }}&lt;!--|accessdate=2015-06-15 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; argued that high-ability classes (or smart classes) are responsible for economic growth, stable democratic development, and positively valued political aspects (government effectiveness, rule of law, and liberty).

== Places of high creative class populations ==
Florida's use of census and economic data, presented in works such as ''The Rise of the Creative Class'' (2002), ''Cities and the Creative Class'' (2004), and ''The Flight of the Creative Class'' (2007), as well as ''[[Bobos in Paradise]]'' by David Brooks (whose "bobos" roughly correspond to Florida's creative class), and [https://www.amazon.com/dp/192121502X NEO Power] by [[Ross Honeywill]] (whose NEOs deliver a more sophisticated level of evidence), has shown that cities which attract and retain creative residents prosper, while those that do not stagnate. This research has gained traction in the business community, as well as among politicians and urban planners. Florida and other Creative Class theorists have been invited to meetings of the National Conference of Mayors and numerous economic development committees, such the [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] mayor's [http://www.denvergov.org/economicdevelopment/template328864.asp Task Force on Creative Spaces]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} and [[Michigan]] governor [[Jennifer Granholm]]'s [[Cool Cities Initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.michigan.gov/gov/0,1607,7-168--75516--,00.html|title=Governor Partners with Local Communities to Develop "Cool Cities," Spur Economic Growth|accessdate=2003-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Cities and the Creative Class'', Florida devotes several chapters to discussion of the three main prerequisites of creative cities (though there are many additional qualities which distinguish creative magnets). For a city to attract the Creative Class, he argues, it must possess "the three 'T's": Talent (a highly talented/educated/skilled population), Tolerance (a diverse community, which has a 'live and let live' ethos), and Technology (the technological infrastructure necessary to fuel an entrepreneurial culture). In ''Rise of the Creative Class'', Florida argues that members of the Creative Class value meritocracy, diversity and individuality, and look for these characteristics when they relocate (2002).

As Florida demonstrates in his books, [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[New Orleans]] and [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] are examples of cities which have tried to attract the Creative Class but, in comparison to cities which better exemplify the "three 'T's", have failed. Creative Class workers have sought out cities that better accommodate their cultural, creative, and technological needs, such as  [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]], [[San Francisco]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Seattle]], [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]] and [[Portland, Oregon]]. Florida also notes that [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]] and [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] have the ingredients to be a "leading city in a new economy".

The "Creativity Index" is another tool that Florida uses to describe how members of the Creative Class are attracted to a city. The Creativity Index includes four elements: "the Creative Class share of the workforce; innovation, measured as patents per capita; high tech industry, using the Milken Institute's widely accepted Tech Pole Index…; and diversity, measured by the Gay Index, a reasonable proxy for an area's openness" (2002, pp.&amp;nbsp;244–5). Using this index, Florida rates and ranks cities in terms of innovative high-tech centers, with San Francisco being the highest ranked (2002).

Florida and others have found a strong correlation between those cities and states that provide a more tolerant atmosphere toward culturally unconventional people, such as gays, artists, and musicians (exemplified by Florida's "Gay Index" and "Bohemian Index" developed in ''The Rise of the Creative Class''), and the numbers of Creative Class workers that live and move there (2002).

Research involving the preferences and values of this new socioeconomic class has shown that where people choose to live can no longer be predicted according to conventional industrial theories (such as "people will go to where the jobs/factories are"). Creative workers are no longer bound by physical products, rather working with intellectual products. Their migration to metropolitan urban areas where creative work is available is more due to the attraction of leisure life and community rather than actual work. Although the Creative Class works towards the globalization of progressive and innovative ideas and products, they can also be considered to value local community and local autonomy. Sociologists and urban theorists have noted a gradual and broad shift of values over the past decade. Creative workers are looking for cultural, social, and technological climates in which they feel they can best "be themselves".

"The main assumption underlying this approach is that creative workers seek creative outlets in all aspects of their lives and therefore migrate to cities that actively support their preferred lifestyles" (Donegan et al., 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;181).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Which Indicators Explain Metropolitan Economic Performance Best?

Each year Florida and the Martin Prosperity Institute release the [[Global Creativity Index]], an international study of nations, ranking countries on the 3Ts of economic development - talent, technology, and tolerance. "The GCI is a broad-based measure for advanced economic growth and sustainable prosperity based on the 3Ts of economic development - talent, technology, and tolerance. It rates and ranks 139 nations worldwide on each of these dimensions and on our overall measure of creativity and prosperity" (Florida et al., 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://martinprosperity.org/content/the-global-creativity-index-2015/|title = The Global Creativity Index 2015|date = July 8, 2015|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The GCI takes into account the diversity of geographical locations noting their openness as the means for progressive ideas to prosper. "Tolerance and openness to diversity is part and parcel of the broad cultural shift toward post-materialist values... Tolerance—or, broadly speaking openness to diversity—provides an additional source of economic advantage that works alongside technology and talent" (Florida, 2012, p.&amp;nbsp;233).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Rise of the Creative Class|last = Florida|first = Richard|publisher = |year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Diversity allows these locations to attract creative individuals and therefore stimulate economic growth. The findings from the 2015 GCI measured 139 countries on their creativity and prosperity. Ranked number one on the 2015 GCI is Australia.

Share of Gross National Product spent on Research and Development is constantly raising at world level. Creative activities are growing at a fast pace in most advanced countries.  60% of the products that will be sold in 2030 do not yet exist. Repetitive works are being robotized. The whole world is becoming a "[[Creational Society]]".

==Lifestyle==
The diverse and individualistic lifestyles enjoyed by the Creative Class involve active participation in a variety of experiential activities. Florida (2002) uses the term "Street Level Culture" to define this kind of stimulation. Street Level Culture may include a "teeming blend of cafes, sidewalk musicians, and small galleries and bistros, where it is hard to draw the line between participant and observer, or between creativity and its creators" (p.&amp;nbsp;166). Members of the Creative Class enjoy a wide variety of activities (e.g., traveling, antique shopping, bike riding, and running) that highlight the collective interest in being participants and not spectators (Florida, 2002).

==Criticisms==
Numerous studies have found fault with the logic or empirical claims of Florida's Creative Class theory. This body of critical empirical research demonstrates how the Creative Class thesis, and the associated [[creative city]] policy prescriptions, in fact exacerbate social and economic inequalities in cities in North America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eugene|first=McCann|title=Inequality and Politics in the Creative-City Region: Questions of Livability and State Strategy|journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|year=2007|volume=31|issue=1|pages=188–196|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2427.2007.00713.x|url=http://220.191.210.90:8083/resource/upload/ResourceFiles/20110915102112267.pdf|accessdate=9 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524162004/http://220.191.210.90:8083/resource/upload/ResourceFiles/20110915102112267.pdf|archive-date=2013-05-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zimmerman|first=Jeffrey|title=From brew town to cool town: neoliberalism and the creative city development strategy in Milwaukee|journal=Cities|year=2008|volume=25|issue=4|pages=230–242|doi=10.1016/j.cities.2008.04.006|url=http://www.thecyberhood.net/documents/papers/zimmerman08.pdf|accessdate=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Catungal|first=J.

=== Statistical indices and composition ===
Scholars in the disciplines of economics, geography, sociology, and related social sciences have challenged Florida's conception of the "creative class", particularly for the perceived fuzziness of the concept and the lack of analytical precision.{{sfn|Markusen|2006|pp=1921–1940}}&lt;ref name="Evans, 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Evans|first=G.|title=Creative cities, creative spaces, and urban policy|journal=Urban Studies|year=2009|volume=45|issue=5/6|pages=1003–1040|doi=10.1177/0042098009103853|url=http://www.londonmet.ac.uk/library/m43287_3.pdf|access-date=2013-02-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319103434/http://www.londonmet.ac.uk/library/m43287_3.pdf|archive-date=2013-03-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boren and Young, 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boren|first=T.|author2=C.

Social scientists have also identified problems with the occupational composition of the creative class. Economic geographer Stefan Kratke challenges the inclusion of financial and real estate professionals within the creative class on two accounts: 1) these individuals played a decisive role as the "dealer class" in the [[Financial crisis (2007–present)|ongoing financial crises]], and therefore cannot be considered a basis for sustainable urban and regional economic growth;{{sfn|Kratke|2011|pp=43–46}} and 2) the financial and real estate industries (especially in headquarter cities) are economically significant regional/urban players only because they are largely "reliant on inflows of wealth created by productive activities in other regions."{{sfn|Kratke|2011|p=50}} Moreover, Kratke argues that the "political class" is also ill-suited to be included within creative class, as they are, in many cases, implicated in neoliberal financial deregulation and the rise in highly unstable urban and regional growth regimes{{sfn|Kratke|2011|p=45}} evident through [[real estate bubble]]s across the United States and in other countries. In "Urban Development and the Politics of the Creative Class", Ann Markusen argues that workers qualified as being in the Creative Class have no concept of group identity, nor are they in occupations that are inherently creative.{{sfn|Markusen|2006}} Markusen also notes that the definition of the Creative Class is based largely on educational attainment, suggesting that Florida's indices become insignificant after controlling for [[education]]. Markusen argues that Florida "does not seem to understand the nature of the occupational statistics he uses" and calls for the major occupational groups to be disaggregated.{{sfn|Markusen|2006|pp=1922—1923}} She questions the inclusion of particular occupations within these broad categories such as claim adjusters, funeral directors, tax collectors, yet argues that "[t]hese occupations may indeed be creative, but so too are airplane pilots, ship engineers, millwrights, and tailors – all of whom are uncreative in Florida's tally."{{sfn|Markusen|2006|p=1923}} Moreover, it is questioned whether human creativity can be conflated with education since "[p]eople at all levels of education exercise considerable inventiveness."{{sfn|Markusen|2006|p=1924}}

===Economic growth===

Research shows that economic growth is experienced when the significance of scientifically/technologically and artistically creative workers is taken into account, but this macro-level conclusion can be drawn without Florida's creative class theory, which provides more of an "affirmation of contemporary class relations."{{sfn|Kratke|2011|p=89}} Other scholars have criticized the very basis for Florida's definition of "[[creativity]]" which many argue is conceived of narrowly and is only valued for the potential for financial and [[economic growth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gibson|first=C.|author2=N.

The creative class thesis—and [[Richard Florida]] himself—have been criticized for what appears to be a change in Florida's prognosis for America's ailing [[Rust Belt]] cities. Florida's message was so quickly and enthusiastically adopted by cities because he argued that any city had the potential to become a vibrant, creative city with the right infrastructure investments, policies, and consulting advice.{{sfn|Peck|2005}} A 2009 article, "The Ruse of the Creative Class", questions Florida's costly speaking engagements in struggling industrial cities in which he offered optimistic prognoses&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=MacGillis|first=Alec|title=The Ruse of the Creative Class|url=http://prospect.org/article/ruse-creative-class-0|work=The American Prospect|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;—and his more recent pronouncements that many American cities may never be saved in the wake of the [[Great Recession]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Florida|first=Richard|title=How the Crash Will Reshape America|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2009/03/how-the-crash-will-reshape-america/307293/|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creative class thesis has also drawn criticisms for relying on [[inner city]] [[property development]], [[gentrification]], and urban [[labor markets]] reliant on low-wage [[Service sector|service workers]], particularly in the [[hospitality industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCann|first=E.|title=Inequality and Politics in the Creative City-Region: Questions of Livability and State Strategy|journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|year=2007|volume=31|issue=1|pages=188–196|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2427.2007.00713.x|url=http://220.191.210.90:8083/resource/upload/ResourceFiles/20110915102112267.pdf|access-date=2013-02-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524162004/http://220.191.210.90:8083/resource/upload/ResourceFiles/20110915102112267.pdf|archive-date=2013-05-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Peck|2005}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peck|first=J.|title=Recreative City: Amsterdam, Vehicular Ideas and the Adaptive Spaces of Creativity Policy|journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|year=2012|volume=36|issue=3|pages=462–485|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2427.2011.01071.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Long|2009|pp=210–219}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jakob|first=D.|title=Constructing the creative neighborhood: hopes and limitations of creative city policies in Berlin|journal=City, Culture and Society|year=2010|volume=1|issue=4|pages=193–198|doi=10.1016/j.ccs.2011.01.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zavos|first=Alison|title=A Portrait of East Austin and the Universal Story of Gentrification|url=http://www.featureshoot.com/2012/08/a-portrait-of-east-austin-and-the-universal-story-of-gentrification/|work=Feature Shoot|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Emery|first=Michael|title=East Austin Gentrification|url=http://www.klru.org/austinnow/archives/gentrification/index.php|work=Austin Now|publisher=KLRU|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kirkpatrick|first=Chloe|title=Hipster culture comes at a price in East Austin neighborhood|url=http://www.hilltopviewsonline.com/viewpoints/article_8ef931d8-1713-11e2-a081-001a4bcf6878.html|work=Hilltop Views|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smithson|first=Kate|title=Extreme makeover: gentrification transforms East Austin|url=http://abcnews.go.com/OnCampus/story?id=7399717&amp;page=1|work=ABC News|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Talbot|first=David|title=How Much Tech Can One City Take?|url=http://www.modernluxury.com/san-francisco/story/how-much-tech-can-one-city-take|work=San Francisco Magazine|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Florida has called for service workers' wages to rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cities must strategize to boost service workers' pay|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/02/06/171257463/cities-must-strategize-to-boost-service-workers-pay|work=NPR|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grassroots resistance===

Creative Class Struggle, a Toronto-based collective, has brought these criticisms outside academic circles, challenging Florida's Creative Class theories as well as their widespread adoption into urban policy. The group manages an online clearinghouse for information about creative city strategies and policies, publishes a newsletter and other materials, and works to engage the media and public in critical discussion.&lt;ref name="Creative Class Struggle."&gt;{{cite web|url=http://creativeclassstruggle.wordpress.com|title=Creative Class Struggle.|accessdate=2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, Creative Class Struggle and art magazine ''Fuse'' organized a public forum in Toronto to debate these issues.&lt;ref name="Whyte, Murray.

'''Eve Mosher''' is an American [[environmental art]]ist living and working in [[New York City]]. She is best known for her public art installation ''HighWaterLine'', which premiered in New York City in 2007.  Her predictions about where waters would rise due to climate change were validated by flood levels during [[Hurricane Sandy]] in 2012. Other locations for installations of ''HighWaterLine'' include Miami, Florida, where it was created with the help of volunteers (2013)&lt;ref name=Wild /&gt; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (2014).&lt;ref name=PennState&gt;{{cite news|last=Danahy|first=Anne|title='Sensing Change' in the climate brings together science and art|url=http://news.psu.edu/story/283711/2013/08/08/arts-and-entertainment/sensing-change-climate-brings-together-science-and|accessdate=28 January 2014|newspaper=Penn State News|date=2013-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Leonardo&gt;{{cite web|last=Rogers|first=Hannah Star|title=Sensing Change|publisher=Leonardo Online|year=2013|url=http://leonardo.info/reviews/jan2014/sensing-rogers.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; Installations have been discussed for Dublin, Ireland, and London, England.&lt;ref name=HighWaterLine&gt;{{cite web|title=HighWaterLine: Visualizing Climate Change|url=http://www.highwaterline.org/|accessdate=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Right" /&gt;

==Early works==
Eve Mosher initially worked as a studio artist, creating abstract interpretations of the natural and built environments through drawings, sculptures, and installations. Then, in 2006, she felt a need to do something in response to climate change and began to brainstorm ideas.&lt;ref name="SensingChangeMosher" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Artist&gt;{{cite web|last=Mosher|first=Eve|title=The Artist|url=http://www.highwaterline.org/about/the-artist/|publisher=HighWaterLine|accessdate=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was an Exhibiting Artist at [[Eyebeam (organization)|Eyebeam]] in 2008 and 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Eve Mosher {{!}} eyebeam.org|url = http://www.eyebeam.org/people/eve-mosher|website = www.eyebeam.org|access-date = 2016-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York City, New York===
In 2007 artist Eve S. Mosher created a public art project in Brooklyn and Manhattan that brought the topic of climate change literally to the doorsteps of the city’s residents. Scientists had predicted that water levels in New York, in the event of a "hundred year flood", could rise ten feet above sea level. But with sea levels rising along the East Coast &amp;mdash; a natural phenomenon accelerated by [[climate change]] &amp;mdash; they now projected that what was once considered a 100-year flood could soon happen as often as every 3 to 20 years.&lt;ref name=Sheppard&gt;{{cite news|last=Sheppard|first=Kate|title=Flood, Rebuild, Repeat: Are We Ready for a Superstorm Sandy Every Other Year?|url=http://climatedesk.org/2013/07/flood-rebuild-repeat-are-we-ready-for-a-superstorm-sandy-every-other-year/|accessdate=28 January 2014|newspaper=Mother Jones|date=2013-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eve Mosher used topographic maps, satellite images, and data from NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies at Columbia University, to predict the locations likely to be subject to flooding. Then Mosher walked 70 miles of New York coastline, pushing a "Heavy Hitter" (a baseball field line machine) to draw a 4" blue chalk line on the ground, marking the predicted water levels. In areas where she was unable to draw a line, she marked the high water boundary with illuminated beacons.&lt;ref name=Grist&gt;{{cite news|last=Hanscom|first=Greg|title=Underwater homes: A visual guide to NYC's future floods|url=http://grist.org/cities/2011-10-20-surprise-your-flat-may-soon-be-underwater/|accessdate=27 January 2014|newspaper=Grist.org|date=2011-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The project was completed over a period of six months. Mosher's ''HighWaterLine'' went past low-income housing developments, luxury apartment buildings, power stations, nursing homes, and hospitals.&lt;ref name=Kolbert&gt;{{cite news|last=Kolbert|first=Elizabeth|title=Crossing the Line|url=http://www.newyorker.com/talk/2012/11/12/121112ta_talk_kolbert|accessdate=28 January 2014|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; One observer wrote later, "it was beyond moving to see an artist simplify complex data that typically might seem too abstract to relate to."&lt;ref name=Wild&gt;{{cite journal|last=Doan|first=Abigail|title=HighWaterLine: Visualizing Climate Change with Artist Eve Mosher|journal=The Wild Magazine|date=2013-11-26|url=http://thewildmagazine.com/blog/highwaterline-visualizing-climate-change-with-artist-eve-mosher/|accessdate=28 January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140131031911/http://thewildmagazine.com/blog/highwaterline-visualizing-climate-change-with-artist-eve-mosher/|archivedate=31 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along the way, people came up to her to ask what she was doing, and Mosher talked with them. A significant goal of the project was to engage local people and hear their stories.&lt;ref name="Right" /&gt; [[Heidi Quante]], a creative coordinator with the climate action group 350.org, reported that "Eve really found a new way of teaching people... Her art was so good, she became a magnet. And when people learn by asking rather than being told, they retain the information better."&lt;ref name=Grist /&gt;

Two years later, when [[Hurricane Irene]] approached, areas below Mosher's ''HighWaterLine'' were evacuated. Luckily Irene veered away from the city.&lt;ref name=Grist /&gt; Four years later, Mosher's predictions were strikingly validated when the storm surge from [[Hurricane Sandy]] flooded many of the areas she had traversed.&lt;ref name=Right&gt;{{cite web|last=Mosher|first=Eve|title=I never wanted to be right…|url=http://www.evemosher.com/2012/i-never-wanted-to-be-right/|publisher=Eve Mosher (Blog)|date=2012-10-31|accessdate=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gwarlingo&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aldredge|first=Michelle|title=A Line Made By Flooding – Artist Eve Mosher: "I Never Wanted to Be Right"|journal=Gwarlingo|date=2012-11-16|url=http://www.gwarlingo.com/2012/a-line-made-by-flooding-artist-eve-mosher-i-never-wanted-to-be-right/|accessdate=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Miami, Florida===
In Miami, ''HighWaterLine'' was collaboratively installed after considerable advance planning and work by Eve Mosher, Heidi Quante and volunteers from the community-led Resilient Miami action group. More than 70 different residents marked the line in their own neighborhoods, each passing the field marker to the next person. The result was a 26-mile-long continuous line, created over three days, November 13, 14, and 17, 2013. Mosher intentionally expanded her engagement with the community before and after the project, but the goal of interacting with people continued to be creating conversations and awareness.&lt;ref name=Wild /&gt;

"I really believe that using creativity in taking on the complex challenges of climate change is a way to allow everyone to participate. Putting those tools in the hands of individual community members allows them to go into their own neighborhood and bring their neighbors into the conversation in ways that no one outside of the community can do."&lt;ref name=Wild /&gt;

She has also worked with [[Patricia Watts]] and  [[Amy Lipton]] to develop a "''HighWaterLine'' ACTION GUIDE", to help people locally engage with their communities and develop their own installations of HighWaterLine.&lt;ref name="Wild" /&gt;&lt;ref name=SensingChangeMosher&gt;{{cite web|title=HighWaterLine : Eve Mosher |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/highwaterline|publisher=[[Science History Institute]]|date=2016|accessdate=26 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Marfa&gt;{{cite web|title=Eve Mosher gives HighWaterLine talk on the first anniversary of Hurricane Sandy|url=http://www.marfadialogues.org/news/eve-mosher-gives-highwaterline-talk-on-the-first-anniversary-of-hurricane-sandy/|publisher=Marfa Dialogues / New York|accessdate=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philadelphia, Pennsylvania ===

An installation of ''HighWaterLine'' occurred in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in May 2014.&lt;ref name=PennState /&gt;&lt;ref name=Leonardo /&gt;
Mosher worked with local Philadelphia residents to draw a thick chalk line through four miles of sidewalks and streets in the Kensington, Fishtown and Port Richmond neighborhoods. Philadelphia's ten-foot zone includes numerous industrial and factory sites: flooding would impact a number of [[List of Superfund sites in Pennsylvania|Superfund sites]], polluted locations requiring a long-term response to clean up hazardous material contaminations.&lt;ref name=Newsworks&gt;{{cite news|last=Perez-Luna|first=Elisabeth|title=Vividly illustrating climate change, artist draws a high water line in Philly neighborhoods|url=http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/homepage-feature/item/67687-vividly-illustrating-climate-change-artist-draws-a-high-water-line-in-philly-neighborhoods-|accessdate=8 May 2014|newspaper=Newsworks|date=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unofficial local '''flag and coat of arms of Mayotte''' represents the [[France|French]] [[overseas department]] of '''[[Mayotte]]'''. It consists of a shield with a cloud design, a sideways crescent and flowers in blue and red segments. The supporters of the shield are [[seahorse]]s. The motto, placed in a grey ribbon, reads "RA HACHIRI" – ''We are vigilant'' in [[Maore dialect|Shimaore (Comorian)]].

==Background==
Mayotte is an [[Overseas region]] of [[France]]. The French flag is thus the official flag.

==Flag==
The official '''flag of Mayotte''' is the [[Flag of France|French tricolor]]. The unofficial local flag consists of a white field with the [[archipelago]]'s [[Coat of arms of Mayotte|coat of arms]] below an inscription "MAYOTTE" in red capitals.

'''Fractal art''' is a form of [[algorithmic art]] created by calculating [[fractal]] objects and representing the calculation results as still images, animations, and [[Algorithmic composition|media]]. Fractal art developed from the mid-1980s onwards.&lt;ref name="fgad"&gt;{{cite book |title=Fractal geometry in architecture and design |last=Bovill |first=Carl |year=1996 |publisher=Birkhauser |location=Boston |isbn=0-8176-3795-8 |page=153 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w5ptaiGsac4C |accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a genre of [[computer art]] and [[digital art]] which are part of [[new media art]]. The [[mathematical beauty]] of fractals lies at the intersection of [[generative art]] and [[computer art]].  They combine to produce a type of [[abstract art]].

Fractal art (especially in the western world) is rarely drawn or painted by hand. It is usually created indirectly with the assistance of [[fractal-generating software]], iterating through three phases: setting parameters of appropriate fractal software; executing the possibly lengthy calculation; and evaluating the product. In some cases, other [[graphics software|graphics programs]] are used to further modify the images produced. This is called post-processing. Non-fractal imagery may also be integrated into the artwork.&lt;ref name="mra"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.casperjournal.com/article_bbe58a64-0b86-5e64-8fc5-459eafbe67fb.html |title=Meet Reginald Atkins, mathematical artist |author=Elysia Conner |date=February 25, 2009 |publisher=CasperJournal.com |accessdate=October 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Julia set]] and [[Mandelbrot set]]s can be considered as [[icon]]s of fractal art.&lt;ref name="hema"&gt;{{cite book |title=The heart of mathematics: an invitation to effective thinking |last=Burger |first=Edward B. |author2=Michael P.

It was assumed that fractal art could not have developed without computers because of the [[calculation|calculative]] capabilities they provide.&lt;ref name="dima"&gt;{{cite book |title=Digital Mantras: The languages of abstract and virtual worlds |last=Steven R. |first=Holtzman |year=1995 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=0-262-58143-4 |page=241 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gc5hnRuABy0C |accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fractals are generated by applying [[Iteration|iterative]] methods to solving non-linear equations or [[polynomial equation]]s. Fractals are any of various extremely irregular curves or shapes for which any suitably chosen part is similar in shape to a given larger or smaller part when magnified or reduced to the same size.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fractal Fractal - Definition].

There are many different kinds of fractal images and can be subdivided into several groups. 
* Fractals derived from standard geometry by using iterative transformations on an initial common figure like a straight line (the Cantor dust or the [[Koch snowflake|von Koch curve]]), a triangle (the [[Sierpinski triangle]]), or a cube (the [[Menger sponge]]). The first fractal figures invented near the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries belong to this group.
* IFS ([[iterated function systems]])
* [[Strange attractors]]
* [[Flame fractals|Fractal flame]]
* [[L-system]] fractals
* Fractals created by the iteration of complex [[polynomial]]s:  perhaps the most famous fractals.
* [[Newton fractal]]s, including [[Nova fractal]]s
* [[Quaternionic]] and (recently) hypernionic{{clarify||date=January 2014}} fractals&lt;ref&gt;[http://paulbourke.net/fractals/quatjulia/ Quaternion Julia Fractals]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Fractal terrain]]s generated by random fractal processes&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fractalus.com/fractal-art-faq/faq03.html#3a Fractal Art FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mandelbulb]]s are a kind of three dimensional fractal.

[[Fractal Expressionism]] is a term used to differentiate traditional visual art that incorporates fractal elements such as [[self-similarity]] for example.  Perhaps the best example of fractal expressionism is found in [[Jackson Pollock]]'s dripped patterns.  They have been analysed and found to contain a [[fractal dimension]] which has been attributed to his technique.&lt;ref name="coex"&gt;{{cite book |title=Complexity explained |last=Érdi |first=Péter |authorlink=Péter Érdi|year=2008 |publisher=Springer |isbn=3-540-35777-7 |page=214 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JwgpLvknc8wC |accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==
[[File:Electricsheep-14525.jpg|thumb|Fractal image generated by [[Electric Sheep]]]]
{{main|Fractal-generating software}}
Fractals of all kinds have been used as the basis for digital art and animation. High resolution color graphics became increasingly available at scientific research labs in the mid-1980s.  Scientific forms of art, including fractal art, have developed separately from [[mainstream]] culture.&lt;ref name="ciem"&gt;{{cite book |title=Critical issues in electronic media |last=Penny |first=Simon |year=1995 |publisher=State University of New York Press |isbn=0-7914-2317-4 |pages=81–82 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vzFJnyBjaLMC |accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with 2-dimensional details of fractals, such as the Mandelbrot Set, fractals have found artistic application in fields as varied as texture generation, plant growth simulation and landscape generation.

Fractals are sometimes combined with [[evolutionary algorithms]], either by iteratively choosing good-looking specimens in a set of random variations of a fractal artwork and producing new variations, to avoid dealing with cumbersome or unpredictable parameters, or collectively, as in the [[Electric Sheep]] project, where people use [[fractal flame]]s rendered with [[distributed computing]] as their [[screensaver]] and "rate" the flame they are viewing, influencing the server, which reduces the traits of the undesirables, and increases those of the desirables to produce a computer-generated, community-created piece of art.

Many fractal images are admired because of their perceived [[Principles of art#Harmony|harmony]]. This is typically achieved by the [[pattern]]s which emerge from the [[Principles of art#Balance|balance]] of order and [[Chaos theory|chaos]]. Similar qualities have been described in [[Chinese painting]] and [[Penjing|miniature trees and rockeries]].&lt;ref name="caftc"&gt;{{cite book |title=Chaos, complexity, curriculum and culture |editor1-first=William E. |editor1-last=Doll, Jr |editor2-first=Jayne |editor2-last=Fleener |editor3-first=Donna |editor3-last=Trueit |editor4-first=John |display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=St. Julien |last=Wang |first=Hongyu |chapter=Chinese aesthetics, Fractals and the Tao of Curriculum |year=2005 |publisher=Peter Lang Publishing |location=New York |isbn=978-0-8204-6780-1 |page=301 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fROt7Yjz3xgC |accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
{{main|Fractal landscape}}
The first fractal image that was intended to be a work of art was probably the famous one on the cover of ''[[Scientific American]]'', August 1985. This image showed a [[landscape]] formed from the potential function on the domain outside the (usual) [[Mandelbrot set]]. However, as the potential function grows fast near the boundary of the Mandelbrot set, it was necessary for the creator to let the landscape grow downwards, so that it looked as if the Mandelbrot set was a [[plateau]] atop a mountain with steep sides. The same technique was used a year after in some images in ''[[The Beauty of Fractals]]'' by [[Heinz-Otto Peitgen]] and [[Michael M. Richter]]. They provide a formula to estimate the distance from a point outside the Mandelbrot set to the boundary of the Mandelbrot set (and a similar formula for the Julia sets). Landscapes can, for example, be formed from the distance function for a family of iterations of the form &lt;math&gt;z^{2} + az^{4} + c&lt;/math&gt;.

==Artists==
Notable fractal artists include [[Desmond Paul Henry]], [[Hamid Naderi Yeganeh]] and musician [[Bruno Degazio]].  The British artist [[William Latham (computer scientist)|William Latham]], has used fractal geometry and other computer graphics techniques in his works.&lt;ref name="fpc"&gt;{{cite book |title=Fractals: The Patterns of Chaos |last=Briggs |first=John |authorlink=John Briggs (author) |year=1992 |publisher=Thames and Hudson |location=London |isbn=0-500-27693-5 |page=169 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greg Sams]] has used fractal designs in postcards, T-shirts and textiles. American [[Vicky Brago-Mitchell]] has created fractal art which has appeared in exhibitions and on magazine covers. [[Scott Draves]] is credited with inventing flame fractals. [[Carlos Ginzburg]] has explored fractal art and developed a concept called "homo fractalus" which is based around the idea that the human is the ultimate fractal.&lt;ref name="cagi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/leonardo/v034/34.1ginzburg.html |title=Carlos Ginzburg |year=2001 |work=[[Leonardo (journal)|Leonardo]] |publisher=[[Leonardo,_The_International_Society_of_the_Arts,_Sciences_and_Technology|Leonardo/ISAST]], the International Society for the Arts, Sciences and Technology |accessdate=29 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Merrin Parkers from New Zealand specialises in fractal art.&lt;ref name="hfn"&gt;{{cite book |title=Heaven's fractal net: retrieving lost visions in the humanities, Volume 1 |last=Jackson |first=William Joseph |year=2004 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=0-253-21620-6 |page=116 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U0rJz7FC2z8C |accessdate=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Kerry Mitchell]] wrote a "Fractal Art Manifesto", claiming that&lt;ref name=manifesto&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fractalus.com/info/manifesto.htm |title=The Fractal Art Manifesto |author=Mitchell, Kerry |authorlink=Kerry Mitchell |date= |accessdate=28 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Fractal Art is a subclass of two-dimensional visual art, and is in many respects similar to photography—another art form that was greeted by skepticism upon its arrival. Fractal images typically are manifested as [[Printmaking|prints]], bringing fractal artists into the company of painters, photographers, and printmakers. Fractals exist natively as electronic images. This is a format that traditional visual artists are quickly embracing, bringing them into Fractal Art's digital realm. Generating fractals can be an artistic endeavor, a mathematical pursuit, or just a soothing diversion. However, Fractal Art is clearly distinguished from other digital activities by what it is, and by what it is not.&lt;ref name=manifesto/&gt;}}

According to Mitchell, fractal art is not computerized art, lacking in rules, unpredictable, nor something that any person with access to a computer can do well. Instead, fractal art is expressive, creative, and requires input, effort, and intelligence. Most importantly, "fractal art is simply that which is created by Fractal Artists: ART."&lt;ref name=manifesto/&gt;

More recently, American artist Hal Tenny was hired to design environment in [[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]].

In 1989, fractals were part of the subject matter for an art show called ''Strange Attractors: Signs of Chaos'' at the [[New Museum of Contemporary Art]].&lt;ref name="ciem"/&gt; The show consisted of photographs, installations and sculptures designed to provide greater scientific [[discourse]] to the field which had already captured the public's attention through colourful and intricate computer imagery.

[[File:György Ligeti (1984).jpg|thumb|György Ligeti, 1984]]
'''György Sándor Ligeti''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɪ|g|ə|t|i}}; {{lang-hu|Ligeti György Sándor}}, {{IPA-hu|ˈliɡɛti ˈɟørɟ ˈʃaːndor|pron}}; 28 May 1923&amp;nbsp;– 12 June 2006) was a Hungarian-Austrian [[composer]] of [[contemporary classical music]]. He has been described as "one of the most important avant-garde composers in the latter half of the twentieth century" and "one of the most innovative and influential among progressive figures of his time".&lt;ref&gt;Cummings n.d.&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Transylvania]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], he lived in [[People's Republic of Hungary|Communist Hungary]] before emigrating to [[Austria]] in 1956. He became an Austrian citizen in 1968. In 1973 he became professor of composition at the [[Hochschule für Musik und Theater Hamburg|Hamburg Hochschule für Musik und Theater]], where he worked until retiring in 1989. He died in Vienna in 2006.

Restricted in his musical style by the authorities of Communist Hungary, only when he reached the west in 1956 could Ligeti fully realise his passion for [[avant-garde]] music and develop new compositional techniques. After experimenting with electronic music in Cologne, his breakthrough came with orchestral works such as ''[[Atmosphères]]'', for which he used a technique he later dubbed [[micropolyphony]]. After writing his "anti-anti-opera" ''[[Le Grand Macabre]]'', Ligeti shifted away from [[chromaticism]] and towards [[polyrhythm]] for his later works.

He is best known by the public through the use of his music in [[Soundtrack|film soundtracks]]. Although he did not directly compose any film scores, excerpts of pieces composed by him were taken and adapted for film use. The sound design of [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s films, particularly the music of ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', drew from Ligeti's work and also contained pieces by other classical composers.&lt;!-- Needs name of sound designer/composer --&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===
Ligeti was born in 1923 at Dicsőszentmárton (which was renamed [[Târnăveni]] in 1941), in the [[Romania]]n region of [[Transylvania]], to Dr. Sándor Ligeti and Dr. Ilona Somogyi. His family was [[Hungarians in Romania|Hungarian]] Jewish. He was the grandnephew of the violinist [[Leopold Auer]] and cousin of Hungarian philosopher [[Ágnes Heller]].

Ligeti recalled that his first exposure to languages other than Hungarian came one day while listening to a conversation among the Romanian-speaking town police. Before that he had not known that other languages existed.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;Tusa 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]] with his family when he was six years old. He did not return to the town of his birth until the 1990s. In 1940, [[Northern Transylvania]] was annexed by Hungary following the [[Second Vienna Award]], and Cluj became part of Hungary.

In 1941 Ligeti received his initial musical training at the [[Gheorghe Dima Music Academy|conservatory in Cluj]],&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; and during the summers privately with [[Pál Kadosa]] in [[Budapest]]. In 1944, Ligeti's education was interrupted when he was sent to a [[The Holocaust#Hungary|forced labor brigade]] by the [[Hungary in World War II|Horthy regime]] during events of the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; His brother, age 16, was deported to the [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp]] and both of his parents were sent to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]]. His mother was the only other person to survive in his immediate family.&lt;ref&gt;Steinitz 2003, 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following [[World War II]], Ligeti returned to his studies in Budapest, graduating in 1949 from the [[Franz Liszt Academy of Music]]. He studied under Pál Kadosa, [[Ferenc Farkas]], [[Zoltán Kodály]] and [[Sándor Veress]]. He conducted [[ethnomusicology|ethnomusicological]] research into the [[Hungarian folk music]] of Transylvania. However, after a year he returned to Franz Liszt Academy in Budapest, this time as a teacher of [[harmony]], [[counterpoint]] and [[musical analysis]]. He had secured this position with the help of Kodály, and held it from 1950 to 1956.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; As a young teacher, Ligeti took the unusual step of regularly attending the lectures of an older colleague, the conductor and musicologist [[Lajos Bárdos]]. He was a conservative Christian whose circle represented a safe haven for Ligeti. The composer acknowledged Bardos's help and advice in the prefaces to his two harmony textbooks (1954 and 1956).&lt;ref&gt;Steinitz 2003, 31&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the restrictions of the [[communism|communist]] government, communications between Hungary and the West by then had become difficult, and Ligeti and other artists were effectively cut off from recent developments outside the [[Eastern Bloc]].

===After leaving Hungary===
In December 1956, two months after the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian revolution]] was violently suppressed by the Soviet Army, Ligeti fled to Vienna with his ex-wife Vera Spitz. (They remarried in 1957 and had a son together.)&lt;ref name="Steinitz 2003, 70–73"&gt;Steinitz 2003, 70–73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Publications |first=Europa |date=2003 |title=The International Who's Who 2004 |url=https://books.google.com.my/books?id=sR4Ch1dMe8IC&amp;pg=PA1005&amp;lpg=PA1005&amp;dq=ligeti+international+whos+who&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3bQjk82VoZ&amp;sig=NTyNxUeqHDn9LLR2jJM6zZTy6EE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=ligeti%20international%20whos%20who&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=Psychology Press |page=1005 |isbn=9781857432176 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He would not see Hungary again for fourteen years, when he was invited there to judge a competition in Budapest.&lt;ref&gt;Steinitz 2003, 250.&lt;/ref&gt; On his rushed escape to Vienna, he left most of his Hungarian compositions in Budapest, some of which are now lost. He took only what he considered to be his most important pieces. He later said, "I considered my old music of no interest. I believed in [[twelve-tone]] music!"&lt;ref&gt;Steinitz 2003, 73–74&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually took Austrian citizenship in 1968.&lt;ref name="Steinitz 2003, 70–73"/&gt;
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F004566-0002, Darmstadt, Internationaler Kurs für neue Musik.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|[[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] lecturing at the [[Internationale Ferienkurse für Neue Musik|Internationale Ferienkurse für neue Musik]] in [[Darmstadt]], July 1957]]

A few weeks after arriving in Vienna, Ligeti left for Cologne. There he met several key [[avant-garde]] figures and learned more contemporary musical styles and methods.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; These people included the composers [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] and [[Gottfried Michael Koenig]], both then working on groundbreaking [[electronic music]]. During the summer, he attended the [[Internationale Ferienkurse für Neue Musik]] in [[Darmstadt]]. Ligeti worked in the [[Studio for Electronic Music (WDR)|Cologne Electronic Music Studio]] with Stockhausen and Koenig and was inspired by the sounds he heard there. However, he produced little electronic music of his own, instead concentrating on instrumental works which often contain electronic-sounding [[texture (music)|textures]].

After about three years' working with them, he fell out with the [[Cologne School (music)|Cologne School]],{{Clarify|date=January 2016}}&lt;!--The linked article says this group of composers and performers came to prominence only in the mid-1970s; on the other hand it says that Ligeti was working not with them, but with Stockhausen and Koenig.--&gt; this being too dogmatic{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;!--The quotation from Ligeti does not mention dogmatism.--&gt; and involving much factional in-fighting: "there were {{sic}} a lot of political fighting because different people, like Stockhausen, like Kagel wanted to be first. And I, personally, have no ambition to be first or to be important."&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

Between 1961 and 1971 he was guest professor for composition in Stockholm. In 1972 he became composer-in-residence at [[Stanford University]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gyorgy-ligeti.com/home.php?page=biography,7,1,00,141,00,00,1,47 | title=Biography | accessdate=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973 Ligeti became professor of composition at the [[Hochschule für Musik und Theater Hamburg|Hamburg Hochschule für Musik und Theater]], eventually retiring in 1989. While he was living in Hamburg, his wife Vera remained in Vienna with their son, [[Lukas Ligeti|Lukas]], who later also became a composer.&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;

Invited by [[Walter Fink]], Ligeti was the first composer featured in the annual [[Rheingau Musik Festival#Portraits of living composers|Komponistenporträt]] of the [[Rheingau Musik Festival]] in 1990.&lt;ref name="munchner"&gt;Anon. n.d.(b)&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from his far-reaching interest in different styles of music, from Renaissance to African music, Ligeti was also interested in literature (including the writers [[Lewis Carroll]], [[Jorge Luis Borges]], and [[Franz Kafka]]), painting, architecture, science, and mathematics. He was especially fascinated by the [[fractal|fractal geometry]] of [[Benoit Mandelbrot]] and the writings of [[Douglas Hofstadter]].&lt;ref&gt;Steinitz 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Austrian Chancellor [[Wolfgang Schüssel]] and Art Secretary {{ill|Franz Morak|de}} both paid tribute to Ligeti. His funeral was held at the Vienna Crematorium at the [[Vienna Central Cemetery]], with the Republic of Austria and the Republic of Hungary represented by their respective cultural affairs ministers. The ashes were buried at the cemetery in a grave dedicated to him by the City of Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.n-tv.de/archiv/Gyoergy-Ligeti-ist-tot-article185683.html |title=György Ligety ist tot; Ehrengrab in Wien |accessdate=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was survived by his wife Vera and son [[Lukas Ligeti|Lukas]].&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt; The latter is a composer and percussionist based in the United States.

==Music==
{{See also|List of compositions by György Ligeti}}

===Compositions in Hungary===
Many of Ligeti's earliest works were written for chorus and included settings of folk songs. His largest work in this period was a graduation composition for the [[Budapest Academy of Music|Budapest Academy]], entitled ''Cantata for Youth Festival'', for four vocal soloists, chorus and orchestra. One of his earliest pieces now in the repertoire is his [[Sonata for Solo Cello (Ligeti)|''Cello Sonata'']], a work in two contrasting movements that were written in 1948 and 1953, respectively. It was initially banned by the Soviet-run [[Composer's Union]] and was not performed publicly for a quarter of a century.&lt;ref&gt;Steinitz 2003, 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ligeti's earliest works are often an extension of the musical language of [[Béla Bartók]]. Even his piano cycle ''[[Musica ricercata]]'' (1953), though written according to Ligeti with a "Cartesian" approach, in which he "regarded all the music I knew and loved as being... irrelevant",&lt;ref&gt;Steinitz 2003, 54.&lt;/ref&gt; the piece has been described by one biographer as from a world very close to Bartók's set of piano works, ''[[Mikrokosmos (Bartók)|Mikrokosmos]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Toop 1999, 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Ligeti's set comprises eleven pieces in all. The work is based on a simple restriction: the first piece uses exclusively one pitch A, heard in multiple [[octave]]s, and only at the very end of the piece is a second note, D, heard. The second piece uses three notes (E{{music|sharp}}, F{{music|sharp}}, and G), the third piece uses four, and so on, so that in the final piece all twelve notes of the [[chromatic scale]] are present.

Shortly after its composition, Ligeti arranged six of the movements of ''Musica ricercata'' for [[wind quintet]] under the title 'Six Bagatelles for Wind Quintet'. The Bagatelles were performed first in 1956, but not in their entirety: the last movement was censored by the Soviets for being too 'dangerous'.&lt;ref&gt;Steinitz 2003, 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of Soviet censorship, his most daring works from this period, including ''Musica ricercata'' and his [[String Quartet No. 1 (Ligeti)|String Quartet No. 1 ''Métamorphoses nocturnes'']] (1953–1954), were written for the 'bottom drawer'. Composed of a single movement divided into seventeen contrasting sections linked [[Motif (music)|motivically]],&lt;ref&gt;Steinitz 2003, 63–64&lt;/ref&gt; the First String Quartet is Ligeti's first work to suggest a personal style of composition. The string quartet was not performed until 1958, after he had fled Hungary for Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;Steinitz 2003, 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Compnist Gyorgy Ligeti , tijdens repetitie, Bestanddeelnr 932-8518.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|György Ligeti in 1984]]

===From 1956 to ''Le Grand Macabre''===
Upon arriving in Cologne, Ligeti began to write electronic music alongside [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] and [[Gottfried Michael Koenig]] at the electronic studio of [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|West German Radio (WDR)]]. He completed only two works in this medium, however—the pieces ''Glissandi'' (1957) and ''[[Artikulation (Ligeti)|Artikulation]]'' (1958)—before returning to instrumental music. A third work, originally entitled ''Atmosphères'' but later known as ''Pièce électronique Nr. 3'', was planned, but the technical limitations of the time prevented Ligeti from realizing it completely. It was finally realised in 1996 by the Dutch composers Kees Tazelaar and Johan van Kreij of the [[Institute of Sonology]].&lt;ref&gt;Iverson 2009, 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ligeti's music appears to have been subsequently influenced by his electronic experiments, and many of the sounds he created resembled electronic [[texture (music)|textures]]. Ligeti coined the term "[[micropolyphony]]" to describe the texture of the second movement of ''Apparitions'' (1958–59) and ''[[Atmosphères]]'' (1961). This texture is a similar to that of [[polyphony]], except that the polyphony is obscured in a dense and rich stack of pitches.&lt;ref name="micropolyphony"&gt;Jones n.d.&lt;/ref&gt; Micropolyphony can be used to create the nearly static but slowly evolving works such as ''Atmosphères'' in which the individual instruments become hidden in a complex web of sound. According to Ligeti, after ''Apparitions'' and ''Atmosphères'', he "became famous".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ronsen.org/monkminkpinkpunk/9/gl4.html |title=A Budapest Interview with Gyorgy Ligeti |author=Istvan Szigeti |date=July 29, 1983 |work= |publisher=First published in New Hungarian Quarterly |accessdate=18 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With ''Volumina'' (1961–62, revised 1966) for solo organ, Ligeti continued with [[Tone cluster|clusters of notes]], translated into blocks of sound. In this piece, Ligeti abandoned conventional music notation, instead using diagrams to represent general pitch areas, duration, and flurries of notes.&lt;ref name="volumina"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/composition/volumina-for-organ-mc0002406515 | title=Volumina, for organ | publisher=allmusic.com | accessdate=11 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Aventures'' (1962), like its companion piece ''Nouvelles Aventures'' (1962–65), is a composition for three singers and instrumental septet, to a text (of Ligeti's own devising) that is without semantic meaning. In these pieces, each singer has five roles to play, exploring five areas of emotion, and they switch from one to the other so quickly and abruptly that all five areas are present throughout the piece.&lt;ref&gt;Plaistow n.d., 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Requiem'' (1963–65) is a work for soprano and mezzo-soprano soloists, twenty-part chorus (four each of soprano, mezzo-soprano, alto, tenor, and bass), and orchestra. Though, at about half an hour, it is the longest piece he had composed up to that point,&lt;ref&gt;Steinitz 2003, 144.&lt;/ref&gt; Ligeti sets only about half of the [[Requiem]]'s traditional text: the "[[Introit]]us", the "[[Kyrie]]" (a completely [[chromatic]] quasi-[[fugue]], where the parts are a montage of [[melismatic]], skipping micropolyphony), and the "[[Dies irae]]"—dividing the latter sequence into two parts, "De die judicii" and "[[Lacrimosa (Requiem)|Lacrimosa]]".

''[[Lux Aeterna (Ligeti)|Lux Aeterna]]'' (1966) is a 16-voice ''a cappella'' piece whose text is also associated with the Latin Requiem.

Ligeti's Cello Concerto (1966), which is dedicated to [[Siegfried Palm]], is composed of two movements: the first begins with an almost imperceptible cello which slowly shifts into static tone clusters with the orchestra before reaching a crescendo and slowly decaying, while the second is a virtuoso piece of dynamic atonal melody on the part of the cello.&lt;ref name="celloconcerto"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/composition/cello-concerto-mc0002384607 | title=György Ligeti Cello Concerto | accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Lontano'' (1967), for full orchestra, is another example of micropolyphony, but the overall effect is closer to harmony, with complex woven textures and opacity of the sound giving rise to a harmonious effect. It has become a standard repertoire piece.&lt;ref name="lontano"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.schott-music.com/shop/9/show,175056.html | title=Schott Music – Shop – György Ligeti – Lontano | accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[String Quartet No. 2 (Ligeti)|String Quartet No. 2]] (1968) consists of five movements. They differ widely from each other in their types of motion. In the first, the structure is largely broken up, as in ''Aventures''. In the second, everything is reduced to very slow motion, and the music seems to be coming from a distance, with great lyricism. The ''[[pizzicato]]'' third movement is a machine-like studies, hard and mechanical, whereby the parts playing repeated notes create a "granulated" continuum. In the fourth, which is fast and threatening, everything that happened before is crammed together. Lastly, in strong contrast, the fifth movement spreads itself out. In each movement, the same basic configurations return, but each time their colouring or viewpoint is different, so that the overall form only really emerges when one listens to all five movements in context.&lt;ref name="Stephen Plaistow p. 3"&gt;Plaistow n.d., 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Ramifications (Ligeti)|Ramifications]]'' (1968–69), completed a year before the Chamber Concerto, is scored for an ensemble of strings in twelve parts—seven violins, two violas, two cellos and a double bass—each of which may be taken by one player or several. The twelve are divided into two numerically equal groups but with the instruments in the first group tuned approximately a quarter-tone higher (four violins, a viola and a cello). As the group play, the one tuned higher inevitably tends to slide down toward the other, and both get nearer each other in pitch.&lt;ref name="Stephen Plaistow p. 3"/&gt;

In the ''Chamber Concerto'' (1969–70), several layers, processes and kinds of movement can take place on different planes simultaneously. In spite of frequent markings of "senza tempo", the instrumentalists are not given linear freedom; Ligeti insists on keeping his texture under strict control at any given moment. The form is like a "precision mechanism". Ligeti was always fascinated by machines that do not work properly and by the world of technology and automation. The use of periodic mechanical noises, suggesting not-quite-reliable machinery, occurs in many of his works. The scoring is for flute (doubling piccolo), oboe (doubling oboe d'amore and cor anglais), clarinet, bass clarinet (doubling second clarinet), horn, trombone, harpsichord (doubling Hammond organ), piano (doubling celesta), and solo string quintet.&lt;ref&gt;Plaistow n.d., 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of these compositions establish timbre, rather than the traditionally-favored dimensions of pitch and rhythm, as their principal formal parameter, a practice that has come to be known as [[sonorism]].&lt;ref&gt;Schell 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1970s, Ligeti turned away from sonorism and began to concentrate on rhythm. Pieces such as ''[[Continuum (Ligeti)|Continuum]]'' (1968) and ''Clocks and Clouds'' (1972–73) were written before he heard the music of [[Steve Reich]] and [[Terry Riley]] in 1972. But the second of his ''Three Pieces for Two Pianos'' (1976), entitled "Self-portrait with Reich and Riley (and Chopin in the background)", commemorates this affirmation and influence. During the 1970s, he also became interested in the [[polyphonic]] pipe music of the [[Banda people|Banda]]-Linda tribe from the [[Central African Republic]], which he heard through the recordings of one of his students.&lt;ref&gt;Steinitz 2003, 271–72.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Le-grand-macabre.jpg|thumb|300x300px|Scene from ''[[Le Grand Macabre]]'' from a production at the [[Gran Teatre del Liceu]] in 2009]]
In 1977, Ligeti completed his only opera, ''[[Le Grand Macabre]]'', thirteen years after its initial commission. Loosely based on [[Michel de Ghelderode]]'s 1934 play, ''La balade du grand macabre'', it is a work of [[Absurd theatre]]—Ligeti called it an "anti-anti-opera"—in which [[Death (personification)|Death]] (Nekrotzar) arrives in the fictional city of Breughelland and announces that the end of the world will occur at midnight. Musically, ''Le Grand Macabre'' draws on techniques not associated with Ligeti's previous work, including [[quotation]]s and pseudo-quotations of other works&lt;ref&gt;Steinitz 2003, 230.&lt;/ref&gt; and the use of consonant thirds and sixths.

After ''Le Grand Macabre'', Ligeti would abandon the use of [[pastiche]],&lt;ref&gt;Steinitz 2003, 244.&lt;/ref&gt; but would increasingly incorporate consonant harmonies (even [[major triad|major]] and [[minor triad]]s) into his work, albeit not in a [[diatonic]] context.

===After ''Le Grand Macabre''===
[[File:Michael Daugherty et al at ISCM World Music Days 1982.jpg|thumb|right|280px|From left to right: György Ligeti, [[Lukas Ligeti]], Vera Ligeti, [[Conlon Nancarrow]], and [[Michael Daugherty]] at the [[ISCM]] World Music Days in [[Graz]], Austria, 1982]]

After ''Le Grand Macabre'', Ligeti struggled for some time to find a new style. Besides two short pieces for [[harpsichord]], he did not complete another major work until the [[Trio for Violin, Horn and Piano (Ligeti)|Trio for Violin, Horn and Piano]] in 1982, over four years after the opera. His music of the 1980s and 1990s continued to emphasise complex mechanical rhythms, often in a less densely chromatic idiom, tending to favour displaced major and minor triads and [[polytonality|polymodal]] structures. During this time, Ligeti also began to explore alternate tuning systems through the use of natural [[harmonic]]s for horns (as in the Horn Trio and [[Piano Concerto (Ligeti)|Piano Concerto]]) and [[scordatura]] for strings (as in the [[Violin Concerto (Ligeti)|Violin Concerto]]). Additionally, most of his works in this period are multi-movement works, rather than the extended single movements of ''Atmosphères'' and ''San Francisco Polyphony''.

From 1985 to 2001, Ligeti completed three books of [[Études (Ligeti)|Études]] for piano (Book I, 1985; Book II, 1988–94; Book III, 1995–2001). Comprising eighteen compositions in all, the Études draw from a diverse range of sources, including [[gamelan]],&lt;ref&gt;Wilson 1992, {{Page needed|date=January 2012}}&lt;!--The single word "gamelan" cannot possibly be spread over the entire article.--&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chen 2007, 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arnowitt 2009"&gt;Arnowitt [2009].&lt;/ref&gt; African [[polyrhythm]]s, Béla Bartók, [[Conlon Nancarrow]], [[Thelonious Monk]],&lt;ref name="Arnowitt 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steinitz 2003, 292&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bill Evans]]. Book I was written as preparation for the Piano Concerto, which contains a number of similar [[Motif (music)|motivic]] and melodic elements. Ligeti’s music from the last two decades of his life is unmistakable for its rhythmic complexity. Writing about his first book of Piano Études, the composer claims this rhythmic complexity stems from two vastly different sources of inspiration: the Romantic-era piano music of [[Chopin]] and [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]] and the [[Rhythm in Sub-Saharan Africa|indigenous music of sub-Saharan Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor 2003, 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

The difference between the earlier and later pieces lies in a new conception of [[pulse (music)|pulse]]. In the earlier works, the pulse is something to be divided into two, three and so on. The effect of these different subdivisions, especially when they occur simultaneously, is to blur the aural landscape, creating the micropolyphonic effect of Ligeti’s music.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor 2003, 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the later music—and a few earlier pieces such as ''[[Continuum (Ligeti)|Continuum]]''—treats the pulse as a musical atom, a common denominator, a basic unit, which cannot be divided further. Different rhythms appear through multiplications of the basic pulse, rather than divisions: this is the principle of African music seized on by Ligeti. It also appears in the music of [[Philip Glass]], [[Steve Reich]] and others; and significantly it shares much in common with the [[additive rhythm]]s of [[Balkan music|Balkan folk music]], the music of Ligeti’s youth.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor 2003, 87.&lt;/ref&gt; He described the music of Conlon Nancarrow, with its extremely complex explorations of polyrhythmic complexity, as "the greatest discovery since [[Anton Webern|Webern]] and [[Charles Ives|Ives]]... something great and important for all music history! His music is so utterly original, enjoyable, perfectly constructed, but at the same time emotional... for me it's the best music of any composer living today."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Kyle Gann. ''The Music of Conlon Nancarrow'', p.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, Ligeti completed his Piano Concerto, writing that "I present my artistic credo in the ''Piano Concerto'': I demonstrate my independence from criteria of the traditional [[Avant-garde music|avantgarde]], as well as the fashionable [[Postmodern music|postmodernism]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.schott-music.com/shop/konzert-no153614.html|title=Concerto for Piano and Orchestra|last=|first=|date=|website=Schott music|language=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial sketches of the Concerto began in 1980, but it was not until 1985 that he found a way forward and the work proceeded more quickly.&lt;ref&gt;Steinitz 2003, 315–16&lt;/ref&gt; The Concerto explores many of the ideas worked out in the Études but in an orchestral context.

In 1993, Ligeti completed his [[Violin Concerto (Ligeti)|Violin Concerto]] after four years of work. Like the Piano Concerto, the Violin Concerto uses the wide range of techniques he had developed up until that point as well as the new ideas he was working out at the moment. Among other techniques, it uses a passacaglia,&lt;ref&gt;Schell 2018&lt;/ref&gt; "[[microtonality]], rapidly changing [[texture (music)|textures]], comic juxtapositions... [[Hungarian folk music|Hungarian folk melodies]], [[Bulgarian dances|Bulgarian dance rhythms]], references to [[Medieval music|Medieval]] and [[Renaissance music]] and solo violin writing that ranges from the slow-paced and sweet-toned to the angular and fiery."&lt;ref&gt;Kozinn 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable works from this period are the [[Viola Sonata (Ligeti)|Viola Sonata]] (1994) and the ''Nonsense Madrigals'' (1988–93), a set of six [[a cappella]] compositions that set English texts from [[William Brighty Rands]], [[Lewis Carroll]], and [[Heinrich Hoffman]]. The third Madrigal is a setting of the English [[alphabet]].

Ligeti's last works were the ''[[Hamburg Concerto]]'' for solo horn, four [[natural horn]]s and chamber orchestra (1998–99, revised 2003, dedicated to [[Marie Luise Neunecker]]), the [[song cycle]] ''[[Síppal, dobbal, nádihegedüvel]]'' ("With Pipes, Drums, Fiddles", 2000), and the eighteenth piano étude "Canon" (2001). Additionally, after ''Le Grand Macabre'', Ligeti planned to write a second opera, first to be based on [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Tempest]]'' and later on Carroll's ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', but neither came to fruition.

''Lux Aeterna'' is heard in the moon-bus scene en route to the Tycho monolith. The ''Kyrie'' sequence of his ''Requiem'' is heard over the first three monolith encounters. An electronically altered version of ''Aventures'', unlisted in the film credits, is heard in the cryptic final scenes. The music was used, and in some cases modified, without Ligeti's knowledge, and without full [[copyright]] clearance. When he learned about the use of his music in the film, he "successfully sued for having had his music distorted",&lt;ref&gt;Agel 1970, 12.&lt;/ref&gt; but [[settled out of court]]. Kubrick in return sought permission and compensated Ligeti for use of his music in later films.&lt;ref name="ld-oflss"&gt;Crilly 2011, 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Lux Aeterna'' was used again in [[Peter Hyams]]'s 1984 sequel to ''2001'', ''[[2010 (film)|2010]]''.&lt;ref name="allegro-c.de" /&gt;

Ligeti is also known to the public through the use of his music in other films by other directors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5790">'''Havidol''' (avafynetyme HCL) is a [[parody]] campaign for a fictional medication to treat a fake [[psychological disorder]] called Dysphoric Social Attention Consumption Deficit Anxiety Disorder (DSACDAD). [Pronounced Dee-sack-dad] The name is a play on the phrase: "have it all"; its pseudo-chemical name, "avafynetyme HCL", reads, "Have a fine time".

==History==
According to the artist, [[Justine Cooper (artist)|Justine Cooper]], the "official HAVIDOL website", havidol.com, had 5,000 hits within a few days of its creation, and some visitors to her gallery have believed HAVIDOL to be a real prescription drug.&lt;ref&gt;Reuters (Fri Feb 16, 2007 2:40PM EST) [https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSL165119520070216?&amp;src=021607_1724_ARTICLE_PROMO_also_on_reuters Fake drug, fake illness -- and people believe it!] last accessed 2007-02-24&lt;/ref&gt;

HAVIDOL was presented at the 18th Consumers International World Congress on The Ethics of Drug Promotion held in [[Sydney, Australia]] October 29 to November 1, 2007.&lt;ref name=CIWC_20071129&gt;{{Cite conference |last1=Ridberg |first1=Ronit |last2=Carbona |first2=Gene |last3=Cooper |first3=Justine |contribution=SESSION 8 (plenary), Media technologies and public campaigning, Panel discussion |title=International World Congress, Holding Corporations to Account, Luna Park, Sydney, October 29 to November 1, 2007| url = http://consint.live.poptech.coop/Templates/Internal.asp?NodeID=97099?NodeID=96053Consumers |publisher=[[Consumers International]] and CHOICE |date=2007-10-31 |contribution-url=http://www.consumersinternational.org/shared_asp_files/GFSR.asp?NodeID=97098 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071204002206/http://www.consumersinternational.org/shared_asp_files/GFSR.asp?NodeID=97098 |archive-date=2007-12-04}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Justine Cooper==
[[Australia]]n artist Justine Cooper created the marketing campaign as a social [[satire]] on the [[disease mongering|tactics used by the drug industry]] to sell [[prescription drug|prescription medications]]. The pseudo [[advertising]] campaign also examines our collective desire and expectation, that there is always room for improvement, and our doubts as to whether we are ever good enough, or have enough.&lt;ref name=PBS_20071113&gt;{{cite news| last = Wenner| first = Melinda| title = Art Tackles Big Pharma: A Few Creative-types Raise Awareness About Disease-Mongering | publisher = [[Wired Science]] | date = 2007-11-13 | url = https://www.pbs.org/kcet/wiredscience/story/81-art_tackles_big_pharma.html| accessdate = 2008-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ABC_20071113&gt;{{cite news | last = Palan| first = Simon| title = Spoof drug exposes big pharma's 'disease mongering'| publisher = [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]| date = 2007-10-30| url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/10/30/2074586.htm| accessdate = 2008-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper stated she intended the exhibit to be humorous, but subtle. The campaign recreates the entire drug marketing process. It starts from the invention of a new disorder to the branding process of naming the drug, its pill and logo design, and promotional merchandise. The campaign was on display at the [[Daneyal Mahmood Art Gallery]] in [[New York City]] from February 8 to March 17, 2007 and included TV, print and billboard ads along with merchandise and branding material.&lt;ref name=Artinfo_20070226&gt;{{cite news | title = "Havidol" at NY's Daneyal Mahmood| publisher = Artinfo | date = 2007-02-26 | url = http://www.artinfo.com/articles/story/24396/havidol-at-nys-daneyal-mahmood| accessdate = 2008-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooper had the initial idea while waiting for a flight at the [[Los Angeles International Airport]]. She viewed her first [[direct-to-consumer advertising|direct-to-consumer]] (DTC) pharmaceutical advertisements, promoting drugs for [[allergy|allergies]], [[insomnia]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and [[erectile dysfunction]], while watching the news on TV. DTC advertising is only allowed in the United States and New Zealand. She received funding from the [[Australia Council for the Arts]], the Greenwall Foundation in New York, and the [[New York State Council on the Arts]].&lt;ref name=PharmExec_20071015&gt;{{cite web| last = Donahue| first = Marylyn (Special Projects Editor)| title = When Branding Is Art| publisher = PharmExec.org| date = 2007-10-15| url = http://pharmexec.findpharma.com/pharmexec/Supplements/When-Branding-Is-Art/ArticleStandard/Article/detail/465558?contextCategoryId=43508| accessdate = 2008-01-06| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110711002949/http://pharmexec.findpharma.com/pharmexec/Supplements/When-Branding-Is-Art/ArticleStandard/Article/detail/465558?contextCategoryId=43508| archivedate = 2011-07-11| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spontaneous symmetry breaking]], a vacuum [[Higgs field]], and its associated [[fundamental particle]] the Higgs boson are quantum phenomena. A vacuum '''Higgs field''' is responsible for spontaneous symmetry breaking the [[gauge theory|gauge symmetries]] of fundamental interactions and provides the [[Higgs mechanism]] of generating mass of elementary particles.

At the same time, [[gauge theory|classical gauge theory]] admits comprehensive geometric formulation where [[gauge theory|gauge fields]] are represented by [[connection (principal bundle)|connections]] on [[principal bundle]]s. In this framework, spontaneous symmetry breaking is characterized as a [[reduction of the structure group]] &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; of a principal bundle &lt;math&gt;P\to X&lt;/math&gt; to its closed subgroup &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;. By the well-known theorem, such a reduction takes place if and only if there exists a global section &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; of the quotient bundle &lt;math&gt;P/G\to X&lt;/math&gt;. This section is treated as a '''classical Higgs field'''.

A key point is that there exists a composite bundle &lt;math&gt;P\to P/G\to X&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;P\to P/G&lt;/math&gt; is a principal bundle with the structure group &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;. Then matter fields, possessing an exact symmetry group &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, in the presence of classical Higgs fields are described by sections of some [[Connection (composite bundle)|composite bundle]] &lt;math&gt;E\to P/G\to X&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;E\to P/G&lt;/math&gt; is some [[associated bundle]] to &lt;math&gt;P\to P/G&lt;/math&gt;. Herewith, a [[Lagrangian system|Lagrangian]] of these matter fields is gauge invariant only if it factorizes through the vertical covariant differential of some connection on a principal bundle &lt;math&gt;P\to P/G&lt;/math&gt;, but not &lt;math&gt;P\to X&lt;/math&gt;.

An example of a classical Higgs field is a classical [[gravitational field]] identified with a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo-Riemannian metric]] on a [[world manifold]] &lt;math&gt; X&lt;/math&gt;. In the framework of [[gauge gravitation theory]], it is described as a global section of the quotient bundle &lt;math&gt;FX/O(1,3)\to X&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;FX&lt;/math&gt; is a principal bundle of the tangent frames to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; with the structure group &lt;math&gt;GL(4,\mathbb R)&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''Japanese American Memorial to Patriotism During World War II''' is a [[National Park Service]] site to commemorate the experience of American citizens of Japanese ancestry and their parents who patriotically supported the United States despite unjust treatment during [[World War II]].

The work is located at Louisiana Avenue and D Street, [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.]] in Washington, D.C. The Memorial commemorates Japanese American war involvement, veterans and patriotism during World War II, as well as the patriotism and endurance of those held in [[Japanese American internment]], or, incarceration camps, and detention centers.&lt;ref name="SIRIS"&gt;{{cite web | author=Smithsonian | year=2001 | title=National Japanese American Memorial, (sculpture). | work=Inventory staff | publisher=Smithsonian | url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;uri=full=3100001~!351342~!0#focus | accessdate= 14 Feb 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

The central cast bronze sculpture, named ''Golden Cranes'', consists of two [[Japanese Crane|Japanese cranes]] caught in barbed wire on top of a tall, square pedestal incised with grooves suggestive of drill cores used to extract stone from quarries. Standing amongst a landscaped plaza, a semi-circular granite wall curves around the sculpture. The wall features inscriptions of the names of the ten major internment camps where over 120,000 Japanese Americans were confined. There are also three panels that feature 1) the names of Japanese Americans who died fighting in World War II, 2) inscribed writings by Japanese American writers such as [[Bill Hosokawa]], 3) quotes by presidents Harry S. Truman and Ronald Reagan.&lt;ref name="SIRIS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hosokawa"&gt;{{cite web|author=Bill Gallo |year=2008 |title=Champion of Japanese culture - and dignity |work=Local News |publisher=Rocky Mountain News |url=http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/feb/15/champion-of-japanese-culture---and-dignity/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218163816/http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/feb/15/champion-of-japanese-culture---and-dignity/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=18 February 2008 |accessdate=15 Feb 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information==

===Acquisition and creation===

The concept for the Monument was initiated in 1988 by the "Go For Broke" National Veterans Association Foundation. "&lt;ref name="SIRIS"/&gt; The name of this organization was later changed to the [http://njamf.com/ National Japanese American Memorial Foundation] (NJAMF). Architect Davis Buckley and Sculptor Nina Akamu were the principal designers.

Construction of the National Japanese American Memorial on Federal land was authorized by [http://uscode.house.gov/statutes/pl/102/502.pdf statute] (PL 102-502) and signed into law by President George Bush on October 24, 1992, to "Commemorate the experience of American citizens of Japanese ancestry and their parents who patriotically supported this country despite their unjust treatment during World War II. The groundbreaking for the Memorial took place on October 22, 1999, and the Memorial was dedicated on November 9, 2000. A celebration of the completion of the Memorial was held on June 29, 2001.

Preceding the final design and installation of the Memorial, sculptor Nina Akamu traveled to the International Crane Foundation in [[Baraboo, Wisconsin]], where she spent time studying and sketching the cranes that would become the centerpiece of the Memorial.&lt;ref name=Goode&gt;Goode, John ''Washington Sculpture''. The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2008, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ownership of the Memorial was officially transferred to the United States Government in 2002. The National Park Service [https://www.nps.gov/wwii/learn/historyculture/japanese-americans-at-war.htm is responsible] for the maintenance of the Memorial today.

===Symbolism===

Rising above the rest of the Memorial, the cranes are visible from beyond the Memorial walls, which celebrates the ability to rise beyond limitations. Their postures reflect one another - one wing pointing upwards, the other downwards, mirroring each other and representing the [[Dualistic cosmology|duality]] of the universe. Pressing their bodies against one another and seeming to hold onto the barbed wire, the birds show individual effort to escape restraint with the need for communal support and interdependence on one another.&lt;ref name="NJAM"&gt;{{cite web|author= |year=2009 |title=Japanese Crane Monument |work=Visit the Memorial |publisher=National Japanese American Memorial Foundation |url=http://njamf.com/index.php/japanese-crane-monument |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212114340/http://njamf.com/index.php/japanese-crane-monument |dead-url=yes |archive-date=12 December 2009 |accessdate=15 Feb 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an "Honor Wall" central within the Memorial which lists the names of the 800-plus [http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Japanese_Americans_in_military_during_World_War_II/ Japanese Americans in the U.S. Armed Forces] who were killed in action during World War II.

According to the National Japanese American Memorial Foundation, the memorial:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...is symbolic not only of the Japanese American experience, but of the extrication of anyone from deeply painful and restrictive circumstances. It reminds us of the battles we've fought to overcome our ignorance and prejudice and the meaning of an integrated culture, once pained and torn, now healed and unified. Finally, the monument presents the Japanese American experience as a symbol for all peoples.&lt;ref name="NJAM"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Veterans honored===

The Memorial honors Japanese American veterans who served in the [[100th Infantry Battalion (United States)|100th Infantry Battalion]], [[442nd RCT]], [[Military Intelligence Service (United States)|Military Intelligence Service]] and other units.&lt;ref name="NJAM"/&gt; The 100th/442nd Regimental Combat Team would become the most decorated unit of the war for its size and length of service.

The 442nd and the 100th Infantry Battalion together earned seven Presidential Unit Citations, two Meritorious Service Plaques, 36 Army Commendation Medals, and 87 Division Commendations. Individually, Soldiers earned 21 Medals of Honor, 29 Distinguished Service Crosses, one Distinguished Service Medal, more than 354 Silver Stars, and more than 4,000 Purple Hearts, as noted by Chief of Staff of the Army Gen. Raymond T. Odierno during a November 2, 2011, [https://www.army.mil/article/68471/40_Bronze_Stars_awarded_to_Japanese_American_vets ceremony] in Washington, D.C. at which 40 Japanese Americans were presented the Bronze Star they had never received. A year prior to this ceremony, President Barack Obama [https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2010/10/05/awe-inspiring-chapter-americas-history signed legislation] on October 5, 2010, to grant the Congressional Gold Medal, collectively, to the 100th Infantry Battalion and 442nd Regimental Combat Team in recognition of their dedicated service during World War II.

===Dedication on November 9, 2000===
[[File:Japanese American Memorial to Patriotism During World War II.jpg|thumb|Entrance to the memorial]]
The U.S.Department of Defense [http://archive.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=45581 described] the November 9, 2000, dedication of the Memorial: "Drizzling rain was mixed with tears streaming down the faces of Japanese American World War II heroes and those who spent the war years imprisoned in isolated internment camps..."

The Department of Defense Armed Force Press Service [http://archive.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=45581 reported] on November 15 that an estimated 2,000 people attended the dedication "to commemorate the heroism and sacrifice of Japanese Americans who fought and died for the United States...They also came to honor the more than 120,000 men, women and children who maintained their loyalty even though they were put in desolate internment camps."

[[Rudy de Leon|Deputy Secretary of Defense Rudy de Leon]] spoke at the dedication, noting, "one of the great ironies of World War II was that Japanese Americans of the 522nd Field Artillery Battalion were among the first allied troops to liberate the [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]] concentration camp. They liberated prisoners of war while some of them had family members kept in internment camps back in the United States"

[[United States Attorney General]] [[Janet Reno]] also spoke at the dedication of the Memorial, where she shared a letter from President [[Bill Clinton]] stating: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;We are diminished when any American is targeted unfairly because of his or her heritage. This Memorial and the internment sites are powerful reminders that stereotyping, discrimination, hatred and racism have no place in this country.&lt;ref name=Goode/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==''Golden Cranes'' sculptor, Nina Akamu==

[[Nina Akamu]] is a third-generation Japanese American artist and former vice president of the [http://nationalsculpture.org/ National Sculpture Society]. Akamu created the sculpture entitled ''Golden Cranes'' of two [[Red-crowned crane|Grus japonensis]] birds, which became the center feature of the Japanese American Memorial to Patriotism During World War II.

Akamu's grandfather on her mother's side was arrested in [[Hawaii]] during the internment program. He was sent to a relocation camp on [[Sand Island (Hawaii)|Sand Island]] in [[Pearl Harbor]]. Suffering from [[diabetes]] upon his internment, he died of a [[heart attack]] three months into his imprisonment. This family connection—combined with growing up for a time in Hawaii, where she fished with her father at Pearl Harbor—and the erection of a Japanese American war memorial near her home in [[Massa, Italy]], inspired a strong connection to the Memorial and its creation.&lt;ref name="AmakuNJAM"&gt;{{cite web | author=Nina Akamu | year=2007 | title=The National Japanese American Memorial, "Golden Cranes" | work=Public Sculpture | publisher=Studio Equus, et al. | url=http://www.studioequus.com/njam.html | accessdate= 15 Feb 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 19, 1942, 73 days after the United States entered [[World War II]], President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] issued [[Executive Order 9066]] which resulted in the removal of 120,000 [[Japanese American]] men, women and children from their homes in the western states and Hawaii.

Allowed only what they could carry, families were forced to abandon homes, friends, farms and businesses to live in ten remote relocation centers guarded by armed troops and surrounded by barbed wire fences. Some remained in the relocation centers until March 1946.

In addition 4,500 were arrested by the Justice Department and held in internment camps, such as Santa Fe, New Mexico. 2,500 were also held at the family camp in Crystal City, Texas.

Answering the call of duty, young Japanese Americans entered into military service, joining many pre-war draftees. The [[100th Infantry Battalion (United States)|100th infantry battalion]] and [[442nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|442nd regimental combat team]], fighting in Europe, became the most highly decorated army unit for its size and length of service in American Military History. Japanese Americans in the Military Intelligence Service used their bilingual skills to help shorten the war in the Pacific and thus saved countless American lives. The [http://encyclopedia.densho.org/1399th_Engineer_Construction_Battalion/ 1399th Engineer Construction Battalion] helped fortify the infrastructure essential for victory.

In 1983, almost forty years after the war ended, the federal [[Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians]] found that there had been no military necessity for the mass imprisonment of Japanese Americans and that a grave injustice had been done.

In 1988 President [[Ronald W. Reagan]] signed the [[Civil Liberties Act]] which made an apology for the injustice, provided minimal compensation and reaffirmed the nation's commitment to equal justice under the law for all Americans.

{{Refimprove|date=November 2011}}
'''Jewish American literature''' holds an essential place in the [[American literature|literary history of the United States]]. It encompasses traditions of writing in [[American English|English]], primarily, as well as in other languages, the most important of which has been [[Yiddish literature|Yiddish]]. While critics and authors generally acknowledge the notion of a distinctive corpus and practice of writing about [[American Jews|Jewishness in America]], many writers resist being pigeonholed as "Jewish voices." Also, many nominally Jewish writers cannot be considered representative of Jewish American literature, one example being [[Isaac Asimov]].

==Beginnings==
Beginning with the [[memoir]]s and [[petition]]s composed by the [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] immigrants who arrived in America during the mid 17th century, Jewish American writing grew over the subsequent centuries to flourish in other genres as well, including [[fiction]], [[poetry]], and [[drama]].The first notable voice in Jewish- American literature was Emma Lazarus whose poem "The New Colossus" on the Statue of Liberty became the great hymnal of American immigration. [[Gertrude Stein]] became one of the most influential prose-stylists of the early 20th century.

The early twentieth century saw the appearance of two pioneering American Jewish novels: Abraham Cahan's "The Rise of David Levinsky" and Henry Roth's "Call it Sleep." It reached some of its most mature expression in the 20th century "Jewish American [[novel]]s"  by [[Saul Bellow]], [[J. D. Salinger]], [[Norman Mailer]], [[Bernard Malamud]], [[Chaim Potok]], and [[Philip Roth]]. Their work explored the conflicting pulls between [[secularism|secular society]] and [[Judaism|Jewish tradition]] which were acutely felt by the immigrants who passed through [[Ellis Island]] and by their children and grandchildren.

==Present day==
More recent authors like [[Nicole Krauss]], [[Paul Auster]], [[Michael Chabon]], [[Jonathan Safran Foer]], [[Alan Kaufman (writer)|Alan Kaufman]], [[Lev Raphael]] and [[Art Spiegelman]] have continued to examine dilemmas of identity in their work, turning their attention especially to [[the Holocaust]] and the trends of both ongoing [[Jewish assimilation|assimilation]] and cultural rediscovery exhibited by younger generations of American Jews. Arguably the most influential of all American Jewish novels was [[Leon Uris]]' ''[[Exodus (Uris novel)|Exodus]]''.{{Fact|date=May 2018}} Its story of the struggle to create the modern state of Israel translated into Russian became the inspiration for hundreds of thousands of Russian immigrants to Israel. Modern Jewish American novels often contain (a few or many) Jewish characters and address issues and themes of importance to Jewish American society such as [[Assimilation (sociology)|assimilation]], [[Zionism]]/[[Israel]], and [[antisemitism]], along with the recent phenomenon known as "[[New antisemitism]]."

Three Jewish-American writers have won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], [[Isaac Bashevis Singer]], [[Saul Bellow]], and [[Joseph Brodsky]]. Magazines such as ''[[The New Yorker]]'' have proved to be instrumental in exposing many Jewish American writers to a wider reading public.

==Stereotypes of Jews==
{{main|Stereotypes of Jews in literature}}

Although Jewish stereotypes first appeared in works by non-Jewish writers, after [[World War II]], it was often Jewish American writers themselves who evoked such fixed images. The prevalence of antisemitic stereotypes in the works of such authors has sometimes been interpreted an expression of self-hatred; however, Jewish American authors have also used these negative stereotypes in order to refute them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Multiethnic American Literature: I - M |first=Emmanuel Sampath|last=Nelson |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Company |year=2005 |page=1175 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M9Xk28_4NBoC&amp;pg=PA1175&amp;dq=Stereotypes+Jews+literature&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3ADaTYq5J4i6sQOLkISGDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Stereotypes%20Jews%20literature&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, American-Jewish literature has also strongly celebrated American life. It has been primarily more an American than a Jewish literature. Perhaps the preeminent example of this is the great breakthrough novel of Saul Bellow  ''[[The Adventures of Augie March]]''.

According to Sanford V. Sternlicht, the first generation of Jewish-American authors presented "realistic portrayals - warts and all" of Jewish immigrants. In contrast, some second or third-generation Jewish-American authors deliberately "reinforced negative stereotypes with satire and a selective realism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sternlicht |first1=Sanford |title=Masterpieces of Jewish American literature |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7-YII_WikhAC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=Stereotypes+Jews+literature&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=hgvaTZLuFZDQsAOL3M2MDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBzge#v=onepage&amp;q=Stereotypes%20Jews%20literature&amp;f=false |accessdate=November 22, 2011 |year=2007 |page=8 |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |location=Westport, CT, USA |isbn=978-0-313-33857-1 |oclc=76183866}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film has been the most influential medium in the presentation of the [[history of slavery]] to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;Michael T. Martin and David C. Wall, "The Politics of Cine-Memory: Signifying Slavery in the History Film,"  in Robert A. Rosenstone and Constantin Parvulesu, eds. ''A Companion to the Historical Film'' (Wiley-Blackwell, 2013), p67.&lt;/ref&gt;  The American film industry has had a complex relationship with [[slavery]], and until recent decades often avoided the topic. Films such as ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' (1915)&lt;ref&gt;Melvyn Stokes, ''D.W. Griffith's the Birth of a Nation: A History of the Most Controversial Motion Picture of All Time'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (1939) became controversial because they gave a favorable depiction. In 1940, ''[[Santa Fe Trail (film)|The Santa Fe Trail]]'' gave a strong condemnation of [[abolitionist]] [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]'s attacks on slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Morsberger, "Slavery and 'The Santa Fe Trail,' or, John Brown on Hollywood's Sour Apple Tree," ''American Studies'' (1977) 18#2 pp. 87–98.

&lt;note name = "while ... black"&gt;  OK, i am  disqualifyying myself from doing more about this than drawing attn to it and offering a possible draft for the change. I won't complain if someone thinks i'm a "white phony liberal", but i note my objection to the language i found in one of the entries, along the lines of " marrying a white woman while possibly black". IMO, the phrase "driving [or whatever] while black" is a well established term regarding oppression, and adapting it in the context of describing the film in question is too ambiguous between mockery of the rerm, and an unfamiliar extension of its use in labelling oppression, to be acceptable in an article. Discuss, please, and reword unless i'm mistaken.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Monument to Donizetti''' by [[Francesco Jerace]] is located in a public garden in Piazza Cavour, adjacent to the [[Teatro Donizetti]] in [[Bergamo]]. 

==Description==
The monument was inaugurated in 1897, at the centenary of his birth and in his birthplace, and commemorates the opera composer [[Gaetano Donizetti]]. Jerace was elected via a competition to complete the monument. The statuary group is atop a plain plinth engraved only with the composers name. The monument is surrounded by a Basin. Atop, Donizetti sits, realistically depicted, and  bound to present world, in the corner of a curved bench. A short distance away stands the lyrical muse, [[Melpomene]], strumming her lyre. The artist, with eyes closed, listens to his inspiration. The statue mixes both realism and the allegory to classical mythology; also expressing the sense that the artists communicates with a superior realm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scultura-italiana.com/Biografie/Jerace.htm Scultura Italiana] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602230118/http://www.scultura-italiana.com/Biografie/Jerace.htm |date=2016-06-02 }}, biography.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-OMNAAAAYAAJ The Italy of the Italians], by Helen Zimmern, pp. 130–131.&lt;/ref&gt; Donizetti's funereal monument in Bergamo, se up in 1856 features a mournful lyrical muse.

The '''Naveta d'Es Tudons''', or '''Naveta of Es Tudons''' (in Menorquí, ''naveta'', or ''naueta'', a diminutive form of ''nau'', means ''nave'',&lt;ref&gt;The monument is sometimes also called ''Nau d'Es Tudons''&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Es Tudons'', lit. ''the woodpigeons'', is the name of the place),&lt;ref name=Grinsell&gt;{{harvnb|Grinsell|1975|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the most remarkable [[megalithic]] [[chamber tomb]] in the [[Balearic Islands|Balearic island]] of [[Menorca]], Spain.

It is located in the Western part of the island, on the [[Ciutadella de Menorca]]-[[Port Mahon|Mahón]] road, approximately 3 miles out from Ciutadella, and 200 m south of the road. It stands on slightly rising ground in a sloping valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|James|1957|p=67}} [https://archive.org/stream/prehistoricrelig00jame#page/n71/mode/2up]&lt;/ref&gt; Currently the Naveta d'Es Tudons is open to the public for visits (except for its interior as a measure of protection). It is one of the main tourist attractions of Menorca.

== History==
In Menorca and Majorca there are several dozen habitational and funerary [[naveta]] complexes, some of which similarly comprise two storeys.&lt;ref name=Grinsell/&gt;&lt;ref name="GeorgGerster" /&gt;&lt;ref name=fdz/&gt; Navetas (''navetes'' in Menorquí) are chronologically pre-Talaiotic (i.e. prior to the [[Talaiotic culture|Talaiotic age]]) constructions.&lt;ref name=fdz&gt;{{harvnb|Fernández Miranda|1997|pp=60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spanisharts.com/arquitectura/imagenes/prehistoria/i_navetas.html|title=Navetas, Menorca, Baleares Islands |work=The History Of The Spanish Architecture}}&lt;/ref&gt; Navetas were described in the early 19th century but not excavated until the 20th, notably during the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref name="GeorgGerster"&gt;{{harvnb|Gerster|2007|p=250 (Es Tudons in Menorca, Spain)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Navetas were first given their name by the rather imaginative Dr Juan Ramis (1818) from their resemblance to upturned boats.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grinsell|1975|p=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoskin|Morales Núñez|1991|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Naveta d'Es Tudons is the largest and best preserved funerary naveta in Menorca. The Naveta d'Es Tudons served as collective [[ossuary]] between 1200 and 750 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chapman|Grant|1997|pp=69–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lower chamber was for stashing the disarticulated bones of the dead after the flesh had been removed&lt;ref name="PhilLee"&gt;Phil Lee, ''The Rough Guide to Menorca'', Rough Guides, 2001, 288 p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; while the upper chamber was probably used for the drying of recently placed corpses.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blake |Knapp|2005| p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radiocarbon dating of the bones found in the different funerary navetas in Menorca indicate a usage period between about 1130-820 BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Micó |first=Rafael|title=Radiocarbon dating and balearic prehistory: reviewing the  periodization of the prehistoric sequence|journal=Radiocarbon |year=2006|volume=48|issue=3|pages=421–434 |url=https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/radiocarbon/article/view/2886/2649|accessdate=8 May 2012|issn=0033-8222}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the navetas like the Naveta d'Es Tudons are probably older. Pre-Talaiotic constructions are dated using an uncalibrated radiocarbon chronology from 1640 to 1400 BC.&lt;ref name=fdz/&gt; The navetas used for communal burial rituals are dated to the late second millennium and early first millennium BC.&lt;ref name=Lagarda&gt;{{cite web|last=Lagarda i Mata|first=Ferran|title=Es Tudons|url=http://www.menorcaweb.net/arqueologia/menorca/arqme64.htm|work=Menorcaweb.net|accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chap" /&gt;

Although listed in the [[Bien de Interés Cultural|Spanish heritage register]] on 3 June 1931 ([http://toolserver.org/%7Eplatonides/wlm/ids.php?bic=RI-51-0003442&amp;userlang=en RI-51-0003442]), the naveta d'Es Tudons was excavated and restored by archaeologist [[Lluís Pericot García]] in 1959-1960. It was found to contain the remains of at least 100 skeletons (one with trepanned skull). Various recovered objects like [[bronze]] bracelets or bone and ceramic buttons &lt;ref name=Grinsell/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.menorcaweb.com/reports/archaeological-sites/naveta-des-tudons/|work=MenorcaWeb.com |title=Naveta des Tudons}}&lt;/ref&gt; are today on display in the [[Museu de Menorca]] in Mahón.  Restoration works were carried out and the two or three missing courses at the top were put back in place.&lt;ref name=Grinsell/&gt; For protection, it was surrounded at a distance by a recently restored modern dry stone field wall.&lt;ref&gt;Dominique Auzias, Jean-Paul Labourdette, ''Baléares, Ibiza&amp;nbsp;— Minorque&amp;nbsp;— Majorque'', Le Petit Fûté, 2012, 336 p., p. 281 : "Inutile de vous extasier sur le mur de pierre sèche qui entoure la Naveta, il est de construction récente" ("There is no need for one to enthuse about the dry stone wall surrounding the Naveta, its construction is recent.")&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architecture ==
[[File:Plan and Section of Nau d'Es Tudons 1912.png|thumb|left|Plan and section of the unrestored naveta (1912): ''(a)'' low door, ''(b)'' narrow slab-roofed passage, ''(c)'' long rectangular chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peet|1912|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cartailhac|1892}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] 

The shape of the Naveta d'Es Tudons is that of a boat upside down, with the stern as its trapezoidal façade and the bow as its rounded apse. Its groundplan is an elongated semicircle. Externally, the edifice is 14.5 m long by 6.5 m wide and 4.55 m high but it would originally have been 6 m high.&lt;ref name=Grinsell/&gt; It is orientated SWS/ENE, the entrance being at the SWS, in the centre of the slightly slanted (or battered) façade.

The front, side walls and apse of the edifice consist of successive horizontal corbelled courses of huge rectangular or square [[limestone]] blocks dressed with a hammer&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Guillemard|1907|pp=465–467}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fitted together without mortar, with an all-round foundation course of blocks of even greater size laid on edge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artehistoria.jcyl.es/artesp/obras/19331.htm|title= Naveta dels Tudons (Ciutadella, Menorca)]|work=artehistoria|quote=''Toda la construcción se ejecutó mediante sillares de buen tamaño dispuestos en hiladas regulares, excepto el zócalo hecho a base de bloques de mayor tamaño que sirven de cimentación.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The narrow, low entrance doorway (0.57 m x 0.75 m) is rebated to receive a closing slab. The once sealed-off entrance leads by a short, flag-roofed passage to an antechamber 1.3 m long and then another short passage to the main or lower chamber (7.45 m x 2.45 m), the ceiling of which is made of giant horizontal slabs inserted into the side walls, with an average span of 1.5 m ''c.'' 2.25 m above the floor. Above this is an upper chamber which is accessible from the upper part of the antechamber. It is slightly shorter (7.10 m) and narrower (1.90 m) than the lower chamber, with a similar although much lower (0.85 m) ceiling of horizontal slabs.&lt;ref name=Grinsell/&gt; These have holes in them, presumably for ventilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stonefoundation.org/gallery/sp02.html|title= Tektonika, a photo gallery - an exhibit of photographs of the stonework of the Balearic Islands &amp; the Catalan mainland|work=Stonefoundation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Folklore ==
According to Phil Lee, the author of ''The Rough Guide to Menorca'', folkloric memories of the navetas' original purpose may have survived into modern times, for the Menorcans were loath to go near these odd-looking and solitary monuments until well into the 19th century.&lt;ref name="PhilLee" /&gt;

A modern tragic lore tells that two giants were competing for the love of a girl. They agreed that one would build a naveta and the other would dig a water well and the first to finish would marry the girl. As the giant who was building the naveta was about to lay the last stone, the other struck water. Mad with jealousy, the first giant threw the last stone (the one that is missing from the top of the façade) into the well, killing the other giant. Then, feeling remorse, he killed himself. It is said that the girl died a spinster and was buried in the naveta.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

'''''No Turn Unstoned''''' is a collection of "the worst theatrical reviews in history" compiled by the actress [[Dame (title)|Dame]] [[Diana Rigg]]. The first edition, published by [[Elm Tree Books]] in 1982, did not sell well, but over the years it attained a near-[[cult]] status and a [[paperback]] edition was released in 1991.

Rigg wrote to her many friends and acquaintances in the theatre and film industries and asked them to share their worst-ever reviews. She also researched theatre criticism and surviving comments from as far back as [[Ancient Greece]]. During the early 1990s, Dame Diana toured university campuses, reading excerpts from the book. All of the proceeds from the speaking tour, and the book itself, were donated to a theatrical charity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2943">'''Objective abstraction''' was a British art movement c. 1933-1936.

==History==
Objective abstraction was a form of abstract art developed by a group of British artists in 1933. Experimentation was prevalent in [[British art]] at the time.

The main figures were [[Graham Bell (artist)|Graham Bell]], [[William Coldstream]], [[Edgar Hubert]], [[Rodrigo Moynihan]] and [[Geoffrey Tibble]].

The movement was short-lived lasting only a few years. Many of the artists involved went on to be part of the [[realism (arts)|realist]] [[Euston Road School]].

==Method==
William Townsend told the [[Tate Gallery]] that 'the style originated with [[Geoffrey Tibble]] in the latter half of 1933. It was immediately taken up by [[Rodrigo Moynihan]] [...] and at the same time or shortly after by [[Edgar Hubert]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/hubert-painting-t06602/text-catalogue-entry|title=Stephens, Chris (1997) Edgar Hubert, Painting 1935-6: Catalogue entry, Tate website|accessdate=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.ucl.ac.uk/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqSearch=RefNo==%27TOWNSEND%27&amp;dsqDb=Catalog|title=William Townsend papers, University College London archive |accessdate=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Townsend, early paintings by the group were derived from external objects but they became increasingly abstract.

The more abstract paintings, that came to represent the movements style, were created using improvised freely applied brushstrokes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/o/objective-abstraction|title=Objective Abstraction, Tate website|accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/moynihan-objective-abstraction-t00172|title=Rodrigo Moynihan, artwork 'Objective Abstraction' c.1935–6, Tate Gallery|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geoffrey Tibble]] described them as 'not abstracted from nature, and which made no reference to and had no associations with anything outside themselves [...] the picture was an object in its own right' (Bowness, 1960:198).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/873008?uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21104397110851|title=Bowness, Alan (1960) The Paintings and Constructions of Victor Pasmore, ''The Burlington Magazine'', vol. 102, no. 168, May, pp. 198-203|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==
In 1934, the exhibition ''Objective Abstractions'' was held at the [[Zwemmer Gallery]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artbiogs.co.uk/2/galleries/zwemmer-gallery|title=Zwemmer Gallery, Artist Biographies website|accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; showing the group's work, except Hubert's. The exhibition also included work by more representational artists, [[Ivon Hitchens]], [[Victor Pasmore]], and [[Ceri Richards]].

{{Writing systems sidebar}}
A '''pictogram''', also called a '''pictogramme''', '''pictograph''', or simply '''picto''',&lt;ref&gt;Gove, Philip Babcock. (1993). ''Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged''. Merriam-Webster Inc. {{ISBN|0-87779-201-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in computer usage an '''[[Computer icon|icon]]''', is an [[ideogram]] that conveys its meaning through its pictorial resemblance to a physical object. Pictographs are often used in writing and graphic systems in which the characters are to a considerable extent pictorial in appearance.  A pictogram may also be used in subjects such as leisure, tourism, and geography.

Pictography is a form of [[Writing system|writing]] which uses representational, pictorial [[Drawing (manufacturing)|drawings]], similarly to [[cuneiform]] and, to some extent, [[Hieroglyph|hieroglyphic writing]], which also uses drawings as phonetic letters or [[determinative]] rhymes. Some pictograms, such as [[GHS hazard pictograms|Hazards pictograms]], are elements of [[Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation|formal languages]].

Pictograph has a rather different meaning in the field of [[prehistoric art]], including recent art by traditional societies and then means art painted on rock surfaces, as opposed to [[petroglyph]]s; the latter are carved or incised. Such images may or may not be considered pictograms in the general sense.

==Historical==
[[File:Agawa Rock, panel VIII.jpg|thumb|alt=A boat and an animal with horns, painted with red ochre|[[Ojibwa]] pictographs on cliff-face at Agawa Rock, [[Lake Superior Provincial Park]]]]

Early written [[symbols]] were based on pictographs (pictures which resemble what they signify) and [[ideograms]] (symbols which represent ideas). Ancient Sumerian, Egyptian, and Chinese civilizations began to adapt such symbols to represent concepts, developing them into [[logogram|logographic writing systems]]. Pictographs are still in use as the main medium of written communication in some non-literate cultures in [[Africa]], the [[Americas]], and [[Oceania]]. Pictographs are often used as simple, pictorial, representational symbols by most contemporary cultures.

[[File:Signatures from the Past.jpg|thumb|left| Several prehistoric engravings can be found around [[La Silla Observatory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Signatures from the Past|url=https://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1705a/|website=www.eso.org|accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Pictographs can be considered an art form, or can be considered a written language and are designated as such in [[Pre-Columbian art]], [[Native American art]], Ancient [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Painting in the Americas before Colonization]]. One example of many is the [[Rock art of the Chumash people]], part of the [[:Category:Native American history of California|Native American history of California]].
In 2011, UNESCO's World Heritage List added "[[Petroglyph]] Complexes of the Mongolian Altai, Mongolia"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1382|title=Petroglyphic Complexes of the Mongolian Altai|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre|website=whc.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; to celebrate the importance of the pictograms engraved in rocks.

Some scientists in the field of neuropsychiatry and neuropsychology, such as Prof. Dr. [[Mario Christian Meyer]], are studying the symbolic meaning of indigenous pictograms and petroglyphs,&lt;ref&gt;http://unesdoc.UNESCO.org/images/0006/000678/067843F.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; aiming to create new ways of communication between native people and modern scientists to safeguard and valorize their cultural diversity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pisad.bio.br/artigos/amazonupclose_outoftheforest.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern uses ==
An early modern example of the extensive use of pictographs may be seen in the map in the London suburban timetables of the London and North Eastern Railway, 1936-1947, designed by [[George Dow]], in which a variety of pictographs was used to indicate facilities available at or near each station.  Pictographs remain in common use today, serving as pictorial, representational [[signage|sign]]s, instructions, or statistical diagrams. Because of their graphical nature and fairly realistic style, they are widely used to indicate public toilets, or places such as airports and train stations.  Because they are a concise way to communicate a concept to people who speak many different languages, pictograms are also used extensively at the [[Olympics]], and are redesigned for each set of games.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pages.uncc.edu/visualrhetoric/projects/illustration-video/olympic-pictograms/ Visual Rhetoric - Olympic Pictograms]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://mediamadegreat.com/olympic-pictograms/ Olympic Pictograms: Design through History]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://1stmuse.com/pictograms/ Olympic Games Pictograms]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pictographic writing as a modernist poetic technique is credited to [[Ezra Pound]], though French [[surrealism|surrealists]] accurately credit the [[Pacific Northwest]] [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] of [[Alaska]] who introduced writing, via [[totem pole]]s, to [[North America]].&lt;ref&gt;Reed 2003, p. xix&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary artist [[Xu Bing]] created Book from the Ground, a universal language made up of pictograms collected from around the world. A Book from the Ground chat program has been exhibited in museums and galleries internationally.

Pictograms are used in many areas of modern life for commodity purposes, often as a [[formal language]] (see the [[#In mathematics|In mathematics]] section).

==In mathematics==
[[File:Titanic casualties.svg|thumb|300px|alt=table with boxes instead of numbers, the amounts and sizes of boxes represent amounts of people|A compound pictogram showing the breakdown of the survivors and deaths of the maiden voyage of the [[RMS Titanic]] by class and age/gender.]]

In statistics, pictograms are charts in which icons represent numbers to make it more interesting and easier to understand. A key is often included to indicate what each icon represents. All icons must be of the same size, but a fraction of an icon can be used to show the respective fraction of that amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/skillswise/factsheet/ma37grap-e3-f-pictograms|title=Understanding pictograms|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the following table:
{| class="wikitable"
! Day !! Letters sent
|-
| Monday || 10
|-
| Tuesday || 17
|-
| Wednesday || 29
|-
| Thursday || 41
|-
| Friday || 18
|}
can be graphed as follows:
{| class="wikitable sortable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed"
|+
! Day !! Letters sent
|-
| Monday || [[File:Email Silk.svg|alt=one envelope]]
|-
| Tuesday || [[File:Email Silk.svg|alt=one envelope]]&amp;nbsp;[[File:Image from the Silk icon theme by Mark James half left.svg|alt=and a half]]
|-
| Wednesday || [[File:Email Silk.svg|alt=three envelopes]]&amp;nbsp;[[File:Email Silk.svg|alt=]]&amp;nbsp;[[File:Email Silk.svg|alt=]]
|-
| Thursday || [[File:Email Silk.svg|alt=four envelopes]]&amp;nbsp;[[File:Email Silk.svg|alt=]]&amp;nbsp;[[File:Email Silk.svg|alt=]]&amp;nbsp;[[File:Email Silk.svg|alt=]]
|-
| Friday || [[File:Email Silk.svg|alt=two envelopes]]&amp;nbsp;[[File:Email Silk.svg|alt=]]
|}
Key: [[File:Email Silk.svg|alt=one envelope]] = 10 letters

As the values are rounded to the nearest 5 letters, the second icon on Tuesday is the left half of the original.

==Standardization==
Pictographs can often transcend languages in that they can communicate to speakers of a number of tongues and language families equally effectively, even if the languages and cultures are completely different. This is why [[Road signs in the United States|road signs]] and similar pictographic material are often applied as global standards expected to be understood by nearly all.

A standard set of pictographs was defined in the [[international standard]] ''[[ISO 7001]]: Public Information Symbols''. Other common sets of pictographs are the [[laundry symbols]] used on clothing tags and the [[GHS hazard pictograms|chemical hazard symbols]] as standardized by the [[Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals|GHS system]].

Pictograms have been popularized in use on the [[World Wide Web|web]] and in [[software]], better known as "[[Computer icon|icon]]s" displayed on a computer screen in order to help user navigate a computer system or mobile device.

Poster Boy is also referred to a 'Poster Boy movement' where other people produce similar unsigned work in the New York City subways imitating this original artist. Even after their first arrest, of Brooklyn resident Henry Matyjewicz, the collective remains active online and on the streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jen|last=Carlson|url=http://gothamist.com/2010/05/18/poster_boy_3.php|title=Poster Boy: Still In Jail, Still Emailing Us|date=18 May 2010|work=The Gothamist|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227080610/http://gothamist.com/2010/05/18/poster_boy_3.php|archivedate=27 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poster Boy NYC on Flickr|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/posterboynyc/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Poster Boy's work is featured in [[Banksy]]'s 2010 documentary ''[[Exit Through the Gift Shop]]''.

==Work==
"At first, it was just something to keep me occupied while waiting on the subway."&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; "I was playing with the posters, cutting them up"&lt;ref name="Raftery"&gt;{{cite news| author= Brian Raftery | url=http://nymag.com/arts/art/profiles/50969/ | title= Slice and Dice | work= New York Magazine | date=2008-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; (he carried a razor used at work) and discovered that unlike the cardboard posters in the subway trains, the advertising posters on the subway platforms were printed on a self-adhesive material that could be stuck back down after being torn or cut out. He began to play with available images and text to create humorous "mash-ups" of advertisements. In 2008 alone, he has created over 200 manipulated underground posters in NYC subway. He compares the creation of poster "mash-ups" to [[hip hop]] "[[freestyling]]" on a microphone.&lt;ref name="Sherwin"&gt;{{cite news | author= Brian Sherwin | url= http://gothamist.com/2009/01/23/posterboy_street_artist.php | title= Poster Boy, Street Artist (interview). | work= The Gothamist | date= 2009-01-23 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090126151446/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/23/posterboy_street_artist.php | archivedate= 2009-01-26 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He does not have preconceived notions of what the work will be ("I don't have anything planned…go there, see something, get inspired and do the work"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poster Boy, interview in "Spending Time with Poster Boy" video, 1:44. Recorded January 2009|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21iVQ0iXs00|via=youtube}}&lt;/ref&gt;), but uses the available images, often in a way that relates to current events. One commentator noted: "The pieces generally have a critical edge to them, making comments on the state of society and on the advertisements themselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=PSFK Blog|title=Poster Boy: Remixing Subway Ads|date=September 25, 2008|url=http://www.psfk.com/2008/09/poster-boy-remixing-subway-ads.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be explicitly political (as his pieces on [[Sean Bell]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Poster Boy|title=''untitled (My NYPD Killed Sean Bell)'',  subway poster mash-up|year=2008|url=http://jackmax2.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/2633361143_0a51089a30_m.jpg}}&lt;/ref&gt; "IRAN = NAM",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Poster Boy|title=''untitled (Ultimate Wars; Iran=Nam)'', subway poster mash-up|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2009/jan/17/street-art-poster-boy-in-pictures?picture=341833011|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Obama Drama,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Poster Boy|title=''untitled (Obama Drama)'',  subway poster mash-up|year=2008|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/26296445@N05/3033377295/in/datetaken/|via=Flickr}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Gaza&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Poster Boy|title="Gaza Simulacra," collage for magazine cover|year=2009|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/26296445@N05/3191217607/}}&lt;/ref&gt;), or a more general send up of celebrity and corporate culture.

Poster Boy has been called the "Matisse of subway-ad mash-ups,"&lt;ref name="Raftery" /&gt; "a kind of anti-consumerist Zorro with a razor blade,"&lt;ref name="NYT4-2-09" /&gt; and "an anti-consumerist guerilla artist."&lt;ref name="Adbusters06-02-09"&gt;{{cite web|title=Poster Boy: The 27-year-old Brooklyn artist was arrested on Saturday|work=AdBusters Blog|first=Sarah|last=Nardi|date=6 February 2009|url=http://www.adbusters.org/blogs/aesthetico/poster_boy.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Culture reporter Ben Walters has said of his work "Poster Boy's work straddles two boisterous artistic subcultures: [[street art]] and [[culture jamming]]."&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; Poster Boy has said of his technique, "No matter what I do to the piece, as long as I did something to those advertisements and that saturation, it's political. It's anti-media, anti–established art world."&lt;ref name="Raftery" /&gt;

Poster Boy calls the work "A social thing, as opposed to being an artist making things for bored rich people to hang above their couch."&lt;ref name="Raftery" /&gt; Besides the message of the individual piece, the aspect of producing anonymous public art that other people could do is part of the work. In a video interview, he has said of his work, "I want it to be free of copyright and free of authorship, as much as possible."&lt;ref name="Friends1"&gt;{{cite av media|title=Friends We Love ft. Poster Boy NYC :: Artist + Vigilante (video interview)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOhOYyZL01g|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The overall goal for Poster Boy is to inspire others. I'd love to see people take up the Poster Boy model and create change within their environment."&lt;ref name="Sherwin" /&gt; As his fame has grown, others have begun to emulate the technique. Whether these are unconnected individuals copying one original artist, or part of the "Poster Boy model" or "movement" has not been publicly confirmed.

Poster Boy's work is transitive (usually ripped down by MTA employees) but recorded in photographs. Photos of most of his work put up on the Poster Boy photostream on the Flickr photo sharing website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/26296445@N05/|title=Poster Boy's NYC Photostream on Flickr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poster Boy has collaborated with [[Aakash Nihalani]], a street artist who uses brightly colored electrical tape to create geometric patterns, and has worked on large outdoor monochrome pieces covering illegal NPA billboards with [[Jordan Seiler]] of the Public Ad Campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Seiler, Jordan|title=PosterBoy Collaboration|work=Public Ad Campaign blog |date=21 November 2008|url=http://www.publicadcampaign.com/completedprojects/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poster Boy's work had recently grown in scale and he has applied his technique to large billboards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite av media|title=Video: PosterBoy Deconstructs Brooklyn Billboard|time=1:04|work=The Gothamist|date=January 2009|url=http://gothamist.com/2009/01/19/video_poster_boy_deconstructs_billb.php|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123172944/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/19/video_poster_boy_deconstructs_billb.php|archivedate=2009-01-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He seems to have been unaware of the somewhat similar and earlier billboard work of the UK group [[Cutup]].

In March 2009, a major installation of subway advertising by the [[Museum of Modern Art]] at the Atlantic / Pacific subway stop in Brooklyn, consisting just of reproductions of works shown in MOMA, was doctored by what was claimed to be "the mysterious Poster Boy collective" along with [[Doug Jaeger]] of [[thehappycorp]]. The cutups included part of a Goodyear tire appearing to be floating with [[Claude Monet|Monet]]'s ''waterlilies''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Finch, Charlie|title=No Smiles at MOMA|work=artnet|year=2009|url=http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/features/finch/finch3-3-09.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial Poster Boy work was all illicit, and he claimed "I don't want to make any money off of it. I don't want to bring it into the galleries.".&lt;ref name="Friends1"/&gt; However, after his arrest in January 2009 his work has been shown in galleries, including a one-person show in Eastern District Brooklyn, April 3–26, 2009. He was also included in the group show, Razors, Tape, Glass, at [[Jajo Gallery]] in Newark New Jersey. This move has been criticized in the street art blogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animalnewyork.com/2009/04/poster-boy-should-remain-underground/|date=9 April 2009|title=POSTER BOY SHOULD REMAIN UNDERGROUND|author=Turco, Bucky|work=ANIMAL|accessdate=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gawker.com/5211860/is-poster-boy-still-good-in-a-gallery|date=14 April 2009|title=Is Poster Boy Still Good in a Gallery?|last=Nolan|first=Hamilton|work=Gawker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues==
Poster Boy's cutting and pasting of subway advertisements is illegal. Previously their work had been noted by the MTA police, but did not seem a high priority for them. "Vandalism of our property is illegal, and we prosecute to the fullest extent of the law," spokesperson Aaron Donovan told reporter Brian Raftery. "That being said, the problem to date has been minimal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quoted by Brian Raftery, 2008|url=http://nymag.com/arts/art/profiles/50969/}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has had several brushes with the law, but on occasions transit police have let him go. On January 30, 2009, while attending a benefit for Friends We Love artist's video documentaries, a person thought to be Poster Boy was arrested by undercover police agents waiting for him. This "Poster Boy" was charged with two misdemeanor counts of criminal mischief and went before a Judge on February 9, 2009.&lt;ref name ="NYT4-2-09"&gt;{{cite news| author= Randy Kennedy | url=http://nytimes.com/2009/02/04/arts/design/04post.html?8dpc | title= Poster Boy is caught, or is it a stand-in?  | work= New York Times | date=2009-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= Billy Parker | url= http://gothamist.com/2009/01/31/nypd_rolls_up_on_posterboy.php | title= NYPD Rolls Up on Poster Boy | work= The Gothamist | date= 2009-01-31 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090203025844/http://gothamist.com/2009/01/31/nypd_rolls_up_on_posterboy.php | archivedate= 2009-02-03 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYPost17-1-09"&gt;{{cite news| author= Ginsberg, Alex | url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/02102009/news/regionalnews/a_defiant_hell_154381.htm | title= A Defiant 'Hell | work= New York Post | date=2009-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the hearing, Poster Boy member Henry Matyjewicz, 27, rejected a plea bargain, where he would plead guilty to a misdemeanor charge of criminal mischief, and perform 100 hours of "community service." His lawyer, Kerry Gotlib, said his Mr. Matyjewicz was "innocent of the charges". Mr. Matyjewicz is scheduled to appear back in court in April. If the case goes to a trial the top penalties for the charges could be jail for up to one year.&lt;ref name="NYPost17-1-09" /&gt; However, on December 16, 2009, Matyjewicz pleaded guilty to the offenses. In exchange, the judge agreed to vacate the felony provided Matyjewicz served 210 hours of community service. Once completed, he would get three years' probation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2010/05/10/in-a-sharp-turnabout-poster-boy-sentenced-to-jail/ | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Nikki | last=Waller | title=Poster Boy Loses Plea Deal, Is Sentenced to Jail | date=May 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometime around January 2009, Poster Boy's underground fame became such that there seemed to be several imitators, and his idea of having others "take up the Poster Boy model" seemed to be catching on. There even seems to be some confusion over whether the Poster Boy, arrested on January 30, 2009, was the same Poster Boy who initiated the subway collages, or a "legal" above ground stand in. ''The New York Times'' reports a call from Poster Boy saying the man who was arrested "is one of the many individuals who believe in the Poster Boy 'movement'"&lt;ref name="NYT4-2-09" /&gt; The [[Adbusters]] website notes that "Sources close to the artist maintain that there are, in fact, multiple 'Poster Boys' presently engaged in the project."&lt;ref name="Adbusters06-02-09" /&gt; In an interview after the arrest, Henry Matyjewicz has said that "Henry is an artist just inspired by what's going on with the Poster Boy movement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author= Matt Harvey  | url=http://www.nypress.com/article-19432-who-is-poster-boy.html| title=Who Is Poster Boy? | work=New York Press| date=2009-02-18 | accessdate=2009-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whatever the case may be, Matyjewicz (who his lawyer, Kerry Gotlib, has admitted in court and to the media as being THE "Poster Boy"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2010/05/10/in-a-sharp-turnabout-poster-boy-sentenced-to-jail/ | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Nikki | last=Waller | title=Poster Boy Loses Plea Deal, Is Sentenced to Jail | date=May 10, 2010}}{{qn|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;) continued to have run-ins with the law. On December 16, 2009, the very day he pleaded guilty in exchange for community service, Matyjewicz was arrested for turnstile-jumping allegedly on account of illegally using a discounted student [[MetroCard (New York City)#Student MetroCards|MetroCard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/subway_ad_slicer_cuts_loose_again_sVFbhZsN69Uj4SU505EGuJ | work=New York Post | first=Alex | last=Ginsberg | title=Subway-ad slicer &amp;apos;cuts loose&amp;apos; again | date=January 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, on January 22, 2010, while still on said probation, Matyjewicz was once more arrested for slicing up posters. While the DA was pressing for jail time on account of said arrest, due to a technicality, Matyjewicz was to receive only probation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/poster_boy_dodges_jail_on_judge_7sfh5BSPx0V7y9Zy7XcuuL?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=#ixzz0nFTPUIb4 | work=New York Post | first=Alex | last=Ginsberg | title=Poster Boy dodges jail on judge&amp;apos;s goof | date=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 10, 2010, after skipping out on his May 6 court date, Matyjewicz (who had been expecting to be placed on probation again due an earlier court ruling) appeared in a Brooklyn court and was instead sentenced to 11 months' incarceration at [[Rikers Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://animalnewyork.com/2010/poster-boy-sentenced-to-11-months-in-jail/#comments | title=POSTER BOY SENTENCED TO 11 MONTHS IN JAIL | work=ANIMAL | date=May 10, 2010 | accessdate=July 10, 2016 | author=Turco, Bucky}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matyjewicz got out of jail on appeal of the sentence after 13 days.&lt;ref name="brooklyneagle.com"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.brooklyneagle.com/?category_id=4&amp;id=38163 | title=Brooklyn Daily Eagle | work=Brooklyn Daily Eagle | accessdate=July 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an opinion dated January 25, 2011, the [[New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division|Second Department of the NY Supreme Court's Appellate Division]] sustained the appeal and vacated the trial court's decision and order of incarceration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nycourts.gov/reporter/3dseries/2011/2011_00535.htm | title=The People of the State of New York, Respondent, v Henry Matyjewicz, Appellant. | work=NYCOURTS.GOV | accessdate=July 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appellate court remanded the case to the trial court (but before a difference judge) for resentencing in accordance with the original, negotiated plea deal of just probation and community service.

'''''Pregnancy, Birth and Abortion''''' is a 1958 book about human [[pregnancy]] by the anthropologist [[Paul Gebhard]], the sexologist [[Wardell Pomeroy]], the sexologist [[Clyde Martin]], and Cornelia Christenson. It was a publication of the [[Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction|Institute for Sex Research]]. The work was prepared and written with careful attention to sampling, methodology and date interpretation, to demonstrate the Institute for Sex Research's scientific competence despite the death of [[Alfred Kinsey]] and to answer the criticism that the Institute was interested only in popular, moneymaking books. Though it did not receive the public acceptance of ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Male'' and ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Female'', the work was well received in scientific circles, and demonstrated that the Institute could survive as a productive research organization.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pom82|Pomeroy 1982. p. 450.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pub Design Awards (PDA)''' are an annual [[award]]s, established in 1983 and hosted by [[Campaign for Real Ale|CAMRA]] in association with [[English Heritage]] and the [[Victorian Society]], that are given to exceptional [[pub]]s in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] that have been newly built/converted or have recently undergone building/conservation work.

==Categories==
The awards cover 4 Categories:
#'''New Build''' ''(For newly constructed pubs)''
#'''Conversion of existing buildings to pub use''' ''(For use of a building that had not previously been a pub)''
#'''Refurbishment of existing public houses''' ''(For recently refurbished pubs. The final interior must suit the era of the building and enhance the 'feel' of the pub)''
#'''The ''English Heritage'' Award for conservation''' ''(For pubs that have retained much of their original design and/or decor, and have recently had conservation work to improve the overall condition of the interior.)''

There is also a fifth award which is given independently of the above categories and cannot be entered directly; the '''Joe Goodwin Conservation Award''', sometimes known as '' '[[Joe Goodwin]] Award for best 'Street-Corner Local' ''. This is chosen from all entries, not just winners of other categories.

Any pub can only enter one category, entries may be from anywhere in the [[British Isles]]. Anyone can enter a pub for the awards.

==Entry==
[[Photograph]]s and a typed description(Max. 2 A4 sheets) of the interior and exterior and what work was completed are required for entry, as are drawings of the interior plan and location map of the pub.

To qualify, the work must have been finished between 1 January and 31 December of the year before, e.g. For ''2007'', the work on the pub must have been completed sometime in ''2006''.

==Judging==
Judging takes place initially by shortlisting, after which the selection will be visited, the panel comprises members of the [[CAMRA Pubs Group]] along with conservation experts and architects outside ''CAMRA''.

Not every award is given every year(depending on the entries), but there are often mentions for highly commended pubs, and some years there are joint winners when there are a number of exceptional pubs in particular categories.

The winners receive a plaque which can be displayed publicly in the pub, permanently.

==Winners==
Where the entry reads ''None Awarded'', this means no award was given in that category for that year, even though there may be 'Highly Commended' pubs in that category(which are not listed here). ''None listed'', this means there was no information about that particular award.

'''Public art in Vancouver''' is an important aspect of the urban environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://regardingplace.com/?p=4827 re:place Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt; Large portions of [[public art]] are funded by the provincial and federal government. Up to 1% of the budget of a building can go towards the construction of public art.

==The Public Art Program==
Vancouver’s Public Art Program seeks to incorporate contemporary art practices into city planning and development. The program supports art-making of many kinds - emerging and established artists, in new and traditional media from stand-alone commissions to artist collaborations. The program is part of Cultural Services and oversees development of public art opportunities throughout the city. Civic projects at civic buildings, greenways, parks and other public spaces are funded through capital budgets. Private sector projects are funded by developments in the rezoning process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vancouver.ca/commsvcs/oca/Publicart/index.htm Public Art program Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Coinciding with the [[2010 Vancouver Olympics]], the Public Art Program has commissioned various local artists to produce works, with projects such as [[Paul Wong (artist)|Paul Wong]]'s ''5'' project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.5.paulwongprojects.com/ Paul Wong Projects]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Public folklore''' is the term for the work done by [[folkloristics|folklorists]] in public settings in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] outside of universities and colleges, such as arts councils, [[museums]], [[folklife festivals]], radio stations, etc.  The term is actually short for ''"public sector folklore"'' and was first used by members of the [[American Folklore Society]] in the early 1970s.  [[Archie Green]] is generally credited as the founder of the public folklore movement, although his work builds on that of [[Ben Botkin]] and [[Alan Lomax]], going back as far as the 1930s.  (They called their work "[[applied folklore]]," a related but distinct paradigm.)

The birth of public folklore can be traced back to the creation of the [[American Folklife Center]] at the [[Library of Congress]] in 1970, by an act of [[Congress of the United States|Congress]], sponsored by Sen. [[Ralph Yarborough]] (D-TX) and written by Green and then-Senate aide [[Jim Hightower]].  Other national programs were later established at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] (NEA), where prominent folklorists such as [[Ralph Rinzler]], [[Alan Jabbour]], and [[Bess Lomax Hawes]] worked.  Funding programs were also established in the 1970s and 1980s in over 40 state arts councils, and these facilitated the eventual creation or funding of major non-profit centers for [[folklife]] documentation and presentation, such as [[City Lore]] and the [[Center for Traditional Music and Dance]] in New York, [[Texas Folklife Resources]], [[Northwest Folklife]], the [[Western Folklife Center]], and the [[Philadelphia Folklore Project]].

Public folklorists are engaged with the documentation, preservation, and presentation of traditional forms of [[folk art]]s, [[craft]], [[folk music]], and other genres of traditional [[folklife]].  In later years, public folklorists have also become involved in economic and community development projects.

Each year, some 15 outstanding American folk artists and performers are awarded [[National Heritage Fellowship]]s from the NEA for their lifetime achievement.  Some more widely known awardees over the years have included [[John Lee Hooker]], [[B.B. King]], [[Clifton Chenier]], [[Earl Scruggs]], [[Michael Flatley]], [[Shirley Caesar]], [[Albertina Walker]], [[Carter Family|Janette Carter]], [[Koko Taylor]], [[Brownie McGhee]], [[Sonny Terry]], [[Jean Ritchie]], [[Sunnyland Slim]], [[Lydia Mendoza]], [[Boozoo Chavis]], [[Zakir Hussain (musician)|Zakir Hussain]], [[Helen Cordero]], [[Margaret Tafoya]], [[Santiago Jiménez, Jr.]], [[John Cephas]], [[Bois Sec Ardoin]], [[Mick Moloney]], [[Clarence Fountain]] [[Five Blind Boys of Alabama|&amp; the Blind Boys]], [[Esther Martinez]], and the [[Dixie Hummingbirds]].

The Smithsonian Institution features the [[Smithsonian Folklife Festival]] every June and July which attracts upwards of two million people to hear live performances and view demonstrations of traditional crafts.

Public folklorists also work in "folk arts in the schools" programs, presenting master traditional artists to primary and secondary schools in demonstrations and residencies.  They develop apprenticeship programs to foster the teaching of traditional arts by recognized masters.  They also present traditional music on radio programs such as ''[[American Routes]]'' on [[Public Radio International]].  Occasionally they produce [[documentary film]]s on aspects of traditional arts; Smithsonian folklorist [[Marjorie Hunt]] won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for her 1984 [[Academy Award for Documentary Short Subject|short documentary]] film ''[[The Stone Carvers (film)|The Stone Carvers]]'' about the carvers at the [[National Cathedral]] in Washington, D.C.

'''Reverend Billy and the Church of Stop Shopping''' is a radical performance community based in New York City. The Stop Shopping Choir is accompanied by a comic preacher, Reverend Billy. The philosophy of the Church of Stop Shopping surrounds the imminent "Shopocalypse", which assumes the end of humanity will come about through manic [[consumerism]].&lt;ref name=mcclish&gt; {{Cite journal|last=McClish|first=Carmen L|title=Activism based in embarrassment: The anti-consumption spirituality of the Reverend Billy|journal=Liminalities: A Journal of Performance Studies|volume=5.2 (2009)|pages=1-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stop Shopping Choir accompanies Reverend Billy and stages [[Guerrilla theatre|guerrilla theater]] style actions, singing on the property of the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] stores,&lt;ref name=burke&gt; {{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/monteburke/2011/04/21/reverend-billy-and-his-crusade-against-consumerism/2/|title=Reverend Billy and His Crusade Against Consumerism|last=Burke|first=Monte|date=April 21, 2011|work=Forbes|access-date=October 5, 2017|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Monsanto]] facilities,&lt;ref name=burke/&gt; and [[Trump Tower]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-activists-who-are-staging-acts-of-protest-inside-trump-tower|title=The Activists Who Are Staging Protest in Trump Tower.|last=Moynihan|first=Colin|date=June 14, 2017|work=The New Yorker|access-date=October 5, 2017|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others. They are often considered part of the [[Culture Jamming]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Like moths to a flame: culture jamming and the global spectacle.|last=Wettergren|first=Åsa|work=Representing Resistance: Media, Civil Disobedience, and the Global Justice Movement|publisher=Praeger|year=2003|editor-last=Opel|editor-first=Andrew|location=Westport, Conn.|pages=27-43|editor-last2=Pompper|editor-first2=Donnalyn}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The group uses the content from their direct actions to create songs that are performed on concert stages and in cabarets. The director of these shows is church co-founder Savitri D. The music director is Nehemiah Luckett. Reverend Billy and the Stop Shopping Choir routinely perform at [[Joe's Pub]] at [[The Public Theater]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/lypsinka-reverend-billy-and-tori-scott-coming-to-joes-pub-may-11-18|title=John Epperson, Reverend Billy, and Tori Scott Coming to Joe's Pub May 11–18|last=Viagas|first=Robert|date=October 5, 2017|website=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of Reverend Billy==

[[File:RevBilly1.jpg|thumb|left|Reverend Billy attempting to exorcise bad loans and toxic assets from the Bank of America ATM in Union Square, New York City, 2009]]

The character of Reverend Billy was developed in the early 1990s by actor and playwright, William Talen. His family was Dutch Calvinist,&lt;ref name=kalb&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/27/arts/spring-theater-visions-america-downtown-gospel-according-reverend-billy.html|title=The Downtown Gospel According to Reverend Billy|last=Kalb|first=Jonathan|date=February 27, 2000|work=The New York Times|access-date=October 5, 2017|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Christian Reformed Church in North America|Christian Reformed Church]], a conservative sect concentrated in Holland and Grand Rapids, Michigan. The precepts of this kind of [[Christianity]] were the basis for Dutch [[Afrikaners]] system of [[Apartheid]] in South Africa.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

Talen grew up in small towns throughout Minnesota, South Dakota and Wisconsin. He left home at 16, moving east with Charles and Patricia Gaines, a writer and painter who encouraged him as an artist. Talen began to perform his poems and stories, hitch-hiking from Philadelphia to New York to San Francisco.&lt;ref name=jacobs&gt; {{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/profile-of-william-talen-better-known-as-reverend-billy-2015-2?r=UK&amp;IR=T|title=The craziest thing about this legendary singing, anti-corporate preacher is that he isn't real|last=Jacobs|first=Harrison|date=February 4, 2015|work=Business Insider|access-date=March 29, 2018|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Talen's chief collaborator in developing the Reverend Billy character was the Reverend Sidney Lanier, a cousin of [[Tennessee Williams]].&lt;ref name=kalb/&gt; Lanier was vicar of The [[Church of St. Clement Mary Hofbauer|St. Clement's]] in the 1960s, an Episcopal Church in [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref name=kalb/&gt; In an effort to increase attendance at St. Clement's, Lanier had torn out the altar and pews, inviting actors to perform scenes from plays by Tennessee Williams and Terrence McNally, and founding founding the American Place Theater. Lanier described Talen as "more of a preacher with a gift for social prophecy than an actor.&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref name=kalb/&gt; In the early 1990s Talen moved with Lanier to New York City from the San Francisco Bay Area, branding his act as a "new kind of American preacher"&lt;ref name=jacobs/&gt;

The Reverend Billy character debuted on the sidewalk at Times Square in 1998, outside the Disney Store, where he proclaimed Mickey Mouse to be the anti-Christ.&lt;ref name=kalb/&gt; He was arrested multiple times outside the Disney Store, where he duct-tapped Mickey Mouse to a cross.&lt;ref name=Kasperkevic&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/27/reverend-billy-church-of-stop-shopping-black-friday|title=The Church of Stop Shopping doesn't pull punches on its return to New York.|last=Kasperkevic|first=Jana|date=November 27, 2015|work=The Guardian|access-date=October 8, 2017|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reverend Billy's sermons decried the evils of [[consumerism]] and the racism of sweatshop labor, and what Talen saw as the loss of neighborhood spirit in [[Rudy Giuliani|Rudolph Giuliani]]'s New York.&lt;ref name=jacobs/&gt;

The Reverend Billy character isn't so much a parody of a preacher, as a preacher motif used to blur the lines between performance and religious experience. "It's definitely a church service," Talen explained to ''Altnernet'', but, he added, it's "a political rally, it's theater, it's all three, it's none of them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.alternet.org/story/29476/the_reluctant_religion_of_reverend_billy|title=The Reluctant Religion of Reverend Billy|last=Tytel|first=Brad|date=December 12, 2005|work=Alternet|access-date=April 1, 2018|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alisa Solomon, the theater critic at the [[The Village Voice|Village Voice]], said of Reverend Billy's persona, "The collar is fake, the calling is real."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2000/03/14/never-can-say-good-buy/|title=Never Can Say Good Buy|last=Solomon|first=Alisa|date=March 14, 2000|work=The Village Voice|access-date=October 8, 2017|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the Church of Stop Shopping, they have been referred to by academics as  "performance activism,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perucci|first=Tony|year=2009|title=What the Fuck is That?: The Poetics of Ruptural Performance|journal=Liminalities: A Journal of Performance Studies|volume=5.3|pages=1-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; "carnivalesque protest,"&lt;ref name="mcclish" /&gt; and "commercial disobedience."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/22/magazine/reverend-billy-s-unholy-war.html|title=Reverend Billy's Unholy War.|last=Dee|first=Jonathan|date=August 22, 2004|work=The New York Times Magazine|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Savitri D, church co-founder and theatrical director==

Savitri D (née Durkee) is the co-founder and director of the Church of Stop Shopping, as well as Talen's partner.&lt;ref name=kolbert&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/05/19/buzzkill-2|title=Buzzkill|last=Kolbert|first=Elizabeth|date=May 19, 2014|work=The New Yorker|access-date=March 29, 2018|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was born in [[Taos, New Mexico]] in 1972. She was raised at [[Lama Foundation|The Lama Foundation]], one of the earliest and longest lasting intentional spiritual communities in the US, founded by her parents, Steven and Barbara Durkee.&lt;ref&gt;Banner, Lois W. "Finding Fran: History and Memory in the Lives of Two Women", Columbia University Press, 1998, p. 173. {{ISBN|0-231-11216-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Savitri D began dancing and performing at the University of Montana, studied at the [[Merce Cunningham]] Dance Company, and co-founded a dance collective called The Zen Monkey Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zenmonkeyproject.com/history/|title=History of Past Performances|website=Zen Monkey Project|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After moving to New York City in 1997, she staged her play SKY/NO SKY at 57 Walker Street&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://franklinfurnace.org/goings_on/recent_goings_on/2003/03_03_13.php|title=Franklin Furnace's Goings On|date=March 13, 2003|website=Franklin's Furnace|dead-url=|access-date=March 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2000, she was a producer at The Culture Project, a theater in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]], where Talen was staging early Reverend Billy performances.&lt;ref name=jacobs/&gt; She took over direction of The Church of Stop Shopping performances from the dramatist Tony Torn&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theatermania.com/new-york-city-theater/reviews/03-2000/reverend-billy_350.html|title=Reviews: Reverend Billy|last=Josh|first=Godfrey|date=March 17, 2000|work=Theater Mania|access-date=March 31, 2018|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, and married Talen the next year.&lt;ref name=jacobs/&gt;

Under Savitri D's leadership, the Church won the Alpert Award for Theater&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://herbalpertawards.org/artist/2010/bill-talen|title=The Herb Alpert Award in the Arts|website=The Herb Alpert Awards|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Edwin Booth Award&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Doctoral-Programs/Theatre/Doctoral-Theatre-Students-Association-(DTSA)/Booth-Award|title=Booth Award, Previous Award Recipients|website=The Graduate Center, CUNY|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[City University of New York]].

==The Stop Shopping Choir==

The Stop Shopping Choir is a 35-member ensemble that performs an array of original gospel songs in theater performances and alongside Reverend Billy in public spaces during campaigns.&lt;ref name=revbilly.com&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.revbilly.com/about_the_stop_shopping_choir|title=About The Stop Shopping Choir|website=revbilly.com|dead-url=|access-date=April 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/16/nyregion/reverend-billy-brings-a-new-sermon-to-joes-pub.html|title=Reverend Billy Brings a New Sermon to Joe's Pub|last=Lee|first=A.C.|date=May 15, 2014|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 2, 2018|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The choir began accompanying Talen's sermons at concert shows shortly after the [[September 11 attacks]], adding a musical influence to Reverend Billy performances.&lt;ref name=jacobs/&gt; Led by musical director Nehemiah Luckett,&lt;ref name=revbilly.com/&gt; the choir members are volunteers who rehearse weekly at the Lower Eastside Girl's Club in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/if-monsanto-loses-its-name-what-will-its-haters-have-left-to-hate-1477402968|title=If Monsanto Loses Its Name, What Will Its Haters Have Left to Hate?|last=Bunge|first=Jacob|date=October 15, 2016|work=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=April 2, 2018|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Choir often write songs that draw attention to the environmental and consumerist campaigns championed by the Church of Stop Shopping. They have accompanied Talen into the lobbies of multinational banks such as JP Morgan Chase or research facilities belonging to Monsanto, dressed as golden toads and honeybees, singing songs in support of the day's sermon. One of their best-known songs is The First Amendment, an incantation of the 1st Amendment of the [[United States Constitution]], sung rapturously by soprano Laura Newman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.revbilly.com/the_first_amendment_song|title=The First Amendment Song|website=revbilly.com|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Direct Action Campaigns==

In addition to protest performances throughout a given year, Reverend Billy and the Church of Stop Shopping have organized various campaigns focused on consumerist or environmental issues, often highlighting a particular company they feel best symbolizes the issue. The group stage actions in public spaces near the targets of their actions, or in the lobbies, halls, and plazas of the building owned by the companies they protest. Their sermons and songs routinely draw the attention of police and security forces assigned to those spaces, leading to arrests and significant media coverage. Talen and Savitri D have been arrested more than 50 times during their actions, though their charges are almost always reduced or dropped.&lt;ref name=jacobs/&gt;

===Early campaigns===
Reverend Billy and the Church of Stop Shopping staged numerous actions around New York City in their formative years. In 2000, after performing a Christmas show the [[The New School|New School]]'s Tishman Auditorium, Reverend Billy led the congregation and members of the audience from the stage to the [[Edgar Allan Poe House (Manhattan)|Poe House]] on West 3rd Street in Manhattan's [[West Village]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/merry-christmas-rev-billy-performance-preacher-hosts-poe-service-dec-16-com-93856|title=Merry Christmas, Rev. Billy: Performance Preacher Hosts Poe Service Dec. 16|last=Ehren|first=Christine|date=December 16, 2000|work=Playbill|access-date=April 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, the Reverend held a protest reading of "[[The Raven]]" atop the scaffolding over the soon-to-be-demolished home where [[Edgar Allan Poe|Edgar Allen Poe]] had finished writing the famous poem. After the reading, Talen was arrested and jailed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.playloud.org/archiveandstore/en/dvd/60-reverend-billy.html|title=Reverend Billy &amp; The Church of Stop Shopping|last=Post|first=Dietmar|last2=Palacios|first2=Lucía|year=2002|website=playloud!|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[September 11 attacks|September 11]], the Church and Choir met routinely in the [[PATH (rail system)|Path Station]] near [[World Trade Center site|Ground Zero]] and sang the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]] into their phones as commuters passed by. The crowd of singers sometimes reached up to 200 participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/He-s-a-preacher-of-sorts-who-has-found-his-2764879.php|title=He's a preacher -- of sorts -- who has found his calling: rooting out the evils of consumerism, block by entertaining block|last=Ganahl|first=Jane|date=April 24, 2004|work=San Francisco Chronicle|access-date=April 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 29, 2007, just before the start of the monthly [[Critical Mass (cycling)|Critical Mass bike]] ride, Reverend Billy and Savitri D recited the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] repeatedly to police officers through a megaphone in Manhattan's Union Square. Reverend Billy was arrested on charges of second-degree harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/26/nyregion/26billy.html|title=A Street Performer Crusades for the First Amendment|last=Hartocollis|first=Anemona|date=September 26, 2007|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The civil liberties lawyer [[Norman Siegel]] defended Reverend Billy in court, saying "Reverend Billy has a First Amendment right to recite the First Amendment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/01/nyregion/01billy.html|title=A Pretend Preacher, a Real Arrest and a Debate About Free Speech|last=Wilensky-Lanford|first=Ethan|date=July 1, 2007|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Starbucks===
The Church of Stop Shopping staged a series of actions across the country from 2002 to 2008, protesting against what they call Starbucks company's enactment of "fake bohemia." Reverend Billy and the singers tried to "exorcise the demon of cookie-cutter capitalism" from its cash registers, by laying hands on the register, weeping, and harmonizing.&lt;ref name=Kasperkevic/&gt;

The [[Starbucks]] coffee chain has been a frequent target of the Church's actions, due to displacement of small local businesses,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.urbandisplacement.org/case-studies/ucla#section-91|title=Impact of Big Businesses in Chinatown|last=Macedo|first=Edber|last2=Fang|first2=Jimmy|date=July 1, 2014|website=UCLA Case Studies|dead-url=|access-date=November 12, 2017|last3=Le|first3=Thomas|last4=Ong|first4=Paul M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[union busting]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/zp-heller/spilling-the-beans-about_b_205497.html|title=Spilling the Beans About Starbucks' Union-Busting Tactics|last=Heller|first=ZP|date=May 25, 2011|work=HuffPost|access-date=November 12, 2017|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and exploitation of coffee farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/8355026|title=Storm in a coffee cup: Starbucks vs Ethiopia.|date=November 30, 2006|work=The Economist|access-date=April 23, 2018|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Starbucks branches throughout New York City issued a document to its workers entitled "What Should I do If Reverend Billy Is in My Store?",&lt;ref name=talen&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thenewpress.com/books/what-should-i-do-if-reverend-billy-my-store|title=What Should I Do if Reverend Billy is in My Store|last=Talen|first=Bill|date=April 1, 2005|website=New York Press|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which outlines an evacuation protocol and a series of scripted reassurances that workers are ordered to deliver to disturbed or inquisitive customers. The title of the document is also the title of a book written by Talen, published by The New Press.&lt;ref name=talen/&gt;

In 2004, Starbucks persuaded a Los Angeles judge to issue an injunction against Talen, demanding that he cease and desist from "stalking, contacting, or sexually harassing the computerized cash registers of the Starbucks Company."&lt;ref name=talen/&gt;

===Golden Toads and Bank Actions===
In 2012 and 2013, Reverend Billy and the Church focused on the extinction of species brought by climate change, specifically targeting banks they said financed projects that worsened global warming. The symbolic centerpiece of these campaigns was the extinct [[Golden toad]], originally native to [[Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve|Monteverde cloud forest]] in Costa Rica and a symbol for the crisis of [[Decline in amphibian populations|declining amphibian species]]. Savitri D and the choir wore papier mâché masks depicting golden toads as they entered JP Morgan Chase and HSBC banks.&lt;ref name=vidal&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/nov/25/reverend-billy-jpmorgan-chase-toad-protest-talen|title=Reverend Billy faces year in prison for JP Morgan Chase toad protest|last=Vidal|first=John|date=November 25, 2013|work=The Guardian|access-date=April 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In one action in a Chase bank in New York City, Reverend Billy and choir director Nehemiah Luckett were arrested and charged with riot, trespass, unlawful assembly, and disorderly conduct. According to the bank manager in a complaint to police, Reverend Billy and the choir were "running about the bank while wearing frog masks … jumping on to the bank's furniture, running about the bank, and screaming loudly at others for a number of minutes." The manager also stated that he thought the bank was being robbed, that he feared for his safety, and that customers or bank employees even cried.&lt;ref name=vidal/&gt;

Despite the complaints against them and what the New York prosecutor called a "criminal stunt," demanding that Talen go to prison for a year, their charges were eventually dropped.&lt;ref name=kolbert/&gt;

===British Petroleum and Liberate Tate===
As part of the Church of Stop Shopping's efforts to urge art institutions to reject sponsorship from petroleum companies, they have protested at a number of museums around the world.&lt;ref name=vidaltate&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2011/jul/19/reverend-billy-tate-modern-bp|title=Reverend Billy leads exorcism of BP's 'evil spirit' from Tate Modern|last=Vidal|first=John|date=July 19, 2011|work=The Guardian|access-date=April 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In July 2011, while on tour in the UK, Reverend Billy and the Choir staged an action at the Tate Modern in London to protest its sponsorship by the oil company British Petroleum (BP). The church was invited by a coalition of UK groups, including Liberate Tate, BP or Not BP, Platform, UK Tar Sands Network, London Rising Tide, Art Not Oil and Climate Rush.&lt;ref name=vidaltate/&gt;

While crowds observed the scene in the Turbine Room of the Tate, the choir splashed Reverend Billy and the BP sunflower logo with bottles of black oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luoL5A-SHQk|title=Reverend Billy exorcizes BP at Tate Modern|last=Talen|first=Billy|date=July 19, 2011|via=YouTube|dead-url=|access-date=April 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the performance, the protesters exited the museum singing onto the lawn outside, and rallied on the shore of the Thames against oil companies and their involvement in the arts.&lt;ref name=vidaltate/&gt;

===Robobees===

In 2014, Reverend Billy, Savitri D and the Choir turned their focus to [[colony collapse disorder]] affecting the world's honeybees. In one action, they entered the Micro-robotics Laboratory at Harvard's School of Engineering and Applied Science to confront scientists working on the invention of robot pollinators, popularly known as RoboBees. They purchased fruits and vegetables to place before a display case with a model of the RoboBee, singing and lamenting the focus of scientists replacing living bees with robots, rather than solving the collapse.&lt;ref name=forde&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/6/2/robotic-bee-project.html|title=Taking off from Harvard Yard: Flight of the RoboBees|last=Forde|first=Kaelyn|date=June 2, 2014|publisher=Al Jazeera|access-date=April 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

“We ask you to place your genius, your research, your scientific know-how into ''saving'' the honeybee," Talen said to those assembled. Attending the event and writing for [[The New Yorker]], [[Elizabeth Kolbert]] noted the confusion among some of the Harvard graduate students witnessing the singing and preaching. "We like people not to know if we're a political rally, a religious service, or a theatrical comedy about a church," Reverend Billy told Kolbert. "If they have all three spinning in their head, and they can't settle on one, then they're probably having a raw experience."&lt;ref name=kolbert/&gt;

===Monsanto===
The Church of Stop Shopping has also targeted chemical manufacturer [[Monsanto]] for its production of [[Glyphosate|glysophate]] herbicides and [[neonicotinoid]] pesticides.&lt;ref name=forde/&gt; In November 2014, the Church traveled to Monsanto's headquarters in [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]], where they held an "Organic Thanksgiving."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/events/1490386454559843/|title=Organic Thanksgiving at Monsanto World Headquarters|date=November 24, 2014|website=|dead-url=|access-date=April 24, 2018}}{{Primary source inline|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Reverend Billy &amp; The Stop Shopping Choir opened a series of shows for [[Neil Young]] during his tour in support of ''[[The Monsanto Years]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://diffuser.fm/fellow-monsanto-opponent-reverend-billy-to-open-for-neil-young-in-nyc/|title=Fellow Monsanto Opponent Reverend Billy to Open for Neil Young in NYC|last=Rossignol|first=Derrick|date=July 3, 2015|website=Diffuser|dead-url=|access-date=April 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 13, 2016, Reverend Billy was arrested while protesting the [[World Food Prize]] in [[Des Moines, Iowa]]. He was charged with trespass for leaving the "free speech area"  set up near the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hyperallergic.com/342380/a-performance-troupe-takes-on-immigration-monsanto-and-standing-rock/|title=A Performance Troupe Takes on Immigration, Monsanto, and Standing Rock|last=Hamm|first=Theodore|date=December 2, 2016|work=Hyperallergenic|access-date=April 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecutor for the state requested "that the Court preclude evidence or argument regarding 'free speech rights,' 'free expression,'right to assemble,' and/or other First Amendment arguments and evidence that 'free speech rights' can constitute 'justification' under the Iowa's criminal trespass statute, Iowa Code §716.7 (2015)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/revbilly/pages/857/attachments/original/1483909235/Motion_in_Limine_-_Trepassing_Cases_(Talen___Cordaro)_(1).PDF?1483909235|title=STATE'S MOTION IN LIMINE, AND/OR FOR 5.104(A) RULING|date=January 2, 2017|website=|dead-url=|access-date=April 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge in the case ultimately dismissed the charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2017/01/monsanto-amendment-170124075931929.html|title=On Monsanto and the First Amendment|last=Talen|first=Billy|date=January 24, 2017|publisher=Al Jazeera|access-date=April 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2016, the Church released a guide called "The United States Map of Poisoned Parks and Playgrounds," which shows the dosage and location of glyphosate applications around the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.revbilly.com/nationalmap|title=U.S. Map of Poisoned Parks and Playgrounds|website=revbilly.com|dead-url=|access-date=April 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard Corney Grain''' (26 October 1844 – 16 March 1895), known by his stage name '''Corney Grain''', was an entertainer and songwriter of the late [[Victorian era]].

==Biography==
[[Image:Corney Grain and Alfred Reed.png|thumb|160px|left|Corney Grain (left) and Alfred German Reed (right) portrayed in ''[[Entr'acte]]'' in 1895, the year they both died]]
Born at [[Teversham]] in [[Cambridgeshire]], Grain was the youngest son of John Grain, a farmer, and his wife, Mary Anne. His sister, Harriet Ann, was the mother of the [[Barristers in England and Wales|barrister]] and judge Sir [[Travers Humphreys]]. Grain received what he referred to as "an average middle-class education". In 1858, at the age of 14, he attended school in [[Germany]].&lt;ref name=grain&gt;Corney Grain, Richard. ''Corney Grain, by Himself'', John Murray, London. (1888)&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to [[United Kingdom|Britain]] with an interest in the [[Law]], he enrolled as a student of the [[Inner Temple]] on 27 April 1863, and was called to the [[Barrister|Bar]] on 30 April 1866.&lt;ref&gt;Foster, J. ''Men-at-the-bar: a biographical hand-list of the members of the various inns of court'', 2nd edn (1885)&lt;/ref&gt; For a while he practised law on the Western Circuit. However, he had theatrical leanings, and sang and acted in private.

===Career===
Deciding to give up a legal career and try his hand on the stage,&lt;ref&gt;Brown, James D. ''British Musical Biography'', Read Books (2007), p. 170  {{ISBN|1-4067-5614-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 16 May 1870 Grain joined what was known as the [[German Reed Entertainments]], at the [[Gallery of Illustration]], appearing in a sketch of his own called ''The School-Feast''.&lt;ref name=watson&gt;Watson, M. "Alfred German Reed and Corney Grain", ''The Theatre'', 4th series, No. 25 (1895), 221–23&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, Grain entertained privately, performing his comic musical sketches at the piano for fashionable parties and other venues.&lt;ref name=watson/&gt;

Grain remained with the [[Thomas German Reed|German Reed]]s until the end of his life and, after the death of another German Reed stalwart, [[John Orlando Parry]], Grain became the company's principal comedian and sketch artist.  He moved with the company to [[St. George's Hall (London)|St George's Hall]], toured with it in the provinces, and in 1877, after the retirement of [[Priscilla Horton|Priscilla German Reed]], became the partner of the German Reeds' son, Alfred German Reed (1847-1895), who shared the management of the company with his mother from 1871.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNBSupp|wstitle=Reed, Thomas German|first=John Joseph |last=Knight}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over twenty-five years, Grain wrote between fifty and sixty entertainments for the company, consisting of social sketches and songs with piano accompaniment.  His songs included "The Masher King of Piccadilly" and "The Four-Horse Sharrybang".  His private performances of comic sketches also remained fashionable throughout his career. His last sketch was ''Music à la mode''.&lt;ref name=watson/&gt;
[[Image:corney-grain.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Richard Corney Grain as depicted by [[Leslie Ward|'Spy']] in ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine, historical)|Vanity Fair]]'' in 1885]]
Grain was a large man with exceptionally large and expressive hands.  On occasion he took part in comediettas or other dramatic performances, but he claimed that he did not enjoy acting and was not very good at it.&lt;ref name=grain/&gt;  [[W. S. Gilbert]] disagreed, asking him to perform in his absurdist comedy with the German Reeds, ''[[Happy Arcadia]]'', as "the handsomest man in the world", because of Grain's comical appearance.  Similarly in Gilbert's ''[[A Sensation Novel]]'', he played the "spirit of romance".&lt;ref&gt;Walters, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;  He also played in Gilbert's ''[[Our Island Home]]'', ''[[Ages Ago]]'' and ''[[Eyes and No Eyes]]'' (amusingly, as [[Pierrot]]).  Grain was a great friend and rival of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] performer and fellow sketch-artist, [[George Grossmith]].

His [[autobiography]], ''Corney Grain, by Himself'', first appeared in ''[[Murray's Magazine]]'' and was later issued as a book in 1888. He died of "epidemic influenza" on 16 March 1895, at his home in Marylebone, London. His death, six days after that of Alfred German Reed, ended the [[German Reed Entertainments]], which had been popular for forty years.&lt;ref name=Lloyd&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/StGeorgesHallLanghamPlaceLondon.htm "St George's Hall, Langham Place, Regent Street, London"], at the ArthurLloyd theatres website&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Royal Scottish National Orchestra''' (RSNO) is a Scottish orchestra, administratively based in [[Glasgow]] at the RSNO Centre.  The RSNO receives support from the [[Scottish Government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2007/03/29094643 | title=National performing companies get official status | publisher=Scottish Government | date=29 April 2007 | accessdate=2008-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The RSNO performs throughout Scotland, at such venues as [[Glasgow Royal Concert Hall]], [[Usher Hall]] ([[Edinburgh]]), [[Caird Hall]] ([[Dundee]]), [[Aberdeen Music Hall]], [[Perth Concert Hall (Scotland)|Perth Concert Hall]] or [[Eden Court Theatre|Eden Court Inverness]]. The current chief executive director of the RSNO is Krishna Thiagarajan.  [[Thomas Søndergård]] is the orchestra's current music director, since 2018.

==History==
The precursor ensemble to the RSNO was established in 1843 to accompany the Glasgow Choral Union (today known as the RSNO Chorus).  In 1891, the orchestra was recognised formally as the ''Scottish Orchestra'', with [[George Henschel]] as the ensemble's first principal conductor under that name. In 1950, the orchestra took the name of the ''Scottish National Orchestra''.  The orchestra received [[patronage|royal patronage]] in 1977.  It continued to use the name 'Scottish National Orchestra' until 1991, when it briefly used the title ''Royal Scottish Orchestra'', before changing to its present name.

The orchestra's longest-serving principal conductor was Sir [[Alexander Gibson (conductor)|Alexander Gibson]], its first native Scottish principal conductor, from 1959 to 1984.  During Gibson's tenure, beginning in 1979, the RSNO's base was at [[Henry Wood Hall, Glasgow|Henry Wood Hall]] in Glasgow and this space was also used as its recording venue.  Gibson was particularly noted for his interpretations of [[Scandinavia]]n composers, notably [[Jean Sibelius]] and [[Carl Nielsen]].  His successor, [[Neeme Järvi]], continued this tradition, and also led the orchestra through its first complete [[Gustav Mahler]] cycle.  Principal conductor from 1984 to 1988, Järvi currently has the title of conductor laureate with the RSNO.  [[Bryden Thomson]], the orchestra's second Scottish principal conductor, maintained the [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] link with a cycle of Nielsen symphonies.

[[Alexander Lazarev]] was principal conductor of the RSNO from 1997 to 2005, and now has the title of conductor emertius with the orchestra.  [[Marin Alsop]] was the RSNO's principal guest conductor from 2000 to 2003, the first woman to hold the title.  Garry Walker succeeded Alsop as principal guest conductor, serving from 2003 to 2007.

In January 2011, the RSNO announced the appointment of [[Peter Oundjian]] as its next music director, as of the 2012–2013 season, with an initial contract of 4 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.rsno.org.uk/index.php?option=com_myblog&amp;show=638:oundjian-succeeds-stephane-deneve-in-2012-at-the-helm-of-scotlands-national-orchestra-.html&amp;Itemid=81 | title=Peter Oundjian to be RSNO’s new Music Director | publisher=Royal Scottish National Orchestra | date=31 January 2011 | accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/leading-violinist-gets-top-role-at-rsno-1.1082938 | title=Leading violinist gets top role at RSNO | publisher=The Herald | author=Phil Miller | date=1 February 2011 | accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In October 2011, [[Thomas Søndergård]] was named the orchestra's principal guest conductor, as of the 2012–2013 season, with an initial contract of 3 years for 3 programmes per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.rsno.org.uk/index.php?option=com_myblog&amp;show=697:thomas-sondergard-joins-rsno-artistic-team.html&amp;Itemid=81 | title=Thomas Søndergård joins RSNO Artistic Team | publisher=Royal Scottish National Orchestra | date=18 October 2011 | accessdate=2011-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015, the orchestra took up new residence at the RSNO Centre and Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.

==RSNO Chorus and RSNO Junior Chorus==
The affiliated choruses of the RSNO are the [[Royal Scottish National Orchestra Chorus|RSNO Chorus]] and the RSNO Junior Chorus.  The RSNO Chorus evolved from a choir formed in 1843 to sing the first full performance of Handel's ''Messiah'' in Scotland, in April 1844.  In addition to its commitment to the RSNO, the Chorus performs independently and has toured worldwide. The current chorus director is [[Gregory Batsleer]].

In 1978, Jean Kidd formed the RSNO Junior Chorus.  Since 1994, its director has been Christopher Bell.  The RSNO Junior Chorus has a membership of around 400 singers, aged from eight to eighteen.  The members learn to sing using the [[Zoltán Kodály]] method of training.

==Recordings==
The orchestra has had a long-standing recording contract with [[Chandos Records]], particularly in the 1980s and 1990s.  The RSNO has also recorded for [[Naxos Records]], most notably in a cycle of [[Anton Bruckner]] symphonies with the [[Georg Tintner]], cycles of [[Arnold Bax]] symphonies with [[David Lloyd-Jones (conductor)|David Lloyd-Jones]], and several recordings of American works (including the complete orchestral works of [[Samuel Barber]]) conducted by [[Marin Alsop]].  With Denève, their first Roussel recording&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/jun/08/classicalmusicandopera.shopping1 | title=Roussel: Bacchus et Ariane; Symphony No 3, RSNO/ Denève | publisher=The Guardian | author=Tim Ashley | date=8 June 2007 | accessdate=2010-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; received the Diapason d'Or de l'année for Symphonic Music.

==History==

SaferVPN was released in 2013 by cybersecurity software developers, including founders Amit Bareket and Sagi Gidali. SaferVPN’s parent company began raising capital after creating and patenting a system created to aid law enforcement in identifying and catching car thieves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/294754|title=How to Choose a VPN Provider for Your Business|last=Onibalusi| first=Segun| date=2017-07-21 | work=Entrepreneur| access-date=2017-10-04| language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tech.eu/brief/safervpn-funding/|title=Israeli VPN startup SaferVPN raises $1 million for business services|work=Tech.eu|access-date=2017-10-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Imagine Cup|Microsoft Imagine Cup]] competition the first application cofounders Amit Bareket and Sagi Gidali assembled together made second place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://techcompanynews.com/safervpn-raises-1m-venture-funding-provide-businesses-scalable-cloud-based-vpn-applications-customizable-cloud-management-portal/|title=SaferVPN Raises $1M Venture Funding To Provide Businesses With Scalable, Cloud-Based VPN Applications And A Customizable Cloud Management Portal - Tech Company News|date=2017-09-22|work=Tech Company News|access-date=2017-10-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== #UnblockTheWeb ===
In March 2014 when [[Turkey]] attempted to block [[Twitter]], SaferVPN launched the #UnblockTheWeb initiative to give individuals blocked by government censorship free access to a VPN.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/may/08/tech-industry-democracy-free-speech-rights-google-politics|title=Why Google and other tech giants are creating tools for political dissidents|last=Liacas|first=Tom|date=2015-05-08|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-10-04|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August, 2016, Unblock the Web provided a free VPN account to a coalition of Bangladeshi bloggers allowing them to communicate.&lt;ref name = huffingtonpost3&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.huffingtonpost.com/karen-mesoznik/blogging-for-a-change-a-b_b_10161490.html | title = Blogging for a Change: A Blogger’s Journey to Advocate for His People and His Culture Through Blogging Activism| publisher = Huffington Post | accessdate = 24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Apple approved SaferVPN to implement automatic Wi-Fi Security. Its patented technology alerts users when they connect to an unsecured Wi-Fi network even if their device is locked, preventing harmful data leaks.&lt;ref name = geektime/&gt;

==Technology==
SaferVPN uses [[Protocols (computing)|protocols]] to secure data that is transmitted over its network. Each protocol varies in how the data is secured.&lt;ref name = geektime&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.geektime.com/2016/09/09/israeli-safervpn-launches-automatic-wi-fi-solution-to-keep-users-secure-on-the-go/|title=SaferVPN's launches Automatic Wi-Fi solution for mobile|date=2016-09-09|work=Geektime|access-date=2017-10-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
SaferVPN’s supported protocols include:
* [[OpenVPN]], the commonly used protocol due to its performance and security level.
* Point-To-Point Tunneling Protocol ([[PPTP]]), a commonly used VPN protocol that uses basic encryption giving users fast connection speeds.
* Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol ([[L2TP]]/IPSec), secure but slower than other protocols. L2TP is a good option if OpenVPN or IKEv2 aren’t available. Unlike PPTP, L2TP/IPSec requires a [[Symmetric-key algorithm|shared key]] or the use of certificates.
* [[Internet Key Exchange|IKEv2]], the newest protocol available. Fastest of all protocols, it is secure and stable but not supported on all platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://itspmagazine.com/from-the-newsroom/seriously-can-you-not-do-that-chapter-iv-insecure-use-of-public-wi-fi|title=Seriously?!

== Mission Statement ==
[[World Wide Web|The World Wide Web]] started to function as a "[[Global village|Global Village]]" without any meaning to geographical boundaries. It was accessible, open and equal to all users. Over the years, more and more regulations have been enforced on the users and the Internet has turned into a completely different ecosystem.  Many countries have begun censoring a variety of sites and services (a prominent example is Iran and China, which blocked [[Facebook]], [[Google]], [[Gmail]], [[YouTube]] and many other well-known services). 

In addition, a high percentage of content services are currently accessible only from parent countries. For example, [[Netflix]], the popular content service, blocks access to most content for those outside the US. [[Pandora Radio|Pandora]], [[Spotify]], and many other sites are also blocked. 

In fact, the Internet has become a place with many "local villages" and defined boundaries.

SaferVPN focuses on developing a secure VPN service, which allows users to bypass censorship restrictions in more than 65 countries and bypass geographical limitations of various network services. In addition, the service enables users to enjoy network privacy and to avoid being monitored by governments and large companies and enjoy security over public wireless networks.

The '''Spring Symphony''' is [[Benjamin Britten]]'s [[opus number|Opus]] 44. It is dedicated to [[Serge Koussevitzky]] and the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]]. It was premiered in the Concertgebouw, Amsterdam, on Thursday 14 July 1949 (not 9 July which is quoted by many sources) as part of the [[Holland Festival]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brittenpears.org/?page=britten/timelineLaunch.html |title=Britten timeline |publisher=brittenpears.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the composer was 35. At the premiere the tenor soloist was [[Peter Pears]], the soprano Jo Vincent and the contralto [[Kathleen Ferrier]]. The conductor was [[Eduard van Beinum]]. A recording of the performance survives and was first issued by Decca in August 1994.

In October 1950, Spring Symphony was performed at the [[Leeds Festival (classical music)|Leeds Triennial Musical Festival]] with a choir of 100 boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official Souvenir Programme:  1950 - Leeds Triennial Musical Festival|url=http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/1950-Kathleen-Ferrier-Arrau-Beecham-Baillie-De-Vito-Britten-Pears-Barbirolli-/161752247283?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_3&amp;hash=item25a92f6bf3|publisher=(LTMF Committee)  - City of Leeds UK 1950|accessdate=22 September 2015|quote=6 October 1950 -  to be conducted by the composer  (B.

The Spring Symphony is a [[choral symphony]], written for [[soprano]], [[alto]] and [[tenor]] [[Solo (music)|solo]]ists, mixed [[choir|chorus]], boys' choir (often performed by a children's choir instead) and [[orchestra]]. Britten sets several poets' words, chiefly from the 16th and 17th century such as [[Edmund Spenser]], [[John Clare]] and [[George Peele]]. A notable exception is 'Out on the lawn I lie in bed' by his friend [[W. H. Auden]].

In the composer's own words, the work represents 'the progress of Winter to Spring and the reawakening of the earth and life which that means'.

== Structure ==
The Spring Symphony is made up of four parts, which correspond to the movements of a conventional symphony: ''[[Allegro (music)|Allegro]]'' with slow introduction, slow movement, ''[[scherzo]]'', and [[Finale (music)|finale]]. Part I begins with the dark and mysterious ''Shine Out'', a poem to the sun. Several more songs follow, including ''The Driving Boy'', which is a piece that features the boys' choir, at times whistling, and [[tambourine]]. The second part has several solos and quiet choruses and references to the month of May. The third part looks forward to May and then to summer. The Finale, ''London, to Thee I do Present'', comes to a climax when the entire chorus joins in a wordless, full-throated [[waltz]] representing the May revellers fortified by [[wine]] and [[ale]] (borne out by some rather unexpected [[modulation (music)|modulation]]s). The climax of the movement is the moment when the children’s voices, accompanied by [[unison]] [[French horn]]s, re-enter the scene and sing the 13th century [[Round (music)|round]] ''[[Sumer Is Icumen In|Sumer is icumen in]]''. The simple tune, sung in 2/4 time over the unyielding 3/4 waltz of the rest of the ensemble, finally achieves dominance. Eventually the celebrations subside, and the [[King of the May|Maylord]] then offers a final blessing with the proclamation: "And so, my friends, I cease."&lt;ref name="score"&gt;{{cite book |last=Britten |first=Benjamin |date=1949 |title=Spring Symphony. Op. 44. For soprano, alto and tenor soli, mixed chorus, boys' choir and orchestra. Full score |url=http://www.boosey.com/shop/prod/Benjamin-Britten-Spring-Symphony-op-44-study-score-Study-Score-Hawkes-Pocket-Score-66/696677 |location=London |publisher=Hawkes &amp; Son |asin=B0000CTOU1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The large orchestra includes triple [[Woodwind instrument|woodwinds]], two [[harp]]s, and a large [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] section. Each song has its distinctive scoring, ranging from just first and second [[violin]]s accompanying the tenor (''Waters Above!'') to full orchestra in the first and last songs. The last movement adds the call of a cow-horn, specifying a G, C, and F.&lt;ref name="score"/&gt;

As part of MAKE, Talawa also offers a script reading service and produces an annual season of play readings, Talawa Firsts, which showcases the best new [[Black British|black]] writing talent.

The Times referred to Girls as ''“Scorchingly intelligent and as powerful as a gut punch”''&lt;ref name="thetimes.co.uk"/&gt; while Time Out called it ''" ... clever, audacious, entertaining and full of promise."'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/london/theatre/girls|title=Girls|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talawa.com/articles/reviews-for-girls|title=Reviews for Girls|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theresa Ikoko commented on her experience of working with Talawa to get the story produced, saying: ''"This isn’t the first play I’ve written, but it’s my first produced play. The first play I wrote, I didn’t really know it was a play, it was just for me. I would read it over the phone to my friend and when I’d finished he said I had to show it to someone. Talawa Theatre Company found me and [artistic director] Michael Buffong put that play in a Talawa Firsts show, and I got signed by my agent there ... Talawa completely took a chance on me. I had no training or experience or credentials, and there was no one to offer a reference. But Michael believed in me. It took me forever though, probably until the opening night of Girls at HighTide, for me to believe him."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestage.co.uk/features/interviews/2016/theresa-ikoko-putting-your-work-out-there-is-like-sending-your-child-to-school-naked/|title=Theresa Ikoko: 'Putting your work out there is like sending your child to school naked' - Interviews - The Stage|date=25 October 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''telematic performance''' refers to a live performance (art, dance, music, etc.) which makes use of [[telecommunications]] and [[information technology]] to distribute the performers between two or more locations.

While this may involve use of conventional [[videoconferencing]] technology, it has more recently come to mean the use of internet technologies. Performance groups my also refer to their events as ''internet concerts'', ''online jamming'', or ''teleconcerts''.

==History==
On June 21, 1982, The first International Summer Solstice Radio Broadcast.  Created by Charlie Morrow. Produced by New Wilderness Foundation and WNYC FM. Celebrating the first day of summer (and winter below the equator) with a satellite mix of live events in Sweden, the USA, New Zealand, Canada, Denmark, and Italy. The solstice jam in real time concluded the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/22/arts/druids-mark-solstice-euphoniously.html |title='DRUIDS' MARK SOLSTICE EUPHONIOUSLY |last1=Rockwell |first1=John |last2= |first2= |date=22 June 1982 |website= |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 26, 2012, a ghostpianist concert has been realized in Berlin Philharmonie. Italian pianist Roberto Prosseda played Chopin's Grande Polonaise Brillante op. 22 on a Yamaha Clavinova digital piano in the backstage of the hall,  sending the midi signal in real time to the robot-pianist Teo Tronico, which acted as a mirrorpianist, mirroring Prosseda's performance on the Steinway grand piano on stage with Berliner Symphoniker conducted by Michelangelo Galeati.

==Issues==
Performers and researchers work to overcome the following obstacles:

# '''Audio latency:'''  Most musicians who play in a group rely on audio cues to maintain tempo and other communication.  The most obvious example is the use of a drummer in pop music to keep time. In a normal rehearsal or performance environment, there is a delay between the time one musician plays and another hears the sound due to the speed of sound in air. This is typically from 3 - 50ms. When audio is transmitted through a digital medium (i.e. the Internet), the delay (or [[Latency (audio)|latency]]) can be much longer. Cell phones have latency of approximately 50ms. Applications such as Skype have approximately 100ms. And, QuickTime and Windows Media server-based streaming systems add 8 or more seconds of latency. When the latency is too high, the audio cues are no longer effective. Researchers&lt;ref name='lester_boley'&gt;{{cite journal | author=Lester, M, &amp; Boley, J. | title=The Effects of Latency on Live Sound Monitoring | journal=Audio Engineering Society | year=2007 }}{{Full|date=April 2014}}&lt;!--volume number, inclusive pages, and the specific page reference for this citation are needed.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  have shown that some musicians can ignore this delay while others find it obtrusive.  In general, the higher the audio quality and the more channels transmitted, the higher the latency needs to be to reliably transmit the audio stream.
# '''Echo cancellation:''' Since the latency between locations is much higher than the speed of sound, standard techniques to eliminate feedback from monitoring systems, such as [equalization], do not work. However, when the latency between locations is low enough, teleconferencing [[echo cancellation]] techniques can be used.
# '''Video latency:''' Musicians also rely on visual cues to maintain synchronization. The most obvious example is the use of a conductor with orchestral music. Due to the size of video data, latency tends to higher for video than audio latency.
# '''Audio/video synchronization:''' In order to maintain audio and video synchronization, audio may be delayed more than necessary. Some performers opt to sacrifice AV synchronization for lower audio latency. For example, those involved with [[improvised]], musical telematic performances may require low latency audio cues.

== Facilities ==
Since 2009, when the Tyler School of Art moved into its new home, a 250,000-square-foot building designed by award-winning architect Carlos Jiménez&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://carlosjimenezstudio.com/tyler-school-of-art/|title=Tyler School of Art (2005-2009)|website=Carlos Jiménez Studio|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Tyler's art students and faculty have had access to expansive, state-of-the-art facilities. Tyler's architecture students and faculty experienced a similar boost in size and quality of facilities when the program moved into a new, 50,000-square-foot Architecture Building in 2012—Temple's first building dedicated solely to architecture.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The two structures, which are connected by a glass-enclosed passageway, are located at Temple University's Main Campus in Philadelphia, giving the Tyler community access to the city's museums, galleries and other arts-related resources. Their location adjacent to Presser Hall (part of Temple University's [[Boyer college of music and dance|Boyer College of Music and Dance]]) and Temple Theaters (part of Temple's School of Theater, Film and Media Arts) has created an arts quadrant in the northeast corner of campus.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The central courtyard between Tyler's two primary buildings is one of the largest green spaces at Temple University's Main Campus. In 2018, the Nicholas Kripal Natural Dye Garden, a collaboration between students and faculty in Tyler's Fibers &amp; Materials Studies and Landscape Architecture programs, was installed in the courtyard, part of a plan to re-activate the courtyard and make it a space for interdisciplinary collaboration and recreation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/TylerSchool/status/1044285110596632577|title=Tyler School of Art on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-10-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable Tyler facilities include:

* The Architecture Building, with four floors of studios and exposed air ducts, plumbing pipes and lights in order for students to observe the building's infrastructure.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tyler.temple.edu/facilities|title=Explore Our Facilities {{!}} Tyler School of Art|website=tyler.temple.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Digital services facilities that include a Digital Fabrications Studio where students have access to 3-D printers, 3-D scanning, vinyl cutting, laser cutting and a ten-needle embroidery machine; a Media Output Center with archival-quality printing up to 64 inches wide; and a Visual Resource Center with a wide variety of scanners, projectors, DSLR cameras and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tyler.temple.edu/tyler-digital-services|title=Tyler Digital Services|work=Tyler School of Art|access-date=2018-10-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Temple Contemporary and public programming ==
Temple Contemporary is Tyler's exhibitions and public programs unit, which has been led by Robert Blackson, Tyler's director of exhibitions and public programming, since 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tyler.temple.edu/who-we-are|title=Who We Are|work=Tyler School of Art|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temple Contemporary's galleries and offices are located in the Tyler building at Temple University's Main Campus, although much of its programming takes place in the surrounding Philadelphia community.

Temple Contemporary's mission is "to re-imagine the social function of art through questions of local relevance and international significance.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.templecontemporary.info/|title=Temple Contemporary|website=www.templecontemporary.info|language=en|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; To achieve that goal, Temple Contemporary relies on a "ground-up" programming model. The issues that Temple Contemporary tackles in its gallery exhibitions and other public programming are not determined by its director, but are prompted by a democratic process spearheaded by an advisory council made up of non-Temple-University-based local residents (ranging from high school students to community leaders), Temple University and Tyler faculty faculty members, Temple University and Tyler students and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pewcenterarts.org/post/inside-temple-contemporary-qa-rob-blackson|title=Inside Temple Contemporary: Q&amp;A with Rob Blackson|last=admin|date=2015-08-21|work=The Pew Center for Arts &amp; Heritage|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tyler.temple.edu/meet-tyler-dean-susan-cahan|title=Meet Tyler dean Susan Cahan|work=Tyler School of Art|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thephiladelphiacitizen.org/rob-blackson-temple-contemporary-2/|title=Temple Contemporary's Rob Blackson Disrupts the Traditional Art Gallery|website=thephiladelphiacitizen.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Temple Contemporary's community-focused programming that has earned national attention includes "Funeral for a Home" (2014)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://funeralforahome.org/|title=Funeral for a Home|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/05/30/317407504/in-nod-to-history-a-crumbling-philly-row-house-gets-a-funeral|title=In Nod To History, A Crumbling Philly Row House Gets A Funeral|last=|first=|date=|work=NPR's "All Things Considered"|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, an extended commemoration of at-risk urban housing stock and the lives that soon-to-be-demolished homes contain; "reForm" (2014-2015)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://reform-project.org/|title=reForm|website=reForm|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/29/arts/design/art-show-captures-the-wrenching-effects-of-closing-a-school.html|title=Art Show Captures the Wrenching Effects of Closing a School|last=|first=|date=|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a response to the closure of public schools and its impact on urban communities and their children by artist and Tyler faculty member [[Pepón Osorio]]; and "Symphony for a Broken Orchestra" (2017-2018)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://symphonyforabrokenorchestra.org/|title=Symphony for a Broken Orchestra|website=symphonyforabrokenorchestra.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/04/arts/music/philadelphia-david-lang-symphony-for-a-broken-orchestra.html|title=A Symphony Breathes Life Into 400 Broken School Instruments|last=|first=|date=|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a citywide effort to collect, display, repair and return broken instruments belonging to Philadelphia's public schools, highlighted by the composition of music for the broken instruments by composer David Lang and the music's performance by a diverse orchestra of local residents.

== History ==
Arts patron Stella Elkins Tyler (of the [[William Lukens Elkins|Elkins]]/[[Widener family]]) donated her estate in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania, to Temple University in the early 1930s. With an interest in progressive education and a deep appreciation of her mentor, the sculptor Boris Blai, Tyler offered her estate with the expressed wish that, through Boris Blai, it would become an environment for the advancement of the fine arts, scholarly study in the arts and individual creativity. As founding dean of what was then known as the Stella Elkins Tyler School of Fine Arts, Blai instilled the school with a commitment to progressive education emphasizing the student's mastery of technique within the framework of a liberal arts curriculum. Blai insisted upon individual attention to each student's needs as the basis of successful teaching. During his 25-year tenure as dean, Blai shaped the school into one of the finest visual arts centers in the country, and his founding ideals still remain paramount to Tyler's educational philosophy.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1960, Charles Le Clair succeeded Blai. Under Le Clair, the Tyler campus was improved with construction of a residence hall and two studio/classroom buildings. In 1966, the school's name was changed to the Tyler School of Art, and Le Clair founded the Tyler Study Abroad program in Rome, Italy.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Tyler's programs at [[Temple University Rome]] remain among the most respected fine arts study abroad programs in Europe today. Temple University Rome has expanded to include a full range of liberal arts, architecture, business and law courses with an emphasis on those relating to Rome, Italy and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rome.temple.edu/history/|title=50 YEARS OF TEMPLE ROME – Temple University Rome Campus|website=rome.temple.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Tyler's curriculum continued to grow in response to new definitions of art-making and the role of art in society. New programs and modern facilities in design, ceramics, glass, metals and photography were added.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During this time, Tyler established Art History and Art Education departments on Temple's Main Campus in Philadelphia.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The pace of change and growth began to accelerate dramatically in the late 1990s. In 1998, Tyler welcomed Temple's Department of Architecture. In 2009, Tyler moved from Elkins Park into a new, 250,000-square-foot building at Temple's Main Campus.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Three years later, Architecture moved into a new 50,000-square-foot facility connected to the new Tyler building.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Temple's departments of Landscape Architecture &amp; Horticulture and Planning &amp; Community Development became part of Tyler in 2016, for the first time unifying all of the built-environment disciplines at Temple in one academic unit. In 2017, the Tyler School of Art welcomed Susan E. Cahan, who came from Yale University to become first permanent dean of an independent Tyler since the school moved into its new building in 2009.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Tyler's leaders:

* Boris Blai, dean (1935-1960)
* Charles Le Clair, dean (1960-1974)
*Donald M. Lantzy, acting dean (1974-1975)
*Jack Wasserman, dean (1975-1977)
* David Pease, interim dean (1977-1978) and dean (1978-1984)
*George Bayliiss, dean (1984-1989)
* Rochelle Toner, dean (1989-2002)
* Hester Stinnett, acting dean (2002-2005)
* Keith Anthony Morrison, dean (2005-2008)
* Therese Dolan, interim dean (2008-2009)
* Robert Stroker, interim dean and dean of Center for the Arts (2009-2015)
* Hester Stinnett, interim dean (2015-2017)
* Susan E. Cahan, dean (2017-present)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6323">'''Yeh Dil Maange More!''' is an [[advertising slogan]] coined for [[Pepsi]] at [[J. Walter Thompson|JWT]] by [[Anuja Chauhan]] in 1998.&lt;ref name=ec/&gt; It combines [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] and [[English language|English]], and literally meaning ''This Heart Desires More'', which later became a popular slogan. The slogan and its derivatives have been used in multiple contexts in [[India]]. The worldwide  Pepsi commercial featuring the song, ''[[Ask for More]]'', written by [[Janet Jackson]] was released in November 1998, later released a single in January 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=janet jackson|chart=all}} Billboard - Janet Jackson's Discography]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/jackson_janet/albums.jhtml?albumId=2213775 MTV - Janet Jackson - ''Ask For More'' (Pepsi Single)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The slogan has its origins as a commercial slogan for [[Pepsi]] advertisement in 1998,&lt;ref name="midday2009rst"&gt;{{Citation | title=His soul sang Yeh Dil Maange More | newspaper=Mid-Day, Delhi | date=2009-07-21 | accessdate = 2009-07-24 | url=http://www.mid-day.com/news/2009/jul/210709-Captain-Vikram-Batra-Martyr-Kargil-War-Hero-Indomitables-Pepsi-Delhi.htm | quote=''... and Pepsi listened. Captain Vikram Batra, all of 24 when he turned martyr, was recommended for Mahavir Chakra, but went on to win the Param Vir Chakra ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[J. Walter Thompson|JWT]] by [[Anuja Chauhan]] who eventually became Vice President and Executive Creative Director at JWT, Delhi, and author of books like, ''[[The Zoya Factor]]'' (2008).&lt;ref name=ec&gt;{{cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-company/corporate-announcement/Anuja-Chauhan-puts-in-papers-at-JWT/articleshow/6322248.cms|title=Anuja Chauhan puts in papers at JWT|date=Aug 2010|work=Economic Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter it soon gained mass popularity, and became a battle slogan and rallying cry, first used by Capt. [[Vikram Batra]], an officer of the [[Indian Army]], during the 1999 [[Kargil War]] and widely reported in the media.&lt;ref name="midday2009rst" /&gt;&lt;ref name="midday2009qgh"&gt;{{Citation | title=Bravehearts say, yeh dil mange more | newspaper=Mid-Day, Delhi | date=2009-03-26 | accessdate = 2009-07-24 | url=http://www.mid-day.com/news/2009/mar/260309-NSG-commandos-serious-injuries-Mumbai-terror-attack-bravehearts.htm | quote=''... 2 NSG commandos seriously injured during Mumbai terror attack can't wait for action again ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Captain Batra was martyred during the war in July 1999 was  posthumously awarded the [[Param Vir Chakra]], India's highest military honour.&lt;ref name="pvc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kargil Update: Indian Army|url=http://armedforces.nic.in/airforce/afkargil/airpvc.htm|work=Param Vir Chakra|publisher=Ministry of Defence, Government of India|accessdate=26 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The slogan continues to be a part of the Indian [[popular culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yeh dil maange more!|url=http://www.mumbaimirror.com/net/mmpaper.aspx?Page=article&amp;sectid=30&amp;contentid=20080401200804010207191839f60c64d|work= Mumbai Mirror}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, it was used as a title for a [[Bollywood]] movie, ''[[Dil Maange More]]'' starring [[Shahid Kapoor]].

==Pepsi advertisement==
The slogan was coined as a [[tagline]] for a Pepsi [[television advertisement]] series that first ran in December 1998 and sought to establish Pepsi as a strong brand with Indian youth.&lt;ref name="butcher2003"&gt;{{Citation | title=Transnational television, cultural identity and change: When STAR came to India | first=Melissa | last=Butcher | year=2003 | publisher=SAGE | isbn=0-7619-9766-0 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=DNh1qs24HLUC | quote=''... much of the vocabulary highlights a perception of youth today as more ambitious and more individualistic ... Pepsi's 1998 commercial, Yeh Dil Maange More (This Heart Wants More), joins a list of advertisements that play on this theme ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a continuation of Pepsi's advertising campaign in the mid-to-late nineties, which it had initially launched as an [[ambush marketing]] effort against [[Coca-Cola]] during the [[1996 Cricket World Cup]].&lt;ref name="amis2005"&gt;{{Citation | title=Global sport sponsorship | author=John Amis, T. Bettina Cornwell | year=2005 | publisher=Berg Publishers | isbn=1-84520-081-0 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=jw-WHdztdDQC | quote=''... Pepsi attempted to hijack Coca-Cola's official sponsorship of the 1996 Cricket World Cup ... the most disliked words among Indian youth were "official", "corruption" and "discipline" ... In an effort to attract youth, Pepsi developed the slogan "Yeh Dil Maange More" ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ads featured prominent sports personalities and film stars, such as [[Sachin Tendulkar]], [[Shahrukh Khan]], [[Amitabh Bachchan]], and [[Pawan Kalyan]] and were directed by [[Prahlad Kakkar]], a veteran ad film director.&lt;ref name="finexp2005gtl"&gt;{{Citation | title=HC stays overseas release of film ‘Dil Maange More’ | newspaper=Financial Express | date=2005-01-05 | accessdate = 2009-07-24 | url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/hc-stays-overseas-release-of-film-dil-maange-more/123511/ | quote=''... Pepsi had coined the phrase ‘yeh dil maange more’ for its advertising campaign in December 1998 ... Sachin Tendulkar, Aamir Khan, Amitabh Bachchan ... earlier Coca-Cola, Omni Ltd, the producers of Tamil film Pepsi-Inda Ullam Kekkume More (Translation of Pepsi-yeh dil maange more), and North Delhi Power Corporation (users of phrase yeh dil maange more electricity) were restrained from using the said slogan/title ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The catchphrase became a runaway success and other business entities sought to appropriate it in their messaging. Pepsi litigated actively to assert an exclusive right to use the slogan.&lt;ref name="finexp2005gtl" /&gt;
