'''Alfred Eliasson''' (1920 - 1988) was an [[Icelanders|Icelandic]] businessman who founded and served as president of [[Icelandic Airlines|Loftleidir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Plane Crash, A Glacier, And An Entrepreneur: How Icelandair Opened Up Air Travel For Everyone |url=https://www.fastcompany.com/40414742/a-plane-crash-a-glacier-an-entrepreneur-how-icelandair-opened-up-air-travel-for-everyone |website=Fast Company |accessdate=28 June 2018 |date=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loftleiðir Icelandic Airlines was formed in 1944 with a single engine, three passenger plane of [[Stinson Reliant]] make, Loftleiðir grew to become one of the major carriers of the North Atlantic in the 1960s and early 1970s pioneering low cost air travel over the Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Icelandic Airlines History: The Country's Latest and Greatest |url=https://tedium.co/2017/05/29/iceland-airlines-history/ |website=Tedium: The Dull Side of the Internet. |accessdate=28 June 2018 |date=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Producer [[Edward R. Pressman]] purchased the film rights to the novel in 1992. After discussions with [[David Cronenberg]] fell through, Harron was brought on to direct and cast Bale in the lead role. Lionsgate acquired worldwide distribution in 1997 and temporarily replaced Harron and Bale with [[Oliver Stone]] as director and [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] portraying Patrick Bateman. DiCaprio left in favor of ''[[The Beach (film)|The Beach]]'' and Harron and Bale were brought back. ''American Psycho'' debuted at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] on January 21, 2000, and was released theatrically on April 14, 2000. The film was a financial success and received generally positive reviews, with much of the praise directed to Bale's performance and the screenplay.

==Plot==
In 1987, wealthy New York investment banker [[Patrick Bateman]]'s life revolves around dining at trendy restaurants while keeping up appearances for his fiancée Evelyn and his circle of wealthy and shallow associates, most of whom he dislikes. Bateman describes the material accoutrements of his lifestyle, including his daily morning exercise, beautification routine, designer wardrobe and expensive furniture. He also discusses his music collection, which includes [[Huey Lewis and the News]], [[Phil Collins]] and [[Whitney Houston]].

Bateman and his associates flaunt their [[business card]]s in a display of vanity. Enraged by the superiority of co-worker Paul Allen's card, Bateman murders a homeless man and kills the man's dog. At a Christmas party, Bateman makes plans to have dinner with Allen, who mistakes Bateman for another coworker, Marcus Halberstram. Bateman gets Allen drunk and lures him back to his apartment. While playing "[[Hip to Be Square]]" on the stereo, Bateman delivers a monologue to Allen about the artistic merits of the song and of [[Huey Lewis and the News]], then murders him with a chrome axe. He disposes of Allen's body, and then goes to his apartment to stage the situation so that others believe Allen has run off to London.

Bateman is later interviewed about Allen's disappearance in his office by private detective Donald Kimball. During the night, Bateman takes two prostitutes, whom he names Christie and Sabrina, to his apartment and explains to them the improvement he saw in the band [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] after they moved away from [[progressive rock]] toward a more pop rock sound beginning with the album ''[[Duke (album)|Duke]]''. After they have sex, Bateman tells them to stay, while taking out instruments he uses for bodily harm. In the next scene, they leave his apartment somewhat bloodied.

The next day, Bateman's colleague Louis Carruthers reveals his new business card. Bateman tries to kill Louis in the restroom of an expensive restaurant but cannot bring himself to strangle him. Luis mistakes the attempted murder for a sexual advance and declares his love for Bateman, who flees in disgust. After murdering a model, Bateman invites his secretary, Jean, to dinner, suggesting she meet him at his apartment for drinks before. When Jean arrives, Bateman, unbeknownst to her, holds a nailgun to the back of her head while the two converse. When he receives an answering machine message from his fiancée, Evelyn, he asks Jean to leave. Kimball meets Bateman for lunch and tells him he is not under suspicion.

Bateman later invites Christie and his acquaintance Elizabeth to Allen's apartment for sex, and kills Elizabeth during the act. Christie runs, discovering multiple female corpses in various rooms as she searches for an exit. A naked Bateman chases her while wielding a chainsaw, and drops it on her as she flees down a staircase, killing her.

Bateman breaks off his engagement with Evelyn. That night, as he uses an ATM, he finds a stray kitten. The ATM displays the text "feed me a stray cat". As he prepares to shoot the cat, a woman sees and tries to stop him; he shoots her and lets the cat go free. A police chase ensues but Bateman destroys the police cars by shooting their gas tanks. Fleeing to his office, Bateman enters the wrong office building, where he murders a security guard and a janitor. In an office he believes is his, Bateman calls his lawyer Harold and frantically leaves a lengthy confession on Harold's answering machine.

The following morning, Bateman visits Allen's apartment, expecting it to be full of decomposing bodies and in the middle of a police investigation, but it is vacant, freshly painted and for sale. The [[Real estate broker|realtor]] tells him to leave. As Bateman goes to meet with his colleagues and lawyer for lunch, a horrified Jean finds detailed drawings of murder, mutilation and rape in Bateman's office journal.

Bateman sees Harold at a restaurant and mentions the phone message he left the prior night. Harold mistakes Bateman for another colleague and laughs off the phone message confession as a joke, saying he had dinner with Allen in London days earlier. A confused Bateman returns to his friends. In a final voice-over narration, he realizes he will continue to escape the punishment he deserves, and that there has been no [[catharsis]]: "This confession has meant nothing".

==Production==
Producer Edward R. Pressman purchased the [[film rights]] to [[Bret Easton Ellis]]'s novel ''American Psycho'' in 1992, with [[Johnny Depp]] expressing an interest in the lead role.&lt;ref name=Norton/&gt; After discussions with [[Stuart Gordon]] to direct fell through, [[David Cronenberg]] became attached and brought Ellis to adapt the novel into a screenplay. The process was difficult for Ellis, due to Cronenberg's scene constraints and not wanting to use any of Ellis's restaurant or nightclub material from the novel. The script ended with an elaborate musical sequence to [[Barry Manilow]]'s "[[Daybreak (Barry Manilow song)|Daybreak]]" atop the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]]. "I'm glad it wasn't shot, but that kind of shows you where I was when I was writing the script", Ellis reflected. "I was bored with the material."&lt;ref name=Movieline&gt;{{cite news|first=Kyle|last=Buchanan|title=Bret Easton Ellis on American Psycho, Christian Bale, and His Problem with Women Directors|url=http://movieline.com/2010/05/18/bret-easton-ellis-on-american-psycho-christian-bale-and-his-problem-with-women-directors/|work=Movieline.com|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|location=Los Angeles, California|date=May 18, 2010|accessdate=February 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cronenberg was still listed as being attached to direct in March 1994, but with a new script by [[Norman Snider]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=David|last=Rooney |url= https://variety.com/1994/film/news/disney-wins-houston-and-washington-teaming-119623/|title=Disney wins Houston and Washington teaming …|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|location=Los Angeles, California|date=March 2, 1994|accessdate=February 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pressman appeared at the [[1996 Cannes Film Festival]] to pre-sell distribution rights, but to no avail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Peter Bart|url=https://variety.com/1997/voices/columns/fast-talkers-can-t-hold-a-candle-to-pressman-1117859584/|title=Fast-talkers can't hold a candle to Pressman|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|location=Los Angeles, California|date=May 12, 1997|accessdate=February 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mary Harron]] replaced Cronenberg as director while writing a new script with [[Guinevere Turner]]. Harron cast [[Christian Bale]] in a deal on good faith,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Steven|last=Gaydos|url=https://variety.com/1997/film/news/edgy-producer-chris-hanley-knows-how-to-work-biz-angles-1116676450/|title='Edgy' producer Chris Hanley knows how to work biz angles|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|location=Los Angeles, California|date=July 24, 1997|accessdate=February 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attached [[Willem Dafoe]] and [[Jared Leto]] in supporting roles.

Harron refused to meet with DiCaprio, displeased as she specifically chose Bale and believed DiCaprio's screen presence would have been too boyish for Patrick Bateman. She also believed the actor's reputation as a teen idol following ''[[Romeo + Juliet]]'' and ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' would distract from ''American Psycho''{{'}}s production and tone.&lt;ref name=Norton/&gt;

Lionsgate was planning to increase the production budget to $40 million in the hopes of securing DiCaprio's $21 million asking price.&lt;ref name=payday&gt;{{cite news|first1=Dan|last1=Cox|first2=Benedict|last2=Carver|url=https://variety.com/1998/more/news/di-caprio-in-21-mil-payday-1117470905/|title=Di Caprio in $21 mil payday|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|location=Los Angeles, California|date=May 17, 1998|accessdate=February 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[1997 Cannes Film Festival]], a press release was issued that DiCaprio had taken the offer,&lt;ref name=castingleo/&gt; which was quickly rebutted by DiCaprio's manager, Rick Yorn, who claimed the actor had simply expressed interest in the part.

Working from a new script written by Matthew Markwalder, Stone was brought aboard, whom Harron called "probably the single worst single person to do it". The director wanted to eliminate the satire from Harron's script, emphasizing the psychological character traits of Patrick Bateman. However, Stone could not agree on the film's direction with DiCaprio, who decided to star in ''[[The Beach (film)|The Beach]]'' instead.&lt;ref name=Norton/&gt;

Bale remained committed, turning down other movie roles and auditions for nine months, confident DiCaprio would depart.&lt;ref name=Norton/&gt; Lionsgate made an offer to [[Ewan McGregor]], who turned it down after Bale personally urged him to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jonathan|last=Heaf|url = http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/entertainment/articles/2011-04/26/gq-film-christian-bale-interview|title=Christian Bale: behind the mask|work=[[GQ]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|location=New York City|date=April 26, 2011|accessdate=March 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harron and Bale were eventually brought back under the agreement that the budget would not exceed $10 million.&lt;ref name=Norton&gt;{{cite news|first=Nina|last=Gopalan |url= https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/mar/24/fiction.breteastonellis| title=American Psycho: the story behind the film|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=Guardian Media Group|location=London, England|date=March 23, 2000|accessdate=February 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bale spent several months working out by himself, and then three hours a day with a trainer during pre-production, to achieve the proper physique for the [[narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic]] Bateman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/apr/06/artsfeatures| title = The method in my madness|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=Guardian Media Group|location=London, England|date=April 6, 2000|accessdate=March 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actor struggled with the role until he noticed [[Tom Cruise]] in an interview on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'', being struck by Cruise's energy and "intense friendliness with nothing behind the eyes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Stuart|last=Heritage | url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2009/oct/23/tom-cruise-christian-bale-american-psycho|title=Who other than Tom Cruise has inspired Christian Bale? |work =[[The Guardian]]|publisher=Guardian Media Group|location=London, England|date=October 23, 2009|accessdate = February 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bale also used [[Nicolas Cage]]'s performance in ''[[Vampire's Kiss]]'' as inspiration for this role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Harrison |last=Cheung| title=Christian Bale: The Inside Story of the Darkest Batman |year=2012 |publisher=BenBella Books |location=Dallas, Texas| isbn=1936661640 |page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filming began in March 1999 in Toronto, Canada.&lt;ref name="Norton" /&gt;

==Marketing==
As promotion, one could register to receive e-mails "from" Patrick Bateman, supposedly to his [[Therapy|therapist]].&lt;ref name="Howell"&gt;{{cite news |first= Peter| last= Howell | title=''American Psycho''s Web Promo Sickens Star | work=[[Toronto Star]] | location=Toronto, Ontario, Canada|date=March 8, 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The e-mails, written by a writer attached to the film and approved by the book's author Bret Easton Ellis, follow Bateman's life since the events of the film. He discusses such developments as his marriage to (and impending divorce settlement with) his former secretary, Jean, his complete adoration of his son, Patrick Jr., and his efforts to triumph over his business rivals. The e-mails also describe or mention interactions with other characters from the novel, including Timothy Price (Bryce in the film version), Evelyn, Luis, Courtney, David, Detective Kimball, and Marcus. However, the film's star, Christian Bale, was not happy with this kind of marketing: "My main objection is that some people think it will be me returning those e-mails. I don't like that ... I think the movie stands on its own merits and should attract an audience that can appreciate intelligent satire. It's not a slasher flick, but it's also not ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]''. The marketing should reflect that."&lt;ref name="Howell"/&gt;

Lionsgate spent $50,000 on an online stock market game, ''Make a Killing with American Psycho'', which invited players to invest in films, actors, or musicians using fake Hollywood money. This marketing ploy did little to help the film's box office but the studio's co-president [[Tom Ortenberg]] still claimed that it was a success: "The aim was to gain exposure and awareness for the picture, and we did that," he said. "Lionsgate will make a tidy profit on the picture."&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/may/05/news1 | title=Greed appeal fails to lift ''American Psycho'' | work=[[The Guardian]] | publisher=Guardian Media Group|location=London, England| date=5 May 2000 | accessdate=7 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soundtrack==
The [[Soundtrack album|soundtrack for the film]] was [[Film score|scored]] by [[John Cale]], with artists such as [[David Bowie]], [[The Cure]], and [[New Order (band)|New Order]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Psycho|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0144084/soundtrack|website=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Huey Lewis and the News]] song "[[Hip to Be Square]]" appears in the film and was initially intended to be on the soundtrack album, but was removed from the album due to lack of publishing rights.&lt;ref name=guardian2&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/apr/13/news |title=''American Psycho'' soundtrack in hot water |work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=Guardian Media Group| location=London, England| date=13 April 2000 |accessdate=27 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, [[Entertainment One Music|Koch Records]] was forced to recall approximately 100,000 copies of the album which were destroyed. Koch Records president Bob Frank said, "As a result of the violent nature of the film, Huey Lewis's management decided not to give the soundtrack clearance".&lt;ref name="guardian2" /&gt; Lewis' manager Bob Brown claimed that the musician had not seen the film and that "we knew nothing about a soundtrack album. They just went ahead and put the cut on there. I think what they're trying to do is drum up publicity for themselves".&lt;ref name="guardian2" /&gt; In a 2013 interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Lewis stated that the violence in the movie played no part in the decision not to allow the song to be included on the soundtrack. He reiterated Bob Brown's earlier denial stating "It was in the ''USA Today'' and everywhere else. It said, 'Huey Lewis saw the movie and it was so violent that he pulled his tune from the soundtrack.' It was completely made up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Andy|last=Greene|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/huey-lewis-on-30-years-of-sports-our-15-minutes-were-a-real-15-minutes-20130517|title=Huey Lewis on 30 Years of 'Sports': 'Our 15 Minutes Were a Real 15 Minutes'|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=Wenner Media LLC|location=San Francisco, California|date=May 17, 2013|accessdate=July 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, prior to the start of principal photography, [[Whitney Houston]] refused to allow the use of her performance of the song "[[The Greatest Love of All]]" in the film; her version was replaced by an easy-listening orchestrated version.&lt;ref name="guardian2" /&gt;

[[AllMusic]] rated the soundtrack album three out of five stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Derrick |last=Mathis |title=Original Soundtrack: ''American Psycho'' |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/american-psycho-mw0000608295 |website=Allmusic |accessdate=January 1, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''American Psycho'' debuted at the [[Sundance Film Festival]], where it polarized audiences and critics; some showered the film with praise for its writing and performance from Christian Bale, others with criticism for its violent nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/09/movies/film-the-risky-territory-of-american-psycho.html|title=The Risky Territory of American Psycho|last=|first=|date=|website=NY Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon its theatrical release, however, the film received positive reviews in crucial publications, including ''[[The New York Times]]'' which called it a "mean and lean horror comedy classic".&lt;ref name="holden"&gt;{{cite news|last=Holden|first=Stephen|url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/film/041400psycho-film-review.html|title=Murderer!

He eagerly works within the constraints of the quotation marks Harron puts around his performance".&lt;ref name="hoberman"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hoberman|first=J|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2000-04-11/film/atrocity-exhibitions/1|title=Atrocity Exhibitions|work=[[Village Voice]]|date=April 11, 2000|accessdate=2009-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s [[Peter Travers]] wrote, "whenever Harron digs beneath the glitzy surface in search of feelings that haven't been desensitized, the horrific and hilarious ''American Psycho'' can still strike a raw nerve".&lt;ref name="travers"&gt;{{cite news|last=Travers|first=Peter|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5947999/review/5948000/american_psycho|title=''American Psycho''|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=December 8, 2000|accessdate=2009-04-08|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329095830/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5947999/review/5948000/american_psycho| archivedate=March 29, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a somewhat positive review for [[Slate (magazine)|''Slate'']] magazine, [[David Edelstein]] noted the toned-down brutality and sexual content in comparison to the novel and wrote that the moment where Bateman spares his secretary is when "this one-dimensional film blossoms like a flower".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/movies/2000/04/dressed_to_kill.html|title=Dressed to Kill|last=|first=|date=|website=Slate Magazine|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Owen Gleiberman]] gave the film an "A&amp;minus;" rating, writing for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'': "By treating the book as raw material for an exuberantly perverse exercise in '[[80s Nostalgia]], [Harron] recasts the go-go years as a template for the casually brainwashing-consumer/fashion/image culture that emerged from them.

[[Bloody Disgusting]] ranked the film at No. 19 in its list of the "Top 20 Horror Films of the Decade", with the article praising "Christian Bale's disturbing/darkly hilarious turn as serial killer/Manhattan businessman Patrick Bateman, a role that in hindsight couldn't have been played by any other actor. ... At its best, the film reflects our own narcissism, and the shallow American culture it was spawned from, with piercing effectiveness. Much of the credit for this can go to director Mary Harron, whose off-kilter tendencies are a good complement to Ellis' unique style."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/18403|title=00's Retrospect: Bloody Disgusting's Top 20 Films of the Decade...Part 4|publisher=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|accessdate=2010-01-03|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208164216/http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/18403|archivedate=February 8, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Ellis said, "''American Psycho'' was a book I didn't think needed to be turned into a movie", as "the medium of film demands answers", which would make the book "infinitely less interesting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clatl.com/culturesurfing/archives/2010/06/19/1534716-bret-easton-ellis-talks-film-adaptations-at-scad |title=Bret Easton Ellis talks film adaptations at SCAD |publisher=[[Creative Loafing]] |accessdate=2010-06-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624060251/http://clatl.com/culturesurfing/archives/2010/06/19/1534716-bret-easton-ellis-talks-film-adaptations-at-scad |archivedate=June 24, 2010 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said that while the book attempted to add ambiguity to the events and to Bateman's reliability as a narrator, the film appeared to make them completely literal before confusing the issue at the very end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Buchanan|first=Kyle|url=http://movieline.com/2010/05/18/bret-easton-ellis-on-american-psycho-christian-bale-and-his-problem-with-women-directors/|title=Bret Easton Ellis on American Psycho, Christian Bale, and His Problem with Women Directors|publisher=Movieline|date=2010-05-18|accessdate=2013-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a 2014 appearance on the ''[[WTF with Marc Maron]]'' podcast, Ellis indicated that his feelings towards the film were more mixed than negative; he reiterated his opinion that his conception of Bateman as an unreliable narrator did not make an entirely successful transition from page to screen, adding that Bateman's narration was so unreliable that even ''he'', as the author of the book, didn't know if Bateman was honestly describing events that actually happened or if he was lying or even hallucinating. However, Ellis appreciated that the film clarified the humor for audiences who mistook the novel's violence for blatant misogyny as opposed to the deliberately exaggerated satire he'd intended, and liked that it gave his novel "a second life" in introducing it to new readers. Ultimately, Ellis said "the movie was okay, the movie was fine. I just didn't think it needed to be made."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_552_-_bret_easton_ellis|title=WTF with Marc Maron Podcast   - Episode 552 - Bret Easton Ellis|work=wtfpod.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film currently holds a 68% "Fresh" rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]]; the consensus states "If it falls short of the deadly satire of Bret Easton Ellis's novel, ''American Psycho'' still finds its own blend of horror and humor, thanks in part to a fittingly creepy performance by Christian Bale."&lt;ref&gt;{{rotten-tomatoes|american_psycho|American Psycho}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A special-edition [[DVD]] was released on July 21, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ign.com/movies/american-psycho/dvd-758290&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., two versions of the film have been released: an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R-rated]] and unrated version. For the edited version and R-rated cinematic release in the U.S., the producers excised about 18 seconds of footage from a scene featuring Bateman having a [[threesome]] with two [[prostitutes]]. Some dialogue was also edited: Bateman orders a prostitute, Christie, to bend over so that another, Sabrina, can "see your asshole", which was edited to "see your ass". The unedited version also shows Bateman receiving [[oral sex]] from Christie. The uncut version was released on [[Blu-ray]] on February 6, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/American-Psycho-Blu-ray/135/&lt;/ref&gt;

Independent musician [[Miles Fisher]] covered the "[[This Must Be the Place (Naive Melody)]]" on his self-titled 2009 EP, ''Miles Fisher''. The music video is an homage to ''American Psycho'', with Fisher imitating Christian Bale's performance as Patrick Bateman.

The film's influence can be seen in [[Kanye West]]'s music video "[[Love Lockdown]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Vena | first=Jocelyn | title=Kanye West Says 'Love Lockdown' Video Was Inspired By ''American Psycho'' | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1596504/20081007/west_kanye.jhtml | work=[[MTV]] | date=October 7, 2008 | accessdate=2009-04-08 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301142619/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1596504/20081007/west_kanye.jhtml| archivedate=March 1, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sequel===
A [[direct-to-video]] [[sequel]], ''[[American Psycho 2]]'', directed by [[Morgan J. Freeman]] and starring [[Mila Kunis]], was released in 2002. The sequel's only connection with the original is the death of Patrick Bateman (played by Michael Kremko wearing a face mask), briefly shown in a flashback. The film was denounced by ''American Psycho'' author [[Bret Easton Ellis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://movies.ign.com/articles/304/304429p1.html| title=Bret Easton Ellis Speaks Out  | publisher=IGN | date=August 21, 2001 |accessdate = August 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, star Mila Kunis expressed embarrassment over the film, and spoke out against the idea of a sequel. "Please—somebody stop this", she said. "Write a petition. When I did the second one, I didn't know it would be ''American Psycho II''. It was supposed to be a different project, and it was re-edited, but, ooh&amp;nbsp;... I don't know.

[[File:Car transporter 001.JPG|thumb|250px]]

An '''auto transport broker''' is a type of [[cargo broker]] that specializes in the shipping and transportation of vehicles. Most vehicles shipped in the U.S. are cars and trucks, but many brokers handle boats, RVs, motorcycles and other types of vehicles as well. Auto transport is classified as "specialized freight trucking" under [[North American Industry Classification System|NAICS]] code 484230.

==How Brokers Work==

An auto transport broker is part of the personal vehicle freight business industry chain. In the U.S., these broker companies must have proper licensing and authority from the [[FMCSA]] to be allowed to broker vehicles for customers.  The individual or business that needs to move a car or other vehicle is the shipper; the shipper contacts a broker to have their vehicle shipped or transported.  Once a broker is booked, the broker's job is to find a carrier, which is the individual or company that actually employs drivers and operates the car transport equipment.

Brokers are employed because they have access to freight [[load board]]s, where they can post the job and find carriers that have transportation resources in the area. They can also get lower shipping prices by getting competing bids by different carriers. However, brokers and carriers are not always separate entities - a number of auto transport companies handle both brokerage and transport.

==Numbers==

The [[United States Department of Transportation|US Department of Transportation]] keeps statistics on cargo shipments, showing over $651 billion worth of motorized and other vehicles (including parts) moved by truck in 2007. Of that number, $452bn of cargo was moved via for-hire truck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2007 Commodity Flow Survey, Table 7|url=https://www.bts.gov/sites/rita.dot.gov.bts/files/publications/commodity_flow_survey/final_tables_december_2009/index.html | publisher=Bureau of Transportation Statistics | accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Official statistics about the size of the secondary auto transport market, number of commercial-size [[car carrier trailer|car carrier]] vehicles on the road and number of vehicles shipped aren't kept by the DOT.

With the advent of the Internet, the auto transport industry has seen an influx of new brokers, attracted by the low cost of starting a brokerage business online. While this encouraged greater competition and lower costs in the industry, government agencies have also seen a "dramatic increase in complaints against auto transporters and auto transport brokers" due to Internet fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.protectyourmove.gov/documents/PYM-Consumer-Advisory-Auto-Transport.pdf | title= Consumer Advisory about Automobile Transporters | publisher= The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) | accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Licensing requirements==

Auto transport brokers in the USA are subject to government licensing. The candidate must obtain an Operating Authority number from the [[Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration]] by filling out a form on the FMCSA website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FMCSA online registration page |url=http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/registration-licensing/online-registration/onlineregdescription.htm |publisher=U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) Registration &amp; Assistance: Number/Operating Authority |accessdate=December 11, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209064840/http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/registration-licensing/online-registration/onlineregdescription.htm |archivedate=December 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FORM OP-1  APPLICATION FOR MOTOR PROPERTY CARRIER |url=http://autotransportbrokerleads.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/op1.pdf | publisher= U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration  | accessdate= 11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a small application processing fee. Brokers are also required to obtain a [[Surety bond|bond]]. Known as a [[Freight broker bond|Freight Broker Bond]], it exists to cover losses by the motor carrier, in case the broker commits fraud or other lapses. Prior to 2012, the minimum bond was $10,000, although many brokers chose to obtain higher amounts.

==2012 regulations==

The [[Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=WEISMAN|first=JONATHAN|title=Congress Approves a $127 Billion Transportation and Student Loan Package|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/30/us/politics/congress-approves-transportation-and-student-loan-package.html|accessdate=11 December 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=29 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; signed by [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] on July 6 of 2012, introduced a number of new regulations for auto transport brokers. The chief among them is raising the minimum broker bond from $10,000 to $75,000. The new provision goes in force on October 1, 2013, and has applied to all existing brokers retroactively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MAP-21 Broker and Freight Forwarder Questions &amp; Answers |url=http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/documents/MAP-21/Broker-Rule-Questions.pdf |publisher=Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) |accessdate=11 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030073721/http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/documents/MAP-21/Broker-Rule-Questions.pdf |archivedate=October 30, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BMC-84 Freight Broker Bond is paid for on an annual basis. The freight broker bond cost is figured as a percentage of the bond amount depending on 
* Credit of ownership ([[credit score]], age/status of any Public Records)
* Years in Business
* Financials
* Experience
Other rules include:

* A license status review by the FMCSA every five years; the FMCSA also has the power to revoke a broker's license in case of unethical practices.
* A 3-year relevant experience and certified training requirement to obtain a broker license, bringing auto shipping broker qualification requirements in line with the ocean shipping industry.&lt;ref name=forwarderlaw&gt;{{cite web|last=Block|first=Steve|title=MAP-21: New Surface Transportation Legislation Overcomes Political Obstacles to Bring Law Closer to Industry Realities|url=http://www.forwarderlaw.com/library/view.php?article_id=854|publisher=Forwarder Law|accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Tighter regulation of "interlining," the practice of freight carriers hiring other carriers to "perform all or part of the services the originating carrier is obliged" to provide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Seaton|first=Henry|title=Intermodal Moves Make for Messy Law|url=http://www.ccjdigital.com/law-18|publisher=Commercial Carrier Journal|accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now, carriers that contract all or part of the job to other carriers will need to procure separate broker authority from the government. A transport company will also be required to notify its customers what role (carrier, forwarder or broker) it plays at each stage of the transport job, as well as which USDOT body regulates the activity.&lt;ref name=forwarderlaw /&gt;

===Industry Reactions===

The Association of Independent Property Brokers &amp; Agents (AIPBA), a property broker trade group that claims 1,400 members,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About AIPBA |url=http://aipba.vpweb.com/About-AIPBA.html |publisher=Association of Independent Property Brokers &amp; Agents (AIPBA) |accessdate=11 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922091614/http://aipba.vpweb.com/About-AIPBA.html |archivedate=22 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  has petitioned and lobbied against higher bond requirements when these have been proposed in the past,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OPEN LETTER TO OOIDA |url=http://aipba.vpweb.com/OPEN-LETTER-TO-OOIDA.html |publisher=Association of Independent Property Brokers &amp; Agents (AIPBA) |accessdate=11 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228081659/http://aipba.vpweb.com/OPEN-LETTER-TO-OOIDA.html |archivedate=28 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and has harshly criticized the new law. The founder &amp; president of AIPBA, James Lamb, has called the law a lobbyist-driven attempt to "eliminate small brokers from the market" and establish an oligopoly that charges customers more and pays carriers less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dills|first=Todd|title=Small brokers reload on $75K bond|url=http://www.overdriveonline.com/small-brokers-reload-on-75k-bond/|accessdate=11 December 2013|newspaper=OverDrive |date=23 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Association for Minority Truckers (NAfMT)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NAfMT Official Site |url=http://nafmt.com/ |publisher=National Association for Minority Truckers (NAfMT) |accessdate=12 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109023707/http://nafmt.com/ |archivedate=November 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has also come out against the higher bond requirements. NAfMT CEO Kevin Reid called the $75,000 bond an "unreasonable barrier to entry for would-be entrepreneurs." He also spoke out against the new restrictions on owner-operators brokering out excess freight. The NAfMT has joined efforts by AIPBA to repeal the stricter surety requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dills|first=Todd|title=Broker bond increase challenge gets new backer|url=http://www.overdriveonline.com/broker-bond-increase-challenge-gets-new-backer/|accessdate=11 December 2013|newspaper=OverDrive |date=26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other industry associations have been supportive of the law. The [[Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association]] (OOIDA), a group that represents independent trucking owner-operators, has been a key force behind the new regulations. While the final rules in MAP-21 fell short of the OOIDA's wishes, Todd Spencer, executive vice president of the organization, praised them as a "win-win" for truckers and legitimate brokers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller |first=Eric |title=Higher Bond Enrages Small Brokers |url=http://www.steelheadfinance.com/2012/07/higher-bond-enrages-small-brokers |publisher=Steal Head Finance |accessdate=11 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130807064313/http://www.steelheadfinance.com/2012/07/higher-bond-enrages-small-brokers |archivedate=August 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Transportation Intermediaries Association]] (TIA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TIA Official Site |url=http://www.tianet.org/AM/template.cfm?section=Home |publisher=Transportation Intermediaries Association |accessdate=11 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131201084934/http://www.tianet.org/AM/template.cfm?section=Home |archivedate=December 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  a major third-party logistics trade organization, has also advocated for the new FMCSA regulations through its lobbying arm TIAPAC as a way to protect motor carriers from both incompetent and unscrupulous brokers. TIA board member Ken Lund acknowledged that the new bond may be difficult for smaller brokers to pay, but defended it as "reasonably priced" and useful to prevent fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dills|first=Todd|title=Ken Lund: 75K broker bond no ‘large broker’ move|url=http://www.overdriveonline.com/ken-lund-75k-broker-bond-no-large-broker-move/|accessdate=12 December 2013|newspaper=Overdrive|date=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5323">In economics, the '''Backus–Kehoe–Kydland consumption correlation puzzle''', also known as the '''BKK puzzle''', is the observation that [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] is much less [[correlation|correlated]] across countries than [[Output (economics)|output]].

In an [[Arrow–Debreu model|Arrow–Debreu economy]], i.e. an economy with a [[Complete market|complete set of state-contingent markets]], country-specific output risks should be pooled and domestic consumption growth should not depend heavily on country-specific income shocks.  So according to theory we should observe that consumption is much more correlated across countries than output.  What [[David K. Backus|Backus]], [[Patrick J. Kehoe|Kehoe]] and [[Finn Kydland|Kydland]] found in their article from 1992 was the opposite, namely that consumption is much less correlated across countries than output.&lt;ref name="BackusKehoeKydland1992"&gt;{{citation | last1 = Backus | first1 = David K.| last2 = Kehoe | first2 = Patrick J.| last3 = Kydland | first3 = Finn E. | year=1992 |title= International Real Business Cycles | journal = [[Journal of Political Economy]] | volume = 100 | pages = 745–775 | doi = 10.1086/261838 | issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BackusKehoeKydland1995"&gt;{{Citation | last= Backus  | first= David K.  | last2= Kehoe  | first2= Patrick J.  | last3= Kydland  | first3= Finn E.  | year= 1995  | editor-last= Cooley  | editor-first= Tom  | editor-link = Thomas F. Cooley | contribution= International Business Cycles: Theory and Evidence  | title=Frontiers of Business Cycle Research | publisher= Princeton University Press  | isbn = 0-691-04323-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Backus, Kehoe, and Kydland (1992) calculate the correlation of [[Hodrick–Prescott filter|HP-filtered]] consumption and output for 11 advanced countries relative to the US. The measured average consumption correlation was .19, whereas the average output correlation was .31. [[Maurice Obstfeld|Obstfeld]] and [[Kenneth Rogoff|Rogoff]] (1996)&lt;ref name="ObstfeldRogoff1996"&gt;{{Citation | last= Obstfeld   | first= Maurice  | last2= Rogoff  | first2= Kenneth  | year= 1996 | title= Foundations of International Macroeconomics   | publisher= The MIT Press  | isbn = 978-0-262-15047-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  reports average correlation of OECD countries with world consumption (35 “benchmark” countries) of .43, whereas the average OECD country’s output correlation with world benchmark is 0.52. The really puzzling part of these results is not that consumption levels are not perfectly correlated, but that they are less correlated than output.  Apparently, there is hardly any risk sharing.

Obstfeld and Rogoff (2000) identifies this as one of the six major puzzles in international economics.&lt;ref name="ObstfeldRogoff2000"&gt;{{Citation  | last= Obstfeld   | first= Maurice  | last2= Rogoff  | first2= Kenneth  | year= 2000  | editor-last= Bernanke 
 | editor-first= Ben  | editor2-last= Rogoff  | editor2-first= Kenneth  | contribution= The Six Major Puzzles in International Macroeconomics: Is There a Common Cause?  | title=NBER Macroeconomics Annual 2000  | volume = 15  | pages = 339–390  | publisher= The MIT Press  | isbn = 0-262-02503-5
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The others are the [[home bias in trade puzzle]], the [[equity home bias puzzle]], the [[Feldstein-Horioka puzzle|Feldstein-Horioka savings-investment correlations puzzle]], [[Real exchange-rate puzzles|the purchasing power and exchange rate disconnect puzzle]], and the Baxter-Stockman neutrality of exchange rate regime puzzle. It is also related to the [[Backus-Smith puzzle|Backus-Smith consumption-real exchange rate puzzle]].&lt;ref name="BackusSmith92"&gt;{{citation | last1 = Backus | first1 = David K.| last2 = Smith| first2 = Gregor W.| year=1993 |title= Consumption and real exchange rates in dynamic economies with non-traded goods | journal =Journal of International Economics | volume = 35| pages = 297–316 | doi = 10.1016/0022-1996(93)90021-O | issue = 3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attempts to account for the perceived anomaly ==
Stockman and Tesar (1995)&lt;ref name="StockmanTeser1995"&gt;{{citation | last1 = Stockman | first1 = Alan C.| last2 = Tesar | first2 = Linda L. | year=1995 |title= Tastes and Technology in a Two-Country Model of the Business Cycle: Explaining International Comovements | journal = [[American Economic Review]] | volume = 85 | pages = 168–185 | issue=1 | jstor=2118002}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests two means of breaking the link between prices and quantities and making it hard for households to smooth consumption by trade.  The first is nontraded goods: Suppose households like to consume goods that cannot be traded, like some services. If there is a positive technology shock raising their supply, they can’t [[consumption smoothing|smooth their consumption]] of these goods by exporting them abroad.  The second is "taste shocks": If consumption rises in one country without any change in the economic environment, it will borrow abroad, driving up the interest rate and inducing the foreign country to cut back on its consumption. So consumption could be negatively correlated across countries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1947">{{Banking |image=London.bankofengland.arp.jpg |caption=The [[Bank of England]], established in 1694.}}A '''banker's lien''' is a legal right arise in many [[common law jurisdictions]] of a [[bank]] to exercise a [[lien]] over any property in the custody of the bank as security for the indebtedness of the customer to the bank.&lt;ref name=Ellinger&gt;{{cite book |author1=E.P.

==Scope==
The precise effect of a banker's lien varies according to the laws of a particular jurisdiction.  Under English common law it applies to all property coming into the possession of the bank in the usual course of banking business,&lt;ref&gt;''Brandao v Barnett'' (1846) 12 Cl 7 F 787&lt;/ref&gt; subject to the important exception that it does not apply to property which is deposited with the bank for safe custody.&lt;ref&gt;''Leese v Martin'' (1873) LR 17 Eq 224 at 235.  The bank holds such property as [[bailment|bailee]], and may be entitled to exercise a separate lien as such.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst most common law liens normally only give the lienee a passive right to retain the property, unusually, the banker's lien permits the bank the sell the relevant property.&lt;ref&gt;''Rosenberg v International Banking Corporation'' (1923) 14 Ll LR 344 at 347&lt;/ref&gt;

The lien does not generally extend to intangible rights, including credit balances on accounts.  However those credit balances may be subject to the [[banker's right to combine accounts]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[National Westminster Bank Ltd v Halesowen Presswork &amp; Assemblies Ltd]]'' [1972] AC 785&lt;/ref&gt;

The banker's lien may be modified or abrogated by agreement.&lt;ref name=Ellinger /&gt;

The '''Big Five''' ({{lang-haw|Nā Hui Nui {{okina}}Elima}}) was the name given to a group of what started as [[sugarcane]] processing [[corporations]] that wielded considerable political power in the [[Territory of Hawaii]] during the early 20th century and leaned heavily towards the [[Republican Party of Hawaii|Hawaii Republican Party]]. The Big Five were [[Castle &amp; Cooke]], [[Alexander &amp; Baldwin]], [[C. Brewer &amp; Co.]], American Factors (now [[Amfac (Hawaii)|Amfac]]), and [[Theo H. Davies &amp; Co.]]&lt;ref name="adv"&gt;{{cite news |title=Isle institutions’ economic impact endures |author=Lyn Danninger |url=http://starbulletin.com/2002/09/29/special/story3.html |publisher=[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]] |date=September 29, 2002 |accessdate= 2010-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The extent of the power that the Big Five had was considered by some as equivalent to an [[oligarchy]]. [[Attorney General of Hawaii]] [[Edmund Pearson Dole]], referring to the Big Five, said in 1903, "There is a government in this Territory which is centralized to an extent unknown in the United States, and probably almost as centralized as it was in France under [[Louis XIV]]."&lt;ref name="benham1998"&gt;{{cite book |title=Culture and educational policy in Hawaiʻi: the silencing of native voices |year=1998 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=0-8058-2704-8 |author=Maenette Kapeʻahiokalani Padeken Ah Nee-Benham |author2=Ronald H.

== History ==
Sugar plantations in Hawaii had a slow start, although the plant had been cultivated for hundreds of years.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  When Hawaii was [[Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii#Annexation|annexed by the United States]], change came rapidly as sugarcane [[Sugar plantations in Hawaii|plantation]]s gained a new infusion of investment.  By eliminating tariffs imposed on sugarcane producers by the United States, planters had more money to spend on equipment, land and labor.  Increased capital resulted in increased production.  Five kingdom-era corporations benefited from annexation, becoming multimillion-dollar conglomerations that controlled 90% of the sugar business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |hdl= 10524/462 |title= German Sugar's Sticky Fingers |journal= Hawaiian Journal of History |publisher=Hawaiian Historical Society |volume= 16 |author= Frederick Bernays Wiener |year= 1982  |pages= 15–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The companies colluded to keep the prices on their goods and services high.  Their profits skyrocketed even more.  Soon, the executives of the Big Five sat on each other's boards of directors.  With economic power came political power, and the families usually favored the [[Republican Party of Hawaii]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Where Aristocrats Do the Hula and Vote Republican; Land and Commerce Screens From Japan New England Heritage Attended Punahou Cousins Society Plumeria and Orchids |date= November 27, 1966 |author1= Charlotte Curtis |author2= Carl T.

During the [[Hawaii Democratic Revolution of 1954|Democratic Revolution of 1954]], the [[Trade union|unions]] inflicted a decisive blow against the giants and the sugar industry declined after [[Hawaii]] became a state in 1959; so did each of the Big Five companies.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} The greatest post-statehood challenge came as the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] challenged the ownership of [[Matson Navigation Company]] by four of the five companies (all except Theo H. Davies).  The lawsuit was settled when the four companies agreed not to share officers, executives, and directors.  Alexander and Baldwin eventually bought out the other three stakes in Matson in 1964.&lt;ref name="adv"/&gt;

In the 1970s, as sugar plantations closed, many of the Big Five companies themselves were bought out.  Where the companies are now:{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

* [[Theo H. Davies]] was bought in 1973 by Scottish-controlled Hong Kong firm [[Jardine Matheson Holdings|Jardine Matheson]]. Until December 2004 it owned the [[Pizza Hut]] and [[Taco Bell]] franchises in Hawaii.
* [[C. Brewer]] was bought in 1978 by Philadelphia-based [[IU International]], and was later bought out by its management in 1986.  In 2001 the company's shareholders voted to liquidate the company over several years.
* [[Castle &amp; Cooke]] merged with [[Flexi-Van Corporation]], owned by [[David H. Murdock]], in 1985. Murdock became its chairman after the merger, then took full control in 2000.  It still owns large portions of Central [[Oahu|O{{okina}}ahu]] and the Iwilei area of [[Honolulu]] around the former [[Dole Food Company]] pineapple cannery.  Until recently, Castle &amp; Cooke owned nearly all of the island of [[Lanai|Lāna{{okina}}i]]; in June 2012, Oracle CEO [[Larry Ellison]] bought their share for approximately half a billion dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2012/06/20/BAT21P5CLG.DTL&amp;tsp=1 |date=20 June 2012 |last=Lagos |first=Maria |title=Oracle's Ellison is buying a Hawaiian island |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Amfac]] was bought out in 1988 by Chicago-based [[JMB Realty]].  In 2002 Amfac declared [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] and emerged as Kaanapali Land, LLC.  It owns 5,000 acres (20&amp;nbsp;km²) in West Maui.  Its department store, [[Liberty House (US)|Liberty House]], was sold to [[Federated Department Stores]] and is now part of the [[Macy's]] chain.
* [[Alexander &amp; Baldwin]] diversified and remains in business. Today it owns about 91,000 acres (370&amp;nbsp;km²) of land and is the fifth-largest landowner in the state.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

==In fiction==
The domination of Hawaii by the Big Five forms much of the background for the book ''[[The Revolt of Mamie Stover]]'', describing the life of a prostitute in Hawaii in the 1940s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

James Michener's fictionalized account of Hawaiian history, ''[[Hawaii (novel)|Hawaii]]'' included references to the Big Five, which he called "the Fort".{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

The Big Five are mentioned briefly in [[Harry Turtledove]]'s ''[[Days of Infamy series]]'', an [[alternate history]] where [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] forces completely occupy Hawaii during World War II.

The Big Five are mentioned in Kaye Starbird's THE LION IN THE LEI SHOP (p.&amp;nbsp;43).

The [[Brazilian Penal Code]] defines an official or civil servant as follows: "Article 327 - ... those who, although temporarily or without pay, hold a position, employment or public usefulness. § 1 - Equivalent to a public official who holds a position, job or function in parastatal entity, and who works for the company providing the service or the private contractor for the execution of activity typical of public administration. "

==Legal Regime of Civil Servants==
Originally, the [[Constitution of Brazil]] had established a single legal regime that would apply to Federal entities for all hires. Subsequently, Constitutional Amendment number 19 relaxed this requirement by establishing the possibility of adopting the statutory regime or Hired Under Employment Laws, but was reinstated after the foregoing assessment of ADIn 2135.
The regulation of the legal regime of civil servants federal government, local and federal public foundations is carried out in Brazil under Federal Law no. 8.112/1990. Are not included in the legal regime established by this Act that federal employees are governed by the dictates of the [[Consolidation of Labor Laws]] and Federal Law no. 9.962/2000.
It should be understood that under the Federal Constitution of 1988, both regimes must respect constitutionally established rules, for example, all accepted by the public employer shall be subject to a tender or selection process.

Thus, in Brazil so-called statutory servants (connected to the system of Federal Law no. 8112) and servants called ''celetistas'', which obey the Consolidation of Labor Laws.
However, in order to grant interim with ''[[ex nunc]]'' effect on the date of August 2, 2007 ADIn in 2135, which suspended the effectiveness of EC 19 in that it modifies the chapeau of Article 39 for violation of the CF/1988 Article 60, II, of CF/1988 (vice-initiative), the Legal One has been restored.

==Tenure==
The term ''civil servant'' and ''tenured servant'' appear in the [[Constitution of Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Constitution of the Federative Republic of Brazil |quote=Constitutional text of October 5, 1988, with the alterations introduced by Constitutional Amendments No. 1/1992 through 64/2010 and by Revision Constitutional Amendments No. 1/1994 through 6/1994; translation: year 2010, 3rd edition. |publisher=[[Chamber of Deputies of Brazil|Chamber of Deputies]], Documentation and Information Center, Publishing Coordination |year=1988 |url=http://english.tse.jus.br/arquivos/federal-constitution}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 41 of the Federal Constitution states that "Servants who, by virtue of public entrance examinations, are appointed to effective posts, acquire tenure after three years of actual service."

Civil servants are listed as a category of public servants: they are permanent staff, professionals in the service of public administration. The [[Penal Code of Brazil|Brazilian Penal Code]], however, refers to a public official, which has a broader scope than the public servant. A board member, for example, who exercises a public function (help in the electoral process), is a civilian employee (in respect of acts performed as a board member), despite a transient and unpaid public role.

==Entrance==
Filling is the administrative act of filling public office in Brazil regulated by Law No. 8112 of November 11, 1990 [1].
Under the legislation, the provision may be given by appointment, promotion, rehabilitation, recovery, recovery, reintegration and renewal.Each of these forms of provision has a special significance in public administration and specify the legal form of access to public office in Brazil.

==Compensation==
The fee payment for services rendered to the state civil servant is given as follows:
*I Maturity: the cash consideration for the exercise of public office, with the rate fixed by law;
*II Remuneration: Salary is the effective position, plus the permanent pecuniary advantages determined by law;
*III Grant: is the exclusive and fixed fee payment in a lump sum, sealed the addition of any bonus, extra, bonus, award, grant or other type of representation remuneration. This type of pay is not the general rule and applies to cases that the law specify;
Earning. 
*IV: the return of money paid to exercente of public office when going from activity to inactivity, or when he retires;
*V board: cash is retribution paid to the persons to whom the law attributes the condition of receiving the public servant who died.
CF/88 Article 39 § 4: The State of Power, the holder of an elective office, Ministers of State and Municipal and State Secretaries shall be paid exclusively by fixed allowance in a lump sum, sealed the addition of any bonus, additional allowance, award, grant or other type of representation remuneration, obeyed in any case the provisions of art. 37, X and X
Any salary within the public service may exceed the value of allowances paid to Justices of the Supreme Court (STF) and the salaries of the offices of the Legislative and the Judiciary can not be higher than those paid by the executive. Despite these rules exist, many people are wondering if they are indeed obeyed.

'''Brisk''' is a tea and juice [[brand]] managed by the [[Pepsi]] [[Lipton]] Partnership,  in 1991 between [[PepsiCo]] and [[Unilever]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Levere|first=Jane|title=To Promote Brisk Tea, Pepsi Enlists Yoda|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/03/business/media/to-promote-brisk-tea-pepsi-enlists-the-aid-of-yoda.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, PepsiCo announced Brisk had surpassed $1 billion in annual revenue, making it one of the 22 billion-dollar PepsiCo brands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PepsiCo says 3 more brands hit $1B mark|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/APbf99522f7e774a50be54018d9ccc2342|publisher=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Prior to being reformulated Brisk contained approximately 44 grams (11 teaspoons) of sugars per 16-ounce can.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How a Former Dentist Drilled the Sugar Industry|url=https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2012/10/former-dentist-sugar-industry-lies|publisher=Mother Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since being reformulated with [[sucralose]], the amount of sugars has been reduced in most varieties by approximately half.

Brisk is well known for its high-profile “That’s Brisk, baby!” campaigns. The [[J. Walter Thompson]] ad agency first launched the campaign in 1996, featuring pop-culture icons in [[Clay animation|claymation]], and was revived in 2010 by creative agency Mekanism. The advertisements highlight exhausted celebrities who are dramatically reinvigorated by drinking Brisk. [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Willie Nelson]], [[Bruce Lee]], [[Danny DeVito]], [[Bruce Willis]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Sylvester Stallone]], [[Danny Trejo]] and [[Eminem]] have all been featured in Brisk spots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Agency News|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising/agency-news-37835|publisher=Adweek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to compete with the [[Arizona Beverage Company]]'s line of 99-cent iced tea cans, Lipton Brisk expanded its line of products in 2010 and lowered the price of its one-liter bottles to 99 cents. Brisk currently offers lemon iced tea, raspberry iced tea, [[sweet tea]], peach [[green tea]], green tea with mango dragonfruit, diet tea with lemon, [[Arnold Palmer (drink)|fusion iced tea with lemonade]], honey and ginseng iced tea, fusion white tea with pink lemonade, strawberry melon, fruit punch, lemonade, and diet lemonade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official Site for PepsiCo Beverage Information|url=http://www.pepsicobeveragefacts.com/infobycategory.php?pc=brand.1044.1005&amp;s=8&amp;t=1026&amp;i=ntrtn|publisher=PepsiCo|accessdate=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Brisk broke into [[eSports]] with their sponsorship of [[OpTic Gaming]], one of the premiere North American multi-gaming organizations; through their ''Brisk Mate'' brand. In 2017, Brisk continue their second-year sponsorship with OpTic Gaming with their ''Brisk'' brand.

=== Urban art ===
In 2010, Brisk refreshed its packaging by commissioning artwork from prominent [[urban art]]ists, including Matt W. Moore, SOPA, Colletivo, [[Tristan Eaton]], McFaul Studio, and ILOVEDUST.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official Lipton Brisk Page|url=http://www.liptonbrisk.com/#/artists/|publisher=PepsiCo}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brand then launched a competition which asked emerging artists to "have a sip and illustrate the trip" for an opportunity to see their artwork on a Brisk package.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lipton Brisk Iced Tea’s Brisk Emerging Artist Contest|url=http://www.artslant.com/chi/articles/show/15796}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brisk also holds the Brisk Bodega, a multi-city pop-up gallery. The bodega has featured artwork from [[street artist]]s such as [[Mark Dean Veca]], Dual Forces, POSE, and Jasper Wong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OPENING: BRISK BODEGA X STARS WARS EPISODE I IN LOS ANGELES|url=http://www.juxtapoz.com/Current/opening-brisk-bodega-x-stars-wars-episode-i-in-los-angeles|publisher=Juxtapoz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brisk Bodega Debuts a Pop-Up Spot Dedicated to Art, Music, and Star Wars Episode One|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2012/02/promo-brisk-bodega-debuts-a-pop-up-spot-dedicated-to-art-music-and-star-wars-episode-one|publisher=Complex Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social marketing ===
Brisk has partnered with digital and social technologies such as [[Instagram]], [[Foursquare (website)|Foursquare]], and StickyBits.  In 2010, Brisk worked with StickyBits to commission teams of urban artists in New York and LA to paint Brisk-inspired murals in each city. Each mural contained a barcode that could be scanned with a handheld device to show a video of the mural being created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lipton Brisk Rolls Out Interactive Murals|url=http://mashable.com/2010/12/16/lipton-brisk-rolls-out-interactive-murals/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brisk also forged a partnership with Foursquare to do a PepsiCo-Hess promotion—one of the first cases in which a CPG company worked directly with a retailer to drive in-store purchases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Check-In to Real Branding's Brisk (PepsiCo)+Hess+Foursquare Campaign|url=http://tarah.me/real-branding-foursquare-campaign-for-pepsi-h}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Brisk invited fans to tag their photos with the hashtag #briskpic for a chance to be included on a limited edition can, which was unveiled at [[SXSW]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Brands Are Using Instagram to Reach New Audiences|url=http://mashable.com/2011/03/02/instagram-brands/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Star Wars campaign ===
In 2012, Brisk joined forces with Star Wars for the 3-D theatrical release of ''[[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace]]''. A 30-second spot leading the campaign features Briskified Yoda and Darth Maul, facing off for the first time. Special Star Wars-themed cans were only available through a grassroots mobile marketing and sampling tour.  The Brisk brand also launched a mobile gaming experience called Brisksaber, which brings the iconic Star Wars lightsaber battles to Android and Apple mobile devices. The app rewards fans by unlocking new characters, vehicles, and weapons by redeeming under-the-cap codes from the one liter bottles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Levere|first=Jane|title=To Promote Brisk Tea, Pepsi Enlists Yoda|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/03/business/media/to-promote-brisk-tea-pepsi-enlists-the-aid-of-yoda.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ICBSA Verdi - Il trovatore, Stride la vampa.jpg|thumb|right|Image of a 78rpm of an aria from Giuseppe Verdi's Il trovatore, recorded by Cetra]]
'''Cetra Records''' was an Italian company which produced [[opera]] recordings from the 1930s onwards. Its roster of artists included [[Maria Callas]], [[Renata Tebaldi]], [[Lina Pagliughi]], [[Ebe Stignani]], [[Carlo Bergonzi (tenor)|Carlo Bergonzi]], [[Galliano Masini]], [[Giovanni Malipiero]], [[Ferruccio Tagliavini]], [[Carlo Tagliabue]], [[Rolando Panerai]], [[Italo Tajo]],  [[Giuseppe Taddei]], [[Tancredi Pasero]] and [[Cesare Siepi]], among other leading Italian opera singers. 

The company achieved something of a triumph in the early 1950s when it produced many recordings of obscure or seldom heard [[Verdi]] operas to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the composer's death in 1901. Cetra recordings are often now reissued by the company [[Warner Fonit Cetra]]. Cetra opera albums were distributed in the United States on the Cetra-Soria label (founded by [[Dario Soria]] and Dorle Soria, who later founded [[Angel Records]]). Beginning in 1966, several Cetra opera recordings were issued in the United States by [[Everest Records]]. &lt;ref&gt;Creativity and Innovation in the Music Industry - Page 111 Peter Tschmuck - 2006 "In turn, he founded Cetra-Soria, which released Italian recordings in the U.S. that were pressed at record plants specifically"&lt;/ref&gt;

Cetra Records also produced popular music recordings from at least the [[World War II]] years through the 1960s.  One of their instrumental artists is accordionist Michele Corino, a soloist with Italy's prominent "Orchestra Angelini" until he moved to San Francisco, California, in 1948. "Mike" ran a prominent accordion studio in "North Beach Music" (a.k.a. Corino Music) and taught, worked and recorded with brothers Fabio and Gianfranco Giotta, part of the San Francisco-based Caffe Trieste (see also "Cavalier Records", "Caffe Trieste" and "Trieste Records"). Gianfranco shared the studio with Mike on the 1963 Cetra album titled "Rome to Paris".

'''Clarence Seward Darrow''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ær|oʊ}}; April 18, 1857 – March 13, 1938) was an American lawyer, a leading member of the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], and a prominent advocate for [[Georgist]] economic reform. He defended high-profile clients in many famous trials of the early 20th century, including teenage [[thrill killing|thrill killers]] [[Leopold and Loeb]] for murdering 14-year-old Robert "Bobby" Franks (1924); teacher [[John T. Scopes]] in the [[Scopes Trial|Scopes "Monkey" Trial]] (1925), in which he opposed statesman and orator [[William Jennings Bryan]]; and [[Ossian Sweet]] in a racially charged self-defense case (1926). Called a "sophisticated country lawyer",&lt;ref name="Linder1997"&gt;Linder, Douglas O. (1997).

==Early life==
Clarence Darrow was born in the small town of [[Kinsman, Ohio]], on April 18, 1857,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Darrow|first=Clarence|title=The Story of My Life|year=1932|publisher=Grosset and Dunlap|location=New York|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; the fifth son of Amirus and Emily Darrow (née Eddy). Both the Darrow and Eddy families had deep roots in colonial [[New England]], and several of Darrow's ancestors served in the [[American Revolution]]. Darrow's father was an ardent [[abolitionism|abolitionist]] and a proud iconoclast and religious freethinker. He was known throughout the town as the "village infidel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Darrow|first=Clarence|title=The Story of My Life|year=1932|publisher=Grosset and Dunlap|location=New York|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emily Darrow was an early supporter of [[female suffrage]] and a [[women's rights]] advocate.

The young Clarence attended [[Allegheny College]] and the [[University of Michigan Law School]], but did not graduate from either institution. He attended Allegheny College for only one year before the [[Panic of 1873]] struck, and Darrow was determined not to be a financial burden to his father any longer. Over the next three years he taught in the winter at the district school in a country community. While teaching, Darrow started to [[Reading law|study the law]] on his own, and by the end of his third year of teaching, his family urged him to enter the law department at Ann Arbor. Darrow only studied there a year when he decided that it would be much more cost-effective to work and study in an actual law office. When he felt that he was ready, he took the Ohio bar exam and passed.&lt;ref name="Darrow 1932"&gt;{{cite book|last=Darrow|first=Clarence|title=The Story of My Life|year=1932|publisher=Grosset and Dunlap|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was admitted to the Ohio bar in 1878. The [[Clarence Darrow Octagon House]], his childhood home in Kinsman, contains a memorial to him.

===Marriages and child===
Darrow married Jessie Ohl in April 1880. They had one child, Paul Edward Darrow, in 1883. They were divorced in 1897. Darrow later married Ruby Hammerstrom, a journalist 16 years his junior, in 1903. They had no children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clarence Darrow- Early Life and Law Career|url=http://law.jrank.org/pages/12186/Darrow-Clarence-Early-life-law-career.html|website=jrank|accessdate=April 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal career==

Darrow opened his first little law office in [[Andover, Ohio]], a small farming town just ten miles from Kinsman. Having little to no experience, he started off slowly and gradually built up his career by dealing with the everyday complaints and problems of a farming community. After two years Darrow felt he was ready to take on new and different cases and moved his practice to [[Ashtabula, Ohio]], which had a population of 5,000 people and was the largest city in the county.&lt;ref name="Darrow 1932"/&gt; There he became involved in Democratic Party politics and served as the town counsel.

In 1880, he married Jessie Ohl, and eight years later he moved to Chicago with his wife and young son, Paul. He did not have much business when he first moved to Chicago, and spent as little as possible. He joined the Henry George Club and made some friends and connections in the city. Being part of the club also gave him an opportunity to speak for the Democratic Party on the upcoming election. He slowly made a name for himself through these speeches, eventually earning the standing to speak in whatever hall he liked. He was offered work as an attorney for the city of Chicago. Darrow worked in the city law department for two years when he resigned and took a position as a lawyer at the Chicago and North-Western Railway Company.&lt;ref name="Darrow 1932"/&gt; In 1894, Darrow represented [[Eugene V. Debs]], the leader of the [[American Railway Union]], who was prosecuted by the federal government for leading the [[Pullman Strike]] of 1894. Darrow severed his ties with the railroad to represent Debs, making a financial sacrifice. He saved Debs in one trial but could not keep him from being jailed in another.

Also in 1894, Darrow took on the first murder case of his career, defending [[Patrick Eugene Prendergast]], the "mentally deranged drifter" who had confessed to murdering Chicago mayor [[Carter Harrison, Sr.]]&lt;ref name="answers.com"&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/clarence-darrow Clarence Darrow: Biography and Much More from Answers.com&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at www.answers.com&lt;/ref&gt; Darrow's "insanity defense" failed and Prendergast was executed that same year. Among fifty defenses in murder cases throughout the whole of Darrow's career, the Prendergast case would prove to be the only one resulting in an execution, though Darrow did not join the defense team until after Prendergast's conviction and sentence, in an effort to spare him the noose.&lt;ref name="answers.com"/&gt;

===From corporate lawyer to labor lawyer===

Darrow soon became one of America's leading labor attorneys. He helped organize the [[People's Party (United States)|Populist Party]] in Illinois and then ran for U.S. Congress as a Democrat in 1895 but lost to [[Hugh R. Belknap]]. In 1897, his marriage to Jessie Ohl ended in divorce. He joined the [[American Anti-Imperialist League|Anti-Imperialist League]] in 1898 in opposition to the [[Governor-General of the Philippines#United States Military Government (1898–1901)|U.S. annexation of the Philippines]]. He represented the woodworkers of Wisconsin in a notable case in Oshkosh in 1898 and the [[United Mine Workers of America|United Mine Workers]] in Pennsylvania in the [[coal strike of 1902|great anthracite coal strike of 1902]]. He flirted with the idea of running for mayor of Chicago in 1903 but ultimately decided against it. The following year, in July, Darrow married Ruby Hammerstrom, a young Chicago journalist.&lt;ref&gt;Passport application, accessed through familysearch.org&lt;/ref&gt; His former mentor, Governor [[John Peter Altgeld]], joined Darrow's firm following his Chicago mayoral electoral defeat in 1899 and worked with Darrow until his death in 1902.

[[File:ClarenceDarrow1902.PNG|thumb|Clarence Darrow in 1902&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Donovan|first1=Henry|title=Chicago Eagle|url=http://idnc.library.illinois.edu/cgi-bin/illinois?a=d&amp;d=CHE19021220&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-------#|website=Illinois Digital Newspaper Collections|accessdate=July 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
From 1906 to 1908, Darrow represented the [[Western Federation of Miners]] leaders [[William "Big Bill" Haywood]], [[Charles Moyer]], and [[George Pettibone]] when they were arrested and charged with conspiring to murder former Idaho Governor [[Frank Steunenberg]] in 1905. Haywood and Pettibone were found not guilty in separate trials, and the charges against Moyer were then dropped.

In 1911, the [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL) called on Darrow to defend the [[McNamara brothers]], John and James, who were charged in the [[Los Angeles Times bombing|Los Angeles ''Times'' bombing]] on October 1, 1910, during the bitter struggle over the [[open shop]] in Southern California. The bomb had been placed in an alley behind the building, and although the explosion itself did not bring the building down, it ignited nearby ink barrels and natural gas main lines. In the ensuing fire, 20 people were killed. The AFL appealed to local, state, regional and national unions to donate 25 cents per capita to the defense fund, and set up defense committees in larger cities throughout the nation to accept donations.

In the weeks before the jury was seated, Darrow became increasingly concerned about the outcome of the trial and began negotiations for a plea bargain to spare the defendants' lives. During the weekend of November 19–20, 1911, he discussed with pro-labor journalist [[Lincoln Steffens]] and newspaper publisher [[E.W. Scripps]] the possibility of reaching out to the ''Times'' about the terms of a plea agreement. The prosecution had demands of its own, however, including an admission of guilt in open court and longer sentences than the defense proposed.&lt;ref name="Darrow"&gt;Darrow, Clarence. ''The Story of My Life'', 1932. [http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500951h.html Project Guttenberg.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Foner"&gt;Foner, Phillip S. ''History of the Labor Movement in the United States: The AFL in the Progressive Era, 1910–1915'', 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

The defense's position weakened when, on November 28, Darrow was accused of orchestrating to bribe a prospective juror. The juror reported the offer to police, who set up a sting and observed the defense team's chief investigator, Bert Franklin, delivering $4,000 to the juror two blocks away from Darrow's office. After making payment, Franklin walked one block in the direction of Darrow's office before being arrested right in front of Darrow himself, who had just walked to that very intersection after receiving a phone call in his office. With Darrow himself on the verge of being discredited, the defense's hope for a simple plea agreement ended.&lt;ref name="Farrell"&gt;Farrell, John A. "[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/Clarence-Darrow-Jury-Tamperer.html Darrow in the Dock]". ''Smithsonian Magazine'', December 2011, Volume 42, Number 8, pp. 98–111.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cowan"&gt;Cowan, ''The People v. Clarence Darrow: The Bribery Trial of America's Greatest Lawyer'', 1994&lt;/ref&gt; On December 1, 1911, the McNamara brothers changed their pleas to guilty, in open court. The plea bargain Darrow helped arrange earned John fifteen years and James life imprisonment. Despite sparing the brothers the death penalty, Darrow was accused by many in organized labor of selling the movement out.

Two months later, Darrow was charged with two counts of attempting to bribe jurors in both cases. He faced two lengthy trials. In the first, defended by [[Earl Rogers]], he was acquitted. Rogers became ill during the second trial and rarely came to court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cowan|first=Geoffrey|title=The People V. Clarence Darrow: The Bribery Trial of America's Greatest Lawyer|year=1993|publisher=Random House|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darrow served as his own attorney for the remainder of the trial, which ended with a [[hung jury]]. A deal was struck in which the district attorney agreed not to retry Darrow if he promised not to practice law again in California.&lt;ref&gt;see in "Clarence Darrow: A Sentimental Rebel" by Arthur and Lila Weinberg.&lt;/ref&gt; Darrow's early biographers, [[Irving Stone]] and Arthur and Lila Weinberg, asserted that he was not involved in the bribery conspiracy, but more recently, Geoffrey Cowan and John A. Farrell, with the help of new evidence, concluded that he almost certainly was.&lt;ref name="Farrell" /&gt; In the biography of Earl Rogers by his daughter [[Adela Rogers St. Johns|Adela]], she wrote: "I never had any doubts, even before one of my father's private conversations with Darrow included an admission of guilt to his lawyer."&lt;ref&gt;Adela Rogers St. Johns: ''Final Verdict'', (Doubleday, 1962) 457.&lt;/ref&gt;

===From labor lawyer to criminal lawyer===

[[File:Clarence Darrow cph.3b31130.jpg|thumb|upright|Darrow in 1913]]

As a consequence of the bribery charges, most labor unions dropped Darrow from their list of preferred attorneys. This effectively put Darrow out of business as a labor lawyer, and he switched to civil and criminal cases. He took the latter because he had become convinced that the criminal justice system could ruin people's lives if they were not adequately represented.&lt;ref name="Riggenbach"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Riggenbach|first=Jeff|title=Clarence Darrow on Freedom, Justice, and War |journal=Mises Daily |publisher=[[Ludwig von Mises Institute]] |date=March 25, 2011|url=https://mises.org/daily/5147/Clarence-Darrow-on-Freedom-Justice-and-War}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his career, Darrow devoted himself to opposing the [[capital punishment in the United States|death penalty]], which he felt to be in conflict with [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian]] progress. In more than 100 cases, Darrow only lost one murder case in Chicago. He became renowned for moving juries and even judges to tears with his eloquence. Darrow had a keen intellect often hidden by his rumpled, unassuming appearance.

A July 23, 1915, article in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' describes Darrow's effort on behalf of J.H. Fox, an [[Evanston, Illinois]], landlord, to have Mary S. Brazelton committed to an insane asylum against the wishes of her family. Fox alleged that Brazelton owed him rent money, although other residents of Fox's boarding house testified to her sanity.

===National renown===

====Leopold and Loeb====

In the summer of 1924, Darrow took on the case of [[Leopold and Loeb|Nathan Leopold Jr. and Richard Loeb]], the teenage sons of two wealthy Chicago families who were accused of kidnapping and killing [[Bobby Franks]], a 14-year-old boy, from their stylish southside [[Kenwood, Chicago|Kenwood]] neighborhood. Leopold was a law student at the [[University of Chicago]] about to transfer to [[Harvard Law School]], and Loeb was the youngest graduate ever from the University of Michigan; they were 18 and 17, respectively, when they were arrested.&lt;ref name="Darrow 1932"/&gt; When asked why they committed the crime, Leopold told his captors: "The thing that prompted Dick to want to do this thing and prompted me to want to do this thing was a sort of pure love of excitement... the imaginary love of thrills, doing something different... the satisfaction and the ego of putting something over."

Chicago newspapers labeled the case the "[[Trial of the Century]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/trials5.htm JURIST – The Trial of Leopold and Loeb] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101103143040/http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/trials5.htm |date=November 3, 2010 }}, Prof. Douglas Linder. Retrieved November 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and Americans around the country wondered what could drive the two young men, blessed with everything their society could offer, to commit such a depraved act. The killers had been arrested after a passing workman spotted the victim's body in an isolated nature preserve near the Indiana border just half a day after it was hidden, before they could collect a $10,000 ransom. Nearby were Leopold's eyeglasses with their distinctive, traceable frames, which he had dropped at the scene.

Leopold and Loeb made full confessions and took police on a hunt around Chicago to collect the evidence that would be used against them. The state's attorney told the press that he had a "hanging case" for sure. Darrow stunned the prosecution when he had his clients plead guilty in order to avoid a vengeance-minded jury and place the case before a judge. The trial, then, was actually a long sentencing hearing in which Darrow contended, with the help of expert testimony, that Leopold and Loeb were mentally diseased.

Darrow's closing argument lasted 12 hours. He repeatedly stressed the ages of the "boys" (before the Vietnam War, the age of majority was 21) and noted that "never had there been a case in Chicago where on a plea of guilty a boy under 21 had been sentenced to death." His plea was designed to soften the heart of Judge John Caverly, but also to mold public opinion, so that Caverly could follow precedent without too huge an uproar. Darrow succeeded. Caverly sentenced Leopold and Loeb to life in prison plus 99 years. Darrow's closing argument was published in several editions in the late 1920s and early 1930s, and was reissued at the time of his death.&lt;ref name="Riggenbach" /&gt;

The Leopold and Loeb case raised, in a well-publicized trial, Darrow's lifelong contention that psychological, physical, and environmental influences—not a conscious choice between right and wrong—control human behavior. Darrow's psychiatric expert witnesses testified that both boys "were decidedly deficient in emotion". Darrow later argued that emotion is necessary for the decisions that people make. When someone tries to go against a certain law or custom that is forbidden, he wrote, he should feel a sense of revulsion. As neither Leopold nor Loeb had a working emotional system, they did not feel revolted.&lt;ref name="Darrow 1932"/&gt;

During the trial, the newspapers claimed that Darrow was presenting a "million dollar defense" for the two wealthy families. Many ordinary Americans were angered at his apparent greed. He had the families issue a statement insisting that there would be no large legal fees and that his fees would be determined by a committee composed of officers from the [[Chicago Bar Association]]. After trial, Darrow suggested $200,000 would be reasonable. After lengthy negotiations with the defendants' families, he ended up getting some $70,000 in gross fees, which, after expenses and taxes, netted Darrow $30,000, worth over $375,000 in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;''See'', A. Weinberg, ed., ''Attorney for the Damned'', pp. 17–18, n. 1 (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1957)); Hulbert papers, Northwestern University.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scopes Trial====

[[File:Clarence S Darrow.jpg|thumb|right|Clarence Darrow circa 1925]]

In 1925, Darrow defended [[John T. Scopes]] in the ''[[Scopes Trial|State of Tennessee v. Scopes]]'' trial. It has often been called the "Scopes Monkey Trial," a title popularized by author and journalist [[H.L. Mencken]]. The trial, which was deliberately staged to bring publicity to the issue at hand, pitted Darrow against [[William Jennings Bryan]] in a court case that tested Tennessee's [[Butler Act]], which had been passed on March 21, 1925. The act forbade the teaching of "the [[evolution|Evolution Theory]]" in any state-funded educational establishment. More broadly, it outlawed in state-funded schools (including universities) the teaching of "any theory that denies the story of the [[creationism|Divine Creation]] of man as taught in the [[Bible]], and to teach instead that man has descended from a lower order of animals."

During the trial, Darrow requested that Bryan be called to the stand as an expert witness on the [[Bible]]. Over the other prosecutor's objection, Bryan agreed. Popular media{{cn|date=August 2018}} at the time portrayed the following exchange as the deciding factor that turned public opinion against Bryan in the trial:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Darrow: "You have given considerable study to the Bible, haven't you, Mr. Bryan?"
:Bryan: "Yes, sir; I have tried to.... But, of course, I have studied it more as I have become older than when I was a boy."
:Darrow: "Do you claim then that everything in the Bible should be literally interpreted?"
:Bryan: "I believe that everything in the Bible should be accepted as it is given there; some of the Bible is given illustratively. For instance: 'Ye are the salt of the earth.' I would not insist that man was actually salt, or that he had flesh of salt, but it is used in the sense of salt as saving God's people."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!--  Commented out: [[Image:scopes trial.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Clarence Darrow and [[William Jennings Bryan]] chat in court during the [[Scopes Trial]].{{Deletable image-caption|date=March 2012}}]] --&gt;
After about two hours, Judge [[John T. Raulston]] cut the questioning short and on the following morning ordered that the whole session (which in any case the jury had not witnessed) be expunged from the record, ruling that the testimony had no bearing on whether Scopes was guilty of teaching evolution. Scopes was found guilty and ordered to pay the minimum fine of $100.

A year later, the [[Tennessee Supreme Court]] reversed the decision of the Dayton court on a procedural technicality—not on constitutional grounds, as Darrow had hoped. According to the court, the fine should have been set by the jury, not Raulston. Rather than send the case back for further action, however, the Tennessee Supreme Court dismissed the case. The court commented, "Nothing is to be gained by prolonging the life of this bizarre case."

The event led to a change in public sentiment and an increased discourse on the creation claims of religious teachers versus those of secular scientists {{mdash}} i.e., [[creationism]] compared to [[evolutionism]] {{mdash}} that still exist. It also became popularized in a play based loosely on the trial, ''[[Inherit the Wind (play)|Inherit the Wind]]'', which has been adapted several times on film and television.

====Ossian Sweet====
On September 9, 1925, a [[white people|white]] mob in Detroit attempted to drive a black family out of the home they had purchased in a white neighborhood. During the struggle, a white man was killed, and the eleven black men in the house were later arrested and charged with murder. [[Ossian Sweet]], a doctor, and three members of his family were brought to trial, and after an initial deadlock, Darrow argued to the [[all-white jury]]: "I insist that there is nothing but prejudice in this case; that if it was reversed and eleven white men had shot and killed a black man while protecting their home and their lives against a mob of blacks, nobody would have dreamed of having them indicted. They would have been given medals instead...." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=B. J.|first=Widick|title=Detroit: City of Race and Class Violence |edition=Revised|date=May 1, 1989|publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]]|location=Detroit, MI|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a mistrial, it was agreed that each of the eleven defendants would be tried individually. Darrow, alongside Thomas Chawke, would first defend Ossian's brother Henry, who had confessed to firing the shot on Garland Street. Henry was found not guilty on grounds of [[Right of self-defense|self-defense]], and the prosecution determined to [[nolle prosequi|drop]] the charges on the remaining ten. The trials were presided over by [[Frank Murphy]], who went on to become [[Governor of Michigan]] and an [[Associate Justice]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;*[[Kevin Boyle (historian)|Boyle, Kevin]], ''[[Arc of Justice]]: A Saga of Race, Civil Rights and Murder in the Jazz Age'' (Henry Holt &amp; Company, New York: 2004) ([[National Book Award]] Winner) {{ISBN|978-0-8050-7933-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Darrow's closing statement, which lasted over seven hours, is seen as a landmark in the [[Civil Rights]] movement and was included in the book ''Speeches that Changed the World'' (given the name "I Believe in the Law of Love"). The two closing arguments of Clarence Darrow, from the first and second trials, show how he learned from the first trial and reshaped his remarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/sweet/Summpage.html |title=Darrow's Summations in the Sweet Trials (1925 &amp;1926) |publisher=Law.umkc.edu |date=May 11, 1926 |accessdate=October 20, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624025813/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/FTrials/sweet/Summpage.html |archive-date=June 24, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Massie Trial====
The Scopes Trial and the Sweet trial were the last big cases that Darrow took on before he retired from full-time practice at the age of 68. He still took on a few cases such as the 1932 [[Massie Trial]] in Hawaii.

In his last headline-making case, the Massie Trial, Darrow, devastated by the [[Great Depression]], was hired by Eva Stotesbury, the wife of Darrow's old family friend [[Edward T. Stotesbury]], to come to the defense of [[Grace Fortescue]], [[Edward J. Lord]], Deacon Jones, and Thomas Massie, Fortescue's son-in-law, who were accused of murdering [[Joseph Kahahawai]]. Kahahawai had been accused, along with four other men, of raping and beating [[Thalia Massie]], Thomas's wife and Fortescue's daughter; the resulting 1931 case ended in a hung jury (though the charges were later dropped and repeated investigation has shown them to be innocent). Enraged, Fortescue and Massie then orchestrated the murder of Kahahawai in order to extract a confession and were caught by police officers while transporting his dead body.

Darrow entered the racially charged atmosphere as the lawyer for the defendants. Darrow reconstructed the case as a justified [[honor killing]] by Thomas Massie. Considered by ''[[The New York Times]]'' to be one of Darrow's three most compelling trials (along with the Scopes Trial and the Leopold and Loeb case), the case captivated the nation and most of white America strongly supported the honor killing defense. In fact, the final defense arguments were transmitted to the mainland through a special radio hookup. In the end, the jury came back with a unanimous verdict of guilty, but on the lesser crime of manslaughter.&lt;ref&gt;David Stannard.[http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2001/Oct/14/op/op03a.html "The Massie case: Injustice and courage"]. ''The Honolulu Advertiser'', October 14, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; As to Darrow's closing, one juror commented, "[h]e talked to us like a bunch of farmers. That stuff may go over big in the Middle West, but not here."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Stannard | first = David E. | authorlink = David Stannard | title = Honor Killing: Race, Rape, and Clarence Darrow's Spectacular Last Case | origyear = First published 2005 | year = 2006 | publisher = Penguin Group | isbn = 978-0-14-303663-0 | page = 382}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governor [[Lawrence Judd]] later commuted the sentences to one hour in his office.&lt;ref&gt;Page 86 {{cite web |url=http://darrow.law.umn.edu/Clarence_Darrow_Timeline.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 3, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008005846/http://darrow.law.umn.edu/Clarence_Darrow_Timeline.pdf |archivedate=October 8, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Years later Deacon admitted to shooting Kahahawai; Massie was found "not Guilty" in a [[posthumous trial]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==Religious beliefs==
==="Why I Am An Agnostic"===
As part of a public symposium on belief held in Columbus, Ohio, Darrow delivered a speech, later titled "Why I Am An Agnostic", on [[agnosticism]], skepticism, belief, and religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Essential Words and Writings of Clarence Darrow | year = 2007 | publisher = [[Modern Library]] | isbn = 978-0812966770 | page = 20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the speech, Darrow thoroughly discussed the meaning of being an agnostic and questioned the doctrines of [[Christianity]] and the [[Bible]]. He concluded that "the fear of God is not the beginning of wisdom. The fear of God is the death of wisdom. Skepticism and doubt lead to study and investigation, and investigation is the beginning of wisdom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://darrow.law.umn.edu/documents/why_I_am_an_agnostic.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 15, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160221235533/http://darrow.law.umn.edu/documents/why_I_am_an_agnostic.pdf |archivedate=February 21, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mecca Temple Debate===
In January 1931 Darrow had a debate with English writer [[G. K. Chesterton]] during the latter's second trip to America. This was held at New York City's Mecca Temple. The topic was "Will the World Return to Religion?". At the end of the debate those in the hall were asked to vote for the man they thought had won the debate. Darrow received 1,022 votes while Chesterton received 2,359 votes. There is no known transcript of what was said except for third party accounts published later on.

===Position on eugenics===
In the edition of November 18, 1915 of ''The Washington Post'', Darrow stated: “Chloroform unfit children. Show them the same mercy that is shown beasts that are no longer fit to live.”  However, Darrow was also critical of some [[eugenics]] advocates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bradburyac.mistral.co.uk/tennes14.html |title=The Scopes Trial - Clarence Darrow Myths |publisher= Bradburyac.mistral.co.uk |date=December 6, 1999 |accessdate=October 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://www.andrewekersten.com.vhost.zerolag.com/2011/05/27/darrow-versus-the-eugenicists/ |title=Darrow versus the Eugenicists |publisher=andrewekersten.com.vhost.zerolag.com |date=May 27, 2011 |accessdate=October 20, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130805055724/http://www.andrewekersten.com.vhost.zerolag.com/2011/05/27/darrow-versus-the-eugenicists/ |archivedate=August 5, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Darrow died on March 13, 1938, of pulmonary heart disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0418.html|title=Clarence Darrow Is Dead in Chicago|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 14, 1938|accessdate=July 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Today, Clarence Darrow is remembered for his reputation as a fierce litigator who, in many cases, championed the cause of the underdog; because of this, he is generally regarded as one of the greatest criminal defense lawyers in American history.

According to legend, before he died, Darrow declared that if there was an [[afterlife]], he would return on the small bridge (now known as the Clarence Darrow Memorial Bridge) located just south of the [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science and Industry]] in [[Hyde Park, Chicago]] on the date of his death. Darrow was skeptical of a belief in life after death (he is reported to have said: "Every man knows when his life began... If I did not exist in the past, why should I, or could I, exist in the future?") but he made this promise to dissuade [[mediums]] from charging people money to "talk" to his spirit. People still gather on the bridge in the hopes of seeing his ghost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kogan|first1=Rick|title=Clarence Darrow's Words, if Not His Ghost, Still Linger in Jackson Park|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/ct-clarence-darrow-bridge-chicago-ae-0306-20160303-column.html|accessdate=November 16, 2016|date=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plays===
* ''[[Clarence Darrow (film)|Darrow]]'', a full-length one-man play created after his death, featuring Darrow's reminiscences about his career. Originated by [[Henry Fonda]], many actors (including [[Leslie Nielsen]] and [[David Canary]]) have since taken on the role of Darrow in this play, which was adapted as ''[[Darrow (film)|Darrow]]'', a film starring [[Kevin Spacey]] and released by American Playhouse in 1991.
* ''[[Inherit the Wind (play)|Inherit the Wind]]'', a play (later adapted to the screen) which is a broadly fictionalized account of the [[Scopes Trial]]. Though the authors note that the 1925 trial was "clearly the genesis" of their play, they insist that the characters had "life and language of their own." They also mention that the issues raised in the play "have acquired new dimension and meaning", a possible reference to the political controversies of the 1950s. Still, they finish their foreword by inviting a more universal reading of the play:  "It might have been yesterday. It could be tomorrow."&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee. ''Inherit the Wind''. Bantam, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spencer Tracy]] played the Darrow character ("Henry Drummond") in the film, and Jason Robards too in a TV's remake in 1988.

=== CVT Ventures, LLC ===
CVT Ventures, LLC, is a Delaware corporation based in San Diego, California. [[Jack Rivkin]], chief investment officer at Neuberger Berman and former head of CitiGroup’s Technology Venture Group personally financed CVT. Boro, with former Infogate management executives Vidar Vignisson and Thomas Broadhead, formed CVT Ventures in 2003.&lt;ref name=CB2 /&gt;

A venture capital and start-up development group, CVT provided seed, early and mid-stage/expansion funding, supporting services and advice to emerging companies, such as VideoEgg (later [[Say Media]]), [[Luxology]], which later merged with the [[Foundry]], a UK-based company and mSnap, (acquired by Marketron).&lt;ref name=DMN&gt;{{cite web|title=Luxology announces new board members|url=http://creativemac.digitalmedianet.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=27236&amp;afterinter=true|publisher=Creative Mac|accessdate=Feb 1, 2013|date=Aug 5, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MAR&gt;{{cite web|title=Marketron acquires mSnap|url=http://www.marketron.com/news-092910.php|publisher=Marketron|accessdate=Feb 4, 2013|date=Sep 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PRI&gt;{{cite web|title=CVT Ventures|url=http://www.privco.com/investores/venture-capital/cvt-ventures|publisher=Privo.com|accessdate=Feb 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through CVT, Boro became a member of their executive or advisory boards.&lt;ref name=BBW /&gt;&lt;ref name=DMN /&gt;&lt;ref name=MAS&gt;{{cite web|last=Hopkinis|first=Mark|title=Cliff Boro's KidZui gets funded|url=http://mashable.com/2008/02/21/kidzui/|publisher=Mashable|accessdate=Feb 1, 2013|date=Feb 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JUG&gt;{{cite web|title=VideoEgg profile|url=http://www.juggle.com/videoegg|publisher=Juggle.com|accessdate=Feb 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luxology’s board chairman, [[Howard L.

KidZui's Mozilla add-on now gives us the opportunity to connect with Mozilla's active community, giving them access to a safe social browser with just one click."&lt;ref name=K&amp;M /&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN /&gt;

KidZui also launched a YouTube-style website, ZuiTube that features ZuiStars such as [[MattyBRaps|MattyB]] in an age-appropriate setting.&lt;ref name=CNN /&gt; In an interview with CNN Boro said, "The goal is to be both educational and entertaining, so KidZui has mapped out 8,600 channels of what kids are interested in, ranging from photosynthesis to Miley Cyrus. We relate all of those categories to each other so kids can independently and safely browse, search and share."&lt;ref name=CNN /&gt;

In 2011, KidZui became Zui.com, Inc. Saban Brands acquired the company in September 2012.&lt;ref name=XCON /&gt;  Zui.com won Nappa Gold Winner (2008), the Children’s Technology Review Editor’s Choice Award (2009), the Parents Choice Award (2009), and the Wired Safety Best of the Web Award (2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2009 Tweenangels Summit|url=http://tweenangels.org/events/summit/2009/09_pr.html|accessdate=Feb 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Team Group, LLC===
Boro and Broadhead cofounded The Team Group, LLC in October 2012. Boro is the managing partner of the San Diego-based firm, which has two divisions, Team Services and Team Ventures. Team Group personnel work closely with their clients to provide expert services and smaller scale financing. In addition, Team Group helps clients develop business strategies and raise additional capital. Instead of taking venture capital fees, all partners receive a salary from the services portion of the business.&lt;ref name="Bigelow"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bigelow|first=Bruce V.|title=Zui Founders Unveil Team Group, Offering Startup Services and Funding|url=http://www.exconomy.com/san-diego/2013/08/14/zui-founders-unveil-team-group-offering-startup-services-and-funding|work=Xconomy|accessdate=Oct 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Team Services provides a financial and administrative services platform. The division manages personnel, accounting, finance and cash management tasks for nascent start-ups—web entrepreneurs that already have between $500,000 and $750,000 in seed or Series A funding and bootstrap entrepreneurs who have developed their enterprises into a cash flow position. The principle behind the services group allows young companies access to necessary administrative services without the burden of premature and ongoing payroll expense. Team Group’s services revenues help provide funds for the firm’s investment branch.&lt;ref name="Bigelow"/&gt;

Team Ventures makes small, early stage investments, usually about $100,000, in emerging companies and provides advisory and support services for start-up founders. Jack Rivkin, a Wall Street investor and former head of CitiGroup’s Technology Venture Group, is one of several investors backing the firm’s venture capital division.&lt;ref name="Bigelow"/&gt;

==Affiliations==
Boro is actively involved in a number of entrepreneur-support efforts, including forums and events. Boro is a mentor with the [[Founder Institute]], an entrepreneurial education organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Founder Institute|url=http://fi.co/mentors?target=Los+Angeles|publisher=fi.co|accessdate=Jan 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through CVT Ventures, LLC, Boro is a former Luxology advisory board member and former board chairman at mSnap and VideoEgg (joining First Round Capital’s Howard Morgan, Dr. Adam Klein, former vice president and president of global marketing at Hasbro, Inc., and Stephen Mack, founder and president of Gnomist, Inc.).&lt;ref name=DMN /&gt;&lt;ref name=JUG /&gt;&lt;ref name=BBW3/&gt;

==Awards and recognition==
In 2011, the Obama administration named Boro a 2011 Champion of Change for his innovative work in meeting technological challenges in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenberg|first=Simon|title=NDN welcomes 23 Champions of Change from southwest border region|url=http://ndn.org/blog/2011/09/ndn-welcomes-23-champions-change-us-mexico-border-region|publisher=NDN.org|accessdate=Feb 2, 2013|date=Sep 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Champions of Change|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2012/02/13/empowering-children-explore-internet-safely|publisher=The White House|accessdate=Feb 2, 2013|date=Feb 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, the U.S. Patent Office granted a patent to Boro and Broadhead for their unique methods and systems for facilitating electronic commerce using a child-oriented computer network application. Boro, with Broadhead and others, also holds patents on child-oriented computing systems, child-oriented computer network applications, advertising and user feedback methods and systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Child-oriented computing facilities, United States Patent Application 20060242306-A1.|url=http://patent.ipexl.com/U2S/20060242306ZZDASHZZA1.html|publisher=Ipexl.com|accessdate=Oct 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Methods and systems for facilitating electronic commerce using a child-oriented computer network application|url=http://patents.justia.com/inventor/thomas-c-broadhead and http://patents.justia.com/inventor/clifford-t-boro|publisher=Justia.com|accessdate=Oct 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Abstract: A child-oriented browsing system|url=http://www.patentbudy.com/inventor/Boro-Cifford-T/7239468|publisher=PatentBuddy.com|accessdate=Oct 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1994">'''Cyberquery''' is a software product of [[Cyberscience Corporation]] Inc. Originally developed for data handling and analysis on [[Data General]] AOS and AOS/VS minicomputers, then the available platforms for '''Cyberquery''' were extended to all major [[UNIX]] platforms, [[VAX/VMS]], [[Digital Equipment Corporation]], [[personal computers]] and Microsoft Windows. 

==Description of Cyberquery==

Invented in 1980, Cyberquery is a declarative "4GL" [[fourth-generation programming language]]. Its early design was slightly influenced by RAMIS and other data access and analysis languages such as the query language on GE time sharing systems. Cyberquery automates the process of accessing files or tables and reading records or rows. This basic operation allows the user/developer to concentrate on the details of working with the data within each record, in effect working almost entirely within an implicit [[program loop]] that runs for each record. Compared to [[general-purpose programming language]]s, this automation allows the user/developer to ignore the technical details of the data and how it is stored, and concentrate on the information contained in the data.

Cyberquery has a data dictionary to describe the datasets users wish to access. This removes all the physical details of the file structure from each program and from the user/developer. The original target customers for Cyberquery were personnel departments, so ease of use by non computer specialists was an early design goal. This architecture had the advantage that Cyberquery is portable, reports written for one database run unmodified on any other provided the underlying data is logically similar. Differences are hidden in the data dictionary. Cyberquery is now widely deployed in Industries including Manufacturing, Finance, Medical and Retail.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2423">'''DIN EN ISO 9712''':2012 is a certification issued by the German institute for standardization ([[Deutsches Institut für Normung]]). It certifies personnel working in [[Non-destructive testing]]. This standard evaluates and documents the competence of personnel whose tasks require knowledge of non-destructive tests. The certification process is performed by authorized independent certification bodies, such as Sector Cert, [[DQS]], [[TÜV]], [[DEKRA]] etc. They can be applied at the German accreditation body (Deutsche Akkreditierungsstelle GmbH, DAkkS).

== Certification process ==
To be accepted for the certification exam, applicants have to:

* visit a course 
* provide a proof of good eyesight
* fulfill the required practical experience in non-destructive testing

After the exam has been successfully passed and the full industry experience can be proved, the [[Professional certification|certificate]] itself can be applied for. The [[certification]] stays valid for five years and has to be renewed. While this only includes a new application form, recertification after ten years consists of a further examination.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsche Gesellschaft für zerstörungsfreie Prüfung e.V., advices for certification: [http://www.dgzfp.de/Zertifizierung/Hinweise.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Replacement of DIN EN 473 and DIN EN ISO 9712 ==
DIN EN ISO 9712:2012 was introduced in January 2013. DIN EN 473, as well as the former version of DIN EN ISO 9712 (DIN EN ISO 9712:2005), were replaced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tuv.com/media/corporate/industrial_service/Replacement_of_EN_473_by_ISO_9712_TUV_Rheinland.pdf Replacement of EN 473 by EN ISO 9712]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite many similarities, the new version of DIN EN ISO 9712 contains numerous alterations:

:For example, the updated standard consists of new testing methods, such as [[infrared thermography]] or testing with [[strain gauge]]s.
:The required practical experience in [[non-destructive testing]] before certification has also been introduced with the new ISO 9712. 
:Furthermore, written electronic tests can be taken online now.&lt;ref&gt;[http://standardsforum.com/new-iso-9712-2012-edition-non-destructive-testing-qualification-and-certification-of-ndt-personnel/ Changes by the new version of DIN EN ISO 9712]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Datu Puti''' is a [[condiment]] brand owned by [[Nutri-Asia|Nutri-Asia, Inc.]] (formerly known as Southeast Asia Foods, Inc.). Datu Puti was first introduced as a [[vinegar]] product in 1975 by Hernan Reyes. Eventually, [[soy sauce]] and [[fish sauce]] under the Datu Puti brand were introduced in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=sino&gt;{{cite news|title=Sino ba si Datu Puti?|url=https://sg.news.yahoo.com/blogs/timpla/sino-ba-si-datu-puti-084729532.html|accessdate=30 November 2016|work=Yahoo! Special Projects|publisher=Yahoo!|date=21 July 2011|trans-title=Who's Datu Puti?}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[oyster sauce]] product was also introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nutri-Asia puts premium on food safety and quality|url=http://www.philstar.com/agriculture/2014/03/16/1301274/nutri-asia-puts-premium-food-safety-and-quality|accessdate=30 November 2016|publisher=The Philippine Star|date=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Branding ==
Datu Puti is a combination of the surname of Reyes' mother (Dátu), and the [[Filipino language|Filipino]] [[translation]] of the color [[white]] ("puti"), which is a primary color of the traditional palm or ''sukang paombong''. The logo used for the brand features the image of a [[datu]].&lt;ref name="sino"/&gt;

The ''Mukhasim'' (a portmanteau of Filipino words ''mukha''; {{literal translation|face}}, and ''asim''; {{literal translation|sour}}) marketing campaign was instrumental to the brand's recognition. The campaign was launched in the early 1980s which featured the comedian Conrado "Pugak" Piring, making a facial expression of having consumed something sour, dubbed as the "mukhasim" face.&lt;ref name=sino/&gt;

==Market share==
In August 2011, it was reported the Datu Puti is the Philippine market leader in vinegar. In the same report, the brand also leads in [[Luzon]] when it comes to soy sauce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Aquino|first1=Tricia|title=Can the world fall in love with Datu Puti and Mang Tomas?

'''David Gamkrelidze''' or '''Davit Gamqrelidze''' ({{lang-ka|დავით გამყრელიძე}}) (born April 2, 1964 in [[Tbilisi]]), is a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] [[politician]], leader of the [[New Right (Georgia)|New Rights Party of Georgia]], [[Parliament of Georgia|Member of Parliament]] since 1999, member of committee for defense and security, Chairman of the [[Centre-Right]] [[Rightist Opposition|Opposition]] Group in the [[Parliament of Georgia]]. He also contested the [[Georgian presidential election, 2008|2008 Georgian presidential election]] and came fourth with the 4.02% of the votes cast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cec.gov.ge/index.php?lang_id=GEO&amp;sec_id=33&amp;info_id=4051 cec.gov.ge] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929155654/http://www.cec.gov.ge/index.php?lang_id=GEO&amp;sec_id=33&amp;info_id=4051 |date=2011-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==

David Gamkrelidze was born on April 2, 1964 in a family of [[Geologist]], [[Academician]] of [[Georgia’s Academy of Sciences]] and one of the most distinguished representatives of Georgian geological school Erekle Gamkrelidze and of Ia Gobronidze. His grandfather, Academician Petre Gamkrelidze was one of the founders of Georgian geological school.

David Gamkrelidze graduated from the Tbilisi 55th secondary school. In 1982 he became student of [[Tbilisi State Medical University]], Faculty of Pediatrics. He was a distinguished student, holder of Tarkhnishvili Scholarship, member of the Student’s Medical Council. He was a frequent participant of various students’ international conferences and Olympiads.

Since 1988 the “National movement” gained significant momentum among the majority of Georgian citizens; especially among the youth. The Georgian citizens began to demand independence and the country unraveled in massive protest demonstrations. In this hectic time, David Gamkrelidze, along with his friends, established the Christian-Democratic Association, which later was renamed into the Christian-Democratic Union.

David Gamkrelidze took active part in the March–April 1989 protest demonstrations against the [[Soviet Army]].

Right after the tragic events of April 9, 1989 several organizations were established, the Rustaveli Society among them, of which David Gamkrelidze was a member.

In the spring of 1989, with the purpose of coordinating the National Liberation Movement, the National Forum was established. The participants of the forum were Gia Chanturia, Zviad Gamsakhurdia, Irakli Batiashvili and others. The Christian-Democratic Union was represented at the Forum by David Gamkrelidze and Irakli Kakabadze. In June of the same year, the first delegation of the National Liberation Movement traveled to Paris to celebrate the Independence Day of Georgia at the invitation from the Georgian Diaspora living there. David Gamkrelidze was a member of the delegation as well.

==Entrepreneurship==

After the collapse of the [[Communist]] regime in 1990 and Georgia’s eventual re-gaining of independence, David Gamkrelidze concluded he had exhausted his function in the National Liberation Movement and moved to entrepreneurial activities. Along with his friends, he established the first ever insurance company in Georgia, the Aldagi. Very soon, Aldagi became the flagman of the insurance industry in Georgia. In 1999, David Gamkrelidze, as the President of Aldagi, was named among the ten most successful businessmen of Georgia.

==Political activity==

In 1998 he was elected member of the [[Tbilisi City Assembly]], local governing authority of the capital of Georgia.

For the then ruling party (Citizens’ Union of Georgia), in order to win the general elections badly needed a certain number of successful people in its electoral party list. David Gamkrelidze, who did not hold the membership of this party, agreed to take part in the elections along with other businessmen .

On October 31, 1999 David Gamkrelidze became member of the Parliament of Georgia. At the first session sitting, he got elected as chairman of the Healthcare and Social Issues Committee. Gradually, David Gamkrelidze and his friends realized that the ruling party did not actually care for their professionalism and commitment to the matters of national importance. The period of disenchantment began, which reached its peak in the spring of 2000. That was right after the ruling party presented to the Parliament the budget for ratification in 1999 and demanded from the majority of the party to endorse it.

David Gamkrelidze and Levan Gachechiladze resigned in sign of protest and called for creation of a committee that would investigate the budget deficit of 1999.

On May 17, 2000 a special commission was formed with David Gamkrelidze at the chairmanship to investigate the budget deficit of 1999. In six months, David Gamkrelidze presented to the Parliament a conclusion and said the whole truth as to what the reason for the 1999 drastic budget deficit in actuality was.

On September 8, 2000 with the purpose to overcome the critical situation prevalent in the country and in order to raise public awareness in this regard, 35 professionals established a public organization – the “New Movement”. David Gamkrelidze was one of its founders and an active member.
On September 17, 2000 the “New Faction” Group was formed in the Parliament. David Gamkrelidze was elected chairman of the group.
The “New Faction”, despite of its smallness, significantly changed the situation in the Parliament. It truly said a totally different and new word in Georgia’s politics.

==New Rights party==
On June 15, 2001 on the basis of the “New Faction”, New Movement and Georgian Neo-Conservative Party, a political party was created. The party was called the New Rights of Georgia. The founding congress elected David Gamkrelidze as its co-chairman.

In a year since its founding, the New Rights reached very high results for a party which was only a year’s old. On June 2, 2002 the New Rights won the first place in the local elections all across Georgia, and the third place on Tbilisi level. David Gamkrelidze contributed significantly to the success of the party. He personally headed the party’s election campaign. After winning the local elections, the party began to prepare for the upcoming parliamentary elections.

In September, 2002 David Gamkrelidze and his colleagues submitted to the Parliament of Georgia a decree regarding Georgia’s accession to NATO as a foreign policy priority, declaration was unanimously adopted. This was the first open statement about Georgia’s willingness to join NATO.

On June 27, 2003 at the Party 2nd Congress David Gamkrelidze was unanimously elected as chairman and leader.

The results of the parliamentary elections of November 2, 2003, in which the New Rights overcame the 7-percent threshold, were abolished. New general elections were called. There was very little time left before the March 28, 2004 elections. The revolutionary sentiments were gaining momentum. Therefore, everyone inside and outside of the country was sure that none of the opposition parties would be able to succeed. From the so-called non-revolutionary parties, only the New Rights were able to overcome the 7-percent barrier. They made a coalition with another party of centre-right orientation, the Industrials and consequently successfully overcame the 7-percent threshold. David Gamkrelidze was in charge of the Industrial’s and New Right’s election campaign on March 28, 2004 as well.

In April, 2004 David Gamkrelidze became member of the Parliament second time.

Currently, he is heading the Right Opposition Group; he is also member of the Defence and Security Committee as well as member of the Delegation to NATO Parliamentary Assembly. His opinion, as one of the most successful opposition leaders, is widely taken into account in the Western political circles.

On June 3, 2006 David Gamkrelidze was re-elected as the New Rights Party chairman at the 3rd Party Congress.

==January 2008 presidential elections==
On November 24, 2007 on the 4th Extraordinary Congress of the New Rights Party David Gamkrelidze was nominated as a candidate for early Presidential elections to be held on January 5, 2008. His candidature officially supported by four political parties (New Rights Party, Industrialists, National Democrats and Christian Democrats). He advocates the establishment of a constitutional monarchy through a referendum (''see also [[Monarchism in Georgia]]'').

==Family==
David Gamkrelidze has a wife, Marina Madichi and two children – Erekle and Nino.

He speaks Georgian, Russian and English.

'''Dilson Domingos Funaro''' (October 23, 1933 — April 12, 1989) was a [[Brazil]]ian businessman and politician, owner of the toy company ''Indústria de Brinquedos Trol''. He was also president of the [[Brazilian Development Bank]] and later [[Ministry of Finance (Brazil)|Finance Minister of Brazil]] during the term of President [[José Sarney]], from August 1985 to April 1987. During his tenure as Finance Minister he was responsible for the creation of a plan for the stabilization of Brazil's monetary policy, the ''[[Plano Cruzado]]''. He also was responsible for the unilateral suspension of payments on the Brazilian Republic's [[external debt]] to foreign financial institutions, which was implemented on February 20, 1987. With Brazil's financial crisis continuing with seemingly no solution on the horizon, Funaro was asked to resign from his post just a few months later.

==Personal life==
Funaro was the son of Paschoal Funaro and Helena Kraljevic, and grandson of Domingos Funaro (a native of [[Catanzaro]], [[Calabria]], [[Italy]]). Coming from a wealthy family, he studied engineering at [[Mackenzie Presbyterian University]], and while still at a young age joined CIBRAPE, an industrial concern specialized in plastics. Not long after he acquired ''Monitora'' and later ''[[Trol]]'', a major manufacturer of plastics for industry, domestic use, and toys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adrianobranco.eng.br/2009/07/29/recordando-dilson-funaro/|title=RECORDANDO DILSON FUNARO  @  Eng. Adriano Murgel Branco|website=Adrianobranco.eng.br|accessdate=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1982, Funaro discovered that he was suffering from [[lymphatic cancer]],&lt;ref name="abril.com.br"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://veja.abril.com.br/arquivo_veja/capa_15011986.shtml# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-11-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926003655/http://veja.abril.com.br/arquivo_veja/capa_15011986.shtml# |archive-date=2011-09-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that it was a particularly serious form of the disease. Despite receiving treatment, he suffered a number of relapses that eventually led to his death in 1989.
 
He was married to and survived by [[Ana Maria Matarazzo Suplicy]] (daughter of Paul Cochrane Suplicy and Filomena Matarazzo, and sister of noted politician [[Eduardo Matarazzo Suplicy]]), with whom he had six children.

==Plano Cruzado==
After serving in a number of posts in both industry and government over two-and-a-half decades, Funaro was appointed head of the [[Brazilian Development Bank]] in March 1985 at the request of President Sarney. That August, Sarney promoted him to head the Finance Ministry, the first minister that the president personally appointed after inheriting his cabinet from deceased President-elect [[Tancredo Neves]]. Funaro was quickly recognized as the most powerful member of Sarney's government in the first months of his tenure,&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/02/business/economics-czar-dilson-funaro-battling-brazil-s-inflationary-fires.html|title=Economics Czar: Dilson Funaro; Battling Brazil's Inflationary Fires|first=Alan|last=Riding|date=2 March 1986|publisher=|accessdate=1 January 2018|website=Nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and used his wide-ranging power to tackle Brazil's explosive monetary inflation problem. These reforms were packaged as the Plano Cruzado, after the [[Cruzado|new currency]] that was introduced as the centerpiece of the initiative. It also included a freeze on wages and prices and an end to the system of automatic price increases known as indexing.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/14/obituaries/dilson-funaro-55-brazil-aide.html|title=Dilson Funaro, 55, Brazil Aide|first=Glenn|last=Fowler|date=14 April 1989|publisher=|accessdate=1 January 2018|website=Nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the plan proved unable to stem inflation, Funaro switched tactics and created what was dubbed "Plano Cruzado II" which undid many of the previous reforms as well as raised taxes to curb the public demand for goods that had been generated by the revoking of indexing. This turnabout made the minister increasingly unpopular among the common citizens as well as politicians from rival parties. When Funaro became convinced that Brazil's debt to foreign banks was making it impossible to generate economic growth, he convinced the Government to suspend interest payments on $67 billion worth of loans on February 20, 1987. This created panic in the international banking community, especially in the [[United States]], over concerns that Brazil would be able to repay any of its loans.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

By April 1987, Funaro's position became untenable and he resigned on the 29th. He was unable to recover politically from this setback before his death just two years later.

'''Electric Transit, Inc.''' (ETI) was a [[joint venture]] between the [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] group in the [[Czech Republic]] and [[AAI Corporation]] in the United States which made [[trolleybus]]es for the [[Trolleybuses in Dayton|Dayton]] and [[Trolleybuses in San Francisco|San Francisco trolleybus systems]], constructing a total of 330 trolleybuses. ETI was formed in 1994, and ownership was divided as 65% by [[Škoda Works|Škoda]] and 35% by [[AAI Corporation|AAI]]. The latter was a wholly owned subsidiary of United Industrial Corporation. Up to that time, Škoda had built more than 12,000 trolleybuses since 1935,&lt;ref name="wilkins"&gt;Wilkins, Van. "New Electric Trolley Buses in Dayton", in ''Bus World'' (ISSN 0162-9689). Summer 1996, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; but none for cities outside Europe and Asia.

==History and production==
[[File:Dayton ETI trolleybus 9601.jpg|thumb|left|170px|ETI's first trolleybus was Dayton 9601, model 14TrE.]]
[[Image:SanFran 14TrSF trolleybus 5592.jpg|thumb|right|170px|An ETI 14TrSF trolleybus descending a hill in San Francisco]]

The company was awarded its first contract in November 1994, when the [[Greater Dayton Regional Transit Authority|Miami Valley Regional Transit Authority]], of [[Dayton, Ohio]] placed an order for 63 two-axle trolleybuses.&lt;ref&gt;[[Greater Dayton Regional Transit Authority|Miami Valley Regional Transit Authority (now GDRTA)]] (Nov. 1, 1994). “RTA Awards Official Contract for 63 New Electric Trolleybuses.” ''[[Press release]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The order was later reduced to 61 vehicles,&lt;ref name= TM206&gt;''Trolleybus Magazine (TM)'' No. 206, March–April 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; and ultimately to 57.&lt;ref name= TM207&gt;''TM'' No. 207, May–June 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Three [[prototype]] trolleybuses were delivered in December 1995 and January 1996.&lt;ref name=TM206/&gt; These were designated by ETI as model 14TrE, the E standing for "export", and were given fleet numbers 9601–9603 by MVRTA.&lt;ref name=TM207/&gt; Following modifications to the design, construction of the 54 production-series ETI trolleybuses for Dayton took place in 1998–99. These were model 14TrE2 and were numbered 9801–9854 in MVRTA's fleet. Among the modifications were the moving of the [[wheelchair lift]] from the rear door to the front door, which necessitated widening the body from {{convert|98|in|mm|abbr=on}} to {{convert|102|in|mm|abbr=on}} and changing from a one-piece windshield to a two-piece one.&lt;ref name="wilkins"/&gt;

In July 1997, the [[San Francisco Municipal Railway]] (Muni) contracted with ETI for the provision of 250 trolleybuses, comprising 220 [[Rigid bus|standard/two-axle]] ({{convert|40|ft|m|abbr=on}}) and 30 [[Articulated bus|articulated]] ({{convert|60|ft|m|abbr=on}}) vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;Finnie, Chuck (June 1, 1999). “Muni trolley firm in crisis”, ''San Francisco Examiner'', p. A-1.&lt;/ref&gt; ETI designated the two types for San Francisco as models 14TrSF and 15TrSF, respectively. In February 2000, Muni exercised contract options to purchase an additional 20 two-axle and three articulated vehicles. Two prototypes for the two-axle trolleybuses (numbered 5401–5402) were received by Muni in January 1999 and June 1999, respectively, while an articulated prototype (No. 7101) was received in April 2000. The 238 production-series two-axle trolleybuses (Nos. 5403–5640) were delivered between May 2001 and early 2004. The production-series articulateds (7102–7133) were all delivered in 2003. All 273 of Muni's ETI trolleybuses had entered service by April 2004.&lt;ref&gt;''TM'' No. 256, July–August 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

With both the Dayton and San Francisco orders, the chassis/body-frame (or shell) and motors of each vehicle were fabricated at Škoda's plant in [[Ostrov (Karlovy Vary District)|Ostrov nad Ohří]], [[Czech Republic]], then shipped to a facility in [[Hunt Valley, Maryland]] (near other [[AAI Corporation|AAI]] facilities) for initial fitting-out.&lt;ref name="frames"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bus frames have arrived|newspaper=[[Dayton Business Journal]]|date=March 25, 1997|url= http://dayton.bizjournals.com/dayton/stories/1997/03/24/daily7.html|accessdate=2015-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Trolley Buses: Procurement Program Highlights|publisher=[[San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency|San Francisco MTA]]|url=http://www.sfmta.com/cms/mfleet/trolley.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218092119/http://www.sfmta.com/cms/mfleet/trolley.htm |archivedate=December 18, 2011 |accessdate=2015-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Except in the case of the prototypes, final fitting-out was undertaken in leased premises located in the two cities purchasing the vehicles, Dayton and San Francisco.

ETI originally was based in Dayton,&lt;ref name="frames"/&gt; but after completion of the contract for that city, the Dayton office was closed and ETI moved its administrative office to Hunt Valley, sharing space with partner AAI there.

[[File:SF Muni ETI 15TrSF 7108.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An ETI 15TrSF in San Francisco]]
In 2003, ETI engaged in a competitive bidding for a large contract (245 trolleybuses) being offered by [[TransLink (British Columbia)|TransLink]], of [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia|B.C.]], [[Canada]] for supply of trolleybuses to the [[Trolleybuses in Vancouver|Vancouver trolleybus system]], but lost out to [[New Flyer Industries]].&lt;ref&gt;Bouc, Frantisek (July 15, 2004).

The '''(Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999) ''(FEMA)''''' is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]][[Parliament of India]] "to consolidate and amend the law relating to foreign exchange with the objective of facilitating external trade and payments and for promoting the orderly development and maintenance of foreign exchange market in India".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://finmin.nic.in/the_ministry/dept_eco_affairs/capital_market_div/FEMA_act_1999.pdf|title=THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE MANAGEMENT ACT, 1999|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was passed in the winter session of Parliament in 1999, replacing the [[Foreign Exchange Regulation Act]] (FERA). This act makes offences related to foreign exchange [[Civil law (common law)|civil offense]]s. It extends to the whole of [[India]].,&lt;ref name="FEMA, 1999"&gt;{{cite web |title=FEMA, 1999 |url=http://www.dor.gov.in/sites/upload_files/revenue/files/Foreign%20Exchange%20Management%20Act%201999.pdf |publisher=Dept of Revenue, Govt of India |accessdate=9 September 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AXmYchwr?url=http://www.indiankanoon.org/doc/600757/ |archivedate=9 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; replacing FERA, which had become incompatible with the pro- liberalization policies of the [[Government of India]]. It enabled a new [[Foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] management regime consistent with the emerging framework of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO). It also paved the way for the introduction of the [[Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002]], which  came into effect from 1 July 2005.

==Description==

Unlike other laws where ''everything is permitted unless specifically prohibited'', under the [[Foreign Exchange Regulation Act]] (FERA) of 1973 (predecessor to FEMA) ''everything was prohibited unless specifically permitted''. Hence the tenor and tone of the Act was very drastic. It required imprisonment even for minor offences. Under FERA, ''a person was presumed guilty unless he proved himself innocent'', whereas under other laws ''a person is presumed innocent unless he is proven guilty''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=AC Fernando|title=Business Environment|pages=427|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xaHonZv5dfIC&amp;pg=PA427 |publisher=[[Pearson Education]] |isbn=9788131731581|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FEMA is a regulatory mechanism that enables the Reserve Bank of India to pass regulations and the Central Government to pass rules relating to foreign exchange in tune with the Foreign Trade policy of India.

==History==
===Foreign Exchange Regulation Act===
{{Infobox legislation
| short_title = Foreign Exchange Regulation Act

}}

The '''Foreign Exchange Regulation Act''' ('''FERA''') was legislation passed in [[India]] in 1973&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gktoday.in/foreign-exchange-regulation-act-1973-fera/|title=Foreign Exchange Regulation Act 1999 (FERA) - General Knowledge Today|website=www.gktoday.in|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; that imposed strict regulations on certain kinds of payments, the dealings in [[foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] (forex)and [[securities]] and the transactions which had an indirect impact on the foreign exchange and the import and export of [[currency]].&lt;ref name="rbi"&gt;http://rbi.org.in/scripts/PublicationReportDetails.aspx?ID=377&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was formulated with the aim of regulating payments and foreign exchange.&lt;ref name="rbi"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://indiankanoon.org/doc/27905/|title=The Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973|website=indiankanoon.org|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FERA came into force with effect from January 1, 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.karmayog.org/centralgovtacts/centralgovtacts_6243.htm|title=The Foreign Exchange Regulation Acts (FERA) {{!}} Government  Acts (Alphabetically) {{!}} Central Govt. Acts (in alphabetical order) {{!}} www.karmayog.org|website=www.karmayog.org|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better|date=April 2017}}

FERA was introduced at a time when foreign exchange (Forex) reserves of the country were low, Forex being a scarce commodity. FERA therefore proceeded on the presumption that all foreign exchange earned by Indian residents rightfully belonged to the Government of India and had to be collected and surrendered to the [[Reserve Bank of India]] (RBI). FERA primarily prohibited all transactions not permitted by RBI.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.moneycontrol.com/glossary/property/fera_613.html|title=FERA|website=www.moneycontrol.com|access-date=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better|date=April 2017}}

Coca-Cola was India's leading soft drink until 1977 when it left India after a new government ordered the company to turn over its secret formula for Coca-Cola and dilute its stake in its Indian unit as required by the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA). In 1993, the company (along with PepsiCo) returned after the introduction of India's Liberalization policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/what-has-foreign-exchange-regulation-act-achieved/1/391995.html |title=FERA: The end of an era |work=[[India Today]] |date=5 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switch from FERA===
FERA did not succeed in restricting activities such as the expansion of Multinational Corporations. The concessions made to FERA in 1991-1993 showed that FERA was on the verge of becoming redundant. After the amendment of FERA in 1993, it was decided that the act would become the FEMA. This was done in order to relax the controls on foreign exchange in India.


FERA was repealed in 1998 by the government of [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]] and replaced by the Foreign Exchange Management Act, which liberalised [[foreign exchange controls]] and restrictions on foreign investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2005-11-27/news/27487763_1_fera-person-of-indian-origin-indian-passport |title=The Crucial difference |work=[[The Economic Times]] |date=27 November 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/foreign-exchange-regulation-act-had-a-controversial-stint-from-1973-to-2002/1/205502.html |title=FERA: Businessman's POTA |work=[[India Today]] |date=18 August 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2005-11-27/news/27487763_1_fera-person-of-indian-origin-indian-passport|title=The Crucial difference|website=timesofindia-economictimes|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The buying and selling of foreign currency and other debt instruments by businesses, individuals and governments happens in the foreign exchange market. Apart from being very competitive, this market is also the largest and most liquid market in the world as well as in India.It constantly undergoes changes and innovations, which can either be beneficial to a country or expose them to greater risks. The management of foreign exchange market becomes necessary in order to mitigate and avoid the risks. Central banks would work towards an orderly functioning of the transactions which can also develop their foreign exchange market. Foreign Exchange Market Whether under FERA or FEMA’s control, the need for the management of foreign exchange is important. It is necessary to keep adequate amount of foreign exchange from Import Substitution to Export Promotion.{{cn|date=December 2016}}

FEMA served to make transactions for external trade and easier – transactions involving current account for external trade no longer required RBI’s permission. The deals in Foreign Exchange were to be ‘managed’ instead of ‘regulated’. The switch to FEMA shows the change on the part of the government in terms of for the capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yourarticlelibrary.com/economics/indian-economy/main-features-of-the-foreign-exchange-management-act-fema/39551/|title=Main Features of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA)|website=YourArticleLibrary.com: The Next Generation Library|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis is the oldest of four children. Davis was 19 when his father died; he inherited his father's [[public relations]] firm and left college.&lt;ref name="Barabak" /&gt; In the late 1970s and early '80s, Davis was majority partner in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]] advertising agency Davis &amp; Nauser (with partner Jeffery Nauser), where his client list included just one political candidate, his uncle, then Tulsa mayoral candidate and current U.S. Senator [[Jim Inhofe]] (R, Oklahoma).

Davis left for California when Oklahoma's economy suffered from the collapse of the local oil industry.&lt;ref name="Barabak" /&gt; He founded and leads Strategic Perception, an advertising firm based in [[Hollywood]].&lt;ref name="Lapowsky"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.inc.com/issie-lapowsky/fred-davis-gop-most-notorious-ad-man.html|title=What You Can Learn from the GOP's Most Feared Ad Man|author=Issie Lapowsky|date=August 21, 2012|work=[[Inc.

==Work==
He created the ''Celebrity'' ad for presidential candidate [[John McCain]] and the ''[[Demon Sheep]]'' video for California Senate candidate [[Carly Fiorina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Scherer|first=Michael|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1960405,00.html|title=The Mastermind of Carly Fiorina's Demon-Sheep Ad|publisher=TIME|date= 2010-02-05|accessdate=2010-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis was described as "the most creative person in the business" by Republican media consultant Mark McKinnon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/public/article_print/SB122031187392488747.html |title=McCain Team Scrambles to Rescript Show |date= |accessdate=2010-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412035936/http://online.wsj.com/public/article_print/SB122031187392488747.html |archivedate=April 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His political clients have included [[George W. Bush|President George W. Bush]], presidential candidates [[Dan Quayle]], [[John McCain]], [[Jon Huntsman Jr.|Jon Huntsman]] and [[John Kasich]]. Senators [[Jim Inhofe]], [[John Cornyn]], [[Lamar Alexander]], [[John McCain]], [[Jeff Flake]], [[Bob Corker]], [[Chuck Grassley]], [[David Perdue]], John Kennedy, [[Ben Sasse]], [[Elizabeth Dole]] and [[Paul Coverdell]]. Also governors [[Sonny Perdue]], [[Rick Snyder]], [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], and [[Ernie Fletcher]].

His long-shot gubernatorial campaign for [[Sonny Perdue]] in Georgia featured a video of a giant Rat rampaging Georgia. The rat portrayed the current, popular governor [[Roy Barnes]]. The video is credited as starting the movement toward viral videos in politics. Perdue beat Barnes handily, in spite of being outspent more than seven to one.

A similar campaign for now-Governor [[Rick Snyder]] of Michigan featured the unusual Davis slogan, “One Tough Nerd.” The slogan caught on across the state helping propel the unknown Snyder past several statewide office holders into a primary win without a runoff, then the general election.

He created a well-known 2010 ad for [[United States Senate special election in Delaware, 2010|U.S. Senate candidate]] [[Christine O'Donnell]] which featured her declaring she was "not a witch", in response to the re-airing of past statements made by her about her interactions with non-Christian religious practices.&lt;ref name="McGreal2010-09-20"&gt;{{cite news|last=McGreal|first=Chris|title=Christine O'Donnell: I dabbled in witchcraft|date=2010-09-20|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|location=London|url =https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/20/christine-o-donnell-dabbled-witchcraft|accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; O’Donnell’s witch statements had become a staple of late night comedy programs, including Saturday Night Live, before Davis was hired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/09/kristen-wiig-parodies-chr_n_757116.html|title='SNL' Does The Best Parody Of Christine O'Donnell's 'Not A Witch' Ad Yet|work=Huffington Post|last=McGlynn|first=Katia|date=2010-10-10|accessdate=2010-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/20/elvira-christine-odonnell_n_770527.html|title=Elvira Spoofs Christine O'Donnell's 'I'm Not A Witch' Ad|work= Huffington Post|date=2010-10-20|accessdate=2010-12-03|first=Katla|last=McGlynn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/26/im-not-a-witch-the-remix/|title="I'm Not A Witch" — The Remix|work=The Ca10-2626-10|accessdate=2010-12-03|first=Ashley|last=Parker|date=2010-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, Davis authored a controversial ad for Representative [[Pete Hoekstra]] for his Senate campaign against incumbent Democrat [[Debbie Stabenow]]. The ad attacked Stabenow as Debbie "Spend-it-now" and showed an Asian woman riding a bicycle in a rice paddy thanking Stabenow (in broken English) for enriching the Chinese economy at the expense of the U.S. 

Republican strategist [[Mike Murphy (political consultant)|Mike Murphy]] tweeted that the ad was "really, really dumb,"&lt;ref name="hill"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/video/senate/208793-hoekstra-super-bowl-ad-hits-debbie-spend-it-now-on-debt|title=Hoekstra defends ad against charges of racial insensitivity|author=Cameron Joseph|date=February 6, 2012|work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|accessdate=January 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Stabenow called it "shocking" and "nasty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/02/offensive-pete-hoekstra-ad-draws-big-bucks-for-rival-sen-debbie-stabenow/|title='Offensive' Pete Hoekstra Ad Draws Big Bucks for Rival Sen. Debbie Stabenow|author=Amy Bingham|date=February 13, 2012|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=January 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoekstra denied that the ad was insensitive to Chinese Americans and was meant to focus on Stabenow's voting record.&lt;ref name="hill" /&gt; Within two weeks, the Hoekstra campaign removed the video from his campaign website and [[YouTube]] account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/david-catanese/2012/02/hoekstra-scrubs-superbowl-ad-from-sites-115093.html|title=Hoekstra scrubs Super Bowl ad from sites|author=David Catanese|date=February 21, 2014|work=[[Politico]]|accessdate=January 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Davis’ firm prepared a 57-page plan (commissioned by billionaire [[Joe Ricketts]]) for a $10 million campaign attempting to defeat the re-election of President Obama. It partially recycled points of criticism against Obama from the 2008 presidential campaign, including his relationship with Obama’s reverend, [[Jeremiah Wright]]. The proposal, titled, ''The Defeat of Barack Hussein Obama: The Ricketts Plan to End His Spending for Good,'' was initially approved by the Ricketts' Ending Spending Action Fund.

A copy of the proposal document was released by a person unconnected to the ad campaign to ''[[The New York Times]]'', after which it was roundly lambasted in external commentary. Ricketts then disavowed commissioning the plan. Although Davis' agency had gone at least as far as contacting [[Larry Elder]] to join the project, no ads were ever aired. Ricketts issued a statement disavowing the ad campaign hours after it was publicized by the ''New York Times.''

Other clients of Davis include [[George W. Bush]] and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].&lt;ref name="Lapowsky" /&gt;

'''Gildo Massó González''' (December 8, 1926 – January 15, 2007) was the founder and [[CEO]] of Masso Enterprises and also the developer of the concept of "build it yourself" low cost houses.

==Early years==
Massó was born and raised in [[San Lorenzo, Puerto Rico]] where he received his primary and secondary education. His parents were Rafael Massó Vázquez and Francisca González Padín. He was a hard working young man who admired the Puerto Rican political leader [[Luis Muñoz Marín]]. He helped support his family working in the local [[hardware store]]. After graduating from high school he enrolled in the [[University of Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref name="END"&gt;"Sepultan al gestor de la cadena de Ferreterias Masso"; El Nuevo Dia; page 4; January 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==First Masso Hardware Store==
In 1951, Massó opened his first hardware store, Ferretería Masso (Masso Hardware Store) in San Lorenzo, which became a successful venture.  He married Carmen Tuly Aponte in 1953. In 1954 he established his first cinder block factory.&lt;ref name="WOW"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.masso.net/ |title=Masso Enterprises |access-date=2010-08-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902063717/http://www.masso.net/ |archive-date=2010-09-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959, Massó ventured into the construction business and built the [[Urbanization|Massó Subdivision]] in San Lorenzo. In 1961, he opened Caguas' Lumber Yard in [[Caguas, Puerto Rico|Caguas]].  In 1967, the Massó Cement Factory moved to much larger facility in [[Gurabo, Puerto Rico|Gurabo]].&lt;ref name="END"/&gt;

==Casas Massó==
In 1974, with the need of affordable housing in [[Puerto Rico]], Massó developed a concept of selling low cost houses, made out of wood, known as Modelos Massó or Casas Massó (Masso Models).  The idea was to supply customers with the necessary elements to build a low cost home.  The all inclusive packages included floor plans, building materials and construction loans.&lt;ref name="END"/&gt;

In 1981, Massó acquired two Carlos Armstrong Hardware Stores in [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]] and in 1983, he opened the Cayey Home Center in [[Cayey, Puerto Rico|Cayey]].&lt;ref name="WOW"/&gt; In 1984 Massó built 550 residences in San Lorenzo, which is now known as "Massó City" and, in 1986, he built 67 residences in the Cerro Gordo sector of San Lorenzo.&lt;ref name="END"/&gt;

In 1992, Massó introduced the new Casas Massó which were made of cement, with the same concept as the first models.  In 1993, he set up a Super Massó Hardware Store consisting of 55,000 square feet (5,100 m²) and offering over 60,000 products in Caguas. In 1996, Massó Enterprises was involved in a project which built 169 residences in Paseo San Lorenzo. In 1997 Massó acquired six Builder's Square Stores in Caguas, [[Bayamon, Puerto Rico|Bayamon]], [[Carolina, Puerto Rico|Carolina]], [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]] and [[Mayaguez, Puerto Rico|Mayaguez]]. These were renamed Plaza Massó.&lt;ref name="END"/&gt;

In 1995, the Massó Hardware Store introduced Auto-Express in which the customer used a [[drive-through]] to make purchases. This concept increased sales by 15%.  

Gildo Massó introduced new models of the Casas Massó in 2001 and 2003.  

Massó Enterprises has over $65 million in annual sales. 
 
The company also has the training center"Massó School for all employees.&lt;ref name="WOW"/&gt;

==Later years==
Gildo Massó was named Business Man of the Year in 2004 and the VIP of the Week by Chrysler Corp.&lt;ref name="WOW"/&gt;

A devoted Catholic and to the fulfillment of his religious obligations, Gildo was a supporter and advocate of Cursillos de Cristiandad Movement for more than 40 years, both in the Archdiocese of San Juan and the Diocese of Caguas. He designed and generously directed the construction of both Casas de Cursillos in each diocesan community.&lt;ref name="END"/&gt;

On January 15, 2007, Gildo Massó died from health complications during a routine medical checkup, in the Auxilio Mutuo Hospital of San Juan, Puerto Rico. He is survived by his wife Carmen Tuly Aponte and his two children Gildo and Tuly Massó.&lt;ref name="WOW"/&gt;

{{DISPLAYTITLE:Illegal ''per se''}}
In [[US law]], the term '''illegal ''per se''''' means that the act is inherently illegal. Thus, an act is illegal without extrinsic proof of any surrounding circumstances such as lack of ''[[scienter]]'' (knowledge) or other defenses. Acts are made illegal ''per se'' by [[statute]], [[constitution]] or [[case law]].

==Drunk driving==
Many [[drunk driving]] laws make driving with a [[blood alcohol content]] over a certain limit (such as 0.05% or 0.08%) an act which is illegal ''per se''.

==Antitrust==
In the [[United States]], illegal ''[[wikt:per se|per se]]'' often refers to categories of [[Anti-competitive practices|anti-competitive behavior]] in [[antitrust]] [[law]] conclusively presumed to be an "unreasonable restraint on trade" and thus anti competitive.  The [[United States Supreme Court]] has, in the past, determined activities such as [[price fixing]], geographic [[market division]], and [[group boycott]] to be illegal ''per se'' regardless of the reasonableness of such actions. Traditionally, illegal ''per se'' anti-trust acts describe [[horizontal market]] arrangements among [[Competition (economics)|competitor]]s.

The illegal ''per se'' category can trace its origins in the 1898 Supreme Court case ''[[Addyston Pipe &amp; Steel Co. v. U.S.]]'', [[Case citation|175 U.S. 211]] (1898).

A number of cases have subsequently raised doubts about the validity of the illegal ''per se'' rule.  Under modern Antitrust theories, the traditionally illegal ''per se'' categories create more of a [[presumption]] of unreasonableness.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, ''[[Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.]]'', 441 U.S. 1 (1979); ''[[Nat's Collegiate Athletic Assn v. Board of Regents]]'', 468 U.S. 85, 98 (1984); ''[[Northwest Wholesale Stationers, Inc. v. Pacific Stationery &amp; Printing Co.]]'', 472 U.S. 284, 289 (1985); and ''[[FTC v. Indiana Federation of Dentists]]'', 476 U.S. 447 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;  The court carefully narrowed the ''per se'' treatment and began issuing guidelines.  Courts and agencies seeking to apply the ''per se'' rule must:
# show "the practice facially appears to be one that would always or almost always tend to restrict competition and decrease output";
# show that the practice is not "one designed to 'increase economic efficiency and render markets more, rather than less, competitive'";
# carefully examine market conditions; and
# absent good evidence of competitiveness behavior, avoid broadening ''per se'' treatment to new or innovative business relationships.

'''''Kommersant''''' ({{lang-ru|Коммерса́нтъ}}, {{IPA-ru|kəmʲɪrˈsant|IPA}}, ''The Businessman'', often shortened to '''[[Ъ]]''') is a nationally distributed daily newspaper published in [[Russia]] mostly devoted to politics and business. It is a leading liberal business broadsheet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The press in Russia|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4315129.stm|accessdate=29 November 2014|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=16 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TNS Media and NRS Russia certified July 2013 circulation of the daily was 120,000-130,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kommersant.ru/about/kommersant|title=Kommersant Website; (Russian)|year=2013|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The newspaper was initially published in 1909, and it was closed down following the [[Bolshevik]] seizure of power and the introduction of censorship in 1917.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

In 1989, with the onset of press freedom in Russia, ''Kommersant'' was re-established under the ownership of businessman and publicist [[Vladimir Yakovlev (journalist)|Vladimir Yakovlev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/source-profile/356511-kommersant|title=Kommersant; Presseurop (English)|work=Presseurop|year=2012|accessdate=13 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To make the point that the publication had outlasted the Soviet regime, "Kommersant" is spelled in Russian with a terminal [[Yer|hard sign]] (ъ) &amp;ndash; a letter that is silent at the end of a word in modern Russian, and was thus largely abolished by the post-revolution [[Reforms of Russian orthography#The post-revolution reform|Russian spelling reform]]. This is played up in the Kommersant logo, which features a script hard sign at the end of somewhat more formal font. The newspaper also refers to itself or its redaction as “Ъ”.

In 1997, autos-to-Aeroflot mogul [[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Boris Berezovsky]] &amp;ndash; a member of the former President Boris Yeltsin's 'family'&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/russia/article/0,,2056443,00.html/ ''Fortune made in Yeltsin era''] &amp;ndash; ''Guardian'', 13 April 2007. Retrieved 24 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; bought the Kommersant publishing house, which included ''Kommersant-daily'', two serious weekly magazines (the political ''Kommersant-vlast'' (literally 'Power') and the financial ''[[Kommersant Dengi]]'' ('Money') &amp;ndash; as well as entertainment magazines ''Domovoi'' and ''Avtopilot'' and ''Molotok'', a teen magazine, which later incurred the authorities' wrath.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.pravda.ru/russia/kremlin/82774-1/ ''Prosecutors to save Russian teenagers from SMS pornography'' &amp;ndash; ''Pravda'', 30 June 2006]. Retrieved 24 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Berezovsky sacked ''Kommersant'''s director-general, Andrei Vassiliev, and editor-in-chief, Alexander Stukalin, on 14 July 2005&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bu.edu/iscip/digest/vol10/ed1008.html Boston University publication, July 2005]. Retrieved 14 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; in a move widely seen as preparation for the 2008 [[Russian presidential election, 2008|Russian presidential elections]].

In January 2005, ''Kommersant'' published blank pages as a protest at a court ruling ordering it to publish a denial of a story about a crisis at [[Alfa-Bank]]. The sole article in the paper was this one, published upside down, on the front page. The headline of the article was "Full Plaintiff" (полный истец) which has little meaning, but rhymes with a [[Russian mat|Russian swear word]], meaning "complete disaster" ({{Lang-ru|[[Russian mat|полный пиздец]]|links=|translit=polniy pizdets}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|script-title=ru:Полный истец|url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?DocsID=543041|work=Kommersant| location=Moscow|date=31 January 2005|language= Russian|accessdate=24 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The English version of the article was headed "Alfa-d Up".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Alfa-d Up|url=http://www.kommersant.com/p543041/r_524/Alfa-d_Up/|work=Kommersant|location=Moscow|date=31 January 2005|accessdate=28 August 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606111951/http://www.kommersant.com/p543041/r_524/Alfa-d_Up/|archivedate=6 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berezovsky sold the Kommersant publishing house to an old friend and business partner, Georgian fruit canner and opposition television station owner [[Badri Patarkatsishvili]], who was already chairman of the Kommersant company's board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.editorsweblog.org/print_newspapers/2006/02/russian_publishing_house_kommersant_gets.php/ ''Russian publishing house Kommersant gets a new owner'' &amp;ndash; Editors Weblog, World Association of Newspapers, 28 February 2006 quoting ''Ekspert'' magazine]. Retrieved 24 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2006, Patarkatsishvili sold his 100% stake in the Kommersant publishing house to [[Alisher Usmanov]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/lists/2006/10/GIPI.html/ ''Alisher Usmanov'', ''Forbes''] Retrieved 24 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; head of Gazprom's Gazprominvestholding subsidiary.

After clashing with Usmanov, ''Kommersant'' editor-in-chief Vladislav Borodulin left the paper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.editorsweblog.org/newsrooms_and_journalism/2006/10/russia_kommersant_editor_quits.php ''Kommersant editor quits'' - World Association of Newspapers, quoting the Associated Press, 2 October 2006]. Retrieved 24 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; "[Borodulin’s] decision to resign was not forced, but evidently they expressed different views on how the publishing house should be developed," said the group's commercial director. Andrei Vasilyev, appointed for a second stint at the helm of the daily &amp;ndash; after a long run from 1999 to 2005&amp;ndash; said ''Kommersant-daily'' had no intention of following any imposed policy, and added that the edition would carry articles that might not please the owner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.rian.ru/russia/20061002/54450883.html ''New/old Kommersant editor vows to maintain line''- RIA Novosti, 2 October 2006]. Retrieved 24 July  2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 December 2008 the publication of articles in English ceased, and currently the Kommersant website has no English version. Since February 2009 ''Kommersant'' newspaper is printed and distributed in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kommersant.uk.com |title="Коммерсантъ" United Kingdom|work=Kommersant|accessdate=13 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the paper began hosting US-Russia Crosstalk, a joint initiative between ''Kommersant'' and the [[Valdai Discussion Club|Valdai Club]] in Russia, and ''[[The Washington Times]]'' and the [[Center for the National Interest]] in the United States, featuring foreign policy related discussion regarding relations between the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/us-russia-crosstalk/|title=U.S.-Russia Crosstalk - Washington Times|last=http://www.washingtontimes.com|first=The Washington Times|website=www.washingtontimes.com|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Court cases==
In January 2000 ''Kommersant'' was found guilty of libel against Russian entrepreneur [[Alex Konanykhin]] and ordered to pay compensation of US$3,000,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://themoscowtimes.com/news/article/us-court-finds-kommersant-guilty-of-libel/267610.html|title= U.S. Court Finds Kommersant Guilty of Libel|work= The Moscow Times|date= 25 January 2000|accessdate= 13 January 2011|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120418214924/http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/us-court-finds-kommersant-guilty-of-libel/267610.html|archivedate= 18 April 2012|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009 a Russian MP and prominent businessman [[Oleg Mikheyev]] sued the ''Kommersant'' for $217 million, claiming that one of the newspaper's articles "spoiled of his bank so badly it had to be sold at disadvantageous price". The court dismissed the judicial proceeding due to jurisdictional issues.&lt;ref&gt;

Each year, MassChallenge admits over 300 finalists to its three- to four-month accelerator program across its five locations: Boston, Israel, Mexico, Switzerland, and the UK. These accelerators provide startups with free office space, mentorship and more. At the end of the program, the most promising startups are awarded equity-free cash prizes.&lt;ref name="MassChallenge model"/&gt;

In addition to the original Boston location, MassChallenge runs accelerator programs in London, Lausanne, Jerusalem and Mexico City.  The organization's funding comes primarily from sponsorships from large corporations including [[Fidelity Investments]], [[Verizon]], [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], [[AmericanAirlines]] and [[Microsoft]], and from [[the Commonwealth of Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="MassChallenge Sponsors"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://masschallenge.org/partnerships/sponsors|title=MassChallenge US Sponsors|publisher=MassChallenge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Launched in April 2010, MassChallenge began in earnest in May 2009 when co-founders John Harthorne and Akhil Nigam quit their jobs as consultants at [[Bain &amp; Company]] to pursue their idea for a startup competition. In the midst of [[2007–2012 global economic crisis|financial crisis]], the two decided that their talents would be better served by helping entrepreneurs than by advising big multinationals.&lt;ref name="Forbes" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Economist&gt;{{cite news|title=A helping hand for start-ups|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21531482|publisher=The Economist|accessdate=8 October 2011|date=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MassChallenge garnered early support from successful entrepreneurs, [[the Commonwealth of Massachusetts]], and large corporations. The earliest supporters of MassChallenge included [[Gururaj Deshpande|Desh Deshpande]], founder of [[Sycamore Networks]], [[Thomas Menino]], [[Mayor of Boston]], [[Greg Bialecki]], the Massachusetts Secretary of Housing and Economic Development, [[Blackstone Group|The Blackstone Charitable Foundation]], [[Microsoft]] and Joe Fallon, a local real estate developer who donated the fourteenth floor of ONE Marina Park Drive,&lt;ref name="Forbes" /&gt; However, the MassChallenge offices recently relocated to the 21 DryDock Avenue in Boston's Design Center.

The organization originally attracted applications from 446 startups for its first program in 2010, selecting 111 companies to join the accelerator.&lt;ref name="Kirsner 5-11"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kirsner|first=Scott|title=MassChallenge start-up competition picks 125 finalists for 2011|url=http://www.boston.com/business/technology/innoeco/2011/05/masschallenge_start-up_competi_1.html|publisher=Boston.com|accessdate=12 November 2012|date=24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The number of applications grew to 733 for the 2011 accelerator&lt;ref name="Kirsner 5-11" /&gt; and to 1,237 for the 2012 accelerator.&lt;ref name="Johnson 10-12"&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson |first=Katie |title=MassChallenge awards $1 million to 16 start-ups |url=http://www.boston.com/business/innovation/2012/10/23/masschallenge-awards-million-start-ups/ver0HgppsQ6MHm02XQAT9H/story.html |accessdate=12 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |work=The Boston Globe |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111054951/http://www.boston.com/business/innovation/2012/10/23/masschallenge-awards-million-start-ups/ver0HgppsQ6MHm02XQAT9H/story.html |archivedate=November 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Approximately 10% of applicants were accepted to the 2012 program.&lt;ref name="Johnson 10-12" /&gt;

Recently, MassChallenged opened a MADE@MassChallenge, a research and development lab that startups can use at their Drydock office. Additionally, the organization launched a digital health lab, PULSE@MassChallenge at Hatch Fenway, and the Newton Innovation Center, a location designed for startups farther from Boston proper.

As of early 2016, MassChallenge has formed a partnership with [[Our Generation Speaks]], a fellowship program and startup incubator whose mіѕѕіоn іѕ to bring together young Israeli and Palestinian leaders through entrepreneurship.

===Global expansion===

MassChallenge Israel was launched in Jerusalem in 2016 with a mission to enable top-tier Israeli startups access global markets. With the help of Israeli mentors and judges, MassChallenge Israel identifies the highest-potential startups in Israel to relocate to the MassChallenge headquarters in Boston for the summer and participate in the four-month accelerator program. These startups will be able to return to Israel after the MassChallenge accelerator with new sales channels, investors, mentors, and growth that wouldn't otherwise be feasible.&lt;ref name="MassChallenge Israel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://masschallenge.org/programs/israel|title=MassChallenge Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MassChallenge UK was launched in London in 2015. It runs a nearly identical four-month accelerator program based out of London's historic Tobacco Dock. Its first accelerator program attracted 800 applications, had 90 finalists and 26 winners.&lt;ref name="MassChallenge UK"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://masschallenge.org/programs/uk|title=MassChallenge UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, MassChallenge launched locations in Mexico City and Lausanne, Switzerland. The MassChallenge Switzerland has chosen its finalists and is currently in the process of its first accelerator program.&lt;ref name="MassChallenge Switzerland"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://masschallenge.org/programs/switzerland|title=MassChallenge Switzerland}}&lt;/ref&gt; MassChallenge Mexico is receiving its first round of applicants this year.&lt;ref name="MassChallenge Mexico"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://masschallenge.org/programs/mexico|title=MassChallenge Mexico}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, MassChallenge announced a goal with the Clinton Global Initiative to expand into ten cities on all populated continents by 2019.&lt;ref name="MassChallenge Partners with Clinton Global Initiative"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bostinno.streetwise.co/2014/06/24/masschallenge-partners-with-clinton-global-initiative-and-will-expand-into-10-more-cities-around-the-globe-by-2019/|title=MassChallenge Will Expand into 10 More Cities Around the Globe by 2019|publisher=BostInno}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next sites for accelerator programs are unknown, but MassChallenge is active in many countries already through its smaller "bootcamp" style Bridge Programs that serve to intensively train high potential entrepreneurs across the globe. Bridge Programs have been conducted with entrepreneurs in Colombia, Mexico, Russia, Switzerland, and South Korea.

==Structure==

===Startup accelerator===
MassChallenge’s startup accelerator program connects entrepreneurs with resources to help them succeed. The program lasts four months and takes place in the MassChallenge offices in Boston, London, Mexico City, Jerusalem, and Lausanne.

MassChallenge entrepreneurs typically build a small team of 2-4 mentors and work with those experts throughout the accelerator. Every match between entrepreneur and mentor is mutual. MassChallenge never forces a relationship, but does help entrepreneurs and mentors make connections. The organization matches entrepreneurs with expert mentors, who are a mix of senior executives, lawyers, marketing consultants and successful entrepreneurs. There are over 700 mentors in the MassChallenge network.&lt;ref name="MassChallenge model"/&gt;

MassChallenge organizes hundreds of events and training sessions during the four-month program, including a one-week “Boot Camp.” Events range from large lectures and networking events to small workshops.

During the four months, the entrepreneurs work out of MassChallenge's offices located in South Boston's "Innovation District".&lt;ref name="Innovation District"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Farrell|first1=Michael|title=MassChallenge to Remain in Innovation District|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2013/09/19/masschallenge-remain-innovation-district/YXx1ubjDvkHLe4w7DwES7N/story.html|website=Boston.com|publisher=The Boston Globe|accessdate=17 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Startup competition====

MassChallenge uses a competition framework to provide resources to top startups. Two rounds of judging determine the class of 100+ “finalists,” which are invited to participate in the four-month accelerator program. Several more rounds of judging determine cash winners. MassChallenge judges award a total of $1 million in grants to 10-20 startups in amounts of either $100,000 or $50,000. The startups are judged on “impact, feasibility, and execution.” MassChallenge judges have included [[Vertex Pharmaceuticals]] founder Josh Boger, famous tech entrepreneur [[Gururaj Deshpande|Desh Deshpande]], and [[Boston Celtics]] owner [[Wyc Grousbeck]].&lt;ref name="Johnson 10-12" /&gt;

Entrants must be in the early stages of their business to be eligible. MassChallenge defines this as no more than “$500K of investment” and “$1M in annual revenue.” MassChallenge does not take any equity in its winners or place any restrictions on any of the entrepreneurs in exchange for the cash prizes.&lt;ref name="Forbes" /&gt; Unlike some other startup accelerators, MassChallenge does not provide cash upfront. It provides grants to winners after the program.

All finalists have access to multiple other prizes and in-kind deals throughout the accelerator program. Other prizes include; The Center for the Advancement of Science in Space (CASIS) provides an additional $600,000 prize and the opportunity to use the International Space Station National Laboratory as the ultimate research or technology development platform, Perkins School for the Blind offers an additional $25,000 to encourage participants in MassChallenge to develop new, low- and high-technology devices that could make a significant impact on the quality of life for people with disabilities. The John W. Henry Family Foundation provides additional grants to support the startup or startups in the 2013 MassChallenge accelerator with the most compelling social impact potential. Microsoft’s New England Research &amp; Development Center is supporting a $50,000 prize for the startup or startups that solve civic challenges through technology. MassChallenge partners provide startups with a massive range of in-kind deals, collectively valued at over $10 million.These deals include legal advice, marketing &amp; media support, talent &amp; hiring partners, and special deals in software, hosting, manufacturing, airfare, shipping and much more.

'''''Necessary But Not Sufficient''''' is a 2000 novel authored by Dr. [[Eliyahu Goldratt]] and co-authors Eli Schrangenheim and Carol A. Ptak and published by the [[North River Press]], which has previously published most of Goldratt's works. Necessary but not Sufficient is written as a "business novel" and shows the fictional application of the [[Theory of Constraints]] to [[Enterprise resource planning]] (ERP) and operations software and organizations using that software. The fourth of five published Goldratt business novels, this one does not share any of the settings or characters of the previous three novels (only ''[[The Goal]]'' and ''[[It's Not Luck]]'' shared the same characters).

"Technology is a necessary condition, but it's not sufficient. To get the benefits at the time that we install the new technology, we must also change the rules that recognize the existence of the limitation." (p. 125)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10709">'''Online counseling''' is the provision of professional [[mental health]] counseling services through the Internet. Services are typically offered via [[email]], [[Online chat|real-time chat]], and [[video conferencing]].&lt;ref name=Mallen1 /&gt;  Some clients use online counseling in conjunction with traditional [[psychotherapy]], or nutritional counseling, and a growing number of clients are using online counseling as a replacement for office visits.&lt;ref name=Mallen1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mallen|first=Michael J.|author2=David L.

While some form of [[Telephone counseling|tele-psychology]] has been available for over 35 years,&lt;ref name=Mallen_Main&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mallen|first=Michael J.|author2=Vogel|author3=Rochlen|author4=Day|title=Online Counseling Reviewing the Literature From a Counseling Psychology Framework|journal=The Counseling Psychologist|date=November 2005|volume=33|issue=6|pages=819–871|doi=10.1177/0011000005278624|url=http://tcp.sagepub.com/content/33/6/819.abstract|accessdate=4 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the advent of internet video chat systems and the increasing penetration of [[Broadband Internet access|broadband]] has resulted in a growing movement towards online therapy. Many of the methods used to facilitate online therapy sessions include a multimedia access platform such as TalkSpace, BetterHelp, and 7 Cups Online Therapy. Both of which enable users to receive initial treatment and therapy in a safe and discreet manner. Clients are using videoconferencing, live chat and email with professional [[psychologists]] in place of or in addition to face-to-face meetings.&lt;ref name=Mallen_Main /&gt;

== History ==
Since the beginning of the internet in 1972, several creative people perceived the potential of the internet for the therapeutic communication. In 1972, computers from Stanford and UCLA simulated a psychotherapy session that was considered the very beginning of online counseling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Skinner|first1=Ardiran|last2=Zack|first2=Jason|title=Counseling and the Internet|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|volume=48|issue=4|page=434-446|doi=10.1177/0002764204270280}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time the internet went public, this launch went hand in hand with the development of the first [[Self-help groups for mental health|self-help groups]] on the internet who were, in that time, very popular. In 1995, Martha Ainsworth had a couple of psychological complaints where she wanted to get rid of it, so she began searching for a competent therapist. Because her travel requirements made it difficult for her to consult a face-to-face therapist, she searched for an effective alternative online, but only found a dozen webpages that offered online treatment for psychological complaints. Afterwards, Martha Ainsworth wanted to reach the general public with her experiences and founded a sort of clearinghouse for mental health websites, named Metanoia. This database seemed to be a very efficient store-room and by the year 2000, this clearinghouse contained over 250 websites of private practices, and more than 700 online clinics where a therapist could be contacted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alleman|first=James R.|title=Online counseling: The Internet and mental health treatment|journal=Psychotherapy: Theory, Research, Practice, Training|volume=39|issue=2|pages=199–209|doi=10.1037/0033-3204.39.2.199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to metanoia.org, the first service to offer online mental healthcare was "Ask Uncle Ezra", created by staff of Cornell University in 1986 for students.&lt;ref name=matanoia/&gt; By mid-1995 several fee-based online services offering mental health advice had appeared.&lt;ref name=matanoia&gt;{{cite web|last=Ainsworth|first=M|title=E-therapy: History and survey|url=http://www.metanoia.org/imhs/history.htm|accessdate=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1994 and 2002, a group of trained volunteer crisis counselors called "[[Samaritans (charity)|Samaritans]]", began providing suicide prevention services via email.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Kraus|editor-first=Ron|title=Online counseling: a handbook for mental health professionals|date=2004|publisher=Academic|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-0124259553|author1=Zack, Jason |author2=Stricker, George }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==

A growing body of research into online counseling has established the efficacy of online therapy with treatment outcomes at least equal to traditional in-office settings.&lt;ref name=Mallen_Main /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://freeonlinetherapy.org/online-therapy-study/ |title=7 out of 10 People Say Online Therapy Helps Reduce Their Depression |last= |first= |date=August 2018 |website=Free Online Therapy |publisher= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;   The number of missed appointments is much less than with in-person therapy.&lt;ref name=Glueckauf1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Glueckauf|first=R.L.|author2=Fritz|author3= Ecklund-Johnson|author4=Liss|author5=Dages|author6=Carney|title=Videoconferencing-based family counseling for rural teenagers with epilepsy|journal=[[Rehabilitation Psychology (journal)|Rehabilitation Psychology]]|year=2002|volume=47|pages=49–72|doi=10.1037/0090-5550.47.1.49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Online counseling is also filling the unmet need for clients located in areas traditionally under-served by traditional counselors. Rural residents and [[expats]] along with under-served [[minorities]] often have an easier time finding a suitable therapist online than in their local communities.&lt;ref name=Mallen_Main /&gt;  

Online counseling has also been shown to be effective for clients who may have difficulty reaching appointments during normal business hours.&lt;ref name=Chang&gt;{{cite journal|last=Change|first=T.|author2=Yeh, Krumboltz|title=Process and outcome evaluation of an on-line support group for Asian American male college students|journal=[[Journal of Counseling Psychology]]|year=2001|volume=48|pages=319–329|doi=10.1037/0022-0167.48.3.319|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, research is demonstrating that online counseling may be useful for [[disabled]] and rural people that traditionally under-utilize clinical services.&lt;ref name=Mallen_Main /&gt;

Studies have shown the efficacy of online therapy despite the controversy of cost.{{mcn|date=September 2018}} Online Platforms such as TalkSpace, BetterHelp, and 7 Cups Online, offer case by case specific therapy methods including "groups" as well as one on one sessions. Such methods of online therapy can be sustainable means of getting therapy to the right people and at their own location. One of the key aspects of online therapy is that it can be done at the convenience of the user as well as in a place which the user deems safe and is able to follow through with the therapy.

==Effectiveness==

Research from G.S. Stofle and J. suggests that online counseling would benefit people functioning at a moderately high level.&lt;ref name=Stofle_book&gt;{{cite book|last=Stofle|first=G.S.|title=Choosing an online therapist|year=2001|publisher=White Hat Communications}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Suler&gt;{{cite journal|last=Suler|first=J|title=Psychotherapy in cyberspace: A 5 dimensional model of online and computer-mediated psychotherapy|journal=CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior|year=2000|volume=3|pages=151–160|doi=10.1089/109493100315996|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Severe situations, such as [[suicidal ideation]] or a [[psychotic episode]], might be better served by traditional face-to-face methods,&lt;ref name=Zelvin_book&gt;{{cite book|last=Zelvin|first=E.|title=Online Counseling Skills Part I: Treatment Strategies and Skills for Conducting Counseling Online|year=2004|publisher=Academic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; although further research may prove otherwise.&lt;ref name=Mallen_Main /&gt;

Cohen and Kerr conducted a study on the effectiveness of online therapy for treatment of [[anxiety disorders]] in students and found that there was no difference in the level of change for the two modes as measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.&lt;ref name=Cohen&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=G.E.|author2=Kerr, B.A.|title=Computer-mediated counseling: An empirical study of a new mental health treatment|journal=Computers in Human Services|year=1998|volume=15|pages=13–26|doi=10.1300/J407v15n04_02|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the main goal of counseling is to alleviate the distress, anxiety or concerns experienced by a client when he or she enters therapy, online counseling has strong efficacy under that definition.&lt;ref name=Mallen_Main /&gt;  Client satisfaction surveys tend to demonstrate a high level of client satisfaction with online counseling, while the providers sometimes demonstrate lower satisfaction with distance methods.&lt;ref name=Dongier&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dongier|first=M.|author2=Templer, R. |author3=Lalinec-Michaud, M. |author4=Meuneir, D. |title=Telepsychiatry: Psychiatric consultation through two-way television: A controlled study|journal=[[Canadian Journal of Psychiatry]]|volume=31|pages=32–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nutrition counseling specific to conditions is available by many consultants online using Skype or another face-to-face program. This is especially effective for people with a busy work schedule, and others who can't make it to an office regularly. Online consulting for imbalances in [[blood lipid]] levels, [[blood sugar regulation]], and other health conditions make it easier to manage when using nutritional approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eat.22319/abstract|title=Best nutrition counseling practices for the treatment of anorexia nervosa: A Delphi study|first1=Anne M.|last1=Mittnacht|first2=Cynthia M.|last2=Bulik|date=1 January 2015|publisher=|journal=International Journal of Eating Disorders|volume=48|issue=1|pages=111–122|via=Wiley Online Library|doi=10.1002/eat.22319}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mittnacht, A.

==Controversy==

There is a split within the counseling field on the validity of online counseling. Some [[Psychiatric and mental health nurse practitioner|practitioners]] have suggested that online counseling cannot be considered quality psychotherapy.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14424">'''Programming productivity''' (also called '''software productivity''' or '''development productivity''') describes the degree of the ability of individual programmers or development teams to build and evolve software systems. Productivity traditionally refers to the ratio between the quantity of software produced and the cost spent for it. Here the delicacy lies in finding a reasonable way to define software quantity.

==Terminology==
Productivity is an important topic investigated in disciplines as various as manufacturing, organizational psychology, industrial engineering, strategic management, finance, accounting, marketing and economics. Levels of analysis include the individual, the group, divisional, organizational and national levels [5]. Due to this diversity, there is no clear-cut definition of productivity and its influencing factors, although research has been conducted for more than a century. Like in software engineering, this lack of common agreement on what actually constitutes productivity, is perceived as a major obstacle for a substantiated discussion of productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Neal, A., Hesketh, B., Anderson, N., Ones, D. S., Sinangil, H. K., Viswesvaran, C. (ed.) Handbook of Industrial, Work and Organizational Psychology Productivity in Organizations. Sage Publications Ltd, 2002, 8-24&lt;/ref&gt; The following definitions describe the best consensus on the terminology.&lt;ref name="tangen2005"&gt;Tangen, S. Demystifying productivity and performance, International Journal of Productivity and Performance, 2005, 54, 34-36&lt;/ref&gt;

===Productivity===

While there is no commonly agreed on definition of productivity, there appears to be an agreement that productivity describes the ratio between output and input:

Productivity = Output / Input

However, across the various disciplines different notions and, particularly, different measurement units for input and output can be found. The manufacturing industry typically uses a straightforward relation between the number of units produced and the number of units consumed.&lt;ref&gt;Chew, B. W. No-Nonsense Guide to Measuring Productivity. Harvard Business Review, 1988, 66, 110-115&lt;/ref&gt;  Non-manufacturing industries usually use man-hours or similar units to enable comparison between outputs and inputs.

One basic agreement is that the meaning of productivity and the means for measuring it vary depending of what context is under evaluation. In a manufacturing company the possible contexts are:&lt;ref name="tangen2005" /&gt;

* the individual machine or manufacturing system;
* the manufacturing function, for example assembly;
* the manufacturing process for a single product or group of related products;
* the factory; and
* the company’s entire factory system

As long classical production processes are considered a straightforward metric of productivity is simple: how many units of a product of specified quality is produced by which costs. For intellectual work, productivity is much trickier. How do we measure the productivity of authors, scientists, or engineers? Due to the rising importance of [[knowledge work]] (as opposed to manual work),&lt;ref name="drucker1999"&gt;Drucker, P. F. Knowledge-Worker Productivity: The Biggest Challenge. California Management Review, 1999, 41, 79-94&lt;/ref&gt; many researchers tried to develop productivity measurement means that can be applied in a non-manufacturing context. It is commonly agreed that the nature of knowledge work fundamentally differs from manual work and, hence, factors besides the simple output/input ratio need to be taken into account, e.g. quality, timeliness, autonomy, project success, customer satisfaction and innovation. However, the research communities in neither discipline have been able to establish broadly applicable and accepted means for productivity measurement yet.&lt;ref name="ramirez2004"&gt;Ramírez, Y. W., Nembhard, D. A. Measuring knowledge worker productivity: A taxonomy. Journal of Intellectual Capital, 2004, 5, 602-628&lt;/ref&gt; The same holds for more specific area of programming productivity.

===Profitability===

Profitability and performance are closely linked and are, in fact, often confused. However, as profitability is usually defined as the ratio between revenue and cost

Profitability = Revenue / Cost

It has a wider scope than performance, i.e. the number of factors that influence profitability is greater than the number of factors than influence productivity. Particularly, profitability can change without any change to the productivity, e.g. due to external conditions like cost or price inflation. Besides that, the interdependency between productivity and profitability is usually delayed, i.e. gains in productivity are rarely reflected in immediate profitability gains are more likely realized on the long-term.

===Performance===

The term performance is even broader than productivity and profitability and covers a plethora of factors that influence a company’s success. Hence, well-known performance controlling instruments like the [[Balanced Scorecard]] do include productivity as a factor that is central but not unique. Other relevant factors are e.g. the customers’ or stakeholders’ perception of the company.

===Efficiency and Effectiveness===

Efficiency and effectiveness are terms that provide further confusion as they themselves are often mixed up and, additionally, efficiency is often confused with productivity. The difference between efficiency and effectiveness is usually explained informally as ''efficiency is doing things right'' and ''effectiveness is doing the right things''. While there are numerous other definitions,&lt;ref name="tangen2005" /&gt; there is a certain agreement that efficiency refers to the utilisation of resources and mainly influences the required input of the productivity ratio.  Effectiveness on the other hand mainly influences the output of the productivity ratio as it usually has direct consequences for the customer. Effectiveness can be defined as "the ability to reach a desired output".

Generally, it is assumed, that efficiency can be quantified, e.g. by utilization rates, considerably more easily than effectiveness.

===Quality===

Tangen states: "Improvements in quality, other than the fact that no-fault products add to output levels, ought not to be included in the concept of productivity."&lt;ref name="tangen2005" /&gt;  However, most of the classic literature in non-software disciplines, especially in the manufacturing area, does not explicitly discuss the role of quality of the output in the productivity ratio.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, B. E. &amp; Baron, J. P. Evaluating Knowledge Worker Productivity: Literature Review Construction Engineering Research Lab (USACERL), 1994&lt;/ref&gt; More recent works from non-manufacturing disciplines have a stronger focus on knowledge, office or white-collar work and hence increasingly discuss the role of quality with respect to quality.&lt;ref name="drucker1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ramirez2004" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Al-Darrab, I. A. Relationships between productivity, efficiency, utilization, and quality. Work Study, 2000, 49, 97-104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="saari2006"&gt;Saari, S. Productivity: Theory and Measurement. In Business Proc. of the European Productivity Conference (EPC), 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ray, P., Sahu, S. The Measurement and Evaluation of White-collar Productivity. International Journal of Operations &amp; Production Management, 1989, 9, 28-47&lt;/ref&gt;

Drucker stresses the importance of quality for the evaluation of knowledge worker productivity: "Productivity of knowledge work therefore has to aim first at obtaining quality—and not minimum quality but optimum if not maximum quality. Only then can one ask: "What is the volume, the quantity of work?""&lt;ref name="drucker1999" /&gt;

Saari captures the importance of quality with his extended formula for productivity:&lt;ref name="saari2006" /&gt;
 
Total productivity = (Output quality and quantity)/(Input quality and quantity)

However, it appears that these efforts to include the quality in the determination of productivity did not lead to an operationalizable concept yet. It currently remains unclear how to quantify the vague terms “Output quality and quantity” as well as “Input quality and quantity”, let alone to calculate the ratio.

==State-of-the-Art in Programming Productivity==

In software development things are more complicated than in the production of goods. Software development is an engineering process.

===COCOMO II===

Boehm was one of the first researchers that systematically approached the field of software productivity. His cost estimation model [[COCOMO]] – now COCOMO II&lt;ref&gt;Boehm et al. Software Cost Estimation with COCOMO II, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; - is standard software engineering knowledge. In this model, he defines a set of factors that influence productivity such as the required reliability or the capability of the analysts. These factors have been widely reused in other similar productivity approaches. The rest of the model is based on function points and finally [[source lines of code]] (LOC). The limitations of LOC as a productivity measure are well-known.

===Jones's Software Productivity===

Jones is the author of a series of books on software productivity. Besides several theoretical considerations his main contribution is the systematic provision and integration of a large amount of data relevant for productivity analyses. In at least two of his books,&lt;ref&gt;Jones, C. Software Assessments, Benchmarks, and Best Practices. Addison-Wesley, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Casper. &lt;u&gt;Programming Productivity&lt;/u&gt; McGraw-Hill, Inc. p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; he gives a number of productivity factors but also points out that for each project a different set of factors are influential. These factors can form a basis for productivity assessments and for comparison with industrial averages.

This is one such list:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The 20 factors whose quantified impacts on software projects have been determined from historical data are the following:

* Programming language used
* Program size
* The experience of programmers and design personnel
* The novelty of requirements
* The complexity of the program and its data 
* The use of structured programming methods
* Program class or the distribution method
* Program type of the application area
* Tools and environmental conditions
* Enhancing existing programs or systems
* Maintaining existing programs or systems
* Reusing existing modules and standard designs
* Program generators
* Fourth-generation languages
* Geographic separation of development locations
* Defect potentials and removal methods
* (Existing) Documentation
* Prototyping before main development begins
* Project teams and organization structures
* Morale and compensation of staff &lt;ref&gt;Jones, Casper. &lt;u&gt;Programming Productivity&lt;/u&gt; McGraw-Hill, Inc. p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Function Points===

[[Function points]] were proposed in 1977 by Albrecht as a better size measure for software than LOC. In that it is based on the specification of the software and thereby aims at measuring the size of its functionality rather than the code itself. The reason is that the size of the code not only depends on the size of the functionality but also on the capability of the programmer: better programmers will produce less code for the same functionality. The function points have undergone several redesigns over the years mainly driven by the International Function Point User Group (IFPUG). This group is large with over 1200 companies as member which shows the rather strong acceptance of this measure. However, in many domains it still lacks practical application because it is often conceived as only applicable to business information systems.

===Value-Based Software Engineering===

Several researchers proposed economic-driven or value-based software engineering as an important paradigm in future software engineering research. Boehm and Huang point out that is it not only important to track the costs in a software project but also the real earned value, i.e. the value for the customer.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Boehm, Li Guo Huang. Value-Based Software Engineering: A Case Study. IEEE Software, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; They explain that it is important to create the software business case and keep it up to date. In essence, value-based software engineering focuses on the customer value, mainly measured in monetary units.

===Peopleware===

The famous book [[Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams]] by de Marco and Lister&lt;ref&gt;Tom DeMarco, Timothy Lister. Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; brought the importance of people-related factors to the attention of a broader audience. They collected in many software projects experiences with good and bad management practice that have an influence on the productivity of the team. They and others showed that these are the decisive issues in software engineering but were only able to describe them anecdotally.

== Factors influencing programming productivity ==
There are probably a large number of factors influencing the programming productivity of individuals and teams. For example, the used [[software development process]] probably influences the effectiveness and efficiency of a team.

The [[personalities]] of software programmers influence the used coding styles which, in turn, influence the productivity of the programmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Links between the personalities, styles and performance in computer programming|url = http://elib.uni-stuttgart.de/opus/volltexte/2015/10315/|journal = Journal of Systems and Software|date = 2016|pages = 228–241|volume = 111|doi = 10.1016/j.jss.2015.09.011|first = Zahra|last = Karimi|first2 = Ahmad|last2 = Baraani-Dastjerdi|first3 = Nasser|last3 = Ghasem-Aghaee|first4 = Stefan|last4 = Wagner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General Manager at VivaCell-MTS==

VivaCell grew quickly and, in 2007, the company’s only shareholder, Fattouch Group, agreed to sell 80% of its shares to Mobile TeleSystems PJSC (MTS), the largest mobile operator in the Commonwealth of Independent States and Russian Federation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MTS enters Armenia|url=http://www.mtsgsm.com/news/2007-09-14-26533/|accessdate=4 July 2013|date=14 September 2009|agency=[[mtsgsm.com/]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As of today, VivaCell-MTS (MTS Armenia CJSC) shareholders are 80% MTS Russian MTS Group (Mobile TeleSystems PJSC) and 20% - Lebanese Fattouche Group. After acquisition by MTS also Ralph Yirikian stayed as the General Manager of VivaCell-MTS. Under his leadership, the Company continued striving and achieved new heights: first in Armenia 3G rollout based on UMTS/HSPA (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System / High Speed Packet Access) technology, launched on April 17, 2009, was a defining moment for the Armenian population. The introduction of 3G opened up new opportunities for the business and everyday life in the country &lt;ref&gt; {{cite news|title=VivaCell-MTS Announces The Commercial Launch Of 3G Network In Armenia|url=http://www.armeniandiaspora.com/showthread.php?166907-VivaCell-MTS-Announces-The-Commercial-Launch-Of-3G-Network-In-Armeni/|accessdate=29 May 2017|date=17 April 2009|agency=[http://www.armeniandiaspora.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Further, on the 20th of December, 2010, VivaCell-MTS launched the first 4G/LTE network in Armenia and the region &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=VivaCell-MTS launches commercial test operation of first 4G network in region|url=http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/news/58778/|accessdate=29 May 2017|date=20 December 2010|agency=[http://Panarmenian.net]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“VivaCell-MTS’ LTE roll-out positions Armenia to be one of the selected global leaders in 4G deployment. In addition, the launch of 4G is expected to present Armenia as a country with attractive communication infrastructure,” commented VivaCell-MTS General Manager Ralph Yirikian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=VivaCell-MTS Launches 4G Test Network in Armenia|url=https://ditord.com/2010/12/20/vivacell-mts-launches-4g-test-network-in-armenia/|accessdate=29 May 2017|date=20 December 2010|agency=[[The Armenian Observer Blog]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Now, VivaCell-MTS’ 4G/LTE network, which is the largest in Armenia, covers 22 towns and is available to 52.5% of the population&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Մինչև տարեվերջ Հայաստանի ամենաընդարձակ 4G ցանցը կընդգրկի 22 քաղաք|url=http://www.tert.am/am/news/2017/01/09/vivacell/2242762|accessdate=28 May 2017|date=9 January 2017|agency=[[Tert.am]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Introduction of the culture of corporate social responsibility in Armenia==

Helping the society is part of the mission of VivaCell-MTS. Due to having Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) approach institutionalized at the Company level, and ingrained in its daily operations, VivaCell-MTS has become the pioneer of the corporate sector in promoting the concept of Corporate Responsibility in Armenia. In doing this, VivaCell-MTS has adopted the slogan “VivaCell-MTS is leading by example”, by calling other business entities to make CSR an integral part of their activity also. Starting from the first day of its operation, the Company has been making considerable social investments into the implementation of innovative projects in the spheres of Information and Communication Technologies, healthcare, culture, science, children, environmental protection, sport, education, and rural infrastructure, with focus on borderland. 

՞Businesses don’t exist in a geographical or social vacuum; they are a part of society and located physically in particular communities and areas. This is in part a general civic and social responsibility towards the local communities in which business operates.

VivaCell-MTS is the first telecommunications operator in Armenia and the CIS that has successfully implemented ISO 26000 guidelines &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=VivaCell-MTS awarded for the implementation of ISO 26000 international standard of CSR|url=http://www.itel.am/en/news/5777|accessdate=28 May 2017|date=7 June 2013|agency=[[Itel.am]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In 2016, VivaCell-MTS received a certificate of awarding for the widest and most developed network, efficient work with corporate customers, rendered innovative services and guidance by social responsibility from the National Association of Consumers. On February 28, 2017, the Company was recognized as “Accessible Mobile Operator” in the framework of “Accessible places” awards by the “Armenian Camp” NGO &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=VivaCell-MTS awarded Accessible Mobile Operator prize|url=http://www.tert.am/en/news/2017/03/02/vivacell/2295373|accessdate=28 May 2017|date=2 March 2017|agency=[[Tert.am]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==New culture of management==

In the early days of VivaCell-MTS’ operation, Yirikian not only had to overcome the technical challenges of building a radio network, installing base stations in remote areas throughout the mountainous country, recruiting specialists, but he also had to battle with the remnants of Armenian business culture from the Soviet era. Yirikian explains that he urged his employees to take responsibility and make their own decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Exceptional, July–December 2010, Ernst and Young, Signaling Change, How Ralph Yirikian of VivaCell-MTS is transforming Armenia’s telecoms sector, p. 5-9&lt;/ref&gt; 

The new culture of corporate management developed at VivaCell-MTS in the course of its activity gave birth to a lecture course called “Business with a Mission”, where the experience of more than 11 years of successful operation was summarized. At the beginning, the lecture was being delivered to university students who were hosted at VivaCell-MTS under the umbrella of Open Days at VivaCell-MTS frequently organized by the Company. Ralph Yirikian has been personally lecturing for senior school children and university students, by giving them an opportunity to physically get acquainted with how the Company operates, interacts with its customers and lives as a family.

Later on, as a visiting lecturer, Ralph Yirikian was invited to numerous higher educational institutions to speak on the “Business with a Mission.” Also, based on the request by higher educational institutions, he delivers lectures on the basics of telecommunications and corporate culture

{{Business administration}}

In [[organizational studies]], '''resource management''' is the efficient and effective development of an organization's resources when they are needed. Such resources may include financial resources, inventory, human skills, production resources, or [[information technology]] (IT).

In the realm of [[project management]], processes, techniques and philosophies as to the best approach for allocating resources have been developed.  These include discussions on functional vs. cross-functional [[resource allocation]] as well as processes espoused by organizations like the [[Project Management Institute]] (PMI) through their [[Project Management Body of Knowledge]] (PMBOK) methodology of project management. Resource management is a key element to activity resource estimating and project human resource management. Both are essential components of a comprehensive project management plan to execute and monitor a project successfully.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge, Third Edition|year=2004|publisher=Project Management Institute (PMI)|location=Newtown Square, Pennsylvania|isbn=1-930699-45-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge, Fourth Edition|year=2008|publisher=Project Management Institute (PMI)|location=Newtown Square, Pennsylvania|isbn=978-1-933890-51-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; As is the case with the larger discipline of [[project management]], there are [[list of resource management software|resource management software]] tools available that automate and assist the process of resource allocation to projects and portfolio resource transparency including [[supply and demand]] of resources.  The goal of these tools typically is to ensure that: (i) there are employees within our organization with required specific [[skill set]] and desired profile required for a project, (ii) decide the number and skill sets of new employees to hire, and (iii) allocate the workforce to various projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizmerlin.com/resource_management_process.php Resource Management Process]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://meisterplan.com/project-portfolio-management/resource-management/ Resource Management Method]&lt;/ref&gt;Within professional services and consulting organizations, the effectiveness of these tools and processes is typically monitored by measuring billable [[utilization rate]].

==Corporate Resource Management Process==


Large organizations usually have a defined corporate resource management process which mainly guarantees that resources are never over-allocated across multiple projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmhut.com/modern-project-management Modern Project Management]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pdware.com/ Enterprise Resource Management]&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Drucker wrote of the need to focus resources, abandoning a less promising initiatives for every new project taken on, as fragmentation inhibits results. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Growing in Turbulent Times'|url=http://www.projectauditors.com/Papers/Growing_a_Company/Growing_in_Turbulent_Times.html |author=Frank Parth}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==

One resource management technique is [[resource leveling]]. It aims at smoothing the stock of resources on hand, reducing both excess inventories and shortages.

The required data are: the [[Demand (economics)|demand]]s for various resources, forecast by time period into the future as far as is reasonable, as well as the resources' configurations required in those demands, and the [[Supply (economics)|supply]] of the resources, again forecast by time period into the future as far as is reasonable.

The goal is to achieve 100% [[utilization]] but that is very unlikely, when weighted by important metrics and subject to constraints, for example: meeting a minimum service level, but otherwise minimizing [[cost]].  A Project Resource Allocation Matrix (PRAM) is maintained to visualize the resource allocations against various projects.

The principle is to invest in resources as stored capabilities, then unleash the capabilities as demanded.

A dimension of resource development is included in resource management by which investment in resources can be retained by a smaller additional investment to develop a new capability that is demanded, at a lower investment than disposing of the current resource and replacing it with another that has the demanded capability.

In [[Habitat conservation|conservation]], resource management is a set of practices pertaining to maintaining natural systems integrity.  Examples of this form of management are [[Air#Air pollution|air resource]] management, [[soil conservation]], [[forestry]], [[wildlife]] management and [[water resource]] management.  The broad term for this type of resource management is [[natural resource management]] (NRM).

In addition, we can use [[Ishikawa diagram]] to analyze Man, Money, Material and Machine needed.

'''Robert Louis-Dreyfus''' ({{birth date|1946|6|14|df=yes}}&amp;nbsp;– {{death date|2009|7|4|df=yes}}) was a French businessman who had major success as chief executive officer (CEO) of [[Adidas-Salomon]] and [[Saatchi &amp; Saatchi]]. He was a majority [[shareholder]] of the French [[association football|football]] team [[Olympique de Marseille]], and during his tenure they re-emerged as a major European football club.

== Early life ==
Robert Louis-Dreyfus was born in Paris, the son of Jean and Jeanne Madeline (née Depierre) Louis-Dreyfus.&lt;ref name=WhosWho&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whoswho.fr/decede/biographie-robert-louis-dreyfus_20690 |title=Biographie Robert Louis-dreyfus Président de société |website=Whoswho.fr |date= |accessdate=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LasAventures&gt;Bourdon, Jean-Claude and Jacques-Olivier Martin ''Robert Louis-Dreyfus: Les aventures d'un Don Juan des affaires'' (2007), 293 pages, {{ISBN|2-35228-003-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was [[French Jews|Jewish]] and his mother [[Roman Catholic]].&lt;ref name=ParisMatchSeigneur&gt;[http://www.parismatch.com/Actu/Economie/Robert-Louis-Dreyfus-un-seigneur-qui-voyait-loin-et-visait-haut-140512 Paris Match: "“Robert Louis-Dreyfus, un seigneur qui voyait loin et visait haut" by Jacques Veyrat] July 8, 2009 (''in French'') | ''"...cet agnostique, fils d’un juif et d’une catholique..." / "...this agnostic, the son of a Jew and a Catholic..."''&lt;/ref&gt; He was a great grandson of [[Léopold Louis-Dreyfus]], founder of the [[Louis-Dreyfus Group]], which had begun buying and selling wheat in the [[Alsace]] region a century earlier, and rapidly diversified into shipping, oil and other commodities.&lt;ref name=IndObit&gt;{{cite news | title = Obituary: Robert Louis-Dreyfus: Businessman who helped resurrect Olympique Marseille football club | author = Pierre Perrone | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/robert-louisdreyfus-businessman-who-helped-resurrect-olympique-marseille-football-club-1749706.html | format = newspaper | agency = | newspaper = The Independent | publisher = Independent News and Media Limited | location = United Kingdom | date = 17 July 2009 | page = | pages = | at = | accessdate = |trans-title=| ref = }}&lt;/ref&gt; His grandfather was [[Louis Louis-Dreyfus]], who served in the [[French Parliament]] during the [[French Third Republic]].&lt;ref name=AncienSenator&gt;{{cite web|author=Sénat français |url=http://www.senat.fr/senateur-3eme-republique/louis_dreyfus_louis0119r3.html |title=Anciens sénateurs IIIème République : LOUIS-DREYFUS Louis |website=Senat.fr |date= |accessdate=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has two sisters: Marie-Jeanne and Monique.&lt;ref name=ForbesRisingCommodity&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/luisakroll/2012/11/07/rising-commodity-prices-created-three-louis-dreyfus-billionaires/ |title=Rising Commodity Prices Created Three Louis-Dreyfus Billionaires |website=Forbes.com |date=2012-10-18 |accessdate=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Louis-Dreyfus was initially a bad student who failed his [[Baccalauréat]],&lt;ref name='FigMad' /&gt; but he excelled at poker, winning considerable amounts of money from his friends at the [[Lycée Janson de Sailly]] in Paris. In 1967, he spent time at a [[kibbutz]] and was involved in the [[Six-Day War]]. He later secured a place at [[Harvard Business School]] with a presentation about his experiences during the war.&lt;ref name=IndObit/&gt; He spent the early years of his working life mentored by [[Siegmund Warburg]], in the family business of the Louis-Dreyfus Group.

== Business career ==
In 1982 Louis-Dreyfus joined [[IMS Health|IMS]], the US pharmaceutical research company enjoying spectacular monetary success. His original {{US$|400,000}} grew twentyfold by the time the company was sold in 1988. He served as CE at [[Saatchi &amp; Saatchi]], the United Kingdom-based [[advertising agency]] from 1989 to 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/sport/904/479395/text/ |title="Mister Adidas" ist tot |publisher=Sueddeutsche.de |date= |accessdate=2010-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Louis-Dreyfus invested his own money in Saatchi and Saatchi and during his tenure the agency grew considerably.

He proved equally successful when in 1994 he took the top job at [[Adidas]], the German-based sporting goods maker. Louis-Dreyfus added to the brand by streamlining the product line and adding new companies to the group, including the [[Salomon Group|Salomon]] ski-wear and golf company in 1997. He remained CEO of Adidas until 2001, combining this position with chairmanship of [[Neuf Telecom]] with whom he served until 2004. He also served as a director of [[Neuf Cegetel]].

Robert Louis-Dreyfus re-joined the family company, [[Louis-Dreyfus Group]], in May 2000, and restructured this major commodities trading and merchandising firm.

== Sporting interests ==
In 1996 Louis-Dreyfus became the largest shareholder of [[Olympique de Marseille]], a French [[association football|football]] team who had been rocked by a match fixing scandal and relegated to the French second division. Louis-Dreyfus, with Adidas and the telecommunications company Neuf, sponsored the team; Louis-Dreyfus invested heavily in rebuilding the Marseille squad, marketing the team to the new immigrant populations in Marseille. The financial fortunes of the club improved with shirt sales rocketing. However, success, if judged purely on trophies won, eluded the club despite reaching the final of the [[UEFA Cup]] on two occasions and twice losing in the final of the [[Coupe de France]]. Olympique de Marseille also missed out on the [[Ligue 1]] title during Louis-Dreyfus's tenure, though shortly before his death they finished second to [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux]] and qualified for the group stage of the [[UEFA Champions League]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Louis-Dreyfus was also a shareholder in the Belgium football club [[Standard Liege]], and was involved in the creation of Infront Sports &amp; Media in 2002 (transition from the former KirchSport completed in February 2003) acting as the company's chairman of the board. The Swiss-based sports marketing agency was handling the media rights distribution of the [[FIFA World Cup]] in [[FIFA World Cup 2002|2002]] and [[FIFA World Cup 2006|2006]]. Today it is the marketing partner of 130 sports federations and clubs.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

== FIFA World Cup bribery scandal ==
In October 2015 the German news magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' reported that the bidding committee for the [[FIFA World Cup 2006]] had set-up a slush fund that Louis-Dreyfus, at the time CEO of Adidas, filled with 10.3 million Swiss francs in 2000. Allegedly these funds were used to bribe FIFA officials and secure Germany's bid to host the 2006 World Cup, whilst a FIFA report had strongly criticised England's 'unprofessional' bid presentation. According to internal FIFA documents, Louis-Dreyfus demanded a repayment of the funds in 2004, which were transferred as €6.7 million via a FIFA account in Geneva to an account held by Louis-Dreyfus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/sport/fussball/fussball-wm-2006-wurde-mutmasslich-gekauft-a-1057829.html |title=Fifa Fußball-WM 2006 mutmaßlich vom DFB gekauft - SPIEGEL ONLINE |website=Spiegel.de |date=2015-10-16 |accessdate=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
Louis-Dreyfus died in [[Zürich]] aged 63 on 4 July 2009, following a long period with [[leukemia]].&lt;ref name="si20090704"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090706152007/http://www.thestar.com.my/sports/story.asp?file=%2F2009%2F7%2F5%2Fsports%2F20090705084908&amp;sec=sports ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="afp20090704"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iw3f9ws4Op4WNBr2ZE-YburduAwQ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130111110750/http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iw3f9ws4Op4WNBr2ZE-YburduAwQ |archivedate=2013-01-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life==
Louis-Dreyfus was married twice. After divorcing his first wife, Sarah Oberholzer,&lt;ref name=WhosWho /&gt; in 1989, he met his second wife [[Margarita Louis-Dreyfus|Margarita Bogdanova]], whom he married in 1992 and with whom he had three sons:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://madame.lefigaro.fr/societe/margarita-louis-dreyfus-tsarine-affaires-270713-440620 |title=Margarita Louis-Dreyfus, la tsarine des affaires - Madame Figaro |language=fr |website=Madame.lefigaro.fr |date= |accessdate=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eric, Maurice, and Kyril.&lt;ref name=WhosWho /&gt; Louis-Dreyfus identified as an [[agnostic]].&lt;ref name=ParisMatchSeigneur /&gt; Actress [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] is his cousin.

==History==
Ships' articles developed as part of the Law Merchant (''[[Lex mercatoria]]''). Early trading vessels were often cooperative efforts where the crew, or some members, contributed to the initial costs of ship, cargo and operations; and payment was in shares at the end of the voyage.  Thus all members of a crew were considered participants in the enterprise, even if they only contributed labour.&lt;ref name="Hayes"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayes |first=Peter |year=2008 |title=Pirates, Privateers and the Contract Theories of Hobbes and Locke |journal=History of Political Thought |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=461–484 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This became widely recognized under the legal concept of a "community of joint hands" (''Gesamthand'' in [[German language|German]], ''comunidad in mano'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]).

Early ship's articles were not written, as few were literate.&lt;ref name="Maclachian" /&gt; But by the eighteenth century most sailors expected the articles to be written, even if they themselves could not read. Finally in the 1800s legislation in many countries required that ships' articles be written down, and freely available to any ensigned sailor.&lt;ref name="Maclachian" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cooper |first= Alastair |year=2012 |chapter=Perceptions and Attitudes of Seafarers Towards Maritime Regulations: An Historical Perspective |editor-last=Chircop |editor-first=Aldo |display-editors=etal |title=The Regulation of International Shipping: International and Comparative Perspectives |location=Leiden |publisher=Brill |pages=427–442 |isbn=978-90-04-20244-3 |doi=10.1163/9789004202443_021 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Privateers and pirates===
{{main|Pirate code}}
In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the ship's articles of privateers and pirates evolved into an authority independent of the laws of any nation. Although there was no uniformity among such articles, there were common themes that came to be known as "the pirates' code" or "Jamaica discipline".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|editor-last1=Dear |editor-first1=Ian C. B. |editor-last2=Kemp |editor-first2=Peter |year=2005 |title=Jamaica discipline |encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to Ships and the Sea |edition=second |series=Oxford Reference Collection |location=Oxford, England |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-860616-1 |url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100016656}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compensation==
In addition to monetary payments, seamen on ships traditionally received housing (berth), board (food and provisions), medical care ([[ship's doctor]]),&lt;ref&gt;''Further, the issue of failure to treat is one peculiar to the crew members, bound by ship's articles and their dangerous work at sea to seek from their superiors prompt relief from duty and proper medical attention, hospitalization and nursing care.'' {{Cite journal|last=Klonsky |first=Robert |year=1952 |title=The Uncharted Course of Maritime Law |journal=NACCA Law Journal |publisher=National Association of Claimants' Compensation Attorneys |pages=145–150 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes things like laundry services or an alcohol allowance. This as often expressed in the ship's articles as so much "a month and found".&lt;ref&gt;'' A sailor comes aft to take mate's place, cabin-boy goes for'ard to take sailor's place, and you take the cabin-boy's place, sign the articles for the cruise, twenty dollars per month and found.'' {{Cite book|last=London |first=Jack |year=1904 |chapter=Chapter 3 |title=The Sea Wolf |title-link=The Sea-Wolf |location=New York |publisher=Macmillan }} available at [http://london.sonoma.edu/Writings/SeaWolf/chapter3.html The Sea Wolf, Chapter 3]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kimsey |first=William E. |display-authors=etal |chapter=$45 a Month and "Found" |year=1952 |title=50 Years of Progress |publisher=Bureau of Labor, State of Oregon |page=7 |url=http://www.oregon.gov/boli/docs/BOLI_History_50_Years_of_Progress.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911112849/http://www.oregon.gov/boli/docs/BOLI%20History%2050%20Years%20of%20Progress.pdf |archive-date=11 September 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
Ship’s articles are considered part of a "ship's papers", which constitute the legal environment aboard ship.&lt;ref name="State" /&gt;  They are required in resolving disputes between seamen and their captains, as well as between seamen and the ship's and cargo's owners.&lt;ref name="Berger" /&gt;&lt;ref name="State" /&gt; They are presented to port authorities and foreign consular officials to establish the ''[[bona fides]]'' of a ship.&lt;ref name="State" /&gt;

The '''Thomson Reuters/PayNet Small Business Lending Index''' (SBLI) is an [[economic indicator]] from [[Thomson Reuters Indices]] and PayNet Inc. Because small businesses generally respond to changes in economic conditions more rapidly than larger businesses do, the Thomson Reuters/PayNet Small Business Lending Index serves as a [[leading indicator]] of the economy.

The index, utilizing [[small business]] loan origination data from major lenders, measures the volume of loans to Small Businesses normalized to a base year - 2005. Seasonally adjusted, the index is presented as an absolute as well as by a percent change versus the prior year.  
It is published monthly as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! width="200pt"|PRELIMINARY data
for current value reflecting most recent small business lending activity released 
! width="200pt"|REVISED data
for month preceding Preliminary released
! width="200pt"|FINAL data
for month preceding Revised released
|-
|}

The index has its highest correlation with GDP change as a leading indicator, leading between 2 and 5 months in advance. The index undergoes periodic checks to examine the accuracy of the estimates over time.{{cn|date=September 2015}}

== Methodology ==
All data is collected by PayNet, Inc. PayNet collects real-time loan information from more than 350 leading U.S. lenders. Its proprietary database encompasses over 19 million current and historic contracts worth over $1.5 trillion. 

PayNet primarily collects data from small business lenders in the United States, conducts research and analysis, develops and implements estimation methodologies and disseminates statistics to customers. Because PayNet receives its source data over time, estimates are routinely revised to reflect more complete source data. Preliminary and Revised estimates are reported as calculated without any reference to previously reported estimates for the same month. In addition, PayNet undertakes periodic studies that examine the accuracy of the estimates over time and for the existence of any systemic overstatement or understatement.

'''Space industry of Russia''' consists of over 100 companies and employs 250,000 people.&lt;ref name="mdb"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ionin|first=Andrey|title=Russia’s Space Program in 2006: Some Progress but No Clear Direction|journal=[[Moscow Defense Brief]]|publisher=[[Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies]]|issue=2(#8)|url=http://mdb.cast.ru/mdb/2-2007/item1/item3/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Russia's space industry companies are descendants of Soviet design bureaus and state production companies. The industry entered a deep crisis after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], which peaked in the last years of the 1990s. Funding of the space program declined by 80% and the industry lost a large part of its work force, until recovery begun in the early 2000s. Many companies survived by creating joint-ventures with foreign companies and marketing their products abroad. 

In the mid-2000s, in wave of the general improvement in the economy, funding of the country's space program was substantially increased and a new ambitious federal space plan was introduced, resulting in a great improvement in the industry. The largest company of the industry is [[S.P. Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energia|RKK Energiya]], the main manned space flight contractor. Leading launch vehicle producers are [[Khrunichev]] and [[Progress State Research and Production Rocket Space Center|TsSKB-Progress]]. Largest satellite developer is [[JSC Information Satellite Systems|ISS Reshetnev]], while [[NPO Lavochkin]] is the main developer of interplanetary probes.

{{asof|2013}}, a major reorganization of the Russian space industry is underway, with increased state supervision and involvement of the ostensibly private companies formed in the early 1990s following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].

== History ==

=== Post-Soviet adjustments ===
[[File:Mir on 12 June 1998edit1.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Mir]] space station in 1998]]
The space industry of the [[Soviet Union]] was a formidable, capable and well-funded complex, which scored a number of great successes. Spending on the [[Soviet space program|space program]] peaked in 1989, when its budget totaled 6.9 billion rubles, amounting to 1.5% of the Soviet Union's gross domestic product.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, pp.7-8&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[perestroika]] period of the late 1980s, the space program's funding began to decrease, and this was seriously accelerated by the economic hardships of the 1990s. The [[Russian Federation]] inherited the major part of the infrastructure and companies of the Soviet program (while others, such as [[Yuzhnoye Design Bureau]], became [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]]), but found itself unable to continue the appropriate level of financing. By 1998, the space program's funding had been cut by 80%.

To coordinate the country's space activities, on 25 February 1992, the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] was created. During Soviet times, there had been no central agency; instead, the design bureaus had been very powerful. To an extent, this continued during the first years of the agency, which suffered from a lack of authority while the design bureaus fought to survive in the difficult environment.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, p.281-282&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The crisis years ===
In 1993, the most prestigious program of the industry, the [[Buran space shuttle]], was canceled. It had been worked on for 20 years by the industry's best companies, and the cancellation immediately resulted in a 30% reduction in the industry's work force. 300,000 people worked in the industry at the end of 1994,&lt;ref name="harvey_p8"&gt;Harvey, p.8&lt;/ref&gt; down from 400,000 in 1987,&lt;ref name="harvey_p6"&gt;Harvey, p.6&lt;/ref&gt; and the space program's funding now amounted to just 0.23% of the country's budget.&lt;ref name="harvey_p8"/&gt;

The final phase of the space program's contradiction took place during the [[1998 Russian financial crisis]]. Much of the budgeted money never arrived at the companies. The space industry continued to shed work force, and soon only 100,000 people remained. Wages were also cut: for example at the leading rocket engine producer [[NPO Energomash]], the average monthly salary during this time was 3,000 rubles ($104).&lt;ref name="harvey_p9"&gt;Harvey, p.9&lt;/ref&gt; The space industry's physical infrastructure declined greatly, and this was symbolised by a roof collapse in 2001 at the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] which destroyed the Buran shuttle which had flown the one and only flight of the program in 1988. No funds were available to look after the shuttle's hangar in Baikonur and it collapsed on the shuttle in May 2002.&lt;ref name="harvey_p9"/&gt;

==== Foreign partnerships ====
[[File:P42345701.jpg|thumb|right|Entrance to [[Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center]] in [[Moscow]]. Since 1994, Khrunichev's [[Proton-M]] rocket has earned Russia's space industry $4.3 billion.]]
During the crisis years, of the main ways for the industry's companies to survive was to look for foreign partnerships. In this respect, [[Khrunichev]] was particularly successful. On 15 April 1993 Khrunichev created the Lockheed-Khrunichev-Energia joint venture with the American company [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]]. In 1995, due to the merger of [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] and [[Martin Marietta]], it was transformed into [[International Launch Services]] (ILS). The joint venture marketed launches on both the [[Proton (rocket)|Proton]] and the American [[Atlas (rocket)|Atlas]] rockets. The [[United States]] had given permission for the appearance of Proton on the international launch market, but introduced a quota to protect the launch market from "Russian dumping." Despite this, the Proton, built by Khrunichev, was successful and by the end of 2000 had earned launch contracts worth over $1.5 billion.&lt;ref name="kirillov"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://mdb.cast.ru/mdb/3-2002/mas/kclrss/ |title=Khrunichev Center - Leader of the Russian Space Sector |last1=Kirillov |first1=Vladimir |journal=Eksport Vooruzheniy |publisher=[[Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies]] |issue=3 |year=2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tkLDiTX3?url=http://mdb.cast.ru/mdb/3-2002/mas/kclrss/ |archivedate=October 25, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1994, the Proton has earned $4.3 billion for the Russian space industry as a whole, and in 2011 this figure is expected to raise to $6 billion.&lt;ref name="nesterov"&gt;[http://www.khrunichev.ru/main.php?id=1&amp;nid=581 Statement by Vladimir Ye.Nesterov, Khrunichev Director-General, at Press Conference on 15 July 2010] Khruhichev 2010-07-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another successful company was [[Energomash]], whose extremely powerful [[RD-180]] engine was installed on American [[Atlas V]] rockets. The rocket's manufacturer [[Lockheed Martin]] initially bought 101 RD-180 engines from Energomash, earning the company $1 billion in hard currency.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, p.197&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New federal space plan ===
[[File:CeBit 2011 - Glosnass-K Satellite Model 11.jpg|thumb|right|A [[GLONASS-K]] satellite, produced by [[Reshetnev Information Satellite Systems]]]]
In the early 2000s, during [[Vladimir Putin]]'s presidency, the Russian economy started recovering, growing more each year than in all of the previous decade. The funding outlook for Russia's space program started to look more favourable. 

In 2001, the development of the [[GLONASS]] satellite navigation system was made a government priority with the introduction of a new Federal Targeted Program.&lt;ref name="moskvitch"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8595704.stm|title=Glonass: Has Russia's sat-nav system come of age?|publisher=BBC News|date=2010-04-02|first=Katia|last=Moskvitch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main contractor for GLONASS, [[NPO PM]] (later renamed ISS Reshetnev), thus received a boost in its finances. In total, 4.8 billion rubles was allocated for the space program in 2001, of which 1.6 billion was earmarked for GLONASS.&lt;ref name="harvey_p284"&gt;Harvey, p.284&lt;/ref&gt; By 2004, Russia's space spending had grown to 12 billion rubles. In 2005, a new strategy for the development of the country's space program, titled the Federal Space Plan 2006-2015, was approved. It stipulated the completion of the [[International Space Station]], development of the [[Angara rocket family]], introduction of a new manned spacecraft and completion of the GLONASS constellation, among others.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, p.317&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-2000s, funding of the space program continued to improve substantially, amounting to 21.59 billion rubles in 2005 and rising to 23 billion rubles in 2006. In 2007, 24.4 billion rubles was spent on the civilian space program, while the military space program's budget was 11 billion rubles. The industry also continued to receive very substantial funds from exports and foreign partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, p.285&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[Dmitry Medvedev]]'s presidency, space technology was named of the key areas of the country's [[Medvedev modernisation programme|modernisation programme]]. Spending increased to 82 billion rubles ($2.4 billion) in 2009.&lt;ref name="rian_budget"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20090318/120627935.html|title=No cut in Russian 2009 space spending, $2.4 bln on 3 programs|date=2009-03-18|publisher=RIA Novosti|accessdate=2009-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the government is planning to spend 115 billion rubles ($3.8 bln) in the national space programs.&lt;ref name="rian_budget2011"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20110111/162102586.html|title=Russia allocates $3.8 bln for space programs in 2011|publisher=RIA Novosti|date=2011-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2013 reorganization of the Russian space sector===
As a result of a series of reliability problems, and proximate to the failure of a July 2013 [[Proton M]] launch, a major reorganization of the Russian space industry was undertaken. The [[United Rocket and Space Corporation]] was formed as a [[Joint-stock company|joint-stock]] corporation by the [[Government of Russia|government]] in August 2013 to consolidate the Russian [[spaceflight|space]] sector.  Deputy Prime Minister [[Dmitry Rogozin]] said "the failure-prone space sector is so troubled that it needs state supervision to overcome its problems."&lt;ref name=pa20130830&gt;
{{cite news |last=Messier|first=Doug |title=Rogozin: Russia to Consolidate Space Sector into Open Joint Stock Company |url=http://www.parabolicarc.com/2013/08/30/rogozin-interview-kommersant/ |accessdate=2013-09-01 |newspaper=Parabolic Arc |date=2013-08-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Three days following the Proton M launch failure, the Russian government had announced that "extremely harsh measures" would be taken "and spell the end of the [Russian] space industry as we know it."&lt;ref name=rbth20130703&gt;
{{cite news |last=Nilolaev|first=Ivan |title=Rocket failure to lead to space industry reform |url=http://rbth.ru/science_and_tech/2013/07/03/rocket_failure_to_lead_to_space_industry_reform_27729.html |accessdate=2013-09-01 |newspaper=Russia Behind The Headlines |date=2013-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preliminary information indicates that the government intends to reorganize in such a way as to "preserve and enhance the [[Roscosmos]] space agency."&lt;ref name=pa20130830/&gt;

== Structure of the industry ==
[[File:Soyuz TMA-9 launch.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Soyuz-FG]] rocket launching a [[Soyuz-TMA]] spacecraft. Soyuz-FG is produced by [[TsSKB Progress]], while Soyuz-TMA is made by [[RKK Energia]]]]
The largest company of Russia's space industry is [[RKK Energiya]]. It is the country's main human spaceflight contractor, the lead developer of the [[Soyuz-TMA]] and [[Progress (spacecraft)|Progress]] spacecraft and the Russian end of the [[International Space Station]]. It employs around 22,000-30,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, p.268&lt;/ref&gt; [[Progress State Research and Production Rocket Space Center]] (TsSKB Progress) is the developer and producer of the famous [[Soyuz (rocket)|Soyuz]] launch vehicle. The [[Soyuz-FG]] version is used to launch manned spacecraft, while the international joint-venture [[Starsem]] markets commercial satellite launches on the other versions. TsSKB Progress is currently leading the development of a new launcher called [[Rus-M]], which is to replace the Soyuz. Moscow-based [[Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center]] is one of the commercially most successful companies of the space industry. It is the developer of the [[Proton-M]] rocket and the [[Fregat]] upper stage. The company's new [[Angara (rocket family)|Angara rocket family]] is expected to be put into service 2013. The largest satellite manufacturer in Russia is [[Reshetnev Information Satellite Systems|ISS Reshetnev]] (formerly called NPO PM). It is main contractor for the [[GLONASS]] [[Satellite navigation|satellite navigation program]] and produces the [[Ekspress]] series of communications satellites. The company is located in [[Zheleznogorsk, Krasnoyarsk Krai|Zheleznogorsk]], [[Krasnoyarsk Krai]], and employs around 6,500 people. The leading rocket engine company is [[NPO Energomash]], designer and producer of the famous [[RD-180]] engine. In electric spacecraft propulsion, [[OKB Fakel]], located in [[Kaliningrad Oblast]], is one of the top companies. [[NPO Lavochkin]] is Russia's main planetary probe designer. It is responsible for the high-profile [[Fobos-Grunt]] mission, Russia's first attempt at an interplanetary probe since [[Mars 96]].

==Environmental impact==
Critics claim that Proton rocket fuel ([[unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine]] (UDMH)) and debris created by Russia's space programme is poisoning areas of Russia and [[Kazakhstan]]. Clusters of cancers have been found in the [[Republic of Altai]]&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-19127713 | title=Russians say space rocket debris is health hazard | publisher=BBC | accessdate=August 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and residents claim that [[acid rain]] falls after some launches. [[Anatoly Kuzin]], deputy director of the [[Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center]], has denied these claims, saying: "We did special research into the issue. The level of acidity in the atmosphere is not affected by the rocket launches [and] there is no data to prove any link between the illnesses [in Altai] and the influence of rocket fuel components or space activity of any kind".&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

The '''Traditionalist Worker Party''' ('''TWP''') was a [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]], [[White nationalism|white nationalist]] group based in the United States. Established in 2013 by Matthew Heimbach under the name '''Traditionalist Youth Network''' ('''TYN'''), the group promotes [[white separatism]] and a [[White supremacy|white supremacist]] view of Christianity. Part of the neo-Nazi [[Nationalist Front (United States)|Nationalist Front]], the TWP has held a number of protests and other local events. Since 2015, the group also operated as a political party to run in elections for local office.

In April 2018, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that the TWP had been disbanded the previous month after group leader Matthew Heimbach's arrest for battery and his falling out with co-founder Matt Parrott.&lt;ref name=disarray&gt;McCoy Terrence (April 20, 2018) [https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/social-issues/imploding-lawsuits-fundraising-troubles-trailer-park-brawls-has-the-alt-right-peaked/2018/04/20/0a2fb786-39a6-11e8-9c0a-85d477d9a226_story.html?wpisrc=nl_rainbow&amp;wpmm=1 "‘Imploding’: Financial troubles.

==History==
===Traditionalist Youth Network===
The Traditionalist Youth Network was established in May 2013 by Matthew Heimbach and Matt Parrott.&lt;ref name="ADLProfile"/&gt; Heimbach has been a white supremacist activist since fall 2011, when he formed a group at [[Towson University]] in [[Maryland]] and invited the white supremacist [[Jared Taylor]] to speak at Towson's campus. The following year, Heimbach founded a "[[White Student Union (Towson University)|White Student Union]]" on campus, adopting racist and [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] views.&lt;ref name="ADLProfile"&gt;[http://www.adl.org/combating-hate/domestic-extremism-terrorism/c/traditionalist-youth-network.html Traditionalist Youth Network], [[Anti-Defamation League]] (February 7, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; In spring 2013, upon graduation, Heimbach established the Traditionalist Youth Network in partnership with Parrot, who founded a white supremacist group, Hoosier Nation, in [[Indiana]] around 2009.&lt;ref name="ADLProfile"/&gt; The group eventually became a chapter of [[American Third Position]] (later known as the [[American Freedom Party]]).&lt;ref name="ADLProfile"/&gt;

===Traditionalist Worker Party===
The [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (SPLC), which tracks [[Extremism|extremist]] groups, has [[List of organizations designated by the Southern Poverty Law Center as hate groups|designated]] the Traditionalist Worker Party as a [[hate group]] and has written of Heimbach: "Considered by many to be the face of a new generation of white nationalists... Since graduating in the spring of 2013, he has entrenched himself further in the white nationalist movement and become a regular speaker on the radical-right lecture circuit."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/matthew-heimbach|title=Matthew Heimbach|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center|access-date=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015 the TYN established the Traditionalist Worker Party (TWP) as its [[political party|political-party]] offshoot in preparation for the 2016 elections, and a small group of candidates from the [[far right]] announced plans to run under its banner.&lt;ref name="Hankes"/&gt; The party states that it stands against "economic exploitation, federal tyranny, and anti-Christian degeneracy".&lt;ref name="Hankes"/&gt; The group's strategy differs from that of the [[American Freedom Party]] (AFP), a different fringe group: while the AFP "has long run presidential candidates with no hope of success" in order to "exploit the election cycle as a way to raise money and generate publicity for their racist positions, TWP actually hopes to win by running for local offices in small communities."&lt;ref name="Hankes"/&gt;

===Nationalist Front===
{{Main|Nationalist Front (United States)}}
On April 22, 2016, the Traditionalist Worker Party formed a coalition with several other organizations called the Aryan Nationalist Alliance. The Aryan Nationalist Alliance later changed its name to [[Nationalist Front (United States)|Nationalist Front]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Viets|first1=Sarah|title=Nationalist Front Chumming up to Klan Members Once Again|url=https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2017/05/30/nationalist-front-chumming-klan-members-once-again|website=Southern Poverty Law Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its aim was to unite white supremacist, [[neo-Confederate]], and white nationalist groups under a common umbrella. The coalition was joined by the neo-Nazi [[National Socialist Movement (United States)|National Socialist Movement]] (NSM), neo-confederate [[League of the South]], the neo-Nazi [[Vanguard America]], and four other groups.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2017/nationalist-front-limps-2017 "Nationalist Front Limps in 2016"], ''Intelligence Report'', [[Southern Poverty Law Center]], August 08, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Natalie Allison (Oct. 25, 2017): [https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/10/25/groups-behind-white-lives-matter/798600001/ "4 extremist groups that will be part of weekend's White Lives Matter rallies"], ''[[USA Today]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, the group organized the white supremacist rally in [[Pikeville, Kentucky]] which attracted 100 to 125 supporters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.adl.org/blog/white-supremacist-nationalist-front-plans-rallies-in-tennessee "White Supremacist Nationalist Front Plans Rallies in Tennessee"], [[Anti-Defamation League]] blog, October 24, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2017, the affiliated groups participated in the [[Unite the Right rally]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;Jack Smith IV (Oct. 11, 2017): [https://mic.com/articles/185130/white-nationalist-alliance-plans-white-lives-matter-rally-for-tennessee#.TLWr3ii3l "White nationalist alliance plans “White Lives Matter” rally for Tennessee"], ''[[Mic (media company)|Mic.com]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2017, the Nationalist Front was a key organizer of the "White Lives Matter" rally in [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]] and [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee]]. Participating groups included: NSM, TWP, League of the South, Vanguard America, [[The Right Stuff (blog)|The Right Stuff]], and [[Anti-Communist Action]].&lt;ref&gt;Mariah Timms and Natalie Allison (Oct. 27, 2017): [http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2017/10/27/white-lives-matter-rally-murfreesboro-tn-shelbyville-what-to-know/806029001/ "White Lives Matter Murfreesboro rally: What we know now"], ''[[The Tennessean]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2017/10/24/far-right-returns-middle-tennessee "The far right returns to middle Tennessee"], ''[[Hatewatch]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internal conflict and disbandment===
On March 13, 2018, Heimbach was arrested in [[Paoli, Indiana]] on charges of [[domestic battery]] arising from an alleged attack against spokesman Parrott and Heimbach's wife, who was also Parrott's stepdaughter. Following this, Parrott shut down the TWP's websites and said he planned to delete membership data, citing privacy concerns. According to Parrott, the TWP no longer existed, as the incident had destroyed the group's credibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weill|first1=Kelly|title=Neo-Nazi Group Implodes Over Love Triangle Turned Trailer Brawl|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/matthew-heimbachs-traditional-workers-party-implodes-over-love-triangle-turned-trailer-brawl|accessdate=14 March 2018|work=The Daily Beast|date=14 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barrouquere|first1=Brett|last2=Janik|first2=Rachel|title=TWP chief Matthew Heimbach arrested for battery after affair with top spokesman's wife|url=https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2018/03/13/twp-chief-matthew-heimbach-arrested-battery-after-affair-top-spokesmans-wife|accessdate=14 March 2018|work=Hatewatch|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center|date=13 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fischer|first1=Jordan|title=Indiana white nationalist leader Matthew Heimbach charged with domestic battery|url=https://www.theindychannel.com/news/local-news/crime/indiana-white-nationalist-leader-matthew-heimbach-charged-with-domestic-battery|accessdate=14 March 2018|work=RTV6|agency=ABC News|date=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Days later, however, Parrott filed a [[Declaration (law)|sworn declaration]] in court (in an ongoing federal civil lawsuit over the [[Unite the Right rally]] in 2017), stating that he had not deleted or destroyed the membership information, as it was relevant to the ongoing litigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barrouquere|first1=Brett|title=Lawyer: Traditionalist Worker Party membership roll still exists, despite Matt Parrott's vow to destroy database|work=Hatewatch|url=https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2018/03/27/lawyer-traditionalist-worker-party-membership-roll-still-exists-despite-matt-parrott%E2%80%99s-vow|date=March 27, 2018|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==

Heimbach and his group advocate [[white separatism]], and the group also adheres to a [[white nationalist]] and [[white supremacist]] [[ideology]].&lt;ref name="ADLProfile"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heim"&gt;Joe Heim, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/this-white-nationalist-who-shoved-a-trump-protester-may-be-the-next-david-duke/2016/04/12/7e71f750-f2cf-11e5-89c3-a647fcce95e0_story.html This white nationalist who shoved a Trump protester may be the next David Duke], ''Washington Post'' (April 12, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-36637376 Clashes at white-supremacist rally in Sacramento leave 10 injured], BBC News (June 27, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Heimbach and Parrott are "self-declared [[Ethnic nationalism|ethnonationalists]]"&lt;ref name="VietsLenz"&gt;Sarah Viets &amp; Ryan Lenz, [https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2016/07/11/matt-heimbach%E2%80%99s-traditionalist-youth-network-cutting-deals-holocaust-deniers Matt Heimbach's Traditionalist Youth Network is Cutting Deals with Holocaust Deniers], ''Hatewatch'', Southern Poverty Law Center (July 11, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; who aim to create a [[White separatism|separate white ethnostate]].&lt;ref name="Bavis"/&gt; The group specifically promotes a white supremacist interpretation of Christianity,&lt;ref name="ADLProfile"/&gt; recruiting members to battle what it terms "anti-Christian degeneracy."&lt;ref name="Schuppe"&gt;Jon Schuppe, [http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/garrulous-polite-white-nationalist-behind-violent-california-rally-n599731l 'Garrulous and Polite': The White Nationalist Behind Violent California Rally], NBC News (June 27, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; The group supports the prohibition of [[abortion]], restrictions on [[immigration]], and ultimately the carrying out of what Heimbach describes as "peaceful secessionist projects."&lt;ref name="Bavis"/&gt; Heimbach has been described in media reports as an "[[alt-right]] personality".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[Daily Progress]]|title=City plans alternate events, urges ignoring Klan rally|date=June 20, 2017|url=http://www.dailyprogress.com/news/city-plans-alternate-events-urges-ignoring-klan-rally/article_2d77bef2-561a-11e7-9202-7fbf90d823a7.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SPLC describes the group's ideology as being "virulently [[Racism|racist]] and [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]]."&lt;ref name="Hankes"&gt;Keegan Hankes, [https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2015/10/19/meet-new-wave-extremists-gearing-2016-elections Meet the New Wave of Extremists Gearing Up for the 2016 Elections], Southern Poverty Law Center (October 19, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Both the SPLC and the [[Anti-Defamation League]] note that the group is modeled after the European [[Identitarian movement]].&lt;ref name="Hankes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ADLProfile"/&gt; The TWP proclaims itself to be "against [[modernism]], [[individualism]], [[globalism]] and [[Marxism]]."&lt;ref name="ADLProfile"/&gt; The group identifies itself as an [[anti-capitalist]] organization and it connects this position to its advocacy of [[nationalism]] stating "For us, to be anti-capitalist is to be a nationalist. Nationalism is a bulwark against [[Exploitation of labour|capitalist exploitation]] and globalism."&lt;ref name="Bavis"&gt;Lauren Bavis, [http://www.heraldtimesonline.com/free_access/white-nationalist-group-seeks-to-form-separate-community-in-paoli/article_3eeb5b4e-b8d1-11e6-954e-535619a8e007.html White nationalist group seeks to form separate community in Paoli], ''The Herald-Times'' (December 4, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Heimbach hailed the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|British vote to leave the European Union]] as "the greatest European nationalist victory since 1933," the [[1933 in Germany|year of the Nazi rise to power]] in Germany.&lt;ref name="Schuppe"/&gt; In 2016, the TWP and the ''[[Barnes Review]]'', a [[Holocaust denial]] publication, announced a partnership to promote each other.&lt;ref name="VietsLenz"/&gt;

==Organization and activities==
Traditionalist Youth Networks's only active university chapter is at the [[Indiana University Bloomington]]; this group is led by a white-supremacist activist Thomas Buhls, who has been affiliated with the [[Harrison, Arkansas]]-based Knights Party, a [[Ku Klux Klan|Klan]] group.&lt;ref name="ADLProfile"/&gt; In December 2016, the group's founder Heimbach claimed that it had some three dozen active chapters and 500 members across the United States; analysts at the Southern Poverty Law Center and Anti-Defamation League state that these numbers are likely exaggerated.&lt;ref name="Bavis"/&gt; The SPLC's 2017 annual report identifies the TWP as having chapters in [[Paoli, Indiana|Paoli]] and [[Bloomington, Indiana]]; [[Benson, North Carolina]], and [[Wisconsin]], and the affiliated Traditionalist Worker Party as having chapters in Paoli and [[Columbus, Indiana]]; [[Sacramento, California]]; [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], [[Madisonville, Kentucky|Madisonville]], and [[Murray, Kentucky]]; [[Kansas]]; [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]; [[Dallas, Texas]]; and Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Begley,

In August 2013 the group protested a leftist bookstore in [[Bloomington, Indiana]]; in October 2013, the group held rallies protesting campus speeches by anti-racist educator [[Tim Wise]].&lt;ref name="ADLProfile"/&gt;

In September 2013 the group, as Traditionalist Youth Network, held an event in [[Corunna, Michigan]] in support of [[President of Syria|Syrian president]] [[Bashar al-Assad]]'s government.&lt;ref name="Ridley"&gt;{{cite web|author= Gary Ridley|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2013/09/group_with_alleged_ties_to_whi.html|title= Group with alleged ties to white supremacist movement plans Syria protest in Corunna|publisher= [[MLive]]|date= September 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group initially planned as a "Koran BBQ" that would feature the [[Book burning|burning]] of copies of the [[Qur'an]] and pictures of [[Muhammad]] to show "Islamic immigrants and citizens alike that they are not welcome here in Michigan", but changed to a pro-Assad protest after the U.S. government announced its plans to support [[Free Syrian Army|Syrian rebels]].&lt;ref name="Ridley"/&gt; Heimbach told [[MLive]] that he did not regret the group's original plan and that the group supported Islam "when it's in its own home in the Middle East."&lt;ref name="Ridley"/&gt;

In 2014 the group filed an [[amicus brief]] in a [[United States federal courts|federal court]] in Michigan in the case of ''[[DeBoer v. Snyder]]''. In its brief, the group took a stance against [[same-sex marriage]], which Parrott described as part of "the Leftists [sic] social engineering campaign to destroy every last vestige of Western civilization."&lt;ref&gt;Ryan Lenz, [https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2014/03/26/traditionalist-youth-network-takes-culture-distorters-marriage-equality-debate Traditionalist Youth Network Takes on 'Culture Distorters' in Marriage Equality Debate], Southern Poverty Law Center (March 26, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Later the same year, the group filed a second amicus brief in a case in Maryland challenging a [[Gun laws in Maryland|law prohibiting assault weapons]]; in a four-page filing, the TYN stated that it opposed "the enemy of freedom—the Culture Distorter—in its sights and wishes to shoot down unconstitutional legislation that disarms our people".&lt;ref&gt;Hatewatch Staff, [https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2014/10/08/traditionalist-youth-network-files-another-amicus-brief Traditionalist Youth Network Files Another Amicus Brief], Southern Poverty Law Center (October 8, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015 the group called for the filing of hate-crime charges in connection with the beating of a white man in [[Fountain Square, Cincinnati]]. The local prosecutor, [[Hamilton County, Ohio|Hamilton County]] Prosecutor [[Joe Deters]], stated that there was no evidence of ethnic intimidation in the crime.&lt;ref name="fountain"&gt;{{cite web|author= Michael Baldwin|url= http://www.fox19.com/story/29549752/do-white-lives-matter-group-wants-prosecutor-to-seek-stronger-charge-in-fountain-square-attack|title= Do "White lives matter?"

At a March 2016 [[Donald Trump]] rally at the [[Kentucky International Convention Center]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]],&lt;ref name="Hensley"&gt;Nicole Hensley, [http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/matthew-heimbach-trump-authority-remove-ky-protester-article-1.3067679 Matthew Heimbach claims he acted on Trump's 'get ’em out of here' order to remove protester at Louisville rally], ''New York Daily News'' (April 18, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Heimbach was caught on film shoving a black woman who was protesting Trump.&lt;ref name="Heim"/&gt; Heimbach and two other men was initially charged with misdemeanor harassment with physical contact and was served with a criminal summons in April 2017.&lt;ref name="NovellyGlowicki"&gt;Thomas Novelly &amp; Matthew Glowicki, [http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/crime/2017/07/19/white-nationalist-pleads-guilty-harassment-charge-trump-rally/492219001/ White nationalist pleads guilty to disorderly conduct at Trump rally in Louisville], ''Courier Journal'' (July 19, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; The charge was later amended to second-degree [[disorderly conduct]]; in June 2017, Heimbach entered an [[Alford plea|''Alford'' plea]], a form of guilty plea.&lt;ref name="NovellyGlowicki"/&gt; Heimbach was fined $145, was ordered to attend anger management classes, and was sentenced to 90 days in jail; the jail sentence was [[Suspended sentence|suspended]] on the condition that Heimbach not commit another crime within two years.&lt;ref name="NovellyGlowicki"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/news/white-nationalist-leader-pleads-guilty-in-trump-rally-case/ White nationalist leader pleads guilty in Trump rally case], Associated Press (July 20, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, after Heimbach was charged with misdemeanor battery and felony domestic battery in Indiana in a separate case, Heimbach's probation in the Kentucky case was revoked and he was sent to jail for 38 days.&lt;ref&gt;Jason Riley, [http://www.wdrb.com/story/38193191/white-nationalist-who-harassed-woman-at-trump-rally-ordered-to-serve-38-days-in-jail White nationalist who harassed woman at Trump rally ordered to serve 38 days in jail], WDRB (May 15, 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

In a separate civil case, Heimbach is being sued in federal court for [[Assault (tort)|assault]] and [[Battery (tort)|battery]] by the woman he accosted at the March 2016 rally, Kashiya Nwanguma, and two of her fellow protesters, Henry Brousseau and Molly Shah, who allege that they were also the victims of violence at the rally. Also named as defendants are Alvin Bamberger (who is accused of assault and battery) and Donald Trump and Trump's campaign (who are accused of incitement to riot, negligence, and [[vicarious liability]]).&lt;ref name="Selk"&gt;Avi Selk, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/04/03/the-violent-rally-trump-cant-move-past/ The violent rally Trump can’t move past], ''Washington Post'' (April 3, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; In the case, Heimbach, who is representing himself, said that he "relied on Trump's authority" in order to oust the woman from the rally, citing Trump's directive to "Get 'em out of here" and promise to "pay for the legal fees" of supporters who expelled dissidents from rallies.&lt;ref name="Hensley"/&gt; On this basis, Heimbach has filed court papers seeking [[indemnity]] from Trump.&lt;ref&gt;David Zucchino, [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/27/us/a-trump-campaign-rally-led-to-shoving-and-legal-wrangling-too.html A Trump Campaign Rally Led to Shoving, and Legal Wrangling, Too], ''New York Times'' (May 27, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, the group created an online [[crowdfunding]] platform called "GoyFundMe" for racists, white supremacists and other extremists with the objective of advancing their causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sommer|first1=Allison Kaplan|title=What Is GoyFundMe?
