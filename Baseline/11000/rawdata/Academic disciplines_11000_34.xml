{{Advanced Placement}}

'''Advanced Placement Microeconomics''' (or '''AP Microeconomics''') is a course offered by the College Board as part of the Advanced Placement Program for high school students interested in college-level coursework in microeconomics and/or gaining [[advanced standing]] in [[college]]. The course begins with a study of fundamental economic concepts such as [[scarcity]], [[opportunity cost]]s, production possibilities, specialization, and [[Transfer credit|comparative advantage]]. Major topics include the nature of functions of product markets; factor markets; and efficiency, equity, and the role of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3270">An '''acknowledgement index''' ([[British English]] spelling&lt;ref name="gram"&gt;[http://grammarist.com/spelling/acknowledgment-acknowledgement/]&lt;/ref&gt;) or '''acknowledgment index''' ([[American English]] spelling&lt;Ref name="gram" /&gt;) is a method for [[Bibliographic index|indexing]] and analyzing acknowledgments in the [[scientific literature]] and, thus, quantifies the impact of [[acknowledgment (creative arts)|acknowledgements]]. Typically, a scholarly article has a section in which the authors acknowledge entities such as funding, technical staff, colleagues, etc. that have contributed materials or knowledge or have influenced or inspired their work. Like a [[citation index]], it measures influences on scientific work, but in a different sense; it measures institutional and economic influences as well as informal influences of individual people, ideas, and artifacts.
Unlike the [[impact factor]], it does not produce a single overall metric, but analyses the components separately. However, the total number of acknowledgements to an acknowledged entity can be measured and so can the number of citations to the papers in which the acknowledgement appears. The ratio of this total number of citations to the total number of papers in which the acknowledge entity appears can be construed as the impact of that acknowledged entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |doi=10.1145/1088622.1088627 |title=Automatic acknowledgement indexing: expanding the semantics of contribution in the CiteSeer digital library |book-title=Proceedings of the 3rd international conference on Knowledge capture |conference=K-CAP '05 |pages=19–26 |year=2005 |last1=Councill |first1=Isaac G. |last2=Giles |first2=C.

The first automated acknowledgement indexing was created in the search engine and digital library, [[CiteSeer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://csxstatic.ist.psu.edu/about |title=About CiteSeerX}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, that feature is no longer supported.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3517">'''Agrometeorology''' is the study of weather and use of weather and [[climate]] information to enhance or expand [[Agriculture|agricultural]] [[crop]]s and/or to increase crop production. Agrometeorology mainly involves the interaction of [[Meteorology|meteorological]] and [[Hydrology|hydrological]] factors, on one hand and agriculture, which encompasses [[horticulture]], [[animal husbandry]], and [[forestry]].

[[File:Horta 150706 REFON.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Horticulture is strongly influenced by climatic variations, however small.]]

It is an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]], [[Holism|holistic]] science forming a bridge between [[Outline of physical science|physical]] and [[Biology|biological]] sciences and beyond. It deals with a complex system involving soil, plant, atmosphere, agricultural management options, and others, which are interacting dynamically on various spatial and temporal scales. Specifically, the fully coupled soil-plant-atmosphere system has to be well understood in order to develop reasonable operational applications or recommendations for stakeholders. For these reasons, a comprehensive analysis of cause-effect relationships and principles that describe the influence of the state of the atmosphere, plants, and soil on different aspects of agricultural production, as well as the nature and importance of feedback between these elements of the system is necessary. Agrometeorological methods therefore use information and data from different key sciences such as soil [[soil physics|physics]] and [[soil chemistry|chemistry]], hydrology, meteorology, crop and animal [[physiology]] and [[phenology]], [[agronomy]], and others. Observed information is often combined in more or less complex models, focused on various components of system parts such as [[mass balance]]s (i.e. soil carbon, nutrients, and water), [[biomass]] production, crop growth and yield, and crop or pest phenology in order to detect sensitivities or potential responses of the soil-biosphere-atmosphere system. However, model applications still involve many uncertainties, which calls for further improvements of the description of system processes. A better quality of operational applications at various scales (monitoring, forecasting, warning, recommendations, etc.) is crucial for stakeholders. For example, new methods for spatial applications involve [[Geographic information system|GIS]] and [[Remote Sensing]] for spatial data presentation and generation. Further, tailor-made products and information transfer are critical to allow effective management decisions in the short and long term. These should cover sustainability and enhancement strategies (including risk management, mitigation and adaptation) considering climate variability and change. Papers are invited addressing these problems in the context of agrometeorological applications in “atmosphere” as an actual and important contribution to the state of the art.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.weather.co.zw/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=96&amp;Itemid=86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdpi.com/journal/atmosphere/special_issues/agrometeorology|title=Special Issue "Agrometeorology: From Scientific Analysis to Operational Application"|publisher=mdpi.com|date=30 June 2013|accessdate=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Allen Hershkowitz''' is an American [[environmental scientist]] who worked as a senior scientist at [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] from 1988 to 2014 and then at the Green Sports Alliance.

== Career ==
Hershkowitz started working at the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] (NRDC) around 1988.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pratt|first1=Timothy|title=NHL fights global warming by going carbon neutral|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/dec/18/nhl-global-warming-carbon-neutral-in-a-bid-to|work=The Guardian|date=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] approached the NRDC for advice about how to reduce the [[carbon footprint]] of the Oscar Awards show, after the academy was asked to do so by one of the producers of ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]''.  Hershkowitz, in his role as a senior scientist at the NRDC, helped them from 2007 to 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carpenter|first1=Susan|title=Stepping out on the recycled red carpet|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/greenspace/2011/02/stepping-out-onto-the-100-post-consumer-waste-recycled-red-carpet.html|work=LA Times Blogs - Greenspace|date=4 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, [[The Recording Academy]] asked the NRDC for help [[greening]] the Grammy Awards starting in 2008, and Hershkowitz led that effort as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Green Grammys Honor Great Music With Smaller Carbon Footprint|url=http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/feb2008/2008-02-11-097.html|work=Environmental News Service|date=February 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;


At an NRDC staff retreat in 2004, board member [[Robert Redford]] suggested that the NRDC establish more of a presence at professional sporting events; Hershkowitz told a reporter from ''Mother Jones'': "We were trying to figure out how to reach out to untraditional allies, and Redford says to us, 'You know, if you want to meet Americans, you’ve got to go to a baseball game or a football game. You’ve got to go to one of these stadiums. That’s where America is.'"&lt;ref name=MJ2011&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gordon|first1=Ian|title=Can Stadium Sports Really Be Green?|url=https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2011/10/green-sports-stadiums-baseball-giants/|work=Mother Jones|date=October 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hershkowitz met with [[Bud Selig]] of the [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) shortly after that, and soon the NRDC was creating white papers and teams to advise all the major sports leagues about environmental sustainability initiatives that addressed each sport's needs and could help them save money.&lt;ref name=MJ2011/&gt;  Hershkowitz eventually ran the Sports Greening Initiative at the NRDC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Belson|first1=Ken|title=Sports Industry Expands Its Environmental Initiatives|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/26/business/sports-industry-expands-its-environmental-initiatives.html|work=The New York Times|date=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Green Sports Alliance got started in the late 2000s as informal discussions among management of sports teams in the Pacific Northwest, about how to improve their operations' sustainability.&lt;ref name=MJ2011/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Steinbach|first1=Paul|title=Conservation is King at Seattle's Safeco Field - Athletic Business|url=http://www.athleticbusiness.com/Stadium-Arena/conservation-is-king-at-seattle-s-safeco-field.html|work=Athletic Business|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of formalizing an alliance was generated in a meeting between Hershkowitz and representatives of sports teams owned by [[Paul Allen]] via [[Vulcan Inc.]], and GSA formally launched in the spring of 2011, with NDRC as one of the founding organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Brien|first1=Luke|title=Green Sports Alliance: Go Green Or Go Home|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/1768522/green-sports-alliance-go-green-or-go-home|work=Fast Company|date=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014 Hershkowitz left the NRDC and became president of the GSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press release: Green Sports Alliance Ushers in New Era of Influence|url=http://greensportsalliance.org/green-sports-alliance-ushers-new-era-influence/|publisher=Green Sports Alliance|date=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, Hershkowitz was listed as the 50th most influential person in the field of [[Sport management|sports business]] by the ''[[Sports Business Daily]]'', which was the first time he had been on the list.  By the time of the listing, he had provided environmental sustainability advice to the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]], the [[National Hockey League|NHL]], [[Major League Baseball|MLB]], [[Major League Soccer]], and the [[U.S. Tennis Association]] that, according to the listing, had saved the leagues millions of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=50 Most Influential: No. 50 — Allen Hershkowitz|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2015/12/07/Most-Influential/50.aspx|work=Sports Business Daily|date=December 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Belson|first1=Ken|title=A Future for the Used-Up Tools of the Tennis Trade|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/03/sports/tennis/a-future-for-the-used-up-tools-of-the-tennis-trade.html|work=The New York Times|date=2 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;

In December 2015, the GSA under Hershkowitz's leadership helped organize two summits on sports sustainability at the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blaustein|first1=Lew|title=The Paris Tragedy, COP21 and the Sustainable Innovation in Sport Symposium|url=https://greensportsblog.com/2015/11/20/the-paris-tragedy-cop21-and-the-sustainable-innovation-in-sport-symposium/|website=GreenSportsBlog|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The participation of representatives from major American professional sports associations marked the first time the sports industry were directly involved with climate change initiatives by the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nelson|first1=Adam|title=Sustainable Innovation in Sport: leading the line in the battle against climate change|url=http://www.sportspromedia.com/magazine_features/sustainable_innovation_in_sport|website=SportsPro|publisher=SportsPro Media Limited|accessdate=14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Behavioral neuroscience''', also known as '''biological psychology''',&lt;ref&gt;[[Marc Breedlove|Breedlove]], Watson, [[Mark Rosenzweig (psychologist)|Rosenzweig]], ''Biological Psychology: An Introduction to Behavioral and Cognitive Neuroscience'', 6/e, {{ISBN|978-0-87893-705-9}}, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; '''biopsychology''', or '''psychobiology''',&lt;ref name="webby"&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?sourceid=Mozilla-search&amp;va=psychobiology  Psychobiology], Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; is the application of the principles of [[biology]] to the study of [[physiological]], [[Genetics|genetic]], and [[Developmental biology|developmental mechanisms]] of behavior in humans and other animals.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, R.K. 1993, "INTRODUCTION: A Biopsychology Festschrift in Honor of Lelon J. Peacock", Journal of General Psychology, vol. 120, no. 1, pp. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Behavioral neuroscience as a scientific discipline emerged from a variety of scientific and philosophical traditions in the 18th and 19th centuries. In philosophy, people like [[René Descartes]] proposed physical models to explain animal and human behavior. Descartes, for example, suggested that the [[pineal gland]], a midline unpaired structure in the brain of many organisms, was the point of contact between mind and body. Descartes also elaborated on a theory in which the [[pneumatics]] of bodily fluids could explain [[reflex]]es and other motor behavior. This theory was inspired by moving statues in a garden in Paris.&lt;ref name="Carlson" &gt;{{cite book |last=Carlson |first=Neil|title=Physiology of Behavior (9th Ed.) |publisher=Allyn and Bacon |pages=11–14 |year=2007 |isbn=0-205-46724-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other philosophers also helped give birth to [[psychology]]. One of the earliest textbooks in the new field, ''[[The Principles of Psychology]]'' by [[William James]], argues that the scientific study of psychology should be grounded in an understanding of biology:

{{quote|Bodily experiences, therefore, and more particularly brain-experiences, must take a place amongst those conditions of the mental life of which Psychology need take account.  The spiritualist and the associationist must both be 'cerebralists,' to the extent at least of admitting that certain peculiarities in the way of working of their own favorite principles are explicable only by the fact that the brain laws are a codeterminant of their result.

Our first conclusion, then, is that a certain amount of brain-physiology must be presupposed or included in Psychology.&lt;ref name="James" &gt;{{cite book |last=James |first=William |title=The Principles of Psychology, Vol. One |publisher=Dover Publications, Inc. |pages=4–5 |year=1950/1890 |isbn=0-486-20381-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The emergence of both psychology and behavioral neuroscience as legitimate sciences can be traced from the emergence of physiology from [[anatomy]], particularly [[neuroanatomy]]. Physiologists conducted experiments on living organisms, a practice that was distrusted by the dominant anatomists of the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref name="Shepherd" &gt;{{cite book |last=Shepherd |first=Gordon M.|title=Foundations of the Neuron Doctrine |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1991 |isbn=0-19-506491-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influential work of [[Claude Bernard]], [[Charles Bell]], and [[William Harvey]] helped to convince the scientific community that reliable data could be obtained from living subjects.

Even before the 18th and 19th century, behavioral neuroscience was beginning to take form as far back as 1700 B.C.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/psychology/courses/1010/mangels/neuro/history/history.html |title=History of Neuroscience |publisher=Columbia University |accessdate=2014-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question that seems to continually arise is what is the connection between the mind and body. The debate is formally referred to as the [[mind-body problem]]. There are two major schools of thought that attempt to resolve the mind–body problem; [[monism]] and [[mind-body dualism|dualism]].&lt;ref name="Carlson"/&gt; [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] are two of several philosophers who participated in this debate. Plato believed that the brain was where all mental thought and processes happened.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; In contrast, Aristotle believed that the brain served the purpose of cooling down the emotions derived from the heart.&lt;ref name="Carlson"/&gt; The mind-body problem was a stepping stone toward attempting to understand the connection between the mind and body.

Another debate arose about was localization of function or [[functional specialization (brain)|functional specialization]] versus [[equipotentiality]] which played a significant role in the development in behavioral neuroscience. As a result of localization of function research, many famous people found within psychology have come to various different conclusions. [[Wilder Penfield]] was able to develop a map of the cerebral cortex through studying epileptic patients along with Rassmussen.&lt;ref name="Carlson"/&gt; Research on localization of function has led behavioral neuroscientist to a better understanding of which parts of the brain control behavior. This is best exemplified through the case study of [[Phineas Gage]].

The term "psychobiology" has been used in a variety of contexts, emphasizing the importance of biology, which is the discipline that studies organic, neural and cellular modifications in behavior, plasticity in neuroscience, and biological diseases in all aspects, in addition, biology focuses and analyzes behavior and all the subjects it is concerned about, from a scientific point of view. In this context, psychology helps as a complementary, but important discipline in the neurobiological sciences. The role of psychology in this questions is that of a social tool that backs up the main or strongest biological science.  The term "psychobiology" was  first used in its modern sense by [[Knight Dunlap]] in his book ''An Outline of Psychobiology (1914)''.&lt;ref name="Dewsbury"&gt;{{cite journal
  |last=Dewsbury

  |doi=10.1037/0003-066x.46.3.198
  |pmid=2035930
  |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dunlap also was the founder and editor-in-chief of the journal ''Psychobiology''. In the announcement of that journal, Dunlap writes that the journal will publish research "...bearing on the interconnection of mental and physiological functions", which describes the field of behavioral neuroscience even in its modern sense.&lt;ref name="Dewsbury" /&gt;

==Relationship to other fields of psychology and biology==
In many cases, humans may serve as experimental subjects in behavioral neuroscience experiments; however, a great deal of the experimental literature in behavioral neuroscience comes from the study of non-human species, most frequently rats, mice, and monkeys. As a result, a critical assumption in behavioral neuroscience is that organisms share biological and behavioral similarities, enough to permit extrapolations across species. This allies behavioral neuroscience closely with [[comparative psychology]], [[evolutionary psychology]], [[evolutionary biology]], and [[neurobiology]]. Behavioral neuroscience also has paradigmatic and methodological similarities to [[neuropsychology]], which relies heavily on the study of the behavior of humans with nervous system dysfunction (i.e., a non-experimentally based biological manipulation).

Synonyms for behavioral neuroscience include biopsychology, biological psychology, and psychobiology.&lt;ref name = "Breedlove et al 2007"&gt;[[Marc Breedlove|S. Marc Breedlove]], [[Mark Rosenzweig (psychologist)|Mark Rosenzweig]] and Neil V. Watson (2007). Biological Psychology: An Introduction to Behavioral and Cognitive Neuroscience 6e. Sinauer Associates. {{ISBN|978-0-87893-705-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Physiological psychology]] is a subfield of behavioral neuroscience, with an appropriately narrower definition

== Research methods ==

The distinguishing characteristic of a behavioral neuroscience experiment is that either the [[independent variable]] of the experiment is biological, or some [[dependent variable]] is biological. In other words, the [[nervous system]] of the organism under study is permanently or temporarily altered, or some aspect of the nervous system is measured (usually to be related to a behavioral variable).

===Disabling or decreasing neural function===

* [[Lesions]] – A classic method in which a brain-region of interest is naturally or intentionally destroyed to observe any resulting changes such as degraded or enhanced performance on some behavioral measure. Lesions can be placed with relatively high accuracy "Thanks to a variety of brain 'atlases' which provide a map of brain regions in 3-dimensional "[[stereotactic surgery|stereotactic coordinates]].
** Surgical lesions –  Neural tissue is destroyed by removing it surgically.
** Electrolytic lesions – Neural tissue is destroyed through the application of electrical shock trauma.
** Chemical lesions – Neural tissue is destroyed by the infusion of a [[neurotoxin]].
** Temporary lesions – Neural tissue is temporarily disabled by cooling or by the use of [[anesthetics]] such as [[tetrodotoxin]].
* [[Transcranial magnetic stimulation]] – A new technique usually used with human subjects in which a magnetic coil applied to the scalp causes unsystematic electrical activity in nearby cortical neurons which can be experimentally analyzed as a functional lesion.
* [[Receptor activated solely by a synthetic ligand|Synthetic ligand injection]] – A receptor activated solely by a synthetic ligand (RASSL) or Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADD), permits spatial and temporal control of [[G protein]] signaling [[in vivo]]. These systems utilize G protein-coupled receptors ([[GPCR]]) engineered to respond exclusively to synthetic small molecules [[ligands]], like [[clozapine N-oxide]] (CNO), and not to their natural ligand(s).  RASSL's represent a GPCR-based [[chemogenetic]] tool. These synthetic ligands upon activation can decrease neural function by G-protein activation. This can with Potassium attenuating neural activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhu|first1=Hu|title=Silencing synapses with DREADDs|journal=Neuron|volume=82|issue=4|pages=723–725|pmc=4109642|year=2014|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2014.05.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Psychopharmacological manipulations – A chemical [[receptor antagonist]] induces neural activity by interfering with [[neurotransmission]]. Antagonists can be delivered systemically (such as by intravenous injection) or locally (intracerebrally) during a surgical procedure into the ventricles or into specific brain structures.  For example, [[NMDA]] [[antagonist]] [[AP5]] has been shown to inhibit the initiation of [[long term potentiation]] of excitatory synaptic transmission (in rodent fear conditioning) which is believed to be a vital mechanism in learning and memory.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, Jeansok J.; DeCola, Joseph P.; Landeira-Fernandez, Jesus; Fanselow, Michael S. "N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist APV blocks acquisition but not expression of fear conditioning." Behavioral Neuroscience. Vol 105(1), Feb 1991, 126-133. {doi|10.1037/0735-7044.105.1.126}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Optogenetic]] inhibition – A light activated inhibitory protein is expressed in cells of interest. Powerful millisecond timescale neuronal inhibition is instigated upon stimulation by the appropriate frequency of light delivered via fiber optics or implanted LEDs in the case of vertebrates,&lt;ref&gt;Schneider et al. "Controlling Neuronal Activity." American Journal of Psychiatry 165:562, May 2008 {{doi|10.1176/appi.ajp.2008.08030444}}&lt;/ref&gt; or via external illumination for small, sufficiently translucent invertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, et al. "Multimodal fast optical interrogation of neural circuitry." Nature. Vol 446. 5 April 2007. {{doi|10.1038/nature05744}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bacterial [[Halorhodopsins]] or [[Proton pumps]] are the two classes of proteins used for inhibitory optogenetics, achieving inhibition by increasing cytoplasmic levels of halides ({{chem|Cl|-}}) or decreasing the cytoplasmic concentration of protons, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Chow, B. Y. et al. "High-performance genetically targetable optical
neural silencing by light-driven proton pumps." Nature. Vol 463. 7 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gradinaru, Thompson, and Deisseroth. "eNpHR: a Natronomonas  halorhodopsin enhanced for optogenetic applications." Brain cell Biology. Vol 36 (1-4). Aug 2008. {{doi|10.1007/s11068-008-9027-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Enhancing neural function ===

* Electrical stimulation – A classic method in which neural activity is enhanced by application of a small electric current (too small to cause significant cell death).
* Psychopharmacological manipulations – A chemical [[receptor agonist]] facilitates neural activity by enhancing or replacing endogenous [[neurotransmitters]]. Agonists can be delivered systemically (such as by intravenous injection) or locally (intracerebrally) during a surgical procedure.
* Synthetic Ligand Injection – Likewise, G&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;-DREADDs can be used to modulate cellular function by innervation of brain regions such as Hippocampus. This innervation results in the amplification of γ-rhythms, which increases motor activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferguson|first1=Susan|title=Grateful DREADDs: Engineered Receptors Reveal How Neural Circuits Regulate Behavior|journal=Neuropsychopharmacology Reviews|date=2012|volume=37|pages=296–297|url=http://www.nature.com/npp/journal/v37/n1/full/npp2011179a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Transcranial magnetic stimulation]] – In some cases (for example, studies of [[motor cortex]]), this technique can be analyzed as having a stimulatory effect (rather than as a functional lesion).
* [[Optogenetic]] excitation – A light activated excitatory protein is expressed in select cells. [[Channelrhodopsin]]-2 (ChR2), a light activated cation channel, was the first bacterial opsin shown to excite neurons in response to light,&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, Wang, Boyden, and Deisseroth. "Channelrhodopsin-2 and optical control of excitable cells." Nature Methods. VOL.3 NO.10. OCTOBER 2006&lt;/ref&gt; though a number of new excitatory optogenetic tools have now been generated by improving and imparting novel properties to ChR2&lt;ref&gt;Gradinaru et al. "Molecular and Cellular Approaches for Diversifying and Extending Optogenetics." Cell. 2010. {{doi|10.1016/j.cell.2010.02.037}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Measuring neural activity ===
* Optical techniques – Optical methods for recording neuronal activity rely on methods that modify the optical properties of neurons in response to the cellular events associated with action potentials or neurotransmitter release.
** [[Voltage sensitive dyes]] (VSDs) were among the earliest method for optically detecting action potentials. VSDs commonly become fluorescent in response to a neuron's change in voltage, rendering individual action potentials detectable.&lt;ref&gt;Ebner, T. J. and Chen, G. "Use of voltage-sensitive dyes and optical recordings in the central nervous system." Progress in Neurobiology
Volume 46, Issue 5, August 1995, 463-506. {{doi|10.1016/0301-0082(95)00010-S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetically encoded voltage sensitive fluorescent proteins have also been developed.&lt;ref&gt;Micah S. Siegel and Ehud Y. Isacoff. "A Genetically Encoded Optical Probe of Membrane Voltage."Neuron, Vol. 19, 735–741, October, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Calcium imaging]] relies on dyes&lt;ref&gt;O'Donovan, Hoa, Sholomenkoa, and Yeea. "Real-time imaging of neurons retrogradely and anterogradely labelled with calcium-sensitive dyes." Journal of Neuroscience Methods. Vol 46, Issue 2, February 1993, 91-106. {{doi|10.1016/0165-0270(93)90145-H}}&lt;/ref&gt; or genetically encoded proteins&lt;ref&gt;Nicola Heim and Oliver Griesbeck. "Genetically Encoded Indicators of Cellular Calcium Dynamics Based on Troponin C and Green Fluorescent Protein." The Journal of Biological Chemistry, 279, 14280-14286. April 2, 2004 {{doi|10.1074/jbc.M312751200}}&lt;/ref&gt; that fluoresce upon binding to the calcium that is transiently present during an action potential.
** [[Synapto-pHluorin]] is a technique that relies on a [[fusion protein]] that combines a synaptic vesicle membrane protein and a pH sensitive fluorescent protein. Upon synaptic vesicle release, the chimeric protein is exposed to the higher pH of the synaptic cleft, causing a measurable change in fluorescence.&lt;ref&gt;Gero Miesenböck, Dino A. De Angelis  &amp;  James E. Rothman1. "Visualizing secretion and synaptic transmission with pH-sensitive green fluorescent proteins." ''Nature'' 394, 192-195 (9 July 1998) | {{doi|10.1038/28190}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Single-unit recording]] – A method whereby an electrode is introduced into the brain of a living animal to detect electrical activity that is generated by the neurons adjacent to the electrode tip. Normally this is performed with sedated animals but sometimes it is performed on awake animals engaged in a behavioral event, such as a thirsty rat whisking a particular sandpaper grade previously paired with water in order to measure the corresponding patterns of neuronal firing at the decision point.&lt;ref&gt;von Heimendahl, M., Itskov, P., Arabzadeh, E., &amp; Diamond, M. (2007). Neuronal activity in rat barrel cortex underlying texture discrimination. PLoS Biol, 5(11), e305.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Multielectrode recording – The use of a bundle of fine electrodes to record the simultaneous activity of up to hundreds of neurons.
* [[fMRI]] – Functional magnetic resonance imaging, a technique most frequently applied on human subjects, in which changes in cerebral blood flow can be detected in an [[MRI]] apparatus and are taken to indicate relative activity of larger scale brain regions (i.e., on the order of hundreds of thousands of neurons).
* [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] - Positron Emission Tomography detects particles called photons using a 3-D nuclear medicine examination. These particles are emitted by injections of radioisotopes such as fluorine. PET imaging reveal the pathological processes which predict anatomic changes making it important for detecting, diagnosing and characterising many pathologies&lt;ref&gt;Ocampo, T., Knight, K., Dunleavy, R., &amp; Shah, S. N. (2015). Techniques, Benefits, and Challenges of PET-MR. Radiologic technology, 86(4), 393-412.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Electroencephalography]] – Or EEG; and the derivative technique of [[event-related potential]]s, in which scalp electrodes monitor the average activity of neurons in the cortex (again, used most frequently with human subjects). This technique uses different types of electrodes for recording systems such as needle electrodes and saline-based electrodes. EEG allows for the investigation of mental disorders, sleep disorders and physiology. It can monitor brain development and cognitive engagement.&lt;ref&gt;Sanei, S., &amp; Chambers, J. A. (2013). EEG signal processing. John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Functional neuroanatomy – A more complex counterpart of [[phrenology]]. The expression of some anatomical marker is taken to reflect neural activity. For example, the expression of [[immediate early genes]] is thought to be caused by vigorous neural activity. Likewise, the injection of [[2-deoxyglucose]] prior to some behavioral task can be followed by anatomical localization of that chemical; it is taken up by neurons that are electrically active.
* [[Magnetoencephalography|MEG]] – Magnetoencephalography shows the functioning of the human brain through the measurement of electromagnetic activity.  Measuring the magnetic fields created by the electric current flowing within the neurons identifies brain activity associated with various human functions in real time, with millimeter spatial accuracy.  Clinicians can noninvasively obtain data to help them assess neurological disorders and plan surgical treatments.

=== Genetic techniques ===

* [[Quantitative trait loci|QTL mapping]] – The influence of a gene in some behavior can be statistically inferred by studying [[inbred strains]] of some species, most commonly mice. The recent sequencing of the [[genome]] of many species, most notably mice, has facilitated this technique.
* [[Selective breeding]] – Organisms, often mice, may be bred selectively among inbred strains to create a [[recombinant congenic strain]]. This might be done to isolate an experimentally interesting stretch of [[DNA]] derived from one strain on the background genome of another strain to allow stronger inferences about the role of that stretch of DNA.
* [[Genetic engineering]] – The genome may also be experimentally-manipulated; for example, [[knockout mice]] can be engineered to lack a particular gene, or a gene may be expressed in a strain which does not normally do so (the 'transgenic'). Advanced techniques may also permit the expression or suppression of a gene to occur by injection of some regulating chemical.

Computational models - Using a computer to formulate real-world problems to develop solutions.&lt;ref&gt;Otago, U. o., n/d. Computational Modelling. [Online] 
Available at: http://www.otago.ac.nz/courses/otago032670.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Although this method is often focused in computer science, it has begun to move towards other areas of study.For example, psychology is one of these areas. Computational models allow researchers in psychology to enhance their understanding of the functions and developments in nervous systems. Examples of methods include the modelling of neurons, networks and brain systems and theoretical analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Churchland, P. S., &amp; Sejnowski, T. J. (2016). The computational brain. MIT press.&lt;/ref&gt; Computational methods have a wide variety of roles including clarifying experiments, hypothesis testing and generating new insights. These techniques play an increasing role in the advancement of biological psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Brodland, G. W. (2015, December). How computational models can help unlock biological systems.

=== Limitations and advantages ===

Different manipulations have advantages and limitations. Neural tissue destroyed as a primary consequence of a surgery, electric shock or neurotoxin can confound the results so that the physical trauma masks changes in the fundamental neurophysiological processes of interest.
For example, when using an electrolytic probe to create a purposeful lesion in a distinct region of the rat brain, surrounding tissue can be affected: so, a change in behavior exhibited by the [[experimental group]] post-surgery is to some degree a result of damage to surrounding neural tissue, rather than by a lesion of a distinct brain region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kirby|first1=Elizabeth D.|last2=Jensen|first2=Kelly|last3=Goosens|first3=Ki A.|last4=Kaufer|first4=Daniela|title=Stereotaxic Surgery for Excitotoxic Lesion of Specific Brain Areas in the Adult Rat|pmc=3476400|journal=Journal of Visualized Experiments|issue=65|pages=4079|doi=10.3791/4079|date=19 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Abel and Lattal 2001"/&gt; Most genetic manipulation techniques are also considered permanent.&lt;ref name="Abel and Lattal 2001"/&gt; Temporary lesions can be achieved with advanced in genetic manipulations, for example, certain genes can now be switched on and off with diet.&lt;ref name="Abel and Lattal 2001"/&gt; Pharmacological manipulations also allow blocking of certain neurotransmitters temporarily as the function returns to its previous state after the drug has been metabolized.&lt;ref name="Abel and Lattal 2001"&gt;T Abel, KM Lattal (2001) "Molecular mechanisms of memory acquisition, consolidation and retrieval" ''Current Opinion in Neurobiology''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Topic areas ==

In general, behavioral neuroscientists study similar themes and issues as academic psychologists, though limited by the need to use nonhuman animals. As a result, the bulk of literature in behavioral neuroscience deals with mental processes and behaviors that are shared across different animal models such as:

*Sensation and perception
*Motivated behavior (hunger, thirst, sex)
*Control of movement
*Learning and memory
*Sleep and biological rhythms
*Emotion

However, with increasing technical sophistication and with the development of more precise noninvasive methods that can be applied to human subjects, behavioral neuroscientists are beginning to contribute to other classical topic areas of psychology, philosophy, and linguistics, such as:

*Language
*Reasoning and decision making
*Consciousness

Behavioral neuroscience has also had a strong history of contributing to the understanding of medical disorders, including those that fall under the purview of [[clinical psychology]] and [[biological psychopathology]] (also known as abnormal psychology). Although [[animal models]] do not exist for all mental illnesses, the field has contributed important therapeutic data on a variety of conditions, including:

*[[Parkinson's disease]], a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that often impairs the sufferer's motor skills and speech.
*[[Huntington's disease]], a rare inherited neurological  disorder whose most obvious symptoms are abnormal body movements and a lack of coordination. It also affects a number of mental abilities and some aspects of personality.
*[[Alzheimer's disease]], a neurodegenerative disease that, in its most common form, is found in people over the age of 65 and is characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration, together with declining activities of daily living and by neuropsychiatric symptoms or behavioral changes.
*[[Clinical depression]], a common psychiatric disorder, characterized by a persistent lowering of mood, loss of interest in usual activities and diminished ability to experience pleasure.
*[[Schizophrenia]], a psychiatric diagnosis that describes a mental illness characterized by impairments in the perception or expression of reality, most commonly manifesting as auditory hallucinations, paranoid or bizarre delusions or disorganized speech and thinking in the context of significant social or occupational dysfunction.
*[[Autism]], a brain development disorder that impairs social interaction and communication, and causes restricted and repetitive behavior, all starting before a child is three years old.
*[[Anxiety]], a physiological state characterized by cognitive, somatic, emotional, and behavioral components. These components combine to create the feelings that are typically recognized as fear, apprehension, or worry.
*[[Drug abuse]], including [[alcoholism]].

'''Body Worlds''' ([[German language|German]] title: Körperwelten) is a traveling exposition of dissected human bodies, animals, and other [[Anatomy|anatomical]] structures of the body that have been preserved through the process of [[plastination]]. [[Gunther von Hagens]] developed the preservation process which "unite[s] subtle anatomy and modern polymer chemistry",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koerperwelten.com/de/plastination/plastinationsprozess.html|title=Plastination|website=www.koerperwelten.com|access-date=14 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601170955/http://www.koerperwelten.com/de/plastination/plastinationsprozess.html|archive-date=1 June 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the late 1970s.

A series of ''Body Worlds'' anatomical exhibitions has toured many countries worldwide, sometimes raising controversies about the sourcing and display of actual human corpses and body parts. Nevertheless, Von Hagens maintains that all human specimens were obtained with full knowledge and consent of the donors before they died, and his organization keeps extensive documentation of this permission. Von Hagens emphasizes both educational and artistic aspects of his complex and innovative dissections, and offers online teaching guides for educators. He also tries to distinguish his efforts from those of competitors who may have been less thorough in obtaining advance permission from their specimen sources.

==Background==
[[File:Body Worlds Exhibit San Diego 2009.jpg|thumb|Gunther von Hagens' Body Worlds, San Diego, California, 2009]]

===Method===
The exhibit states that its purpose and mission is the education of laymen about the human body, leading to better health awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.channelm.co.uk/video_4x3.html?bcpid=1213934526&amp;bctid=1454906724 |title=Channel M No Smoking Day 12 March 2008 |publisher=Channelm.co.uk |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; All the human plastinates are from people who donated their bodies for plastination via a body donation program. Each Body Worlds exhibition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bodyworlds.com/en/media/picture_database/thumbnails.html?category=15 |title=Body Worlds Exhibitions |publisher=Bodyworlds.com |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716175844/http://www.bodyworlds.com/en/media/picture_database/thumbnails.html?category=15# |archive-date=16 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; contains approximately 25 full-body plastinates with expanded or selective [[organ (biology)|organs]] shown in positions that enhance the role of certain systems.

To produce specimens for ''Body Worlds'', von Hagens employs 340 people at five laboratories in three countries, China, Germany and Kyrgyzstan. Each laboratory is categorized by specialty, with the China laboratory focusing on animal specimens. One of the most difficult specimens to create was the [[giraffe]] that appears in ''Body Worlds &amp; The Cycle of Life''. The specimen took three years to complete – ten times longer than it takes to prepare a human body. Ten people are required to move the giraffe, because its final weight (like all specimens after plastination) is equal to the original animal.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

More than 200 specimens of real human organs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bodyworlds.com/en/media/picture_database/thumbnails.html?category=4 |title=Plastinated Organs |publisher=Bodyworlds.com |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110115101531/http://www.bodyworlds.com/en/media/picture_database/thumbnails.html?category=4# |archive-date=15 January 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and organ systems are displayed in glass cases, some showing various medical conditions. Some of the specimens, such as the Tai Chi Man, demonstrate interventions, and include [[prosthesis|prosthetics]] such as [[hip replacement|artificial hip]] [[joint]]s or [[heart valve]]s. Also featured is a liver with cirrhosis and the lungs of a smoker and non-smoker are placed side by side. A prenatal display features fetuses and [[embryo]]s, some with [[congenital disorder]]s.

===Tours===
Body Worlds exhibitions have received more than 37 million visitors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bodyworlds.com/en/exhibitions/past_exhibitions.html |title=Exhibitions |publisher=Bodyworlds.com |date= |accessdate=27 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522014837/http://www.bodyworlds.com/en/exhibitions/past_exhibitions.html# |archive-date=22 May 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; making them the world's most popular touring attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,443881,00.html |title=Fox news Dead Body Show Promotes Health, Exhibitor Says |publisher=Foxnews.com |date=24 October 2008 |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Body Worlds'' was first presented in [[Tokyo]] in 1995. Body Worlds exhibitions have since been hosted by more than 50 museums and venues in North America, Europe and Asia. ''Body Worlds 2 &amp; The Brain – Our Three Pound Gem'' (concerning the brain and [[nervous system]]) opened in 2005 at the [[California Science Center]] in [[Los Angeles]]. {{As of|2010|September}} it is showing at the [[Science World (Vancouver)|Telus World of Science]] in [[Vancouver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scienceworld.ca/bodyworlds|title=Galleries &amp; Theatres - Science World British Columbia|website=www.scienceworld.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several Body Worlds exhibits (as well as Von Hagens himself) were featured in the 2006 film ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]''. Among the plastinates featured were the ''Poker Playing Trio'' (which plays a key role in one scene) and ''Rearing Horse and Rider''.

''Body Worlds 3 &amp; The Story of the Heart'' (concerning the [[cardiovascular system]]) opened on 25 February 2006, at the [[Houston Museum of Natural Science]]. On 9 July 2009 this show appeared at the [[Buffalo Museum of Science]] in [[Buffalo, New York]]. {{As of|2010|May}}, it is showing at the [[Denver Museum of Nature and Science]] in [[Denver]], Colorado.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dmns.org/exhibitions/current-exhibitions Current Exhibitions], Denver Museum of Nature and Science. Retrieved 19 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Body Worlds 4'' debuted 22 February 2008 at the [[Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester]] in [[England]] and was in the Cureghem Cellars in [[Brussels]] until March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bodyworlds.red-dog.com/ Cureghem Cellars Official BODY WORLDS site] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610060739/http://bodyworlds.red-dog.com/ |date=10 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Body Worlds &amp; The Mirror of Time'' (featuring human development and aging) debuted at [[The O2 (London)|The O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] in London in October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visitlondon.com/bodyworlds |title=Visit London BODY WORLDS at the O2 official site |publisher=Visitlondon.com |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727080255/http://www.visitlondon.com/bodyworlds/ |archivedate=27 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Körperwelten &amp; Der Zyklus Des Lebens (The cycle of life)'' opened in Heidelberg in January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koerperwelten-deutschland.de/english.html Körperwelten &amp; Der Zyklus Des Lebens]{{Dead link|date=February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Body Worlds Vital'' was inaugurated at the Universum museum of the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] in 2012.&lt;ref name=universum&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.universum.unam.mx/bodyworlds/en/ |title=Body Worlds Vital |publisher=UNAM |accessdate=1 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulatory framework==

===Czech Republic===
In July 2008, the Czech Senate passed a law to address illegal trading in human tissue and ban "advertising of donation of human cells and tissues for money or similar advantages".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/news/index_view.php?id=323506 |title=Czech Senate toughens rules for handling of human tissue |publisher=Ceskenoviny.cz |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
On Tuesday 21 April 2009, a French judge ruled concerning the [[Paris]] exhibition of ''Our Body: The Universe Within'', that exhibiting dead bodies for profit was a "violation of the respect owed to them". "Under the law, the proper place for corpses is in the cemetery", said Judge Louis-Marie Raingeard. Raingeard ordered the exhibition to close within 24 hours or face a fine of 20,000 euro (over 26,000 dollars) for each day it stayed open. The judge also ordered authorities to seize the 17 bodies on display and all of the organs on display from an unknown number of people for proper burial. Gunther Von Hagens issued a press statement denying any connection between the closed Chinese exhibition and his Body Worlds franchise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abcnews.go.com/Blotter/story?id=7411070 France Shuts Down Popular Bodies Show]&amp;page=1&lt;/ref&gt; Similar exhibitions had already been successfully staged in [[Lyon]] and [[Marseille]].

===United Kingdom===

====England and Wales====
The [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]] created legislation for exhibits of human remains, including plastinated bodies and body parts, in [[England and Wales]] under the [[Human Tissue Act 2004]]. This requires a licence to be granted by the [[Human Tissue Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hta.gov.uk/licensing.cfm HTA Licensing] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424090842/http://www.hta.gov.uk/licensing.cfm |date=24 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Human Tissue Act superseded the [[Anatomy Act 1832]], which had been found by an independent commission (The Redfern Report)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/jan/31/alderhey1 |title=UK, Main findings of the Redfern report |publisher=Guardian |date= 31 January 2001|accessdate=25 February 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be inadequate on contemporary collection and use of human tissues, following the [[Alder Hey organs scandal]]. In March 2008, the [[Manchester Museum of Science and Industry]] was granted such a licence to hold ''Body Worlds 4'' and a further licence was granted to the exhibition in the O2, London, in 2008.

====Scotland====
The [[Human Tissue (Scotland) Act 2006]] – which amended the Anatomy Act 1984 – covers Scotland. Under the terms of this Act, licences for the handling of human remains, including display, must be granted directly by the Scottish Ministry.

{{quote|Subsection 9: If the Scottish Ministers think it desirable to do so in the interests of education, training or research, they may grant a license to a person to publicly display the body or, as the case may be, the part, and a person is authorized under this subsection to so display a body or a part of a body if, at the time of the display he is licensed under this subsection.}}

Various organizations gave evidence to the [[Scottish Executive]] during the consultation process, including the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]], the [[Wellcome Trust]], and the [[Museums Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumsassociation.org/ma/11480 |title=Response by the Museums Association on the Human Tissue (Scotland) Bill |publisher=Museums Association |date=8 September 2005 |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Various legislation has been proposed and enacted in different American states. Most proposals concentrate on issues regarding the sale of human remains and the consent of the donors.

National legislation on consent and tissue donation issues is expressed in the [[Uniform Anatomical Gift Act]] (2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anatomicalgiftact.org/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabindex=1&amp;tabid=63 |title=Anatomical Gift Act |publisher=Anatomical Gift Act |date=26 August 2009 |accessdate=25 February 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923090355/http://www.anatomicalgiftact.org/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabindex=1&amp;tabid=63# |archive-date=23 September 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; passed by the [[National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws]] which states that "an anatomical gift of a donor's body or part may be made during the life of the donor for the purpose of transplantation, therapy, research, or education" and prohibits trafficking in donated human organs for profit.

In early 2008, former U.S. Republican Representative [[Todd Akin|W. Todd Akin]] proposed an amendment to the [[Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act]] of 1930&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statesurge.com/bills/69436-hr5677-federal |title=Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 |publisher=Statesurge.com |date=16 April 2008 |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; to "make it unlawful for a person to import plastinated human remains into the United States." The President of the American Association of Anatomists has expressed concern that the scope of the act is "too broad" and that "Preventing importation of all plastinated specimens could severely restrict their use for medical education.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anatomy.org/Files/private/newsletters/aaa_sept_nl.pdf |title=American Association of Anatomists Newsletter Vol. 17, No. 3, September 2008 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327110113/http://www.anatomy.org/Files/private/newsletters/aaa_sept_nl.pdf |archivedate=27 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill of amendment was not enacted during the 2007–2008 Congressional session.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-5677 |title=H.R. 5677: To amend the Tariff Act of 1930 |publisher=Govtrack.us |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====California====
California's proposed bill AB1519 (Ma), sponsored by Assemblywoman [[Fiona Ma]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ma |url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/asm/ab_1501-1550/ab_1519_bill_20080617_amended_sen_v92.html |title=California State bill AB1519 (Ma) |publisher=Leginfo.ca.gov |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; tried to "require exhibitors to get a county permit; to do so, they would have to prove to county health officials that the people whose cadavers were on display — or their next of kin — had consented".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-corpse25jan25,0,2070702.story |title=Cadaver shows raise consent concerns – Los Angeles Times |publisher=Latimes.com |date=25 January 2008 |first=Marc |last=Lifsher |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080129210804/http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-corpse25jan25%2C0%2C2070702.story |archivedate=29 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assembly Bill 1519 would have made California the first state to require such proof.&lt;ref name="californiachronicle.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.californiachronicle.com/articles/71686 |title=Legislation to Regulate Dead Body Exhibits Moves on to The Governor |publisher=Californiachronicle.com |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911144748/http://www.californiachronicle.com/articles/71686 |archivedate=11 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was vetoed by Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] on 26 September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[ftp://leginfo.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/asm/ab_1501-1550/ab_1519_bill_20080926_history.html A.B. No. 1519 bill history, from the Government of California]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Florida====
The state of [[Florida]] prohibits the sale or purchase of human remains and "Authorizes certain science centers located in this state to transport plastinated bodies into, within, or out of this state and exhibit such bodies for the purpose of public education without the consent of this state's anatomical board if the science center notifies the board of any such transportation or exhibition, as well as the location and duration of any exhibition, at least 30 days before such transportation or exhibition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/cgi-bin/view_page.pl?Tab=session&amp;Submenu=1&amp;FT=D&amp;File=sb2554.html&amp;Directory=session/2007/Senate/bills/billtext/html/ |title=State of Florida Legislation |publisher=Leg.state.fl.us |date=1 July 2007 |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hawaii====
In January 2009, Rep. Marcus Oshiro introduced two bills prompted by presentation of the BODIES Exhibition in that state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starbulletin.com/editorials/20090129_Enact_restrictions_on_cadavers_shown_in_public_exhibits.html |title=Enact restrictions on cadavers shown in public exhibits |publisher=Starbulletin.com |date=29 January 2009 |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HB28 Relating to Dead Human Bodies would add to the prohibition against buying dead human bodies, the selling of dead human bodies and defines the term "dead human body" to include plastinated bodies and body parts. It would increase the fine for buying or selling a dead human body to up to $5,000.

HB29 Relating to Dead Human Bodies. Would prohibit the commercial display of dead human bodies without a permit from the Department of Health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Georgette |url=http://hawaiihouseblog.blogspot.com/2009/01/inspired-by-bodies.html |title=Hawaii House Blog: Inspired by Bodies |publisher=Hawaiihouseblog.blogspot.com |date=23 January 2009 |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New York====
In June 2008, [[New York (state)|New York]] State Senate passed legislation regulating body exhibits. A bill that was sponsored by Senator Jim Alesi requires anyone showing an exhibit that uses real human bodies in New York museums to produce a permit detailing their origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rochesterhomepage.net/content/fulltext/?cid=17741 |title=Rochester Homepage Cracking down on human body exhibits |publisher=Rochesterhomepage.net |date=19 June 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208180852/http://rochesterhomepage.net/content/fulltext/?cid=17741 | archivedate = 8 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pennsylvania====
Representative [[Mike Fleck|Mike Fleck's]] proposed bill would require evidence of informed consent from the decedent or relatives of all humans whose remains are put on display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legis.state.pa.us/CFDOCS/Legis/PN/Public/btCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&amp;sessYr=2007&amp;sessInd=0&amp;billBody=H&amp;billTyp=B&amp;billNbr=2299&amp;pn=3339 |title=Pennsylvania bodies exhibit regulatory bill |publisher=Legis.state.pa.us |date=10 March 2008 |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Washington====
The state of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] considered a bill that would "require written authorization to display human remains for a commercial purpose".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.leg.wa.gov/billinfo/Summary.aspx?bill=1253&amp;year=2007 |title=State of Washington Bill Requiring written authorization to display human remains for a commercial purpose |publisher=Apps.leg.wa.gov |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious groups, including representatives of the [[Catholic Church]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://rcav.org/2010-09-30-concerns-about-body-worlds/ Archdiocese of Vancouver – Body Worlds Exhibit] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413125000/http://rcav.org/2010-09-30-concerns-about-body-worlds/ |date=13 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and some [[Jewish]] rabbis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=DEBORAH SUSSMAN SUSSER Associate Editor |url=http://www.jewishaz.com/issues/story.mv?070209+body |title='Body Worlds' comes to Phoenix – Jewish News of Greater Phoenix |publisher=Jewishaz.com |date=9 February 2007 |accessdate=25 February 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609080641/http://www.jewishaz.com/issues/story.mv?070209+body |archive-date=9 June 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; have objected to the display of human remains, stating that it is inconsistent with reverence towards the human body.

===Sex plastinate===
In 2003, while promoting a display in the Hamburg Museum of Erotica, von Hagens announced his intention to create a sex plastinate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Sky-News-Archive/Article/200806412221471 |title=Prof in Corpse Sex plan |publisher=News.sky.com |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090613044212/http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Sky-News-Archive/Article/200806412221471 |archivedate=13 June 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2009 he unveiled a plastinate of a couple having sex, intended for a Berlin exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Von Peter Kiefer Und Claudia Weingärtner |url=http://www.bild.de/BILD/regional/berlin/aktuell/2009/05/05/koerperwelten-dr-tod-gunther-von-hagens/er-zeigt-leichen-beim-sex.html |title=Dr. Tod zeigt Leichensex in Berlin |publisher=Bild.de |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lessening donor organ availability===
In 2007, the [[Bishop of Manchester]] launched a campaign&lt;ref&gt;Bishop of Manchester's campaign Site Corpseshow.info&lt;/ref&gt; to coincide with the opening of Body Worlds in that city, accusing the exhibitors of being "body snatchers" and "robbing the NHS", arguing that donation of bodies for plastination would deprive the [[National Health Service]] of organs for transplant. The site included a government petition calling for "a review of the law regarding the policies and practices of touring shows involving corpses".

===Consent===
{{see also|Organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners in China}}
Consent is a primary focus of discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B7GWX-4R71KF2-1&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=6ba114742d1043defa8f00ec7295486b |title=Looking Back and Looking Ahead |publisher=Science Direct |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010 |doi=10.1016/j.aanat.2007.07.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2004, the German news magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' reported that von Hagens had acquired corpses of executed prisoners in China; von Hagens countered that he did not know the origin of the bodies, and returned seven disputed cadavers to China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Angelique Chrisafis in Paris |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/21/corpse-france-hagens-ouvert |title= French Judge Closes Body Worlds Style Exhibition of Corpses |work= The Guardian |date= 21 April 2009|accessdate=25 February 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, von Hagens obtained an injunction against ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' for making the claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pressemeldinger.no/read.asp?RecNo=15417 |title=Institute fur Plastination, Statement on Wrongful Allegations and False Reports by Media on the Origin of Bodies in BODY WORLDS Exhibitions, press release |publisher=Pressemeldinger.no |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Harris, director of North Carolina's State Board of Funeral Services, has stated, "Somebody at some level of government ought to be able to look at a death certificate, a statement from an embalmer, donation documents... That's a reasonable standard to apply."&lt;ref&gt;[http://jscms.jrn.columbia.edu/cns/2006-02-28/winter-bodyexhibits/ Body exhibits titillate, but are they legal? — JSCMS] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224010254/http://jscms.jrn.columbia.edu/cns/2006-02-28/winter-bodyexhibits/ |date=24 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Assemblywoman Fiona Ma (D-San Francisco) said, "These displays do have important educational benefits, but using bodies against a person's will is unacceptable".&lt;ref name="californiachronicle.com"/&gt;

Questions raised regarding deceased hospital patients from [[Kyrgyzstan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bodyworlds.com/Downloads/E_Kirgisien%20AW%20GVH%202.pdf |title=Kirghisien No Skeletons in the Closet — Facts, Background and Conclusions: A response to the alleged corpse scandals in Novosibirsk, Russia, and Bishkek, Kyrgizstan |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327110115/http://www.bodyworlds.com/Downloads/E_Kirgisien%20AW%20GVH%202.pdf |archivedate=27 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and executed prisoners from [[China]] – were categorically stated to have never been used in a Body Worlds exhibition, according to BodyWorlds. "Five years ago, customs officers intercepted 56 bodies and hundreds of brain samples sent from the Novosibirsk Medical Academy to von Hagens' lab in Heidelberg, Germany. The cadavers were traced to a Russian medical examiner who was convicted last year of illegally selling the bodies of homeless people, prisoners and indigent hospital patients. Von Hagens was not charged with any wrongdoing, and says his cadavers are obtained only through proper legal and ethical channels.&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5637687|title=Origins of Exhibited Cadavers Questioned|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Ethical Commission set up by the [[California Science Center]] in Los Angeles in 2004 had the following members: 
Reverend Richard Benson, Assistant Prof of Moral Theology and Academic Dean, 
St. John's Seminar, Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles;
David C. Blake, PhD, JD, VP, Mission and Ethics,
Saint John's Health Center;
Rabbi Morley Feinstein,
Senior Rabbi, University Synagogue;
Reverend Leonard Jackson,
Associate Minister,
First African Methodist Episcopal Church (First AME). 
They determined that 
"All the bodies need to be properly donated. Advisors felt that this is the most controversial aspect of the project. Proper body donation should be verified to the Science Center's satisfaction, and involves several components. Several advisors reviewed the Body Donor and felt it should be reviewed to ensure that it meets an adequate standard of disclosure and informed consent. They recommended that the form should be clear to make sure the bodies in the exhibit consented to public display. The source of donated bodies should be verifiable; Ask an independent party to review donor forms, verifying that all bodies are donated properly.; Communicate to guests, near the entrance of the exhibit, that the bodies are donated."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bodyworlds.com/Downloads/englisch/Media/Press%20Kit/BW_LA_SummaryofEthicalReview.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=25 February 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110115125640/http://www.bodyworlds.com/Downloads/englisch/Media/Press%20Kit/BW_LA_SummaryofEthicalReview.pdf |archive-date=15 January 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bodyworlds.com/Downloads/englisch/Media/Press%20Kit/BW_LA_SummaryofEthicalReview.pdf |title=Body Worlds: An Anatomical Exhibition of Real Human Bodies Summary of Ethical Review 2004/2005 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an ethical concern, consent is not regulated worldwide according to the same ethics. "That paperwork is then separated from the bodies, which can be used for displays or sold in pieces to medical schools. No one will know for sure, because each plastinated corpse is made anonymous to protect its privacy."&lt;ref name="npr.org"/&gt; Hans Martin Sass, a philosophy professor with a speciality in ethics, was hired by the California Science Center to investigate Body Worlds before the show's U.S. debut in 2004. He matched over 200 donation forms to death certificates, but he did not match the paperwork to specific bodies von Hagens has on display.&lt;ref name="npr.org"/&gt;

===Import law concerns===
International trade experts have objected to the way in which bodies for commercial display are imported, because the way their categorization codes (as "art collections") do not require [[Centers for Disease Control]] stamps or death certificates, both of which are required for medical cadavers.&lt;ref&gt;Television broadcast: Channel 3SAT, 1 May 2000,"Die Leichenshow" ("The Cadaver Show")&lt;/ref&gt; In most countries plastinated human specimens are classified under Customs Classification Code 97050000.48 "items in anatomical collections". This customs code encompasses "zoological, botanical, mineralogical or anatomical collections or items in such collections."&lt;ref&gt;Warenverzeichnis für die Außenhandelsstatistik (List of goods for statistics on exports), 1998 Edition of the Federal Bureau of Statistics.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethical concerns about cadaver displays===
In an ethical analysis, Thomas Hibbs, professor of ethics and culture at [[Baylor University]], a private [[Baptist]]-affiliated institution, compared cadaver displays to pornography, in that they reduce the subject to "the manipulation of body parts stripped of any larger human significance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=eResources, http://www.eResources.com |url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/archive/15/soa/bodyworlds.htm |title=A Journal of Technology and Society – Dead Body Porn – Thomas S.

In a 2006 lecture entitled "Plasti-Nation: How America was Won",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Plasti-Nation: How America Was Won |url=http://blog.lib.umn.edu/sphpod/sphpod/2006/07/plastination_how_america_was_w_1.html |title=Public Lectures: Plasti-Nation: How America Was Won Archives |publisher=Blog.lib.umn.edu |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628063801/http://blog.lib.umn.edu/sphpod/sphpod/2006/07/plastination_how_america_was_w_1.html |archivedate=28 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucia Tanassi, professor of medical ethics and anthropology at [[Vanderbilt University Medical Center]], explored questions for ethicists regarding this new scientific frontier. Tanassi called it provocative that ethics committees have contributed to the popularization of the exhibits without setting forth any process of a line of inquiry, pointing to an ethics report from the California Science Center. As part of that review, bioethicist Hans Martin Sass was sent to Heidelberg to match donor consents with death certificates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5637687 |title=Origins of Exhibited Cadavers Questioned |publisher=NPR |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns have been expressed about the educational aspects, especially the inclusion of these displays for school field trips. St. Louis Diocese Archbishop Raymond Burke strongly suggested that Catholic Schools avoid scheduling field trips, stating that parents, and not children, should retain the freedom of deciding whether or not their children will view the exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myfoxstl.com/myfox/pages/News/Detail?contentId=4201800&amp;version=1&amp;locale=EN-US&amp;layoutCode=TSTY&amp;pageId=3.2.1 |title=St. Louis Ticket Broker &amp;#124; St Louis Cardinals &amp; St Louis Blues Tickets &amp;#124; Mizzou Football Tickets from The Ticket Guys |publisher=Myfoxstl.com |date= |accessdate=27 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080623080125/http://www.myfoxstl.com/myfox/pages/News/Detail?contentId=4201800&amp;version=1&amp;locale=EN-US&amp;layoutCode=TSTY&amp;pageId=3.2.1 |archivedate=23 June 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerned with how "some kids process" these "graphic" images, Des McKay, school superintendent in [[Abbotsford, British Columbia|Abbotsford]], British Columbia (near [[Greater Vancouver]]), barred field trips to exhibits of plasticized human beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vancouver |first=The |url=http://www.canada.com/theprovince/news/story.html?id=f89ece3d-f0e0-4d55-aa2e-746a9fcd9079&amp;k=63910 |title=Abbotsford schools barred from taking ghoulish field trip |publisher=Canada.com |date=1 October 2006 |accessdate=25 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208231942/http://www2.canada.com/theprovince/news/story.html?id=f89ece3d-f0e0-4d55-aa2e-746a9fcd9079&amp;k=63910 |archivedate=8 February 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an editorial to the Abbotsford News, Rev. Christoph Reiners questions what effect the exhibits will have on the values of children attending for school field trips.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dignityinboston.googlepages.com/bodyworldsobjectifieshumanity dignity in Boston – Body worlds objectifies humanity] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304155233/http://dignityinboston.googlepages.com/bodyworldsobjectifieshumanity |date=4 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others—such as the Catholic Schools Office of Phoenix—acknowledge the educational content of Body Worlds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Phelan |first=Mike |url=http://www.catholicsun.org/2007/feb15/local/bodyworlds.html |title=Phoenix Diocesan Newspaper |publisher=The Catholic Sun |date=15 February 2007 |accessdate=25 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205020019/http://www.catholicsun.org/2007/feb15/local/bodyworlds.html |archivedate=5 February 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reporting on the exhibition at the O2 bubble in 2008/2009, Melanie Reid of The Times stated "(Body Worlds) should be compulsory viewing for every child of 10 or over"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/melanie_reid/article5002781.ece Melanie Reid, The Times: Not gory, not scary, just fascinating] Retrieved 19 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Press limitations===
Von Hagens maintains [[copyright]] control over pictures of his exhibits. Visitors are not allowed to take pictures, and press photographers are required to sign agreements permitting only a single publication in a defined context, followed by a return of the copyright to Von Hagens. Because of a similar agreement applied to sound bites (O-Töne, in German) a German press organization suggested that the press refrain from reporting about the exhibition in Munich in 2003 .&lt;ref&gt;Keine O-Töne über Körperwelten [http://www.djv.de/SingleNews.20+M532fe2eeb51.0.html Pressemitteilung, Deutscher Journalisten-Verband, 25 August 2003] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718231505/http://www.djv.de/SingleNews.20+M532fe2eeb51.0.html# |date=18 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selling plastinates===
The Body Worlds website offers plastinated pieces for sale. There are a wide range of products from plastinated fruit jewelry to entire humans. Although some of the pieces require purchasers to be a qualified user—those intending to use the pieces for "research, educational, medical or therapeutic purposes"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Donating Your Body For Plastination|url=http://www.bodymobil.de/Downloads/Deutsch/Downloads/Brosch/BD_Brochure_EN_EU08_240613.pdf|publisher=Institute for Plastination|accessdate=24 May 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525232216/http://www.bodymobil.de/Downloads/Deutsch/Downloads/Brosch/BD_Brochure_EN_EU08_240613.pdf|archivedate=25 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;—many pieces, including animal testicles and baby chicks, require no authorization. There are also extremely realistic plastinate impressions of human hearts and slices (including one slice of copulating humans) for sale to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plastination-products.com/Blood-vessel-configuration/Human-blood-vessel-configuration/Hearts/Human-heart-natural::1239.html |title=Menschliches Herz; natürlich – von Hagens Onlineshop |publisher=Plastination-products.com |date= |accessdate=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Competitors ==
The success of Body Worlds has given rise to several similar shows featuring plastinated cadavers, including ''[[BODIES... The Exhibition]]'' and ''Our Body: The Universe Within'' in the [[United States]], ''[[Bodies Revealed]]'' in the [[United Kingdom]], ''Body Exploration'' in the [[Republic of China]], ''Mysteries of the Human Body'' in [[South Korea]], ''[[Jintai Plastomic]]: Mysteries of the Human Body'' in [[Japan]], ''Cuerpos Entrañables'' in [[Spain]].

Some of these contain exhibits very similar to von Hagens' plastinates; Von Hagens has asserted copyright protection, and has sued ''Body Exploration'' and ''Bodies Revealed''.
The suits were based on a presumed copyright of certain positions of the bodies, but the [[counterparty]] asserts that the human body in its diversity cannot be copyrighted.

Such lawsuits&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1145538532408 |title=Body Exhibits Attract Suits on Contracts, Copyrights |publisher=Law.com |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; have not stopped the competition. While the Korean police in Seoul confiscated a few exhibits from ''Bodies Revealed'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bodiesrevealed.com/korean-times.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327110112/http://www.bodiesrevealed.com/korean-times.pdf |date=27 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the exhibition went on successfully.

Several of the competing exhibitions have been organized by the publicly traded US company [[Premier Exhibitions]]. They started their first ''Bodies Revealed'' exhibition in [[Blackpool, England]] which ran from August through October 2004. In 2005 and 2006 the company opened their ''Bodies Revealed'' and ''BODIES... The Exhibition'' exhibitions in Seoul, Tampa, Miami, New York City, and Seattle. Other exhibition sites in 2006 are Mexico City, Atlanta (GA), London, Great Britain and Las Vegas (Nevada).

Unlike Body Worlds, none of the competing exhibitions or their suppliers have a body donation programme. Dr. Roy Glover, a spokesperson for ''BODIES... The Exhibition'' said all their exhibits use unclaimed cadavers, deposited at the University of Dalian by Chinese authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5637687 |title=NPR Origins of Exhibited Cadavers Questioned |publisher=Npr.org |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2008, a settlement with the attorney general of New York obliged Premier Exhibitions to offer refunds to visitors when it could not prove consent for the use of the bodies in its exhibitions. New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo commented: "Despite repeated denials, we now know that Premier itself cannot demonstrate the circumstances that led to the death of the individuals. Nor is Premier able to establish that these people consented to their remains being used in this manner."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Cuomo Settlement With 'Bodies...

A '''bridge''' is a [[nonbuilding structure|structure]] built to [[span (engineering)|span]] physical obstacles without closing the way underneath such as a [[body of water]], [[valley]], or [[road]], for the purpose of providing passage over the obstacle, usually something that can be detrimental to cross otherwise. There are many different designs that each serve a particular purpose and apply to different situations. Designs of bridges vary depending on the function of the bridge, the nature of the [[terrain]] where the bridge is constructed and anchored, the material used to make it, and the funds available to build it.

Most likely the earliest bridges were fallen trees and [[stepping stones]], while [[Neolithic]] people built [[boardwalk]] bridges across marshland. The [[Arkadiko Bridge]] dating from the 13th century BC, in the [[Peloponnese]], in southern Greece is one of the oldest [[arch bridge]]s still in existence and use.

==Etymology==
[[File:Akashi-kaikyo bridge3.jpg|thumb|The [[Akashi Kaikyō Bridge]] in [[Japan]], currently the world's longest suspension span]]
[[File:Sio se pol.jpg|thumb|The [[Siosepol]] bridge over [[Zayanderud|Zayandeh River]] is an example of [[Safavid dynasty]] (1502–1722) bridge design. [[Esfahan]], [[Iran]]]]
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' traces the origin of the word ''bridge'' to an [[Old English]] word ''brycg'', of the same meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Oxford University Press|author=Fowler|title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary|date=1925|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word can be traced directly back to Proto-Indo-European ''*bʰrēw-.'' The word for the [[Contract bridge|card game of the same name]] has a different origin.

==History==
[[File:Pont mycénien de Kazarma 2.jpg|thumb|The [[Arkadiko Bridge]] in [[Greece]] (13th century BC), one of the oldest [[arch bridge]]s in existence]]

Among the oldest [[timber bridge]]s is the [[Holzbrücke Rapperswil-Hurden]] crossing upper [[Lake Zürich]] in Switzerland; the prehistoric timber piles discovered to the west of the [[Seedamm]] date back to 1523 BC. The first wooden footbridge led across [[Lake Zürich]], followed by several reconstructions at least until the late 2nd century AD, when the [[Roman Empire]] built a {{convert|6|m|ft|adj=mid|-wide}} wooden bridge. Between 1358 and 1360, [[Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria]], built a 'new' wooden bridge across the lake that has been used to 1878 – measuring approximately {{convert|1450|m|ft}} in length and {{convert|4|m|ft}} wide. On April 6, 2001, the reconstructed wooden footbridge was opened, being the longest wooden bridge in Switzerland.

The [[Arkadiko Bridge]] is one of four Mycenaean [[corbel arch]] bridges part of a former network of roads, designed to accommodate [[chariot]]s, between the fort of Tiryns and town of Epidauros in the [[Peloponnese]], in southern Greece. Dating to the Greek [[Bronze Age]] (13th century BC), it is one of the oldest [[arch bridge]]s still in existence and use.
Several intact arched stone bridges from the [[Hellenistic age|Hellenistic era]] can be found in the Peloponnese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kutz, Myer|title=Handbook of Transportation Engineering, Volume II: Applications and Technologies, Second Edition|year=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|isbn=978-0071614771}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although large Chinese bridges of wooden construction existed at the time of the [[Warring States]], the oldest surviving stone bridge in China is the [[Zhaozhou Bridge]], built from 595 to 605 AD during the [[Sui Dynasty]]. This bridge is also historically significant as it is the world's oldest [[Spandrel|open-spandrel]] stone segmental arch bridge. European segmental arch bridges date back to at least the [[Alconétar Bridge]] (approximately 2nd century AD), while the enormous Roman era [[Trajan's Bridge]] (105 AD) featured open-spandrel segmental arches in wooden construction.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

[[Inca rope bridge|Rope bridges]], a simple type of [[suspension bridge]], were used by the [[Inca]] civilization in the [[Andes]] mountains of South America, just prior to European colonization in the 16th century.

During the 18th century there were many innovations in the design of timber bridges by [[Hans Ulrich Grubenmann]], [[Johannes Grubenmann]], and others. The first book on bridge engineering was written by [[Hubert Gautier]] in 1716.

A major breakthrough in bridge technology came with the erection of [[the Iron Bridge]] in Shropshire, England in 1779. It used [[cast iron]] for the first time as arches to cross the river Severn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.engineering-timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=80 |title= Iron Bridge |author= &lt;!--"ECPK"--&gt; |date= |website= Engineering Timelines |publisher= Engineering Timelines |access-date= November 18, 2016 |quote= |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160304204815/http://www.engineering-timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=80 |archivedate= March 4, 2016 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the 19th century, [[truss]] systems of [[wrought iron]] were developed for larger bridges, but iron does not have the [[tensile strength]] to support large loads.

[[File:Ant bridge.jpg|thumb|''[[Eciton]]'' sp. forming a bridge]]
Before humans, [[ants#Locomotion|ants have been making bridges]] using their own bodies to allow others to cross.

==Types of bridges==
Bridges can be categorized in several different ways. Common categories include the type of structural elements used, by what they carry, whether they are fixed or movable, and by the materials used.

===Structure type===
Bridges may be classified by how the forces of [[tension (mechanics)|tension]], [[compression (physical)|compression]], [[bending]], [[torsion (mechanics)|torsion]] and [[Shear stress|shear]] are distributed through their structure. Most bridges will employ all of the principal forces to some degree, but only a few will predominate. The separation of forces may be quite clear. In a suspension or cable-stayed span, the elements in tension are distinct in shape and placement. In other cases the forces may be distributed among a large number of members, as in a truss.

|[[Beam bridges]] are horizontal beams supported at each end by substructure units and can be either ''[[simply supported]]'' when the beams only connect across a single span, or ''continuous'' when the beams are connected across two or more spans. When there are multiple spans, the intermediate supports are known as [[bridge pier|piers]]. The earliest beam bridges were simple logs that sat across streams and similar simple structures. In modern times, beam bridges can range from small, wooden beams to large, steel boxes. The vertical force on the bridge becomes a [[Shear stress|shear]] and [[Bending|flexural]] load on the beam which is transferred down its length to the substructures on either side&lt;ref name=beambridge&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.design-technology.org/beambridges.htm | title=Beam bridges | publisher=Design Technology | accessdate=May 14, 2008 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518121256/http://www.design-technology.org/beambridges.htm | archivedate=May 18, 2008 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are typically made of steel, concrete or wood. [[Girder bridge]]s and [[Plate girder bridge]]s, usually made from steel, are types of Beam bridges. [[Box girder bridge]]s, made from steel, concrete, or both are also beam bridges. Beam bridge spans rarely exceed {{convert|250|ft|m}} long, as the flexural stresses increase proportional to the square of the length (and deflection increases proportional to the 4th power of the length).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engineersedge.com/beam_bending/beam_bending1.htm Structural Beam Deflection Stress Bending Equations / Calculation Supported on Both Ends Uniform Loading] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130122060213/http://www.engineersedge.com/beam_bending/beam_bending1.htm |date=January 22, 2013 }}.

| style="text-align:center;"|[[File:TrussBridge-diagram.svg|200px]]'''Truss bridge'''{{br}}
| A truss bridge is a bridge whose load-bearing superstructure is composed of a truss. This truss is a structure of connected elements forming triangular units. The connected elements (typically straight) may be stressed from tension, compression, or sometimes both in response to dynamic loads. Truss bridges are one of the oldest types of modern bridges. The basic types of truss bridges shown in this article have simple designs which could be easily analyzed by nineteenth and early twentieth century engineers. A truss bridge is economical to construct owing to its efficient use of materials.
|-
| style="text-align:center;"|[[File:CantileverBridge-diagram.svg|200px]]'''Cantilever bridge'''{{br}}
|[[Cantilever bridge]]s are built using [[cantilever]]s—horizontal beams supported on only one end. Most cantilever bridges use a pair of [[continuous span]]s that extend from opposite sides of the supporting piers to meet at the center of the obstacle the bridge crosses. Cantilever bridges are constructed using much the same materials &amp; techniques as beam bridges. The difference comes in the action of the forces through the bridge.

Some cantilever bridges also have a smaller beam connecting the two cantilevers, for extra strength.

The largest cantilever bridge is the {{convert|549|m|adj=on}} [[Quebec Bridge]] in Quebec, Canada.

|Tied arch bridges have an arch-shaped superstructure, but differ from conventional arch bridges.

Sub-types include the [[simple suspension bridge]], the [[stressed ribbon bridge]], the [[underspanned suspension bridge]], the [[suspended-deck suspension bridge]], and the [[self-anchored suspension bridge]].

Most bridges are fixed bridges, meaning they have no moving parts and stay in one place until they fail or are demolished. Temporary bridges, such as [[Bailey bridge]]s, are designed to be assembled, and taken apart, transported to a different site, and re-used. They are important in military engineering, and are also used to carry traffic while an old bridge is being rebuilt. [[Movable bridge]]s are designed to move out of the way of boats or other kinds of traffic, which would otherwise be too tall to fit.

Double-decked (or double-decker) bridges have two levels, such as the [[George Washington Bridge]], connecting [[New York City]] to [[Bergen County]], [[New Jersey]], US, as the world's busiest bridge, carrying 102 million vehicles annually;&lt;ref name="panynj.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref name=abcgwb/&gt; [[truss]] work between the roadway levels provided stiffness to the roadways and reduced movement of the upper level when the lower level was installed three decades after the upper level. The [[Tsing Ma Bridge]] and [[Kap Shui Mun Bridge]] in [[Hong Kong]] have six lanes on their upper decks, and on their lower decks there are two lanes and a pair of tracks for [[MTR]] metro trains. Some double-decked bridges only use one level for street traffic; the [[Washington Avenue Bridge (Minneapolis)|Washington Avenue Bridge]] in [[Minneapolis]] reserves its lower level for automobile and light rail traffic and its upper level for pedestrian and bicycle traffic (predominantly students at the [[University of Minnesota]]). Likewise, in [[Toronto]], the [[Prince Edward Viaduct]] has five lanes of motor traffic, bicycle lanes, and sidewalks on its upper deck; and a pair of tracks for the [[Bloor–Danforth line|Bloor–Danforth]] [[Toronto subway and RT|subway line]] on its lower deck. The western span of the [[San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge]] also has two levels.

[[Robert Stephenson]]'s [[High Level Bridge]] across the [[River Tyne]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], completed in 1849, is an early example of a double-decked bridge. The upper level carries a railway, and the lower level is used for road traffic. Other examples include [[Britannia Bridge]] over the [[Menai Strait]] and [[Craigavon Bridge]] in [[Derry]], [[Northern Ireland]]. The [[Øresund Bridge|Oresund Bridge]] between [[Copenhagen]] and [[Malmö]] consists of a four-lane highway on the upper level and a pair of railway tracks at the lower level. [[Tower Bridge]] in London is different example of a double-decked bridge, with the central section consisting of a low level [[Bascule bridge|bascule span]] and a high level [[footbridge]].

===Viaducts===
{{main article|Viaduct}}
A viaduct is made up of multiple bridges connected into one longer structure. The longest and some of the highest bridges are viaducts, such as the [[Lake Pontchartrain Causeway]] and [[Millau Viaduct]].

===Three-way bridges===
[[File:Tridge Undercarriage.jpg|thumb|right|The three-way [[The Tridge (Midland, Michigan)|Tridge]]]]
{{main article|Three-way bridge}}
A three-way bridge has three separate spans which meet near the center of the bridge. The bridge appears as a "T" or "Y" when viewed from above. Three-way bridges are extremely rare. [[The Tridge (Midland, Michigan)|The Tridge]], [[Margaret Bridge]], and [[Y-Bridge (Zanesville, Ohio)|Zanesville Y-Bridge]] are examples.

===Bridge types by use===
A bridge can be categorized by what it is designed to carry, such as trains, pedestrian or road traffic ('''road bridge'''), a pipeline or waterway for water transport or barge traffic. An [[aqueduct (bridge)|aqueduct]] is a bridge that carries water, resembling a viaduct, which is a bridge that connects points of equal height. A road-rail bridge carries both road and rail traffic. Overway is a term for a bridge that separates incompatible intersecting traffic, especially road and rail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article170491612 |title=The Mile-End Crossing |newspaper=[[The Observer (Adelaide)|The Observer]] |volume=LXXXI, |issue=6,004 |location=South Australia |date=February 23, 1924 |accessdate=March 26, 2018 |page=16 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bridge can carry overhead power lines as does the [[Storstrøm Bridge]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Some bridges accommodate other purposes, such as the tower of [[Nový Most]] Bridge in [[Bratislava]], which features a restaurant, or a [[bridge-restaurant]] which is a bridge built to serve as a restaurant. Other suspension bridge towers carry transmission antennas.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Bridges are subject to unplanned uses as well. The areas underneath some bridges have become makeshift shelters and homes to homeless people, and the undertimbers of bridges all around the world are spots of prevalent graffiti. Some bridges attract people attempting [[suicide]], and become known as [[suicide bridge]]s.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Bridge types by material===
[[File:Ironbridge 6.jpg|thumb|[[The Iron Bridge]] completed in 1781 was the first cast iron bridge.]]

The materials used to build the structure are also used to categorize bridges. Until the end of the 18th Century, bridges were made out of timber, stone and masonry. Modern bridges are currently built in concrete, steel, fiber reinforced polymers (FRP), stainless steel or combinations of those materials. [[living root bridges|Living bridges]] have been constructed of live plants such as [[Ficus elastica]] tree roots in India&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://livingrootbridges.com/methods-of-creating-living-root-bridges/|title=How are Living Root Bridges Made?|date=May 5, 2017|work=The Living Root Bridge Project|access-date=September 8, 2017|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905002548/https://livingrootbridges.com/methods-of-creating-living-root-bridges/|archivedate=September 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[wisteria]] vines in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/vine-bridges-japan|title=The Vine Bridges of Iya Valley|website=Atlas Obscura|language=en|access-date=September 8, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908110829/http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/vine-bridges-japan|archivedate=September 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Aesthetics==
[[File:Stari_Most22.jpg|thumb|The World Heritage Site of [[Stari Most]] (Old Bridge) gives its name to the city of [[Mostar]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]]]
Most bridges are utilitarian in appearance, but in some cases, the appearance of the bridge can have great importance. Often, this is the case with a large bridge that serves as an entrance to a city, or crosses over a main harbor entrance. These are sometimes known as ''signature bridges''. Designers of bridges in parks and along parkways often place more importance to aesthetics, as well. Examples include the stone-faced bridges along the [[Taconic State Parkway]] in New York.

To create a beautiful image, some bridges are built much taller than necessary. This type, often found in east-Asian style gardens, is called a [[Moon bridge]], evoking a rising full moon. Other garden bridges may cross only a dry bed of stream washed pebbles, intended only to convey an impression of a stream. Often in palaces a bridge will be built over an artificial waterway as symbolic of a passage to an important place or state of mind. A set of five bridges cross a sinuous waterway in an important courtyard of the [[Forbidden City]] in [[Beijing]], [[China]]. The central bridge was reserved exclusively for the use of the Emperor, Empress, and their attendants.

==Bridge maintenance==
[[File:Example HiFIT-treated assembly.jpg|thumb|Highway bridge treated with [[high-frequency impact treatment]]]]
Bridge maintenance consisting of a combination of structural health monitoring and testing. This is regulated in country-specific engineer standards and includes e.g. an ongoing monitoring every three to six months, a simple test or inspection every two to three years and a major inspection every six to ten years. In Europe, the cost of maintenance is higher than spending on new bridges. The lifetime of welded steel bridges can be significantly extended by [[High Frequency Impact Treatment|aftertreatment of the weld transitions]] . This results in a potential high benefit, using existing bridges far beyond the planned lifetime.

==Bridge failures==
&lt;!-- [[bridge failure]] and [[bridge failures]] redirect here; be sure to update them if changing the section title --&gt;
{{see also|List of bridge failures}}

The failure of bridges is of special concern for [[structural engineers]] in trying to learn lessons vital to bridge design, construction and maintenance. The failure of bridges first assumed national interest during the [[Victorian era]] when many new designs were being built, often using new materials.

In the United States, the [[National Bridge Inventory]] tracks the structural evaluations of all bridges, including designations such as "structurally deficient" and "functionally obsolete".

==Bridge monitoring==
There are several methods used to monitor the stress on large structures like bridges. The most common method is the use of an [[accelerometer]], which is integrated into the bridge while it is being built. This technology is used for long-term surveillance of the bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mnme.com/pdf/smartbridge.pdf|title=The new Minnesota smart bridge|work=mnme.com|accessdate=January 30, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120823002008/http://www.mnme.com/pdf/smartbridge.pdf|archivedate=August 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another option for structural-integrity monitoring is "non-contact monitoring", which uses the [[Doppler effect]] (Doppler shift). A [[laser]] beam from a [[Laser Doppler Vibrometer]] is directed at the point of interest, and the vibration amplitude and frequency are extracted from the Doppler shift of the laser beam frequency due to the motion of the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polytec.com/us/solutions/vibration-measurement/basic-principles-of-vibrometry/|title=Basic Principles of Vibrometry|work=polytec.com|accessdate=January 25, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610192737/http://www.polytec.com/us/solutions/vibration-measurement/basic-principles-of-vibrometry/|archivedate=June 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advantage of this method is that the setup time for the equipment is faster and, unlike an accelerometer, this makes measurements possible on multiple structures in as short a time as possible.  Additionally, this method can measure specific points on a bridge that might be difficult to access.

Snapshots in time of the external condition of a bridge can be recorded using [[Lidar]] to aid bridge inspection.&lt;ref name="omer"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Omer | display-authors = et. al. | year = 2018 | title = Performance evaluation of bridges using virtual reality | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325194259 | journal = Proceedings of the 6th European Conference on Computational Mechanics (ECCM 6) &amp; 7th European Conference on Computational Fluid Dynamics (ECFD 7), Glasgow, Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Caisson Schematic.svg|thumb|350px|Schematic cross section of a pressurized caisson]]
In [[geotechnical engineering]], a '''caisson''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|eɪ|s|ə|n|}} &lt;small&gt;or&lt;/small&gt; {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|eɪ|s|ɒ|n|}}) is a watertight retaining structure&lt;ref&gt;"Caisson" def. 3. Knight, Edward Henry. ''Knight's American mechanical dictionary A description of tools, instruments, machines, processes, and engineering; history of inventions; general technological vocabulary; and digest of mechanical appliances in science and the arts''. vol. 1 Boston: Houghton, Mifflin and Co., 1877. 420. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; used, for example, to work on the [[foundation (architecture)|foundations]] of a [[bridge]] [[pier (architecture)|pier]], for the construction of a concrete [[dam]],&lt;ref&gt;Aichel, Ordulf George. ''The caisson as a new element in concrete dam construction; a proposal made in connection with the Columbia River Power Project'',. New York: Spon &amp; Chamberlain; [etc.], 1916. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; or for the repair of [[ship]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Theodore Delavan, and Edward J. Reed. ''An outline of ship building, theoretical and practical''.. New York: J. Wiley &amp; son, 1873. 383. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; These are constructed such that the water can be pumped out, keeping the working environment dry. When piers are being built using an open caisson, and it is not practical to reach suitable soil, [[Deep foundation|friction pilings]] may be driven to form a suitable sub-foundation. These piles are connected by a foundation pad upon which the column pier is erected.

==Etymology==
Borrowed from French ''caisson'', from Italian ''cassone'', meaning ''large box'', an augmentative of ''cassa''.

== How caissons work ==

Shallow caissons may be open to the air, whereas '''pneumatic caissons''', which penetrate soft [[mud]], are sealed at the top and filled with compressed air to keep water and mud out at depth. An [[airlock]] allows access to the chamber. Workers move mud and rock debris (called ''muck'') from the edge of the workspace to a water-filled pit, connected by a tube (called the ''muck tube'') to the surface. A [[crane (machine)|crane]] at the surface removes the soil with a [[clamshell bucket]]. The water pressure in the tube balances the air pressure, with excess air escaping up the muck tube. The pressurized air flow must be constant to ensure regular air changes for the workers and prevent excessive inflow of mud or water at the base of the caisson.

=== Installation ===
To install a caisson in place, it is brought down through soft mud until a suitable foundation material is encountered. While [[bedrock]] is preferred, a stable, hard mud is sometimes used when bedrock is too deep.

=== Dangers encountered in pressurized caissons ===
Construction workers who leave the pressurized environment of the caisson must [[Decompression (physics)|decompress]] at a rate that allows symptom-free release of inert gases dissolved in the body tissues if they are to avoid [[decompression sickness]], a condition first identified in caisson workers, and originally named "Caisson disease" in recognition of the occupational hazard. Construction of the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], which was built with the help of pressurised caissons, resulted in numerous workers being either killed or permanently injured by caisson disease during its construction.&lt;ref name=Brooklyn&gt;{{cite journal |author=Butler WP |title=Caisson disease during the construction of the Eads and Brooklyn Bridges: A review |journal=Undersea Hyperb Med |volume=31 |issue=4 |pages=445–59 |year=2004 |pmid=15686275 |doi= |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/4028 |accessdate=2008-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barotrauma]] of the ears, sinus cavities and lungs and [[dysbaric osteonecrosis]] are other risks.&lt;ref&gt;Stellman, Jeanne Mager. ''Encyclopaedia of occupational health and safety''. 4th ed. Geneva: International Labor Office, 1998. 36.5. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other uses ===
Caissons have also been used in the installation of hydraulic [[elevator]]s where a single-stage ram is installed below the ground level.{{clarify|date=June 2017}}

Caissons, codenamed ''[[Phoenix breakwaters|Phoenix]]'', were an integral part of the [[Mulberry harbour]]s used during the World War II Allied [[invasion of Normandy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|title=The story of the Mulberry harbours|url=http://www.arromanches-museum.com/ports/|website=arromanches-museum.com|publisher=Musée de Débarquement|accessdate=1 June 2017|location=Arromanches}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
The four main types of caisson are ''box caisson'', ''open caisson'', ''pneumatic caisson'' and ''monolith caisson''.&lt;ref&gt;Chudley, R.. ''Advanced construction technology''. 5th ed. Oxford: Pearson, 2012. 173. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Box ===

A ''box caisson'' is a prefabricated concrete box (it has sides and a bottom); it is set down on prepared bases.  Once in place, it is filled with concrete to become part of the permanent works, such as the foundation for a bridge pier. Hollow concrete structures are usually less dense than water so a box caisson must be ballasted or anchored to keep it from floating until it can be filled with concrete.  Sometimes elaborate anchoring systems may be required, such as in [[tidal zone]]s.  Adjustable anchoring systems combined with a GPS survey enable engineers to position a box caisson with pinpoint accuracy.

=== Open ===
&lt;!--Open caisson redirects here--&gt;
An ''open caisson'' is similar to a box caisson, except that it does not have a bottom face. It is suitable for use in soft clays (e.g. in some river-beds), but not for where there may be large obstructions in the ground. An open caisson that is used in soft grounds or high water tables, where open trench excavations are impractical, can also be used to install deep manholes, pump stations and reception/launch pits for [[Microtunneling|micro tunnelling]], pipe jacking and other operations.

A caisson is sunk by self-weight, concrete or water ballast placed on top, or by hydraulic jacks. The leading edge (or ''cutting shoe'') of the caisson is sloped out at a sharp angle to aid sinking in a vertical manner; it is usually made of steel. The shoe is generally wider than the caisson to reduce friction, and the leading edge may be supplied with pressurised [[bentonite]] slurry, which swells in water, stabilizing settlement by filling depressions and voids. An open caisson may fill with water during sinking. The material is excavated by clamshell excavator bucket on crane.

The formation level subsoil may still not be suitable for excavation or [[bearing capacity]]. The water in the caisson (due to a high water table) balances the upthrust forces of the soft soils underneath. If dewatered, the base may "pipe" or "boil",{{clarify|reason=describe "pipe" and "boil" in this context|date=June 2017}} causing the caisson to sink. To combat this problem, piles may be driven from the surface to act as:
* [[Load-bearing wall]]s, in that they transmit loads to deeper soils.
* Anchors, in that they resist flotation because of the friction at the interface between their surfaces and the surrounding earth into which they have been driven.
H-beam sections (typical column sections, due to resistance to bending in all axis) may be driven at angles "raked" to rock or other firmer soils; the H-beams are left extended above the base. A reinforced concrete plug may be placed under the water, a process known as [[Tremie|''Tremie concrete placement'']]. When the caisson is dewatered, this plug acts as a pile cap, resisting the upward forces of the subsoil.

=== Pneumatic ===

A ''pneumatic (compressed-air) caisson'' has the advantage of providing dry working conditions, which is better for placing concrete. It is also well suited for foundations for which other methods might cause settlement of adjacent structures.

=== Monolithic ===

A ''monolithic caisson'' (or just simply a ''monolith'') is larger than the other types of caisson, but similar to open caissons. Such caissons are often found in quay walls, where resistance to impact from ships is required.

== Boat lift caissons ==	

The word ''caisson'' is also used as a [[synonym]] for the moving trough part of [[caisson lock]]s, [[Boat lift|canal lifts]] and [[Canal inclined plane|inclines]] in which boats and ships rest while being lifted from one [[canal]] elevation to another; the water is retained on the inside of the caisson, or excluded from the caisson, according to the respective operating principle.

== Structural caissons ==

''Caisson'' is also sometimes used as a colloquial term for a reinforced concrete structure formed by pouring into a hollow cylindrical form, typically by placing a caisson form below grade in an open excavation and pouring once backfill is complete, or by drilling at grade, although this can be problematic with deep caissons, as unsupported excavations can collapse before the caisson form can be inserted. In this manner, the earth placed around the empty caisson form provides stability and strength, allowing concrete to be poured with fewer complications and with less risk of a form blowout. While, technically, only the form itself is actually a caisson, it is not uncommon for any below-grade cast concrete pillar to be referred to as, simply, a ''caisson''.

== Ventilation filtration systems ==

The word ''caisson'' is also used as a name for an airtight housing for ventilation filters in facilities that handle hazardous materials.  The housing usually has an upstream compartment for a pre-filter element and a downstream compartment for a high-efficiency filter element.  It may have multiple sets of compartments.  The housing has gasketed access doors to allow for the change out of the filter elements.  The housing is usually equipped with connection points used to test the efficiency of the filters and monitor changes in the differential pressure across the filter media.

A '''calligram''' is a text visually arranged in a way that it forms an image associated with the text's contents. It can be a [[Poetry|poem]], a phrase, a portion of [[scripture]], or a single word; the visual arrangement can rely on certain use of the [[typeface]], [[calligraphy]] or [[handwriting]], for instance along non-parallel and curved text lines, or in shaped paragraphs. The image created by the words illustrates the text by expressing visually what it says, or something closely associated; it can also, on purpose, show something contradictory with the text or otherwise misleading.

[[Guillaume Apollinaire]] was a famous calligram writer and author of a book of poems called ''[[Calligrammes]]''.

__NOTOC__
'''Categorical logic''' is the branch of [[mathematics]] in which tools and concepts from [[category theory]] are applied to the study of [[mathematical logic]]. It is also notable for its connections to [[theoretical computer science]]. In broad terms, categorical logic represents both syntax and semantics by a [[category (mathematics)|category]], and an [[Interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] by a [[functor]].  The categorical framework provides a rich conceptual background for logical and [[type theory|type-theoretic]] constructions. The subject has been recognisable in these terms since around 1970.

== Overview ==

There are three important&lt;!--to computer science --&gt; themes in the categorical approach to logic:
;Categorical semantics: Categorical logic introduces the notion of ''structure valued in a category'' C with the classical [[model theory|model theoretic]] notion of a structure appearing in the particular case where C is the [[Category of sets|category of sets and functions]]. This notion has proven useful when the set-theoretic notion of a model lacks generality and/or is inconvenient. [[R.A.G. Seely]]'s modeling of various [[impredicative]] theories, such as [[system F]] is an example of the usefulness of categorical semantics.

:It was found that the connectives of pre-categorical logic were more clearly understood using the concept of adjoint functor, and that the quantifiers were also best understood using adjoint functors.&lt;ref&gt;Lawvere, Quantifiers and Sheaves&lt;/ref&gt;

;Internal languages: This can be seen as a formalization and generalization of proof by [[diagram chasing]]. One defines a suitable internal language naming relevant constituents of a category, and then applies categorical semantics to turn assertions in a logic over the internal language into corresponding categorical statements. This has been most successful in the theory of [[topos]]es, where the internal language of a topos together with the semantics of intuitionistic higher-order logic in a topos enables one to reason about the objects and morphisms of a topos "as if they were sets and functions".{{Citation needed|reason=if this is an actual quote, who said it?|date=July 2015}} This has been successful in dealing with toposes that have "sets" with properties incompatible with classical logic. A prime example is [[Dana Scott]]'s model of [[untyped lambda calculus]] in terms of objects that retract onto their own function space. Another is the Moggi–Hyland model of [[system F]] by an internal [[full subcategory]] of the [[effective topos]] of [[Martin Hyland]].
;Term-model constructions: In many cases, the categorical semantics of a logic provide a basis for establishing a correspondence between [[Theory (mathematical logic)|theories]] in the logic and instances of an appropriate kind of category. A classic example is the correspondence between theories of [[beta reduction|βη]]-[[equational logic]] over [[simply typed lambda calculus]] and [[Cartesian closed category|Cartesian closed categories]]. Categories arising from theories via term-model constructions can usually be characterized up to [[Equivalence of categories|equivalence]] by a suitable [[universal property]]. This has enabled proofs of [[Metalogic|meta-theoretical]] properties of some logics by means of an appropriate [[:Category:monoidal categories|categorical algebra]]&lt;!--no good article--&gt;. For instance, [[Peter J. Freyd|Freyd]] gave a proof of the existence and disjunction properties of [[intuitionistic logic]] this way.

'''Climate commitment''' describes the fact that [[climate]] reacts with a delay to influencing factors ("[[climate forcing]]s") such as the presence of [[greenhouse gas]]es. Climate commitment studies attempt to assess the amount of future [[global warming]] that is "committed" under the assumption of some constant level of forcings. The constant level often used for illustrative purposes is [[carbon dioxide|{{CO2}}]] doubling or quadrupling; or the present level of forcing.

== Basic idea ==
If a [[wiktionary:perturbation|perturbation]] — such as an increase in greenhouse gases or [[solar variation|solar activity]] — is applied to the [[climate system]] the response will not be immediate, principally because of the large [[heat capacity]] (i.e., [[Volumetric heat capacity#Thermal inertia|thermal inertia]]) of the [[ocean]]s. 
:''As an analogue, consider the heating of a thin metal plate (by the sun or by a flame): the plate will warm relatively quickly. If a  thick metal block is heated instead, it will take much longer for the entire block to reach [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]] with the imposed heating because of its higher heat capacity.''
Land only stores [[heat]] in the top few meters. 
Ocean water, by contrast, can move vertically and store heat within the ocean's depth ([[convection]]). 
This is why the land surface is observed to warm more than the oceans. It also explains the very large difference in response between 
* "equilibrium" climate prediction [[Execution (computers)|runs]] in which only a shallow ocean is used and it is assumed that the climate has come to equilibrium and 
* "[[Transient state|transient]]" climate prediction runs in which a full ocean is used and the climate is out of balance.

The "commitment" can apply to variables other than temperature: because of the long mixing time for heat into the deep ocean, a given surface warming commits to centuries of [[sea level rise]] from thermal expansion of the ocean. Also once a certain threshold is crossed, it is likely that a slow melting of the Greenland ice sheet will commit us to a sea level rise of 5m over millennia.

== Models ==
{{main|global climate model}}
Recent [[model (abstract)|model]]s forecast that even in the unlikely event of greenhouse gases stabilizing at present levels, the earth would warm by an additional 0.5°C by 2100, a similar rise in temperature to that seen during the 20th century.  In 2050, as much as 64% of that commitment would be due to ''past'' natural forcings.  Over time, their contribution compared to the human influence will diminish.  Overall, the warming commitment at 2005 greenhouse gas levels could exceed 1°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wigley |first=T. M. L. |title=The Climate Change Commitment |journal=Science |volume=307 |issue=5716 |pages=1766–9 |date=17 March 2005 |doi=10.1126/science.1103934 |pmid=15774756 |url=ftp://ftp.soest.hawaii.edu/coastal/Climate%20Articles/Wigley_2005%20Sea%20level%20commitment.pdf |format=PDF|bibcode=2005Sci...307.1766W }}&lt;/ref&gt; As ocean waters expand in response to this warming, global [[sea level]]s would mount by about 10 centimeters during that time. These models do not take into account [[ice cap]] and [[glacier]] melting; including those [[climate feedback]] effects would give a 1–1.5°C estimated temperature increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nature.com/news/2005/050314/full/050314-13.html |title= Oceans extend effects of climate change |first=Deirdre |last=Lockwood  |date= 2005-05-17 |work=Nature News |publisher= [[Nature Publishing Group]] |doi=10.1038/news050314-13}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
This is by no means a new idea, the concept is discussed in the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] [[IPCC Third Assessment Report|TAR]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20071231162245/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/008.htm] and in the [[IPCC_Second_Assessment_Report|SAR]] in 1995.

The intention is that this understanding will prevent students from contracting [[sexually transmitted infections]] in the future, including [[HIV]] and [[HPV]]. CSE is also designed with the intention of reducing teenage and unwanted pregnancies, as well as lowering rates of domestic and [[sexual violence]], thus contributing to a healthier society, both physically and mentally.&lt;ref name="Loeber 2010 169–176"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loeber|first=O.|author2=Reuter, S. |author3=Apter, van der Doef |author4=Lazdane, Pinter |title=Aspects of sexuality education in Europe – definitions, differences and developments|journal=European Journal of Contraception &amp; Reproductive Health Care|date=June 2010|volume=15|issue=3|pages=169–176|pmid=20465399|doi=10.3109/13625181003797280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comprehensive sex education ultimately promotes [[sexual abstinence]] as the safest sexual choice for young people. However, CSE curriculums and teachers are still committed to teaching students about topics connected to future sexual activity, such as [[age of consent]], [[safe sex]], [[Birth control|contraception]] such as: [[birth control]], [[abortion]], and use of [[condoms]].&lt;ref name=":27"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rubenstein|first=Rachel|date=January 1, 2017|title=Sex Education: Funding Facts, Not Fear|url=http://p8888-ucelinks.cdlib.org.libproxy.berkeley.edu/sfx_local?genre=article&amp;atitle=Sex%20Education%3A%20Funding%20Facts%2C%20Not%20Fear%20%5Bnotes%5D&amp;title=Health%20Matrix:%20Journal%20of%20Law-Medicine&amp;issn=0748383X&amp;isbn=&amp;volume=27&amp;issue=&amp;date=20170101&amp;aulast=Rubenstein,%20Rachel&amp;spage=525&amp;pages=&amp;sid=EBSCO:HeinOnline:hein.journals.hmax27.19#|journal=Health Matrix: Journal of Law-Medicine.|volume=27|pages=525–553|via=MasterFILE Premier}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This also includes discussions which promote safe behaviors, such as communicating with partners and seeking testing for sexually transmitted infections. Additionally, comprehensive sex education curricula may include discussions surrounding pregnancy outcomes such as parenting, adoption, and abortion.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; The most widely agreed benefit of using comprehensive sex education over [[abstinence-only sex education]] is that CSE acknowledges the student population will be sexually active in their future. By acknowledging this, CSE can encourage students to plan ahead to make the healthiest possible sexual decisions.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/comprehensive-sexuality-education|title=Comprehensive sexuality education|last=|first=|date=|website=www.unfpa.org|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ideology of arming students to most successfully survive their future sexual experiences underlies the majority of topics within CSE, including condoms, contraception, and refusal skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aclunc.org/docs/executive_summary_-_2003_statewide_school_district_survey.pdf|title=Sex Education in California Public Schools: Are Students Learning What They Need to Know?|last=Burlingame|first=Julianne|date=August 2003|website=www.aclu.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits of CSE ==
Studies have found that comprehensive sex education is more effective than receiving no instruction and/or those who receive abstinence-only instruction.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; Acknowledging that people may engage in premarital sex rather than ignoring it (which abstinence-only is often criticized for) allows educators to give the students the necessary information to safely navigate their future sexual lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://advocatesforyouth.org/publications/1487|title=Comprehensive Sex Education: Research and Results|date=2010-12-08|website=advocatesforyouth.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208154235/http://advocatesforyouth.org/publications/1487|archive-date=December 8, 2010|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

CSE advocates argue that promoting abstinence without accompanied information regarding safe sex practices is a disregard of reality, and is ultimately putting the student at risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.futureofsexed.org/compacademic.html|title=Comprehensive Sex Education and Academic Success|date=2015-02-26|website=www.futureofsexed.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226100613/http://www.futureofsexed.org/compacademic.html|archive-date=February 26, 2015|deadurl=yes|access-date=2016-07-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, programs funded under AEGP are reviewed for compliance with the 8 standards (listed below in "Abstinence Education Grant Program (AGEP) Requirements), but are not screened for medical accuracy. Therefore, critics believe that students under these educational programs are put at a disadvantage because it prevents them from making informed choices about their sexual health. Additionally, under these AEGP programs, health educators have referred to those that engage in sex, especially females, as "dirty" and "used." They have also used phrases such as "stay like a new toothbrush, wrapped up and unused"  and "chewed-up gum" to teach abstinence. Under a CSE model, language would be more sensitive.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

There is clear evidence that CSE has a positive impact on sexual and reproductive health (SRH), notably in contributing to reducing [[Sexually transmitted infection|STIs]], HIV and [[unintended pregnancy]]. Sexuality education does not hasten sexual activity but has a positive impact on safer sexual behaviours and can delay sexual debut.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2009.

Doi: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal&lt;/nowiki&gt;. pone.0089692&lt;/ref&gt; A Cochrane review of 41 randomized controlled trials in Europe, the United States, Nigeria and Mexico also confirmed that CSE prevents unintended adolescent pregnancies.&lt;ref&gt;Oringanje, C. et al. 2009. ''Interventions for preventing unintended pregnancies among adolescents''. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Issue 4.&lt;/ref&gt; CSE is very beneficial in regards to teen pregnancy because studies show that, teen pregnancy and childbearing have a significant negative impact on high school success and completion, as well as future job prospects.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; A study in Kenya, involving more than 6,000 students who had received sexuality education led to delayed sexual initiation, and increased condom use among those who were sexually active once these students reached secondary school compared to more than 6,000 students who did not receive sexuality education.&lt;ref&gt;Maticka-Tyndale, E. 2010.

[[Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS|UNAIDS]] and the [[African Union]] have recognized CSE’s impact on increasing condom use, voluntary HIV testing and reducing pregnancy among adolescent girls and have included comprehensive, age-appropriate sexuality education as one of the key recommendations to fast track the HIV response and end the AIDS epidemic among young women and girls in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;UNAIDS and the African Union. 2015.

As the field of sexuality education develops, there is increasing focus on addressing gender, power relations and human rights in order to improve the impact on SRH outcomes. Integrating content on gender and rights makes sexuality education even more effective.&lt;ref&gt;UNFPA. 2014a.

New York, UNFPA. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/&lt;/nowiki&gt; les/pub-pdf/UNFPA%20Operational%20Guidance%20for%20 CSE%20-Final%20WEB%20Version.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A review of 22 curriculum- based sexuality education programmes found that 80 per cent of programmes that addressed gender or power relations were associated with a significant decrease in pregnancy, childbearing or STIs. These programmes were five times as effective as those programmes that did not address gender or power.&lt;ref&gt;Haberland, N.A. 2015.

The impact of CSE also increases when delivered together with efforts to expand access to a full range of high- quality, youth-friendly services and commodities, particularly in relation to contraceptive choice.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2011a.

A global review of evidence in the education sector also found that teaching sexuality education builds confidence,&lt;ref&gt;Unterhalter, E., North, A., Arnot, M., Lloyd, C., Moletsane, L., Murphy-Graham, E., Parkes, J. and Saito, M. 2014.

CSE has a demonstrated impact on improving knowledge, self-esteem, changing attitudes, gender and social norms, and building self-efficacy.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Criticism of CSE ==

=== How comprehensive is CSE ===
While CSE implementation is on the rise in the United States, it remains difficult for state officials to regulate what is and is not taught in the classroom. This is due in large part to the undefinability of CSE; CSE has the potential to comprise such a wide range of sexual information, and over-all focus varies widely between curriculums.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Educators have also accused CSE as fundamentally operating as a form of "abstinence-plus," due to the reality that CSE often involves minimal body related information and excessive promotions of abstinence.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sex Ed for Caring Schools Creating an Ethics-Based Curriculum|last=Lamb|first=Sharon|publisher=Teachers College Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "So-called Comprehensive Sex Ed" says Sharon Lamb, a professor at the University of Massachusetts Boston, "has been made less comprehensive as curricula are revised to meet current federal, state, and local requirements."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== LGBTQIA+ community not included CSE ====
The term "comprehensive" is also often misleading because some comprehensive programs do not show the holistic picture of human sexuality.&lt;ref name=":45"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Curvino|first=Melissa and Meghan Grizzle Fischer|date=April 21, 2015|title=Claiming Comprehensive Sex Education is a Right Does Not Make it So|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=16&amp;sid=e0097ff0-d647-4666-83a3-1229b73b3d13%40sessionmgr120|journal=The New Bioethics|volume=20|issue=1|pages=72–98|via=Taylor and Francis Online|pmid=24979877}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[LGBT|LGBTQIA+]] advocates have long been critical of the ways in which comprehensive sex education generally promotes marriage as the end goal for students. Even when curriculums claim to be inclusive of LGBT experiences, they often promote heteronormative lifestyles as "normal." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Erevelles|first=Nirmala|date=2011|title=Coming Out Crip in Inclusive Education|url=|journal=Teachers College Record|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inclusion of LGBT identities and health topics is necessary for LGBTQIA+ students to feel safe and seen in their sex ed classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Risky Lessons|last=Fields|first=Jessica|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When these students do not have access to or an interest in marriage they are practically erased from the CSE narrative. 

A cross sectional study done in New York City analyzed the sexual behaviors of high school girls. Studies found that, "high school girls who identified as LGBTQIA+ were more likely to report substance use such as: alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, heroin, meth, ecstasy and prescription drugs. They also had higher rates of contemplating and/or attempting suicide."&lt;ref name=":52"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cobel M.D|first=Chanelle et. al|date=August 2017|title=Description of Sexual Orientation and Sexual Behaviors among High School Girls in New York City|url=https://www-sciencedirect-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/science/article/pii/S1083318817300980?via%3Dihub|journal=Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology|volume=30|issue=4|pages=460–465|via=Elsevier ScienceDirect|pmid=28279826|doi=10.1016/j.jpag.2017.02.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that "the LGBTQIA+ youth accesses health information online five times more than the [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] population, and these rates are even higher for LGBTQIA+ youth that identify as a person of color which stems from the fact that they lack health resources. &lt;ref name=":34"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Manduley|first=Aida, et al|date=February 8, 2018|title=The role of social media in sex education: Dispatches from queer, trans, and racialized communities|url=http://journals.sagepub.com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/doi/abs/10.1177/0959353517717751|journal=Feminism &amp; Psychology|volume=28|pages=152–170|via=SAGE Journals|doi=10.1177/0959353517717751}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, as of May 2018, only 12 states require discussion of sexual orientation and of these, only 9 states require that discussion of sexual orientation be inclusive.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/sex-and-hiv-education|title=State Laws and Policies Regarding Sex and HIV Education|last=|first=|date=2018-05-01|website=|publisher=Guttmacher Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, several states have passed legislation that bans teachers from discussing gay and transgender issues, such as sexual health and HIV/AIDS awareness, in a positive light.&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt; Furthermore, three states require that teachers only portray LGBTQIA+ people in a negative light.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In a Canada, a federal report showed that LGBTQIA+ community has less access to health services and faces more comprehensive health challenges compared to the general population. As a result of lack of support for the LGBTQIA+ population, the Comprehensive Health Education Workers (CHEW) Project emerged in October 2014. Their goal is to educate the LGBTQIA+ community  about topics such  sexual and gender identity, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), healthy social relationships, and depression. They do this though workshops, arts‐based projects, and one‐on‐one meetings.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lévesque|first=Michel|date=November 29, 2017|title=The Comprehensive Health Education Workers Project and Caring Professionals as Asset‐Builders|url=https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/doi/full/10.1002/nha3.20200|journal=New Horizons in Adult Education and Human Resource Development|volume=29|issue=4|pages=51–55|via=Wiley Online Library|doi=10.1002/nha3.20200}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Who's role is it to deliver sexual education ===
Many people regard health education as a moral or religious issue, and therefore should be taught not in schools.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; "Before the late 1800s, delivering sex education in the United States and Canada was primarily seen as a parent’s responsibility.&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt; Today, programs under the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States (SIECUS) begin comprehensive sex education in pre-kindergarten, which many people believe is not age appropriate.&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt; Many of those in favor of abstinence only education, usually fear any type of sexual education that encourages sexual behavior at a young age.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

=== Is it necessary ===
Although CSE is seen as the polar opposite of abstinence only education, some critics believe that they are very similar. They both aim at preventing STIs and teen pregnancy. The only way in which they differ is through their primary goal. Abstinence only education aims at reducing premarital sex while comprehensive sex education acknowledges that premarital sex may happen and therefore seeks to reduce the unintended consequences of premarital sex through education.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; Studies in developing counties surrounding sex education have also shown that comprehensive sex education is not needed. General education, such as literacy skills, was seen to delay sexual initiation and reduced the likelihood of pregnancy. Therefore, some people believe general education is of more importance.&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt;

== Federal funding for sexual education ==
Although there is no federal mandate that requires states to teach sexual education, there is federal funding available to assist with sexual education programs.&lt;ref name=":63"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malone|first=Patrick and Monica Rodriguez|date=Spring 2011|title=Comprehensive Sex Education vs. Abstinence-Only-Until-Marriage Programs|url=https://www-jstor-org.libproxy.berkeley.edu/stable/23032415|journal=Human Rights|volume=38|pages=5-22|via=JSTOR Journals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abstinence Education Grant Program (AGEP) ===
Historically, funding for abstinence education has always been favored over CSE. In 1996, during Bill Clinton's presidency, legislation was passed to promote abstinence in education programs. Under Title V Section 510 of the Social Security Act, the Abstinence Education Grant Program (AGEP), was passed. AEGP has always been renewed before its expiration date, and each time funds gradually increase from fifty million dollars per year to seventy-five and as high as $6.75 million per state grant in 2015. The way the funds are disbursed are based on the proportion of low-income children in each state. So far, thirty-six states have been given AEGP funds.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

==== Abstinence Education Grant Program (AGEP) Requirements ====
Part of Section 510(b) of Title V of the Social Security Act, contains the "A-H guidelines," which are the eight criteria that programs must abide by order to be eligible to receive federal funding.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; They are as follows:

A. Has as its exclusive purpose teaching the social, psychological, and health gains to be realized by abstaining from sexual activity;

B. Teaches abstinence from sexual activity outside marriage as the expected standard for all school-age children;

C. Teaches that abstinence from sexual activity is the only certain way to avoid out-of-wedlock pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, and other associated health problems;&lt;p&gt;D. Teaches that a mutually faithful, monogamous relationship in the context of marriage is the expected standard of sexual activity;&lt;/p&gt;E. Teaches that sexual activity outside the context of marriage is likely to have harmful psychological and physical effects;

F. Teaches that bearing children out of wedlock is likely to have harmful consequences for the child, the child's parents, and society;&lt;p&gt;G. Teaches young people how to reject sexual advances and how alcohol and drug use increase vulnerability to sexual advances; and&lt;/p&gt;H. Teaches the importance of attaining self-sufficiency before engaging in sexual activity;&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;

In addition to abiding by these 8 conditions, AGEP compliant programs cannot discuss contraception, STIs, or methods for protecting against STIs, except only when describing failure rates.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

=== Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program (TPP) ===
More recently legislation has pushed for funding that goes beyond abstinence only education.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; In 2010, President Obama introduced the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program (TPP),  which provides a total of $114.5 million annually to sex education programs that are "medically accurate and age-appropriate."&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; TPP falls under a subsection of United States Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS") which is overseen by the Office of Adolescent Health. Funding for TPP is dispersed if "they emulate specific evidence-based programs promulgated under TPP."&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; 

=== California Comprehensive Sexual Health and HIV/AIDS Prevention Education Act ===
In January 2016, the California Healthy Youth Act, amended the California Comprehensive Sexual Health and HIV/AIDS Prevention Education Act to include minority groups and expand health education. Before it authorized schools to provide comprehensive sex education and required that all materials are made accessible to students with a variety of needs. It also focused solely on marital relationships. It now mandates that schools provide comprehensive sex education and states that "materials cannot be biased and must be appropriate for students of all races, genders, sexual orientations, and ethnic and cultural backgrounds, as well as those with disabilities and English language learners." Additionally, education must now include "instruction about forming healthy and respectful committed relationships," regardless if marital status. Furthermore, it is now required to have discussions about all FDA-approved contraceptive methods in preventing pregnancy, including the morning after pill.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

In conclusion now requires that all sex education programs promulgated in the state should&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

*normalize sexuality as part of human development;
*ensure people receive integrated, comprehensive, accurate, and unbiased sexual health and HIV prevention and  instruction; and
*provide pupils with the knowledge and skills to have healthy, positive, and safe relationships.

== CSE as a human right ==
Some critics state that young people’s access to CSE is grounded in internationally recognized [[human rights]], which require governments to guarantee the overall protection of health, well-being and dignity, as per the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|Universal Declaration on Human Rights]], and specifically to guarantee the provision of unbiased, scientifically accurate sexuality education.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002431/243106e.pdf|title=Emerging evidence, lessons and practice in comprehensive sexuality education: A global review 2015|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100139-0|location=|pages=14, 15, 25, 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These rights are protected by internationally ratified treaties, and lack of access to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) education remains a barrier to complying with the obligations to ensure the rights to life, health, non-discrimination and information, a view that has been supported by the Statements of the [[Committee on the Rights of the Child]], the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (CEDAW) Committee, and the [[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The commitment of individual states to realizing these rights has been reaffirmed by the international community, in particular the [[Commission on Population and Development]] (CPD), which – in its resolutions 2009/12 and 2012/13 – called on governments to provide young people with comprehensive education on human sexuality, SRH and [[gender equality]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Other analysis show that comprehensive sex education is not an international right nor a human right because it not clearly stated in either a treaty nor custom. By international law, states are required to provide access to information and education about reproductive health, but this does not require a sex education curriculum. It may take different forms such as mandating that local school districts create a system for providing information to students, or mandating that health clinics and practitioners dispense information to patients.&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt;

== CSE in curricula ==

=== CSE teaching methods ===
As CSE gains momentum and interest at international, regional and national levels, governments are increasingly putting in place measures to scale-up their delivery of some form of life skills-based sexuality education, as well as seeking guidance on best practice, particularly regarding placement within the school [[curriculum]]. Sexuality education may be delivered as a stand-alone subject or integrated across relevant subjects within the school curricula. These options have direct implications for implementation, including teacher training, the ease of evaluating and revising curricula, the likelihood of curricula being delivered, and the methods through which it is delivered.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Within countries, choices about implementing integrated or stand-alone sexuality education are typically linked to national policies and overall organization of the curricula. The evidence base on the effectiveness of stand-alone vs. integrated sexuality education programming is still limited. However, there are discernible differences for policy-makers to consider when deciding the position of CSE within the curriculum.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

As a stand-alone subject, sexuality education is set apart from the rest of the curriculum, whether on its own or within a broader stand-alone health and life skills curriculum. This makes it more vulnerable to potentially being sacrificed due to time and budget constraints, since school curricula are typically overcrowded.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

However, a stand-alone curriculum also presents opportunities for specialized teacher training pathways, and the use of non-formal teaching methodologies that aim to build learners’ critical thinking skills. The pedagogical approaches promoted through sexuality education – such as learner-centred methodologies, development of skills and values, group learning and peer engagement – are increasingly being recognized as transformative approaches that impact on learning and education more widely. As a standalone subject, it is also significantly easier to monitor, which is crucial in terms of evaluating the effectiveness of programming, and revising curricula where it is not delivering the desired learning outcomes.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

When sexuality education is integrated or infused, it is mainstreamed across a number of subject areas, such as biology, social studies, home economics or religious studies. While this model may reduce pressure on an overcrowded curriculum, it is difficult to monitor or evaluate, and may limit teaching methodologies to traditional approaches.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== CSE terminology ===
Apart from the different teaching methods, termiology also differs. Abortion, homosexuality, abstinence have connotations and definitions that vary state. For example, the word "abstinence" may refer to disengaging from all forms of sexual activities until marriage or may refer to only disengaging from sexual intercourse. Furthermore, the degree of sexual activity that "abstinence" connotates is often unclear, because sexual behavior that is not sexual intercourse may or may not be included in its definition. As a result, students are left confused about what activities are risky and teachers do not know what they can and cannot teach.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

The term "comprehensive," is also falls on spectrum, therefore can be considered an umbrella term. CSE means something radical for some institutions while it can mean something moderate and even conservative for others.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sex Ed Debates|last=Kendall|first=Nancy|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=Chicago and London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States (SIECUS), the guidelines for comprehensive sexuality education are as follows:&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;appropriate to the age, developmental level, and cultural background of students;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;respects the diversity of values and beliefs represented in the community;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;complements and augments the sexuality education children receive from their families, religious and community groups, and healthcare professionals;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;teaches not only about abstinence, but also contraception, including emergency contraception and reproductive choice;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;teaches about lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) issues and questions issues;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;teaches anatomy, development, puberty, and relationships;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;teaches all of the other issues one would expect to be covered in a traditional sexuality education class; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;should be science-based and medically accurate&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

=== Sexual education exemption ===
Just as teaching methods and curricula vary by state,  excusal from sex education also varies by state. States may have with an opt out or opt in produce. In some states, students can opt out of receiving sexual education without specifying a particular reason. In other states, students can only opt out for religious or moral reasons. In an opt-in provision, parents must actively agree to allow their children to receive sex education prior to the start of the sexual education.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

== Sexual content in the media  ==
Since 1997, the amount of sexual content on TV has nearly doubled in the United States.&lt;ref name=":05"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Skull|first=Tracie Marie et. al|date=2014|title=A Media Literacy Education Approach to Teaching Adolescents Comprehensive Sexual Health Education|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1043483|journal=Journal of Media Literacy Education|volume=6|issue=1|pages=1–14|via=ERIC|pmid=27081579|pmc=4828968}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a study done in 2008 showed that nearly 40% of popular music lyrics contained sexual references which were often sexually degrading. These lyrics were also often accompanied with mentions of other risk behaviors, such as substance use and violence. &lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;

Teens (ages 13-15) in the United States, use entertainment media as their top source for education in regards to sexuality and sexual health. Additionally, a study found that 15-19 year olds in the U.S use media far more than parents or schools to obtain information about birth control.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt; Some studies have found that, "very few teen television shows mention any of the responsibilities or risks (e.g., using contraception, pregnancy, STIs) associated with sex and almost none of the shows with sexual content include precaution, prevention, or negative outcomes as the primary theme." &lt;ref name=":05" /&gt; Television shows 16 and Pregnant and its spin-off, Teen Mom, which first aired on MTV in 2009 received major disapproval from some parents as they thought the shows glamorized teen pregnancy and motherhood. However, 16 and Pregnant actually led to a 4.3 percent reduction in teen pregnancy, mostly as a result of increased contraceptive use.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; In contrast, other data shows that exposure to high levels of sexual content on the television causes adolescents to have twice the risk of becoming pregnant in the following 3 years, compared to those who were exposed to low levels.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;

The film Mean Girls, directed by Mark Waters shed light on the state sex education in some parts of the United States. In the film the health instructor states, "At your age, you're going to have a lot of urges. You're going to want to take off your clothes and touch each other. But if you do touch each other, you will get chlamydia and die." This line is meant to be satirical, but it illustrates common flaws within sex education in the U.S. It depicts simplistic descriptions of sexual activity and implementation of fear without any legitimate basis.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

Comprehensive sex education is the main topic in the documentary ''[[The Education of Shelby Knox]]'' released in 2005 about [[Lubbock, Texas]], which has one of the highest [[Teenage pregnancy|teen pregnancy]] and [[Sexually transmitted disease|STD]] rates in the nation. The "solution" to which is a strict [[abstinence-only sex education]] curriculum in the public schools and a conservative preacher who urges kids to pledge abstinence until marriage.

In 2013, ''[[How to Lose Your Virginity]]'' was released, a documentary that questioned the effectiveness of the [[Abstinence-only sex education|abstinence-only sex education movement]] and observed how [[sexuality]] continues to define a young woman's morality and self-worth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msmagazine.com/blog/2010/06/24/how-to-lose-your-virginity-an-interview-with-therese-shechter/|title=How to Lose Your Virginity: An Interview with Therese Shechter|last=Dove-Viebahn|first=Aviva|date=June 24, 2010|publisher=Ms. Magazine|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jezebel.com/5548592/losing-your-virginity-is-harder-than-you-think|title=Losing Your Virginity Is Harder Than You Think|last=Stein|first=Sadie|date=May 26, 2010|publisher=Jezebel|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning and necessity of virginity as a [[social construct]] is also examined through narration and interviews with notable sexuality experts, such as former Surgeon General [[Joycelyn Elders|Dr. Joycelyn Elders]], "Scarleteen"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scarleteen.com/about_scarleteen|title=About Scarleteen|website=www.scarleteen.com|accessdate=2016-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; creator and editor [[Heather Corinna]], historian [[Hanne Blank]], author [[Jessica Valenti]], and [[sex education|comprehensive sex education]] advocate [[Shelby Knox]].

Not only have films portrayed sex education, but so has [[social media]].  Platforms such as [[YouTube]], [[Facebook]], [[Vine (service)|Vine]], and others are used as a tool to uplift the narratives of marginalized communities such as [[Person of color|persons of color]]  and LGBTQIA+ persons in hopes to "strengthen sexual health equity for all."&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt;

As a result of the mass amount of sex content in media, media literacy education (MLE) has emerged. It was created to address the influence of unhealthy media messages on risky health decisions, such as intention to use substances, body image issues, and eating disorders.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt; A study analyzed the effectiveness of a teacher-led MLE program, called Media Aware Sexual Health (MASH), which provides students with accurate health information and teaches them how to apply that information to critical analysis of media messages. This comprehensive sex education resulted in increased intentions to talk to a parent, partner and medical professional prior to sexual activity, and intentions for condom use.&lt;ref name=":05" /&gt;

Due to knowledge gaps in most sex education curricula for teens, free online resources like [[Sex, Etc.]] and teensource.org&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teensource.org/content/about-us|title=About Us|last=|first=|date=|website=teensource.org|publisher=TeenSource|access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been created to promote comprehensive, inclusive sex education for teenagers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8683">'''Computational social science''' refers to the academic sub-disciplines concerned with computational approaches to the [[social science]]s. This means that computers are used to model, simulate, and analyze social phenomena.  Fields include [[computational economics]], [[computational sociology]], [[cliodynamics]], [[culturomics]],  and the automated analysis of contents, in social and traditional media. It focuses on investigating social and behavioral relationships and interactions through [[social simulation]], modeling, network analysis, and media analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://computationalsocialscience.org/|title=The Computational Social Science Society of the Americas official website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==
There are two terminologies that relate to each other: '''Social Science Computing (SSC) and Computational Social Science (CSS)'''. In literature, CSS is referred to the field of social science that uses the computational approaches in studying the social phenomena.
On the other hand, SSC is the field in which computational methodologies are created to assist in explanations of social phenomena.

Computational social science revolutionizes both fundamental legs of the [[scientific method]]: [[empirical research]], especially through [[big data]], by analyzing the [[digital footprint]] left behind through social online activities; and [[scientific theory]], especially through [[computer simulation]] model building through [[social simulation]].&lt;ref&gt;DT&amp;SC 7-1: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9x3d75ZMuYU .

'''Deborah Frances Tannen''' (born June 7, 1945) is an [[Americans|American]] [[academic]] and [[professor]] of [[linguistics]] at [[Georgetown University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] She has been a McGraw Distinguished Lecturer at [[Princeton University]] and was a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the [[Behavioural sciences|Behavioral Sciences]] following a term in residence at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton, NJ]].

Tannen is the author of twelve books, including ''[[That's Not What I Meant!]]'' and ''[[You Just Don't Understand]]'', the latter of which spent four years on the [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Sellers List]], including eight consecutive months at number one.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/books/You-Just-Dont-Understand-Deborah-Tannen/?isbn=9780060959623|title=You Just Don't Understand|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709081219/http://www.harpercollins.com/books/You-Just-Dont-Understand-Deborah-Tannen/?isbn=9780060959623|archive-date=July 9, 2010|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is also a frequent contributor to ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[The Atlantic]]'', and ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' magazine, among other publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.deborahtannen.com/general-audience-articles/|title=General Audience Articles|website=Deborah Tannen|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Tannen graduated from [[Hunter College High School]] and completed her [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate studies]] at [[Binghamton University|Harpur College]] (now part of [[Binghamton University]]) with a [[Bachelor's degree|B.A.]] in [[English literature|English Literature]]. Tannen went on to earn a Masters in English Literature at [[Wayne State University]]. Later, she continued her academic studies at [[UC Berkeley]], earning an [[Master's degree|M.A.]] and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in Linguistics.

==Writing career==
Tannen has lectured worldwide in her field, and written and edited numerous academic publications on [[linguistics]], [[discourse analysis]], and [[interpersonal communication]]. She has published many books including ''Conversational Style: Analyzing Talk Among Friends''; ''Talking Voices: Repetition, Dialogue and Imagery in Conversational Discourse''; ''Gender and Discourse''; and ''The Handbook of Discourse Analysis''. Her major theoretical contribution, presented in ''Talking Voices'', is a [[Poetry|poetics]] of [[conversation]]. She demonstrates that everyday conversation is made up of linguistic features that are traditionally regarded as literary, such as [[Repetition (rhetorical device)|repetition]], [[dialogue]], and [[imagery]].

Tannen has also written several general-audience books on interpersonal communication and public discourse. She became well known in the United States after her book ''[[You Just Don't Understand]]: Women and Men in Conversation'' was published in 1990. It remained on the [[New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller list]] for nearly four years, and was subsequently translated into 30 other languages.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She has written several other general-audience books and mainstream articles between 1983 and 2017.

Two of her recent books, ''You Were Always Mom's Favorite!: Sisters in Conversation Throughout Their Lives'' and ''You're Wearing THAT?: Understanding Mothers and Daughters in Conversation'' were also ''New York Times'' best-sellers. Among her other books, ''The Argument Culture'' received the Common Ground Book Award, and ''I Only Say This Because I Love You'' received a Books for a Better Life Award.

==Research==
===Overview===

Deborah Tannen's main research has focused on the expression of interpersonal relationships in conversational interaction. Tannen has explored conversational interaction and style differences at a number of different levels and as related to different situations, including differences in conversational style as connected to the [[gender]]&lt;ref name="Tannen 2003"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Handbook on Language and Gender|date=2003|publisher=Basil Blackwell|location=Oxford, UK &amp; Cambridge, MA|pages=179–201|author=Deborah Tanne|editor1=J. Holmes |editor2=M. Meyerhoff |chapter=Gender and Family Interaction}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cultural background,&lt;ref name="Tannen 1981"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Indirectness in Discourse: Ethnicity as Conversational Style|journal=Discourse Processes|date=1981|volume=4|series=1981|issue=3|pages=221–238|author=Deborah Tannen|doi=10.1080/01638538109544517}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as speech that is tailored for specific listeners based on the speaker's social role.&lt;ref name="Tannen 2000"&gt;{{cite book|title=Language in Action: New Studies of Language in Society|date=2000|publisher=Hampton Press|location=Cresskill, NJ|pages=189–249|author=Deborah Tannen|editor1=J. Peyton |editor2=P. Griffin |editor3=W. Wolfram |editor4=R. Fasold |chapter=Indirectness at Work}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Tannen has done extensive gender-linked research and writing that focused on miscommunications between men and women; however, some linguists have argued against Tannen's claims from a feminist standpoint.&lt;ref name="previous"&gt;{{cite book|title=Key Thinkers in Linguistics and the Philosophy of Language|date=2005|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburg|accessdate=1 October 2012|chapter=DEBORAH TANNEN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tannen's research began when she analyzed her friends while working on her Ph.D. Since then, she has collected several naturally occurring conversations on tape&lt;ref name="Tannen 1987"&gt;{{cite book|title=Psycholinguistic Models of Production|date=1987|publisher=Ablex|location=Norwood, NJ|pages=251–267|author=Deborah Tannen|chapter=Conversational Style}}&lt;/ref&gt; and conducted interviews as forms of data for later analysis. She has also compiled and analyzed information from other researchers in order to draw out notable trends in various types of conversations, sometimes borrowing and expanding on their terminology to emphasize new points of interest.

===Gender differences in US family interaction===
Tannen highlighted the "Telling Your Day" ritual that takes place in many U.S. families, in which, typically, the mother in a two-parent family encourages a child to share details (about their day which the mother has typically already heard about) with the father.&lt;ref name="Tannen 2003" /&gt; She also emphasizes the common occurrence of the "troubles talk" ritual in women.&lt;ref name="Tannen 2003" /&gt; This ritual involves a woman sharing details about "a frustrating experience" or other previously encountered problem with a confidant. She cites this ritual of an example of how, for many women, closeness is established through sharing personal details.&lt;ref name="Tannen 2003" /&gt; As one example of gender-linked [[Language interpretation|misinterpretations]], Tannen points out that a man who is on the receiving end of "troubles talk" from his wife will often take the mention of a problem and how it was handled as an invitation to pass judgment, despite the fact that "troubles talk" is simply an expository experience meant to enhance emotional connections.

===Interplay of connection maneuvers and power maneuvers in family conversations===
Tannen once described family discourse as "a prime example…of the nexus of needs for both [[Power (social and political)|power]] and [[Rapport|connection]] in human relationships.&lt;ref name="Tannen 2003" /&gt; She coined the term "connection maneuvers" to describe interactions that take place in the closeness dimension of the traditional model of power and connection&lt;!-- What was "Figure 1" now deleted --&gt;; this term is meant to contrast with the "control maneuvers," which, according to psychologists Millar, Rogers, and Bavelas, take place in the power dimension of the same model.&lt;ref name="Tannen 2003" /&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Unidimensional view of power and connection (linguistics).jpg.png|thumb|left|'''Figure 1:''' Unidimensional view of power and connection{{deletable image-caption|Sunday, 20 August 2017|F7}}]] --&gt;

Tannen challenged the conventional view of power ([[hierarchy]]) and connection ([[solidarity]]) as "unidimensional and mutually exclusive" and offered her own kind of model for mapping the interplay of these two aspects of communication, which takes the form of a two-dimensional grid (Figure 1). [[File:Tannen Power vs. Connection Grid.png|thumb|right|'''Figure 1:''' Tannen's Power vs. Connection grid.]]

In this model, the vertical axis represents the level of power in the interaction, and the horizontal axis represents connection. Having presented this model, Tannen proposed that in the American paradigm, a sibling relationship would be mapped in the bottom left [[Quadrant (plane geometry)|quadrant]], as there is a high level of closeness and a relative equality that is not comparable to the power dynamic in an American parent/child relationship.&lt;ref name="Tannen 2003" /&gt; Using this new model, Tannen argues that connection maneuvers do not only occur independently of control maneuvers. Among other examples, she mentions a wife who refuses to let her [[husband]] take over making popcorn by saying "You always burn it".&lt;ref name="Tannen 2003" /&gt; According to Tannen, the wife's resistance to her husband's request is a control maneuver, but by citing a potential undesirable effect for her family (i.e. burnt popcorn), she ties a connection maneuver into her attempt to enforce a decision.

Tannen also highlights ventriloquizing – which she explains as a "phenomenon by which a person speaks not only for another but also as another"&lt;ref name="Tannen 2001"&gt;{{cite book|title=Linguistics, Language, and the Real World: Discourse and Beyond: Georgetown University Round Table on Languages and Linguistics|date=2001|publisher=Georgetown University Press|location=Washington, DC|pages=50–61|author=Deborah Tannen|editor1=D. Tannen |editor2=J. E. Alatis |chapter=Power maneuvers or connection maneuvers? Ventriloquizing in family interaction}}&lt;/ref&gt; – as a strategy for integrating connection maneuvers into other types of interactions. As an example of this, she cites an exchange recorded by her research team in which a mother attempts to convince her son to pick up his toys by ventriloquizing the family's dogs: "[extra high pitch] We're naughty, but we're not as naughty as Jared".&lt;ref name="Tannen 2001" /&gt;

===Conversational style===
Deborah Tannen describes the notion of conversational style as "a semantic process" and "the way meaning is encoded in and derived from speech".&lt;ref name="Tannen 1987" /&gt; She cites the work of R. Lakoff and J. Gumperz as the inspiration behind her thinking. According to Tannen, some features of conversational style are topic (which includes type of topics and how transitions occur), genre (storytelling style), pace (which includes rate of speech, occurrence or lack of pauses, and overlap), and expressive paralinguistics (pitch/amplitude shifts and other changes in voice quality).&lt;ref name="Tannen 1987" /&gt;

==="High-involvement" vs. "high-considerateness"===
Based on a two-and-a-half hour recording of Thanksgiving dinner conversations with friends, Tannen analyzed the two prevailing conversational styles among the six participants, which she divided evenly between the categories of [[New York City|New York]]er and non-New Yorker.&lt;ref name="Tannen 1987" /&gt; Upon analyzing the recording, Tannen came to the conclusion that the speech of the New Yorkers was characterized by exaggerated intonations ([[Paralanguage|paralinguistics]]), overlapping speech between two or more speakers, short silences, and machine-gun questions, which she defines as questions that are "uttered quickly, timed to overlap or latch onto another's talk, and characterized by reduced syntactic form".&lt;ref name="Tannen 1987" /&gt; The style of the non-New Yorkers was opposite that of the New Yorkers in all regards mentioned above; furthermore, the non-New Yorkers were caught off-guard by the New Yorkers' exaggerated intonation and interrupting questions, two factors that discouraged them from finishing their conversations at some points.&lt;ref name="Tannen 1987" /&gt; Tannen refers to the New Yorkers' style as "high-involvement" and the unimposing style of the non-New Yorkers as "high-considerateness".&lt;ref name="Tannen 1987" /&gt;

===Indirectness in work situations===
Tannen has expressed her stance against taking indirect speech as a sign of weakness or as a lack of confidence; she also set out to debunk the idea that [[Americans|American]] women are generally more indirect than men.&lt;ref name="Tannen 2000" /&gt; She reached this conclusion by looking through transcripts of conversations and interviews, as well as through correspondence with her readers. One example she uses against the second idea comes from a letter from a reader, who mentioned how his Navy superior trained his unit to respond to the indirect request "It's hot in this room" as a direct request to open the window.&lt;ref name="Tannen 2000" /&gt; A different letter mentions the tendency of men to be more indirect when it comes to expressing feelings than women.&lt;ref name="Tannen 2000" /&gt;

Tannen also mentions exchanges where both participants are male, but the two participants are not of equal social status. As a specific example, she mentions a "black box" recording between a plane captain and a co-pilot in which the captain's failure to understand the co-pilot's indirect conversational style (which was likely a result of his relatively inferior rank) caused a crash.&lt;ref name="Tannen 2000" /&gt;

===Indirectness as a sociocultural norm===
During a trip to [[Greece]], Tannen observed that comments she had made to her hosts about foods she had not seen yet in Greece (specifically, scrambled eggs and grapes) had been interpreted as indirect requests for the foods.&lt;ref name="Tannen 1975"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tannen|first=Deborah|title=Communication mix and mixup, or how linguistics can ruin a marriage|journal=San Jose State Occasional Paper in Linguistics|date=1975|pages=205–211}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was surprising to her, since she had just made the comments in the spirit of small talk. Tannen observed this same tendency of [[Greek people|Greeks]] and [[Greek American|Greek-Americans]] to interpret statements indirectly in a study&lt;ref name="Tannen 1981" /&gt; that involved interpreting the following conversation between a husband and a wife:

:{{Dialogue
|Wife|John's having a party. Wanna go?
|Husband|Okay.
|action|later|Wife|Are you sure you want to go to the party?
|Husband|Okay, let's not go. I'm tired anyway.
}}

The participants – some Greeks, some Greek-Americans, and some non-Greek Americans – had to choose between the following two paraphrases of the second line in the exchange:

:{{Dialogue
|[1-I]|My wife wants to go to this party, since she asked. I'll go to make her happy.
|[1-D]|My wife is asking if I want to go to a party. I feel like going, so I'll say yes.
}}

Tannen's findings showed that 48% of Greeks chose the first (more indirect) paraphrase, while only 32% of non-Greek Americans chose the same one, with the Greek-Americans scoring closer to the Greeks than the other Americans at 43%. These percentages, combined with other elements of the study, suggest that the degree of indirectness a listener generally expects may be affected through sociocultural norms.

===Agonism in written academic discourse===
Tannen analyzed the agonistic framing of academic texts, which are characterized by their "ritualized adversativeness".&lt;ref name="Tannen 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tannen|first=Deborah|title=Agonism in academic discourse|journal=Journal of Pragmatics|date=2002|pages=1651–1669|doi=10.1016/s0378-2166(02)00079-6|volume=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; She argued that expectations for academic papers in the US place the highest importance on presenting the weaknesses of an existing, opposing, argument as a basis for bolstering the author's replacement argument.&lt;ref name="Tannen 2002" /&gt; According to her, agonism limits the depth of arguments and learning, since authors who follow the convention pass up opportunities to acknowledge strengths in the texts they are arguing against; in addition, this places the newest, attention-grabbing works in prime positions to be torn apart.&lt;ref name="Tannen 2002" /&gt;

[[File:Chris Knight in 2016.jpg|thumb|Chris Knight in 2016]]
'''''Decoding Chomsky: Science and revolutionary politics''''' is a 2016 book by the left-wing activist and linguistic anthropologist [[Chris Knight (anthropologist)|Chris Knight]] on [[Noam Chomsky]]'s approach to science and politics. Knight admires Chomsky's politics, but argues that his linguistic theories were influenced in damaging ways by his immersion since the early 1950s in an intellectual culture heavily dominated by US military priorities, an immersion deepened when he secured employment in a Pentagon-funded electronics laboratory in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.&lt;ref&gt;Letters, ''London Review of Books'', July 13, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016, Chomsky dismissed the book, telling ''[[The New York Times]]'' that it was based on a false assumption since, in fact, no military "work was being done on campus" during his time at MIT.&lt;ref&gt;''Noam Chomsky and the Bicycle Theory.'' Sam Tanenhaus interviews Noam Chomsky. ''The New York Times'', October 31, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In a subsequent public comment, Chomsky on similar grounds denounced Knight's entire narrative as a "wreck ... complete nonsense throughout".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Sam Fenn interviews Chris Knight and Noam Chomsky responds. ''Chomsky's Carburetor.'' Cited Podcast. http://citedpodcast.com/23-chomskys-carburetor/&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, a reviewer for the US ''Chronicle of Higher Education'' described Knight's book as perhaps "the most in-depth meditation on 'the Chomsky problem' ever published".&lt;ref&gt;''The Chomsky Puzzle. Piecing together a celebrity scientist'', by Tom Bartlett. ''Chronicle of Higher Education,'' August 25, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, the ''New Scientist'' described Knight's account as "trenchant and compelling".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23230980-800-the-value-of-everything-getting-radical-about-research/''New Scientist,'' November 2, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy continued in the ''London Review of Books'', where the sociologist of science [[Hilary Rose (sociologist)|Hilary Rose]] cited Knight's book approvingly, provoking Chomsky to denounce what he called "Knight's astonishing performance" in two subsequent letters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lrb.co.uk/v39/n09/jackson-lears/mysterian Letters], ''London Review of Books'', June 1; June 15; July 13, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The debate has continued in the pages of Open Democracy.

Since the book was published, Knight has published evidence that Chomsky worked on a military sponsored "command and control" project for the [[MITRE Corporation]] in the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2018/03/when-the-pentagon-looked-to-chomskys-linguistics-for-their-weapons-systems.html "When the Pentagon Looked to Chomsky's Linguistics for their Weapons Systems"], 3 Quarks Daily, 12 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The argument ==
[[File:Noam Chomsky portrait 2017.jpg|thumb|right|Noam Chomsky in 2017]]

Knight's book begins with Chomsky's claim that his political and scientific outputs have little connection with each other. For example, asked in 2006 whether his science and his politics are related, Chomsky replied that the connection is "almost non-existent ... There is a kind of loose, abstract connection in the background. But if you look for practical connections, they're non-existent."&lt;ref&gt;''Decoding Chomsky'', p. 248, n. 20, citing ''Irish Times'', January 21, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Knight accepts that scientific research and political involvement are distinct kinds of activity serving very different purposes. But he claims that, in Chomsky's case, the conflicts intrinsic to his institutional situation forced him to drive an unusually deep and damaging wedge between his politics and his science.

Knight points out that Chomsky began his career working in an electronics laboratory whose primary technological mission he detested on moral and political grounds. Funded by the Pentagon, the Research Laboratory of Electronics at MIT was involved in contributing to the basic research required for hi-tech weapons systems.&lt;ref&gt;''Decoding Chomsky'', p. xi, citing 'Tri-Services Honor MIT Achievements in Military Electronics R&amp;D', ''Army Research and Development News Magazine,'' Vol. 12 no.4, July-August 1971, p 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Suggesting that he was well aware of MIT's role at the time, Chomsky himself recalls: {{quotation|"There was extensive [military] research on the MIT campus. ... In fact, a good deal of the [nuclear] missile guidance technology was developed right on the MIT campus and in laboratories run by the university."&lt;ref&gt;''Decoding Chomsky'', p. xiv, citing {{cite book|last1=Chomsky|first1=N.|title=Language and Politics|date=2004|publisher=AK Press|location=Edinburgh|isbn=1-902593-82-0|page=216|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

It was because of his anti-militarist conscience, Knight argues, that such research priorities were experienced by him as deeply troubling. By way of evidence, Knight cites this correspondence from ''The New York Review of Books'' in 1967:

{{quotation| '''[[George Steiner]]''': "Will Noam Chomsky announce that he will stop teaching at MIT or anywhere in this country so long as torture and napalm go on? ... Will he even resign from a university very largely implicated in the kind of 'strategic studies' he so rightly scorns?"

'''Noam Chomsky''': "I have given a good bit of thought to the specific suggestions that you put forth... leaving the country or resigning from MIT, which is, more than any other university, associated with activities of the department of 'defense.' ... As to MIT, I think that its involvement in the war effort is tragic and indefensible."&lt;ref&gt;Abbreviated in ''Decoding Chomsky'', p. 37; citing full text in ''The New York Review of Books'', March 23, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

Chomsky's situation at MIT, according to Knight, is summed up by Chomsky when he describes some of his colleagues this way:

{{quotation| "It is appalling that a person can come through an MIT education and say the kinds of things that were quoted in the ''New York Times'' article on Sunday, November 9 [1969]... One student said, right along straight Nazi scientist lines: '''What I'm designing may one day be used to kill millions of people. I don't care. That's not my responsibility. I'm given an interesting technological problem and I get enjoyment out of solving it.''' You know perfectly well that we can name twenty faculty members who've said the same thing. ... This is an attitude that is very widely held and very widely expressed."&lt;ref&gt;Abbreviated in ''Decoding Chomsky'', p. xviii, citing full text in Chomsky, N. 2002. ''On Democracy and Education.'' Edited by C. P. Otero, p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

Chomsky, then, apparently felt that a number of his colleagues were no better than Nazi scientists. In order to maintain his moral and political integrity, Knight argues, Chomsky resolved to limit his cooperation to pure linguistic theory of such an abstract kind that it could not conceivably have any military use.

With this aim in mind, Chomsky's theoretical modelling became so abstract that not even language's practical function in social communication could be acknowledged or explored. One damaging consequence, according to Knight, was that scientific investigation of the ways in which real human beings use language became divorced from what quickly became the prevailing MIT school of formal linguistic theory.

Knight argues that the conflicting pressures Chomsky experienced had the effect of splitting his intellectual output in two, prompting him to ensure that any work he conducted for the military was purely theoretical—of no practical use to anyone—while his activism, being directed relentlessly ''against'' the military, was preserved free of any obvious connection with his science.

To an unprecedented extent, according to Knight, mind in this way became divorced from body, thought from action, and knowledge from its practical applications, these disconnects characterizing a philosophical paradigm which came to dominate much of intellectual life for half a century across the Western world.

== Reception ==

Knight's book has been both criticised and acclaimed by wide variety of commentators.

===Negative===


* '''[[Norbert Hornstein]]''' and '''Nathan Robinson''' dismiss the book as betraying a complete misunderstanding of Chomsky's linguistic theories and beliefs. They question the motives of Yale University Press, asking why Yale considered it appropriate to publish Knight's critique, which they say attacks Chomsky through political conjecture rather than addressing his linguistic or political ideas. Comparing Knight's Marxist criticism to a conservative criticism that was released in the same year by Tom Wolfe, they speculate that both were published with similar motivations - that Chomsky's criticisms were a threat to the power behind the publishers.(''Current Affairs'').&lt;ref name="currentaffairs.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.currentaffairs.org/2016/12/thousand-ways-to-misrepresent-noam-chomsky|title=1000 Ways To Misrepresent Noam Chomsky |work=Current Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Robert Barsky]]''' argues that since Knight was never formally trained in Chomsky's conception of theoretical linguistics, he has no right to comment on whether it stands up as science. ''Decoding Chomsky,'' claims Barsky, offers no original insights, consisting only of "a weak rehash of critiques from naysayers to Chomsky's approach". While Barsky concedes that Chomsky did work in a military laboratory, he argues that this cannot be significant since virtually all US scientists receive Pentagon funding one way or another. (''Moment'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.momentmag.com/book-review-decoding-chomsky/|title=Book Review // Decoding Chomsky |work=Moment Magazine |date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Peter Stone''' claims that  Knight hates Chomsky and "for that reason, he wrote ''Decoding Chomsky'' – a nasty, mean-spirited, vitriolic, ideologically-driven hatchet job". Stone states that, although Knight is on the Left, "the level of venom on display here exceeds that of all but the most unhinged of Chomsky’s detractors on the Right." He goes   to state that "Knight spares no opportunity to paint Chomsky’s every thought and deed in the blackest possible terms" and that: "''Decoding Chomsky'' is not a critique of a body of work in linguistics; it is an attempt to demonise a man for his perceived political deviations, even though that man happens to be on the same side of the political spectrum as the man who is demonising him. Reading ''Decoding Chomsky'' taught me something about the mindset of the prosecutors in the Moscow Show Trials."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://philosophynow.org/issues/127/Decoding_Chomsky_by_Chris_Knight|title=Book Review // Decoding Chomsky |work=Philosophy Now|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Wolfgang Sperlich''' targets Knight's explanation for the so-called "Chomsky problem", the supposedly striking disconnect between Chomsky the activist (working against the military) and Chomsky the scientist (working in a military lab). According to Sperlich, Knight insinuates that Chomsky was willing "to sell his soul for a fat salary package". Sperlich responds: "What does Chris Knight want from him? That he dress in rags and live in a hovel?" Sperlich claims that at no point did Chomsky collude with any of the Pentagon's plans to make use of his research. (''Wolfgang Sperlich's blog'').&lt;ref name="wolfgangsperlich.blogspot.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wolfgangsperlich.blogspot.co.uk/2016/11/a-review-of-decoding-chomsky-2016-by.html|title=A review of ''Decoding Chomsky'' (2016) by Chris Knight|publisher=wolfgangsperlich.blogspot.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further research on Chomsky at MIT==
[[File:SAGE control room.png|right|thumb| Preparing for nuclear war: the SAGE air defense system—MITRE's first command and control project.]]

In his book, Knight points out that the US military initially funded Chomsky's linguistics because they were interested in machine translation. Later their focus shifted and Knight cites Air Force Colonel Edmund Gaines’ statement that: "We sponsored linguistic research in order to learn how to build command and control systems that could understand English queries directly."&lt;ref&gt;''Decoding Chomsky'', pp. 53–72 and 16, citing Frederick Newmeyer, ''The Politics of Linguistics'', Chicago 1986, pp. 85–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book review, Robert Barsky poses the crucial question not answered in Knight's book: "Machine Translation research is turned into a project dedicated to 'command and control systems'. Really? And how did Chomsky contribute to that MT project?"

Since finishing ''Decoding Chomsky'', Knight has found apparently compelling evidence shedding light on this question. It appears that between 1963 and 1965, Chomsky worked as a "consultant" on an Air Force project to establish English as an "operational language for command and control". This is confirmed by several of Chomsky's students at the time, who also worked on this military project.

According to one of these former students, [[Barbara Partee]], the Air Force's justification for sponsoring Chomsky's approach to linguistics was "that in the event of a nuclear war, the generals would be underground with some computers trying to manage things, and that it would probably be easier to teach computers to understand English than to teach the generals to program."&lt;ref&gt;C. Knight, [http://www.3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2018/03/when-the-pentagon-looked-to-chomskys-linguistics-for-their-weapons-systems.html "When the Pentagon Looked to Chomsky's Linguistics for their Weapons Systems"], ''3 Quarks Daily'', March 12, 2018 (citing Arnold Zwicky, [https://www.stanford.edu/~zwicky/grammars-of-number-theory.pdf "Grammars of Number Theory: Some Examples"], Working Paper W-6671, MITRE Corp., 1963, Foreword, last page).

In 1971, a former Air Force Colonel, Anthony Debons, wrote: "much of the research conducted at MIT by Chomsky and his colleagues [has] direct application to the efforts undertaken by military scientists to develop ... languages for computer operations in military command and control systems." A. Debons, "Command and Control: Technology and Social Impact", in F. Alt and M. Rubinoff, ''Advances in Computers'', Vol.11, 1971. New York/London 1971, p354.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[signal processing]], a '''digital biquad filter''' is a second-order [[recursive filter|recursive]] [[linear filter]], containing two [[Pole–zero plot|poles]] and two [[Pole–zero plot|zeros]].  "Biquad" is an abbreviation of "''biquadratic''", which refers to the fact that in the [[Z-transform|Z domain]], its [[transfer function]] is the ratio of two [[quadratic function]]s:

:&lt;math&gt;\ H(z)=\frac{b_0+b_1z^{-1}+b_2z^{-2}} {a_0+a_1z^{-1}+a_2z^{-2} }&lt;/math&gt;

The coefficients are often normalized such that ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1:

:&lt;math&gt;\ H(z)=\frac{b_0+b_1z^{-1}+b_2z^{-2}} {1+a_1z^{-1}+a_2z^{-2} }&lt;/math&gt;

High-order [[IIR filter]]s can be highly sensitive to [[Quantization (signal processing)|quantization]] of their coefficients, and can easily become [[BIBO stability|unstable]].  This is much less of a problem with first and second-order filters; therefore, higher-order filters are typically implemented as serially-cascaded biquad sections (and a first-order filter if necessary). The two poles of the biquad filter must be inside the unit circle for it to be stable. In general, this is true for all discrete filters i.e. all poles must be inside the unit circle in the Z-domain for the filter to be stable.

==Implementation==

===Direct form 1===
The most straightforward implementation is the direct form 1, which has the following [[difference equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\ y[n] = \frac{1}{a_0} \left ( b_0x[n] + b_1x[n-1] + b_2x[n-2] - a_1y[n-1] - a_2y[n-2] \right )&lt;/math&gt;

or, if normalized:

:&lt;math&gt;\ y[n] = b_0x[n] + b_1x[n-1] + b_2x[n-2] - a_1y[n-1] - a_2y[n-2] &lt;/math&gt;

Here the &lt;math&gt;b_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b_2&lt;/math&gt; coefficients determine zeros, and &lt;math&gt;a_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a_2&lt;/math&gt; determine the position of the poles.

Flow graph of biquad filter in direct form 1:

===Direct form 2===
The direct form 1 implementation requires four delay registers. An equivalent circuit is the direct form 2 implementation, which requires only two delay registers:

[[File:Biquad filter DF-II.svg|400px|]]

The direct form 2 implementation is called the canonical form, because it uses the minimal amount of delays, adders and multipliers, yielding in the same transfer function as the direct form 1 implementation. The [[difference equation]]s for direct form 2 are:

:&lt;math&gt;\ y[n]=b_0 w[n]+b_1 w[n-1]+b_2 w[n-2],&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\ w[n]=x[n]-a_1 w[n-1]-a_2 w[n-2].&lt;/math&gt;

===Transposed direct forms===
{{expand section|date=October 2015}}
Each of the two direct forms may be transposed by reversing the flow graph without altering the transfer function. Branch points are changed to summers and summers are changed to branch points.&lt;ref&gt;https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/fp/Transposed_Direct_Forms.html&lt;/ref&gt; These provide modified implementations that accomplish the same transfer function which can be mathematically significant in a real-world implementation where precision may be lost in state storage.

The [[difference equation]]s for Transposed Direct Form 2 are:

:&lt;math&gt;\ y[n]=b_0 x[n]+s_1[n-1],&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\ s_1[n]=s_2[n-1]+b_1 x[n]-a_1 y[n]&lt;/math&gt; 
and 
:&lt;math&gt;\ s_2[n]=b_2 x[n]-a_2 y[n].&lt;/math&gt;

===Transposed Direct form 1===

is transposed into

===Transposed Direct form 2===

is transposed into

===Quantizing Noise===
When a sample of n bits is multiplied by a coefficient of m bits, the product has n+m bits. These products are typically accumulated in a DSP register, the addition of five products may need 3 overflow bits; this register is often large enough to hold n+m+3 bits. The z&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; is implemented by storing a value for one sample time; this storage register is usually n bits, the accumulator register is rounded to fit n bits, and this introduced quantizing noise.

In the direct form 1 arrangement, there is a single quantizing/rounding function
[[File:Digital Biquad Direct Form 1 Untransformed with Quantizing.svg|Flow diagram of Biquad filter Direct Form 1 for use in article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_biquad_filter]].

In the direct form 2 arrangement, there is a quantizing/rounding function for an intermediate value. In a cascade, the value may not need rounding between stages, but the final output may need rounding
[[File:Digital Biquad Direct Form 2 Untransformed with Quantizing.svg|Flow diagram of Biquad filter Direct Form 2 with Quantizing for use in article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_biquad_filter]].

Fixed point DSP usually prefers the non transposed forms and has an accumulator with a large number of bits, and is rounded when stored in main memory. Floating point DSP usually prefers the transposed form, each multiplication and potentially each addition are rounded; the additions are higher precision result, when both operands have similar magnitude.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="68410">'''Entity–attribute–value model''' ('''EAV''')  is a [[data model]] to encode, in a space-efficient manner, entities where the number of attributes (properties, parameters) that can be used to describe them is potentially vast, but the number that will actually apply to a given entity is relatively modest. Such entities correspond to the mathematical notion of a [[sparse matrix]]. 

EAV is also known as '''object–attribute–value model''', '''vertical database model''', and '''open schema'''.

==Structure of an EAV table==
This data representation is analogous to space-efficient methods of storing a [[sparse matrix]], where only non-empty values are stored. In an EAV data model, each attribute-value pair is a fact describing an entity, and a row in an EAV table stores a single fact. EAV tables are often described as "long and skinny": "long" refers to the number of rows, "skinny" to the few columns.

Data is recorded as three columns:
* The ''entity'': the item being described.
* The ''attribute'' or ''parameter'': typically implemented as a [[foreign key]] into a table of attribute definitions. The attribute definitions table might contain the following columns: an attribute ID, attribute name, description, [[data type]], and columns assisting input validation, e.g., maximum string length and regular expression, set of permissible values, etc.
* The ''value'' of the attribute.

Consider how one would try to represent a general-purpose clinical record in a relational database. Clearly creating a table (or a set of tables) with thousands of columns is not feasible, because the vast majority of columns would be [[Null (SQL)|null]]. To complicate things, in a longitudinal medical record that follows the patient over time, there may be multiple values of the same parameter: the height and weight of a child, for example, change as the child grows. Finally, the universe of clinical findings keeps growing: for example, diseases emerge and new lab tests are devised; this would require constant addition of columns, and constant revision of the user interface. (The situation where the list of attributes changes frequently is termed "attribute volatility" in database parlance.)

The following shows a snapshot of an EAV table for clinical findings from a visit to a doctor for a fever on the morning of 1/5/98. The entries shown within [[angle bracket]]s are references to entries in other tables, shown here as text rather than as encoded foreign key values for ease of understanding. In this example, the '''values''' are all literal values, but they could also be pre-defined value lists. The latter are particularly useful when the possible values are known to be limited (i.e., [[Enumerated type|enumerable]]).
* The ''entity''. For clinical findings, the entity is the ''patient event'': a [[foreign key]] into a table that contains at a minimum a patient ID and one or more time-stamps (e.g., the start and end of the examination date/time) that record when the event being described happened.
* The ''attribute'' or ''parameter'': a foreign key into a table of attribute definitions (in this example, definitions of clinical findings). At the very least, the attribute definitions table would contain the following columns: an attribute ID, attribute name, description, [[data type]], units of measurement, and columns assisting input validation, e.g., maximum string length and regular expression, maximum and minimum permissible values, set of permissible values, etc.
* The ''value'' of the attribute. This would depend on the data type, and we discuss how values are stored shortly.

The example below illustrates symptoms findings that might be seen in a patient with [[pneumonia]].
&lt;pre&gt;
(&lt;patient XYZ, 1/5/98 9:30 AM&gt;,  &lt;Temperature in degrees Fahrenheit&gt;,  "102" )

(&lt;patient XYZ, 1/5/98 9:30 AM&gt;,  &lt;Presence of Cough&gt;,  "True" )

(&lt;patient XYZ, 1/5/98 9:30 AM&gt;,  &lt;Type of Cough&gt;,  "With phlegm, yellowish, streaks of blood" )

(&lt;patient XYZ, 1/5/98 9:30 AM&gt;,  &lt;Heart Rate in beats per minute&gt;,  "98" )

...&lt;/pre&gt;

==EAV databases==
The term "EAV database" refers to a database design where a significant proportion of the data is modeled as EAV. However, even in a database described as "EAV-based", some tables in the system are traditional relational tables.

* As noted above, EAV modeling makes sense for categories of data, such as clinical findings, where attributes are numerous and sparse. Where these conditions do not hold, standard relational modeling (i.e., one column per attribute) is preferable; using EAV does not mean abandoning common sense or principles of good relational design. In clinical record systems, the subschemas dealing with patient demographics and billing are typically modeled conventionally. (While most vendor database schemas are proprietary, [[VistA]], the system used throughout the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] (VA) medical system, known as the [[Veterans Health Administration]] (VHA),&lt;ref&gt;Department of Veterans Affairs: [http://www1.va.gov/health/ Veterans Health Administration]&lt;/ref&gt; is open-source and its schema is readily inspectable, though it uses a [[MUMPS]] database engine rather than a relational database.)
* As discussed shortly, an EAV database is essentially unmaintainable without numerous supporting tables that contain supporting [[metadata]]. The metadata tables, which typically outnumber the EAV tables by a factor of at least three or more, are typically standard relational tables.&lt;ref name="Nadkarni1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marenco2003"/&gt; An example of a metadata table is the Attribute Definitions table mentioned above.

==EAV versus row modeling==
The EAV data described above is comparable to the contents of a supermarket sales receipt (which would be reflected in a Sales Line Items table in a database). The receipt lists only details of the items actually purchased, instead of listing every product in the shop that the customer might have purchased but didn't. Like the clinical findings for a given patient, the sales receipt is sparse.
* The "entity" is the sale/transaction id&amp;nbsp;— a foreign key into a sales transactions table. This is used to tag each line item internally, though on the receipt the information about the Sale appears at the top (shop location, sale date/time) and at the bottom (total value of sale).
* The "attribute" is a foreign key into a products table, from where one looks up description, unit price, discounts and promotions, etc. (Products are just as volatile as clinical findings, possibly even more so: new products are introduced every month, while others are taken off the market if consumer acceptance is poor. No competent database designer would hard-code individual products such as Doritos or Diet Coke as columns in a table.)
* The "values" are the quantity purchased and total line item price.

'''Row modeling''',{{clarify|reason=What is row modelling? The following paragraphs assume that the reader already knows what it is. However, I cannot guess what it is, based on what is written. Is there an existing WP article on this topic?|date=November 2016}} where facts about something (in this case, a sales transaction) are recorded as multiple ''rows'' rather than multiple ''columns'', is a standard data modeling technique. The differences between row modeling and EAV (which may be considered a ''generalization'' of row-modeling) are:

* A row-modeled table is ''homogeneous'' in the facts that it describes: a Line Items table describes only products sold. By contrast, an EAV table contains almost any type of fact.
* The data type of the value column/s in a row-modeled table is pre-determined by the nature of the facts it records. By contrast, in an EAV table, the conceptual data type of a value in a particular row depends on the attribute in that row. It follows that in production systems, allowing direct data entry into an EAV table would be a recipe for disaster, because the database engine itself would not be able to perform robust input validation. We shall see later how it is possible to build [[Generic data model|generic frameworks]] that perform most of the tasks of input validation, without endless coding on an attribute-by-attribute basis.

In a clinical data repository, row modeling also finds numerous uses; the laboratory test subschema is typically modeled this way, because lab test results are typically numeric, or can be encoded numerically.

The circumstances where you would need to go beyond standard row-modeling to EAV are listed below:
* The data type of individual attributes varies (as seen with clinical findings).
* The categories of data are numerous, growing or fluctuating, but the number of instances (records/rows) within each category is very small. Here, with conventional modeling, the database’s entity–relationship diagram might have hundreds of tables: the tables that contain thousands/ millions of rows/instances are emphasized visually to the same extent as those with very few rows. The latter are candidates for conversion to an EAV representation.
This situation arises in [[Ontology (computer science)|ontology]]-modeling environments, where categories ("classes") must often be created on the fly, and some classes are often eliminated in subsequent cycles of prototyping.
* Certain ("hybrid") classes have some attributes that are non-sparse (present in all or most instances), while other attributes are highly variable and sparse. The latter are suitable for EAV modeling. For example, descriptions of products made by a conglomerate corporation depend on the product category, e.g., the attributes necessary to describe a brand of light bulb are quite different from those required to describe a medical imaging device, but both have common attributes such as packaging unit and per-item cost.

===The entity===
In clinical data, the entity is typically a clinical event, as described above. In more general-purpose settings, the entity is a foreign key into an "objects" table that records common information about every "object" (thing) in the database&amp;nbsp;– at the minimum, a preferred name and brief description, as well as the category/class of entity to which it belongs. Every record (object) in this table is assigned a machine-generated object ID.

The "objects table" approach was pioneered by Tom Slezak and colleagues at Lawrence Livermore Laboratories for the Chromosome 19 database, and is now standard in most large bioinformatics databases. The use of an objects table does not mandate the concurrent use of an EAV design: conventional tables can be used to store the category-specific details of each object.

The major benefit to a central objects table is that, by having a supporting table of object synonyms and keywords, one can provide a standard Google-like search mechanism across the entire system where the user can find information about any object of interest without having to first specify the category that it belongs to. (This is important in bioscience systems where a keyword like "acetylcholine" could refer either to the molecule itself, which is a neurotransmitter, or the biological receptor to which it binds.

===The attribute===
In the EAV table itself, this is just an attribute ID, a foreign key into an Attribute Definitions table, as stated above. However, there are usually multiple metadata tables that contain attribute-related information, and these are discussed shortly.

===The value===
Coercing all values into strings, as in the EAV data example above, results in a simple, but non-scalable, structure: constant data type inter-conversions are required if one wants to do anything with the values, and an index on the value column of an EAV table is essentially useless. Also, it is not convenient to store large binary data, such as images, in [[Base64]] encoded form in the same table as small integers or strings. Therefore, larger systems use separate EAV tables for each data type (including [[binary large object]]s, "BLOBS"), with the metadata for a given attribute identifying the EAV table in which its data will be stored. This approach is actually quite efficient because the modest amount of attribute metadata for a given class or form that a user chooses to work with can be cached readily in memory. However, it requires moving of data from one table to another if an attribute’s data type is changed. (This does not happen often, but mistakes can be made in metadata definition just as in database schema design.)

==Representing substructure: EAV with classes and relationships (EAV/CR)==

In a simple EAV design, the values of an attribute are simple or [[primitive data type]]s as far as the database engine is concerned. However, in EAV systems used for representation of highly diverse data, it is possible that a given object (class instance) may have substructure: that is, some of its attributes may represent other kinds of objects, which in turn may have substructure, to an arbitrary level of complexity. A car, for example, has an engine, a transmission, etc., and the engine has components such as cylinders.  (The permissible substructure for a given class is defined within the system's attribute metadata, as discussed later. Thus, for example, the attribute "random-access-memory" could apply to the class "computer" but not to the class "engine".)

To represent substructure, one incorporates a special EAV table where the value column contains references to ''other'' entities in the system (i.e., foreign key values into the objects table). To get all the information on a given object requires a recursive traversal of the metadata, followed by a recursive traversal of the data that stops when every attribute retrieved is simple (atomic). Recursive traversal is necessary whether details of an individual class are represented in conventional or EAV form; such traversal is performed in standard object–relational systems, for example. In practice, the number of levels of recursion tends to be relatively modest for most classes, so the performance penalties due to recursion are modest, especially with indexing of object IDs.

Its name is somewhat of a misnomer: while it was an outshoot of work on EAV systems, in practice, many or even most of the classes in such a system may be represented in standard relational form, based on whether the attributes are sparse or dense. EAV/CR is really characterized by its very detailed metadata, which is rich enough to support the automatic generation of browsing interfaces to individual classes without having to write class-by-class user-interface code. The basis of such browser interfaces is that it is possible to generate a batch of dynamic SQL queries that is independent of the class of the object, by first consulting its metadata and using metadata information to generate a sequence of queries against the data tables, and some of these queries may be arbitrarily recursive. This approach works well for object-at-a-time queries, as in Web-based browsing interfaces where clicking on the name of an object brings up all details of the object in a separate page: the metadata associated with that object's class also facilitates presentation of the object's details, because it includes captions of individual attributes, the order in which they are to be presented as well as how they are to be grouped.

One approach to EAV/CR is to allow columns to hold [[JSON]] structures, which thus provide the needed class structure. For example, [[PostgreSQL]], as of version 9.4, offers JSON binary column (JSONB) support, allowing JSON attributes to be queried, indexed and joined.

==The critical role of metadata in EAV systems==
In the words of Prof. Dr. Daniel Masys (formerly Chair of Vanderbilt University's Medical Informatics Department), the challenges of working with EAV stem from the fact that in an EAV database, the "physical schema" (the way data are stored) is radically different from the "logical schema"&amp;nbsp;– the way users, and many software applications such as statistics packages, regard it, i.e., as conventional rows and columns for individual classes. (Because an EAV table conceptually mixes apples, oranges, grapefruit and chop suey, if you want to do any analysis of the data using standard off-the-shelf software, in most cases you have to convert subsets of it into columnar form.&lt;ref name=Dinu2006&gt;{{citation

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of doing this, called [[pivot table|pivoting]], is important enough to be discussed separately.)

[[Metadata]] helps perform the sleight of hand that lets users interact with the system in terms of the logical schema rather than the physical: the software continually consults the metadata for various operations such as data presentation, interactive validation, bulk data extraction and [[ad hoc]] query. The metadata can actually be used to customize the behavior of the system.

EAV systems trade off simplicity in the physical and [[logical schema|logical structure]] of the data for complexity in their metadata, which, among other things, plays the role that [[database constraints]] and [[referential integrity]] do in standard database designs. Such a tradeoff is generally worthwhile, because in the typical mixed schema of production systems, the data in conventional relational tables can also benefit from functionality such as automatic interface generation. The structure of the metadata is complex enough that it comprises its own subschema within the database: various foreign keys in the data tables refer to tables within this subschema. This subschema is standard-relational, with features such as constraints and referential integrity being used to the hilt.

The correctness of the metadata contents, in terms of the intended system behavior, is critical and the task of ensuring correctness means that, when creating an EAV system, considerable design efforts must go into building user interfaces for metadata editing that can be used by people on the team who know the problem domain (e.g., clinical medicine) but are not necessarily programmers. (Historically, one of the main reasons why the pre-relational TMR system failed to be adopted at sites other than its home institution was that all metadata was stored in a single file with a non-intuitive structure. Customizing system behavior by altering the contents of this file, without causing the system to break, was such a delicate task that the system's authors only trusted themselves to do it.)

Where an EAV system is implemented through [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]], the [[RDF Schema]] language may conveniently be used to express such metadata. This Schema information may then be used by the EAV database engine to dynamically re-organize its internal table structure for best efficiency.&lt;ref name=GBpatent2384875&gt;{{Ref patent

Some final caveats regarding metadata:
* Because the business logic is in the metadata rather than explicit in the database schema (i.e., one level removed, compared with traditionally designed systems), it is less apparent to one who is unfamiliar with the system. Metadata-browsing and metadata-reporting tools are therefore important in ensuring the maintainability of an EAV system. In the common scenario where metadata is implemented as a relational sub-schema, these tools are nothing more than applications built using off-the-shelf reporting or querying tools that operate on the metadata tables.
* It is easy for an insufficiently knowledgeable user to corrupt (i.e., introduce inconsistencies and errors in) metadata. Therefore, access to metadata must be restricted, and an audit trail of accesses and changes put into place to deal with situations where multiple individuals have metadata access. Using an RDBMS for metadata will simplify the process of maintaining consistency during metadata creation and editing, by leveraging RDBMS features such as support for transactions. Also, if the metadata is part of the same database as the data itself, this ensures that it will be backed up at least as frequently as the data itself, so that it can be recovered to a point in time.
* The quality of the annotation and documentation within the metadata (i.e., the narrative/explanatory text in the descriptive columns of the metadata sub-schema) must be much higher, in order to facilitate understanding by various members of the development team. Ensuring metadata quality (and keeping it current as the system evolves) takes very high priority in the long-term management and maintenance of any design that uses an EAV component. Poorly-documented or out-of-date metadata can compromise the system's long-term viability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|asin=0857295098|title=Metadata-driven Software Systems in Biomedicine: Designing Systems that can adapt to Changing Knowledge|first=Prakash M.|last=Nadkarni|date=9 June 2011|publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nadkarni2011&gt;{{citation  | last = Nadkarni  | first = Prakash  | year = 2011 | title = Metadata-driven Software Systems in Biomedicine

==Information captured in metadata==

===Attribute metadata===
* '''Validation metadata''' include data type, range of permissible values or membership in a set of values, regular expression match, default value, and whether the value is permitted to be null. In EAV systems representing classes with substructure, the validation metadata will also record what class, if any, a given attribute belongs to.
* '''Presentation metadata''': how the attribute is to be displayed to the user (e.g., as a text box or image of specified dimensions, a pull-down list or a set of radio buttons). When a compound object is composed of multiple attributes, as in the EAV/CR design, there is additional metadata on the order in which the attributes should be presented, and how these attributes should optionally be grouped (under descriptive headings).
* For attributes which happen to be laboratory parameters, ''ranges of normal values'', which may vary by age, sex, physiological state and assay method, are recorded.
* '''Grouping metadata''': Attributes are typically presented as part of a higher-order group, e.g., a specialty-specific form. Grouping metadata includes information such as the order in which attributes are presented. Certain presentation metadata, such as fonts/colors and the number of attributes displayed per row, apply to the group as a whole.

===Advanced validation metadata===
*'''Dependency metadata''': in many user interfaces, entry of specific values into certain fields/attributes is required to either disable/hide certain other fields or enable/show other fields. (For example, if a user chooses the response "No" to a Boolean question "Does the patient have diabetes?", then subsequent questions about the duration of diabetes, medications for diabetes, etc. must be disabled.) To effect this in a generic framework involves storing of dependencies between the controlling attributes and the controlled attributes.
*'''Computations and complex validation''': As in a spreadsheet, the value of certain attributes can be computed, and displayed, based on values entered into fields that are presented earlier in sequence. (For example, body surface area is a function of height and width). Similarly, there may be "constraints" that must be true for the data to be valid: for example, in a differential white cell count, the sum of the counts of the individual white cell types must always equal 100, because the individual counts represent percentages. Computed formulas and complex validation are generally effected by storing expressions in the metadata that are macro-substituted with the values that the user enters and can be evaluated. In Web browsers, both [[JavaScript]] and [[VBScript]] have an Eval() function that can be leveraged for this purpose.

Validation, presentation and grouping metadata make possible the creation of code frameworks that support automatic user interface generation for both data browsing as well as interactive editing. In a production system that is delivered over the Web, the task of validation of EAV data is essentially moved from the back-end/database tier (which is powerless with respect to this task) to the middle /Web server tier. While back-end validation is always ideal, because it is impossible to subvert by attempting direct data entry into a table, middle tier validation through a generic framework is quite workable, though a significant amount of software design effort must go into building the framework first. The availability of [[Open-source software|open-source]] frameworks that can be studied and modified for individual needs can go a long way in avoiding wheel reinvention.

==Scenarios that are appropriate for EAV modeling==

EAV modeling, under the alternative terms "[[Data modeling#Generic data modeling|generic data modeling]]" or "open schema", has long been a standard tool for advanced data modelers. Like any advanced technique, it can be double-edged, and should be used judiciously.

Also, the employment of EAV does not preclude the employment of traditional relational database modeling approaches within the same database schema. In EMRs that rely on an RDBMS, such as [[Cerner]], which use an EAV approach for their clinical-data subschema, the vast majority of tables in the schema are in fact traditionally modeled, with attributes represented as individual columns rather than as rows.

The modeling of the metadata subschema of an EAV system, in fact, is a very good fit for traditional modeling, because of the inter-relationships between the various components of the metadata. In the TrialDB system, for example, the number of metadata tables in the schema outnumber the data tables by about ten to one. Because the correctness and consistency of metadata is critical to the correct operation of an EAV system, the system designer wants to take full advantages of all of the features that RDBMSs provide, such as referential integrity and programmable constraints, rather than having to reinvent the RDBMS-engine wheel. Consequently, the numerous metadata tables that support EAV designs are typically in third-normal relational form.

Commercial [[electronic health record]] Systems (EHRs) use row-modeling for classes of data such as diagnoses, surgical procedures performed on and laboratory test results, which are segregated into separate tables. In each table, the "entity" is a composite of the patient ID and the date/time the diagnosis was made (or the surgery or lab test performed); the attribute is a foreign key into a specially designated lookup table that contains a controlled vocabulary - e.g., [[ICD-10]] for diagnoses, [[Current Procedural Terminology]] for surgical procedures, with a set of value attributes. (E.g., for laboratory-test results, one may record the value measured, whether it is in the normal, low or high range, the ID of the person responsible for performing the test, the date/time the test was performed, and so on. As stated earlier, this is not a full-fledged EAV approach because the domain of attributes for a given table is restricted, just as the domain of product IDs in a supermarket's Sales table would be restricted to the domain of Products in a Products table.

However, to capture data on parameters that are not always defined in standard vocabularies, EHRs also provide a "pure" EAV mechanism, where specially designated power-users can define new attributes, their data type, maximum and minimal permissible values (or permissible set of values/codes), and then allow others to capture data based on these attributes. In the Epic (TM) EHR, this mechanism is termed "Flowsheets", and is commonly used to capture inpatient nursing observation data.

===Modeling sparse attributes===
The typical case for using the EAV model is for highly sparse, heterogeneous attributes, such as clinical parameters in the electronic medical record (EMRs), as stated above. Even here, however, it is accurate to state that the EAV modeling principle is applied to a ''sub-schema'' of the database rather than for all of its contents. (Patient demographics, for example, are most naturally modeled in one-column-per-attribute, traditional relational structure.)

Consequently, the arguments about EAV vs. "relational" design reflect incomplete understanding of the problem: An EAV design should be employed only for that sub-schema of a database where sparse attributes need to be modeled: even here, they need to be supported by [[third normal form]] metadata tables. There are relatively few database-design problems where sparse attributes are encountered: this is why the circumstances where EAV design is applicable are relatively rare. Even where they are encountered, a set of EAV tables is not the only way to address sparse data: an XML-based solution (discussed below) is applicable when the maximum number of attributes per entity is relatively modest, and the total volume of sparse data is also similarly modest. An example of this situation is the problems of capturing variable attributes for different product types.

Sparse attributes may also occur in E-commerce situations where an organization is purchasing or selling a vast and highly diverse set of commodities, with the details of individual categories of commodities being highly variable. The Magento E-commerce software &lt;ref&gt;The Magento database: concepts and architecture. URL: http://www.magentocommerce.com/wiki/2_-_magento_concepts_and_architecture/magento_database_diagram . Accessed July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; employs an EAV approach to address this issue.

===Modeling numerous classes with very few instances per class: highly dynamic schemas===
Another application of EAV is in modeling classes and attributes that, while not sparse, are dynamic, but where the number of data rows per class will be relatively modest&amp;nbsp;– a couple of hundred rows at most, but typically a few dozen – and the system developer is also required to provide a Web-based end-user interface within a very short turnaround time. "Dynamic" means that new classes and attributes need to be continually defined and altered to represent an evolving data model. This scenario can occur in rapidly evolving scientific fields as well as in ontology development, especially during the prototyping and iterative refinement phases.

While creation of new tables and columns to represent a new category of data is not especially labor-intensive, the programming of Web-based interfaces that support browsing or basic editing with type- and range-based validation is. In such a case, a more maintainable long-term solution is to create a framework where the class and attribute definitions are stored in metadata, and the software generates a basic user interface from this metadata dynamically.

The EAV/CR framework, mentioned earlier, was created to address this very situation. Note that an EAV data model is not essential here, but the system designer may consider it an acceptable alternative to creating, say, sixty or more tables containing a total of not more than two thousand rows. Here, because the number of rows per class is so few, efficiency considerations are less important; with the standard indexing by class ID/attribute ID, DBMS optimizers can easily cache the data for a small class in memory when running a query involving that class or attribute.

In the dynamic-attribute scenario, it is worth noting that [[Resource Description Framework]] (RDF) is being employed as the underpinning of Semantic-Web-related ontology work. RDF, intended to be a general method of representing information, is a form of EAV: an RDF triple comprises an object, a property, and a value.

At the end of Jon Bentley's book "Writing Efficient Programs", the author warns that making code more efficient generally also makes it harder to understand and maintain, and so one does not rush in and tweak code unless one has first determined that there '''is''' a performance problem, and measures such as code profiling have pinpointed the exact location of the bottleneck. Once you have done so, you modify only the specific code that needs to run faster. Similar considerations apply to EAV modeling: you apply it only to the sub-system where traditional relational modeling is known ''a priori'' to be unwieldy (as in the clinical data domain), or is discovered, during system evolution, to pose significant maintenance challenges. Database Guru (and currently a vice-president of Core Technologies at Oracle Corporation) Tom Kyte,&lt;ref&gt;Kyte, Thomas. Effective Oracle by Design. Oracle Press, McGraw-Hill Osborne Media. 21 August 2003. http://asktom.oracle.com/pls/asktom/f?p=100:11:0::::P11_QUESTION_ID:10678084117056&lt;/ref&gt; for example, correctly points out drawbacks of employing EAV in traditional business scenarios, and makes the point that mere "flexibility" is not a sufficient criterion for employing EAV. (However, he makes the sweeping claim that EAV should be avoided in ''all'' circumstances, even though Oracle's  Health Sciences division itself employs EAV to model clinical-data attributes in its commercial systems ClinTrial&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oracle.com/us/industries/life-sciences/health-sciences-clintrial-363570.html|title=Oracle Health Sciences Clintrial - Oracle|website=www.oracle.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Oracle Clinical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/health-sciences/e-clinical/clinical/index.html|title=Oracle Clinical - Overview - Oracle|website=www.oracle.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

==Working with EAV data==
The Achilles heel of EAV is the difficulty of working with large volumes of EAV data. It is often necessary to transiently or permanently inter-convert between columnar and row-or EAV-modeled representations of the same data; this can be both error-prone if done manually as well as CPU-intensive. Generic frameworks that utilize attribute and attribute-grouping metadata address the former but not the latter limitation; their use is more or less mandated in the case of mixed schemas that contain a mixture of conventional-relational and EAV data, where the error quotient can be very significant.

The conversion operation is called '''[[pivot table|pivoting]]'''. Pivoting is not required only for EAV data but also for any form or row-modeled data. (For example, implementations of the [[Apriori algorithm]] for Association Analysis, widely used to process supermarket sales data to identify other products that purchasers of a given product are also likely to buy, pivot row-modeled data as a first step.) Many database engines have proprietary SQL extensions to facilitate pivoting, and packages such as Microsoft Excel also support it. The circumstances where pivoting is necessary are considered below.

*'''Browsing''' of modest amounts of data for an individual entity, optionally followed by data editing based on inter-attribute dependencies. This operation is facilitated by caching the modest amounts of the requisite supporting metadata. Some programs, such as TrialDB, access the metadata to generate semi-static Web pages that contain embedded programming code as well as data structures holding metadata.
*'''Bulk extraction''' transforms large (but predictable) amounts of data (e.g., a clinical study’s complete data) into a set of relational tables. While CPU-intensive, this task is infrequent and does not need to be done in real-time; i.e., the user can wait for a batched process to complete. The importance of bulk extraction cannot be overestimated, especially when the data is to be processed or analyzed with standard third-party tools that are completely unaware of EAV structure. Here, it is not advisable to try to reinvent entire sets of wheels through a generic framework, and it is best just to bulk-extract EAV data into relational tables and then work with it using standard tools.
*'''Ad hoc query''' interfaces to row- or EAV-modeled data, when queried from the perspective of individual attributes, (e.g., "retrieve all patients with the presence of liver disease, with signs of liver failure and no history of alcohol abuse") must typically show the results of the query with individual attributes as separate columns. For most EAV database scenarios ad hoc query performance must be tolerable, but sub-second responses are not necessary, since the queries tend to be exploratory in nature.

===Relational division===
However, the structure of EAV data model is a perfect candidate for Relational Division, see [[relational algebra]]. With a good indexing strategy it's possible to get a response time in less than a few hundred milliseconds on a billion row EAV table. Microsoft SQL Server MVP Peter Larsson has proved this on a laptop and made the solution general available.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sqlservercentral.com/articles/Editorial/105414/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Optimizing pivoting performance===
* One possible optimization is the use of a separate "'''warehouse'''" or queryable schema whose contents are refreshed in batch mode from the production (transaction) schema. See [[data warehousing]]. The tables in the warehouse are heavily indexed and optimized using [[denormalization]], which combines multiple tables into one to minimize performance penalty due to table joins. This is the approach that [[Kalido]] uses to convert highly normalized EAV tables to standard reporting schemas.
* Certain EAV data in a warehouse may be converted into standard tables using "'''materialized views'''" (see [[data warehouse]]), but this is generally a last resort that must be used carefully, because the number of views of this kind tends to grow non-linearly with the number of attributes in a system.&lt;ref name="Dinu2006"/&gt;
* '''In-memory data structures''': One can use hash tables and two-dimensional arrays in memory in conjunction with attribute-grouping metadata to pivot data, one group at a time. This data is written to disk as a flat delimited file, with the internal names for each attribute in the first row: this format can be readily bulk-imported into a relational table. This "in-memory" technique significantly outperforms alternative approaches by keeping the queries on EAV tables as simple as possible and minimizing the number of I/O operations.&lt;ref name="Dinu2006"/&gt; Each statement retrieves a large amount of data, and the hash tables help carry out the pivoting operation, which involves placing a value for a given attribute instance into the appropriate row and column. Random Access Memory (RAM) is sufficiently abundant and affordable in modern hardware that the complete data set for a single attribute group in even large data sets will usually fit completely into memory, though the algorithm can be made smarter by working on slices of the data if this turns out not to be the case.

Obviously, no matter what approaches you take, querying EAV will not be as fast as querying standard column-modeled relational data for certain types of query, in much the same way that access of elements in sparse matrices are not as fast as those on non-sparse matrices if the latter fit entirely into main memory. (Sparse matrices, represented using structures such as linked lists, require list traversal to access an element at a given X-Y position, while access to elements in matrices represented as 2-D arrays can be performed using fast CPU register operations.) If, however, you chose the EAV approach correctly for the problem that you were trying to solve, this is the price that you pay; in this respect, EAV modeling is an example of a space (and schema maintenance) versus CPU-time tradeoff.

== Consideration for PostgreSQL: JSONB columns ==
PostgreSQL version 9.4 includes support for [[JSON]] binary columns (JSONB), which can be queried, indexed and joined. This allows performance improvements by factors of a thousand or more over traditional EAV table designs.&lt;ref name="Coussement"&gt;Jeroen Coussement, "[https://coussej.github.io/2016/01/14/Replacing-EAV-with-JSONB-in-PostgreSQL/ Replacing EAV with JSONB in PostgreSQL]" (2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consideration for SQL Server 2008 and later: Sparse columns==

Microsoft SQL Server 2008 offers a (proprietary) alternative to EAV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc280604.aspx|title=Use Sparse Columns|first=|last=BYHAM|website=msdn.microsoft.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Columns with an atomic data type (e.g., numeric, varchar or datetime columns) can be designated as ''sparse'' simply by including the word SPARSE in the column definition of the CREATE TABLE statement. Sparse columns optimize the storage of NULL values (which now take up no space at all) and are useful when the majority records in a table will have NULL values for that column. Indexes on sparse columns are also optimized: only those rows with values are indexed. In addition, the contents of all sparse columns in a particular row of a table can be collectively aggregated into a single XML column (a column set), whose contents are of the form &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;column-name&gt;column contents &lt;/column-name&gt;]*....&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; In fact, if a column set is defined for a table as part of a CREATE TABLE statement, all sparse columns subsequently defined are typically added to it. This has the interesting consequence that the SQL statement &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;SELECT * from &lt;tablename&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; will not return the individual sparse columns, but concatenate all of them into a single XML column whose name is that of the column set (which therefore acts as a virtual, computed column).Sparse columns are convenient for business applications such as product information, where the applicable attributes can be highly variable depending on the product type, but where the total number of variable attributes per product type are relatively modest.

=== Limitations of Sparse Attributes ===
However, this approach to modeling sparse attributes has several limitations: rival DBMSs have, notably, chosen not to borrow this idea for their own engines. Limitations include:

* The maximum number of sparse columns in a table is 10,000, which may fall short for some implementations, such as for storing clinical data, where the possible number of attributes is one order of magnitude larger. Therefore, this is not a solution for modeling *all* possible clinical attributes for a patient.
* Addition of new attributes &amp;nbsp;– one of the primary reasons an EAV model might be sought –  still requires a DBA. Further, the problem of building a user interface to sparse attribute data is not addressed: only the storage mechanism is streamlined.  * Applications can be written to dynamically add and remove sparse columns from a table at run-time: in contrast, an attempt to perform such an action in a multi-user scenario where other users/processes are still using the table would be prevented for tables without sparse columns. However, while this capability offers power and flexibility, it invites abuse, and should be used judiciously and infrequently. 
** It can result in significant performance penalties, in part because any compiled query plans that use this table are automatically invalidated. 
** Dynamic column addition or removal is an operation that should be audited, because column removal can cause data loss: allowing an application to modify a table without maintaining some kind of a trail, including a justification for the action, is not good software practice. 
* SQL constraints (e.g., range checks, regular expression checks) cannot be applied to sparse columns. The only check that is applied is for correct data type. Constraints would have to be implemented in metadata tables and middle-tier code, as is done in production EAV systems. (This consideration also applies to business applications as well.)
* SQL Server has limitations on row size if attempting to change the storage format of a column: the total contents of all atomic-datatype columns, sparse and non-sparse, in a row that contain data cannot exceed 8016 bytes if that table contains a sparse column for the data to be automatically copied over. 
* Sparse columns that happen to contain data have a storage overhead of 4 bytes per column in addition to storage for the data type itself (e.g., 4 bytes for datetime columns). This impacts the amount of sparse-column data that you can associate with a given row. This size restriction is relaxed for the varchar data type, which means that, if one hits row-size limits in a production system, one has to work around it by designating sparse columns as varchar even though they may have a different intrinsic data type. Unfortunately, this approach now subverts server-side data-type checking.

== EAV vs. the Universal Data Model==
Originally postulated by Maier, Ullman and Vardi,&lt;ref&gt;David Maier, Jeffrey Ullman, Moshe Vardi. On the foundations of the universal relation model. ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS). Volume 9 Issue 2, June 1984. Pages 283-308. URL: http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=318580&lt;/ref&gt; the "Universal Data Model" (UDM) seeks to simplify the query of a complex relational schema by naive users, by creating the illusion that everything is stored in a single giant "universal table". It does this  by utilizing inter-table relationships, so that the user does not need to be concerned about what table contains what attribute. C.J. Date, however,&lt;ref&gt;On Universal Database Design. In "An Introduction to Database Systems", 8th edn, Pearson/Addison Wesley, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; pointed out that in circumstances where a table is multiply related to another (as in genealogy databases, where an individual's father and mother are also individuals, or in some business databases where all addresses are stored centrally, and an organization can have different office addresses and shipping addresses), there is insufficient metadata within the database schema to specify unambiguous joins. When UDM has been commercialized, as in SAP [[BusinessObjects]], this limitation is worked around through the creation of "Universes", which are relational views with predefined joins between sets of tables: the "Universe" developer disambiguates ambiguous joins by including the multiply-related table in a view multiple times using different aliases.

Apart from the way in which data is explicitly modeled (UDM simply uses relational views to intercede between the user and the database schema), EAV differs from Universal Data Models in that it also applies to transactional systems, not only query oriented (read-only) systems as in UDM. Also, when used as the basis for clinical-data query systems, EAV implementations do not necessarily shield the user from having to specify the class of an object of interest. In the EAV-based i2b2 clinical data mart,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
 | pmc=3000779| year=2010| author1=Murphy| first1=S. N.| title=Serving the enterprise and beyond with informatics for integrating biology and the bedside (i2b2)| journal=Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association| volume=17| issue=2| pages=124–130| last2=Weber| first2=G| last3=Mendis| first3=M| last4=Gainer| first4=V| last5=Chueh| first5=H.

For example,  the phrase "[[lithium]]" can refer either to the medication (which is used to treat [[bipolar disorder]]), or a laboratory assay for lithium level in the patient's blood. (The blood level of lithium must be monitored carefully: too much of the drug causes severe side effects, while too little is ineffective.)

==XML and JSON==

An Open Schema implementation can use an XML column in a table to capture the variable/sparse information.&lt;ref name="sarka"&gt;Itzik Ben-Gan, Dejan Sarka, ''Inside Microsoft SQL Server 2008: T-SQL Programming'' (Microsoft Press)&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar ideas can be applied to databases that support [[JSON]]-valued columns: sparse, hierarchical data can be represented as JSON.  If the database has JSON support, such as PostgreSQL and (partially) SQL Server 2016 and later, then attributes can be queried, indexed and joined. This can offer performance improvements of over 1000x over naive EAV implementations.,&lt;ref name="Coussement"/&gt; but does not necessarily make the overall database application more robust.

Note that there are two ways in which XML or JSON data can be stored: one way is to store it as a plain string, opaque to the database server; the other way is to use a database server that can "see into" the structure. There are obviously some severe drawbacks to storing opaque strings: these cannot be queried directly, one cannot form an index based on their contents, and it is impossible to perform joins based on the content.

Building an application that has to manage data gets extremely complicated when using EAV models, because of the extent of infrastructure that has to be developed in terms of metadata tables and application-framework code. Using XML solves the problem of server-based data validation (which must be done by middle-tier and browser-based code in EAV-based frameworks), but has the following drawbacks:

* It is programmer-intensive. XML schemas are notoriously tricky to write by hand, a recommended approach is to create them by defining relational tables, generating XML-schema code, and then dropping these tables. This is problematic in many production operations involving dynamic schemas, where new attributes are required to be defined by power-users who understand a specific application domain (e.g. inventory management or biomedicine) but are not necessarily programmers. By contrast, in production systems that use EAV, such users define new attributes (and the data-type and validation checks associated with each) through a GUI application. Because the validation-associated metadata is required to be stored in multiple relational tables in a normalized design, a GUI application that ties these tables together and enforces the appropriate metadata-consistency checks is the only practical way to allow entry of attribute information, even for advanced developers - even if the end-result uses XML or JSON instead of separate relational tables.
* The server-based diagnostics that result with an XML/JSON solution if incorrect data is attempted to be inserted (e.g., range check or regular-expression pattern violations) are cryptic to the end-user: to convey the error accurately, one would, at the least, need to associate a detailed and user-friendly error diagnostic with each attribute.
* The solution does not address the user-interface-generation problem.

All of the above drawbacks are remediable by creating a layer of metadata and application code, but in creating this, the original "advantage" of not having to create a framework has vanished. The fact is that modeling sparse data attributes robustly is a hard database-application-design problem no matter which storage approach is used. Sarka's work,&lt;ref name="sarka"/&gt; however, proves the viability of using an XML field instead of type-specific relational EAV tables for the data-storage layer, and in situations where the number of attributes per entity is modest (e.g., variable product attributes for different product types) the XML-based solution is more compact than an EAV-table-based one. (XML itself may be regarded as a means of attribute-value data representation, though it is based on structured text rather than on relational tables.)

==Graph databases==
An alternative approach to managing the various problems encountered with EAV-structured data is to employ a [[graph database]]. These represent entities as the nodes of a graph or [[hypergraph]], and attributes as links or edges of that graph. The issue of table joins are addressed by providing graph-specific query languages, such as [[Apache]] TinkerPop,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tinkerpop.apache.org/|title=Apache TinkerPop|first=Apache|last=TinkerPop|website=tinkerpop.apache.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[OpenCog]] atomspace pattern matcher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.opencog.org/w/Pattern_matching|title=Pattern matching - OpenCog|website=wiki.opencog.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==EAV and cloud computing==
Many [[cloud computing]] vendors offer data stores based on the EAV model, where an arbitrary number of attributes can be associated with a given entity. Roger Jennings provides an in-depth comparison&lt;ref name=Jennings2009&gt;{{citation
 | last1 = Jennings
 | first1 = Roger
 | year = 2009
 | title = Retire your Data Center
 | journal = Visual Studio Magazine
 | volume = February 2009
 | pages = 14–25
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of these. In Amazon's offering, SimpleDB, the data type is limited to strings, and data that is intrinsically non-string must be coerced to string (e.g., numbers must be padded with leading zeros) if you wish to perform operations such as sorting. Microsoft's offering, Windows Azure Table Storage, offers a limited set of data types: byte[], bool, DateTime, double, Guid, int, long and string [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd179338.aspx]. The Google App Engine [https://code.google.com/appengine/docs/whatisgoogleappengine.html] offers the greatest variety of data types: in addition to dividing numeric data into int, long, or float, it also defines custom data types such as phone number, E-mail address, geocode and hyperlink. Google, but not Amazon or Microsoft, lets you define metadata that would prevent invalid attributes from being associated with a particular class of entity, by letting you create a metadata model.

Google lets you operate on the data using a subset of SQL; Microsoft offer a URL-based querying syntax that is abstracted via a [[LINQ]] provider; Amazon offer a more limited syntax. Of concern, built-in support for combining different entities through joins is currently (April '10) non-existent with all three engines. Such operations have to be performed by application code. This may not be a concern if the application servers are co-located with the data servers at the vendor's data center, but a lot of network traffic would be generated if the two were geographically separated.

An EAV approach is justified only when the attributes that are being modeled are numerous and sparse: if the data being captured does not meet this requirement, the cloud vendors' default EAV approach is often a mismatch for applications that require a true back-end database (as opposed to merely a means of persistent data storage). Retrofitting the vast majority of existing database applications, which use a traditional data-modeling approach, to an EAV-type cloud architecture, would require major surgery. Microsoft discovered, for example, that its database-application-developer base was largely reluctant to invest such effort. More recently, therefore, Microsoft has provided a premium offering&amp;nbsp;–  a cloud-accessible full-fledged relational engine, SQL Server Azure, which allows porting of existing database applications with modest changes.

One limitation of SQL Azure is that physical databases are limited to 500GB in size {{As of|2015|1|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/03/microsofts-azure-sql-can-now-store-up-to-500gb-gets-99-95-sla-and-adds-self-service-recovery/|title=Microsoft’s Azure SQL Can Now Store Up To 500GB, Gets 99.95% SLA And Adds Self-Service Recovery - TechCrunch|first=Frederic|last=Lardinois|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft recommends that data sets larger than this be split into multiple physical databases and accessed with parallel queries.

==Tree structures and relational databases==
There exist several other approaches for the representation of tree-structured data, be it [[XML]], [[JSON]] or other formats, such as the [[nested set model]], in a relational database. On the other hand, database vendors have begun to include JSON and XML support into their data structures and query features, like in [[IBM DB2]], where XML data is stored as XML separate from the tables, using [[Xpath]] queries as part of SQL statements, or in [[PostgreSQL]], with a JSON data type&lt;ref&gt;Postgres 9.6, "[https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/datatype-json.html JSON Types]"&lt;/ref&gt; that can be indexed and queried. These developments accomplish, improve or substitute the EAV model approach.

It should be noted, however, that the uses of JSON and XML are not necessarily the same as the use of an EAV model, though they can overlap. XML is preferable to EAV for arbitrarily hierarchical data that is relatively modest in volume for a single entity: it is not intended to scale up to the multi-gigabyte level with respect to data-manipulation performance.{{citation needed|reason=Really? Why not? Is this due to design flaws? Bugs? Incomplete implementations? Some theoretical reason?|date=November 2016}} XML is not concerned per-se with the sparse-attribute problem, and when the data model underlying the information to be represented can be decomposed straightforwardly into a relational structure, XML is better suited as a means of data interchange than as a primary storage mechanism. EAV, as stated earlier, is specifically (and only) applicable to the sparse-attribute scenario. When such a scenario holds, the use of datatype-specific attribute-value tables than can be indexed by entity, by attribute, and by value and manipulated through simple SQL statements is vastly more scalable than the use of an XML tree structure.{{citation needed|reason=Really? This seems blatantly false, given industry efforts.|date=November 2016}}  The Google App Engine, mentioned above,{{citation needed|reason=It is not mentioned above. Maybe that section was deleted|date=November 2016}} uses strongly-typed-value tables for a good reason.{{citation needed|reason=what reason is that?|date=November 2016}}

==History of EAV database systems==
EAV, as a general-purpose means of [[knowledge representation]], originated with the concept of "[[Associative array|association lists]]" ([[attribute-value pair]]s). Commonly used today, these were first introduced in the language [[LISP]].&lt;ref name=LispManual2007&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Attribute-value pairs are widely used for diverse applications, such as configuration files (using a simple syntax like ''attribute = value''). An example of non-database use of EAV is in [[UIMA]] (Uniform Information Management Architecture), a standard now managed by the [[Apache Foundation]] and employed in areas such as [[natural language processing]]. Software that analyses text typically marks up ("annotates") a segment: the example provided in the UIMA tutorial is a program that performs [[named-entity recognition]] (NER) on a document, annotating the text segment "President Bush" with the annotation-attribute-value triple ''(Person, Full_Name, "George W. Bush")''.&lt;ref&gt;Apache Foundation, UIMA Tutorials and Users Guides. url: http://uima.apache.org/downloads/releaseDocs/2.1.0-incubating/docs/html/tutorials_and_users_guides/tutorials_and_users_guides.html. Accessed Oct 2012,&lt;/ref&gt; Such annotations may be stored in a database table.

While EAV does not have a direct connection to AV-pairs, Stead and Hammond appear to be the first to have conceived of their use for persistent storage of arbitrarily complex data.&lt;ref name=Stead1982&gt;{{citation

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (The Regenstrief system actually used a Patient-Attribute-Timestamp-Value design: the use of the timestamp supported retrieval of values for a given patient/attribute in chronological order.) All these systems, developed in the 1970s, were released before commercial systems based on [[Edgar F. Codd|E.F. Codd]]'s [[relational database]] model were available, though HELP was much later ported to a relational architecture and commercialized by the 3M corporation. (Note that while Codd's landmark paper was published in 1970, its heavily mathematical tone had the unfortunate effect of diminishing its accessibility among non-computer-science types and consequently delaying the model's acceptance in IT and software-vendor circles. The value of the subsequent contribution of [[Christopher J. Date]], Codd's colleague at IBM, in translating these ideas into accessible language, accompanied by simple examples that illustrated their power, cannot be overestimated.)

[http://senselab.med.yale.edu/ SenseLab], a publicly accessible neuroscience database, is built with the EAV/CR framework. Additionally, there are numerous commercial applications that use aspects of EAV internally including Oracle Designer (applied to ER modeling), Kalido (applied to [[data warehousing]] and [[master data management]]), and Lazysoft Sentences (applied to custom software development).
An EAV system that does not sit on top of a tabular structure but instead directly on a [[B Tree]] is [[InfinityDB]], which eliminates the need for one table per value data type.&lt;ref&gt;http://boilerbay.com/infinitydb/ItemSpaceDataStructures.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Environmental history''' is the study of human interaction with the natural world over time, emphasising the active role nature plays in influencing human affairs and vice versa.

Environmental history emerged in the United States out of the [[environmentalism|environmental movement]] of the 1960s and 1970s, and much of its impetus still stems from present-day global environmental concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacEachern|Turkel|2009|p=xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field was founded on conservation issues but has broadened in scope to include more general social and scientific history and may deal with cities, population or [[sustainability|sustainable development]]. As all history occurs in the natural world, environmental history tends to focus on particular time-scales, geographic regions, or key themes. It is also a strongly multidisciplinary subject that draws widely on both the humanities and natural science.

The subject matter of environmental history can be divided into three main components.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Worster|1988|p=293}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first, nature itself and its change over time, includes the physical impact of humans on the Earth's [[landform|land]], [[water]], [[atmosphere]] and [[biosphere]]. The second category, how humans use nature, includes the environmental consequences of increasing [[population]], more effective [[technology]] and changing patterns of [[Outline of industrial organization|production]] and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]]. Other key themes are the transition from nomadic hunter-gatherer communities to settled agriculture in the [[neolithic revolution]], the effects of [[colonial expansion]] and [[Human settlement|settlements]], and the environmental and human consequences of the [[industrial revolution|industrial]] and [[technological revolution]]s.&lt;ref name=Grove4&gt;See {{Harvnb|Grove|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, environmental historians study how people think about nature - the way [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], [[belief]]s and [[Value (personal and cultural)|value]]s influence interaction with nature, especially in the form of [[myth]]s, [[religion]] and [[science]].

==Origin of name and early works==
{{Main|Roderick Nash}}
In 1967 [[Roderick Nash]] published "''Wilderness and the American Mind''", a work that has become a classic text of early environmental history. In an address to the ''Organization of American Historians'' in 1969 (published in 1970) Nash used the expression "environmental history",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Nash|1970|pp=249–260}}&lt;/ref&gt; although 1972 is generally taken as the date when the term was first coined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nash|1972|p=362}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1959 book by [[Samuel P. Hays]], ''Conservation and the Gospel of Efficiency: The Progressive Conservation Movement, 1890-1920'', while being a major contribution to American political history, is now also regarded as a founding document in the field of environmental history.  Hays is Professor Emeritus of History at the [[University of Pittsburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120426023137/http://www.historyforthefuture.org/wordpress/?p=46 Samuel P. Hays on National Forests and Ecology], ''History for the Future'', [[WRCT]], Pittsburgh&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historiography==
Brief overviews of the [[historiography]] of environmental history have been given by [[J. R. McNeill]],&lt;ref name=McNeill3 /&gt; [[Richard White (historian)|Richard White]],&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb|White|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[J. Donald Hughes]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb|Hughes|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 [[Oxford University Press]] published a volume of 25 essays called ''The Oxford Handbook of Environmental History''.

===Definition===
There is no universally accepted definition of environmental history. In general terms it is a history that tries to explain why our environment is like it is and how humanity has influenced its current condition, as well as commenting on the problems and opportunities of tomorrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dovers|1994|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donald Worster]]'s widely quoted 1988 definition states that environmental history is the "interaction between human cultures and the environment in the past".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Worster|1988|p=289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, J. Donald Hughes defined the subject as the “study of human relationships through time with the natural communities of which they are a part in order to explain the processes of change that affect that relationship”.&lt;ref name=Hughes4&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2001|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 2006, as "history that seeks understanding of human beings as they have lived, worked and thought in relationship to the rest of nature through the changes brought by time".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2006|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; "As a method, environmental history is the use of ecological analysis as a means of understanding human history...an account of changes in human societies as they relate to changes in the natural environment”.&lt;ref name=Hughes4 /&gt; Environmental historians are also interested in "what people think about nature, and how they have expressed those ideas in folk religions, popular culture, literature and art”.&lt;ref name=Hughes4 /&gt; In 2003, [[J. R. McNeill]] defined it as "the history of the mutual relations between humankind and the rest of nature".&lt;ref name=McNeill3&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|2003|pp=5–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subject matter===
Traditional [[history|historical analysis]] has over time extended its range of study from the activities and influence of a few significant people to a much broader social, political, economic, and cultural analysis. Environmental history further broadens the subject matter of conventional history. In 1988, Donald Worster stated that environmental history “attempts to make history more inclusive in its narratives”&lt;ref name=Worster290&gt;{{Harvnb|Worster|1988|p=290}}&lt;/ref&gt; by examining the “''role and place of nature in human life''”,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Worster|1988|p=292}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1993, that “Environmental history explores the ways in which the biophysical world has influenced the course of human history and the ways in which people have thought about and tried to transform their surroundings''”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Worster|1993|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interdependency of human and environmental factors in the creation of landscapes is expressed through the notion of the [[cultural landscape]]. Worster also questioned the scope of the discipline, asking: "''We study humans and nature; therefore can anything human or natural be outside our enquiry?''"&lt;ref name="Worster1988"&gt;{{Harvnb|Worster|1988|p=306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental history is generally treated as a subfield of [[history]]. But some environmental historians challenge this assumption, arguing that while traditional history is human history – the story of people and their institutions,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dovers|1994|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; "humans cannot place themselves outside the principles of nature".&lt;ref name=hughes8&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2008|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, they argue that environmental history is a version of human history within a larger context, one less dependent on [[anthropocentrism]] (even though [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] change is at the center of its narrative).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2008|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dimensions====
[[File:Penn oil 1864.jpg|thumb|General view of Funkville in 1864, Oil Creek, Pennsylvania, USA]]
J. Donald Hughes responded to the view that environmental history is "''light on theory''" or lacking theoretical structure by viewing the subject through the lens of three "dimensions": nature and culture, history and science, and scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2008|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This advances beyond Worster's recognition of three broad clusters of issues to be addressed by environmental historians although both historians recognize that the emphasis of their categories might vary according to the particular study&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Worster|1988|pp=289–308}}&lt;/ref&gt; as, clearly, some studies will concentrate more on society and human affairs and others more on the environment.

====Themes====
Several themes are used to express these historical dimensions. A more traditional historical approach is to analyse the transformation of the globe’s ecology through themes like the separation of man from nature during the [[neolithic revolution]], [[imperialism]] and [[colonial expansion]], [[exploration]], [[history of agriculture|agricultural change]], the effects of the [[industrial revolution|industrial]] and [[technological revolution]], and [[urban expansion]]. More environmental topics include human impact through influences on [[forestry]], [[fire]], [[climate change]], [[sustainability]] and so on. According to [[Paul Warde]], “''the increasingly sophisticated history of colonization and migration can take on an environmental aspect, tracing the pathways of ideas and species around the globe and indeed is bringing about an increased use of such analogies and ‘colonial’ understandings of processes within European history.''”&lt;ref name="Warde 2007"&gt;See {{Harvnb|Warde|Sorlin|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of the colonial enterprise in Africa, the Caribbean and Indian Ocean has been detailed by [[Richard Grove]].&lt;ref name=Grove4 /&gt; 
Much of the literature consists of case-studies targeted at the global, national and local levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2006|pp=53–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scale====
Although environmental history can cover billions of years of history over the whole Earth, it can equally concern itself with local scales and brief time periods.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb|Krech|McNeill|Merchant|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many environmental historians are occupied with local, regional and national histories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2006|pp=53–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians link their subject exclusively to the span of human history – "''every time period in human history''"&lt;ref name=hughes8 /&gt; while others include the period before human presence on Earth as a legitimate part of the discipline. [[Ian Simmons (geographer)|Ian Simmons]]'s ''Environmental History of Great Britain'' covers a period of about 10,000 years. There is a tendency to difference in time scales between natural and social phenomena: the causes of environmental change that stretch back in time may be dealt with socially over a comparatively brief period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dovers|1994|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although at all times environmental influences have extended beyond particular geographic regions and cultures, during the 20th and early 21st centuries anthropogenic environmental change has assumed global proportions, most prominently with climate change but also as a result of settlement, the spread of disease and the globalization of world trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2006|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Muir and Roosevelt restored.jpg|thumb|left|Nature preservationist [[John Muir]] with U.S. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] (left) on [[Glacier Point]] in [[Yosemite National Park]]]]

The questions of environmental history date back to antiquity, including &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2006|pp=18–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hippocrates]], the father of medicine, who asserted that different cultures and human temperaments could be related to the surroundings in which peoples lived in ''Airs, Waters, Places''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2006|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars as varied as [[Ibn Khaldun]] and [[Montesquieu]] found climate to be a key determinant of human behavior.&lt;ref name="eolss"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McNeill|first1=J. R.|title=The Historiography of Environmental History|journal=World Environmental History|url=https://www.eolss.net/sample-chapters/C09/E6-156-01-00.pdf|accessdate=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], there was a rising awareness of the environment and scientists addressed themes of sustainability via natural history and medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eddy|first1=Matthew Daniel|title=The Language of Mineralogy: John Walker, Chemistry and the Edinburgh Medical School 1750-1800|date=2008 |publisher=Ashgate| url= https://www.academia.edu/1112014/The_Language_of_Mineralogy_John_Walker_Chemistry_and_the_Edinburgh_Medical_School_1750-1800_2008_}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the origins of the subject in its present form are generally traced to the 20th century.

In 1929 a group of French historians founded the journal ''Annales'', in many ways a forerunner of modern environmental history since it took as its subject matter the reciprocal global influences of the environment and human society. The idea of the impact of the physical environment on civilizations was espoused by this [[Annales School]] to describe the long term developments that shape human history&lt;ref name="Worster1988" /&gt; by focusing away from political and intellectual history, toward [[agriculture]], [[demography]], and [[geography]]. [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]], a pupil of the Annales School, was the first to really embrace, in the 1950s, environmental history in a more contemporary form.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb|McNeill|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most influential members of the Annales School was [[Lucien Febvre]] (1878–1956), whose book ''A Geographical Introduction to History'' is now a classic in the field.

The most influential empirical and theoretical work in the subject has been done in the United States where teaching programs first emerged and a generation of trained environmental historians is now active.&lt;ref name="Warde 2007"/&gt; In the United States environmental history as an independent field of study emerged in the general cultural reassessment and reform of the 1960s and 1970s along with environmentalism, "conservation history",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/history/history/hisnps/NPSThinking/nps-oah.htm Adam Rome "Conservation, Preservation, and Environmental Activism: A Survey  of the Historical Literature"]. Retrieved 2010-8-8.&lt;/ref&gt; and a gathering awareness of the global scale of some environmental issues. This was in large part a reaction to the way nature was represented in history at the time, which “portrayed the advance of culture and technology as releasing humans from dependence on the natural world and providing them with the means to manage it [and] celebrated human mastery over other forms of life and the natural environment, and expected technological improvement and economic growth to accelerate”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2001|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental historians intended to develop a post-colonial historiography that was "''more inclusive in its narratives''".&lt;ref name=Worster290 /&gt;

===Moral and political inspiration===
Moral and political inspiration to environmental historians has come from  American writers and activists such as [[Henry David Thoreau|Henry Thoreau]], [[John Muir]], [[Aldo Leopold]], and [[Rachel Carson]]. Environmental history "frequently promoted a moral and political agenda although it steadily became a more scholarly enterprise".&lt;ref name="Worster290"/&gt; Early attempts to define the field were made in the United States by [[Roderick Nash]] in “The State of Environmental History” and in other works by frontier historians [[Frederick Jackson Turner]], [[James Malin]], and [[Walter Prescott Webb]], who analyzed the process of settlement. Their work was expanded by a second generation of more specialized environmental historians such as [[Alfred Crosby]], [[Samuel P. Hays]], [[Donald Worster]], [[William Cronon]], [[Richard White (historian)|Richard White]], [[Carolyn Merchant]], [[J. R. McNeill]], [[Donald Hughes]], and Chad Montrie in the United States and [[Paul Warde]], [[Sverker Sorlin]], [[Robert A. Lambert]], [[T.C. Smout]], and Peter Coates in Europe.

===British Empire===
Although environmental history was growing rapidly after 1970, it only reached [[Historiography of the British Empire|historians of the British Empire]] in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robin Winks, ed.|title=The Oxford History of the British Empire: Volume V: Historiography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=68w-855pL-MC|year=1999|pages=664–65|isbn=9780191647697}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Madhav  Gadgil and Ramachandra  Guha, ''This fissured land: an ecological history of India'' (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John M. MacKenzie, ''The empire of nature: Hunting, conservation and British Imperialism'' (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory Barton argues that the concept of environmentalism emerged from forestry studies, and emphasizes the British imperial role in that research.  He argues that imperial forestry movement in India around 1900 included government reservations, new methods of fire protection, and attention to revenue-producing forest management. The result eased the fight between romantic preservationists and laissez-faire businessmen, thus giving the compromise from which modern environmentalism emerged.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Barton, "Empire forestry and the origins of environmentalism." ''Journal of Historical Geography'' 27#4 (2001): 529-552.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years numerous scholars cited by James Beattie have examined the environmental impact of the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;James Beattie, "Recent Themes in the Environmental History of the British Empire," ''History Compass'' (Feb 2012) 10#2 pp 129-139&lt;/ref&gt;   Beinart and Hughes argue that the discovery and commercial or scientific use of new plants was an important concern in the 18th and 19th centuries. The efficient use of rivers through dams and irrigation projects was an expensive but important method of raising agricultural productivity. Searching for more efficient ways of using natural resources, the British moved flora, fauna and commodities around the world, sometimes resulting in ecological disruption and radical environmental change. Imperialism also stimulated more modern attitudes toward nature and subsidized botany and agricultural research.&lt;ref&gt;William Beinart  and Lotte Hughes. ''Environment and empire'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholars have used the British Empire to examine the utility of the new concept of eco-cultural networks as a lens for examining interconnected, wide-ranging social and environmental processes.&lt;ref&gt;James Beattie, Edward Melillo, and Emily O'Gorman.

In the United States the [[American Society for Environmental History]] was founded in 1975 while the first institute devoted specifically to environmental history in Europe was established in 1991, based at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. In 1986, the Dutch foundation for the history of environment and hygiene ''[[Net Werk]]'' was founded and publishes four newsletters per year. In the UK the [[White Horse Press]] in Cambridge has, since 1995, published the journal ''[[Environment and History]]'' which aims to bring scholars in the humanities and biological sciences closer together in constructing long and well-founded perspectives on present day environmental problems and a similar publication ''[[Tijdschrift voor Ecologische Geschiedenis]]'' (''Journal for Environmental History'') is a combined Flemish-Dutch initiative mainly dealing with topics in the Netherlands and Belgium although it also has an interest in European environmental history. Each issue contains abstracts in English, French and German. In 1999 the Journal was converted into a yearbook for environmental history. In Canada the [[Network in Canadian History and Environment]] facilitates the growth of environmental history through numerous workshops and a significant digital infrastructure including their website and podcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NiCHE Website|url=http://niche-canada.org|accessdate=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Communication between European nations is restricted by language difficulties. In April 1999 a meeting was held in Germany to overcome these problems and to co-ordinate environmental history in Europe. This meeting resulted in the creation of the [[European Society for Environmental History]] in 1999. Only two years after its establishment, ESEH held its first international conference in St. Andrews, Scotland. Around 120 scholars attended the meeting and 105 papers were presented on topics covering the whole spectrum of environmental history. The conference showed that environmental history is a viable and lively field in Europe and since then ESEH has expanded to over 400 members and continues to grow and attracted international conferences in 2003 and 2005. In 1999 the ''Centre for Environmental History'' was established at the University of Stirling. Some history departments at European universities are now offering introductory courses in environmental history and postgraduate courses in Environmental history have been established at the Universities of Nottingham, Stirling and Dundee and more recently a Graduierten Kolleg was created at the [[University of Göttingen]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eh-resources.org/environmental_history.html What is Environmental History? K. Jan Oosthoek]. Retrieved 2010-8-8.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the [[Rachel Carson Center for Environment and Society]] (RCC), an international, interdisciplinary center for research and education in the environmental humanities and social sciences, was founded as a joint initiative of Munich's [[Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität]] and the [[Deutsches Museum]], with the generous support of the [[German Federal Ministry of Education and Research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RCC Website|url=http://www.carsoncenter.uni-muenchen.de/index.html|accessdate=Feb 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Environment &amp; Society Portal (environmentandsociety.org) is the Rachel Carson Center's open access digital archive and publication platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Environment &amp; Society Portal Website|url=http://www.environmentandsociety.org/|accessdate=Feb 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental history prides itself in bridging the gap between the arts and natural sciences although to date the scales weigh on the side of science. A definitive list of related subjects would be lengthy indeed and singling out those for special mention a difficult task. However, those frequently quoted include, [[historical geography]], the [[history and philosophy of science]], [[history of technology]] and [[climate science]]. On the biological side there is, above all, [[ecology]] and [[historical ecology]], but also [[forestry]] and especially [[Forestry#History|forest history]], [[archaeology]] and [[anthropology]]. When the subject engages in environmental advocacy it has much in common with [[environmentalism]].

With increasing globalization and the impact of global trade on resource distribution, concern over never-ending economic growth and the many human inequities environmental history is now gaining allies in the fields of  [[ecological economics|ecological]] and [[environmental economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bess|2005|pp=30–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Martinez-Alier|Schandle|2002|pp=175–176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engagement with sociological thinkers and the humanities is limited but cannot be ignored through the beliefs and ideas that guide human action. This has been seen as the reason for a perceived lack of support from traditional historians.&lt;ref name="Warde 2007"/&gt;

==Issues==
The subject has a number of areas of lively debate. These include discussion concerning: what subject matter is most appropriate; whether environmental advocacy can detract from scholarly objectivity; standards of professionalism in a subject where much outstanding work has been done by non-historians; the relative contribution of nature and humans in determining the passage of history; the degree of connection with, and acceptance by, other disciplines - but especially mainstream history. For Paul Warde the sheer scale, scope and diffuseness of the environmental history endeavour calls for an analytical toolkit "a range of common issues and questions to push forward collectively" and a "core problem". He sees a lack of "human agency" in its texts and suggest it be written more to act: as a source of information for environmental scientists; incorporation of the notion of risk; a closer analysis of what it is we mean by "environment"; confronting the way environmental history is at odds with the humanities because it emphasises the division between "materialist, and cultural or constructivist explanations for human behaviour".&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb|Warde|Sorlin|2007|pp=107–130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global sustainability===
[[File:BlueMarble-2001-2002.jpg|thumb|alt=Two views of the Earth from space.|Achieving sustainability will enable the Earth to continue supporting human life as we know it. [[The Blue Marble|Blue Marble]] NASA composite images: 2001 (left), 2002 (right)]]
{{Main|Sustainability}}
Many of the themes of environmental history inevitably examine the circumstances that produced the environmental problems of the present day, a litany of themes that challenge global sustainability including: [[population]], [[consumerism]] and [[materialism]], [[climate change]], [[waste disposal]], [[deforestation]] and loss of wilderness, [[industrial agriculture]], [[species extinction]], depletion of natural resources, [[introduced species|invasive organisms]] and [[urban development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2006|pp=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The simple message of sustainable use of renewable resources is frequently repeated and early as 1864 [[George Perkins Marsh]] was pointing out that the changes we make in the environment may later reduce the environments usefulness to humans so any changes should be made with great care&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb|Marsh|1864|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; - what we would nowadays call [[enlightened self-interest]]. Richard Grove has pointed out that "''States will act to prevent environmental degradation only when their economic interests are threatened''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Grove|1992|pp=42–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advocacy===
{{Main |Advocacy}}
It is not clear whether environmental history should promote a moral or political agenda. The strong emotions raised by environmentalism, conservation and sustainability can interfere with historical objectivity: polemical tracts and strong advocacy can compromise objectivity and professionalism. Engagement with the political process certainly has its academic perils&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Opie|1983|pp=8–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; although accuracy and commitment to the historical method is not necessarily threatened by environmental involvement: environmental historians have a reasonable expectation that their work will inform policy-makers.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb|Worster|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent historiographical shift has placed an increased emphasis on inequality as an element of environmental history. Imbalances of power in resources, industry, and politics have resulted in the burden of industrial pollution being shifted to less powerful populations in both the geographic and social spheres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hurley |first1=Andrew |title=Environmental Inequalities:Class, Race, and Industrial Pollution in Gary, Indiana, 1945-1980 |date=1995 |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |location=Chapel Hill, NC |isbn=0807845183}}&lt;/ref&gt; An critical examination of the traditional environmentalist movement from this historical perspective notes the ways in which early advocates of environmentalism sought the aesthetic preservation of middle-class spaces and sheltered their own communities from the worst effects of air and water pollution, while neglecting the plight of the less privileged. 

Communities with less economic and sociopolitical power often lack the resources to get involved in environmental advocacy. Environmental history increasingly highlights the ways in which the middle-class environmental movement has fallen short and left behind entire communities. Interdisciplinary research now understands historic inequality as a lens through which to predict future social developments in the environmental sphere, particularly with regard to [[climate change]]. The [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]] cautions that a warming planet will exacerbate environmental and other inequalities, particularly with regard to: "(a) increase in the exposure of the disadvantaged groups to the adverse effects of climate change; (b) increase in their susceptibility to damage caused by climate change; and (c) decrease in their ability to cope and recover from the damage suffered."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Islam |first1=S. Nazrul |title=Climate Change and Social Inequality |url=http://www.un.org/esa/desa/papers/2017/wp152_2017.pdf |website=UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an interdisciplinary field that encompasses a new understanding of social justice dynamics in a rapidly changing global climate, environmental history is inherently advocative.

===Declensionist narratives===
Narratives of environmental history tend to be declensionist, that is, accounts of progressive decline under human activity.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===Presentism and culpability===
{{Main| Presentism (literary and historical analysis)}}
Under the accusation of "presentism" it is sometimes claimed that, with its genesis in the late 20th century environmentalism and conservation issues, environmental history is simply a reaction to contemporary problems, an "attempt to read late twentieth century developments and concerns back into past historical periods in which they were not operative, and certainly not conscious to human participants during those times".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2006|pp=98–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is strongly related to the idea of culpability. In environmental debate blame can always be apportioned, but it is more constructive for the future to understand the values and imperatives of the period under discussion so that causes are determined and the context explained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dovers|1994|pp=14–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental determinism===
{{further|Environmental determinism|Cultural determinism}}
[[File:Maler der Grabkammer des Sennudem 001.jpg|thumb|left|Ploughing farmer in ancient Egypt. [[Mural]] in the burial chamber of [[artisan]] [[Sennedjem]] c. 1200 BCE]]
For some environmental historians "the general conditions of the environment, the scale and arrangement of land and sea, the availability of resources, and the presence or absence of animals available for domestication, and associated organisms and disease vectors, that makes the development of human cultures possible and even predispose the direction of their development"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2006|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that "history is inevitably guided by forces that are not of human origin or subject to human choice".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2006|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach has been attributed to American environmental historians Webb and Turner&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|White|2001|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, more recently to [[Jared Diamond]] in his book ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]'', where the presence or absence of disease vectors and resources such as plants and animals that are amenable to domestication that may not only stimulate the development of human culture but even determine, to some extent, the direction of that development. The claim that the path of history has been forged by environmental rather than cultural forces is referred to as [[environmental determinism]] while, at the other extreme, is what may be called [[cultural determinism]]. An example of cultural determinism would be the view that human influence is so pervasive that the idea of pristine nature has little validity - that there is no way of relating to nature without culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|See Cronon|1995|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
{{Main|Historical method}}
[[File:HistoricalMarkerUSGeorgiaPioneerTurpentiningExperiment.jpg|thumb|Recording historical events]]
Useful guidance on the process of doing environmental history has been given by Donald Worster,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Worster|1988|pp=289–387}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carolyn Merchant,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|See Merchant|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Cronon&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cronon|1993|pp=1347–1376}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ian Simmons (geographer)|Ian Simmons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|See Simmons|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Worster's three core subject areas (the environment itself, human impacts on the environment, and human thought about the environment) are generally taken as a starting point for the student as they encompass many of the different skills required. The tools are those of both history and science with a requirement for fluency in the language of natural science and especially ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2008|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact methodologies and insights from a range of physical and social sciences is required, there seeming to be universal agreement that environmental history is indeed a multidisciplinary subject.

==Future==
[[File:Eolienne et centrale thermique Nuon Sloterdijk.jpg|thumb|Old and new human uses of the atmosphere]]

Environmental history, like all historical studies, shares the hope that through an examination of past events it may be possible to forge a more considered future. In particular a greater depth of historical knowledge can inform environmental controversies and guide policy decisions.

The subject continues to provide new perspectives, offering cooperation between scholars with different disciplinary backgrounds and providing an improved historical context to resource and environmental problems. There seems little doubt that, with increasing concern for our environmental future, environmental history will continue along the path of environmental advocacy from which it originated as “''human impact on the living systems of the planet bring us no closer to utopia, but instead to a crisis of survival''”&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2006|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; with key themes being population growth, climate change, conflict over environmental policy at different levels of human organization, extinction, biological invasions, the environmental consequences of technology especially biotechnology, the reduced supply of resources - most notably energy, materials and water. Hughes comments that environmental historians “''will find themselves increasingly challenged by the need to explain the background of the world market economy and its effects on the global environment. Supranational instrumentalities threaten to overpower conservation in a drive for what is called sustainable development, but which in fact envisions no limits to economic growth''”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2006|pp=92–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes also notes that "''environmental history is notably absent from nations that most adamantly reject US, or Western influences''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2006|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Bess sees the world increasingly permeated by potent technologies in a process he calls “artificialization” which has been accelerating since the 1700s, but at a greatly accelerated rate after 1945. Over the next fifty years, this transformative process stands a good chance of turning our physical world, and our society, upside-down. Environmental historians can “''play a vital role in helping humankind to understand the gale-force of artifice that we have unleashed on our planet and on ourselves''”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bess|2005b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Against this background “''environmental history can give an essential perspective, offering knowledge of the historical process that led to the present situation, give examples of past problems and solutions, and an analysis of the historical forces that must be dealt with''”&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hughes|2006|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, as expressed by William Cronon, "''The viability and success of new human modes of existing within the constraints of the environment and its resources requires both an understanding of the past and an articulation of a new ethic for the future''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/5474508 |title=See Cronon quote here |publisher=Searchworks.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FullMoon2010.jpg|thumb|right|The full Moon as viewed through a {{convert|9.25|in|mm|order=flip|abbr=on}} [[Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope]]. The Moon was near its northernmost [[ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic latitude]], so the southern [[lunar craters|craters]] are especially prominent.]]
[[File:Lunar eclipse January 31 2018 California Alfredo Garcia Jr mideclipse.jpg|thumb|The full Moon during the total [[January 2018 lunar eclipse|lunar eclipse of 31 January 2018]]]]

The '''full moon''' is the [[lunar phase]] when the [[Moon]] appears fully illuminated from [[Earth]]'s perspective. This occurs when Earth is located between the [[Sun]] and the Moon (more exactly, when the [[ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic longitudes]] of the Sun and Moon [[opposition (planets)|differ by 180°]]). This means that the lunar hemisphere facing Earth – the [[near side of the Moon|near side]] – is completely sunlit and appears as a circular disk, while the [[far side of the Moon|far side]] is dark. The full moon occurs once roughly every [[month]].

When the Moon moves into [[Earth's shadow]], a [[lunar eclipse]] occurs, during which all or part of the Moon's face may appear reddish due to the [[Rayleigh scattering]] of blue wavelengths and the [[atmospheric refraction|refraction]] of [[sunlight]] through [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=P. Kenneth |last=Seidelmann |date=2005 |title=Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac |isbn=0-935702-68-7 |chapter=Phases of the Moon |publisher=University Science Books |page=478 |quote=They are the times when the excess of the Moon's apparent geocentric ecliptic longitude λ&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; over the Sun's apparent geocentric ecliptic longitude is 0, 90, 180, or 270 ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Celestial Alignment without Lunar Eclipse; from google (full moon earth block sunlight) result 2 |url=http://people.bu.edu/sscruggs/earthandmoon3.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=tilted from the ecliptic by about 5 degrees; from google (full moon earth block sunlight) result 3 |url=http://www2.astro.psu.edu/users/rbc/a1/lec3n.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lunar eclipses happen only during full moon and around points on [[orbit of the Moon|its orbit]] where the [[natural satellite|satellite]] may pass through the planet's shadow. A lunar eclipse does not occur every month because the Moon's orbit is [[orbital inclination|inclined]] 5.14° with respect to the [[ecliptic]] plane of Earth; thus, the Moon usually passes north or south of Earth's shadow, which is mostly restricted to this [[plane of reference]]. Lunar eclipses happen only when the full moon occurs around either [[orbital node|node of its orbit]] (ascending or descending). Therefore, a lunar eclipse occurs approximately every 6 months and often 2 weeks before or after a [[solar eclipse]], which occurs during [[new moon]] around the opposite node.

The interval period between a new or full moon and the next same phase, a [[Lunar month#Synodic month|synodic month]], averages about 29.53 days. Therefore, in those [[lunar calendar]]s in which each month begins on the day of the new moon, the full moon falls on either the 14th or 15th day of the [[lunar month]]. Because a calendar month consists of a [[Natural number|whole number]] of days, a lunar month may be either 29 or 30 days long.

==Characteristics==
A full moon is often thought of as an event of a full night's duration. This is somewhat misleading because [[lunar phase|its phase]] seen from Earth continuously waxes or wanes (though much too slowly to notice in real time with the [[naked eye]]). Its maximum illumination occurs at the moment waxing has stopped. For any given location, about half of these maximum full moons may be visible, while the other half occurs during the day, when the full moon is below the horizon.

Many [[almanac]]s list full moons not only by date, but also by their exact time, usually in [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC). Typical monthly [[calendar]]s that include lunar phases may be offset by one day when used in a different [[time zone]].

Full moon is generally a suboptimal time to conduct [[astronomy|astronomical]] observations because the bright [[moonlight|sunlight reflected]] by the Moon then [[skyglow|outshines]] the [[apparent magnitude|apparently dimmer]] stars.

On 12 December 2008, the full moon occurred [[apogee|closer]] to the Earth than it had been at any time for the previous 15 years, called a [[supermoon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2008/09dec_fullmoon.htm|title=Biggest Full Moon of the Year|last=Phillips|first=Tony|work= Science@NASA|date=9 December 2008|accessdate=4 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 March 2011, another full supermoon occurred, closer to the Earth than at any time for the previous 18 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2011/16mar_supermoon/|title=Super Full Moon|last=Phillips|first=Tony|work=Science@NASA|date=16 March 2011|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 November 2016, a full supermoon occurred closer to the Earth than at any time for the previous 68 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/news-articles/2016-ends-with-3-supermoons|title=Super Full Moon|last=Phillips|first=Tony|work=Science@NASA|date=14 October 2016|accessdate=13 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Formula ===
The date and approximate time of a specific full moon (assuming a circular orbit) can be calculated from the following equation:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first = Jean | last = Meeus | date= 1998 | title = Astronomical Algorithms | edition = 2nd |isbn = 0-943396-61-1| chapter = Phases of the Moon | pages = 349–354 | publisher = Willmann-Bell | location = Richmond, Virginia}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; d = 20.362000+ 29.530588861 \times N + 102.026 \times 10^{-12} \times N^2&lt;/math&gt;
where ''d'' is the number of days since 1 January 2000 00:00:00 in the [[Terrestrial Time]] scale used in astronomical [[Ephemeris|ephemerides]]; for [[Universal Time]] (UT) add the following approximate correction to ''d'':
: &lt;math&gt;-0.000739 - (235 \times 10^{-12})\times N^2&lt;/math&gt; days
where ''N'' is the number of full moons since the first full moon of 2000. The true time of a full moon may differ from this approximation by up to about 14.5 hours as a result of the non-circularity of the moon's orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Meeus | first = Jean | chapter = The Duration of the Lunation |title= More Mathematical Astronomy Morsels | publisher = Willmann-Bell |location=Richmond, Virginia| date = 2002 | pages = 19–31 | isbn = 0-943396-74-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[New moon]] for an explanation of the formula and its parameters.

The age and apparent size of the full moon vary in a cycle of just under 14 [[synodic month]]s, which has been referred to as a [[full moon cycle]].

==In folklore and tradition==
{{See also|List of lunar deities|Lunar effect}}
[[File:Moon and red blue haze.jpg|thumb|Full moon rising, seen through the [[Belt of Venus]]]]
Full moons are traditionally associated with temporal [[insomnia]] (inability to sleep), [[insanity]] (hence the terms ''lunacy'' and ''lunatic'') and various "magical phenomena" such as [[lycanthropy]]. Psychologists, however, have found that there is no strong evidence for effects on human behavior around the time of a full moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Full Moon Effect On Behavior Minimal, Studies Say|date=6 February 2004|work=National Geographic News|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/12/1218_021218_moon.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; They find that studies are generally not consistent, with some showing a positive effect and others showing a negative effect. In one instance, the 23 December 2000 issue of the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' published two studies on dog bite admission to hospitals in England and Australia. The study of the [[Bradford Royal Infirmary]] found that dog bites were twice as common during a full moon, whereas the study conducted by the public hospitals in Australia found that they were less likely.   All this is relevant to canine rather than human behavior.

===Full moon names===
Historically, [[month]] names are names of moons (lunations, not necessarily full moons) in [[lunisolar calendars]]. Since the introduction of the solar [[Julian calendar]] in the Roman Empire, and later the [[Gregorian calendar]] worldwide, people no longer perceive month names as "moon" names. The traditional [[Germanic calendar#Month names|Old English month names]] were equated with the names of the Julian calendar from an early time (soon after [[Christianization of the Anglo-Saxons|Christianization]], according to the testimony of [[Bede]] ca. AD 700).

Some full moons have developed new names in modern times, e.g., the [[blue moon]], and the names "harvest moon" and "hunter's moon" for the full moons of autumn.

====Harvest and hunter's moons====
{{anchor|Harvest moon}}{{anchor|Hunter's moon}}
{{Redirect-multi|2|Harvest moon|Hunter's moon}}
[[File:harvest moon.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A harvest moon. Its orange color is due to its closeness to the horizon, rather than being unique to harvest moons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.research.utoronto.ca/harvest-moon/ |title=Why is the harvest moon so big and orange? |date=27 September 2010 |publisher=University of Toronto |last=Percy |first=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The "harvest moon" and "hunter's moon" are traditional terms for the full moons occurring during late summer and in the [[autumn]], in the northern hemisphere usually in September and October respectively.
The "harvest moon" is the full moon closest to the [[September equinox|autumnal equinox]] (22 or 23 September), coming anywhere from two weeks before to two weeks after that date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.almanac.com/content/what-harvest-moon|title=What is a Harvest Moon?|publisher=[[Old Farmer's Almanac]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "hunter's moon" is the full moon following it. The names are recorded from the early 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;See James Ferguson, ''Astronomy explained upon Sir Isaac Newton's principles,: and made easy to those who have not studied mathematics'', 1756, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ji1cAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA128#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 128]. "harvest moon" is also the cognate of ''herbist-mānod'', the [[Old High German]] name of November
recorded in ''[[Vita Karoli Magni]]'', ch. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' entry for "harvest moon" cites a 1706 reference, and for "hunter's moon" a 1710 edition of ''The British Apollo'', where the term is attributed to "the country people" (''The Country People call this the Hunters-Moon.''). The names became traditional in [[American folklore]], where they are now often popularly attributed to [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|the Native Americans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nightskyinfo.com/sky_highlights/hunters_moon/|title=The Hunter's Moon |last=Neata |first=Emil |work=Night Sky Info |access-date=29 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Feast of the Hunters' Moon]] is a yearly festival in [[West Lafayette, Indiana]], held in late September or early October each year since 1968.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | url = http://www.tcha.mus.in.us/feast.htm | title = Feast of the Hunters' Moon | publisher = Tippecanoe County Historical Association | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090620084610/http://www.tcha.mus.in.us/feast.htm | archivedate = 2009-06-20 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the Harvest moon occurred on the night of equinox itself (some 5{{fraction|1|2}} hours after the point of equinox) for the first time since 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Tony |last=Phillips |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2010/22sep_harvestmoon/ |title=Watch out for the Super Harvest Moon |work=NASA Science|date=22 September 2010|accessdate=13 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jack|last=Maddox|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2010-09-22/living/harvest.moon_1_autumn-full-moon-optical-illusion?_s=PM:LIVING|title=Super Harvest Moon: Autumn phenomenon is a rare treat|work=[[CNN]]|date=22 September 2010|accessdate=13 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All full moons rise around the time of sunset. Because the moon moves eastward among the stars faster than the sun its meridian passage is delayed, causing it to rise later each day – on average by about 50.47 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;(1440/(29.531)=50.47 minutes)&lt;/ref&gt; The harvest moon and hunter's moon are unique because the time difference between moonrises on successive evenings is much shorter than average. The moon rises approximately 30 minutes later from one night to the next, as seen from about 40 degrees N or S latitude. (This is because a full moon in September appears to move not straight east but north-east in the sky.) Thus, there is no long period of darkness between sunset and moonrise for several days after the full moon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Larry McNish|title=RASC Calgary Centre - Sunset and Moonrise |url=http://calgary.rasc.ca/sunset_moonrise.htm|date=2007}} This gives a graph showing the effect as seen from Calgary, for the whole of the year 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; thus lengthening the time in the evening when there is enough light for men to see to work to get the harvest in.

====Farmers' Almanacs====
The ''[[Maine Farmers' Almanac]]'' from c. the 1930s began to publish Native American "Indian" full moon names. The ''[[Farmers' Almanac]]'' (since 1955 published in Maine, but not the same publication as the ''Maine Farmers' Almanac'') continues to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

An early list of "Indian month names" was published in 1918 by [[Daniel Carter Beard]] in his ''The American Boy's Book of Signs, Signals and Symbols'' for use by the [[Boy Scouts of America|boy scouts]]. Beard's "Indian" month names were:&lt;ref&gt;Beard 1918, pp. 78&amp;ndash;80. "The Indians' Moons naturally vary in the different parts of the country, but by comparing them all and striking an average as near as may be, the moons are reduced to the following"&lt;/ref&gt;
*January: Difficulty, Black Smoke
*February: Raccoon, Bare Spots on the Ground
*March: Wind, Little Grass, Sore-Eye
*April: Ducks, Goose-Eggs
*May: Green Grass, Root-Food
*June: Corn-Planting, Strawberry
*July: Buffalo (Bull), Hot Sun
*August: Harvest, Cow Buffalo
*September: Wild Rice, Red Plum
*October: Leaf-Falling, Nuts
*November: Deer-Mating, Fur-Pelts
*December: Wolves, Big Moon

Such names have gained currency in [[American folklore]]. They appear in print more widely outside of the almanac tradition from the 1990s in popular publications about the Moon.
''Mysteries of the Moon'' by Patricia Haddock ("Great Mysteries Series", Greenhaven Press, 1992) gave an extensive list of such names along with the individual tribal groups they were supposedly associated with.&lt;ref&gt;repeated in ''The Moon Book'' by Kim Long (1998:[https://books.google.com/books?id=e6-ddrk3nxsC&amp;pg=PA102#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 102ff.]) Also in ''Llewellyn's 1996 Moon Sign Book'' (1995).
&lt;/ref&gt; Haddock supposes that certain "Colonial American" moon names were adopted from [[Algonquian languages]] (which were formerly spoken in the territory of New England), while others are based in European tradition (e.g., the Colonial American names for the May moon, "Milk Moon", "Mother's Moon", "Hare Moon" have no parallels in the supposed native names, while the name of November, "Beaver Moon" is supposedly based in the Algonquin).

The individual names given in ''Farmers' Almanac'' include:{{clarify|date=May 2013}}&lt;!--treating farmersalmanac.com as the primary source for this. But research is needed, the farmersalmanac.com page is undated, and they seem to be fiddling with it all the time, making up new names as they go along. What should be done here is, each name should be attributed to the earliest known publication in print in such an Almanac.--&gt;
*January: "Wolf Moon" (this is the name of December in Beard 1918)&lt;ref&gt;"Wolf Moon" is attributed to the Algonquin by Haddock (1992); the actual Algonquin name for that moon is ''squochee kesos'' or "sun has not strength to thaw".

==Lunar and lunisolar calendars==
[[File:Christmas full moons 1977-2091.gif|thumb|The December 2015 ''full moon'' coincided with [[Christmas day]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/rare-full-moon-on-christmas-day Rare Full Moon on Christmas Day, NASA]&lt;/ref&gt; This last occurred in 1977, with a Christmas Eve full moon between in 1996 and a full moon the day after Christmas in 2004 and before Christmas Eve in 2007 (both not shown here). A small horizontal [[libration]] is visible comparing their appearances. By the 19-year [[metonic cycle]] the full moon will repeat on Christmas day in 2034, 2053, 2072, and 2091.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/weather/ct-wea-1221-asktom-20151220-column.html Ask Tom: How unusual is a full moon on Christmas Day?]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{Main|Lunar calendar}}
Most pre-modern calendars the world over were [[lunisolar]], combining the solar year with the lunation by means of [[intercalary month]]s.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g., {{Cite book| first = Bonnie | last = Blackburn |display-authors=etal| date= 1999 | title = The Oxford Companion to the Year | isbn = 0-19-214231-3| publisher = Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first = Edward M. | last = Reingold |display-authors=etal | date= 2001 | title = Calendrical Calculations: The Millennium Edition | isbn = 0-521-77752-6 | publisher = Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Julian calendar abandoned this method in favour of a purely solar reckoning while conversely the 7th-century [[Islamic calendar]] opted for a purely lunar one.

A continuing lunisolar calendar is in the [[Hebrew calendar]]. Evidence of this is noted in the dates of [[Passover]] and [[Easter]] in Judaism and Christianity, respectively. Passover falls on the full moon on 15 Nisan of the Hebrew calendar. The date of the Jewish [[Rosh Hashana]] and [[Sukkot]] festivals along with all other [[Jewish holidays]] are dependent on the dates of the new moons.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leviticus]] 23:4-7, 33-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intercalary months===
{{main|Intercalary month}}
In lunisolar calendars, an intercalary month occurs seven times in the 19 years of the [[Metonic cycle]], or on average every 2.7 years (19/7). In the [[Hebrew Calendar]] this is noted with a periodic extra month of [[Adar]] in the early spring.

==== Blue moon====
{{further|Blue moon}}
In the modern system of "traditional" full moon names tied to the [[solstice]] and [[equinox]] points, a supernumerary full moon in such a period is called a blue moon. The term "blue moon" used in this sense may date to as early as the 16th century, but it became well known in the United States due to the ''Farmers' Almanac'' (published since 1818).&lt;ref&gt;
The saying "once in a blue moon" meaning "very rarely" is recorded since the 1820s.
The term "blue moon" is recorded in 1528, in the couplet ''O churche men are wyly foxes [...] Yf they say the mone is blewe / We must beleve that it is true / Admittynge their interpretacion.'' ([[Thomas Wolsey]], ''Rede me and be nott wrothe, for I say no thynge but trothe'' ed. 1871 [https://archive.org/stream/redemeandbenottw00roywuoft#page/n121/mode/2up p. 114]); it isn't clear however if this refers to intercalation.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''Farmers' Almanac'', a "blue moon" is the third full moon in any period between either solstice and equinox, or between equinox and solstice, (calculated using the [[mean tropical year]]), which contains four full moons.&lt;ref&gt;Farmers' Almanac, "What is a blue moon?", 24 August 2009, available at [http://farmersalmanac.com/astronomy/2009/08/24/what-is-a-blue-moon].&lt;/ref&gt; These seasons are equal in length, unlike the astronomical ones, which vary in length depending on the Earth's speed in its elliptical orbit round the sun.   To compare, in 1983 the equal length seasons began at 1.48 AM on 23 March, 9.15 AM on 22 June, 4.42 PM on 21 September and 12.10 AM on 22 December, while the astronomical seasons began at 4.39 AM on 21 March, 11.09 PM on 21 June, 2.42 PM on 23 September and 10.30 AM on 22 December (all times GMT).   Due to a misinterpretation of this definition in the March 1946 ''[[Sky &amp; Telescope]]'' magazine, "blue moon" has also been used in the sense of "the second full moon in any month which contains two full moons (this usage has been noted as "erroneous" by ''Sky &amp; Telescope'' in 1999).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/objects/moon/3304131.html ''Sky and Telescope'' "What's a blue moon?"]&lt;/ref&gt;
According to either definition, "blue moons" occur with the average frequency of intercalary months, seven times in 19 years, the ''Farmers' Almanac'' system of "full moon names" effectively defining a lunisolar calendar.

'''Gender inequality''' is the idea and situation that [[men]] and [[women]] are not equal. Gender inequality refers to unequal treatment or perceptions of individuals wholly or partly due to their [[gender]]. It arises from differences in [[gender role]]s.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; [[Gender systems]] are often [[Dichotomy|dichotomous]] and hierarchical. Gender inequality stems from distinctions, whether empirically grounded or socially constructed. Women lag behind men in many domains, including education, labor market opportunities and political representation and in pay.

==Natural gender differences==
{{main|Gender differences in humans}}
Natural differences exist between the sexes base on biological and anatomic factors, most notably differing reproductive roles. Biological differences include [[chromosome]]s and [[hormone|hormonal]] differences.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Wood, Julia. Gendered Lives. 6th. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth/Thomson Learning, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a natural difference also in the relative physical strengths (on average) of the sexes, both in the lower body and more pronouncedly in the upper-body, though this does not mean that any given man is stronger than any given woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Maughan RJ, Watson JS, Weir J |year=1983 |title=Strength and cross-sectional area of human skeletal muscle |url=http://jp.physoc.org/content/338/1/37.abstract |journal=The Journal of Physiology |volume=338 |issue=1 |pages=37–49 |pmid=6875963 |pmc=1197179 |doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1983.sp014658}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Frontera, Hughes, Lutz, Evans |year=1991 |title=A cross-sectional study of muscle strength and mass in 45- to 78-yr-old men and women |url=http://jap.physiology.org/cgi/content/abstract/71/2/644 |journal =J Appl Physiol |volume=71 |issue=2|pages=644–50 |pmid=1938738|doi=10.1152/jappl.1991.71.2.644 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Men, on average, are taller, which provides both advantages and disadvantages.&lt;ref name="Samaras 2007 33–61"&gt;{{Cite book|title= Human body size and the laws of scaling |last= Samaras|first= Thomas|year=2007 |publisher=Nova Science|location=New York|isbn= 978-1-60021-408-0|pages= 33–61|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=PCU0RwDI6c4C}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Women live significantly longer than men,&lt;ref name=CIA&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2102.html|title=Life expectancy at birth, Country Comparison to the World|publisher=US [[Central Intelligence Agency]]|date=n.d.|website=CIA World Factbook|accessdate=12 Jan 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it is not clear to what extent this is a biological difference - see [[Life expectancy#gender differences|Life expectancy]].

Girls are more commonly introduced to the colour pink, dolls, dresses, and playing house where they are taking care of the dolls as if they were children. The norm of blue is for boys and pink is for girls is cultural and has not always historically been around. These paths set by parents or other adult figures in the child's life set them on certain paths.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cordier|first=B|year=2012|title=Gender, betwixt biology and society|url=|journal=European Journal of Sexology and Sexual Health|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to a difference in personality, career paths, or relationships.

=== Income disparities linked to job stratification ===
{{Main|Gender pay gap}} 
The gender pay gap is the average difference between men's and women's aggregate [[wage]]s or [[salary|salaries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2011-08-01|title=Using education to reduce the wage gap between men and women|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053535711000370|journal=The Journal of Socio-Economics|language=en|volume=40|issue=4|pages=412–416|doi=10.1016/j.socec.2011.04.006|issn=1053-5357|last1=Miki|first1=Malul|last2=Yuval|first2=Fany}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gap is due to a variety of factors, including differences in education choices, differences in preferred job and industry, differences in the types of positions held by men and women, differences in the type of jobs men typically go into as opposed to women (especially highly paid high risk jobs), differences in amount of work experiences, difference in length of the work week, and breaks in employment. These factors resolve 60% to 75% of the pay gap, depending on the source. Various explanations for the remaining 25% to 40% have been suggested, including women's lower willingness and ability to negotiate salary and [[sexual discrimination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=An Analysis of Reasons for the Disparity in Wages Between Men and Women |url=http://www.consad.com/content/reports/Gender%20Wage%20Gap%20Final%20Report.pdf |format=PDF |author=CONSAD Research Corporation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008051216/http://www.consad.com/content/reports/Gender%20Wage%20Gap%20Final%20Report.pdf |archivedate=October 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Patten, Eileen|website=Pew Research Center|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/04/14/on-equal-pay-day-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-gender-pay-gap/|title=On Equal Pay Day, key facts about the gender pay gap|date=April 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Blau&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Francine D.

In the United States, the ''average'' female's ''unadjusted'' annual salary has been cited as 78% of that of the ''average'' male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://money.cnn.com/2015/04/13/news/economy/equal-pay-day-2015/ | title=78 cents on the dollar: The facts about the gender wage gap |work=CNN Money |date=April 14, 2015 | accessdate=May 28, 2015 | author=O'Brien, Sara Ashley | location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, multiple studies from [[OECD]],  [[AAUW]], and the [[United States Department of Labor|US Department of Labor]] have found that pay rates between males and females varied by 5–6.6% or, females earning 94 cents to every dollar earned by their male counterparts, when wages were adjusted to different individual choices made by male and female workers in college major, occupation, working hours, and maternal/parental leave.&lt;ref name="Jackson, Brooks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.factcheck.org/2012/06/obamas-77-cent-exaggeration/|website=FactCheck.org|title=Obama's 77-Cent Exaggeration|author=Jackson, Brooks|date=June 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining 6% of the gap has been speculated to originate from deficiency in salary negotiating skills and sexual discrimination.&lt;ref name="Jackson, Brooks"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Analysis of Reasons for the Disparity in Wages Between Men and Women|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/religion/courses/Gender_Wage_Gap_Report.pdf|publisher=US Department of Labor; CONSAD Research Corp|accessdate=February 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.aauw.org/files/2013/02/graduating-to-a-pay-gap-the-earnings-of-women-and-men-one-year-after-college-graduation.pdf|format=PDF|title=Graduating to a Pay Gap – The Earnings of Women and Men One Year after College Graduation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wage Gap Myth Exposed — By Feminists|author=Sommers, Christina H|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/christina-hoff-sommers/wage-gap_b_2073804.html|website=Huffington Post|date=January 23, 2014|accessdate=December 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Human capital]] theories refer to the education, knowledge, training, experience, or skill of a person which makes them potentially valuable to an employer. This has historically been understood as a cause of the gendered wage gap but is no longer a predominant cause as women and men in certain occupations tend to have similar education levels or other credentials. Even when such characteristics of jobs and workers are controlled for, the presence of women within a certain occupation leads to lower wages. This earnings discrimination is considered to be a part of pollution theory. This theory suggests that jobs which are predominated by women offer lower wages than do jobs simply because of the presence of women within the occupation. As women enter an occupation, this reduces the amount of prestige associated with the job and men subsequently leave these occupations. The entering of women into specific occupations suggests that less competent workers have begun to be hired or that the occupation is becoming [[deskilling|deskilled]]. Men are reluctant to enter female-dominated occupations because of this and similarly resist the entrance of women into male-dominated occupations.&lt;ref name="Stratification"&gt;Massey, Douglas. "Categorically Unequal: The American Stratification System." NY: Russell Sage Foundation, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Page needed|date=October 2012}}

The gendered income disparity can also be attributed in part to [[occupational segregation]], where groups of people are distributed across occupations according to ascribed characteristics; in this case, gender.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Occupational gender segregation can be understood {{who|date=October 2012}} to contain two components or dimensions; horizontal segregation and vertical segregation. With horizontal segregation, occupational sex segregation occurs as men and women are thought to possess different physical, emotional, and mental capabilities. These different capabilities make the genders vary in the types of jobs they are suited for. This can be specifically viewed with the gendered division between manual and non-manual labor.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} With vertical segregation, occupational sex segregation occurs as occupations are stratified according to the power, authority, income, and prestige associated with the occupation and women are excluded from holding such jobs.&lt;ref name="Stratification"/&gt;

As women entered the workforce in larger numbers since the 1960s, occupations have become segregated based on the amount femininity or masculinity presupposed to be associated with each occupation.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Census data suggests that while some occupations have become more gender integrated (mail carriers, bartenders, bus drivers, and real estate agents), occupations including teachers, nurses, secretaries, and librarians have become female-dominated while occupations including architects, electrical engineers, and airplane pilots remain predominately male in composition.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Based on the census data, women occupy the [[Tertiary sector of economic activity|service sector]] jobs at higher rates than men. Women’s overrepresentation in service sector jobs, as opposed to jobs that require managerial work acts as a reinforcement of women and men into traditional [[gender role]]s that causes gender inequality.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, Charles, E. Social Inequality. 6th. Boston: Pearson Education, Inc., 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:US gender pay gap, by sex, race-ethnicity-2009.png|thumb|330px|Median weekly earnings of full-time wage and salary workers, by sex, race, and ethnicity, U.S., 2009.&lt;ref name="bls 2009"&gt;U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

“The gender wage gap is an indicator of women’s earnings compared with men’s. It is figured by dividing the average annual earnings for women by the average annual earnings for men.” (Higgins et al., 2014) 
Scholars disagree about how much of the male-female wage gap depends on factors such as experience, education, occupation, and other job-relevant characteristics. Sociologist Douglas Massey found that 41% remains unexplained,&lt;ref name="Stratification"/&gt; while CONSAD analysts found that these factors explain between 65.1 and 76.4 percent of the raw wage gap.&lt;ref name="CONSAD wage gap"&gt;{{cite web|author1=CONSAD research corp. |title=An Analysis of Reasons for the Disparity in Wages Between Men and Women |url=http://www.consad.com/content/reports/Gender%20Wage%20Gap%20Final%20Report.pdf |accessdate=30 October 2015 |date=12 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008051216/http://www.consad.com/content/reports/Gender%20Wage%20Gap%20Final%20Report.pdf |archivedate=October 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CONSAD also noted that other factors such as benefits and overtime explain "additional portions of the raw gender wage gap".

The [[glass ceiling]] effect is also considered a possible contributor to the gender wage gap or income disparity. This effect suggests that gender provides significant disadvantages towards the top of job hierarchies which become worse as a person’s career goes on. The term glass ceiling implies that invisible or artificial barriers exist which prevent women from advancing within their jobs or receiving promotions. These barriers exist in spite of the achievements or qualifications of the women and still exist when other characteristics that are job-relevant such as experience, education, and abilities are controlled for. The inequality effects of the glass ceiling are more prevalent within higher-powered or higher income occupations, with fewer women holding these types of occupations. The glass ceiling effect also indicates the limited chances of women for income raises and promotion or advancement to more prestigious positions or jobs. As women are prevented by these artificial barriers, from either receiving job promotions or income raises, the effects of the inequality of the glass ceiling increase over the course of a woman’s career.&lt;ref&gt;Cotter, David, Joan Hermsen, Seth Ovadia and Reeve Vanneman. "Social Forces: The Glass Ceiling Effect." Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Statistical discrimination (economics)|Statistical discrimination]] is also cited as a cause for income disparities and gendered [[inequality in the workplace]]. Statistical discrimination indicates the likelihood of employers to deny women access to certain occupational tracks because women are more likely than men to leave their job or the labor force when they become married or pregnant. Women are instead given positions that dead-end or jobs that have very little mobility.&lt;ref name="Burstein, Paul 1994"&gt;Burstein, Paul. "Equal Employment Opportunity: Labor Market Discrimination and Public Policy." Edison, NJ: Aldine Transaction, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Third World countries such as the Dominican Republic, female entrepreneurs are statistically more prone to failure in business. In the event of a business failure women often return to their domestic lifestyle despite the absence of income. On the other hand, men tend to search for other employment as the household is not a priority.&lt;ref&gt;Sherri Grasmuck and Rosario Espinal. "Market Success or Female Autonomy?" Sage Publications, Inc, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The gender earnings ratio suggests that there has been an increase in women’s earnings comparative to men. Men’s plateau in earnings began after the 1970s, allowing for the increase in women’s wages to close the ratio between incomes. Despite the smaller ratio between men and women’s wages, disparity still exists. Census&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov/ Census]&lt;/ref&gt; data suggests that women’s earnings are 71 percent of men's earnings in 1999.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Cotter, David, Joan Hermsen, and Reeve Vanneman. The American People Census 2000: Gender Inequality at Work. New York: Russell Sage Foundation, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The gendered wage gap varies in its width among different races. Whites comparatively have the greatest wage gap between the genders. With whites, women earn 78% of the wages that white men do. With African Americans, women earn 90% of the wages that African American men do.

There are some exceptions where women earn more than men: According to a survey on gender pay inequality by the [[International Trade Union Confederation]], female workers in the Gulf state of [[Bahrain]] earn 40 percent more than male workers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vedior.com/hr-portal/recruitment-news/women-earn-less-than-men-across-the-globe.html?c=3052 Women 'earn less than men across the globe'], Vedior, 4 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, a report by the International Labor Organization (ILO) reveals the wage gap between Cambodian women factory workers and other male counterparts. There was a $25 USD monthly pay difference conveying that women have a much lower power and being devalued not only at home but also in the workplace.&lt;ref name="opendemocracy.net"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/5050/theresa-de-langis/what's-woman-worth-wages-and-democracy-in-cambodia|title=What's a woman worth?: wages and democracy in Cambodia|date=2015-02-01|website=openDemocracy|access-date=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professional education and careers===
The gender gap also appeared to narrow considerably beginning in the mid-1960s. Where some 5% of first-year students in professional programs were female in 1965, by 1985 this number had jumped to 40% in law and medicine, and over 30% in dentistry and business school.&lt;ref&gt;Goldin, Claudia, and Lawrence F. Katz. "On The Pill: Changing the course of women's education." The Milken Institute Review, Second Quarter 2001: p3.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the highly effective [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pill]] was available, women planning professional careers, which required a long-term, expensive commitment, had to "pay the penalty of abstinence or cope with considerable uncertainty regarding pregnancy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goldin |first1=Claudia |last2=Katz |first2=Lawrence F. |year=2002 |title=The Power Of The Pill: Contraceptives And Women's Career And Marriage Decisions |url= |journal=Journal of Political Economy |volume=110 |issue=4 |page=731 |doi=10.1086/340778|citeseerx=10.1.1.473.6514 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This control over their reproductive decisions allowed women to more easily make long-term decisions about their education and professional opportunities. Women are highly underrepresented on boards of directors and in senior positions in the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catalyst.org/etc/Catalyst_Written_Testimony_To_JEC_With_Appendix.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719161242/http://www.catalyst.org/etc/Catalyst_Written_Testimony_To_JEC_With_Appendix.pdf|date=July 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, with reliable birth control, young men and women had more reason to delay marriage. This meant that the marriage market available to any women who "delay[ed] marriage to pursue a career... would not be as depleted. Thus the Pill ''could'' have influenced women's careers, college majors, professional degrees, and the age at marriage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goldin |first1=Claudia |year=2006 |title=The Quiet Revolution That Transformed Women's Employment, Education, And Family |url= |journal=American Economic Review |volume=96 |issue=2|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies on sexism in science and technology fields have produced conflicting results. Corinne et al. found that science faculty of both sexes rated a male applicant as significantly more competent and hireable than an identical female applicant. These participants also selected a higher starting salary and offered more career mentoring to the male applicant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Corinne |display-authors=etal |year=2012 |title=Science faculty's subtle gender biases favor male students |journal=PNAS |volume=109|issue= 41|pages=16474–16479|doi=10.1073/pnas.1211286109 |pmid=22988126 |pmc=3478626}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams and Ceci, however, found that science and technology faculty of both sexes "preferred female applicants 2:1 over identically qualified males with matching lifestyles" for tenure-track positions.&lt;ref name="Williams and Ceci STEM sexism"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=Wendy|last2=Stephen|first2=Ceci|title=National hiring experiments reveal 2:1 faculty preference for women on STEM tenure track|journal=PNAS|date=28 April 2015|volume=112|issue=17|pages=5360–5365|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/112/17/5360.abstract|accessdate=30 October 2015|pmid=25870272|doi=10.1073/pnas.1418878112|pmc=4418903}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies show parents are more likely to expect their sons, rather than their daughters, to work in a science, technology, engineering or mathematics field – even when their 15-year-old boys and girls perform at the same level in mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;What Lies Behind Gender Inequality in Education? 2015, s.n., S.l.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Customer preference studies===
A 2010 study conducted by [[David R.

=== Gender roles in parenting and marriage ===
Gender roles are heavily influenced by biology, with male-female play styles correlating with sex hormones,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hines|first1=Melissa|last2=Golombok|first2=Susan|last3=Rust|first3=John|last4=Johnston|first4=Katie J.|last5=Golding|first5=Jean|last6=Team|first6=The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children Study|title=Testosterone during Pregnancy and Gender Role Behavior of Preschool Children: A Longitudinal, Population Study|journal=Child Development|date=1 January 2002|volume=73|issue=6|pages=1678–1687|jstor=3696409|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00498}}&lt;/ref&gt; sexual orientation, aggressive traits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collaer|first1=Marcia L.|last2=Hines|first2=Melissa|title=Human behavioral sex differences: A role for gonadal hormones during early development?|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=1 July 1995|volume=118|issue=1|pages=55–107|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.118.1.55|pmid=7644606|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bul/118/1/55/|language=English|issn=1939-1455}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Craft|first1=Rebecca M.|last2=Mogil|first2=Jeffrey S.|last3=Aloisi|first3=Anna Maria|title=Sex differences in pain and analgesia: the role of gonadal hormones|journal=European Journal of Pain|date=1 October 2004|volume=8|issue=5|pages=397–411|doi=10.1016/j.ejpain.2004.01.003|pmid=15324772|language=en|issn=1532-2149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, females with [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] demonstrate increased masculinity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hines|first1=Melissa|last2=Brook|first2=Charles|last3=Conway|first3=Gerard S.|title=Androgen and Psychosexual Development: Core Gender Identity, Sexual Orientation, and Recalled Childhood Gender Role Behavior in Women and Men with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH)|journal=The Journal of Sex Research|date=1 January 2004|volume=41|issue=1|pages=75–81|jstor=3813405|doi=10.1080/00224490409552215|pmid=15216426}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been shown that rhesus macaque children exhibit preferences for stereotypically male and female toys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yerkes.emory.edu/about/news/developmental_cognitive_neuroscience/toy_preferences.html |title=Yerkes - Yerkes Researchers Find Sex Differences in Monkey Toy Preferences Similar to Humans |publisher=Yerkes.emory.edu |date=2008-04-10 |accessdate=2013-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gender inequality in relationships====
Gender equality in relationships has been growing over the years but for the majority of relationships, the power lies with the male.&lt;ref name="van Hooff 2011 19–30"&gt;{{cite journal|last=van Hooff|first=Jenny H.|title=Rationalising inequality: heterosexual couples' explanations and justifications for the division of housework along traditionally gendered lines|journal=Journal of Gender Studies|date=March 2011|volume=20|issue=1|pages=19–30|doi=10.1080/09589236.2011.542016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even now men and women present themselves as divided along gender lines. A study done by Szymanowicz and Furnham, looked at the cultural stereotypes of intelligence in men and women, showing the gender inequality in self-presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Szymanowicz|first=Agata|author2=Adrian Furnham|title=Do intelligent women stay single? Cultural stereotypes concerning the intellectual abilities of men and women|journal=Journal of Gender Studies|date=March 2011|volume=20|issue=1|pages=43–54|doi=10.1080/09589236.2011.542019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This study showed that females thought if they revealed their intelligence to a potential partner, then it would diminish their chance with him. Men however would much more readily discuss their own intelligence with a potential partner. Also, women are aware of people’s negative reactions to IQ, so they limit its disclosure to only trusted friends. Females would disclose IQ more often than men with the expectation that a real true friend would respond in a positive way. Intelligence continues to be viewed as a more masculine trait, than feminine trait. The article suggested that men might think women with a high IQ would lack traits that were desirable in a mate such as warmth, nurturance, sensitivity, or kindness. Another discovery was that females thought that friends should be told about one’s IQ more so than males. However, males expressed doubts about the test’s reliability and the importance of IQ in real life more so than women. The inequality is highlighted when a couple starts to decide who is in charge of family issues and who is primarily responsible for earning income. For example, in Londa Schiebinger’s book, "Has Feminism Changed Science?", she claims that "Married men with families on average earn more money, live longer and happier, and progress faster in their careers," while "for a working woman, a family is a liability, extra baggage threatening to drag down her career."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schiebinger|first=Londa|title=Has Feminism Changed Science|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, statistics had shown that "only 17 percent of the women who are full professors of engineering have children, while 82 percent of the men do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schiebinger|first=Londa|title=Has Feminism Changed Science|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Attempts in equalizing household work====
Despite the increase in women in the labour force since the mid-1900s, traditional gender roles are still prevalent in American society. Women may be expected to put their educational and career goals on hold in order to raise children, while their husbands work. However, women who choose to work as well as fulfill a perceived gender role of cleaning the house and taking care of the children. Despite the fact that different households may divide chores more evenly, there is evidence that supports that women have retained the primary caregiver role within familial life despite contributions economically. This evidence suggest that women who work outside the home often put an extra 18 hours a week doing household or childcare related chores as opposed to men who average 12 minutes a day in childcare activities.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Ellen, and Jennifer Marshall. Issues of Gender. New York: Pearson Education, Inc., 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; One study by van Hooff showed that modern couples, do not necessarily purposefully divide things like household chores along gender lines, but instead may rationalize it and make excuses.&lt;ref name="van Hooff 2011 19–30"/&gt;  One excuse used is that women are more competent at household chores and have more motivation to do them. Another is that some say the demands of the males’ jobs is higher.

There was a study conducted at an "urban comprehensive school". They were asked questions regarding their views in sexual inequality. Many parents were for the equal pay for men and women. They also were in favor for men to help with the housework. In this study, the majority of the people who were interviewed wanted gender equality and more people wants a change in gender roles. Where men stay home, cleans, and cooks while the women can work and help support the family.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Gender roles have changed drastically over the past few decades. In the article, it says that in 1920-1966, there was data recorded that women spent the most time care-tending with the home and family. There was a study made with the gender roles with the males and females, The results showed that as women spend less time in the house, men have taken over the role as the mother. The article also said that women who work spend less time within the house and with their children if they have any. Furthermore, men are taking the roles of women in the homes and its changing as time goes on. Robin A. Douthitt, the author of the article, "The Division of Labor Within the Home: Have Gender Roles Changed?" concluded by saying, "(1) men do not spend significnatly more time with chil- dren when their wives are employed and (2) employed women spend signifi- cantly less time in child care than their full-time homemaker counterparts, over a 10-year period both mothers and fathers are spending more total time with children."

====Gender inequalities in relation to technology====
One survey showed that men rate their technological skills in activities such as basic computer functions and online participatory communication higher than women.  However, it should be noted that this study was a self-reporting study, where men evaluate themselves on their own perceived capabilities.  It thus is not data based on actual ability, but merely perceived ability, as participants' ability was not assessed. Additionally, this study is inevitably subject to the significant bias associated with self-reported data.&lt;ref&gt;Eszter Hargittai, What Causes Variation in Contributing to Participatory Web Sites?&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrary to such findings, a carefully controlled study that analyzed data sets from 25 developing countries led to the consistent finding that the reason why fewer women access and use digital technology is a direct result of their unfavorable conditions and ongoing discrimination with respect to employment, education and income.&lt;ref name="HilbertGend2011"/&gt; When controlling for these variables, women turn out to be more active users of digital tools than men. This turns the alleged digital gender divide into an opportunity: given women's affinity for ICT, and given that digital technologies are tools that can improve living conditions, ICT represents a concrete and tangible opportunity to tackle longstanding challenges of gender inequalities in developing countries, including access to employment, income, education and health services.

=== Property inheritance ===
Many countries have laws that give less inheritance of ancestral property for women compared to men.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.womanstats.org/substatics/Property%20Rights%20in%20Law%20and%20Practice%20for%20Women_2011tif_wmlogo3.png&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Qur'an]], {{Quran-usc|4|11}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Structural marginalization ===
Gender inequalities often stem from social structures that have institutionalized conceptions of gender differences.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

[[Marginalization]] occurs on an individual level when someone feels as if they are on the fringes or margins of their respective society. This is a social process and displays how current policies in place can affect people. For example, media advertisements display young girls with easy bake ovens (promoting being a housewife) as well as with dolls that they can feed and change the diaper of (promoting being a mother).

=== Gender stereotypes ===
{{main|Gender stereotypes}}
{{see also|Category:Feminism and the arts}}
Cultural stereotypes, which can dictate specific roles, are engrained in both men and women and these [[stereotype]]s are a possible explanation for gender inequality and the resulting gendered wage disparity. Women have traditionally been viewed as being caring and nurturing and are designated to occupations which require such skills.{{clarify|date=September 2012}}{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} While these skills are culturally valued,{{clarify|date=September 2012}} they were typically associated with domesticity, so occupations requiring these same skills are not economically valued.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Men have traditionally been viewed as the main worker in the home, so jobs held by men have been historically economically valued and occupations predominated by men continue to be economically valued and earn higher wages.&lt;ref name="Stratification"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2012}}

Gender Stereotypes influenced greatly by gender expectations, different expectations on gender influence how people determine their roles, appearance, behaviors, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Annual Review of Psychology Gender Stereotypes|journal = Annual Review of Psychology|volume = 69|pages = 275–298|last=Ellemers|first=Naomi|date=27 September 2017|doi = 10.1146/annurev-psych-122216-011719|pmid = 28961059}}&lt;/ref&gt; When expectations of gender roles deeply rooted in people's mind, people' values and ideas started to be influenced and leading to situation of stereotypes, which actualize their ideas into actions and perform different standards labelling the behaviors of people. Gender stereotypes limit opportunities of different gender when their performance or abilities were standardizing according to their gender-at-birth, that women and men may encounter limitations and difficulties when challenging the society through performing behaviors that their gender "not supposed" to perform. For example, men may receive judgments when they trying to stay at home and finish housework and allow their wives to go out and work instead, as men are expected to be work outside for earning money for the family.  The traditional concepts of gender stereotypes are being challenged nowadays in different societies and improvement could be observed that men could also be responsible for housework, women could also be construction worker in some societies. It is still a long process when traditional concepts and values have deep-rooted in people's mind, that higher acceptance towards gender roles and characteristics is homely to be gradually developed.

===Biological fertilisation stereotypes===
Bonnie Spanier coined the term hereditary inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schiebinger|first=London|title=Has Feminism Changed Science|year=2001|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=United States of America|isbn=978-0674005440}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her opinion is that some scientific publications depict human fertilization such that sperms seem to actively compete for the "passive" egg, even though in reality it is complicated (e.g. the egg has specific active membrane proteins that select sperm etc.)

===Sexism and discrimination===
Gender inequality can further be understood through the mechanisms of [[sexism]]. [[Discrimination]] takes place in this manner as men and women are subject to prejudicial treatment on the basis of gender alone. Sexism occurs when men and women are framed within two dimensions of social cognition.

Discrimination also plays out with networking and in preferential treatment within the economic market. Men typically occupy positions of power within the job economy. Due to taste or preference for other men because they share similar characteristics, men in these positions of power are more likely to hire or promote other men, thus discriminating against women.&lt;ref name="Stratification"/&gt;

Sonja B. Starr conducted a study in the US that found that the prison sentences that men serve are on average 63% longer than those that women serve when controlling for arrest offense and criminal history. However, the study does not purport to explain why this is the case.

There was a 5:1 ratio of men to women working in films. 30.8% of women having speaking characters, who may or may not have been a part of the 28.8% of women who were written to wear revealing clothing compared to the 7% of men who did, or the 26.2% of women who wore little to no clothing opposed to the 9.4% of men who did the same.&lt;ref name="Gender Inequality in Film"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gender Inequality in Film|url=https://www.nyfa.edu/film-school-blog/gender-inequality-in-film/|website=New York Film Academy Blog|accessdate=10/4/2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study analyzing five years of text from over 2,000 news sources found a similar 5:1 ratio of male to female names overall, and 3:1 for names in entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Shor | first1=E. | last2=van de Rijt | first2=A. | last3 = Miltsov | first3 = A. | last4 = Kulkarni | first4 = Vivek | last5 = Skiena | first5 = S. | year=2015 |title=A Paper Ceiling: Explaining the Persistent Underrepresentation of Women in Printed News | url=https://www.mcgill.ca/sociology/files/sociology/2015_-_asr.pdf |journal = American Sociological Review |volume=80 |issue=5|pages=960–984 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2013 [[Academy Awards]], 140 men were nominated for an award, but only 35 women were nominated. No woman was nominated for directing, cinematography, film editing, writing (original screenplay), or original score that year. Since the Academy Awards began in 1929, only seven women producers have won the Best Picture category (all of whom were co-producers with men), and only eight women have been nominated for Best Original Screenplay. [[Lina Wertmuller]] (1976), [[Jane Campion]] (1994), [[Sofia Coppola]] (2004), and [[Kathryn Bigelow]] (2012) were the only four women to be nominated for Best Director, with Bigelow being the first woman to win for her film ''[[The Hurt Locker]]''. 77%  of the Academy Awards' voters are male.&lt;ref name="Gender Inequality in Film"/&gt;

A group of Hollywood actors have launched their own social movement titled #AskMoreOfHim. This movement is built on the basis of men speaking out against sexual misconduct against females.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gse.harvard.edu/news/18/02/harvard-edcast-ask-more-him|title=Harvard Edcast Ask More of Him|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   A number of male activists, specifically in the film industry, have signed an open letter explaining their responsibility in the ownership of their actions, as well as calling out the actions of others. The letter has been signed and supported by Friends actor David Schwimmer, shown above, among many others. The Hollywood Reporter published their support saying, “We applaud the courage and pledge our support to the courageous women — and men, and gender non-conforming individuals — who have come forward to recount their experiences of harassment, abuse and violence at the hands of men in our country. As men, we have a special responsibility to prevent abuse from happening in the first place... After all, the vast majority of sexual harassment, abuse and violence is perpetrated by men, whether in Hollywood or not.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/david-arquette-david-schwimmer-join-hollywood- men-activists-launch-askmoreofhim-campaign-1090121|title=David Schwimmer Join Hollywood Men and Activists to Launch #AskMoreOfHim Campaign|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This accountability is set to change the way women are seen and treated in the film and television industry, hopefully ending in the closing of the gap women are experiencing in pay, promotion, and overall respect. This initiative was created in response to the #MeToo movement. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/news/2018/01/31/445669/politics-policy-turning-corner-sexual-harassment/|title=Politics Turning Corner on Sexual Harassment|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The #MeToo movement, started by a single tweet, asked women to share their stories of sexual assault against men in a professional setting. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/metoo-hashtag-becomes-anti-sexual-harassment-assault-rallying-cry-n810986|title=Me Too Anti Sexual Harassment|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within one day, 30,000 women had used the hashtag sharing their stories.

== Impact and counteractions ==
Gender inequality and discrimination are argued to cause and perpetuate poverty and [[social vulnerability|vulnerability]] in society as a whole.&lt;ref name=ODI1&gt;Nicola Jones, Rebecca Holmes, Jessica Espey 2008. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=2386&amp;title=gender-mdgs-gender-lens-vital-pro-poor-results Gender and the MDGs: A gender lens is vital for pro-poor results]. London: [[Overseas Development Institute]]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310100258/http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=2386&amp;title=gender-mdgs-gender-lens-vital-pro-poor-results |date=March 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Household and intra-household knowledge and resources are key influences in individuals' abilities to take advantage of external livelihood opportunities or respond appropriately to threats.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; High education levels and social integration significantly improve the productivity of all members of the household and improve equity throughout society. Gender Equity Indices seek to provide the tools to demonstrate this feature of [[poverty]].&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

Poverty has many different factors, one of which is the gender wage gap.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}  Women are more likely to be living in poverty and the wage gap is one of the causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2016/demo/p60-256.html|title=Income and Poverty in the United States: 2015|last=Bureau|first=US Census|website=www.census.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many difficulties in creating a comprehensive response.&lt;ref name=ODI2&gt;Nicola Jones and Rebecca Holmes 2010. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4943&amp;title=gender-politics-social-protection Gender, politics and social protection]. London: [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is argued{{By whom|date=March 2016}} that the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) fail to acknowledge gender inequality as a cross-cutting issue.  Gender is mentioned in MDG3 and MDG5: MDG3 measures gender parity in education, the share of women in wage employment and the proportion women in national legislatures.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;  MDG5 focuses on maternal mortality and on universal access to reproductive health.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;  These targets are significantly off-track.&lt;ref name=ODI2/&gt;

Addressing gender inequality through [[social protection]] programmes designed to increase [[Gender equity|equity]] would be an effective way of reducing gender inequality, according to the [[Overseas Development Institute]] (ODI).&lt;ref name=ODI2/&gt; Researchers at the ODI argue for the need to develop the following in social protection in order to reduce gender inequality and increase growth:&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;
* Community childcare to give women greater opportunities to seek employment
* Support parents with the care costs (e.g. South African child/disability grants)
* Education stipends for girls (e.g. Bangladesh’s Girls Education Stipend scheme)
* Awareness-raising regarding [[gender-based violence]], and other preventive measures, such as financial support for women and children escaping abusive environments (e.g. NGO pilot initiatives in Ghana)
* Inclusion of programme participants (women and men) in designing and evaluating social protection programmes
* Gender-awareness and analysis training for programme staff
* Collect and distribute information on coordinated care and service facilities (e.g. access to [[micro-credit]] and micro-entrepreneurial training for women)
* Developing monitoring and evaluation systems that include sex-disaggregated data
The ODI maintains that society limits governments' ability to act on economic incentives.&lt;ref name=ODI2/&gt;

NGOs tend to protect women against gender inequality and [[structural violence]].

During war, combatants primarily target men.  Both sexes die however, due to disease, malnutrition and incidental crime and violence, as well as the battlefield injuries which predominately affect men.&lt;ref&gt;Ormhaug ''et al'' say "In a widely respected study on war mortality in Kosovo, Spiegel and Salama (2000) found that men were 8.9 times more likely to die from war-related trauma than women, which coincides with men being systematically targeted."&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2009 review  of papers and data covering war related deaths disaggregated by gender concluded "It appears to be difficult to say whether more men or women die from conflict conditions overall."&lt;ref name="Ormhaug"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Armed Conflict Deaths Disaggregated by Gender |author=Christin Ormhaug, in collaboration with Patrick Meier and Helga Hernes|publisher=PRIO|date=23 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ratio also depends on the type of war, for example in the [[Falklands War]] 904 of the 907 dead were men.  Conversely figures for war deaths in 1990, almost all relating to civil war, gave ratios in the order of 1.3 males per female.

Another opportunity to tackle gender inequality is presented by modern [[information and communication technologies]]. In a carefully controlled study,&lt;ref name="HilbertGend2011"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hilbert|first=Martin|date=November–December 2011|title=Digital gender divide or technologically empowered women in developing countries?

Given that digital information and communication technologies have the potential to provide access to employment, education, income, health services, participation, protection, and safety, among others ([[ICT4D]]), the natural affinity of women with these new communication tools provide women with a tangible bootstrapping opportunity to tackle social discrimination.

{{Main|Global Gender Gap Report}}
Gender inequality is a result of the persistent discrimination of one group of people based upon gender and it manifests itself differently according to race, culture, politics, country, and economic situation.  It is furthermore considered a causal factor of violence against women.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}   While gender discrimination happens to both men and women in individual situations, discrimination against women is an entrenched, global pandemic.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}  In the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], rape and violence against women and girls is used as a tool of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gettleman|first=Jeffrey|title=Rape Epidemic Raises Trauma of Congo War|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/07/world/africa/07congo.html?ref=congothedemocratirepublicof|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=February 16, 2011|date=October 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|date=March 2016}}  In Afghanistan, girls have had acid thrown in their faces for attending school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Filins|first=Dexter|title=A School Bus for Shamsia|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/23/magazine/23school-t.htm|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=February 16, 2011|date=August 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Considerable focus has been given to the issue of gender inequality at the international level by organizations such as the [[United Nations]] (UN), the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), and the [[World Bank]], particularly in developing countries.  The causes and effects of gender inequality vary geographically, as do methods for combating it.

===Asia===
{{See also|Sex-selective abortion}}
One example of the continued existence of gender inequality in Asia is the "[[Missing women of China|missing girls]]" phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kristoff|first=Nicholas D.|title=The Women's Crusade|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/23/magazine/23Women-t.html|date=August 23, 2009|website=New York Times|accessdate=February 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Many families desire male children in order to ensure an extra source of income.

Gender inequality existed because of gender stereotypes in rural China, families may consider that is useless for girls to acquire knowledge at school because they will marry someone one day and their major responsibility is to take care of housework.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hannum|first=Emily|last2=Kong|first2=Peggy|last3=Zhang|first3=Yuping|title=Family sources of educational gender inequality in rural China: A critical assessment|journal=International Journal of Educational Development|volume=29|issue=5|pages=474–486|doi=10.1016/j.ijedudev.2009.04.007|pmid=20161037|pmc=2753976|year=2009|url=http://opendocs.ids.ac.uk/opendocs/handle/123456789/12627}}&lt;/ref&gt; When people have expectations on the gender roles, that considering marriage is the major goals of a girl's life in rural China, gender inequality easily existed to limit the rights and opportunities of women.

=== Cambodia ===
A Cambodian said, "Men are gold, women are white cloth", emphasizing that women had a lower value and importance compared to men.&lt;ref name="opendemocracy.net"/&gt; In Cambodia, approximately 15% (485,000 hectares) of land was owned by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/gender/Jordan_Mar2012/Presentations/Panel%201.a/Panel%201.a_3_Cambodia.pdf|title=Measuring Women Status And Gender Statistics in Cambodia Through the Surveys and Census|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=National Institute of Statistics (NIS), Ministry of Planning|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Asian culture, there is a stereotype that women usually have lower status than men because males carry on the family name and hold the responsibilities to take care of the family.

=== Europe ===
The Global Gender Gap Report put out by the [[World Economic Forum]] (WEF) in 2013 ranks nations on a scale of 0 to 1, with a score of 1.0 indicating full gender equality. A nation with 35 women and 65 men in political office would get a score of 0.538 as the WEF is measuring the gap between the two figures and not the actual percentage of women in a given category. While Europe holds the top four spots for gender equality, with [[Iceland]], [[Finland]], [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] ranking 1st through 4th respectively, it also contains two nations ranked in the bottom 30 countries, [[Albania]] at 108 and [[Turkey]] at 120. The [[Nordic countries|Nordic Countries]], for several years, have been at the forefront of bridging the gap in gender inequality. Every Nordic country, aside from [[Denmark]] who is at 0.778, has reached above a 0.800 score. In contrast to the Nordic nations, the countries of Albania and Turkey continue to struggle with gender inequality. Albania and Turkey failed to break the top 100 nations in 2 of 4 and 3 of 4 factors, respectively. However, despite the disparity, European nations continue to make advances in the many factors that are used to determine a nation's gender gap score.&lt;ref name="The Global Gender Gap Report 2013" /&gt;

==== Western Europe ====
[[Western Europe]], a region most often described as comprising the non-communist members of post-WWII Europe,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stylemanual.natgeo.com/home/E/europe-geographical-and-political|title=EUROPE, GEOGRAPHICAL AND POLITICAL - National Geographic Style Manual|website=stylemanual.natgeo.com|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; has, for the most part been doing well in eliminating the gender gap. Western Europe holds 12 of the top 20 spots on the Global Gender Gap Report for overall score. While remaining mostly in the top 50 nations, four Western European nations fall below that benchmark. [[Portugal]] is just outside of the top 50 at number 51 with score of 0.706 while Italy (71), Greece (81) and Malta (84) received scores of 0.689, 0.678 and 0.676, respectively.&lt;ref name="The Global Gender Gap Report 2013" /&gt;

==== Eastern Europe ====
A large portion of [[Eastern Europe]], a region most often described as the former communist members of post-WWII Europe,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; resides between 40th and 100th place in the Global Gender Gap Report. A few outlier countries include [[Lithuania]], which jumped nine places (37th to 28th) from 2011 to 2013, [[Latvia]], which has held the 12th spot for two consecutive years, Albania and Turkey.&lt;ref name="The Global Gender Gap Report 2013" /&gt;

===India===
{{main|Gender inequality in India}}
India ranking remains low in gender equality measures by the World Economic Forum, although the rank has been improving in recent years.&lt;ref name="The Global Gender Gap Report 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GenderGap_Report_2011.pdf 2011 Gender Gap Report] World Economic Forum, page 9&lt;/ref&gt; When broken down into components that contribute the rank, India performs well on political empowerment, but is scored near the bottom with China on [[sex selective abortion]]. India also scores poorly on overall female to male [[literacy]] and health rankings. India with a 2013 ranking of 101 out of 136 countries had an overall score of 0.6551, while Iceland, the nation that topped the list, had an overall score of 0.8731 (no gender gap would yield a score of 1.0).&lt;ref name="Global Gender Gap Report 2013"&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Gender Gap Report 2013|url=http://www.weforum.org/issues/global-gender-gap|publisher=World Economic Forum|accessdate=31 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140331190253/http://www.weforum.org/issues/global-gender-gap|archivedate=31 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender inequalities impact India's sex ratio, women's health over their lifetimes, their educational attainment, and economic conditions. It is a multifaceted issue that concerns men and women alike.

The [[World Economic Forum]] measures gender equity through a series of economic, educational, and political benchmarks.  It has ranked the United States as 19th (up from 31st in 2009) in terms of achieving gender equity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=World Economic Forum|year=2009|volume=Global Gender Gap Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The US Department of Labor has indicated that in 2009, "the median weekly earnings of women who were full-time wage and salary workers was... 80 percent of men's".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quick Stats on Women Workers |url=http://www.dol.gov/wb/stats/main.htm |website=U.S. Department of Labor |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426194948/http://www.dol.gov/wb/stats/main.htm |archivedate=April 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Department of Justice found that in 2009, "the percentage of female victims (26%) of intimate partner violence was about 5 times that of male victims (5%)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Crime Victimization Survey, 2010|publisher=Bureau of Justice Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "The United States ranks 41st in a ranking of 184 countries on maternal deaths during pregnancy and childbirth, below all other industrialized nations and a number of developing countries"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CEDAW 2011 website|url=http://www.cedaw2010.org/index.php/about-cedaw/cedaw-by-the-numbers|accessdate=February 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and women only represent 20% of members of Congress.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==== Political affiliations and behaviors ====
Existing research on the topic of gender/sex and politics has found differences in political affiliation, beliefs, and voting behavior between men and women, although these differences vary across cultures. Gender is omnipresent in every culture, and while there are many factors to consider when labeling people "Democrat" or "Republican"—such as race and religion—gender is especially prominent in politics.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Croucher|first=Stephen M.|last2=Spencer|first2=Anthony T.|last3=McKee|first3=Connie|date=2014-03-15|title=Religion, Religiosity, Sex, and Willingness to Express Political Opinions: A Spiral of Silence Analysis of the 2008 U.S. Presidential Election|journal=Atlantic Journal of Communication|volume=22|issue=2|pages=111–123|doi=10.1080/15456870.2014.890001|issn=1545-6870}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender in Communication: A Critical Introduction|last=DeFrancisco|first=Victoria Pruin|last2=Palczewski|first2=Catherine Helen|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4522-2009-3|location=Los Angeles|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studying gender and political behavior poses challenges, as it can be difficult to determine if men and women actually differ in substantial ways in their political views and voting behavior, or if biases and stereotypes about gender cause people to make assumptions.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ditonto|first=Tessa M.|last2=Hamilton|first2=Allison J.|last3=Redlawsk|first3=David P.|date=2013-05-14|title=Gender Stereotypes, Information Search, and Voting Behavior in Political Campaigns|journal=Political Behavior|language=en|volume=36|issue=2|pages=335–358|doi=10.1007/s11109-013-9232-6|issn=0190-9320}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, trends in voting behavior among men and women have been proven through research.

Research shows that women in postindustrial countries like the United States, Canada, and Germany primarily identified as conservative before the 1960s; however, as time has progressed and new waves of feminism have occurred, women have become more left-wing due to shared beliefs and values between women and parties more on the left.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Inglehart|first=Ronald|last2=Norris|first2=Pippa|date=2000-01-01|title=The Developmental Theory of the Gender Gap: Women's and Men's Voting Behavior in Global Perspective|journal=International Political Science Review / Revue Internationale de Science Politique|volume=21|issue=4|pages=441–463|jstor=1601598|doi=10.1177/0192512100214007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women in these countries typically oppose war and the death penalty, favor gun control, support environment protection, and are more supportive of programs that help people of lower socioeconomic statuses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Voting behaviors of men have not experienced as drastic of a shift over the last fifty years as women in their voting behavior and political affiliations. These behaviors tend to consistently be more conservative than women overall.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These trends change with every generation, and factors such as culture, race, and religion also must be considered when discussing political affiliation. These factors make the connection between gender and political affiliation complex due to intersectionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender in Communication: A Critical Introduction|last=DeFrancisco|first=Victoria Pruin|last2=Palczewski|first2=Catherine Helen|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4522-2009-3|location=Los Angeles|pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Candidate gender also plays a role in voting behavior. Women candidates are far more likely than male candidates to be scrutinized and have their competence questioned by both men and women when they are seeking information on candidates in the beginning stages of election campaigns.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Democrat male voters tend to seek more information about female Democrat candidates over male Democrat candidates. Female Republican voters tend to seek more information about female Republican candidates.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For this reason, female candidates in either party typically need to work harder to prove themselves competent more than their male counterparts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Challenges to women in politics ====
Overall, [[politics in the United States]] are dominated by men, which can pose many challenges to women who decide to enter the political sphere.  As the number of women participants in politics continue to increase around the world, the gender of female candidates serves as both a benefit and a hindrance within their campaign themes and advertising practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Yu-Kang|date=2014|title=Gender stereotypes as a double-edged sword in political advertising Persuasion effects of campaign theme and advertising style|url=|journal=International Journal of Advertising|doi=10.2501/IJA-33-2-203-234|pmid=|access-date=|volume=33|issue=2|pages=203–234}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overarching challenge seems to be that—no matter their actions—women are unable to win in the political sphere as different standards are used to judge them when compared to their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hillary Clinton in the News: Gender and Authenticity in American Politics|last=Parry-Giles|first=Shawn|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=Champaign|pages=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One area in particular that exemplifies varying perceptions between male and female candidates is the way female candidates decide to dress and how their choice is evaluated. When women decide to dress more masculine, they are perceived as being "conspicuous." When they decide to dress more feminine, they are perceived as "deficient."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flicker|first=Eva|date=2013|title=Fashionable (dis-)order in politics: Gender, power and the dilemma of the suit|url=|journal=International Journal of Media &amp; Cultural Politics|doi=10.1386/macp.9.2.201_3|pmid=|access-date=|volume=9|issue=2|pages=201–219}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, however, women in politics are generally expected to adhere to the masculine standard, thereby validating the idea that gender is binary and that power is associated with masculinity.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Charles|first=Nickie|date=2014-07-01|title=Doing Gender, Practising Politics: Workplace Cultures in Local and Devolved Government|journal=Gender, Work &amp; Organization|language=en|volume=21|issue=4|pages=368–380|doi=10.1111/gwao.12042|issn=1468-0432}}&lt;/ref&gt; As illustrated by the points above, these simultaneous, mixed messages create a "double-bind" for women. Some scholars go on to claim that this masculine standard represents symbolic violence against women in politics.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Political knowledge is a second area where male and female candidates are evaluated differently and where political science research has consistently shown women with a lower level of knowledge than their male counterparts.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dolan|first=Kathleen|date=2011-01-01|title=Do Women and Men Know Different Things? Measuring Gender Differences in Political Knowledge|journal=The Journal of Politics|volume=73|issue=1|pages=97–107|doi=10.1017/S0022381610000897|issn=0022-3816}}&lt;/ref&gt; One reason for this finding is the argument that there are different areas of political knowledge that different groups consider.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carpini|first=Michael|last2=Keeter|first2=Scott|year=1993|title=Measuring Political Knowledge: Putting First Things First|jstor=2111549|journal=American Journal of Political Science|volume=37|issue=4|pages=1179–1206|doi=10.2307/2111549|pmid=|url=https://repository.upenn.edu/asc_papers/24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this line of thought, scholars are advocating the replacement of traditional political knowledge with gender-relevant political knowledge because women are not as politically disadvantaged as it may appear.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

A third area that affects women's engagement in politics is their low level of political interest and perception of politics as a "men's game."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=Robert G.|date=2005-12-01|title=Religion, Race, and Gender Differences in Political Ambition|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S1743923X05050154|journal=Politics &amp; Gender|volume=null|issue=4|pages=577–596|doi=10.1017/S1743923X05050154|issn=1743-9248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite female candidates' political contributions being equal to that of male candidates, research has shown that women perceive more barriers to office in the form of rigorous campaigns, less overall recruitment, inability to balance office and family commitments, hesitancy to enter competitive environments, and a general lack of belief in their own merit and competence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lawless|first=Jennifer|last2=Fox|first2=Richard|date=2008|title=Why are women still not running for public office?|url=|journal=Issues in Governance Studies|volume=16|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Male candidates are evaluated most heavily on their achievements, while female candidates are evaluated on their appearance, voice, verbal dexterity, and facial features in addition to their achievements.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Steps needed for change ====
Several forms of action have been taken to combat institutionalized sexism. People are beginning to speak up or "talk back" in a constructive way to expose gender inequality in politics, as well as gender inequality and under-representation in other institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender in Communication: A Critical Introduction|last=DeFrancisco|first=Victoria Pruin|last2=Palczewski|first2=Catherine Helen|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4522-2009-3|location=Los Angeles|pages=117–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers who have delved into the topic of institutionalized sexism in politics have introduced the term "undoing gender." This term focuses on education and an overarching understanding of gender by encouraging "social interactions that reduce gender difference."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Some feminists argue that "undoing gender" is problematic because it is context-dependent and may actually reinforce gender. For this reason, researchers suggest "doing gender differently" by dismantling [[gender norm]]s and expectations in politics, but this can also depend on culture and level of government (e.g. local versus federal).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Another key to combating institutionalized sexism in politics is to diffuse gender norms through "gender-balanced decision-making," particularly at the international level, which "establishes expectations about appropriate levels of women in decision-making positions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Santos|first=Maria|last2=Amancio|first2=Ligia|last3=Alves|first3=Helder|date=2013|title=Gender and politics: The relevance of gender on judgments about the merit of candidates and the fairness of quotas|url=|journal=Portuguese Journal of Social Science|doi=10.1386/pjss.12.2.133_1|pmid=|access-date=|volume=12|issue=2|pages=133–149|hdl=10071/14575}}&lt;/ref&gt; In conjunction with this solution, scholars have started placing emphasis on "the value of the individual and the importance of capturing individual experience." This is done throughout a candidate's political career—whether that candidate is male or female—instead of the collective male or female candidate experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McDermott|first=Rose|date=2013-03-01|title=A Feminist Scientific Approach to the Analysis of Politics and Gender|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S1743923X12000761|journal=Politics &amp; Gender|volume=9|issue=1|pages=110–115|doi=10.1017/S1743923X12000761|issn=1743-9248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five recommended areas of further study for examining the role of gender in U.S. political participation are (1) realizing the "intersection between gender and perceptions"; (2) investigating the influence of "local electoral politics"; (3) examining "gender socialization"; (4) discerning the connection "between gender and political conservatism"; and (5) recognizing the influence of female political role models in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fox|first=Richard L.|date=2011-03-01|title=Studying Gender in U.S. Politics: Where Do We Go from Here?|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S1743923X10000589|journal=Politics &amp; Gender|volume=7|issue=1|pages=94–99|doi=10.1017/S1743923X10000589|issn=1743-9248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the fact that gender is intricately entwined in every societal institution, gender in politics can only change once gender norms in other institutions change, as well.

The '''gyrator–capacitor model'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=223957 |title = Lumped equivalent circuits of magnetic components: the gyrator-capacitor approach|author=D.C. Hamill|journal=IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics|
volume = 8 | issue = 2|date = 1993 |pages = 97–103|doi = 10.1109/63.223957|bibcode = 1993ITPE....8...97H}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[lumped element model|lumped-element model]] for [[magnetic fields]], similar to [[magnetic circuit]]s, but based on using elements analogous to capacitors (see [[magnetic capacitance]]) rather than elements analogous to resistors (see [[magnetic reluctance]]) to represent the magnetic flux path.   Windings are represented as [[gyrator]]s, interfacing between the electrical circuit and the magnetic model.

The primary advantage of the gyrator–capacitor model compared to the magnetic reluctance model is that the model preserves the correct values of energy flow, storage and dissipation.  The gyrator–capacitor model is an example of a [[Mechanical–electrical analogies#Other energy domains|group of analogies]] that preserve energy flow across energy domains by making power conjugate pairs of variables in the various domains analogous.

==Magnetic effective resistance==
'''Magnetic effective resistance''' ([[SI unit]]: [[Omega|Ω]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) is the [[Real analysis|real]] component of [[Magnetic impedance|complex magnetic impedance]].  This causes a magnetic circuit to lose magnetic potential energy.&lt;ref name=Pohl/&gt;&lt;ref name=Küpfmüller&gt;[[Karl Küpfmüller|Küpfmüller K.]] Einführung in die theoretische Elektrotechnik, Springer-Verlag, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; Active power in a magnetic circuit equals the product of magnetic effective resistance &lt;math&gt;r_\mathrm{M}&lt;/math&gt; and magnetic current squared &lt;math&gt;I_\mathrm{M}^2&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;P = r_\mathrm{M} I_\mathrm{M}^2&lt;/math&gt;

The magnetic effective resistance on a complex plane appears as the side of the resistance triangle for magnetic circuit of an alternating current. The effective magnetic resistance is bounding with the effective magnetic conductance &lt;math&gt;g_\mathrm{M}&lt;/math&gt; by the expression

:&lt;math&gt;g_\mathrm{M} = \frac{r_\mathrm{M}}{z_\mathrm{M}^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;z_\mathrm{M}&lt;/math&gt; is the full magnetic impedance of a magnetic circuit.

==Magnetic inductance==
{{distinguish||magnetic induction}}
In a [[magnetic circuit]], '''''magnetic inductance (inductive magnetic reactance)''''' is the analogy to inductance in an electrical circuit. In the SI system, it is measured in units of -[[ohm|Ω]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.  This model makes [[magnetomotive force]] (mmf) the analog of [[electromotive force]] in electrical circuits, and time rate of change of magnetic flux the analog of electric current.

For phasor analysis the magnetic inductive reactance is:

:&lt;math&gt;x_\mathrm{L} = \omega L_\mathrm{M}&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
:&lt;math&gt;L_\mathrm{M}&lt;/math&gt; is the magnetic inductivity ([[SI unit]]: s·[[ohm|Ω]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;)
:&lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the [[angular frequency]] of the magnetic circuit

In the complex form it is a positive imaginary number:

:&lt;math&gt;jx_\mathrm{L} = j\omega L_\mathrm{M}&lt;/math&gt;

The magnetic potential energy sustained by magnetic inductivity varies with the frequency of oscillations in electric fields. The average power in a given period is equal to zero.  Due to its dependence on frequency, magnetic inductance is mainly observable in magnetic circuits which operate at [[Very high frequency|VHF]] and/or [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] frequencies.

The notion of magnetic inductivity is employed in analysis and computation of circuit behavior in the  gyrator–capacitor model in a way analogous to [[inductance]] in electrical circuits.

==Magnetic impedance==
'''Magnetic impedance''' ([[SI unit]]: [[Omega|Ω]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) is the ratio of a sinusoidal magnetic tension &lt;math&gt;N_\mathrm{m}&lt;/math&gt; to a sinusoidal magnetic current &lt;math&gt;I_\mathrm{Mm}&lt;/math&gt; in a gyrator–capacitor model. Analogous to [[electrical impedance]], magnetic impedance is likewise a complex variable.

:&lt;math&gt;z_\mathrm{M} = \frac{N}{I_\mathrm{M}} = \frac{N_\mathrm{m}}{I_\mathrm{Mm}}&lt;/math&gt;

Magnetic impedance is also called the ''full'' magnetic resistance. It is derived from:

:&lt;math&gt;r_\mathrm{M} = z_\mathrm{M} \cos \phi&lt;/math&gt;, the [[magnetic effective resistance|effective magnetic resistance]] (real)
:&lt;math&gt;x_\mathrm{M} = z_\mathrm{M} \sin \phi&lt;/math&gt;, the [[magnetic reactive resistance|reactive magnetic resistance]] (imaginary)

The phase angle &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; of the magnetic impedance is equal to:

:&lt;math&gt;\phi = \arctan {\frac{x_\mathrm{M}}{r_\mathrm{M}}}&lt;/math&gt;

==Magnetic reactance==
'''Magnetic reactance''' is the parameter of a passive [[magnetic circuit]] or an element of the circuit, which is equal to the square root of the difference of squares of the [[magnetic complex impedance]] and [[magnetic effective resistance]] to a magnetic current, taken with the sign plus, if the magnetic current lags behind the [[Magnetic tension force|magnetic tension]] in phase, and with the sign minus, if the magnetic current leads the magnetic tension in phase.

The magnetic reactance of an undeveloped circuit with the inductivity and the capacitivity, which are connected in series, is equal: &lt;math&gt;x = x_L - x_C = \omega L_M - \frac{1}{\omega C_M}&lt;/math&gt; . If  &lt;math&gt;x_L = x_C&lt;/math&gt;, then the net reactance  &lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt; and [[resonance]] takes place in the circuit. In the general case  &lt;math&gt;x = \sqrt{z^2 - r^2}&lt;/math&gt;.  When an energy loss is absent  (&lt;math&gt;r = 0&lt;/math&gt;), &lt;math&gt;x = z&lt;/math&gt;. The angle of the phase shift in a magnetic circuit &lt;math&gt;\phi = \arctan{\frac{x}{r}}&lt;/math&gt;. On a complex plane, the magnetic reactance appears as the side of the resistance triangle for circuit of an alternating current.

==Magnetic capacitivity==
'''Magnetic capacitivity''' ([[SI unit]]: [[Henry (unit)|H]]), denoted as &lt;math&gt;C_\mathrm{M}&lt;/math&gt;, is an [[extensive property]] and is defined as:

&lt;math&gt;C_\mathrm{M} = \mu_\mathrm{r} \mu_0\frac{S}{l}&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
&lt;math&gt;\mu_\mathrm{r} \mu_0 = \mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|magnetic permeability]],  
&lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the element cross-section, and &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; is the element length.

For [[phasor analysis]], the magnetic permeability&lt;ref name=Arkadiew&gt;Arkadiew W. ''Eine Theorie des elektromagnetischen Feldes in den ferromagnetischen Metallen''. – Phys. Zs., H. 14, No 19, 1913, S. 928-934.&lt;/ref&gt; and the magnetic capacitivity are complex values.&lt;ref name=Arkadiew/&gt;&lt;ref name=Popov/&gt;

Magnetic capacitivity is also equal to magnetic flux divided by the difference of [[magnetic potential]] across the element.

&lt;math&gt;C_\mathrm{M} = \frac{\Phi}{\phi_\mathrm{M1}-\phi_\mathrm{M2}}&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_\mathrm{M1}-\phi_\mathrm{M2}&lt;/math&gt; is the difference of the [[magnetic potential]]s.

The notion of magnetic capacitivity is employed in the gyrator–capacitor model in a way analogous to [[capacitance]] in electrical circuits.

==Magnetic complex impedance==
'''''Magnetic complex impedance''''' is equal to the relationship of the complex effective or amplitude value of a sinusoidal [[magnetic tension]] on the passive [[magnetic circuit]] or its element, and accordingly the complex effective or amplitude value of a sinusoidal magnetic current in this circuit or in this element.

Magnetic complex impedance [1, 2] is measured in units – [&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\Omega}&lt;/math&gt;] and determined by the formula:

&lt;math&gt;Z_M = \frac{\dot N}{\dot {I}_M} = \frac{\dot {N}_m}{\dot {I}_Mm} = z_M e^{j\phi}&lt;/math&gt;
 
where
&lt;math&gt;z_M = \frac{N}{I_M} = \frac{N_m}{I_{Mm}}&lt;/math&gt; is the relationship of the effective or amplitude value of a [[magnetic tension]] and accordingly of the effective or amplitude magnetic current is called [[full magnetic resistance]] ([[magnetic impedance]]). The [[full magnetic resistance]] ([[magnetic impedance]]) is equal to the modulus of the [[complex magnetic impedance]]. The [[argument]] of a [[complex magnetic impedance]] is equal to the difference of the phases of the [[magnetic tension]] and magnetic current &lt;math&gt;\phi = \beta - \alpha&lt;/math&gt;.
[[Complex magnetic impedance]] can be presented in following form:

&lt;math&gt;Z_M = z_M e^{j\phi} = z_M \cos \phi + jz_M \sin \phi = r_M + jx_M &lt;/math&gt;

where 
&lt;math&gt;r_M = z_M \cos \phi&lt;/math&gt; is the real part of the [[complex magnetic impedance]], called the [[effective magnetic resistance]];    
&lt;math&gt;x_M = z_M \sin \phi&lt;/math&gt; is the imaginary part of the [[complex magnetic impedance]], called the [[reactive magnetic resistance]].  
The [[full magnetic resistance]] ([[magnetic impedance]]) is equal

&lt;math&gt;z_M = \sqrt{r_{M}^2 + x_{M}^2}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\phi = \arctan {\frac{x_M}{r_M}}&lt;/math&gt;

SUNY Press.{{ISBN|0791439798}}. p.59&lt;/ref&gt; or '''hand partialism''' or also '''Quirofilia''' is the [[sexual fetish]] for hands. This may include the sexual attraction to a specific area such as the fingers, palm or [[Nail (anatomy)|nails]], or the attraction to a specific action performed by the hands; which may otherwise be considered non-sexual—such as washing or drying dishes. This fetish may manifest itself as a desire to experience physical interaction, or as a source of sexual fantasy.

Hand fetishism is recognized by the porn industry; however, it is one of the least common fetishes, despite [[foot fetishism]] being the most common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studlife.com/scene/2009/11/04/foot-fetishes-fun-or-freaky/|title=Foot fetishes: Fun or freaky?|author=Moore, Lucy|date=November 4, 2009|accessdate=July 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hand fetishism is usually based in the biological indication that a partner is healthy and a good potential mate.

==Characteristics==
A hand fetish is a sexual attraction to the hands. This attraction is most commonly expressed with fingering, handjobs, sucking on the fingers and licking the palms.

Fingernail fetishism, a sub-type of hand fetishism is often expressed with scratching with the fingernails and painting the fingernails.

==Frequency==
In 2007, a study was conducted by the [[University of Bologna]] on around 5000 fetishist participants to see the prevalence of fetishes. The study analyzed the content inside online fetish communities and found only 669 participants referring to nails, an extension of hand fetishism.    This did not refer to fingernails specifically, and the amount of 669 was less than 1% of the participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://drmarkgriffiths.wordpress.com/tag/hand-fetishism/|title=Handy crafts: A brief look at fingernail fetishes|date=January 22, 2016|accessdate=July 8, 2016|author=Griffiths, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LOC Court of Neptune Fountain by Roland Hinton Perry - 1.jpg|thumb|222px|right|'' [[The Court of Neptune Fountain]]'' at the [[Library of Congress]] in Washington D.C. [[Roland Hinton Perry]]. (1895).]]

The first decorative [[fountain]] in the United States was dedicated in [[City Hall Park]], in [[New York City]], in 1842.  Early American fountains were used to distribute clean drinking water, had little ornamentation, and copied European styles.

In the 20th century, American fountains often ceased to distribute drinking water; they became purely decorative, and were designed to honor events or individuals, as works of urban sculpture or to imitate nature.  In the late 20th century, the [[musical fountain]], where the dance of water is controlled by a computer and is accompanied by lights and music, became a form of public entertainment in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] and other American cities.

== 1800-1900 ==
[[File:'Fourth of July in Center Square' by John Lewis Krimmel.JPG|thumb|200px|left|''Fourth of July in Centre Square'' (c.1809-12), [[John Lewis Krimmel]], [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]].]]
Philadelphia built the first citywide water system in the United States, which began operation in January 1801. Underground aqueducts carried drinking water from the [[Schuylkill River]], and twin steam pumps propelled it into a water tower at Centre Square, now the site of [[Philadelphia City Hall]]. Scottish-born architect [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe]] designed the system along with the [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]] pumping house/water tower.&lt;ref&gt;[http://schillerinstitute.org/educ/hist/eiw_this_week/v4n3_jan20_1801.html "Benjamin Latrobe Designs the first American Steam-Powered Municipal Waterworks,"] from ''This Week in History'', January 2012, The Schiller Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; Centre Square was converted from a meadow into a public park, and an ornamental fountain was added, 1808&amp;ndash;1809. Sculptor [[William Rush]] carved a wooden statue, ''Allegory of the Schuylkill River'' (better known as ''Water Nymph with Bittern''), to adorn the Centre Square fountain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pafa.org/museum/The-Collection-Greenfield-American-Art-Resource/Tour-the-Collection/Category/Collection-Detail/985/coltype--Sculpture/mkey--8434/sort57--3_3a30-/ ''Head of the Nymph''], from Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first monumental fountains in the United States were built to mark the termini of aqueducts bringing fresh drinking water into New York City. A [[cholera]] epidemic in 1832 and the disastrous [[Great Fire of New York]], in 1835, persuaded the government of New York City to build the [[Croton aqueduct]] to bring abundant fresh water into the city.  The [[Croton Dam]], aqueduct, and reservoir were finished in 1841,  bringing water 40 miles from the [[Croton River]] to New York City.  In commemoration, the first fountain in the U.S., the ''Croton Fountain'' in [[City Hall Park]], was turned on on October 14, 1842 and jetted water 50 feet into the air.&lt;ref&gt;Ric Burns and James Sanders, ''New York, an Illustrated History'', Alfred Knopf, New York, 1999, pg. 78-79.&lt;/ref&gt;  A second fountain in [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]] was also connected to the system.

The first fountains were very simple, without sculpture, and simply spouted water up into the air.  They no longer exist, though vestiges of the original water system remain.&lt;ref&gt;Marilyn Symmes with Maria Ann Conelli, "Fountains as Refreshment", in the collection ''Fountains- Splash and Spectacle, Water and Design from the Renaissance to the Present''. Thames and Hudson, London, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1848, Boston completed its own new water system, an aqueduct from [[Lake Cochituate]] 20 miles (32&amp;nbsp;km) to the [[Boston Common]], where the first fountain was located. A parade and festival were held to mark the fountain's opening on October 25, 1848.  The ceremony included schoolchildren singing an ode written by American poet [[James Russell Lowell]] for the event.  The ode began:

"My name is Water: I have sped
through strange dark ways untried before,
By pure desire of friendship led,
Cochituate's Ambassador:
He sends four gifts by me,
Long life, health, peace, and purity."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Marilynn Symmes and Maria Ann Conelli in ''Fountains, Splash and Spectacle''. Pg. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the first American fountains, which were simple and functional, in the 1850s, more decorative fountains were constructed as part of a nationwide effort to beautify American cities by building parks, squares, and fountains inspired by European models. 
[[File:Bethesda Fountain, Central Park.jpg|thumb|150px|''[[Bethesda Fountain]]'' in [[Central Park]], New York (1873)]]
For example, the ''[[Bethesda Fountain]]'' was created to adorn New York City's new [[Central Park]], which project had been begun in 1858 by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] and [[Calvert Vaux]], to create a vast [[natural landscape]] in the heart of the city.  In the middle of the park was one formal element: a mall adorned with elm trees and a terrace with views over a lake.  In 1863, the park commissioners decided to build a monumental fountain for the central basin in the middle of the mall.  The sculptor was a little-known American artist, [[Emma Stebbins]], whose brother was the head of the [[New York Stock Exchange]] and President of the Board of Commissioners, who lobbied on her behalf.  Her fountain was based on the biblical verse from the [[Gospel of Saint John]], in which an angel touched, or "troubled", the waters of the [[Pool of Bethesda]] in [[Jerusalem]], giving it healing powers.  She wrote about the fountain:  "We have no less healing, comfort and purification freely sent to us through the blessed gift of pure, wholesome water, which to all the countless homes of this great city comes like an angel visitant."&lt;ref&gt;Charlotte Streifer Rubinstein, 'American Women Sculptors: A History of Women Working in Three Dimensions'', Chicago, 1990, pg. 63-66. Cited in "The Bethesda Fountain in New York City", article by Andrew Scott Dolkart in ''Fountains- Splash and Spectacle, Water and Design from the Renaissance to the Present'', by Marilynn Symmes.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was criticized by some writers when it was opened in 1873: the ''New York Times'' called it "a feebly-pretty idealess thing",&lt;ref&gt;"The Bethesda Fountain", ''The New York Times'', June 1, 1873.&lt;/ref&gt; but gradually the fountain became a popular favorite, featured in many films and in recent times in [[Tony Kushner]]'s play ''[[Angels in America]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Kushner - ''Angels in America part two'', Perestroika, New York, 1994, pp. 143-146.  Cited by Andrew Scott Dolkart in ''Fountains - Splash and Spectacle''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1900-2000 ==
Fountains built in the United States between 1900 and 1950 mostly followed European models and classical styles.  For example:
*The handsome ''[[Samuel Francis Dupont Memorial Fountain]]'' (aka ''Dupont Circle Fountain''), in [[Dupont Circle]], [[Washington D.C.]], was designed and created by [[Henry Bacon]] and [[Daniel Chester French]], the architect and sculptor of the [[Lincoln Memorial]],  in 1921, in a pure [[Neoclassical sculpture|neoclassical]] style.
*The ''[[Buckingham Fountain]]'' in Grant Park, Chicago was one of the first American fountains to use powerful modern pumps to shoot water as high as 150 feet (46 meters) into the air.
*The ''Fountain of Prometheus,'' with sculpture by [[Paul Manship]], built at [[Rockefeller Center]] in [[New York City]] in 1933, was the first American fountain in the [[Art-Deco]] style.

After World War II, fountains in the United States became more varied in form.  Some, like the [[Vaillancourt Fountain]] in [[San Francisco]] (1971), were pure works of sculpture. The modernist French-Canadian [[Armand Vaillancourt]] built his monumental fountain at Embarcadero Plaza in San Francisco in a [[cubist]] style, though it was intended as a political statement - the official title is "Quebec Libre!", and the artist was arrested at the time of the opening for painting political slogans on his own fountain.

Other fountains, like the ''Frankin Roosevelt Memorial Waterfall'' (1997), by architect [[Lawrence Halprin]], were designed as landscapes to illustrate themes.  This fountain is part of the [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial]] in [[Washington D.C.]], which has four outdoor "rooms" illustrating FDR's Presidency.  Each "room" contains a cascade or waterfall;  the cascade in the third room illustrates the turbulence of the years of the World War II.  Halprin wrote at an early stage of the design; "the whole environment of the memorial becomes sculpture: to touch, feel, hear and contact - with all the senses."&lt;ref&gt;Halprin, Lawrence, Notebooks 1959-1971, Cambridge Massachusetts (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most unusual modern American fountains is the [[Civil Rights Memorial]] (1989) at the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] in [[Montgomery, Alabama]], designed by [[Maya Lin]], the designer of the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]] in Washington D.C.  The ''Civil Rights Memorial'' fountain features a low elliptical black granite table, with a thin surface of water flowing over the surface, over the inscribed names of civil rights leaders who lost their lives, illustrating the quotation from [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]:  "...Until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream."  Visitors are invited to touch the names through the water. "The water is as slow as I could get it," Lin wrote. "It remains very still until you touch it. Your hand carves ripples, which transform and alter the piece, just as reading the words completes the piece."&lt;ref&gt;Zinnser, William, "I Realized Her Tears Were Becoming Part of The Memorial (Maya Lin), ''Smithsonian'' 22, no. 6. September 1991 pp. 32-43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Societal attitudes towards same-sex relationships have varied over time and place, from expecting all males to engage in same-sex relationships, to casual integration, through acceptance, to seeing the practice as a minor sin, repressing it through law enforcement and judicial mechanisms, and to proscribing it under penalty of death. 
In a 1976 study, Gwen Broude and Sarah Greene compared attitudes towards and frequency of homosexuality in the ethnographic studies available in the [[Standard cross-cultural sample]]. They found that out of 42 communities: homosexuality was accepted or ignored in 9; 5 communities had no concept of homosexuality; 11 considered it undesirable but did not set punishments; and 17 strongly disapproved and punished. Of 70 communities, homosexuality was reported to be absent or rare in frequency in 41, and present or not uncommon in 29.&lt;ref&gt;Gwen J. Broude and Sarah J. Greene, "Cross-Cultural Codes on Twenty Sexual Attitudes and Practices", ''Ethnology'', Vol. 15, No. 4 (Oct., 1976), pp. 409-429.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Broude, Gwen J., and Sarah J. Greene, (1980). "Cross-Cultural Codes on Twenty Sexual Attitudes and Practices", In: ''Cross-Cultural Samples and Codes''. Herbert Barry III and Alice Schlegel, eds. pp. 313-334. Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was frequent in ancient Greece. However, in later cultures influenced by [[Abrahamic religions]], the [[Sodomy law#History|law]] and the [[Christianity and homosexuality#History of Christianity and homosexuality|church]] established [[sodomy]] as a transgression against divine law or a [[crime against nature]].

Many historical figures, including [[Socrates]], [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]], [[Edward II of England|Edward II]], and [[Hadrian]],&lt;ref&gt;''Roman Homosexuality'', Craig Arthur Williams, p.60&lt;/ref&gt; have had terms such as ''gay'' or ''[[bisexuality|bisexual]]'' applied to them; some scholars, such as [[Michel Foucault]], have regarded this as risking the anachronistic introduction of a contemporary [[social construct]] of sexuality foreign to their times,&lt;ref name="foucault"&gt;{{harv|Foucault|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; though others challenge this.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas K. Hubbard, Review of David M. Halperin, ''How to Do the History of Homosexuality.'' in ''[[Bryn Mawr Classical Review]]'' 2003.09.22&lt;/ref&gt;

A common thread of constructionist argument is that no one in antiquity or the Middle Ages experienced homosexuality as an exclusive, permanent, or defining mode of sexuality. [[John Boswell]] has countered this argument by citing ancient Greek writings by [[Plato]],&lt;ref name=boswell1&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=Boswell |date=1980 |title=Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality: Gay People in Western Europe from the Beginning of the Christian Era to the Fourteenth Century |location=Chicago |publisher=The University of Chicago Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; which describe individuals exhibiting exclusive homosexuality.

Among [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]] prior to European colonization, a number of Nations had respected ceremonial and social roles for homosexual, bisexual, and gender-nonconforming individuals in their communities; in many contemporary [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] and [[First Nations]] communities, these roles still exist.&lt;ref name=Estrada&gt;Estrada, Gabriel S. 2011.

[[File:Balboamurder.jpg|thumb|left|Balboa setting his [[war dog]]s upon Indian practitioners of sodomy in 1513; New York Public Library]]
The Spanish conquerors were horrified to discover sodomy openly practiced among native peoples, and attempted to crush it out by subjecting the ''[[Two-Spirit|berdache]]s'' (as the Spanish called them) under their rule to severe penalties, including public [[execution]], burning and being torn to pieces by dogs.&lt;ref name=coello&gt;Mártir de Anglería, Pedro.

==East Asia==
In [[East Asia]], same-sex love has been referred to since the earliest recorded history.

[[Homosexuality in China]], known as the ''pleasures of the bitten peach,'' ''the cut sleeve,'' or ''the southern custom,'' has been recorded since approximately 600 BCE. These euphemistic terms were used to describe behaviors, not identities (recently some fashionable young Chinese tend to euphemistically use the term "brokeback," 斷背 ''duanbei'' to refer to homosexual men, from the success of director [[Ang Lee]]'s film ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'').&lt;ref name=jongo&gt;{{citation |url=http://news.jongo.com/articles/07/0820/30157/MzAxNTcoluZIoia.html |title=Most frequently used new coinages in daily Chinese |date=August 20, 2007 |accessdate=2007-09-07 |periodical=Jongo News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011175158/http://news.jongo.com/articles/07/0820/30157/MzAxNTcoluZIoia.html |archivedate=October 11, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationships were marked by differences in age and social position. However, the instances of same-sex affection and sexual interactions described in the classical novel ''[[Dream of the Red Chamber]]'' seem as familiar to observers in the present, as do equivalent stories of romances between heterosexual people during the same period.

[[Homosexuality in Japan#Ancient Japan|Homosexuality in Japan]], variously known as [[shudo]] or [[nanshoku]], has been documented for over one thousand years and had some connections to the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monastic life and the [[samurai]] tradition. This same-sex love culture gave rise to strong traditions of [[Ukiyo-e|painting]] and literature documenting and celebrating such relationships.

Similarly, in [[Thailand]], ''[[kathoey]]'', or "ladyboys," have been a feature of Thai society for many centuries, and Thai kings had male as well as female lovers. While ''kathoey'' may encompass simple [[effeminacy]] or [[transvestite|transvestism]], it most commonly is treated in [[Thai culture]] as a [[third gender]]. They are generally accepted by society, and Thailand has never had legal prohibitions against homosexuality or homosexual behavior.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

[[File:Warren Cup BM GR 1999.4-26.1 n1.jpg|thumb|Roman man penetrating a youth, middle of the 1st century [[Anno Domini|AD]]. Found in Bittir (?), near [[Jerusalem]]]]
The earliest Western documents (in the form of literary works, art objects, and [[Greek mythology|mythographic materials]]) concerning same-sex relationships are derived from [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|ancient Greece]].

The formal practice, an erotic yet often restrained relationship between a free-born (i.e. not a slave or [[freedman]]) adult male and a free-born [[adolescent]], was valued for its [[pedagogy|pedagogic benefits]] and as a means of [[population control]], though occasionally blamed for causing [[societal disorder|disorder]]. [[Plato]] praised its benefits in his early writings&lt;ref name=plato1&gt;[[Plato]], Phaedrus in the ''[[Symposium]]''&lt;/ref&gt; but in his late works proposed its prohibition.&lt;ref name=plato2&gt;Plato, Laws, 636D &amp; 835E&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Symposium'' (182B-D), Plato equates acceptance of homosexuality with [[democracy]], and its suppression with [[despotism]], saying that homosexuality "is shameful to [[barbarian]]s because of their despotic governments, just as [[philosophy]] and [[athletics (physical culture)|athletics]] are, since it is apparently not in best interests of such rulers to have great ideas engendered in their subjects, or powerful friendships or physical unions, all of which love is particularly apt to produce".&lt;ref name=boswell1/&gt;

Aristotle, in his ''Politics'', dismissed Plato's ideas about abolishing homosexuality (2.4); he explains that barbarians like the [[Celt]]s accorded it a special honour (2.6.6), while the [[Cretan]]s used it to regulate the population (2.7.5).&lt;ref name=boswell1/&gt;

Little is known of [[lesbianism|female homosexuality]] in [[Ancient history|antiquity]]. [[Sappho]], born on the island of [[Lesbos]], was included by later [[Classical Greek people|Greeks]] in the canonical list of [[nine lyric poets]]. The adjectives deriving from her name and place of birth (''sapphic'' and ''lesbian'') came to be applied to female homosexuality beginning in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=lesbian&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=lesbian|title=Lesbian|accessdate=2009-02-07|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|year=2001|author=Douglas Harper}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sapphic&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Sapphic|title=Sapphic|accessdate=2009-02-07|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|year=2001|author=Douglas Harper}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sappho's poetry centers on [[passion (emotion)|passion]] and love for various personages and both genders. The [[narrator]]s of many of her poems speak of [[infatuation]]s and love (sometimes requited, sometimes not) for various females, but descriptions of [[sexual act|physical acts]] between women are few and subject to debate.&lt;ref&gt;Denys Page, ''Sappho and Alcaeus'', Oxford UP, 1959, pp. 142–146.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Campbell|1982|p=xi–xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence that she ran an academy for girls.

[[File:NAMA Sappho lisant.jpg|thumb|200px|Sappho reading to her companions on an Attic vase of c. 435 BC.]]

In [[ancient Rome]], the young male body remained a focus of male sexual attention, but [[pederasty|relationships]] were between older free men and slaves or freed youths who took the receptive role in sex.&lt;ref&gt;Prioreschi, Plinio (1996). A History of Medicine. Horatius Press. pp. 21–23, 29. {{ISBN|1-888456-03-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Every [[Roman emperor|emperor]] with the exception of [[Claudius]] took male lovers.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, Edward (1781). The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hellenophile]] emperor [[Hadrian]] is renowned for his relationship with [[Antinous]]. However, by 390 A.D., Emperor [[Theodosius I]] made homosexuality a legally punishable offense for the passive partner: "All persons who have the shameful custom of condemning a man's body, acting the part of a woman's to the sufferance of alien sex (for they appear not to be different from women), shall expiate a crime of this kind in avenging flames in the sight of the people." &lt;ref&gt;Joseph Robert Thornton, Bowers v. Hardrick: An Incomplete Constitutional Analysis, 65 U.N.C. L. Rev. 1100, 1100 n. 11 (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; In 558, toward the end of his reign, [[Justinian I|Justinian]] expanded the proscription to the active partner as well, warning that such conduct can lead to the destruction of cities through the "[[Divine retribution|wrath of God]]". Notwithstanding these regulations, taxes on [[brothels]] of boys available for homosexual sex continued to be collected until the end of the reign of [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius I]] in 618.&lt;ref&gt;Procopius: Secret History: XIX.

Covici, 1927; New York: Covici Friede, 1927) &lt;http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/proc/shp/shp22.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Renaissance]], wealthy cities in northern [[Italy]]—[[Florence]] and [[Venice]] in particular—were renowned for their widespread practice of same-sex love, engaged in by a considerable part of the male population and constructed along the classical pattern of Greece and Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Rocke, Michael, (1996), ''Forbidden Friendships: Homosexuality and male Culture in Renaissance Florence'', {{ISBN|0-19-512292-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruggiero, Guido, (1985), ''The Boundaries of Eros'', {{ISBN|0-19-503465-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; But even as many of the male population were engaging in same-sex relationships, the authorities, under the aegis of the [[Officers of the Night]], were [[prosecution|prosecuting]], [[fine (penalty)|fining]], and [[imprisonment|imprisoning]] a good portion of that population.&lt;ref&gt;Florentine proverb, ca. 1480.

Between 1864 and 1880 [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs]] published a series of twelve tracts, which he collectively titled ''Research on the Riddle of Man-Manly Love.'' In 1867 he became the first self-proclaimed homosexual person to speak out publicly in defense of homosexuality when he pleaded at the [[Congress of German Jurists]] in [[Munich]] for a resolution urging the repeal of [[anti-homosexual law]]s. ''Sexual Inversion'' by [[Havelock Ellis]], published in 1896, challenged theories that homosexuality was abnormal, as well as stereotypes, and insisted on the ubiquity of homosexuality and its association with intellectual and artistic achievement.&lt;ref name=sexualinversion&gt;{{citation |title=Sexual Inversion |first=Havelock |last=Ellis |first2=John Addington |last2=Symonds |year=1975 |publisher=Arno Press |isbn=0-405-07363-1}} (reprint)&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[medical text]]s like these (written partly in [[Latin]] to obscure the sexual details) were not widely read by the general public, they did lead to the rise of [[Magnus Hirschfeld]]'s [[Scientific Humanitarian Committee]], which campaigned from 1897 to 1933 against [[Paragraph 175|anti-sodomy laws in Germany]], as well as a much more informal, unpublicized movement among British intellectuals and writers, led by such figures as [[Edward Carpenter]] and [[John Addington Symonds]]. Beginning in 1894 with ''Homogenic Love'', [[Socialist]] activist and poet [[Edward Carpenter]] wrote a string of pro-homosexual articles and pamphlets, and "came out" in 1916 in his book ''My Days and Dreams''. In 1900, [[Elisar von Kupffer]] published an [[anthology]] of homosexual literature from antiquity to his own time, ''[[Lieblingminne und Freundesliebe in der Weltliteratur]]''. His aim was to broaden the public perspective of homosexuality beyond its being viewed simply as a medical or biological issue, but also as an ethical and cultural one.

There are a handful of accounts by Arab travelers to Europe during the mid-1800s. Two of these travelers, Rifa'ah al-Tahtawi and Muhammad sl-Saffar, show their surprise that the French sometimes deliberately mis-translated love poetry about a young boy, instead referring to a young female, to maintain their social norms and morals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=El-Rouayheb|first=Khaled|title=Before Homosexuality in the Arab-Islamic World, 1500-1800|year=2005|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|isbn=0-226-72988-5|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among many [[Middle East]]ern [[Muslim]] cultures egalitarian or age-structured homosexual practices were, and remain, widespread and thinly veiled. The prevailing pattern of same-sex relationships in the temperate and sub-tropical zone stretching from Northern India to the Western Sahara is one in which the relationships were—and are—either gender-structured or age-structured or both. In recent years, egalitarian relationships modeled on the western pattern have become more frequent, though they remain rare.

[[File:Mastaba of Niankhkhum and Khnumhotep embrace.jpg|thumb|Nyankh-khnum and Khnum-hotep kissing.]]
[[Homosexuality in ancient Egypt]] is a passionately disputed subject within [[Egyptology]]: historians and egyptologists alike debate what kind of view the Ancient Egyptians society fostered about [[homosexuality]]. Only a handful of direct hints have survived to this day and many possible indications are only vague and offer plenty of room for speculation.

The best known case of possible homosexuality in Ancient Egypt is that of the two high officials [[Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum|Nyankh-Khnum and Khnum-hotep]]. Both men lived and served under [[pharaoh]] [[Niuserre]] during the [[Fifth Dynasty of Egypt|5th Dynasty]] (c. 2494&amp;ndash;2345 BC).&lt;ref name=RPH&gt;Richard Parkinson: ''Homosexual Desire and Middle Kingdom Literature''. In: ''The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology (JEA)'', vol. 81, 1995, pp.&amp;nbsp;57–76.&lt;/ref&gt; Nyankh-Khnum and Khnum-hotep each had families of their own with children and wives, but when they died their families apparently decided to bury them together in one and the same [[mastaba]] tomb. In this mastaba, several paintings depict both men embracing each other and touching their faces nose-on-nose. These depictions leave plenty of room for speculation, because in Ancient Egypt the [[Eskimo kissing|nose-on-nose touching]] normally represented a kiss.&lt;ref name=RPH/&gt;

Egyptologists and historians disagree about how to interpret the paintings of Nyankh-khnum and Khnum-hotep. Some scholars believe that the paintings reflect an example of homosexuality between two married men and prove that the Ancient Egyptians accepted same-sex relationships.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101020071548/http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/archaeology/sites/africa/niankhkhnum_and_khnumhotep.html Dena Connors-Millard: ''Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep - Evidence of Gay Relationships Exists as Early as 2400 B.C.?''] (English).&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars disagree and interpret the scenes as an evidence that Nyankh-khnum and Khnum-hotep were [[twin]]s, even possibly [[conjoined twins]]. No matter what interpretation is correct, the paintings show at the very least that Nyankh-khnum and Khnum-hotep must have been very close to each other in life as in death.&lt;ref name=RPH/&gt;

It remains unclear, what exact view the Ancient Egyptians fostered about homosexuality. Any document and literature that actually contains sexual orientated stories, never name the nature of the sexual deeds, but instead uses stilted and flowery paraphrases. While the stories about Seth and his sexual behavior may reveal rather negative thoughts and views, the tomb inscription of Nyankh-khnum and Khnum-hotep may instead suggest that homosexuality was likewise accepted. Ancient Egyptian documents never clearly say that same-sex relationships were seen as reprehensible or despicable. And no Ancient Egyptian document mentions that homosexual acts were set under penalty. Thus, a straight evaluation remains problematic.&lt;ref name=RPH/&gt;&lt;ref name=EBT&gt;Emma Brunner-Traut: ''Altägyptische Märchen. Mythen und andere volkstümliche Erzählungen''. 10th Edition. Diederichs, Munich 1991, {{ISBN|3-424-01011-1}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;178–179.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century [[Mwanga II]] (1868–1903) the Kabaka of Buganda regularly had sex with his male page.&lt;ref&gt;"Long-Distance Trade and Foreign Contact". Uganda. Library of Congress Country Studies. December 1990. Retrieved 6 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ethiopia Bieber (1909) “encountered Uranism” among the Semitic Harari people and noted that “sodomy is not foreign to the Harari. Albeit not as commonly, it also occurs among the Galla [Oromo] and Somal[i].” He also noted mutual masturbation by both sexes and all ages for all three peoples, and specified that among the Harari, Uranism was practiced as often between
men as between men and boys. More recently, Gamst (1969) reported homosexual relations among shepherd boys of the Cushitic-speaking Qemant (Kemant) of central Ethiopia. Among Amhara peasants, Messing (1957) found (better-accepted) male transvestites, who they view as “god’s mistakes.” Wändarwäräd (“literally male-female”) with visible male sexual characteristics, but whose structure is popularly believed to be defective. Among the Maale of southern Ethiopia, “a small minority [of men] crossed over to feminine roles. Called ashtime, these (biological) males dressed like women, performed female tasks, cared for their own houses, and apparently had sexual relations with men,” according to Donald Donham (1990).

Cross-gender homosexuality not tied to possession cults has been reported in a number of East African societies. Needham (1973) described a religious leadership role called mugawe among the Meru of Kenya which includes wearing women's clothes and hairstyle. Mugawe are frequently homosexual, and sometimes are married to a man. Bryk (1964) reported active (i.e., insertive)
Kikuyu pederasts called onek. and also mentioned “homoerotic bachelors” among the pastoralist Nandi and Maragoli (Wanga).

== Historiographic considerations ==
The term ''homosexuality'' was invented in the 19th century, with the term ''heterosexuality''  invented later in the same century to contrast with the earlier term. The term ''bisexuality'' was invented in the 20th century as sexual identities became defined by the predominate sex to which people are attracted and thus a label was needed for those who are not predominantly attracted to one sex. This points out that the history of sexuality is not solely the history of different-sex sexuality plus the history of same-sex sexuality, but a broader conception viewing of historical events in light of our modern concept or concepts of sexuality taken at its most broad and/or literal definitions.

Historical personalities are often described using modern sexual identity terms such as ''straight'', ''[[bisexuality|bisexual]]'', ''[[gay]]'' or ''[[queer]]''. Those who favour the practice say that this can highlight such issues as discriminatory historiography by, for example, putting into relief the extent to which same-sex sexual experiences are excluded from biographies of noted figures, or to which sensibilities resulting from same-sex attraction are excluded from literary and artistic consideration of important works, and so on. As well as that, an opposite situation is possible in the modern society: some LGBT-supportive researchers stick to the homosexual theories, excluding other possibilities.

However, many, especially in the academic world, regard the use of modern labels as problematic, owing to differences in the ways that different societies constructed sexual orientation identities and to the connotations of modern words like ''queer''. For example, in many societies same-sex sex acts were expected, or completely ignored, and no identity was constructed on their basis at all. Academic works usually specify which words will be used and in which context. Readers are cautioned to avoid making assumptions about the identity of historical figures based on the use of the terms mentioned above.

=== Ancient Greece ===
{{Main|Homosexuality in ancient Greece|Pederasty in ancient Greece}}
Greek men had great latitude in their sexual expression, but their wives were severely restricted and could hardly move about the town unsupervised if she was old enough that people would ask whose mother she was, not whose wife she was.

Men could also seek adolescent boys as partners as shown by some of the earliest documents concerning same-sex [[pederasty|pederastic]] relationships, which come from [[Ancient Greece]]. Often adolescent boys were favored over women. One ancient saying claimed that "Women are for business, boys are for pleasure." Though slave boys could be bought, free boys had to be courted, and ancient materials suggest that the father also had to consent to the relationship. Such relationships did not replace marriage between man and woman, but occurred before and during the marriage. A mature man would not usually have a mature male mate, but there were exceptions (among whom [[Alexander the Great]]) He would be the ''erastes'' (lover) to a young ''eromenos'' (loved one). Dover suggests that it was considered improper for the eromenos to feel desire, as that would not be masculine. Driven by desire and admiration, the erastes would devote himself unselfishly by providing all the education his eromenos required to thrive in society. In recent times, Dover's theory suggests that [[#Outside Reading|questioned]] in light of massive evidence of ancient art and love poetry, a more emotional connection than earlier researchers liked to acknowledge. Some research has shown that ancient Greeks believed semen to be the source of knowledge and that these relationships served to pass wisdom on from the erastes to the eromenos.

=== The Middle Ages ===
[[File:Burning of Sodomites.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Two males accused of sodomy burned at the stake, Zurich 1482 (Zurich Central Library)]]
Through the medieval period, homosexuality was generally condemned and thought to be the moral of the story of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]]. Historians debate if there were any prominent homosexuals and bisexuals at this time, but it is argued that figures such as [[Edward II of England|Edward II]], [[Richard the Lionheart]], [[Philip II Augustus]], and [[William Rufus]] were engaged in same-sex relationships.

Also, historian Allan A. Tulchin recently argued that a form of male same-sex marriage existed in Medieval France, and possibly other areas in Europe, as well. There was a legal category called "enbrotherment" (affrèrement) that allowed two men to share living quarters, pool their resources, and effectively live as a married couple. The couple shared "one bread, one wine, one purse."&lt;ref&gt;Allan A. Tulchin, "Same-Sex Couples Creating Households in Old Regime France: The Uses of the Affrèrement," ''The Journal of Modern History''. Volume 79, Issue 3, Page 613–647, Sep 2007. [http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/action/doSearch?searchText=tulchin&amp;filter=all&amp;x=0&amp;y=0]&lt;/ref&gt; The article received considerable attention in the English-language press, since Tulchin may have discovered the earliest form of same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;The Telegraph {{cite web|url=http://my.telegraph.co.uk/go/tag/view/blog_post/humanity?num=10&amp;pg=3|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126082839/http://my.telegraph.co.uk/go/tag/view/blog_post/humanity?num=10&amp;pg=3|archivedate=2009-01-26|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2010-06-18|df=}}, NPR [https://www.npr.org/blogs/news/2007/08/could_the_idea_of_civil_unions.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Tulchin's views have also sparked significant controversy, as they challenge the generally held view that the medieval period was one of the most anti-gay in history.

== Psychiatry ==
Freud, among others, argued that neither predominantly different- nor same-sex sexuality were the norm, instead that what is called "bisexuality" is the normal human condition thwarted by society.

In 1948 [[Alfred Kinsey]] publishes ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Male'', popularly known as the [[Kinsey Reports]].

Homosexuality was deemed to be a psychiatric disorder for many years, although the studies this theory was based on were later determined to be flawed. In 1973 homosexuality was declassified as a mental illness in the [[United Kingdom]]. In 1986 all references to homosexuality as a psychiatric disorder were removed from the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM) of the [[American Psychiatric Association]].

== The sexual revolution ==
During the [[Sexual Revolution]], the different-sex sexual ideal became completely separated from procreation, yet at the same time was distanced from same-sex sexuality. Many people viewed this freeing of different-sex sexuality as leading to more freedom for same-sex sexuality.

The riot began on Friday, June 27, 1969, during a routine police raid, when transwomen and men, gay men and women, street queens, and other street people fought back in the spirit of the civil rights movements of the era.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Matzner.

A year later the first Gay Pride March was held to mark the anniversary of the uprising.

'''Information assurance''' ('''IA''') is the practice of assuring information and managing risks related to the use, processing, storage, and transmission of information or data and the systems and processes used for those purposes. Information assurance includes protection of the integrity, availability, authenticity, [[non-repudiation]] and confidentiality of user data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sosin|first=Artur|date=2018|title=HOW TO INCREASE THE INFORMATION ASSURANCE IN THE INFORMATION AGE|url=http://www.jodrm.eu/issues/volume9_issue1/05_Sosin.pdf|journal=Journal of Defense Resources Management|volume=9|pages=45-57|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses physical, technical, and administrative controls to accomplish these tasks. While focused predominantly on information in digital form, the full range of IA encompasses not only digital, but also analog or physical form. These protections apply to [[data in transit]], both physical and electronic forms, as well as [[data at rest]] in various types of physical and electronic storage facilities. 
Information assurance as a field has grown from the practice of [[information security]].

==Overview==

Information assurance (IA) is the process of getting the right information to the right people at the right time. IA benefits business through the use of information risk management, trust management, resilience, appropriate architecture, system safety, and security, which increases the utility of information to authorized users and reduces the utility of information to those unauthorized.&lt;ref name="Bridging the air gap"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Richardson|first1=Christopher|title=Bridging the air gap: an information assurance perspective|url=http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/355926/1/Richardson.pdf|website=ePrints Soton|publisher=University of Southampton|accessdate=3 November 2015|ref=bridging_air_gap}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is strongly related to the field of [[information security]], and also with [[business continuity]]. IA relates more to the business level and [[strategy|strategic]] [[risk management]] of information and related systems, rather than the creation and application of security controls. Therefore, in addition to defending against malicious [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]] and code (e.g., [[virus]]es), IA practitioners consider [[corporate governance]] issues such as [[privacy]], regulatory and standards [[Regulatory compliance|compliance]], [[audits|auditing]], [[Business continuity planning|business continuity]], and [[disaster recovery]] as they relate to information systems. Further, while information security draws primarily from [[computer science]], IA is an interdisciplinary field requiring expertise in [[business]], [[accounting]], user experience, [[fraud]] examination, [[forensic science]], [[management science]], [[systems engineering]], [[security engineering]], and [[criminology]], in addition to computer science. Therefore, IA is best thought of as a superset of information security (i.e. umbrella term), and as the business outcome of Information Risk Management.

Information assurance is also the term used by governments, including the government of the United Kingdom, for the provision of holistic security to information systems.  In this use of the term, the interdisciplinary approach set out above is somewhat lessened in that, while security/ systems engineering, business continuity/ enterprise resilience, forensic investigation and threat analysis is considered, management science, accounting and criminology is not considered in developing mitigation to the risks developed in the risk assessments conducted.  HMG Information Assurance Standard 1&amp;2, which has replaced HMG Information Security Standard 2, sets out the principles and requirements of risk management in accordance with the above principles and is one of the Information Assurance Standards currently used within the UK public sector.

==Process==

The information assurance process typically begins with the enumeration and classification of the information [[asset (computing)|assets]] to be protected. Next, the IA practitioner will perform a [[risk assessment]] for those assets. Vulnerabilities in the information assets are determined in order to enumerate the threats capable of exploiting the assets. The assessment then considers both the probability and impact of a threat exploiting a vulnerability in an asset, with impact usually measured in terms of cost to the asset's stakeholders. The sum of the products of the threats' impact and the probability of their occurring is the total risk to the information asset.

With the risk assessment complete, the IA practitioner then develops a [[Risk Management Plan|risk management plan]]. This plan proposes countermeasures that involve mitigating, eliminating, accepting, or transferring the risks, and considers prevention, detection, and response to threats. A framework published by a standards organization, such as [[Risk IT]], [[CobiT]], [[PCI DSS]] or [[ISO/IEC 27002]], may guide development. [[Countermeasure (computer)|Countermeasures]] may include technical tools such as [[Firewall (computing)|firewalls]] and [[anti-virus software]], policies and procedures requiring such controls as regular backups and configuration hardening, employee training in security awareness, or organizing personnel into dedicated [[computer emergency response team]] (CERT) or computer security incident response team ([[CSIRT]]).  The cost and benefit of each countermeasure is carefully considered. Thus, the IA practitioner does not seek to eliminate all risks, were that possible, but to manage them in the most [[cost-effective]] way.

After the risk management plan is implemented, it is tested and evaluated, often by means of formal audits. The IA process is an iterative one, in that the risk assessment and risk management plan are meant to be periodically revised and improved based on data gathered about their completeness and effectiveness.

The '''International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems''' or '''AAMAS''' is the leading scientific conference for research in the areas of artificial intelligence, autonomous agents, and multiagent systems. It is annually organized by a non-profit organization called the International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (IFAAMAS).

== History ==
The AAMAS conference is a merger of three major international conferences/workshops, namely International Conference on Autonomous Agents (AGENTS), International Conference on Multi-Agent Systems (ICMAS), and International Workshop on Agent Theories, Architectures, and Languages (ATAL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aamas-conference.org/ | title=International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (IFAAMAS) | accessdate=2 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, this highly respected joint conference provides a quality forum for discussing research in this area.

== Current and previous conferences ==
The next AAMAS conference (AAMAS 2018) will take place from July 10-15, 2018, in Stockholm, Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;http://celweb.vuse.vanderbilt.edu/aamas18/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==

Besides the main program that consists of a main track, an industry and applications track, and a couple of special area tracks, AAMAS also hosts over 20 workshops (e.g., AOSE, COIN, DALT, ProMAS, to mention a few) and many tutorials. There is also a demonstration session and a doctoral symposium. Finally, each year AAMAS features a bunch of awards, most notably the IFAAMAS Influential Paper Award. It publishes [[proceedings]] which are available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dl.acm.org/event.cfm?id=RE146&amp;tab=pubs&amp;CFID=81044068&amp;CFTOKEN=86050602 |title=Event: AAMAS | publisher=[[ACM Digital Library#Digital Library|ACM Digital Library]] |accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Language pedagogy'''{{definition needed|date=March 2017}} may take place as a general school subject, in a specialized [[language school]], or out of school with a rich selection of [[Language pedagogy#Proprietary methods|proprietary methods]] online and in books, CDs and DVDs. There are many methods of teaching languages. Some have fallen into relative obscurity and others are widely used; still others have a small following, but offer useful insights.

There are '''three principal views''':
# The '''structural''' view treats language as a system of structurally related elements to code meaning (e.g. grammar).
# The '''functional''' view sees language as a vehicle to express or accomplish a certain function, such as requesting something.
# The '''interactive''' view sees language as a vehicle for the creation and maintenance of social relations, focusing on patterns of moves, acts, negotiation and interaction found in conversational exchanges. This view has been fairly dominant since the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Richards"&gt;{{cite book |title=Approaches and Methods in Language Teaching |last=Richards|first=Jack C. |authorlink= |author2=Theodore S. Rodgers |year=2001|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge UK |isbn=0-521-00843-3 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodology ==
In the late 1800s and most of the 1900s,&lt;ref name=Anthony1963 /&gt; language teaching was usually conceived in terms of ''method''. In seeking to improve teaching practices, teachers and researchers would typically try to find out which method was the most effective.{{sfn|Hall|2011|p=57}} However, ''method'' is an ambiguous concept in language teaching, and has been used in many different ways. According to Bell, this variety in use "offers a challenge for anyone wishing to enter into the analysis or deconstruction of methods".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bell|2003|p=326}}, cited in {{harvnb|Hall|2011|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Approach'', ''method'' and ''technique'' ==

In 1963, University of Michigan Linguistics Professor Edward Mason Anthony Jr. formulated a framework to describe various language teaching methods, which consisted of three levels: ''approach'', ''method'', and ''technique''.{{sfn|Richards|Rodgers|2001|p=19}} According to Anthony, "The arrangement is hierarchical. The organizational key is that techniques carry out a method which is consistent with an approach."&lt;ref name="Anthony1963"&gt;{{Harvnb|Anthony|1963|pp=63–67}}, cited in {{Harvnb|Richards|Rogers|2001|p=19}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His concept of ''approach'' was of a set of principles or ideas about the nature of language learning which would be consistent over time; "an approach is axiomatic".&lt;ref name="Anthony1963" /&gt; His ''method'' was more procedural; "an overall plan for the orderly presentation of language material, no part of which contradicts, and all of which is based upon, the selected approach."&lt;ref name="Anthony1963" /&gt; Finally, his concept of ''technique'' referred to the actual implementation in the language classroom; "a particular trick, stratagem, or contrivance used to accomplish an immediate objective."&lt;ref name="Anthony1963" /&gt; He saw techniques as being consistent with a given method and by extension, with a given approach.{{sfn|Richards|Rodgers|2001|p=19}}

A method is a plan for presenting the language material to be learned and should be based upon a selected approach.  In order for an approach to be translated into a method, an instructional system must be designed considering the objectives of the teaching/learning, how the content is to be selected and organized, the types of tasks to be performed, the roles of students and the roles of teachers. A technique is a very specific, concrete stratagem or trick designed to accomplish an immediate objective.  Such are derived from the controlling method, and less-directly, with the approach.&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt;

Anthony's framework was welcomed by the language teaching community when it was introduced, and it was seen as a useful way of classifying different teaching practices.{{sfn|Kumaravadivelu|2006|p=85}} However, it did not clearly define the difference between ''approach'', ''method'', and ''technique'', and Kumaravadivelu reports that due to this ambiguity there was "widespread dissatisfaction" with it.{{sfn|Kumaravadivelu|2006|p=85}} Anthony himself recognized the limitations of his framework, and was open to the idea of improvements being made to it.{{sfn|Kumaravadivelu|2006|p=85}}

Richards and Rogers' 1982 approach expanded on Anthony's three-level framework; however, instead of ''approach'', ''method'' and ''technique'', they chose the terms ''approach'', ''design'', and ''procedure''.{{sfn|Johnson|Johnson|1999}} Their concept of ''approach'' was similar to Anthony's, but their ''design'' and ''procedure'' were of broader scope than Anthony's ''method'' and ''technique''.{{sfn|Johnson|Johnson|1999}} Their ''design'' referred to all major practical implications in the classroom, such as syllabus design, types of activities to be used in the classroom, and student and teacher roles; ''procedure'' referred to different behaviors, practices and techniques observed in the classroom.{{sfn|Johnson|Johnson|1999}} These new terms were intended to address limitations in Anthony's framework,{{sfn|Kumaravadivelu|2006|p=86}} and also gave them specific criteria by which they could evaluate different "methods".{{sfn|Kumaravadivelu|2006|p=88}} This evaluation process was a key way that their formulation differed from Anthony's, as Anthony's framework was intended as purely descriptive.{{sfn|Kumaravadivelu|2006|p=88}}

Despite Richards and Rogers' efforts to clearly define ''approach'', ''design'', and ''procedure'', their framework has been criticized by Kumaravadivelu for having "an element of artificiality in its conception and an element of subjectivity in its operation".{{sfn|Kumaravadivelu|2006|p=87}} Kumaravadivelu also points to similar objections raised by Pennyworth and by the ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Language Teaching and Learning''.{{sfn|Kumaravadivelu|2006|p=87}} Brown also questions the suitability of Richards and Rogers' term ''design''; he points out that in English teaching ''design'' is usually used to refer specifically to curriculum design, rather than the broad definition Richards and Rogers used.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|2001}}, cited in {{harvnb|Hall|2011|p=77}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Most current teacher training manuals favor the terms ''approach'', ''method'', and ''technique''.{{sfn|Hall|2011|p=77}}

== Structural methods ==

=== Grammar–translation method ===
{{main article|Grammar–translation method}}
The grammar translation method instructs students in [[grammar]], and provides [[vocabulary]] with direct translations to [[memory|memorize]]. It was the predominant method in Europe in the 19th century. Most instructors now acknowledge that this method is ineffective by itself.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} It is now most commonly used in the traditional instruction of the [[classical languages]], however it remains the most commonly practiced method of English teaching in Japan.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

At school, the teaching of grammar consists of a process of training in the rules of a language which must make it possible for all the students to correctly express their opinion, to understand the remarks which are addressed to them and to analyze the texts which they read.
The objective is that by the time they leave college, the pupil controls the tools of the language which are the vocabulary, grammar and the [[orthography]], to be able to read, understand and write texts in various contexts. The teaching of grammar examines texts, and develops awareness that language constitutes a system which can be analyzed.
This knowledge is acquired gradually, by traversing the facts of language and the syntactic mechanisms, going from simplest to the most complex. The exercises according to the program of the course must untiringly be practiced to allow the assimilation of the rules stated in the course.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} That supposes that the teacher corrects the exercises. The pupil can follow his progress in practicing the language by comparing his results.
Thus can he adapt the grammatical rules and control little by little the internal logic of the syntactic system. The grammatical analysis of [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s constitutes the objective of the teaching of grammar at the school. Its practice makes it possible to recognize a [[text (literary theory)|text]] as a coherent whole and conditions the training of a foreign language.
Grammatical terminology serves this objective.  Grammar makes it possible for each pupil to understand how his mother tongue functions, in order to give him the capacity to communicate his thought.

=== Audio-lingual method ===
{{Main article|Audio-lingual method}}
The audio-lingual method was developed in the United States around [[World War II]] when governments realized that they needed more people who could conduct conversations fluently in a variety of languages, work as interpreters, code-room assistants, and translators. However, since foreign language instruction in that country was heavily focused on reading instruction, no textbooks, other materials or courses existed at the time, so new methods and materials had to be devised. For example, the U.S. Army Specialized Training Program created intensive programs based on the techniques [[Leonard Bloomfield]] and other linguists devised for Native American languages, where students interacted intensively with native speakers and a linguist in guided conversations designed to decode its basic grammar and learn the vocabulary. This "[[Informant (linguistics)|informant method]]" had great success with its small class sizes and motivated learners.&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt;

The U.S. Army Specialized Training Program only lasted a few years, but it gained a lot of attention from the popular press and the academic community.  [[Charles C. Fries]] set up the first English Language Institute at the [[University of Michigan]], to train English as a second or foreign language teachers.  Similar programs were created later at [[Georgetown University]], [[University of Texas]] among others based on the methods and techniques used by the military.  The developing method had much in common with the British oral approach although the two developed independently. The main difference was the developing audio-lingual methods allegiance to structural linguistics, focusing on grammar and contrastive analysis to find differences between the student's native language and the target language in order to prepare specific materials to address potential problems. These materials strongly emphasized drill as a way to avoid or eliminate these problems.&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt;

This first version of the method was originally called the oral method, the aural-oral method or the structural approach. The audio-lingual method truly began to take shape near the end of the 1950s, this time due government pressure resulting from the [[space race]].  Courses and techniques were redesigned to add insights from [[behaviorist psychology]] to the structural linguistics and constructive analysis already being used. Under this method, students listen to or view recordings of language models acting in situations. Students practice with a variety of drills, and the instructor emphasizes the use of the [[Second language|target language]] at all times. The idea is that by reinforcing 'correct' behaviors, students will make them into habits.&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt;

The typical structure of a chapter employing the Audio-Lingual-Method (ALM—and there was even a text book entitled '''ALM''' [1963]) was usually standardized as follows: 1. First item was a dialog in the foreign language (FL) to be memorized by the student. The teacher would go over it the day before. 2. There were then questions in the FL about the dialog to be answered by the student(s) in the target language. 3. Often a brief introduction to the grammar of the chapter was next, including the verb(s) and conjugations. 4. The mainstay of the chapter was "pattern practice," which were drills expecting "automatic" responses from the student(s) as a noun, verb conjugation, or agreeing adjective was to be inserted in the blank in the text (or during the teacher's pause). The teacher could have the student use the book or not use it, relative to how homework was assigned. Depending on time, the class could respond as a chorus, or the teacher could pick individuals to respond. Julian Dakin, in 'The Language Laboratory and Language Learning' (Longman 1973), coined the phrase 'meaningless drills' to describe this kind of pattern practice, which others have also described as "mimicry-memorization." 5. There was a vocabulary list, sometimes with translations to the mother tongue.  6. The chapter usually ended with a short reading exercise.

Due to weaknesses in performance,&lt;ref&gt;[http://webh01.ua.ac.be/didascalia/mortality.htm Universiteit Antwerpen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090112010049/http://webh01.ua.ac.be/didascalia/mortality.htm |date=2009-01-12 }} James L. Barker lecture on November 8, 2001 at [[Brigham Young University]], given by Wilfried Decoo.&lt;/ref&gt; and more importantly because of [[Noam Chomsky]]'s theoretical attack on language learning as a set of habits, audio-lingual methods are rarely the primary method of instruction today. However, elements of the method still survive in many textbooks.&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt;

== Functional methods ==

=== The oral approach and situational language teaching ===
The oral approach was developed from the 1930s to the 1960s by British applied linguists such as Harold Palmer and A.S. Hornsby.  They were familiar with the direct method as well as the work of 19th-century applied linguists such as Otto Jespersen and Daniel Jones but attempted to formally develop a more scientifically founded approach to teaching English than was evidenced by the direct method.&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt;

A number of large-scale investigations about language learning and the increased emphasis on reading skills in the 1920s led to the notion of "vocabulary control". It was discovered that languages have a core basic vocabulary of about 2,000 words that occur frequently in written texts, and it was assumed that mastery of these would greatly aid reading comprehension. Parallel to this was the notion of "grammar control", emphasizing the sentence patterns most-commonly found in spoken conversation. Such patterns were incorporated into dictionaries and handbooks for students. The principal difference between the oral approach and the direct method was that methods devised under this approach would have theoretical principles guiding the selection of content, gradation of difficulty of exercises and the presentation of such material and exercises. The main proposed benefit was that such theoretically based organization of content would result in a less-confusing sequence of learning events with better contextualization of the vocabulary and grammatical patterns presented.&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt; Last but not least, all language points were to be presented in "situations".  Emphasis on this point led to the approach's second name. Proponents claim that this approach leads to students' acquiring good habits to be repeated in their corresponding situations. These teaching methods stress PPP:  presentation (introduction of new material in context), practice (a controlled practice phase) and production (activities designed for less-controlled practice).&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt;

Although this approach is all but unknown among language teachers today, elements of it have had long-lasting effects on language teaching, being the basis of many widely used English as a Second/Foreign Language textbooks as late as the 1980s and elements of it still appear in current texts.&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt; Many of the structural elements of this approach were called into question in the 1960s, causing modifications of this method that led to communicative language teaching. However, its emphasis on oral practice, grammar and sentence patterns still finds widespread support among language teachers and remains popular in countries where foreign language syllabuses are still heavily based on grammar.&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt;

=== Directed practice ===
Directed practice has students repeat phrases. This method is used by U.S. diplomatic courses. It can quickly provide a phrasebook-type knowledge of the language. Within these limits, the student's usage is accurate and precise. However the student's choice of what to say is not flexible.

== Interactive methods ==

[[File:Spanish class.jpg|thumb|right|[[High school (North America)|High School]] Spanish taught as a [[second language]] to a class of native [[English speakers]] at an American [[private school]] in [[Massachusetts]].]]

=== Direct method ===
{{Main article|Direct method (education)}}
The direct method, sometimes also called ''natural method'', is a method that refrains from using the learners' native language and just uses the target language. It was established in Germany and France around 1900 and is best represented by the methods devised by Berlitz and de Sauzé, although neither claims originality and it has been re-invented under other names.&lt;ref name="Diller"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Language Teaching Controversy |last=Diller |first=Karl Conrad |authorlink= |year=1978 |publisher=Newbury House |location=Rowley, Massachusetts |isbn=0883771144 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The direct method operates on the idea that second language learning must be an imitation of [[first language]] learning, as this is the natural way humans learn any language: a child never relies on another language to learn its first language, and thus the mother tongue is not necessary to learn a foreign language. This method places great stress on correct pronunciation and the target language from outset. It advocates teaching of oral skills at the expense of every traditional aim of language teaching. Such methods rely on directly representing an experience into a linguistic construct rather than relying on abstractions like mimicry, translation and memorizing grammar rules and vocabulary.&lt;ref name="Diller"/&gt;

According to this method, printed language and text must be kept away from second language learners for as long as possible, just as a first language learner does not use printed words until he has good grasp of speech. Learning of writing and spelling should be delayed until after the printed word has been introduced, and grammar and translation should also be avoided because this would involve the application of the learner's first language. All above items must be avoided because they hinder the acquisition of a good oral proficiency.

The method relies on a step-by-step progression based on question-and-answer sessions which begin with naming common objects such as doors, pencils, floors, etc. It provides a motivating start as the learner begins using a foreign language almost immediately. Lessons progress to verb forms and other grammatical structures with the goal of learning about thirty new words per lesson.&lt;ref name="Diller"/&gt;

=== The series method ===
{{tone|section|date=April 2018}}

In the 19th century, [[François Gouin]] went to [[Hamburg]] to learn [[German language|German]]. Based on his experience as a [[Latin]] teacher, he thought the best way to do this would be memorize a German grammar book and a table of its 248 irregular verbs. However, when he went to the academy to test his new language skills, he was disappointed to find out that he could not understand anything. Trying again, he similarly memorized the 800 root words of the language as well as re-memorizing the grammar and verb forms. However, the results were the same. During this time, he had isolated himself from people around him, so he tried to learn by listening, imitating and conversing with the Germans around him, but found that his carefully constructed sentences often caused native German speakers to laugh. Again he tried a more classical approach, translation, and even memorizing the entire dictionary but had no better luck.&lt;ref name="Diller"/&gt;

When he returned home, he found that his three-year-old nephew had learned to speak French. He noticed the boy was very curious and upon his first visit to a mill, he wanted to see everything and be told the name of everything.  After digesting the experience silently, he then reenacted his experiences in play, talking about what he learned to whoever would listen or to himself. Gouin decided that language learning was a matter of transforming perceptions into conceptions, using language to represent what one experiences. Language is not an arbitrary set of conventions but a way of thinking and representing the world to oneself. It is not a conditioning process, but one in which the learner actively organizes his perceptions into linguistics concepts.&lt;ref name="Diller"/&gt;

The series method is a variety of the direct method in that experiences are directly connected to the target language. Gouin felt that such direct "translation" of experience into words, makes for a "living language". (p59) Gouin also noticed that children organize concepts in succession of time, relating a sequence of concepts in the same order. Gouin suggested that students learn a language more quickly and retain it better if it is presented through a chronological sequence of events. Students learn sentences based on an action such as leaving a house in the order in which such would be performed. Gouin found that if the series of sentences are shuffled, their memorization becomes nearly impossible. For this, Gouin preceded psycholinguistic theory of the 20th century. He found that people will memorize events in a logical sequence, even if they are not presented in that order. He also discovered a second insight into memory called "incubation". Linguistic concepts take time to settle in the memory. The learner must use the new concepts frequently after presentation, either by thinking or by speaking, in order to master them. His last crucial observation was that language was learned in sentences with the verb as the most crucial component. Gouin would write a series in two columns: one with the complete sentences and the other with only the verb. With only the verb elements visible, he would have students recite the sequence of actions in full sentences of no more than twenty-five sentences. Another exercise involved having the teacher solicit a sequence of sentences by basically ask him/her what s/he would do next. While Gouin believed that language was rule-governed, he did not believe it should be explicitly taught.&lt;ref name="Diller"/&gt;

His course was organized on elements of human society and the natural world. He estimated that a language could be learned with 800 to 900 hours of instruction over a series of 4000 exercises and no homework. The idea was that each of the exercises would force the student to think about the vocabulary in terms of its relationship with the natural world. While there is evidence that the method can work extremely well, it has some serious flaws. One of which is the teaching of subjective language, where the students must make judgments about what is experienced in the world (e.g. "bad" and "good") as such do not relate easily to one single common experience. However, the real weakness is that the method is entirely based on one experience of a three-year-old. Gouin did not observe the child's earlier language development such as naming (where only nouns are learned) or the role that stories have in human language development. What distinguishes the series method from the direct method is that vocabulary must be learned by translation from the native language, at least in the beginning.&lt;ref name="Diller"/&gt;

=== Communicative language teaching ===
{{main article|Communicative language teaching}}
Communicative language teaching (CLT), also known as ''the Communicative Approach'', emphasizes interaction as both the means and the ultimate goal of learning a language. Despite a number of criticisms&lt;ref&gt;[http://tonvanhattum.com.br/comreth.html van Hattum, Ton (2006), The Communicative Approach Rethought]&lt;/ref&gt; it continues to be popular, particularly in Europe, where [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivist]] views on language learning and education in general dominate academic discourse. Although the 'Communicative Language Teaching' is not so much a method on its own as it is an approach.

In recent years, [[task-based language learning]] (TBLL), also known as task-based language teaching (TBLT) or task-based instruction (TBI), has grown steadily in popularity. TBLL is a further refinement of the CLT approach, emphasizing the successful completion of tasks as both the organizing feature and the basis for assessment of language instruction. Dogme language teaching shares a philosophy with TBL, although differs in approach.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;Meddings, L and Thornbury, S (2009) Teaching Unplugged: Dogme in English Language Teaching. Peaslake: Delta.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dogme is a communicative approach, and encourages teaching without published textbooks and instead focusing on conversational communication among the learners and the teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Meddings |last=Luke |title=Throw away your textbooks |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/mar/26/tefl.lukemeddings |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=26 March 2004 |accessdate = 22 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Language immersion ===
{{Main article|Language immersion}}
Language immersion in school contexts delivers academic content through the medium of a foreign language, providing support for L2 learning and first language maintenance.  There are three main types of immersion education programs in the United States: foreign language immersion, dual immersion, and indigenous immersion.

Foreign language immersion programs in the U.S. are designed for students whose home language is English. In the early immersion model, for all or part of the school day elementary school children receive their content (academic) instruction through the medium of another language: Spanish, French, German, Chinese, Japanese, etc.  In early total immersion models, children receive all the regular kindergarten and first grade content through the medium of the immersion language;&lt;ref name="Kho, Mu-Jeong 2016"&gt;Kho, Mu-Jeong (2016). How to Implant a Semiotic and Mathematical DNA into Learning English, Seoul: Booklab Publishing Co. {{ISBN|979-11-87300-04-5}} (53740), 261 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; English reading is introduced later, often in the second grade. Most content (math, science, social studies, art, music) continues to be taught through the immersion language. In early partial immersion models, part of the school day (usually 50%) delivers content through the immersion language, and part delivers it through English.  French-language immersion programs are common in Canada in the provincial school systems, as part of the drive towards [[bilingualism]] and are increasing in number in the United States in public school systems (Curtain &amp; Dahlbert, 2004). Branaman &amp; Rhodes (1998) report that between 1987 and 1997 the percentage of elementary programs offering foreign language education in the U.S. through immersion grew from 2% to 8% and Curtain &amp; Dahlberg (2004) report 278 foreign language immersion programs in 29 states. Research by Swain and others (Genesee 1987) demonstrate much higher levels of proficiency achieved by children in foreign language immersion programs than in traditional foreign language education elementary school models.

Dual immersion programs in the U.S. are designed for students whose home language is English as well as for students whose home language is the immersion language (usually Spanish).  The goal is bilingual students with mastery of both English and the immersion language. As in partial foreign language immersion academic content is delivered through the medium of the immersion language for part of the school day, and through English the rest of the school day.

Indigenous immersion programs in the U.S. are designed for American Indian communities desiring to maintain the use of the native language by delivering elementary school content through the medium of that language. Hawaiian Immersion programs are the largest and most successful in this category.

=== Silent Way ===
{{main article|Silent Way}}
The Silent Way is a discovery learning approach, invented by [[Caleb Gattegno]] in the late 1950s. The teacher is largely silent, giving more space for the students to explore the language.  Students are responsible for their own learning and are encouraged to express themselves; beginners talk about what they see, more advanced students talk about their lives and what they think.  The role of the teacher is not to model the language but to correct mistakes by giving sensitive feedback. With respect to teaching pronunciation, the Silent Way is a good example of the [[Articulatory approach for teaching pronunciation|Articulatory Approach]].

=== Community language learning ===
{{main article|Community language learning}}
The ''community language learning'' (CLL) is a method proposed by [[Charles A. Curran]] during the 1970s. It is based on the counseling approach in which the teacher is seen as a counselor. It emphasizes the sense of community in the learning group, encourages interaction as a vital aspect of learning, and it considers as a priority the students' feelings and the recognition of struggles in language acquisition. There is no syllabus or textbook to follow and it is the students themselves who determine the content of the lesson. Notably, it incorporates [[translation]] and recording techniques.

=== Suggestopedia ===
{{main article|Suggestopedia}}
Suggestopedia was a method that experienced popularity especially in past years, with both staunch supporters and very strong critics, some claiming it is based on [[pseudoscience]].

=== Natural approach ===
{{main article|Natural approach}}
The natural approach is a language teaching method developed by [[Stephen Krashen]] and [[Tracy D. Terrell]]. They emphasise the learner receiving large amounts of [[comprehensible input]]. The Natural Approach can be categorized as part of the [[comprehension approach]] to language teaching.

=== Total physical response ===
{{main article|Total physical response}}
In total physical response (TPR), the instructor gives the students commands in the target language and the students act those commands out using whole-body responses. This can be categorized as part of the [[comprehension approach]] to language teaching.

=== Teaching Proficiency through Reading and Storytelling ===
{{main article|Teaching Proficiency through Reading and Storytelling}}
Teaching Proficiency through Reading and Storytelling (TPR Storytelling or TPRS) was developed by Blaine Ray, a language teacher in California, in the 1990s. At first it was an offshoot of [[Total Physical Response]] that also included storytelling, but it has evolved into a method in its own right and has gained a large following among teachers, particularly in the United States. TPR Storytelling can be categorized as part of the [[comprehension approach]] to language teaching.

===Dogme language teaching===
{{Main article|Dogme language teaching}}
Dogme language teaching is considered to be both a methodology and a movement. Dogme is a communicative approach to language teaching and encourages teaching without published textbooks and instead focusing on conversational communication among the learners and the teacher. It has its roots in an article by the language education author, Scott Thornbury. The Dogme approach is also referred to as “Dogme ELT”, which reflects its origins in the ELT (English language teaching) sector. Although Dogme language teaching gained its name from an analogy with the Dogme 95 film movement (initiated by Lars von Trier), the connection is not considered close.

=== Growing Participator Approach ===
The [[Growing Participator Approach]] (GPA) is an alternative way of thinking about second language acquisition, developed by [https://growingparticipatorapproach.blogspot.com/ Greg Thomson]. GPA as an approach is usually implemented using Thomson's Six Phase Program (SPP) method, which involves 1,500 hours of special growth participation activities, supported by a local native language speaker, and targeted towards the learners growth zone ([[Zone of proximal development]]). The Six Phase Program utilises a number of techniques, such as TPR, to quickly grow the leaners comprehension ability without the use of English. The goal is to help learners continually 'grow' in their ability to meaningful 'participate' in the host culture. GPA influences include [[Lev Vygotsky|Vygotsky]], as well as "the psycholinguistics of comprehension and production, usage-based approaches to language, linguistic anthropology and discourse analysis."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://growingparticipatorapproach.blogspot.com/|title=Growing Participator Approach to a host world (An Alternative to "Second Language Acquisition")|website=growingparticipatorapproach.blogspot.com|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Proprietary methods==
Some methods are tied to a particular company or school, and are not used in mainstream teaching. Besides those mentioned below, there are dozens of competitors, each slightly different.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lang1234.com/ |title=Find better language courses: Impartial reviews of 70 self-study programs|publisher=globe1234.com |accessdate=2013-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable are the computer courses which use speech recognition to give feedback on pronunciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lang1234.info/3/category/scored/1.html/ |title=Scoring Your Pronunciation|publisher=globe1234.com |accessdate=2013-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pimsleur method===
Pimsleur language learning system is based on the research of and model programs developed by American language teacher [[Paul Pimsleur]]. It involves recorded 30-minute lessons to be done daily, with each lesson typically featuring a dialog, revision, and new material. Students are asked to translate phrases into the target language, and occasionally to respond in the target language to lines spoken in the target language. The instruction starts in the student's language but gradually changes to the target language. Several all-audio programs now exist to teach various languages using the Pimsleur Method. The syllabus is the same in all languages.

===Michel Thomas Method===
{{Main article|Michel Thomas Method}}
Michel Thomas Method is an audio-based teaching system developed by Michel Thomas, a language teacher in the USA. It was originally done in person, although since his death it is done via recorded lessons. The instruction is done entirely in the student's own language, although the student's responses are always expected to be in the target language. The method focuses on constructing long sentences with correct grammar and building student confidence. There is no listening practice, and there is no reading or writing. The syllabus is ordered around the easiest and most useful features of the language, and as such is different for each language.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Thomas: The Learning Revolution, by Jonathan Solity.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3014">'''Library and Archival Exhibitions on the Web''' is an international [[database]] of [[online exhibition]]s which is a service of the [[Smithsonian Institution Libraries]].
==Overview==
Two categories of online exhibitions are included in the database: exhibitions created by [[libraries]], [[archives]], [[historical societies]], and other scholarly institutions; and [[museum]] exhibitions with major emphasis on library and archival materials.

Several of these online exhibitions were originally created to accompany exhibitions physically situated at their respective institutions, but a growing percentage exist solely in [[Digital library|remotely accessible]] format. The database is searchable by title, subject, and sponsoring institution.

==History==
{{Ref improve section|date=July 2011}}
The website is based on an online guide to library exhibits on the web, created by Andrea Bean Hough in 1995. The guide was maintained by the [[University of Houston]] Libraries until it had grown to some 350 links in 1998–99 and staffing considerations made it necessary for the University to discontinue participation in the project. Since then, the guide has been curated by Diane Shaw, Special Collections Librarian at the [[Smithsonian Institution Libraries]]. As of 2011, it has grown to include over 6,000 links to online exhibitions.

==Recognition==
[[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries]], a publication of the [[Association of College and Research Libraries]], awarded ''Editor's Pick'' to the database in August 2010, saying it was "the most comprehensive source for existing digital exhibitions."&lt;ref&gt;''[http://library.utpb.edu/Choice-HiRecom.html Choice Highly Recommended Academic Web Sites]'', [[University of Texas of the Permian Basin]], The J. Conrad Dunagan Library Online. Retrieved September 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also listed under ''Best of the Web'' by [[New York Public Library]] and had previously been rewarded ''Site of the Month'' by ''LibrarySpot''.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.nypl.org/weblinks/2166 Best of the Web]'', [[New York Public Library]], USA. Retrieved August 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.libraryspot.com/lsom/1999/libsiteofmonth0799.htm Congratulations to Library and Archival Exhibitions on the Web]'', [http://www.libraryspot.com/ Library Spot].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3542">'''Low comedy''', in association to [[comedy]], is a dramatic or literary form of [[entertainment]] with no primary purpose but to create [[laughter]] by [[boasting]], boisterous jokes, [[drunkenness]], scolding, [[fighting]], [[buffoonery]] and other riotous activity.&lt;ref&gt;low comedy. (2013). In Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved from http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/349662/low-comedy&lt;/ref&gt; It is also characterized by "horseplay", [[slapstick]] or [[farce]]. Other examples include one throwing a custard pie into another's face. This definition has also expanded to include lewd types of comedy that rely on physical jokes, for example, the [[wedgie]].

== History ==
This type of comedy has been a fixture ever since Greek plays.  Low comedy was first denoted as comedy for the commoners because it was most often practiced by street performers.  Over time as low comedy began to include lewd jokes and more physical comedy, more mainstream performers began to practice this type of comedy: [[stand-up comedians]], [[musicals]], etc.  This type of comedy also was employed in most [[cartoons]].

== Society ==
Low comedy in [[society]] is quite well known; it can be found in a wide range of [[mass media|media]], such as [[television]] and [[theatre]]. It can also be found in public and occupations, such as clowns, mimes and comedians. The term ''low'' is represented in association to [[low culture]]. This form of comedy is targeted and understood towards people who attain non-academic high school education, meaning this form of comedy is not restricted to high levels of education and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;.  Gans, H. J. (1975). Popular culture and high culture; an analysis and evaluation of taste. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Low comedy is well known and popular today because it is considered suitable for all individuals. This form of comedy connects to popular culture by its easy to understand style. 

Low comedy, however, has lacked appreciation from most of society and is looked down upon in contrast to [[high comedy]]. The sole purpose of low comedy is to evoke laughter in people. Because there is no contextual message in most forms of low comedy, it is not highly respected. This does not undermine the fact that it is still an effective form of comedy for its reputation to cause laughter.&lt;ref&gt;By, B. A. (1934, Jan 21). Salute to low comedy. New York Times (1923-Current File). Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/101030559&lt;/ref&gt; 

The classification of things considered to be low comedy constantly changes over time. As society changes, so do the ideas about what high and low comedy are. For example, due to the overdoing of [[sitcoms]] in the past, it is now considered shrill, vulgar, low society where everyone talk-screeches in some sub-human, mock-sophisticated language of incessant insult.&lt;ref&gt;Roush, M. (1995, Oct 30). Low comedy of 'high society'. USA TODAY. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/408705508&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=April 2014}}  Today, low comedy can be seen in almost any production. Sitcoms often base most of the plot on this type of comedy because of society influencing productivity and considering it a low form of comedy. Modern adaptations of [[Shakespeare]]'s plays also use low comedy to convey a different understanding of the play.

'''''Luftfahrtforschungsanstalt''''' (Aeronautical Research Institute, '''LFA''', also known as the ''[[Hermann Göring]] Research Institute'')&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, John.  ''The Race for Hitler's X-Planes'' (The Mill, Gloucestershire:  History Press, 2013), p.43 caption.&lt;/ref&gt; was a secret [[Germany|German]] facility for [[airframe]], [[aircraft engine|aeroengine]], and aircraft weapons testing during the [[World War II|Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, pp.25-6, 40.&lt;/ref&gt; It was Germany's "most advanced and extensive [aviation] research establishment,&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, p.40.&lt;/ref&gt; outside of the existing ''Erprobungsstelle'' network of military aviation evaluation facilities, themselves headquartered at [[Rechlin-Lärz Airfield|Rechlin]].

Located near [[Völkenrode]], on the western outskirts of [[Braunschweig]] (Brunswick), near what became the [[Inner German Border]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, pp.25 and 40, and map p.26.&lt;/ref&gt; it was a {{convert|1000|acre|ha|sing=on}} site begun in October 1935. The first wind tunnel was begun in November 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, p.40.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the sixty buildings, scattered around the site, did not exceed treetop height, and all were well-[[camouflage]]d,&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, p.40.&lt;/ref&gt; to reduce the chance of them being detected by [[aerial reconnaissance]] and to avoid making them targets, as the wind tunnels of the ''[[Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Luftfahrt]]'' (''DVL'') in [[Adlershof]] (near [[Berlin]]) or the [[:de:Aerodynamische Versuchsanstalt|''Aerodynamische Versuchsanstalt'']] (''AVA'', part of today's [[German Aerospace Centre|DLR agency]]) at the [[University of Göttingen]] were.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, p.40.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The buildings were in five groups.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, p.40.&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute of Aerodynamics had five [[wind tunnel]]s, while the Institute of Gas Dynamics had its own high-speed tunnel; both were at the southern end of the campus.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, p.40.&lt;/ref&gt; The static testing station of the Institute of Strength Properties was to the west;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, pp.40-1.&lt;/ref&gt; the Institute of Engine Research, the east.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, p.41.&lt;/ref&gt; Weapons research was done by the Institute of Kinematics in a {{convert|400|m|ft|abbr=on|}}-long tunnel in the northwest corner.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, p.41.&lt;/ref&gt; These were accompanied by administration buildings, a [[Cafeteria|canteen]], a [[telephone exchange]], guard houses, generators, and other facilities.

To help reduce the risk of detection, there were no [[Rail transport|railway]] lines in, nor overhead power lines, nor any chimneys; and uniquely for an aviation research facility of its time in Germany, no runways, taxiways or hardstands for active aviation operations; just about all of the facilitiy's infrastructure needs were supplied underground from Braunschweig, including [[steam]] [[heating|heat]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, p.41.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addition, there were four hundred houses in Völkenrode for the 1,500 or so workers and scientists.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, p.41.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Each of the wind tunnels at ''LFA'' was given an "A" number. A1 had a circular nozzle {{convert|2.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}} in diameter, producing a maximum speed of {{convert|123|mph|km/h kn|abbr=on}}; it entered service in 1937, the year after construction began on facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, p.42.&lt;/ref&gt; A2 measured {{convert|4|m|ftin|abbr=on}} long and had a test section {{convert|2.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}} in diameter (coated with [[Keratylene]] to keep the flow smooth),&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, p.43.&lt;/ref&gt; capable of generating test speeds (depending on the model's [[Scale (ratio)|scale]]) of between [[Mach number|Mach]] 1 and 1.2.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, p.43.&lt;/ref&gt; It was driven by a pair of {{convert|600|kW|hp|abbr=on}} [[Direct current|DC]] [[electric motor|motor]]s, and fitted with [[Interferometry|interferometer]] and [[Turbulence|striation]] gear for study of flow patterns. Begun in 1937, it first ran in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, p.43.&lt;/ref&gt; It did, however, suffer with problems of vibration,&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, p.43.&lt;/ref&gt; leading the research teams to rely on a [[Rheinmetall|Rheinmetall-Börsig]] [[Feuerlilie#Feuerlilie F-25|F25]] free-flight research rocket with models mounted in the nose.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, p.44.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--TV doc on Avro Arrow says the Avro team did the same; can anybody confirm?--&gt; The A3 tunnel, largest at the ''LFA'' site, had an {{convert|8|m|ftin|abbr=on}} test section with a maximum speed of {{convert|95|m/s|mph kn|abbr=on}} and a working length of {{convert|11|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, enough to accommodate a [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]'s  fuselage.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, p.44.&lt;/ref&gt; It was powered by a pair of {{convert|6|MW|hp PS|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, p.44.&lt;/ref&gt;  The A9 building housed a pair of supersonic wind tunnels, each driven by a {{convert|4|MW|hp PS|abbr=on}} motor, with a maximum speed of Mach 1.5, but a test section diameter of only {{convert|80|cm2|in2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, p.47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with direct aerodynamic research, ''LFA'' did testing on materials (though not, apparently, of parts) and on aircraft engines.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, pp.52-3.&lt;/ref&gt; The engine work included testing of [[turbine]] and turbine blade shapes, [[ceramic]] turbine blades, cooling of turbine blades (including liquid cooling), bearings, [[Detonation#In engines and firearms|detonation]], and several types of [[heat exchanger]]s, among other things.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, p.53.&lt;/ref&gt;

The test centre assisted the [[BMW]] firm in developing the factory-produced forward [[cowling]] — which had the engine's [[oil cooler]] integrated into it from the beginning — for the Bavarian firm's [[BMW 801]] fourteen-cylinder radial engine used in many German Luftwaffe military aircraft, most importantly the [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190|Fw 190]]A;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, pp.47-8.&lt;/ref&gt; trials indicated it was possible to reduce drag enough to save {{convert|150|-|200|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, p.80.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to maximize pressure build-up to assist cooling.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, p.81.&lt;/ref&gt;  It also helped in development of the pioneering [[Argus As 014]] [[pulsejet]] used in the [[V-1 flying bomb|V-1]].  In collaboration with [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]] and ''DVL'' (Berlin-[[Adlershof]]), it also contributed to the development of the [[swept wing]] (what Germans called ''Pfeilflüge'', or "arrow wing").&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, pp.47-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the engine projects worked on at ''LFA'' was a [[Swing-piston engine|toroidal]] (swing-piston) design by [[Otto Lutz]] of [[Büssing]], a concept akin to the [[Wankel engine|Wankel]]; work was also done by [[Junkers]] and [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, p.85.&lt;/ref&gt;

''LFA'' remained so secret, the Allied air forces never bombed it.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, pp.42 and 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

Postwar, [[Fedden Mission|the site was visited]] by a [[Ministry of Aircraft Production]] team led by [[Roy Fedden]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''McLuhan Program in Culture and Technology''' started in 1963 as the '''Centre for Culture and Technology''', initially a card pinned to the door of [[Marshall McLuhan]]'s office in the English Department at the [[University of Toronto]]. It then had no organized program for research or teaching, but gained in prestige from the worldwide popularity of ''Understanding Media'' (1964) and grew in McLuhan's last decade in Toronto, assisted by [[Derrick de Kerckhove]] and McLuhan's son Eric, who became a director of the McLuhan Program International.&lt;ref&gt;http://projects.chass.utoronto.ca/mcluhan-studies/eric.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, the McLuhan Program became a part of the [[University of Toronto]]'s [[University of Toronto Faculty of Information|Faculty of Information]]. The program's curriculum is based on the works of [[Marshall McLuhan]] and other media theorists. In 2009, the Faculty of Information launched the [[University of Toronto Faculty of Information#Coach House Institute|Coach House Institute]] (CHI) as a clearly defined research unit under which the McLuhan Program in Culture and Technology now operates. In 2016 under Interim Director, Prof Seamus Ross, the Institute receive approval for its renaming as the McLuhan Centre for Culture and Technology in recognition of [[Marshall McLuhan]] intellectual contributions.  The McLuhan Program is now subsumed under this Centre.

Sarah Sharma, an Associate Professor of Media Theory from the Institute of Communication, Culture, Information and Technology (ICCIT) and the Faculty of Information (St. George), began a five year term as director. Professor Sharma's research and teaching focuses on feminist approaches to technology, including issues related to temporality and media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chi.utoronto.ca/prof-sarah-sharma-appointed-director-mcluhan-centre/|title=Prof. Sarah Sharma Appointed Director of McLuhan Centre - McLuhan Centre for Culture and Technology|date=2016-12-13|work=McLuhan Centre for Culture and Technology|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Sharma's thematic for the 2017-2018 Monday Night Seminars at the McLuhan Centre is MsUnderstanding Media which extends and introduces feminist approaches to technology to McLuhan's formulations of technology and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chi.utoronto.ca/msunderstanding-media-2/|title=Monday Night Seminars - McLuhan Centre for Culture and Technology|last=University of Toronto|first=|date=2017-07-19|work=McLuhan Centre for Culture and Technology|access-date=2017-11-14|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''meniscal cyst''' is a  well-defined [[cystic]] [[lesion]] located along the [[peripheral]] margin of the [[Meniscus (anatomy)|meniscus]], a part of the knee, nearly always associated with horizontal [[meniscal tears]].

==Signs and symptoms==
Pain and swelling or [[focal mass]] at the level of the joint. The pain may be related to a meniscal tear or distension of the knee capsule or both. The mass varies in consistency from soft/[[fluctuan]]t to hard. Size is variable, and meniscal cysts are known to change in size with knee flexion/extension.

==Cause==
Various [[etiology|etiologies]] have been proposed, including [[Physical trauma|trauma]], [[hemorrhage]], chronic [[infection]], and [[mucus|mucoid]] degeneration. The most widely accepted theory describes meniscal cysts resulting from extrusion of [[synovial fluid|synovial]] fluid through a peripherally extended horizontal meniscal tear, accumulating outside the joint capsule. They arise more commonly from the [[medial joint]] margin, and occur most often in 20- to 40-year-old males.

==Diagnosis==
[[Magnetic resonance imaging]] is the [[Medical imaging|modality]] of choice for diagnosis of meniscal cysts. In their most subtle form, meniscal cysts present as focal areas of high signal intensity within a swollen meniscus. It is not uncommon for [[radiologists]] to miss this type of meniscal cyst because the signal intensity is not quite as great as fluid on T2 weighted sequences.2 When this fluid is extruded into the adjacent soft tissues, the swollen meniscus subsequently assumes a more normal shape, and the extruded fluid demonstrates a higher T2 signal typical of [[parameniscal]] [[cysts]].

==Treatment==
Treatment of meniscal cysts consists of a combination of cyst decompression ([[intraarticular]] decompression versus open [[cystectomy]]) and [[arthroscopic]] repair of any meniscal abnormalities. Success rates are significantly higher when both the cyst and meniscal tear are treated compared to treating only one disease process.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15916">'''Methanogenesis''' or '''biomethanation''' is the formation of [[methane]] by [[microbe]]s known as [[methanogen]]s. Organisms capable of producing methane have been identified only from the [[Domain (biology)|domain]] [[Archaea]], a group [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetically]] distinct from both [[eukaryote]]s and [[bacteria]], although many live in close association with anaerobic bacteria. The production of methane is an important and widespread form of microbial [[metabolism]].

==Biochemistry==
[[File:Methanogenesis cycle.png|thumb|320px|Cycle for methanogenesis, showing intermediates.]]

Methanogenesis in microbes is a form of [[anaerobic respiration]].&lt;ref name=RT&gt;{{cite journal|author=Thauer, R. K.|title=Biochemistry of Methanogenesis: a Tribute to Marjory Stephenson|journal=Microbiology|year=1998|volume=144|pages=2377–2406|doi=10.1099/00221287-144-9-2377}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methanogens do not use oxygen to respire; in fact, oxygen inhibits the growth of methanogens.  The terminal [[Oxidizing agent#Electron acceptor|electron acceptor]] in methanogenesis is not oxygen, but carbon.  The carbon can occur in a small number of organic compounds, all with low molecular weights.  The two best described pathways involve the use of [[acetic acid]] or inorganic [[carbon dioxide]] as terminal electron acceptors:
:{{CO2|link=yes}} + 4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → [[Methane|CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

:CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH → CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

During anaerobic respiration of carbohydrates, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and acetate are formed in a ratio of 2:1 or lower, so H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; contributes only ca. 33% to methanogenesis, with acetate contributing the greater proportion. In some circumstances, for instance in the [[rumen]], where acetate is largely absorbed into the bloodstream of the host, the contribution of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to methanogenesis is greater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conrad|first=Rolf|date=1999|title=Contribution of hydrogen to methane production and control of hydrogen concentrations in methanogenic soils and sediments|url=http://femsec.oxfordjournals.org/content/28/3/193.abstract|journal=FEMS Microbiology Ecology|volume=28|pages=193–202|doi=10.1016/s0168-6496(98)00086-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, depending on pH and temperature, methanogenesis has been shown to use carbon from other small organic compounds, such as [[formic acid]] (formate), [[methanol]], [[methylamines]], [[tetramethylammonium]], [[dimethyl sulfide]], and [[methanethiol]].  The catabolism of the methyl compounds is mediated by methyl transferases to give methyl coenzyme M.&lt;ref name="RT" /&gt;

===Proposed mechanism===
The biochemistry of methanogenesis involves the following coenzymes and cofactors: [[Coenzyme F420|F420]], [[coenzyme B]], [[coenzyme M]], [[methanofuran]], and [[methanopterin]].

The mechanism for the conversion of {{chem|CH|3|–S}} bond into methane involves a ternary complex of methyl coenzyme M and coenzyme B fit into a channel terminated by the axial site on nickel of the cofactor F430.  One proposed mechanism invokes electron transfer from Ni(I) (to give Ni(II)), which initiates formation of {{chem|CH|4}}.  Coupling of the coenzyme M [[thiyl radical]] (RS&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;) with HS coenzyme B releases a proton and re-reduces Ni(II) by one-electron, regenerating Ni(I).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Finazzo C, Harmer J, Bauer C, etal |title=Coenzyme B induced coordination of coenzyme M via its thiol group to Ni(I) of F&lt;sub&gt;430&lt;/sub&gt; in active methyl-coenzyme M reductase |journal=J.

===Reverse methanogenesis===
Some organisms can oxidize methane, functionally reversing the process of methanogenesis, also referred to as the [[anaerobic oxidation of methane]] (AOM). Organisms performing AOM have been found in multiple marine and freshwater environments including methane seeps, hydrothermal vents, coastal sediments and sulfate-methane transition zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ruff|first=S.

===Importance in carbon cycle===
Methanogenesis is the final step in the decay of organic matter.  During the decay process, [[Oxidizing agent#Electron acceptor|electron acceptors]] (such as [[oxygen]], [[ferric]] [[iron]], [[sulfate]], and [[nitrate]]) become depleted, while [[hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[carbon dioxide]] accumulate.  Light organics produced by [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] also accumulate.  During advanced stages of organic decay, all electron acceptors become depleted except carbon dioxide.  Carbon dioxide is a product of most catabolic processes, so it is not depleted like other potential electron acceptors.

Only methanogenesis and fermentation can occur in the absence of electron acceptors other than carbon.  Fermentation only allows the breakdown of larger organic compounds, and produces small organic compounds.  Methanogenesis effectively removes the semi-final products of decay: hydrogen, small organics, and carbon dioxide.  Without methanogenesis, a great deal of carbon (in the form of fermentation products) would accumulate in anaerobic environments.

==Natural occurrence==

===In ruminants===
[[File:CSIRO ScienceImage 1898 Testing Sheep for Methane Production.jpg|thumb|Testing Australian sheep for exhaled methane production (2001), [[CSIRO]]]]
[[Enteric fermentation]] occurs in the gut of some animals, especially ruminants. In the [[rumen]], anaerobic organisms, including methanogens, digest cellulose into forms nutritious to the animal.  Without these microorganisms, animals such as cattle would not be able to consume grasses. The useful products of methanogenesis are absorbed by the gut, but methane is released from the animal mainly by belching (eructation). The average cow emits around 250 liters of methane per day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/ra/innovations/stories/s1159618.htm ''Radio Australia'': "Innovations – Methane In Agriculture."] 15 August  2004. Retrieved 28 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this way, ruminants contribute about 25% of anthropogenic [[methane emissions]]. One method of methane production control in ruminants is by feeding them [[3-Nitrooxypropanol|3-nitrooxypropanol]].&lt;ref&gt;Hristov, A. N., et al., "An inhibitor persistently decreased enteric methane emission from dairy cows with no negative effect on milk production", Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2015, volume 112, 10663-10668. {{DOI|10.1073/pnas.1504124112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In humans===
Some humans produce [[flatulence|flatus]] that contains methane.  In one study of the [[feces]] of nine adults, five of the samples contained [[archaea]] capable of producing methane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Miller TL|author2=Wolin MJ |author3=de Macario EC |author4=Macario AJ | title=Isolation of Methanobrevibacter smithii from human feces| journal=Appl Environ Microbiol| year=1982| volume=43| pages=227–32 |pmid=6798932 |pmc=241804 |doi= |url=http://aem.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=6798932| issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar results are found in samples of gas obtained from within the [[rectum]].

Even among humans whose flatus does contain methane, the amount is in the range of 10% or less of the total amount of gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===In plants===
Many experiments have suggested that [[leaf]] tissues of living plants emit methane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Kepler F, etal | title = ''Methane emissions from terrestrial plants under aerobic conditions'' | journal = Nature | year = 2006 | volume = 439 | issue = 7073 | pmid = 16407949| pages = 187&amp;ndash;191 | doi=  10.1038/nature04420 | bibcode=2006Natur.439..187K}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research has indicated that the plants are not actually generating methane; they are just absorbing methane from the soil and then emitting it through their leaf tissues.&lt;ref&gt;http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2009/114/1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soils===
Methanogens are observed in anoxic soil environments, contributing to the degradation of organic matter.  This organic matter may be placed by humans through landfill, buried as sediment on the bottom of lakes or oceans as sediments, and as residual organic matter from sediments that have formed into sedimentary rocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Le Mer, J.|author2=Roger, P.|title=Production, oxidation, Emission and Consumption of Methane by Soils: A Review|journal=European Journal of Soil Biology|year=2001|volume=37|pages=25–50|doi=10.1016/S1164-5563(01)01067-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in global warming==
[[Atmospheric methane]] is an important [[greenhouse gas]] with a [[global warming potential]] 25 times greater than carbon dioxide (averaged over 100 years),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/tssts-2-5.html |contribution=Global Warming Potentials |title=Contribution of Working Group I to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2007  |year=2007 |accessdate=2012-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and methanogenesis in [[livestock]] and the decay of organic material is thus a considerable contributor to global warming. It may not be a net contributor in the sense that it works on organic material which used up atmospheric carbon dioxide when it was created, but its overall effect is to convert the carbon dioxide into methane which is a much more potent greenhouse gas.

Methanogenesis can also be beneficially exploited, to treat [[organic waste]], to produce useful compounds, and the methane can be collected and used as [[biogas]], a fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2015-04-07/news/60902488_1_wet-waste-waste-management-household-waste|title=After Freedom Park, waste to light up Gandhinagar in Bengaluru
|last=Nair|first=Athira|work=Economic Times|date=July 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the primary pathway whereby most organic matter disposed of via [[landfill]] is broken down.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~ayoung/landfill.html DoE Report CWM039A+B/92] Young, A. (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extra-terrestrial life==
{{See also|Methane#Extraterrestrial methane}}
The presence of atmospheric methane has a role in the scientific search for [[extra-terrestrial life]]. The justification is that methane in the atmosphere will eventually dissipate, unless something is replenishing it. If methane is detected (by using a [[spectrometer]] for example) this may indicate that life is, or recently was, present.
This was debated&lt;ref&gt;BBC article about methane as sign of life http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4295475.stm&lt;/ref&gt; when methane was discovered in the Martian atmosphere by M.J. Mumma of NASA's Goddard Flight Center, and verified by the [[Mars Express Orbiter]] (2004)&lt;ref&gt;European Space Agency, Methane in Martian Atmosphere http://www.esa.int/esaMI/Mars_Express/SEMZ0B57ESD_0.html&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]'s atmosphere by the [[Huygens probe]] (2005).&lt;ref&gt;Space.Com article about methane on Huygens http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/ap_huygens_update_050127.html&lt;/ref&gt; This debate was furthered with the discovery of 'transient', 'spikes of methane' on Mars by the [[Curiosity Rover]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/space/11297326/Life-on-Mars-Nasa-finds-first-hint-of-alien-life.html&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also argued that [[atmospheric methane]] can come from volcanoes or other fissures in the planet's crust and that without an [[isotopic signature]], the origin or source may be difficult to identify.&lt;ref&gt;New Scientist article about atmospheric methane https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7059&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Geographic Article about methane as sign of life http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/10/1007_041007_mars_methane.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 April 2017, NASA confirmed that the dive of the [[Cassini–Huygens|Cassini orbiter]] spacecraft on 28 October 2015 discovered the [[Enceladus]] plume which has all the ingredients for methanogenesis-based life forms to feed from. Previous results, published in March 2015, suggested hot water is interacting with rock beneath the sea; the new findings support that conclusion and add that the rock appears to be reacting chemically. From these observations scientists have determined that nearly 98 percent of the gas in the plume is water, about 1 percent is hydrogen and the rest is a mixture of other molecules including carbon dioxide, methane and ammonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-missions-provide-new-insights-into-ocean-worlds-in-our-solar-system|title=NASA Missions Provide New Insights into 'Ocean Worlds'|last=Northon|first=Karen|date=2017-04-13|work=NASA|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11493">[[File:Microbial Loop.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The microbial loop is a marine trophic pathway which incorporates [[dissolved organic carbon]] into the food chain.]]
The '''microbial loop''' describes a trophic pathway in the marine microbial food web where [[dissolved organic carbon]] (DOC) is returned to higher trophic levels via its incorporation into bacterial biomass, and then coupled with the classic food chain formed by [[phytoplankton]]-[[zooplankton]]-[[nekton]]. The term microbial loop was coined by [[Farooq Azam]] and [[Tom Fenchel]] et al.&lt;ref name=AzamFenchel1983&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Azam |first1=Farooq |authorlink1=Farooq Azam |last2=Fenchel |first2=Tom |authorlink2=Tom Fenchel |last3=Field |first3=JG |last4=Gray |first4=JS |last5=Meyer-Reil |first5=LA |last6=Thingstad |first6=F |title=The Ecological Role of Water-Column Microbes in the Sea |journal=Marine Ecology Progress Series |volume=10 |year=1983 |pages=257–263 |doi=10.3354/meps010257}}&lt;/ref&gt; to include the role played by bacteria in the carbon and nutrient cycles of the marine environment.

In general, [[dissolved organic carbon]] (DOC) is introduced into the ocean environment from bacterial lysis, the leakage or exudation of fixed carbon from phytoplankton (e.g., mucilaginous exopolymer from [[diatom]]s), sudden cell senescence, sloppy feeding by zooplankton, the excretion of waste products by aquatic animals, or the breakdown or dissolution of organic particles from terrestrial plants and soils (Van den Meersche ''et al.'' 2004). Bacteria in the microbial loop decompose this particulate detritus to utilize this energy-rich matter for growth. Since more than 95% of organic matter in marine ecosystems consists of polymeric, high [[molecular weight]] (HMW) compounds (e.g., protein, polysaccharides, lipids), only a small portion of total [[dissolved organic matter]] (DOM) is readily utilizable to most marine organisms at higher trophic levels. This means that dissolved organic carbon is not available directly to most marine organisms; marine bacteria introduce this organic carbon into the food web, resulting in additional energy becoming available to higher trophic levels. Recently the term "[[microbial food web]]" has been substituted for the term "microbial loop".

== History ==
Prior to the discovery of the microbial loop, the classic view of marine [[food web]]s was one of a linear chain from [[phytoplankton]] to [[nekton]]. Generally, marine [[bacteria]] were not thought to be significant consumers of organic matter (including carbon), although they were known to exist. However, the view of a marine pelagic food web was challenged during the 1970s and 1980s by Pomeroy and Azam, who suggested the alternative pathway of carbon flow from bacteria to [[protozoan]]s to [[metazoan]]s.

Early work in marine ecology that investigated the role of bacteria in oceanic environments concluded their role to be very minimal. Traditional methods of counting bacteria (e.g., culturing on [[agar plate]]s) only yielded small numbers of bacteria that were much smaller than their true ambient abundance in seawater. Developments in technology for counting bacteria have led to an understanding of the significant importance of marine bacteria in oceanic environments

In the 1970s, the alternative technique of direct [[Bacterioplankton counting methods|microscopic counting]] was developed by Francisco ''et al.'' (1973) and Hobbie ''et al.'' (1977). Bacterial cells were counted with an [[epifluorescence microscope]], producing what is called an 
"acridine orange direct count" (AODC). This led to a reassessment of the large concentration of bacteria in seawater, which was found to be more than was expected (typically on the order of 1 million per milliliter). Also, development of the "bacterial productivity assay" showed that a large fraction (i.e. 50%) of net [[primary production]] (NPP) was processed by marine bacteria.

In 1974, Larry Pomeroy published a paper in BioScience entitled “The Ocean’s Food Web: A Changing Paradigm”, where the key role of microbes in ocean productivity was highlighted. In the early 1980s, Azam and a panel of top ocean scientists published the synthesis of their discussion in the journal ''Marine Ecology Progress Series'' entitled “The Ecological Role of Water Column Microbes in the Sea”. The term ‘microbial loop’ was introduced in this paper, which noted that the bacteria-consuming protists were in the same size class as phytoplankton and likely an important component of the diet of planktonic [[crustacean]]s.

Evidence accumulated since this time has indicated that some of these [[bacterivore|bacterivorous]] protists (such as [[ciliate]]s) are actually selectively preyed upon by these [[copepod]]s. In 1986, ''[[Prochlorococcus]]'', which is found in high abundance in oligotrophic areas of the ocean, was discovered by Chisholm, Olson, and other collaborators (although there had been several earlier records of very small [[cyanobacteria]] containing [[chlorophyll b]] in the ocean). Stemming from this discovery, researchers observed the changing role of marine bacteria along a nutrient gradient from eutrophic to oligotrophic areas in the ocean.

== Factors controlling the microbial loop ==
The efficiency of the microbial loop is determined by the density of marine bacteria within it (Taylor and Joint 1990). It has become clear that bacterial density is mainly controlled by the grazing activity of small protozoans and various taxonomic groups of flagellates. Also, viral infection causes bacterial lysis, which release cell contents back into the [[dissolved organic matter]] (DOM) pool, lowering the overall efficiency of the microbial loop. Mortality from viral infection has almost the same magnitude as that from protozoan grazing. However, compared to protozoan grazing, the effect of viral lysis can be very different because lysis is highly host-specific to each marine bacteria. Both protozoan grazing and viral infection balance the major fraction of bacterial growth. In addition, the microbial loop dominates in oligotrophic waters, rather than in eutrophic areas - there the classical plankton food chain predominates, due to the frequent fresh supply of mineral nutrients (e.g. spring bloom in temperate waters, [[upwelling]] areas). The magnitude of the efficiency of the microbial loop can be determined by measuring bacterial incorporation of radiolabeled substrates (such as [[tritium|tritiated]] thymidine or leucine).

== Importance in marine ecosystems ==
The microbial loop is of particular importance in increasing the efficiency of the marine food web via the utilization of dissolved organic matter (DOM), which is typically unavailable to most marine organisms. In this sense, the process aids in recycling of organic matter and nutrients and mediates the transfer of energy above the [[thermocline]]. More than 30% of [[dissolved organic carbon]] (DOC) incorporated into bacteria is respired and released as [[carbon dioxide]]. The other main effect of the microbial loop in the water column is that it accelerates [[Mineralization (biology)|mineralization]] through regenerating production in nutrient-limited environments (e.g. oligotrophic waters). In general, the entire microbial loop is to some extent typically five to ten times the mass of all multicellular marine organisms in the marine ecosystem. Marine bacteria are the base of the food web in most oceanic environments, and they improve the trophic efficiency of both marine food webs and important aquatic processes (such as the productivity of fisheries and the amount of carbon exported to the ocean floor). Therefore, the microbial loop, together with primary production, controls the productivity of marine systems in the ocean.

Many planktonic bacteria are motile, using a flagellum to propagate, and [[chemotaxis|chemotax]] to locate, move toward, and attach to a point source of [[dissolved organic matter]] (DOM) where fast growing cells digest all or part of the particle. Accumulation within just a few minutes at such patches is directly observable. Therefore, the water column can be considered to some extent as a spatially organized place on a small scale rather than a completely mixed system. This patch formation affects the biologically-mediated transfer of matter and energy in the microbial loop.

More currently, the microbial loop is considered to be more extended (Kerner, Hohenberg, Ertl, Reckermannk, Spitzy 2003). Chemical compounds in typical bacteria (such as DNA, lipids, sugars, etc.) and similar values of C:N ratios per particle are found in the microparticles formed abiotically. Microparticles are a potentially attractive food source to bacterivorous plankton. If this is the case, the microbial loop can be extended by the pathway of direct transfer of [[dissolved organic matter]] (DOM) via abiotic microparticle formation to higher trophic levels. This has ecological importance in two ways. First, it occurs without carbon loss, and makes organic matter more efficiently available to phagotrophic organisms, rather than only heterotrophic bacteria. Furthermore, abiotic transformation in the extended microbial loop depends only on temperature and the capacity of DOM to aggregate, while biotic transformation is dependent on its biological availability (Kerner, Hohenberg, Ertl, Reckermannk, Spitzy 2003).

The main research focus of the program is [[climate change]], the stated goals being to:

*Investigate climate variability in [[Queen Maud Land|Dronning Maud Land]] of East Antarctica on time scales of years to a thousand years.
*Establish spatial and temporal variability in snow accumulation over this area of Antarctica to understand its impact on sea level.
*Investigate the impact of atmospheric and oceanic variability on the chemical composition of firn and ice in the region.
*Revisit areas and sites first explored by traverses in the 1960s, for detection of possible changes and to establish benchmark data sets for future research efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://traverse.npolar.no|title=Introduction - Norwegian-U.S. Scientific Traverse of East Antarctica|accessdate=2007-12-31|author=|last=|first=|authorlink=|date=|year=|format=|work=|publisher=|pages=|language=|doi=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program is part of Trans-Antarctic Scientific Traverse Expeditions – Ice Divide of East Antarctica (TASTE-IDEA), and the International Partners in Ice Coring Sciences (IPICS), both of which have [[International Council for Science|ISCU]]-[[World Meteorological Organization|WMO]] endorsement for the [[International Polar Year]] 2007-2009.

The '''Partnership for Peace Consortium''' is a network of over 800 defense academies and security studies institutes across 60 countries.  Founded in 1998 during the NATO Summit, the PfPC was chartered to promote defense institution building and foster regional stability through multinational education and research, which the PfPC accomplishes via a network of educators and researchers. It is based at the [[George C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies]] in [[Garmisch]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pfp-consortium.org Partnership for Peace Consortium (PfPC)]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the PfPC Annual Report of 2012,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pfpconsortium.com/#!annual-reports/cror Annual Report of 2012] Free download&lt;/ref&gt; in 2012 eight hundred defense academies and security studies institutes in 59 countries worked with the PfPC in 69 defense education/defense institution building and policy-relevant events. The Consortium publishes an academic quarterly journal ''CONNECTIONS''&lt;ref&gt;[http://connections-qj.org/ Quarterly Journal ''[[Connections (journal)|CONNECTIONS]]'']&lt;/ref&gt; in English and Russian. The journal is run by an international Editorial Board of experts and is distributed to over 1,000 institutions in 54 countries.

==Background==
The PfPC was founded in 1998 in response to the speech by United States Secretary of Defense [[William Cohen]],  "Toward a Cooperative Security Network for the 21st Century".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/101726374/TOWARD-A-COOPERATIVE-SECURITY-NETWORK-FOR-THE-21ST-CENTURY Toward a Cooperative Security Network for the 21st Century]&lt;/ref&gt; The speech was delivered during the 12 June 1998 meeting of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC) defense ministers and similar sentiments were echoed in the concluding documents of the NATO and EAPC Summits on 24 and 25 April 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nato.int/docu/pr/1999/p99-064e.htm NATO Summit 24-25 April, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt; The PfPC was originally co-sponsored by the United States and Germany to work in the spirit of the [[Partnership for Peace]] Program "to strengthen defense and military education through enhanced national and institutional cooperation."  Since its founding, the PfPC’s sponsorship has expanded, with contributions from numerous partner states and organizations.  In the Canadian House of Commons in 2017, the PfPC's long contribution "in promoting stability, security, and democracy" was [https://openparliament.ca/debates/2017/12/7/wayne-easter-1/ noted] by the Honorable [[Wayne Easter]], Liberal MP for Malpeque.  

Upon its establishment, the PfPC was chartered with the following objectives:
*Strengthen defense, military, and security policy education through enhanced national and institutional cooperation
*Strengthen civilian and military leadership capabilities in national security and strategic-level military planning
*Enhance multinational education through collaborative approaches linking defense practitioners, scholars, researchers, and experts into activity-based networks that facilitate the sharing of knowledge
*Extend the scope of educational cooperation throughout the Euro-Atlantic region to include not only governmental defense academies and security studies institutes, but also other governmental, non-governmental, and private organizations whether they are institutes, agencies or universities
*Increase the scope of the multinational research on critical issues confronting partner nations{{cn|date=April 2017}}

==Organization==
The PfPC is governed by a Senior Advisory Council (SAC), with high level government representatives from [[Austria]], [[Canada]], [[Germany]], [[NATO]] International Staff, [[Poland]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], [[United States]].  SAC members can be permanent or rotational depending on the interests of the contributing state or organization. The most recent SAC additions are Poland&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.aon.edu.pl/en/cooperation/foreign Poland on Senior Advisory Council (SAC)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218111601/http://www.adl.aon.edu.pl/en/cooperation/foreign |date=2014-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marshallcenter.org/mcpublicweb/nav-main-wwd-res-courses-pass-en/62-cat-english-en/cat-gcmc-pao-en/cat-gcmc-pao-news-en/1552-art-pao-news-10-31-14-en.html Sweden on Senior Advisory Council (SAC)]&lt;/ref&gt; The SAC meets annually to review the PfPC's activities, providing guidance to ensure activities match the PfPC's founding principles.

The PfPC organizes its activities through Working Groups and Study Groups, which address relevant topics in international security and related fields.  In total there are nine groups, each with a Chair, Co-Chair, and Technical Advisors, who contribute to the groups' activities voluntarily or otherwise.  The Chairs and Co-Chairs comprise the PfPC's Consortium Steering Committee (CSC).  The CSC meets annually to provide updates on their activities and to determine future activities, ensuring activities are aligned with SAC directions.

==Activity Groups==
Over 90 PfPC events per year across the US, Europe and Central Asia provide the activity groups with a forum for debate and exchange of ideas on contemporary security topics.  Such forums are designed to identify and facilitate options for nonviolent resolution to international differences, and to further defense education transformation goals in recipient countries.  The groups benefit from a multinational, multidisciplinary network of experts across defense, academia, industry, and civil society.

===Working Groups===

====[[Advanced Distributed Learning]]====
The Advanced Distributed Learning Working Group’s&lt;ref&gt;Synytsya, K., et al. "Learning on demand. ADL and the Future of e-Learning. Advanced Distributed Learning Initiative." (2010): 295-303.&lt;/ref&gt; mission is to strengthen e-learning-based defense and security policy education through international and institutional collaboration. The activities include the creation and sharing of interactive, widely needed e-learning courseware; providing access to interoperable, open-source e-learning technologies; and the exchange and dissemination of ADL-based best practices. A strategic goal is to contribute to the Defense Education Enhancement Program (DEEP) and integrate interested Partner nations into the ADL community of practice. The Advanced Distributed Learning  Working Group coordinates and standardizes training and promotes innovation.

====Education Development====
The Education Development Working Group (EDWG) is designed to strengthen defense education in partner nations and consists of two core components:
*Reference Curriculum
*Faculty Development 
These two core components are facilitated by the multinational staffed Defense Education Enhancement Program (DEEP),.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/news_90086.htm Defense Education Enhancement Program (DEEP)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_112964.htm?mode=pressrelease NATO Wales Summit Declaration  - see Paragraph 81 on Defense Education Enhancement Program (DEEP)]&lt;/ref&gt; DEEP is central to EDWG activities, supporting foreign government defense learning institution efforts to: (1) enhance the quality and relevance of curriculum and to (2) promote faculty development and modern learning techniques within a framework of individually tailored multi-year action plans. As of December 2014, DEEP programs were underway in 13 nations: Afghanistan,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/news_114115.htm?selectedLocale=en Defense Education Enhancement Program (DEEP) in Afghanistan]&lt;/ref&gt; Armenia, Azerbaijan, Croatia, Georgia,&lt;ref&gt;[http://georgia.usembassy.gov/news-events/emb_news2014t/21102014gori.html Defense Education Enhancement Program (DEEP) in Georgia]&lt;/ref&gt; Iraq, Kazakhstan, Mauritania, Moldova, Mongolia, Serbia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan.

====Emerging Security Challenges====
The Emerging Security Challenges (ESC) Working Group aims to enhance the capacity of decision makers and policy shapers to identify and respond to emerging security challenges. Specifically, its goal is to identify and prioritize such challenges and discuss possible political frameworks and mechanisms to address them. “Emerging Security Challenges” has become a term used at NATO and in public debate to deal with potential, upcoming, non-traditional threats to our security. The working group does not have a defined set of issues for analysis - rather, it remains open to include new challenges as they arise.  Along with the EDWG, the Emerging Security Challenges working group under the leadership of [https://www.linkedin.com/in/seancostigan/ Sean Costigan]([[George C. Marshall Center for European Security Studies]]) and Michael Hennessy ([[Royal Military College of Canada]]) led the creation of the NATO/PFPC Cybersecurity Generic Reference Curriculum. The curriculum was endorsed by the [[Supreme Allied Commander Transformation|NATO Supreme Allied Commander Transformation]], and is currently available in four languages: [http://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/pdf_2016_10/1610-cybersecurity-curriculum.pdf English], [http://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/pdf_2016_10/20170719_1610-cybersecurity-curriculum-fr.pdf French], [http://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/pdf_2016_10/20170908_1610-cybersecurity-curriculum-ar.pdf Arabic] and [http://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/pdf_2016_10/20171004_1610-cybersecurity-curriculum-rus.pdf Russian].

====[[Security Sector Reform]]====
The Security Sector Reform Working Group (SSRWG) was formally established in 2001 and is financially supported by the Swiss [[Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sport]]. Its stated objectives are “to enhance the exchange of ideas, insights, expertise, knowledge and best practices of security sector reform processes between consolidating and consolidated democracies in the Euro-Atlantic area”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pfp-consortium.org/index.php/activities/security-sector-reform Partnership for Peace Consortium, "Security Sector Reform Working Group Factsheet" (2014).]&lt;/ref&gt; From 2010, the group began to focus more on [[human security]] issues and has taken a particular interest in how to improve [[gender equality]] through defence transformation. This led the group to identify teaching gender to the military as an area that warranted greater attention, resulting in a series of workshops organised in collaboration with the EDWG, starting in 2012. These have been attended by representatives from NATO and Partner countries specialising in military education, gender education and integrating gender in military operations. The SSRWG’s current activities are centred on the development of a handbook to document the findings of the workshop series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dcaf.ch/Event/Authors-Workshop-Teaching-Gender-to-the-Military-Manual DCAF, Event: Authors’ Workshop: Teaching Gender to the Military Manual, 17 Dec 2014 - 19 Dec 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Study Groups===

====Regional Security in Southeast Europe====
The Regional Stability in Southeast Europe Study Group contributes to peace and security in Southeast Europe. Its working principles include the following:
*Evaluate the situation and factors in the South East European region that promote regional stability through enhanced international co-operation, especially with institutions located in or close to the region of interest
*Carry out strategic research on an academic level supplementary to and stimulating the practical work done in the region
*Provide support for the improvement of networks in the field of security policy and help create a peaceful, strategic and stable community in the Southeast Europe region compatible to the broader Partnership for Peace network and beyond

====Regional Security in the South Caucasus====
The PfPC's Regional Security in the [[Transcaucasia|South Caucasus]] Study Group actively seeks to foster stability in the region through facilitating dialogue among diverse parties. The activities of the group serve to advise broader conflict resolution activities, such as the Geneva Talks and the [[OSCE Minsk Group]]. The group pursues its goals by focusing on the following areas:
*Ensuring multinational participation, building on experts from all dimensions of the security-political spectrum of the three core countries Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia: This is paralleled by bringing in experts on regional stability issues from the main partner countries and institutions to the region, namely the European Union (Member States), the Russian Federation, Turkey, the United States, as well as NATO, the OSCE and the UN.
*Building a constructive network of academic and policy-making influence: This includes involving civil society, think-tanks and defense institutions in the group's work.
*Encouraging an alteration of the conflicting narrative in the region in order to progress conflict negotiation

==Products and Services==
Supported by the research and activities of the study/working groups, the PfPC offers the following services:
*Defense education curriculum development
*Education delivery methods (e.g. distributed computer-based learning)
*Foreign policy recommendation papers
*Information sharing, coordination of skills and assets

'''Postdevelopment theory''' (also '''post-development''' or '''anti-development''' or '''development criticism''') holds that the whole concept and practice of [[regional development|development]] is a reflection of Western-Northern hegemony over the rest of the world. Postdevelopment thought arose in the 1980s out of criticisms voiced against development projects and [[development theory]], which justified them.

==Development as ideology==
The postdevelopment critique holds that modern [[development theory]] is a creation of academia in tandem with an underlying political and economic ideology. The academic, political, and economic nature of development means it tends to be policy oriented, problem-driven, and therefore effective only in terms of and in relation to a particular, pre-existing social theory.

The actual development projects thus initiated, by both governments and NGOs, are directed in accordance with this development theory. Development theory itself, however, assumes a framework already set in place by government and political culture in order to implement it. The development process is therefore ''socially constructed''; Western interests are guiding its direction and outcome, and so development itself fundamentally reflects the pattern of Western hegemony.

Development as an ideology and a social vision is ingrained in the ideals of modernization, which holds western economic structure and society as a universal model for others to follow and emulate. Rooted in western influence, the developmental discourse reflects the unequal power relations between the west and the rest of the world, whereby the western knowledge of development, approach toward development, and conception of what development entails, as well as perceptions of progress, directs the course for the rest of the world.

==Reviewing development==
Influenced by [[Ivan Illich]] and other critics of colonialism and postcolonialism, a number of post-development theorists like [[Arturo Escobar (anthropologist)|Arturo Escobar]] and [[Gustavo Esteva]] have challenged the very meaning of development. According to them, the way we understand development is rooted in the earlier colonial discourse that depicts the North as "advanced" and "progressive", and the South as "backward", "degenerate" and "primitive".

They point out that a new way of thinking about development began in 1949 with President [[Harry Truman]]'s declaration: "The old imperialism—exploitation for foreign profit—has no place in our plans. What we envisage is a program of development based on the concepts of democratic fair dealings."
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Truman Inaugural Address, January 20, 1949|url=https://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/50yr_archive/inagural20jan1949.htm|website=Harry S. Truman Presidential Library &amp; Museum|accessdate=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While claiming that the "era of development" began at this point, post development theorists do not suggest that the concept of development was new. What ''was'' new was the definition of  development in terms of an escape from [[underdevelopment]]. Since the latter referred to two-thirds of the world, this meant that most societies were made to see themselves as having fallen into the undignified condition of "underdevelopment", and thus to look outside of their own cultures for salvation.

Development, according to these critics, was now a euphemism for post-war [[American hegemony]]; it was the ideals and development programs of the United States and its (Western) European allies that would form the basis of development everywhere else.

==Post-development theory==
Post-development theory arose in the 1980s and 1990s through the works of scholars like [[Arturo Escobar (anthropologist)|Arturo Escobar]], [[Gustavo Esteva]], [[Majid Rahnema]], [[Wolfgang Sachs]], [[James Ferguson (anthropologist)|James Ferguson]], [[Serge Latouche]], and [[Gilbert Rist]]. Leading members of the post-development school argue that development was always unjust, never worked, and at this point has clearly failed. According to [[Wolfgang Sachs]], a leading member of the post-development school, "the idea of development stands like a ruin in the intellectual landscape" and "it is time to dismantle this mental structure."&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Sachs, "Introduction" in Sachs 1992: 1-5, citation p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

To cite an example of this "mental structure", development theorists point out how the concept of development has resulted in the hierarchy of developed and underdeveloped nations, where the developed nations are seen as more advanced and superior to the underdeveloped nations that are conceived as inferior, in need of help from the developed nations, and desiring to be like the developed nations. The post-development school of thought points out that the models of development are often ethnocentric (in this case Eurocentric), universalist, and based on western models of industrialization that are unsustainable in this world of limited resources and ineffective for their ignorance of the local, cultural and historical contexts of the peoples to which they are applied. In essence, the problem post-development theorists see in development and its practice is an imbalance of influence or domination by the west. Post development theorists promote more pluralism in ideas about development.

===Critique of ethnocentrism and universalism===
Among the starting points and basic assumptions of post-development thought is the idea that a middle-class, Western lifestyle and all that goes with it (which might include the nuclear family, mass consumption, living in suburbia and extensive private space), may neither be a realistic nor a desirable goal for the majority of the world's population. In this sense, development is seen as requiring the loss, or indeed the deliberate extermination (ethnocide)  of indigenous culture&lt;ref&gt;''Ancient Futures: learning from Ladakh'' by Helena Norberg-Hodge. Sierra Club Books, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; or other psychologically and environmentally rich and rewarding modes of life. As a result, formerly satisfactory ways of life become dissatisfying because development changes people's perception of themselves.

[[Majid Rahnema]] cites [[Helena Norberg-Hodge]]: "To take an example, Helena Norberg-Hodge mentions how the notion of poverty hardly existed in [[Ladakh]] when she visited that country for the first time in 1975. Today she says, it has become part of the language. When visiting an outlying village some eight years ago, Helena asked a young Ladakhi where were the poorest houses. 'We have no poor houses in our village,' was the proud reply. Recently Helena saw the same Ladakhi talking to an American tourist and overheard him say, 'if only you could do something for us, we are so poor.'"&lt;ref&gt;Majid Rahnema, "Poverty" in: Sachs 1992: 158-176, citation p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Majid Rahnema also refers to Peter Bunyard, "Can Self-sufficient Communities survive the onslaught of Development?", The Ecologist, Vol. 14, 1984, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

Development is seen as a set of knowledges, interventions and worldviews (in short, discourses) which are also powers: to intervene, to transform and to rule.  Post-development critiques challenge the notion of a single path to development and demands acknowledgment of diversity of cultural perspectives and priorities.

For example, the politics of defining and satisfying [[needs]] is a crucial dimension of development thought, deeply entwined in the concept of [[agency (sociology)|agency]]. But who voices development concerns, what power relations are played out, how do the interests of development "experts" (the [[World Bank]], IMF officials, professionals, and so on) rule the development priorities, and which voices are excluded as a result? The post-development approach attempts to overcome the inequality of this discourse by opening up spaces for non-Western peoples and their concerns.

Postdevelopment theory is, above all, a critique of the standard assumptions about progress: who possesses the key to it and how it may be implemented.

===Alternatives to development===
While the postdevelopment school provides a plethora of development critiques, it also considers alternative methods for bringing about positive change. The postdevelopment school proposes a particular vision of society removed from the discourse of development, modernity, politics, cultural and economic influences from the west, and market oriented and centralized authoritarian societies.

In his works, [[Arturo Escobar (anthropologist)|Escobar]] has outlined the common features of post-development thought and societal vision. According to Escobar, the post-development school of thought is interested (in terms of searching for an alternative to development) in "local culture and knowledge; a critical stance toward established scientific discourses; and the defense and promotion of localized, pluralistic grassroots movements." Grassroots movements, Escobar argues, are "local, pluralistic, and distrust organized politics and development establishment." ([https://books.google.at/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=M0NRDwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PT7&amp;dq=arturo+escobar+designs+for+the+pluriverse&amp;ots=NzHTavKElr&amp;sig=4ypQm3eI3YI89k-4LshndRAXp7E&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=arturo%20escobar%20designs%20for%20the%20pluriverse&amp;f=false Escobar, 2017])

Post-development thought takes inspiration from vernacular societies, the informal sector and frugal rather than materialistic lifestyles. Furthermore, post-development theorists advocate for structural changes. According to Escobar, post-developmental thinking believes that the economy must be based around solidarity and reciprocity; policy must focus on direct democracy; and knowledge systems should be traditional, or at least a hybrid of modern and traditional knowledge.

===James Ferguson===
{{Further|James Ferguson (anthropologist)}}
One of the leading anti-development writers, James Ferguson contributed to what John Rapley termed "the most important of the opening salvos" of post-development theory with his book ''The Anti-Politics Machine: Development, Depoliticization, and Bureaucratic Power in Lesotho''. In ''The Anti-Politics Machine'' Ferguson describes the failure of the development project to properly understand the cultural and economic values of the people of Lesotho. This misunderstanding led to misappropriation of resources by the international community and myriad negative consequences for Basotho (residents of Lesotho), prompting Ferguson to comment that "Capitalist interests [...] can only operate through a set of social and cultural structures so complex that the outcome may be only a baroque and unrecognizable transformation of the original intention."&lt;ref name="Anti-Politics"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ferguson|first=James|title=The Anti-Politics Machine: Development, Depoliticization, and Bureacratic Power in Lesotho|journal=The Ecologist|date=September–October 1994|volume=24|issue=5|pages=176–181|url=http://exacteditions.theecologist.org/read/resurgence/ecologist-vol-24-no-5-sep-oct-1994-6241/18/3|accessdate=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Development projects cannot simply create a desired result, but instead have a number of unexpected consequences.

Ferguson suggests that although development projects often end in failure, they still produce tangible impacts in the physical and social-political environment. In ''The Anti-Politics Machine'', he asks, "What do aid programs do besides fail to help poor people?"&lt;ref name="Anti-Politics"/&gt; In the case of Lesotho, Ferguson proposes that, "while the project did not transform livestock-keeping it did build a road to link to Thaba-Tsea more strongly with the capital."&lt;ref name="Anti-Politics"/&gt; Ferguson argues that there is value to understanding and thinking about the [[unintended consequences]] for an environment.

===Arturo Escobar===
{{Further|Arturo Escobar (anthropologist)}}
Critics of development do not deny the need for change. They argue instead that to enact proper and effective change, change itself must first be conceived in different terms. Arturo Escobar, another leading member of the post-development school, argues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;While social change has probably always been part of the human experience, it was only within the European modernity that 'society', i.e. the whole way of life of a people, was open to empirical analysis and made the subject of planned change. And while communities in the Third World may find that there is a need for some sort of organised or directed change—in part to reverse the damage done by development—this undoubtedly will not take the form of 'designing life' or social engineering. In this long run, this means that categories and meanings have to be redefined; through their innovative political practice, new social movements of various kinds are already embarked on this process of redefining the social, and knowledge itself.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Majid Rahnema===
{{Further|Majid Rahnema}}
Majid Rahnema addresses the question of which path to take directly in his conclusion to the ''Post-Development Reader''. Rahnema admits that it may be true that a large majority of people, whose lives are in fact difficult, do want change. But the answer he suggests is not development but the "end of development". He says that the end of development is not "An end to the search for new possibilities of change, for a relational world of friendship, or for genuine processes of regeneration able to give birth to new forms of solidarity". Rather, Rahnema argues, the "inhumane and the ultimately destructive approach to change is over. It should resemble a call to the 'good people' everywhere to think and work together."{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

===Serge Latouche===
{{Further|Serge Latouche}}
Serge Latouche is a [[French people|French]] [[emeritus]] [[professor]] in economy at the [[University of Paris-Sud]]. A  specialist in North-South economic and cultural relations, and in social sciences epistemology, he has developed a critical theory towards economic orthodoxy. He denounces [[economism]], [[utilitarianism]] in social sciences, [[Consumerism|consumer society]] and the notion of [[sustainable development]]. He particularly criticizes the notions of [[economic efficiency]] and [[economic rationalism]]. He is one of the thinkers and most renowned partisans of the [[Degrowth|degrowth theory]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.solutionslocales-lefilm.com/en/characters/serge-latouche {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231170033/http://www.solutionslocales-lefilm.com/en/characters/serge-latouche |date=December 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latouche has also published in the [[Mouvement Anti-Utilitariste dans les Sciences Sociales|Revue de Mauss]], a French anti-utilitarian journal.

===Wolfgang Sachs and ''The Development Dictionary''===
{{Further|Wolfgang Sachs}}
Wolfgang Sachs is a leading writer in post-development thought. Most of his writing is focused on environmentally sustainable development and the idea that past notions of development are naturally unsustainable practices on our finite planet. However, in 1992 he co-authored and edited ''The Development Dictionary: A Guide to Knowledge as Power'' which contributed greatly to the compilation of post development literature as a general theory.

This manifesto posits that the new era of development that emerged in the 1950s was created by the United States in order to secure its new hegemonic position in the global community. Sachs explains that the concept of "underdevelopment" was actually constructed in [[Harry S. Truman's 1949 inaugural address]], which popularized the term. Sachs argues that the creation of this term was a discrete, strategic move to secure American hegemony by reinforcing the idea that the United States is at the top, and other countries on a lower pillar, of a linear and singular trajectory of development. It created a homogeneous identity for these countries and stripped them of their own diverse characteristics. "It converts participation into a manipulative trick to involve people in struggles for getting what the powerful want to impose on them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sachs|first=Wolfgang|title=The Development Dictionary: A Guide to Knowledge as Power|year=1992|publisher=Zed Books|isbn=978-1-85649-044-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Development Dictionary'' describes a biological metaphor for development. This biological metaphor was transferred to the social sphere and perpetuated the ideal that there is one natural way to develop into the perfect form. To develop in a manner disparate from the "natural order of things" was to become a disfigured anomaly. This definition held the potential to provide morally ambiguous justification for imperialist behavior and can be connected to colonial discourse and mainstream development theories. Under such categorization, Sachs explains, development was reduced to a simple measurement of the economic growth of per capita production.

Sachs issues a cry for public awareness of the "limits of development." He leaves the reader with the idea of the "New Commons" and posits that men and women should begin with this awareness before attempting to introduce new political policies with room for creativity and innovation in diverse development paths.

==Criticisms==

There is a large body of works which are critical of post-development theory and its proponents.  It has been noted that post-development theory sees all development as imposed upon the developing world by the West.  This dualist perspective of development may be unrealistic, and Marc Edelman notes that a large proportion of development has risen from, rather than been imposed upon, the developing world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Edelman|first=Marc|title=Peasants Against Globalization: Rural Social Movements in Costa Rica|year=1999|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, CA|isbn=978-0804734011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Citing Jonathan Crush's point that "Development, for all its power to speak and to control the terms of speaking, has never been impervious to challenge and resistance, nor, in response, to reformulation and change"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crush|first=Jonathan|title=Power of Development|year=1995|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-11176-8|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ray Kiely argues that "The post-development idea is thus part of a long history within the development discourse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kiely|first=Ray|title=The Last Refuge of the Nohle Savage? A Critical Assessment of Post-Development Theory|journal=European Journal of Development Research|date=1 June 1999|volume=11|issue=1|pages=30–55|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=395bfdd5-ba80-4be4-a31c-e338a540617e%40sessionmgr114&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=108|accessdate=12 February 2013|doi=10.1080/09578819908426726}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In short, Kiely argues that post-development theory is merely the latest version of a set of criticisms that have long been evident within writing and thought in the field of development. Development has always been about choices, Kiely explains.  Choices with resulting losers and winners, dilemmas and destruction, as well as creative possibility.

There are a number of more fundamental objections to the postdevelopment school. The first is that it overstates its case. A rejection of ''all development'' is a rejection of the possibility for material advancement and transformation. It ignores the tangible transformations in life opportunities and health and material well-being that has been evident in parts of the developing world. Moreover, development itself is so varied and carries so many meanings that critiques need to be specific about their intention when they claim to be "post- development". By damning development all together, post-development theorists fail to notice the heterogeneity within development discourse. They categorize all development under the umbrella of Western hegemony, contradictively applying the same sort of essentialist generalization post-development theorists reject.

Critics also argue that post-development perpetuates cultural relativism: the idea that cultural beliefs and practices can be judged only by those who practice them. By accepting all cultural behaviors and beliefs as valid and rejecting a universal standard for living and understanding life, critics of post-development argue, post-development represents the opposite extreme of universalism, extreme relativism.  Such a relativist extreme, rather than besting extreme universalism, has equally dangerous implications.  John Rapley points out that "rejection of essentialism rests itself on an essentialist claim – namely, that all truth is constructed and arbitrary[...]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rapley|first=John|title=Development studies and the post-development critique|journal=Progress in Development Studies|date=1 October 2004|volume=4 | issue = 4|pages=350–354|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/218128258|accessdate=12 February 2013|doi=10.1191/1464993404ps095pr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kiely also argues that by rejecting a top-down, centralized approach to development and promoting development through local means, post-development thought perpetuates neo-liberal ideals. Kiely remarks that "The argument — upheld by [[Dependency theory|dependency]] and post-development theory — that the [[First World]] needs the [[Third World]], and vice versa, rehearses neo-liberal assumptions that the world is an equal playing field in which all nation states have the capacity to compete equally[...]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kiely|first=Ray|title=Development Theory and Industrialisation: Beyond the Impasse|journal=Journal of Contemporary Asia|year=1994|volume=24|issue=2|pages=133–160|doi=10.1080/00472339480000101}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, making locals responsible for their own predicament, post-development unintentionally agrees with neo-liberalist ideology that favors decentralized projects and ignores the possibility of assisting impoverished demographics, instead making the fallacious assumption that such demographics must succeed on their own initiative alone. Kiely notes that not all grassroots movements are progressive. Post-development is seen to empower anti-modern fundamentalists and traditionalists, who may hold non-progressive and oppressive values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kiely|first=Ray|title=The Last Refuge of the Noble Savage?

The '''problem play''' is a form of drama that emerged during the 19th century as part of the wider movement of [[Realism (arts)|realism]] in the arts, especially following the innovations of [[Henrik Ibsen]]. It deals with contentious social issues through debates between the characters on stage, who typically represent conflicting points of view within a realistic social context.&lt;ref name="Problem plays"&gt;[http://www.theatrelinks.com/problem-play/ Problem Play - ''Theatre Links'']&lt;/ref&gt; Critic [[Chris Baldick]] writes that the genre emerged "from the ferment of the 1890s... for the most part inspired by the example of Ibsen's realistic stage representations of serious familial and social conflicts." He summarises it as follows:

{{quote|Rejecting the frivolity of intricately plotted romantic intrigues in the nineteenth-century French tradition of the '[[well-made play]]', it favoured instead the form of the 'problem play', which would bring to life some contemporary controversy of public importance—women's rights, unemployment, penal reform, class privilege—in a vivid but responsibly accurate presentation.&lt;ref name = "cris"&gt;Chris Baldick, ''The Modern Movement: 1910-1940'', Oxford University Press, Oxford,  2004, p.116; 367&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The critic [[F. S. Boas]] adapted the term to characterise [[Shakespeare's problem plays|certain plays]] by [[William Shakespeare]] that he considered to have characteristics similar to Ibsen's 19th-century problem plays. As a result, the term is also used more broadly and retrospectively to describe any [[Tragicomedy|tragicomic]] dramas that do not fit easily into the classical [[Genre|generic]] distinction between [[comedy]] and [[tragedy]].&lt;ref name="Problem plays" /&gt;

==Early "problem plays"==
While plays in ancient Greece and ancient Rome, mystery plays, and Elizabethan plays are clearly classified as tragedy, comedy, and [[satyr play]]s, there are some plays that exhibit the characteristics of problem plays, such as [[Alcestis (play)|Alcestis]].

==Shakespeare==
{{main|Shakespearean problem play}} 
[[F. S. Boas]] used the term to refer to a group of Shakespeare's play, which seem to contain both comic and tragic elements. For Boas the 'problem' plays were ''[[Measure for Measure]]'', ''[[All's Well That Ends Well]]'' and ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]''. He wrote that "throughout these plays we move along dim untrodden paths, and at the close our feeling is neither of simple joy nor pain; we are excited, fascinated, perplexed, for the issues raised preclude a completely satisfactory outcome".&lt;ref&gt;F. S. Boas, ''Shakespeare and his Predecessors'', John Murray, Third Impression, 1910, pp. 344–408.&lt;/ref&gt; Later critics have used the term for other plays, including ''[[Timon of Athens]]'' and ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]''.

==19th-century drama==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1983-1118-005, Berlin, "Gespenster".jpg|thumb|left|A performance of Ibsen's ''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'', one of the defining Problem plays,  in Berlin, 1983.]]
While social debates in drama were nothing new, the problem play of the 19th century was distinguished by its intent to confront the spectator with the dilemmas experienced by the characters. The earliest forms of the problem play are to be found in the work of French writers such as [[Alexandre Dumas, fils]], who dealt with the subject of [[prostitution]] in ''[[The Lady of the Camellias]]'' (1852). Other French playwrights followed suit with dramas about a range of social issues, sometimes approaching the subject in a moralistic, sometimes in a sentimental manner. Critic Thomas H. Dickinson, writing in 1927, argued that these early problem plays were hampered by the dramatic conventions of the day, "No play written in the problem form was significant beyond the value of the idea that was its underlying motive for existence. No problem play had achieved absolute beauty, or a living contribution to truth."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas H. Dickinson, ''An Outline of Contemporary Drama'', Houghton Mifflin, Boston, 1927, p.48&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important exponent of the problem play, however, was the [[Norway|Norwegian]] writer [[Henrik Ibsen]], whose work combined penetrating characterisation with emphasis on topical social issues, usually concentrated on the moral dilemmas of a central character. In a series of plays Ibsen addressed a range of problems, most notably the restriction of women's lives in ''[[A Doll's House]]'' (1879), sexually-transmitted disease in ''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'' (1882) and provincial greed in ''[[An Enemy of the People]]'' (1882). Ibsen's dramas proved immensely influential, spawning variants of the problem play in works by [[George Bernard Shaw]] and other later dramatists.

==20th century==
The genre was especially influential in the early 20th century. In Britain plays such as Houghton's ''[[Hindle Wakes (play)|Hindle Wakes]]'' (1912), developed the genre to shift the nature of the 'problem'. This "resolutely realistic problem play set in domestic interiors of the mill town Hindle" starts with the 'problem' of an apparently seduced woman, but ends with the woman herself rejected her status as a victim of seduction "the 'problem' is not, after all, the redemption of a betrayed maiden's tarnished honour, but the readiness of her respectable elders to determine a young woman's future for her without regard to her rights—including here her right to erotic holiday enjoyment."&lt;ref name = "cris"/&gt;

In America the problem play was associated with the emergence of debates over civil rights issues. Racial issues were tackled in plays such as [[Angelina Weld Grimké]]'s, ''Rachel''.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Fehrenbach, "An Early Twentieth-Century Problem Play of Life in Black America: Angelina Grimké's ''Rachel''," in ''Wild Women in the Whirlwind: Afra-American Culture and the Contemporary Literary Renaissance'', ed. Joanne M. Braxton and Andree Nicola McLaughlin ( New Brunswick: Rutgers UP, 1990), pp. 89-106.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a tool of the socialist theatre in the 1920s and 30s, and overlapped with forms of documentary theatre in works such as Carl Crede's ''Paragraph 218'' (1930), which concerns the issue of abortion, and which was directed by [[Erwin Piscator]].&lt;ref&gt;Gary Fisher Dawson, ''Documentary Theatre in the United States: An Historical Survey and Analysis of Its Content, Form, and Stagecraft'', Greenwood Press, Westport, CT., 1999, p.126.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13545">A [[centenarian]] is a person who has attained the age of 100 years or more. Research on centenarians is becoming increasingly widespread with clinical and general population studies now having been conducted in [[France]], [[Hungary]], [[Japan]], [[Italy]], [[Finland]], [[Denmark]], the [[United States]], and [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=BC7F47CE326D55B3A36427E83CE7E277.tomcat1?fromPage=online&amp;aid=272918 Mental Health of the Oldest Old: The Relevance of Centenarian Studies to Psychogeriatric Research] International Psychogeriatrics (1998), 10:1:7-9 Cambridge University Press.

== Biochemical factors ==

Research carried out in Italy suggests that healthy centenarians have high levels of [[vitamin A]] and [[vitamin E]] and that this seems to be important in guaranteeing their extreme longevity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Mecocci P, Polidori MC, Troiano L, etal |title=Plasma antioxidants and longevity: a study on healthy centenarians |journal=Free Radic Biol Med |volume=28 |issue=8 |pages=1243–8 |date=Apr 2000 |pmid=10889454 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0891-5849(00)00246-X |doi=10.1016/S0891-5849(00)00246-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research contradicts this and has found that these findings do not apply to centenarians from [[Sardinia]], for whom other factors probably play a more important role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Polidori MC, Mariani E, Baggio G, etal |title=Different antioxidant profiles in Italian centenarians: the Sardinian peculiarity |journal=Eur J Clin Nutr |volume=61 |issue=7 |pages=922–4 |date=Jul 2007 |pmid=17228351 |doi=10.1038/sj.ejcn.1602596 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A preliminary study carried out in [[Poland]] showed that, in comparison with young healthy female adults, centenarians living in [[Upper Silesia]] had significantly higher red blood cell [[glutathione reductase]] and [[catalase]] activities and higher, although insignificantly, serum levels of [[vitamin E]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kłapcińska B, Derejczyk J, Wieczorowska-Tobis K, Sobczak A, Sadowska-Krepa E, Danch A |title=Antioxidant defense in centenarians (a preliminary study) |journal=Acta Biochim Pol. |volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=281–92 |year=2000 |pmid=11051193 |url=http://www.actabp.pl/pdf/2_2000/281.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers in [[Denmark]] have also found that centenarians exhibit a high activity of [[glutathione reductase]] in red blood cells. In this study, those centenarians having the best cognitive and physical functional capacity tended to have the highest activity of this [[enzyme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Andersen HR, Jeune B, Nybo H, Nielsen JB, Andersen-Ranberg K, Grandjean P |title=Low activity of superoxide dismutase and high activity of glutathione reductase in erythrocytes from centenarians |journal=Age Ageing |volume=27 |issue=5 |pages=643–8 |date=Sep 1998 |pmid=12675104 |url=http://ageing.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12675104 |doi=10.1093/ageing/27.5.643}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some research suggests that high levels of vitamin D may be associated with longevity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmaj.ca/content/early/2012/11/05/cmaj.120233 Levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in familial longevity: the Leiden Longevity Study] CMAJ November 5, 2012  First published November 5, 2012, {{DOI|10.1503/cmaj.120233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other research has found that people having parents who became centenarians have an increased number of naïve [[B-cells]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2194078/Blood-tests-'could-be-used-to-predict-lifespan'.html Blood tests 'could be used to predict lifespan'] Daily Telegraph, UK. Published June 25, 2008. Accessed February 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed  that centenarians possess a different [[adiponectin]] [[isoform]] pattern and have a favorable metabolic [[phenotype]] in comparison with elderly individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 23396152 | doi=10.1016/j.exger.2013.01.015 | volume=48 | title=Assessment of adiponectin and its isoforms in Polish centenarians | author=Bik W, Baranowska-Bik A, Wolinska-Witort E, Kalisz M, Broczek K, Mossakowska M, Baranowska B | journal=Exp Gerontol | pages=401–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genetic factors ==

Research carried out in the [[United States]] has found that people are much more likely to celebrate their 100th birthday if their brother or sister has reached the age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/2036002.stm Family link to long life] BBC News. Published June 10, 2002. Accessed February 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; These findings, from the [[New England Centenarian Study]] in Boston, suggest that the sibling of a centenarian is four times more likely to live past 90 than the general population.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2004-02-22-longevity-usat_x.htm?loc=interstitialskip The secrets to longevity] USA Today. Published February 22, 2004. Accessed February 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Other research carried out by the New England Centenarian Study has identified 150 genetic variations that appeared to be associated with longevity which could be used to predict with 77 percent accuracy whether someone would live to be at least 100.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/07/01/MNHL1E87PC.DTL Study shows genes are key in living to be 100] San Francisco Chronicle. Published July 2, 2010. Accessed July 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research also suggests that there is a clear link between living to 100 and inheriting a hyperactive version of telomerase, an enzyme that prevents cells from ageing. Scientists from the [[Albert Einstein College of Medicine]] in the US say centenarian [[Ashkenazi Jews]] have this mutant gene.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8359735.stm Mutant genes 'key to long life'] BBC News. Published November 15, 2009. Accessed January 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many centenarians manage to avoid chronic diseases even after indulging in a lifetime of serious health risks. For example, many people in the New England Centenarian Study experienced a century free of cancer or heart disease despite smoking as many as 60 cigarettes a day for 50 years. The same applies to people from Okinawa in Japan, where around half of supercentenarians had a history of smoking and one-third were regular alcohol drinkers. It is possible that these people may have had genes that protected them from the dangers of carcinogens or the random mutations that crop up naturally when cells divide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courant.com/health/sns-200910201351tmspremhnstr--k-h20091021oct21,0,4810521,full.story Lessons in Longevity: Growing Life Spans Pose Social, Ethical and Economic Dilemmas] Hartford Courant. Published October 21, 2009. Accessed January 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, centenarian research carried out at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine found that the individuals studied had less than sterling health habits. As a group, for example, they were more obese, more sedentary and exercised less than other, younger cohorts. The researchers also discovered three uncommon genotype similarities among the centenarians: one gene that causes [[HDL cholesterol]] to be at levels two- to three-fold higher than average; another gene that results in a mildly [[underactive thyroid]]; and a functional mutation in the [[human growth hormone]] axis that may be a safeguard from [[aging-associated diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2011/07/13/in-the-science-of-aging-oldest-new-yorkers-hold-the-key/ In the Science of Aging, Oldest New Yorkers Hold the Key] Wall Street Journal. Published July 13, 2011. Accessed July 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is well known that the children of parents who have a long life are also likely to reach a healthy age, but it is not known why, although the inherited genes are probably important.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2194078/Blood-tests-'could-be-used-to-predict-lifespan'.html Blood tests 'could be used to predict lifespan'] Daily Telegraph, UK. Published June 25, 2008. Accessed June 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A variation in the gene [[FOXO3A]] is known to have a positive effect on the life expectancy of humans, and is found much more often in people living to 100 and beyond - moreover, this appears to be true worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physorg.com/news152884067.html Living longer thanks to the 'longevity gene'] Physorg.com. Published February 3, 2009. Accessed February 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some research suggests that centenarian offspring are more likely to age in better cardiovascular health than their peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Adams ER, Nolan VG, Andersen SL, Perls TT, Terry DF |title=Centenarian offspring: start healthier and stay healthier |journal=J Am Geriatr Soc |volume=56 |issue=11 |pages=2089–92 |date=Nov 2008 |pmid=18811609 |pmc=2892731 |doi=10.1111/j.1532-5415.2008.01949.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General observations==

Several studies have shown that centenarians have better cardiovascular risk profiles compared to younger old people. The contribution of drug treatments to promote extreme longevity is not confirmed and centenarians in general have needed fewer drugs at younger ages due to a healthy lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 17689040 | doi=10.1016/j.exger.2007.06.009 | volume=43 | title=Cardiovascular risk factors in centenarians | author=Galioto A, Dominguez LJ, Pineo A, Ferlisi A, Putignano E, Belvedere M, Costanza G, Barbagallo M | journal=Exp Gerontol | pages=106–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by the International Longevity Centre-UK, published in 2011, suggested that today's centenarians may be healthier than the next generation of centenarians.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilcuk.org.uk/index.php/publications/publication_details/living_beyond_100_a_report_on_centenarians&lt;/ref&gt;

Ninety percent of the centenarians studied in the [[New England Centenarian Study]] were functionally independent the vast majority of their lives up until the average age of 92 years and seventy-five percent were the same at an average age of 95 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bumc.bu.edu/centenarian/overview/ Overview, New England Centenarian Study website] Accessed February 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a study of US [[supercentenarian]]s (age 110 to 119 years) showed that, even at these advanced ages, 40% needed little assistance or were independent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8284574.stm Half of babies 'will live to 100'] BBC News, UK. Published October 2, 2009. Accessed October 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A study supported by the US National Institute on Aging found significant associations between month of birth and longevity, with individuals born in September–November having a higher likelihood of becoming centenarians compared to March-born individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindawi.com/journals/jar/2011/104616/ Season of Birth and Exceptional Longevity: Comparative Study of American Centenarians, Their Siblings, and Spouses] Journal of Aging Research, Volume 2011 (2011), Article ID 104616, doi:10.4061/2011/104616. Published September, 2011. Accessed July 14, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, a 2010 Census Bureau report found that more than 80 percent of centenarians are women.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/2010_census/cb12-239.html 2010 Census Report Shows More Than 80 Percent of Centenarians are Women] U.S. Department of Commerce, United States Census Bureau press release.

'''Snailbeach Countryside Site''' is an industrial archeology site in [[Shropshire]]. It is located three {{convert|3|mi|km}} south of the village of [[Pontesbury]] and around {{convert|12|mi|km|0}} from the county town of [[Shrewsbury]]. At peak of production during the 19th century, it was reputed to be extracting the largest volume of [[lead]] per [[acre]] in Europe.

== History and importance ==
Once the biggest lead mine in the county of Shropshire, the site is conserved as a [[scheduled monument]].&lt;ref name="council"&gt;Shropshire Council.(Unknown).[http://shropshire.gov.uk/outdoor-recreation/parks-and-countryside-sites/snailbeach-countryside-site/ "Snailbeach Countryside Site"]. Last accessed 4 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lead mining may have taken place here since [[Mining in Roman Britain#Lead mining|Roman times]] and, at peak of production in the 1840s and '50s, it is reputed to have extracted the largest volume of lead per acre in Europe. Lead mining ceased at the site in 1955.&lt;ref name="snailbeach"&gt;Snailbeach Lead Mine.(Unknown). [http://shropshiremines.org.uk/snailbeach/sbhist.htm "History"] Date retrieved 11 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barite]], [[calcite]], [[fluorspar]], [[silver]] and [[zinc]] were also mined in smaller amounts.&lt;ref name="snailbeach"/&gt;

===Snailbeach Mining Disaster===
On the morning of 6 March 1895, seven men died after the cable lowering their cage down the mine snapped, plunging them {{convert|252|yd|m|0}} to the shaft floor.&lt;ref name="accident"&gt;Margaret Corfield.(April 1955).[http://www3.shropshire-cc.gov.uk/roots/packages/ind/ind_s03b.htm "Mineral Mining: The 1985 Snailbeach Mining disaster"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231034739/http://www3.shropshire-cc.gov.uk/roots/packages/ind/ind_s03b.htm |date=31 December 2012 }} Date retrieved 11 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that such was the force of the impact, that the steel cage was reduced from over {{convert|7|ft|m}} in height to just {{convert|18|in|mm|0}}, however, a watch from one of the miners was found still ticking at the scene.&lt;ref name="accident"/&gt;

== Snailbeach Lead Mine Heritage Project ==
The council's outdoor recreation service and Shropshire Mines Trusts manage and preserve the site and have been awarded a £20,000 management grant from [[English Heritage]] to restore the Black Tom mine shaft headgear and some of the buildings. Their plans include assembling a building to store a mining jigger that was removed for restoration more than a decade ago.&lt;ref name="council"/&gt;

There are restored mining buildings to explore in the site, including a locomotive shed, winding engine house, blacksmith's shop, compressor house and [[Cornish engine]].&lt;ref name="council"/&gt; A circular walk links them, but some areas may be restricted to protect residents’ privacy.&lt;ref name="council"/&gt; [[Stiperstones]] nature reserve can be accessed from this site.&lt;ref name="council"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3056">In [[ecology]], the '''species discovery curve''' or '''species accumulation curve''' is a graph recording the cumulative number of [[species]] of living things recorded in a particular environment as a function of the cumulative effort expended searching for them (usually measured in person-hours).  It is related to, but not identical with, the [[species-area curve]].  

The species discovery curve will necessarily be increasing, and will normally be negatively accelerated (that is, its rate of increase will slow down).  Plotting the curve gives a way of estimating the number of additional species that will be discovered with further effort.  This is usually done by fitting some kind of functional form to the curve, either by eye or by using non-linear [[regression analysis|regression]] techniques.  Commonly used functional forms include the [[logarithm]]ic function and the negative [[exponential function]].  The advantage of the negative exponential function is that it tends to an [[asymptote]] which equals the number of species that would be discovered if infinite effort is expended.  However, some theoretical approaches imply that the logarithmic curve may be more appropriate,{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} implying that though species discovery will slow down with increasing effort, it will never entirely cease, so there is no asymptote, and if infinite effort was expended, an infinite number of species would be discovered.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} 

The first theoretical investigation of the species-discovery process was in a classic paper by Fisher, Corbet and Williams (1943), which was based on a large collection of [[butterfly|butterflies]] made in [[British Malaya|Malaya]].  Theoretical statistical work on the problem continues, see for example the recent paper by [[Anne Chao|Chao]] and Shen (2004).  The theory is linked to that of [[Zipf's law]].

The same approach is used in many other fields.  For example, in [[ethology]], it can be applied to the number of distinct [[fixed action pattern]]s that will be discovered as a function of cumulative effort studying the behaviour of a species of animal; in [[molecular genetics]] it is now being applied to the number of distinct [[gene]]s that are discovered; and in literary studies, it can be used to estimate the total [[vocabulary]] of a writer from the given sample of his or her recorded works (see Efron &amp; Thisted, 1976).

'''Toxicology testing''', also known as '''safety assessment''', or '''toxicity testing''', is conducted to determine the degree to which a substance can damage a living or non-living organisms.  It is often conducted by researchers using standard test procedures to comply with governing regulations, for example for medicines and pesticides. Much toxicology is considered to be part of the field of [[preclinical development]]. Stages of ''in vitro'' and ''in vivo'' research are conducted to determine safe doses of exposure in humans before a [[first-in-man study]]. Toxicology testing may be conducted by the [[pharmaceutical industry]], [[biotechnology]] companies or [[contract research organizations]].

== History ==
{{expand section|date=September 2012}}

=== Europe ===

Around one million animals, primate and non–primate, are used every year in Europe in toxicology tests.&lt;ref name=Abbott&gt;{{cite journal |last=Abbott |first=A |url=http://ethics.ucsd.edu/journal/2006/readings/Animal_Testing_More_than_a_cosmetic_change.pdf |title=Animal testing: More than a cosmetic change |journal=Nature |volume=438 |issue=7065 |pages=144–146 |date=November 10, 2005 |pmid=16281001 |doi=10.1038/438144a |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227041442/http://ethics.ucsd.edu/journal/2006/readings/Animal_Testing_More_than_a_cosmetic_change.pdf |archivedate=February 27, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, one-fifth of animal experiments are toxicology tests.&lt;ref name=Lords3&gt; [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldselect/ldanimal/150/15006.htm Select Committee on Animals in Scientific Procedures Report], House of Lords, Chapter 3: The purpose and nature of animal experiments.&lt;/ref&gt; Animal testing for cosmetic purposes is currently banned all across the [[European Union]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/cosmetics/animal-testing_en|title=Ban on Animal Testing - Growth - European Commission|author=|date=|website=Growth|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodology ==

Toxicity tests examine finished products such as [[pesticide]]s, [[medication]]s, [[cosmetics]], [[food additives]] such as [[artificial sweetener]]s, packing materials,  and [[air freshener]], or their chemical ingredients.  The substances are applied to the skin or eyes; injected [[intravenous]]ly, [[intramuscular]]ly, or [[Subcutaneous injection|subcutaneous]]ly; inhaled either by placing a mask over the animals and restraining them, or by placing them in an inhalation chamber; or administered orally, through a tube into the stomach, or placing them in the animals' food. Doses may be given once, repeated regularly for many months, or for the lifespan of the animal.  Toxicity tests can also be conducted on materials need to be disposed such as sediment to be disposed in marine environment.

== Contract research organizations ==
{{Main|Contract research organization}}

A contract research organization (CRO) is an organization that provides support to the  [[Pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical]], [[biotechnology]], chemical, and medical device industries in the form of research services [[Outsourcing|outsourced]] on a contract basis.  A CRO may provide toxicity testing services, along with others such as assay development, [[Pre-clinical development|preclinical research]], [[clinical research]], clinical trials management, and [[pharmacovigilance]]. CROs also support foundations, research institutions, and universities, in addition to governmental organizations (such as the [[NIH]], [[European Medicines Agency|EMEA]], etc.).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100311082536/http://www.acrohealth.org/cro-market.php "The CRO Market"], Association of Clinical Research Organizations.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regulation ==
=== United States ===
In the United States, toxicology tests are subject to [[Good Laboratory Practice]] guidelines and other [[Food and Drug Administration]] laws.

The '''Treasure of Guarrazar''', [[Guadamur]], [[Province of Toledo]], [[Castile-La Mancha]], [[Spain]], is an  [[Archaeology|archeological]] find composed of twenty-six [[votive crown]]s and gold [[cross]]es that had originally been offered to the [[Roman Catholic Church]] by the [[Visigoth|Kings of the Visigoths]] in the seventh century in [[Hispania]], as a gesture of the orthodoxy of their faith and their submission to the ecclesiastical hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musee-moyenage.fr/pages/page_id18361_u1l2.htm Musée National du Moyen Âge, Hôtel de Cluny] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317142133/http://www.musee-moyenage.fr/pages/page_id18361_u1l2.htm |date=2010-03-17 }}: the Musée de Cluny conserves one of the votive crowns.&lt;/ref&gt; The most valuable of all is the votive crown of king [[Reccesuinth]] with its blue [[sapphire]]s from [[Sri Lanka]] and [[pendilia]].  Though the treasure is now divided and much has disappeared, it represents the best surviving group of Early Medieval Christian votive offerings.

The treasure, which represents the high point of Visigothic goldsmith's work,&lt;ref&gt;M.F. Guerra, T. Galligaro, A. Perea, "The treasure of Guarrazar : Tracing the gold supplies in the Visigothic Iberian peninsula", ''Archeometry'' '''49'''.1 (2007) pp. 53-74.&lt;/ref&gt; was dug between 1858 and 1861 in an orchard called ''Guarrazar'', in [[Guadamur]], very close to [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], [[Spain]]. The treasure was divided, with some objects going to the [[Musée de Cluny]] in [[Paris]]&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911 |last=Fallow |first=Thomas Macall |wstitle=Crown and Coronet |volume=7 |page=516}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the rest to the armouries of the [[Palacio Real]] in [[Madrid]] (today in the [[National Archaeological Museum of Spain]]). In 1921 and 1936, some items of the Treasure of Guarrazar were stolen and have disappeared.

Some comparable Visigothic [[filigree]] gold was found in 1926 at [[Torredonjimeno]] in the province of Jaén, consisting of fragments of votive crowns and crosses.&lt;ref&gt;Described and compared in Alicia Perea, "Visigothic filigree in the Guarrazar (Toledo) and Torredonjimeno (Jaén) treasures," ''Historic Metallurgy'' '''40'''.1 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

The jewellery found at Guarrazar is part of a continuous tradition of Iberian metalworking that goes back to prehistoric times. These Visigothic works were influenced heavily by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], but the techniques of gem encrustation found at Guarrazar were practised throughout the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic world]] and the style of the lettering was Germanic too. The crowns, however, were purely Byzantine in form and never meant to be worn. They were gifts to the church, to be hung above the altar.

The most valuable remaining pieces of the find are the two royal votive crowns: one of King [[Reccesuinth]] and one of King [[Suinthila]]. Both are made of gold, encrusted with sapphires, pearls, and other precious stones. Suinthila's was stolen in 1921 and never recovered. There are several other small crowns and many votive crosses. There were belts in the original find as well, but these have since vanished.

These findings, together with other of some neighbors and with the archaeological excavation of the Ministry of Public Works and the Royal Academy of History (April 1859), formed a group consisting of:

*  [[National Archaeological Museum of Spain]]: six crowns, five crosses, a pendant and remnants of foil and channels (almost all of gold).
*  [[Royal Palace of Madrid]]: a crown and a gold cross and a stone engraved with the Annunciation. A crown, and other fragments of a tiller with a crystal ball were stolen from the Royal Palace of Madrid in 1921 and its whereabouts are still unknown.
*  [[Musée de Cluny|National Museum of the Middle Ages]], [[Paris]]: three crowns, two crosses, links and gold pendants.

There were also many fragments of sculptures and the remains of a building, perhaps a Roman [[sanctuary]] or place of purification. After its dedication to Christian worship as a church or oratory, it housed a number of graves. A skeleton lying on a bed of lime and sand was found in the best preserved grave. Its well-preserved stone slate has a  Latin inscription that  mentions a priest named Crispín, dating from 693 (51st year of the reign of [[Égica]], year of the [[Sixteenth Council of Toledo]]). This slate is now in the National Archeological Museum of Spain in Madrid. The inscription on the Sónnica cross, a piece preserved in Paris, gives an indication about the name of this church.

According to some hypothesis, the monastery of Sancta Maria in Sorbaces of Guarrazar served as a hideout for the real treasure of the court, Toledo churches and monasteries to prevent their capture by the Muslims' invasion of Spain.

The '''valuation of nonmarket housework''' comprises attempts to attach value to non-exchange domestic tasks. Housework may include a variety of activities, particularly those traditionally associated with [[housekeeping]] (or [[homemaking]]), along with child care and nurturing. These activities have recognizable economic and social significance, but are not included in standard economic measurements, such as the [[gross domestic product]] (GDP). While the symbolic or subjective benefits of housework are difficult to measure, various attempts have been made to attach value to economically productive household activity.

==Economic Valuation==

===''Tracking Measures''===

Traditional means of tracking economic activity, such as the gross domestic product (GDP), do not take account of non-exchange, nonmarket household activity. Therefore, various adjustments to GDP calculations and novel measurements have been proposed, such as the GPI or GHP.

====Gross domestic product ([[Gross domestic product|GDP]])====

In 2012, the [[Bureau of Economic Analysis|US Department of Commerce Bureau of Economic Analysis]] (BEA) created an adjusted measure of GDP to account for productive household activity.&lt;ref name=Bridgman&gt;{{cite web|last=Bridgman|first=Benjamin|title=Accounting for Household Production in the National Accounts, 1965 - 2010|url=https://www.bea.gov/scb/pdf/2012/05%20May/0512_household.pd|publisher=Bureau of Economic Analysis Repor|accessdate=17 February 2014|archivedate=May 2012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By using detailed [[time use survey]]s for the period 1965-2010, the BEA found that incorporating “nonmarket household production” raises the GDP measure by 39% in 1965 and 26% in 2010.&lt;ref name=Bridgman&gt;{{cite web|last=Bridgman|first=Benjamin|title=Accounting for Household Production in the National Accounts, 1965 - 2010|url=https://www.bea.gov/scb/pdf/2012/05%20May/0512_household.pd|publisher=Bureau of Economic Analysis Repor|accessdate=17 February 2014|archivedate=May 2012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The surveys used seven categories of time use in American household production (housework, cooking, odd jobs, gardening, shopping, child care, and domestic travel) and the BEA assigned a low-end market wage to the hours spent on each activity.&lt;ref name=Bridgman&gt;{{cite web|last=Bridgman|first=Benjamin|title=Accounting for Household Production in the National Accounts, 1965 - 2010|url=https://www.bea.gov/scb/pdf/2012/05%20May/0512_household.pd|publisher=Bureau of Economic Analysis Repor|accessdate=17 February 2014|archivedate=May 2012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The declining impact on the adjusted GDP reflects the steadily decreasing number of (nonmarket) hours households spent on home production. While men increased their weekly hours of home production in the time span from 14 to 17, this increase was more than offset by the decline in women's home production from 40 to 26 hours.&lt;ref name=Bridgman&gt;{{cite web|last=Bridgman|first=Benjamin|title=Accounting for Household Production in the National Accounts, 1965 - 2010|url=https://www.bea.gov/scb/pdf/2012/05%20May/0512_household.pd|publisher=Bureau of Economic Analysis Repor|accessdate=17 February 2014|archivedate=May 2012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The BEA explains this shift by increased women's participation in the work force as well as the steadily decreasing market wages of household workers (such as cleaners and nannies), raising the opportunity costs of self-participation and encouraging outsourcing.&lt;ref name=Bridgman&gt;{{cite web|last=Bridgman|first=Benjamin|title=Accounting for Household Production in the National Accounts, 1965 - 2010|url=https://www.bea.gov/scb/pdf/2012/05%20May/0512_household.pd|publisher=Bureau of Economic Analysis Repor|accessdate=17 February 2014|archivedate=May 2012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Genuine progress indicator ([[Genuine progress indicator|GPI]])====

The [[Genuine progress indicator|GPI]] is an alternative to GDP as a measure of economic growth that is generally designed to incorporate environmental and social factors that are not traditionally included. While much of the focus is typically placed on environmental costs, most GPI measurements explicitly include additions for the value of household work and parenting.

One of the most well-known examples is the GPI measure used across Atlantic Canada. In a 1999 report &lt;ref name="GPI Atlantic"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gender Equality in the Genuine Progress Index|url=http://www.gpiatlantic.org/pdf/misc/genderequality.pdf|publisher=GPI Atlantic|accessdate=17 February 2014|year=October 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;  GPI Atlantic describes the household production infrastructure as akin to the access to raw materials, labour and markets required for the business sector.&lt;ref name="GPI Atlantic"/&gt; The Atlantic GPI employs time use variables and assigns explicit monetary values to [[unpaid work]] according to its replacement value in the market. According to their (1999) measurements, “unpaid work contributes $325 billion worth of services to the Canadian economy annually” and they argue that GPI analysis should be explicitly incorporated into policy considerations.&lt;ref name="GPI Atlantic"/&gt;

====Gross household product (GHP)====

Gross household product is a specific estimation of the economic value added by the unpaid work and capital of households.&lt;ref name=Ironmonger&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ironmonger|first=Duncan|author2=Faye Soupourmas |title=Output-Based Estimates of the Gross Household Product of the United States 2003-2010|date=Aug 2012|url=http://www.iariw.org/papers/2012/IronmongerPaper.pdf|accessdate=17 February 2014|publisher=The International Association for Research in Income and Wealth}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not include many of the additional factors typically included in GPI determinations but focuses specifically on the “household economy.” [[Duncan Ironmonger]] defines a country's Gross Economic Product as comprising both the Gross Market Product (typically defined as GDP) and Gross Household Product. Using one of the same time use surveys as the BEA study referenced above (the American Time Use Survey), Ironmonger estimates the USA's 2011 GHP at 11.6 trillion dollars (as compared to a GDP of 13.3 trillion).&lt;ref name=Ironmonger&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ironmonger|first=Duncan|author2=Faye Soupourmas |title=Output-Based Estimates of the Gross Household Product of the United States 2003-2010|date=Aug 2012|url=http://www.iariw.org/papers/2012/IronmongerPaper.pdf|accessdate=17 February 2014|publisher=The International Association for Research in Income and Wealth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Approaches to the Economic Valuation of Housework''====

The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] report ''Cooking, Caring and Volunteering: Unpaid Work Around the World'' defines unpaid work as, “the production of goods and services by household members that are not sold on the market” .&lt;ref name=Miranda&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miranda|first=V.|title=Cooking, Caring and Volunteering: Unpaid Work Around the World|journal=OECD Social, Employment and Migration Working Papers|year=2011|issue=116|doi=10.1787/5kghrjm8s142-en |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5kghrjm8s142-en |accessdate=17 February 2014|publisher=OECD}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It uses the “third-person” rule &lt;ref name=Reid&gt;{{cite book|last=Reid|first=Margaret|title=Economics of Household Production|year=1934}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to distinguish between work and leisure, claiming that if a third person can be paid to do the activity while benefiting the household, it is work.

While paid work outside of the home is readily measurable, housework is much more difficult to calculate. A number of models have been created to determine the value of work in the home, each with different conceptualizations of the process. There is currently no consensus on the appropriate approach.

These methods are generally divided into two main camps: the [[opportunity cost]] approach and the [[market value]] approach. The former views housework as equivalent to the amount one would make in the labour market. Housework is therefore evaluated at the wage rate that the member would otherwise have received. The market value approach bases the value of work done in the home on the cost of hiring someone to do the same job.{{sfn|Ferber|Birnbaum|1980|page=388}}&lt;ref name=ferber&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ferber|first=M.A.|author2=Birnbaum, B.G. |title=Housework: Priceless or Valueless?|journal=Review of Income and Wealth|year=1980|volume=26|page=388}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither method is without criticism.

The opportunity cost method is flawed in that it is difficult to pinpoint a comparator group. Not all workers have their choice of job, nor the number of hours they work.{{sfn|Ferber|Birnbaum|1980|pages=387–389}} Furthermore, wages vary depending on the location of the job and the gender of the employee, and the time it takes to get to and from work is not factored into the calculation.{{sfn|Ferber|Birnbaum|1980|pages=387–388 &amp; 391}} Age, level of education, and work experience are good predictors of what one would make in the labour market, but they are simply a subset of the aspects that can be used to calculate what a house worker would make.{{sfn|Ferber|Birnbaum|1980|pages=387–389}} Therefore, while many studies regarding the valuation of work in the home have attempted to come up with a standard wage and multiply it by the number of hours worked, there is no agreement as to how this standard wage should be determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldschmidt-Clermont|first=L.|title=Unpaid work in the household.|year=1983|publisher=International Labor Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The market value approach comes with its own set of flaws. One type of approach within this category is the Direct Output Method, which is based on the value of production rather than the hours of labour performed in the household.&lt;ref name="Ciscel 215"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ciscel|first=David H|author2=Heath, Julia |author3=Sharp, David |title=Back To Becker: valuing women's economic contribution from housework with household production functions|journal=Journal of Forensic Economics|date=Fall 1998|page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It solves the problem of having to come up with a standard wage,&lt;ref name="Ciscel 215"/&gt; but it is inherently difficult to obtain data on production output (e.g., number of pants folded) in the home. Furthermore, comparing the value of individual tasks performed to the average market price it would cost to get that same task completed may not be accurate, as multiple tasks can and are often done simultaneously in the home. To counteract this problem, one can construct a valuation based on the total wages of a housekeeper who performs a similar set of tasks.{{sfn|Ferber|Birnbaum|1980|pages=387–388 &amp; 391}} Yet, even then, the model does not take into account that men and women in the labour market often do housework, but hire housekeepers to do specific jobs that may require particular skills or expertise and demand a higher wage as a result.{{sfn|Ferber|Birnbaum|1980|pages=387–388 &amp; 391}}

Overall, while these methods have attempted to create ways to determine the value of household labour, there is no accepted approach.

===Gender Disparity===

Despite women's increased participation in the work force, several North American studies show that women still engage in significantly more housework activity than men.

A recent study by [[Statistics Canada]] indicates that while men and women participate (nearly) equally in the labour force, women spend far more hours on unpaid housework, such as child care and domestic work (including house cleaning, cooking, yard work and home maintenance).&lt;ref name="Milan 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Milan|first=Anne|title=Families, Living Arrangements and Unpaid Work: Women in Canada: A Gender-based Statistical Report|year=2011|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/89-503-x/2010001/article/11546-eng.htm.|accessdate=17 February 2014|publisher=Statistics Canada|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, it was found that men spend an average of 24.4 hours per week on child care, while women spend 50.1 hours on the same tasks.&lt;ref name="Milan 2011"/&gt; In the domestic work category, men conduct 8.3 hours of unpaid work, compared with 13.8 hours per week for women.&lt;ref name="Milan 2011"/&gt;

According to GPI Atlantic, “[t]ime use surveys reveal that Canadian women spend about twice as much time on total unpaid household work, including child and elder care, as men. They spend three times as long cooking and washing dishes, and nearly seven times as much time cleaning house and doing laundry”.&lt;ref name="GPI Atlantic 5"&gt;{{cite journal|last=GPI Atlantic|title=Gender Equality in the Genuine Progress Index|date=October 1999|page=5|url=http://www.gpiatlantic.org/pdf/misc/genderequality.pdf|accessdate=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is despite a doubling of the female labour force from 1960-1999.&lt;ref name="GPI Atlantic 5"/&gt;  The report argues that due to the invisibility of unpaid household production in traditional economic measures (like GDP), women are subject to wage and gender discrimination that has significant adverse effects on their economic well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=GPI Atlantic|title=Gender Equality in the Genuine Progress Index|date=October 1999|page=7|url=http://www.gpiatlantic.org/pdf/misc/genderequality.pdf|accessdate=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, the US Department of Commerce Bureau of Economic Analysis found a smaller discrepancy between genders on productive (but nonmarket) housework. According to their May 2012 report, women spend approximately 26 hours per week on home production, as opposed to 17 hours for men. Note, however, that the tasks included vary significantly between studies.&lt;ref name=Bridgman&gt;{{cite web|last=Bridgman|first=Benjamin|title=Accounting for Household Production in the National Accounts, 1965 - 2010|url=https://www.bea.gov/scb/pdf/2012/05%20May/0512_household.pd|publisher=Bureau of Economic Analysis Repor|accessdate=17 February 2014|archivedate=May 2012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
