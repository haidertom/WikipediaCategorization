'''''A Palace Concert''''' ({{zh|宮樂圖}}) is a Chinese [[Tang Dynasty]] [[silk painting]] showing ten [[Court lady|court ladies]] and two standing servant maidens around a large rectangular table. Some court ladies are depicted drinking tea, while others drink wine. The four women at the far end are presumably responsible for playing music and livening up the mood. The musical instruments depicted, from left to right, are bamboo pipes, [[guqin]], [[pipa]] and [[flute]]. One of the servant maidens plays a [[Clapper (musical instrument)|clapper]] to maintain beat. A small dog is depicted under the table. The artist and the precise year of the painting are unknown. The painting is housed in the [[National Palace Museum]] in [[Taipei]], Taiwan.

==Dating==
The hairstyles are combed in one direction on top, while others are combed in two directions and tied into knots around the ears. In addition to a floral headdress, these all indicate some of the popular Tang dynasty fashions.&lt;ref name="com"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.chinaonlinemuseum.com/painting-anonymous-a-palace-concert.php|title=A Palace Concert|publisher=China Online Museum|accessdate =30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The woven bamboo table, cusped crescent stools, winged wine cups and the style of the lute playing with a large pick showcase late Tang dynasty customs.&lt;ref name="com"/&gt;

'''Arthur David Jacobs''' (14 June 1922 – 13 December 1996) was an English musicologist, music critic, teacher, librettist and translator. Among his many books, two of the best known are his ''Penguin Dictionary of Music'', which was reprinted in several editions between 1958 and 1996, and his biography of [[Arthur Sullivan]], which was praised by critics in Britain and America. As an academic, Jacobs taught at the [[Royal Academy of Music]], at [[University of Huddersfield|Huddersfield Polytechnic]], and at universities in the US, Canada, and Australia.

==Life and career==
Jacobs was born in [[Manchester]], England, to Jewish parents, Alexander Susman Jacobs and his wife Estelle (''née'' Isaacs).&lt;ref&gt;Rubinstein, William D., Michael Jolles and Hilary L. Rubinstein. ''The Palgrave Dictionary of Anglo-Jewish History'', Palgrave Macmillan (2011), pp. 464–465&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at [[Manchester Grammar School]]&lt;ref name=ind&gt;Sadie, Stanley. [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-professor-arthur-jacobs-1315344.html "Obituary: Professor Arthur Jacobs"], ''[[The Independent]]'', 20 December 1996, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Merton College, Oxford]], taking an honours degree in 1946. In World War II he served in India and Burma with the British Army, reaching the rank of lieutenant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Levens|editor1-first=R.G.C.|title=Merton College Register 1900–1964|date=1964|publisher=Basil Blackwell|location=Oxford|page=305}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953 he married the writer Betty Upton Hughes. They had two sons, Michael Jacobs and Julian Jacobs.&lt;ref name=gale&gt;[http://galenet.galegroup.com/servlet/GLD/hits?r=d&amp;origSearch=true&amp;o=DataType&amp;n=10&amp;l=d&amp;c=2&amp;locID=wes_ttda&amp;secondary=false&amp;u=CA&amp;t=KW&amp;s=2&amp;TI=Gilbert+and+Sullivan&amp;SU=%22Music%22 "Arthur Jacobs"], ''Contemporary Authors Online'', Galenet (subscription required), accessed 22 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacobs was music critic of ''The [[Daily Express]]'' from 1947 to 1952, of ''The Sunday Citizen'' from 1959 to 1965, and of ''The [[Jewish Chronicle]]'' from 1963 to 1975. He reviewed records for ''Hi-Fi News and Record Review'' and ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' and wrote for the arts section of ''[[The Financial Times]]''.  He was deputy editor of ''[[Opera (magazine)|Opera]]'' magazine from 1961 to 1971 and served on its editorial board from 1971 until his death.&lt;ref name=ind/&gt;&lt;ref name=gale/&gt;&lt;ref name=times&gt;"Arthur Jacobs", ''[[The Times]]'', 20 December 1996, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

For ''[[The Musical Times]]'', between 1949 and 1996, Jacobs wrote on a wide variety of musical topics, including the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]], the [[Three Choirs Festival]], Russian song, ''[[The Gypsy Baron]]'', ''[[Thespis (opera)|Thespis]]'', the [[Metropolitan Opera]], [[Leonard Bernstein]], ''[[Così fan tutte]]'', ''[[Trial by Jury]]'', [[Glyndebourne Festival Opera|Glyndebourne]], [[Otto Klemperer]], and composers from [[Handel]] to [[César Franck]] to [[Elgar]] to [[Janáček]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Musical Times'', ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1964 to 1979, Jacobs was a lecturer at the [[Royal Academy of Music]], teaching the history of opera.  He was head of the music department of Huddersfield Polytechnic (now the [[University of Huddersfield]]) 1979–84, where he was appointed to a personal professorship in 1984. Overseas, Jacobs was visiting professor at [[Temple University]] ([[Philadelphia]]) in 1970 and 1971, at [[McMaster University]] ([[Hamilton, Ontario]]) in 1975 and 1983, and at the [[University of Queensland]] ([[Brisbane]]) in 1985.&lt;ref name=gale/&gt; After the Queensland post ended, he retired to [[Oxford]], where he died at the age of 74.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

==Librettist and translator==
Jacobs wrote the libretto for [[Nicholas Maw]]'s 1964 opera, ''One Man Show'', based on a short story by [[Saki]].&lt;ref name=ind/&gt; His colleague [[Stanley Sadie]] said of him, "Opera was always at the centre of his interests. He was a firm believer that it was meant to be fully understood, and that meant it should be presented in English to English-speaking audiences. He was a good linguist himself and translated more than 20 operas … in a fluent and direct style that sometimes betrayed (though not often inaptly) his early love of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]."&lt;ref name=ind/&gt; He made English translations of German, Italian, French and Russian opera libretti, including [[Alban Berg|Berg]]'s ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'', [[Berlioz]]'s, ''[[Benvenuto Cellini (opera)|Benvenuto Cellini]]'', [[Donizetti]]'s, ''[[L'elisir d'amore]]'', [[Gluck]]'s ''[[Iphigenie en Aulide]]'', [[Handel]]'s ''[[Riccardo Primo]]'', [[Monteverdi]]'s, ''[[L'Incoronazione di Poppea]]'', [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Die schweigsame Frau]]'', [[Rossini]]'s ''[[La Cenerentola]]'', ''[[L'italiana in Algeri]]'', and ''[[Il Turco in Italia]]'', [[Schoenberg]]'s ''[[Erwartung]]'', [[Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[The Queen of Spades (opera)|The Queen of Spades]]'',&lt;ref name=gale/&gt; and [[Verdi]]'s ''[[Don Carlos]]''.&lt;ref name=mt&gt;Jacobs, Arthur. "On Translating Opera",''The Musical Times'', January 1961, pp. 23–25&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for ''[[The Musical Times]]'' in 1961, Jacobs gave examples of stilted translations and contrasted them with vital and natural-sounding ones. He instanced a line from ''[[Tosca]]'', "Ah, finalmente! Nel terror mio stolto/ Vedea ceffi di birro in ogni volto!", gave a literal translation ("Ah! at last! In my stupid terror I saw those ugly police snouts in every face") and contrasted it with the original early-20th-century English translation: "Ah! I have baulked them! Dread imagination/ Made me quake with uncalled for perturbation."&lt;ref name=mt/&gt;

Though his work failed to garner substantial attention during his life, Schopenhauer has had a posthumous impact across various disciplines, including philosophy, literature, and science.

This awareness of the lack of free will keeps me from taking myself and my fellow men too seriously as acting and deciding individuals, and from losing my temper."

== Life ==
=== Early life ===
[[File:Gdansk Schopenhauer House.jpg|thumb|upright|Schopenhauer's birthplace house, ul. Św. Ducha (formerly Heiligegeistgasse)]]
Schopenhauer was born on 22 February 1788, in the city of Danzig (then part of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]; present day [[Gdańsk]], [[Poland]]) on Heiligegeistgasse (known in the present day as Św. Ducha 47), the son of [[Johanna Schopenhauer]] (née Trosiener) and Heinrich Floris Schopenhauer,&lt;ref name="Google Books"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fW5Dl-tUS_oC&amp;pg=PR30&amp;dq=Schopenhauer+%2222+February%22|title=Chronology|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|author2=Günter Zöller|author3=Eric F. J. Payne|year=1999|work=Prize Essay on the Freedom of the Will|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|page=xxx | isbn=978-0-521-57766-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; both descendants of wealthy German-Dutch [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]] families.  Both of them weren't very religious,&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; supported the [[French Revolution]],&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; were [[Republicanism|republican]], [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] and [[Anglophilia|Anglophile]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated9"&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;  When Danzig became part of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] in 1793, Heinrich moved to [[Hamburg]] - a free city with republican constitution, protected by Britain and Holland against Prussian aggression - although his firm continued trading in Danzig where most of their extended families remained.  [[Adele Schopenhauer|Adele]], Arthur's only sibling was born on 12 July 1797.

In 1797 Arthur was sent to [[Le Havre]] to live for two years with the family of his father's business associate, Grégoire de Blésimaire.  He seemed to enjoy his stay there, learned to speak French fluently and started a friendship with Jean Anthime Grégoire de Blésimaire, his peer, which lasted for a large part of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;  As early as 1799, Arthur started playing the flute.&lt;ref name="Flute" /&gt;{{rp|30}}  In 1803 he joined his parents on their long tour of [[Holland]], Britain, [[France]], [[Switzerland]], [[Austria]] and [[Prussia]]; it was mostly a pleasure tour although Heinrich also visited some of his business associates.  Heinrich gave his son a choice - he could stay at home and start preparations for university education, or he could travel with them and then continue his merchant education.  Arthur would later deeply regret his choice because he found his merchant training tedious.  He spent twelve weeks of the tour attending a school in [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]] where he was very unhappy and appalled by very strict but intellectually shallow [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] religiosity which he would continue to sharply criticize later in life despite his general Anglophilia.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also under great pressure from his father who became very critical of his educational results.  In fact Heinrich Floris became so fussy that even his wife started to doubt his mental health.&lt;ref name="autogenerated43"&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1805, Heinrich Floris died by drowning in a canal by their home in Hamburg.  Although it was possible that his death was accident, his wife and son believed that it was suicide because he was very prone to unsociable behavior, [[anxiety]] and [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] which became especially pronounced in his last months of life.&lt;ref&gt;Safranski (1990), p. 12. "There was in the father's life some dark and vague source of fear which later made him hurl himself to his death from the attic of his house in Hamburg."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;  Arthur showed similar moodiness since his youth and often acknowledged that he inherited it from his father; there were also several other instances of serious mental health issues on his father's side of family.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;  His mother Johanna was generally described as vivacious and sociable.&lt;ref name="autogenerated9"/&gt;  Despite the hardships, Schopenhauer seemed to like his father and later mentioned him always in a positive light.&lt;ref name="autogenerated43"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;  Heinrich Schopenhauer left the family with a decent inheritance that was split in three among Johanna and the children. Arthur Schopenhauer would be entitled to control of his part when he reached the age of majority.  He invested it conservatively in government bonds and earned annual interest that was more than double the salary of a university professor.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ArthurSchopenhauer.jpg|thumb|left|Schopenhauer as a youth]]
Arthur endured two long years of drudgery as a merchant in honor of his dead father, and because of his own doubts about being too old to start a life of a scholar.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of his prior education was practical merchant training and he had some trouble with learning Latin which was a prerequisite for any academic career.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;  His mother soon moved with his sister Adele to [[Weimar]]—then the centre of [[German literature]]—to enjoy social life among celebrated writers and artists.  Arthur lived in Hamburg with his friend Jean Anthime who was also studying to become a merchant.

After quitting his merchant apprenticeship, with some encouragement from his mother, he dedicated himself to studies at the [[Gotha]] [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] ({{Interlanguage link multi|Gymnasium Ernestinum Gotha|de|3=Ernestinum Gotha|lt=Gymnasium illustre zu Gotha}}) in [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]], but he also enjoyed social life among local nobility spending large amounts of money which caused concern to his frugal mother.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;  He left Gymnasium after writing a satirical poem about one of the lecturers.  Although Arthur claimed that he left voluntarily, his mother's letter indicates that he was expelled.&lt;ref name="autogenerated129"&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education ===
He moved to Weimar but didn't live with his mother who even tried to discourage him from coming by explaining that they wouldn't get along very well.&lt;ref name="autogenerated131"&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;  Their relationship deteriorated even further due to their temperamental differences.  He accused his mother of being financially irresponsible, flirtatious and seeking to remarry, which he considered an insult to his father's memory.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated131"/&gt;  His mother, while professing her love to him, criticized him sharply for being moody, tactless, and argumentative—and urged him to improve his behavior so he would not alienate people.&lt;ref name="autogenerated129"/&gt;  Arthur concentrated on his studies which were now going very well and he also enjoyed the usual social life such as balls, parties and theater.  By that time Johanna's famous salon was well established among local intellectuals and dignitaries, most celebrated of them being [[Goethe]].  Arthur attended her parties, usually when he knew that Goethe would be there—though the famous writer and statesman didn't even seem to notice the young and unknown student.  It is possible that Goethe kept distance because Johanna warned him about her son's depressive and combative nature, or because Goethe was then on bad terms with Arthur's language instructor and roommate, [[Franz Passow]].&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;  Schopenhauer was also captivated by the beautiful [[Karoline Jagemann]], mistress of [[Karl August, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]], and he wrote to her his only known love poem.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite his later celebration of asceticism and negative views of sexuality, Schopenhauer occasionally had sexual affairs, usually with women of lower social status, such as servants, actresses, and sometimes even paid prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;  In a letter to his friend Anthime he claims that such affairs continued even in his mature age and admits that he had two out-of-wedlock daughters (born in 1819 and 1836), both of whom died in infancy.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;  In their youthful correspondence Arthur and Anthime were somewhat boastful and competitive about their sexual exploits—but Schopenhauer seemed aware that women usually didn’t find him very charming or physically attractive, and his desires often remained unfulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

He left Weimar to become a student at the [[Georg August University of Göttingen|University of Göttingen]] in 1809.  There are no written reasons about why Schopenhauer chose that university instead of then more famous [[University of Jena]] but Göttingen was known as a more modern, scientifically oriented, with less attention given to theology.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;  Law or medicine were usual choices for young men of Schopenhauer's status who also needed career and income; he choose [[medicine]] due to his [[Natural science|scientific interests]].  Among his notable professors were [[Bernhard Friedrich Thibaut]], [[Arnold Hermann Ludwig Heeren]], [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]], [[Friedrich Stromeyer]], [[Heinrich Adolf Schrader]], [[Johann Tobias Mayer]] and [[Konrad Johann Martin Langenbeck]].&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 141-144&lt;/ref&gt;  He studied [[metaphysics]], [[psychology]] and [[logic]] under [[Gottlob Ernst Schulze]], the author of ''[[Aenesidemus (book)|Aenesidemus]]'', who made a strong impression and advised him to concentrate on [[Plato]] and [[Immanuel Kant]].&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; He decided to switch from medicine to philosophy around 1810-11 and he left Göttingen which didn't have a strong philosophy program (besides Schulze the only other philosophy professor was [[Friedrich Bouterwek]] whom Schopenhauer disliked&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;).  He didn't regret his medicinal and scientific studies. He claimed that they were necessary for a philosopher, and even in Berlin he attended more lectures in sciences than in philosophy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated170"&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;  During his days at Göttingen, he spent a lot of time studying, but also continued his flute playing and social life. His friends included [[Friedrich Gotthilf Osann]], [[Karl Witte]], [[Christian Charles Josias von Bunsen]], and [[William Backhouse Astor Sr.]].&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;

He arrived to the newly founded [[University of Berlin]] for the winter semester of 1811-12.  At the same time his mother just started her literary career; she published her first book in 1810, a biography of her friend [[Karl Ludwig Fernow]], which was a critical success.  Arthur attended lectures by the prominent [[post-Kantian]] philosopher [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] but quickly found many points of disagreement with his ''Wissenschaftslehre'' and he also found his lectures tedious and hard to understand.&lt;ref name="autogenerated159"&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;  He later mentioned Fichte only in critical, negative terms&lt;ref name="autogenerated159"/&gt;—seeing his philosophy as a lower quality version of Kant's and considering it useful only because Fichte's poor arguments unintentionally highlighted some failings of Kantianism.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 165-169&lt;/ref&gt;  He also attended the lectures of the famous theologian [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] whom he also quickly came to dislike.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;  His notes and comments on Schleiermacher's lectures show that Schopenhauer was becoming very critical of religion and moving towards [[atheism]].&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;  He learned a lot by self-directed reading; besides Plato, Kant and Fichte he also read the works of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], [[Jakob Friedrich Fries|Fries]], [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi|Jacobi]], [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]], [[John Locke|Locke]], and a lot of current scientific literature.&lt;ref name="autogenerated170"/&gt;  He attended philological courses by [[August Böckh]] and [[Friedrich August Wolf]] and continued his naturalistic interests with courses by [[Martin Heinrich Klaproth]], [[Paul Erman]], [[Johann Elert Bode]], [[Ernst Gottfried Fischer]], [[Johann Horkel]], [[Friedrich Christian Rosenthal]] and [[Hinrich Lichtenstein]] (Lichtenstein was also a friend whom he met at one of his mother's parties in Weimar).&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 171-174&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early work ===
Schopenhauer left Berlin in a rush in 1813 fearing that the city could be attacked and that he could be pressed into military service as Prussia just joined the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|war against France]].&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;  He returned to Weimar but left after less than a month disgusted by the fact that his mother was now living with her supposed lover, Georg Friedrich Conrad Ludwig Müller von Gerstenbergk, a civil servant fourteen years younger than her; he considered the relationship an act of infidelity to his father's memory.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;  He settled for a while in [[Rudolstadt]] hoping that no army would pass through the small town.  He spent his time in solitude, [[hiking]] in the mountains and the [[Thuringian forest]] and writing his dissertation, ''[[On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason]]''.  He completed his dissertation at about the same time as the French army was defeated at the [[Battle of Leipzig]].  He became irritated by the arrival of soldiers to the town and accepted his mother's invitation to visit her in Weimar.  She tried to convince him that her relationship with Gerstenbergk was platonic and that she had no intentions of remarrying.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;  But Schopenhauer remained suspicious and often came in conflict with Gerstenbergk because he considered him untalented, pretentious, and [[German nationalism|nationalistic]].&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;  His mother just published her second book, ''Reminiscences of a Journey in the Years 1803, 1804, and 1805'', a description of their family tour of Europe, which quickly became a hit.  She found his dissertation incomprehensible and said it was unlikely that anyone would ever buy a copy. In a fit of temper Arthur told her that people would read his work long after the "rubbish" she wrote was totally forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://courseweb.stthomas.edu/paschons/language_http/essays/Schopenhauer.html |title=Schopenhauer: A Pessimist in the Optimistic Month of May |publisher=Germanic American Institute |accessdate=12 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611051923/http://courseweb.stthomas.edu/paschons/language_http/essays/schopenhauer.html |archivedate=11 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/selectedessaysof033377mbp/selectedessaysof033377mbp_djvu.txt |title=Full text of "Selected Essays Of Schopenhauer" |publisher=Archive.org |accessdate=12 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, although they considered her novels of dubious quality, the [[F.A. Brockhaus AG|Brockhaus publishing firm]] held her in high esteem because they consistently sold well. Hans Brockhaus (1888-1965) later claimed that his predecessors "...saw nothing in this manuscript, but wanted to please one of our best-selling authors by publishing her son's work. We published more and more of her son Arthur's work and today nobody remembers Johanna, but her son's works are in steady demand and contribute to Brockhaus'[s] reputation."&lt;ref name=mom&gt;{{citation |last=Fredriksson |first=Einar H. |contribution=The Dutch Publishing Scene: Elsevier and North-Holland |pages=61–76 |title=A Century of Science Publishing: A Collection of Essays |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mwWrRYyck6AC&amp;pg=PA61 |editor-last=Fredriksson |editor-first=Einar H. |display-editors=0 |isbn=978-4-274-90424-0 |publisher=IOS Press |location=Amsterdam |year=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He kept large portraits of the pair in his office in [[Leipzig]] for the edification of his new editors.&lt;ref name=mom/&gt;

Also contrary to his mother's prediction, Schopenhauer's dissertation made an impression on Goethe to whom he sent it as a gift.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;  Although it is doubtful that Goethe agreed with Schopenhauer's philosophical positions he was impressed by his intellect and extensive scientific education.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 243&lt;/ref&gt;  Their subsequent meetings and correspondence were a great honor to a young philosopher who was finally acknowledged by his intellectual hero.  They mostly discussed Goethe's newly published (and somewhat lukewarmly received) work on [[Theory of Colours|color theory]].  Schopenhauer soon started writing his own treatise on the subject, ''[[On Vision and Colors]]'', which in many points differed from his teacher's.  Although they remained polite towards each other, their growing theoretical disagreements – and especially Schopenhauer's tactless criticisms and extreme self-confidence – soon made Goethe become distant again and after 1816 their correspondence became less frequent.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 247-265&lt;/ref&gt;  Schopenhauer later admitted that he was greatly hurt by this rejection, but he continued to praise Goethe, and considered his color theory a great introduction to his own.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 252&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important experience during his stay in Weimar was his acquaintance with Friedrich Majer – a historian of religion, [[Orientalism|orientalist]] and disciple of [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] – who introduced him to the [[Eastern philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 266&lt;/ref&gt;  Schopenhauer was immediately impressed by the ''[[Upanishads]]'' and the [[Buddha]] and put them at par with Plato and Kant.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 272&lt;/ref&gt;  He continued his studies by reading the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', an amateurish German journal ''Asiatisches Magazin'' and ''Asiatick Researches'' by [[The Asiatic Society]].&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;  Although he loved [[Hinduism|Hindu]] texts he was more interested in [[Buddhism]] which he came to regard as the best religion.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;  However, his early studies were constrained by the lack of adequate literature, and were mostly restricted to [[Early Buddhism]]. He also claimed that he formulated most of his ideas independently, and only later realized the similarities with Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 274-276&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Arthur Schopenhauer Portrait by Ludwig Sigismund Ruhl 1815.jpeg|thumb|Schopenhauer in 1815. Portrait by Ludwig Sigismund Ruhl]]
As the relationship with his mother fell to a new low he left Weimar and moved to [[Dresden]] in May 1814.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  He continued his philosophical studies, enjoyed the cultural life, socialized with intellectuals and engaged in sexual affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 284&lt;/ref&gt;  His friends in Dresden were [[Johann Gottlob von Quandt]], [[Friedrich Laun]], [[Karl Christian Friedrich Krause]] and Ludwig Sigismund Ruhl, a young painter who made a romanticized portrait of him in which he improved some of Schopenhauer's unattractive physical features.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 278&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 283&lt;/ref&gt;  His criticisms of local artists occasionally caused public quarrels when he ran into them in public.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 282&lt;/ref&gt;  However, his main occupation during his stay in Dresden was his seminal philosophical work, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', which he started writing in 1814 and finished in 1818.&lt;ref&gt;Although the first volume was published by December 1818, it was printed with a title page erroneously giving the year as 1819 (see {{citation |last=Braunschweig |first=Yael |contribution=Schopenhauer and Rossinian Universiality: On the Italianate in Schopenhauer's Metaphysics of Music &lt;!--|pp=283–304--&gt; |title=The Invention of Beethoven and Rossini: Historiography, Analysis, Criticism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NQ_3AQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |editor-last=Mathew |editor-first=Nicholas |editor2-last=Walton |editor2-first=Benjamin |display-editors=0 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=[[Cambridge, England|Cambridge]] |date=2013 |isbn=978-0-521-76805-4 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=NQ_3AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA297 297, n. 7]}}).&lt;/ref&gt;  He was recommended to [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]] by Baron Ferdinand von Biedenfeld, an acquaintance of his mother.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 285&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the publisher accepted his manuscript, Schopenhauer made a poor impression because of his quarrelsome and fussy attitude and very poor sales of the book after it was published in December 1818.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 285-289&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1818, while waiting for his book to be published and conveniently escaping an affair with a maid that caused an unwanted pregnancy,&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 342&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer left Dresden for a yearlong vacation in [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 346&lt;/ref&gt;  He visited [[Venice]], [[Bologna]], [[Florence]], [[Naples]] and [[Milan]], travelling alone or accompanied by mostly English tourists he met.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 350&lt;/ref&gt;  He spent winter months in [[Rome]] where he accidentally met his acquaintance [[Karl Witte]] and engaged in numerous quarrels with German tourists in [[Antico Caffè Greco|Caffe Greco]], among them [[Johann Friedrich Böhmer]] who also mentioned his insulting remarks and unpleasant character.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 348-349&lt;/ref&gt;  He enjoyed art, architecture, ancient ruins, attended plays and operas, continued his philosophical contemplation and love affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 346-350&lt;/ref&gt;  One of his affairs supposedly became serious, and for a while he contemplated marriage to a rich Italian noblewoman—but despite his mentioning this several times, no details are known and it may have been Schopenhauer exaggerating.&lt;ref&gt;Safranski, Rüdiger (1991) Schopenhauer and the Wild Years of Philosophy. Harvard University Press. p. 244&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 345&lt;/ref&gt;  He corresponded regularly with his sister Adele and became close to her as her relationship with Johanna and Gerstenbergk also deteriorated.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 344&lt;/ref&gt;  She informed him about their financial troubles as the banking house of A. L. Muhl in Danzig – in which her mother invested their whole savings and Arthur a third of his – was near bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 351&lt;/ref&gt;  Arthur offered to share his assets but his mother refused and became further enraged by his insulting comments.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 352&lt;/ref&gt;  The women managed to receive only thirty percent of their savings while Arthur, using his business knowledge, took a suspicious and aggressive stance towards the banker and eventually received his part in full.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 354-356&lt;/ref&gt;  The affair additionally worsened the relationships among all three members of Schopenhauer family.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 354&lt;/ref&gt;

He shortened his stay in Italy because of the trouble with Muhl and returned to Dresden.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 356&lt;/ref&gt;  Disturbed by the financial risk and the lack of responses to his book he decided to take an academic position since it provided him both with income and the opportunity to promote his views.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 358&lt;/ref&gt;  He contacted his friends at universities in Heidelberg, Göttingen and Berlin and found [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]] most attractive.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 358-362&lt;/ref&gt;  He scheduled his lectures to coincide with those of the famous philosopher [[G. W. F. Hegel]], whom Schopenhauer described as a "clumsy charlatan".&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, Arthur. Author's preface to "On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of sufficient reason," p. 1 ([[:s:On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason|On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason]] on Wikisource.)&lt;/ref&gt;  He was especially appalled by Hegel's supposedly poor knowledge of natural sciences and tried to engage him in a quarrel about it already at his test lecture in March 1820.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 363&lt;/ref&gt;  Hegel was also facing political suspicions at the time when many progressive professors were [[Carlsbad Decrees|fired]], while Schopenhauer carefully mentioned in his application that he had no interest in politics.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 362&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite their differences and the arrogant request to schedule lectures at the same time as his own, Hegel still voted to accept Schopenhauer to the university.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 365&lt;/ref&gt;  However, only five students turned up to Schopenhauer's lectures, and he dropped out of [[academia]]. A late essay, ''On University Philosophy'', expressed his resentment towards the work conducted in academies.

=== Later life ===
After his academic failure he continued to travel extensively, visiting [[Leipzig]], [[Nuremberg]], [[Stuttgart]], [[Schaffhausen]], [[Vevey]], [[Milan]] and spending eight months in Florence.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 411&lt;/ref&gt;  However, before he left for his three-year travel, he had an incident with his Berlin neighbor, forty-seven-year-old seamstress Caroline Louise Marquet.  The details of the August 1821 incident are unknown. He claimed that he just pushed her from his entrance after she rudely refused to leave, and she purposely fell on the ground so she could sue him.  She claimed that he attacked her so violently that she had become paralyzed on her right side and unable to work.  She immediately sued him, and the process lasted until May 1827, when a court found Schopenhauer guilty and forced him to pay her an annual pension until her death in 1842.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 408-411&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer enjoyed Italy, where he studied art and socialized with Italian and English nobles.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 411-414&lt;/ref&gt;  It was his last visit to the country.  He left for [[Munich]] and stayed there for a year, mostly recuperating from various health issues, some of them possibly caused by venereal diseases (the treatment his doctor used suggests [[syphilis]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 415&lt;/ref&gt;  He contacted publishers offering to translate Hume into German and Kant into English but his proposals were declined.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 417&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 422&lt;/ref&gt;  Returning to Berlin he began to study Spanish in order to read some of his favorite authors in their original language.  He liked [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca]], [[Lope de Vega]], [[Miguel de Cervantes]], and especially [[Baltasar Gracián]].&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 420&lt;/ref&gt;  He also made failed attempts to publish his translations of their works.  Few attempts to revive his lectures – again scheduled at the same time as Hegel's – also failed, as did his inquiries about relocating to other universities.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 429-432&lt;/ref&gt;

During his Berlin years Schopenhauer occasionally mentioned his desire to marry and have a family.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 404&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 432&lt;/ref&gt;  For a while he was unsuccessfully courting 17-year-old Flora Weiss, who was 22 years younger than him.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 433&lt;/ref&gt;  His unpublished writings from that time show that he was already very critical of [[monogamy]] but still not advocating [[polygyny]] – instead musing about a [[Polyamory|polyamorous]] relationship he called ''tetragamy''.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 404-408&lt;/ref&gt;  He had an on and off relationship with a young dancer Caroline Richter (she also used surname Medon after one of her ex-lovers).&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 403&lt;/ref&gt;  They met when he was 33 and she was 19 and working at the Berlin Opera. She already had numerous lovers and an out-of-wedlock son, and later gave birth to another son, this time to an unnamed foreign diplomat. (She soon had another pregnancy but it was stillborn).&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 403-404&lt;/ref&gt;  As Schopenhauer was preparing to escape Berlin in 1831, due to [[cholera]] epidemic, he offered to take her with him on the condition that she leaves her young son.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;  She refused and he went alone; in his will he left her a significant sum of money but insisted that it should not be in any way spent on her second son.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

Schopenhauer claimed that in his last year in Berlin he had a prophetic dream which urged him to escape the city.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 436&lt;/ref&gt;  As he arrived in his new home in [[Frankfurt]] he supposedly had another supernatural experience, an apparition of his dead father and his mother who was still alive.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;  This experience led him to spend some time investigating [[paranormal]] phenomena and [[Magic (supernatural)|magic]].  He was quite critical of the available studies and claimed that they were mostly ignorant or fraudulent, but he did believe that there are authentic cases of such phenomena and tried to explain them through his metaphysics as manifestations of the will.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 437-452&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his arrival in Frankfurt he experienced a period of depression and declining health.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 454&lt;/ref&gt;  He renewed his correspondence with his mother, and she seemed concerned that he might commit suicide like his father.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 454-457&lt;/ref&gt;  By now Johanna and Adele were living very modestly. Johanna's writing didn’t bring her much income, and her popularity was waning.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 458&lt;/ref&gt;  Their correspondence remained reserved, and Arthur Schopenhauer seemed undisturbed by her death in 1838.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 460&lt;/ref&gt;  His relationship with his sister grew closer and he corresponded with her until she died in 1849.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 463&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1832 Schopenhauer left Frankfurt for [[Mannheim]] but returned in July 1833 to remain there for the rest of his life, except for a few short journeys.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 464&lt;/ref&gt;  He lived alone except for a succession of pet [[poodle]]s named [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]] and Butz.  In 1836, he published ''[[On the Will in Nature]]''.  In 1836 he sent his essay ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]'' to the contest of the ''Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences'' and won the prize next year.  He sent another essay, ''[[On the Basis of Morality]]'', to the ''Royal Danish Society for Scientific Studies'' but didn’t win the prize despite being the only contestant.  The Society was appalled that several distinguished contemporary philosophers were mentioned in a very offensive manner, claimed that the essay missed the point and that the arguments were not adequate.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 483&lt;/ref&gt;  Schopenhauer, who was very self-confident that he will win, was enraged by this rejection.  He published both essays as ''The Two Basic Problems of Ethics'' and in the preface to the second edition of this book, in 1860, he was still pouring insults on Royal Danish Society.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 484&lt;/ref&gt; First edition, published in 1841, again failed to draw attention to his philosophy.  Two years later, after some negotiations, he managed to convince his publisher, Brockhaus, to print the second, updated edition of ''The World as Will and Representation''.  The book was again mostly ignored and few reviews were mixed or negative. 
 
However, Schopenhauer did start to attract some followers, mostly outside academia, among practical professionals (several of them were lawyers) who pursued private philosophical studies. He jokingly referred to them as ''evangelists'' and ''apostles''.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 504&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the most active early followers was [[Julius Frauenstädt]] who wrote numerous articles promoting Schopenhauer's philosophy.  He was also instrumental in finding another publisher after Brockhaus refused to publish ''Parerga and Paralipomena'' believing that it would be another failure.&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 506&lt;/ref&gt;  Though Schopenhauer later stopped corresponding with him, claiming that he did not adhere closely enough to his ideas, Frauenstädt continued to promote Schopehnauer's work.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 507-508&lt;/ref&gt;   They renewed their communication in 1859 and Schopenhauer named him heir for his literary estate.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 508&lt;/ref&gt;   He also became the editor of the first collected works of Schopenhauer.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt;

In 1848 Schopenhauer witnessed [[German revolutions of 1848–49|violent upheaval]] in Frankfurt after General [[Hans Adolf Erdmann von Auerswald]] and Prince [[Felix Lichnowsky]] were murdered.  He became worried for his own safety and property.&lt;ref name="auto6"&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 514&lt;/ref&gt; Even earlier in life he had such worries and kept a sword and loaded pistols near his bed to defend himself from thieves.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 465&lt;/ref&gt;  He gave a friendly welcome to Austrian soldiers who wanted to shoot revolutionaries from his window and as they were leaving he gave one of the officers his opera glasses to help him monitor rebels.&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt;  The rebellion passed without any loss to Schopenhauer and he later praised [[Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Grätz]] for restoring order.&lt;ref name="auto7"&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 515&lt;/ref&gt;  He even modified his will, leaving a large part of his property to a Prussian fund that helped soldiers who became invalids while fighting rebellion in 1848 or the families of soldiers who died in battle.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 517&lt;/ref&gt;  As [[Young Hegelians]] were advocating change and progress Schopenhauer claimed that misery is natural for humans—and that even if some utopian society were established, people would still fight each other out of boredom, or would starve due to overpopulation.&lt;ref name="auto7"/&gt;

[[File:Schopenhauer.jpg|thumb|left|1855 painting of Schopenhauer by Jules Lunteschütz]]
In 1851 Schopenhauer published ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', which, as the title says, contains essays that are supplementary to his main work, and are mostly comprehensible to readers unfamiliar with his earlier philosophy.  It was his first successful, widely read book, partly due to the work of his disciples who wrote praising reviews.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 524&lt;/ref&gt;  The essays that proved most popular were the ones that actually didn’t contain the basic philosophical ideas of his system.&lt;ref name="auto8"&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 539&lt;/ref&gt;  Many academic philosophers considered him a great stylist and cultural critic but didn’t take his philosophy seriously.&lt;ref name="auto8"/&gt;  His early critics liked to point out similarities of his ideas to those Fichte and Schelling,&lt;ref name="auto9"&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 381-386&lt;/ref&gt; or claim that there are numerous contradictions in his philosophy.&lt;ref name="auto9"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 537&lt;/ref&gt;  Both criticisms enraged Schopenhauer. However, he was becoming less interested in intellectual fights, but encouraged his disciples to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 525&lt;/ref&gt;  His private notes and correspondence show that he acknowledged some of the criticisms regarding contradictions, inconsistencies, and vagueness in his philosophy, but claimed that he wasn’t concerned about harmony and agreement in his propositions&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 394&lt;/ref&gt; and that some of his ideas shouldn’t be taken literally but instead as metaphors.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 510&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic philosophers were also starting to notice his work.  In 1856 University of Leipzig sponsored an essay contest about Schopenhauer's philosophy which was won by [[Rudolf Seydel]]’s very critical essay.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 536&lt;/ref&gt;  Schopenhauer's friend [[Jules Lunteschütz]] made a first of his four portraits of him – which Schopenhauer didn’t particularly like – that was soon sold to a wealthy landowner Carl Ferdinand Wiesike who built a house to display it.  Schopenhauer seemed flattered and amused by this, and would claim that it was his first chapel.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 540&lt;/ref&gt;  As his fame increased copies of his paintings and photographs were being sold and admirers were visiting the places where he lived and wrote his works.  People visited Frankfurt's ''Englischer Hof'' to observe him dining. Admirers gave him gifts and asked for autographs.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 541&lt;/ref&gt;  He complained, however, that he still felt isolated due to his not very social nature and the fact that many of his good friends already died from old age.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 542&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Schopenhauer-ffm001.jpg|thumb|right|Grave at Frankfurt ''Hauptfriedhof'']]
He remained healthy in his old age which he attributed to regular walks no matter the weather, and always getting enough sleep.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 544-545&lt;/ref&gt;  He had a great appetite and could read without glasses but his [[Hearing loss|hearing]] was declining since his youth and he developed problems with [[rheumatism]].&lt;ref name="auto10"&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 545&lt;/ref&gt;  He remained active and lucid, continued his reading, writing and correspondences until his death.&lt;ref name="auto10"/&gt;  The numerous notes that he made during these years, amongst others on aging, were published [[Posthumous publication|posthumously]] under the title ''Senilia''.  In the spring of 1860 his health started to decline, he experienced shortness of breath and heart palpitations; in September he suffered inflammation of the lungs and although he was starting to recover he remained very weak.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 546&lt;/ref&gt;  His last friend to visit him was Wilhelm Gwinner and according to him Schopenhauer was concerned that he won’t be able to finish his planned additions to ''Parerga and Paralipomena'' but was at peace with dying.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 546-547&lt;/ref&gt;  He died of [[Respiratory failure|pulmonary-respiratory failure]],&lt;ref&gt;Dale Jacquette, ''The Philosophy of Schopenhauer'', Routledge, 2015: "Biographical sketch".&lt;/ref&gt; on 21 September 1860 while sitting at home on his couch. He was 72.&lt;ref&gt;''Schopenhauer: his life and philosophy'' by H. Zimmern – 1932 – G. Allen &amp; Unwin.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==

=== The world as representation ===
Schopenhauer saw his philosophy as a continuation of that of Kant, and used the results of his epistemological investigations, that is, [[transcendental idealism]], as starting point for his own:
{{Quotation|My philosophy is founded on that of Kant, and therefore presupposes a thorough knowledge of it. Kant's teaching produces in the mind of everyone who has comprehended it a fundamental change which is so great that it may be regarded as an intellectual new-birth. It alone is able really to remove the inborn realism which proceeds from the original character of the intellect, which neither Berkeley nor Malebranche succeed in doing, for they remain too much in the universal, while Kant goes into the particular, and indeed in a way that is quite unexampled both before and after him, and which has quite a peculiar, and, we might say, immediate effect upon the mind in consequence of which it undergoes a complete undeception, and forthwith looks at all things in another light. Only in this way can anyone become susceptible to the more positive expositions which I have to give.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=World as Will and Representation|last=Arthur Schopenhauer|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|volume=Vol. 1, Preface of the First Edition|location=|pages=|translator-first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Kant had argued the empirical world is merely a complex of appearances whose existence and connection occur only in our representations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|nopp=|at=§ 52c|translator-last=Paul Carus}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer reiterates this in the first sentence of his main work: "The world is my representation." We do not draw empirical laws from nature, but prescribe them to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|at=Last sentence of § 36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer praises Kant for his distinction between appearance and the [[Thing-in-itself|things-in-themselves]] that appear, whereas the general consensus in [[German Idealism]] was that this was the weakest spot of Kant's theory,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason|author1=David E. Cartwright |author2=Edward E. Erdmann|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=xvi–xvii|quote=He had also rehearsed for the first time his physiological arguments for the intellectual nature of intuition [Anschauung, objective perception] in his On Vision and Colours, and he had discussed how his philosophy was corroborated by the sciences in On Will in Nature. ... Like the German Idealists, Schopenhauer is convinced that Kant’s great unknown, the thing in itself, is the weak point of the critical philosophy.}}&lt;/ref&gt; since according to Kant causality can find application on objects of experience only, and consequently, things-in-themselves cannot be the cause of appearances, as Kant argued. The inadmissibility of this reasoning was also acknowledged by Schopenhauer. He insisted that this distinction was a true conclusion, drawn from false premises.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|volume=Vol. 1 Criticism of the Kantian philosophy|location=|pages=|translator-last=J. Kemp|quote=With the proof of the thing in itself it has happened to Kant precisely as with that of the a priori nature of the law of causality. Both doctrines are true, but their proof is false. They thus belong to the class of true conclusions from false premises.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theory of perception ===
In November 1813 [[Goethe]] invited Schopenhauer for research on his [[Theory of Colours]]. Although Schopenhauer considered colour theory a minor matter,&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Goethe on 23 Jan 1816. Ich weiß, daß durch mich die Wahrheit geredet hat, – in dieser kleinen Sache, wie dereinst in größern.&lt;/ref&gt; he accepted the invitation out of admiration for Goethe. Nevertheless, these investigations led him to his most important discovery in epistemology: finding a demonstration for the a priori nature of causality.

Kant openly admitted that it was [[David Hume|Hume]]'s skeptical assault on causality that motivated the critical investigations of ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]''. In it, he gives an elaborate proof to show that causality is given a priori. After [[Gottlob Ernst Schulze|G.E. Schulze]] had made it plausible that Kant had not disproven Hume's skepticism, it was up to those loyal to the project of Kant to prove this important matter.

The difference between the approach of Kant and Schopenhauer was this: Kant simply declared that the empirical content of perception is "given" to us from outside, an expression with which Schopenhauer often expressed his dissatisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|volume=Vol 1. Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy|location=|pages=|quote=But the whole teaching of Kant contains really nothing more about this than the oft-repeated meaningless expression: 'The empirical element in perception is given from without.' ... always through the same meaningless metaphorical expression: 'The empirical perception is given us.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; He, on the other hand, was occupied with: how do we get this empirical content of perception; how is it possible to comprehend subjective sensations ''limited to my skin'' as the objective perception of things that lie ''outside'' of me?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|at=§ 21|quote=For sensation is and remains a process within the organism and is limited, as such, to the region within the skin; it cannot therefore contain any thing which lies beyond that region, or, in other words, anything that is outside us. ... It is only when the Understanding begins to apply its sole form, the causal law, that a powerful transformation takes place, by which subjective sensation becomes objective perception.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|The sensations in the hand of a man born blind, on feeling an object of cubic shape, are quite uniform and the same on all sides and in every direction: the edges, it is true, press upon a smaller portion of his hand, still nothing at all like a cube is contained in these sensations. His Understanding, however, draws the immediate and intuitive conclusion from the resistance felt, that this resistance must have a cause, which then presents itself through that conclusion as a hard body; and through the movements of his arms in feeling the object, while the hand's sensation remains unaltered, he constructs the cubic shape in Space. If the representation of a cause and of Space, together with their laws, had not already existed within him, the image of a cube could never have proceeded from those successive sensations in his hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|at=§ 21}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Causality is therefore not an empirical concept drawn from objective perceptions, but objective perception presupposes knowledge of causality. Hereby Hume's skepticism is disproven.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|volume=Vol. 1, § 4.|location=|pages=|quote=The contrary doctrine that the law of causality results from experience, which was the scepticism of Hume, is first refuted by this. For the independence of the knowledge of causality of all experience,—that is, its a priori character—can only be deduced from the dependence of all experience upon it; and this deduction can only be accomplished by proving, in the manner here indicated, and explained in the passages referred to above, that the knowledge of causality is included in perception in general, to which all experience belongs, and therefore in respect of experience is completely a priori, does not presuppose it, but is presupposed by it as a condition.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By this intellectual operation, comprehending every effect in our sensory organs as having an external cause, the external world arises. With vision, finding the cause is essentially simplified due to light acting in straight lines. We are seldom conscious of the process, that interprets the double sensation in both eyes as coming from one object; that turns the upside down impression; and that adds depth to make from the planimetrical data stereometrical perception with distance between objects.

Schopenhauer stresses the importance of the intellectual nature of perception, the senses furnish the raw material by which the intellect produces the world as representation. He set out his theory of perception for the first time in ''[[On Vision and Colors]]'',&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and in the subsequent editions of Fourfold Root an extensive exposition is given in § 21.

=== The world as will ===
{{main|The World as Will and Representation}}
Schopenhauer developed a system called [[Voluntarism (philosophy)|metaphysical voluntarism]].

{{Quotation|The kernel and chief point of my doctrine, its Metaphysic proper, is this, that what Kant opposed as ''[[thing-in-itself]]'' to mere appearance (called more decidedly by me "representation") and what he held to be absolutely unknowable, that this ''thing-in-itself'', I say, this substratum of all appearances, and therefore of the whole of Nature, is nothing but what we know directly and intimately and find within ourselves as ''will''; that accordingly, this ''will'', far from being inseparable from, and even a mere result of, knowledge, differs radically and entirely from, and is quite independent of, knowledge, which is secondary and of later origin; and can consequently subsist and manifest itself without knowledge: that this will, being the one and only thing-in-itself, the sole truly real, primary, metaphysical thing in a world in which everything else is only appearance, i.e., mere representation, gives all things, whatever they may be, the power to exist and to act; ... is absolutely identical with the will we find within us and know as intimately as we can know any thing; that, on the other hand, knowledge with its substratum, the intellect, is a merely secondary phenomenon, differing completely from the will, only accompanying its higher degrees of objectification and not essential to it; ... that we are never able therefore to infer absence of will from absence of knowledge.| ''[[s:On the Will in Nature|On the Will in Nature]]''| Introduction}}

For Schopenhauer, human desire was futile, illogical, directionless, and, by extension, so was all human action in the world. Einstein paraphrased his views as follows: "Man can indeed do what he wants, but he cannot will what he wants."{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} In this sense, he adhered to the Fichtean principle of idealism: "The world is ''for'' a subject." This idealism so presented, immediately commits it to an ethical attitude, unlike the purely epistemological concerns of [[Descartes]] and [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]]. To Schopenhauer, the Will is a blind force that controls not only the actions of individual, intelligent agents, but ultimately all observable phenomena—an evil to be terminated via mankind's duties: [[asceticism]] and chastity.&lt;ref name="inveigles"/&gt; He is credited with one of the most famous opening lines of philosophy: "The world is my representation." [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] was greatly influenced by this idea of Will, although he eventually rejected it.

=== Art and aesthetics ===
{{Main|Arthur Schopenhauer's aesthetics}}
For Schopenhauer, human desiring, "willing", and craving cause [[suffering|suffering or pain]]. A temporary way to escape this pain is through aesthetic contemplation (a method comparable to [[Zapffe]]'s "''Sublimation''"). Aesthetic contemplation allows one to escape this pain—albeit temporarily—because it stops one perceiving the world as mere presentation. Instead, one no longer perceives the world as an object of perception (therefore as subject to the Principle of Sufficient Grounds; time, space and causality) from which one is separated; rather one becomes one with that perception: ''"one can thus no longer separate the perceiver from the perception"'' (''The World as Will and Representation'', section 34). From this immersion with the world one no longer views oneself as an individual who suffers in the world due to one's individual will but, rather, becomes a ''"subject of cognition"'' to a perception that is ''"Pure, will-less, timeless"'' (section 34) where the essence, "ideas", of the world are shown. Art is the practical consequence of this brief aesthetic contemplation as it attempts to depict one's immersion with the world, thus tries to depict the essence/pure ideas of the world. Music, for Schopenhauer, was the purest form of art because it was the one that depicted the will itself without it appearing as subject to the Principle of Sufficient Grounds, therefore as an individual object. According to Daniel Albright, "Schopenhauer thought that [[philosophy of music|music]] was the only art that did not merely copy ideas, but actually embodied the will itself".&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Albright, Modernism and Music, 2004, p. 39, footnote 34&lt;/ref&gt;

He deemed music a timeless, universal language comprehended everywhere, that can imbue global enthusiasm, if in possession of a significant melody.&lt;ref name=Music &gt;{{cite book|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|title=Essays and Aphorisms|year=1970|publisher=Penguin Classics|location='10'|isbn=978-0-14-044227-4|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mathematics ===
Schopenhauer's [[Mathematical realism|realist]] views on mathematics are evident in his criticism of the contemporaneous attempts to prove the [[parallel postulate]] in [[Euclidean geometry]]. Writing shortly before the discovery of [[hyperbolic geometry]] demonstrated the logical independence of the [[axiom]]—and long before the [[general theory of relativity]] revealed that it does not necessarily express a property of physical space—Schopenhauer criticized mathematicians for trying to use indirect [[concept]]s to prove what he held was directly evident from [[intuition|intuitive perception]].

{{quote|text=The Euclidean method of demonstration has brought forth from its own womb its most striking parody and caricature in the famous controversy over the theory of ''parallels'', and in the attempts, repeated every year, to prove the eleventh axiom (also known as the fifth postulate). The axiom asserts, and that indeed through the indirect criterion of a third intersecting line, that two lines inclined to each other (for this is the precise meaning of "less than two right angles"), if produced far enough, must meet. Now this truth is supposed to be too complicated to pass as self-evident, and therefore needs a proof; but no such proof can be produced, just because there is nothing more immediate.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', vol. 2, chap. 13&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Throughout his writings,&lt;ref&gt;"I wanted in this way to stress and demonstrate the great difference, indeed opposition, between knowledge of perception and abstract or reflected knowledge. Hitherto this difference has received too little attention, and its establishment is a fundamental feature of my philosophy&amp;nbsp;..." ''Ibid.'', chap. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer criticized the logical derivation of philosophies and mathematics from mere concepts, instead of from intuitive perceptions.

{{quote|text=In fact, it seems to me that the logical method is in this way reduced to an absurdity. But it is precisely through the controversies over this, together with the futile attempts to demonstrate the ''directly'' certain as merely ''indirectly'' certain, that the independence and clearness of intuitive evidence appear in contrast with the uselessness and difficulty of logical proof, a contrast as instructive as it is amusing. The direct certainty will not be admitted here, just because it is no merely logical certainty following from the concept, and thus resting solely on the relation of predicate to subject, according to the principle of contradiction. But that eleventh axiom regarding parallel lines is a [[synthetic proposition]] ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'', and as such has the guarantee of pure, not empirical, perception; this perception is just as immediate and certain as is the [[principle of contradiction]] itself, from which all proofs originally derive their certainty. At bottom this holds good of every geometrical theorem&amp;nbsp;...}}

Although Schopenhauer could see no justification for trying to prove Euclid's parallel postulate, he did see a reason for examining another of Euclid's axioms.&lt;ref&gt;This comment by Schopenhauer was called "an acute observation" by [[T. L. Heath|Sir Thomas L. Heath]]. In his translation of [[Euclid's Elements|The Elements]], vol. 1, Book I, "Note on Common Notion 4", Heath made this judgment and also noted that Schopenhauer's remark "was a criticism in advance of [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz']] theory". Helmholtz had "maintained that geometry requires us to assume the actual existence of rigid bodies and their free mobility in space" and is therefore "dependent on mechanics".&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=It surprises me that the eighth axiom,&lt;ref&gt;What Schopenhauer calls the eighth axiom is Euclid's Common Notion 4.&lt;/ref&gt; "Figures that coincide with one another are equal to one another", is not rather attacked. For ''"coinciding with one another"'' is either a mere [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]], or something quite [[empirical]], belonging not to pure intuition or perception, but to external sensuous experience. Thus it presupposes mobility of the figures, but [[matter]] alone is movable in [[space]]. Consequently, this reference to coincidence with one another forsakes pure space, the sole element of [[geometry]], in order to pass over to the material and empirical.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;}}
This follows [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;"Motion of an ''object'' in space does not belong in a pure science, and consequently not in geometry. For the fact that something is movable cannot be cognized ''a priori'', but can be cognized only through experience." (Kant, ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'',  B 155, Note)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethics ===
{{Main|On the Basis of Morality}}
The task of ethics is not to prescribe moral actions that ought to be done, but to investigate moral actions. Philosophy is always theoretical: its task to explain what is given.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|at=Vol. 1, § 53.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kant's teaching of transcendental idealism, space and time are forms of our sensibility due to which the phenomena appear in multiplicity. Reality [[thing-in-itself|in itself]] is free from all multiplicity, not in the sense that an object is one, but that it is outside the ''possibility'' of multiplicity. From this follows that two individuals, though they appear as distinct, are in-themselves not distinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|at=Vol. 1, § 23.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The appearances are entirely subordinated to the [[principle of sufficient reason]]. The egoistic individual who focuses his aims completely on his own interests has therefore to deal with empirical laws as good as he can.

What is relevant for ethics are individuals who can act against their own self-interest. If we take for example a man who suffers when he sees his fellow men living in poverty, and consequently uses a significant part of his income to support ''their'' needs instead his ''own'' pleasures, then the simplest way to describe this is that he makes ''less distinction between himself'' and others than is usually made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|at=Vol. 1, § 66.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding how the things ''appear'' to us, the egoist is right to assert the gap between two individuals, but the altruist experiences the sufferings of others as his own. In the same way a compassionate man cannot hurt animals, though they appear as distinct from himself.

What motivates the altruist is compassion. The sufferings of others is for him not a cold matter to which he is indifferent, but he feels connected to all beings. Compassion is thus the basis of morality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Basis of Morality|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|at=§ 19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Eternal justice ====
Schopenhauer calls the principle through which multiplicity appears the ''[[principium individuationis]]''. When we behold nature we see that it is a cruel battle for existence. Individual manifestations of the will can maintain themselves at only at the expense of others—the will, as the only thing that exists, has no other option but to devour itself to experience pleasure. This is a fundamental characteristic of the will, and cannot be circumvented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Parerga and Paralipomena|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|at=Vol. 2, § 173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tormenter and tormented are one. Suffering is the moral retribution of our attachment to pleasure. Schopenhauer deemed that this truth was expressed by Christian dogma of [[original sin]] and in Eastern religions with the [[Reincarnation|dogma of rebirth.]]

==== Quietism ====
He who sees through the ''principium individuationis'' and comprehends suffering ''in general'' as his own, will see suffering everywhere, and instead of using all his force to fight for the happiness of his individual manifestation, he will abhor life itself, of which he knows how inseparably it is connected with suffering. A happy individual life midst of a world of suffering is for him like beggar who dreams one night that he is a king.&lt;ref name="Ascetic"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|at=Vol. 1, § 68.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who have experienced this intuitive knowledge can no longer affirm life, but will exhibit asceticism and quietism, meaning that they are no longer sensitive to motives, are not concerned about their individual welfare, and accept the evil others inflict on them without resisting. They welcome poverty, do not seek nor flee death.&lt;ref name="Ascetic"/&gt;

Human life is a ceaseless struggle for satisfaction, and instead of renewing this contract, the ascetic breaks it. It matters little whether these ascetics adhered the dogmata of Christianity or [[Dharmic faith|Dharmic religions]], since their way of living is the result of intuitive knowledge.

{{Quotation|The Christian mystic and the teacher of the Vedanta philosophy agree in this respect also, they both regard all outward works and religious exercises as superfluous for him who has attained to perfection. So much agreement in the case of such different ages and nations is a practical proof that what is expressed here is not, as optimistic dullness likes to assert, an eccentricity and perversity of the mind, but an essential side of human nature, which only appears so rarely because of its excellence.&lt;ref name="Ascetic"/&gt;}}

Schopenhauer referred to asceticism as the denial of the will to live.

=== Psychology ===
Philosophers have not traditionally been impressed by the tribulations of sex, but Schopenhauer addressed it and related concepts forthrightly:

{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;one ought rather to be surprised that a thing [sex] which plays throughout so important a part in human life has hitherto practically been disregarded by philosophers altogether, and lies before us as raw and untreated material.&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, Arthur. [[:s:The World as Will and Representation/Supplements to the Fourth Book|''The World as Will and Representation: Supplements to the Fourth Book'']]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He named a force within man that he felt took invariable precedence over reason: the Will to Live or Will to Life (''Wille zum Leben''), defined as an inherent drive within human beings, and indeed all creatures, to stay alive; a force that inveigles&lt;ref name="inveigles"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Encyclopedic English Dictionary|year=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|location='Schopenhauer'|isbn=978-0-19-861248-3|page=1298}}&lt;/ref&gt; us into reproducing.

Schopenhauer refused to conceive of love as either trifling or accidental, but rather understood it as an immensely powerful force that lay unseen within man's [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]], guaranteeing the quality of the human race:

{{quote|The ultimate aim of all love affairs ... is more important than all other aims in man's life; and therefore it is quite worthy of the profound seriousness with which everyone pursues it. What is decided by it is nothing less than the composition of the next generation ...&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, Arthur, [[:s:The World as Will and Representation/Supplements to the Fourth Book|''The World as Will and Representation'', Supplements to the Fourth Book]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It has often been argued that Schopenhauer's thoughts on sexuality foreshadowed the [[evolution|theory of evolution]], a claim which seems to have been met with satisfaction by [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] as he included a quote of the German philosopher in his [[Descent of Man]] after having read such a claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page%3ADescent_of_Man_1875.djvu/602|title=The Descent of Man|last=Darwin|first=Charles|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|page=586}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has also been noted about [[Sigmund Freud|Freud's]] concepts of the [[libido]] and the [[unconscious mind]], and [[evolutionary psychology]] in general.&lt;ref&gt;"Nearly a century before Freud ... in Schopenhauer there is, for the first time, an explicit philosophy of the unconscious and of the body." Safranski p. 345.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political and social thought ===

==== Politics ====
[[File:FFM Wallanlagen Schopenhauer-Denkmal.jpg|thumb|Bust in [[Frankfurt am Main]]]]
Schopenhauer's politics were, for the most part, an echo of his system of ethics (the latter being expressed in ''Die beiden Grundprobleme der Ethik'', available in English as two separate books, ''[[On the Basis of Morality]]'' and ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]''). Ethics also occupies about one quarter of his central work, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]''.

In occasional political comments in his ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'' and ''Manuscript Remains'', Schopenhauer described himself as a proponent of [[limited government]]. What was essential, he thought, was that the state should "leave each man free to work out his own [[salvation]]," and so long as government was thus limited, he would "prefer to be ruled by a lion than one of [his] fellow rats"—i.e., by a [[monarch]], rather than a [[Republic|democrat]]. Schopenhauer shared the view of [[Thomas Hobbes]] on the necessity of the state, and of state action, to check the destructive tendencies innate to our species. He also defended the independence of the legislative, judicial and executive branches of power, and a monarch as an impartial element able to practise justice (in a practical and everyday sense, not a cosmological one).&lt;ref&gt;''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. 2, Ch. 47&lt;/ref&gt; He declared monarchy as "that which is natural to man" for "intelligence has always under a monarchical government a much better chance against its irreconcilable and ever-present foe, stupidity" and disparaged republicanism as "unnatural as it is unfavourable to the higher intellectual life and the arts and sciences".&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Government (Schopenhauer)|Government]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer, by his own admission, did not give much thought to politics, and several times he writes proudly of how little attention he had paid "to political affairs of [his] day".  In a life that spanned several revolutions in French and German government, and a few continent-shaking wars, he did indeed maintain his aloof position of "minding not the times but the eternities".  He wrote many disparaging remarks about Germany and the Germans. A typical example is, "For a German it is even good to have somewhat lengthy words in his mouth, for he thinks slowly, and they give him time to reflect."&lt;ref&gt;''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. 2, Ch. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer attributed civilizational primacy to the northern "white races" due to their sensitivity and creativity (except for the ancient Egyptians and Hindus, whom he saw as equal):

&lt;blockquote&gt;The highest civilization and culture, apart from the ancient Hindus and Egyptians, are found exclusively among the white races; and even with many dark peoples, the ruling caste or race is fairer in colour than the rest and has, therefore, evidently immigrated, for example, the Brahmans, the Incas, and the rulers of the South Sea Islands. All this is due to the fact that necessity is the mother of invention because those tribes that emigrated early to the north, and there gradually became white, had to develop all their intellectual powers and invent and perfect all the arts in their struggle with need, want and misery, which in their many forms were brought about by the climate. This they had to do in order to make up for the parsimony of nature and out of it all came their high civilization.&lt;ref&gt;''Parerga and Paralipomena'', Volume II, Section 92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite this, he was adamantly against differing treatment of races, was fervently anti-slavery, and supported the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] movement in the United States. He describes the treatment of "[our] innocent black brothers whom force and injustice have delivered into [the slave-master's] devilish clutches" as "belonging to the blackest pages of mankind's criminal record".&lt;ref&gt;''Parerga and Paralipomena'', "On Ethics," Sec. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer additionally maintained a marked metaphysical and political [[anti-Judaism]]. Schopenhauer argued that Christianity constituted a revolt against what he styled the materialistic basis of Judaism, exhibiting an Indian-influenced ethics reflecting the [[Aryan]]-[[Vedas|Vedic]] theme of spiritual self-conquest. He saw this as opposed to what he held was the ignorant drive toward earthly utopianism and superficiality of a worldly "Jewish" spirit:

&lt;blockquote&gt;While all other religions endeavor to explain to the people by symbols the metaphysical significance of life, the religion of the Jews is entirely immanent and furnishes nothing but a mere war-cry in the struggle with other nations.&lt;ref&gt;"Fragments for the history of philosophy", ''Parerga and Paralipomena'', Volume I.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Punishment ====
The State, Schopenhauer claimed, punishes criminals to prevent future crimes. It does so by placing "beside every possible motive for committing a wrong a more powerful motive for leaving it undone, in the inescapable punishment. Accordingly, the criminal code is as complete a register as possible of counter-motives to all criminal actions that can possibly be imagined&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name="twwr62"&gt;Schopenhauer, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. I, § 62.&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed this doctrine was not original to him. Previously, it appeared in the writings of [[Plato]],&lt;ref&gt;"...&amp;nbsp;he who attempts to punish in accordance with reason does not retaliate on account of the past wrong (for he could not undo something which has been done) but for the sake of the future, so that neither the wrongdoer himself, nor others who see him being punished, will do wrong again." Plato, "[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]", 324 B. Plato wrote that punishment should "be an example to other men not to offend". Plato, "[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]", Book IX, 863.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]], [[Samuel von Pufendorf|Pufendorf]], and [[Paul Johann Anselm Ritter von Feuerbach|Anselm Feuerbach]].

==== Views on women ====
In Schopenhauer's 1851 essay ''On Women'', he expressed his opposition to what he called "Teutonico-Christian stupidity" of reflexive unexamined reverence ("abgeschmackten Weiberveneration")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aboq.org/schopenhauer/parerga2/weiber.htm|title=Über die Weiber, §369}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the female. Schopenhauer wrote that "Women are directly fitted for acting as the nurses and teachers of our early childhood by the fact that they are themselves childish, frivolous and short-sighted." He opined that women are deficient in artistic faculties and sense of justice, and expressed opposition to [[monogamy]]. Indeed, [[Nigel Rodgers|Rodgers]] and [[Mel Thompson|Thompson]] in ''[[Philosophers Behaving Badly]]'' call Schopenhauer "a misogynist without rival in ... Western philosophy". He claimed that "woman is by nature meant to obey". The essay does give some compliments, however: that "women are decidedly more sober in their judgment than [men] are", and are more sympathetic to the suffering of others.

Schopenhauer's writings have influenced many, from [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] to nineteenth-century [[feminists]].&lt;ref&gt;''Feminism and the Limits of Equality''
PA Cain – Ga. L. Rev., 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer's [[biology|biological]] analysis of the difference between the sexes, and their separate roles in the struggle for survival and reproduction, anticipates some of the claims that were later ventured by [[sociobiology|sociobiologists]] and [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]].&lt;ref name="Young2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Julian Young|title=Schopenhauer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gfDyeGY0RFMC&amp;pg=PA242|date=23 June 2005|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-33346-7|page=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the elderly Schopenhauer sat for [[Arthur Schopenhauer (sculpture)|a sculpture portrait]] by the Prussian sculptor [[Elisabet Ney]] in 1859, he was much impressed by the young woman's wit and independence, as well as by her skill as a visual artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Arthur Schopenhauer and Elisabet Ney|first=Sandra Salser|last=Long|journal=[[Southwest Review]]|volume=69|number=2|date=Spring 1984|pages=130–47|jstor=43469632}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his time with Ney, he told Richard Wagner's friend [[Malwida von Meysenbug]], "I have not yet spoken my last word about women. I believe that if a woman succeeds in withdrawing from the mass, or rather raising herself above the mass, she grows ceaselessly and more than a man."&lt;ref&gt;Safranski (1990), Chapter 24. p. 348.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Heredity and eugenics ====
[[File:Frankfurt Am Main-Portraits-Arthur Schopenhauer-1845.jpg|thumb|upright|Schopenhauer at age 58 on 16 May 1846]]

Schopenhauer viewed personality and [[intellect]] as being inherited. He quotes Horace's saying, "From the brave and good are the brave descended" (''Odes'', iv, 4, 29) and Shakespeare's line from ''[[Cymbeline]]'', "Cowards father cowards, and base things sire base" (IV, 2) to reinforce his hereditarian argument.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, ''The World as Will and Representation'', Vol. II, p. 519&lt;/ref&gt;
Mechanistically, Schopenhauer believed that a person inherits his level of intellect through his mother, and personal character through one's father.&lt;ref&gt;On the Suffering of the World, (1970), p. 35. Penguin Books – Great Ideas&lt;/ref&gt; This belief in heritability of traits informed Schopenhauer's view of love – placing it at the highest level of importance. For Schopenhauer the "final aim of all love intrigues, be they comic or tragic, is really of more importance than all other ends in human life. What it all turns upon is nothing less than the composition of the next generation. ... It is not the weal or woe of any one individual, but that of the human race to come, which is here at stake." This view of the importance for the species of whom we choose to love was reflected in his views on [[eugenics]] or good breeding. Here Schopenhauer wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;With our knowledge of the complete unalterability both of character and of mental faculties, we are led to the view that a real and thorough improvement of the human race might be reached not so much from outside as from within, not so much by theory and instruction as rather by the path of generation. Plato had something of the kind in mind when, in the fifth book of his ''Republic'', he explained his plan for increasing and improving his warrior caste. If we could [[castrate]] all [[criminals|scoundrels]] and stick all stupid geese in a convent, and give men of noble character a whole [[harem]], and procure men, and indeed thorough men, for all girls of intellect and understanding, then a generation would soon arise which would produce a better age than that of [[Pericles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Schopenhauer | first = Arthur | title = The World as Will and Representation |editor=E. F. J. Payne |volume=II | publisher = Dover Publications | location = New York | year = 1969 | isbn = 978-0-486-21762-8 |page=527 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In another context, Schopenhauer reiterated his eugenic thesis: "If you want Utopian plans, I would say: the only solution to the problem is the [[despotism]] of the wise and noble members of a genuine aristocracy, a genuine nobility, achieved by [[mating]] the most magnanimous men with the cleverest and most gifted women. This proposal constitutes my Utopia and my Platonic Republic."&lt;ref&gt;''Essays and Aphorisms'', trans. R.J. Hollingdale, Middlesex: London, 1970, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; Analysts (e.g., Keith Ansell-Pearson) have suggested that Schopenhauer's anti-[[egalitarianism|egalitarianist]] sentiment and his support for eugenics influenced the neo-aristocratic philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche, who initially considered Schopenhauer his mentor.&lt;ref&gt;''Nietzsche and modern German thought'' by K. Ansell-Pearson – 1991 – Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Animal welfare ====
{{See also|Animal_rights#Arthur_Schopenhauer|label 1=Arthur Schopenhauer's views on animal rights}}
As a consequence of his [[Monism|monistic]] philosophy, Schopenhauer was very concerned about the welfare of animals.&lt;ref&gt;Christina Gerhardt, "Thinking With: Animals in Schopenhauer, Horkheimer and Adorno." Critical Theory and Animals. Ed. John Sanbonmatsu. Lanham: Rowland, 2011. 137–157.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Puryear, [https://philpapers.org/rec/PURSOT "Schopenhauer on the Rights of Animals." ''European Journal of Philosophy'' 25/2 (2017):250-269].&lt;/ref&gt; For him, all individual animals, including humans, are essentially the same, being phenomenal manifestations of the one underlying Will. The word "will" designated, for him, force, power, impulse, energy, and desire; it is the closest word we have that can signify both the real essence of all external things and also our own direct, inner experience. Since every living thing possesses will, then humans and animals are fundamentally the same and can recognize themselves in each other.&lt;ref&gt;"Unlike the intellect, it [the Will] does not depend on the perfection of the organism, but is essentially the same in all animals as what is known to us so intimately. Accordingly, the animal has all the emotions of humans, such as joy, grief, fear, anger, love, hatred, strong desire, envy, and so on. The great difference between human and animal rests solely on the intellect's degrees of perfection. ''On the Will in Nature'', "Physiology and Pathology".&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, he claimed that a good person would have sympathy for animals, who are our fellow sufferers.

{{quote|Compassion for animals is intimately associated with goodness of character, and it may be confidently asserted that he who is cruel to living creatures cannot be a good man.|''[[On the basis of morality]]'', § 19}}
{{quote|Nothing leads more definitely to a recognition of the identity of the essential nature in animal and human phenomena than a study of zoology and anatomy.|''On the basis of morality'', chapter 8&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{cite book | last = Schopenhauer | first = Arthur | title = Philosophical Writings | publisher = Continuum | location = London | year = 1994 | isbn = 978-0-8264-0729-0 |page=233}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|The assumption that animals are without rights and the illusion that our treatment of them has no moral significance is a positively outrageous example of Western crudity and barbarity. Universal compassion is the only guarantee of morality.|''On the basis of morality'', chapter 8&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{cite book | last = Ryder | first = Richard | title = Animal Revolution: Changing Attitudes Towards Speciesism | publisher = Berg Publishers | location = Oxford | year = 2000 | isbn = 978-1-85973-330-1 |page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1841, he praised the establishment, in London, of the [[Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]], and also the Animals' Friends Society in Philadelphia. Schopenhauer even went so far as to protest against the use of the pronoun "it" in reference to animals because it led to the treatment of them as though they were inanimate things.&lt;ref&gt;"... in English all animals are of the neuter gender and so are represented by the pronoun 'it,' just as if they were inanimate things. The effect of this artifice is quite revolting, especially in the case of primates, such as dogs, monkeys, and the like...." ''[[On the basis of morality]]'', § 19.&lt;/ref&gt; To reinforce his points, Schopenhauer referred to anecdotal reports of the look in the eyes of a monkey who had been shot&lt;ref&gt;"I recall having read of an Englishman who, while hunting in India, had shot a monkey; he could not forget the look which the dying animal gave him, and since then had never again fired at monkeys." ''[[On the basis of morality]]'', § 19.&lt;/ref&gt; and also the grief of a baby elephant whose mother had been killed by a hunter.&lt;ref&gt;"[Sir William Harris] describes how he shot his first elephant, a female. The next morning he went to look for the dead animal; all the other elephants had fled from the neighborhood except a young one, who had spent the night with its dead mother. Forgetting all fear, he came toward the sportsmen with the clearest and liveliest evidence of inconsolable grief, and put his tiny trunk round them in order to appeal to them for help. Harris says he was then filled with real remorse for what he had done, and felt as if he had committed a murder." ''[[On the basis of morality]]'', § 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was very attached to his succession of pet poodles. Schopenhauer criticized [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza's]]&lt;ref&gt;"His contempt for animals, who, as mere things for our use, are declared by him to be without rights, ... in conjunction with Pantheism, is at the same time absurd and abominable." ''The World as Will and Representation'', Vol. 2, Chapter 50.&lt;/ref&gt; belief that animals are a mere means for the satisfaction of humans.&lt;ref&gt;Spinoza, ''Ethics'', Pt. IV, Prop. XXXVII, Note I.: "Still I do not deny that beasts feel: what I deny is, that we may not consult our own advantage and use them as we please, treating them in a way which best suits us; for their nature is not like ours&amp;nbsp;..." This is the exact opposite of Schopenhauer's doctrine. Also, ''ibid.'', Appendix, 26, "whatsoever there be in nature beside man, a regard for our advantage does not call on us to preserve, but to preserve or destroy according to its various capacities, and to adapt to our use as best we may."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Such are the matters which I engage to prove in Prop. xviii of this Part, whereby it is plain that the law against the slaughtering of animals is founded rather on vain superstition and womanish pity than on sound reason. The rational quest of what is useful to us further teaches us the necessity of associating ourselves with our fellow-men, but not with beasts, or things, whose nature is different from our own; we have the same rights in respect to them as they have in respect to us. Nay, as everyone's right is defined by his virtue, or power, men have far greater rights over beasts than beasts have over men. Still I affirm that beasts feel. But I also affirm that we may consult our own advantage and use them as we please, treating them in the way which best suits us; for their nature is not like ours, and their emotions are naturally different from human emotions." ''Ethics'', Part 4, Prop. 37, Note 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Views on pederasty ====
In the third, expanded edition of ''The World as Will and Representation'' (1859), Schopenhauer added an appendix to his chapter on the ''Metaphysics of Sexual Love''. He wrote that pederasty did have the benefit of preventing ill-begotten children. Concerning this, he stated that "the vice we are considering appears to work directly against the aims and ends of nature, and that in a matter that is all important and of the greatest concern to her it must in fact serve these very aims, although only indirectly, as a means for preventing greater evils".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Schopenhauer|1969|p=566}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Schopenhauer ends the appendix with the statement that "by expounding these paradoxical ideas, I wanted to grant to the professors of philosophy a small favour. I have done so by giving them the opportunity of slandering me by saying that I defend and commend pederasty."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Schopenhauer|1969|p=567}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intellectual interests and affinities===

====[[Indology]]====
[[File:Schopenhauer 1852.jpg|thumb|Photo of Schopenhauer, 1852]]

Schopenhauer read the Latin translation of the ancient [[Hindu]] texts, the [[Upanishads]], which French writer [[Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron|Anquetil du Perron]] had translated from the Persian translation of Prince [[Dara Shukoh]] entitled ''Sirre-Akbar'' ("The Great Secret"). He was so impressed by their philosophy that he called them "the production of the highest human wisdom", and believed they contained superhuman concepts. The Upanishads was a great source of inspiration to Schopenhauer. Writing about them, he said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is the most satisfying and elevating reading (with the exception of the original text) which is possible in the world; it has been the solace of my life and will be the solace of my death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=John James|title=Oriental enlightenment|publisher=Routledge|year=1997|page=68|isbn=978-0-415-13376-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The book ''Oupnekhat'' (Upanishad) always lay open on his table, and he invariably studied it before sleeping at night. He called the opening up of Sanskrit literature "the greatest gift of our century" and predicted that the philosophy and knowledge of the Upanishads would become the cherished faith of the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philosophy.ru/library/asiatica/indica/authors/motives.html|title=Western Indologists: A Study in Motives|last=Dutt|first=Purohit Bhagavan|accessdate=9 May 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100802010348/http://www.philosophy.ru/library/asiatica/indica/authors/motives.html|archivedate=2 August 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer was first introduced to the 1802 Latin Upanishad translation through Friedrich Majer. They met during the winter of 1813–1814 in [[Weimar]] at the home of Schopenhauer's mother according to the biographer Safranski. Majer was a follower of [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], and an early [[Indologist]]. Schopenhauer did not begin a serious study of the Indic texts, however, until the summer of 1814. Sansfranski maintains that between 1815 and 1817, Schopenhauer had another important cross-pollination with Indian thought in [[Dresden]]. This was through his neighbor of two years, [[Karl Christian Friedrich Krause]]. Krause was then a minor and rather unorthodox philosopher who attempted to mix his own ideas with that of ancient Indian wisdom. Krause had also mastered [[Sanskrit]], unlike Schopenhauer, and the two developed a professional relationship. It was from Krause that Schopenhauer learned [[meditation]] and received the closest thing to expert advice concerning Indian thought.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher McCoy, 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;

Most noticeable, in the case of Schopenhauer's work, was the significance of the [[Chandogya Upanishad]], whose [[Mahāvākyas|Mahāvākya]], [[Tat Tvam Asi]], is mentioned throughout ''The World as Will and Representation''.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher McCoy, 54–56&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Buddhism ====
Schopenhauer noted a correspondence between his doctrines and the [[Four Noble Truths]] of [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;Abelson, Peter (April 1993).
[http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/peter2.htm Schopenhauer and Buddhism]. ''Philosophy East and West
Volume 43, Number 2'', pp. 255–278. University of Hawaii Press. Retrieved on: 12 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarities centered on the principles that life involves suffering, that suffering is caused by desire ([[taṇhā]]), and that the extinction of desire leads to liberation. Thus three of the four "truths of the Buddha" correspond to Schopenhauer's doctrine of the will.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Janaway|Janaway]], Christopher, ''Self and World in Schopenhauer's Philosophy'', pp. 28&amp;nbsp;ff.&lt;/ref&gt; In Buddhism, however, while greed and lust are always unskillful, desire is ethically variable – it can be skillful, unskillful, or neutral.&lt;ref name="David Burton 2004, page 22"&gt;David Burton, "Buddhism, Knowledge and Liberation: A Philosophical Study." Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2004, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Schopenhauer, will had [[ontology|ontological]] primacy over the [[intellect]]. In other words, desire is prior to thought. Schopenhauer felt this was similar to notions of [[puruṣārtha]] or goals of life in [[Vedānta]] [[Hinduism]].

In Schopenhauer's philosophy, denial of the will is attained by either:
* personal experience of an extremely great suffering that leads to loss of the will to live; or
* knowledge of the essential nature of life in the world through observation of the suffering of other people.

However, Buddhist [[nirvāṇa]] is not equivalent to the condition that Schopenhauer described as denial of the will. Nirvāṇa is not the extinguishing of the ''person'' as some Western scholars have thought, but only the "extinguishing" (the literal meaning of nirvana) of the flames of greed, hatred, and delusion that assail a person's character.&lt;ref&gt;John J. Holder, ''Early Buddhist Discourses.'' Hackett Publishing Company, 2006, p. xx.&lt;/ref&gt; Occult historian [[Joscelyn Godwin]] (born 1945) stated, "It was Buddhism that inspired the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer, and, through him, attracted [[Richard Wagner]]."&lt;ref&gt;Godwin, J: ''Arktos: The Polar Myth in Science, Symbolism, and Nazi Survival'', p. 38. Adventures Unlimited Press, 1996, {{ISBN|978-0-932813-35-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Orientalism]] reflected the struggle of the German Romantics, in the words of [[Leon Poliakov]], to "free themselves from [[Judeo-Christian]] fetters".&lt;ref&gt;''Arktos'', p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; In contradistinction to Godwin's claim that Buddhism inspired Schopenhauer, the philosopher himself made the following statement in his discussion of religions:&lt;ref&gt;
"Schopenhauer is often said to be the first, or indeed the only, modern Western philosopher of any note to attempt any integration of his work with Eastern ways of thinking. That he was the first is surely true, but the claim that he was ''influenced'' by Indian thought needs some qualification. There is a remarkable correspondence, at least in broad terms, between some of the central Schopenhauerian doctrines and Buddhism: notably in the views that empirical existence is suffering, that suffering originates in desires, and that salvation can be attained by the extinction of desires. These three 'truths of the Buddha' are mirrored closely in the essential structure of the doctrine of the will." (On this, see Dorothea W. Dauer, ''Schopenhauer as Transmitter of Buddhist Ideas''. Note also the discussion by Bryan Magee, ''The Philosophy of Schopenhauer'', pp. 14–15, 316–21). Janaway, Christopher, ''Self and World in Schopenhauer's Philosophy'', p. 28&amp;nbsp;f.
&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If I wished to take the results of my philosophy as the standard of truth, I should have to concede to Buddhism pre-eminence over the others. In any case, it must be a pleasure to me to see my doctrine in such close agreement with a religion that the majority of men on earth hold as their own, for this numbers far more followers than any other. And this agreement must be yet the more pleasing to me, inasmuch as ''in my philosophizing I have certainly not been under its influence'' [emphasis added]. For up till 1818, when my work appeared, there was to be found in Europe only a very few accounts of Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. 2, Ch. 17&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Buddhist philosopher [[Nishitani Keiji]], however, sought to distance Buddhism from Schopenhauer.&lt;ref&gt;''Artistic detachment in Japan and the West: psychic distance in comparative aesthetics'' by S. Odin – 2001 – University of Hawaii Press.&lt;/ref&gt; While Schopenhauer's philosophy may sound rather mystical in such a summary, his [[methodology]] was resolutely [[empirical]], rather than speculative or transcendental:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Philosophy ... is a science, and as such has no articles of faith; accordingly, in it nothing can be assumed as existing except what is either positively given empirically, or demonstrated through indubitable conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;''Parerga &amp; Paralipomena'', vol. I, p. 106., trans. E.F.J. Payne.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also note:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
This actual world of what is knowable, in which we are and which is in us, remains both the material and the limit of our consideration.&lt;ref&gt;''World as Will and Representation'', vol. I, p. 273, trans. E.F.J. Payne.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The argument that Buddhism affected Schopenhauer's philosophy more than any other [[Dharma|Dharmic]] faith loses more credence when viewed in light of the fact that Schopenhauer did not begin a serious study of Buddhism until after the publication of ''The World as Will and Representation'' in 1818.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher McCoy, 3&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have started to revise earlier views about Schopenhauer's discovery of Buddhism. Proof of early interest and influence, however, appears in Schopenhauer's 1815/16 notes (transcribed and translated by Urs App) about Buddhism. They are included in a recent case study that traces Schopenhauer's interest in Buddhism and documents its influence.&lt;ref&gt;
App, Urs [http://www.sino-platonic.org/complete/spp200_schopenhauer.pdf Arthur Schopenhauer and China. ''Sino-Platonic Papers'' Nr. 200 (April 2010)] (PDF, 8.7&amp;nbsp;Mb PDF, 164 p.; Schopenhauer's early notes on Buddhism reproduced in Appendix). This study provides an overview of the actual discovery of Buddhism by Schopenhauer.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholarly work questions how similar Schopenhauer's philosophy actually is to Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, Kenneth [http://blogs.dickinson.edu/buddhistethics/files/2014/12/Hutton-Schopenhauer.pdf Compassion in Schopenhauer and Śāntideva. ''Journal of Buddhist Ethics'' Vol. 21 (2014)]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Magic and occultism====

Some traditions in [[Western esotericism]] and [[parapsychology]] interested Schopenhauer and influenced his philosophical theories. He praised [[animal magnetism]] as evidence for the reality of magic in his ''On the Will in Nature'', and went so far as to accept the division of magic into [[Left-hand path and right-hand path|left-hand and right-hand magic]], although he doubted the existence of demons.&lt;ref name="Myth of Disenchantment"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |pages = 187–8 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 978-0-226-40336-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer grounded magic in the Will and claimed all forms of magical transformation depended on the human Will, not on ritual. This theory notably parallels [[Aleister Crowley]]'s system of magick and its emphasis on human will.&lt;ref name="Myth of Disenchantment" /&gt; Given the importance of the Will to Schopenhauer's overarching system, this amounts to "suggesting his whole philosophical system had magical powers."&lt;ref&gt;Quote from Josephson-Storm (2017), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer rejected the theory of [[disenchantment]] and claimed philosophy should synthesize itself with magic, which he believed amount to "practical metaphysics."&lt;ref&gt;Josephson-Storm (2017), p. 188-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neoplatonism]], including the traditions of [[Plotinus]] and to a lesser extent [[Marsilio Ficino]], has also been cited as an influence on Schopenhauer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson |first=Mark |title=Pure: Modernity, Philosophy, and the One |chapter=Experimental Subversions of Modernity |date=2009 |publisher=Sophia Perennis |isbn=978-1597310949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interests==

Schopenhauer had a wide range of interests, from science and opera to occultism and literature.

In his student years Schopenhauer went more often to lectures in the sciences than philosophy. He kept a strong interest as his personal library contained near to 200 books of scientific literature at his death, and his works refer to scientific titles not found in the library.&lt;ref name="Flute"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=meD1bGAjO6wC&amp;pg=PA30|title=Schopenhauer: a Biography|last=Cartwright|first=David E.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-521-82598-6|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|170}}

Many evenings were spent in the theatre, opera and ballet; the operas of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]] and [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]] were especially esteemed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wagner and the Art of the Theatre|last=Carnegy|first=Patrick|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer considered music the highest art, and played the flute during his whole life.&lt;ref name="Flute" /&gt;{{rp|30}}

As a polyglot, the philosopher knew [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], English, [[Latin]] and [[ancient Greek]], and he was an avid reader of poetry and literature. He particularly revered [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Petrarch]], [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca|Calderón]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;If Goethe had not been sent into the world simultaneously with Kant in order to counterbalance him, so to speak, in the spirit of the age, the latter would have been haunted like a nightmare many an aspiring mind and would have oppressed it with great affliction. But now the two have an infinitely wholesome effect from opposite directions and will probably raise the German spirit to a height surpassing even that of antiquity.&lt;ref name="Flute" /&gt;{{rp|240}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In philosophy, his most important influences were, according to himself, Kant, [[Plato]] and the [[Upanishads]]. Concerning the Upanishads and [[Vedas]], he writes in ''The World as Will and Representation'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;If the reader has also received the benefit of the Vedas, the access to which by means of the Upanishads is in my eyes the greatest privilege which this still young century (1818) may claim before all previous centuries, if then the reader, I say, has received his initiation in primeval Indian wisdom, and received it with an open heart, he will be prepared in the very best way for hearing what I have to tell him. It will not sound to him strange, as to many others, much less disagreeable; for I might, if it did not sound conceited, contend that every one of the detached statements which constitute the Upanishads, may be deduced as a necessary result from the fundamental thoughts which I have to enunciate, though those deductions themselves are by no means to be found there.&lt;ref&gt;''The World as Will and Representation'' Preface to the first edition, p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Thoughts on other philosophers ==

=== Giordano Bruno and Spinoza ===
Schopenhauer saw [[Giordano Bruno|Bruno]] and [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] as unique philosophers who were not bound to their age or nation. "Both were fulfilled by the thought, that as manifold the appearances of the world may be, it is still ''one'' being, that appears in all of them. ... Consequently, there is no place for God as creator of the world in their philosophy, but God is the world itself."&lt;ref name="Spinoza and Bruno"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|at=Vol. 1, Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy. Note 5.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Presentation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gutenberg.spiegel.de/buch/arthur-schopenhauers-handschriftlicher-nachlass-vorlesungen-und-abhandlungen-4993/3|title=Handschriftlicher, Nachlass, Vorlesungen und Abhandlungen.|last=|first=|date=|website=Gutenberg Spiegel|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer expressed his regret that Spinoza stuck for the presentation of his philosophy with the concepts of [[scholasticism]] and [[Cartesian philosophy]], and tried to use geometrical proofs that do not hold because of the vagueness and wideness of the definitions. It is the common preference of philosophers of abstraction over perception. Bruno on the other hand, who knew much about nature and ancient literature, presents his ideas with Italian vividness, and is amongst philosophers the only one who comes near Plato's poetic and dramatic power of exposition.&lt;ref name="Spinoza and Bruno" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Presentation" /&gt;

Schopenhauer noted that their philosophies do not provide any ethics, and it is therefore very remarkable that Spinoza called his main work ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]''. In fact, it could be considered complete from the standpoint of life-affirmation, if one completely ignores morality and self-denial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Abschnitt: Handschriftlicher Nachlaß|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|at=§ 588|quote=Es kann daher eine vollkommen wahre Philosophie geben, die ganz von der Verneinung des Lebens abstrahirt, diese ganz ignorirt.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is yet even more remarkable that Schopenhauer mentions Spinoza as an example of the denial of the will, if one uses the French biography by Jean Maximilien Lucas &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Vie_de_Spinoza|title=Vie de Spinoza - Wikisource|website=fr.wikisource.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the key to ''[[Tractatus de Intellectus Emendatione]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|at=§ 68|quote=We might to a certain extent regard the well-known French biography of Spinoza as a case in point, if we used as a key to it that noble introduction to his very insufficient essay, ''De Emendatione Intellects'', a passage which I can also recommend as the most effectual means I know of stilling the storm of the passions.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immanuel Kant===
{{See also|Critique of the Kantian philosophy|Schopenhauer's criticism of Kant's schemata}}
The importance of Kant for Schopenhauer, in philosophy as well as on a personal level, can hardly be overstated. The philosophy of Kant was the foundation of his own. Schopenhauer maintained that Kant stands in the same relation to philosophers such as Berkeley and [[Plato]], as Copernicus to [[Hicetas]], [[Philolaus]], and [[Aristarchus of Samos|Aristarchus]]: Kant succeeded in demonstrating what previous philosophers merely asserted.

In his study room one bust was of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], the other was of Kant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Schopenhauer. Pessimist and Pagan.|last=Jerauld McGill|first=Vivian|publisher=|year=1931|isbn=|location=|page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bond which Schopenhauer felt with the philosopher of Königsberg may be esteemed in a poem he dedicated to Kant:

{{quotation|With my eyes I followed thee into the blue sky,

And there thy flight dissolved from view.

Alone I stayed in the crowd below,

Thy word and thy book my only solace. —|sign=|source=}}

Schopenhauer dedicated one fifth of his main work, ''The World as Will and Representation'', to a criticism of the Kantian philosophy.

===Post-Kantian school===
The leading figures of [[German idealism|post-Kantian philosophy]], Fichte, Schelling and Hegel, were not respected by Schopenhauer. He argued that they were no philosophers at all, who merely sought to impress the public.

{{Quotation|All this explains the painful impression with which we are seized when, after studying genuine thinkers, we come to the writings of Fichte and Schelling, or even to the presumptuously scribbled nonsense of Hegel, produced as it was with a boundless, though justified, confidence in German stupidity. With those genuine thinkers one always found an ''honest'' investigation of truth and just as ''honest'' an attempt to communicate their ideas to others. Therefore whoever reads Kant, Locke, Hume, Malebranche, Spinoza, and Descartes feels elevated and agreeably impressed. This is produced through communion with a noble mind which has and awakens ideas and which thinks and sets one thinking. The reverse of all this takes place when we read the above-mentioned three German sophists. An unbiased reader, opening one of their books and then asking himself whether this is the tone of a thinker wanting to instruct or that of a charlatan wanting to impress, cannot be five minutes in any doubt; here everything breathes so much of ''dishonesty''.|sign=Appendix to "Sketch of a History of the Doctrine of the Ideal and the Real"|source=}}

[[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]] was deemed the most talented of the three, and Schopenhauer wrote that he would recommend his "elucidatory paraphrase of the highly important doctrine of Kant" concerning the intelligible character, if he had been honest enough to admit he was showing off with the thoughts of Kant, instead of hiding this relation in a cunning manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Freedom of the Will|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer's favourite subject of attacks was [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], whom he considered unworthy even of Fichte and Schelling. Whereas Fichte was merely a windbag, Hegel was a "stupid and clumsy charlatan". [[Karl Popper]] agreed with this distinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Open Society and Her Enemies|last=Popper|first=Karl|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
[[File:Arthur_Schopenhauer_by_Elisabet_Ney.jpg|thumb|[[Arthur Schopenhauer (sculpture)|Sculpture of Schopenhauer]] by [[Elisabeth Ney]]]]
Schopenhauer had a large posthumous effect and remained the most influential German philosopher until the [[First World War]].&lt;ref name=Weltschmerz&gt;{{Cite book|title=Weltschmerz, Pessimism in German Philosophy, 1860–1900|last=Beiser|first=Frederick C.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0198768715|location=Oxford|pages=14–16|quote=Arthur Schopenhauer was the most famous and influential philosopher in Germany from 1860 until the First World War. ... Schopenhauer had a profound influence on two intellectual movements of the late 19th century that were utterly opposed to him: neo-Kantianism and positivism. He forced these movements to address issues they would otherwise have completely ignored, and in doing so he changed them markedly. ... Schopenhauer set the agenda for his age.}}&lt;/ref&gt; His philosophy was a starting point for a new generation of philosophers, which consisted of [[Julius Bahnsen]], [[Paul Deussen]], Lazar von Hellenbach, [[Karl Robert Eduard von Hartmann]], Ernst Otto Lindner, [[Philipp Mainländer]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], Olga Plümacher and Agnes Talbert. His legacy shaped the intellectual debate, and forced movements that were utterly opposed to him, [[neo-Kantianism]] and [[positivism]], to address issues they would otherwise have completely ignored, and in doing so he changed them markedly.&lt;ref name=Weltschmerz/&gt; The French writer [[Maupassant]] commented that "to-day even those who execrate him seem to carry in their own souls particles of his thought."&lt;ref&gt;Beside Schopenhauer's Corpse&lt;/ref&gt; Other philosophers of the 19th century who cited his influence include [[Hans Vaihinger]], [[Johannes Volkelt|Volkelt]], [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Solovyov]] and [[Otto Weininger|Weininger]].

Schopenhauer was well read amongst physicists, most notably Einstein, [[Erwin Schrödinger|Schrödinger]], [[Wolfgang Pauli]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Peek behind the Veil of Maya: Einstein, Schopenhauer, and the Historical Background of the Conception of Space as a Ground for the Individuation of Physical Systems|last=Don|first=Howard|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=Pauli greatly admired Schopenhauer. ... Pauli wrote sympathetically about extrasensory perception, noting approvingly that "even such a thoroughly critical philosopher as Schopenhauer not only regarded parapsychological effects going far beyond what is secured by scientific evidence as possible, but even considered them as a support for his philosophy".}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ettore Majorana|Majorana]].&lt;ref name=Majorana /&gt; Einstein described Schopenhauer's thoughts as a "continual consolation" and called him a genius.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Einstein: His Life and Universe|last=Isaacson|first=Walter|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=2007|isbn=978-0743264747|location=New York|page=367}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his Berlin study three figures hung on the wall: [[Michael Faraday|Faraday]], [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]], Schopenhauer.&lt;ref name="Howard" /&gt;{{rp|87}} [[Konrad Wachsmann]] recalled: "He often sat with one of the well-worn Schopenhauer volumes, and as he sat there, he seemed so pleased, as if he were engaged with a serene and cheerful work."&lt;ref name="Howard"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Peek behind the Veil of Maya: Einstein, Schopenhauer, and the Historical Background of the Conception of Space as a Ground for the Individuation of Physical Systems|last=Don|first=Howard|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|92}}

When [[Erwin Schrödinger]] discovered Schopenhauer ("the greatest savant of the West") he considered switching his study of physics to philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Einstein's Dice and Schrödinger's Cat: How Two Great Minds Battled Quantum Randomness to Create a Unified Theory of Physics|last=Halpern|first=Paul|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=978-0465040650|location=|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained the idealistic views during the rest of his life.&lt;ref name="Howard" /&gt;{{rp|132}} [[Wolfgang Pauli]] accepted the main tenet of Schopenhauer's metaphysics, that the [[thing-in-itself]] is will.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/6149849/Schopenhauers_Metaphysics_and_Contemporary_Quantum_Theory|title=Schopenhauers Metaphysics and Contemporary Quantum Theory|last=Raymond B.

But most of all Schopenhauer is famous for his influence on artists. [[Richard Wagner]] became one of the earliest and most famous adherents of the Schopenhauerian philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Magee (2000) 276–278.&lt;/ref&gt; The admiration was not mutual, and Schopenhauer proclaimed: "I remain faithful to Rossini and Mozart!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Invention of Beethoven and Rossini: Historiography, Analysis, Criticism|last=Nicholas Mathew, Benjamin Walton|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|page=296}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Tristan und Isolde#Influence of Schopenhauer on Tristan und Isolde|Influence of Schopenhauer on Tristan und Isolde]].

Under the influence of Schopenhauer [[Leo Tolstoy]] became convinced that the truth of all religions lies in self-renunciation. When he read his philosophy he exclaimed "at present I am convinced that Schopenhauer is the greatest genius among men. ... It is the whole world in an incomparably beautiful and clear reflection."&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy's letter to Afanasy Fet on August 30, 1869. "Do you know what this summer has meant for me? Constant raptures over Schopenhauer and a whole series of spiritual delights as I've never experienced before. I have brought all of his works and read him over and over, Kant too by the way. Assuredly no student has ever learned and discovered so much in one semester as I have during this summer. I do not know if I shall ever change my opinion, but at present I am convinced that Schopenhauer is the greatest genius among men. You say he is so-so, he has written a few things on philosophy? What is so-so? It is the whole world in an incomparably beautiful and clear reflection. I have started to translate him. Won't you help me? Indeed, I cannot understand how his name can be unknown. The only explanation for this can only be the one he so often repeats, that is, that there is scarcely anyone but idiots in the world."&lt;/ref&gt; He said that what he has written in ''[[War and Peace]]'' is also said by Schopenhauer in ''The World as Will and Representation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/316432|title=Quietism from the Side of Happiness: Tolstoy, Schopenhauer, War and Peace|last=Thompson|first=Caleb|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jorge Luis Borges]] remarked that the reason he had never attempted to write a systematic account of his world view, despite his penchant for philosophy and metaphysics in particular, was because Schopenhauer had already written it for him.{{sfn|Magee|1997|p=413}}

Other figures in literature who were strongly influenced by Schopenhauer were [[Thomas Mann]], [[Afanasy Fet]], [[Joris-Karl Huysmans|J.-K. Huysmans]] and [[George Santayana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Santayana and Schopenhauer|last=Caleb Flamm|first=Matthew|journal=Transactions of the Charles S.

[[Sergei Prokofiev]], although initially reluctant to engage with works noted for their pessimism, became fascinated with Schopenhauer after reading ''Aphorisms on the Wisdom of LifeI'' in ''Parerga and ParalipomenaI.'' "With his truths Schopenhauer gave me a spiritual world and an awareness of happiness."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sergey Prokofiev and His World|last=Morrison|first=Simon|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2008|isbn=9780691138954|location=|pages=19, 20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] owed the awakening of his philosophical interest to reading ''The World as Will and Representation'' and admitted that he was one of the few philosophers that he respected, dedicating to him his essay ''Schopenhauer als Erzieher''&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Schopenhauer as Educator|Schopenhauer as Educator]]&lt;/ref&gt; one of his ''[[Untimely Meditations]]''.

[[File:DBP 1988 1357 Arthur Schopenhauer.jpg|thumb|Commemorative stamp of the Deutsche Bundespost]]

As a teenager, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] adopted Schopenhauer's epistemological idealism. However, after his study of the philosophy of mathematics, he rejected epistemological [[transcendental idealism]] for [[Gottlob Frege]]'s conceptual [[Metaphysical realism|realism]]. In later years, Wittgenstein was highly dismissive of Schopenhauer, describing him as an ultimately shallow thinker: "Schopenhauer has quite a crude mind ... where real depth starts, his comes to an end."&lt;ref name="Culture &amp; Value, p.24, 1933–4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, Norman. Ludwig Wittgenstein: A Memoir. Oxford University Press, 1958, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; His friend [[Bertrand Russell]] had a low opinion on the philosopher, and attacked him in his famous  [[History of Western Philosophy (Russell)|''History of Western Philosophy'']] for hypocritically praising asceticism yet not acting upon it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|title=History of Western Philosophy|year=1946|publisher=George Allen and Unwin LTD|location=Start of 2nd paragraph|page=786}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the opposite isle of Russell on the foundations of mathematics, the Dutch mathematician [[L. E. J. Brouwer]] incorporated the ideas of Kant and Schopenhauer in [[intuitionism]], where mathematics is considered a purely mental activity, instead of an analytic activity wherein objective properties of reality are revealed. Brouwer was also influenced by Schopenhauer's metaphysics, and wrote an essay on mysticism.

The '''Cyprus College of Art''' (CyCA) is an artists' studio group, located in the village of [[Lempa, Cyprus|Lempa]] on the west coast of [[Cyprus]]. It was founded in 1969 by the artist [[Stass Paraskos]]; the current director is the Cyprus-based artist [[Margaret Paraskos]]. 

== History ==
[[File:cyca larnaca.jpg|thumb|left|The former Cyprus College of Art building in the centre of [[Larnaca]].]]

The Cyprus College of Art was founded in 1969 by the Cypriot painter [[Stass Paraskos]], and is one of the oldest art institutions on the Mediterranean island of [[Cyprus]]. In the past it has been housed at different locations. It started life in the city of [[Famagusta]] on the east coast of Cyprus in 1969, but after a campaign by local hoteliers against the presence of impoverished artists and art students in a city increasingly focused on mass tourism, the College moved briefly to [[Larnaca]] in 1972, and then to [[Kato Paphos]] in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;See Michael Paraskos, 'A Voice in the Wilderness: Stass Paraskos and the Cyprus College of Art' in ''The Cyprus Dossier,'' no. 8 (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; With the arrival of the mass-tourism industry to Kato Paphos in the early 1980s, the local authorities there also asked the College to move and it was settled at its present site in the village of Lempa in 1985. In 2002 the College acquired premises in the city of [[Limassol]], run alongside the studios in Lempa, and the Limassol operation moved to Larnaca in 2007, becoming the Cornaro Institute. This was separated from the Cyprus College of Art in 2014, and now operates as an independent organisation.

The original aim of the Cyprus College of Art was not to provide formal courses, but to offer artists and art students from different countries the opportunity to spend a period of time making art in Cyprus. However, in the early 1970s the college planned to launch the first [[postgraduate]] [[fine art]] programme in Cyprus, but this was delayed by the Turkish invasion in 1974, and did not start until 1978. With the establishment of this programme, the Cyprus College of Art became the first true art school offering in higher education programmes, on the island of Cyprus.&lt;ref&gt;David Haste, et al, ''Stass Paraskos'' (London: Orage Press, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985 Stass Paraskos was joined by his daughter, [[Margaret Paraskos]], running the College. With the acquisition of additional premises in Limassol in 2002 the College launched several [[undergraduate]] fine art programmes. This included foundation, adult education and degree courses in [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[photography]] and [[printmaking]]. Almost all of the programmes taught at the College followed a British art education model, and several were validated in the [[United Kingdom]], although these validations were not accepted by the Cypriot government authorities. In 2007 the College's Limassol site was closed, and teaching transferred to a new building in [[Larnaca]] which became known as the Cornaro Institute, named after the last Venetian Queen of Cyprus [[Caterina Cornaro]]. From this time the site at Lempa concentrated on postgraduate programmes, and that at Larnaca on [[Foundation_course|foundation]] and undergraduate programmes. Both sites were also used to house visiting artists from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;The Cornaro Institute, ''The Cornaro Institute: An Introduction'' (Mitcham: Orage Press, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the death of Stass Paraskos in 2014, the Cyprus College of Art ceased to offer formal educational courses and de-registered as a college of education with the Cyprus Ministry of Education and Culture. The Cornaro Institute in Larnaca was separated from the College and became an independent institution, and the College in Lempa became a studio and residency centre for artists and art students from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;See Michael Paraskos, 'A Voice in the Wilderness: Stass Paraskos and the Cyprus College of Art' in ''The Cyprus Dossier,'' no. 8 (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation and ethos==

The foundation of the College in 1969 was highly unusual. Although Stass Paraskos had visited Cyprus in 1968 with the British poet Martin Bell, and met with the first President of Cyprus, [[Archbishop Makarios]], to discuss opening an art school in Cyprus,&lt;ref&gt;Michael Paraskos, ''In Search of Sixpence'' (London: Friction Press, 2016) p. 105f&lt;/ref&gt; the initial impetus for starting the Cyprus College of Art came from an informal discussion in a [[public house|pub]] in the English city of [[Leeds]], where Paraskos was a tutor at the [[Leeds College of Art]]. 
In this discussion it was suggested Paraskos organise a summer trip for the art students and tutors to Cyprus. Agreeing to do this, Paraskos started an annual event, which attracted students from other British art schools, and eventually grew into the Cyprus College of Art.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Paraskos, 'Stass's College of Art', in David Haste, et al. in ''Stass Paraskos'' (London: Orage Press, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; This informal start led by artists remains a central part of the ethos of CyCA today, with artists rather than administrators still playing a central role in the institution, and stressing the freedom of the artist to be a creative being rather than under the control of academic bureaucracies.&lt;ref&gt;See Ludmila Fidlerová, Lucie Bartoňková, Barbora Svátková, 'Teaching is organic' in ''Veřejnost a kouzlo vizuality / Sympozium České sekce INSEA. 1.'' (Brno: Masarykova univerzita, 2008). {{ISBN|978-80-210-4722-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sculpture wall and garden==

The Cyprus College of Art's campus in Lempa is surrounded by a large sculpture wall and garden, open to the public. This was created over a period of over twenty-five years from 1989 by Stass Paraskos, together with many of the artists and art students who have visited the College. The wall is a major landmark and tourist attraction in the region, attracting visitors to the village to see sculptures of a King Kong-sized gorilla, a donkey known as 'the art critic' and numerous other animals and human figures, as well as abstract elements. These are all constructed from found materials and cement.&lt;ref&gt;Jos Simon, The Rough Guide to Cyprus (London: Penguin Books, 2013) p.126&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy with Manifesta==

In 2005, the International Manifesta Organisation, based in the [[Netherlands]] announced that the art festival [[Manifesta#Manifesta_6.2C_Nicosia.2C_Cyprus.2C_2006|Manifesta 6]] would be held in Cyprus in 2006. The Cyprus College of Art was initially enthusiastic about the prospect of an international art fair in Cyprus, publishing a supporting article in the College newsletter, ''ArtCyprus'' about Manifesta.&lt;ref&gt;Helene Black, ''Planning for the Future, or what our village needs now,'' in ''ArtCyprus,'' no. 1, Spring 2006, 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

However a perceived unwillingness by the Manifesta organisers to engage with the College and the Cypriot art world resulted in the College becoming one of Manifesta 6's fiercest critics. This was compounded by the Manifesta team claiming there was no functioning art school in Cyprus, a charge that resulted in CyCA dedicating an entire issue of ArtCyprus to attacking Manifesta, accusing the Dutch organisation of cultural insensitivity bordering on racism.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Paraskos, 'In Darkest Cyprus' ''Cyprus Weekly,'' (newspaper) 20 January 2006 {{cite web |url=http://85.92.87.111/~artcypr/In_Darkest_Cyprus.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706052456/http://85.92.87.111/~artcypr/In_Darkest_Cyprus.jpg |archivedate=2011-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rebirth and development ==

The [[2012–13 Cypriot financial crisis|economic crisis]] that hit Cyprus in 2013 had a major detrimental effect on the finances of the College, resulting in falling student recruitment. Coupled with the death of the founder of the College, Stass Paraskos, in 2014, it was decided in 2014 to cease offering educational courses and return the College to being a centre for visiting artists.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Paraskos, 'A Voice in the Wilderness: Stass Paraskos and the Cyprus College of Art' in ''The Cyprus Dossier,'' no. 8 (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in the separation of the Cyprus College of Art in Lempa from the Cornaro Institute in Larnaca, and with the focus of the College now firmly on Lempa, work has begun with Lempa Parish Council on upgrading the facilities in Lempa to operate the site solely as an artists' studio complex. Following the death of Stass Paraskos, his daughter Margaret became director of the Cyprus College of Art.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10165">The '''Design Piracy Prohibition Act''', {{USBill|110|H.R.|2033}}, {{USBill|110|S.|1957}}, and {{USBill|111|H.R.|2196}}, were [[bill (law)|bills]] of the same name introduced in the [[United States Congress]] that would have amended [[Title 17 of the United States Code]] to provide ''[[sui generis]]'' protection to [[fashion design]]s for a period of three years.  The Acts would have extend protection to "the appearance as a whole of an article of apparel, including its ornamentation," with "apparel" defined to include "men's, women's, or children's clothing, including undergarments, outerwear, gloves, footwear, and headgear;" "handbags, purses, and tote bags;" belts, and eyeglass frames.  In order to receive the three-year term of protection, the designer would be required to [[copyright registration|register]] with the [[U.S. Copyright Office]] within three months of going public with the design.

==H.R. 2511, 112th Congress==
H.R. 2511 was introduced July 13, 2011 by Representative Robert Goodlatte [R-VA6] with thirteen co-sponsors. On August 25, 2011, the [[U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary]] referred the Bill to the [[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property|U.S. House Subcomittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property]].
http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h112-2511

==H.R. 2033, 110th Congress==
H.R. 2033 was introduced April 25, 2007 by Representative [[Bill Delahunt]] with fourteen co-sponsors. On May 4, 2007 the [[U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary]] referred the Bill to the [[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property|U.S. House Subcomittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property]]. A hearing was held February 14, 2008, but the bill never made it out of the subcommittee.

==S. 1957, 110th Congress==
S. 1957 was introduced on August 2, 2007, in [[Washington, D.C.]] by Senator [[Charles Schumer]] (D-NY) with ten co-sponsors. The bill was referred to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary but progressed no further.

==H.R. 2196, 111th Congress==
H.R. 2196 was introduced on April 30, 2009, by Representative Delahunt and twenty-three co-sponsors. The bill was referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary on the same day and then stalled in committee.

==Current Status of Fashion Design Protection==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
Currently, fashion may only be protected by [[copyright]] to the extent that its shape is non-utilitarian enough to qualify as a creative "sculpture," or to the extent that a design, pattern, or image on the clothing qualifies as "pictorial" or "graphic." While current laws against [[counterfeit goods]] do provide some protection for designers, this is so only when the trademark is used and not when merely the design is copied under a different label. In addition, fashion may be protected by design patents if the requirements for patentability are met.  To be patentable an ornamental design must be new, original and non-obvious.  The United States Patent and Trademark Office website (www.uspto.gov) has a searchable database of patents, and includes patents on apparel in class D2, carrying articles in class D3, and eyeglass frames in class D16. Technological advances to the means of textile and garment production, as well as increases in the number of distribution channels and the availability of cheap labor in emerging economies have enabled those who would copy these designs to do so quickly and inexpensively. Legislation targeting design piracy has already been enacted in [[Europe]], [[India]], and [[Japan]].

==Criticism==
Critics claim that, contrary to the bill's claims, the bill will actually harm independent [[fashion designer]]s. The majority of independent designers do not have the litigation funds to effectively challenge big business should they be accused of [[copyright infringement]]. Furthermore, because distributors of accused designs can be penalized as well as the designer, distributors of clothing will become very wary of new designs unless the designer has adequate funds, influence, and power to hire skilled and effective lawyers. Pattern companies frequently utilize prevailing trends; so they too are vulnerable. Because of the legal risks of producing fashion patterns, fewer people will sew their own clothing, and fabric and sewing stores will suffer losses as well. As evidence of the bill's hypocrisy, critics point to how one of the most vocal supporters of the bill, [[Diane von Fürstenberg]], was recently caught copying and distributing a piece of clothing originally designed by an independent Canadian designer. Critics also argue that the industry is already thriving commercially and encourages innovation.  They point attention to the concept that originality in fashion design is too insubstantial for copyright law to distinguish protected elements from non-protected elements, and that extending copyright protection would stifle independent designers while giving powerful, big-business fashion houses a near-[[monopoly]].

==Related Bills==

===H.R. 5055, 109th Congress: To Amend Title 17, United States Code, to Provide Protection for Fashion Design===
H.R. 5055 was introduced March 30, 2006 by Representative [[Robert W. Goodlatte]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Virginia|Va.]]), with six co-sponsors from both parties. The bill was referred by the [[U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary]] to the [[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property|U.S. House Subcomittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property]].

The subcommittee held a hearing on the bill on July 27, 2006, at which there was disagreement among legal experts as well as representatives of the fashion industry as to whether there was a need for copyright protection.  Proponents of the Act claimed that new technology threatened American designers' ability to compete with the products of lower-cost countries, because the distribution of images of new designs and the automation of copying and manufacturing could occur within hours.  They additionally pointed out that the United States was the exception among western nations in failing to protect designs.

===S. 3728, 111th Congress: Innovative Design Protection and Piracy Prevention Act===
S.3728 was introduced on August 5, 2010, by Senator [[Chuck Schumer]] with ten co-sponsors. On December 1, 2010, the Senate Committee on the Judiciary voted unanimously for the bill to proceed to the Senate floor. This is the furthest that any of the design bills has progressed since 2006.

Under the IDPPPA, a copy of a design would have infringed if it was found to be "substantially identical" to the original work with little to no changes to set that design apart. Penalties for false representation would have been increased from $500 to $5,000 and from $1,000 to $10,000. "Apparel" items that would be protected by this Act include women's, men's, and children's clothing as well as luggage, handbags, wallets and eyeglass frames. A "fashion design" under the IDPPPA would be defined as an entire article of apparel including its embellishment and also includes elements of the original apparel that are the creative work of the original designer and are unique.

Supporters argue that this act would create more protection for fashion designers. Opponents have argued that the bill would "bring more lawyers into every step of the design process," outlaw "inspiration and creativity," prevent "unrestricted use of works in the public domain," and "slow down the fast-paced design process."[http://designer-entrepreneurs.com/blog/illustrations/DPPA_ABadPlanforAmericasDesigners.pdf] Some designers have supported the IDPPPA for protecting their current and future fashion designs. For example, Kurt Courtney of the AAFA has praised the bill as a "great compromise and a product of hard work," but added that its effects will largely be seen in court cases involving the bill.&lt;ref&gt;[BNA's Patent, Trademark &amp; Copyright Journal, December 3, 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===S. 3523, 112th Congress: Innovative Design Protection Act===

S.3523 was introduced on September 10, 2012, by Senator [[Chuck Schumer]] with ten co-sponsors. On September 20, 2012, the Senate Committee on the Judiciary voted for the bill to proceed to the Senate floor without amendment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/D?d112:2:./temp/~bdJNnQ::|/home/LegislativeData.php?n=BSS;c=112  "Bill Summary &amp; Status, 112th Congress (2011-12), S. 3523"], [[THOMAS]].

Paris, France: CUMULUS // DRS.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cross, N. (2007). Editorial: Forty Years of Design Research, ''Design Studies'', Vol. 28, No. 1&lt;/ref&gt; is an international society for developing and supporting the interests of the [[design research]] community. The primary purpose of the DRS, as embodied in its first statement of rules, is to promote ‘the study of and research into the process of designing in all its many fields'. This established the intention of being an interdisciplinary [[Learned|learned society]], taking a scholarly and domain independent view of the process of designing. Membership is open to anyone interested in design research, and members with established experience and a strong background in design research may apply to be elected as a DRS Fellow.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.designresearchsociety.org/cpages/fellows]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The origins of the Society lay in the first conference on [[design methods]],&lt;ref&gt;Jones, J. C. and D. G. Thornley, (eds.) (1963). ''Conference on Design Methods''. Oxford, UK, [[Pergamon Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; (full title "The Conference on Systematic and Intuitive Methods in Engineering, Industrial Design, Architecture and Communications") held in London in 1962, which enabled a core of people to be identified who shared interests in new approaches to the process of designing.

==Early history==
Initially, the DRS promoted its aims through a series of one-day conferences and the publication of a quarterly newsletter to members. However, within a few years, unsuccessful attempts to establish a published journal&lt;ref&gt;Booker, P. J. and P. A. Slann (eds.) (1968). DRS Newsletter, Vol. 1, No. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; and fruitless internal debate about the Society's goals led to inactivity. The Society was revived by its first major international conference, on design participation,&lt;ref&gt;Cross, N. (ed.) (1972). Design Participation. London, UK, Academy Editions.&lt;/ref&gt; held in Manchester in 1971. At that conference a meeting of DRS members led to a call for a special general meeting of the Society, and to changes of officers and council members. Subsequently, a series of conferences was held through the 1970s and 80s: in London (1973), Portsmouth (1976,&lt;ref&gt;Evans, B., J. Powell, and R. Talbot (eds.) (1982). Changing Design. Chichester, UK, John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; 1980&lt;ref&gt;Jacques, R. and J. Powell (eds.) (1981). Design:Science:Method. Guildford, UK, Westbury House.&lt;/ref&gt;), Istanbul (1978), and Bath (1984).

In the mid-1970s DRS also collaborated with the Design Methods Group, based in the USA, including publishing a joint journal, Design Research and Methods.

==Publications and conferences==
By the late 1970s there was enough enthusiasm, and evidence of design research activity around the world, for the DRS to approach IPC Press (now Elsevier Science) with a successful proposal for its own journal.  [http://www.journals.elsevier.com/design-studies/ Design Studies], the international journal for design research, was launched in 1979. A monthly internet news bulletin DesignResearchNews was started in 1998 and has over 9000 subscribers. Between 2006 and 2009 the Society also published a quarterly newsletter, Design Research Quarterly.

A new biennial series of DRS conferences began in 2002 with the 'Common Ground' conference in London. Subsequent ones have been held at venues around the world, with a variety of themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roworth-Stokes|first=Seymour|title=The Design Research Society and Emerging Themes in Design Research|journal=Journal of Product Innovation Management|date=June 2011|volume=28|issue=3|pages=419–424|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5885.2011.00815.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-5885.2011.00815.x/abstract|accessdate=17 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; See the Table below. In 2005 DRS was one of the founding members of the International Association of Societies of Design Research (IASDR),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IASDR|url=https://iasdr.net|publisher=IASDR|accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which also holds biennial, international conferences.

==Special Interest Groups==
Special Interest Groups provide a forum for specific areas of research which are of interest to the Design Research Community and its members. SIGs organise events and discussion in a number of ways to facilitate the exchange and development of best practice in the field. Each SIG is organised by a convenor who is supported by an organising group and the SIG members. DRS members are invited to join any Special Interest Group to contribute actively to research in the subject area of their chosen group.&lt;ref name="tovey"/&gt;

===Special Interest Group on Experiential Knowledge (EKSIG)===
EKSIG is concerned with the understanding and role of knowledge in research and professional practice in design in order to clarify fundamental principles and practices of using design practice within research both with regard to research regulations and requirements, and research methodology.

The main aims of EKSIG are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Experiential Knowledge Special Interest Group's Aims|url=http://www.experientialknowledge.org.uk/aims.html|publisher=EKSIG|accessdate=3 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Investigate and advance the understanding of 'knowledge' and 'contribution to knowledge' in design research, especially in areas where designing forms part of the research process
*Develop principles and criteria of research in design for employing different kinds of knowledge and means for the communication of knowledge
*Promote the implementation of such principles and criteria within current research policy to promote quality and standards in research
*Promote the implementation of such principles and criteria within research practice through the development of appropriate methodology to promote quality and best practice in research

EKSIG runs a biennial conference series, special strands at the DRS and IASDR conferences. It also runs a discussion list, which is used for announcements and debate about the core issues of knowledge and methodology in research and practice in the creative disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Niedderer|first=Kristina|title=Special Interest Group on Experiential Knowledge (EKSIG)|url=http://www.designresearchsociety.org/joomla/sig2/eksig.html|publisher=DRS|accessdate=3 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617050546/http://www.designresearchsociety.org/joomla/sig2/eksig.html#|archive-date=2012-06-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All papers selected for presentation at the conference are published in the conference proceedings: an abstract booklet with a CD or USB of the full papers and post-conference online publication, the preferred format of the DRS. Selected papers from each conference have been published in an appropriate journal as a special issue: ''[http://www.intellectbooks.co.uk/journals/view-issue,id=1387/ Journal of Visual Arts Practice]'' in 2007, ''[http://jrp.icaap.org/index.php/jrp/issue/view/14 Journal of Research Practice] ''in 2010, ''[http://www.intellectbooks.co.uk/journals/view-issue,id=2327/ Journal of Art and Design Education in Higher Education] ''in 2012, ''[http://www.intellectbooks.co.uk/journals/view-issue,id=2327/ Journal of Art and Design Education in Higher Education] ''and in 2015, ''[http://jrp.icaap.org/index.php/jrp/issue/view/24/ Journal of Research Practice] ''.

===Special Interest Group on Wellbeing and Happiness (SIGWELL)===
The SIG focuses on bringing together designers, design researchers, landscape architects and others who aim to improve personal and societal wellbeing through design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Coles|first=Richard|title=Special Interest Group on Wellbeing and Happiness (SIGWELL)|url=http://www.designresearchsociety.org/joomla/sig2/sigwell.html|publisher=DRS|accessdate=3 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616102120/http://www.designresearchsociety.org/joomla/sig2/sigwell.html#|archive-date=2012-06-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design Pedagogy Special Interest Group (PedSIG)===
This SIG  on design pedagogy aims to bring together design researchers, teachers and practitioners, and others responsible for the delivery of design education, to clarify and  develop the role of design research in providing the theoretical underpinning for design education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tovey|first=Michael|title=SIG on Design Pedagogy|url=http://www.designresearchsociety.org/joomla/sig2/sig-desped.html|publisher=DRS|accessdate=3 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719105954/http://www.designresearchsociety.org/joomla/sig2/sig-desped.html#|archive-date=2012-07-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The DRS Design Pedagogy Special Interest Group is bringing together other research which is directed to similar ends.  Design research is not an irrelevant activity living in its own little ghetto, but rather it provides the basis for the academic core of design teaching and pedagogic innovation. By that means through the provision of the next generation of designers it links into design practice.&lt;ref name="tovey"/&gt;
The DRS PedSIG runs special streams at DRS biannual conferences. It also organised symposia which were hosted by the Coventry University on 27 March 2009 and 28 January 2011.

In 2010, the DRS PedSIG and CUMULUS Association have join forces to develop a bi-annual international research events. The 1st International Symposium for Design Education Researchers [http://www.adm.heacademy.ac.uk/events/researching-design-education] in collaboration with: CUMULUS Association; Design Research Society (DRS); five other international universities (which included: [[Aalto University]], L'École de Design Nantes Atlantique, [[Coventry University]], L'École Parsons à Paris, and [[Politecnico di Milano]]); the Lieu de Design, Chambre de commerce et d’industrie de Paris and AVA Publishing. The symposium was held in a prestigious location of [[:fr:Bourse de commerce de Paris]]  in May 2011. A special issue of Collection, a research journal, has been produced featuring a selection of contributions. The 2nd International Conference for Design Research Educators, [https://web.archive.org/web/20130621191140/http://www.hioa.no/eng/About-HiOA/Fakultet-for-teknologi-kunst-og-design/DRS-CUMULUS-Oslo-2013 DRS//CUMULUS 2013], was hosted by the Oslo and Akershus University College of Applied Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hioa.no/eng/About-HiOA/Fakultet-for-teknologi-kunst-og-design/DRS-CUMULUS-Oslo-2013# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-07-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621191140/http://www.hioa.no/eng/About-HiOA/Fakultet-for-teknologi-kunst-og-design/DRS-CUMULUS-Oslo-2013# |archive-date=2013-06-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special Interest Group for Objects, Practices, Experiences, Networks (OPENSIG)===
The OPENSiG was originally launched in 2007 under the name ‘Emotion, Experience and Interaction’.  A special strand at the DRS conference 2008 and two successful workshops at Sheffield Hallam University (2007) and Nottingham Trent University (2010) served to define the group’s interest in broad questions about human-object interactions – focusing on Objects and engaging with social Practices, which involve Experiences with/ of objects in Networks of relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fisher|first=Tom|title=Objects, Practices, Experiences, Networks (OPENSiG)|url=http://www.designresearchsociety.org/joomla/sig2/opensig.html|publisher=DRS|accessdate=3 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509015022/http://www.designresearchsociety.org/joomla/sig2/opensig.html#|archive-date=2012-05-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inclusive Design Special Interest Group (Inclusive SIG)===
The Inclusive Design Research Special Interest Group (InclusiveSIG) aims to provide an international platform for researchers, design practitioners, design educators and students, and the general public to exchange knowledge about inclusive design and to empower wider participation in design.

===Design Research Society’s Design Innovation Management Special Interest Group (DIMSIG)===
Design Research Society’s Design Innovation Management Special Interest Group (DIMSIG) in collaboration with the Design Society’s Design Management Special Interest Group (DeMSIG) formed a cross-societal working party named the Design Management Academy (DMA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://designmanagementacademy.com/|title=Design Management Academy – … bringing researchers together|website=designmanagementacademy.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Design School at [[Hong Kong Polytechnic]] hosted the first Design Management Academy international conference in June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://designmanagementacademy.com/dma2017/|title=Design Management Academy 2017 Hong Kong|website=Design Management Academy 2017 Hong Kong|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Deutsches Filminstitut - DIF''' ("German Film Institute") is an institute for the study of film, based in [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Germany]].

==History==
The Deutsches Filminstitut was founded on 13 April 1949 as the Deutsches Institut für Filmkunde (DIF). In 1952, the [[Deutsches Filmarchiv]] ("German Film Archive"; founded in [[Marburg]] in 1947 by Hanns Wilhelm Lavies as the Archiv für Filmwissenschaft) was set up as an autonomous department of the DIF, from which it separated again after a reorganisation in 1956.&lt;ref name=Kirchner&gt;{{cite book|last=Kirchner|first=Daniela|title=Film and Television Collections in Europe: The MAP-TV Guide|year=1995|publisher=Blueprint|location=London|isbn= 1857130154 |pages=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 January 1959, Lavies left the DIF and was succeeded as director by [[Max Lippmann]]. Dr Theo Fürstenau became director in 1966, and in 1981 Dr. Gerd Albrecht. The director from 1 February 1997 until September 2017 was Claudia Dillmann.

On 30 October 1999, the name was officially changed to Deutsches Filminstitut - DIF. In January 2006 the organisation merged with the [[Deutsches Filmmuseum]] ("German Film Museum"), also based in Frankfurt am Main.

==Functions==
The Deutsches Filminstitut has one of the largest film archives in Germany and one of the most comprehensive collections of material on all aspects of [[cinematography]] and [[Film|cinema]].

Current projects include:
* The edition and publication of the censorship decisions of the Berliner Film-Oberprüfstelle ("Berlin Film Inspection Point") from 1920 to 1938
* COLLATE - a collaborative system for the annotation and indexing of archive material
* [[filmportal.de]] - an internet portal for German film
* [[Filmarchives online|filmarchives-online.eu]] - union catalogue of European film archives
* EFG - The [[European Film Gateway]] - a single access point to digital collections held in European film archives and cinémathèques

The DIF is a founding member of the Deutscher Kinemathekenverbund ("German Union of Cinematheques").

'''Documentary practice''' is the process of creating documentary projects.  It refers to what people do with media devices, content, form, and production strategies in order to address the creative, ethical, and conceptual problems and choices that arise as they make documentary films or other similar presentations based on fact or reality.  Colleges and universities offer courses and programs in documentary practice (see External Links).

Traditional definitions put forth by scholars of documentary film address documentary practice in terms of formal codes, categories and conventions.  These are  used by filmmakers to create "non-fictional" representations of the historical world.&lt;ref&gt;''Representing Reality: Issues and Concepts in Documentary,'' [[Bill Nichols]], Indiana University Press, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent definitions made by others define various approaches to documentary in terms of how they use such [[rhetorical]] strategies as voice, structure and style.&lt;ref&gt;''Rhetoric and Representation in Nonfiction Film,'' Carl Platinga, Cambridge University Press, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Such definitions focus on finished documentary projects and how they measure up to contemporary notions of truth and representation.

However, recent cultural, technological, stylistic, and social shifts have turned attention in documentary studies to the process of documenting as such. Documentary-makers and scholars alike are showing  interest in the present moment and how new media tools can be used by documentary-makers to initiate formation of new communities, conversations, and ways of being together.

Such interests characterized [[Conceptual Art]] works of the 1960s and 1970s.  The connective potentialities of art as a practice are currently being explored in the contemporary [[Relational Aesthetics]] movement.  In these movements, the potentialities and dilemmas of aesthetic practice take precedence over traditional concerns with the finished artwork.  Likewise, growing interest in documentary as a practice is opening the definition of documentary beyond considerations of finished documents, to include the act of documenting itself.  This expansion of the definition of documentary work became possible when consumer-level video cameras became widely available.&lt;ref&gt;''The Collective Camcorder in Art and Activism: 1968-2000'', Jesse Drew.  In ''Collectivism After Modernism,'', B. Stimson and G. Shollette, eds., University of Minnesota Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Some collectives of video producers used this new technology to address issues such as politics of cultural representation, the critique of daily life, the deconstruction of culture control mechanisms, and the subversion of authority.

While practices of documentary-makers continue to be informed by existing documentary traditions, [[Conventions in documentary]], and genres, they are also reshaped by emerging media environments, content, devices and uses for those devices.  Emerging media, in turn, are greatly affected by their political, economic, and cultural contexts. Various emerging technologies and the situations in which they are used present documentary-makers with new challenges, opportunities, and dilemmas. This makes documentary practice dynamic and ever-evolving.

Many documentary-makers seek innovative approaches to their field in response to emerging technologies and the practices they make possible. Continuous innovation in documentary practice prevents the "documentary idea"&lt;ref&gt;''The Documentary Idea: A Critical History of English-Language Documentary Film and Video,'' Jack C. Ellis, Prentice Hall, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Doing Documentary Work,'' Robert Coles, Oxford University Press, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; from becoming stagnant or locked into any single generic form.  This challenges each generation of documentary-makers and viewers to approach documentary-making as a living practice.

== Emerging media ==
New documentary practices associated with [[cinéma vérité]] and [[Direct Cinema]] began to appear in the mid-1950s when technological developments made film and then [[video]] more portable, accessible and affordable.  This allowed more people to engage in the practice of documenting. The 1991 video of [[Rodney King]] being subjected to police restraint is an example of the continuing power of this shift.  An ordinary citizen was able to capture the [[police brutality]] with his camcorder, transforming him from a witness to an amateur documentary filmmaker. Scholars have cited the events following the widespread dissemination of the Rodney King video as one of the earliest examples of "[[participatory culture]]."&lt;ref&gt;''Rethinking Media Change: The Aesthetics of Transition,'' [[Henry Jenkins]], MIT Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Today's [[new media]] continue to reshape documentary practices in significant ways.  Recording technologies embedded within personal portable devices such as video-equipped [[mobile phones]] and hand-held [[digital video]] and still cameras have made it possible for vast numbers of people to engage in [[citizen journalism]] and "documentary practices." Additionally, [[Web 2.0]] platforms such as video and photo-sharing websites and [[blogs]] now enable amateur "documentarians" to share and collaborate on content in ways never before possible. A practice that [[Howard Rheingold]] and [[Justin Hall]] have labeled ''[[Peer-to-peer (meme)|p2p Journalism]],'' now exists at the blurred boundary where traditional definitions of [[journalism]] and [[Documentary film|documentary]] meet and influence each other.

Promises of new media technologies have raised expectations of a freer flow of ideas and content.  Scholars are studying how participants in documenting practices engage in the social process of acquiring knowledge, sharing stories, and documenting events-in-the-making.  Through such practices, social ties among people and groups as they arbitrate what qualifies as knowledge evolve continuously, facilitating the emergence of what [[Pierre Lévy (philosopher)|Pierre Lévy]] refers to as ''[[collective intelligence]]''.

By enabling more people to record and share their experiences, emerging media technologies have transformed the way people document reality and how they participate in the very events that they are documenting.  Everyday life can become performative as people respond to encounters and events through documentary practices, creating records of daily life which they then share with others via the Internet.  For many people, digital media-making becomes a form of documentary practice when the results are created for and shared via social-networking sites like [[MySpace]], [[Flickr]] and [[Facebook]].

The 2006 documentary of a [[Beastie Boys]] concert, ''Awesome; I F***n' Shot That!'', directed by [[Adam Yauch]], is an example of how participation in documentary practices transforms the way people take part in events such as concerts. A live performance in 2004 was documented by 50 fans who were all given Hi8 cameras and told to film their experience of the concert.  Their footage was later edited together with professionally shot footage.  It provided contrasting points of view and established dialogue between artists and fans.&lt;ref&gt;''Awesome I F***n' Shot That!: User-Generated Content in Documentary Film, online at http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/mit5/papers/Porst AwesomePaper.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars argue that as an increasingly widespread practice, the nascent cellphone documentary genre creates more possibilities and forms of social agency; people use cell phones to document public events and network their collective responses;&lt;ref&gt;''Smart Mobs: The Next Social Revolution,'' Howard Rheingold, Perseus Books, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; others have used their phones to mobilize crowds during public demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cell Phone and the Crowd: Messianic Politics in the Contemporary Philippines,'', Rafael Vincente, published in ''Public Culture'' Vol. 15 No. 3, 2003.  Vincente writes: "The crowd itself takes on a kind of communicative power, serving up channels for sending messages at a distance and bringing distances up close."  http://communication.ucsd.edu/people/f_rafael_cellphonerev_files.htm_{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mobile communications devices ==
The pursuit of "filmic truth" has been a hallmark of documentary practice since early film-makers such as the [[Lumiere Brothers]], [[Robert Flaherty]] and [[Dziga Vertov]] created its foundations. (see External Links)

Today, people use mobile devices in ways that open new possibilities for the practices of documenting—especially those practices involved in efforts to achieve "filmic truth."  For example, in June 2006 a 93-minute remake of [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]]'s documentary entitled ''[[Love Meetings]]'' (1965), in which he interviewed Italian citizens about their views on sex in postwar Italy, was shot entirely on a cell phone by [[:it:Marcello Mencarini]] and [[Barbara Seghezzi]]. Entitled ''New Love Meetings'', the remake was filmed in MPEG4 format using a Nokia N90. It is the first feature-length movie to be shot entirely on a mobile phone.   Their premise was that even though they asked their subjects the same questions that Pasolini had posed, the results of their documentary would be clearly influenced by the medium they used to capture the images. They believed that the use of a cellphone, an instrument of daily life, produced an intimacy absent in Pasolini's movie, making people more spontaneous and open, creating a dialogue more like a chat than an interview. They propose that the line between subject and observer becomes thinner through such practices, as the documentary film-makers present themselves as "normal people" using their cell phones to preserve an instant.  ''New Love Meetings'' is a prime example of how a specific emerging technology, the mobile phone, is shifting documentary practice today. (see External Links)

The use of the so-called "[[fourth screen]]" (the first screen being cinema, the second television, the third the computer, the fourth the mobile device) as a documentary tool has become a subject of academic study. In fall of 2007, graduate students of [[The New School]] produced an experimental five-minute metadocumentary shot with three cell phones.  It explored the possibilities of mobile media devices as a medium for documentary practice by using them to restate Dziga Vertov's perspectives on filmic truth as expressed in his film: ''[[Man with a Movie Camera]]''.

'== '''Surveillance media
[[Surveillance]] is the act of observation or monitoring, usually of places, people, and activity, and typically without the subject's knowledge. Much of contemporary surveillance involves observation from a distance with the help of electronic devices, such as [[telephone tapping]], [[Parabolic microphone|directional microphones]], [[covert listening device]]s or "bugs", [[subminiature camera]]s, [[closed-circuit television]], [[GPS tracking|GPS (Global Positioning System) tracking]], [[electronic tagging]], [[Video tracking|motion tracking]], [[satellite]]s, [[Computer surveillance|internet and computer surveillance]].

Historically, surveillance has often been associated with governmental and other large organizational security practices.  However, artists and activists have challenged those conventional practices.  An early example is the film ''[[Empire (1964 film)|Empire]]'', made by artist [[Andy Warhol]] in 1964.  It consisted of an extreme long shot of the [[Empire State Building]], held for eight hours in real time, challenging the boundaries of surveillance and watchability. More recently, scholars such as UCLA cinema professor Steve Mamber, have turned attention to the growing trend of using inexpensive, small cameras to unobtrusively record events of daily life. To examine hidden-camera video practices, in 2003 Mamber asked acquaintances if they or anyone they knew might have access to such footage, creating an online archive of the footage. Mamber described the growing practice as "both a widely pervasive activity and an oddly unexamined one."  In response, he established the UCLA Center for Hidden Camera Research, another example of how emerging technologies are shifting documentary practice. (see External Links)

Another practice that has emerged from the introduction of new surveillance technologies is "inverse surveillance", also known as [[Sousveillance]]. Launched in 2004, CARPE (Capture, Archival and Retrieval of Personal Experiences)is a project conceived with the idea of recording and archiving one's whole life. Some of the technologies developed within this project have become potential new tools of documentary practice.  For example, the [[EyeTap]], developed by University of Toronto Professor Steve Mann, presents itself as an ideal device for continuous and inconspicuous recording as well as inverse surveillance.

Some scholars assert that these new devices enable us to imagine a new form of citizenship (the "monitorial citizen") that hinges on documentary practices. This concept is illustrated by parents watching their small children at the community pool. They look inactive, but they are poised for action if action is required. The emphasis is not so much on information gathering as it is on keeping a watchful eye—even while the monitorial citizen is doing something else.&lt;ref&gt;''Changing Concepts of Democracy,'' [[Michael Schudson]], http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/papers/schudson.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Projects such as The Canary Project's photographic monitoring of global warming effects (see External Links) and the [[Center for Land Use Interpretation]]'s Data Base of citizen-created documentation of land use practices exemplify the link between surveillance, emerging documentary practices and monitorial citizenship.

The [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], in partnership with [[Amnesty International]], presents another example of how new media are allowing surveillance and documentary practices to inform each other.  This partnership uses [[satellite imagery]] to help [[NGO]]s  document atrocities in isolated crisis zones such as [[Darfur]] and [[Zimbabwe]]. By purchasing images from commercial satellites that correspond to mapping coordinates, NGOs are increasingly able to provide visual evidence of refugee camps and burned villages; events and activities that would be impossible to image without the satellite technology. (see External Links)

== Mapping applications ==
Traditionally, [[map]]s have been created to orient people.  They have delineated boundaries by using static, two-dimensional symbols to represent dynamic, three-dimensional spaces that undergo continual change. Both form and content are fixed in these traditional maps, leaving out the real-time experiences of those people who live in and define the space being represented.  However, the proliferation of portable media devices that can record and distribute digital images, video, audio and text, combined with the capability to reach previously unreachable audiences via the Web and through vast wireless networks, now makes it possible to transform conventional maps into living documents.

New, map-based documentary practices employ maps as useful tools for interrogating the present, transforming maps from static representations into events-in-the-making.  Personal narratives, experiences, and memories are being used to create maps that represent social and cultural space as well as physical space.  Often, the goal in such projects is to evoke a more diverse and dynamic portrait of human experience as it is actually lived. (see External Links)

For example, programs that involve community members and youth in active community mapping for social empowerment include [[Amigos de las Américas]], Video Machete in Chicago, as well as Community Youth Mapping and Mapping Within (see External Links).  There have been significant efforts to use community mapping practices to promote environmentally sound practices, including [[Green Map]]ping (see External Link) which involves locals in identifying and siting (on a map) ecology-minded ("green") businesses, spaces, and organizations.  A recent California effort involves citizens in mapping forest fires and related community action plan. A variety of resources are available to support those involved in mapping, including resource lists, guidelines, and lesson plans. (see External Links)

Sonic representations of place, sometimes called "soundmaps," challenge traditional assumptions of what maps can do and offer new ways of participating in documentary practice. Soundmaps extend opportunities for defining place and expressing local culture, and they offer the added dimension of time. By enabling the integration of sound, text, still and moving images, mapping uniquely allows for more choices of representation and documentation without necessarily privileging one form above the rest.  By doing so, voice is given to more ways of knowing and expressing—including '[[remixing]]', for example—in a way that recognizes and affirms the diversity of experiences and representations within communities. (see External Links)

The emergence of the ''[[Geoweb]]'' is another example of how changes in the ways people document geographical space is also broadening notions of documentary practice. ''Geoweb'' refers to virtual maps or "geobrowsers" such as [[Google Earth]] that allow users to search for images, texts, videos or other media content through interactive, photographic maps of the earth. All information on a geoweb is organized by geographic tags tied to a particular location on the map. Since its inception, usage of the Geoweb has been widespread and varied; including  recreational, humanitarian, political and military uses. (see External Links) New mapping technologies make new documentary practices imaginable by allowing documentary producers to locate, store, share, and network images and information that capture the ever-shifting landscapes of the world, updated in real-time.
 
On the global scale, access to new media with potential to generate new documentary practices is still confined to an economically privileged few, giving rise to the ''[[digital divide]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''You Call This A Democracy?'' (afterword), Paul Kivel, APEX, 2004, http://www.cipa-apex.org/books/you_call_this_a_democracy/&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the first digital divide was largely due to economics and politics of broadband cable and expensive computers needed to access the internet.  With the proliferation of wireless networks and mobile phones, the divide has diminished considerably, as more remote areas are easier to reach through wireless signals and mobile devices are far less expensive than computers.  While there is great potential for new technologies to continue to broaden definitions of documentary practice, enabling more people to collaborate and “document from within” their own communities, questions about who controls and regulates the networks and distribution methods as well as the increasingly advanced skill needed to fully participate in emerging practices will likely be a core question for some time.

'''Elizabeth Gray''' (née Sharpe) (d. 29 April 1903) was an [[Ireland|Irish]] artist, etcher, and amateur photographer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gray, Elizabeth (-1903)|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/people/1487619?c=people|website=Trove - National Library of Australia|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Elizabeth Sharpe was born in Dublin to a distinguished family. Her brother was Richard Sharpe [[Royal Hibernian Academy|RHA]], inventor of the [[chromograph]]. Elizabeth was living in [[Sydney]] by early 1857. She married [[Charles Gray (artist)|Charles Gray]] on 19 March 1857 in [[Portland, Victoria]]. The couple lived at their property at Nareeb Nareeb, near Portland. They had at least three daughters, with the eldest Annie was born on 14 April 1858. Gray died on 29 April 1903.&lt;ref name=Fox&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fox|first1=Paul|title=Elizabeth Gray|url=https://www.daao.org.au/bio/elizabeth-gray/biography/?|website=Design and Art Australia Online|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic work==
Gray worked in watercolour and pen-and-ink, with some of her early work in Australia consists of two watercolours of ''Sydney Town and Harbour'', and ''Sydney Heads'' from 1857. Gray continued to work artistically after her marriage. Her work in pen and ink was on a variety of surfaces, including eggs. Her work ''View of Ferntree Gully'' from 19 February 1860 is on porcelain. She contributed five works to the fourth Annual Exhibition of Fine Arts in Melbourne in 1864. The pieces were four landscapes and one rural scene. Along with her husband, Gray exhibited at the 1866 Melbourne Intercolonial Exhibition, exhibited watercolours of Schnapper Point and Queenscliff, and two etchings called ''The Bluff'' and ''Beech Trees''. Her doilies or "etchings on linen, done with marking ink and a quill pen", won a medal.&lt;ref name=Fox /&gt;

Gray presented two vases made from black swan eggs, etched with "some sketches of natural history", to the [[Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Duke of Edinburgh]] in 1867 during his visit to Victoria. For these she received a royal commission, and they were displayed at the 1872 Exhibition at the South Kensington Museum. Prince Alfred requested that she make a second pair for [[Queen Victoria]], Gray made another pair mounted in silver. Two pen-and-ink drawings by Gray were displayed at the Victorian Intercolonial Exhibition preceding the 1873 London International, along with the vases. The pair of eggs belonging to the Prince were sold, with the Queen's are still held at [[Osborne House]], Isle of Wight. Another surviving example of Gray's work is an etched opaline panel showing a fern gully. She also appears to have exhibited photographs of Aborigines at the 1888 Melbourne Centennial International Exhibition.&lt;ref name=Fox /&gt;&lt;ref name=Butler&gt;{{cite book|last1=Butler|first1=Patricia|title=Irish Botanical Illustrators &amp; Flower Painters|date=2000|publisher=Antique Collectors' Club|location=Suffolk|isbn=9781851493579|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Figure/Ground''' is an open-source, para-academic, inter-disciplinary website which publishes in-depth interviews with scholars, researchers, and university professors, as well as artists, filmmakers, and creators of every stripe. Figure/Ground was a finalist in 2012 [[Canadian Online Publishing Awards]] and the 2013 [[Edublog Award]]s, and received the 2012 [[New Canadian Weblog Award]] (education category) as well as the 2013 [[John Culkin Award]] for outstanding praxis by the [[Media Ecology Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Awards|url=http://figureground.org/support-us/|website=Figure/Ground|accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Figure/Ground began as a personal blog founded by [[Laureano Ralón]] in 2009. It claims to contain one of the largest collections of scholarly interviews on the web, with numerous volunteer collaborators ranging from senior undergraduates to PhD candidates. 

==Mission==
According to the About page in the website: 

Figure/Ground sits on the edges of the academy and the art world; our aim is to bring the voices of academics and artists out of their specialized domains of practice and give them a venue for speaking frankly to the public at large.
Conversation is one of the most basic forms of human communication, yet the interview is a deeply undervalued genre within academic discourse. The majority of [[peer-reviewed journal]]s in the humanities and social sciences publish mostly essays and book reviews. In an age of digital interactive media, we believe the interview genre can serve as a powerful pedagogic tool and as a primary source for the production of new knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://figureground.org/about-fg/|website=Figure/Ground|accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early era===
Film-making in Louisiana began in 1898 with the [[Biograph Company|American Mutoscope and Biograph Company]].&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.louisianafilmmuseum.org/Louisiana_Filmography.html|title=Louisiana Filmography: 1898-1980|author=Louisiana Film Museum|accessdate=2012-02-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323140558/http://www.louisianafilmmuseum.org/Louisiana_Filmography.html|archive-date=2012-03-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It has been the site of several notable productions over the years, the first of which was ''[[Tarzan of the Apes (film)|Tarzan of the Apes]]'', completed in 1918. Other earlier film productions include ''[[Jezebel]]'', ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'', ''[[Easy Rider]]'', ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'', and ''[[The Big Easy (film)|The Big Easy]]''.&lt;ref name="fbtfilm"/&gt;

Louisiana has hosted a long list of major film and television stars over the years whose reputations and talents have likely played a role in the rise of state's film industry. Some of these actors and actresses include Bette Davis, Henry Fonda, Paul Newman, Marlon Brando, Denzel Washington, John Wayne, Clint Eastwood, Julia Roberts, Dennis Hopper, Cicely Tyson, Elvis Presley, Dennis Quaid, John Goodman, Jessica Lange, Richard Pryor, Jackie Gleason, James Spader, Dolly Parton, Susan Sarandon, Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Costner, Tom Cruise, Alec Baldwin, Yul Brenner, David Niven, Jimmy Stewart, James Mason, Brad Pitt, Charles Bronson, and Daryl Hannah.&lt;ref name="background"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.louisianafilmmuseum.org/|title=Background on the Museum|publisher=Louisiana Film Museum|accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern era===
In 2002, Louisiana passed unique{{citation-needed|date=June 2015}} tax incentives aimed at recruiting film and television productions to the state. By 2011, the state's skilled crew base had grown by over 400 percent, and since 2006 over 300 [[film]]s have been shot in Louisiana. The industry truly entered the national spotlight though when ''[[The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (film)|The Curious Case of Benjamin Button]]'' earned thirteen [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nominations, the most in 2009.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;

In 2010, boosted by its film industry, Louisiana made its first appearance in [[Site Selection (magazine)|Site Selection Magazine]]’s Top Business Climate rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fbtfilm.com/site-selection-2010.aspx|title=Film industry helps Louisiana earn Top 10 state ranking|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 Louisiana hosted more than 150 productions and about $1.3 billion of their combined $1.9 billion in budgets was spent in the state.&lt;ref name="2011record"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmneworleans.org/2012/uncategorized/louisiana-film-industry-passes-billion-dollar-mark-in-record-setting-2011/|title=Louisiana Film Industry Passes Billion-Dollar Mark In Record-Setting 2011|author=Mike Scott|accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tax incentives==
On July 1, 2002, the [[Louisiana Legislature]] enacted the Louisiana Motion Picture Tax Incentive Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://revenue.louisiana.gov/publications/lsleb(2002).pdf | title=2002 Legislative Sessions Department of Revenue Enrolled Bills | date=2002 | accessdate=August 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[tax credit]] has two primary components. First, the Investor Tax Credit provides a 30% tax credit on qualified motion picture expenditures with no project or program cap. Second, the Labor Tax Credit provides a 5% credit for [[payroll]] expenditures on Louisiana residents.&lt;ref name="louisianaeconomicdevelopment.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.louisianaeconomicdevelopment.com/opportunities/incentives--programs/motion-picture-tax-credit.aspx|title=Motion Picture Industry Development Tax Credit|publisher=LED|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123175417/http://www.louisianaeconomicdevelopment.com/opportunities/incentives--programs/motion-picture-tax-credit.aspx|archivedate=January 23, 2010|deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; This program not only encourages residents to film in Louisiana but also employ Louisiana residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fbtfilm.com/film_incentives.aspx|title=Louisiana Film Incentive &amp; Tax Credit Program Information|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To qualify for this program, [[filmmaker]]s must spend at least $300,000 in Louisiana.&lt;ref name="louisianaeconomicdevelopment.com"/&gt;

==Climate and scenery==
Louisiana's warm weather and diverse locations have appealed to film producers across the country considering that the [[subtropical climate]] makes filming possible year-round without interruptions.&lt;ref name="shreveport"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shreveportla.gov/pictures/pics.htm|title=Shreveport Film and Media Industry|author=Cedric B. Glover|accessdate=2012-02-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224103832/http://www.shreveportla.gov/pictures/pics.htm|archive-date=2012-02-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="locations"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.louisianaentertainment.gov/film/content.cfm?id=87|title=Locations|author=Louisiana FILM|accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spring and fall months are considered ideal filming time, with October being the driest month.&lt;ref name="weather"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.louisianaentertainment.gov/film/content.cfm?id=111|title=Weather Patterns|author=Louisiana FILM|accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of scenery, Louisiana offers [[swamp]]s and [[cypress]] trees, public and private college campuses, [[Antebellum architecture|antebellum plantations]], and urban environments. These diverse locations are often credited for Louisiana's ability to stand in as multiple settings such as [[Texas]], [[Colorado]], [[Utah]], [[Washington, DC]], and [[London]]. As [[Patrick Lussier]], director of [[Drive Angry]] 3D, commented in [[USA Today]], "The film industry wants to find places it can reinvent and make look like anything it needs. There's a lot of opportunity [to] do that in Louisiana."&lt;ref name="Lussier"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2010-08-03-louisianafilm03_CV_N.htm|title=Versatile Louisiana becomes 'L.A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8655">'''Fragmentarium''' (Digital Research Laboratory for Medieval Manuscript Fragments) is an online database to collect and collate fragments of [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[manuscripts]] making them available to researchers, collectors and historians worldwide. It is an international collaboration of major libraries and collections including the [[British Library]], [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], [[Martin Schøyen Collection]], [[Bavarian State Library]], [[Harvard]], [[Yale]] and the [[Vatican Library|Vatican]]. It is based in [[Switzerland]] and the project's current director is Professor Christoph Flüeler from the [[University of Fribourg]] and the Virtual Manuscript Library, Switzerland.&lt;ref name="nyt2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kahn|first1=Eve M.|title=Yale Buys Collection of Scattered Medieval Pages|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/04/arts/design/yale-buys-collection-of-scattered-medieval-pages.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Fragmentarium project was first proposed in October 2013 and the first planning meeting took place in [[Cologny]] in 2014. It was supported initially by representatives of 12 institutions, its goal being to study the field of manuscript fragment research and look at worldwide cataloguing standards. Fragmentarium was officially launched on 1 September 2017, by the Medieval Institute of the University of Fribourg at [[Abbey Library of St. Gall]] in [[St. Gallen]], Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fragmentarium Launched|url=http://www.fragmentarium.unifr.ch/about/news|website=Fragmentarium|accessdate=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Historians and librarians are now able to upload images to the Fragmentarium where they will be made available for research and encouraged to publish images under a [[Creative Commons]] [[public domain license]].&lt;ref name=bl2017&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dunning|first1=Andrew|title=Fragmentarium and the burnt Anglo-Saxon fragments|url=http://blogs.bl.uk/digitisedmanuscripts/2017/09/fragmentarium-and-the-burnt-anglo-saxon-fragments.html|website=British Library: Medieval Manuscripts|accessdate=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The library currently operates as a closed system and will open up public resources gradually from 2018.

==Method==
[[File:Three palimpsest fragments Or. 6581.jpg|thumb|Multispectral image of [[palimpsest]] fragments Or. 6581 with infrared (middle) and ultraviolet (right)]]
[[File:Composite images Or. 6581 palimpsest fragments.jpg|thumb|Enhanced multispectral imaging of palimpsest fragments composite images]]
Fragmentarium follows an established Swiss [[codex]] digitisation system known as e-codices and aims to promote cooperative research and discussion between researchers and scholars from multiple institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kahn|first1=Eve M.|title=Antiquarian Book Fair Offers Victorian Children’s Peep Shows|url=http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/about/history|website=The New York Times|accessdate=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As more fragments are uploaded it will be possible to reunite fragments which have become separated and compare analyses of similar manuscript pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Online-Plattform erleichtert die Erforschung alter Handschriften|url=http://www.freiburger-nachrichten.ch/nachrichten/online-plattform-erleichtert-die-erforschung-alter-handschriften|website=Freiburger Nachrichten|accessdate=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some fragments have been analysed using the [[Cornell Laboratory for Accelerator-based Sciences and Education#CHESS|Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS)]] to identify pigments, creating a unique "fingerprint" to enable it to be matched to corresponding fragments elsewhere in the world and potentially track their journey with “the potential to learn more about trade routes, historic mining sites, and the regional use of pigments and ingredients”.&lt;ref name="cc2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Aloi|first1=Daniel|title=Out of the blue: Medieval fragments yield surprises|url=http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2017/07/out-blue-medieval-fragments-yield-surprises|website=Cornell Chronicle|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other fragments have been identified as "recycled" into covers or bindings for later documents, a practice which was prevalent in the 15th to 17th century.&lt;ref name="srf2017"&gt;{{cite web|title=Recycling von Pergament Handschriften - Puzzle in der Stiftsbibliothek|url=https://www.srf.ch/news/regional/ostschweiz/handschriften-puzzle-in-der-stiftsbibliothek|website=Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen (SRF)|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system is also useful in documenting and digitally preserving partial manuscripts which have been damaged by neglect or fire as in the [[Cotton library#Ashburnham House fire|Cotton library fire]] of 1731,&lt;ref name=bl2017/&gt; or by deliberate destruction as occurred in the reformation in [[Scandinavia]].&lt;ref name=lz2017/&gt; In more recent times, in the 1950s and 1960s medieval manuscripts were frequently deliberately divided in order to attract a higher return on resale values and have subsequently become lost to researchers: Fragmentarium hopes to reunite them. Flüeler has estimated that around 90% of extant fragments are currently "lost" in archives.&lt;ref name=lz2017&gt;{{cite web|last1=Knellwolf|first1=Bruno|title=Schnipseljagd mit Big Data|url=http://www.luzernerzeitung.ch/nachrichten/panorama/schnipseljagd-mit-big-data;art9645,1094273|website=Luzerner Zeitung|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Samba Collection.JPG|thumb|Samba, a furniture created by [[Guto Requena]] with generative design.]]
'''Generative design''' is an [[Iteration|iterative]] [[design]] [[Process (engineering)|process]] that involves a [[Computer program|program]] that will [[Generator (mathematics)|generate]] a certain number of [[Output (computing)|outputs]] that meet certain [[Constraint (mathematics)|constraints]], and a [[designer]] that will fine tune the [[feasible region]] by changing [[Maxima and minima|minimal and maximal]] values of an [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] in which a [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]] of the program meets the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of constraints, in order to reduce or augment the number of outputs to [[Choice|choose]] from. The program doesn't need to be run on a [[machine]] like a [[digital computer]], it can be run by a human for example with [[pen and paper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.evaburger.at/portfolio/generative-design-with-analogue-techniques/|title=generative design with analogue techniques – eva designs|website=www.evaburger.at|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The designer doesn't need to be a [[human]], it can be a [[Test (assessment)|test]] program in a testing environment or an [[artificial intelligence]] (see for example [[Generative adversarial network|Generative adversarial networks]]). The designer [[Learning|learns]] to [[Refinement (computing)|refine]] the program (usually involving [[Algorithm|algorithms]]) with each iteration as his design [[Goal|goals]] become better [[Definition|defined]] over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cimdata.com/en/news/item/8402-generative-design-what-s-that|title=“Generative Design” – What’s That? - CIMdata|last=Meintjes|first=Keith|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.autodesk.com/solutions/generative-design|title=What is Generative Design {{!}} Tools &amp; Software {{!}} Autodesk|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-generative-design-anthony-hauck|title=What is Generative Design?|date=2018-04-09|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://designbyming.com/relational-design-thinking/|title=Relational Design Thinking — Design by Ming|website=designbyming.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The output could be [[Image|images]], [[Sound|sounds]], [[Architectural model|architectural models]], [[animation]], and much more. It is therefore a fast method of exploring design possibilities that is used in various design fields such as [[art]], [[architecture]], [[Communication Design|communication design]], and [[Product Design|product design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.engineering.com/DesignSoftware/DesignSoftwareArticles/ArticleID/16973/Generative-Design-The-Road-to-Production.aspx|title=Generative Design: The Road to Production|last=ENGINEERING.com|website=www.engineering.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process combined with the [[Computing power|power]] of digital computers that can explore a very large number of possible [[Permutation|permutations]] of a solution enables designers to generate and test brand new options, beyond what a human alone could accomplish, to arrive at a most effective and optimized design. It [[Biomimetics|mimics nature]]’s [[evolutionary]] approach to design through [[genetic variation]] and [[Selection (biology)|selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autodesk.com/customer-stories/airbus|title=Definition adapted from a product developed by Autodesk named Generative Design|website=Autodesk|accessdate=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generative design is becoming more important, largely due to new programming environments or scripting capabilities that have made it relatively easy, even for designers with little programming experience, to implement their ideas. Additionally, this process can create solutions to substantially complex problems that would otherwise be resource-exhaustive with an alternative approach making it a more attractive option for problems with a large or unknown solution set.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1003551283|title=Compositional model-based design: A generative approach to the conceptual design of physical systems|last=Prasanta|first=Rajamoney, Shankar A.

Not only are implementation tools becoming more accessible but also tools leveraging generative design as a foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Fraser|last2=Grossman|first2=Tovi|last3=Fitzmaurice|first3=George|date=2017-10-20|title=Trigger-Action-Circuits: Leveraging Generative Design to Enable Novices to Design and Build Circuitry|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3126594.3126637|publisher=ACM|pages=331–342|doi=10.1145/3126594.3126637|isbn=9781450349819}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hap and Leonard''' are two fictional amateur investigators and adventurers portrayed by American author [[Joe R.

They are two very different men and the best of friends, and now work together as private investigators for Hap's girlfriend Brett Sawyer. Together they always wind up in a lot of trouble with various criminal types in the fictional town of LaBorde, in [[East Texas]] and often find themselves attempting to solve various unpleasant and brutal crimes. Both men are well versed in the [[martial arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thrillingdetective.com/hap.html|title=Hap Collins &amp; Leonard Pine|last=Smith|first=Kevin Burton|date=2017|website=www.thrillingdetective.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822102400/http://www.thrillingdetective.com/hap.html|archive-date=2016-08-22|dead-url=no|access-date=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/series/50105-hap-collins-and-leonard-pine|title=Hap and Leonard series by Joe R.

==Hap Collins==
Hap Collins is a white working class laborer who spent time in federal prison as a young man for refusing to be drafted into the military and serve in the [[Vietnam War]]. In his late forties, he is often haunted by the various unpleasant jobs he's held over the years such as working at an aluminum chair factory and working the East Texas rose fields. Hap tries his best to avoid violence and also tries his best to avoid the taking of another human life. Often lovesick, most of his relationships haven't worked out. He is currently with his on-again-off-again girlfriend Brett Sawyer. Some of his past has been taken from Mr. Lansdale's own past. The stories are told from Hap's narrative point of view. Not as quick to anger as Leonard, he often finds himself attempting to talk Leonard out of committing serious violence.

==Leonard Pine==
Leonard Pine is a gay, black [[Vietnam vet]] with serious anger issues. He was raised by his uncle who shunned him after learning he was gay. However, when his uncle passes away, he leaves his house and all his assets to Leonard. Leonard has zero tolerance for racist or [[Homophobia|anti-gay]] slurs. Although Hap dislikes guns, Leonard has no problem carrying or using them. Quick to anger, at times he cannot understand Hap's aversion to violence or killing if necessary, even when provoked. His relationships are also short and tempestuous. Leonard is the much more aggressive of the two and repeatedly burned down a local [[crack house]] that used to be his new next door neighbor. After living with Hap and Brett for a while, he recently moved into his own place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/johnny-shaw/the-descendants-of-holmes_b_5499245.html|title=The Descendants of Holmes and Watson: 11 Literary Partners-in-Crime|first=Johnny|date=|website=|publisher=Huffington Post|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150827203634/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/johnny-shaw/the-descendants-of-holmes_b_5499245.html|archive-date=2015-08-27|dead-url=no|last1=Shaw|accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much to Hap's dismay, Leonard has a habit of wearing ugly hats.

'''Iversity''' is a Berlin-based online education platform.

== History ==
* Initial idea and development of a beta-version of the platform in 2008 by founder Jonas Liepmann.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/american-mooc-providers-face-international-competition/44637, Grossman, Sara in The Chronicle of Higher Education: “American MOOC Providers Face International Competition”], 5 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
* This startup is said to have begun in 2011 and offered online collaboration tools for [[Learning Management|learning management]] with Hannes Klöpper as the co-founder and the second managing director.&lt;ref name="Lomas"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/09/online-learning-platform-iversity-gets-a-lifeline-from-holtzbrinck-media-group/|title=Online learning platform iversity gets a lifeline from Holtzbrinck media group|last=Lomas|first=Natasha|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2017-10-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* in 2012 iversity decided to become a European-based MOOC platform&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wiredacademic.com/2013/07/5-questions-with-an-edtech-startup-hannes-klopper-of-berlin-based-mooc-provider-iversity/, Wired Academic: "5 Questions With An EdTech Startup: Hannes Klöpper of Berlin-based MOOC provider ‘iversity"], 4 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Spring 2013 – iversity and the [[Stifterverband für die Deutsche Wissenschaft]] launched “The MOOC Production Fellowship” as a competition for online course concepts. A jury chose 10 of the best MOOC concepts out of more than 250 entries. The winners were each awarded €25,000 for the production of their courses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://venturevillage.eu/iversity-raises-funding, Fowler, Nina in Venture Village: “Online education platform iversity raises funding from T-Venture and new CEO”], 16 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://iversity.org/en/pages/advisory-board, iversity: “Press Release: iversity creates Advisory Board”], 18 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://netzwertig.com/2014/01/29/zwei-jahre-spaeter-15-heise-startups-aus-berlin-und-was-aus-ihnen-geworden-ist/, Weigert, Martin in Netzwertig: “Zwei Jahre später - heiße Startups aus Berlin und was aus ihnen geworden ist”], 29 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In October 2013 iversity relaunched as a platform for online courses, initially with 10 courses and 115,000 registered users.&lt;ref&gt;[http://venturevillage.eu/iversity-stifterverband-mooc-fellowship, Fowler, Nina in Venture Village: "Professors, want to teach online?

* In January 2014 online learners were able to take the first paid final, on-site exams, through which iversity earned its first revenues.
* In October 2014, exactly one year since the relaunch, iversity's total funding reached over €5 million.&lt;ref&gt;[https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/19/iversity-500k-sign-ups/, Lomas, Natasha in Tech Crunch: “European Online Education Startup, iversity, Gets ~500k Course Sign-Ups In First 4-Months”], 19 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edukwest.eu/hedline-iversity-nears-500-000-enrollments/, Alexander, Kay in Edukwest: “iversity Nears 500.000 Enrollments”], 20 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In August 2016, iversity secured a new investment from Holtzbrinck Digital,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gruenderszene.de/allgemein/holtzbrinck-digital-insolvenz-iversity|title=Holtzbrinck Digital investiert in strauchelndes Iversity|work=Gründerszene Magazin|access-date=2017-10-06|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lomas"/&gt; after filing for insolvency in July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gruenderszene.de/allgemein/iversity-insolvenz|title=Iversity hat Insolvenz angemeldet – und will klein weitermachen|work=Gründerszene Magazin|access-date=2017-10-06|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Courses ==

[[Massive Open Online Course]]s (MOOCs) harness visual elements (lecture videos, animations, graphics), interactive elements (simulations) and written materials (scientific articles).&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/blogs/conversation/2013/07/08/moocs-and-economic-reality/, Shirky, Clay in The Chronicle of Higher Education:  "MOOCs and Economic Reality"], 8 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bohle"&gt;[http://www.scilogs.com/scientific_and_medical_libraries/librarians-and-the-era-of-the-mooc/, Bohle, Shannon in SciLogs: “Librarians and the Era of the MOOC”], 11 Mai 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsok.com/first-massive-open-online-course-at-university-of-oklahoma-to-feature-graphic-novel/article/3759503?custom_click=lead_story_title, Price, Matthew in The Oklahoman: "First massive open online course at University of Oklahoma to feature graphic novel"], 1 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/article/Dont-Call-Them-Textbooks/136835/, Young, Jeffrey R. in The Chronicle of Higher Education: "The Object Formerly Known as the Textbook"], 27 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; All elements can be reviewed at any time. Instructor and course participants can interact with each other in discussion forums.&lt;ref&gt;[https://iversity.org/blog/user-interaction-learning-iversity-looks-like-iii/, iversity: “User Interaction: What learning at iversity looks like”], 13 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Instructors can use quizzes to get feedback on the learning progress of the course participants.&lt;ref&gt;[https://iversity.org/blog/learning-iversity-looks-like-breaking-90-minute-lecture/, iversity: "What learning at iversity looks like: Breaking down the 90 minute lecture"], 26 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Most iversity courses end with a final assessment or exam. Exams can be taken on-site, online as “[[proctor]]ed-exam” or in form of a final project that has to be handed in to the instructor.

Students at iversity.org can choose between different study paths, resulting in different certificates. “Statement of Participation” is free-of-charge, other certificates come with varying costs – depending on which level of certification the student chooses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailyfinance.com/2014/04/16/mooc-great-college-classes-free/, Kraft-Linder, Annalisa in Daily Finance: “MOOCs: What’s A Great College Class Worth When It’s Free?”], 16 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edcetera.rafter.com/verified-certificates-moocs-money-maker-or-anachronism/, Winkler, Kirsten in Edcetera: “Verified Certificates – MOOC’s Money Maker or Anachronism?”], 24 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Universities that offer a course at iversity have the option of offering European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System ([[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]]) credits. This track allows students to receive credits from their course and apply them to their university studies. ECTS Credits can be used at any European Higher Education Institution. A certificate that awards ECTS credits is issued once the participant has passed an on-site or online proctored exam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-magazin.net/2014/03/virtuell-lernen-mit-moocs-das-prinzip-und-die-vorteile-von-massive-open-online-courses-37321.html, Strobel, Marisa in M-Magazin: “Virtuell lernen mit MOOCs”], 5 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://iversity.org/en/pages/enrolments-revenue, iversity: “Online Education Platform iversity.org On The Road To Success”], 19 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Enrolment to courses is free, costs only apply when purchasing certificates.

For the production of courses, iversity collaborates with European universities and individual professors. Lecturers design their own MOOCs with technical support from iversity. 
iversity cooperates with institutions such as 
* [[Libera Università Internazionale degli Studi Sociali Guido Carli]] (LUISS)
* [[RWTH Aachen]]
* [[University of Buckingham]]
* [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP)
* [[Hertie School of Governance]]
* [[European University Institute]]
* [[University of Tubingen]]
* [[University of Mainz]]
* [[Reutlingen University]] (''Hochschule Reutlingen'' in German)

== Business Model ==
iversity earns revenue through the sale of certificates, which online learners receive after successfully completing courses on iversity.org thereby catering to all types of learners, among them working professionals who need to document their learning achievements and university students.&lt;ref name="bohle" /&gt; Some courses at iversity can be integrated into the student's [[diploma]] through the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS).
iversity has raised more than €5 million in [[venture capital]]. The investors are T-Venture, bmp media investors, BFB Frühphasenfonds, Masoud Kamali, Westtech Ventures, CRALS, Peter Zühlsdorf and Kontor B45.
The iversity Advisory board consists of Dr. Jörg Dräger and Prof. Édouard Husson.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1822">'''Jenő Bory''' ([[Székesfehérvár]], November 9, 1879 – Székesfehérvár, December 20, 1959) was a Hungarian architect and sculptor.

[[Image:Kaposvár Bory Szent István-kút.jpg|thumb|right|St Stephen's well in Kaposvar, part of Our Lady Church]]

Bory received his degree in building engineering in Budapest in 1903. He enrolled in the Academy of Fine Arts to study sculpture under [[Alajos Strobl]]. At this time he met his wife, Ilona Komocsin (1885-1974), who became a notable painter after finishing her studies in [[Szeged]]. During [[World War I]] as a soldier he was appointed as an official war artist in [[Sarajevo]] for which he received the Order of Franz Josef. He taught at the Academy of Fine Arts (1911–46) and at the Technical University (1921–44). He was rector of the Academy between 1943 and 1945.

He was largely responsible for the building of the so-called ''Bory castle'' in Székesfehérvár which is decorated by his and his wife's works. He built this fantastic, castle-like structure out of concrete with his own hands for 41 years.

==Koestler's prison experience==

Koestler had been detained in three jails in separate countries.

==Creation of the Koestler Trust==
His experiences in prison led him to write ''[[Darkness at Noon]]'' and newspaper articles campaigning for the abolition of capital punishment in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; He also attempted to change the experience of incarceration, stating  that in prison, "the main problem is apathy, depression and gradual [[dehumanisation]]. The spark dies."&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite news|last=Chesshyre|first=Robert|title=The Fine Art of Starting Over|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2006/sep/17/art|accessdate=9 March 2013|newspaper=The Observer|date=16 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koestler spoke of being intellectually under-stimulated&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; and terrorized in prison,&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; and wanted to provide "an imaginative and exciting way to stimulate as far as possible and in as many cases as possible the mind and spirit of the prisoner."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In 1962, Koestler arranged the Arthur Koestler Award (now Koestler Trust) through the [[Home Office]] of the United Kingdom, to award monetary prizes for artistic achievement to prisoners, detainees, and psychiatric patients.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

==The Koestler Trust Today==
Today the Koestler Awards cover over 61 artforms, across music, writing, crafts, design, performance and fine art. Each category is judged by panels of experts, including Grayson Perry, Jeremy Deller, V&amp;A, National Theatre, Speech Debelle and Hot Chip (2014 UK Awards). An annual exhibition programme is curated separately and held at Southbank Centre. Recent curators of the UK exhibition include Grayson Perry, Sarah Lucas, Speech Debelle, Victims of Crime, Magistrates, women prisoners and ex-prisoners. The charity also holds locally-focused exhibitions - recent shows include Snail Porridge at Castlefield Gallery in Manchester (2014) curated by Bob and Roberta Smith,  and Release at Glasgow's Tramway, curated by Kibble Secure Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koestlertrust.org.uk/pages/awards.html|title=Koestler Trust Awards|work=koestlertrust.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Trust also runs mentoring programmes for people who wish to continue in the arts after release from prison or other secure settings.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.koestlertrust.org.uk/pages/exhibitions.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107135901/http://www.koestlertrust.org.uk/pages/exhibitions.html |archivedate=2014-11-07 |df= }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Artforms|url=http://www.koestlertrust.org.uk/pages/awardsartform.html|work=Koestler Trust|accessdate=9 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prizes were initially paid by Koestler himself, but the award was reorganized into a charitable trust in 1969, as more sources of funding became necessary.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Today, artwork by the prisoners and others is available for sale direct to the public through the trust's exhibitions. Artists receive 50% of proceeds, 25% goes to Victim Support and 25% to the Trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koestlertrust.org.uk/pages/buyart.html|title=Koestler Trust Art for sale|work=koestlertrust.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art Sales|url=http://www.koestlertrust.org.uk/pages/buyart.html|work=Koestler Trust|accessdate=9 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ArrestOfOrchid01R.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|A Lianhuanhua Image from ''"Arrest of the Orchid"'']]
'''''Lianhuanhua''''' ([[Chinese character|Chinese]]: 连环画 ([[Simplified Chinese|Simplified]]) 連環畫 ([[Traditional Chinese|Traditional]]); [[Pinyin]]: ''Liánhuánhuà'' or 連環圖) is a [[Hand|palm-size]] picture book of sequential drawings found in [[China]] in the early 20th century.

There is a Chinese belief that ''lianhuanhua''  influenced Japanese [[manga]] in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Wendy"&gt;Wong, Wendy Siuyi. [2002] (2001) Hong Kong Comics: A History of Manhua. Princeton Architectural Press. New York. {{ISBN|1-56898-269-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
The name in Chinese essentially translates to "linked pictures" or "serial pictures". The books were called ''"lianhuanhua"'' or ''"lianhuan tuhua"''; later the "tu" was omitted and the term ''"lianhuanhua"'' became standard.&lt;ref name="Lent"&gt;Lent, John A. [2001] (2001) Illustrating Asia: Comics, Humor Magazines, and Picture Books. University of Hawaii Press. {{ISBN|0-8248-2471-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The official term lianhuanhua was not used until 1927.  Prior to this, lianhuanhua were separated into different name categories depending on the region.&lt;ref name="Lent" /&gt;

==History==
In the 1880s, Chinese magazines such as Dianshizhai Pictorial experimented with the potential of this art technique. In 1884, ten illustrations to accompany a [[Korea]]n rebellion narrative may be the earliest example of Lianhuanhua. In 1899, Wenyi Book Company in [[Shanghai]] published the illustrated [[lithograph]] ''"The Story of the Three Kingdoms"'' drawn by Zhu Zhixuan. The format then was called ''"huihui tu"'' or chapter pictures.&lt;ref name="Lent" /&gt;

In 1916 [[Caobao Road (Shanghai Metro)|Caobao]] newspapers bound the pictures to attract a larger audience base of middle and lower class readers. The rise of Lianhuanhua's popularity was proportional to the rise of [[lithographic]] printing introduced to Shanghai from the West.&lt;ref name="Lent" /&gt; [[Shanghai]] comics journals in the 1920s featured more artwork, typically depicting traditional stories along the lines of [[Chinese mythology]] or [[Chinese folklore]].  Small publishers in the 1920s and 1930s were mostly located on a street called Beigongyili in the [[Zhabei]] district.  In 1935 street book stall owners and publishers established the "Shanghai Lianhuan Tuhua Promotion Society" at [[Taoyuanli]].&lt;ref name="Lent" /&gt;  The illustrated stories were originally targeted to children and marginally literate readers.&lt;ref name="Wendy" /&gt;

The books could be rented for a small fee in street [[kiosk]]s. By the 1920s, lianhuanhua were also found in [[Hong Kong]]. These rental stores were common even during the [[Japanese occupation of Hong Kong|Japanese occupation]] periods in the 1940s.&lt;ref name="Wendy" /&gt;

In Hong Kong during the 1970s, the format had essentially disappeared as they had become materials associated with the uneducated and unsophisticated.&lt;ref name="Wendy" /&gt;

Though lianhuanhua production decreased in mainland China during [[Cultural Revolution]], many books were still produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lianhuanhua 连环画 - Picture Storybook|url=http://digicoll.manoa.hawaii.edu/storybook/index.php?c=1|website=University of Hawaii Digital Collection|accessdate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the late 1970s to the early 1980s, lianhuanhua made a major comeback. As in previous eras of lianhuanhua production, many of the books were adaptations of other films or television shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stember|first1=Nick|title=Chinese Lianhuanhua: A Century of Pirated Movies|url=http://www.nickstember.com/chinese-lianhuanhua-century-of-pirated-movies/|accessdate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During and after the Cultural Revolution, the communist party adopted the medium for [[propaganda]] and education purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Propaganda and ideology in everyday life: Chinese comic books - Asian and African studies blog|url=http://blogs.bl.uk/asian-and-african/2015/05/propaganda-and-ideology-in-everyday-life-chinese-comic-books.html|website=blogs.bl.uk|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the late 1980s to the 1990s, demand for lianhuanhua decreased dramatically, and today, comic books such as [[manhua]] and translations of Japanese [[manga]] are much more popular than lianhuanhua.&lt;ref&gt;China.org.cn. "[http://china.org.cn/english/LI-e/26574.htm]." ''Allure of illustrated booklets.'' Retrieved on 2011-12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not long ago, Renmin Meishu Chubanshe (People's Fine Arts Publishing House), Shanghai Renmin Meishu Chubanshe (Shanghai People's Fine Arts Publishing House) and Tianjin People's Renmin Meishu Chubanshe (Tianjin People's Fine Arts Publishing House) have republished some of their popular Lianhuanhua books.

==Present==
Currently there is a resurgent interest in this format. The [[Shanghai Museum of Art]] has inaugurated a permanent exhibition of Lianhuanhua as a popular [[grassroots]] [[fine art]] form.

This is a '''list of video games considered to be works of art'''. Although several countries offer legal protections to all video games that are similar or identical to protections offered to other artistic works, and although by this standard all [[Video games as an art form|video games can be considered as art]], this article lists games that are specifically identified by art critics and video game reviewers as works of art.

==20th century==

&lt;!-- Only include games that have been described by reliable sources to be works of art, and provide a reference for the source. --&gt;
*''[[Tempest (video game)|Tempest]]'' (1981) – an arcade [[tube shooter]] with [[vector monitor|vector graphics]] by [[Atari Inc]]. [[PBS]] Idea Channel described it as a strongly aesthetic experience, comparing it to paintings.&lt;ref name="ideachannel"/&gt;
*''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' (1985 [[NES]]) – a side-scrolling platform game released as a launch title for the NES and became the most praised game in the original Mario series for its 8-bit visuals, power-ups and charm. The game has its own spot in the Smithsonian museum in an exhibition called the Art of Video Games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://americanart.si.edu/exhibitions/archive/2012/games/featuredgames/]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1970">"'''Little Expressionless Animals'''" is a 1988 short story by [[David Foster Wallace]]. It was first published in ''[[The Paris Review]]'', and reprinted in his short story collection ''[[Girl with Curious Hair]]''. The ''[[Village Voice]]'' described it as "riveting".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/2000-08-22/news/trivial-necessities/ ''Trivial Necessities: How to Win Friends and Influence People''], Hillary Chute, [[Village Voice]], August 22 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The main narrative of the story is told in a cut-up style, with events taking place in a nonlinear fashion to increase dramatic tension.

==Plot==
Julie Smith is a contestant on ''[[Jeopardy!]]'', an American television game show, in the 1980s. After her fourth win, the show's producers decide that she is popular enough that they will not limit her to five appearances (as was the practice at the time). As a result, Julie wins every ''Jeopardy!'' game for three years, and uses her winnings to pay for the care of her [[autistic]] brother. 

As Julie consistently wins every ''Jeopardy!'' match, studio executive [[Merv Griffin]] decides to increase the tension within the show by secretly convincing Julie's brother to compete against her, and rigs the game in his favor by selecting only questions that relate to animals — the only category with which Julie struggles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6123">The '''Lynn Painter-Stainers Prize''' is an annual art award, intended to encourage creative representational painting and draughtsmanship. It gives out prizes totalling £25,000.&lt;ref name="AN ruth stage"&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=http://new.a-n.co.uk/news/single/lynn-painter-stainers-prize-2013-winners-announced |work=a-n.co.uk |title=Lynn Painter-Stainers Prize 2013 winners announced  |date=19 February 2013 |accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prize originated in [[London]] in 2005,&lt;ref name="BBC 2012 fan"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-17528781 |work=BBC News |title=Lynn Painter-Stainers Prize won by electric fan work |publisher= |date=28 March 2012 |accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a collaboration between the [[Worshipful Company of Painter-Stainers]] and the Lynn Foundation.

==Winners==
''[[The Independent]]'' reviewed the 2009 exhibition favourably, saying "The means are relatively traditional – oil on board, oil on canvas, acrylic on canvas, etc. The range is, at first glance, familiar: landscape, ruminative portraiture, still life... What we look for in any show such as this one is the way in which the painter has engaged with his or her subject, the particular angle of attack... This does not necessarily mean being wildly experimental so that the world as we know it disappears altogether. There is none of that here. And yet abstraction does play a part, and often quite a subtle one."&lt;ref name="Indy 2009"&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Michael Glover (author)|Michael Glover]] |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/reviews/lynn-painterstainers-prize-exhibition-painters-hall-london-1821719.html |work=The Independent |title=Lynn Painter-Stainers Prize Exhibition, Painters' Hall, London |publisher= |date=17 November 2009 |accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Selector Steve Pill, shared his thoughts on the selection of the exhibition: "I was keen to try and view each work from the perspective of a wider audience. The two stated aims of the Lynn Painter-Stainers Prize are to encourage creative representational painting and promote the skill of draughtsmanship, so I often asked myself: would we be fulfilling that promise by including this work? Would a visitor expecting these qualities be truly satisfied by every painting we chose? I hope you’ll agree that we have stayed true to those principles and selected a collection of work that really celebrates the vitality, diversity and skill of contemporary representational painting in the UK today."

The 2012 prize was won by Anthony Williams for a [[still life]] painting of an [[electric fan]]. 98 paintings were selected for the final exhibition.&lt;ref name="BBC 2012 fan" /&gt;

In 2013 the prize winner was artist [[Ruth Stage]], for her [[tempera]] painting ''The Isabella Plantation''. Stage received £15,000 and a gold medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-21499549 |work=BBC News |title=Egg artist wins £15,000 art prize |publisher= |date=18 February 2013 |accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were five judges; artist [[Nina Murdoch (artist)|Nina Murdoch]], former winner [[Antony Williams (artist)|Antony Williams]], art critic Andrew Lambirth and Tate fellow Andrew Wilton who picked the winners from 72 finalists.&lt;ref name="Indy lynn painter"&gt;{{cite news|author=Daisy Wyatt |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/ruth-stage-wins-lynn-painterstainers-prize-for-figurative-art-8500739.html |work=[[The Independent]] |title=Ruth Stage wins Lynn Painter-Stainers prize for figurative art |publisher= |date=19 February 2013 |accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A young artist prize was also awarded (worth £2,500) and there were five runners-up spots.&lt;ref name="Indy lynn painter" /&gt;

The 2014 prize was won by Edinburgh-based artist [[Catharine Davison]] for her 'mesmerising' en plain air painting [[Craggs at Dawn (Calton Hill)]].

'''Mapuche silverwork''' is one of the best known aspects of [[Mapuche]] material culture.&lt;ref name=Painecura15&gt;Painecura 2011, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The adornments have been subject to changes in fashion but some designs have resisted change.

==History==
In the later half of the 18th century, Mapuche [[silversmith]]s began to produce large amounts of silver finery.&lt;ref name=Aldunate&gt;{{cite journal |last=Aldunate |first=Carlos |last2= |first2= |year=1984 |title=Reflexiones acerca de la platería mapuche |url=http://repositoriodigital.uct.cl:8080/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/329/CUHSO_0716-1557_03_1984_1_art1.pdf?sequence=1 |journal=Cultura-Hombre-Sociedad |publisher= |volume=1 |issue= |pages= |doi= |accessdate=13 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203065926/http://repositoriodigital.uct.cl:8080/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/329/CUHSO_0716-1557_03_1984_1_art1.pdf?sequence=1 |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The surge of silversmithing activity may be related to the [[Parliament of Quillín (1641)|1641 parliament of Quillín]] and the [[1726 parliament of Negrete]] that decreased hostilities between Spaniards and Mapuches and allowed trade to increase between [[colonial Chile]] and the free Mapuches.&lt;ref name=Aldunate/&gt;&lt;ref name=Painecura25-26/&gt; In this context of increasing trade, Mapuches began in the late 18th century to accept payments in [[silver coin]]s for their products; usually cattle or horses.&lt;ref name=Aldunate/&gt; These coins and silver coins obtained in political negotiations served as raw material for Mapuche metalsmiths ([[Mapudungun]]: ''rüxafe'').&lt;ref name=Aldunate/&gt;&lt;ref name=Painecura25-26/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kangiser/&gt; Old Mapuche silver [[pendant]]s often included unmelted silver coins, something that has helped modern researchers to date the objects.&lt;ref name=Kangiser&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kangiser Gómez |first=María Fernanda |last2= |first2= |year=2002 |title=Conservación en platería mapuche: Museo Fonck, Viña del Mar |url=http://www.museodevalparaiso.cl/dinamicas/DocAdjunto_27.pdf |journal=Conserva |publisher= |volume=6 |issue= |pages= |doi= |accessdate=13 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202234953/http://www.museodevalparaiso.cl/dinamicas/DocAdjunto_27.pdf |archivedate=2 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bulk of the Spanish silver coins originated from mining in [[Potosí]] in [[Upper Peru]].&lt;ref name=Painecura25-26&gt;Painecura 2011, pp. 25-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The great diversity in silver finery designs is indebted to the fact that designs were done to be identified with different ''reynma'' (families), ''lof mapu'' (lands) as well as specific [[lonko]]s and [[machi (shaman)|machi]]s.&lt;ref name=Painecura27-28&gt;Painecura 2011, pp. 27-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Mapuche silver finery was also subject to changes in [[fashion]] albeit designs associated with philosophical and spiritual concepts have not undergone major changes.&lt;ref name=Painecura27-28/&gt;

In late 18th century and early 19th century, Mapuche silversmithing activity and artistic diversity reached it climax.&lt;ref name=Painecura30&gt;Painecura 2011, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; All important Mapuche chiefs of the 19th century are supposed to have had at least one silversmith.&lt;ref name=Aldunate/&gt; The [[Occupation of Araucanía|1869 war between Chile and independent Mapuches]] provoked a famine among Mapuches in the winter of 1869, with the situation being worsened by a [[smallpox]] epidemic.&lt;ref name=Bengoa224&gt;Bengoa 2000, p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; This situation led some Mapuches to sell their silver adornments in the towns of [[La Frontera, Chile|La Frontera]] to obtain food.&lt;ref name=Bengoa224/&gt;

As of 1984, Mapuche scholar Carlos Aldunate noted that there were no silversmiths alive among contemporary Mapuches.&lt;ref name=Aldunate/&gt;

==Appearance==
Although these adornments showed some variation in form, the principal one appears to be a set of three separate columns of flattened silver links joined to each other by square alternating links.  At the top of the set of columns, and holding them together, is a flat two-headed bird figure and at the base is a flat semicircle or trapezoid that usually has a series of small disks dangling from its base.  The wearer would place the object hanging from his/ her neck and down the chest.

'''Michael Casimir "Mike" Stivic''' is a fictional character on the 1970s American television [[sitcom]] ''[[All in the Family]]''.  He was the live-in son-in-law of the series' lead character, [[Archie Bunker]], who frequently called him '''"Meathead"'''.  Michael was the husband of Archie's daughter [[Gloria Stivic|Gloria]] (played by [[Sally Struthers]]).  [[Rob Reiner]] played the role of Michael Stivic throughout the series.

== Character overview ==

The character of Michael Stivic is an Americanized version of the British original: ''[[Till Death Us Do Part]]'''s Mike Rawlins, the [[Trotskyist]] "Randy [[Scouse]] Git" who arouses the passionate ire of his [[arch-conservative]] father-in-law [[Alf Garnett]]. For the American version of this character, the Trotskyist angle was drastically softened: Michael Stivic is a [[Liberalism|social liberal]] and a [[Left-wing politics|leftist]], but not an adherent of any form of communism and is presented as possibly a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] who is sympathetic to the [[Students for a Democratic Society]] movement (SDS), which is hinted by his occasional use of SDS ally and [[Yippie]] leader [[Abbie Hoffman]]'s [[guerrilla theatre]] antics.

Michael Stivic is a [[Polish-American]] from [[Chicago]]. He was orphaned at a young age, with his parents having been killed in a car crash. He was raised by his uncle Casimir Stivic, an ex-Marine lieutenant turned florist, who calls him "Mickey" with great affection.  He also had an uncle Alex.

When ''All in the Family'' begins, Michael is married to Gloria and shares a bedroom with her in the home of her parents, whom he addresses as "Ma" and "Archie" (or "Arch"), while focusing his efforts on earning a college degree in [[sociology]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/ptop/plain/A1076780&lt;/ref&gt;  His first meeting with Archie (seen in a [[flashback (continuity)|flashback]]) shows him as a bearded [[hippie]] with a [[tie-dye]]d shirt. His wardrobe throughout most of the series is much more subdued: most often he wears a denim shirt, jeans, and boots. He shaves his beard for his wedding with Gloria, but keeps his mustache afterwards (on rare occasions later in the series, however, he would go for a clean-shaven look) and wears his hair well below the collar. (As Reiner's hairline was receding very rapidly early on in the series, he began wearing a toupee when playing the character.) In season 2, episode 5, "Flashback: Mike Meets Archie" (mentioned above), which first aired October 16, 1971, Mike and Gloria celebrate their first wedding anniversary. A 1972 episode centers on Mike and Gloria's second wedding anniversary, while in the 1978 episode ''The Stivics Go West'' it is revealed that Mike and Gloria are coming upon the ninth anniversary.

Exacerbating the conflicts between college student Michael and his [[conservative]] father-in-law [[Archie Bunker]], is the fact that in the early years of the television series, these two characters live under the same roof. This proximity means that the tensions between these seemingly diametrically opposed people result in endless arguments over the simplest of topics, even the proper order in which to put on socks and shoes.  Along with other issues, such as Michael's frequent decision to sit in Archie's coveted chair and huge appetite for food purchased by Archie's working-class income, their huge ideological differences greatly contributed to the conflict between the two characters.&lt;ref name=uoooooav /&gt;  Michael is a determined [[agnostic]]-though he would at times identify himself as an atheist in order to rile up Archie, who assumed he was in complete disbelief of God-,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJIUrjBs4tA&amp;t=1m42s|title=Real Time With Bill Maher: Overtime - Episode #233|first=|last=Real Time with Bill Maher|date=January 18, 2012|publisher=|access-date=October 5, 2017|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to his mother-in-law's quiet Christian church attendance and his non-practicing but nonetheless staunchly Christian father-in-law.  He also is a dedicated humanitarian who wishes to help change the world:&lt;ref name=uoooooav /&gt; originally, Michael wanted to become a social worker, but his career aspirations shifted towards teaching as the series progressed.&lt;ref name=uoooooav /&gt;  When the neighboring Jefferson family moves out of the neighborhood, the family patriarch George allows Michael to rent his old house so Michael and Gloria can have a home of their own. George, however, is still the house's legal owner. Although being next door still results in frequent visits, the tension between Michael and Archie eases as they now live under different roofs.

Despite his frequent conflicts with his father-in-law, Mike enjoys a warm relationship with his mother-in-law, Edith, whom he calls "Ma". Edith frequently intervenes to try to defuse tensions between her husband and son-in-law, though she also occasionally takes Mike to task for initiating unnecessary arguments with Archie, and, in 1973 episode "Games Bunkers Play", offers insight to Mike into Archie's attitude toward him, suggesting that Archie had to drop out of high school to help support his family during the Depression, and that he resents the fact that Mike had the chance to attend college and advance his education.

Michael is presented as a representative of the [[counterculture of the 1960s]] (reflecting current events during the period in which the show was broadcast).  There is no suggestion, however of the drug use or "[[free love]]" of that subculture and Michael is a dedicated [[academic]]. It is revealed in the season eight episode ''Gloria and Mike Meet'' that in 1969, Michael's dedication to humanitarianism was galvanized in order to weaken support for newly elected President Richard Nixon and that he was probably a member of the SDS's newly formed [[Worker Student Alliance]] that sought to encourage university students to find ways to fix problems within the working class.

Though supportive of human rights, Michael would at times display [[male chauvinism]] as well; examples showed when he did not want his appendix removed by a female doctor and was a sore loser when playing a board game called ''Group Therapy'' with his family and neighbors.  Though he differed with Archie over the potential successes women and racial minorities could achieve, Michael also believed that neither could [[social evolution|socially evolve]] without good education from people like him; such an example showed when he falsely characterized a [[blue collar|blue-collar]] handyman's African American assistant as a [[Stereotypes of African Americans|minstrel show stereotype]] who donned the same "happy-go-lucky" attire as his boss in the season 3 episode ''Everybody Tells the Truth'' (Archie's version is just as stereotyped—the assistant is a member of the [[Black Power]] movement and his boss is a [[mafia]] thug).  He was also determined to ensure that Gloria shared his beliefs.&lt;ref name=uoooooav&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YX_daEhlnbsC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=gloria+bunker+stivic+high+school&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=R2FEnlZLby&amp;sig=eFwNAdgwaL9-RLVN9gh8u5MJtgQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QZoCU9fdG4TWyQHIi4CQBQ&amp;ved=0CHsQ6AEwDg#v=onepage&amp;q=gloria%20bunker%20stivic%20high%20school&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Television Shows, 1925 through 2010, 2d ed|author=Vincent Terrace|page=240|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|date=2011|ISBN=9780786464777|access-date=February 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although taken by surprise, Michael is excited to learn that Gloria is pregnant in 1971, though the pregnancy ends in a [[miscarriage]]. Gloria becomes pregnant again in 1975 and their baby Joseph "Joey" Stivic is born in December of that year.

During early episodes, Michael's best friend is [[Lionel Jefferson]]. In the first season, Lionel surprises Michael by announcing that he and his family are moving into the house next door to the Bunkers.  However, the characters rarely see or refer to each other after the Jeffersons leave ''All in the Family'' to join the spin-off ''[[The Jeffersons]]'', George Jefferson, however, would later make a guest appearance at his old residence when the Stivics start preparing for their move to California and meet with him to give notice that they will no longer be staying in his house.  Another of Michael's close friends, Al Bender (played by [[Billy Crystal]]), marries Gloria's best friend Trudy Tannen in a 1976 episode.

Mike accepts a faculty position at [[UCSB]] and he and Gloria move to [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], [[California]], at the end of the 1977–78 season (at which time Reiner and Struthers ceased to be regulars on the show). They appear in a Christmas episode during the 1978–79 season, in which Archie and Edith (and Edith's niece [[Stephanie Mills (All in the Family)|Stephanie]]) visit Michael and Gloria, exposing the fact that the couple have secretly [[marital separation|separated]] due to troubles in their marriage, including an infidelity Gloria had with one of his college faculty colleagues.  Though they seemingly resolve their differences during this episode, a Thanksgiving visit by Mike and Gloria to the Bunkers' house during the 1979-80 season of ''Archie Bunker's Place'' shows that the Stivics' marriage is still troubled, exacerbated by Michael having lost his job after he and Gloria participated in a nude protest of a proposed nuclear power plant and got arrested.  This is the last appearance of the character.

Michael Stivic does not appear in the 1982 [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series ''[[Gloria (TV series)|Gloria]]'', which starred Sally Struthers.  Initially, Reiner had been asked to participate in the series, resurrecting his Michael Stivic character, but he declined. It is explained (on the show) that Michael had left his wife and young son [[Joey Stivic|Joey]] (then played by [[Christian Jacobs]]) to live in a California [[Commune (intentional community)|commune]] with one of his students (which suggests he had found a new teaching job) -- whom Gloria described as "the [[homecoming queen]], a girl named Muffy"—and was in the process of going through a bitter divorce.  At the beginning of the series (September 1982), it has been 63 days since Michael walked out on Gloria; Michael calls to invite Gloria to the commune, but things deteriorate quickly when he claims Gloria is incapable holding a job, or of supporting herself and Joey. By the end of the series (spring 1983), the divorce is final.

==="Meathead"===
Archie routinely refers to Michael by the derogatory nickname "Meathead", from the first time they meet, as seen in [[flashback (continuity)|flashback]] in the second season episode "Mike Meets Archie".  In Archie's own words, it means "dead from the neck up".  Rob Reiner has said that "I could win the Nobel Prize and they'd write 'Meathead wins the Nobel Prize'."&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Ivor. [http://www.yehey.com/entertainment/celebs/article.aspx?id=106489 "5 minutes with Rob Reiner"], ''[[Manila Times]]'', 2003. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311133819/http://www.yehey.com/entertainment/celebs/article.aspx?id=106489 |date=March 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A later episode of ''All in the Family'' reveals that Archie Bunker himself was referred to as "Meathead" in his youth.

Norman Lear said his father used to call him "Meathead".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://wtop.com/entertainment/2015/11/king-lear-tv-legend-shares-his-sitcom-secrets-in-new-memoir/|title=King Lear: TV legend shares his sitcom secrets in new memoir|last=Fraley|first=jason|work=[[WTOP-FM]]|date=November 9, 2015|accessdate=December 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[visual art]], '''mixed media''' is an [[work of art|artwork]] in which more than one [[Art medium|medium]] or material has been employed.
Assemblages and collages are two common examples of art using different medias that will make use of different materials including [[cloth]], [[paper]], and/or [[wood]]. &lt;ref name="assemblages and collages"&gt; [https://keeleybassett.wordpress.com/2016/11/16/what-is-the-difference-between-collage-montage-and-assemblage/]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
When an artist is doing painting or photography work using mixed media, care should be taken to allow enough drying time between layers, to ensure the final work will have structural integrity. If several different mixed medias are used with the artwork, it is important to choose a sturdy foundation upon which the different media layers are imposed. 

Many artistic effects can be achieved by using mixed media. [[Found objects]] can be used in conjunction with traditional artist media to attain a wide range of self-expression. 

Some children's picture books also use mixed media illustrations. For example, [['s Nachts]] by  [[Wolf Erlbruch]].

Mixed media art, a visual art, is distinguished from [[Multimedia|multimedia art]] which combines visual art with non-visual elements, such as recorded sound, literature, drama, dance, motion graphics, music, or interactivity.

[[File:North French Hebrew Miscellany folio 117b118a.l.jpg|thumb|Left, scenes with [[Abraham]] from Genesis, ch 18; right, David]]
The '''North French Hebrew Miscellany''' or "French Miscellany" or "London Miscellany" ([[British Library]] Add. MS 11639) is an important [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[illuminated manuscript]] from 13th-century [[Capetian France|France]], created c. 1278-98.&lt;ref&gt;Tahan's c. 1278-98 is here preferred to BM's 1277-1286, see below.&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[miscellany]] is a manuscript containing texts of different types and by different authors, and this volume contains a wide range of [[Hebrew language]] texts, mostly religious but many secular.  The manuscript is exceptional among medieval Hebrew manuscripts both for its size and the diversity of the texts and the quality and lavishness of its illuminations, which as was often the case were added by Christian specialists.&lt;ref&gt;Tahan, 10-11; BM&lt;/ref&gt;

This manuscript was digitized by the British Library's Hebrew Manuscripts Digitisation Project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/projects/hebrew-manuscripts-digitisation-project|title=Hebrew Manuscripts Digitisation Project|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/FullDisplay.aspx?ref=Add_MS_11639|title=Digitised Manuscripts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The manuscript (excluding paper flyleaves) has 746 folios (so 1,492 pages), which include a [[Units of paper quantity#Quire|quire]] of six illuminated pages added at the end; the page dimensions are 16 x 12&amp;nbsp;cm. The manuscript includes "eighty-four different groups of texts, including hundreds of poems".  The Biblical and liturgical texts include the [[Pentateuch]], the  ''[[Haftarot]]'' prophetical readings, ''[[Tiqqun soferim]]'', [[Five Scrolls]], and the full annual cycle of the [[liturgy]], as well as the [[Haggadah]] ([[Passover]] ritual) and the earliest complete Hebrew text of the [[Book of Tobit]], which is not included in the [[Tanakh]] or canon of the [[Hebrew Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;Tahan, 121; BM&lt;/ref&gt;  Other texts include the ''[[Pirkei Avot]]'', prayers, [[gematria]], legal texts and calendars.  The poetry includes a large group of poems by [[Moses ibn Ezra]], the great Spanish [[Sephardic]] poet of the previous century.&lt;ref&gt;Facsimile has the fullest list; BM&lt;/ref&gt; The single scribe of the texts is named (in four places) as "Benjamin", who may have compiled the book for his own use; there is no "proper [[colophon (publishing)|colophon]]" as might be expected in a commissioned manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;Tahan, 121&lt;/ref&gt;   Another suggestion is that the unusual number of illustrations including the biblical figure of [[Aaron]] indicate a patron with this name.&lt;ref&gt;Facsimile&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:North French Hebrew Miscellany 260b.l Esther before Ahasuerus.jpg|thumb|[[Esther]] before [[Ahasuerus]].]]
The manuscript is illustrated with a total of 49 full-page miniatures, mostly of Biblical subjects, "which were executed by Christian illuminators attached to three major contemporary Parisian workshops", and probably also worked on at [[Amiens]] or another north French city,&lt;ref&gt;Still a matter of some discussion, see Tahan, 119 (quoted); Facsimile, which is more open to the possibility of some of the artists being Jewish;BM&lt;/ref&gt; and reflect the latest Gothic styles, though the execution of the various artists is uneven, and one scholar complains that "broad, flat expanses of crudely painted, often runny pigment; angular, etiolated figures, and unusual colours place it well outside the orbit of the Parisian de luxe book, although its painters were undoubtedly influenced by the Parisian style".&lt;ref&gt;Wolinski, 280-281&lt;/ref&gt;

The subjects include Jewish mythical beasts whose depiction draws on Christian [[bestiaries]].&lt;ref&gt;Tahan, 119-122&lt;/ref&gt; These are mostly illustrated in [[roundel]]s with a text caption beneath, while the narrative scenes from the Pentateuch are in rectangular miniatures (the scene with [[Noah's Ark]] illustrated here is an exception).  There are 2 full-page diagrams in ink of the stars and planets and the [[signs of the zodiac]] (ff. 542, 542v) and "numerous inhabited initial-word panels, and inhabited and decorated panels in colours and gold attached to initial words and numerous decorated initial-word panels with gold letters".&lt;ref name="BM"&gt;BM&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The relatively precise dating comes from aspects of the text including the inclusion of [[Isaac ben Joseph of Corbeil]]'s legal compendium the ''[[Sefer Mitzvot Katan]]'', a text known to have been finished in 1277, mentions of [[Yehiel of Paris]], who died in 1286, as still alive, and "a table of [[molad]]ot (lunation-commencements) for the period 1279/80 - 1295/95 (f. 444)".&lt;ref name="BM" /&gt;  The style of the miniatures accords with this date range.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

==Provenance==
Inscriptions record various points in the manuscript's history, though many gaps remain.  It perhaps left France for Germany in the persecutions of 1306. A loan of the book is noted in 1426, and in 1431 it was sold to an Abraham ben Moses of [[Coburg]].  By 1479 it was in Italy at [[Mestre]] on the coast opposite [[Venice]], where it went next, followed by [[Padua]] in 1480 and [[Iesi]] near [[Ancona]] in 1481.  The 16th century [[bookbinding]] has the arms of the Jewish [[Abraham Rovigo|Rovigo]] family, but in the 17th century the manuscript passed into Christian hands, including the [[Barberini]] family. It was examined by the [[Christian Hebraist]] [[Giovanni Bernardo De Rossi]] and published in his work ''Variae lectionis veteris testamenti'' ([[Parma]], 1784).  It was bought by a Paris bookseller from a [[Milan]] collection for the [[British Museum]] in 1839.&lt;ref&gt;Facsimile; BM&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Playing the Building''''' was an art installation by [[David Byrne]], ex singer of [[Talking Heads]], and [[Färgfabriken]], an independent art venue in [[Stockholm]]. It originally ran from October 8 to November 13, 2005 at Färgfabriken. The concept would later be realized in [[New York City]] in the [[Battery Maritime Building]] in 2008 (May 31 to August 10), in [[London]] in [[The Roundhouse]] in 2009 (August 8 to 31), and in [[Minneapolis]] at the Aria building in the [[Minneapolis Warehouse Historic District]] in 2012 (November 5 to December 4).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.davidbyrne.com/archive/art/art_projects/playing_the_building/ |title=Playing the Building |author=&lt;!--no by-line--&gt; |date=&lt;!--none given--&gt; |website=[http://www.davidbyrne.com DavidByrne.com] |access-date=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept entailed utilizing the infrastructure of these buildings and spaces as resonating bodies to create sounds. Different methods are used to produce the sounds, including hitting columns with metal rods, strapping vibrating motors to girders, and blowing air through pipes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Randy

'''Robert Wallace Ellis''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|ONZM|size=85%}} (born 2 April 1929) is a British-born New Zealand painter and artist known for paintings that tackle social, cultural and environmental themes.

==Early life and family==
Born in [[Northampton]], England, on 2 April 1929, Ellis studied at Northampton School of Art from 1944 to 1947, before completing his [[Conscription in the United Kingdom|national service]] with the photographic unit of [[RAF Bomber Command]] between 1947 and 1949. He was awarded a scholarship to attend the [[Royal College of Art]] from 1949 to 1953 graduating with a diploma.&lt;ref name="Whos who"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Taylor |editor-first=Alister |title=New Zealand Who's Who Aotearoa 2001 |year=2001 |publisher=Alister Taylor Publishers |location=Auckland |issn=1172-9813}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis moved to New Zealand in 1957 to take up a position as lecturer in design at Elam School of Fine Arts. He married Elizabeth Aroha Mountain (Ngapuhi, Ngati Porou) in 1966. The couple have twin daughters, Hana and Ngarino. and three grand-children, Emere, Hana, Takimoana. They live in Auckland, in the house Robert helped build in 1969-70.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://search.ancestry.com.au/cgi-bin/sse.dll?indiv=try&amp;db=NZNaturalisations&amp;h=62728 |title=New Zealand, naturalisations |year=2010 |website= |publisher=Ancestry.com Operations |accessdate=29 October 2016 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic and artistic career==
Ellis lectured at the Yeovil School of Art in [[Somerset]] from 1953 to 1957.&lt;ref name="Whos who"/&gt; After he moved to [[Auckland]] in 1957 he began teaching at [[Elam School of Fine Arts]]. In 1992 he was awarded a personal chair in 1992, and retired as a Professor Emeritus in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.aucklandartgallery.com/the-collection/browse-artists/1933/robert-ellis|title = Robert Ellis|date = |accessdate = 1 September 2015|website = Auckland Art Gallery|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; During 1982 he was a visiting professor at [[Ohio State University]].&lt;ref name="Whos who"/&gt;

Ellis served as a council member of the Auckland Society of Arts, and was the foundation president of the New Zealand Society of Industrial Designers. He was also a council member, secretary, and president of the New Zealand Society of Sculptors, Painters and Associates, and was a New Zealand delegate to the [[FIDEM|International Art Medal Federation]].&lt;ref name="Whos who"/&gt; In the [[2001 New Year Honours]] Ellis was appointed an [[New Zealand Order of Merit|Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit]] for services to fine arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dpmc.govt.nz/node/388 | title=New Year honours list 2001 |date=30 December 2000 | publisher=Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet | accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellis has been described as one of "New Zealand's pre-eminent artists" and he has held more than 60 solo exhibitions in New Zealand and around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.milfordgalleries.co.nz/dunedin/artist/112-Robert-Ellis|title = Robert Ellis|date = |accessdate = 1 September 2015|website = Milford Galleries Dunedin|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His landscape paintings address themes of urbanisation, subdivision and colonisation. [[Auckland Art Gallery]] senior curator Ron Brownson describes Ellis's place in modern New Zealand art: "As a major figure, Ellis' art addresses many cultural issues. His subjects range over tensions between transport and urbanism, contrast ecology with spirituality and look at the on-going nature of Māori–Pākehā relations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.aucklandartgallery.com/about/media-releases/friends-of-gallery-gift-important-artwork-in-first-time-exhibition-of-paintings-by-senior-auckland-artist|title = Friends of Gallery gift important artwork in first-time exhibition of paintings by senior Auckland artist|date = 2014|accessdate = 1 September 2015|website = |publisher = Auckland Art Gallery|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His work was the focus of a major book published by Ron Sang in 2015, entitled ''Robert Ellis'' [see review below]. He continues to produce small works on paper in his studio at home.

== Work ==
Throughout his career Ellis has produced a diverse range of works. They include not only paintings and works on paper, but also stained glass (design of the east wall of the nave in Holy Trinity Cathedral, Parnell), tapestry (the largest in the world at the time, and now in the Aotea Centre, Auckland), and medallions.

[[File:RoyBailey 2007.JPG|thumb|right|Roy Bailey at Bromyard Folk Festival, 2007]]
'''Roy Bailey''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|MBE}} (20 October 1935 – 20 November 2018) was an English [[socialist]] [[folk singer]]. [[Colin Irwin (journalist)|Colin Irwin]] from the music magazine ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' said Bailey represented "the very soul of folk's [[working class]] [[Ideal (ethics)|ideals]]... a triumphal [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to the [[grass roots]] folk scene as a radical alternative to the [[mainstream]] music industry."

==Biography==
Bailey began his musical career in a [[skiffle]] band in 1958, and later joined folk supergroup the Three City Four featuring [[Leon Rosselson]], as a replacement for [[Martin Carthy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/roy-bailey-mn0000343290/biography |title=Roy Bailey &amp;#124; Biography &amp; History |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first solo album was released in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mainlynorfolk.info/roy.bailey/records/roybailey.html |title=Roy Bailey |website=Mainlynorfolk.info |date=2014-09-12 |accessdate=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He performed a number of songs by the [[United States|American]] [[singer-songwriter]] [[Si Kahn]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mainlynorfolk.info/roy.bailey/records/freedompeacefully.html |title=Roy Bailey: … Freedom Peacefully |website=Mainlynorfolk.info |date=2015-11-03 |accessdate=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was also renowned as a singer of children's songs, often using material written by his old partner Leon Rosselson. ''Oats &amp; Beans &amp; Kangaroos'' is an album of children's songs performed by Roy &amp; Val Bailey with Leon Rosselson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mainlynorfolk.info/roy.bailey/records/oatsandbeansandkangaroos.html |title=Roy &amp; Val Bailey with Leon Rosselson: Oats &amp; Beans &amp; Kangaroos |website=Mainlynorfolk.info |date=2014-09-14 |accessdate=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mainlynorfolk.info/roy.bailey/records/whydoesithavetobeme.html |title=Roy Bailey: Why Does It Have to Be Me? |website=Mainlynorfolk.info |date=2015-11-03 |accessdate=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bailey worked with [[Robb Johnson]] and others on the award-winning ''[[Gentle Men]]'' album, released in 1997 and re-recorded and released in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Robin Denselow |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/07/robb-johnson-bailey-gentle-men-review |title=Robb Johnson, Roy Bailey, Barb Jungr etc: Gentle Men – review &amp;#124; Music |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Bailey and [[Tony Benn]] were awarded "Best Live Act" at the [[BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards]] for their programme ''Writing on the Wall'', later an album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mainlynorfolk.info/roy.bailey/records/thewritingonthewall.html |title=Tony Benn &amp; Roy Bailey: The Writing on the Wall |website=Mainlynorfolk.info |date=2014-04-26 |accessdate=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tony Benn cited Roy Bailey as "the greatest socialist [[folk singer]] of his generation."

In the 2000 Honours List, he received the [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] for Services to Folk Music. On 23 August 2006, he returned the MBE in protest at the British government's [[Foreign relations of the United Kingdom|foreign policy]] with regard to [[Lebanon]] and the [[Palestinian territories]]. By doing so he joined the [[list of people who have declined a British honour]].

He contributed vocals to [[Chumbawamba]]'s 2008 album ''[[The Boy Bands Have Won]]'', on the track "Word Bomber", a song about the London suicide attacks in 2005. He also joined the band on stage to sing the song, on their farewell Leeds show in October 2012.

In 2016, Roy released his first live album, Live At Towersey Festival 2015, which was recorded in secret at the festival and featured guest appearances from [[Martin Simpson]] and [[Andy Cutting]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://folking.com/roy-bailey-announces-first-ever-live-album/ "Roy Bailey announces first ever live album"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161023063500/http://folking.com/roy-bailey-announces-first-ever-live-album/ |date=23 October 2016 }}, "Folking", August 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The album contained songs written by [[Si Kahn]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Tom Waits]], [[John Tams]], [[Robb Johnson]] and others. Roy appeared at the very first Towersey Festival in 1965 and his now established Monday afternoon concert regularly draws a crowd of around 1,000.

Roy Bailey was an [[Emeritus]] Professor of [[Social Studies]] at [[Sheffield Hallam University]]. He was also the patron of [[Towersey Village Festival]], Shepley Spring Festival and the Music on the Marr Festival based in the village of [[Castle Carrock]], [[Cumbria]]. He was the father-in-law of [[Martin Simpson]], a singer and guitarist, whose wife Kit is Bailey's daughter.

Having struggled with heart failure for over 30 years, Bailey died on 20 November 2018 in St Luke's Hospice, Sheffield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Geoff|last1=Tesson|title=Roy Bailey obituary|url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/nov/20/roy-bailey-obituary|date=20 November 2018|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Russian Schoolroom''''' (1967) — also known as '''''The Russian Classroom''''' and '''''Russian Schoolchildren''''' — is an [[oil on canvas]] painting created by American [[illustrator]] [[Norman Rockwell]] (1894–1978) and commissioned by ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'' magazine.  It depicts Russian schoolchildren in a classroom with a bust of Soviet leader [[Vladimir Lenin]].

The painting is shown at the [[National Museum of American Illustration]].

==Description==
''Russian Schoolroom'' depicts a group of seated and attentive Soviet schoolchildren looking towards the viewer’s left, presumably at a teacher outside the visual frame. A [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] of V.I. Lenin with strewn flowers is, however, partially visible there. The children wear [[Young Pioneer organization of the Soviet Union|red Young Communist neckerchiefs]] and a Russian slogan on the wall behind them exhorts them to “Study and Learn”. One pupil on the right, however, looks away to the viewer’s right, like a typical schoolboy losing focus and finding something more interesting to see outdoors.

==Background==
''Russian Schoolroom'' was published in the October 3, 1967, edition of ''Look'' as part of a series of articles on life in the [[Soviet Union]].  Rockwell had visited School No. 39 in Moscow where he drew puppy sketches on a chalkboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://2neat.com/magazine/product/look-magazine-october-3-1967/ |title=LOOK Magazine – October 3, 1967 |website=2neat.com |accessdate=May 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reference photos of the Moscow classroom with pupils, taken as a model for Rockwell’s final painting, reveal that the inattentive pupil is actually paying close attention to the teacher, with eyes front.&lt;ref name=ackerman/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://collection.nrm.org/search.do?id=550181&amp;db=object&amp;view=full |title=Reference photo for Education (38883) |website=Norman Rockwell Museum |accessdate=May 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that in changing this detail, Rockwell slightly subverted the image to make a subtle political point in favor of non-conformity.&lt;ref name=ackerman&gt;{{cite web |last=Ackerman |first=Mark |date=March 12, 2011 |url=http://www.culturevoyage.co.uk/norman-rockwell-does-it-matter-if-its-art/ |title=Norman Rockwell – Does it Matter if it’s Art? |website=culturevoyage.co.uk |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426043613/http://www.culturevoyage.co.uk/norman-rockwell-does-it-matter-if-its-art/ |archive-date=April 26, 2012 |via=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional reference photos show Rockwell himself sitting in that student's seat, apparently demonstrating a distracted look, which the student then emulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://collection.nrm.org/search.do?id=550369&amp;db=object&amp;view=full |title=Reference photo for Education (38917) |website=Norman Rockwell Museum |accessdate=May 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://collection.nrm.org/search.do?id=550386&amp;db=object&amp;view=full |title=Reference photo for Education (38918) |website=Norman Rockwell Museum |accessdate=May 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theft and litigation==
The painting was stolen during an exhibit at a small art gallery in [[Clayton, Missouri]], in June 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19031262/rockwell_work_is_stolen_from_clayton/ |title=Rockwell Work Is Stolen From Clayton Shop |newspaper=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]] |page=13 |date=June 26, 1973 |accessdate=April 7, 2018 |via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, it turned up and was sold at an auction in New Orleans for about $70,000. [[Steven Spielberg]] bought the painting from [[Judy Goffman Cutler]], a noted [[art dealer]] who specialized in American illustrators, in 1989 for $200,000.  A member of his staff spotted the painting on a [[FBI]] web listing of stolen works of art and the authorities were immediately notified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.today.com/id/17430445#.WRU5AFKZOiI |title=Stolen Rockwell found in Spielberg’s collection |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=March 3, 2007 |via=[[Today (U.S. TV program)|''Today'']]}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2009, the painting was in the custody of the [[United States District Court for the District of Nevada|U.S. District Court in Las Vegas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Boehm |first=Mike |date=October 6, 2009 |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2009/10/spielberg-and-the-rockwell-painting-that-got-away.html |title=Steven Spielberg and the Norman Rockwell painting that got away |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=2010-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court decided in 2010 that the painting belonged to Cutler, who has added it to the collection on display at the [[National Museum of American Illustration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Richard |last=Salit |date=April 18, 2010  |url=http://www.projo.com/news/content/ROCKWELL_DECISION_04-18-10_G5I4SSM_v8.352d873.html |newspaper=[[The Providence Journal]] |title=Judge vindicates Newport art dealer over sale of painting |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100422212203/http://www.projo.com/news/content/ROCKWELL_DECISION_04-18-10_G5I4SSM_v8.352d873.html |archivedate=April 22, 2010 |via=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[publishing]] and [[library science|library and information science]], the term '''serial''' is applied to materials "in any medium issued under the same title in a succession of discrete parts, usually numbered (or dated) and appearing at regular or irregular intervals with no predetermined conclusion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_S.aspx?#serial |title=Serial |work=ODLIS — Online Dictionary for Library and Information Science |publisher=Abc-Clio |date=2006-11-12 |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Periodicals ==
{{main|Periodical literature}}
In contrast to serials in general, a periodical has been defined as "A serial publication with its own distinctive title, containing a mix of articles  ... by more than one contributor, issued ... at regular stated intervals of less than a year, without prior decision as to when the final issue will appear."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_P.aspx?#periodical |title=Periodical |work=ODLIS — Online Dictionary for Library and Information Science |publisher=Abc-Clio |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Thus a periodical does not admit irregularly spaced publication times. This includes [[magazines]] and [[academic journals|journals]], but not [[proceedings]]; it also does not include [[newspapers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_N.aspx?#newspaper |title=Newspaper |work=ODLIS — Online Dictionary for Library and Information Science |publisher=Abc-Clio |date= |accessdate=2015-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1281">'''Strié''' is a popular form of [[faux painting]] using [[glaze (painting technique)|glaze]] and paint brushes to create a soft natural striped texture.  [[File:sch ewf 10.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Example of the strie faux painting technique over raised stencil]]

Strié is a negative glaze technique. The glaze is generally rolled over the entire surface, and then removed with a tool such as a brush.&lt;ref&gt;Phil Schmidt, ''Building &amp; Finishing Walls &amp; Ceilings'', Creative Publishing International, 2002, p86. {{ISBN|1-58923-042-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''strié'' can be used to describe this process of painting, or to describe the actual finish created.

Strié is a simple technique that can be altered and elaborated in many ways.  It can be done on its own, with the streaks directed either vertically or horizontally.  It can be brushed over a raised [[plaster]] stencil.  It is also very popular to overlap a horizontal and vertical strié, creating the look of fabrics such as linen or denim.  This is often referred to as a linen weave or burlap strié.

'''Tehni Tehni Macedonian Art Association''', or Tehni, was established in 1951, in [[Thessaloniki]], [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]], [[Greece]] with the aim of cultivating and disseminating art and literature in Thessaloniki and the rest of [[Northern Greece]]. It helped to found the [[State Orchestra of Thessaloniki]], the [[Thessaloniki Film Festival]], and the [[State Theatre of Northern Greece]], and assisted in the expansion of art activities by setting up similar associations in provincial towns. In 1999, Tehni moved into a restored, listed building next to the [[Byzantine]] walls in Ano Poli, Thessalonikis Upper Town.

Tehni runs a film club, a youth centre, a theatre workshop, a music workshop and a lending library specialising in music and drama. The Tehni art gallery consists of a collection of important paintings by 75 contemporary Greek painters and a collection of 370 engravings representative of Greek output in the 20th century.

The paintings are not on permanent display due to lack of space. However, the association sponsors exhibitions in Thessaloniki and northern Greece. In 1999, the engravings, grouped in four generations (1879–1967), were exhibited in Thessaloniki ([[Vafopoulos Cultural Centre]] and [[Neapoli, Thessaloniki|Neapoli]] Town Hall), [[Florina]], and [[Kavala]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumsofmacedonia.gr/Art_Museums_and_Galleries/Etairia_Texni.html Museums of Macedonia] web site&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macedonian-heritage.gr/Museums/credits.html  Creative CommonsAttribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Bucket List''''' is a 2007 [[United States|American]] [[comedy-drama]] [[film]] directed and produced by [[Rob Reiner]], written by [[Justin Zackham]], and starring [[Jack Nicholson]] and [[Morgan Freeman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/658339/Bucket-List-The/full-credits.html|title=The Bucket List|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|accessdate=April 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main plot follows two [[terminal illness|terminally ill]] men on their [[road trip]] with a [[wish list]] of things to do before they "[[kick the bucket]]".

The film premiered on December 15, 2007 in [[Hollywood]] and opened in [[limited release]] in the United States on December 25, 2007, by [[Warner Bros.]] The film then had a wide release on January 11, 2008. Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics, the film was chosen by [[National Board of Review]] as one of the [[National Board of Review Awards 2007#Top 10 Films|top ten films of 2007]] and was a box office success, grossing $175 million worldwide.

==Plot==
Two men, [[blue-collar]] mechanic Carter Chambers (Freeman) and billionaire hospital magnate Edward Cole (Nicholson) meet for the first time in the hospital after both have been diagnosed with terminal [[lung cancer]]. 

Carter is a gifted amateur historian and family man who wanted to become a history professor in his youth but never rose above his status as a mechanic. Edward is a four-time divorced health-care tycoon and cultured loner who enjoys tormenting his personal valet/servant, Thomas ([[Sean Hayes (actor)|Sean Hayes]]), who later reveals his name is actually Matthew. Edward enjoys drinking [[Kopi Luwak]], one of the most expensive coffees in the world.

During their time in the ward, Carter and Edward find common ground. Carter begins writing a "bucket list", or things to do before he "[[kick the bucket|kicks the bucket]]". After hearing he has less than a year, Carter discards the list. Edward finds it the next morning and urges Carter to do everything on the list, offering to finance the trip for both of them. Carter agrees and despite the protests of his wife, Virginia ([[Beverly Todd]]), Edward and Carter begin their around-the-world vacation. They go skydiving, drive a [[Shelby Mustang]], fly over the [[North Pole]], eat dinner at [[Chevre_d%27or|Chevre d'or]] in [[France]], visit and praise the beauty and history of [[Taj Mahal]], [[India]], ride motorcycles on the [[Great Wall of China]], attend a lion [[safari]] in [[Tanzania]], and visit the base of [[Mt. Everest]] in [[Nepal]].

Atop the [[Great Pyramid of Giza|Great Pyramid]], looking out over the pyramids of [[Pyramid of Khafre|Khafre]] and [[Pyramid of Menkaure|Menkaure]], they confide about faith and family, revealing that Carter has long been feeling less in love with his wife and that Edward is deeply hurt by his estrangement from his only daughter, who disowned him after he drove away her [[domestic violence|abusive]] husband. In [[Hong Kong]], Edward hires a prostitute for Carter, who has never been with any woman but his wife. Carter declines and realizing that he loves his wife, asks to return home. 

On the drive back, Carter reciprocates by trying to reunite Edward with his daughter. Believing it is a breach of trust, Edward angrily storms off. Carter returns home to his family while Edward stays home alone. However, the family reunion is short-lived: Carter suffers a seizure and is rushed to the hospital, the cancer having spread to his brain.

Edward, who is now in [[Remission (medicine)|remission]], visits him and they share a few moments, wherein Carter reveals how Edward's Kopi Luwak coffee is grown in [[Sumatra]] and then fed to and defecated by a [[Asian palm civet|jungle cat]] before being harvested because of the special aroma of the gastric juices. Carter crosses off "laugh till I cry" from his bucket list and insists Edward finish the list without him. Carter then undergoes surgery but dies on the operating table. 

As news of Carter's death is given to his wife and family, Edward attempts to reconcile with his own daughter. She accepts him back into her life and introduces him to the granddaughter he never knew he had. After greeting the little girl with a kiss on the cheek, Edward crosses "kiss the most beautiful girl in the world" off the list. Edward delivers a eulogy at Carter's funeral, during which he explains that the last three months of Carter's life were the best three months of his life and crosses "help a complete stranger for the good" off the list.

The epilogue reveals that Edward lived until age 81, and his ashes were then taken to the summit of a peak in the [[Himalayas]] by his assistant Matthew. As Matthew places a [[Chock full o'Nuts]] coffee can alongside another can, he crosses off the last item on the bucket list ("witness something truly majestic") and places it between the cans. Carter's narration reveals that the two cans contain their ashes and that Edward would have loved this, because he was "buried on the mountain and that was against the law".

==Reception==
''The Bucket List'' received mixed reviews from critics. On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a rating of 40%, based on 170 reviews, with an average rating of 5.1/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Not even the earnest performances of the two leads can rescue ''The Bucket List'' from its schmaltzy script".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bucket_list/ |title=The Bucket List &amp;ndash; Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=2008-05-04 |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]] gave the film a score of 42 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/bucketlist |title=Bucket List, The (2007): Reviews |accessdate=2008-01-19 |publisher=[[Metacritic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Roger Ebert]], who had [[thyroid cancer]], criticized the film's portrayal of cancer sufferers, writing in his one-star review that ''The Bucket List'' "...thinks dying of cancer is a laff riot followed by a dime-store [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080110/REVIEWS/801100301/1023 | work=Chicago Sun-Times | title=The Bucket List}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film opened in wide release in the United States and Canada on January 11, 2008 and grossed $19,392,416 from 3,200 screens at 2,911 theaters, averaging $6,662 per theater ($6,060 per screen) and ranking #1 at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekend&amp;id=bucketlist.htm |title=The Bucket List (2007) &amp;ndash; Weekend Box Office Results |accessdate=2008-01-28 |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film closed on June 5, 2008, never having a weekend-to-weekend decline of more than 40%, and ended up with a final gross of $93,466,502 in the United States and Canada and another $81,906,000 overseas, for a total gross of $175,372,502 worldwide, easily recouping the film's considerable $45 million budget and turning a sizable profit for [[Warner Bros.

A [[film score|score]] album from Varèse Sarabande was released on January 15, 2008, featuring composer [[Marc Shaiman]]'s original score for the film as well as a selection of newly recorded themes from Shaiman's previous scoring projects, including ''[[City Slickers]]'', ''[[Simon Birch]]'', ''[[The Addams Family (1991 film)|The Addams Family]]'', ''[[Mother (1996 film)|Mother]]'', ''[[North (1994 film)|North]]'', ''[[Sleepless in Seattle]]'', ''[[South Park: Bigger Longer &amp; Uncut]]'', ''[[Mr. Saturday Night]]'', and ''[[Stuart Saves His Family]]''. It also features a rearranged version of the [[James Bond]] theme "[[Goldfinger (song)|Goldfinger]]" (titled "Printmaster"), with Shaiman's own voice and lyrics in which he spoofs the industry's habit of tracking music in scenes where they don't belong.

'''The Entertainment Capital of the World''' is an [[advertising slogan]] first coined to refer to [[Los Angeles]] due to the presence of [[Hollywood]], and the area's [[radio]], [[television]], [[music]], and [[filmmaking]], as well as the abundance of tourist and amusement attractions in the region. This title is also claimed by [[Las Vegas]] although sometimes also referring to itself as the Live Entertainment Capital of the World.&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS134603+28-Jan-2008+PRN20080128|title=LA Times Unveils Online 'Entertainment' Redesign|date=Jan 28, 2008|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=2009-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The slogan was billed on the sign at [[MGM Grand Las Vegas]].&lt;ref&gt;[[MGM Grand Las Vegas#MGM Grand (1993–present)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2756">"'''The Flail From Heaven'''" (German: ''Der Dreschflegel vom Himmel'') is a [[Grimm's Fairy Tales|Brothers Grimm fairy tale]] collected by the [[Brothers Grimm]]. Since the second edition published in 1819, it has been recorded as Tale no. 112.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://myweb.dal.ca/barkerb/fairies/grimm/112.html |title=Grimm / Tale112 |publisher=Myweb.dal.ca |date=2003-05-30 |accessdate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is [[Aarne–Thompson]] type  AT 1889K, ''A Rope Made of Chaff''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grimmstories.com/en/grimm_fairy-tales/classification |title=Grimm - Classification (Aarne-Thompson) |publisher=Grimmstories.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The tale begins with a peasant tilling his fields with a pair of oxen. Inexplicably, while in the field, the oxen's horns grew to an extraordinary size; an effect that prevented the peasant from returning home with them. Fortunately, the peasant was able to sell the oxen to a nearby butcher. The butcher, having no currency on him, bartered a measure of turnip-seed with the peasant, offering should the peasant return to him with the measure of [[rapeseed]] he would exchange a [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] [[thaler]] for each seed. The peasant returned home with the seed, however, he lost one seed out of the bag on the way. The next day, the butcher paid him per agreement minus the one missing seed. On his way back from the butcher, the peasant passed where he dropped the seed and saw it had sprouted into a tree which reached up to the heavens. The peasant climbed the tree and, reaching the top, spied angels [[threshing]] oats. While he was viewing the angels, the tree began to shake; someone below was cutting down the tree. To save himself from being falling from the tree, the peasant wove a length of rope from the oat [[chaff]] that lay in piles. Before descending he stole a [[Hoe (tool)|hoe]] and a [[flail]] which were lying in the heavenly fields. He descended the rope only to find himself at the bottom of deep pit. Using the hoe, he carved a flight of steps and walked up and out of the pit. The peasant kept the flail as proof of his adventure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanliterature.com/author/brothers-grimm/fairy-tale/the-flail-from-heaven |title=The Flail From Heaven - The Brothers Grimm |publisher=Americanliterature.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trim''' was a [[ship's cat]] who accompanied [[Matthew Flinders]] on his voyages to [[Circumnavigation|circumnavigate]] and map the coastline of [[Australia]] in 1801–03.

== Biography ==
Trim was born in 1799 aboard the ship [[HMS Reliance (1793)|HMS ''Reliance'']] on a voyage from the [[Cape of Good Hope]] to [[Botany Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rebekah Higgitt |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/the-h-word/2014/jul/18/matthew-flinders-bicentenary-statue-navigator-science-history |title=Matthew Flinders bicentenary: statue unveiled to the most famous navigator you’ve probably never heard of &amp;#124; Rebekah Higgitt &amp;#124; Science |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The kitten fell overboard, but managed to swim back to the vessel and climb aboard by scaling a rope; taking note of his strong survival instinct and intelligence, Flinders and the crew made him their favourite.&lt;ref name=Trimpaper1/&gt;

Trim sailed with Flinders on [[HMS Investigator (1798)|HMS ''Investigator'']] on his voyage of circumnavigation around the Australian mainland&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://flinders.rmg.co.uk/DisplayDocumentde5e.html?ID=92&amp;CurrentPage=1&amp;CurrentXMLPage=6 |title=FLI/11 Matthew Flinders' biographical tribute to his cat Trim 1809 (FLI11) Page 6 |website=flinders.rmg.co.uk |publisher=National Maritime Museum |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Trimpaper7/&gt; and survived the shipwreck of the [[HMS Porpoise (1799)|HMS ''Porpoise'']] on [[Wreck Reefs|Wreck Reef]] in 1803.&lt;ref name=Trimpaper7&gt;{{cite web |url=http://flinders.rmg.co.uk/DisplayDocumentdfac.html?ID=92&amp;CurrentPage=1&amp;CurrentXMLPage=7 |title=FLI/11 Matthew Flinders' biographical tribute to his cat Trim 1809 (FLI11) Page 7 |website=flinders.rmg.co.uk |publisher=National Maritime Museum |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Flinders was accused of spying and imprisoned by the French in [[Isle de France (Mauritius)|Mauritius]] on his return voyage to [[England]], Trim shared his captivity until his unexplained disappearance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slsa.sa.gov.au/encounter/flinders/bio.htm |title=Matthew Flinders (1774-1814) |publisher=Slsa.sa.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Flinders attributed to his having been stolen and [[Cat meat|eaten]] by a hungry [[Slavery|slave]].&lt;ref name="Flinders2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Matthew Flinders|title=Terra Australis: Matthew Flinders' Great Adventures in the Circumnavigattion of Australia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a99-Lzr6G38C&amp;pg=PR30|date=26 April 2012|publisher=Text Publishing Company|isbn=978-1-921922-40-4|pages=30–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Trim was a [[Bicolor cat|bicolour]] cat, being black with white paws, chin and chest. He was named after the butler in Laurence Sterne's ''[[Tristram Shandy]]'', because Flinders considered him to be a faithful and affectionate friend.&lt;ref name=Trimpaper1/&gt; During his imprisonment, Flinders wrote a biographical tribute to Trim in which he described him as "one of the finest animals I ever saw... [his] robe was a clear jet black, with the exception of his four feet, which seemed to have been dipped in snow and his under lip, which rivaled them in whiteness. He had also a white star on his breast."&lt;ref name=Trimpaper1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://flinders.rmg.co.uk/DisplayDocumentb322.html?ID=92&amp;CurrentPage=1&amp;CurrentXMLPage=1 |title=FLI/11 Matthew Flinders' biographical tribute to his cat Trim 1809 (FLI11) Page 1 |website=flinders.rmg.co.uk |publisher=National Maritime Museum |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Flinders wrote of Trim while still captive on the [[Isle de France (Mauritius)|Isle de France]] in 1809.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://collections.rmg.co.uk/archive/objects/500423.html?_ga=2.72797459.1066994381.1535095810-860876596.1507878119 |title=Biographical tribute to Trim the Cat, by Matthew Flinders, Isle de France Dec 1809 |website=collections.rmg.co.uk |publisher=Royal Museums Greenwich |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, a [[Bronze sculpture|bronze statue]] of Trim by [[Sculpture|sculptor]] John Cornwell was erected on a window ledge of the [[State Library of New South Wales|Mitchell Library]] in [[Sydney]], directly behind a statue of his owner that was erected following the donation of Flinders' personal papers to the Library by his grandson in 1925. The popularity of the statue has since led to the development of a range of Trim merchandise by the [[State Library of New South Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://shop.sl.nsw.gov.au/search.php?search_query=Trim |title=Gifts: Trim - Matthew Flinders cat|website=sl.nsw.gov.au |publisher=State Library of New South Wales |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Library's cafe is also named after the cat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/australia/sydney/attractions/state-library-of-nsw/a/poi-sig/367355/362319 |title=State Library of NSW |website=lonelyplanet.com |publisher=Lonely Planet |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plaque under it says:

&lt;/center&gt;}}
which is a part of the epitaph that Flinders had promised Trim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://flinders.rmg.co.uk/DisplayDocumentf71b.html?ID=92&amp;CurrentPage=1&amp;CurrentXMLPage=8 |title=The Flinders Papers: FLI/11 Matthew Flinders' biographical tribute to his cat Trim 1809 (FLI11) Page 8 |website=flinders.rmg.co.uk |publisher=National Maritime Museum |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trim also features on the first statue of Flinders to be erected in England, which can be found in [[Donington, Lincolnshire]], the birthplace of Flinders.
[[File:Trim, the boat cat. Port Lincoln..jpg|thumb|Trim, the boat cat. Port Lincoln]]
There is also a statue of Trim at the foot of his person, Flinders, in [[Port Lincoln|Port Lincoln, South Australia]]. The exact same statue is also at the [[Flinders University|Flinders University campus]] in [[Adelaide|Adelaide, South Australia]].

In addition, a large bronze statue of Matthew and Trim&lt;ref&gt;http://www.flindersmemorial.org/the-matthew-flinders-memorial-statue/&lt;/ref&gt; stands at [[Euston Railway Station]] in London.

In Australian author [[Bryce Courtenay]]'s novel, ''[[Matthew Flinders' Cat]]'', both the cat and the library statue feature as major characters.

{{wiktionary|utsushi}}

The Japanese term, {{nihongo|'''Utsushi'''|写}} can be translated as, [[appropriation (art)|appropriation]], [[Imitation|emulation]], inspiration, [[:wikt:attribution|attribution]], etc. However, the word Utsushi encompasses the meanings found in all the terms mentioned. An Utsushi can be a work where an artist is inspired by a traditional motif and incorporates the design in a work of art or the artist is emulating a masterpiece of the past to surpass the original subtly.

In Japan today, the meaning found in the term Utsushi is slowly fading and being misinterpreted or wrongly associated with the term, {{nihongo|'''mozo'''|模造}} which means to copy or reproduce. Utsushi is simply not copying or reproducing a masterpiece or motif from the past. Instead, Utsushi promotes a dialogue between the artist and the masters of the past, connecting past, present, and future.

The tradition of Utsushi has been part of the history of traditional Japanese art extending across numerous artistic fields, especially in calligraphy, painting, sculpture, architecture, lacquer, ceramics, textiles, metalwork, basketry, etc. Emulating or making an Utsushi of an existing work might be done for a variety of purposes. Appropriating the work of predecessors is one of the developmental methods in training artists across all ranges of Japanese artistic genres. Through the process of replicating the techniques and style of a noted or established master, the artist experiences firsthand the technology, material requirements, and aesthetic understanding necessary in producing an artwork of the utmost quality.

For nearly a millennium prior to the invention of printing or photographic reproduction, the process of multiple recension was the primary method of preserving literary, religious, and artistic tradition. Thus, copying was the purview not of artists in training but of seasoned veterans.

Additionally, the process of Utsushi can be seen in Japanese poetry. {{nihongo|'''Honka Dori'''|本歌取り}}, or allusive variation, is a classical poetic technique that dates back to the [[Heian Period]]. Poets construct their skills through the study of works by past masters. Once the knowledge has been absorbed so deeply that it is part of the poets' psyche, then they may quote another poet's work into their own verse without losing individuality or creativity. Also the poet expects the reader to be well versed, and to understand both quotation and originality, where “a poetic work the added weight of tradition while preventing it from being a smug expression of personal conceit.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Koga |first=Kenzo|title=Utsushi: The Aesthetics of Imitation |journal=Chanoyu Quarterly |volume=67 |year=1991|page=13| asin=B004S3JOIE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chanoyu and Utsushi ==
Within the way of tea, a new perspective is cast upon Utsushi especially when objects that display an acute sensibility of the original and its reinterpretation are displayed and used in the tea room. The aesthetic quality is highly valued where it brings both the newly conceived version and the reinterpreted into a sharper perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Koga |first=Kenzo|trans-title= The Aesthetic of Utsushi |title=Utsushi no Bigaku |language=Japanese |journal=Nagomi |date=September 1990 |publisher=Tankosha }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, objects favored by succeeding masters of the various schools in the way of tea have a close connection with the notion of Utsushi. Over the history of the way of tea, certain designs and objects preferred by specific masters have been emulated where individuals can enjoy and be familiar with the object in a different manner.

[[Image:Womanless Wedding in a Methodist Church in Cincinnati, Ohio.jpg|thumb|A womanless wedding taking place at a Methodist church in Cincinnati, Ohio in the early 20th century]]
A '''womanless wedding''' is a traditional community "ritual of inversion" performance, popular in the United States in the early 19th century.&lt;ref name="npr-20150616"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/647878931|title=Southern masculinity : perspectives on manhood in the South since Reconstruction|date=2009|publisher=University of Georgia Press|others=Friend, Craig Thompson,|isbn=0820336742|location=Athens|oclc=647878931}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this comic ritual, the all male cast would act out all roles of a traditional [[wedding party]] – including those of [[bridesmaid]]s, [[flower girl]]s, and the mother of the bride – while dressed in gowns and dresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.pantagraph.com/news/local/staged-womanless-weddings-once-drew-crowds/article_90cb4423-5c36-59b3-b03a-df3896124409.html |title= Staged ‘womanless weddings’ once drew crowds |newspaper= [[The Pantagraph]] |date= 2015-07-12 |accessdate= 2016-04-18 |last= Kemp |first= Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event often raised money for charities, civic organizations, and churches.&lt;ref name="npr-20150616"/&gt;

The performances were so popular that [[Manuscript|scripts]] were developed around the idea, and the [[do-it-yourself]] [[theatrical production]]s were passed along from city to city.&lt;ref name="npr-20150616"/&gt; Some of the stagings included [[impersonation]]s of notable Americans, such as [[Henry Ford]] and [[Charlie Chaplin]].&lt;ref name="npr-20150616"/&gt; The performances were often performed by known groups, such as the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Colin R.|date=Summer 2007|title=Camp Life: The Queer History of "Manhood" in the Civilian Conservation Corps, 1933-1937|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com.libproxy.boisestate.edu/ehost/detail/detail?vid=2&amp;sid=ea65d37b-d864-4887-956d-4c1305959650%40sessionmgr4009&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=35517482&amp;db=aph|journal=American Studies|volume=48 (2)|pages=19–35|via=Academic Search Premier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Early modern Europe, and American prior to the 19th century, used womanless weddings as a way to safely express social strains between [[Social class|classes]]. The actors were lower-class; would ridicule the social position of the upper-class through skits for entertainment purposes. The upper-class citizens benevolently approved of these acts as cultural acknowledgement of their status in society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Womanless weddings were performed throughout the United States, but most prominently in the upper Midwest and the South.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Southern towns were already staging [[burlesque shows]], and womanless weddings gave another opportunity to raise funds in the form of an admission fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Encyclopedia of North Carolina: Womanless Weddings|url=http://ncpedia.org/womanless-weddings|accessdate=June 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Womanless weddings traditionally raised funds for causes and organizations, such as a North Carolina womanless wedding which was attended by more than 1000 people to raise funds for the [[Parent-Teacher Association|Parent Teacher Association]].&lt;ref name="ForestCity"&gt;{{cite web|title=Forest City Courier from Forest City, North Carolina 1922|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/64238220/|accessdate=June 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1990s actors were compelled to confront their personal apprehensions with “[[cross-dressing]], [[same-sex intimacy]], and [[homosexuality]]”, as portraying [[Femininity|feminine]] roles within the skits no longer signified unwavering [[masculinity]] within the culture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By the 21st century, social changes and wanting to make a more “family-friendly” show caused performances of womanless weddings to adopt changing social standards, rather than slander others. Womanless Weddings were altered by removing all suggestive “[[Gender Confusion|gender confusion]]” through the sexual allusions of the scripts.

=== Social Implications ===
A womanless wedding would include a skit of a wedding ceremony, sometimes followed by a reception. The skits would elaborately make fun of [[gender stereotypes]] or other gendered qualities that went against the cultural norms of the community.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Common themes included opinionated women, premarital pregnancies, males who expressed more feminine qualities than societal standards, [[Minority group|racial minorities]], and “rural folk.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Prominent male members of a community would typically be the actors of the womanless performances.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Their status would allow for their outlandish performances of stereotypical imitations of the minorities of a community, and the conditions of a community that went against the [[social norm]]s of the culture in the spirit of entertainment to be accepted by the community with humor, rather than backlash and their [[masculinity]] being questioned by a community.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Wǔ Xíng is a synthesis of traditional [[painting]] with its namesake philosophic tradition [[Wu Xing|Wǔ Xíng]]&amp;nbsp;– or, more specifically, the use of Chinese Xie Yi painting techniques and the metaphysics of the five Wǔ Xíng elements. Wǔ Xíng painting also inherited some traits from several [[Wushu (term)|Wu Shu]] and [[Qi Gong]] schools. The closest in style is [[Xingyiquan]], whose 5 primary movements are balanced with the 5 elements of Wǔ Xíng. Because Wǔ Xíng painting techniques are associated foremost with [[consciousness]] and overcoming corporeal restraints, it is common to speak of the manifest [[art therapy]] influence of this method.

Because the philosophical,&lt;ref&gt;A. Scherbakov. How Wǔ Xíng Philosophical Principles are Incorporated in Wǔ Xíng Painting. "[http://usinart.ru/an-overview-of-wu-xing-painting-%e2%80%93-an-interview-with-andrey-scherbakov/]"&lt;/ref&gt; and technical components of this type of painting have been taken from [[Chinese culture]], it is common to hear it referred to as “Chinese Wǔ Xíng painting”.

Wǔ Xíng painting has a total of five brush strokes, five movements, and five types of composition, corresponding to the elements “Wood”, “Fire”, “Earth”, “Metal”, and “Water”.

Wǔ Xíng painting is [[metaphysics]]. Through Wǔ Xíng painting one can create a picture identical in its external appearance to any example of traditional [[Chinese painting]]. In this regard there is no difference between Wǔ Xíng painting and Chinese painting. Still, if one compares Wǔ Xíng painting and Guo Hua there are a number of differences in technique:
Traditional Guo Hua painting is divided into several genres: mountains and water, birds and branches, grass and insects, etc. and does not usually extend beyond these genres. Wǔ Xíng painting is not tied to any genres. Using the five brush strokes the artist can paint everything that he wants.
Traditional Chinese Guo Hua painting inherited an attachment to [[rice paper]] and [[silk]] as well as to a certain type of paint, while Wǔ Xíng has no such limitations.

The single most important thing for the artist who practices Wǔ Xíng painting is an attractive image harmoniously constructed using the Wǔ Xíng system. Everything else is secondary, including the type of artistic materials, the genre, and so on.

'''Z Space''' is a [[regional theater]] and performing arts company located in the Mission District of [[San Francisco, California]]. Z Space is one of the leading laboratories for developing new voices, new works, and new opportunities in the American theater. In addition to commissioning and producing its own works, Z Space also presents productions created by other organizations.  

It was founded in 1993 by David Dower, as the outgrowth of earlier theatrical productions staged by artists known as the Z Collective, and was known for a time as the Z Space Studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Wemette | first = Jonathan | title = Z Space 2011 | journal = Yale School of Drama: Management Case Study | volume = 11 | issue = 44 | pages = 2–3 | year = 2012 | url = http://yaletmknowledgebase.org/featured/case-study-z-space-2011/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Stein | first=Ruth | date=January 22, 1995 | title=Saving 'Grace': Z Space director David Dower molds new work for the Magic | periodical=San Francisco Chronicle | url=http://www.sfgate.com/default/article/Saving-Grace-Z-Space-director-David-Dower-3048215.php}}/&lt;/ref&gt; Dower was succeeded in 2007 by Lisa Steindler, who currently serves as Z Space’s executive artistic director.

In its first 15 years, Z Space developed and produced artistic works that were staged in a variety of San Francisco Bay Area theaters. Throughout the 90s and early 00s, Z Space worked with such artists as [[Josh Kornbluth]], Anne Galjour, Randall Wong, and Brian Thorstensen. In 2009, Z Space moved into its own full-time facility in San Francisco’s Mission district, situated at 450 Florida Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Veltman | first = Chloe | work = ArtsJournalBlogs | title = A New Space for Z Space | date = August 12, 2009 | url=http://www.artsjournal.com/lies/2009/08/a_new_space_for_z_space}}/&lt;/ref&gt; The 13,000-square-foot facility  originally was constructed in the 1920s as a tooling factory for the American Can Company.&lt;ref name="Stich2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sidra Stich|title=Art-SITES San Francisco: the indispensable guide to contemporary art-architecture-design|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JIpPAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=22 October 2012|year=2003|publisher=Art-SITES Press|isbn=978-1-931874-01-4|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; During World War II, the building was converted into military use, making airplane parts.&lt;ref name="felciano2002"&gt;{{Citation | last=Felciano | first=Rita | date=November 1, 2002 | title=Dark Days for Theater Artaud | periodical=Dance Magazine | url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Dark+days+for+Theater+Artaud.+(News).-a093084796}}/&lt;/ref&gt; The building's interior was transformed into the Project Artaud Theater in 1971.&lt;ref name="felciano2002" /&gt; In 2013, Z Space expanded into Z Below (formerly The Traveling Jewish Theater), an 86-seat complement to the 230-seat warehouse above. 

Z Space’s performances span a variety of disciplines, including theater, dance, visual art, music and performance art. Through its Z Space New Works program, the organization develops unique works from initial concept to on-stage production; it also provides technical residencies in which artists can make use of the entire facility, including the stage, lights and sound system to test and develop their concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Wemette | first = Jonathan | title = Z Space 2011 | journal = Yale School of Drama: Management Case Study | volume = 11 | issue = 44 | year = 2012 | pages = 5–7 | url = http://yaletmknowledgebase.org/featured/case-study-z-space-2011/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams |first=Summer L. |url=http://www.howlround.com/interview-with-lisa-steindler-by-jamie-gahlon/ |title=Interview with Lisa Steindler by Jamie Gahlon |publisher=HowlRound |date=2012-05-16 |accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other signature programs at Z Space include Word for Word, an in-house theater company that transforms works of literature verbatim to the stage,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Potter | first=Julie | title=Stories for big kids | newspaper=San Francisco Bay Guardian | date=March 9, 2011 | url=http://www.sfbg.com/pixel_vision/2011/03/09/stories-big-kids-tales-hit-stage-paul-flores-living-word-project-campo-santo}}/&lt;/ref&gt; and Youth Arts, Z Space's outreach to schools, which promotes literacy and engages students’ creativity. 

In 2013, Z Space received a three-year grant from Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to sponsor a resident playwright, Peter Sinn Nachtrieb. That grant was renewed in 2016, giving Peter a stable artistic home for another three years. Since Peter’s residency began, Z Space has produced three of his plays, ''The Totalitarians'' in 2014, ''A House Tour of the Infamous Porter Family Mansion with Tour Guide Weston Ludlow Londonderry'' in 2016, and ''The Making of a Great Moment'' in 2017.

Z Space has presented Bay Area premieres of internationally acclaimed performance ensembles [[The Wooster Group]] (2015), [[Elevator Repair Service]] (2014), [https://rudemechs.com/ Rude Mechs] (2015), and [http://www.theatermitu.org/ Theatre Mitu] (2015).

During the past decade, productions originating at Z Space have won national recognition including the [[Helen Hayes Award]] and the Kesselring Prize.  From 2001 through 2005, 15 productions developed by Z Space earned Critics Circle nominations. In 2005, ''The People’s Temple'' was awarded the [[Will Glickman]] Award for “Best New Play.” That work was developed during more than four years at Z Space; it premiered at the [[Berkeley Repertory Theatre]]. In 2007, ''American $uicide'', by Mark Jackson, was nominated by the American Theatre Critics Association for the annual ATCA/Steinberg New Play Award, honoring new scripts produced outside New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zspace.org/history.htm |title=History |publisher=Z Space |date= |accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
