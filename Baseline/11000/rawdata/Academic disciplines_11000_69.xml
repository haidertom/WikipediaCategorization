      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7188">'''Archaeological science''', also known as '''archaeometry''', consists of the application of [[scientific technique]]s to the analysis of archaeological materials, to assist in dating the materials. It is related to [[Scientific methodology|methodologies]] of archaeology.  Martinón-Torres and Killick distinguish ‘scientific archaeology’ (as an epistemology) from ‘archaeological science’ (the application of specific techniques to archaeological materials).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marcos Martinón-Torres and David Killick|title=Archaeological Theories and Archaeological Sciences in "The Oxford Handbook of Archaeological Theory"|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martinón-Torres and Killick claim that ‘archaeological science’ has promoted the development of high-level  theory in archaeology. However, Smith rejects both concepts of archaeological science because neither emphasize falsification or a search for causality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Michael E.|title=Social science and archaeological enquiry|journal=Antiquity|date=4 April 2017|volume=91|issue=356|pages=520–528|doi=10.15184/aqy.2017.19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, the [[Natural Environment Research Council|Natural and Environmental Research Council]] provides funding for archaeometry separate from the funding provided for archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;

 | publisher = Antiquity
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in almost all cases of archeometric research, scientists from the [[Natural science|natural sciences]] assist in the scientific analysis of archeological artifacts. Universities that offer courses in archeometry offer these courses frequently as free choice for [[Archaeology|archeology]] students and these courses contain mainly a nonscientific overview over the possibilities that different scientific analyses offer to them.

== Types of archaeological science ==
Archaeological science can be divided into the following areas:&lt;ref&gt;Tite, M.S. (1991) Archaeological Science - past achievements and future prospects. ''Archaeometry'' '''31''' 139-151.&lt;/ref&gt;
* physical and chemical dating methods which provide archaeologists with [[absolute dating|absolute]] and [[relative dating|relative]] [[chronology|chronologies]]
* [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]] studies
* environmental approaches which provide information on past landscapes, climates, flora, and fauna; as well as the diet, nutrition, health, and [[pathology]] of people
* mathematical methods for data treatment (including computer-based methods)
* [[remote sensing|remote-sensing]] and [[geophysical survey|geophysical-survey]] techniques for buried features
* [[conservation sciences]], involving the study of decay processes and the development of new methods of conservation

Techniques such as [[lithic analysis]], [[archaeometallurgy]], [[paleoethnobotany]], [[palynology]] and [[zooarchaeology]] also form sub-disciplines of archaeological science.

=== Dating techniques ===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}
Archaeological science has particular value when it can provide absolute dates for archaeological [[stratum|strata]] and [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]]. Some of the most important [[Dating methodologies in archaeology|dating]] techniques include:
* [[radiocarbon dating]] — especially for dating organic materials
* [[dendrochronology]] — for dating trees; also very important for calibrating radiocarbon dates
* [[thermoluminescence dating]] — for dating inorganic material (including ceramics)
* [[optically stimulated luminescence]] (OSL) — for absolutely dating and relatively profiling buried land-surfaces in vertical and horizontal stratigraphic sections, most often by measuring photons discharged from grains of [[quartz]] within sedimentary bodies (although this technique can also measure [[potassium feldspar]]s, complications caused by internally induced dose-rates often favor the use of quartz-based analyzes in archaeological applications)
* [[electron spin resonance]], as used (for example) in dating teeth
* [[potassium-argon dating]] — for dating (for example) fossilized [[Hominidae|hominid]] remains by association with volcanic sediments (the fossils themselves are not directly dated)

=== Artifact studies ===
{{refimprove section|date=September 2014}}
Another important subdiscipline of archaeometry is the study of artifacts. Archaeometrists have used a variety of methods to analyze artifacts, either to determine more about their composition, or to determine their provenance. These techniques include:
* [[X-ray fluorescence]] (XRF)
* [[inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry]] (ICP-MS)
* [[neutron activation analysis]] (NAA)
* [[scanning electron microscope|scanning electron microscopy]] (SEM)
* [[laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy]] (LIBS)

[[Lead]], [[strontium]] and [[oxygen]] [[isotope analysis]] can also test human remains to estimate the diets and even the birthplaces of a study's subjects.

[[Provenance analysis]] has the potential to determine the original source of the materials used, for example, to make a particular artifact. This can show how far the artifact has traveled and can indicate the existence of systems of [[trade|exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence of archaeometry ==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}
Archaeometry has greatly influenced modern archaeology. Archaeologists can obtain significant additional data and information using these techniques, and archaeometry has the potential to revise the understanding of the past. For example, the "second [[radiocarbon revolution]]" significantly re-dated European prehistory in the 1960s, compared to the "first radiocarbon revolution" from 1949.

== Locating Archaeological Sites ==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}
Archaeometry is an important tool in finding potential dig sites.  The use of [[remote sensing]] has enabled archaeologists to identify many more archaeological sites than they could have otherwise. The use of [[aerial photography]] (including [[satellite imagery]] and [[Lidar]]) remains the most widespread remote-sensing technique. Ground-based [[archaeological geophysics|geophysical survey]]s often help to identify and map archaeological features within identified sites.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Canopy interception''' is the [[rainfall]] that is intercepted by the [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] of a tree and successively evaporates from the leaves. [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] that is not intercepted will fall as [[throughfall]] or [[stemflow]] on the forest floor.

Many methods exist to measure canopy interception. The most often used method is by measuring rainfall above the canopy and subtract throughfall and stem flow (e.g., Helvey and Patric [1965]&lt;ref&gt;Helvey, J. D., Patric, J. H., 1965. Canopy and litter interception of rainfall by [[hardwood]]s of Eastern United States. Water Resources Research 1 (2), 193–206.&lt;/ref&gt;). However, the problem with this method is that the canopy is not homogeneous, which causes difficulty in obtaining representative throughfall data.

Another method that tried to avoid this problem is applied by e.g., Shuttleworth et al. [1984],&lt;ref&gt;Shuttleworth, W. J., Gash, J. H. C., Lloyd, C. R., Moore, C. J., Roberts, J. M., et.al, 1984. Eddy correlation measurements of energy partition for [[Amazonian forest]]. Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society 110, 1143–1162.&lt;/ref&gt; Calder et al. [1986],&lt;ref&gt;Calder, I. R., 1986. A stochastic model of rainfall interception. Journal of Hydrology 89, 65–71.&lt;/ref&gt; and Calder [1990].&lt;ref&gt;Calder, I. R., 1990. Evaporation in the uplands. John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; They covered the forest floor with plastic sheets and collected the throughfall. The disadvantage of this method is that it is not suitable for long periods, because in the end the trees will dry due to water shortage, and the method is also not applicable for snow events.

The method by Hancock and Crowther [1979]&lt;ref&gt;Hancock, N. H., Crowther, J. M., 1979. A technique for the direct measurement of water storage on a forest canopy. [[Journal of Hydrology]] 41, 105–122.&lt;/ref&gt; avoided these problems by making use of the cantilever effect of branches. If leaves on a branch hold water, it becomes more heavy and will bend. By measuring the displacement, it is possible to determine the amount intercepted water. Huang et al.&lt;ref&gt;Huang, Y. S., Chen, S. S., Lin, T. P., 2005. Continuous monitoring of water loading of trees and canopy rainfall interception using the strain gauge method. Journal of Hydrology 311, 1–7.&lt;/ref&gt; refined this method later in 2005 by making use of strain gauges. However, the disadvantages of these methods are that only information about one single branch is obtained and it will be quite laborious to measure an entire tree or forest.

'''Coleopterology''' (from [[Coleoptera]] and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]'') is a branch of [[entomology]], the [[scientific]] study of [[beetle]]s  of the order Coleoptera. Practitioners are termed '''coleopterists'''. Coleopterists have formed organizations to facilitate the study of beetles. Among these is The Coleopterists Society, an [[international organization]] based in the United States. Such organizations may have both professionals and amateurs as members, interested in beetles. When speaking informally, coleopterists sometimes refer to their study as "'''beetling'''".

== Journals ==
Research in this field is often published in [[scientific journal|peer-reviewed journals]] specific to the field of coleopterology, though journals dealing with general entomology also publish many papers on various aspects of beetle biology. Some of the journals specific to beetle research are:
* ''[[The Coleopterist]]'' (United Kingdom beetle fauna)
* ''The Coleopterists Bulletin'' (published by The Coleopterists Society)
* ''[[Elytron (journal)|Elytron]]'' (published by the European Association of Coleopterology)

The '''Digital Humanities Summer Institute''' ('''DHSI''') is an annual [[digital humanities]] training program held in June at the [[University of Victoria]], British Columbia, Canada. DHSI now attracts over 600 participants&lt;ref name="fitzpatrick"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Templeton| first = Erin| title = DHSI 2014: On Building| work = The Chronicle of Higher Education| accessdate = 2014-07-18| date = 2014-06-10| url = http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/dhsi-2014-on-building/57215}}&lt;/ref&gt; for two weeks of courses, forum discussions, paper sessions, and [[unconferences]]. DHSI has an International Advisory Board.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dhsi.org/bios.php|title=DHSI Administration and Operation Team|last=|first=|date=|website=dhsi.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In both the past and present, major overarching themes of DHSI have included collaboration, interdisciplinarity, and the creation and cultivation of a larger Digital Humanities community beyond the structure of the typical academic environment.&lt;ref&gt;Bialkowski, Voytek, Rebecca Niles, Alan Galey (2011-04/05).

The '''Earth Summits''' are [[decennial]] meetings of world leaders, organized since 1972 with help of the [[United Nations]], to help defining ways to stimulate sustainable development at the global level.  The aim is to bring together the best individuals and organisations humanity can bring forward from all kind of categories of life, to identify and update what are humanity's most pressing challenges, to quantify them, identify solutions and develop a plan of action not to run into a wall.  This plan of action is called [[Agenda 21]] and implemented by many local governments under the name [[Local Agenda 21]].  The plan of action is designed as a TQM - [[Total Quality Manual]], designed smartly and open enough, so that also organisations, companies and individuals can use it as a basis for their own [[plan of action]] and guidance not to miss out on important issue; it helps speed up understanding and identifying partners by e.g. using similar wordings and symbols.  The 2000-2015 [[Millennium Development Goals]] and the 2015-2030 [[Global Goals]] are results from these Earth Summits.  The first summit took place in [[Stockholm]] ([Sweden]) in 1972, the second in [[Nairobi]] ([[Kenya]]) in 1982, the third in [[Rio de Janeiro]] ([[Brazil]]) in 1992 and the fourth in [[Johannesburg]] ([[South Africa]]) in 2002. Last Earth Summit, called [[Rio+20]], also took place in Rio de Janeiro in 2012.

Evidence of the development of a global culture of respect for the environment, the Earth Summits are symbolically very important as - together with the [[United Nations Observances]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un.org/en/sections/observances/united-nations-observances/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;[[Calendar]] - they aim to demonstrate the collective capacity to manage, address and bring attention to humanities most pressing challenges, global problems and affirm the need to respect ecological constraints.  The 1972 summit gave birth to the United Nations Environment Program ([[UNEP]]), while the 1992 Summit launched the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ([[UNFCCC]]), whose signatory countries have met annually since 1995.

== Procedure == 
The entry into force of an [[international treaty]] usually takes several years. This is a complex process as each country needs to complete two steps to join: signing the treaty, and then ratifying it formally. The treaty enters into force only when a sufficient number of countries have ratified it (the number varies from one treaty to another).

The signatory countries of this type of treaty organize, roughly once a year, a [[conference of the parties]] (COP). Before each conference there is a preparatory meeting called the Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA) where governments negotiate the technical details of the treaty. The process is similar for the Earth Summit, which includes a series of preparatory pre-conferences.

== List of Earth Summits ==
# 1972 - The United Nations Conference on the Human Environment ([[UNCHS]]) in [[Stockholm]]
# 1982 - The 1982 Earth Summit in [[Nairobi]] ([[Kenya]]). An Earth Summit was held in Nairobi, Kenya, from 10 to 18 May 1982. The events of the time (Cold War) and the disinterest of US President Ronald Reagan (who appointed his delegated daughter Of the United States) made this summit a failure. It is not even mentioned as an official Earth Summit.
# 1992 - The [[Earth Summit|United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] ([[UNCED]]) in [[Rio de Janeiro]] ([[Brazil]]) 
# 2002 - The World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in [[Johannesburg]] ([[South Africa]]) 
# 2012 - The United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development ([[UNCSD]]) or [[Rio+20]], also took place in  [[Rio de Janeiro]] ([[Brazil]])

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Ethylene glycol poisoning''' is [[poisoning]] caused by drinking [[ethylene glycol]].&lt;ref name=Kr2012/&gt; Early symptoms include [[Substance intoxication|intoxication]], [[vomiting]] and [[abdominal pain]].&lt;ref name=Kr2012/&gt; Later symptoms may include a [[decreased level of consciousness]], [[headache]], and [[seizures]].&lt;ref name=Kr2012/&gt; Long term outcomes may include [[kidney failure]] and [[brain damage]].&lt;ref name=Kr2012/&gt; Toxicity and death may occur after drinking even a small amount.&lt;ref name=Kr2012/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
Ethylene glycol is a colorless, odorless, sweet liquid, commonly found in [[antifreeze]].&lt;ref name=Kr2012/&gt; It may be drunk accidentally or purposefully in an [[suicide|attempt to cause death]].&lt;ref name=EM2016/&gt; When broken down by the body it results in [[glycolic acid]] and [[oxalic acid]] which cause most of the toxicity.&lt;ref name=Kr2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fer2016/&gt; The diagnosis may be suspected when [[calcium oxalate crystals]] are seen in the urine or when [[acidosis]] or an increased [[osmol gap]] is present in the blood.&lt;ref name=Kr2012/&gt; Diagnosis may be confirmed by measuring ethylene glycol levels in the blood; however, many [[hospital]]s do not have the ability to perform this test.&lt;ref name=Kr2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kruse|first1=JA|title=Methanol and ethylene glycol intoxication.|journal=Critical Care Clinics|date=October 2012|volume=28|issue=4|pages=661–711|pmid=22998995|doi=10.1016/j.ccc.2012.07.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment --&gt;
Early treatment increases the chance of a good outcome.&lt;ref name=EM2016/&gt; Treatment consists of stabilizing the person, followed by the use of an [[antidote]].&lt;ref name=EM2016/&gt; The preferred antidote is [[fomepizole]] with [[ethanol]] used if this is not available.&lt;ref name=EM2016/&gt; [[Hemodialysis]] may also be used in those where there is [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] damage or a high degree of [[acidosis]].&lt;ref name=EM2016/&gt; Other treatments may include [[sodium bicarbonate]], [[thiamine]], and [[magnesium]].&lt;ref name=EM2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beauchamp|first1=GA|last2=Valento|first2=M|title=Toxic Alcohol Ingestion: Prompt Recognition And Management In The Emergency Department.|journal=Emergency medicine practice|date=September 2016|volume=18|issue=9|pages=1–20|pmid=27538060}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology and culture --&gt;
More than 5000 cases of poisoning occur in the United States each year.&lt;ref name=Na2012&gt;{{cite book|last1=Naidich|first1=Thomas P.|last2=Castillo|first2=Mauricio|last3=Cha|first3=Soonmee|last4=Smirniotopoulos|first4=James G.|title=Imaging of the Brain: Expert Radiology Series|date=2012|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=0323186475|page=960|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W26K3Jxhq1kC&amp;pg=PA960|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908221959/https://books.google.com/books?id=W26K3Jxhq1kC&amp;pg=PA960|archivedate=2017-09-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those affected are often adults and male.&lt;ref name=Fer2016&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ferri|first1=Fred F.|title=Ferri's Clinical Advisor 2017: 5 Books in 1|date=2016|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=9780323448383|page=794|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rRhCDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA794|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908221935/https://books.google.com/books?id=rRhCDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA794|archivedate=2017-09-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deaths from ethylene glycol have been reported as early as 1930.&lt;ref name=Shaw2011/&gt; An outbreak of deaths in 1937 due to a medication mixed in a similar compound, [[diethylene glycol]], resulted in the [[Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] of 1938 in the United States which mandated evidence of safety before new medications could be sold.&lt;ref name=Shaw2011&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shaw|first1=Leslie M.|title=The Clinical Toxicology Laboratory: Contemporary Practice of Poisoning Evaluation|date=2001|publisher=Amer.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Signs of ethylene glycol poisoning depend upon the time after ingestion.&lt;ref name="Washington State University on Antifreeze Poisoning"/&gt; Symptoms usually follow a three-step progression, although poisoned individuals will not always develop each stage.&lt;ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Brent J | authorlink= Jeffrey Brent| title = Current management of ethylene glycol poisoning | journal = Drugs | volume = 61 | issue = 7 | pages = 979–88 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11434452 | doi = 10.2165/00003495-200161070-00006 | issn = 0012-6667 | url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3ab9/b4cc872e76dfd6495df02b76709952d7f17b.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hess|first1=R|last2=Bartels|first2=MJ|last3=Pottenger|first3=LH|title=Ethylene glycol: an estimate of tolerable levels of exposure based on a review of animal and human data.|journal=Archives of Toxicology|date=December 2004|volume=78|issue=12|pages=671–80|pmid=15372138|doi=10.1007/s00204-004-0594-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Stage 1 (30 minutes to 12 hours) consists of [[neurological]] and [[gastrointestinal symptom]]s and looks similar to alcohol poisoning.&lt;ref name="Pet poison help line"/&gt; Poisoned individuals may appear to be [[Substance intoxication|intoxicated]], [[dizziness|dizzy]], [[ataxia|lacking coordination of muscle movements]], [[drooling]], [[depression (mood)|depressed]],&lt;ref name="Washington State University on Antifreeze Poisoning"/&gt; and have [[slurred speech]], [[seizure|seizuring]], [[pathologic nystagmus|abnormal eye movements]], [[headache]]s, and [[confusion]].&lt;ref name="Pet poison help line"/&gt; Irritation to the stomach may cause [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]].&lt;ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/&gt; Also seen are excessive thirst and urination.&lt;ref name="Pet poison help line"/&gt; Over time, the body [[Metabolism|metabolizes]] ethylene glycol into other toxins.
* Stage 2 (12 to 36 hours) where signs of "alcohol" poisoning appear to resolve, underlying severe internal damage is still occurring.&lt;ref name="Pet poison help line"/&gt; An [[tachycardia|elevated heart rate]], [[hyperventilation]] or increased breathing effort, and [[dehydration]] may start to develop, along with [[hypertension|high blood pressure]] and [[metabolic acidosis]].&lt;ref name="Pet poison help line"/&gt; These symptoms are a result of accumulation of [[organic acid]]s formed by the metabolism of ethylene glycol. Additionally [[hypocalcemia|low calcium concentrations in the blood]], [[hyperreflexia|overactive muscle reflexes]], [[Spasm|muscle spasms]], [[QT interval]] prolongation, and [[congestive heart failure]] may occur. If untreated, death most commonly occurs during this period.&lt;ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/&gt;
* Stage 3 (24 to 72 hours) kidney failure is the result of ethylene glycol poisoning. In cats, this stage occurs 12–24 hours after getting into antifreeze; in dogs, at 36–72 hours after getting into antifreeze.&lt;ref name="Pet poison help line"/&gt; During this stage, severe kidney failure is developing secondary to [[calcium oxalate]] crystals forming in the kidneys.&lt;ref name="Pet poison help line"/&gt; Severe lethargy, coma, depression, vomiting, seizures, drooling, and [[Anorexia (symptom)|inappetence]] may be seen.&lt;ref name="Pet poison help line"/&gt; Other symptoms include [[acute tubular necrosis]], [[hematuria|red blood cells in the urine]], [[proteinuria|excess proteins in the urine]], [[lower back]] pain, [[oliguria|decreased]] or [[anuria|absent]] production of urine, [[hyperkalemia|elevated blood concentration of potassium]], and [[acute kidney failure]].&lt;ref name="ClinToxicol1999-Barceloux"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Barceloux DG, Krenzelok EP, Olson K, Watson W | title=American Academy of Clinical Toxicology Practice Guidelines on the Treatment of Ethylene Glycol Poisoning.

==Sources==
The most common source of ethylene glycol is automotive [[antifreeze]] or radiator coolant, where concentrations are high.&lt;ref name="Pet poison help line"/&gt;  Other sources of ethylene glycol include windshield deicing agents, [[brake fluid]], motor oil, developing solutions for hobby photographers, wood stains, solvents, and paints.&lt;ref name="Pet poison help line"/&gt; Some people put antifreeze into their cabin’s toilet to prevent it from freezing during the winter, resulting in toxicities when animals drink from the toilet.&lt;ref name="Pet poison help line"/&gt; Small amounts of ethylene glycol may be contained in holiday ornaments such as [[snow globes]].&lt;ref name="Pet poison help line"/&gt;

The most significant source of ethylene glycol is from aircraft de-icing and anti-icing operations, where it is released onto land and eventually to waterways near airports experiencing cold winter climates.&lt;ref name="Environment Canada on Ethylene Glycol"/&gt; It is also used in manufacturing polyester products.&lt;ref name="Environment Canada on Ethylene Glycol"/&gt; In 2006, approximately 1540 kilotonnes of ethylene glycol were manufactured in Canada by three companies in Alberta, with most of the production destined for export.&lt;ref name="Environment Canada on Ethylene Glycol"/&gt;

== Pathophysiology ==
[[Image:Glycolic acid3d.png|thumb|right|[[Glycolic acid]] is the major metabolite of ethylene glycol responsible for toxicity]]
The three main systems affected by ethylene glycol poisoning are the [[central nervous system]], [[metabolic]] processes, and the [[kidney]]s.&lt;ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/&gt; The central nervous system is affected early in the course of poisoning as the result of a direct action of ethylene glycol. Similar to [[ethanol]], it causes intoxication, followed by [[drowsiness]] or [[coma]].&lt;ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/&gt; [[Seizure]]s may occur due to a direct effect.&lt;ref name="ClinToxicol1999-Barceloux"/&gt; The toxic mechanism of ethylene glycol poisoning is mainly due to the metabolites of ethylene glycol. Initially it is [[metabolized]] by [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] to [[glycolaldehyde]], which is then oxidized to [[glycolic acid]] by [[aldehyde dehydrogenase]].&lt;ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/&gt;  The increase in metabolites may cause [[encephalopathy]] or [[cerebral edema]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Maier W |title=Cerebral computed tomography of ethylene glycol intoxication |journal=Neuroradiology |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=175–7 |year=1983 |pmid=6828232 |doi= 10.1007/BF00347839 |issn=0028-3940}}&lt;/ref&gt; The metabolic effects occur 12 to 36 hours post ingestion, causing primarily [[metabolic acidosis]] which is due mainly to accumulated glycolic acid. Additionally, as a side effect of the first two steps of metabolism, an increase in the blood concentration of [[lactic acid]] occurs contributing to [[lactic acidosis]]. The formation of acid metabolites also causes inhibition of other [[metabolic pathway]]s, such as [[oxidative phosphorylation]].&lt;ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/&gt;

The kidney toxicity of ethylene glycol occurs 24 to 72 hours post ingestion and is caused by a direct [[cytotoxic]] effect of glycolic acid. The glycolic acid is then metabolized to [[glyoxylic acid]] and finally to [[oxalic acid]]. Oxalic acid binds with calcium to form [[calcium oxalate]] crystals which may deposit and cause damage to many areas of the body including the brain, heart, kidneys, and lungs.&lt;ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/&gt; The most significant effect is accumulation of calcium oxalate crystals in the kidneys which causes kidney damage leading to [[oliguric]] or [[Anuria|anuric]] [[acute kidney failure]].&lt;ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/&gt; The [[Rate-determining step|rate-limiting]] step in this cascade is the conversion of glycolic to glyoxylic acid.&lt;ref name="Gabow PA, Clay K, Sullivan JB, Lepoff R 1986 16–20"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gabow PA, Clay K, Sullivan JB, Lepoff R |title=Organic acids in ethylene glycol intoxication |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |volume=105 |issue=1 |pages=16–20 |date=July 1986 |pmid=3717806 |doi= 10.7326/0003-4819-105-1-16|url= |issn=0003-4819}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accumulation of glycolic acid in the body is mainly responsible for toxicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Clay KL, Murphy RC |title=On the metabolic acidosis of ethylene glycol intoxication |journal=[[Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology]] |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=39–49 |date=January 1977 |pmid=14421 |doi= 10.1016/0041-008X(77)90175-2|url= |issn=0041-008X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Toxicity ===
Ethylene glycol has been shown to be toxic to humans&lt;ref name="Friedman EA, Greenberg JB, Merrill JP, Dammin GJ 1962 891–902"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Friedman EA, Greenberg JB, Merrill JP, Dammin GJ |title=Consequences of ethylene glycol poisoning.

A toxic dose requiring medical treatment varies but is considered more than 0.1 mL per kg [[body weight]] (mL/kg) of [[Chemical substance|pure substance]]. That is roughly 16 mL of 50% ethylene glycol for an 80&amp;nbsp;kg adult and 4 mL for a 20&amp;nbsp;kg child. [[Poison control center]]s often use more than a lick or taste in a child or more than a mouthful in an adult as a dose requiring hospital assessment.&lt;ref name="Caravati"/&gt;

The orally [[lethal dose]] in humans has been reported as approximately 1.4 mL/kg of pure ethylene glycol.&lt;ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/&gt; That is approximately 224 mL (7.6 oz.) of 50% ethylene glycol for an 80&amp;nbsp;kg adult and 56 mL (2 oz.) for a 20&amp;nbsp;kg child.

Ethylene glycol has a low [[vapor pressure]]; it does not [[evaporate]] readily at normal temperatures and therefore high concentrations in air or intoxication are unlikely to occur following inhalational exposures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hodgman MJ, Wezorek C, Krenzelok E |title=Toxic inhalation of ethylene glycol: a pharmacological improbability |journal=Journal of Toxicology: Clinical Toxicology |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=109–11 |year=1997 |pmid=9022663 |doi=10.3109/15563659709001176  |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There may be a slight risk of poisoning where mists or fogs are generated, although this rarely leads to poisoning as ethylene glycol causes irritation and coughing when breathed in, alerting victims to its presence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wills JH, Coulston F, Harris ES, McChesney EW, Russell JC, Serrone DM |title=Inhalation of aerosolized ethylene glycol by man |journal=Clinical Toxicology |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=463–76 |year=1974 |pmid=4613525 |doi= 10.3109/15563657408988020|url= |issn=0009-9309}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethylene glycol is not well absorbed through [[Human skin|skin]] meaning poisoning following [[dermal]] exposure is also uncommon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Driver J, Tardiff RG, Sedik L, Wester RC, Maibach HI |title=In vitro percutaneous absorption of [14C] ethylene glycol |journal=Journal of Exposure Analysis and Environmental Epidemiology |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=277–84 |date=July 1993 |pmid=8260837 |doi= |issn=1053-4245 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
[[Image:Calcium oxalate crystals in urine.jpg|thumb|Urine microscopy showing [[calcium oxalate]] crystals in the urine]]

As many of the [[Medical sign|clinical signs]] and symptoms of ethylene glycol poisoning are nonspecific and occur in many poisonings the diagnosis is often difficult.&lt;ref name="Hall TL"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hall TL |title=Fomepizole in the treatment of ethylene glycol poisoning |journal=Canadian Journal of Emergency Medical Care |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=199–204 |date=May 2002 |pmid=17609006 |doi=10.1017/s1481803500006382 |url=http://www.cjem-online.ca/sites/default/files/pg199.pdf |issn=1481-8035 |format=pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5m71phrDu?url=http://www.cjem-online.ca/sites/default/files/pg199.pdf |archivedate=2009-12-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is most reliably diagnosed by the measurement of the [[Blood plasma|blood]] ethylene glycol concentration. Ethylene glycol in biological fluids can be determined by [[gas chromatography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Aarstad K, Dale O, Aakervik O, Ovrebø S, Zahlsen K |title=A rapid gas chromatographic method for determination of ethylene glycol in serum and urine |journal=Journal of Analytical Toxicology |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=218–21 |date=July 1993 |pmid=8371550 |doi= 10.1093/jat/17.4.218|issn=0146-4760 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many hospital laboratories do not have the ability to perform this [[blood test]] and in the absence of this test the diagnosis must be made based on the clinical presentation of the patient.&lt;ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/&gt; In this situation a helpful test to diagnose poisoning is the measurement of the [[osmol gap|osmolal gap]]. The patients' serum [[osmolality]] is measured by [[freezing point depression]] and then compared with the predicted osmolality based on the patients' measured [[sodium]], [[glucose]], [[blood urea nitrogen]], and any [[ethanol]] that may have been ingested. The presence of a large osmolal gap supports a diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning. However, a normal osmolar gap does not rule out ethylene glycol exposure because of wide individual variability.&lt;ref name="Jacobsen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hoffman RS, Smilkstein MJ, Howland MA, Goldfrank LR |title=Osmol gaps revisited: normal values and limitations |journal=Journal of Toxicology: Clinical Toxicology |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=81–93 |year=1993 |pmid=8433417 |doi=10.3109/15563659309000375 |url= |issn=0731-3810 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increased osmolal gap is caused by the ethylene glycol itself. As the metabolism of ethylene glycol progresses there will be less ethylene glycol and this will decrease the blood ethylene glycol concentration and the osmolal gap making this test less useful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Glaser DS |title=Utility of the serum osmol gap in the diagnosis of methanol or ethylene glycol ingestion |journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=343–6 |date=March 1996 |pmid=8599495 |doi= 10.1016/S0196-0644(96)70271-8|url= |issn=0196-0644}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the presence of other alcohols such as [[ethanol]], [[isopropanol]], or [[methanol]] or conditions such as [[Ketoacidosis|alcoholic]] or [[diabetic ketoacidosis]], [[lactic acidosis]], or kidney failure may also produce an elevated osmolal gap leading to a false diagnosis.&lt;ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/&gt;

Other laboratory abnormalities may suggest poisoning, especially the presence of a metabolic acidosis, particularly if it is characterized by a large [[anion gap]]. Large anion gap acidosis is usually present during the initial stage of poisoning. However, acidosis has a large number of [[differential diagnosis]], including poisoning from methanol, [[salicylate]]s, [[Iron poisoning|iron]], [[isoniazid]], [[paracetamol]], [[theophylline]], or from conditions such as [[uremia]] or diabetic and [[alcoholic ketoacidosis]]. The diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning should be considered in any patient with a severe acidosis.&lt;ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/&gt; Urine [[microscopy]] can reveal needle or envelope-shaped calcium oxalate crystals in the urine which can suggest poisoning; although these crystals may not be present until the late stages of poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jacobsen D, Akesson I, Shefter E |title=Urinary calcium oxalate monohydrate crystals in ethylene glycol poisoning |journal=Scandinavian Journal of Clinical and Laboratory Investigation |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=231–4 |date=May 1982 |pmid=7134806 |doi= 10.3109/00365518209168078|url= |issn=0036-5513}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, many commercial radiator [[antifreeze]] products have [[fluorescein]] added to enable radiator leaks to be detected using a [[Wood's lamp]]. Following ingestion of antifreeze products containing ethylene glycol and fluorescein, a Wood's lamp may reveal fluorescence of a patient’s mouth area, clothing, [[vomitus]], or [[urine]] which can help to diagnose poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Winter ML, Ellis MD, Snodgrass WR |title=Urine fluorescence using a Wood's lamp to detect the antifreeze additive sodium fluorescein: a qualitative adjunctive test in suspected ethylene glycol ingestions |journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine |volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=663–7 |date=June 1990 |pmid=2344083 |doi= 10.1016/S0196-0644(05)82472-2|url= |issn=0196-0644}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wallace KL, Suchard JR, Curry SC, Reagan C |title=Diagnostic use of physicians' detection of urine fluorescence in a simulated ingestion of sodium fluorescein-containing antifreeze |journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=49–54 |date=July 2001 |pmid=11423812 |doi=10.1067/mem.2001.115531 |url= |issn=0196-0644}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
Antifreeze products for automotive use containing [[propylene glycol]] in place of ethylene glycol are available, and are generally considered safer to use, as it possesses an unpleasant taste in contrast to the perceived "sweet" taste of toxic ethylene glycol-based coolants, and only produces [[lactic acid]] in an animal's body, as their muscles do when exercised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.resteddoginn.ca/antifreeze.php |title=Ethylene Glycol Poisoning |author=Pieter Klapwijk |date=January 27, 2010 |work= |publisher=The Rested Dog Inn |accessdate=October 11, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126003300/http://www.resteddoginn.ca/antifreeze.php |archivedate=January 26, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=October 2012}}

When using antifreeze products containing ethylene glycol, recommended safety measures include:
* Cleaning up any spill immediately&lt;ref name="ASPCA answers questions"/&gt; and thoroughly. Spills may be cleaned by sprinkling cat litter, sand or other absorbent material directly on the spill.&lt;ref name="Prevent Antifreeze Poisoning"/&gt; Once fully absorbed, while wearing protective gloves, the material may be scooped into a plastic bag, sealed and disposed.&lt;ref name="Prevent Antifreeze Poisoning"/&gt; The spill area may be scrubbed with a stiff brush and warm, soapy water.&lt;ref name="Prevent Antifreeze Poisoning"/&gt; The soapy water is not recommended to be drained in a storm drain.&lt;ref name="Prevent Antifreeze Poisoning"/&gt;
* Checking vehicles regularly for leaks.&lt;ref name="ASPCA answers questions"/&gt;
* Storing antifreeze in clearly marked original sealed containers, in areas that are inaccessible to pets&lt;ref name="ASPCA answers questions"/&gt; or small children.&lt;ref name="Prevent Antifreeze Poisoning"/&gt;
* Keeping pets and small children away from the area when draining the car radiator.&lt;ref name="ASPCA answers questions"/&gt;
* Disposing of used antifreeze only by taking to a service station.&lt;ref name="Prevent Antifreeze Poisoning"/&gt;
* If antifreeze is placed in toilets, ensuring the lid is down and the door closed.&lt;ref name="Washington State University on Antifreeze Poisoning"/&gt;

== Treatment ==

=== Stabilization and decontamination ===
The most important initial treatment for ethylene glycol poisoning is stabilizing the patient. As ethylene glycol is rapidly absorbed, [[gastric]] decontamination is unlikely to be of benefit unless it is performed within 60 minutes of ingestion. Traditionally, [[gastric lavage]] or [[nasogastric aspiration]] of gastric contents are the most common methods employed in ethylene glycol poisoning.&lt;ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/&gt; The usefulness of gastric lavage has, however, been questioned, and it is now no longer used routinely in poisoning situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vale JA, Kulig K |title=Position paper: gastric lavage |journal=Journal of Toxicology: Clinical Toxicology |volume=42 |issue=7 |pages=933–43 |year=2004 |pmid=15641639 |doi=10.1081/CLT-200045006 |url= |issn=0731-3810 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Syrup of ipecac|Ipecac]]-induced [[vomiting]] is not recommended. As [[activated charcoal]] does not [[adsorb]] glycols, it is not recommended as it will not be effective at preventing absorption.&lt;ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/&gt; It is only used in the presence of a toxic dose of another poison or drug.&lt;ref name="Jacobsen"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jacobsen D, McMartin KE |title=Antidotes for methanol and ethylene glycol poisoning |journal=Journal of Toxicology: Clinical Toxicology |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=127–43 |year=1997 |pmid=9120880 |doi=10.3109/15563659709001182 |issn=0731-3810}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients with significant poisoning often present in a [[Medical state|critical condition]]. In this situation [[ABC (medicine)|stabilization]] of the patient including [[airway management]] with [[endotracheal intubation|intubation]] should be performed in preference to gastrointestinal decontamination.&lt;ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/&gt; Patients presenting with metabolic acidosis or seizures require treatment with [[sodium bicarbonate]] and anticonvulsives such as a [[benzodiazepine]] respectively.&lt;ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/&gt; Sodium bicarbonate should be used cautiously as it can worsen [[hypocalcemia]] by increasing the [[plasma protein binding]] of calcium. If hypocalcemia occurs it can be treated with calcium replacement although calcium supplementation can increase the precipitation of calcium oxalate crystals leading to tissue damage.&lt;ref name="Hall TL"/&gt; [[Intubation]] and respiratory support may be required in severely intoxicated patients; patients with [[hypotension]] require treatment with [[intravenous]] fluids and possibly [[vasopressor]]s.&lt;ref name="Brent-2009"/&gt;

=== Antidotes ===
Following decontamination and the institution of supportive measures, the next priority is inhibition of further ethylene glycol metabolism using [[antidote]]s. The antidotes for ethylene glycol poisoning are [[ethanol]] and [[fomepizole]]. This antidotal treatment forms the mainstay of management of ethylene glycol poisoning.  The toxicity of ethylene glycol comes from its metabolism to glycolic acid and oxalic acid.  The goal of pharmacotherapy is to prevent the formation of these metabolites.  Ethanol acts by competing with ethylene glycol for alcohol dehydrogenase, the first enzyme in the degradation pathway.  Because ethanol has a much higher affinity for alcohol dehydrogenase, about a 100-times greater affinity, it successfully blocks the breakdown of ethylene glycol into glycolaldehyde, which prevents the further degradation.  Without oxalic acid formation, the nephrotoxic effects can be avoided, but the ethylene glycol is still present in the body.  It is eventually excreted in the urine, but supportive therapy for the CNS depression and metabolic acidosis will be required until the ethylene glycol concentrations fall below toxic limits.  Pharmaceutical grade ethanol is usually given [[Intravenous therapy|intravenously]] as a 5 or 10% solution in 5% [[dextrose]], but it is also sometimes given orally in the form of a strong spirit such as [[whisky]], [[vodka]], or [[gin]].&lt;ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/&gt;

Fomepizole is a potent inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase; similar to ethanol, it acts to block the formation of the toxic metabolites.&lt;ref name="Hall TL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brent-2009"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brent J |title=Fomepizole for ethylene glycol and methanol poisoning |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=360 |issue=21 |pages=2216–23 |date=May 2009 |pmid=19458366 |doi=10.1056/NEJMct0806112 |issn=0028-4793}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NEJM-Brent"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brent J, McMartin K, Phillips S, Burkhart K, Donovan J, Wells M, Kulig K | title = Fomepizole for the treatment of ethylene glycol poisoning.

Ethanol is readily available in most hospitals, is inexpensive, and can be administered orally as well as intravenously. Its adverse effects include intoxication, [[hypoglycemia]] in children, and possible [[liver]] toxicity.&lt;ref name="Jacobsen"/&gt; Patients receiving ethanol therapy also require frequent blood ethanol concentration measurements and dosage adjustments to maintain a [[Therapeutic index|therapeutic]] ethanol concentration. Patients therefore must be monitored in an [[intensive care unit]]. Alternatively, the adverse [[adverse effect|side effects]] of fomepizole are minimal{{Clarify|date=March 2012}} and the approved dosing regimen maintains therapeutic concentrations without the need to monitor blood concentrations of the drug. The disadvantage of fomepizole is that it is expensive. Costing US$1,000 per gram, an average course used in an adult poisoning would cost approximately $3,500 to $4,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Shannon M |title=Toxicology reviews: fomepizole--a new antidote |journal=Pediatric Emergency Care |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=170–2 |date=April 1998 |pmid=9583406 |doi= 10.1097/00006565-199804000-00021|url= |issn=0749-5161}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Scalley RD, Ferguson DR, Piccaro JC, Smart ML, Archie TE |title=Treatment of ethylene glycol poisoning |journal=American Family Physician|volume=66 |issue=5 |pages=807–12 |date=September 2002 |pmid=12322772 |doi= |url=http://www.aafp.org/link_out?pmid=12322772 |issn=0002-838X |format=Free full text}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the cost, fomepizole is gradually replacing ethanol as the antidote of choice in ethylene glycol poisoning.&lt;ref name="NEJM-Brent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Borron-Lancet"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Borron SW, Mégarbane B, Baud FJ |title=Fomepizole in treatment of uncomplicated ethylene glycol poisoning |journal=The Lancet |volume=354 |issue=9181 |pages=831 |date=September 1999 |pmid=10485727 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(99)80015-4 |url= |issn=0140-6736}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adjunct agents including [[thiamine]] and [[pyridoxine]] are often given, because they may help prevent the formation of oxalic acid.&lt;ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/&gt; The use of these agents is based on theoretical observations and there is limited evidence to support their use in treatment; they may be of particular benefit in people who could be deficient in these vitamins such as malnourished or [[alcoholic]] patients.&lt;ref name="Hall TL"/&gt;

=== Hemodialysis ===
In addition to antidotes, an important treatment for poisoning is the use of [[hemodialysis]]. Hemodialysis is used to enhance the removal of unmetabolized ethylene glycol, as well as its metabolites from the body. It has been shown to be highly effective in the removal of ethylene glycol and its metabolites from the blood.&lt;ref name="Gabow PA, Clay K, Sullivan JB, Lepoff R 1986 16–20"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Moreau CL, Kerns W, Tomaszewski CA, McMartin KE, Rose SR, Ford MD, Brent J |title=Glycolate kinetics and hemodialysis clearance in ethylene glycol poisoning.

Hemodialysis is usually indicated in patients with severe metabolic acidosis (blood [[pH]] less than 7.3), kidney failure, severe [[electrolyte imbalance]], or if the patient's condition is deteriorating despite treatment.&lt;ref name="ClinToxicol1999-Barceloux"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hall TL"/&gt; Often both antidotal treatment and hemodialysis are used together in the treatment of poisoning. Because hemodialysis will also remove the antidotes from the blood, doses of antidotes need to be increased to compensate.&lt;ref name="Drugs2001-Brent"/&gt; If hemodialysis is not available, then [[peritoneal dialysis]] also removes ethylene glycol, although less efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Aakervik O, Svendsen J, Jacobsen D |title=[Severe ethylene glycol poisoning treated with fomepizole (4-methylpyrazole)] |language=Norwegian |journal=Tidsskrift for den Norske lægeforening : tidsskrift for praktisk medicin, ny række |volume=122 |issue=25 |pages=2444–6 |date=October 2002 |pmid=12448112 |doi= |issn=0029-2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prognosis ==
Treatment for antifreeze poisoning needs to be started as soon after ingestion as possible to be effective; the earlier treatment is started, the greater the chance of survival.&lt;ref name="Washington State University on Antifreeze Poisoning"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clinical Chemistry"/&gt; Cats must be treated within 3 hours of ingesting of antifreeze to be effective, while dogs must be treated within 8–12 hours of ingestion.&lt;ref name="Pet poison help line"/&gt; Once kidney failure develops, the prognosis is poor.&lt;ref name="Pet poison help line"/&gt;

Generally, if the patient is treated and survives then a full recovery is expected.&lt;ref name="Leth"/&gt; Patients who present early to medical facilities and have prompt medical treatment typically will have a favorable outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Velez LI, Shepherd G, Lee YC, Keyes DC |title=Ethylene glycol ingestion treated only with fomepizole |journal=Journal of Medical Toxicology |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=125–8 |date=September 2007 |pmid=18072148 |pmc=3550067 |doi=10.1007/BF03160922 |format=PDF |issn=1556-9039 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=Level C |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, patients presenting late with signs and symptoms of coma, hyperkalemia, seizures, or severe acidosis have a poor prognosis.&lt;ref name="Caravati"/&gt; Patients who develop severe central nervous system manifestations or [[stroke]] who survive may have long term neurologic dysfunction; in some cases they may recover, although convalescence may be prolonged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jacobsen D, McMartin KE |title=Methanol and ethylene glycol poisonings.

In an effort to prevent poisoning, often a bittering agent called [[denatonium benzoate]], known by the [[trade name]] [[Bitrex]], is added to ethylene glycol preparations as an adversant to prevent accidental or intentional ingestion.

== History ==
Ethylene glycol was once thought innocuous; in 1931 it was suggested as being suitable for use as a vehicle or solvent for injectable pharmaceutical preparations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors= Hanzlik PJ, Seidenfeld MA, Johnson CC|title= General properties, irritant and toxic actions of ethylene glycol|journal= The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics|volume= 41|issue= 4|pages= 387–406|year= 1931|doi= |url= http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/cgi/reprint/41/4/387|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081013202204/http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/cgi/reprint/41/4/387|archivedate= 2008-10-13|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous cases of poisoning have been reported since then, and it has been shown to be toxic to humans.&lt;ref name="Friedman EA, Greenberg JB, Merrill JP, Dammin GJ 1962 891–902"/&gt;

==Environmental effects==
Ethylene glycol involved in aircraft de-icing and anti-icing operations is released onto land and eventually to waterways.&lt;ref name="Environment Canada on Ethylene Glycol"/&gt; A report prepared for the World Health Organization in 2000 stated that laboratory tests exposing aquatic organisms to stream water receiving runoff from airports have shown toxic effects and death (p.&amp;nbsp;12).&lt;ref name="WHO Report"/&gt; Field studies in the vicinity of an airport have reported toxic signs consistent with ethylene glycol poisoning, fish kills, and reduced biodiversity, although those effects could not definitively be ascribed to ethylene glycol (p.&amp;nbsp;12).&lt;ref name="WHO Report"/&gt; The process of biodegrading of glycols also increases the risk to organisms, as oxygen levels become depleted in surface waters (p.&amp;nbsp;13).&lt;ref name="WHO Report"/&gt; Another study found the toxicity to aquatic and other organisms was relatively low, but the oxygen-depletion effect of biodegradation was more serious (p.&amp;nbsp;245).&lt;ref name="EPA on deicing impacts"/&gt; Further, "Anaerobic biodegradation may also release relatively toxic byproducts such as acetaldehyde, ethanol, acetate, and methane (p. 245)."&lt;ref name="EPA on deicing impacts"/&gt;

In Canada, [[Environment Canada]] reports that "in recent years, management practices at Canada’s major airports have improved with the installation of new ethylene glycol application and mitigation facilities or improvements to existing ones."&lt;ref name="Environment Canada on Ethylene Glycol"/&gt; Since 1994, federal airports must comply with the Glycol Guidelines of the [[Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999|Canadian Environmental Protection Act]], monitoring and reporting on concentrations of glycols in surface water.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ec.gc.ca/lcpe-cepa/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=FD028E79-1 "Glycol Guidelines"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913080539/https://www.ec.gc.ca/lcpe-cepa/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=FD028E79-1 |date=2014-09-13 }}, Government of Canada, Environment Canada, Jan. 20, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Detailed mitigation plans include storage and handling issues (p.&amp;nbsp;27), spill response procedures, and measures taken to reduce volumes of fluid (p.&amp;nbsp;28).&lt;ref name="Canadian glycol mitigation at airports"/&gt; Considering factors such as the "seasonal nature of releases, ambient temperatures, metabolic rates and duration of exposure", [[Environment Canada]] stated in 2014 that "it is proposed that ethylene glycol is not entering the environment in a quantity or concentration or under conditions that have or may have an immediate or long-term harmful effect on the environment or its biological diversity".&lt;ref name="Environment Canada on Ethylene Glycol"/&gt;

In the U.S., airports are required to obtain stormwater discharge permits and ensure that wastes from deicing operations are properly collected and treated.&lt;ref name="US airport deicing"/&gt; Large new airports may be required to collect 60 percent of aircraft [[deicing fluid]] after deicing.&lt;ref name="US airport deicing"/&gt; Airports that discharge the collected aircraft [[deicing fluid]] directly to waters of the U.S. must also meet numeric discharge requirements for chemical oxygen demand.&lt;ref name="US airport deicing"/&gt; A report in 2000 stated that ethylene glycol was becoming less popular for aircraft deicing in the U.S., due to its reporting requirements and adverse environmental impacts (p.&amp;nbsp;213), and noted a shift to the use of propylene glycol (p.&amp;nbsp;I-3).&lt;ref name="EPA on deicing impacts"/&gt;

The '''European Astronaut Centre''' ('''EAC''') (German: Europäisches Astronautenzentrum, French: Centre des astronautes européens), is an establishment of the [[European Space Agency]] and home of the [[European Astronaut Corps]]. It is near to [[Cologne]], [[Germany]], and is subdivided into six separate arms, these being Astronaut Training, Space Medicine, Astronaut Management&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.esa.int/About_Us/EAC/What_we_do|title=What we do|last=esa|newspaper=European Space Agency|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Human Exploration of the Moon as part of the Spaceship EAC initiative&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.esa.int/About_Us/EAC/European_researchers_invited_to_board_Spaceship_EAC|title=European researchers invited to board Spaceship EAC|last=esa|newspaper=European Space Agency|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=European Space Agency on Youtube|title=SpaceShip EAC heading for the Moon|date=2016-02-15|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql566z4CNTY|accessdate=2017-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Communications. It provides training facilities for European and international partner astronauts (including a [[neutral buoyancy pool]]), particularly regarding ESA hardware for the [[International Space Station|ISS]] such as [[Columbus (ISS module)|Columbus]] and formerly the [[Automated Transfer Vehicle|ATV]]. The overall European Astronaut Centre organisation is also in charge of the organisation of the training of European astronauts in the centers of other partners, such as the United States ([[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|NASA Johnson Space Center]]), Russia ([[Star City, Russia|Star City]]), Canada ([[Saint-Hubert, Quebec|Saint-Hubert]]) or Japan ([[Tsukuba, Ibaraki|Tsukuba]]).

The Medical Operations arm (the [[Crew Medical Support Office]]) concentrates on providing health related support to the European astronauts and their families. Astronaut management supports and directs the careers and mission placements of the astronauts, and Education and PR are involved in activities related to education and outreach and the appropriate representation of the European astronauts and their space activities to the public.

The '''Fort de Vaujours''', located in the commune of [[Courtry]], [[Seine-Saint-Denis]], near the town of [[Vaujours]], is one of the forts built at the end of the 19th century to defend [[Paris]].  It became a research center for the [[Commissariat à l'énergie atomique]] (CEA), France's Atomic Energy Commission.  The center was closed in 1997.

==History==
In 1870, France was partly occupied by the [[Prussia|Prussian army]]. As a result of this defeat, the [[Séré de Rivières system]] of fortifications was built from 1874–1881 to defend Paris, consisting of 18 forts, five redoubts and 34 batteries.

Construction started in 1876 on a roughly pentagonal fort with 48 artillery pieces and a garrison of 691 troops. Work was completed in 1882. The fort was updated in 1911 with a machine gun turret and a [[Mougin turret]] with two 155mm guns. The Fort de Vaujours is unique in its association with two annexes connected by a covered way to the main fort.&lt;ref name="fortiffbe0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fortiff.be/iff/index.php?page=10547|title=Vaujours (fort de)|last=Puelinckx|first=Jean |author2=Aublet, Jean-Louis |author3=Mainguin, Sylvie|year=2010|work=Index de la Ligne Maginot|publisher=fortiff.be|language=French|accessdate=6 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fort's barracks were burned in 1944. In 1947 the Sevran explosives works used the facility. From 1955 the site was occupied by the CEA as a research center,&lt;ref name="natact1"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2000|title=Le Centre d'Etudes Atomiques de Vaujours|journal=Nature Actualités|issue=80-81|language=French|url=http://www.asmsn.org/ancien_site/Risq%20ind/Vaujours.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; which considerably modified the fort and its environs. The CEA conducted pyrotechnic experiments at the location, using shock tubes and similar apparatus to study high-pressure shock waves in [[uranium]].&lt;ref name="nwdb5"&gt;{{cite book|last=Norris|first=Robert S.|title=Nuclear Weapons Databook: Vol. V, British, French and Chinese Nuclear Weapons|year=1994|publisher=Westview Press/Natural Resources Defense Council|isbn=0-8133-1612-X|author2=Burrows, Andrew S. |author3=Fieldhouse, Richard W. |page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vaujours facility closed in 1997.  The CEA proposed to sell the property, but concerns about radioactive contamination have stalled the sale.&lt;ref name="dissmedia1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dissident-media.org/infonucleaire/vaujours.html|title=Fort de Vaujours|last=Cordillot|first=Gilles|publisher=le Parisien|language=French|accessdate=6 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The large trapeziodal fort's main armament was a twin 155mm [[Mougin turret]].&lt;ref name="fortiffbe0"/&gt; The turret remains, but its guns have been removed.&lt;ref name="fortiffbe1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fortiff.be/iff/index.php?page=intro10|title=Les tourelles curiassées Mle 1876 du commandant Mougin1|last=Puelinckx|first=Jean |author2=Aublet, Jean-Louis |author3=Mainguin, Sylvie|year=2010|work=Index de la fortification française 1874-1914|publisher=fortiff.be|language=French|accessdate=6 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fortiff1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fortiffsere.fr/index_fichiers/Page1585.htm|title=Implantation des tourelles Mougin|last=Vauborg|first=Cédric|author2=Vauborg, Julie|year=2010|publisher=Fortiff' Séré|language=French|accessdate=6 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Annexes==
Fort de Vaujours' artillery battery annexes are located to the north and south of the main fort, connected by covered ways.  The northern battery was manned by 162 troops with six gun mounts in casemates. The fort formed a rectangle, surrounded by a ditch which lacked the [[caponier]]s of the main fort for its defense. The south annex also has six gun emplacements. The north battery is being demolished while the south battery is in very good state and occupied by an association.&lt;ref name="« fortiffbe2 »"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fortiff.be/iff/index.php?page=1053|title=Vaujours )batteries de)|last=Puelinckx|first=Jean |author2=Aublet, Jean-Louis |author3=Mainguin, Sylvie|year=2010|work=Index de la fortification française 1874-1914|publisher=fortiff.be|language=French|accessdate=6 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Foton''' (or Photon) is the project name of two series of [[Russia]]n science [[satellite]] and [[reentry vehicle]] programs. Although [[Unmanned space mission|unmanned]], the design was adapted from the manned [[Vostok spacecraft]] capsule.  The primary focus of the Foton project is [[materials science]] research, but some missions have also carried experiments for other fields of research including [[biology]].  The original Foton series included 12 launches from the [[Plesetsk Cosmodrome]] from 1985 to 1999.  The second series, under the name '''Foton-M''', incorporates many design improvements over the original Foton, and is still in use.  So far, there have been four launch attempts of the Foton-M.  The first was in 2002 from the [[Plesetsk Cosmodrome]], which [[Foton-M1|ended in failure]] due to a problem in the launch vehicle.  The last three were from the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]], in 2005, 2007, and 2014; all were successful.  Both the Foton and Foton-M series used [[Soyuz-U]] (11A511U and 11A511U2) rockets as launch vehicles. Starting with the Foton-7 mission, the [[European Space Agency]] has been a partner in the Foton program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.spaceflight.esa.int/users/index.cfm?act=default.page&amp;level=11&amp;page=facfoton | title = Foton | publisher = [[ESA]] | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060323090947/http://www.spaceflight.esa.int/users/index.cfm?act=default.page&amp;level=11&amp;page=facfoton | archivedate = 2006-03-23 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foton-M==
'''Foton-M''' is a new generation of [[Russia]]n [[robotic spacecraft]] for research conducted in the [[microgravity]] environment of Earth [[orbit]]. The Foton-M design is based on the design of the [[Foton (space programs)|Foton]], with several improvements including a new [[telemetry]] and [[telecommand]] unit for increased data flow rate, increased [[battery (electricity)|battery]] capacity, and a better thermal control system. It is produced by [[Progress State Research and Production Rocket Space Center|TsSKB-Progress]] in [[Samara, Russia|Samara]].

The first launch, of [[Foton-M No.1|Foton-M1]], failed because of a malfunction of the [[Soyuz-U]] [[launch vehicle|launcher]]. The second launch, of [[Foton-M No.2|Foton-M2]], was, however, a success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMZDJ0DU8E_index_0.html | title = European experiments successfully launched aboard Foton spacecraft | publisher = ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foton-M3 was launched on 14 September 2007 carried by a [[Soyuz-U]] rocket lifting off from the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] in Kazakhstan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMQDB13J6F_index_0.html | title = Lift-off for Foton microgravity mission | publisher = ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Nadezhda (cockroach)|Nadezhda]], a cockroach that was the first earth creature  to produce offspring that had been conceived in space. It returned successfully to Earth on September 26, 2007, landing in [[Kazakhstan]] at 7:58 [[GMT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMFVO6H07F_index_0.html |title=Foton-M3 experiments return to Earth |accessdate= 2007-09-26 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reentry ==
The Foton capsule has limited thruster capability. As such, the reentry path and orientation can not be controlled after the capsule has separated from the engine system. This means that the capsule has to be protected from reentry heat on all sides, thus explaining the spherical design (as opposed to Project Mercury's conical design), which allows for maximum volume while minimizing the external surface. However, the lack of lift means the capsule experiences high forces on reentry, up to 8 to 9g.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2224">A '''functional spinal unit''' (FSU) (or '''motion segment''') is the smallest physiological motion unit of the [[Spinal cord|spine]] to exhibit [[biomechanics|biomechanical]] characteristics similar to those of the entire spine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=White |first1=Augustus A. |last2=Panjabi |first2=Manohar M. |year=1990 |title=Clinical Biomechanics of the Spine |location=Philadelphia |publisher=[[J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co.|Lippincott]] |isbn=0397507208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A FSU consists of two adjacent [[vertebrae]], the [[intervertebral disc]] and all adjoining ligaments between them and excludes other connecting tissues such as muscles. The three-joint complex that results is sometimes referred to as the "articular triad."

[[In vitro]] studies of isolated or multiple FSU's are often used to measure [[biomechanics|biomechanical]] properties of the spine. The typical load-displacement behavior of a cadaveric FSU specimen is nonlinear. Within the total range of passive motion of any FSU, the typical load-displacement curve consists of 2 regions or 'zones' that exhibit very different biomechanical behavior. In the vicinity of the resting neutral position of the FSU, this load-displacement behavior is highly flexible. This is the region known as the 'neutral zone', which is the motion region of the joint where the passive osteoligamentous [[joint stability|stability]] mechanisms exert little or no influence. During passive physiological movement of the FSU, motion occurs in this region against minimal internal resistance. It is a region in which a small load causes a relatively large displacement.The 'elastic zone' is the remaining region of FSU motion that continues from the end of the neutral zone to the point of maximum resistance (provided by the passive osteoligamentous stability mechanism), thus limiting the range of motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Panjabi |first=M.

'''Genetically engineered blood''' is blood that has been modified for therapeutic or other purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Startup Says Engineered Blood Cells Can Deliver Drugs to the Body {{!}} MIT Technology Review|url = http://www.technologyreview.com/news/544281/turning-red-blood-cells-into-versatile-drug-carriers/|website = MIT Technology Review|last=Orcutt |first=Mike  |date=December 9, 2015|accessdate = 2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==

Genetically modifying red blood [[stem cells]] allows them to produce specific therapeutic proteins on the surface or inside the cell. The stem cells are taken from [[mammal]]ian [[bone marrow]] and are modified in culture. Before they become mature, mammalian red blood cells eject their genetic material. Culturing cells that produce a new protein of interest requires only a few weeks. Using the [[sortagging]] [[protein labeling]] technique, the researchers used the [[bacterial enzyme]] [[sortase A]] to establish a strong chemical bond between the surface protein and a substance of choice, such as a small-molecule therapeutic agent or an [[antibody]]. The modifications leave the cells and their surfaces otherwise intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Engineered red blood cells as carriers for systemic delivery of a wide array of functional probes|url = http://www.pnas.org/content/111/28/10131|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date = 2014-07-15|issn = 0027-8424|pmc = 4104923|pmid = 24982154|pages = 10131–10136|volume = 111|issue = 28|doi = 10.1073/pnas.1409861111|language = en|first = Jiahai|last = Shi|first2 = Lenka|last2 = Kundrat|first3 = Novalia|last3 = Pishesha|first4 = Angelina|last4 = Bilate|first5 = Chris|last5 = Theile|first6 = Takeshi|last6 = Maruyama|first7 = Stephanie K.|last7 = Dougan|first8 = Hidde L.|last8 = Ploegh|first9 = Harvey F.|last9 = Lodish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

One application is to engineer [[red blood cells]] into drug-delivery vehicles. Mature red cells carry no genetic material, potentially presenting fewer safety risks than other [[gene therapy|gene]] and [[cell therapies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Home|url = http://www.rubiustx.com/|website = Rubius Therapeutics|accessdate = 2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human red blood cells circulate for as long as four months, meaning they could potentially form the basis of long-term therapies. The cells move throughout body via the [[bloodstream]] and are unnoticed by the [[immune system]].

A '''hierophany''' is a manifestation of the [[sacred]]. The word is a formation of the Greek adjective ''hieros'' ({{lang-gr|ἱερός}}; sacred/holy) and the verb ''phainein'' (φαίνειν; to reveal / to bring to light).

When the sacred is revealed in some form or other to an entity, it brings with it great pleasure and suffering, as one who has become familiar with the [[Divinity|Godhead]] would ascribe. This information can be then used by the recipient to assist others on their own path.

==In Mircea Eliade's writings==
The word ''hierophany'' recurs frequently in the works of the religious historian [[Mircea Eliade]], which he preferred to the more constrictive word ''[[theophany]]'' (an appearance of a god).&lt;ref&gt;''Shamanism'', p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliade argues that religion is based on a sharp distinction between the sacred (God, gods, mythical ancestors, etc.) and the profane.&lt;ref&gt;''Patterns in Comparative Religion'', p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; According to Eliade, for traditional man, myths describe "breakthroughs of the sacred (or the 'supernatural') into the World"—that is, hierophanies.&lt;ref&gt;''Myth and Reality'', p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the hierophanies recorded in myth, the sacred appears in the form of ideal models (the actions and commandments of gods, heroes, etc.). By manifesting itself as an ideal model, the sacred gives the world value, direction, and purpose: "The manifestation of the sacred, ontologically founds the world".&lt;ref&gt;''The Sacred and the Profane'', p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; According to this view, all things need to imitate or conform to the sacred models established by hierophanies, in order to have true reality: to traditional man, things "acquire their reality, their identity, only to the extent of their participation in a transcendent reality".&lt;ref&gt;''Comos and History'', pg. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Plant breeding''' started with [[sedentism|sedentary]] [[agriculture]], particularly the domestication of the first [[agriculture|agricultural]] plants, a practice which is estimated to date back 9,000 to 11,000 years. Initially, early human farmers selected food plants with particular desirable characteristics and used these as a seed source for subsequent generations, resulting in an accumulation of characteristics over time. In time however, experiments began with deliberate hybridization, the science and understanding of which was greatly enhanced by the work of [[Gregor Mendel]]. Mendel's work ultimately led to the new science of [[genetics]]. Modern plant breeding is applied genetics, but its scientific basis is broader, covering [[molecular biology]], [[cell biology|cytology]], [[systematics]], [[physiology]], [[pathology]], [[entomology]], [[chemistry]], and [[statistics]] ([[biometrics]]). It has also developed its own technology. Plant breeding efforts are divided into a number of different historical landmarks.

==Early plant breeding==

===Domestication===
[[Image:Feature2originmap600.png|right|thumb|400px|This map shows the sites of domestication for a number of crops. Places where crops were initially domesticated are called [[centers of origin]]]]
{{main|Domestication}}
{{main|History of agriculture}}

Domestication of plants is an artificial selection process conducted by humans to produce plants that have more desirable traits than wild plants, and which renders them dependent on artificial usually enhanced environments for their continued existence. The practice is estimated to date back 9,000-11,000 years. Many crops in present-day cultivation are the result of domestication in ancient times, about 5,000 years ago in the [[Old World]] and 3,000 years ago in the [[New World]]. In the [[Neolithic]] period, domestication took a minimum of 1,000 years and a maximum of 7,000 years. Today, all principal [[food]] crops come from domesticated varieties. Almost all the domesticated plants used today for food and agriculture were domesticated in the [[centers of origin]]. In these centers there is still a great diversity of closely related wild plants, so-called [[crop wild relatives]], that can also be used for improving modern cultivars by plant breeding.

A plant whose origin or selection is due primarily to intentional human activity is called a [[cultigen]], and a cultivated crop [[species]] that has evolved from [[Wilderness|wild]] populations due to selective pressures from traditional [[farmer]]s is called a [[landrace]]. Landraces, which can be the result of natural forces or domestication, are plants or [[animal]]s that are ideally suited to a particular region or environment. An example are the landraces of [[rice]], ''Oryza sativa'' [[subspecies]] ''indica'', which was developed in [[South Asia]], and ''Oryza sativa'' subspecies ''japonica'', which was developed in [[China]].

For more on the mechanisms of domestication, see [[Hybrid (biology)]].

===Columbian Exchange===
{{main|Columbian exchange}}
{{see also|Economic botany}}
Humans have traded useful plants from distant lands for centuries, and [[plant collecting|plant hunters]] have been sent to bring plants back for cultivation. Human agriculture has had two important results: the plants most favoured by humans came to be grown in many places and (2) gardens and farms have provided some opportunities for plants to interbreed that would not have been possible for their wild ancestors. [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]]'s arrival in America in 1492 triggered unprecedented transfer of plant resources between [[Europe]] and the [[New World]].

==Scientific plant breeding==
[[Image:Gartons-1902-Catalogue.jpg|thumb|right|Garton's catalogue from 1902]]
[[Gregor Mendel]]'s experiments with plant [[hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] led to his [[Mendelian inheritance|laws of inheritance]]. This work became well known in the 1900s and formed the basis of the new science of [[genetics]], which stimulated research by many plant scientists dedicated to improving crop production through plant breeding.

However, successful commercial plant breeding concerns began to be founded from the late 19th century. [[Gartons Agricultural Plant Breeders]] in England was established in the 1890s by John Garton, who was one of the first to cross-pollinate agricultural plants and commercialize the newly created varieties. He began experimenting with the artificial cross pollination firstly of cereal plants, then herbage species and root crops and developed far reaching techniques in plant breeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agri.ankara.edu.tr/fcrops/1289__PBARTSCIENCE.doc|title=Plant breeding}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Obituary, Warrington Examiner, 11 February 1950&lt;/ref&gt;

William Farrer revolutionized wheat farming in Australia with the widespread release in 1903 of the fungus resistant "Federation" strain of wheat, which was developed as a result of his plant breeding work over a period of twenty years using Mendel's theories.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Farrer]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=February 2017}}

From 1904 to World War II in [[Italy]], [[Nazareno Strampelli]] created a number of wheat hybrids. His work allowed Italy to increase crop production during the so-called "[[Battle for Grain]]" (1925–1940) and some varieties were exported to foreign countries, such as Argentina, Mexico, and China. Strampelli's work laid the foundations for [[Norman Borlaug]] and the [[Green Revolution]].

===Green revolution===
{{main|Green Revolution}}
In 1908, [[George Harrison Shull]] described [[heterosis]], also known as hybrid vigor. Heterosis describes the tendency of the progeny of a specific cross to outperform both parents. The detection of the usefulness of heterosis for plant breeding has led to the development of inbred lines that reveal a heterotic yield advantage when they are crossed. [[Maize]] was the first species where heterosis was widely used to produce hybrids.

By the 1920s, [[statistics|statistical]] methods were developed to analyze gene action and distinguish heritable variation from variation caused by environment. In 1933 another important breeding technique, [[cytoplasmic male sterility]] (CMS), developed in maize, was described by [[Marcus Morton Rhoades]]. CMS is a maternally inherited trait that makes the plant produce sterile [[pollen]]. This enables the production of hybrids without the need for labor-intensive [[detasseling]].

These early breeding techniques resulted in large yield increase in the [[United States]] in the early 20th century. Similar yield increases were not produced elsewhere until after [[World War II]], the [[Green Revolution]] increased crop production in the developing world in the 1960s. This remarkable improvement was based on three essential crops. First came the development of hybrid [[maize]], then high-yielding and input-responsive "[[Norin 10 wheat|semi-dwarf wheat]]" (for which the [[CIMMYT]] breeder N.E. [[Borlaug]] received the [[Nobel Peace Prize|Nobel prize for peace]] in 1970), and third came high-yielding "short statured rice" cultivars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kenji Asano |author2=Masanori Yamasaki |author3=Shohei Takuno |author4=Kotaro Miura |author5=Satoshi Katagiri |author6=Tomoko Ito |author7=Kazuyuki Doi |author8=Jianzhong Wu |author9=Kaworu Ebana |author10=Takashi Matsumoto |author11=Hideki Innan |author12=Hidemi Kitano |author13=Motoyuki Ashikari |author14=Makoto Matsuoka |year= 2011|title=Artificial selection for a green revolution gene during japonica rice domestication|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=108|issue=27|pages=11034–11039|pmid=21646530|doi=10.1073/pnas.1019490108|pmc=3131315}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly notable improvements were achieved in other crops like [[sorghum]] and [[alfalfa]].

===Molecular genetics and bio-revolution===
Intensive research in [[molecular genetics]] has led to the development of recombinant [[DNA]] technology (popularly called [[genetic engineering]]). Advancement in biotechnological techniques has opened many possibilities for [[plant breeding|breeding]] crops. Thus, while mendelian genetics allowed plant breeders to perform genetic transformations in a few crops, molecular genetics has provided the key to both the manipulation of the internal genetic structure, and the "crafting" of new cultivars according to a pre-determined plan.

'''Host–parasite coevolution''' is a special case of [[coevolution]], the reciprocal adaptive [[genetics|genetic]] change of a [[Host (biology)|host]] and a [[parasite]] through reciprocal [[Evolutionary pressure|selective pressure]]s.

It is characterized by reciprocal genetic change and thus changes in [[allele]] frequencies within populations. These are determined by three main types of selection dynamics: negative [[frequency-dependent selection]] when a rare allele has a selective advantage; overdominance caused by [[heterozygote advantage]]; and directional [[selective sweep]]s near an advantageous mutation.

Theories of host–parasite coevolution include the geographic mosaic theory, which assumes a selection mosaic, coevolutionary hotspots, and geographic mixing; the [[Red Queen hypothesis]], which proposes that parasitism favours [[sexual reproduction]] in the host; and an [[evolutionary trade-off]] between transmission and virulence, since if the parasite kills its host too quickly, the parasite will not be able to reproduce.

[[Model organism|Model system]]s include the nematode ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' with the bacterium ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]''; the crustacean ''[[Daphnia]]'' and its numerous parasites; and ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' and the mammals (including humans) whose intestines it inhabits.

==Overview==
[[Host (biology)|Hosts]] and [[parasitism|parasites]] exert reciprocal [[natural selection|selective pressures]] on each other, which may lead to rapid reciprocal [[adaptation]]. For organisms with short generation times, host–parasite coevolution can be observed in comparatively small time periods, making it possible to study evolutionary change in real-time under both field and laboratory conditions. These interactions may thus serve as a counter-example to the common notion that evolution can only be detected across extended time.&lt;ref name="Woolhouse"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/ng1202-569 |last1=Woolhouse |first1=M. E. J. |last2=Webster |first2=J. P. |last3=Domingo |first3=E. |last4=Charlesworth |first4=B. |last5=Levin |first5=B. R. |title=Biological and biomedical implications of the coevolution of pathogens and their hosts |journal=[[Nature Genetics]] |date=December 2002 |pmid=12457190 |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=569–77 |url=http://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/1842/689/2/Charlesworth_Woolhouse.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dynamics of these interactions are summarized in the [[Red Queen hypothesis]], namely that both host and parasite have to change continuously to keep up with each other's adaptations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/sciadv.1501548 |last=Rabajante |first=J. |title=Host-parasite Red Queen dynamics with phase-locked rare genotypes |journal=[[Science Advances]] |year=2016 |volume=2 |pages=e1501548 |url=http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/3/e1501548 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Host–parasite coevolution is ubiquitous and of potential importance to all living organisms, including humans, domesticated animals and crops. Major diseases such as [[malaria]], [[AIDS]] and [[influenza]] are caused by coevolving parasites. Better understanding of coevolutionary adaptations between parasite attack strategies and host [[immune system]]s may assist in the development of novel medications and vaccines.&lt;ref name="Woolhouse"/&gt;

==Selection dynamics==
Host–parasite coevolution is characterized by reciprocal genetic change and thus changes in [[allele]] frequencies within populations. These changes may be determined by three main types of selection dynamics.&lt;ref name=Ebert/&gt;&lt;ref name=Woolhouse/&gt;

===Negative frequency dependent selection===
[[File:Negative Frequencie Dependant Selection.jpg|right|300px]]

An allele is subject to negative [[frequency dependent selection]] if a rare allelic variant has a selective advantage. For example, the parasite should adapt to the most common host [[genotype]], because it can then infect a large number of hosts. In turn, a rare host genotype may then be favored by selection, its frequency will increase and eventually it becomes common. Subsequently, the parasite should adapt to the former infrequent genotype.&lt;ref name="Ebert"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.mib.2008.05.012 |last=Ebert |first=D. |title=Host–parasite coevolution: Insights from the Daphnia–parasite model system |journal=[[Current Opinion in Microbiology]] |year=2008 |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=290–301 |pmid=18556238}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/srep10004 |last=Rabajante |first=J. |title=Red Queen dynamics in multi-host and multi-parasite interaction system |journal=[[Scientific Reports]] |year=2015 |volume=5 |pages=10004 |pmid=25899168 |url=http://www.nature.com/srep/2015/150422/srep10004/full/srep10004.html |display-authors=etal |pmc=4405699}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coevolution determined by negative frequency dependent selection is rapid, potentially occurring across few generations.&lt;ref name=Ebert /&gt; It maintains high genetic diversity by favoring uncommon alleles. This selection mode is expected for multicellular hosts, because adaptations can occur without the need for novel advantageous [[mutations]], which are less likely to be frequent in these hosts because of relatively small population sizes and relatively long generation times.&lt;ref name=Ebert /&gt;

===Overdominant selection===

[[Overdominance]] occurs if the [[heterozygote]] [[phenotype]] has a fitness advantage over both [[homozygotes]] ([[heterozygote advantage]], causing [[heterosis]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Charlesworth, D.; Willis, J. H. |title=The genetics of inbreeding depression |journal=Nat. Rev. Genet. |volume=10 |issue=11 |pages=783–96 |date=November 2009 |pmid=19834483 |doi=10.1038/nrg2664 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Carr&gt;{{cite journal |author=Carr, D. E.; Dudash, M. R. |title=Recent approaches into the genetic basis of inbreeding depression in plants |journal=Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. |volume=358 |issue=1434 |pages=1071–84 |date=June 2003 |pmid=12831473 |pmc=1693197 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2003.1295 |url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12831473}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example is [[sickle cell anemia]]. It is due to a [[mutation]] in the [[hemoglobin]] gene leading to sickle shape formation of red blood cells, causing clotting in blood vessels, restricted blood flow, and reduced oxygen transport. At the same time, the mutation confers resistance to [[malaria]], caused by ''[[Plasmodium]]'' parasites, which are passed off in red blood cells after transmission to humans by [[mosquitoes]]. Hence, homozygote and heterozygote genotypes for the sickle-cell disease allele show malaria resistance, while the homozygote suffers from severe disease phenotype. The alternative homozygote, which does not carry the sickle cell disease allele, is susceptible to infection by ''Plasmodium''. As a consequence, the heterozygote genotype is selectively favored in areas with a high incidence of malaria.&lt;ref name=NIH2015What&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is Sickle Cell Disease?|url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/sca|website=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute|accessdate=8 March 2016|date=June 12, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306021706/http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/sca/|archivedate=6 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wellems TE, Hayton K, Fairhurst RM | title = The impact of malaria parasitism: from corpuscles to communities | journal = J.

===Directional selection===
[[File:Selective Sweeps.jpg |right|300px]]
If an allele provides a fitness benefit, its frequency will increase within a population – selection is directional or positive. [[Selective sweeps]] are one form of directional selection, where the increase in frequency will eventually lead to the fixation of the advantageous allele. The process is considered to be slower in comparison to negative frequency dependent selection. It may produce an "arms race", consisting of the repeated origin and fixation of new parasite virulence and host defence traits.&lt;ref name=Woolhouse/&gt;

This mode of selection is likely to occur in interactions between unicellular organisms and viruses due to large population sizes, short generation times, often haploid genomes and horizontal gene transfer, which increase the probability of beneficial mutations arising and spreading through populations.&lt;ref name=Ebert/&gt;

==Theories==
[[File:Geographic MOSAIC MODEL of Coevolution.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3]]

===Geographic mosaic theory of coevolution===

John N. Thompson's geographic mosaic theory of coevolution hypothesizes spatially divergent coevolutionary selection, producing genetic differentiation across populations.&lt;ref name=Laine&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/jxb/erp168 |last=Laine |first=Anna-Liisa |title=Role of coevolution in generating biological diversity - spatially divergent selection trajectories |journal=Journal of Experimental Botany |date=July 2009 |volume=60 |issue=11 |pages=2957–2970 |pmid=19528527 |url=http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/60/11/2957}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model assumes three elements that jointly fuel coevolution:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The John N Thompson Lab|url=https://thompsonlab.sites.ucsc.edu/|publisher=University of California Santa Cruz|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=John N. |title=The Geographic Mosaic of Coevolution (Interspecific Interactions) |year=2005 |publisher=[[University Of Chicago Press]] |isbn=978-0-226-79762-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/303208 |last=Thompson |first=John N. |title=Specific Hypotheses on the Geographic Mosaic of Coevolution |year=1999 |journal=[[The American Naturalist]] |volume=153 |pages=S1–S14 |url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/303208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Plantago lanceolata NRM.jpg |thumb |upright |''[[Plantago lanceolata]]'']]

1) a selection mosaic among populations
::[[Natural selection]] on interspecific interactions differs among populations. Thus genotype-by-genotype-by-environment (G x G x E) interactions affect fitness of the antagonists. In other words, the specific environmental conditions determine how any genotype of one species influences the fitness of another species.
2) coevolutionary hotspots
::Coevolutionary hotspots are communities in which selection on the interaction is truly reciprocal. These hotspots are intermixed with so-called coldspots in which only one or neither species adapts to the antagonist.
3) geographic mixing of traits
::Between the communities/regions there is a continuous "mixing" of traits by [[gene flow]], [[random genetic drift]], population [[extinction]], or [[mutation]]. This remixing determines the exact dynamics of the geographic mosaic by shifting the spatial distributions of potentially coevolving [[allele]]s and traits.

Among plants, ''[[Plantago lanceolata]]'' and its parasite the [[powdery mildew]] ''Podosphaera plantaginis'' have been intensively studied on the [[Aland islands]] in south-western Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Soubeyrand, S. |author2=Laine, A.-L. |author3=Hanski, I. |author4=Penttinen, A. |year=2009 |title=Spatio-temporal structure of host-pathogen interactions in a metapopulation |url =http://www.helsinki.fi/~allaine/pdfs/603624.pdf |journal=The American Naturalist |volume=174 |issue=3 |pages=308–320 |pmid=19627233 |doi=10.1086/603624 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''P. plantaginis'' obtains nutrients from its host, a perennial herb, by sending feeding roots into the plant. There are more than 3000 host populations in this region, where both populations can evolve freely, in absence of human-imposed selection, in a heterogeneous landscape. Both partners can reproduce asexually or sexually. The system has spatially divergent coevolutionary dynamics across two [[metapopulations]] as predicted by the mosaic theory.&lt;ref&gt;Laine A.-L.

===Red Queen hypothesis===
[[File:P antipodarum.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Potamopyrgus antipodarum]]'' tends to [[sexual reproduction|reproduce sexually]] when in the presence of [[trematode]] parasites.]]

The New Zealand freshwater snail ''[[Potamopyrgus antipodarum]]'' and its different [[trematode]] parasites represent a rather special model system. Populations of ''P. antipodarum'' consist of asexual clones and sexual individuals and therefore can be used to study the evolution and advantages of [[sexual reproduction]]. There is a high correlation between the presence of parasites and the frequency of sexual individuals within the different populations. This result is consistent with the [[Red Queen hypothesis]] that sexual reproduction is favoured during host–parasite coevolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jokela |first=Jukka |author2=Liveley, Curtis M. |author3=Dydahl, Mark F. |author4= Fox, Jennifer A. |title=Genetic variation in sexual and clonal lineages of a freshwater snail |journal=[[Biological Journal of the Linnean Society]] |date=7 May 2003 |volume=79 |issue=1 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118833480/abstract |pages=165–181 |doi=10.1046/j.1095-8312.2003.00181.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the persistence of sex may also rely on other factors, for example [[Muller's ratchet]] and/or the avoidance of the accumulation of deleterious mutations.

===Trade-off between transmission and virulence===
[[File:Tribolium castaneum.jpg |left |thumb |''[[Tribolium castaneum]]'']]

''[[Tribolium castaneum]]'', the red flour beetle, is a host for the [[microsporidia]]n ''Nosema whitei''. This parasitoid kills its host for transmission, so the host's lifespan is important for the parasite's success. In turn, parasite fitness most likely depends on a trade-off between transmission (spore load) and [[virulence]].&lt;ref name="Bérénos"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bérénos |first=C. |author2=Schmid-Hempel, P. |author3=Wegner, K. M. |title=Evolution of host resistance and trade-offs between virulence and transmission potential in an obligately killing parasite |journal=[[Journal of Evolutionary Biology]] |date=October 2009 |volume=22 |issue=10 |pages=2049–56 |doi=10.1111/j.1420-9101.2009.01821.x |pmid=19732263}}&lt;/ref&gt; A higher virulence would increase the potential for the production of more offspring, but a higher spore load would affect the host's lifespan and therefore the transmission rate. This trade-off is supported by coevolutionary experiments, which revealed the decrease of virulence, a constant transmission potential and an increase in the host's lifespan over a period of time.&lt;ref name="Bérénos" /&gt;
Further experiments demonstrated a higher recombination rate in the host during coevolutionary interactions, which may be selectively advantageous because it should increase diversity of host genotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fischer |first1=O. |last2=Schmid-Hempel |first2=P. |year=2005 |title=Selection by parasites may increase host recombination frequency |url= |journal=Biology Letters |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=193–195 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2005.0296|pmc=1626206 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Resources are generally limited. Therefore, investment in one trait (e.g. [[virulence]] or [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]]) limits investment in other life-history traits (e.g. reproductive rate). Moreover, genes are often [[pleiotropic]], having multiple effects. Thus, a change in a pleiotropic immunity or virulence gene can automatically affect other traits. There is thus a trade-off between benefits and costs of the adaptive changes that may prevent the host population from becoming fully resistant or the parasite population from being highly pathogenic. The costs of gene pleiotropy have been investigated in coevolving ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' and [[bacteriophages]]. To inject their genetic material, phages need to bind to a specific bacterial cell surface receptor. The bacterium may prevent injection by altering the relevant binding site, e.g. in response to point mutations or deletion of the receptor. However, these receptors have important functions in bacterial metabolism. Their loss would thus decrease fitness (i.e. population growth rate). As a consequence, there is a trade-off between the advantages and disadvantages of a mutated receptor, leading to [[Polymorphism (biology)#Genetics|polymorphism]] at this locus.&lt;ref name="Bohannan"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bohannan |first= B.

==Model systems for research==
[[File:Adult Caenorhabditis elegans.jpg|thumb|''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'']] 
 
The nematode ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' and the bacterium ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'' were only recently established as a [[model organism|model system]] for studying host–parasite coevolution. Laboratory evolution experiments provided evidence for many of the basic predictions of these coevolutionary interactions, including reciprocal genetic change, and increases in the rate of evolution and genetic diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schulte |first=R. D. |author2=Makus, C. |author3=Hasert, B. |author4=Michiels, N.

[[File:Daphnia fg01.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Daphnia magna]]'']]

The crustacean ''[[Daphnia]]'' and its numerous parasites have become one of the main model systems for studying coevolution. 
The host can be asexual as well as sexual (induced by changes in the external environment), so sexual reproduction can be stimulated in the laboratory.&lt;ref name=Ebert /&gt; Decades of coevolution between ''[[Daphnia magna]]'' and the bacterium ''Pasteuria ramosa'' have been reconstructed, reanimating resting stages of both species from laminated pond sediments and exposing hosts from each layer to parasites from the past, the same and the future layers. The study demonstrated that parasites were on average most infective with their contemporary hosts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Decaestecker |first=E. |author2=Gaba, S. |author3=Raeymaekers, J.

[[File:EscherichiaColi NIAID.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Escherichia coli]]'']]

''[[Escherichia coli]]'', a [[Gram-negative]] [[proteobacterium]], is a common model in biological research, for which comprehensive data on various aspects of its life-history is available. It has been used extensively for [[evolution]] experiments, including those related to [[coevolution]] with phages.&lt;ref name=Bohannan /&gt; These studies revealed – among others – that coevolutionary [[adaptation]] may be influenced by [[pleiotropic]] effects of the involved [[genes]]. In particular, binding of the [[bacteriophage]] to ''E. coli'' surface [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] is the crucial step in the [[virus]] [[infection]] cycle. A [[mutation]] in the receptor's binding site may cause [[Antibiotic resistance|resistance]]. Such mutations often show pleiotropic effects and may cause a cost of resistance. In the presence of phages, such pleiotropy may lead to [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphisms]] in the bacterial population and thus enhance [[biodiversity]] in the community.&lt;ref name=Bohannan /&gt;

Another model system consists of the plant- and animal-colonizing bacterium ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' and its [[bacteriophages]]. This system provided new insights into the dynamics of coevolutionary change. It demonstrated that coevolution may proceed via recurrent [[selective sweeps]], favouring [[generalist and specialist species|generalists]] for both antagonists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Buckling |first1=A. |last2=Rainey |first2=P.

Tropical tree and liana interactions have also been the subject of study. Here lianas have been viewed as hyper-diverse generalist macro-parasites that affect host survival by parasitising on the host's structural support for access to canopy light, while usurping resources that would otherwise be available to their host. Host trees have widely varying levels of tolerance to infestation of their crowns by lianas. &lt;ref name="VisserMuller-Landau2018"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Visser |first1=Marco D.|last2=Muller-Landau |first2=Helene C. |last3=Schnitzer |first3=Stefan A. |last4=de Kroon |first4=Hans |last5=Jongejans |first5=Eelke |last6=Wright |first6=S.

'''Hydroids''' are a [[biological life cycle|life stage]] for most animals of the class [[Hydrozoa]], small predators related to [[jellyfish]]. Some hydroids such as the freshwater ''[[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]]'' are solitary, with the [[polyp]] attached directly to the [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]]. When these produce buds, they become detached and grow on as new individuals.

[[File:PSM V08 D028 Diagram of a section of hydroid.jpg|thumb|left|Section through a hydroid]]

The majority of hydroids are [[colony (biology)|colonial]]. The original polyp is anchored to a solid [[substrate (biology)|substrate]] and forms a bud which remains attached to its parent. This in turn buds and in this way a stem is formed. The arrangement of polyps and the branching of the stem is characteristic of the species.

Some species have the polyps budding directly off the [[stolon]] which roots the colony. The polyps are connected by [[epidermis (zoology)|epidermis]] which surrounds a gastrovascular cavity. The epidermis secretes a [[chitin]]ous skeleton which supports the stem and in some hydroids, the skeleton extends into a cup shape surrounding the polyp.

Most of the polyps are [[gastrozooid]]s or feeding polyps, but some are specialised reproductive structures known as [[gonozooid]]s. In some species, further specialised [[zooid]]s are formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Zoology |last1=Dorit |first1=R. L. |last2=Walker |first2=W. F. |last3=Barnes |first3=R.

In classical architecture, '''Hypaethral''' describes an ancient [[temple]] with no roof. (From the Latin ''hypaethrus'', from Ancient Greek ὕπαιθρος ''hupaithros'' ὑπό hupo- "under" and αἰθήρ aither "sky, air".) It was described by the Roman architect [[Vitruvius]] in his treatise [[De architectura|''On Architecture'']], written for the emperor [[Caesar Augustus]] probably about 15 BC.

==Overview==
Hypaethral is in  contradistinction to [[cleithral]], a term applied to a covered temple.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drbilllong.com/2006Words/Hypaethral.html Hypaethral and Roofless Structures]. DrBillong.com. Accessed June 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Hypaethros'' or ''hypaethral opening'' is the term [[Vitruvius]] (iii. 2) used for the opening in the middle of the roof of [[temple]]s, an example being found in [[Athens]] in the [[temple of Jupiter Olympius]], which is [[octastyle]]. There was no example in [[Rome]].

However, at the time Vitruvius wrote (c. 25 AD) the ''[[cella]]'' of this temple was unroofed, because the columns which had been provided to carry, at all events, part of the ceiling and roof had been taken away by [[Sulla]] in 80 BC. The decastyle [[temple of Apollo Didymaeus]] near [[Miletus]] was, according to [[Strabo]] (c. 50 BC), unroofed, on account of the vastness of its cella, in which precious groves of [[Lauraceae|laurel]] bushes were planted.

[[File:Temple of Aphaia in February 2005 14.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Temple of Aphaea]]  on the Greek island of Aegina]]
Apart from these two examples, the references in various writers to an opening of some kind in the roofs of temples dedicated to particular deities, and the statement of Vitruvius, which was doubtless based on the writings of Greek authors, that in decastyle or large temples the centre was open to the sky and without a roof (''medium autem sub diva est sine tecto''), render the existence of the hypaethros probable in some cases; and therefore [[C. R. Cockerell]]'s discovery in the temple at [[Aegina]] of two fragments of a coping-stone, in which there were sinkings on one side to receive the tiles and covering tiles, has been of great importance in the discussion of this subject. In the conjectural restoration of the ''opaion'' or opening in the roof shown in Cockerell's drawing, it has been made needlessly large, having an area of about one quarter of the superficial area of the cella between the columns, and since in the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] at Rome the relative proportions of the central opening in the dome and the area of the rotunda are 1:22, and the light there is ample, in the clearer atmosphere of Greece it might have been less. The larger the opening, the more conspicuous would be the notch in the roof which is so greatly objected to; in this respect, [[Jacques Hittorf]] would seem to be nearer the truth when, in his conjectural restoration of [[Temple R]] at [[Selinus]], he shows an ''opaion'' about half the relative size shown in Cockerell's of that at Aegina, the coping on the side elevation being much less noticeable.

[[File:1972 bassai temple.jpg|thumb|Temple of Apollo Epikourios at Bassae (Greece)]]
The problem was apparently solved in another way at [[Bassae]], where, in the excavations of the [[Temple of Apollo at Bassae|temple of Apollo]] by Cockerell and [[Baron Hailer von Hallerstein]], three marble tiles were found with pierced openings in them about 18 inches by 10 in.; five of these pierced tiles on either side would have amply lighted the interior of the cella, and the amount of rain passing through (a serious element to be considered in a country where torrential rains occasionally fall) would not be very great or more than could be retained to dry up in the ceila sunk pavement. In favor of both these methods of lighting, the interior of the cella, the sarcophagus tomb at [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]], about {{convert|20|ft|m}} long, carved in imitation of a temple, has been adduced, because, on the tor of the roof and in its centre, there is a raised coping, and a similar feature is found on a tomb found near [[Delos]]; an example from [[Crete]] now in the [[British Museum]] shows a pierced tile on each side of the roof, and a large number of pierced tiles have been found in [[Pompeii]], some of them surrounded with a rim identical with that of the marble tiles at Bassae.

On the other hand, there are many authorities, among them [[Wilhelm Dörpfeld]], who have adhered to their original opinion that it was only through the open doorway that light was ever admitted into the celia, and with the clear atmosphere of Greece and the reflections from the marble pavement, such lighting would be quite sufficient. There remains still another source of light to be considered, that passing through the Parian marble tiles of the roof; the superior translucency of Parian to any other marble may have suggested its employment for the roofs of temples, and if, in the framed ceilings carried over the celia, openings were left, some light from the Parian tile roof might have been obtained. It is possibly to this that [[Plutarch]] refers when describing the ceiling and roof of the temple of [[Demeter]] at [[Eleusis]], where the columns in the interior of the temple carried a ceiling, probably constructed of timbers crossing one another at right angles, and one or more of the spaces was left open, which [[Xenocles]] surmounted by a roof formed of tiles.

[[File:PSM V31 D010 James Fergusson.png|thumb|left|James Fergusson]]
In his 1849 ''Historical Inquiry into the True Principles of Beauty in Art: More Especially with Reference to Architecture'' 
[[James Fergusson (architect)|James Fergusson]] put forward a conjectural restoration in which he adopted a [[clerestory]] above the superimposed columns inside the cella; in order to provide the light for these windows, he indicated two trenches in the roof, one on each side, and pointed out that the great [[Great Hypostyle Hall, Karnak|Hall of Columns]] at [[Karnak]] was lighted in this way with clerestory windows; but in the first place the light in the latter was obtained over the flat roofs covering lower portions of the hail, and in the second place, as it rarely rains in Egyptian [[Thebes (Egypt)|Thebes]], there could be no difficulty about the drainage, while in Greece, with the torrential rains and snow, these trenches would be deluged with water, and with all the appliances of the present day it would be impossible to keep these clerestory windows watertight. There is, however, still another objection to Fergusson's theory: the water collecting in these trenches on the roof would have to be discharged, for which Fergusson's suggestions are quite inadequate, and the [[gargoyle]]s shown in the celia wall would make the [[peristyle]] insupportable just at the time when it was required for shelter.

No drainage otherwise of any kind has ever been found in any [[Greek temple]], which is fatal to Fergusson's view. Nor is it in accordance with the definition open to the sky. English cathedrals and churches are all lighted by clemstory windows, but no one has described them as open to the sky, and although Vitruvius's statements are sometimes confusing, his description is far too clear to leave any misunderstanding as to the lighting of temples (where it was necessary on account of great length) through an opening in the roof.

There is one other theory which has been put forward, but which can only apply to non-peristylar temples, that light and air were admitted through the [[metope (architecture)|metopes]], the apertures between the beams crossing the cella, and it has been assumed that because [[Orestes]] was advised in one of the Greek plays to climb up and look through the metopes of the temple, these were left open; but if Orestes could look in, so could the birds, and the statue of the god would be defiled. The metopes were probably filled in with shutters of some kind, which Orestes knew how to open.

The '''International Centre for Geohazards (ICG)''' is a Norwegian, multidisciplinary research and educational institute, hosted at the [[Norwegian Geotechnical Institute]] (NGI). According to the institute's website,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geohazards.no International Centre for Geohazards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302114513/http://www.geohazards.no/ |date=2008-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ICG's research activities focus on the assessment, prevention and mitigation of [[geohazard]]s, in which the latter is defined as ''a geological state that represents or has the potential to develop further in a situation leading to damage or uncontrolled risk''. From this definition, it becomes clear that geohazards are widespread, both spatially and temporally, and are always related to geological conditions and processes in both offshore, coastal and onshore environments.

The International Centre for Geohazards was established in 2002, and is a collaboration between the [[Norwegian Geotechnical Institute]], [[NORSAR]], the [[University of Oslo]], and the [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]] in Trondheim.

Angular size of patch in atmosphere over which electromagnetic waves in the same plane stay parallel.  The patch size inversely affects the [[Fried_parameter|Fried Parameter]] and the resolution of optical telescopes.  Adaptive [[optical telescope|optical telescopes]] uses a bright light source to identify the properties of the patch in the line of sight to the object of interest to correct for seeing effects.

Each layer of platelets is oriented in a different direction, giving the resulting object greater strength. The inventors claimed that the process is 10x faster than commercial [[3D printing]]. The magnetisation and orientation of the ceramic platelets has been patented.&lt;ref name=zme&gt;{{Cite web|title = Artificial tooth is as good as the real deal|url = http://www.zmescience.com/medicine/magnetic-casting-artificial-enamel-827834/|accessdate = 2015-09-29 |date= September 29, 2015 |first=Alexandru |last=Micu |publisher=ZME}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technique ==

The technique involves pouring a suspension of magnetized ceramic micro-plates. Pores in the plaster mold absorb the liquid from the suspension, solidifying the material from the outside in. The particles are subjected to a strong [[magnetic field]] as they solidify that causes them to align in one direction. The field’s orientation is changed at regular intervals, moving the plates still in suspension, without disturbing already-solidified plates. By varying the composition of the suspension and the direction of the platelets, a continuous process can produce multiple layers with differing material properties in a single object. The resulting objects can closely imitate their natural models.&lt;ref name=zme/&gt;

== Artificial tooth ==

Researchers produced an artificial tooth whose microstructure mimicked that of a real tooth. The outer layers, corresponding to enamel, were hard and structurally complex. The outer layers contained glass [[nanoparticles]] and [[aluminium oxide]] plates were aligned perpendicular to the surface. After the outer layers hardened, a second suspension was poured. It contained no glass, and the plates were aligned horizontally to the surface of the tooth.  These deeper layers were tougher, resembling [[dentine]]. The tooth was then cooked at 1,600 degrees to compact and harden the material — a process known as [[sintering]]. The last step involved filling remaining pores with a synthetic [[monomer]] used in [[dentistry]], which [[polymerizes]] after treatment.&lt;ref name=zme/&gt; Hardness and durability approximated that of both the enamel and dentine of a tooth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Creating Fake Teeth as Strong as the Real Deal|url = http://www.rdmag.com/articles/2015/09/creating-fake-teeth-strong-real-deal|date=September 29, 2015 |first=Greg |last=Watry,|accessdate = 2015-09-29 |publisher=R&amp;D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5640">'''Moisture stress''' occurs when the water in a plant's cells is reduced to less than normal levels.  This can occur because of a lack of water in the plant's root zone, higher rates of [[transpiration]] than the rate of moisture uptake by the roots, for example, because of an inability to absorb water due to a high [[salt]] content in the soil water or loss of roots due to transplantation. Moisture stress is more strongly related to [[water potential]] than it is to [[water content]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.155.3767.1248

Moisture stress also has an effect on [[stoma]]tal openings of a plant, mainly causing a closure in stomata as to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide [[Carbon fixation|assimilation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=    16662343 | volume=69 | issue=5 | title=Leaf water potential, stomatal resistance, and photosynthetic response to water stress in peach seedlings | pmc=426357 | year=1982 | journal=Plant Physiol. | pages=1051–4 | last1 = Hand | first1 = JM | last2 = Young | first2 = E | last3 = Vasconcelos | first3 = AC | doi=10.1104/pp.69.5.1051}}&lt;/ref&gt; Closing of the stomata also slows the rate of transpiration, which limits water loss and helps to prevent the [[wilting]] effects of moisture stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Biological Science: Fifth Edition|last=Freeman|first=Scott|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc.|year=2014|isbn=978-0-321-74367-1|location=USA|pages=765}}&lt;/ref&gt; This closing can be trigged by the roots sensing dry soil and in response producing the hormone ABA which when transported up the xylem into the leaves will reduce [[stomatal conductance]] and wall extensibility of growing cells.  This lowers the rates of transpiration, photosynthesis and leaf expansion. ABA also increases the loosening of growing root cell walls and in turn increases root growth in an effort to find water in the soil.&lt;ref&gt;Lambers, Hans; Chapin II, F. Stuart; Pons, Thijs L. (2008). Plant physiological Ecology. New York, NY: Springer. p. 349. {{ISBN|978-0-387-78340-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Phenotypic response of plants to long-term water stress was measured in corn and showed that plants respond to water stress with both an increase in root growth both laterally and vertically. In all Droughted conditions the corn showed decrease in plant height and yield due to the decrease in water availability.&lt;ref&gt;Weaver, J.E. (1926) Root Development of Field Crops. McGraw Hill, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

Genes induced during water-stress conditions are thought to function not only in protecting cells from water deficit by the production of important metabolic proteins but also in the regulation of genes for signal transduction in the water-stress response. There are four pathways that have been described that show the plants genetic response to moisture stress; two are ABA dependent while two are ABA independent. They all affect gene expression that increases the plants water stress tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shinozaki | first1 = K. | last2 = Yamaguchi-Shinozaki | first2 = K. | year = 1997 | title = Gene Expression and Signal Transduction in Water-Stress Response | url = | journal = Plant Physiology | volume = 115 | issue = 2| pages = 327–334 | doi=10.1104/pp.115.2.327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of moisture stress on photosynthesis can depend as much on the velocity and degree of photosynthetic recovery, as it depends on the degree and velocity of photosynthesis decline during water depletion. Plants that are subjected to mild stress can recover in 1–2 days however, plants subjected to severe water stress will only recover 40-60% of its maximum photosynthetic rates the day after re watering and may never reach maximum photosynthetic rates. The recovery from moisture stress starts with an increase in water content in leaves reopening the stomata then the synthesis of photosynthetic proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chaves|first=M.

The '''Nereus Program''' is a global interdisciplinary initiative between the [[Nippon Foundation]] and the [[University of British Columbia]] that was created to further our knowledge of how best to attain sustainability for our world’s oceans.&lt;ref&gt;http://oceans.ubc.ca/research/&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the Nippon Foundation and UBC, the program partners with [[University of Cambridge]], [[Duke University]], [[Princeton University]], [[Stockholm University]], United Nations Environment Program-[[World Conservation Monitoring Centre]] and [[Utrecht University]]. The program is built around three core objectives: to conduct collaborative ocean research across the natural and social sciences, to develop an interdisciplinary network of experts that can engage in discussion of complex and multifaceted questions of ocean sustainability, and to transfer these ideas to practical solutions in global policy forums.

==Program leadership==
* '''[[Yoshitaka Ota]]''' is Director (Policy) of the NF-UBC Nereus Program. He is a Research Assistant Professor for the School of Marine and Environmental Affairs at the University of Washington. His main research is anthropology of fishing, assessing current global outlook of indigenous fishing and coastal food security. He also works on ocean governance and policy, marine spatial planning and knowledge communication.
* '''[[William Cheung (Scientist)|William Cheung]]''' is Director (Science) of the NF-UBC Nereus Program and the Principal Investigator of the UBC Nereus Research group since 2014. He is also an Associate Professor at the University of British Columbia. His main research area is on assessing impacts of fishing and climate change on marine ecosystems and their goods and services, and studying ways to reconcile trade-offs in their management.
* '''[[Daniel Pauly]]''' is the Chair of the Nereus Steering Committee and a member of the Advisory Board. He is Professor at the University of British Columbia and the Principal Investigator of the Sea Around Us Program. His research focuses on the global impact of fishing on the world’s oceans and has developed the concept of shifting baseline and fishing down marine food webs.

==Budget==
15 million USD (1.5 million annually for 9 years from 2011 to 2019).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nereusprogram.org/about/fellows/ |title=People |publisher=Nereus Program |date= |accessdate=2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Nereus Program is solely funded by the Nippon Foundation, the largest non-governmental foundation in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nippon-foundation.or.jp/en/what/spotlight/ocean_outlook/ |title=Considering the Future of the World’s Oceans |publisher=The Nippon Foundation |date= |accessdate=2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public engagement and policy applications==
The Nereus Program is engaged with policy processes both at international and regional levels. The program has organized side events and workshops together with international organization representatives and national governmental officers.

2017: Side event at the UN Oceans Conference titled “The Role of the Oceans in Sustainability: Benefits of Achieving SDG 14 for all [[Sustainable Development Goals]]", where discussions led by Nereus affiliates were focused on how research indicates that achieving SDG 14 ocean targets contributes to the achievement of other SDG targets in the context of our changing ocean due to climate change and social equity. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.nereusprogram.org/event/un-oceans-conference-nf-nereus-program-side-event/&lt;/ref&gt;

2016: Side event at the United Nations Fish Stock Agreement Review Conference titled “Science, Policy and Civil Society: The Role of NGOs in Global Fisheries Management", where ongoing Nereus research on the potential role of civil society within regional fisheries management organizations was presented.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nereusprogram.org/managing-straddling-and-highly-migratory-fish-stocks-nereus-holds-side-event-at-the-un-fish-stocks-agreement-review-conference/&lt;/ref&gt;

2015: Press conference on the Nereus Program report in Tokyo&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nippon-foundation.or.jp/en/news/articles/2015/13.html |title=Nippon Foundation Nereus Program Reveals Critical State of World's Oceans in 2050 |publisher=The Nippon Foundation |date=2015-06-30 |accessdate=2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; (covered by 20 international media outlets, including CBS, and five major Japanese newspapers).

2013: Side event at the United Nations Open-ended Informal Consultative Process on Oceans and the Law of the Sea on seafood security and climate change (attended by nine countries representatives including Japan, US and Palau)

==Fellowships==
The Nereus Program provides fellowships to young scholars who conduct their research at participating academic institutes. Since 2011, there have been 30 Nereus Fellows&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nereusprogram.org/about/fellows/ |title=People |publisher=Nereus Program |date= |accessdate=2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; working in various issues on the future of oceans and fisheries. Currently, 11 postdoc and 7 Ph.D. students in the natural and social sciences are participating in the Nereus Program as Nereus Fellows.

Program Alumni have gone on to marine research positions in various institutes, including at the USA [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/about_us/staff/?lname=KEARNEY&amp;fname=Kelly&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of South Carolina]],&lt;ref&gt;http://ww2.biol.sc.edu/~ryk/&lt;/ref&gt; [[International Atomic Energy Agency]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marc_Metian&lt;/ref&gt; and [[ETH Zurich]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tfroelicher.com/about-me-1/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reports==

In May 2017, the Nereus Program released a research report, 'Oceans and Sustainable Development Goals: Co-Benefits, Climate Change and Social Equity', &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.nereusprogram.org/sdg-report/ |title=Nereus Report: Oceans and Sustainable Development Goals: Co-Benefits, Climate Change and Social Equity |publisher=Nereus Program |date=2017-05-31 |accessdate=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; bringing attention to the co-benefits of achieving the ocean goal SDG 14 on other sustainable development goals. Within the report, Nereus affiliate members have highlighted the idea that climate issues and social equity issues are inter-related; thus, this report has deduced that improving the health of our oceans through SDG 14 targets will contribute to the improvement of other areas of society, including, but not limited to, gender equality, sustained economic development, education quality, terrestrial conservation, reduced poverty, and food security. 

In June 2015, the Program released a research report entitled 'Predicting Future Oceans — Climate Change, Oceans &amp; Fisheries',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.nereusprogram.org/nereus-report-predicting-future-oceans-climate-change-oceans-fisheries/ |title=Nereus Report: Predicting Future Oceans — Climate Change, Oceans &amp; Fisheries |publisher=Nereus Program |date=2015-06-30 |accessdate=2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; summarizing the main contributions of the numerous projects undertaken by the members of the Nereus Program and its associated colleagues in cross-disciplinary analyses of the global ocean systems. Specifically, this year’s report discussed global changes that are impacting the marine ecosystems’ seafood production capacity, emerging trends in ocean governance, and socioeconomic changes that are affecting our relationship with the sea.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aquablog.ca/2015/07/nereus-program-releases-report-on-current-and-future-ocean-health/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
The program has produced over 150 peer-reviewed papers in various journals, including ''Science''&lt;ref&gt;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/349/6243/aac4722&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Nature Climate Change''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v3/n3/full/nclimate1691.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11621">'''Non-lexical [[vocable]]s''', which may be mixed with meaningful text, are a form of [[nonsense syllable]] used in a wide variety of music. A common English example would be "la la la", "na na na" or "da da da".

==Traditional music==
Non-lexical vocables are used in [[yodeling]], [[Blackfoot music]] and other [[Native American music]], [[Pygmy music]], the [[music of the Maldives]], [[Irish Music|Irish music]], and [[Music of Scotland|Highland Scots music]]. Vocables frequently act as formal markers, indicating the beginning and end of phrases, sections or songs themselves,&lt;ref&gt;Heth, cited in {{cite book
|editor    = Ellen Koskoff (Ed.)
|publisher = Garland Publishing
|pages     = 368–369
|year      = 2001
|location  = New York and London
|isbn        = 0-8240-4944-6
|title     = The Garland Encyclopedia of World Music: Volume 3, The United States and Canada
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also as onomatopoeic references, cueing devices, and other purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadianencyclopedia.ca/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=U1ARTU0002542 "Native North Americans in Canada"], ''The Canadian Encyclopedia Historica: Encyclopedia of Music in Canada''. Accessed 01/23/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Blackfeet|Blackfoot]], like other [[Plains Indians]], use the [[consonant]]s ''h'', ''y'', ''w'', and [[vowel]]s. They avoid ''n'', ''c'' (''ts'') and other consonants. ''i'' and ''e'' tend slightly to be higher [[pitch (music)|pitches]], ''a'', ''o'', and ''u'' lower ones.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nettl, Bruno]] (1989). ''Blackfoot Musical Thought: Comparative Perspectives'', p.71. Ohio: The Kent State University Press. {{ISBN|0-87338-370-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[AIM Song]] has its origins in the Plains; as such, it holds similar characteristics to Blackfoot song. It is intended as an intertribal song, so the use of non-lexical vocables prevents bias to one particular [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|language]].

Other traditional musical forms employing non-lexical vocables include:
* [[Puirt à beul]] (traditional Scottish and Irish song form that sometimes employs nonsense syllables)
* [[Nigun]] in Jewish religious music
* [[Joik]] or luohti (improvised [[Sami people|Sami]] chant employing nonsense syllables and few or no lyrics)

==Jazz music==
{{main|Scat singing}}
[[Scat singing]] is a type of voice instrumental music. A scat is vocalized using wordless vocables and syllables (e.g. "bippity-bippity-doo-wop-razzamatazz-skoobie-doobie-shoobity-bee-bop-a-lula-shabazz") as employed by jazz singers. Scat singing gives singers the ability to sing improvised melodies and rhythms, to create the equivalent of an instrumental solo using their voice. [[Scatman John]] (John Paul Larkin) renewed interest in the genre briefly during the mid-90s.

Vocal improviser [[Bobby McFerrin]]’s performances at major concert halls worldwide show that “wordless singing has traveled far from the concepts demonstrated by [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Gladys Bentley]], [[Cab Calloway]], [[Anita O’Day]], and [[Leo Watson]]”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crowther|Pinfold|1997|p=135}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another method of scat singing is practiced by guitarists who scat along with their solos note for note.  Notable practitioners include [[George Benson]], [[Sheldon Reynolds (guitarist)|Sheldon Reynolds]], and [[Rik Emmett]].

==Vocal percussion==
Non-lexical vocables that take on percussive roles:
* [[Bol (music) | Tabla Bols]]
* [[Beatboxing]]
* [[Konnakol]]

==Musical training==
* [[Solfège]], or solfa, is a technique for teaching [[sight-singing]], in which each note is sung to a special syllable (do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti). 
* [[Canntaireachd]] is an ancient Scottish practice of noting music with a combination of definite syllables for ease of recollection and transmission.
* In India, the origin of [[solmization]] was to be found in [[Vedic]] texts like the [[Upanishads]], which discuss a musical system of seven notes, realized ultimately in what is known as [[Swara|sargam]]. In [[Indian classical music]], the notes in order are: sa, re, ga, ma, pa, dha, and ni.
* [[Byzantine music]] also uses syllables derived from a hymn to name notes: starting with A, the notes are pa, vu, ga, di, ke, zo, ni.
* In Japan, the [[Iroha]], an ancient poem, is sometimes used as solfège (i, chi, yo, ra, ya, a, we).

==Popular music of the WWII era==
The song "[[Swinging the Alphabet]]" is sung by The Three Stooges in their short film ''[[Violent Is the Word for Curly]]'' (1938).  It is the only full-length song performed by the Stooges in their short films, and the only time they mimed to their own pre-recorded soundtrack.  The lyrics use each letter of the alphabet to make a nonsense verse of the song:
  B-A-bay, B-E-bee, B-I-bicky-bi, B-O bo, bicky-bi bo, B-U bu, bicky bi bo bu.
  C-A-cay, C-E-cee, C-I-cicky-ci, C-O co, cicky-ci co, C-U cu, cicky ci co cu.
  D-A-day, D-E-dee, D-I-dicky-di, D-O do, dicky-di do, D-U du, dicky di do du.
  F-A-fay, F-E-fee, F-I-ficky-fi, F-O fo, Ficky-fi fo, F-U fu, ficky fi fo fu.
  ...

The song "[[Mairzy Doats]]" (1943) used blurred lyrics that sound non-lexical:
  Mairzy doats and dozy doats and liddle lamzy divey
  A kiddley divey too, wouldn't you?
However, the lyrics of the bridge provide a clue:
  If the words sound queer and funny to your ear, a little bit jumbled and jivey,
  Sing "Mares eat oats and does eat oats and little lambs eat ivy."

==Popular music==
Examples of popular music employing non-lexical vocables include:
* [[A cappella]] (singing without instrumental accompaniment, sometimes accompanied by a chorus of nonsense syllables)
* [[Doo-wop]] (style of rhythm and blues music that often employs nonsense syllables)
* [[Kobaïan]] (language used by French progressive rock band [[Magma (band)|Magma]])
* [[Sigur Rós#Vonlenska|Vonlenska]], also called ''Hopelandic'', (gibberish language employed by the Icelandic post-rock band [[Sigur Rós]])

Jack Black uses non-lexical vocables whilst singing as Tenacious D

[[Van Morrison]] employed scat in his performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|contribution=Jim Morrison|title=Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock &amp; Roll|editor-last=Pareles|editor-first=Jon|editor-link=Jon Pareles|editor2-last=Romanowski|editor2-first=Patricia|editor3-last=George-Warren|editor3-first=Holly|year=2001|publisher=Fireside|place=|isbn=978-0-7432-0120-9|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/van-morrison/biography|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Scat singing]] influenced the development of [[doo-wop]] and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]]. It was popular enough in doo-wop that [[Barry Mann]] and [[Gerry Goffin]] made it the subject of a 1961 song, [[Who Put the Bomp (in the Bomp, Bomp, Bomp)]]". It has also appeared in various genres of [[rock music]]. [[Jim Morrison]] of [[The Doors]] sings a chorus of slow scat on the song "Cars Hiss By My Window", trying to replicate a harmonica solo he had heard, as well as on the song "[[Roadhouse Blues]]"; scat singing also notably opens the [[B-side]] of [[Joe Walsh]]'s 1973 album ''[[The Smoker You Drink, The Player You Get]]'' with the song "Meadow".  The technique was employed in the song "[[The Great Gig in the Sky]]" by [[Pink Floyd]], as well as the R&amp;B song "[[Rubber Biscuit]]" by [[The Chips]] (also as by [[The Blues Brothers]]).  The [[list of scat singers]] includes such greats as [[Jelly Roll Morton]], [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Bing Crosby]], [[Cab Calloway]], [[Scatman Crothers]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Sarah Vaughan]], [[Sammy Davis Jr.]], [[Mel Tormé]], [[Tony Bennett]], [[Cleo Laine]], [[Roger Miller]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Van Morrison]], and the [[Pointer Sisters]].

Scatting also makes appearances in newer genres, including [[industrial music]], in the chorus of [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]]'s 1991 song "[[Psalm 69: The Way to Succeed and the Way to Suck Eggs|Jesus Built My Hotrod]]"; [[nu metal]] music, in the band [[Korn (band)|Korn]] (whose lead singer [[Jonathan Davis]] has incorporated scat singing into songs such as "Twist", "[[Ball Tongue]]", "[[Freak on a Leash]]", "[[B.B.K. (song)|B.B.K.]]", "Beat it Upright", "Liar", and "[[Rotting in Vain]]"); and the heavy metal subgenre of [[death metal]], where scat singing is used by [[John Tardy]] of the band [[Obituary (band)|Obituary]]. [[Jack Black]] incorporates scat into several [[Tenacious D]] songs, most notably: "[[Tribute (song)|Tribute]]", "Cosmic Shame", "Classico," "Jesus Ranch," Low Hangin' Fruit," and "Bowie". Singer [[JoJo (singer)|JoJo]] performs ad-libbed scats on the track "Yes or No". Other modern examples include "Under Pressure" by [[Queen (band)]], "Rag Doll" by [[Aerosmith]], "Under My Voodoo" by [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]], "No! Don't Shoot" by [[Foxy Shazam]], "Ma Meeshka Mow Skwoz" by [[Mr. Bungle]], "In My Bed" by [[Amy Winehouse]], and "Stuck in the Middle" by [[Mika (singer)|Mika]]. [[Scatman John]] combined scat and early-1990s [[electronic dance music]].

Examples by popular non-[[English-speaking|anglophone]] singers using such techniques include "[[Bla Bla Bla]]" by [[Gigi D'Agostino]], "Eena Mina Dika" in the Bollywood film ''[[Aasha (1957 film)|Aasha]]'', [[Eduard Khil]]'s "I Am Glad, Cause I'm Finally Returning Back Home" (known as "[[Trololo]]") sung entirely without lyrics, "[[Fuzao]]" by [[Faye Wong]], "[[Alive (Sa Dingding album)|Lagu Lagu]]" by [[Sa Dingding]] and "[[Din Daa Daa]]" by [[George Kranz]].

Due to the wide-ranging vocal styles used in popular music, occasionally songs have been mistakenly categorized as having non-lexical vocables, when in fact the singers are performing actual lyrics rendered partially (or completely) unintelligible to the ear of some (but not all) listeners. Two famous 1960s examples are "[[Louie Louie]]" as recorded by [[The Kingsmen]] and "[[Wooly Bully]]" by [[Sam the Sham|Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs]].

==Disney songs==
A signature of some [[Disney]] [[musical film]]s is their songs' use of [[nonsense word]]s, the longest and most famous of which is from ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'', entitled  "[[Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious]]".  A close second is "[[Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah]]" from ''[[Song of the South]]'', which won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]]. Nonsense word song titles include:
*"[[Heigh-Ho]]" from ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''  (1937)
*"[[Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah]]" from ''[[Song of the South]]''  (1946)
*"[[Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo]]" from ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''  (1950)
*"[[Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious]]" and "[[Chim Chim Cher-ee]]" from ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]''  (1964)
*"[[Substitutiary Locomotion]]" from ''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]'' (1971), which includes the incantation "Treguna Mekoides and Tracorum Satis Dee"
*"Whistle-Stop" from [[Robin Hood (1973 film)|Robin Hood]] (1973)
*"[[Whoop-de-Dooper Bounce]]" from ''[[The Tigger Movie]]'' (2000)

Nonsense lyrics also feature in the following Disney songs:
*"[[I Wanna Be Like You]]" from ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]'' features a segment of improvisational nonsense words.
*"Trashing the Camp" from ''[[Tarzan (1999 film)|Tarzan]]'' also contains a segment of improvisational nonsense words.
*"[[Everybody Wants to Be a Cat]]" from ''[[The Aristocats]]'', sung by [[Scatman Crothers]] as "Scat Cat", contains lengthy scat sequences.

[[Image:Galton number form.svg|thumb|right|300px|A number form from one of Francis Galton's (1888) subjects. Note the convolutions, and how the first 12 digits correspond to a clock face.]]

A '''number form''' is a mental map of [[number]]s, which [[Automaticity|automatically]] and involuntarily appears whenever someone who experiences number-forms thinks of numbers. Numbers are mapped into distinct spatial locations and the mapping may be different across individuals. Number forms were first documented and named by Sir [[Francis Galton]] in his ''The Visions of Sane Persons'' {{Harv|Galton|1881a}}. Later research has identified them as a type of [[synesthesia]] ({{Harvnb|Seron|Pesenti|Noël|1992}}; {{Harvnb|Sagiv|Simner|Collins|Butterworth|2006}}).

== Neural mechanisms ==
It has been suggested that number-forms are a result of "cross-activation" between regions of the [[parietal lobe]] that are involved in [[Numerical Cognition|numerical cognition]] and angular gyrus for spatial cognition ({{Harvnb|Ramachandran|Hubbard|2001}}; {{Harvnb|Hubbard|Pinel|Piazza|Dehaene|2005}}). Since the areas that process numerical and spatial representations are close to each other, this may contribute to the increased cross-activation. Compared to non-synesthetes, [[synesthesia|synesthetes]] display larger [[P3b]] amplitudes for month cues, but similar [[Visual N1|N1]] and P3b responses for arrow (&lt;- or -&gt;) and word (left or right) cues. ({{Harvnb|Teuscher|Brang|Ramachandran|Coulson|2010}}).

== Reaction time research ==
[[Reaction time]] studies have shown that number-form synesthetes are faster to say which of two numbers is larger when the numbers are arranged in a manner consistent with their number-form, suggesting that number forms are automatically evoked ({{Harvnb|Sagiv|Simner|Collins|Butterworth|2006}}; {{Harvnb|Piazza|Pinel|Dehaene|in press}}).  This can be thought of as a "spatial [[Stroop effect|Stroop]]" task, in which space is not relevant to the task, but which can hinder performance despite its irrelevance.  The fact that synesthetes cannot ignore the spatial arrangement of the numbers on the screen demonstrates that numbers are automatically evoking spatial cues. The reaction times for valid cues are smaller than invalid cues (words and arrows), but in synesthetes the response time differences for months are larger than those of non-synesthetes ({{Harvnb|Teuscher|Brang|Ramachandran|Coulson|2010}}).

== Differences with number line ==
These number forms can be distinguished from the non-conscious mental [[number line]] that we all have by the fact that they are 1) [[conscious]], 2) [[idiosyncratic]] (see image) and 3) stable across the lifespan. Although this form of synesthesia has not been as intensively studied as [[Grapheme → color synesthesia]], Hubbard and colleagues have argued that similar neural mechanisms might be involved, but acting in different brain regions ({{Harvnb|Hubbard|Pinel|Piazza|Dehaene|2005}}). Future studies will need to be conducted to test this hypothesis.

'''Ohm's law''' states that the [[electric current|current]] through a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] between two points is directly [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the [[voltage]] across the two points. Introducing the constant of proportionality, the [[Electrical resistance|resistance]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

More specifically, Ohm's law states that the ''R'' in this relation is constant, independent of the current.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ohm's law is an [[empirical law|empirical relation]] which accurately describes the conductivity of the vast majority of [[electrical conductor|electrically conductive materials]] over many orders of magnitude of current.  However some materials do not obey Ohm's law, these are called [[Non-ohmic resistance|non-ohmic]].

The law was named after the German physicist [[Georg Ohm]], who, in a treatise published in 1827, described measurements of applied voltage and current through simple electrical circuits containing various lengths of wire. Ohm explained his experimental results by a slightly more complex equation than the modern form above (see [[#History|History]]).

In physics, the term ''Ohm's law'' is also used to refer to various generalizations of the law; for example the [[Vector (mathematics and physics)|vector]] form of the law used in [[electromagnetics]] and material science:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} = \sigma \mathbf{E},&lt;/math&gt;

where '''J''' is the [[current density]] at a given location in a resistive material, '''E''' is the electric field at that location, and ''σ'' ([[sigma]]) is a material-dependent parameter called the [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]].  This reformulation of Ohm's law is due to [[Gustav Kirchhoff]].&lt;ref&gt;Olivier Darrigol, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZzeYSbqITWkC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=%22alternative+formulation+of+Ohm%27s+law%22+isbn:0198505949&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0#v=onepage&amp;q=%22alternative%20formulation%20of%20Ohm%27s%20law%22%20isbn%3A0198505949&amp;f=false ''Electrodynamics from Ampère to Einstein''], p.70, Oxford University Press, 2000 {{ISBN|0-19-850594-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Ohm3.gif|thumb|200px|Georg Ohm]]
In January 1781, before [[Georg Ohm]]'s work, [[Henry Cavendish]] experimented with [[Leyden jar]]s and glass tubes of varying diameter and length filled with salt solution.  He measured the current by noting how strong a shock he felt as he completed the circuit with his body.  Cavendish wrote that the "velocity" (current) varied directly as the "degree of electrification" (voltage). He did not communicate his results to other scientists at the time,&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Electricity|volume=9|page=182|first=John Ambrose |last=Fleming}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his results were unknown until [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] published them in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;Sanford P. Bordeau (1982)  ''Volts to Hertz...the Rise of Electricity.''  Burgess Publishing Company, Minneapolis, MN.  pp.86–107, {{ISBN|0-8087-4908-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francis Ronalds]] delineated “intensity” (voltage) and “quantity” (current) for the [[Voltaic pile#Dry pile|dry pile]] – a high voltage source – in 1814 using a [[Electrometer#Gold-leaf electrometer|gold-leaf electrometer]].  He found for a dry pile that the relationship between the two parameters was not proportional under certain meteorological conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.

[[File:Ohmsches Gesetz in Georg Simon Ohms Laborbuch.jpg|thumb|Ohm's law in Georg Ohm's lab book.]]
Ohm did his work on resistance in the years 1825 and 1826, and published his results in 1827 as the book ''Die galvanische Kette, mathematisch bearbeitet'' ("The galvanic circuit investigated mathematically").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He drew considerable inspiration from [[Joseph Fourier|Fourier]]'s work on heat conduction in the theoretical explanation of his work.  For experiments, he initially used [[voltaic pile]]s, but later used a [[thermocouple]] as this provided a more stable voltage source in terms of internal resistance and constant voltage.  He used a galvanometer to measure current, and knew that the voltage between the thermocouple terminals was proportional to the junction temperature.  He then added test wires of varying length, diameter, and material to complete the circuit.  He found that his data could be modeled through the equation
:&lt;math&gt;x = \frac{a}{b + l},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''x'' was the reading from the [[galvanometer]], ''l'' was the length of the test conductor, ''a'' depended on the thermocouple junction temperature, and ''b'' was a constant of the entire setup.  From this, Ohm determined his law of proportionality and published his results.

In modern notation we would write,

:&lt;math&gt; I = \frac {\mathcal E}{r+R},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal E&lt;/math&gt; is the open-circuit emf of the thermocouple, &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the internal resistance of the thermocouple and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the resistance of the test wire.  In terms of the length of the wire this becomes,

:&lt;math&gt; I = \frac {\mathcal E}{r+\mathcal R l},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal R&lt;/math&gt; is the resistance of the test wire per unit length.  Thus, Ohm's coefficients are,

:&lt;math&gt; a = \frac {\mathcal E}{\mathcal R}, \quad b = \frac {\mathcal r}{\mathcal R} .&lt;/math&gt;

Ohm's law was probably the most important of the early quantitative descriptions of the physics of electricity.  We consider it almost obvious today. When Ohm first published his work, this was not the case; critics reacted to his treatment of the subject with hostility.  They called his work a "web of naked fancies"&lt;ref&gt;
Davies, B, "A web of naked fancies?", ''Physics Education'' 15 57–61, Institute of Physics, Issue 1, Jan 1980 [http://www.iop.org/EJ/S/UNREG/an0VsEw7ynSY0UzIRNaNVQ/abstract/0031-9120/15/1/314]
&lt;/ref&gt; and the German Minister of Education proclaimed that "a professor who preached such heresies was unworthy to teach science."&lt;ref&gt;Hart, IB, ''Makers of Science'', London, Oxford University Press, 1923. p. 243. [http://www.foresight.org/news/negativeComments.html#loc037]&lt;/ref&gt; The prevailing scientific philosophy in Germany at the time asserted that experiments need not be performed to develop an understanding of nature because nature is so well ordered, and that scientific truths may be deduced through reasoning alone.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Schnädelbach, ''Philosophy in Germany 1831–1933'', pages 78-79, Cambridge University Press, 1984 {{ISBN|0521296463}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, Ohm's brother Martin, a mathematician, was battling the German educational system. These factors hindered the acceptance of Ohm's work, and his work did not become widely accepted until the 1840s.  However, Ohm received recognition for his contributions to science well before he died.

In the 1850s, Ohm's law was known as such and was widely considered proved, and alternatives, such as "[[Barlow's law]]", were discredited, in terms of real applications to telegraph system design, as discussed by [[Samuel F. B. Morse]] in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Shaffner's Telegraph Companion: Devoted to the Science and Art of the Morse Telegraph | author = Taliaferro Preston | authorlink = Taliaferro Preston Shaffner | publisher = Pudney &amp; Russell | volume = Vol.2 | year = 1855 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=TDEOAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA43&amp;dq=ohm%27s-law+date:0-1860 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[electron]] was discovered in 1897 by [[J. J. Thomson]], and it was quickly realized that it is the particle ([[charge carrier]]) that carries electric currents in electric circuits.  In 1900 the first ([[classical physics|classical]]) model of electrical conduction, the [[Drude model]], was proposed by [[Paul Drude]], which finally gave a scientific explanation for Ohm's law.  In this model, a solid conductor consists of a stationary lattice of [[atom]]s ([[ion]]s), with [[conduction electron]]s moving randomly in it.  A voltage across a conductor causes an [[electric field]], which accelerates the electrons in the direction of the electric field, causing a drift of electrons which is the electric current.  However the electrons collide with and scatter off of the atoms, which randomizes their motion, thus converting the kinetic energy added to the electron by the field to [[heat]] ([[thermal energy]]).  Using statistical distributions, it can be shown that the average drift velocity of the electrons, and thus the current, is proportional to the electric field, and thus the voltage, over a wide range of voltages.

The development of [[quantum mechanics]] in the 1920s modified this picture somewhat, but in modern theories the average drift velocity of electrons can still be shown to be proportional to the electric field, thus deriving Ohm's law. In 1927 [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] applied the quantum [[Fermi-Dirac distribution]] of electron energies to the Drude model, resulting in the [[free electron model]]. A year later, [[Felix Bloch]] showed that electrons move in waves ([[Bloch wave]]s) through a solid crystal lattice, so scattering off the lattice atoms as postulated in the Drude model is not a major process; the electrons scatter off impurity atoms and defects in the material. The final successor, the modern quantum [[band theory]] of solids, showed that the electrons in a solid cannot take on any energy as assumed in the Drude model but are restricted to energy bands, with gaps between them of energies that electrons are forbidden to have.   The size of the band gap is a characteristic of a particular substance which has a great deal to do with its electrical resistivity, explaining why some substances are [[electrical conductor]]s, some [[semiconductor]]s, and some [[insulator (electricity)|insulator]]s.

While the old term for electrical conductance, the [[Siemens (unit)|mho]] (the inverse of the resistance unit ohm), is still used, a new name, the [[Siemens (unit)|siemens]], was adopted in 1971, honoring [[Ernst Werner von Siemens]].  The siemens is preferred in formal papers.

In the 1920s, it was discovered that the current through a practical resistor actually has statistical fluctuations, which depend on temperature, even when voltage and resistance are exactly constant; this fluctuation, now known as [[Johnson–Nyquist noise]], is due to the discrete nature of charge.  This thermal effect implies that measurements of current and voltage that are taken over sufficiently short periods of time will yield ratios of V/I that fluctuate from the value of R implied by the time average or [[ensemble average]] of the measured current; Ohm's law remains correct for the average current, in the case of ordinary resistive materials.

Ohm's work long preceded [[Maxwell's equations]] and any understanding of frequency-dependent effects in AC circuits. Modern developments in electromagnetic theory and circuit theory do not contradict Ohm's law when they are evaluated within the appropriate limits.

==Scope==
Ohm's law is an [[empirical law]], a generalization from many experiments that have shown that current is approximately proportional to electric field for most materials. It is less fundamental than [[Maxwell's equations]] and is not always obeyed. Any given material will [[electrical breakdown|break down]] under a strong-enough electric field, and some materials of interest in electrical engineering are "non-ohmic" under weak fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Purcell |first=Edward M. |authorlink=Edward Mills Purcell |year=1985 |title=Electricity and magnetism |edition=2nd |series=Berkeley Physics Course |volume=2 |isbn=0-07-004908-4 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Griffiths |first=David J. |authorlink=David Griffiths (physicist) |year=1999 |title=Introduction to electrodynamics |edition=3rd |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=0-13-805326-X |page=289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ohm's law has been observed on a wide range of length scales. In the early 20th century, it was thought that Ohm's law would fail at the [[Atomic spacing|atomic scale]], but experiments have not borne out this expectation. As of 2012, researchers have demonstrated that Ohm's law works for [[silicon]] wires as small as four atoms wide and one atom high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weber | first1 = B. | last2 = Mahapatra | first2 = S. | last3 = Ryu | first3 = H. | last4 = Lee | first4 = S. | last5 = Fuhrer | first5 = A. | last6 = Reusch | first6 = T.

The dependence of the current density on the applied electric field is essentially [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] in nature;  (see Classical and quantum conductivity.)  A qualitative description leading to Ohm's law can be based upon [[classical mechanics]] using the [[Drude model]] developed by [[Paul Drude]] in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The Drude model treats [[electron]]s (or other charge carriers) like pinballs bouncing among the [[ion]]s that make up the structure of the material.  Electrons will be accelerated in the opposite direction to the electric field by the average electric field at their location. With each collision, though, the electron is deflected in a random direction with a velocity that is much larger than the velocity gained by the electric field.  The net result is that electrons take a zigzag path due to the collisions, but generally drift in a direction opposing the electric field.

The [[drift velocity]] then determines the electric [[current density]] and its relationship to '''''E''''' and is independent of the collisions.  Drude calculated the average drift velocity from '''''p'''''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−''e'''E'''τ'' where '''''p''''' is the average [[momentum]], −''e'' is the charge of the electron and τ is the average time between the collisions.   Since both the momentum and the current density are proportional to the drift velocity, the current density becomes proportional to the applied electric field; this leads to Ohm's law.

==Hydraulic analogy==

A [[hydraulic analogy]] is sometimes used to describe Ohm's law.  Water pressure, measured by [[pascal (unit)|pascals]] (or [[pounds per square inch|PSI]]), is the analog of voltage because establishing a water pressure difference between two points along a (horizontal) pipe causes water to flow.  Water flow rate, as in [[liter]]s per second, is the analog of current, as in [[coulomb]]s per second. Finally, flow restrictors—such as apertures placed in pipes between points where the water pressure is measured—are the analog of resistors. We say that the rate of water flow through an aperture restrictor is proportional to the difference in water pressure across the restrictor. Similarly, the rate of flow of electrical charge, that is, the electric current, through an electrical resistor is proportional to the difference in voltage measured across the resistor.

Flow and pressure variables can be calculated in fluid flow network with the use of the hydraulic ohm analogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=A. Akers |author2=M. Gassman |author3=R.

In the linear [[laminar flow]] region, [[Poiseuille's law]] describes the hydraulic resistance of a pipe, but in the [[turbulent flow]] region the pressure–flow relations become nonlinear.

The hydraulic analogy to Ohm's law has been used, for example, to approximate blood flow through the circulatory system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Guyton |first1=Arthur |last2=Hall |first2=John |editor1-first=Rebecca |editor1-last=Gruliow |title=Textbook of Medical Physiology |edition=11th |year=2006 |publisher=Elsevier Inc. |location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |isbn=0-7216-0240-1 |page=164  |chapter=Chapter 14: Overview of the Circulation; Medical Physics of Pressure, Flow, and Resistance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The interchangeability of the equation may be represented by a triangle, where V ([[voltage]]) is placed on the top section, the I ([[electric current|current]]) is placed to the left section, and the R ([[electrical resistance|resistance]]) is placed to the right. The line that divides the left and right sections indicates multiplication, and the divider between the top and bottom sections indicates division (hence the division bar).

===Resistive circuits===

[[Resistor]]s are circuit elements that impede the passage of electric charge in agreement with Ohm's law, and are designed to have a specific resistance value ''R''.  In a schematic diagram the resistor is shown as a zig-zag symbol.  An element (resistor or conductor) that behaves according to Ohm's law over some operating range is referred to as an ''ohmic device'' (or an ''ohmic resistor'') because Ohm's law and a single value for the resistance suffice to describe the behavior of the device over that range.

Ohm's law holds for circuits containing only resistive elements (no capacitances or inductances) for all forms of driving voltage or current, regardless of whether the driving voltage or current is constant ([[direct current|DC]]) or time-varying such as [[alternating current|AC]].  At any instant of time Ohm's law is valid for such circuits.

Resistors which are in ''[[Series and parallel circuits#Series circuits|series]]'' or in ''[[Series and parallel circuits#Parallel circuits|parallel]]'' may be grouped together into a single "equivalent resistance" in order to apply Ohm's law in analyzing the circuit.

===Reactive circuits with time-varying signals===

When reactive elements such as capacitors, inductors, or transmission lines are involved in a circuit to which AC or time-varying voltage or current is applied, the relationship between voltage and current becomes the solution to a [[differential equation]], so Ohm's law (as defined above) does not directly apply since that form contains only resistances having value R, not complex impedances which may contain capacitance ("C") or inductance ("L").

Equations for [[time-invariant]] [[alternating current|AC]] circuits take the same form as Ohm's law. However, the variables are generalized to [[complex number]]s and the current and voltage waveforms are [[complex exponential]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering | author = Rajendra Prasad | publisher = Prentice-Hall of India | year = 2006 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nsmcbzOJU3kC&amp;pg=PA140&amp;dq=ohm%27s-law+complex+exponentials | isbn = 978-81-203-2729-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this approach, a voltage or current waveform takes the form &lt;math&gt;Ae^{st}&lt;/math&gt;, where ''t'' is time, ''s'' is a complex parameter, and ''A'' is a complex scalar.  In any [[LTI system theory|linear time-invariant system]], all of the currents and voltages can be expressed with the same ''s'' parameter as the input to the system, allowing the time-varying complex exponential term to be canceled out and the system described algebraically in terms of the complex scalars in the current and voltage waveforms.

The complex generalization of resistance is [[electrical impedance|impedance]], usually denoted ''Z''; it can be shown that for an inductor,

:&lt;math&gt;Z = sL\,&lt;/math&gt;

and for a capacitor,

:&lt;math&gt;Z = \frac{1}{sC}.&lt;/math&gt;

We can now write,

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{V} = \boldsymbol{I} \cdot \boldsymbol{Z}&lt;/math&gt;

where '''''V''''' and '''''I''''' are the complex scalars in the voltage and current respectively and '''''Z''''' is the complex impedance.

This form of Ohm's law, with ''Z'' taking the place of ''R'', generalizes the simpler form.  When ''Z'' is complex, only the real part is responsible for dissipating heat.

In the general AC circuit, ''Z'' varies strongly with the frequency parameter ''s'', and so also will the relationship between voltage and current.

For the common case of a steady [[Sine wave|sinusoid]], the ''s'' parameter is taken to be &lt;math&gt;j\omega&lt;/math&gt;, corresponding to a complex sinusoid &lt;math&gt;Ae^{\mbox{ } j \omega t}&lt;/math&gt;.  The real parts of such complex current and voltage waveforms describe the actual sinusoidal currents and voltages in a circuit, which can be in different phases due to the different complex scalars.

===Linear approximations===

{{See also|Small-signal modeling|Network analysis (electrical circuits)#Small signal equivalent circuit}}

Ohm's law is one of the basic equations used in the [[Network analysis (electrical circuits)|analysis of electrical circuits]].  It applies to both metal conductors and circuit components ([[resistor]]s) specifically made for this behaviour.  Both are ubiquitous in electrical engineering.  Materials and components that obey Ohm's law are described as "ohmic" &lt;ref&gt;Hughes, E, ''Electrical Technology'', pp10, Longmans, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; which means they produce the same value for resistance (R = V/I) regardless of the value of V or I which is applied and whether the applied voltage or current is DC ([[direct current]]) of either positive or negative polarity or AC ([[alternating current]]).

In a true ohmic device, the same value of resistance will be calculated from R = V/I regardless of the value of the applied voltage V.  That is, the ratio of V/I is constant, and when current is plotted as a function of voltage the curve is ''linear'' (a straight line).  If voltage is forced to some value V, then that voltage V divided by measured current I will equal R.  Or if the current is forced to some value I, then the measured voltage V divided by that current I is also R.  Since the plot of I versus V is a straight line, then it is also true that for any set of two different voltages V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; applied across a given device of resistance R, producing currents I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/R and I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/R, that the ratio (V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;−V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)/(I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;−I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is also a constant equal to R.  The operator "delta" (Δ) is used to represent a difference in a quantity, so we can write ΔV = V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;−V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ΔI = I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;−I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  Summarizing, for any truly ohmic device having resistance R, V/I = ΔV/ΔI = R for any applied voltage or current or for the difference between any set of applied voltages or currents.

[[File:FourIVcurves.svg|thumb|400px|The [[I–V curve]]s of four devices: Two [[resistor]]s, a [[diode]], and a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]]. The two resistors follow Ohm's law: The plot is a straight line through the origin. The other two devices do ''not'' follow Ohm's law.]]

There are, however, components of electrical circuits which do not obey Ohm's law; that is, their relationship between current and voltage (their [[I–V curve]]) is ''nonlinear'' (or non-ohmic).  An example is the [[Diode#Shockley diode equation|p-n junction diode]] (curve at right).  As seen in the figure, the current does not increase linearly with applied voltage for a diode.  One can determine a value of current (I) for a given value of applied voltage (V) from the curve, but not from Ohm's law, since the value of "resistance" is not constant as a function of applied voltage.  Further, the current only increases significantly if the applied voltage is positive, not negative.  The ratio ''V''/''I'' for some point along the nonlinear curve is sometimes called the ''static'', or ''chordal'', or [[direct current|DC]], resistance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Engineering System Dynamics | author = Forbes T. Brown | publisher = CRC Press | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-8493-9648-9 | page = 43 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=UzqX4j9VZWcC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=%22chordal+resistance%22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Electromagnetic Compatibility Handbook | author = Kenneth L.

This means the "DC resistance" V/I at some point on the curve is not the same as what would be determined by applying an AC signal having peak amplitude ΔV volts or ΔI amps centered at that same point along the curve and measuring ΔV/ΔI. However, in some diode applications, the AC signal applied to the device is small and it is possible to analyze the circuit in terms of the ''dynamic'', ''small-signal'', or ''incremental'' resistance, defined as the one over the slope of the V–I curve at the average value (DC operating point) of the voltage (that is, one over the [[derivative]] of current with respect to voltage).  For sufficiently small signals, the dynamic resistance allows the Ohm's law small signal resistance to be calculated as approximately one over the slope of a line drawn tangentially to the V-I curve at the DC operating point.&lt;ref name=horowitz-hill&gt;{{cite book |last=Horowitz |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Horowitz |author2=[[Winfield Hill]] | title=The Art of Electronics |edition=2nd |year=1989 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-37095-7 |page = 13 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bkOMDgwFA28C&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=small-signal+%22dynamic+resistance%22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temperature effects==

Ohm's law has sometimes been stated as, "for a conductor in a given state, the electromotive force is proportional to the current produced."  That is, that the resistance, the ratio of the applied [[electromotive force]] (or voltage) to the current, "does not vary with the current strength ."  The qualifier "in a given state" is usually interpreted as meaning "at a constant temperature," since the resistivity of materials is usually temperature dependent. Because the conduction of current is related to [[Joule heating]] of the conducting body, according to [[Joule's first law]], the temperature of a conducting body may change when it carries a current.  The dependence of resistance on temperature therefore makes resistance depend upon the current in a typical experimental setup, making the law in this form difficult to directly verify.  [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] and others worked out several methods to test the law experimentally in 1876, controlling for heating effects.&lt;ref&gt;

==Relation to heat conductions==
{{See also|Conduction (heat)}}
Ohm's principle predicts the flow of electrical charge (i.e. current) in electrical conductors when subjected to the influence of voltage differences; [[Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier|Jean-Baptiste-Joseph Fourier]]'s principle predicts the flow of [[heat]] in heat conductors when subjected to the influence of temperature differences.

The same equation describes both phenomena, the equation's variables taking on different meanings in the two cases. Specifically, solving a heat conduction (Fourier) problem with ''[[temperature]]'' (the driving "force") and ''[[flux|flux of heat]]'' (the rate of flow of the driven "quantity", i.e. heat energy) variables also solves an analogous [[electrical conduction]] (Ohm) problem having ''[[electric potential]]'' (the driving "force") and ''[[electric current]]'' (the rate of flow of the driven "quantity", i.e. charge) variables.

The basis of Fourier's work was his clear conception and definition of [[thermal conductivity]]. He assumed that, all else being the same, the flux of heat is strictly proportional to the gradient of temperature. Although undoubtedly true for small temperature gradients, strictly proportional behavior will be lost when real materials (e.g. ones having a thermal conductivity that is a function of temperature) are subjected to large temperature gradients.

A similar assumption is made in the statement of Ohm's law: other things being alike, the strength of the current at each point is proportional to the gradient of electric potential. The accuracy of the assumption that flow is proportional to the gradient is more readily tested, using modern measurement methods, for the electrical case than for the heat case.

==Other versions==

Ohm's law, in the form above, is an extremely useful equation in the field of electrical/electronic engineering because it describes how voltage, current and resistance are interrelated on a "macroscopic" level, that is, commonly, as circuit elements in an [[electrical circuit]]. Physicists who study the electrical properties of matter at the microscopic level use a closely related and more general [[Vector (mathematics and physics)|vector]] equation, sometimes also referred to as Ohm's law, having variables that are closely related to the V, I, and R [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] variables of Ohm's law, but which are each functions of position within the conductor.  Physicists often use this continuum form of Ohm's Law:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/math&gt;

where "'''E'''" is the [[electric field]] vector with units of volts per meter (analogous to "V" of Ohm's law which has units of volts), "'''J'''" is the [[current density]] vector with units of amperes per unit area (analogous to "I" of Ohm's law which has units of amperes), and "ρ" (Greek "rho") is the [[resistivity]] with units of ohm·meters (analogous to "R" of Ohm's law which has units of ohms).  The above equation is sometimes written&lt;ref&gt;Seymour J, ''Physical Electronics'', Pitman, 1972, pp 53–54&lt;/ref&gt; as '''J''' = &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;'''E''' where "σ" (Greek "sigma") is the [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]] which is the reciprocal of ρ.

[[File:Ohms law vectors.svg|thumb|290px|Current flowing through a uniform cylindrical conductor (such as a round wire) with a uniform field applied.]]
The voltage between two points is defined as:&lt;ref&gt;Lerner L, ''Physics for scientists and engineers'', Jones &amp; Bartlett, 1997, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nv5GAyAdijoC&amp;pg=PA685 pp. 685–686]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;{\Delta V} = -\int {\mathbf E \cdot d \mathbf l} &lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;d \mathbf l&lt;/math&gt; the element of path along the integration of electric field vector '''E'''. If the applied '''E''' field is uniform and oriented along the length of the conductor as shown in the figure, then defining the voltage V in the usual convention of being opposite in direction to the field (see figure), and with the understanding that the voltage V is measured differentially across the length of the conductor allowing us to drop the Δ symbol, the above vector equation reduces to the scalar equation:

:&lt;math&gt;V = {E}{l}  \ \  \text{or} \ \ E = \frac{V}{l}. &lt;/math&gt;

Since the '''E''' field is uniform in the direction of wire length, for a conductor having uniformly consistent resistivity ρ, the current density '''J''' will also be uniform in any cross-sectional area and oriented in the direction of wire length, so we may write:&lt;ref name=lerner732&gt;Lerner L, ''Physics for scientists and engineers'', Jones &amp; Bartlett, 1997, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nv5GAyAdijoC&amp;pg=PA732 pp. 732–733]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; J = \frac{I}{a}.&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the above 2 results (for ''E'' and ''J'' respectively) into the continuum form shown at the beginning of this section:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{V}{l} = \frac{I}{a}\rho \qquad \text{or} \qquad V = I \rho \frac{l}{a}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[electrical resistance]] of a uniform conductor is given in terms of [[resistivity]] by:&lt;ref name=lerner732/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;{R} = \rho \frac{l}{a} &lt;/math&gt;
where ''l'' is the length of the conductor in [[International System of Units|SI]] units of meters, ''a'' is the cross-sectional area (for a round wire ''a'' = ''πr''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; if ''r'' is radius) in units of meters squared, and ρ is the resistivity in units of ohm·meters.

After substitution of ''R'' from the above equation into the equation preceding it, the continuum form of Ohm's law for a uniform field (and uniform current density) oriented along the length of the conductor reduces to the more familiar form:
:&lt;math&gt;{V}={I}{R}. \ &lt;/math&gt;

A perfect crystal lattice, with low enough thermal motion and no deviations from periodic structure, would have no [[resistivity]],&lt;ref&gt;Seymour J, ''Physical Electronics'', pp 48–49, Pitman, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; but a real metal has [[crystallographic defect]]s, impurities, multiple [[isotope]]s, and thermal motion of the atoms. Electrons [[scattering|scatter]] from all of these, resulting in resistance to their flow.

The more complex generalized forms of Ohm's law are important to [[condensed matter physics]], which studies the properties of [[matter]] and, in particular, its [[electronic structure]]. In broad terms, they fall under the topic of [[constitutive equations]] and the theory of [[Green–Kubo relations|transport coefficients]].

===Magnetic effects===
If an external '''B'''-field is present and the conductor is not at rest but moving at velocity '''v''', then an extra term must be added to account for the current induced by the [[Lorentz force]] on the charge carriers.
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} = \sigma (\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B})&lt;/math&gt;

In the [[rest frame]] of the moving conductor this term drops out because '''v'''= 0. There is no contradiction because the electric field in the rest frame differs from the '''E'''-field in the lab frame: '''E′'''  = '''E''' + '''v'''×'''B'''.
Electric and magnetic fields are relative, see [[Lorentz transformation]].

If the current '''J''' is alternating because the applied voltage or '''E'''-field varies in time, then reactance must be added to resistance to account for self-inductance, see [[electrical impedance]]. The reactance may be strong if the frequency is high or the conductor is coiled.

===Conductive fluids===
In a conductive fluid, such as a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], there is a similar effect. Consider a fluid moving with the velocity &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; in a magnetic field &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;. The relative motion induces an electric field &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt; which exerts [[electric force]] on the charged particles giving rise to an [[electric current]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}&lt;/math&gt;. The equation of motion for the electron gas, with a [[number density]] &lt;math&gt;n_e&lt;/math&gt;, is written as

:&lt;math&gt; m_en_e{d\mathbf{v}_e\over dt}=-n_e e \mathbf{E}+ n_e m_e \nu (v_i-v_e)-en_e\mathbf{v}_e\times \mathbf{B}, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;m_e&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_e&lt;/math&gt; are the charge, mass and velocity of the electrons, respectively. Also, &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is the frequency of collisions of the electrons with ions which have a velocity field &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_i&lt;/math&gt;. Since, the electron has a very small mass compared with that of ions, we can ignore the left hand side of the above equation to write

:&lt;math&gt; \sigma(\mathbf{E}+\mathbf{v}\times \mathbf{B})=\mathbf{J}, &lt;/math&gt;

where we have used the definition of the [[current density]], and also put &lt;math&gt;\sigma={n_e e^2\over \nu m_e}&lt;/math&gt; which is the [[electrical conductivity]]. This equation can also be equivalently written as

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{E}+\mathbf{v}\times \mathbf{B}=\rho\mathbf{J}, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho=\sigma^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[electrical resistivity]]. It is also common to write &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; which can be confusing since it is the same notation used for the magnetic diffusivity defined as &lt;math&gt;\eta=1/\mu_0\sigma&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4166">'''Parallel I/O''', in the context of a [[computer]], means the performance of multiple [[input/output]] operations at the same time, for instance simultaneously outputs to storage devices and display devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hssl.cs.jhu.edu/~randal/419/lectures/L15.ParallelIO.pdf | title=Parallel I/O | publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a fundamental feature of [[operating system]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Fall_IO.pdf | title=Introduction to Parallel I/O | publisher=[[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One particular instance is parallel writing of data to disk; when file data is spread across multiple disks, for example in a [[RAID]] array, one can store multiple parts of the data at the same time, thereby achieving higher write speeds than with a single device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cac.cornell.edu/education/training/ParallelMay2012/ParallelIOMay2012.pdf | title=Introduction: The Parallel I/O Stack | publisher=[[Cornell University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/documents/13601/900558/MPI-IO-Final.pdf/eea9d7d3-4b81-471c-b244-41498070e35d | title=Introduction to Parallel I/O | publisher=[[The University of Texas at Austin]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other ways of parallel access to data include: [[Parallel Virtual File System]], [[Lustre (file system)|Lustre]], [[Google File System|GFS]] etc.

==Features==

===Scientific computing===
It is used for scientific computing and not for databases. It breaks up support into multiple layers including High level I/O library, Middleware layer and Parallel file system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.scd.stfc.ac.uk//support/44958.aspx | title=Parallel I/O | publisher=Scientific Computing Department}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parallel File System manages the single view, maintains logical space and provides access to data files.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cs.lbl.gov/news-media/news/2014/a-comprehensive-look-at-high-performance-parallel-i-o/ | title=A Comprehensive Look at High Performance Parallel I/O | publisher=[[Berkeley Lab]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Storage===
A single file may be stripped across one or more object storage target, which increases the bandwidth while accessing the file and available disk space.&lt;ref&gt;http://calcul.math.cnrs.fr/Documents/Manifestations/CIRA2011/2011-01_haefele_parallel_IO-workshop_Lyon.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The caches are larger in Parallel I/O and shared through distributed memory systems.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/OLCF-Data-Intro-IO-Gerber-FINAL.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://cs.lbl.gov/news-media/news/2014/a-comprehensive-look-at-high-performance-parallel-i-o/ | title=A Comprehensive Look at High Performance Parallel I/O}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://hdfgroup.org/wp/2015/04/parallel-io-why-how-and-where-to-hdf5/ | title=Parallel I/O – Why, How, and Where to?| date=2015-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Teng Wang|author2=Kevin Vasko|author3=Zhuo Liu|author4=Hui Chen|author5=Weikuan Yu|title=Enhance parallel input/output with cross-bundle aggregation|journal=The International Journal of High Performance Computing Applications|volume=30|issue=2|pages=241–256|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Breakthroughs===
Companies have been running Parallel I/O on their servers to achieve results with regard to price and performance. Parallel processing is especially critical for scientific calculations where applications are not only CPU but also are I/O bound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-01970-8_9#page-1 | doi=10.1007/978-3-642-01970-8_9 | title=Benefits of Parallel I/O in Ab Initio Nuclear Physics Calculations | journal=Lecture Notes in Computer Science | volume=5544 | pages=84–93| isbn=9783642019692 | date=2009-05-25 | last1=Laghave | first1=Nikhil | last2=Sosonkina | first2=Masha | last3=Maris | first3=Pieter | last4=Vary | first4=James P. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[signal processing]], a '''passthrough''' is a [[logic gate]] that enables a signal to "pass through" unaltered, sometimes with little alteration.  Sometimes the concept of a "passthrough" can also involve [[daisy chain (electrical engineering)|daisy chain]] logic.

==Examples of passthroughs==
*[[Analog passthrough]] (for [[digital TV]])
*[[Sega 32X]] (passthrough for [[Sega Genesis]] video games)
*[[VCR]]s, [[DVD recorder]]s, etc. act as a "pass-through" for [[composite video]] and [[S-video]], though sometimes they act as an [[RF modulator]] for use on [[Channel 3/4 input|Channel 3]].
*[[Tape monitor]] features allow an [[AV receiver]] (sometime the recording device itself) to act as a "pass-through" for audio.

==See also==
*[[Dongle]], a device that converts signal, instead of just being a "passthrough" for unaltered signal

A '''planet''' is an [[astronomical body]] [[orbit]]ing a [[star]] or [[Stellar evolution#Stellar remnants|stellar remnant]] that is massive enough to be [[Hydrostatic equilibrium|rounded]] by its own [[gravity]], is not massive enough to cause [[thermonuclear fusion]], and has [[Clearing the neighbourhood|cleared its neighbouring region]] of [[planetesimal]]s.&lt;ref group="lower-alpha" name="footnoteA"&gt;This [[Definition of planet|definition]] is drawn from two separate [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] declarations; a formal definition agreed by the IAU in 2006, and an informal working definition established by the IAU in 2001/2003 for objects outside of the Solar System. The official [[2006 definition of planet|2006 definition]] applies only to the Solar System, whereas the 2003 definition applies to planets around other stars. The extrasolar planet issue was deemed too complex to resolve at the 2006 IAU conference.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IAU"&gt;{{cite web |title=IAU 2006 General Assembly: Result of the IAU Resolution votes |url=http://www.iau.org/news/pressreleases/detail/iau0603/ |publisher=International Astronomical Union |date=2006 |accessdate=2009-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WSGESP"&gt;{{cite web|date=2001 |title=Working Group on Extrasolar Planets (WGESP) of the International Astronomical Union |work=IAU |url=http://www.dtm.ciw.edu/boss/definition.html |accessdate=2008-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060916161707/http://www.dtm.ciw.edu/boss/definition.html |archivedate=2006-09-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''planet'' is ancient, with ties to history, [[astrology]], science, [[mythology]], and religion. Five planets in the [[Solar System]] are visible to the [[naked eye]]. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of [[deity|deities]]. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) officially adopted a resolution [[IAU definition of planet|defining planets]] within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of [[#Planetary-mass objects|planetary mass]] based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain "planets" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], [[2 Pallas|Pallas]], [[3 Juno|Juno]] and [[4 Vesta|Vesta]] (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and [[Pluto]] (the first [[trans-Neptunian object]] discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such.

The planets were thought by [[Ptolemy]] to orbit [[Earth]] in [[deferent and epicycle]] motions. Although the idea that the [[heliocentrism|planets orbited the Sun]] had been suggested many times, it was not until the 17th century that this view was supported by evidence from the first [[optical telescope|telescopic]] [[observational astronomy|astronomical observations]], performed by [[Galileo Galilei]]. At about the same time, by careful analysis of pre-telescopic observational data collected by [[Tycho Brahe]], [[Johannes Kepler]] found the planets' orbits were [[elliptic orbit|elliptical]] rather than [[circular orbit|circular]]. As observational tools improved, [[astronomer]]s saw that, like Earth, each of the planets rotated around an axis [[axial tilt|tilted]] with respect to its [[orbital pole]], and some shared such features as [[ice cap]]s and [[season]]s. Since the dawn of the [[Space Age]], close observation by [[space probe]]s has found that Earth and the other planets share characteristics such as [[volcano|volcanism]], [[hurricane]]s, [[tectonics]], and even [[hydrology]].

Planets are generally divided into two main types: large low-density [[giant planet]]s, and smaller rocky [[terrestrial planet|terrestrials]]. There are eight planets in the Solar System.&lt;ref name="IAU"/&gt; In order of increasing distance from the [[Sun]], they are the four terrestrials, [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], Earth, and [[Mars]], then the four giant planets, [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], and [[Neptune]]. Six of the planets are orbited by one or more [[natural satellite]]s.

Several thousands of planets around other stars ("[[#Exoplanets|extrasolar planets]]" or "exoplanets") have been discovered in the [[Milky Way]]. As of {{Extrasolar planet counts|asof}}, {{Extrasolar planet counts|planet_count}} known extrasolar planets in {{Extrasolar planet counts|system_count}} [[planetary systems]] (including {{Extrasolar planet counts|multiplanetsystem_count}} [[List of multiplanetary systems|multiple planetary systems]]), ranging in size from [[Kepler-37b|just above the size of the Moon]] to [[gas giant]]s [[WASP-17b|about twice as large as Jupiter]] have been discovered, out of which more than 100 planets are the same [[Earth radius|size as Earth]], nine of which are at the same [[astronomical unit|relative distance]] from their star as Earth from the Sun, i.e. in the [[circumstellar habitable zone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/05/10/kepler-finds-new-planets/84187098/|title=NASA discovery doubles the number of known planets|date=10 May 2016|work=[[USA TODAY]] |access-date=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia"&gt;{{cite web |title=Interactive Extra-solar Planets Catalog |work=[[The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia]] |url=http://exoplanet.eu/catalog.php |last=Schneider |first=Jean |date=16 January 2013 |access-date=2013-01-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 20, 2011, the [[Kepler (spacecraft)|Kepler Space Telescope]] team reported the discovery of the first Earth-sized extrasolar planets, [[Kepler-20e]]&lt;ref name="Kepler20e-20111220"&gt;{{cite web |author=NASA Staff |author-link=NASA |title=Kepler: A Search For Habitable Planets – Kepler-20e |url=http://kepler.nasa.gov/Mission/discoveries/kepler20e/ |date=20 December 2011 |publisher=[[NASA]] |access-date=2011-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kepler-20f]],&lt;ref name="Kepler20f-20111220"&gt;{{cite web |author=NASA Staff |author-link=NASA |title=Kepler: A Search For Habitable Planets – Kepler-20f |url=http://kepler.nasa.gov/Mission/discoveries/kepler20f/ |date=20 December 2011 |publisher=[[NASA]] |access-date=2011-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; orbiting a [[Solar analog|Sun-like star]], [[Kepler-20]].&lt;ref name="NASA-20111220"&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson |first=Michele |title=NASA Discovers First Earth-size Planets Beyond Our Solar System|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/news/kepler-20-system.html|publisher=[[NASA]]|date=20 December 2011 |accessdate=2011-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nature-20111220"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hand |first=Eric |title=Kepler discovers first Earth-sized exoplanets |doi=10.1038/nature.2011.9688 |date=20 December 2011 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20111220"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |title=Two Earth-Size Planets Are Discovered |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/21/science/space/nasas-kepler-spacecraft-discovers-2-earth-size-planets.html|date=20 December 2011 |publisher=New York Times |access-date=2011-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 study, analyzing [[gravitational microlensing]] data, estimates an average of at least 1.6 bound planets for every star in the Milky Way.&lt;ref name="nature.com"&gt;{{cite journal |display-authors=4 |last1=Cassan |first1=Arnaud |author2=D.

[[File:Ptolemaicsystem-small.png|thumb|Printed rendition of a geocentric cosmological model from ''Cosmographia'', Antwerp, 1539]]

The idea of planets has evolved over its history, from the divine lights of antiquity to the earthly objects of the scientific age. The concept has expanded to include worlds not only in the Solar System, but in hundreds of other extrasolar systems. The ambiguities inherent in defining planets have led to much scientific controversy.

The five [[classical planet]]s, being visible to the naked eye, have been known since ancient times and have had a significant impact on [[mythology]], [[religious cosmology]], and ancient [[astronomy]]. In ancient times, astronomers noted how certain lights moved across the sky, as opposed to the "[[fixed stars]]", which maintained a constant relative position in the sky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ancient Greek Astronomy and Cosmology|publisher=[[The Library of Congress]]|url=https://www.loc.gov/collections/finding-our-place-in-the-cosmos-with-carl-sagan/articles-and-essays/modeling-the-cosmos/ancient-greek-astronomy-and-cosmology|accessdate=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Greeks called these lights {{lang|grc|[[wikt:πλάνης|πλάνητες]] [[wikt:ἀστήρ|ἀστέρες]]}} ({{Transl|grc|''planētes asteres''}}, "wandering stars") or simply {{lang|grc|[[wikt:πλανήτης#Ancient Greek|πλανῆται]]}} ({{Transl|grc|''planētai''}}, "wanderers"),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0058%3Aentry%3Dplanh%2Fths πλανήτης], H.

The first civilization known to have a functional theory of the planets were the [[Babylonia]]ns, who lived in [[Mesopotamia]] in the first and second millennia BC.

The ancient Greeks initially did not attach as much significance to the planets as the Babylonians. The [[Pythagoreans]], in the 6th and 5th centuries BC appear to have developed their own independent planetary theory, which consisted of the Earth, Sun, Moon, and planets revolving around a "Central Fire" at the center of the Universe. [[Pythagoras]] or [[Parmenides]] is said to have been the first to identify the evening star ([[Hesperos]]) and morning star ([[Phosphoros]]) as one and the same ([[Aphrodite]], Greek corresponding to Latin [[Venus]]),&lt;ref name="burnet"&gt;{{cite book | first=John |last=Burnet |title= Greek philosophy: Thales to Plato |date=1950 |publisher=Macmillan and Co. |pages=7–11 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=7yUAmmqHHEgC&amp;pg=PR4 |accessdate=2008-02-07 |isbn=978-1-4067-6601-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this had long been known by the Babylonians. In the 3rd century BC, [[Aristarchus of Samos]] proposed a [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] system, according to which Earth and the planets revolved around the Sun. The geocentric system remained dominant until the [[Scientific Revolution]]. 

By the 1st century BC, during the [[Hellenistic period]], the Greeks had begun to develop their own mathematical schemes for predicting the positions of the planets. These schemes, which were based on geometry rather than the arithmetic of the Babylonians, would eventually eclipse the Babylonians' theories in complexity and comprehensiveness, and account for most of the astronomical movements observed from Earth with the naked eye. These theories would reach their fullest expression in the ''[[Almagest]]'' written by [[Ptolemy]] in the 2nd century CE. So complete was the domination of Ptolemy's model that it superseded all previous works on astronomy and remained the definitive astronomical text in the Western world for 13 centuries.&lt;ref name="practice" /&gt;&lt;ref name="almagest" /&gt; To the Greeks and Romans there were seven known planets, each presumed to be [[Geocentric model|circling Earth]] according to the complex laws laid out by Ptolemy.

[[Cicero]], in his ''[[De Natura Deorum]]'', enumerated the planets known during the 1st century BCE using the names for them in use at the time:&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, [http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/cicero-on-the-nature-of-the-gods De Natura Deorum].&lt;/ref&gt;
:"But there is most matter for wonder in the movements of the five stars which are falsely called wandering; falsely, because nothing wanders which through all eternity preserves its forward and retrograde courses, and its other movements, constant and unaltered. ... For instance, the star which is farthest from the earth, which is known as the star of Saturn, and is called by the Greeks Φαέθων ([[Phainon]]), accomplishes its course in about thirty years, and though in that course it does much that is wonderful, first preceding the sun, and then falling off in speed, becoming invisible at the hour of evening, and returning to view in the morning, it never through the unending ages of time makes any variation, but performs the same movements at the same times. Beneath it, and nearer to the earth, moves the planet of Jupiter, which is called in Greek Φαέθων ([[Phaethon]]); it completes the same round of the twelve signs in twelve years, and performs in its course the same variations as the planet of Saturn. The circle next below it is held by Πυρόεις ([[Pyroeis]]), which is called the planet of Mars, and traverses the same round as the two planets above it in four and twenty months, all but, I think, six days. Beneath this is the planet of Mercury, which is called by the Greeks Στίλβων ([[Stilbon]]); it traverses the round of the zodiac in about the time of the year’s revolution, and never withdraws more than one sign’s distance from the sun, moving at one time in advance of it, and at another in its rear. The lowest of the five wandering stars, and the one nearest the earth, is the planet of Venus, which is called Φωσϕόρος ([[Phosphoros]]) in Greek, and [[Lucifer]] in Latin, when it is preceding the sun, but Ἕσπερος ([[Hesperos]]) when it is following it; it completes its course in a year, traversing the zodiac both latitudinally and longitudinally, as is also done by the planets above it, and on whichever side of the sun it is, it never departs more than two signs’ distance from it."

{{Main|Indian astronomy|Hindu cosmology}}

In 499 CE, the Indian astronomer [[Aryabhata]] propounded a planetary model that explicitly incorporated [[Earth's rotation]] about its axis, which he explains as the cause of what appears to be an apparent westward motion of the stars. He also believed that the orbits of planets are [[Ellipse|elliptical]].&lt;ref&gt;J. J. O'Connor and E. F. Robertson, [http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Aryabhata_I.html Aryabhata the Elder], [[MacTutor History of Mathematics archive]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
Aryabhata's followers were particularly strong in [[South India]], where his principles of the diurnal rotation of Earth, among others, were followed and a number of secondary works were based on them.&lt;ref&gt;[[K. V. Sarma|Sarma, K. V.]] (1997) "Astronomy in India" in [[Helaine Selin|Selin, Helaine]] (editor) ''Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures'', Kluwer Academic Publishers, {{ISBN|0-7923-4066-3}}, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1500, [[Nilakantha Somayaji]] of the [[Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics]], in his ''[[Tantrasangraha]]'', revised Aryabhata's model.&lt;ref name="MOPM"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Model of planetary motion in the works of Kerala astronomers |last=Ramasubramanian |first=K. |journal=Bulletin of the Astronomical Society of India |volume=26 |pages=11–31 [23–4] |date=1998 |bibcode=1998BASI...26...11R}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Aryabhatiyabhasya'', a commentary on Aryabhata's ''Aryabhatiya'', he developed a planetary model where Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn orbit the Sun, which in turn orbits Earth, similar to the [[Tychonic system]] later proposed by [[Tycho Brahe]] in the late 16th century. Most astronomers of the Kerala school who followed him accepted his planetary model.&lt;ref name="MOPM" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramasubramanian etc. (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of the [[Scientific Revolution]], use of the term "planet" changed from something that moved across the sky (in relation to the [[Fixed stars|star field]]); to a body that orbited Earth (or that was believed to do so at the time); and by the 18th&lt;!--in the 16th &amp; 17th c. there were many other planets--&gt; century to something that directly orbited the Sun when the [[heliocentric model]] of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]], [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] and [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] gained sway.

Thus, Earth became included in the list of planets,&lt;ref name="galileo_project" /&gt; whereas the Sun and Moon were excluded. At first, when the first satellites of Jupiter and Saturn were discovered in the 17th century, the terms "planet" and "satellite" were used interchangeably – although the latter would gradually become more prevalent in the following century.&lt;ref&gt;See primary citations in [[Timeline of discovery of Solar System planets and their moons#References|Timeline of discovery of Solar System planets and their moons]]&lt;/ref&gt; Until the mid-19th century, the number of "planets" rose rapidly because any newly discovered object directly orbiting the Sun was listed as a planet by the scientific community.

In the 19th century astronomers began to realize that recently discovered bodies that had been classified as planets for almost half a century (such as [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], [[2 Pallas|Pallas]], [[3 Juno|Juno]], and [[4 Vesta|Vesta]]) were very different from the traditional ones. These bodies shared the same region of space between Mars and Jupiter (the [[asteroid belt]]), and had a much smaller mass; as a result they were reclassified as "[[asteroid]]s". In the absence of any formal definition, a "planet" came to be understood as any "large" body that orbited the Sun. Because there was a dramatic size gap between the asteroids and the planets, and the spate of new discoveries seemed to have ended after the discovery of Neptune in 1846, there was no apparent need to have a formal definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Hilton |first =James L. |date = 2001-09-17 |url =http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/minorplanets.php |title =When Did the Asteroids Become Minor Planets? |publisher =U.S. Naval Observatory |accessdate = 2007-04-08 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070921162818/http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/minorplanets.php |archivedate = 2007-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, astronomers [[Aleksander Wolszczan]] and [[Dale Frail]] announced the discovery of planets around a [[pulsar]], [[PSR B1257+12]].&lt;ref name="Wolszczan" /&gt; This discovery is generally considered to be the first definitive detection of a planetary system around another star. Then, on October 6, 1995, [[Michel Mayor]] and [[Didier Queloz]] of the [[Geneva Observatory]] announced the first definitive detection of an exoplanet orbiting an ordinary [[main sequence|main-sequence]] star ([[51 Pegasi]]).&lt;ref name="Mayor"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Mayor |first1=Michel |author2=Queloz, Didier | title=A Jupiter-mass companion to a solar-type star | journal=Nature | date=1995 | volume=378 | issue=6356 | pages=355–359 | doi= 10.1038/378355a0 | bibcode=1995Natur.378..355M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery of extrasolar planets led to another ambiguity in defining a planet: the point at which a planet becomes a star. Many known extrasolar planets are many times the mass of Jupiter, approaching that of stellar objects known as [[brown dwarf]]s. Brown dwarfs are generally considered stars due to their ability to fuse [[deuterium]], a heavier isotope of [[hydrogen]]. Although objects more massive than 75 times that of Jupiter fuse hydrogen, objects of only 13 Jupiter masses can fuse deuterium. Deuterium is quite rare, and most brown dwarfs would have ceased fusing deuterium long before their discovery, making them effectively indistinguishable from supermassive planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Basri |first=Gibor |title= Observations of Brown Dwarfs |journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics |date=2000 |volume=38 | issue=1 |pages=485–519 |doi=10.1146/annurev.astro.38.1.485 |bibcode=2000ARA&amp;A..38..485B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 21st century ===

With the discovery during the latter half of the 20th century of more objects within the Solar System and large objects around other stars, disputes arose over what should constitute a planet. There were particular disagreements over whether an object should be considered a planet if it was part of a distinct population such as a [[asteroid belt|belt]], or if it was large enough to generate energy by the [[thermonuclear fusion]] of [[deuterium]].

A growing number of astronomers argued for Pluto to be declassified as a planet, because many similar objects approaching its size had been found in the same region of the Solar System (the [[Kuiper belt]]) during the 1990s and early 2000s. Pluto was found to be just one small body in a population of thousands.

Some of them, such as [[50000 Quaoar|Quaoar]], [[90377 Sedna|Sedna]], and [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], were heralded in the popular press as the [[tenth planet]], failing to receive widespread scientific recognition. The announcement of Eris in 2005, an object then thought of as 27% more massive than Pluto, created the necessity and public desire for an official definition of a planet.

Acknowledging the problem, the IAU set about creating the [[IAU definition of planet|definition of planet]], and produced one in August 2006. The number of planets dropped to the eight significantly larger bodies that had [[Clearing the neighbourhood|cleared their orbit]] (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune), and a new class of [[dwarf planet]]s was created, initially containing three objects ([[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], [[Pluto]] and Eris).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Green |first=D.

==== Extrasolar planets ====

There is no official definition of [[extrasolar planet]]s.  In 2003, the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) Working Group on Extrasolar Planets issued a position statement, but this position statement was never proposed as an official IAU resolution and was never voted on by IAU members.  The positions statement incorporates the following guidelines, mostly focused upon the boundary between planets and brown dwarfs:&lt;ref name="WSGESP" /&gt;
# Objects with [[true mass]]es below the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium (currently calculated to be 13 times the mass of Jupiter for objects with the same [[natural abundance|isotopic abundance]] as the Sun&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Saumon |first1=D. |display-authors=4 |author2=Hubbard, W. B. |author3=Burrows, A. |author4=Guillot, T. |author5=Lunine, J. I. |author6=Chabrier, G. |title=A Theory of Extrasolar Giant Planets |journal=Astrophysical Journal |date=1996 |volume=460 |pages=993–1018 |bibcode=1996ApJ...460..993S |doi=10.1086/177027|arxiv = astro-ph/9510046 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) that orbit stars or stellar remnants are "planets" (no matter how they formed). The minimum mass and size required for an extrasolar object to be considered a planet should be the same as that used in the Solar System.
# Substellar objects with true masses above the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium are "[[brown dwarf]]s", no matter how they formed or where they are located.
# Free-floating objects in young [[star cluster]]s with masses below the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium are not "planets", but are "sub-brown dwarfs" (or whatever name is most appropriate).

This working definition has since been widely used by astronomers when publishing discoveries of exoplanets in [[academic journal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See for example the list of references for: {{cite web | author=Butler, R. P.  | display-authors=etal |date=2006 |url=http://exoplanets.org/ |title=Catalog of Nearby Exoplanets |publisher =University of California and the Carnegie Institution |accessdate = 2008-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although temporary, it remains an effective working definition until a more permanent one is formally adopted. It does not address the dispute over the lower mass limit,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spacedaily.com/news/outerplanets-04b.html |title=Gravity Rules: The Nature and Meaning of Planethood |last=Stern |first=S. Alan |date=2004-03-22 |publisher=SpaceDaily |accessdate=2008-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so it steered clear of the controversy regarding objects within the Solar System. This definition also makes no comment on the planetary status of objects orbiting brown dwarfs, such as [[2M1207b]].

One definition of a [[sub-brown dwarf]] is a planet-mass object that formed through [[cloud collapse]] rather than [[accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]]. This formation distinction between a sub-brown dwarf and a planet is not universally agreed upon; astronomers are divided into two camps as whether to consider the formation process of a planet as part of its division in classification.&lt;ref name="Cha110913"&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2006-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; One reason for the dissent is that often it may not be possible to determine the formation process. For example, a planet formed by [[accretion disc|accretion]] around a star may get ejected from the system to become free-floating, and likewise a sub-brown dwarf that formed on its own in a star cluster through cloud collapse may get captured into orbit around a star.

The 13 Jupiter-mass cutoff represents an average mass rather than a precise threshold value. Large objects will fuse most of their deuterium and smaller ones will fuse only a little, and the 13 {{Jupiter mass}} value is somewhere in between. In fact, calculations show that an object fuses 50% of its initial deuterium content when the total mass ranges between 12 and 14 {{Jupiter mass}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bodenheimer|first1=Peter|last2=D'Angelo|first2=Gennaro|last3=Lissauer|first3=Jack J.|last4=Fortney|first4=Jonathan J.|last5=Saumon|first5=Didier|title=Deuterium Burning in Massive Giant Planets and Low-mass Brown Dwarfs Formed by Core-nucleated Accretion|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=20 June 2013|volume=770|issue=2|pages=120|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/770/2/120|arxiv = 1305.0980 |bibcode = 2013ApJ...770..120B }}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of deuterium fused depends not only on mass but also on the composition of the object, on the amount of [[helium]] and [[deuterium]] present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1008.5150 |author1=Spiegel |author2=Adam Burrows |author3=Milsom |title=The Deuterium-Burning Mass Limit for Brown Dwarfs and Giant Planets |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=727 |pages=57 |date=2010|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/727/1/57 |bibcode=2011ApJ...727...57S }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia]] includes objects up to 25 Jupiter masses, saying, "The fact that there is no special feature around 13 {{Jupiter mass}} in the observed mass spectrum reinforces the choice to forget this mass limit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schneider |first1=J. |display-authors=4 |last2=Dedieu |first2=C. |last3=Le Sidaner |first3=P. |last4=Savalle |first4=R. |last5=Zolotukhin |first5=I. |title=Defining and cataloging exoplanets: The exoplanet.eu database|date=2011|volume=532|issue=79|journal=[[Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics]] |arxiv=1106.0586|doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201116713|pages=A79|bibcode=2011A&amp;A...532A..79S}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Exoplanet Data Explorer]] includes objects up to 24 Jupiter masses with the advisory: "The 13 Jupiter-mass distinction by the IAU Working Group is physically unmotivated for planets with rocky cores, and observationally problematic due to the sin i ambiguity."&lt;ref name=eod&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=1012.5676v1|last1=Wright |first1=J.

Another criterion for separating planets and brown dwarfs, rather than deuterium fusion, formation process or location, is whether the core [[pressure]] is dominated by [[Lateral earth pressure#Coulomb theory|coulomb pressure]] or [[electron degeneracy pressure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.earth.34.031405.125058 |journal=Annu.

==== 2006 IAU definition of planet ====
{{Main|IAU definition of planet}}
[[File:Euler diagram of solar system bodies.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|right|[[Euler diagram]] showing the types of bodies in the Solar System.]]

The matter of the lower limit was addressed during the 2006 meeting of the [[International Astronomical Union#The XXVIth General Assembly and the definition of a planet|IAU's General Assembly]]. After much debate and one failed proposal, a large majority of those remaining at the meeting voted to pass a resolution. The 2006 resolution defines planets within the Solar System as follows:&lt;ref name="IAU"/&gt;

{{quotation|A "planet" [1] is a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the Sun, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] (nearly round) shape, and (c) has [[clearing the neighbourhood|cleared the neighbourhood]] around its orbit.&lt;br /&gt;
[1] The eight planets are: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
}}

Under this definition, the Solar System is considered to have eight planets. Bodies that fulfill the first two conditions but not the third (such as Ceres, Pluto, and Eris) are classified as [[dwarf planet]]s, provided they are not also [[natural satellite]]s of other planets. Originally an IAU committee had proposed a definition that would have included a much larger number of planets as it did not include (c) as a criterion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4795755.stm |title=Planets plan boosts tally 12 |publisher=BBC |date=2006-08-16 |accessdate=2008-08-23 |first=Paul |last=Rincon}}&lt;/ref&gt; After much discussion, it was decided via a vote that those bodies should instead be classified as dwarf planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/5282440.stm |publisher=BBC |title=Pluto loses status as a planet |date=2006-08-24 |accessdate=2008-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This definition is based in theories of planetary formation, in which planetary embryos initially clear their orbital neighborhood of other smaller objects. As described by astronomer [[Steven Soter]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Soter |first = Steven |title = What is a Planet |journal = Astronomical Journal |volume = 132 |issue = 6 |pages = 2513–19 |date = 2006 |doi=10.1086/508861 |arxiv=astro-ph/0608359 |bibcode=2006AJ....132.2513S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"The end product of secondary disk accretion is a small number of relatively large bodies (planets) in either non-intersecting or resonant orbits, which prevent collisions between them. Minor planets and comets, including KBOs [Kuiper belt objects], differ from planets in that they can collide with each other and with planets."

The 2006 IAU definition presents some challenges for exoplanets because the language is specific to the Solar System and because the criteria of roundness and orbital zone clearance are not presently observable.  Astronomer [[Jean-Luc Margot]] proposed a mathematical criterion that determines whether an object can clear its orbit during the lifetime of its host star, based on the mass of the planet, its semimajor axis, and the mass of its host star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/11/151110134519.htm|title=Simpler way to define what makes a planet|date=2015-11-10|publisher=Science Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why we need a new definition of the word 'planet'|url=http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-new-planet-definition-margot-20151113-htmlstory.html|work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This formula produces a value &lt;big&gt;π&lt;/big&gt; that is greater than 1 for planets.  The eight known planets and all known exoplanets have &lt;big&gt;π&lt;/big&gt; values above 100, while Ceres, Pluto, and Eris have &lt;big&gt;π&lt;/big&gt; values of 0.1 or less.  Objects with &lt;big&gt;π&lt;/big&gt; values of 1 or more are also expected to be approximately spherical, so that objects that fulfill the orbital zone clearance requirement automatically fulfill the roundness requirement.&lt;ref name=Margot&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015|title=A Quantitative Criterion For Defining Planets|journal=The Astronomical Journal|volume=150|issue=6|pages=185|author=Jean-Luc Margot |arxiv=1507.06300|doi=10.1088/0004-6256/150/6/185|bibcode=2015AJ....150..185M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mythology and naming ==
{{see also|Weekday names|Naked-eye planet}}
[[File:Olympians.jpg|thumb|upright|The Greek gods of [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]], after whom the [[Solar System]]'s  Roman names of the planets are derived]]

The names for the planets in the Western world are derived from the naming practices of the Romans, which ultimately derive from those of the Greeks and the Babylonians. In [[ancient Greece]], the two great luminaries the Sun and the Moon were called ''[[Helios]]'' and ''[[Selene]]''; the farthest planet (Saturn) was called ''[[Phaenon|Phainon]]'', the shiner; followed by ''[[Phaethon]]'' (Jupiter), "bright"; the red planet (Mars) was known as ''[[Pyroeis]]'', the "fiery"; the brightest (Venus) was known as ''[[Phosphorus (morning star)|Phosphoros]]'', the light bringer; and the fleeting final planet (Mercury) was called ''[[Stilbon (mythology)|Stilbon]]'', the gleamer. The Greeks also made each planet sacred to one among their pantheon of gods, the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympians]]: Helios and Selene were the names of both planets and gods; Phainon was sacred to [[Cronus]], the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] who fathered the Olympians; Phaethon was sacred to [[Zeus]], Cronus's son who deposed him as king; Pyroeis was given to [[Ares]], son of Zeus and god of war; Phosphoros was ruled by [[Aphrodite]], the goddess of love; and [[Hermes]], messenger of the gods and god of learning and wit, ruled over Stilbon.&lt;ref name="practice"&gt;{{cite book |title=The History and Practice of Ancient Astronomy |first=James |last=Evans |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1998 |pages=296–7 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=nS51_7qbEWsC&amp;pg=PA17
|accessdate=2008-02-04 |isbn=978-0-19-509539-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek practice of grafting of their gods' names onto the planets was almost certainly borrowed from the Babylonians. The Babylonians named [[Hesperus#Variant names|Phosphoros]] after their goddess of love, ''[[Ishtar]]''; Pyroeis after their god of war, ''[[Nergal]]'', Stilbon after their god of wisdom [[Nabu]], and Phaethon after their chief god, ''[[Marduk]]''.&lt;ref name="nergal"&gt;{{cite web |first=Kelley L. |last=Ross |date=2005 |title=The Days of the Week |url=http://www.friesian.com/week.htm |publisher=The Friesian School |accessdate=2008-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are too many concordances between Greek and Babylonian naming conventions for them to have arisen separately.&lt;ref name="practice" /&gt; The translation was not perfect. For instance, the Babylonian Nergal was a god of war, and thus the Greeks identified him with Ares. Unlike Ares, Nergal was also god of pestilence and the underworld.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Martian Metamorphoses: The Planet Mars in Ancient Myth and Tradition |first=Ev |last=Cochrane |date=1997 |publisher=Aeon Press |url=https://books.google.com/?id=jz3eqRGuM0wC&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=ares+nergal+planet+pestilence |accessdate=2008-02-07 |isbn=0-9656229-0-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, most people in the western world know the planets by names derived from the Olympian pantheon of gods. Although modern Greeks still use their ancient names for the planets, other European languages, because of the influence of the [[Roman Empire]] and, later, the [[Catholic Church]], use the Roman (Latin) names rather than the Greek ones. The Romans, who, like the Greeks, were [[Indo-European mythology|Indo-Europeans]], shared with them a [[Roman mythology|common pantheon]] under different names but lacked the rich narrative traditions that Greek poetic culture had given [[Greek mythology|their gods]]. During the later period of the [[Roman Republic]], Roman writers borrowed much of the Greek narratives and applied them to their own pantheon, to the point where they became virtually indistinguishable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Greek Mythography in the Roman World |first=Alan |last=Cameron |date=2005 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-517121-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Romans studied Greek astronomy, they gave the planets their own gods' names: ''[[Mercury (mythology)|Mercurius]]'' (for Hermes), ''[[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]'' (Aphrodite), ''[[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]'' (Ares), ''[[Jupiter (mythology)|Iuppiter]]'' (Zeus) and ''[[Saturn (mythology)|Saturnus]]'' (Cronus). When subsequent planets were discovered in the 18th and 19th centuries, the naming practice was retained with ''[[Neptune (mythology)|Neptūnus]]'' ([[Poseidon]]). Uranus is unique in that it is named for a [[Uranus (mythology)|Greek deity]] rather than his [[Caelus|Roman counterpart]].

Some [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], following a belief possibly originating in [[Mesopotamia]] but developed in [[Hellenistic Egypt]],&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Bill |last=Arnett |date=2006 |title=Appendix 5: Planetary Linguistics |url=http://www.nineplanets.org/days.html |publisher=www.nineplanets.org |accessdate=2008-02-02}}{{Verify credibility|date=February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; believed that the seven gods after whom the planets were named took hourly shifts in looking after affairs on Earth. The order of shifts went Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon (from the farthest to the closest planet).&lt;ref name="zerubavel"&gt;{{cite book | first=Eviatar |last=Zerubavel |date=1989 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-98165-7 |title= The Seven Day Circle: The History and Meaning of the Week |page=14 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=aGahKeojIUoC&amp;pg=PA14 |accessdate=2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the first day was started by Saturn (1st hour), second day by Sun (25th hour), followed by Moon (49th hour), Mars, Mercury, Jupiter and Venus. Because each day was named by the god that started it, this is also the order of the [[Week-day names|days of the week]] in the [[Roman calendar]] after the [[Roman Calendar#Nundinal cycle|Nundinal cycle]] was rejected – and still preserved in many modern languages.&lt;ref name="weekdays"&gt;{{cite journal | first=Michael |last=Falk |title=Astronomical Names for the Days of the Week |journal=Journal of the [[Royal Astronomical Society of Canada]] |date=1999 |volume=93 |pages=122–133 |bibcode=1999JRASC..93..122F |doi=10.1016/j.newast.2003.07.002 | last2=Koresko | first2=Christopher|arxiv=astro-ph/0307398 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In English, ''Saturday, Sunday,'' and ''Monday'' are straightforward translations of these Roman names. The other days were renamed after ''[[Týr|Tiw]]'' (Tuesday), ''[[Woden|Wóden]]'' (Wednesday), ''[[Thor|Thunor]]'' (Thursday), and ''[[Frige|Fríge]]'' (Friday), the [[Anglo-Saxon gods]] considered similar or equivalent to Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, and Venus, respectively.

Earth is the only planet whose name in English is not derived from Greco-Roman mythology. Because it was only generally accepted as a planet in the 17th century,&lt;ref name="galileo_project"&gt;{{cite web | last=Van Helden |first=Al |date=1995 |url=http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/theories/copernican_system.html |title=Copernican System |publisher=The Galileo Project |accessdate=2008-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is no tradition of naming it after a god. (The same is true, in English at least, of the Sun and the Moon, though they are no longer generally considered planets.)

Many of the [[Romance languages]] retain the old Roman word ''[[Terra (mythology)|terra]]'' (or some variation of it) that was used with the meaning of "dry land" as opposed to "sea".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Harper |first=Douglas |date=September 2001 |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=terrain |title=Etymology of "terrain" |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=2008-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The non-Romance languages use their own native words. The Greeks retain their original name, ''[[Gaia (mythology)|Γή]]'' ''(Ge)''.

Non-European cultures use other planetary-naming systems. [[India]] uses a system based on the [[Navagraha]], which incorporates the seven traditional planets ([[Surya]] for the Sun, [[Chandra]] for the Moon, and [[Budha]], [[Shukra]], [[Mangala]], [[Bṛhaspati|{{IAST|Bṛhaspati}}]] and [[Shani]] for Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn) and the ascending and descending [[lunar node]]s [[Rahu]] and [[Ketu (mythology)|Ketu]]. China and the countries of eastern Asia historically subject to [[Chinese cultural sphere|Chinese cultural influence]] (such as Japan, [[Korea]] and [[Vietnam]]) use a naming system based on the [[Wu Xing|five Chinese elements]]: [[Water (classical element)|water]] (Mercury), [[Metal (classical element)|metal]] (Venus), [[Fire (classical element)|fire]] (Mars), [[Wood (classical element)|wood]] (Jupiter) and [[Earth (classical element)|earth]] (Saturn).&lt;ref name="weekdays" /&gt; In traditional [[Hebrew astronomy]], the seven traditional planets have (for the most part) descriptive names - the Sun is חמה ''Ḥammah'' or "the hot one," the Moon is לבנה ''Levanah'' or "the white one," Venus is כוכב נוגה ''Kokhav Nogah'' or "the bright planet," Mercury is כוכב ''Kokhav'' or "the planet" (given its lack of distinguishing features), Mars is מאדים ''Ma'adim'' or "the red one," and Saturn is שבתאי ''Shabbatai'' or "the resting one" (in reference to its slow movement compared to the other visible planets).&lt;ref name=Hebrew&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stieglitz|first1=Robert|title=The Hebrew Names of the Seven Planets|journal=Journal of Near Eastern Studies|date=Apr 1981|volume=40|issue=2|pages=135–137|doi=10.1086/372867|jstor=545038}}&lt;/ref&gt; The odd one out is Jupiter, called צדק ''Tzedeq'' or "justice."

== Formation ==
{{Main|Nebular hypothesis}}
[[File:Protoplanetary-disk.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.35|An artist's impression of protoplanetary disk]]
It is not known with certainty how planets are formed. The prevailing theory is that they are formed during the collapse of a [[nebula]] into a thin disk of gas and dust. A [[protostar]] forms at the core, surrounded by a rotating [[protoplanetary disk]]. Through [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]] (a process of sticky collision) dust particles in the disk steadily accumulate mass to form ever-larger bodies. Local concentrations of mass known as [[planetesimal]]s form, and these accelerate the accretion process by drawing in additional material by their gravitational attraction. These concentrations become ever denser until they collapse inward under gravity to form [[protoplanet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=G.

With the discovery and observation of [[planetary system]]s around stars other than the Sun, it is becoming possible to elaborate, revise or even replace this account. The level of [[metallicity]]—an astronomical term describing the abundance of [[chemical element]]s with an [[atomic number]] greater than 2 ([[helium]])—is now thought to determine the likelihood that a star will have planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |first1=David |last1=Aguilar |first2=Christine |last2=Pulliam |date=2004-01-06 |url=http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/news/archive/pr0404.html |title=Lifeless Suns Dominated The Early Universe |publisher=Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics |accessdate=2011-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, it is thought that a metal-rich [[population I star]] will likely have a more substantial planetary system than a metal-poor, [[population II star]].

There are eight planets in the [[Solar System]], which are in increasing distance from the [[Sun]]:

# [[File:Mercury symbol.svg|14px|☿]] '''[[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]'''
# [[File:Venus symbol.svg|14px|♀]] '''[[Venus]]'''

# [[File:Neptune symbol.svg|14px|♆]] '''[[Neptune]]'''

Jupiter is the largest, at 318 Earth masses, whereas Mercury is the smallest, at 0.055 Earth masses.

The planets of the Solar System can be divided into categories based on their composition:
* '''[[Terrestrial planet|Terrestrials]]''': Planets that are similar to Earth, with bodies largely composed of [[Rock (geology)|rock]]: Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. At 0.055 Earth masses, Mercury is the smallest terrestrial planet (and smallest planet) in the Solar System. Earth is the largest terrestrial planet.
* '''[[Giant planet]]s''' (Jovians): Massive planets significantly more massive than the terrestrials: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.
** '''[[Gas giant]]s''', Jupiter and Saturn, are giant planets primarily composed of hydrogen and helium and are the most massive planets in the Solar System. Jupiter, at 318 Earth masses, is the largest planet in the Solar System, and Saturn is one third as massive, at 95 Earth masses.
** '''[[Ice giant]]s''', Uranus and Neptune, are primarily composed of low-boiling-point materials such as water, methane, and ammonia, with thick atmospheres of hydrogen and helium. They have a significantly lower mass than the gas giants (only 14 and 17 Earth masses).

In early 1992, radio astronomers [[Aleksander Wolszczan]] and [[Dale Frail]] announced the discovery of two planets orbiting the [[pulsar]] [[PSR 1257+12]].&lt;ref name="Wolszczan"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wolszczan | first1 = A. |bibcode=1992Natur.355..145W| last2 = Frail | first2 = D.

The first confirmed discovery of an extrasolar planet orbiting an ordinary main-sequence star occurred on 6 October 1995, when [[Michel Mayor]] and [[Didier Queloz]] of the [[University of Geneva]] announced the detection of an exoplanet around [[51 Pegasi]]. From then until the [[Kepler (spacecraft)|Kepler mission]] most known extrasolar planets were gas giants comparable in mass to Jupiter or larger as they were more easily detected. The catalog of Kepler candidate planets consists mostly of planets the size of Neptune and smaller, down to smaller than Mercury.

There are types of planets that do not exist in the Solar System: [[super-Earth]]s and [[mini-Neptune]]s, which could be rocky like Earth or a mixture of volatiles and gas like Neptune—a radius of 1.75 times that of Earth is a possible dividing line between the two types of planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=1311.0329 |last1=Lopez |first1=E.

Another possible type of planet is [[carbon planet]]s, which form in systems with a higher proportion of carbon than in the Solar System.

A 2012 study, analyzing [[gravitational microlensing]] data, estimates an [[Arithmetic mean|average]] of at least 1.6 bound planets for every star in the Milky Way.&lt;ref name="nature.com"/&gt;

The frequency of occurrence of such terrestrial planets is one of the variables in the [[Drake equation]], which estimates the number of [[Extraterrestrial life|intelligent, communicating civilizations]] that exist in the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Drake |first=Frank |title=The Drake Equation Revisited |publisher=Astrobiology Magazine |date=2003-09-29 |url=http://www.astrobio.net/index.php?option=com_retrospection&amp;task=detail&amp;id=610 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628180502/http://www.astrobio.net/index.php?option=com_retrospection&amp;task=detail&amp;id=610 |archivedate=2011-06-28 |accessdate=2008-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are exoplanets that are much closer to their parent star than any planet in the Solar System is to the Sun, and there are also exoplanets that are much farther from their star. [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], the closest planet to the Sun at 0.4 [[astronomical unit|AU]], takes 88 days for an orbit, but the shortest known orbits for exoplanets take only a few hours, e.g. [[Kepler-70b]]. The [[Kepler-11]] system has five of its planets in shorter orbits than Mercury's, all of them much more massive than Mercury. [[Neptune]] is 30 AU from the Sun and takes 165 years to orbit, but there are exoplanets that are hundreds of [[astronomical unit|AU]] from their star and take more than a thousand years to orbit, e.g. [[1RXS1609 b]].

The next few [[space telescope]]s to study exoplanets are expected to be [[Gaia (spacecraft)|Gaia]] launched in December 2013, [[CHEOPS (spacecraft)|CHEOPS]] in 2018, [[Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite|TESS]] in 2018, and the [[James Webb Space Telescope]] in 2021.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; By definition, all planets are ''planetary-mass objects'', but the purpose of this term is to refer to objects that do not conform to typical expectations for a planet. These include [[dwarf planet]]s, which are rounded by their own gravity but not massive enough to [[Clearing the neighbourhood|clear their own orbit]], the larger [[natural satellite|moons]], and free-floating planemos, which may have been ejected from a system ([[rogue planet]]s) or formed through cloud-collapse rather than accretion (sometimes called [[sub-brown dwarf]]s).

=== Dwarf planets ===
{{Main|Dwarf planet}}

A dwarf planet is a planetary-mass object that is neither a true planet nor a natural satellite; it is in direct orbit of a star, and is massive enough for its gravity to compress it into a hydrostatically equilibrious shape (usually a spheroid), but has not cleared the neighborhood of other material around its orbit.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iau.org/static/resolutions/Resolution_GA26-5-6.pdf ''IAU 2006 General Assembly.''

=== Sub-brown dwarfs ===
{{Main|Sub-brown dwarf}}
Stars form via the gravitational collapse of gas clouds, but smaller objects can also form via cloud-collapse. Planetary-mass objects formed this way are sometimes called sub-brown dwarfs. Sub-brown dwarfs may be free-floating such as [[Cha 110913-773444]]&lt;ref name="Luhman" /&gt; and [[OTS 44]],&lt;ref name=joergens2013_AA558&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Joergens|first1=V.|display-authors=4|last2=Bonnefoy|first2=M.|last3=Liu|first3=Y.|last4=Bayo|first4=A.|last5=Wolf|first5=S.|last6=Chauvin|first6=G.|last7=Rojo|first7=P.|title=OTS 44: Disk and accretion at the planetary border|journal=Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics|volume=558|number=7|date=2013|doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201322432|bibcode=2013A&amp;A...558L...7J|arxiv = 1310.1936|pages=L7}}&lt;/ref&gt; or orbiting a larger object such as [[2MASS J04414489+2301513]].

Binary systems of sub-brown dwarfs are theoretically possible; [[Oph 162225-240515]] was initially thought to be a binary system of a brown dwarf of 14 Jupiter masses and a sub-brown dwarf of 7 Jupiter masses, but further observations revised the estimated masses upwards to greater than 13 Jupiter masses, making them brown dwarfs according to the IAU working definitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Wide Brown Dwarf Binary Oph 1622–2405 and Discovery of A Wide, Low Mass Binary in Ophiuchus (Oph 1623–2402): A New Class of Young Evaporating Wide Binaries? |journal= Astrophysical Journal |author=Close, Laird M. |volume=660 | issue=2 |pages=1492–1506 |doi=10.1086/513417 |date=2007 |arxiv=astro-ph/0608574 |bibcode=2007ApJ...660.1492C | display-authors=4 | last2=Zuckerman | first2=B. | last3=Song | first3=Inseok | last4=Barman | first4=Travis | last5=Marois | first5=Christian | last6=Rice | first6=Emily L. | last7=Siegler | first7=Nick | last8=MacIntosh | first8=Bruce | last9=Becklin | first9=E.

=== Former stars ===
In close [[binary star]] systems one of the stars can lose mass to a heavier companion. [[Accretion-powered pulsars]] may drive mass loss. The shrinking star can then become a [[#Planetary-mass objects|planetary-mass object]]. An example is a Jupiter-mass object orbiting the [[pulsar]] [[PSR J1719-1438]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=1108.5201 |bibcode=2011Sci...333.1717B |doi=10.1126/science.1208890 |title=Transformation of a Star into a Planet in a Millisecond Pulsar Binary |date=2011 |last1=Bailes |first1=M. |display-authors=4 |last2=Bates |first2=S.

=== Satellite planets and belt planets ===
Some large satellites (moons) are of similar size or larger than the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], e.g. Jupiter's [[Galilean moons]] and [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]. [[Alan Stern]] has argued that location should not matter and that only geophysical attributes should be taken into account in the definition of a planet, and proposes the term ''satellite planet'' for a planet-sized satellite. Likewise, dwarf planets in the [[asteroid belt]] and [[Kuiper belt]] should be considered planets according to Stern.&lt;ref name="satelliteplanet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.discovery.com/space/should-large-moons-be-called-satellite-planets.html#post-a-comment |title=Should Large Moons Be Called 'Satellite Planets'? |publisher=News.discovery.com |date=2010-05-14 |accessdate=2011-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Captured planets ===
[[Rogue planet]]s in [[Open cluster|stellar clusters]] have similar velocities to the stars and so can be recaptured. They are typically captured into wide orbits between 100 and &lt;!--abstract seems to have a typo 10^6: rest of paper uses 10^5--&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; AU&lt;!--see preceding comment--&gt;. The capture efficiency decreases with increasing cluster volume, and for a given cluster size it increases with the host/primary mass. It is almost independent of the planetary mass. Single and multiple planets could be captured into arbitrary unaligned orbits, non-coplanar with each other or with the stellar host spin, or pre-existing planetary system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.2362 On the origin of planets at very wide orbits from the re-capture of free floating planets], Hagai B. Perets, M. B. N. Kouwenhoven, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Although each planet has unique physical characteristics, a number of broad commonalities do exist among them. Some of these characteristics, such as rings or natural satellites, have only as yet been observed in planets in the Solar System, whereas others are also commonly observed in extrasolar planets.

According to current definitions, all planets must revolve around stars; thus, any potential "[[rogue planet]]s" are excluded. In the Solar System, all the planets orbit the Sun in the same direction as the Sun rotates (counter-clockwise as seen from above the Sun's north pole). At least one extrasolar planet, [[WASP-17b]], has been found to orbit in the opposite direction to its star's rotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = D. R.

No planet's orbit is perfectly circular, and hence the distance of each varies over the course of its year. The closest approach to its star is called its [[periastron]] ([[perihelion]] in the Solar System), whereas its farthest separation from the star is called its [[apastron]] ([[aphelion]]). As a planet approaches periastron, its speed increases as it trades gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy, just as a falling object on Earth accelerates as it falls; as the planet reaches apastron, its speed decreases, just as an object thrown upwards on Earth slows down as it reaches the apex of its trajectory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Dvorak, R. | author2=Kurths, J. | author3=Freistetter, F. |date=2005 |title=Chaos And Stability in Planetary Systems |publisher=Springer |location=New York |isbn=3-540-28208-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each planet's orbit is delineated by a set of elements:
* The ''[[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]]'' of an orbit describes how elongated a planet's orbit is. Planets with low eccentricities have more circular orbits, whereas planets with high eccentricities have more elliptical orbits. The planets in the Solar System have very low eccentricities, and thus nearly circular orbits.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt; Comets and Kuiper belt objects (as well as several extrasolar planets) have very high eccentricities, and thus exceedingly elliptical orbits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Eccentricity evolution of giant planet orbits due to circumstellar disk torques |author=Moorhead, Althea V. |author2=Adams, Fred C. |journal=Icarus |date=2008 |volume=193 |issue=2 |pages=475–484 |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2007.07.009 |arxiv=0708.0335 |bibcode=2008Icar..193..475M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Planets – Kuiper Belt Objects |work=The Astrophysics Spectator |date=2004-12-15 | url=http://www.astrophysicsspectator.com/topics/planets/KuiperBelt.html |accessdate=2008-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[File:Semimajoraxis.svg|thumb|Illustration of the semi-major axis]] The ''[[semi-major axis]]'' is the distance from a planet to the half-way point along the longest diameter of its elliptical orbit (see image). This distance is not the same as its apastron, because no planet's orbit has its star at its exact centre.&lt;ref name="young" /&gt;
* The ''[[inclination]]'' of a planet tells how far above or below an established reference plane its orbit lies. In the Solar System, the reference plane is the plane of Earth's orbit, called the [[ecliptic]]. For extrasolar planets, the plane, known as the ''sky plane'' or ''plane of the sky'', is the plane perpendicular to the observer's line of sight from Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://astrowww.phys.uvic.ca/~tatum/celmechs.html |title=Celestial Mechanics |date=2007 |chapter=17.

The [[argument of periapsis]] (or perihelion in the Solar System) is the angle between a planet's ascending node and its closest approach to its star.&lt;ref name="young" /&gt;

==== Axial tilt ====
{{Main|Axial tilt}}
[[File:AxialTiltObliquity.png|thumb|Earth's [[axial tilt]] is about 23.4°. It oscillates between 22.1° and 24.5° on a 41,000-year cycle and is currently decreasing.]]

Planets also have varying degrees of axial tilt; they lie at an angle to the [[reference plane|plane]] of their [[inclination|stars' equators]]. This causes the amount of light received by each hemisphere to vary over the course of its year; when the northern hemisphere points away from its star, the southern hemisphere points towards it, and vice versa. Each planet therefore has seasons, changes to the climate over the course of its year. The time at which each hemisphere points farthest or nearest from its star is known as its [[solstice]]. Each planet has two in the course of its orbit; when one hemisphere has its summer solstice, when its day is longest, the other has its winter solstice, when its day is shortest. The varying amount of light and heat received by each hemisphere creates annual changes in weather patterns for each half of the planet. Jupiter's axial tilt is very small, so its seasonal variation is minimal; Uranus, on the other hand, has an axial tilt so extreme it is virtually on its side, which means that its hemispheres are either perpetually in sunlight or perpetually in darkness around the time of its solstices.&lt;ref name="Weather"&gt;{{cite web | last=Harvey |first=Samantha |date=2006-05-01 |url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/scitech/display.cfm?ST_ID=725 |title=Weather, Weather, Everywhere? |publisher=NASA |accessdate=2008-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among extrasolar planets, axial tilts are not known for certain, though most hot Jupiters are believed to have negligible to no axial tilt as a result of their proximity to their stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Obliquity Tides on Hot Jupiters |author=Winn, Joshua N. |author2=Holman, Matthew J. |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |date=2005 | doi=10.1086/432834 | volume=628 |issue=2 |pages=L159 |bibcode=2005ApJ...628L.159W|arxiv = astro-ph/0506468 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Rotation ====
The planets rotate around invisible axes through their centres. A planet's [[rotation period]] is known as a [[day|stellar day]]. Most of the planets in the Solar System rotate in the same direction as they orbit the Sun, which is counter-clockwise as seen from above the Sun's [[Poles of astronomical bodies#Geographic poles|north pole]], the exceptions being Venus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Rotation of Venus: Period Estimated from Radar Measurements |author=Goldstein, R. M. |author2=Carpenter, R. L. |date=1963 |journal =Science |volume=139 |doi=10.1126/science.139.3558.910 |pmid=17743054 |issue=3558 |bibcode=1963Sci...139..910G |pages=910–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Uranus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Rotational properties of Uranus and Neptune |first1=M. J. S. |last1=Belton |author2=Terrile, R. J. |date=1984 |journal=Uranus and Neptune |pages=327–347| publisher=NASA |bibcode=1984NASCP2330..327B |volume=CP-2330 |editor=Bergstralh, J. T.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which rotate clockwise, though Uranus's extreme axial tilt means there are differing conventions on which of its poles is "north", and therefore whether it is rotating clockwise or anti-clockwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Outer Worlds; Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, and Beyond |pages=195–206 |date=2006 |first=Michael P. |last=Borgia |publisher=Springer New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of which convention is used, Uranus has a [[retrograde rotation]] relative to its orbit.

The rotation of a planet can be induced by several factors during formation. A net [[angular momentum]] can be induced by the individual angular momentum contributions of accreted objects. The accretion of gas by the giant planets can also contribute to the angular momentum. Finally, during the last stages of planet building, a [[stochastic process]] of protoplanetary accretion can randomly alter the spin axis of the planet.&lt;ref name="araa31"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Planet formation |last=Lissauer | series=31 |first=Jack J. |journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics |volume=(A94-12726 02–90) | issue=1 |pages=129–174 |date=1993 |doi=10.1146/annurev.aa.31.090193.001021 |bibcode=1993ARA&amp;A..31..129L}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is great variation in the length of day between the planets, with Venus taking 243 [[Julian day|days]] to rotate, and the giant planets only a few hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Planet tables |url=http://www.astronomynotes.com/tables/tablesb.htm |first=Nick |last=Strobel |publisher=astronomynotes.com |accessdate=2008-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rotational periods of extrasolar planets are not known. However, for "hot" Jupiters, their proximity to their stars means that they are [[Tidal locking|tidally locked]] (i.e., their orbits are in sync with their rotations). This means, they always show one face to their stars, with one side in perpetual day, the other in perpetual night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Magnetically-Driven Planetary Radio Emissions and Application to Extrasolar Planets | last1=Zarka |first1=Philippe |author2=Treumann, Rudolf A. |author3=Ryabov, Boris P. |author4=Ryabov, Vladimir B. |date=2001 |journal=Astrophysics &amp; Space Science |volume=277 |issue=1/2 |pages=293–300 |doi = 10.1023/A:1012221527425|bibcode = 2001Ap&amp;SS.277..293Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Orbital clearing ====
{{Main|Clearing the neighbourhood}}
The defining dynamic characteristic of a planet is that it has ''cleared its neighborhood''. A planet that has cleared its neighborhood has accumulated enough mass to gather up or sweep away all the [[planetesimal]]s in its orbit. In effect, it orbits its star in isolation, as opposed to sharing its orbit with a multitude of similar-sized objects. This characteristic was mandated as part of the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]]'s official [[2006 definition of planet|definition of a planet]] in August, 2006. This criterion excludes such planetary bodies as [[Pluto]], [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]] and [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] from full-fledged planethood, making them instead [[dwarf planet]]s.&lt;ref name="IAU" /&gt; Although to date this criterion only applies to the Solar System, a number of young extrasolar systems have been found in which evidence suggests orbital clearing is taking place within their [[circumstellar disc]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |title=The Total Number of Giant Planets in Debris Disks with Central Clearings |date=2007-07-12 |author=Faber, Peter |author2=Quillen, Alice C. |eprint=0706.1684 |class=astro-ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physical characteristics ===

==== Mass ====
{{Main|Planetary mass}}
A planet's defining physical characteristic is that it is massive enough for the force of its own gravity to dominate over the [[electromagnetic force]]s binding its physical structure, leading to a state of [[hydrostatic equilibrium]]. This effectively means that all planets are spherical or spheroidal. Up to a certain mass, an object can be irregular in shape, but beyond that point, which varies depending on the chemical makeup of the object, gravity begins to pull an object towards its own centre of mass until the object collapses into a sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Dwarf Planets |url=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/dwarfplanets/ |authorlink=Michael E. Brown |last=Brown |first=Michael E. |work=California Institute of Technology |date=2006 |accessdate=2008-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mass is also the prime attribute by which planets are distinguished from [[star]]s. The upper mass limit for planethood is roughly 13 times Jupiter's mass for objects with solar-type [[isotopic abundance]], beyond which it achieves conditions suitable for [[nuclear fusion]]. Other than the Sun, no objects of such mass exist in the Solar System; but there are exoplanets of this size. The 13-Jupiter-mass limit is not universally agreed upon and the [[Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia]] includes objects up to 20 Jupiter masses,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=exoplanet-catalogue How One Astronomer Became the Unofficial Exoplanet Record-Keeper], www.scientificamerican.com&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Exoplanet Data Explorer]] up to 24 Jupiter masses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=1012.5676 |author1=Jason T Wright |author2=Onsi Fakhouri |author3=Marcy |author4=Eunkyu Han |author5=Ying Feng |author6=John Asher Johnson |author7=Howard |author8=Fischer |author9=Valenti |title=The Exoplanet Orbit Database |date=2010|last10=Anderson |first10=Jay |last11=Piskunov |first11=Nikolai |doi=10.1086/659427 |volume=123 |issue=902 |journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific |pages=412–422 |bibcode=2011PASP..123..412W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The smallest known planet is [[PSR B1257+12A]], one of the first extrasolar planets discovered, which was found in 1992 in orbit around a [[pulsar]]. Its mass is roughly half that of the planet Mercury.&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia" /&gt; The smallest known planet orbiting a main-sequence star other than the Sun is [[Kepler-37b]], with a mass (and radius) slightly higher than that of the [[Moon]].

==== Internal differentiation ====
{{Main|Planetary differentiation}}
[[File:Jupiter interior.png|upright|thumb|Illustration of the interior of Jupiter, with a rocky core overlaid by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen]]

Every planet began its existence in an entirely fluid state; in early formation, the denser, heavier materials sank to the centre, leaving the lighter materials near the surface. Each therefore has a [[Planetary differentiation|differentiated]] interior consisting of a dense [[planetary core]] surrounded by a [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] that either is or was a [[fluid]]. The terrestrial planets are sealed within hard [[Crust (geology)|crusts]],&lt;ref name="terrestrial"&gt;{{cite web |title=Planetary Interiors |work=Department of Physics, University of Oregon |url=http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/ast121/lectures/lec16.html |accessdate=2008-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in the giant planets the mantle simply blends into the upper cloud layers. The terrestrial planets have cores of elements such as [[iron]] and [[nickel]], and mantles of [[silicate]]s. [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]] are believed to have cores of rock and metal surrounded by mantles of [[metallic hydrogen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Linda T. |last=Elkins-Tanton |date=2006 |title=Jupiter and Saturn |publisher=Chelsea House |location=New York |isbn=0-8160-5196-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]], which are smaller, have rocky cores surrounded by mantles of [[water]], [[ammonia]], [[methane]] and other [[Volatiles|ices]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1016/0032-0633(95)00061-5| last1 = Podolak| first1 = M.| last2 = Weizman| first2 = A.| last3 = Marley| first3 = M.| date=December 1995 | title = Comparative models of Uranus and Neptune| journal = Planetary and Space Science| volume = 43| issue = 12| pages = 1517–1522| pmid = | pmc = | bibcode = 1995P&amp;SS...43.1517P| ref = {{sfnRef|Podolak Weizman et al.|1995}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fluid action within these planets' cores creates a [[geodynamo]] that generates a [[magnetic field]].&lt;ref name="terrestrial" /&gt;

==== Atmosphere ====
{{Main|Atmosphere|Extraterrestrial atmospheres}}
{{see also|Extraterrestrial skies}}
[[File:Top of Atmosphere.jpg|thumb|left|Earth's atmosphere]]
All of the Solar System planets except [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]&lt;ref&gt;Hunten D. M., Shemansky D. E., Morgan T. H. (1988), ''The Mercury atmosphere'', In: Mercury (A89-43751 19–91). University of Arizona Press, pp. 562–612&lt;/ref&gt; have substantial [[atmosphere]]s because their gravity is strong enough to keep gases close to the surface. The larger giant planets are massive enough to keep large amounts of the light gases [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]], whereas the smaller planets lose these gases into [[space]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sheppard | first1 = S.

Planetary atmospheres are affected by the varying [[insolation]] or internal energy, leading to the formation of dynamic [[weather system]]s such as [[hurricane]]s, (on Earth), planet-wide [[dust storm]]s (on Mars), a greater-than-Earth-sized [[Anticyclonic storm|anticyclone]] on Jupiter (called the [[Great Red Spot]]), and [[Great Dark Spot|holes in the atmosphere]] (on Neptune).&lt;ref name="Weather" /&gt; At least one extrasolar planet, [[HD 189733 b]], has been claimed to have such a weather system, similar to the Great Red Spot but twice as large.&lt;ref name="knutson"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Knutson |first1=Heather A. |author2=Charbonneau, David |author3=Allen, Lori E. |author4=Fortney, Jonathan J. |title=A map of the day-night contrast of the extrasolar planet HD 189733 b |journal=Nature |date=2007 |volume=447 |doi=10.1038/nature05782 |laysummary=http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/news/2007/pr200713.html |laysource=Center for Astrophysics press release |laydate=2007-05-09 |pmid=17495920 |issue=7141 |bibcode=2007Natur.447..183K | pages=183–6|arxiv = 0705.0993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hot Jupiters, due to their extreme proximities to their host stars, have been shown to be losing their atmospheres into space due to stellar radiation, much like the tails of comets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |first1=Donna |last1=Weaver |first2=Ray |last2=Villard |url=http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2007/07/full/ |title=Hubble Probes Layer-cake Structure of Alien World's Atmosphere |publisher=Space Telescope Science Institute |date=2007-01-31 |accessdate=2011-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Nature |last1=Ballester |first1=Gilda E. |author2=Sing, David K. |author3=Herbert, Floyd |title=The signature of hot hydrogen in the atmosphere of the extrasolar planet HD 209458b |volume=445 |date=2007 |doi=10.1038/nature05525 |pmid=17268463 |issue=7127 |bibcode=2007Natur.445..511B | pages=511–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; These planets may have vast differences in temperature between their day and night sides that produce supersonic winds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Harrington |first1=Jason |author2=Hansen, Brad M. |author3=Luszcz, Statia H. |author4=Seager, Sara |title=The phase-dependent infrared brightness of the extrasolar planet Andromeda b |journal=Science |volume=314 |date=2006 |doi=10.1126/science.1133904 |laysummary=http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/starsgalaxies/spitzer-20061012.html |laysource=NASA press release |laydate=2006-10-12 |pmid=17038587 |issue=5799 |bibcode=2006Sci...314..623H | pages=623–6|arxiv = astro-ph/0610491 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although the day and night sides of HD 189733 b appear to have very similar temperatures, indicating that that planet's atmosphere effectively redistributes the star's energy around the planet.&lt;ref name="knutson" /&gt;

==== Magnetosphere ====
{{Main|Magnetosphere}}
[[File:Structure of the magnetosphere-en.svg|thumb|[[Earth's magnetic field|Earth's magnetosphere]] (diagram)]]

One important characteristic of the planets is their intrinsic [[magnetic moment]]s, which in turn give rise to magnetospheres. The presence of a magnetic field indicates that the planet is still geologically alive. In other words, magnetized planets have flows of [[electrical conductivity|electrically conducting]] material in their interiors, which generate their magnetic fields. These fields significantly change the interaction of the planet and solar wind. A magnetized planet creates a cavity in the solar wind around itself called the magnetosphere, which the wind cannot penetrate. The magnetosphere can be much larger than the planet itself. In contrast, non-magnetized planets have only small magnetospheres induced by interaction of the [[ionosphere]] with the solar wind, which cannot effectively protect the planet.&lt;ref name="Kivelson2007" /&gt;

Of the eight planets in the Solar System, only Venus and Mars lack such a magnetic field.&lt;ref name="Kivelson2007" /&gt; In addition, the moon of Jupiter [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] also has one. Of the magnetized planets the magnetic field of Mercury is the weakest, and is barely able to deflect the [[solar wind]]. Ganymede's magnetic field is several times larger, and Jupiter's is the strongest in the Solar System (so strong in fact that it poses a serious health risk to future manned missions to its moons). The magnetic fields of the other giant planets are roughly similar in strength to that of Earth, but their magnetic moments are significantly larger. The magnetic fields of Uranus and Neptune are strongly tilted relative the rotational [[Axis of rotation|axis]] and displaced from the centre of the planet.&lt;ref name="Kivelson2007"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Kivelson |first1=Margaret Galland |author2=Bagenal, Fran |chapter=Planetary Magnetospheres |title=Encyclopedia of the Solar System |date=2007 |publisher=Academic Press |editor= Lucyann Mcfadden |editor2= Paul Weissman |editor3= Torrence Johnson |isbn=978-0-12-088589-3 |page=519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, a team of astronomers in Hawaii observed an extrasolar planet around the star [[HD 179949]], which appeared to be creating a sunspot on the surface of its parent star. The team hypothesized that the planet's magnetosphere was transferring energy onto the star's surface, increasing its already high 7,760&amp;nbsp;°C temperature by an additional 400&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Magnetic planet |first=Amanda | last=Gefter | work=Astronomy |date=2004-01-17 |url=http://www.astronomy.com/asy/default.aspx?c=a&amp;id=2090 |accessdate=2008-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Secondary characteristics ===
{{Main|Natural satellite|Planetary ring}}
[[File:Voyager 2 - Saturn Rings - 3085 7800 2.png|thumb|upright|The [[rings of Saturn]]]]

Several planets or dwarf planets in the Solar System (such as Neptune and Pluto) have orbital periods that are in [[Orbital resonance|resonance]] with each other or with smaller bodies (this is also common in satellite systems). All except Mercury and Venus have [[natural satellite]]s, often called "moons". Earth has one, Mars has two, and the giant planets have numerous moons in complex planetary-type systems. Many moons of the giant planets have features similar to those on the terrestrial planets and dwarf planets, and some have been studied as possible abodes of life (especially [[Europa (moon)|Europa]]).&lt;ref name="Grasset2000"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Grasset |first1=O. |author2=Sotin C. |author3=Deschamps F. |title = On the internal structure and dynamic of Titan |date = 2000 |journal = Planetary and Space Science |volume = 48 | issue= 7–8 | pages = 617–636 |doi=10.1016/S0032-0633(00)00039-8 | bibcode=2000P&amp;SS...48..617G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fortes2000"&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Icarus |volume= 146 |issue = 2 |pages = 444–452 |date= 2000 |doi = 10.1006/icar.2000.6400 |title = Exobiological implications of a possible ammonia-water ocean inside Titan |author = Fortes, A.

The four giant planets are also orbited by [[planetary ring]]s of varying size and complexity. The rings are composed primarily of dust or particulate matter, but can host tiny '[[Rings of Saturn#Moonlets|moonlets]]' whose gravity shapes and maintains their structure. Although the origins of planetary rings is not precisely known, they are believed to be the result of natural satellites that fell below their parent planet's [[Roche limit]] and were torn apart by [[tidal force]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Molnar, L. A. | author2=Dunn, D. E. |title=On the Formation of Planetary Rings |journal=Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society |date=1996 |volume=28 |pages=77–115 |bibcode=1996DPS....28.1815M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Encrenaz |last=Thérèse |date=2004 |title=The Solar System |edition=Third |pages=388–390 |publisher=Springer |isbn=3-540-00241-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No secondary characteristics have been observed around extrasolar planets. The [[sub-brown dwarf]] [[Cha 110913-773444]], which has been described as a [[rogue planet]], is believed to be orbited by a tiny [[protoplanetary disc]]&lt;ref name="Luhman" /&gt; and the sub-brown dwarf [[OTS 44]] was shown to be surrounded by a substantial protoplanetary disk of at least 10 Earth masses.&lt;ref name=joergens2013_AA558 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12555">'''Quantitative storytelling''' ('''QST''') is a systematic approach to explore the multiplicity of frames potentially legitimate in a scientific study or controversy.&lt;ref name="QST1"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.futures.2016.11.012 |title=What is wrong with evidence based policy, and how can it be improved? |journal=Futures |volume=91 |pages=62–71 |year=2017 |last1=Saltelli |first1=Andrea |last2=Giampietro |first2=Mario }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Giampietro2014"&gt;[Giampietro, M., Aspinall, R. J., Ramos-Martin, J. and Bukkens, S. G. F. (2014) Resource Accounting for Sustainability Assessment: The Nexus between Energy, Food, Water and Land Use. Taylor &amp; Francis (Routledge Explorations in Sustainability and Governance).](https://books.google.es/books?id=Vb6uAwAAQBAJ)&lt;/ref&gt; QST assumes that in an interconnected society more frameworks and worldviews are legitimately upheld by different constituencies and social actors. QST looks critically to models used in evidence-based policy (EBP). These are often in the form of risk analyses or cost benefit analyses, and necessarily focus on a single framing of the issue under consideration. QST suggest corrective approaches to this practice.  

==Context==
Quantitative storytelling (QST) addresses evidence based policy and can be considered as a reaction to a style of quantification based on cost benefir or risk analysis which - in the opinion of QST proponents - may contain important implicit normative assumptions.&lt;ref name="QST1" /&gt;

In the logic of QST, a single quantification corresponding to a single view of what the problem is runs the risk of distracting from what could be alternative readings.&lt;ref name="QST1" /&gt;

Alternative frames (Ravetz, 1987&lt;ref name="Ravetz1997"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/107554708700900104 |title=Usable Knowledge, Usable Ignorance |journal=Knowledge |volume=9 |pages=87–116 |year=2016 |last1=Ravetz |first1=Jerome R }}&lt;/ref&gt; ; Rayner, 2012&lt;ref name="Rayner2012"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/03085147.2011.637335 |title=Uncomfortable knowledge: The social construction of ignorance in science and environmental policy discourses |journal=Economy and Society |volume=41 |pages=107–25 |year=2012 |last1=Rayner |first1=Steve }}&lt;/ref&gt;) may represent ‘uncomfortable knowledge’, which is removed from the policy discourse. Thus, extensive mathematical modelling in EBP to support a given policy may lead to a simplification of the available perceptions and generate - rather than resolve – controversies. The word ‘hypo-cognition’ has been used in the context of these instrumental use of frames (Lakoff et al., 2008&lt;ref name="Lakoff2008"&gt;[Lakoff, G., Dean, H. and Hazen, D. (2008) Don’t Think of an Elephant!: Know Your Values and Frame the Debate. Chelsea Green Publishing.](https://books.google.es/books?id=zbJ1oxHC9a0C)
&lt;/ref&gt;; Lakoff, 2010&lt;ref name="Lakoff2010"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/17524030903529749 |title=Why it Matters How We Frame the Environment |journal=Environmental Communication |volume=4 |pages=70–81 |year=2010 |last1=Lakoff |first1=George }}&lt;/ref&gt;). 

Under this critical viewpoint, mathematical models can be seen as a tool for ‘displacement’. Displacement occurs where a model becomes the end instead of the tool, e.g. when an institution chooses to monitor and manage the outcome of a model rather than what happens in reality&lt;ref name="Rayner2012" /&gt;. Once exposed, the strategic use of hypo-cognition erodes the trust in the involved actors and institutions.&lt;ref name="Rayner2012" /&gt;

==Approach==
QST suggests acknowledging ignorance, as to work out ‘clumsy solutions’ (Rayner, 2012&lt;ref name="Rayner2012" /&gt;), which may accommodate unshared epistemological or ethical principles. This is in turn close to the [[Post-normal science|PNS]] suggested style of inquiry known as ‘working deliberatively within imperfections’ (van der Sluijs and Petersen, 2008&lt;ref name="Sluijs2012"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1088/1748-9326/3/2/024008 |title=Exploring the quality of evidence for complex and contested policy decisions |journal=Environmental Research Letters |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=024008 |year=2008 |last1=Van Der Sluijs |first1=Jeroen P |last2=Petersen |first2=Arthur C |last3=Janssen |first3=Peter H M |last4=Risbey |first4=James S |last5=Ravetz |first5=Jerome R }}&lt;/ref&gt;), and to the exigence for a ‘rediscovery of ignorance’ (see preface to Pereira and Funtowicz, 2015&lt;ref name="Pereira2012"&gt;[Pereira, A. G. and Funtowicz, S. (2015) Science, Philosophy and Sustainability : the End of the Cartesian dream.{{pn|date=April 2018}}](https://www.crcpress.com/Science-Philosophy-and-Sustainability-The-End-of-the-Cartesian-dream/Pereira-Funtowicz/p/book/9781138796409)&lt;/ref&gt;).
QST also calls attention to the power relationships at play in the use of evidence. Saltelli and Giampietro (2017)&lt;ref name="QST1" /&gt; suggest that our present approach to evidence-based policy, even in the more nuanced formulation of evidence-informed policy (Gluckman, 2014&lt;ref name="Gluckman2014"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/507163a |pmid=24627919 |title=Policy: The art of science advice to government |journal=Nature |volume=507 |issue=7491 |pages=163–5 |year=2014 |last1=Gluckman |first1=Peter }}&lt;/ref&gt;)– needs our urgent attention. Unavoidable asymmetries are generated by the fact that stronger players have access to better evidence, and can use it strategically (Boden and Epstein, 2006&lt;ref name="Boden2006"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/14767720600752619 |title=Managing the research imagination? Globalisation and research in higher education |journal=Globalisation, Societies and Education |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=223–36 |year=2006 |last1=Boden |first1=Rebecca |last2=Epstein |first2=Debbie }}&lt;/ref&gt;; Strassheim and Kettunen, 2014&lt;ref name="Strassheim2014"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1332/174426514X13990433991320 |title=When does evidence-based policy turn into policy-based evidence? Configurations, contexts and mechanisms |journal=Evidence &amp; Policy: A Journal of Research, Debate and Practice |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=259–77 |year=2014 |last1=Strassheim |first1=Holger |last2=Kettunen |first2=Pekka }}&lt;/ref&gt;).  The decline of pollinators challenge (Insectageddon, Mombiot, 2017&lt;ref name="Monbiot2017"&gt;[Monbiot G., 2017. Insectageddon: farming is more catastrophic than climate breakdown, The Guardian, October 20, 2017]( https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/20/insectageddon-farming-catastrophe-climate-breakdown-insect-populations)&lt;/ref&gt;) show that interest groups have more scope to capture regulators than the average citizen ad consumer.

QST encourages an effort in the pre-analytic, pre-quantitative phase of the analysis to map a socially robust (i.e. inclusive of the interest of different stakeholders) universe of possible frames. QST expands on one of the rules [[sensitivity auditing]] by asking the question of ‘what to do’ in order to avoid that an issue is framed unilaterally. Obviously, the medicine for a diseased evidence-based policy is not a prejudice - or superstition-based policy, but a more democratic and dialogic access to the provision of evidence – even in terms of agenda setting. For this a new institutional setting is needed&lt;ref name="QST1" /&gt;. 

QST does not eschew the use quantitative tools altogether. It suggests instead to explore quantitatively multiple narratives, avoiding spurious accuracy and focusing on some salient features of the selected stories. Rather than attempting to amass evidence in support to a given reading or policy, or to optimise it with modelling, QST operates ‘via negativa’, i.e. it tries to test whether the said framing runs afoul of a quantitative or qualitative analytical check. Here QST borrows from system ecology and attempts to refute the frames if these violate constraints of (Giampietro et al., 2014&lt;ref name="Giampietro2014" /&gt;): 

# feasibility (can we afford a given policy in terms of external constraints, e.g. existing biophysical resources?), 
# viability (can we afford it in the context of our internal constraints, governance, socioeconomic and technological arrangements?), and 
# desirability (will the relevant constituency accept it?).

==Applications==
Perhaps the best application of the concept of QST is an old study of GMO-related perceptions (Marris, 2001&lt;ref name="Marris2001"&gt;[Marris, C. (2001) Final Report of the PABE research project funded by the Commission of European Communities.]( http://csec.lancs.ac.uk/archive/pabe/docs/pabe_finalreport.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;) which has lost very little of its actuality since the ongoing GMO and pesticide debate. 
By direct interview and measurements of stakeholders’ expectation and worldviews, Marris and co-authors showed that the prevailing narrative of the reaction to GMO as a ‘food scare’ – i.e. as an issue of safety to consume GMO food – did not show up among the concerns raised by the interviewed citizens, which worried instead about who would benefit from these technologies, why were they introduced in the first place, and whether existing regulatory authorities would be up to the task of resisting regulatory capture from powerful industrial incumbents.

Other applications of approaches which can be referred to QST are to the analyses for the cost of climate change,&lt;ref name="Saltelli-d’Hombres2011"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2009.12.003 |title=Sensitivity analysis didn't help.

'''Religious alienation''' is a term some use to describe how religion creates an impediment to human self-understanding.

== Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel ==
Although the roots of alienation lie far back in the [[Judeo-Christian tradition]], the concept of alienation first gained prominence in the philosophy of [[Hegel]], and particularly in his mature writings. There are signs of the idea in his earlier works, but it is not until the ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' (1807) that alienation occupies a central place in his writings.

In the opening sections of the ''Phenomenology'', Hegel attacked the views of [[common sense]] and simplified [[natural science]] that the world consisted of discrete objects independent of man's consciousness. Truth, for Hegel, was not to be found in knowledge that was stripped of any influence from man's own desires and feelings. Ultimately, Hegel considered that there could be no truth that was not intimately linked with the ongoing process of human beings as thinking subjects; truth was their truth. The supposed [[objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]] of the world of nature was in fact an alienation, for man's task was to discover, behind these appearances, his own essential life and finally to view everything as a facet of his own [[self-consciousness]]. The same principle applied to the world of culture in which such spheres as art and religion, if viewed as independent of man, constituted so many alienations to be overcome by integration into the final understanding and recapitulation which was [[Absolute Knowledge]].

== Bruno Bauer ==
Hegel had created a system; and all his followers believed that it was the final one. However, when it came to applying the system to particular problems, they conceived his system to be ambivalent. The fact that alienation seemed to them to be a challenge, something to be overcome, led them to put the emphasis on the concepts of [[dialectic]] and negativity in Hegel's system; and thus they challenged, first in religion and then in politics, his view that the problem of alienation had, at least in principle, been solved. The foremost among these radical disciples of Hegel, [[Bruno Bauer]], applied the concept of alienation to the religious field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=bauer |title=Bruno Bauer |last=Moggach |first=Douglas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bauer, who lectured in [[theology]] and made his name as a [[Gospel]] critic, considered that religious beliefs, and in particular Christianity, caused a division in man's consciousness by becoming opposed to this consciousness as a separate power. Thus religion was an attitude towards the essence of self-consciousness that had become estranged from itself. In this context, Bauer promoted the use of the expression "self-alienation" that soon became current among the [[Young Hegelians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia| publisher = Charles Scribner's Sons| editors = Philip  Wiener (ed.)| last = McLellan| first = David| author-link = David McLellan (academic)| title = ALIENATION IN HEGEL AND MARX| encyclopedia = The Dictionary of the History of Ideas| location = New York| accessdate = 2009-09-28| year = 1973| url = http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhi.cgi?id=dv1-06| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090907110351/http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhi.cgi?id=dv1-06| archivedate = 2009-09-07| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ludwig Feuerbach ==
For [[Ludwig Feuerbach|Feuerbach]] (''[[The Essence of Christianity]]'' (1841)), people alienate their essential being by attributing their human qualities to a god who is then worshipped on account of these qualities. In worshipping god, therefore, people are unconsciously worshipping themselves. Thus Feuerbach argues that religion is a form of alienation which prevents people from attaining realisation of their own species-being. Feuerbach’s thinking has been described as [[Christian humanism|humanist]] in that his theory of alienation is based on a theory of human nature as [[species-being]], as innate to the human species.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/education/alienation.html Worldsocialism.org Alienation study case]&lt;/ref&gt; This position would later be examined by [[Karl Marx]] in his "[[Theses on Feuerbach]]".

{{merge from|Space time (chemical engineering)|discuss=Talk:Residence time#Proposed merge with Space time (chemical engineering)|date=May 2018}}
For material flowing through a volume, the '''residence time''' is a measure of how much time the matter spends in it. Examples include fluids in a [[chemical reactor]], specific elements in a [[geochemical]] reservoir, water in a [[catchment]], bacteria in a culture vessel and drugs in human body. A molecule or small parcel of fluid has a single residence time, but more complex systems have a '''residence time distribution (RTD)'''.

There are at least three time constants that are used to represent a residence time distribution. The ''turn-over time'' or ''flushing time'' is the ratio of the material in the volume to the rate at which it passes through; the ''mean age'' is the mean length of time the material in the reservoir has spent there; and the ''mean transit time'' is the mean length of time the material spends in the reservoir.

Applications of residence times or residence time distributions can be found in a wide variety of disciplines including [[environmental science]], [[engineering]], [[chemistry]], and [[hydrology]].

== History ==
The concept of residence time originated in models of chemical reactors. The first such model was an ''axial dispersion model'' by [[Irving Langmuir]] in 1908. This received little attention for 45 years; other models were developed such as the [[plug flow reactor model]] and the [[continuous stirred-tank reactor]], and the concept of a ''washout function'' (representing the response to a sudden change in the input) was introduced. Then, in 1953, [[Peter Danckwerts]] resurrected the axial dispersion model and formulated the modern concept of residence time.&lt;ref name=Nauman&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nauman|first1=E. Bruce|title=Residence Time Theory|journal=Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry Research|date=May 2008|volume=47|issue=10|pages=3752–3766|doi=10.1021/ie071635a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distributions ==
Basic residence time theory treats a system with an input and an output, both of which have flow only in one direction. The system is homogeneous and the substance that is flowing through is [[Conserved quantity|conserved]] (neither created nor destroyed). A small particle entering the system will eventually leave, and the time spent there is its residence time. In a particularly simple model of flow, [[plug flow]], particles that enter at the same time continue to move at the same rate and leave together. In this case, there is only one residence time. Generally, though, their rates vary and there is a distribution of exit times. One measure of this is the ''washout function'' &lt;math&gt;W(t)&lt;/math&gt;, the fraction of particles leaving the system after having been there for a time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; or greater. Its complement, &lt;math&gt;F(t) = 1-W(t)&lt;/math&gt;, is the ''cumulative distribution function''. The ''differential distribution'', also known as the ''residence time distribution'' or ''exit age distribution'',&lt;ref name=Levenspiel/&gt;{{rp|260–261}} is given by
:&lt;math&gt;E(t)  = dF(t)/dt.&lt;/math&gt;
This has the properties of a [[probability distribution]]: it is always nonnegative and
:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty E(t)dt = 1.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=Nauman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Levenspiel&gt;{{cite book|last1=Levenspiel|first1=Octave|title=Chemical reaction engineering|date=1999|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|isbn=978-1-60119-921-8|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|260–261}}

One can also define a density function based on the [[flux]] (mass per unit time) out of the system. The ''transit time'' function is the fraction of particles leaving the system that have been in it for up to a given time. It is the integral of a distribution &lt;math&gt;I(t)&lt;/math&gt;. If, in a steady state, the mass in the system is &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt; and the outgoing flux is &lt;math&gt;F_0&lt;/math&gt;, the distributions are related by
:&lt;math&gt;F_0 I(t) = -M_0 \frac{d E(t)}{dt}.&lt;/math&gt;
As an illustration, for a human [[population]] to be in a steady state, the deaths per year of people older than &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; years (the left hand side of the equation) must be balanced by the number of people per year reaching age &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; (the right hand side).&lt;ref name=Bolin&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bolin|first1=Bert|last2=Rodhe|first2=Henning|title=A note on the concepts of age distribution and transit time in natural reservoirs|journal=Tellus|date=February 1973|volume=25|issue=1|pages=58–62|doi=10.1111/j.2153-3490.1973.tb01594.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Time constants==
"Residence time" can be a synonym for more than one constant used to represent the distribution.&lt;ref name="sch"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Schwartz |first=Stephen E. |year=1979 |title=Residence times in reservoirs under non-steady-state conditions: application to atmospheric SO2 and aerosol sulfate |journal=Tellus |volume=31 |issue=6 |pages=530–547 |doi=10.1111/j.2153-3490.1979.tb00935.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mean residence time===
Some statistical properties of the residence time distribution are frequently used. The mean residence time, or ''mean age'', is given by the first [[moment (mathematics)|moment]] of the residence time distribution:
: &lt;math&gt; \tau = \int_0^\infty t E(t) dt&lt;/math&gt;,
and the variance is given by
: &lt;math&gt; \sigma_t^2 = \int_0^\infty \left(t-\tau\right)^2 E(t) dt&lt;/math&gt;
or by the dimensionless form &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2 = \sigma_t^2/\tau^2&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=Nauman/&gt;

===Mean transit time===
The ''mean transit time'' is the first moment of the transit time distribution:
:&lt;math&gt; t_\mathrm{t} = \int_0^\infty t I(t) dt.&lt;/math&gt;

===Flushing time===
The ''turnover time'', also known as the ''flushing time'',&lt;ref name=Monsen&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Monsen|first1=Nancy E.|last2=Cloern|first2=James E.|last3=Lucas|first3=Lisa V.|last4=Monismith|first4=Stephen G.|title=A comment on the use of flushing time, residence time, and age as transport time scales|journal=Limnology and Oceanography|date=September 2002|volume=47|issue=5|pages=1545–1553|doi=10.4319/lo.2002.47.5.1545}}&lt;/ref&gt; is simply the ratio of mass to flux:
:&lt;math&gt; t_0 = M_0 / F_0.&lt;/math&gt;
When applied to liquids, it is also known as the ''hydraulic retention time'' (''HRT''), ''hydraulic residence time'' or ''hydraulic detention time''.&lt;ref name=Davis&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Mackenzie L.|last2=Masten|first2=Susan J.|title=Principles of environmental engineering and science|date=2004|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|location=Boston, Mass.|isbn=9780072921861|pages=150, 267, 480, 500}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship between times===
It can be shown that, in a steady state, the mean transit time and flushing time are equal (&lt;math&gt;t_t = t_0&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref name=Bolin/&gt;

The relationship between &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;t_\mathrm{t}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is determined by the type of distribution:&lt;ref name=Bolin/&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\tau &lt; t_0&lt;/math&gt;: it takes some time for particles to begin leaving the system. Examples include water in a lake with inlet and outlet on opposite sides; and a [[Nuclear weapons testing|nuclear bomb test]] where [[Nuclear fallout|radioactive material]] is introduced high in the [[stratosphere]] and filters down to the [[troposphere]].
* &lt;math&gt;\tau = t_0&lt;/math&gt;: the frequency functions &lt;math&gt;E(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I(t)&lt;/math&gt; are [[Exponential decay|exponential]], as in the CSTR model above. Such a distribution occurs whenever all particles have a fixed probability per unit time of leaving the system. Examples include [[radioactive decay]] and [[Rate equation#first-order reaction|first order chemical reactions]] (where the reaction rate is proportional to the amount of [[reactant]]).
* &lt;math&gt;\tau &gt; t_0&lt;/math&gt;: most of the particles pass through quickly, but some are held up. This can happen when the main source and sink are very close together or the same. For example, most [[water vapor]] rising from the ocean surface soon returns to the ocean, but water vapor that gets sufficiently far away will probably return much later in the form of rain.&lt;ref name=Bolin/&gt;

==Simple flow models==
===Plug flow reactor===
In an ideal [[Plug flow reactor model|plug flow reactor]] the fluid elements leave in the same order they arrived, not mixing with those in front and behind. Therefore, fluid entering at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; will exit at time &lt;math&gt;t+\tau&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is the residence time. The fraction leaving is a step function, going from 0 to 1 at time &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;. The distribution function is therefore a [[Dirac delta function]] at &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;E(t) = \delta(t-\tau)\,&lt;/math&gt;
The mean is &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; and the variance is zero.&lt;ref name=Nauman/&gt;

The RTD of a real reactor deviates from that of an ideal reactor, depending on the hydrodynamics within the vessel. A non-zero variance indicates that there is some dispersion along the path of the fluid, which may be attributed to turbulence, a non-uniform velocity profile, or diffusion. If the mean of the &lt;math&gt;E(t)&lt;/math&gt; curve arrives earlier than the expected time &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; it indicates that there is [[Stagnation point|stagnant fluid]] within the vessel. If the RTD curve shows more than one main peak it may indicate channeling, parallel paths to the exit, or strong internal circulation.

===Continuous stirred-tank reactor===
In an ideal [[continuous stirred-tank reactor]] (CSTR), the flow at the inlet is completely and instantly mixed into the bulk of the reactor. The reactor and the outlet fluid have identical, homogeneous compositions at all times. The residence time distribution is exponential:
:&lt;math&gt;E(t) = \frac{1}{\tau} \exp\left(\frac{-t}{\tau}\right).&lt;/math&gt;
The mean is &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; and the variance is 1.&lt;ref name=Nauman/&gt; A notable difference from the plug flow reactor is that material introduced into the system will never completely leave it.&lt;ref name=Monsen/&gt;

In reality, it is impossible to obtain such rapid mixing, especially on industrial scales where reactor vessels may range between 1 and thousands of cubic meters, and hence the RTD of a real reactor will deviate from the ideal exponential decay. For example, there will be some finite delay before &lt;math&gt;E(t)&lt;/math&gt; reaches its maximum value and the length of the delay will reflect the rate of mass transfer within the reactor. Just as was noted for a plug-flow reactor, an early mean will indicate some stagnant fluid within the vessel, while the presence of multiple peaks could indicate channeling, parallel paths to the exit, or strong internal circulation. Short-circuiting fluid within the reactor would appear in an RTD curve as a small pulse of concentrated tracer that reaches the outlet shortly after injection.

===Laminar flow reactor===
In a [[laminar flow reactor]], the fluid flows through a long tube or parallel plate reactor and the flow is in layers parallel to the walls of the tube. The velocity of the flow is a parabolic function of radius. In the absence of [[molecular diffusion]], the RTD is&lt;ref&gt;Electrochimica Acta 176 (2015) 463-471. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2015.07.019&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; E(t) = 0, \quad t &lt;= \tau/2&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt; E(t) = \frac{\tau^2}{2 t^3} \quad t &gt; \tau/2.&lt;/math&gt;
The variance is infinite. In a real system, diffusion will eventually mix the layers so that the tail of the RTD becomes exponential and the variance finite; but laminar flow reactors can have variance greater than 1, the maximum for CTSD reactors.&lt;ref name=Nauman/&gt;

==Determining the RTD experimentally==
Residence time distributions are measured by introducing a non-reactive [[Dye tracer|tracer]] into the system at the inlet. Its input concentration is changed according to a known function and the output concentration measured. The tracer should not modify the physical characteristics of the fluid (equal density, equal viscosity) or the [[hydrodynamic]] conditions and it should be easily detectable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fogler|first1=H. Scott|title=Elements of chemical reaction engineering|date=2006|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|isbn=978-0130473943|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In general, the change in tracer concentration will either be a ''pulse'' or a ''step''. Other functions are possible, but they require more calculations to [[deconvolution|deconvolute]] the RTD curve.

===Pulse experiments===
This method required the introduction of a very small volume of concentrated tracer at the inlet of the reactor, such that it approaches the [[Dirac delta function]].&lt;ref&gt;Electrochimica Acta 56 (2011) 7312-7318. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2011.06.047&lt;/ref&gt; Although an infinitely short injection cannot be produced, it can be made much smaller than the mean residence time of the vessel. If a mass of tracer, &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, is introduced into a vessel of volume &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and an expected residence 
time of &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, the resulting curve of &lt;math&gt;C(t)&lt;/math&gt; can be transformed into a dimensionless residence time distribution curve by the following relation:

: &lt;math&gt;E(t) = \frac{C(t)}{\int_0^\infty C(t)\ dt}&lt;/math&gt;

===Step experiments===
The concentration of tracer in a step experiment at the reactor inlet changes abruptly from 0 to &lt;math&gt;C_0&lt;/math&gt;. The concentration of tracer at the outlet is measured and normalized to the concentration &lt;math&gt;C_0&lt;/math&gt; to obtain the non-dimensional curve &lt;math&gt;F(t)&lt;/math&gt; which goes from 0 to 1:
: &lt;math&gt;F(t) = \frac {C(t)}{C_{0}}&lt;/math&gt;.

The step- and pulse-responses of a reactor are related by the following:
: &lt;math&gt;F(t) = \int_{0}^t E(t')\, dt' \qquad E(t) = \frac {dF(t)}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

A step experiment is often easier to perform than a pulse experiment, but it tends to smooth over some of the details that a pulse response could show. It is easy to numerically integrate an experimental pulse response to obtain a very high-quality estimate of the step response, but the reverse is not the case because any noise in the concentration measurement will be amplified by numeric differentiation.

==Applications==

===Chemical reactors===
In [[chemical reactor]]s, the goal is to make components react with a high [[yield (chemistry)|yield]]. In a homogeneous, [[first-order reaction]], the probability that an atom or molecule will react depends only on its residence time:
:&lt;math&gt;P_\mathrm{R} = \exp\left(-k t\right)&lt;/math&gt;
for a [[rate constant]] &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. Given a RTD, the average probability is equal to the ratio of the concentration &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; of the component before and after:&lt;ref name=Nauman/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\overline{P_\mathrm{R}} = a_\mathrm{out}/a_\mathrm{in} = \int_0^\infty \exp\left(-k t\right)E(t)dt.&lt;/math&gt;

If the reaction is more complicated, then the output is not uniquely determined by the RTD. It also depends on the degree of ''[[micromixing]]'', the mixing between molecules that entered at different times. If there is no mixing, the system is said to be ''completely segregated'', and the output can be given in the form
:&lt;math&gt;a_\mathrm{out} = \int_0^\infty a_\mathrm{batch}(t)E(t)dt.&lt;/math&gt;
For given RTD, there is an upper limit on the amount of mixing that can occur, called the ''maximum mixedness'', and this determines the achievable yield. A continuous stirred-tank reactor can be anywhere in the spectrum between completely segregated and [[perfect mixing]].&lt;ref name=Nauman/&gt;

===Groundwater flow===

Hydraulic residence time (HRT) is an important factor in the transport of environmental toxins or other chemicals through [[groundwater]]. The amount of time that a pollutant spends traveling through a delineated subsurface space is related to the saturation and the [[hydraulic conductivity]] of the soil or rock.&lt;ref name=Noel&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Noel|first=M.|date=1999|title=Some physical properties of water transport in waste material|url=https://www.imwa.info/docs/imwa_1999/IMWA1999_Noel_449.pdf|journal=Mine, Water &amp; Environment|volume=1999 IMWA Congress|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Porosity]] is another significant contributing factor to the mobility of water through the ground (e.g. toward the [[water table]]). The intersection between pore density and size determines the degree or magnitude of the flow rate through the media. This idea can be illustrated by a comparison of the ways water moves through [[clay]] versus [[gravel]]. The retention time through a specified vertical distance in clay will be longer than through the same distance in gravel, even though they are both characterized as high porosity materials. This is because the pore sizes are much larger in gravel media than in clay, and so there is less [[Hydrostatic stress|hydrostatic tension]] working against the subsurface [[pressure gradient]] and gravity.

Groundwater flow is important parameter for consideration in the design of waste rock basins for [[mining]] operations. Waste rock is heterogeneous material with particles varying from boulders to clay-sized particles, and it contains [[Acid mine drainage|sulfidic pollutants]] which must be controlled such that they do not compromise the quality of the water table and also so the runoff does not create environmental problems in the surrounding areas.&lt;ref name=Noel /&gt; [[Aquifer#Aquifers versus aquitards|Aquitards]] are clay zones that can have such a degree of impermeability that they partially or completely retard water flow.&lt;ref name=Davis /&gt;&lt;ref name=Faybishenko&gt;{{cite book|last1=Faybishenko|first1=Boris|last2=Witherspoon|first2=Paul A.|last3=Gale|first3=John|title=Dynamics of fluids and transport in fractured rock|date=2005|publisher=American Geophysical Union|location=Washington|isbn=9780875904276|pages=165–167}}&lt;/ref&gt; These clay lenses can slow or stop seepage into the water table, although if an aquitard is fractured and contaminated then it can become a long-term source of groundwater contamination due to its low permeability and high HRT.&lt;ref name=Faybishenko /&gt;

===Water treatment===
{{See also|Activated sludge|Waste stabilization pond}}
[[Primary treatment]] for wastewater or drinking water includes settling in a [[Sedimentation (water treatment)|sedimentation]] chamber to remove as much of the solid matter as possible before applying additional treatments.&lt;ref name=Davis /&gt; The amount removed is controlled by the hydraulic residence time (HRT).&lt;ref name=Davis /&gt; When water flows through a volume at a slower rate, less energy is available to keep solid particles entrained in the stream and there is more time for them to settle to the bottom. Typical HRTs for sedimentation basins are around two hours,&lt;ref name=Davis /&gt; although some groups recommend longer times to remove [[wiktionary:micropollutant|micropollutants]] such as pharmaceuticals and hormones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ejhed |first1=H. |last2=Fång |first2=J. |last3=Hansen |first3=K. |last4=Graae|first4=L.|last5=Rahmberg|first5=M.|last6=Magnér|first6=J.|last7=Dorgeloh|first7=E.|last8=Plaza|first8=G.|title=The effect of hydraulic retention time in onsite wastewater treatment and removal of pharmaceuticals, hormones and phenolic utility substances|journal=Science of the Total Environment|date=March 2018|volume=618|pages=250–261|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.11.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Water purification|Disinfection]] is the last step in the [[Sewage treatment#Tertiary treatment|tertiary treatment]] of wastewater or drinking water. The types of pathogens that occur in untreated water include those that are easily killed like [[Pathogenic bacteria|bacteria]] and [[Pathogen#Viral|viruses]], and those that are more robust such as [[Protozoan infection|protozoa]] and [[Microbial cyst|cysts]].&lt;ref name=Davis /&gt; The disinfection chamber must have a long enough HRT to kill or deactivate all of them.

===Surface science===
{{See also|Surface science}}
Atoms and molecules of gas or liquid can be trapped on a solid surface in a process called [[adsorption]]. This is an [[exothermic process]] involving a release of [[heat]], and heating the surface increases the probability that an atom will escape within a given time. At a given temperature &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, the residence time of an adsorbed atom is given by  
:&lt;math&gt;\tau=\tau_0 \exp\left(\frac{E_\mathrm{a}}{R T}\right),&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gas constant]], &lt;math&gt;E_\mathrm{a}&lt;/math&gt; is an [[activation energy]], and &lt;math&gt;\tau_0&lt;/math&gt; is a prefactor that is correlated with the vibration times of the surface atoms (generally of the order of &lt;math&gt;10^{-12}&lt;/math&gt; seconds).&lt;ref name=Somorjai&gt;{{cite book|last1=Somorjai|first1=Gabor A.|last2=Li|first2=Yimin|title=Introduction to surface chemistry and catalysis|date=2010|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, N.J.|isbn=9780470508237|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|27}}&lt;ref name=Hucknall&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hucknall|first1=D.J.|last2=Morris|first2=A.|title=Vacuum technology calculations in chemistry|date=2003|publisher=RSC|location=Cambridge|isbn=9781847552273}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|196}}

In [[vacuum technology]], the residence time of gases on the surfaces of a vacuum chamber can determine the pressure due to [[outgassing]]. If the chamber can be heated, the above equation shows that the gases can be "baked out"; but if not, then surfaces with a low residence time are needed to achieve [[ultra-high vacuum]]s.&lt;ref name=Hucknall/&gt;{{rp|195}}

===Environmental===
In environmental terms, the residence time definition is adapted to fit with ground water, the atmosphere, [[glacier]]s, lakes, streams, and oceans. More specifically it is the time during which water remains within an aquifer, lake, river, or other water body before continuing around the [[hydrological cycle]]. The time involved may vary from days for shallow gravel [[aquifer]]s to millions of years for deep aquifers with very low values for [[hydraulic conductivity]]. Residence times of water in rivers are a few days, while in large lakes residence time ranges up to several decades. Residence times of continental ice sheets is hundreds of thousands of years, of small glaciers a few decades.

Ground water residence time applications are useful for determining the amount of time it will take for a pollutant to reach and [[water contamination|contaminate]] a ground water drinking water source and at what concentration it will arrive. This can also work to the opposite effect to determine how long until a ground water source becomes uncontaminated via inflow, outflow, and volume. The residence time of lakes and streams is important as well to determine the concentration of pollutants in a lake and how this may affect the local population and marine life.

Hydrology, the study of water, discusses the water budget in terms of residence time. The amount of time that water spends in each different stage of life (glacier, atmosphere, ocean, lake, stream, river), is used to show the relation of all of the water on the earth and how it relates in its different forms.

===Pharmacology===
A large class of [[drug]]s are [[enzyme inhibitor]]s that bind to [[enzyme]]s in the body and inhibit their activity. In this case it is the drug-target residence time (the length of time the drug stays bound to the target) that is of interest. Drugs with long residence times are desirable because they remain effective for longer and therefore can be used in lower doses.&lt;ref name=Li&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Li|editor-first1=Jie Jack|editor-last2=Corey|editor-first2=E. J.|title=Drug discovery practices, processes, and perspectives|date=2013|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Hoboken, N.J.|isbn=9781118354469}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|88}} This residence time is determined by the [[pharmacokinetics|kinetics]] of the interaction and is proportional to the [[half life]] of the [[dissociation (chemistry)|chemical dissociation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Keserü|editor-first1=György|editor-last2=Swinney|editor-first2=David C.|editor-last3=Mannhold|editor-first3=Raimund|editor-last4=Kubinyi|editor-first4=Hugo|editor-last5=Folkers|editor-first5=Gerd|title=Thermodynamics and Kinetics of Drug Binding|isbn=9783527335824}}&lt;/ref&gt; One way to measure the residence time is in a ''preincubation-dilution'' experiment where a target enzyme is incubated with the inhibitor, allowed to approach equilibrium, then rapidly diluted. The amount of product is measured and compared to a control in which no inhibitor is added.&lt;ref name=Li/&gt;{{rp|87–88}}

Residence time can also refer to the amount of time that a drug spends in the part of the body where it needs to be absorbed. The longer the residence time, the more of it can be absorbed. If the drug is delivered in an oral form and destined for the [[Gastrointestinal tract|upper intestines]], it usually moves with food and its residence time is roughly that of the food. This generally allows 3 to 8 hours for absorption.&lt;ref name=Mitra&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Mitra|editor-first1=Ashim K.|editor-last2=Kwatra|editor-first2=Deep|editor-last3=Vadlapudi|editor-first3=Aswani Dutt|title=Drug Delivery|date=2014|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers|isbn=9781449674267}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|196}} If the drug is delivered through a [[mucous membrane]] in the mouth, the residence time is short because [[saliva]] washes it away. Strategies to increase this residence time include [[bioadhesive]] [[polymers]], gums, [[lozenge]]s and dry powders.&lt;ref name=Mitra/&gt;{{rp|274}}

===Queuing theory===
Beyond fluid dynamics and chemistry, the definition(s) of residence time can be applied to any [[flow network]], where the flows of generic "resources" is modeled (e.g.: people, cars, money, products). Most notably, the over-mentioned definition of residence time is extended to stationary random processes by averaging on time ([[fluid limit]]), obtaining the so-called [[Little's Law]], which is a prominent relation in [[queueing theory]] and [[supply chain management]]. In the context of queueing theory, the residence time is addressed as ''waiting time'', while in the context of supply chain management it is most often addressed as ''[[lead time]]''.

===Biochemical===
In [[size-exclusion chromatography]], the residence time of a molecule is related to its volume, which is roughly proportional to its molecular weight. Residence times also affect the performance of [[continuous fermentation|continuous fermentors]].&lt;ref name=Nauman/&gt;

==Robosquirrels==

===Background===
[[Donald H. Owings|Donald Owings]] observed an interesting phenomenon during research in the field: when a [[California ground squirrel]] comes across a [[rattlesnake]], it often raises its tail and waves it from side to side.&lt;ref name = Kobashi&gt;
{{cite news|last=Kobashi|first=Kerry|title=Robo Squirrel: Your Tax Dollars In Action|url=http://www.kerryonworld.com/government/robo-squirrel-your-tax-dollars-in-action|accessdate=8 February 2013|newspaper=Kerry On World|date=November 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Owings (Department of Psychology and his graduate student at the time, Aaron Rundus, began collaborating with Sanjay Joshi (Department of Mechanical/Aeronautical Engineering) at [[University of California, Davis]]. They used an [[Thermographic camera|infrared camera]] to [[videotape]] how snakes and squirrels behaviorally interact. They found that a squirrel shunts blood to its tail and thereby heats it up when encountering a rattlesnake but not for non-poisonous snakes.&lt;ref name = Kobashi/&gt;&lt;ref name = Rundus&gt;
{{cite journal|last=Rundus|first=Aaron S.|author2=Donald H. Owings |author3=Sanjay S. Joshi |author4=Erin Chinn |author5=Nicolas Giannini |title=Ground squirrels use an infrared signal to deter rattlesnake predation|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|year=2007|volume=104|issue=36|pages=14372–14376|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/104/36/14372|doi=10.1073/pnas.0702599104 |pmid=17704254 |pmc=1950100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rattlesnakes were known to use [[Rattlesnake#Sensory organs|infrared radiation]] to detect prey, but what they discovered suggests that the squirrels evolved the ability to communicate with rattlesnakes by heating up their tails and thereby signalling with infrared radiation.&lt;ref name = Rundus/&gt;

To test this hypothesis, they built a robotic squirrel (robosquirrel) that could behaviorally respond to rattlesnakes when they moved. They found that when robosquirrel waved a heated tail in response to the movement of a rattlesnake, the snake became defensive (i.e., it moved away from the robotic squirrel) rather than predatory. If robosquirrel waved an unheated tail, then the rattlesnake continued its predatory behavior.&lt;ref name = Rundus/&gt;

The next step was to determine whether squirrel behavior when rattlesnakes had not been encountered reduced the predatory behavior of rattlesnakes waiting in ambush. They video-recorded predatory behavior of rattlesnakes when ground squirrels flagged their tails. The researchers found that tail-flagging decreased the likelihood that rattlesnakes would strike and increased the likelihood that they would move away from that area.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|last=Barbour|first=M. A.|author2=Clark R. W. |title=Ground squirrel tail-flag displays alter both predatory strike and ambush site selection behaviours of rattlesnakes|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]]|year=2012|volume=279|issue=1743|pages=3827–3833|doi=10.1098/rspb.2012.1112|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/279/1743/3827.long|accessdate=10 February 2013|pmid=22787023|pmc=3415919}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They found that California ground squirrels are actually performing two types of tail flagging: ''vigilance advertising'' and ''perception advertising''. Vigilance advertising is hypothesized to occur when a squirrel enters an area that may contain rattlesnakes. By tail flagging, a squirrel may be signaling to a snake that it is vigilant and prepared to dodge any attacks. Perception advertising is hypothesized to occur when a squirrel encounters a rattlesnake and its tail flagging functions to signal to the snake that it is prepared to respond to attack and to warn other squirrels of the presence of rattlesnakes.&lt;ref name = NSFa/&gt;

To test these hypotheses about the function of tail flagging, they built robosquirrel to record encounters with rattlesnakes. Robosquirrel was programmed to wag its tail in the presence of a snake and its tail temperature can increase above its body temperature when it encounters snakes. The robosquirrel behaviors presented to rattlesnakes in naturalistic contexts can be precisely controlled. This control of behavior is impossible with living squirrels and so robosquirrel allows researchers to investigate how rattlesnakes respond to specific behaviors.&lt;ref name = NSFa/&gt;

===Versions===

====Laboratory RoboSquirrel====
The first robosquirrel was built using a taxidermically mounted adult female California ground squirrel.&lt;ref name = Rundus/&gt; The tail was moved by a [[servo motor|servo]], which allowed robosquirrel to flag it tail at specified intervals. [[MATLAB]] software via a mini synchronous serial channel [[microcontroller]], controlled the tail-flagging of robosquirrel.&lt;ref name = Joshi/&gt;

To control the temperature of the interior of robosquirrel’s body, a coiled [[Nichrome]] 80 resistance wire was inserted and a [[cartridge heater]] was inserted into its tail. The temperature of the Nichrome wire and the cartridge heater were controlled by [[thermostat]]s wired with [[thermocouple]]s that were placed inside its body and tail. Power to the two heaters was regulated via the thermostats by using a [[PID controller|proportional-integral differential]] (PID) control loop to regulate the [[duty cycle]] of the power relays.&lt;ref name = Joshi/&gt;

An overhead camera videotaped the arena in which robosquirrel was mounted on a wooden stage beneath which were the theromostats and heater [[relays]]. A Rattlesnake was marked by attaching a small red [[light-emitting diode]] (LED) it. When a snake entered the arena, the images from the arena were analyzed by a [[Computer program|program]] written in MATLAB that determined the distance between the squirrel and the LED. The program then calculated the rate of tail flagging based on the distance between the LED and robosquirrel. As the distance between the squirrel and LED on the rattlesnake decreased, robosquirrel increased its rate of tail flagging. The rates of tail flagging were based on previous field observations.&lt;ref name = Joshi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hennessy|first=D. F. |author2=D. H. Owings |author3=M. P. Rowe |author4=R.

Leger|title=he information afforded by a variable signal: Constraints on snake-elicited tail flagging by California ground squirrels|journal=Behaviour|year=1981|volume=78|issue=3/4|pages=188–226|doi=10.1163/156853981X00329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Field RoboSquirrels====

=====First Version=====
The first version of the field robosquirrel was a modification of the laboratory robosquirrel. The heating system of laboratory robosquirrel was repackaged in a toolbox for easy transportation and a [[Duracell]] Power-pack [[Power inverter|inverter]] provided power for the heaters and thermostats. Instead of using a desktop computer to process images and control tail flagging, an 8-b radio controller allowed a remote control to be used instead.&lt;ref name = Joshi/&gt;

Testing of robosquirrel was conducted at the Santa Margarita Ecological Reserve (SMER) near [[Fallbrook, California|Fallbrook]], [[California]], operated by [[San Diego State University]]. Six [[Crotalus ruber|red diamond rattlesnakes]] (''Crotalus ruber'') were radio tagged for the study. For test trials, one observer positioned robosquirrel and controlled its tail flagging, while another observer monitored the rattlesnake’s response to robosquirrel.&lt;ref name = Joshi/&gt;

The researchers, however, ran into problems. First, the outdoor robosquirrel was heavy and difficult to transport, requiring two or three people to carry it. Robosquirrel had to be moved across rough terrain and, at the same time, the researchers had to watch out for [[venomous snake]]s, [[tarantula]]s, and [[Cougar|mountain lions]]. Second, rattlesnakes located themselves in a variety of ambush sites. Each site presented different challenges in setting up robosquirrel. The researchers concluded that they had to redesign robosquirrel to be less complicated to set up for each new habitat.&lt;ref name = Joshi/&gt;

=====Second Version=====
To redesign a more field-usable robosquirrel, custom electronics were developed to reduce bulk and weight. In addition to previous features, new features were added such as onboard cameras and [[Data logger|data logging]]. To reduce weight, all power sources were placed in a small box underneath robosquirrel.&lt;ref name = Joshi/&gt;

The new robosquirrel design used an ATmega128 [[microprocessor]] with 4 kB of data memory and 128 kB of program memory. The microprocessor was mounted on a custom designed, two-layer [[printed circuit board]] with a DB9 [[serial port]] for [[RS-232]] communication and an [[Secure Digital|SD]] card slot for data storage. The circuit board also had a [[Joint Test Action Group]] port for programming and [[radio control]] hardware. The main program ran in a loop that repeatedly checked for input from the remote control.&lt;ref name = Joshi/&gt;

Nichrome heating elements were controlled by [[pulse-width modulation]] (PWM) of [[transistor]]s. Tail flagging was controlled by a 16-b counter in fast-PWM compare-match mode connected to the same [[Hitec]] servo. For this version of robosquirrel, the tail servo was mounted inside robosquirrel, allowing more realistic tail-flagging. A premade receiver–transmitter kit Radio allowed user control of robosquirrel. A camera allowed for positioning of robosquirrel relative to a rattlesnake and for monitoring of a snake.&lt;ref name = Joshi/&gt;

Robosquirrel was deployed at Camp Ohlone in the [[Sunol Regional Wilderness|Sunol Regional Park]] in [[Sunol, California|Sunol]], California. This site was selected because it has large populations of ground squirrels and rattlesnakes. Seventeen snakes were captured and [[Radio-frequency identification|radio tagged]] so that they could be tracked. Initial results with the new robosquirrel indicated that rattlesnakes abandon their ambush sites more quickly when robosquirrel tail-flagged than when it did not as predicted.&lt;ref name = Joshi/&gt;

===When robot squirrels attack – (CA) $325,000===
Senator Tom Colburn's ''Wastebook 2012'' listed robosquirrel as an example of wasteful government spending:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In this corner with a triangular-shaped head, a rattle on its tail, with a venomous bite is the rattlesnake.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
And in the other corner, whistling and chirping, covered in fur with a bushy tail, is the squirrel.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
These two critters are long-time adversaries. Squirrels are frequently preyed upon by the rattlesnakes, but the snakes rarely attack squirrels who are wagging their tales. When they do, they usually miss the fast moving squirrel.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
But what happens when a snake is confronted by a robot squirrel, built to look, act, and even smell like the real thing?
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Researchers at San Diego State University and the University of California (Davis) spent a portion of a $325,000 National Science Foundation (NSF) grant to construct a robotic squirrel named “RoboSquirrel” to answer that question….
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
During these difficult fiscal times of massive deficits, paying $325,000 for a robot squirrel seems a bit squirrelly. (pp. 20–21)&lt;ref name ="Wastebook 2012"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The robosquirrel project was one of 10 projects listed in his October 15, 2012 press release,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Coburn|first=Tom|title=Coburn Releases Annual Report Highlighting Some of the Most Wasteful Government Spending in 2012|url=http://www.coburn.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/pressreleases?ContentRecord_id=3b872d11-b6b5-4f72-9a0f-f95c79c99b6f&amp;ContentType_id=d741b7a7-7863-4223-9904-8cb9378aa03a&amp;Group_id=7a55cb96-4639-4dac-8c0c-99a4a227bd3a|accessdate=9 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130226064830/http://www.coburn.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/pressreleases?ContentRecord_id=3b872d11-b6b5-4f72-9a0f-f95c79c99b6f&amp;ContentType_id=d741b7a7-7863-4223-9904-8cb9378aa03a&amp;Group_id=7a55cb96-4639-4dac-8c0c-99a4a227bd3a|archivedate=26 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was singled out by many major news outlets as illustrated by the titles of news articles (e.g., "Robo-squirrel, video game on government pork list" in [[USA Today]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Robo-squirrel, video game on government pork list|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/onpolitics/2012/10/16/tom-coburn-wasteful-government-spending/1636067/|accessdate=9 February 2013|newspaper=USA Today|date=October 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref name = CNNc/&gt;&lt;ref name = abcnewsc/&gt;&lt;ref name =foxnewsc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bradford|first=Harry|title=Wastebook 2012: 'Robosquirrel,' Mars Menu Among Ways The Government Is Wasting Money|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/17/wastebook-2012-robosquirrel-goverment-waste_n_1973800.html|accessdate=9 February 2013|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=October 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response to criticism===
The main response to Senator Coburn's criticism that "During these difficult fiscal times of massive deficits, paying $325,000 for a robot squirrel seems a bit squirrelly" is that the robosquirrel (i.e., second field version) in question cost only a few hundred dollars.&lt;ref name = Kreuger/&gt; Most of the funding has gone toward the education of future scientists and engineers.&lt;ref name = facts/&gt;&lt;ref name = Kobashi/&gt;&lt;ref name = Clark/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Caitlin|title=Robotic squirrel is investment in education, not waste|url=http://www.thedailyaztec.com/2012/10/robotic-squirrel-is-investment-in-education-not-waste/|accessdate=15 March 2013|newspaper=The Daily Aztec|date=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The science and engineering in the project furthers the advancement of biorobotics and the study of [[ethology|animal behavior]] and its evolution by building on previous research using biorobotics in animal behavior research.&lt;ref name = NSFa/&gt;&lt;ref name =WSJ/&gt;

====Use of federal funds====
On July 1, 2010 (the estimated end date is June 30, 2014), the National Science Foundation began funding a research proposal by Rulon Clark (San Diego State University) and Sanjay Joshi (University of California, Davis) entitled "Understanding predator-prey signaling interactions: the dynamics of antisnake displays in ground squirrels and [[kangaroo rat]]s." They proposed to investigate the function and evolution of [[animal communication]] between predators and prey using robots that can interact with predators. They also stated in their proposal that their research project would support and provide training for future scientists and engineers.&lt;ref name =NSFfunding/&gt;

====Accounting of federal funds====
The researchers reported that they were awarded $390,000 for a 4-year study in 2010 by NSF. Their universities take about one third of the funds in [[indirect costs]], which go for [[Overhead (business)|overhead]], for example, to building maintenance, energy costs, and scholarships for students. This leaves approximately $260,000 over four years for the research project itself. Most of these funds go towards supporting biology and engineering students who help conduct the proposed research. They estimate that of the direct and indirect budget categories in their NSF grant, nearly $273,000 or 70% of the total funds go to training and support for students. They report that 34 students have received training so far in this research project. They also report that of the funds awarded by NSF, $13,700 has or will be spent on [[biorobotics]] over the four years of this study, which is 3.5% of the total funds.&lt;ref name =facts/&gt;&lt;ref name = Clark&gt;{{cite web|last=Clark|first=Rulon|title=Funding|url=http://www.bio.sdsu.edu/pub/clark/Site_3/Funding.html|publisher=SDSU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Material safety data sheet.JPG|thumb|250px|An example SDS in a US format provides guidance for handling a [[Dangerous goods|hazardous substance]] and information on its composition and properties.]]

A '''safety data sheet''' ('''SDS'''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unece.org/trans/danger/publi/ghs/ghs_rev04/04files_e.htmlUnited|title=Transport -  Transport - UNECE|website=Unece.org|accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''material safety data sheet''' ('''MSDS'''),  or '''product safety data sheet''' ('''PSDS''') is a document that lists information relating to [[occupational safety and health]] for the use of various substances and products. SDSs are a widely used system for cataloging information on [[chemical]]s, [[chemical compound]]s, and chemical [[mixture]]s. SDS information may include instructions for the safe use and potential [[worker safety and health|hazards]] associated with a particular material or product, along with spill-handling procedures. SDS formats can vary from source to source within a country depending on national requirements.

A SDS for a substance is not primarily intended for use by the general consumer, focusing instead on the hazards of working with the material in an occupational setting. There is also a duty to properly label substances on the basis of physico-chemical, health or environmental risk. Labels can include hazard symbols such as the [[Chemical hazard label#Chemical hazard|European Union standard]] symbols. The same product (e.g. paints sold under identical brand names by the same company) can have different formulations in different countries. The formulation and hazard of a product using a generic name may vary between manufacturers in the same country.

==Globally Harmonized System==
The [[Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals]] contains a standard specification for safety data sheets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/Publications/OSHA3514.html|title=Hazard Communication Standard: Safety Data Sheets|last=|first=|date=|website=U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration|access-date=2017-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The SDS follows a 16 section format which is internationally agreed and for substances especially, the SDS should be followed with an Annex which contains the exposure scenarios of this particular substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guidance.echa.europa.eu/exposure_scenarios_en.htm|title=Guidance - ECHA|website=Guidance.echa.europa.eu|accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 16 sections are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/Notice.do?val=516832:cs&amp;lang=pl&amp;list=643062:cs,522140:cs,521353:cs,516832:cs,&amp;pos=4&amp;page=1&amp;nbl=4&amp;pgs=10&amp;hwords=&amp;checktexte=checkbox&amp;visu=|title=EUR-Lex - Einfache Suche|date=29 October 2013|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=22 December 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029213855/http://eur-lex.europa.eu/Notice.do?val=516832:cs&amp;lang=pl&amp;list=643062:cs,522140:cs,521353:cs,516832:cs,&amp;pos=4&amp;page=1&amp;nbl=4&amp;pgs=10&amp;hwords=&amp;checktexte=checkbox&amp;visu=|archivedate=29 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National and international requirements==

===Canada===

In [[Canada]], the program known as the [[Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System]] (WHMIS) establishes the requirements for SDSs in workplaces and is administered federally by [[Health Canada]] under the [[Hazardous Products Act]], Part II, and the [[Controlled Products Regulations]].

===European Union===
Safety data sheets have been made an integral part of the system of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 (REACH).&lt;ref&gt;Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), establishing a European Chemicals Agency, amending Directive 1999/45/EC and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 793/93 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1488/94 as well as Council Directive 76/769/EEC and Commission Directives 91/155/EEC, 93/67/EEC, 93/105/EC and 2000/21/EC (OJ L 396, 30.12.2006, corrected version in OJ L136, 29.5.2007, p.3).&lt;/ref&gt; The original requirements of REACH for SDSs have been further adapted to take into account the rules for safety data sheets of the Global Harmonised System (GHS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unece.org/trans/danger/publi/ghs/ghs_rev03/03files_e.html|title=GHS (Rev.3) (2009) -  Transport - UNECE|website=Unece.org|accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the implementation of other elements of the GHS into EU legislation that were introduced by Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 (CLP)&lt;ref&gt;Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures amending and repealing Directives 67/548/EEC and 1999/45/EC, and amending Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 (OJ L 353, 31.12.2008, p.1)&lt;/ref&gt; via an update to Annex II of REACH.&lt;ref&gt;Commission Regulation (EU) No 453/2010 of 20 May 2010 amending Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) (O.J. L133 31.05.2010, p1-43)&lt;/ref&gt;

The SDS must be supplied in an official language of the Member State(s) where the substance or mixture is placed on the market, unless the Member State(s) concerned provide(s) otherwise (Article 31(5) of REACH).

The [[European Chemicals Agency]] (ECHA) has published a guidance document on the compilation of safety data sheets.

===Germany===
The German Federal Water Management Act requires that substances be evaluated for negative influence on the physical, [[chemical]] or [[biology|biological]] characteristics of water. These are classified into numeric water hazard classes (WGK or WHC, depending on whether you use the German or English abbreviation).
*WGK nwg: Non-water polluting substance
*WGK 1: Slightly water polluting substance
*WGK 2: Water polluting substance
*WGK 3: Highly water polluting substance

=== South Africa ===
This section contributes to a better understanding of the regulations governing SDS within the [[South Africa]]n framework. As regulations may change, it is the responsibility of the reader to verify the validity of the regulations mentioned in text.

As [[Globalization|globalisation]] increased and countries engaged in cross-border trade, the quantity of [[Dangerous goods|hazardous material]] crossing international borders amplified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.spatial.ucsb.edu/janelle/docs/Janelle-globalization.pdf|title = Globalization and research issues in transportation|last = Janelle|first = Donald G|date = 1997|journal = Journal of Transport Geography|access-date = 26 January 2016|last2 = Beuthe|first2 = Michel|publisher = Elsevier Science Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Realising the detrimental effects of hazardous trade, the [[United Nations]] established a committee of experts specialising in the transportation of [[hazardous goods]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Dangerous Goods Digest - The Orange Book of Southern Africa|last = |first = |publisher = Foresight Publications|year = 2015|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee provides best practises governing the conveyance of [[Hazardous goods|hazardous materials]] and goods for land including road and railway; air as well as sea transportation. These best practises are constantly updated to remain current and relevant.

There are various other international bodies who provide greater detail and guidance for specific modes of transportation such as the [https://www.google.co.za/search?q=International+Maritime+Organisation+(IMO)&amp;oq=International+Maritime+Organisation+(IMO)&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.1212j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=93&amp;ie=UTF-8 International Maritime Organisation (IMO)] by means of the International Maritime Code&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = About IMO|url = http://www.imo.org/en/About/Pages/Default.aspx|website =Imo.org|access-date = 2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the [[International Civil Aviation Organization|International Civil Aviation Organisation]] (ICAO) via the Technical Instructions for the safe transport of dangerous goods by air&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Annex 18|url = http://www.icao.int/safety/DangerousGoods/Pages/annex-18.aspx|website =Icao.int|access-date = 2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[International Air Transport Association|International Air Transport Association (IATA)]] who provides regulations for the transport of dangerous goods.

These guidelines prescribed by the international authorities are applicable to the South African land, sea and air transportation of hazardous materials and goods. In addition to these rules and regulations to International best practice, South Africa has also implemented common laws which are laws based on custom and practise. Common laws are a vital part of maintaining public order and forms the basis of case laws. Case laws, using the principles of common law are interpretations and decisions of statutes made by courts. Acts of parliament are determinations and regulations by parliament which form the foundation of statutory law. Statutory laws are published in the government gazette or on the official website. Lastly, subordinate legislation are the bylaws issued by local authorities and authorised by parliament.

Statutory law gives effect to the Occupational Health and Safety Act of 1993 and the National Road Traffic Act of 1996. The Occupational Health and Safety Act details the necessary provisions for the safe handling and storage of hazardous materials and goods whilst the transport act details with the necessary provisions for the transportation of the hazardous goods.

Relevant South African legislation includes the Occupational Health and Safety Act of 1993,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Occupational Health and Safety Act, 1993 (Act No. 85 of 1993)|url = http://www.acts.co.za/occupational-health-and-safety-act-1993/index.html?occupational_health_and_safety_act_1993.php|website =Acts.co.za|access-date = 2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; the National Road Traffic Act of 1996,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = National Road Traffic Act, 1996 (Act No. 93 of 1996)|url = http://www.acts.co.za/national-road-traffic-act-1996/|website =Acts.co.za|access-date = 2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Standards Act of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Standards Act, 2008 (Act No. 8 of 2008)|url = http://www.acts.co.za/standards-act-2008/index.html|website =Acts.co.za|access-date = 2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SABS - ABOUT SABS OVERVIEW|url = https://www.sabs.co.za/About-SABS/Index.asp|website =Sabs.co.za|access-date = 2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been selective incorporation of aspects of the [[Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals|Globally Harmonised System (GHS) of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals]] into South African legislation. At each point of the chemical value chain, there is a responsibility to manage chemicals in a safe and responsible manner. SDS is therefore required by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Health and safety laws update July 2015|url = http://sheqafrica.com/health-and-safety-laws-3/|website = Sheqafrica.com|access-date = 2016-02-10|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; A SDS is included in the requirements of Occupational Health and Safety Act, 1993 (Act No.85 of 1993) Regulation 1179 dated 25 August 1995.

The categories of information supplied in the SDS are listed in SANS 11014:2010; dangerous goods standards – Classification and information. SANS 11014:2010 supersedes the first edition SANS 11014-1:1994 and is an identical implementation of ISO 11014:2009. According to SANS 11014:2010:

===The Netherlands===
Dutch Safety Data Sheets are well known as veiligheidsinformatieblad [[:nl:Veiligheidsinformatieblad]] or Chemiekaarten. This is a collection of Safety Data Sheets of the most widely used chemicals. The Chemiekaarten boek is commercially available, but also made available through educational institutes, such as the web site offered by the university of Groningen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icsds.com/|title=ICSDS, Source of all your needs on GHS SDS for an affordable fee|website=Icsds.com|accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom|U.K.]], the Chemicals (Hazard Information and Packaging for Supply) Regulations 2002 - known as CHIP Regulations - impose duties upon suppliers, and importers into the EU, of [[Dangerous goods|hazardous materials]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2002/20021689.htm|title=The Chemicals (Hazard Information and Packaging for Supply) Regulations 2002|website=Opsi.gov.uk|accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NOTE: Safety data sheets (SDS) are no longer covered by the CHIP regulations.  The laws that require a SDS to be provided have been transferred to the European REACH Regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/chip/|title=Redirect to... Chemical classification|website=Hse.gov.uk|accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[COSHH|Control of Substances Hazardous to Health]] (COSHH) Regulations govern the use of hazardous substances in the workplace in the UK and specifically require an assessment of the use of a substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/coshh|title=Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH)|website=Hse.gov.uk|accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regulation 12 requires that an employer provides employees with information, instruction and training for people exposed to hazardous substances. This duty would be very nearly impossible without the data sheet as a starting point. It is important for employers therefore to insist on receiving a data sheet from a supplier of a substance.

The duty to supply information is not confined to informing only business users of products. SDSs for retail products sold by large DIY shops are usually obtainable on those companies' web sites.

Web sites of manufacturers and large suppliers do not always include them even if the information is obtainable from retailers but written or telephone requests for paper copies will usually be responded to favourably.

===United Nations===
The [[United Nations]] (UN) defines certain details used in SDSs such as the [[UN number]]s used to identify some [[Dangerous goods|hazardous materials]] in a standard form while in international transit.

===United States===
In the [[United States|U.S.]], the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] requires that SDSs be readily available to all employees for potentially harmful substances handled in the workplace under the Hazard Communication regulation. The SDS is also required to be made available to local fire departments and local and state emergency planning officials under Section 311 of the  [[Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act]]. The [[American Chemical Society]] defines Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Numbers ([[CAS number]]s) which provide a unique number for each chemical and are also used internationally in SDSs.

Reviews of material safety data sheets by the [[U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board]] have detected dangerous deficiencies.
 
The board’s Combustible Dust Hazard Study analyzed 140 data sheets of substances capable of producing combustible dusts.&lt;ref name="CSB dust study"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csb.gov/assets/1/19/Dust_Final_Report_Website_11-17-06.pdf|format=PDF|title=U.S Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, Investigation Report, Combustible Dust Hazard Study, Report No. 2006-H-1|date=November 2006|pages=38, 88-95|website=Csb.gov|accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; None of the SDSs contained all the information the board said was needed to work with the material safely, and 41 percent failed to even mention that the substance was combustible.

As part of its study of an explosion and fire that destroyed the Barton Solvents facility in Valley Center, Kansas, in 2007, the safety board reviewed 62 material safety data sheets for commonly used nonconductive flammable liquids.  As in the combustible dust study, the board found all the data sheets inadequate.&lt;ref name="CSB Barton Solvents KS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chemsafety.gov/assets/document/CSB_Study_Barton_Final.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008015433/http://www.chemsafety.gov/assets/document/CSB_Study_Barton_Final.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-08 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the US adopted the 16 section Safety Data Sheet to replace Material Safety Data Sheets. This became effective on December 1, 2013. These new Safety Data Sheets comply with the [[Globally_Harmonized_System_of_Classification_and_Labelling_of_Chemicals|Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals]] (GHS). By June 1, 2015, employers were required to have their workplace labeling and hazard communication programs updated as necessary – including all MSDSs replaced with SDS-formatted documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = GHS Overview - SafeTec|url = http://www.safetec.net/resources/ghs-overview/|website =Safetec.net|access-date = 2016-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==SDS authoring==
Many companies offer the service of collecting, or writing and revising, data sheets to ensure they are up to date and available for their subscribers or users. Some jurisdictions impose an explicit [[duty of care]] that each SDS be regularly updated, usually every three to five years.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} However, when new information becomes available, the SDS must be revised without delay.&lt;ref&gt;

'''''Sex, Slander, and Salvation (Investigating The Family/Children of God)''''' was a 1994 book edited by [[J. Gordon Melton]] and  [[James R. Lewis (scholar)|James R.

The introduction was written by [[James R. Lewis (scholar)|James R. Lewis]].

==Critical reception==
[[Robert Balch]], critiquing the book in a 1996 issue of ''[[Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion]]'', wrote that the book suffered from a "methodological flaw running throughout the book."&lt;ref name="JSSR"/&gt; According to Balch sources of information were limited exclusively to committed members and Family literature failing to triangulate it with ex-member testimony.&lt;ref name="JSSR"/&gt; Balch also expressed concern about the scholars being subjected to [[impression management]] by the Family thus skewing their research data.&lt;ref name="JSSR"/&gt; Balch concluded that it was a book worth having for the information on the Family but also for the "serious questions it raises about bias in the way new religions are studied."&lt;ref name="JSSR"/&gt;

Richard Singelenberg discussed the book in a review he wrote for the ''[[Journal of Contemporary Religion]]''; he wrote favorably on it but identified two flaws he found in the book.
&lt;ref name='JofContempRelgio'&gt;{{cite journal | title = Sex, Slander, and Salvation (Investigating The Family/Children of God) [Book Review] | first9 = Richard | last10 = Goddard | first10 = Hugh | last11 = Morgan | first11 = Peggy | last12 = McKay | first12 = Heather A. | last13 = Chalcraft | first13 = David | last14 = Coleman | first14 = Simon M. | last9 = Singelenberg | first8 = Martyn | last8 = Percy | author8-link = Martyn Percy| first7 = B.

Singelenberg lamented the fact that ''Sex, Slander, and Salvation'' was published just before [[David Berg|David Berg's]] death and the [[Family International#The Family (1995–2003)|Love Charter]]'s reorganization of the [[Family International]].&lt;ref name="JofContempRelgio"/&gt; Singelenberg emphasized the two events would be sure to have "profound effects" on the Family.&lt;ref name="JofContempRelgio"/&gt;

James D. Chancellor, a Christian researcher who undertook his own study of The Family, wrote in ''Toward Reflexive Ethnography: Participating, Observing, Narrating'' (2001) that "a number of insightful articles" in ''Sex, Slander and Salvation'' were among "the most useful sources" he had consulted at the beginning of his own research.&lt;ref name="BromleyCarter2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David G.

Bromley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi]] in the 2001 book ''[[Misunderstanding Cults]]'' characterized the work as "made-to-order [[Public relations|PR]] efforts (with a few scholarly papers which got in by honest mistakes on the part of both authors and editors)" and just one of the "extreme examples of the literature of [[Cult apologist|apologetics]] that has dominated [[New religious movements|NRM]] research for years."&lt;ref name='integrity'&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Beit-Hallahmi | first1 = Benjamin | authorlink1 = Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi | title = 'Misunderstanding cults: searching for objectivity in a controversial field | chapter = 1 | editors = Benjamin David Zablocki, [[Thomas Robbins (sociologist)|Thomas Robbins]] | work = O Truant Muse': Collaborationism and Research Integrity | publisher = [[University of Toronto Press]] | date =  | year = 2001 | pages = 48–49| isbn = 978-0-8020-8188-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media Homes===
[[Stephen A. Kent]] and  [[Theresa Krebs]] would later allege the use of "media homes" during the course of the researchers' studies for ''Sex, Slander and Salvation''. "Media homes" were described by Kent and Krebs as follows: "Hand-picked individuals living in these well-funded facilities went through rehearsals about how to portray themselves and the group to media, scholars, and others who might scrutinize them." Kent and Krebs also noted question-and-answer pamphlets produced by the group to prevent members from "revealing sensitive information about the group."&lt;ref name='Compromised'&gt;{{cite journal | title = Academic Compromise in the Social Scientific Study of Alternative Religions | journal = [[Nova Religio]] | date = October 1998 | first = Stephen A. | last = Kent | authorlink =Stephen A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2586">A '''signomial''' is an algebraic [[function (mathematics)|function]] of one or more independent variables.  It is perhaps most easily thought of as an algebraic extension of multi-dimensional [[polynomial]]s—an extension that permits exponents to be arbitrary real numbers (rather than just non-negative integers) while requiring the independent variables to be strictly positive (so that division by zero and other inappropriate algebraic operations are not encountered).

Formally, let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a vector of real, positive numbers.

:&lt;math&gt;X = (x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_n)^T&lt;/math&gt;

Then a signomial function has the form

: &lt;math&gt;f(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n) = \sum_{i=1}^M \left(c_i \prod_{j=1}^n x_j^{a_{ij}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where the coefficients &lt;math&gt;c_k&lt;/math&gt; and the exponents &lt;math&gt;a_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; are real numbers.  Signomials are [[Closure (mathematics)|closed]] under addition, subtraction, multiplication, and scaling.

If we restrict all &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; to be positive, then the function f is a [[posynomial]]. Consequently, each signomial is either a posynomial, the negative of a posynomial, or the difference of two posynomials.  If, in addition, all exponents &lt;math&gt;a_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; are  non-negative integers, then the signomial becomes a [[polynomial]] whose domain is the positive [[orthant]].

For example, 

: &lt;math&gt;f(x_1, x_2, x_3) = 2.7 x_1^2x_2^{-1/3}x_3^{0.7} - 2x_1^{-4}x_3^{2/5}&lt;/math&gt;

is a signomial. 

The term "signomial" was introduced by Richard J. Duffin and Elmor L. Peterson in their seminal joint work on general algebraic optimization—published in the late 1960s and early 1970s.  A recent introductory exposition involves [[optimization problem]]s.&lt;ref&gt;C. Maranas and C. Floudas, ''Global optimization in generalized geometric programming'', pp. 351–370, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although [[nonlinear optimization]] problems with [[constrained optimization|constraints]] and/or [[objective function|objectives]] defined by signomials are normally harder to solve than those defined by only posynomials (because, unlike posynomials, signomials are not guaranteed to be [[convex set|globally convex]]), signomial  optimization problems often provide a much more accurate mathematical representation of real-world nonlinear optimization problems.

In [[control engineering]], a '''single-input and single-output''' ('''SISO''') system is a simple single variable [[control system]] with one input and one output. In radio it is the use of only one [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] both in the [[transmitter]] and [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]].

==Details==
SISO systems are typically less complex than [[Multiple-input multiple-output system|multiple-input multiple-output]]&lt;!-- please don't change this link to [[MIMO]] - that page is about a different subject --&gt; (MIMO) systems. Usually, it is also easier to make order of magnitude or trending predictions "on the fly" or "back of the envelope". MIMO systems have too many interactions for most of us to trace through them quickly, thoroughly, and effectively in our heads.

Frequency domain techniques for analysis and controller design dominate SISO control system theory. [[Bode plot]], [[Nyquist stability criterion]], [[Nichols plot]], and [[root locus]] are the usual tools for SISO system analysis. Controllers can be designed through the [[polynomial]] design, root locus design methods to name just two of the more popular. Often SISO controllers will be PI, PID, or lead-lag.

'''Space weathering''' is the type of weathering that occurs to any object exposed to the harsh environment of [[outer space]].  Bodies without atmospheres (including the [[Moon]], [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], the [[asteroids]], [[comets]], and most of the moons of other planets) take on many weathering processes:
* collisions of [[galactic cosmic ray]]s and [[solar cosmic ray]]s,
* [[irradiation]], implantation, and [[sputtering]] from [[solar wind]] particles, and
* bombardment by different sizes of [[meteorites]] and [[micrometeorites]].
Space weathering is important because these processes affect the physical and [[optical properties]] of the surface of many planetary bodies.  Therefore, it is critical to understand the effects of space weathering in order to properly interpret remotely sensed data.

[[File:Weatheringcartoon.jpg|thumb|right|300px|An illustration of space weathering's different components.]]

== History ==

Much of our knowledge of the space weathering process comes from studies of the lunar samples returned by the [[Apollo program]], particularly the [[lunar soil]]s (or [[regolith]]).  The constant flux of [[high energy particles]] and [[micrometeorites]], along with larger meteorites, act to [[Comminution|comminute]], melt, [[sputter]] and [[vaporize]] components of the lunar soil.

The first products of space weathering that were recognized in lunar soils were "agglutinates".  These are created when micrometeorites melt a small amount of material, which incorporates surrounding glass and mineral fragments into a glass-welded aggregate ranging in size from a few micrometers to a few millimeters.  Agglutinates are very common in lunar soil, accounting for as much as 60 to 70% of mature soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heiken|first=Grant|title=Lunar sourcebook : a user's guide to the moon|date=1991|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-521-33444-0|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These complex and irregularly-shaped particles appear black to the human eye, largely due to the presence of [[Nanophase material|nanophase]] [[iron]].

Space weathering also produces surface-correlated products on individual soil grains, such as glass splashes; implanted [[hydrogen]], [[helium]] and other gases; [[solar flare]] tracks; and accreted components, including nanophase iron.  It wasn't until the 1990s that improved instruments, in particular [[transmission electron microscope]]s, and techniques allowed for the discovery of very thin (60-200&amp;nbsp;nm) [[patina]]s, or rims, which develop on individual lunar soil grains as a result of the redepositing of vapor from nearby micrometeorite impacts and the redeposition of material sputtered from nearby grains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

|doi=10.1016/S0016-7037(97)00085-9
|bibcode = 1997GeCoA..61.2331K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These weathering processes have large effects on the spectral properties of lunar soil, particularly in the [[ultraviolet]], [[Visible wavelength|visible]], and [[near infrared]] (UV/Vis/NIR) [[wavelengths]]. These spectral changes have largely been attributed to the inclusions of "nanophase iron" which is a ubiquitous component of both agglutinates and soil rims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Noble|first=Sarah|author2=Pieters C. M. |author3=Keller L. P. |title=An experimental approach to understanding the optical effects of space weathering|journal=Icarus|date=September 2007|volume=192|pages=629–642|bibcode = 2007Icar..192..629N |doi = 10.1016/j.icarus.2007.07.021 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These very small (one to a few hundred nanometers in diameter) blebs of metallic iron are created when iron-bearing minerals (e.g. [[olivine]] and [[pyroxene]]) are vaporized and the iron is liberated and redeposited in its native form.

== Effects on spectral properties ==

On the Moon, the spectral effects of space weathering are threefold: as the lunar surface matures it becomes darker (the [[albedo]] is reduced), redder (reflectance increases with increasing wavelength), and the depth of its diagnostic [[absorption band]]s are reduced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Pieters |first1= C. M. |last2= Fischer |first2= E. M. |last3= Rode |first3= O. |last4= Basu |first4= A. |date= 1993 |title= Optical Effects of Space Weathering: The Role of the Finest Fraction |journal= Journal of Geophysical Research |volume= 98 |issue= E11 |pages= 20,817–20,824 |doi= 10.1029/93JE02467 |issn= 0148-0227 |bibcode = 1993JGR....9820817P }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These effects are largely due to the presence of [[Nanophase material|nanophase]] iron in both the agglutinates and in the accreted rims on individual grains.  The darkening effects of space weathering are readily seen by studying lunar craters.  Young, fresh craters have bright [[ray system]]s, because they have exposed fresh, unweathered material, but over time those rays disappear as the weathering process darkens the material.

== Space weathering on asteroids ==

Space weathering is also thought to occur on asteroids,&lt;ref&gt;For a thorough review of the current state of understanding of space weathering on Asteroids, see  {{cite journal |last= Chapman |first= Clark R. |date=May 2004 |title= Space Weathering of Asteroid Surfaces |journal= Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences |volume= 32 |pages= 539–567 |doi= 10.1146/annurev.earth.32.101802.120453|bibcode = 2004AREPS..32..539C }}.&lt;/ref&gt; though the environment is quite different from the Moon. Impacts in the asteroid belt are slower, and therefore create less melt and vapor.  Also, fewer solar wind particles reach the asteroid belt.  And finally, the higher rate of impactors and lower gravity of the smaller bodies means that there is more overturn and the surface exposure ages should be younger than the [[lunar surface]].  Therefore, space weathering should occur more slowly and to a lesser degree on the surfaces of asteroids.

However, we do see evidence for asteroidal space weathering.  For years there had been a so-called "conundrum" in the planetary science community because, in general, the spectra of asteroids do not match the spectra of our collection of meteorites. Particularly, the spectra of [[S-type asteroid]]s, did not match the spectra of the most abundant type of meteorites, [[ordinary chondrite]]s (OCs). The asteroid spectra tended to be redder with a steep curvature in the visible wavelengths. However, Binzel et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Binzel |first1= R.P. |last2= Bus |first2= S.J. |last3= Burbine |first3= T.H. |last4= Sunshine |first4= J.M. |date=Aug 1996 |title= Spectral Properties of Near-Earth Asteroids: Evidence for Sources of Ordinary Chondrite Meteorites |journal= Science |volume= 273 |issue= 5277 |pages= 946–948 |doi= 10.1126/science.273.5277.946 |pmid= 8688076|bibcode = 1996Sci...273..946B }}&lt;/ref&gt; have identified near Earth asteroids with spectral properties covering the range from S-type to spectra similar to those of OC meteorites, suggesting an ongoing process is occurring that can alter the spectra of OC material to look like S-type asteroids. There is also evidence of regolith alteration from [[Galileo]]'s flybys of [[951 Gaspra|Gaspra]] and [[243 Ida|Ida]] showing spectral differences at fresh craters. With time, the spectra of Ida and Gaspra appear to redden and lose spectral contrast. Evidence from [[NEAR Shoemaker]]'s x-ray measurements of [[433 Eros|Eros]] indicate an ordinary chondrite composition despite a red-sloped, S-type spectrum, again suggesting that some process has altered the optical properties of the surface. 
Results from the [[Hayabusa]] spacecraft at the asteroid [[25143 Itokawa|Itokawa]], also ordinary chondrite in composition, shows spectral evidence of space weathering.  In addition, definitive evidence of space weathering alteration has been identified in the grains of soil returned by the Hayabusa spacecraft.  Because Itokawa is so small (550 m diameter), it was thought that the low gravity would not allow for the development of a mature regolith, however, preliminary examination of the returned samples reveals the presence of nanophase iron and other space weathering effects on several grains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |display-authors=8|author=T. Noguchi|author2=T. Nakamura|author3=M. Kimura|author4=M. E. Zolensky|author5=M. Tanaka|author6=T. Hashimoto|author7=M. Konno|author8=A. Nakato|author9=T. Ogami|author10=A. Fujimura|author11=M.

Such coatings are likely similar to the patinas found on lunar rocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hiroi|first=Takahiro|author2=Abe M. |author3=K. Kitazato |author4=S. Abe |author5=B.

There is evidence to suggest most of the color change due to weathering occurs rapidly, in the first hundred thousands years, limiting the usefulness of spectral measurement for determining the age of asteroids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sun damage conceals asteroids' true ages |author=Rachel Courtland |work=[[New Scientist]] |date=30 April 2009 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17062-sun-damage-conceals-asteroids-true-ages.html |accessdate=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Space weathering on Mercury ==

The environment at [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] also differs substantially from the Moon.  For one thing, it is significantly hotter in the day ([[Diurnal cycle|diurnal]] surface temperature ~100&amp;nbsp;°C for the Moon, ~425&amp;nbsp;°C on Mercury) and colder at night, which may alter the products of space weathering. In addition, because of its location in the Solar System, Mercury is also subjected to a slightly larger flux of micrometeorites that impact at much higher velocities than the Moon. These factors combine to make Mercury much more efficient than the Moon at creating both melt and vapor.  Per unit area, impacts on Mercury are expected to produce 13.5x the melt and 19.5x the vapor than is produced on the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Cintala |first= Mark J. |date=Jan 1992 |title= Impact-Induced Thermal Effects in the Lunar and Mercurian Regoliths |journal= Journal of Geophysical Research |volume= 97 |issue= E1 |pages= 947–973 |issn= 0148-0227 |doi= 10.1029/91JE02207|bibcode = 1992JGR....97..947C }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Agglutinitic glass-like deposits and vapor-deposited coatings should be created significantly faster and more efficiently on Mercury than on the Moon.

The UV/Vis spectrum of Mercury, as observed telescopically from Earth, is roughly linear, with a red slope.  There are no absorption bands related to Fe-bearing minerals, such as pyroxene.  This means that either there is no iron on the surface of Mercury, or else the iron in the Fe-bearing minerals has been weathered to nanophase iron.  A weathered surface would then explain the reddened slope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Hapke |first= Bruce |date=Feb 2001 |title= Space Weathering from Mercury to the asteroid belt |journal= Journal of Geophysical Research |volume= 106 |issue= E5 |pages= 10,039–10,073 |doi= 10.1029/2000JE001338|bibcode = 2001JGR...10610039H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Syntagma Musicum''''' is a book by the German musicologist [[Michael Praetorius]], published in [[Wittenberg]] and [[Wolfenbüttel]] in three parts between 1614 and 1620. It is one of the most commonly used research sources for the music theory of the seventeenth century.&lt;ref name="Herbert2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Herbert|first=Trevor|title=The Trombone|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wy8bhvi2-j8C&amp;pg=PA87|accessdate=27 February 2013|date=28 March 2006|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-10095-2|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second work ''De Organographia'' illustrates and describes musical instruments and their use; becoming a valuable resource for the research and reconstruction of early instruments.

The three volumes (a fourth was in progress but never published) were:

A climate '''tipping point''' is a point when a [[global climate]] changes from one given stable state to another stable state, much as when a wine glass, after being pushed from its base, finally tips over.  After the tipping point has been passed, a transition to a new state occurs. The tipping event may be irreversible, much like the spilling out of the wine originally contained in the glass: standing up the glass will not put the wine back.

==Definition==
The ''[[IPCC AR5]]'' report stated that precise levels of climate change sufficient to trigger a tipping point, defined as a threshold for abrupt and irreversible change, remain uncertain, and that the risk associated with crossing multiple tipping points increases with rising temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ipcc-wg2.gov/AR5/images/uploads/WG2AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf|title=Climate change 2014, Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability|year=2014|author=IPCC AR5 WGII|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150514034430/http://ipcc-wg2.gov/AR5/images/uploads/WG2AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf|archivedate=2015-05-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of climate change, an "adaptation tipping point" has been defined as "the threshold value or specific boundary condition where ecological, technical, economic, spatial or socially acceptable limits are exceeded."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ahmed|first=Farhana|last2=Khan|first2=M Shah Alam|last3=Warner|first3=Jeroen|last4=Moors|first4=Eddy|last5=Terwisscha Van Scheltinga|first5=Catharien|date=2018-06-28|title=Integrated Adaptation Tipping Points (IATPs) for urban flood resilience|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956247818776510|journal=Environment and Urbanization|language=en|pages=095624781877651|doi=10.1177/0956247818776510|issn=0956-2478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outline==
[[Global warming]] proceeds because of changes to the composition of gases in the [[Earth's atmosphere]] and Oceans by the emission of [[greenhouse gas]]es such as [[carbon dioxide]] and [[methane]]. As warming proceeds, it brings about changes to the [[natural environment]] which may result in other changes. For example, warming may begin to melt the [[Greenland ice sheet]] and/or [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet#Potential collapse|West Antarctic Ice Sheet]]. At some level of temperature rise, the melt of the entire [[ice sheet]] will become inevitable; but the ice sheet itself may persist for millennia {{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}.  A tipping point may be passed without any immediately obvious consequences, nor any acceleration of the warming process. Carbon dioxide {{as of|2012|May|lc=y}} made up 396.18 [[parts per million|ppm]] of Earth's atmosphere&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=ftp://ftp.cmdl.noaa.gov/ccg/co2/trends/co2_mm_mlo.txt | title=NOAA ESRL DATA | publisher=[[NOAA]] | date=7 May 2012 | accessdate=9 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and as of 2016 makes up 403.3 [[parts per million|ppm]] of Earth's atmosphere&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/10/31/scientists-cant-explain-a-worrying-rise-in-methane-levels/ | title=Worrying Rise | publisher=[[WMO]] | date=31 Oct 2017 | accessdate=31 Oct 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Monitoring stations in the [[Arctic]] spring 2012 measuring more than 400 ppm of the heat-trapping gas in the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Borenstein, Seth |title=Scientists: Carbon dioxide at highest level in 800,000 years |agency=[[Associated Press]] |newspaper=USA Today |date=31 May 2012 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/weather/climate/globalwarming/story/2012-05-31/carbon-dioxide-greehouse-gas-level-climate-change-global-warming/55312242/1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[James E. Hansen]] said that this tipping point had already been reached in April 2008 when the {{CO2}} level was 385 ppm. (Hansen states 350 ppm as the upper limit.)  "Further global warming of 1[[Celsius|°C]] defines a critical threshold. Beyond that we will likely see changes that make [[Earth]] a different planet than the one we know."&lt;ref&gt;[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5g2Wkbo6PcynAVeJzSPWDQZaWAI8g Earth in crisis, warns NASA's top climate scientist] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412094147/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5g2Wkbo6PcynAVeJzSPWDQZaWAI8g |date=2008-04-12 }} [[PhysOrg.com]], April 07, 2008 . Accessed August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  He has further suggested potential projections of [[runaway climate change]] on Earth, in his book ''[[Storms of My Grandchildren]]''.

Some scientists and other specialists sometimes express concern about global warming and irreversible tipping points, and use metaphors such as "the door is closing"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Luderer|first1=Gunnar|last2=Pietzcker|first2=Robert C|last3=Bertram|first3=Christoph|last4=Kriegler|first4=Elmar|last5=Meinshausen|first5=Malte|last6=Edenhofer|first6=Ottmar|title=Economic mitigation challenges: how further delay closes the door for achieving climate targets|journal=Environmental Research Letters|date=1 September 2013|volume=8|issue=3|pages=034033|doi=10.1088/1748-9326/8/3/034033|bibcode=2013ERL.....8c4033L}}&lt;/ref&gt; and warn of global [[famine|food]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} and [[water shortages]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}, hundreds of millions of people being displaced by [[rising sea levels]], famine, unhealthy and unlivable conditions, and storms becoming ever more frequent and severe worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gainesville.com/article/20120422/OPINION03/120429946/-1/news?Title=Marshall-Saunders-Earth-to-mankind | title=Earth to mankind | last=Saunders | first=Marshall | publisher=The [[Gainesville Sun]] | date=22 April 2012 | accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have tried systematically to short-list large scale components of the Earth system that may be subject to tipping points, defining tipping points as a variety of phenomena, including the onset of [[positive feedback]], [[hysteresis]] effects, and the possible effect of statistical [[noise]] at critical points.&lt;ref name=Lenton08/&gt;

==Arctic sea ice==
In 2013, a study noted that there is an ongoing debate as to whether Arctic sea ice has already passed a "tipping point", or if it is likely in the future. They pointed out, ''"Several recent studies argue that the loss of summer sea ice does not involve an irreversible bifurcation, because it is highly reversible in models"''. The study identified in 2007 abrupt transition in seasonal variability which persisted since then, and made a distinction between [[Bifurcation theory|bifurcation]] and non-bifurcation ‘tipping point'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A recent tipping point in the Arctic sea-ice cover: abrupt and persistent increase in the seasonal cycle since 2007|year=2013|authors=Valerie N.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7950">Bilingual educational theory that states that [[child]]ren can most easily acquire [[fluency]] in a [[second language]] by first acquiring fluency in their [[first language|native language]].  Fluency is defined as linguistic fluency (such as speaking) as well as literacy (such as reading and writing).  This approach to bilingual education is among those most commonly implemented in public schools across the United States.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Ramirez, David J., Yuen, Sandra D., and Ramey, Dena R. "Final Report: Longitudinal Study of Structured English Immersion Strategy, Early-Exit and Late-Exit Transitional Bilingual Education Programs for Language Minority Children." Aguirre International, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of transitional bilingual education is to help transition a student into an English-only classroom as quickly as possible.  A bilingual teacher teaches children in subjects such as math, science, and social studies in their native language so that once the transition is made to an English-only classroom, the student has the knowledge necessary to compete with his peers in all other subject areas.&lt;ref&gt; Gersten, Russell; Woodward, John. "A Longitudinal Study of Transitional and Immersion Bilingual Education Programs in One District." The Elementary School Journal. Volume 95, Issue 3, Jan. 1995, pp. 223-239.&lt;/ref&gt;  Transitional Bilingual Education programs are introduced in kindergarten and can continue up to grade six or seven.  Research has shown that many of the skills learned in the native language can easily be transferred to the second language later.  This research reflects greater academic progress made by students in Transitional Bilingual Education programs in comparison with those enrolled in many [[English as a second or foreign language|English as a Second Language]] (ESL) programs.  However, it also shows the relative ineffectiveness of Transitional Bilingual Education programs when compared with other bilingual models such as [[Dual language|dual-language immersion]].  ESL courses are sometimes incorporated to provide supplemental instruction.  The application of this educational model ultimately came about as a result of an effort to officially recognize Chicano and Latino identities with the passage of the [[Bilingual Education Act]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Transitional Bilingual Education programs are divided into two categories: early-exit and late-exit.  Early-exit programs begin with strong support in the students' native language; nevertheless, this support is rapidly diminished.  Late-exit programs, on the other hand, maintain strong support in the primary language.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Spolsky, Bernard; Hult, Francis M. The Handbook of Educational Linguistics. Wiley-Blackwell, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  The fundamental difference between these two models is the length of the program.

==Early-Exit Transitional Bilingual Education==
The main goal of early-exit programs is to expedite the acquisition of the second language so that language learners can be integrated into classrooms with native speakers.  Less emphasis is placed on progress made in other subjects.  There is not much importance assigned to the continued development of first-language skills.  After one to three years in the program, students are expected to have acquired enough knowledge in the second language to be transferred to classes in which only the second language is used as a medium of instruction.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  In early-exit programs, a near-native proficiency in the target language is required of instructors.  Institutions may vary in the amount of first-language instruction that is utilized.&lt;ref&gt; Dolson, David P.; Mayer, Jan. “Longitudinal Study of Three Program Models for Language-Minority Students: A Critical Examination of Reported Findings.” Bilingual Research Journal, vol. 16, no. 1 &amp; 2, 1992, pp. 105-157.&lt;/ref&gt;  The degree to which the children's first language is spoken in the classroom depends on the proficiency level of the students, who generally require more instruction in their mother tongue at earlier ages.  In kindergarten, the average length of instruction in the first language is approximately one hour each day.  The amount of time spent teaching in the first language is greatly reduced in grades 1 and 2.&lt;ref&gt; Jacobson, Rodolfo and Faltis, Christian. Language Distribution Issues in Bilingual Schooling. Clevedon, Avon, England; Philadelphia: Multilingual Matters, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;  Students are first instructed in the grammar and composition of the first language, for it is claimed that knowledge of the first language aids the acquisition of knowledge in the second language;&lt;ref&gt; August, Diane; Garcia, Eugene E. Language Minority Education in the United States: Research, Policy and Practice. C. C. Thomas, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; they may also be instructed in the language arts of both first and second languages simultaneously.  Instruction in reading in the second language doesn't typically begin until students meet the standards for reading in their first language.  The students' primary language is used to a lesser extent in the instruction of other subjects.  As students make progress in the second language, it becomes increasingly incorporated into the curriculum, gradually taking the place of the first language.  Cultural knowledge is imparted through classroom activities and materials.

==Late-Exit Transitional Bilingual Education==
The focus of late-exit programs is to ensure understanding of all content areas while maintaining use of the students' native language, allowing a greater transitional period during which students acquire the second language at a slower pace.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  As is the case with early-exit programs, teachers in late-exit programs are required to have native-like proficiency in the second language.  Likewise, both languages are used in the classroom, although a minimum of half of the class time is to be spent using the students' first language.  Unlike early-exit programs, instruction in content areas is primarily conducted in the first language.  Students receive instruction in the language arts of their native tongue before being introduced to those of the target language.  A key difference between early- and late-exit programs is that late-exit programs generally span five to seven years,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; whereas students may be released from early-exit programs in as little as one to two years.  Again, cultural knowledge is transmitted through classroom activities and materials.  It is commonly held by proponents of the late-exit strategy that prolonged instruction in one's native tongue provides the student with a greater understanding of its structure, which through contrastive analysis can be used to gain more information regarding the second language.

==Issues in Transitional Bilingual Education==
In many Transitional Bilingual Education programs, language ideologies can greatly influence children's learning outcomes.  A student's intelligence is often equated with his or her level of proficiency in the second language.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Palmer, Deborah. "The Discourse of Transition: Teachers' Language Ideologies within Transitional Bilingual Educational Programs." International Multilingual Research Journal. Volume 5, Issue 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Teachers with assimilationist ideologies often encourage students to abandon their native language as it is thought to have little value if any.  Instructors may be more inclined to reduce the amount of instruction in the students' native language because they believe that the easiest way to transition to the second language is through consistent use of that language.  Another issue encountered in TBE classrooms is  that instructors seldom provide an environment in which students can produce the target language.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''University of Khartoum''' (shortened to '''UofK''') ({{lang-ar|جامعة الخرطوم}}) is a multi-campus, co-educational, public [[university]] located in [[Khartoum]]. It is the largest and oldest [[university]] in [[Sudan]]. UofK was founded as [[Gordon Memorial College]] in 1902 and established in 1956 when Sudan gained independence. Since that date, the University of Khartoum has been recognized as a top university and a high-ranked academic institution in [[Sudan]] and [[Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Akec, John A. (14 February 2009) [http://www.sudantribune.com/Why-the-university-education-still,30170 Why the university education still excites Sudanese?] The Sudan Tribune, Comment and Analysis, Retrieved 21 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
 
It features several institutes, academic units and research centers including [[Mycetoma Research Center]], [[Soba University Hospital]], [[Saad Abualila Hospital]], [[Dr. Salma Dialysis centre]], [[Institute of Endemic Diseases]], [[Institute for Studies and Promotion of Animal Exports]], [[Institute of African and Asian Studies]], [[Institute of Prof. Abdalla ElTayeb for Arabic Language]], [[Development Studies and Research Institute]] and [[U of K publishing house]]. The [[Sudan Library]], a section of the university's library, serves as the [[national library]] of [[Sudan]].

== History ==
[[File:Khalda Zahir-bw.jpg|thumb|left|[[Khalida Zahir]], graduated as the first Sudanese female doctor in 1952&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unitykhartoum.blogspot.be/2011/07/khalda-zahir-of-almorada-village-ssa.html|title=The Unity High School Archive|author=Unity High School|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In 1898 after [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] gained dominance in Sudan as part of a [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|condominium]] arrangement, [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] proposed founding a college in the memory of [[Charles George Gordon|Gordon of Khartoum]], who was killed in the [[Battle of Khartoum]]. Gordon Memorial College was founded in 1902 with primary education being its sole program.
 
By 1906, the college was offering programs for training assistant engineers, land surveyors and primary school teachers. The first equipped laboratory for [[bacteriological analysis]] was added in 1905, with donations from [[Henry Wellcome|Sir Henry Wellcome]], an American-British pharmaceutical entrepreneur and archaeologist.

In 1924, the college incorporated programs in [[Sharia]], engineering, education (teachers training), clerical work, accounting and science. The [[Kitchener School of Medicine]], the first medical school in Sudan, was established.

In 1936, the School of Law was established. In 1947, the college was affiliated with [[University of London|The University of London]] as the first overseas participant in its "special relationship" scheme.  The first graduates to receive University of London degrees completed their programs in 1950. The next year, Gordon Memorial College was formally renamed University College Khartoum, which incorporated the Kitchener School of Medicine.

When Sudan gained independence in 1956, the new Parliament passed a bill to award university status to Khartoum University College. It officially became Khartoum University on 24 July 1956. The eminent horticultural scientist [[John Pilkington Hudson]] was a visiting professor in 1961-3, who founded its department of horticulture.&lt;ref&gt;ODNB entry: [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/99289 Retrieved 24 July 2011.]{{paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 April 1984, the Government announced the closure of all faculties of the university. The university was reopened fully on August 1.&lt;ref name="Eds.1986"&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Haim Shaked|editor2=Daniel Dishon|title=Middle East Contemporary Survey, Vol. 8, 1983-84|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t32OO3DkDikC&amp;pg=PA646|year=1986|publisher=The Moshe Dayan Center|isbn=978-965-224-006-4|page=646}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university was closed several times after the 1989 military coup d'état for the intensive participation of its students in pro-democracy rallies.

== Student body ==
The university has 16,800 undergraduate students in 23 faculties, schools and graduate research institutes. The annual admission rate is 3,500 students, 55% of whom are female. There are 6,000 [[graduate students]] (graduate diploma, [[M.Sc.]] and [[Ph.D.]]). It has 850 teaching staff (faculty), 20 research fellows and 500 teaching assistants.

== Campuses ==
There are four campuses:
* The Central Campus in Central Khartoum.
* The Medical Campus located in the South of Central Khartoum.
* The Agriculture and Veterinary Campus  at [[Shambat (city)|Shambat]], [[Khartoum North]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uofk.edu/faculties/veterinary/about/about.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041224090405/http://www.uofk.edu/faculties/veterinary/about/about.htm|title=Faculty of Veterinary Medicine - About|archivedate=24 December 2004|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Faculty of Education Campus at [[Omdurman]] 15&amp;nbsp;km from central campus.
* Suba Campus (Faculty of [[Medical Laboratory Science]], Suba Hospital) at Suba,20&amp;nbsp;km South of Khartoum.
* The management studies campus in central Khartoum.

== Admission ==
Undergraduate admission policy is governed by the [[Board of Higher Education of Sudan]], which sets the minimum admission requirement for high school students based on their national origin (Sudanese vs. non-Sudanese) and the high-school certificate board.

For post-graduate studies, the requirements are on the university admission webpage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uofk.edu/admission/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060213015019/http://www.uofk.edu/admission/index.htm |archivedate=2006-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Faculty of Medical Laboratory Sciences was founded in 1966 under the name “School of Medical Laboratory Technicians” as a joint venture between the Faculty of Medicine, University of Khartoum and the Ministry of Health.
Its development was continued until in 1993 an ordinance was passed for the establishment of the College of Medical Laboratory Sciences an independent institution affiliated to the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research.In 1997, it was merged with the University of Khartoum as the Faculty of Medical Laboratory Sciences (FMLS).
The Faculty of Medical Laboratory Sciences offers preparation for careers in medical (clinical) laboratory sciences. A career in medical laboratory sciences is a great way to combine an aptitude for science with the desire to help others. Medical Laboratory Scientists, also known as clinical laboratory scientists, are highly skilled professionals who perform analytical tests on blood, tissue, and body fluids to provide laboratory information for the detection, diagnosis, and treatment of human diseases. There also is a growing trend for medical lab scientists to perform wellness laboratory testing aimed at preventing disease.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3139">A '''water eductor''' or '''water dredge''' is an [[eductor-jet pump]]-based tool used by [[underwater archaeology|underwater archaeologists]] to remove sediments from an underwater archaeological site.  [[airlift (dredging device)|Airlift]]s may be used for the same purpose.

It consists of a large bore straight tube to which is attached a hose pipe through which clean water is [[pump]]ed.  The [[Bernoulli's principle|Bernoulli effect]] from the flow of pumped water causes suction at the mouth of the dredge.  Water and sediment are sucked from the excavation site and released from the far end of the tube.  The tube can be made of any rigid material such as [[steel]] or [[plastic]].  The diameter of the tube depends on the power available from the pump and whether delicate work is required.

In the hands of a trained archaeologist, the water dredge performs the same function as a wheelbarrow on land.  It is used to carry away sediments, not to dig holes.  The archaeologist dislodges the material using a trowel, brush or by making a fanning motion with the hand to cause a current to dislodge sediment.  The archaeologist can also place overburden material directly into the mouth of the dredge.  As the water dredge will remove particles held in suspension in the water, provided it is used correctly it will improve visibility in the immediate area of the excavation.  Careful use of the water dredge ensures that artifacts can be recorded in [[archaeological context|context]] and [[feature (archaeology)|features]] and [[stratigraphy]] can be studied.

Using a water dredge or airlift, the underwater archaeologist has an advantage over terrestrial counterparts, as the spoil is removed without effort and without needing to be transported across other parts of the archaeological site.

Where there is a possibility of small [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] being missed because of poor visibility, a trap may be used at the outlet so that the lifted sediment can be filtered.

Water eductors are also used by marine treasure hunters to suck sediments for filtering for buried artifacts.  Using the water dredge to directly suck sediments means that archaeological information on context and [[stratigraphy]] is not recorded.

An eductor can also form part of a [[wet scrubber]] system which are designed to remove soluble gases and particulate by inducing a gas flow using high pressure liquid focused into a [[Venturi tube#Venturi tubes|venturi]] throat. Additionally, eductor scrubbers can be used for direct-contact condensation.
