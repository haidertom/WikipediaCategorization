&lt;/ref&gt;
on the basis of the [[Ancient greek#Modern use of Ancient Greek|Neoclassical Greek]] word {{lang|grc|ἄγνωσις}}, ''agnōsis'', "not knowing" (cf. [[Attic Greek]] ἄγνωτος "unknown"&lt;ref&gt;See: [[wikt:ἄγνωτος|Wiktionary entry on ἄγνωτος]].&lt;/ref&gt;), and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]''.&lt;ref name=Palmer&gt;{{cite web |url= http://news-service.stanford.edu/pr/2005/pr-agno-100505.html |title= Conference to explore the social construction of ignorance |accessdate= 2007-08-12|date= 2005-10-04|first= Barbara |last= Palmer|publisher= Stanford News Service |quote= Proctor uses the term "agnotology" – a word coined from agnosis, meaning "not knowing" – to describe a new approach to looking at knowledge through the study of ignorance.| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070724074303/http://news-service.stanford.edu/pr/2005/pr-agno-100505.html| archivedate= 24 July 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, the term also highlights the increasingly common condition where more knowledge of a subject leaves one more uncertain than before.  [[David Dunning]] of Cornell University is another academic who studies the spread of ignorance.  "Dunning warns that the internet is helping propagate ignorance – it is a place where everyone has a chance to be their own expert, he says, which makes them prey for powerful interests wishing to deliberately spread ignorance".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160105-the-man-who-studies-the-spread-of-ignorance |title= The Man Who Studies the Spread of Ignorance|last=Kenyon|first= Georgina|date= |website= |publisher= BBC|access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1999 book ''The Erotic Margin'', Irvin C. Schick referred to ''unknowledge'' "to distinguish it from ignorance, and to denote socially constructed lack of knowledge, that is, a conscious absence of socially pertinent knowledge". As an example, he offered the labeling "terra incognita" in early maps, noting that "The reconstruction of parts of the globe as uncharted territory is ... the ''production of unknowledge'', the transformation of those parts into potential objects of Western political and economic attention. It is the enabling of colonialism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schick |first=Irvin C. |title=The Erotic Margin: Sexuality and Spatiality in Alteritist Discourse |publisher=Verso |location=New York and London |year=1999 |pages=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many causes of culturally induced [[ignorance]]. These include the influence of the [[media (communication)|media]], either through neglect or as a result of deliberate misrepresentation and manipulation. [[Corporation]]s and governmental agencies can contribute to the subject matter studied by agnotology through [[secrecy]] and [[Censorship|suppression]] of information, document destruction, and myriad forms of inherent or avoidable culturopolitical selectivity, inattention, and forgetfulness.&lt;ref name=2005conf/&gt;

Proctor cites as a prime example of the deliberate production of ignorance the [[tobacco industry]]'s [[Tobacco advertising|advertising]] campaign to [[Merchants of Doubt|manufacture doubt]] about the [[cancer]]ous and other [[Health effects of tobacco|health effects]] of [[tobacco use]]. Under the banner of science, the industry produced research about everything except tobacco hazards to exploit public uncertainty.&lt;ref name=Palmer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

At Stanford, we study how ignorance is manufactured. It is an art we call agnotology.)
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Agnotology also focuses on how and why diverse forms of knowledge do ''not'' "come to be", or are ignored or delayed. For example, knowledge about [[plate tectonics]] was [[censorship|censored]] and delayed for at least a decade because some evidence remained [[classified information|classified military information]] related to [[Submarine warfare|undersea warfare]].&lt;ref name=Palmer/&gt;

==History==

===Origins===
The term "agnotology" was first coined in a footnote in Proctor's 1995 book, ''The Cancer Wars: How Politics Shapes What We Know and Don't Know About Cancer'': "Historians and philosophers of science have tended to treat ignorance as an ever-expanding vacuum into which knowledge is sucked – or even, as [[Johannes Kepler]] once put it, as the mother who must die for [[science]] to be born. Ignorance, though, is more complex than this. It has a distinct and changing political geography that is often an excellent indicator of the politics of knowledge. We need a political agnotology to complement our political epistemologies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Proctor |first=Robert |title=The Cancer Wars: How Politics Shapes What We Know and Don't Know About Cancer |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |year=1995 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proctor was quoted using the term to describe his research "only half jokingly", as "agnotology" in a 2001 interview about his [[lapidary]] work with the colorful rock [[agate]]. He connected the two seemingly unrelated topics by noting the lack of [[geology|geologic]] knowledge and study of agate since its first known description by [[Theophrastus]] in 300 BC, relative to the extensive research on other rocks and minerals such as [[diamond]]s, [[asbestos]], [[granite]], and [[coal]], all of which have much higher commercial value. He said agate was a "victim of scientific disinterest", the same "structured apathy" he called "the social construction of ignorance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rps.psu.edu/0109/agateer.html |title=The Agateer |accessdate=2007-08-12 |work=Research Penn State|first=Nancy Marie |last=Brown|date=September 2001| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070811131237/http://www.rps.psu.edu/0109/agateer.html| archivedate= 11 August 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was later quoted as calling it "agnotology, the study of ignorance", in a 2003 ''[[The New York Times]]'' story on medical historians testifying as [[expert witness]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/14/arts/14HIST.html?ex=1371009600&amp;en=e10e0387e68ab30f&amp;ei=5007 |title=History for Hire in Industry Lawsuits|date=2003-06-14 |accessdate=2014-07-15 |author =Cohen, Patricia |work=[[The New York Times]]|quote=Mr. Proctor, who describes his specialty as "agnotology, the study of ignorance", argues that the tobacco industry has tried to give the impression that the hazards of cigarette smoking are still an open question even when the scientific evidence is indisputable. "The tobacco industry is famous for having seen itself as a manufacturer of two different products," he said, "tobacco and doubt".}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proctor co-organized a pair of events with [[Londa Schiebinger]], his wife, who is also a science history professor: the first was a workshop at the [[Pennsylvania State University]] in 2003 titled "Agnatology: The Cultural Production of Ignorance",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bshs.org.uk/agnatology-the-cultural-production-of-ignorance |website=The British Society for the History of Science |title=Agnatology: The Cultural Production of Ignorance |accessdate=2014-07-15 |quote=Science, Medicine, and Technology in Culture Pennsylvania University Presents a Workshop: ... Robert N. Proctor and Londa Schiebinger, co-organizers}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later a conference at [[Stanford University]] in 2005 titled "Agnotology: The Cultural Production of Ignorance".&lt;ref name=2005conf&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stanford.edu/dept/HPST/AgnotologyConference.html |title= Agnotology: The Cultural Production of Ignorance|accessdate=2007-08-12 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political economy===

In 2004, [[Londa Schiebinger]]&lt;ref name="news-service.stanford.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2004/october13/londa-1013.html |title=IRWG director hopes to create 'go to' center for gender studies |accessdate=2007-08-12 |date=2004-10-13 |work=Stanford News Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;
gave a more precise definition of agnotology in a paper on 18th-century voyages of scientific discovery and gender relations, and contrasted it with [[epistemology]], the theory of knowledge, saying that the latter questions how we know while the former questions why we do not know: "Ignorance is often not merely the absence of knowledge but an outcome of cultural and political struggle".&lt;ref name=Schiebinger2004&gt;{{cite journal

 | quote =  I develop a methodological tool that historian of science Robert Proctor has called “agnotology”—the study of {{sic|hide=y|culturally|-}}induced ignorances—that serves as a counterweight to more traditional concerns for epistemology, refocusing questions about "how we know" to include questions about what we do not know, and why not. Ignorance is often not merely the absence of knowledge but an outcome of the cultural and political struggle.

Its use as a critical description of the political economy has been expanded upon by [[Michael Betancourt]] in a 2010 article titled "Immaterial Value and Scarcity in Digital Capitalism"&lt;ref name="Betancourt"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=652 |title=CTheory |accessdate=2010-09-06 |quote="Immaterial Value and Scarcity in Digital Capitalism", CTheory, Theory Beyond the Codes: tbc002, Date Published: 6/10/2010, Arthur and Marilouise Kroker, Editors| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101005143051/http://ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=652| archivedate= 5 October 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and expanded in the book ''The Critique of Digital Capitalism''.&lt;ref name="Betancourt2"&gt;{{cite book | last=Betancourt |first=Michael | authorlink = Michael Betancourt | title = [[The Critique of Digital Capitalism]]: An Analysis of the Political Economy of Digital Culture and Technology | publisher = [[Punctum Books]] | location = Brooklyn | year = 2016 | ISBN = 978-0692598443 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His analysis is focused on the housing bubble as well as the bubble economy of the period from 1980 to 2008. Betancourt argues that this political economy should be termed "agnotologic capitalism" because the systemic production and maintenance of ignorance is a major feature that enables the economy to function as it allows the creation of a "bubble economy".&lt;ref name="news-service.stanford.edu"/&gt;

Betancourt's argument is posed in relation to the idea of [[affective labor]]. He states that &lt;blockquote&gt;The creation of systemic unknowns where any potential "fact" is always already countered by an alternative of apparently equal weight and value renders engagement with the conditions of reality – the very situations affective labor seeks to assuage – contentious and a source of confusion, reflected by the inability of participants in bubbles to be aware of the imminent collapse until after it has happened. The biopolitical paradigm of distraction, what [Juan Martin] Prada calls "life to enjoy", can only be maintained if the underlying strictures remain hidden from view. If affective labor works to reduce alienation, agnotology works to eliminate the potential for dissent.&lt;ref name="Betancourt"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In his view, the role of affective labor is to enable the continuation of the agnotologic effects that enable the maintenance of the capitalist status quo.

==Agnoiology==

A similar word from the same Greek roots, ''agnoiology'', meaning "the science or study of ignorance, which determines its quality and conditions"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Agnoiology|volume=1|page=378}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "the doctrine concerning those things of which we are necessarily ignorant"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary |editor= Porter, Noah | publisher= G &amp; C. Merriam Co.| year=1913}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes a branch of philosophy studied by [[James Frederick Ferrier]] in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9002832/James-Frederick-Ferrier |title=James Frederick Ferrier |accessdate=2007-08-12 |format= |work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ainigmology ==
Anthropologist Glenn Stone points out that most of the examples of agnotology (such as work promoting tobacco use) do not actually create a lack of knowledge so much as they create confusion.  A more accurate term for such writing would be "ainigmology", from the root ''ainigma'' (as in "enigma"); in Greek this refers to riddles or to language that obscures the true meaning of a story.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Glenn Davis 2014 Biosecurity in the Age of Genetic Engineering. In '''[http://pages.wustl.edu/files/pages/imce/stone/stone_2014_bioinsecurity.pdf Bioinsecurity and Human Vulnerability]''', ed Nancy Chen and Lesley Sharp, pp. 71-86.  Santa Fe: SAR Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media influence ==

The availability of such large amounts of knowledge in this information age may not necessarily be producing a knowledgeable citizenry. Instead it may be allowing many people to cherry-pick information in blogs or news that reinforces their existing beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
| title=Study: Americans choose media messages that agree with their views

| pages=426–448}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and to be distracted from new knowledge by repetitive or base entertainments. There is conflicting evidence on how television viewing affects intelligence as well as values formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

An emerging new scientific discipline that has connections to agnotology is [[cognitronics]]:
;cognitronics : aims (a) at explicating the distortions in the perception of the world caused by the information society and globalization and (b) at coping with these distortions in different fields. Cognitronics is studying and looking for the ways of improving cognitive mechanisms of processing information and developing emotional sphere of the personality - the ways aiming at compensating three mentioned shifts in the systems of values and, as an indirect consequence, for the ways of developing symbolic information processing skills of the learners, linguistic mechanisms, associative and reasoning abilities, broad mental outlook being important preconditions of successful work practically in every sphere of professional activity in information society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mailing list

'''Albert George Haynesworth III''' (born June 17, 1981) is a former [[American football]] [[defensive tackle]] who played in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) for ten seasons. He played [[college football]] at the [[University of Tennessee]]. Drafted by the [[Tennessee Titans]] in the first round (15th overall) of the [[2002 NFL Draft]], he spent his first seven NFL seasons with the Titans. An All-Pro selection in 2007 and 2008, and considered "the most dominant defensive tackle in the league" at that time,&lt;ref name="TSNranking"&gt;{{cite news|title=Defensive tackle rankings: Nobody dominates like Haynesworth |url=http://aol.sportingnews.com/nfl/story/2009-05-21/defensive-tackle-rankings-nobody-dominates-haynesworth |work=[[The Sporting News]] |date=May 21, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60d0eQRjI?url=http://aol.sportingnews.com/nfl/story/2009-05-21/defensive-tackle-rankings-nobody-dominates-haynesworth |archivedate=August 2, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Haynesworth was a highly coveted [[free agent]] following the [[2008 NFL season|2008 season]].  He signed a seven-year, $100 million contract with the [[Washington Redskins]] in February 2009,&lt;ref name="BattistaNYT"&gt;{{cite news |first=Judy |last=Battista |title=Paying Top Dollar, the Redskins Sign Haynesworth |url=https://archive.nytimes.com/query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage-9A00E0DE1E3AF93BA15751C0A96F9C8B63.html\ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180726104119/https://archive.nytimes.com/query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage-9A00E0DE1E3AF93BA15751C0A96F9C8B63.html|archive-date=July 26, 2018 |work=New York Times |dead-url=yes |date=February 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but played less than two full seasons with Washington. The Redskins' acquisition of Haynesworth has since been widely derided as the worst free agent signing in NFL history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d81fe031a/article/easy-to-come-up-with-worst-freeagency-move-of-last-decade |title=Easy to come up with worst free-agency move of last decade |newspaper=NFL.com |date=May 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/nfl--worst-free-agent-signings-since--93--redskins--redskins-dominate-list-140917033.html |title=Worst free-agent signings since '93: Redskins, Raiders dominate list |newspaper=Yahoo!

==High school career==
Haynesworth was born in [[Hartsville, South Carolina]].  He attended [[Hartsville High School]], and participated in [[high school football|football]], [[Track and field|track]], and [[shot put]].&lt;ref name="HS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oocities.org/colosseum/midfield/4656/99vols.html.tmp |title=The Vol Signing Class of 1999 |publisher=Jumpmaster's Vols Page |accessdate=August 1, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60cjoz0xi?url=http://www.oocities.org/colosseum/midfield/4656/99vols.html.tmp |archivedate=August 1, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Playing under head coach Lewis Lineberger, Haynesworth accounted for 150 tackles, 56 tackles for loss, six sacks, and six fumble recoveries as a junior; he followed that by tallying 110 tackles, 51 quarterback pressures, and six sacks as a senior in 1998.&lt;ref name="HS" /&gt;

Following his senior season, Haynesworth was named a SuperPrep and Rivalnet All-American, and was also rated the fourth-best defensive lineman and the 14th-ranked overall player in the nation according to ESPN's Top 100, while National Recruiting Advisor rated him as the best defensive tackle in the country.&lt;ref name="HS" /&gt; He was a member of the [[Tennessee Volunteers football|University of Tennessee Volunteers]]' 1999 recruiting class.

==College career==
As a student-athlete at the [[University of Tennessee]], Haynesworth was a three-year letterman for the [[Tennessee Volunteers football]] team under head coach [[Phillip Fulmer]].  He lined up at the right defensive tackle position next to [[John Henderson (defensive tackle)|John Henderson]]. He compiled 66 tackles, five sacks, 31 quarterback pressures, 20 tackles for a loss, and nine pass deflections during his collegiate career. He earned ''[[Sporting News]]'' Freshman All-American honors in 1999 and was named Second Team All-Southeastern Conference after his junior season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Five Vols Named to Associated Press All-SEC Teams|url=http://www.utsports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/120401aab.html|publisher=Tennessee Athletics|accessdate=August 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional career==

===2002 NFL Draft===
Considered "potentially a brutal run-stopper" by ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Freeman |first=Mike |date=March 31, 2002 |title=Panthers Could Ignore Talented Passers and Select Peppers Instead |newspaper=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/31/sports/pro-football-inside-nfl-panthers-could-ignore-talented-passers-select-peppers.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Haynesworth was selected by the Tennessee Titans in the first round with the 15th overall pick in the [[2002 NFL Draft]]. He was the fourth defensive tackle selected from a draft class considered to be loaded with talented defensive linemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Bell |first=Jarrett |date=April 18, 2002 |title=Big, agile defensive tackles at a premium for draft |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/nfl/2002draft/2002-04-16-cover.htm |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60d0xTbar?url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/nfl/2002draft/2002-04-16-cover.htm |archivedate=August 2, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At Tennessee's Pro Day in 2002, when he was 20 years old, Haynesworth measured at 6-feet-6 and 317 pounds, ran a 4.82 40-yard dash, and had a 39-inch vertical jump and a 9-foot, 7-inch broad jump.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?document_id=0F2D74DE9A94FDF7 |title=Talent pool looks deep |first=Todd |last=Rosiak |newspaper=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel |date=April 11, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not work out at the 2002 [[NFL Combine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/news/2002/03/02/combine_saturday/ |title=No startling revelations in Combine's first two days |date=March 2, 2002 |last=Pauline |first=Tony |work=Sports Illustrated |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60d15CRt2?url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/news/2002/03/02/combine_saturday/ |archivedate=August 2, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tennessee Titans===
An incident foreshadowing future incidents with Haynesworth occurred at a Titans training camp in 2003, where Haynesworth kicked his former teammate, [[center (football)|center]] [[Justin Hartwig]], in the chest, then had to be restrained by other teammates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Mike |last=Cranston |title=Panthers' Hartwig fired up to face former team, Haynesworth |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/2007-11-03-2157944303_x.htm |work=USA Today |date=November 3, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60d1HEXDV?url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/2007-11-03-2157944303_x.htm |archivedate=August 2, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stomping incident====
On October 1, 2006, in the third quarter of a game against the [[2006 Dallas Cowboys season|Cowboys]], [[running back]] [[Julius Jones (American football player)|Julius Jones]] scored on a rushing play. Center [[Andre Gurode]] fell to the ground, and his helmet was removed by Haynesworth. Haynesworth tried to stomp on Gurode's head, but missed. A second stomp opened a severe wound on Gurode's forehead, narrowly missing his right eye. Referee [[Jerome Boger]] assessed Haynesworth a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty, to which Haynesworth protested by taking off his helmet and throwing it into the turf; Haynesworth was then assessed an additional 15-yard penalty and ejected from the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3490689 |agency=Associated Press |title=Titans, Haynesworth fail to beat franchise deadline |date=July 15, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60d1MpV9l?url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3490689 |archivedate=August 2, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gurode later received 30 stitches just above and below his right eye. After the game, Titans head coach [[Jeff Fisher]] apologized on behalf of the Titans organization to Cowboys coach [[Bill Parcells]]. After the game, Haynesworth apologized,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Haynesworth suspended for unprecedented five games |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2610577 |work=[[ESPN]] |date=October 3, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60d1fapY4?url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2610577 |archivedate=August 2, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; saying "What I did out there was disgusting. It doesn't matter what the league does to me. The way I feel right now, you just can't describe it."  Gurode later said that he would not seek criminal charges against Haynesworth.  He continued to experience headaches and blurred vision as of October 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gurode accepts Haynesworth's apology |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2615573 |work=ESPN |date=October 6, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60cykfH0m?url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2615573 |archivedate=August 2, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Video evidence of the play shows Haynesworth bend down towards Gurode prior to his helmet being off and prior to the stomps. Because the view is partially blocked by other players it is unclear whether Haynesworth manually removes the helmet. Therefore, most media outlets reported simply that Gurode's helmet was off. However, hometown columnist Mickey Spagnola&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dallascowboys.com/news.cfm?editorialAuthor=1&amp;id=0B7E6E03-CB7A-F0CF-054748FE721F0419 DallasCowboys.com – News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061201180429/http://www.dallascowboys.com/news.cfm?editorialAuthor=1&amp;id=0B7E6E03-CB7A-F0CF-054748FE721F0419 |date=2006-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of DallasCowboys.com argued that Haynesworth pulled off Gurode's helmet.

On October 2, 2006, Haynesworth was suspended for five games without pay by the NFL. The suspension was only the second multi-game suspension in NFL history for an on-the-field incident, more than twice as long as the previous longest suspension, given in [[1986 NFL season|1986]] by then-commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]] to [[Green Bay Packers|Green Bay]] nose tackle [[Charles Martin (American football)|Charles Martin]].&lt;ref name="BattistaNYT2006"&gt;{{cite news|first=Judy |last=Battista |title=Titan Player Suspended 5 Games for Kicks to Head |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/03/sports/football/03titans.html |work=New York Times |date=October 3, 2006 |accessdate=February 18, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60cyqGNGP?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/03/sports/football/03titans.html |archivedate=August 2, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Based on his 2006 base salary of $646,251, Haynesworth forfeited more than $190,000.&lt;ref name="BattistaNYT2006" /&gt;  NFL Commissioner [[Roger Goodell]], who had been on the job a month, stated that there was "absolutely no place in the game, or anywhere else" for Haynesworth's behavior.  However, [[ESPN]]{{'}}s [[Mark Schlereth]], a 12-year NFL veteran, felt that Haynesworth should have been suspended for the rest of the season.  ESPN analyst [[Merril Hoge]] harshly criticized the officials for not ejecting Haynesworth immediately after the stomp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Merril |last=Hoge |title=Punishment for Haynesworth not severe enough |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2610631 |work=ESPN |date=October 2, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60d1tN9QL?url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2610631 |archivedate=August 2, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Haynesworth's suspension is the longest for an in-game incident in modern NFL history.

The [[NFL Players Association]] initially planned to appeal the suspension, calling it too severe. However, Haynesworth said on October 3 that he would not appeal, after personally apologizing to Gurode in the same day. In a press conference on October 5, Haynesworth apologized to all who watched the game and said he had entered counseling to control his emotions. He also said that he would work with children in the Nashville area.

Fisher told Parcells after the game that the Titans would punish Haynesworth themselves if they felt the NFL's punishment was not harsh enough. On the same day as Haynesworth's press conference, Fisher told a national radio show that the Cowboys game may have been Haynesworth's last as a Titan.  The team had the option of either deactivating him for the final seven games of the season or releasing him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Titans want Haynesworth to return bonus money |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id%3D2615539 |archive-url=http://www.freezepage.com/1312258260FTDLGQFGNI?url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id%3D2615539 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 2, 2011 |work=ESPN |date=October 7, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Had the Titans released him, they had enough room under the salary cap to absorb the $5.5 million they would owe him for 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Haynesworth may face more punishment from Titans |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id%3D2614453 |archive-url=http://www.freezepage.com/1312258363IQGXZMUAGB?url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id%3D2614453 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 2, 2011 |work=ESPN |date=October 5, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haynesworth was eligible to return on November 19 for the Titans' game against the [[2006 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]].  Even then, there was no guarantee that he would play. Haynesworth's agent, Chad Speck, told several media outlets that Haynesworth fully expected to return to practice on November 13, and he did indeed report that day. He played against the Eagles on November 19, and recorded one tackle.

====2007 season====
On September 9, 2007, in the season opener against the [[2007 Jacksonville Jaguars season|Jacksonville Jaguars]], Haynesworth was called for unnecessary roughness when he slammed running back [[Maurice Jones-Drew]] to the ground after a tackle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Titans' Haynesworth fined $5,000 for hard tackle |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/2007-09-14-691404661_x.htm |archive-url=http://www.freezepage.com/1312258486FUNIYSZIIQ?url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/2007-09-14-691404661_x.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 2, 2011 | work=USA Today | date=September 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was fined $5,000 by the NFL for this incident.  Afterwards, when asked if he would be gentler during play, he commented, "I'm not going to be any gentler or whatever. Maybe I'll just help them up."

Haynesworth was elected to the [[Pro Bowl]] for the [[2008 Pro Bowl|first time]] for the [[2007 NFL season]]. During this season following the stomping incident, he ranked second on the team with six sacks in his 11 games played up to the selection, led or tied for the team-high in total tackles three times that season, and led or tied the team-high in quarterback pressures five times. At the point where the Pro Bowl selection was made, the [[2007 Tennessee Titans season|Titans]] had an 8-3 record in games in which Haynesworth started and were 0–3 in games in which he did not play.

Haynesworth said of his Pro Bowl selection, "It’s an awesome feeling. It’s kind of a load off my back because I didn’t want last year’s suspension to define my career. It was a difficult time in my life, but I was determined to keep working hard to get to this point and earn the respect of my teammates, coaches and fans." Haynesworth failed to sign with Tennessee due to the deadline of signing a franchise tagged player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Teresa M. |last=Walker |title=No deal between Titans, All Pro DT Haynesworth |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/2008-07-15-3338044218_x.htm |work=USA Today |date=July 15, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60d1Cdb1x?url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/2008-07-15-3338044218_x.htm |archivedate=August 2, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Washington Redskins===
An [[unrestricted free agent]] in the 2009 off-season, Haynesworth signed a seven-year, $100 million contract with the [[Washington Redskins]] on the first day of free agency, February 27, 2009.&lt;ref name="ClaytonESPN"&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Clayton |title=Albert Haynesworth, Washington Redskins agree on seven-year deal |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id%3D3939011 |archive-url=http://www.freezepage.com/1312258562XCYKSEXXGS?url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id%3D3939011 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 2, 2011 |work=ESPN |date=February 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was despite being offered more money&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2009/06/25/haynesworth-i-could-have-made-more-money-in-tampa-bay/|title=Haynesworth: I Could Have Made More Money In Tampa Bay|date=2009-06-25|work=ProFootballTalk|access-date=2018-03-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]]. The deal was expected to pay Haynesworth $32 million in the first 13 months,&lt;ref name="BattistaNYT" /&gt; included $41 million guaranteed, and could have reached $115 million if all incentives were met.&lt;ref name="ClaytonESPN" /&gt; Tennessee’s final offer to Haynesworth reportedly amounted to a four-year package worth $34 million total, with about $20 million in guarantees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Terry |last=McCormick |title=How hard did the Titans work to re-sign Haynesworth? |url=http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/sports/commentary-how-hard-did-titans-work-re-sign-haynesworth |archive-url=http://www.freezepage.com/1312258584LBEIQKXQKE?url=http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/sports/commentary-how-hard-did-titans-work-re-sign-haynesworth |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 2, 2011 |work=Nashville City Paper |date=April 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Haynesworth reported on [[SIRIUS]] Blitz that the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] offered him a $120 million deal that could potentially increase by 20%. He says that he took a discount to play with the Redskins because of their large fan base and media outlet, something that he also did not have in Tennessee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.nfl.com/2009/06/25/haynesworth-discusses-free-agency-details-vince-young/ |archive-url=http://www.freezepage.com/1312258771ZVOXPKSPUM?url=http://blogs.nfl.com/2009/06/25/haynesworth-discusses-free-agency-details-vince-young/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 2, 2011 |title=FreezePage |publisher=FreezePage |accessdate=February 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2009, the Titans asked the NFL to consider [[Tampering (Sports)|tampering]] charges against the Redskins, claiming that the Redskins contacted Haynesworth before the [[free agent|free agency]] period began on February 27.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freezepage.com/1312259074YXNDVKQNGD?url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id%3D4035877 Titans Ask NFL to Probe Signing] ESPN, April 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

From the beginning of his time with the Redskins, Haynesworth presented problems for the coaching staff.  He refused to participate in off-season workouts, and arrived at camp in poor physical condition, unable to pass a basic fitness test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/redskinsinsider/albert-haynesworth/albert-haynesworth-fails-to-co.html |work=The Washington Post |title=Albert Haynesworth fails to complete second part of conditioning test |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60d58BBSA?url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/redskinsinsider/albert-haynesworth/albert-haynesworth-fails-to-co.html |archivedate=2011-08-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also made it clear that he did not like to play [[nose tackle]] in the team's 3–4 defensive scheme, having played in a 4–3 scheme in Tennessee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/trainingcamp10/news/story?id=5429787 |title=Albert Haynesworth starts, but unable to finish, conditioning test |work=ESPN |date=August 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After a 45–12 loss to the [[New York Giants]] on ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' in [[2009 NFL season|2009]], Haynesworth questioned the scheme of defensive coordinator [[Greg Blache]], and stated that he could not "survive another season in this system if it stays the way it is."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/12/25/AR2009122501780.html |archive-url=http://www.freezepage.com/1312259245UWHIMSQEEV?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/12/25/AR2009122501780.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 2, 2011 |title=Haynesworth sounds off on Blache, defense after being sent home |newspaper=Washington Post |first=Jason |last=Reid |first2=Dan |last2=Steinberg |lastauthoramp=yes |date=December 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 7, 2010, it was announced that Haynesworth would spend the rest of the season on the restricted list. There had been conflicts throughout the 2010 preseason with Haynesworth and the coaching staff. After a dispute over his absence at a practice in which Haynesworth claimed to be ill, the team suspended him for "conduct detrimental to the club". Head coach [[Mike Shanahan]] said the suspension followed a refusal by Haynesworth to cooperate in a variety of ways and not only because of the practice absence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/12/07/sportsline/main7126500.shtml |archive-url=http://www.freezepage.com/1312259291ZTMEDIDAZS?url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/12/07/sportsline/main7126500.shtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 2, 2011 |title=Redskins suspend Haynesworth 4 games without pay |date=December 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2010 season, Haynesworth had a career-low 13 tackles and just 2.5 sacks in eight games, leading the [[NFL Network]] to name the signing of Haynesworth as the "worst free-agency move of last decade."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d81fe031a/article/easy-to-come-up-with-worst-freeagency-move-of-last-decade|title=Easy to come up with worst free-agency move of last decade|work=NFL.com|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other NFL writers have gone further, calling Haynesworth the worst free agent bust in NFL history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/fanfuel/2012/03/28/nfl_free_agent_busts/ |title=Fan Fuel: Top 10 NFL free agent busts |work=SportsNet |date=March 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1073638-50-biggest-free-agent-signing-busts-in-nfl-history/page/52|title=NFL|author=Dan Van Wie|work=Bleacher Report|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haynesworth created some controversy in March 2015 when he likened [[Ndamukong Suh]]'s six-year, $114 million contract to his previous contract with the Redskins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Albert Haynesworth offers advice to Ndamukong Suh|url = http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000476581/article/albert-haynesworth-offers-advice-to-ndamukong-suh|website = NFL.com|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New England Patriots===
Haynesworth was traded to the [[New England Patriots]] on July 28, 2011, for a fifth-round draft pick in the [[2013 NFL Draft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Farrar|first=Doug|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/blog/shutdown_corner/post/Patriots-trade-for-Haynesworth-Redskins-left-to?urn%3Dnfl-wp4049|archive-url=http://www.freezepage.com/1312259398PQGTSWAQVR?url=http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/blog/shutdown_corner/post/Patriots-trade-for-Haynesworth-Redskins-left-to?urn%3Dnfl-wp4049|dead-url=yes|archive-date=August 2, 2011|title=Patriots trade for Haynesworth; Redskins left to sell cut-rate jerseys|work=Shutdown Corner: A Yahoo!

Two days after being released by the Patriots, Haynesworth was claimed off waivers by the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]].

==Legal issues==
Arrest warrants were issued against Haynesworth in two [[Tennessee]] counties in May 2006 stemming from a traffic incident on [[Interstate 40]]. Both sets of charges were dropped in June 2006. The judge in the [[Putnam County, Tennessee|Putnam County]] case tossed the charges on the grounds that the alleged offense happened out of their jurisdiction. In [[Smith County, Tennessee|Smith County]], the district attorney dismissed the charges. In March 2009, Haynesworth was indicted on two [[misdemeanor]] traffic charges stemming from a December 2008 car accident in Tennessee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id%3D3974042 |archive-url= http://www.freezepage.com/1312259439DCNZUBYRBU?url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id%3D3974042 |dead-url= yes |archive-date= August 2, 2011 |title= Haynesworth Indicted on Traffic Charges |publisher=ESPN | date=March 12, 2009 |accessdate=August 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an accident on [[Interstate 65]], Corey Edmonson was partially paralyzed after colliding with Haynesworth's car. Haynesworth was driving his Ferrari at speeds in excess of 100&amp;nbsp;mph when he struck Edmonson's vehicle, which struck a concrete barrier.&lt;ref name="bleacher"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/397200-albert-haynesworths-lawsuit-is-another-headache-for-washington-redskins |title=Albert Haynesworth's Lawsuit Is Another Headache for Washington Redskins |publisher=Bleacher Report |date=May 26, 2010 |accessdate=August 2, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60d4KMONy?url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/397200-albert-haynesworths-lawsuit-is-another-headache-for-washington-redskins |archivedate=August 2, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 22, 2010, it was reported that Clayton Bank &amp; Trust was suing the NFL lineman, alleging that Haynesworth had failed to make payments on a loan in the amount of more than $2.38 million. The suit was filed in the Knox County Chancery Court on June 18, 2010. According to papers, Haynesworth entered a commercial [[loan agreement]] for the original principal amount of $2,381,688.58 on June 27, 2009. On February 27, 2009, the two parties entered into an Extension Agreement with an effective date of February 27, 2010, according to the suit. The attorney for Clayton Bank &amp; Trust, Hugh B. Ward, Jr., was seeking a little over $2.4 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/redskinsinsider/albert-haynesworth/albert-haynesworth-sued-by-ten.html |work=The Washington Post |title=Albert Haynesworth sued by Tennessee bank |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60d4ZQpaA?url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/redskinsinsider/albert-haynesworth/albert-haynesworth-sued-by-ten.html |archivedate=August 2, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Silvia Mena, a stripper from [[New York City|New York]], claimed in a $10 million lawsuit that Haynesworth impregnated her and left her with no financial assistance.&lt;ref name="bleacher" /&gt;

In 2011, Haynesworth allegedly threw a punch to the nose of Joel Velazques, 38, of [[Leesburg, Virginia]] during a traffic altercation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=6090069 |title=Albert Haynesworth accused in Virginia |date=February 4, 2011 |accessdate=June 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60d4bDxGi?url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=6090069 |archivedate=August 2, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, Haynesworth plead guilty for reckless boating charges.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3876">In [[psychoanalytic theory]], '''aphanisis''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|f|æ|n|ɪ|s|ɪ|s}}; from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἀφάνισις ''aphanisis'', "disappearance") is the disappearance of [[sexual desire]].&lt;ref name="ODP"&gt;{{cite book | title = Oxford Dictionary of Psychology | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-19-860761-X | page = 47}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term was later applied to the disappearance of the [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]].

==Jones==
According to the theories of [[Ernest Jones]], who coined the term in 1927,&lt;ref name="ODP" /&gt; aphanisis is the foundation of all [[neurosis|neuroses]]. Jones suggested that fear of aphanisis was in both sexes more fundamental than [[castration anxiety]], an argument he used against [[Sigmund Freud]] in their debate over [[female sexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Laplanche/J. B. Pontalis, ''The Language of Psychoanalysis'' (2012) p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Jones considered that the [[Oedipus complex]] confronted each sex with the threat of aphanisis, and the choice of giving up "either their sex or their incest".&lt;ref&gt;E. Schuker/N. A. Levinson, ''Female Psychology'' (1991) p. 400&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones subsequently linked aphanisis to Freud's concept of the [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] of separation, a point taken up by [[John Bowlby]] in the context of his own theory of [[Anxiety|separation anxiety]].&lt;ref&gt;John Bowlby, ''Separation'' (2010) pp. 431–2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lacan==
[[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]] adapted Jones's term to a new meaning: "''aphanisis'' is to be situated in a more radical way at the level at which the subject manifests himself in this movement of disappearance...the ''fading'' of the subject".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (1994) pp. 207–8&lt;/ref&gt;

In Lacanian theory, aphanisis describes the process through which a subject is partially eclipsed behind any signifier used to conceive of him/her: "when the subject appears somewhere as meaning, he is manifested elsewhere as 'fading', as disappearance...''aphanisis''".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; The subject as such is, accordingly, barred and riven by the [[Other (philosophy)|Other]] (of language), a subject has no choice but to conceive of themself ''vis-a-vis'' something other than their self, something 'outside' or radically separated from them. 

Because the Other is the sole means through which a 'subject' can be rendered thinkable, aphanisis, the disappearance or the fading of the subject behind any signifier used to conceive of it, is an essential concept for understanding subjectivity and the peril of the subject's fundamental emptiness.

[[Slavoj Žižek|Žižek]] developed the concept of aphanisis in terms of the dialectic of presence and absence—the gap between the core of the personality and the symbolic narrative in which the individual lives.&lt;ref&gt;R/ Maule/J. Beaulieu, ''In the Dark Room'' (2009), p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary examples==
[[Montaigne]] has been seen as a classic example of the exploration of the aphanisis of the subject.&lt;ref&gt;J. Lacan, ''Les quatre concepts fondamnetaux de la psychanalyse'' (Le Séminaire, Livre XI, 1964), Texte établi par J.-A. Miller, Paris, Seuil, coll. Points, 1990, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Apollon/R. Feldstein, ''Lacan, Politics, Aestetics'' (1996) p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[microeconomics]], the '''Bertrand–Edgeworth model''' of price-setting oligopoly looks at what happens when there is a homogeneous product (i.e. consumers want to buy from the cheapest seller) where there is a limit to the output of firms which they are willing and able to sell at a particular price. This differs from the Bertrand competition model where it is assumed that firms are willing and able to meet all demand. The limit to output can be considered as a physical capacity constraint which is the same at all prices (as in [[Francis Ysidro Edgeworth|Edgeworth]]’s work), or to vary with price under other assumptions.

==History==
[[Joseph Louis François Bertrand]] (1822–1900) developed the model of [[Bertrand competition]] in oligopoly.  This approach was based on the assumption that there are at least two firms producing a homogenous product with constant [[marginal cost]] (this could be constant at some positive value, or with zero marginal cost as in Cournot). Consumers buy from the cheapest seller. The Bertrand–[[Nash equilibrium]] of this model is to have all (or at least two) firms setting the price equal to marginal cost.  The argument is simple: if one firm sets a price above marginal cost then another firm can undercut it by a small amount (often called ''epsilon undercutting'', where epsilon represents an arbitrarily small amount) so that the equilibrium is zero (this is sometimes called the [[Bertrand paradox (economics)|Bertrand paradox]]).

The Bertrand approach assumes that firms are willing and able to supply all demand: there is no limit to the amount that they can produce or sell.  [[Francis Ysidro Edgeworth]] considered the case where there is a limit to what firms can sell (a capacity constraint):  he showed that if there is a fixed limit to what firms can sell, then there may exist no [[Pure strategy|pure-strategy]]  [[Nash equilibrium]] (this is sometimes called the [[Edgeworth paradox]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Edgeworth|first=Francis|year=1889|title=The pure theory of monopoly}}, reprinted in {{cite book|title=Collected Papers relating to Political Economy|year=1925|volume=1|publisher=[[Macmillan (publisher)|Macmillan]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Shubik]] developed the Bertrand–Edgeworth model  to allow for the firm to be willing to supply only up to its profit maximizing output at the price which it set (under [[profit maximization]] this occurs when marginal cost equals price).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shubik |first=M. |year=1959 |title=Strategy and Market Structure: Competition, Oligopoly, and the Theory of Games |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |location=New York |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=co8rAAAAIAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He considered the case of strictly convex costs, where marginal cost is increasing in output. [[Martin Shubik|Shubik]] showed that if a Nash equilibrium exists, it must be the [[perfectly competitive]] price (where demand equals supply, and all firms set price equal to marginal cost). However, this can only happen if market demand is infinitely elastic (horizontal) at the competitive price. In general, as in the Edgeworth paradox, no pure-strategy Nash equilibrium will exist. [[Huw Dixon]] showed that in general a [[mixed strategy]] Nash equilibrium will exist when there are [[Convex function|convex]] costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= |last=Dixon |first=H. D. |year=1984 |title=The existence of mixed-strategy equilibria in a price-setting oligopoly with convex costs |journal=[[Economics Letters]] |volume=16 |issue=3–4 |pages=205–12 |doi=10.1016/0165-1765(84)90164-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dixon’s proof used the Existence Theorem of [[Partha Dasgupta]] and [[Eric Maskin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dasgupta |first1=P. |last2=Maskin |first2=E. |year=1986 |title=The Existence of Equilibrium in Discontinuous Economic Games, I: Theory |journal=[[Review of Economic Studies]] |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=1–26 |jstor=2297588 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under Dixon's assumption of (weakly) convex costs, marginal cost will be non-decreasing.  This is consistent with a cost function where marginal cost is flat for a range of outputs, marginal cost is smoothly increasing, or indeed where there is a kink in total cost so that marginal cost makes a discontinuous jump upwards.

==Later developments and related models==
There have been several responses to the non-existence of pure-strategy equilibrium identified by [[Francis Ysidro Edgeworth]] and [[Martin Shubik]].  Whilst the existence of mixed-strategy equilibrium was demonstrated by [[Huw Dixon]], it has not proven easy to characterize what the equilibrium actually looks like.  However, Allen and Hellwig&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allen|first1=B.|last2=Hellwig|first2=M.|year=1986|title=Bertrand–Edgeworth oligopoly in large markets|journal=[[Review of Economic Studies]]|issue=53|pages=175–204}}&lt;/ref&gt; were able to show that in a large market with many firms, the average price set would tend to the competitive price.

It has been argued that non-pure strategies are not plausible in the context of the Bertrand–Edgworth model.  Alternative approaches have included:
*Firms choose the quantity they are willing to sell up to at each price.  This is a game in which price and quantity are chosen: as shown by Allen and Hellwig&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=1818802|title=Price-Setting Firms and the Oligopolistic Foundations of Perfect Competition|first1=Beth|last1=Allen|first2=Martin|last2=Hellwig|publisher=[[American Economic Review]]|volume=76|issue=2|journal=Papers and Proceedings of the Ninety-Eighth Annual Meeting of the American Economic Association |date=May 1986|pages=387–392.}}{{Subscription or libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in a more general case by [[Huw Dixon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://huwdixon.org/publication_archive/articles/ej1992.pdf|first=Huw|last=Dixon|title=The Perfectly competitive outcome as the equilibrium in an Edgeworthian price–quantity game|journal=[[Economic Journal]]|year=1992|issue=102|pages=301–309|accessdate=30 December 2013}}{{Subscription or libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the perfectly competitive price is the unique pure-strategy equilibrium.
*Firms have to meet all demand at the price they set as proposed by Krishnendu Ghosh Dastidar&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dastidar|first=Krishnendu Ghosh|date=January 1995|url=http://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/joecth/v5y1995i1p19-32.html||accessdate=30 December 2013|title=On the Existence of Pure Strategy Bertrand Equilibrium,|journal=[[Journal of Economic Theory]]|publisher=[[Springer (publisher)|Springer]]|volume=5|issue=1|pages=19–32|doi=10.1007/bf01213642}}&lt;/ref&gt; or pay some cost for turning away customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dixon|first=Huw|date=December 1990|title=Bertrand–Edgeworth Equilibria when Firms Avoid Turning Customers Away|journal=Journal of Industrial Economics|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|volume=39|issue=2|pages=131–46|doi=10.2307/2098489}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 December 2013--&gt;{{Subscription or libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst this can ensure the existence of a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium, it comes at the cost of generating multiple equilibria.  However, as shown by [[Huw Dixon]], if the cost of turning customers away is sufficiently small, then any pure-strategy equilibria that exist will be close to the competitive equilibrium.
*Introducing [[product differentiation]], as proposed by Jean-Pascal Benassy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Benassy|first=Jean-Pascal|date=April 1989|url=http://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/restud/v56y1989i2p217-34.html|title=Market Size and Substitutability in Imperfect Competition: A Bertrand–Edgeworth–Chamberlin Model|journal=[[Review of Economic Studies]]|publisher=[[Wiley–Blackwell]]|volume=56|issue=2|pages=217–34|accessdate=30 December 2013|doi=10.2307/2297458}}{{Subscription or libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is more of a synthesis of [[monopolistic competition]] with the Bertrand–Edgeworth model, but Benassy showed that if the [[elasticity of demand]] for the firms output is sufficiently high, then any [[pure strategy]] equilibrium that existed would be close to the competitive outcome.
*"Integer pricing" as explored by [[Huw Dixon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dixon|first=Huw David|date=July 1993|url=http://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/buecrs/v45y1993i3p257-68.html|title=Integer Pricing and Bertrand–Edgeworth Oligopoly with Strictly Convex Costs: Is It Worth More Than a Penny?|journal=[[Bulletin of Economic Research]]|publisher=[[Wiley–Blackwell]]|volume=45|issue=3|pages=257–68|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8586.1993.tb00570.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than treat price as a [[continuous variable]], it is treated as a [[discrete variable]].  This means that firms cannot undercut each other by an arbitrarily small amount, one of the necessary ingredients giving rise to the non-existence of a pure strategy equilibrium. This can give rise to multiple pure-strategy equilibria, some of which may be distant from the competitive equilibrium price. More recently, Prabal Roy Chowdhury&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chowdhury|first=P. R.|url=http://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/indorg/v26y2008i3p746-761.html Bertrand–Edgeworth|title=Equilibrium with a large number of firms|journal=[[International Journal of Industrial Organization]]|volume=26|issue=3|date=May 2008|pages=746–761|accessdate=30 December 2013|doi=10.1016/j.ijindorg.2007.05.009}}{{Subscription or libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt; has combined the notion of discrete pricing with the idea that firms choose prices and the quantities they want to sell at that price as in Allen–Hellwig.
*[[Epsilon equilibrium]] in the pure-strategy game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dixon|first=H.|url=http://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/restud/v54y1987i1p47-62.html|title=Approximate Bertrand Equilibria in a replicated Industry|journal=[[Review of Economic Studies]]|volume=54|year=1987|pages=47–62|accessdate=30 December 2013}}{{Subscription or libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an epsilon equilibrium, each firm is within epsilon of its optimal price.  If the epsilon is small, this might be seen as a plausible equilibrium, due perhaps to [[menu cost]]s or [[bounded rationality]]. For a given epsilon&gt;0, if there are enough firms, then an epsilon-equilibrium exists (this result depends on how one models the residual demand – the demand faced by higher-priced firms given the sales of the lower-priced firms).

A '''command missile''' is a [[missile]], the payload of which issues electronic commands. A command missile does not carry any destructive payload. Its payload is designed to be delivered to very high altitude rather than at ground targets. 

A command missile might function as part of a [[mutually assured destruction]] scenario. In the event of a nuclear first strike being detected, the defending nation launches command missiles, which command retaliation from friendly units. Thus, retaliation is assured even if the nation's leadership, military chain of command, and communications infrastructure are destroyed by the first strike.

The United States operated a command missile system known as the Emergency Rocket Communications System (ERCS). In the event of a nuclear first strike against the continental United States, centrally located [[LGM-30 Minuteman]] missiles would be launched, each of which carried a payload that would electronically trigger a nuclear retaliation.

The Soviet Union was also known to operate command missiles.

'''Conscience''' is a cognitive process that elicits emotion and rational associations based on an individual's [[ethics|moral philosophy]] or value system. Conscience stands in contrast to elicited emotion or thought due to associations based on immediate sensory perceptions and reflexive responses, as in sympathetic CNS responses.  In common terms, conscience is often described as leading to feelings of [[remorse]] when a person commits an act that conflicts with their [[moral value]]s. An individual's moral values and their dissonance with familial, social, cultural and historical interpretations of moral philosophy are considered in the examination of [[cultural relativism|cultural relativity]] in both the practice and study of psychology.  The extent to which conscience informs moral judgment before an action and whether such [[moral judgment]]s are or should be based on [[reason]] has occasioned debate through much of modern history between theories of modern [[western philosophy]] in juxtaposition to the theories of [[romanticism]] and other reactionary movements after the end of the [[Middle Ages]].

Religious views of conscience usually see it as linked to a morality inherent in all humans, to a beneficent universe and/or to [[divinity]]. The diverse ritualistic, mythical, doctrinal, legal, institutional and material features of religion may not necessarily cohere with experiential, emotive, [[spirituality|spiritual]] or [[contemplative]] considerations about the origin and operation of conscience.&lt;ref&gt;Ninian Smart. ''The World's Religions: Old Traditions and Modern Transformations''. Cambridge University Press. 1989. pp. 10–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Common [[secular]] or [[scientific]] views regard the capacity for conscience as probably [[genetics|genetically determined]], with its subject probably learned or [[imprinting (psychology)|imprinted]] as part of a [[culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Winch. ''Moral Integrity''. Basil Blackwell. Oxford. 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

Commonly used metaphors for conscience include the "voice within", the "inner light",&lt;ref name="autogenerated2000"&gt;Rosemary Moore.

Pennsylvania State University Press, University Park, PA. 2000. {{ISBN|978-0-271-01988-8}},&lt;/ref&gt; or even Socrates' reliance on what the Greeks called his "[[Daemon (classical mythology)#Socrates|daimōnic]] sign", an averting (ἀποτρεπτικός ''apotreptikos'') inner voice heard only when he was about to make a mistake.

The Buddha linked conscience with compassion for those who must endure cravings and suffering in the world until right conduct culminates in right mindfulness and right contemplation.]]

In the literary traditions of the [[Upanishads]], [[Brahma Sutras]] and the [[Bhagavad Gita]], conscience is the label given to attributes composing knowledge about good and evil, that a [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] acquires from the completion of acts and consequent accretion of [[karma]] over many lifetimes.&lt;ref&gt;Ninian Smart. ''The World's Religions: Old Traditions and Modern Transformations''. Cambridge University Press. 1989. p. 382&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Adi Shankara]] in his ''[[Vivekachudamani]]'' morally right action (characterised as humbly and compassionately performing the primary duty of good to others without expectation of material or spiritual reward), helps "purify the heart" and provide mental tranquility but it alone does not give us "direct perception of the Reality".&lt;ref&gt;Shankara. ''Crest-Jewel of Discrimination'' (''[[Vivekachudamani|Veka-Chudamani]]'') (trans Prabhavananda S and Isherwood C). Vedanta Press, Hollywood. 1978. pp. 34–36, 136–37.&lt;/ref&gt; This knowledge requires discrimination between the eternal and non-eternal and eventually a realization in [[contemplation]] that the true self merges in a universe of pure consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Shankara.

In the [[Zoroastrian]] faith, after death a soul must face judgment at the ''Bridge of the Separator''; there, [[evil]] people are tormented by prior denial of their own higher nature, or conscience, and "to all time will they be guests for the ''House of the Lie''."&lt;ref&gt;John B Noss. ''Man's Religions''. Macmillan. New York. 1968. p. 477.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[China|Chinese]] concept of [[Ren (Confucianism)|Ren]], indicates that conscience, along with social etiquette and correct relationships, assist humans to follow ''The Way'' ([[Tao]]) a mode of life reflecting the implicit human capacity for goodness and harmony.&lt;ref&gt;AS Cua.

[[File:Bronze Marcus Aurelius Louvre Br45.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Marcus Aurelius]] bronze fragment, Louvre, Paris: "To move from one unselfish action to another with God in mind. Only there, delight and stillness."]]
Conscience also features prominently in [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;Jayne Hoose (ed) ''Conscience in World Religions''. University of Notre Dame Press. 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Pali]] scriptures, for example, [[Buddha]] links the positive aspect of ''conscience'' to a pure heart and a calm, well-directed mind. It is regarded as a spiritual power, and one of the “Guardians of the World”. The Buddha also associated conscience with compassion for those who must endure cravings and suffering in the world until right conduct culminates in right mindfulness and right [[contemplation]].&lt;ref&gt;Ninian Smart. ''The Religious Experience of Mankind''. Fontana. 1971 p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Santideva]] (685–763 CE) wrote in the [[Bodhicaryavatara]] (which he composed and delivered in the great northern Indian Buddhist university of [[Nalanda]]) of the spiritual importance of perfecting virtues such as [[generosity]], [[forbearance]] and training the awareness to be like a "block of wood" when attracted by vices such as [[pride]] or [[lust]]; so one can continue advancing towards right understanding in meditative absorption.&lt;ref&gt;Santideva. ''The Bodhicaryavatara''. trans Crosby K and Skilton A. Oxford University Press, Oxford. 1995. pp. 38, 98&lt;/ref&gt; ''Conscience'' thus manifests in Buddhism as unselfish love for all living beings which gradually intensifies and awakens to a purer awareness&lt;ref&gt;Lama Anagarika Govinda in Jeffery Paine (ed) ''Adventures with the Buddha: A Buddhism Reader''.

The [[Roman Emperor]] [[Marcus Aurelius]] wrote in his ''[[Meditations]]'' that conscience was the human capacity to live by rational principles that were congruent with the true, tranquil and harmonious nature of our mind and thereby that of the Universe: "To move from one unselfish action to another with God in mind. Only there, delight and stillness&amp;nbsp;... the only rewards of our existence here are an unstained character and unselfish acts."&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Aurelius. ''Meditations''. Gregory Hays (trans).

The [[Islamic]] concept of ''[[Taqwa]]'' is closely related to conscience. In the [[Qur’ān]] verses 2:197 &amp; 22:37 Taqwa refers to "right conduct" or "[[piety]]", "guarding of oneself" or "guarding against evil".&lt;ref&gt;Sachiko Murata and William C. Chittick.

Tauris. 2000. {{ISBN|1-86064-022-2}} pp. 282–85&lt;/ref&gt; [[Qur’ān]] verse 47:17 says that God is the ultimate source of the believer's taqwā which is not simply the product of individual will but requires inspiration from God.&lt;ref&gt;Ames Ambros and Stephan Procházka. ''A Concise Dictionary of Koranic Arabic''. Reichert Verlag 2004. {{ISBN|3-89500-400-6}} p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Qur’ān]] verses 91:7–8, God the Almighty talks about how He has perfected the soul, the conscience and has taught it the wrong (fujūr) and right (taqwā). Hence, the awareness of vice and virtue is inherent in the soul, allowing it to be tested fairly in the life of this world and tried, held accountable on the day of judgment for responsibilities to God and all humans.&lt;ref&gt;Azim Nanji. 'Islamic Ethics' in Singer P (ed). ''A Companion to Ethics''. Blackwell, Oxford 1995. p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Qur’ān]] verse 49:13 states: "O humankind! We have created you out of male and female and constituted you into different groups and societies, so that you may come to know each other-the noblest of you, in the sight of God, are the ones possessing taqwā." In [[Islam]], according to eminent theologians such as [[Al-Ghazali]], although events are ordained (and written by God in al-Lawh al-Mahfūz, the ''Preserved Tablet''), humans possess free will to choose between wrong and right, and are thus responsible for their actions; the conscience being a dynamic personal connection to God enhanced by knowledge and practise of the [[Five Pillars of Islam]], deeds of piety, repentance, self-discipline and prayer; and disintegrated and metaphorically covered in blackness through sinful acts.&lt;ref&gt;John B Noss.

In the Protestant Christian tradition, [[Martin Luther]] insisted in the [[Diet of Worms]] that his conscience was captive to the Word of God, and it was neither safe nor right to go against conscience. To Luther, conscience falls within the ethical, rather than the religious, sphere.&lt;ref name=Tillich&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tillich|first1=Paul|title=Morality and Beyond|date=1963|publisher=Harper &amp; Row, Publishers|location=New York|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Calvin]] saw conscience as a battleground: "[...] the enemies who rise up in our conscience against his Kingdom and hinder his decrees prove that God's throne is not firmly established therein".&lt;ref&gt;Calvin, ''Institutes of the Christian religion'', Book 2, chapter 8, quoted in:{{cite book |last= Wogaman |first= J.

''The World's Religions: Old Traditions and Modern Transformations''. Cambridge University Press. 1989. p. 376&lt;/ref&gt; A fundamentalist Christian view of conscience might be: 'God gave us our conscience so we would know when we break His Law; the guilt we feel when we do something wrong tells us that we need to repent.'&lt;ref&gt;Ninian Smart. ''The World's Religions: Old Traditions and Modern Transformations''. Cambridge University Press. 1989. p. 364&lt;/ref&gt; This can sometimes (as with the conflict between [[William Tyndale]] and [[Thomas More]] over the translation of the Bible into English) lead to moral quandaries: "Do I unreservedly obey my Church/priest/military/political leader or do I follow my own inner feeling of right and wrong as instructed by prayer and a personal reading of scripture?"&lt;ref&gt;Brian Moynahan. ''William Tyndale: If God Spare My Life''. Abacus. London. 2003 pp. 249–50&lt;/ref&gt; Some contemporary Christian churches and religious groups hold the moral teachings of the [[Ten Commandments]] or of [[Jesus]] as the highest authority in any situation, regardless of the extent to which it involves responsibilities in law.&lt;ref&gt;Ninian Smart. ''The World's Religions: Old Traditions and Modern Transformations''. Cambridge University Press. 1989. p. 353&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Gospel of John]] (7:53–8:11) (King James Version) Jesus challenges those accusing a woman of adultery stating: "'He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.'

In the [[Gospel of Luke]] (10: 25–37) Jesus tells the story of how a despised and heretical [[Samaritan]] (see [[Parable of the Good Samaritan]]) who (out of compassion and conscience) helps an injured stranger beside a road, qualifies better for eternal life by loving his neighbor, than a priest who passes by on the other side.&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie D, Motyer JA, Stibbs AM, Wiseman DLJ (eds).

This dilemma of obedience in conscience to divine or state law, was demonstrated dramatically in [[Antigone]]'s defiance of [[Creon|King Creon]]'s order against burying her brother an alleged traitor, appealing to the "[[natural law|unwritten law]]" and to a "longer allegiance to the dead than to the living".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Graves.

{{anchor|ConscienceInCatholicTheology}}[[Catholic]] [[theology]] sees conscience as the last practical "judgment of reason which at the appropriate moment enjoins [a person] to do good and to avoid evil".&lt;ref&gt;{{anchor|CCC}}''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' – English translation (U.S., 2nd edition) (English translation of the Catechism of the Catholic Church: Modifications from the Editio Typica, copyright 1997, United States Catholic Conference, Inc. – Libreria Editrice Vaticana) (Glossary and Index Analyticus, copyright 2000, U.S. Catholic Conference, Inc.). {{ISBN|1-57455-110-8}} paragraph 1778&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Second Vatican Council]] (1962–65) describes: "Deep within his conscience man discovers a law which he has not laid upon himself but which he must obey. Its voice, ever calling him to love and to do what is good and to avoid evil, tells him inwardly at the right movement: do this, shun that. For man has in his heart a law inscribed by God. His dignity lies in observing this law, and by it he will be judged. His conscience is man’s most secret core, and his sanctuary. There he is alone with God whose voice echoes in his depths."&lt;ref&gt;Vatican Council II: The Conciliar and Post Conciliar Documents. Collegeville: The Liturgical Press 1992. ''Gaudium and Spes'' 16. Cfr. Joseph Ratzinger, ''On Conscience'', San Francisco: Ignatius Press 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, conscience is not like the will, nor a habit like prudence, but "the interior space in which we can listen to and hear the truth, the good, the voice of God. It is the inner place of our relationship with Him, who speaks to our heart and helps us to discern, to understand the path we ought to take, and once the decision is made, to move forward, to remain faithful"&lt;ref&gt;Pope Francis "Jesus Always Invites Us. He Does Not Impose." Sunday, June 30, 2013 Whispers From The Loggia http://whispersintheloggia.blogspot.com.au/2013/06/jesus-always-invites-us-he-does-not.html (accessed 11 Dec 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of logic, conscience can be viewed as the practical conclusion of a moral syllogism whose major premise is an objective norm and whose minor premise is a particular case or situation to which the norm is applied. Thus, Catholics are taught to carefully educate themselves as to revealed norms and norms derived therefrom, so as to form a correct conscience.  Catholics are also to examine their conscience daily and with special care before [[Confession (religion)|confession]]. Catholic teaching holds that, "Man has the right to act according to his conscience and in freedom so as personally to make moral decisions. He must not be forced to act contrary to his conscience. Nor must he be prevented from acting according to his conscience, especially in religious matters".&lt;ref&gt;''[[#CCC|Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'', paragraph 1782&lt;/ref&gt; This right of conscience does not allow one to arbitrarily disagree with Church teaching and claim that one is acting in accordance with conscience.  A sincere conscience presumes one is diligently seeking moral truth from authentic sources, that is, seeking to conform oneself to that moral truth by listening to the authority established by Christ to teach it. Nevertheless, despite one's best effort, "[i]t can happen that moral conscience remains in ignorance and makes erroneous judgments about acts to be performed or already committed&amp;nbsp;... This ignorance can often be imputed to personal responsibility&amp;nbsp;... In such cases, the person is culpable for the [[evil|wrong]] he commits."&lt;ref&gt;''[[#CCC|Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'', paragraph 1790–91&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, if one realizes one may have made a mistaken judgment, one's conscience is said to be vincibly erroneous and it is not a valid norm for action.  One must first remove the source of error and do one's best to achieve a correct judgment.  If, however, one is not aware of one's error or if, despite an honest and diligent effort one cannot remove the error by study or seeking advice, then one's conscience may be said to be invincibly erroneous.  It binds since one has subjective certainty that one is correct.  The act resulting from acting on the invincibly erroneous conscience is not good in itself, yet this deformed act or material sin against God's right order and the objective norm is not imputed to the person. The formal obedience given to such a judgment of conscience is good. Some Catholics appeal to conscience in order to justify dissent, not on the level of conscience properly understood, but on the level of the principles and norms which are supposed to inform conscience.  For example, some [[priests]] make on the use of the so-called [[internal forum]] solution (which is not sanctioned by the Magisterium) to justify actions or lifestyles incompatible with Church teaching, such as Christ's prohibition of remarriage after divorce or sexual activity outside marriage. The [[Catholic Church]] has warned that "rejection of the Church's authority and her teaching&amp;nbsp;... can be at the source of errors in judgment in [[moral]] conduct".&lt;ref&gt;''[[#CCC|Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'', paragraph 1792&lt;/ref&gt;
An example of someone following his conscience to the point of accepting the consequence of being condemned to death is Sir [[Thomas More]] (1478-1535).&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Willard Crompton, "Thomas More: And His Struggles of Conscience" (Chelsea House Publications, 2006); Marc D. Guerra, 'Thomas More's Correspondence on Conscience', in: ''Religion &amp; Liberty'' 10(2010)6 (https://acton.org/thomas-mores-correspondence-conscience); Prof. Gerald Wegemer, "Integrity and Conscience in the Life and Thought of Thomas More" [21 aug. 2006](http://thomasmoreinstitute.org.uk/papers/integrity-and-conscience-in-the-life-and-thought-of-thomas-more/); http://sacredheartmercy.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/A-Reflection-on-Conscience.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A theologian who wrote on the distinction between the 'sense of duty' and the 'moral sense', as two aspects of conscience, and who saw the former as some feeling that can only be explained by a divine Lawgiver, was [[John Henry Cardinal Newman]].&lt;ref&gt;Cfr. his ''Essay in Aid of a Grammar of Assent'' [1870], p. 105-106; 109vv. (https://archive.org/details/a599830700newmuoft)&lt;/ref&gt; A well known saying of him is that he would first toast on his conscience and only then on the pope, since his conscience brought him to acknowledge the authority of the pope.&lt;ref&gt;Cfr. his ''Letter to the Duke of Norfolk'' (1874), part 5: "Conscience" (http://www.newmanreader.org/works/anglicans/volume2/gladstone/section5.html)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Judaism]] arguably does not require uncompromising obedience to religious authority; the case has been made that throughout [[Jewish history]] [[rabbis]] have circumvented laws they found unconscionable, such as capital punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Harold H Schulweis. ''Conscience: The Duty to Obey and the Duty to Disobey''. Jewish Lights Publishing. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, although an occupation with national destiny has been central to the Jewish faith (see [[Zionism]]) many scholars (including [[Moses Mendelssohn]]) stated that conscience as a personal revelation of scriptural truth was an important adjunct to the [[Talmudic]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Ninian Smart.

[[File:Charles Darwin by Julia Margaret Cameron 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Charles Darwin]] thought that any animal endowed with well-marked social instincts would inevitably acquire a moral sense or conscience, as its intellectual powers approximated man's.]]

The secular approach to conscience includes [[psychology|psychological]], [[physiology|physiological]], [[sociology|sociological]], [[humanitarianism|humanitarian]], and [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] views.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1983"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = May | first1 = L. |  year = 1983 | title = On Conscience | url = | journal = American Philosophical Quarterly | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 57–67 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lawrence Kohlberg]] considered ''critical conscience'' to be an important psychological stage in the proper moral development of humans, associated with the capacity to rationally weigh principles of responsibility, being best encouraged in the very young by linkage with humorous personifications (such as [[Jiminy Cricket]]) and later in adolescents by debates about individually pertinent moral dilemmas.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Kohlberg. "Conscience as principled responsibility: on the philosophy of stage six" in Zecha G and Weingartner P (Eds). ''Conscience: An Interdisciplinary View''. D. Reidel, Dordrecht. 1987 {{ISBN|90-277-2452-0}} pp. 3–15.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erik Erikson]] placed the development of ''conscience'' in the 'pre-schooler' phase of his eight stages of normal human personality development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wurgaft | first1 = LD. |  year = 1976 | title = Erik Erikson: from Luther to Gandhi | url = | journal = Psychoanalytic review | volume = 63 | issue = 2| pages = 209–33 | pmid = 788015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychologist [[Martha Stout]] terms ''conscience'' "an intervening sense of obligation based in our emotional attachments."&lt;ref&gt;Martha Stout. ''The Sociopath Next Door: The Ruthless Versus The Rest of Us''. Broadway Books. {{ISBN|0-7679-1581-X}}. {{ISBN|978-0-7679-1581-6}}. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus a good conscience is associated with feelings of integrity, psychological wholeness and peacefulness and is often described using adjectives such as "quiet", "clear" and "easy".&lt;ref&gt;Childress JF. ''Appeals to Conscience''. Ethics 1979; 89: 315–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sigmund Freud]] regarded ''conscience'' as originating psychologically from the growth of [[civilisation]], which periodically frustrated the external expression of [[aggression]]: this destructive impulse being forced to seek an alternative, healthy outlet, directed its energy as a [[superego]] against the person's own "ego" or selfishness (often taking its cue in this regard from parents during childhood).&lt;ref&gt;Erich Fromm. ''Greatness and Limitations of Freud's Thought''. Jonathan Cape, London. 1980. pp. 126–27.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Freud, the consequence of not obeying our conscience is [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], which can be a factor in the development of [[neurosis]]; Freud claimed that both the cultural and individual super-ego set up strict ideal demands with regard to the moral aspects of certain decisions, disobedience to which provokes a 'fear of conscience'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud. "The Cultural Super-Ego" in P Singer (ed). ''Ethics''. Oxford University Press. NY 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antonio Damasio]] considers conscience an aspect of [[extended consciousness]] beyond survival-related dispositions and incorporating the search for truth and desire to build norms and ideals for behavior.

[[Michel Glautier]] argues that conscience is one of the [[instincts]] and drives which enable people to form societies: groups of humans without these drives or in whom they are insufficient cannot form societies and do not reproduce their kind as successfully as those that do.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Glautier.

[[Charles Darwin]] considered that ''conscience'' evolved in humans to resolve conflicts between competing natural impulses-some about self-preservation but others about safety of a family or community; the claim of conscience to [[moral authority]] emerged from the "greater duration of impression of social instincts" in the struggle for survival.&lt;ref&gt;Compare

&lt;/ref&gt; In such a view, behavior destructive to a person's [[society]] (either to its structures or to the persons it comprises) is bad or "evil".&lt;ref&gt;Milton Wessel. ''Science and Conscience''. Columbia University Press, New York 1980&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, conscience can be viewed as an outcome of those biological drives that prompt humans to avoid provoking [[fear]] or [[contempt]] in others; being experienced as [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] and [[shame]] in differing ways from society to society and person to person.&lt;ref&gt;D'Arcy, Eric. ''Conscience and Its Right to Freedom''. Sheed and Ward, New York 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; A requirement of conscience in this view is the capacity to see ourselves from the point of view of another person.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Fogelman. ''Conscience &amp; courage: rescuers of Jews during the Holocaust''. New York: Anchor Books, c1994&lt;/ref&gt; Persons unable to do this ([[psychopathy|psychopaths]], [[Psychopathy#Psychopathy vs. sociopathy|sociopaths]], [[narcissistic personality disorder|narcissists]]) therefore often act in ways which are "evil".&lt;ref&gt;George Kateb. ''Hannah Arendt: politics, conscience, evil''. Martin Robertson, Oxford. 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fundamental in this view of conscience is that humans consider some "other" as being ''in a social relationship''. Thus, [[nationalism]] is invoked in conscience to quell [[tribal]] conflict and the notion of a Brotherhood of Man is invoked to quell [[war|national conflicts]]. Yet such crowd drives may not only overwhelm but redefine individual ''conscience''. [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] stated: "communal solidarity is annihilated by the highest and strongest drives that, when they break out passionately, whip the individual far past the average low level of the 'herd-conscience.'&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Nietzsche "The Origins of Herd Morality" in P Singer (ed). ''Ethics''. Oxford University Press. NY 1994&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeremy Bentham]] noted that: "[[fanaticism]] never sleeps&amp;nbsp;... it is never stopped by ''conscience''; for it has pressed ''conscience'' into its service."&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Bentham. ''Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation''. (Burns JH and Hart HLA eds), Athlone Press. London. 1970 Ch 12 p. 156n.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hannah Arendt]] in her study of the trial of [[Adolf Eichmann]] in Jerusalem, notes that the accused, as with almost all his fellow Germans, had lost track of his ''conscience'' to the point where they hardly remembered it; this wasn't caused by familiarity with atrocities or by psychologically redirecting any resultant natural pity to themselves for having to bear such an unpleasant duty, so much as by the fact that anyone whose ''conscience'' did develop doubts could see no one who shared them: "Eichmann did not need to close his ears to the voice of conscience&amp;nbsp;... not because he had none, but because his conscience spoke with a "respectable voice", with the voice of the respectable society around him".&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt. ''Eichmann in Jerusalem''. Penguin Books, New York. 1994 {{ISBN|0-14-018765-0}}. pp. 95, 103, 106, 116, 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sir Arthur Keith]] in 1948 developed the [[Amity-enmity complex]]. We evolved as tribal groups surrounded by enemies; thus conscience evolved a dual role; the duty to save and protect members of the [[in-group]], and the duty to show hatred and aggression towards any [[Ingroups and outgroups|out-group]].

An interesting area of research in this context concerns the similarities between our relationships and those of [[animal]]s, whether animals in human society ([[pets]], [[working animal]]s, even animals grown for food) or in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous. {{cite web

====Evolutionary biology ====
Contemporary scientists in [[evolutionary biology]] seek to explain conscience as a function of the [[brain]] that evolved to facilitate [[altruism]] within societies.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Greenfield. ''The Quest For Identity in the 21st Century''. Sceptre. London. 2008 p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''[[The God Delusion]]'', [[Richard Dawkins]] states that he agrees with [[Robert Hinde]]'s ''Why Good is Good'', [[Michael Shermer]]'s ''The Science of Good and Evil'', [[Robert Buckman]]'s ''Can We Be Good Without God?'' and [[Marc Hauser]]'s ''Moral Minds'', that our sense of right and wrong can be derived from our [[Darwinian]] past. He subsequently reinforced this idea through the lense of the [[gene-centered view of evolution]], since the unit of natural selection is neither an individual organism nor a group, but rather [[The Selfish Gene|the "selfish" gene]], and these genes could ensure their own "selfish" survival by, ''inter alia'', pushing individuals to act altruistically towards its kin.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Dawkins. ''The God Delusion''. Bantam Press. London 2006 p. 215-216.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Neuroscience and artificial conscience====

'Acquired sociopathy': the development of sociopathic behavior following focal brain damage. Prog. Exp. Pers. Psychopathol. Res. 1994; 285–311.&lt;/ref&gt; When the damage occurs to adults, they may still be able to perform moral reasoning; but when it occurs to children, they may never develop that ability.&lt;ref&gt;Greene, J.

Attempts have been made by neuroscientists to locate the [[free will]] necessary for what is termed the 'veto' of conscience over unconscious mental processes (see [[Neuroscience of free will]] and [[Benjamin Libet]]) in a scientifically measurable awareness of an intention to carry out an act occurring 350–400 microseconds after the electrical discharge known as the 'readiness potential.'&lt;ref&gt;Libet B, Freeman A and Sutherland K (eds).

The word "conscience" derives etymologically from the Latin ''conscientia'', meaning "privity of knowledge"&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', second edition, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;
or "with-knowledge". The [[English language|English]] word implies internal awareness of a moral standard in the mind concerning the quality of one's motives, as well as a consciousness of our own actions.&lt;ref&gt;Little, W, Fowler HW, Coulson J, Onions CT. ''The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary On Historical Principles''. 3rd ed. Vol 1 Clarendon Pres. Oxford. 1992. pp. 402–03.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus ''conscience'' considered philosophically may be first, and perhaps most commonly, a largely unexamined "gut feeling" or "vague sense of guilt" about what ought to be or should have been done. Conscience in this sense is not necessarily the product of a process of rational consideration of the moral features of a situation (or the applicable [[normative]] principles, rules or laws) and can arise from parental, peer group, religious, state or corporate [[indoctrination]], which may or may not be presently consciously acceptable to the person ("traditional conscience").&lt;ref&gt;Peter Singer. ''Practical Ethics''. 2nd ed. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. 1993 pp. 292–95.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Conscience'' may be defined as the [[practical reason]] employed when applying moral convictions to a situation ("critical conscience").&lt;ref&gt;Peter Singer. ''Democracy and Disobedience''. Clarendon Press.

The medieval [[Islamic]] scholar and mystic [[Al-Ghazali]] divided the concept of ''[[Nafs]]'' ([[Soul (spirit)|soul]] or [[self (spirituality)]]) into three categories&lt;ref name="autogenerated1966"/&gt; based on the [[Qur’an]]:

#Nafs Ammarah (12:53) which "exhorts one to freely indulge in gratifying passions and instigates to do evil"
#Nafs Lawammah (75:2) which is "the conscience that directs man towards right or wrong"
#Nafs Mutmainnah (89:27) which is "a self that reaches the ultimate peace"

The medieval Persian philosopher and physician [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi]] believed in a close relationship between ''conscience'' or spiritual integrity and physical health; rather than being self-indulgent, man should pursue knowledge, use his intellect and apply justice in his life.&lt;ref&gt;A.J. Arberry (transl.). ''The spiritual Physik of Rhazes'' (London, John Murray 1950).&lt;/ref&gt; The medieval Islamic philosopher [[Avicenna]], whilst imprisoned in the castle of Fardajan near [[Hamadhan]], wrote his famous isolated-but-awake "Floating Man" [[sensory deprivation]] [[thought experiment]] to explore the ideas of human [[self-awareness]] and the substantiality of the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]; his hypothesis being that it is through [[intelligence]], particularly the [[active intellect]], that God communicates [[truth]] to the human [[mind]] or conscience.&lt;ref name="autogenerated67"/&gt; According to the Islamic [[Sufis]] conscience allows [[Allah]] to guide people to the [[marifa]], the peace or "light upon light" experienced where a Muslim's prayers lead to a melting away of the self in the inner knowledge of God; this foreshadowing the eternal Paradise depicted in the [[Qur’ān]].&lt;ref&gt;Ninian Smart. ''The Religious Experience of Mankind''. Collins. New York. 1969. pp. 511–12&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jan Van Ruysbroeck.jpg|thumb|upright|The Flemish mystic [[Jan van Ruysbroek (scholar)|Jan van Ruysbroeck]] viewed a pure conscience as facilitating "an outflowing losing of oneself in the abyss of that eternal object which is the highest and chief blessedness"]]

Some medieval Christian [[scholasticism|scholastics]] such as [[Bonaventure]] made a distinction between conscience as a rational faculty of the mind ([[practical reason]]) and inner awareness, an intuitive "spark" to do good, called ''[[synderesis]]'' arising from a remnant appreciation of absolute good and when consciously denied (for example to perform an evil act), becoming a source of inner torment.&lt;ref name="Langston34"/&gt; Early modern theologians such as [[William Perkins (Puritan)|William Perkins]] and [[William Ames]] developed a syllogistic understanding of the conscience, where God's law made the first term, the act to be judged the second and the action of the conscience (as a rational faculty) produced the judgement. By debating test cases applying such understanding conscience was trained and refined (i.e. [[casuistry]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ceri Sullivan. ''The Rhetoric of the Conscience in Donne, Herbert, and Vaughan''.

[[File:Avicenna.jpg|left|thumb|upright|The medieval Persian philosopher [[Ibn Sina]] ([[Avicenna]]) developed a sensory deprivation thought experiment to explore the relationship between conscience and God]]

In the 13th century, [[Aquinas|St. Thomas Aquinas]] regarded ''conscience'' as the application of moral knowledge to a particular case (S.T. I, q. 79, a. 13).  Thus, conscience was considered an act or judgment of practical reason that began with [[synderesis]], the structured development of our innate remnant awareness of absolute good (which he categorised as involving the five primary precepts proposed in his theory of [[Natural Law]]) into an acquired habit of applying moral principles.&lt;ref name="autogenerated145"/&gt; According to Singer, Aquinas held that conscience, or ''conscientia'' was an imperfect process of judgment applied to activity because knowledge of the [[natural law]] (and all acts of natural virtue implicit therein) was obscured in most people by education and custom that promoted selfishness rather than fellow-feeling (''Summa Theologiae'', I–II, I).&lt;ref name="Thomas Aquinas pp. 247-249"&gt;Thomas Aquinas. "Of the Natural Law" in P Singer (ed). ''Ethics''. Oxford University Press. NY 1994 pp. 247–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas also discussed conscience in relation to the virtue of [[prudence]] to explain why some people appear to be less "morally enlightened" than others, their weak will being incapable of adequately balancing their own needs with those of others.&lt;ref&gt;Saarinen, R. ''Weakness of the Will in Medieval Thought From Augustine to Buridan''. Brill, Leiden. 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Aquinas reasoned that acting contrary to conscience is an [[evil]] action but an errant conscience is only blameworthy if it is the result of culpable or [[vincible ignorance]] of factors that one has a duty to have knowledge of.&lt;ref name="Thomas Aquinas pp. 247-249"/&gt; Aquinas also argued that conscience should be educated to act towards real goods (from [[God]]) which encouraged [[human flourishing]], rather than the apparent goods of sensory pleasures.&lt;ref name="Thomas Aquinas pp. 247-249"/&gt; In his ''Commentary'' on [[Aristotle]]'s [[Nicomachean Ethics]] Aquinas claimed it was weak will that allowed a non-virtuous man to choose a principle allowing pleasure ahead of one requiring moral constraint.&lt;ref&gt;Brain Davies. ''The Thought of Thomas Aquinas''. Clarendon Press. Oxford. 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas A Kempis]] in the medieval [[contemplative]] classic ''[[The Imitation of Christ]]'' (ca 1418) stated that the glory of a good man is the witness of a good conscience. "Preserve a quiet conscience and you will always have joy. A quiet conscience can endure much, and remains joyful in all trouble, but an evil conscience is always fearful and uneasy."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A Kempis. "The Imitation of Christ". Leo Sherley-Price (trans) Penguin Books. London. 1965 Bk II, ch. 6 ''On The Joys of a Good Conscience''. p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; The anonymous medieval author of the Christian [[mystical]] work [[The Cloud of Unknowing]] similarly expressed the view that in profound and prolonged [[contemplation]] a soul dries up the "root and ground" of the [[sin]] that is always there, even after one's [[Confession (religion)|confession]] and however busy one is in [[holy]] things: "therefore, whoever would work at becoming a [[contemplative]] must first cleanse his [or her] conscience."&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous. ''The Cloud of Unknowing''. Clifton Wolters (trans.) Penguin Books. London 1965 ch. 28 p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; The medieval Flemish mystic [[John of Ruysbroeck]] likewise held that true conscience has four aspects that are necessary to render a man just in the active and contemplative life: "a free spirit, attracting itself through love"; "an intellect enlightened by grace", "a delight yielding propension or inclination" and "an outflowing losing of oneself in the abyss of&amp;nbsp;... that eternal object which is the highest and chief blessedness&amp;nbsp;... those lofty amongst men, are absorbed in it, and immersed in a certain boundless thing."&lt;ref&gt;John of Ruysbroeck. ''The Kingdom of the Lovers of God''. Kegan Paul. London. 1919. ch. III pp. 14–15 and ch XLIII p. 214&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Immanuel Kant]]: the moral law within us has true infinity.]]
&lt;/div&gt;

[[Baruch Spinoza|Benedict de Spinoza]] in his [[Ethics (Spinoza)|''Ethics'']], published after his death in 1677, argued that most people, even those that consider themselves to exercise [[free will]], make moral decisions on the basis of imperfect sensory information, inadequate understanding of their mind and will, as well as emotions which are both outcomes of their contingent physical existence and forms of thought defective from being chiefly impelled by self-preservation.&lt;ref&gt;Spinoza. ''Ethics''. Everyman's Library JM Dent, London. 1948. Part 2 proposition 35. Part 3 proposition 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The solution, according to Spinoza, was to gradually increase the capacity of our reason to change the forms of thought produced by emotions and to fall in love with viewing problems requiring moral decision from the perspective of eternity.&lt;ref&gt;Spinoza. ''Ethics''. Everyman's Library JM Dent, London. 1948. Part 4 proposition 59, Part 5 proposition 30&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, living a life of peaceful conscience means to Spinoza that reason is used to generate adequate ideas where the mind increasingly sees the world and its conflicts, our desires and passions ''sub specie aeternitatis'', that is without reference to time.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Scruton. "Spinoza" in Raphael F and Monk R (eds). ''The Great Philosophers''. Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson. London. 2000. p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hegel]]'s obscure and [[mystical]] [[Philosophy of Mind]] held that the absolute right of ''freedom of conscience'' facilitates human understanding of an all-embracing unity, an absolute which was rational, real and true.&lt;ref&gt;Richard L Gregory. ''The Oxford Companion to the Mind''. Oxford University Press. Oxford. 1987 p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Hegel thought that a functioning State would always be tempted not to recognize conscience in its form of subjective knowledge, just as similar non-objective opinions are generally rejected in science.&lt;ref&gt;Georg Hegel. ''Philosophy of Right''. Knox TM trans, Clarendon Press, Oxford. 1942. para 137.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar idealist notion was expressed in the writings of [[Joseph Butler]] who argued that conscience is [[God]]-given, should always be obeyed, is intuitive, and should be considered the "constitutional monarch" and the "universal moral faculty": "conscience does not only offer itself to show us the way we should walk in, but it likewise carries its own authority with it."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Butler "Sermons" in ''The Works of Joseph Butler''. (Gladstone WE ed), Clarendon Press, Oxford. 1896, Vol II p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Butler advanced ethical speculation by referring to a duality of regulative principles in human nature: first,"self-love" (seeking individual happiness) and second, "benevolence" (compassion and seeking good for another) in ''conscience'' (also linked to the [[agape]] of [[situational ethics]]).&lt;ref name="autogenerated365"/&gt; Conscience tended to be more authoritative in questions of moral judgment, thought Butler, because it was more likely to be clear and certain (whereas calculations of self-interest tended to probable and changing conclusions).&lt;ref&gt;Henry Sidgwick. ''Outlines of the History of Ethics''. Macmillan, London. 1960 pp. 196–97.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Selden]] in his ''Table Talk'' expressed the view that an awake but excessively scrupulous or ill-trained ''conscience'' could hinder resolve and practical action; it being "like a horse that is not well wayed, he starts at every bird that flies out of the hedge".&lt;ref&gt;John Selden. ''Table Talk''. Garnett R, Valee L and Brandl A (eds) The Book of Literature: A Comprehensive Anthology. The Grolier Society. Toronto. 1923. Vol 14. p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the sacred texts of ancient [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist]] philosophy became available in German translations in the 18th and 19th centuries, they influenced philosophers such as [[Schopenhauer]] to hold that in a healthy mind only deeds oppress our ''conscience'', not wishes and thoughts; "for it is only our deeds that hold us up to the mirror of our will"; the ''good conscience'', thought Schopenhauer, we experience after every disinterested deed arises from direct recognition of our own inner being in the phenomenon of another, it affords us the verification "that our true self exists not only in our own person, this particular manifestation, but in everything that lives. By this the heart feels itself enlarged, as by egotism it is contracted."&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer. ''The World as Will and Idea''. Vol 1. Routledge and Kegan Paul. London. 1948. pp. 387, 482. "I believe that the influence of the Sanskrit literature will penetrate not less deeply than did the revival of Greek literature in the 15th century." p xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Immanuel Kant]], a central figure of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], likewise claimed that two things filled his mind with ever new and increasing admiration and awe, the oftener and more steadily they were reflected on: "the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me&amp;nbsp;... the latter begins from my invisible self, my personality, and exhibits me in a world which has true infinity but which I recognise myself as existing in a universal and necessary (and not only, as in the first case, contingent) connection."&lt;ref&gt;Kant I. "The Noble Descent of Duty" in P Singer (ed). ''Ethics''. Oxford University Press. NY 1994 p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; The 'universal connection' referred to here is Kant's [[categorical imperative]]: "act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law."&lt;ref&gt;Kant I. "The Categorical Imperative" in P Singer (ed). ''Ethics''. Oxford University Press. NY 1994 p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt; Kant considered ''critical conscience'' to be an internal court in which our thoughts accuse or excuse one another; he acknowledged that morally mature people do often describe contentment or peace in the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] after following conscience to perform a duty, but argued that for such acts to produce virtue their primary motivation should simply be duty, not expectation of any such bliss.&lt;ref&gt;Kant I. "The Doctrine of Virtue" in ''Metaphyics and Morals''. Cambridge University Press. Cambridge. 1991. pp. 183 and 233–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Rousseau expressed a similar view that conscience somehow connected man to a greater [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] unity. [[John Plamenatz]] in his critical examination of [[Rousseau]]'s work considered that ''conscience'' was there defined as the feeling that urges us, in spite of contrary passions, towards two harmonies: the one within our minds and between our passions, and the other within society and between its members; "the weakest can appeal to it in the strongest, and the appeal, though often unsuccessful, is always disturbing. However, corrupted by power or wealth we may be, either as possessors of them or as victims, there is something in us serving to remind us that this corruption is against nature."&lt;ref&gt;John Plamenatz. ''Man and Society''. Vol 1. Longmans. London. 1963 p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other philosophers expressed a more sceptical and pragmatic view of the operation of "conscience" in society.&lt;ref&gt;Hill T Jr "Four Conceptions of Conscience" in Shapiro I and Adams R. ''Integrity and Conscience''. New York University Press, New York 1998 p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[John Locke]] in his ''Essays on the Law of Nature'' argued that the widespread fact of human conscience allowed a philosopher to infer the necessary existence of objective moral laws that occasionally might contradict those of the state.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Woolhouse]]. ''Locke: A Biography''. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. 2007. p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Locke highlighted the [[metaethics]] problem of whether accepting a statement like "follow your ''conscience''" supports [[subject (philosophy)|subjectivist]] or [[objectivity (philosophy)|objectivist]] conceptions of conscience as a guide in concrete morality, or as a spontaneous revelation of eternal and immutable principles to the individual: "if conscience be a proof of innate principles, contraries may be innate principles; since some men with the same bent of conscience prosecute what others avoid."&lt;ref&gt;John Locke. ''An Essay Concerning Human Understanding''. Dover Publications. New York. 1959. {{ISBN|0-486-20530-4}}. Vol 1. ch II. pp. 71-72fn1.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Hobbes]] likewise pragmatically noted that opinions formed on the basis of ''conscience'' with full and honest conviction, nevertheless should always be accepted with humility as potentially erroneous and not necessarily indicating absolute knowledge or truth.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hobbes. ''Leviathan'' (Molesworth W ed) J Bohn. London, 1837 Pt 2. Ch 29 p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Godwin]] expressed the view that ''conscience'' was a memorable consequence of the "perception by men of every creed when the descend into the scene of busy life" that they possess [[free will]].&lt;ref&gt;William Godwin. ''Enquiry Concerning Political Justice''. Codell Carter K (ed), Clarendon Press. Oxford. 1971 Appendix III 'Thoughts on Man' Essay XI 'Of Self Love and Benevolence' p. 338.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam Smith]] considered that it was only by developing a ''critical conscience'' that we can ever see what relates to ourselves in its proper shape and dimensions; or that we can ever make any proper comparison between our own interests and those of other people.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Smith. ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments''. Part III, section ii, Ch III in Rogers K (ed) Self Interest: An Anthology of Philosophical Perspectives. Routledge. London. 1997 p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Stuart Mill]] believed that idealism about the role of ''conscience'' in government should be tempered with a practical realisation that few men in society are capable of directing their minds or purposes towards distant or unobvious interests, of disinterested regard for others, and especially for what comes after them, for the idea of posterity, of their country, or of humanity, whether grounded on sympathy or on a conscientious feeling.&lt;ref name="Mill193-194"&gt;John Stuart Mill. "Considerations on Representative Government". Ch VI. In Rogers K (ed) ''Self Interest: An Anthology of Philosophical Perspectives''. Routledge. London. 1997 pp. 193–94&lt;/ref&gt; Mill held that certain amount of ''conscience'', and of disinterested public spirit, may fairly be calculated on in the citizens of any community ripe for [[representative government]], but that "it would be ridiculous to expect such a degree of it, combined with such intellectual discernment, as would be proof against any plausible fallacy tending to make that which was for their class interest appear the dictate of justice and of the general good."&lt;ref name="Mill193-194"/&gt;

[[Josiah Royce]] (1855–1916) built on the [[transcendental idealism]] view of conscience, viewing it as the ideal of life which constitutes our moral personality, our plan of being ourself, of making common sense ethical decisions. But, he thought, this was only true insofar as our ''conscience'' also required loyalty to "a mysterious higher or deeper self."&lt;ref&gt;John K Roth (ed). ''The Philosophy of Josiah Royce''. Thomas Y Crowell Co. New York. 1971 pp. 302–15.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the modern Christian tradition this approach achieved expression with [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]] who stated during his imprisonment by the [[Nazis]] in [[World War II]] that ''conscience'' for him was more than practical reason, indeed it came from a "depth which lies beyond a man's own will and his own reason and it makes itself heard as the call of human existence to unity with itself."&lt;ref&gt;Dietrich Bonhoeffer. ''Ethics''. (Eberhard Bethge (ed) Neville Horton Smith (trans) Collins. London 1963 p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; For Bonhoeffer a ''guilty conscience'' arose as an indictment of the loss of this unity and as a warning against the loss of one's self; primarily, he thought, it is directed not towards a particular kind of doing but towards a particular mode of being. It protests against a doing which imperils the unity of this being with itself.&lt;ref name="autogenerated24"/&gt; ''Conscience'' for Bonhoeffer did not, like shame, embrace or pass judgment on the morality of the whole of its owner's life; it reacted only to certain definite actions: "it recalls what is long past and represents this disunion as something which is already accomplished and irreparable".&lt;ref name="Bonhoffer66"&gt;Dietrich Bonhoeffer. ''Ethics''. (Eberhard Bethge (ed) Neville Horton Smith (trans) Collins. London 1963 p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; The man with a ''conscience'', he believed, fights a lonely battle against the "overwhelming forces of inescapable situations" which demand moral decisions despite the likelihood of adverse consequences.&lt;ref name="Bonhoffer66"/&gt;[[Simon Soloveychik]] has similarly claimed that the ''truth'' distributed in the world, as the statement about human [[dignity]], as the affirmation of the line between [[good and evil|good]] and [[evil]], lives in people as conscience.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Soloveychik]].

As [[Hannah Arendt]] pointed out, however, (following the utilitarian [[John Stuart Mill]] on this point): a bad conscience does not necessarily signify a bad character; in fact only those who affirm a commitment to applying moral standards will be troubled with remorse, guilt or shame by a bad ''conscience'' and their need to regain integrity and wholeness of the self.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt. ''Crises of the Republic''. Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich. New York. 1972 p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Stuart Mill. "Utilitarianism" and "On Liberty" in ''Collected Works''. University of Toronto Press. Toronto. 1969 Vols 10 and 18. Ch 3. pp. 228–29 and 263.&lt;/ref&gt; Representing our soul or true self by analogy as our house, Arendt wrote that "conscience is the anticipation of the fellow who awaits you if and when you come home."&lt;ref name="autogenerated191"&gt;Hannah Arendt. ''The Life of the Mind''. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, New York. 1978. p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; Arendt believed that people who are unfamiliar with the process of silent critical reflection about what they say and do will not mind contradicting themselves by an immoral act or crime, since they can "count on its being forgotten the next moment;" bad people are not full of regrets.&lt;ref name="autogenerated191"/&gt; Arendt also wrote eloquently on the problem of languages distinguishing the word [[consciousness]] from ''conscience''. One reason, she held, was that ''conscience'', as we understand it in moral or legal matters, is supposedly always present within us, just like ''consciousness'': "and this conscience is also supposed to tell us what to do and what to repent; before it became the ''lumen naturale'' or [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s practical reason, it was the voice of God."&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt. ''The Life of the Mind''. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, New York. 1978. p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Albert Einstein Head Cleaned N Cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Albert Einstein]] associated conscience with suprapersonal thoughts, feelings and aspirations.]]
[[Albert Einstein]], as a self-professed adherent of [[humanism]] and [[rationalism]], likewise viewed an enlightened religious person as one whose ''conscience'' reflects that he "has, to the best of his ability, liberated himself from the fetters of his selfish desires and is preoccupied with thoughts, feelings and aspirations to which he clings because of their super-personal value."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Einstein|first=A.|year=1940|title=Science and religion |journal= [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=146 |pages=605–07|doi=10.1038/146605a0 |issue=3706 |bibcode=1940Natur.146..605E}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Einstein often referred to the "inner voice" as a source of both moral and physical knowledge: "[[Quantum mechanics]] is very impressive. But an inner voice tells me that it is not the real thing. The theory produces a good deal but hardly brings one closer to the secrets of the Old One. I am at all events convinced that He does not play dice."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gino Segre. ''Faust in Copenhagen: A Struggle for the Soul of Physics and the Birth of the Nuclear Age''. Pimlico. London 2007. p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Simone Weil]] who fought for the French resistance (the [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis]]) argued in her final book ''[[The Need for Roots]]: Prelude to a Declaration of Duties Towards Mankind'' that for society to become more just and protective of liberty, obligations should take precedence over rights in moral and political philosophy and a spiritual awakening should occur in the ''conscience'' of most citizens, so that social obligations are viewed as fundamentally having a transcendent origin and a beneficent impact on human character when fulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;Simone Weil. ''The Need For Roots: Prelude to a Declaration of Duties Towards Mankind''. Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul. London. 1952 (repr 2003). {{ISBN|0-415-27101-0}} pp. 13 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hellman, John. ''Simone Weil: An Introduction to Her Thought''. Wilfrid Laurier, University Press, Waterloo, Ontario. 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Simone Weil]] also in that work provided a psychological explanation for the mental peace associated with a ''good conscience'': "the liberty of men of goodwill, though limited in the sphere of action, is complete in that of conscience. For, having incorporated the rules into their own being, the prohibited possibilities no longer present themselves to the mind, and have not to be rejected."&lt;ref&gt;Simone Weil. ''The Need For Roots: Prelude to a Declaration of Duties Towards Mankind''. Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul. London. 1952 (repr 2003). {{ISBN|0-415-27101-0}} p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatives to such [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] and [[idealism|idealist]] opinions about conscience arose from [[philosophical realism|realist]] and [[materialism|materialist]] perspectives such as those of [[Charles Darwin]]. Darwin suggested that "any [[animal]] whatever, endowed with well-marked social instincts, the parental and filial affections being here included, would inevitably acquire a moral sense or conscience, as soon as its intellectual powers had become as well, or as nearly as well developed, as in man."&lt;ref&gt;Charles Darwin. "The Origin of the Moral Sense" in P Singer (ed). ''Ethics''. Oxford University Press. NY 1994 p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Émile Durkheim]] held that the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] and conscience were particular forms of an impersonal principle diffused in the relevant group and communicated by [[totemic]] ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;Émile Durkheim. ''The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life''. The Free Press. New York. 1965 p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt; [[AJ Ayer]] was a more recent realist who held that the existence of ''conscience'' was an empirical question to be answered by sociological research into the moral habits of a given person or group of people, and what causes them to have precisely those habits and feelings. Such an inquiry, he believed, fell wholly within the scope of the existing [[social sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;AJ Ayer. "Ethics for Logical Positivists" in P Singer (ed). ''Ethics''. Oxford University Press. NY 1994 p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Edward Moore]] bridged the idealistic and sociological views of 'critical' and 'traditional' conscience in stating that the idea of abstract 'rightness' and the various degrees of the specific emotion excited by it are what constitute, for many persons, the specifically 'moral sentiment' or ''conscience''. For others, however, an action seems to be properly termed 'internally right', merely because they have previously regarded it as right, the idea of 'rightness' being present in some way to his or her mind, but not necessarily among his or her deliberately constructed motives.&lt;ref&gt;GE Moore. ''Principia Ethica''. Cambridge University Press. London. 1968 pp. 178–79.&lt;/ref&gt;

The French philosopher [[Simone de Beauvoir]] in ''A Very Easy Death'' (''Une mort très douce'', 1964) reflects within her own ''conscience'' about her mother's attempts to develop such a moral sympathy and understanding of others.&lt;ref&gt;Simone de Beauvoir.

As for discovering an attitude that would not have set us apart, nothing in her life had ever prepared her for such a thing: the unexpected sent her into a panic, because she had been taught never to think, act or feel except in a ready-made framework."

[[Michael Walzer]] claimed that the growth of religious toleration in Western nations arose amongst other things, from the general recognition that private conscience signified some inner divine presence regardless of the religious faith professed and from the general respectability, piety, self-limitation, and sectarian discipline which marked most of the men who claimed the rights of conscience.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Walzer. ''Obligations: Essays on Disobedience, War and Citizenship''. Clarion-Simon and Schuster. New York. 1970. p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Walzer also argued that attempts by courts to define conscience as a merely personal moral code or as sincere belief, risked encouraging an anarchy of moral egotisms, unless such a code and motive was necessarily tempered with shared moral knowledge: derived either from the connection of the individual to a universal spiritual order, or from the common principles and mutual engagements of unselfish people.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Walzer. ''Obligations: Essays on Disobedience, War and Citizenship''. Clarion-Simon and Schuster. New York. 1970. p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ronald Dworkin]] maintains that constitutional protection of [[freedom of conscience]] is central to democracy but creates personal duties to live up to it: "Freedom of conscience presupposes a personal responsibility of reflection, and it loses much of its meaning when that responsibility is ignored. A good life need not be an especially reflective one; most of the best lives are just lived rather than studied. But there are moments that cry out for self-assertion, when a passive bowing to fate or a mechanical decision out of deference or convenience is treachery, because it forfeits dignity for ease."&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Dworkin. ''Life's Dominion''. Harper Collins, London 1995. pp. 239–40&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Conze]] stated it is important for individual and collective moral growth that we recognise the illusion of our conscience being wholly located in our body; indeed both our conscience and wisdom expand when we act in an unselfish way and conversely "repressed compassion results in an unconscious sense of guilt."&lt;ref&gt;Edward Conze.

[[File:John Ralston Saul.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[John Ralston Saul]]: consumers risk turning over their conscience to technical experts and to the ideology of free markets]]

[[John Ralston Saul]] expressed the view in ''The Unconscious Civilization'' that in contemporary developed nations many people have acquiesced in turning over their sense of right and wrong, their ''critical conscience'', to technical experts; willingly restricting their moral freedom of choice to limited consumer actions ruled by the ideology of the free market, while citizen participation in public affairs is limited to the isolated act of voting and private-interest lobbying turns even elected representatives against the public interest.&lt;ref&gt;John Ralston Saul. ''The Unconscious Civilisation''. Massey Lectures Series. Anansi Pres, Toronto. 1995. {{ISBN|0-88784-586-X}} pp. 17, 81 and 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue on religious or philosophical grounds that it is blameworthy to act against ''conscience'', even if the judgement of ''conscience'' is likely to be erroneous (say because it is inadequately informed about the facts, or prevailing moral (humanist or religious), professional ethical, legal and human rights norms).&lt;ref&gt;Alan Donagan. ''The Theory of Morality''. University of Chicago Press, Chicago. 1977. pp. 131–38.&lt;/ref&gt; Failure to acknowledge and accept that conscientious judgements can be seriously mistaken, may only promote situations where one's conscience is manipulated by others to provide unwarranted justifications for non-virtuous and selfish acts; indeed, insofar as it is appealed to as glorifying ideological content, and an associated extreme level of devotion, without adequate constraint of external, altruistic, normative justification, '''conscience''' may be considered morally blind and dangerous both to the individual concerned and humanity as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Beauchamp TL and Childress JF. ''Principles of Biomedical Ethics''. 4th ed. Oxford University Press, New York. 1994 pp. 478–79.&lt;/ref&gt; Langston argues that philosophers of [[virtue ethics]] have unnecessarily neglected ''conscience'' for, once conscience is trained so that the principles and rules it applies are those one would want all others to live by, its practise cultivates and sustains the virtues; indeed, amongst people in what each society considers to be the highest state of moral development there is little disagreement about how to act.&lt;ref name="autogenerated176"/&gt;[[Emmanuel Levinas]] viewed conscience as a revelatory encountering of resistance to our selfish powers, developing morality by calling into question our naive sense of [[freedom of will]] to use such powers arbitrarily, or with [[violence]], this process being more severe the more rigorously the goal of our self was to obtain control.&lt;ref name="Levinas"&gt;Emmanuel Levinas. ''Totality and Infinity: An Essay on Exteriority''. Lingis A (trans) Duquesne University Press, Pittsburgh, PA 1998. pp. 84, 100–01&lt;/ref&gt;
In other words, the welcoming of the ''Other'', to Levinas, was the very essence of ''conscience'' properly conceived; it encouraged our ego to accept the fallibility of assuming things about other people, that selfish [[freedom of will]] "does not have the last word" and that realising this has a transcendent purpose: "I am not alone&amp;nbsp;... in conscience I have an experience that is not commensurate with any a priori [see [[a priori and a posteriori]]] framework-a conceptless experience."&lt;ref name="Levinas"/&gt;

English humanist lawyers in the 16th and 17th centuries interpreted conscience as a collection of universal principles given to man by god at creation to be applied by reason; this gradually reforming the medieval [[Roman law]]-based system with forms of action, written pleadings, use of juries and patterns of litigation such as [[Demurrer]] and [[Assumpsit]] that displayed an increased concern for elements of right and wrong on the actual facts.&lt;ref&gt;Knafla LA.

[[John Rawls]] in his ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' defines a [[conscientious objector]] as an individual prepared to undertake, in public (and often despite widespread condemnation), an action of [[civil disobedience]] to a legal rule justifying it (also in public) by reference to contrary foundational social virtues (such as justice as liberty or fairness) and the principles of morality and law derived from them.&lt;ref name="John Rawls 1971. pp. 368–70"&gt;John Rawls. A Theory of Justice. Oxford University Press. London 1971. pp. 368–70&lt;/ref&gt; Rawls considered civil disobedience should be viewed as an appeal, warning or admonishment (showing general respect and fidelity to the [[rule of law]] by the non-violence and transparency of methods adopted) that a law breaches a community's fundamental virtue of justice.&lt;ref name="John Rawls 1971. pp. 368–70"/&gt; Objections to Rawls' theory include first, its inability to accommodate conscientious objections to the society's basic appreciation of [[justice]] or to emerging moral or ethical principles (such as respect for the rights of the [[natural environment]]) which are not yet part of it and second, the difficulty of predictably and consistently determining that a majority decision is just or unjust.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Singer. ''Democracy and Disobedience''. Clarendon Press. Oxford. 1973. pp. 86–91&lt;/ref&gt; ''Conscientious objection'' (also called conscientious refusal or evasion) to obeying a law, should not arise from unreasoning, naive "traditional conscience", for to do so merely encourages infantile abdication of responsibility to calibrate the law against moral or human rights norms and disrespect for democratic institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Singer. ''Democracy and Disobedience''. Clarendon Press. Oxford. 1973 pp. 94–99.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead it should be based on "critical conscience' – seriously thought out, conceptually mature, personal moral or religious beliefs held to be fundamentally incompatible (that is, not merely inconsistent on the basis of selfish desires, whim or impulse), for example, either with all laws requiring [[conscription]] for military service, or legal compulsion to fight for or financially support the State in a particular war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Spitz | first1 = D. |  year = 1954 | title = Democracy and the problem of 'civil disobedience' | url = | journal = American Political Science Review | volume = 48 | issue = 2| pages = 386–403 | doi = 10.2307/1951202 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A famous example arose when [[Henry David Thoreau]] the author of [[Walden]] was willingly jailed for refusing to pay a tax because he profoundly disagreed with a government policy and was frustrated by the corruption and injustice of the democratic machinery of the [[State (polity)|state]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry David Thoreau.

In the [[Second World War]], [[Great Britain]] granted conscientious-objection status not just to complete [[pacifist]]s, but to those who objected to fighting in that particular war; this was done partly out of genuine respect, but also to avoid the disgraceful and futile persecutions of [[conscientious objectors]] that occurred during the [[First World War]].&lt;ref&gt;Hayes D. ''Challenge of Conscience: The Story of the Conscientious Objectors''. Allen &amp; Unwin. London 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amnesty International]] organises campaigns to protect those arrested and or incarcerated as a [[prisoner of conscience]] because of their conscientious beliefs, particularly concerning intellectual, political and artistic freedom of expression and association.&lt;ref&gt;For example see Jan Brabec, Václav Havel, Ivan Lamper, David Nemec, Petr Placak, Joska Skalnik ''et al.''

In legislation, a [[conscience clause (medical)|conscience clause]] is a provision in a statute that excuses a health professional from complying with the law (for example legalising surgical or pharmaceutical [[abortion]]) if it is incompatible with religious or conscientious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine White.

Expressed justifications for refusing to obey laws because of conscience vary. Many conscientious objectors are so for religious reasons—notably, members of the [[peace churches|historic peace churches]] are pacifist by doctrine. Other objections can stem from a deep sense of responsibility toward humanity as a whole, or from the conviction that even acceptance of work under military orders acknowledges the principle of [[conscription]] that should be everywhere condemned before the world can ever become safe for real [[democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Howard Moore.

''The Life and Mind of John Dewey''. Southern Illinois University Press.

[[Samuel Johnson]] pointed out that an appeal to conscience should not allow the law to bring unjust suffering upon another. ''Conscience'', according to Johnson, was nothing more than a conviction felt by ourselves of something to be done or something to be avoided; in questions of simple unperplexed morality, ''conscience'' is very often a guide that may be trusted.&lt;ref name="Life of Johnson 505"&gt;[[James Boswell]]. ''[[Life of Johnson]]''. Oxford University Press.

[[Civil disobedience]] as [[non-violent protest]] or [[civil resistance]] are also acts of conscience, but are designed by those who undertake them chiefly to change, by appealing to the majority and democratic processes, laws or government policies perceived to be incoherent with fundamental social virtues and principles (such as justice, equality or respect for intrinsic human dignity).&lt;ref&gt;John Rawls.

==World conscience==
{{Further|Comparative religion|Universalism|World government|Cosmopolitanism|Common heritage of humanity}}

World conscience is the [[universalism|universalist]] idea that with ready global communication, all people on [[earth]] will no longer be morally estranged from one another, whether it be culturally, ethnically, or geographically; instead they will conceive ethics from the [[utopian]] point of view of the [[universe]], [[eternity]] or [[infinity]], rather than have their duties and obligations defined by forces arising solely within the restrictive boundaries of 'blood and territory.'&lt;ref name="autogenerated2001"/&gt;

Often this derives from a [[spirituality|spiritual]] or [[natural law]] perspective, that for [[world peace]] to be achieved, ''conscience'', properly understood, should be generally considered as not necessarily linked (often destructively) to [[fundamentalist]] religious ideologies, but as an aspect of [[universal consciousness]], access to which is the [[common heritage of humanity]].&lt;ref&gt;Bede Griffiths. ''A New Vision of Reality: Western Science, Eastern Mysticism and Christian Faith''. Fount. London. 1992. p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt; Thinking predicated on the development of ''world conscience'' is common to members of the [[Global Ecovillage Network]] such as the [[Findhorn Foundation]], international conservation organisations like [[Fauna and Flora International]], as well as performers of [[world music]] such as [[Alan Stivell]].&lt;ref&gt;William Thompson. ''Passages About the Earth: An Exploration of the New Planetary Culture''. Rider and Co. London. 1974. Ch 7. 'To Findhorn and Lindisfarne' pp. 150–83.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Non-government organizations]], particularly through their work in agenda-setting, policy-making and implementation of human rights-related policy, have been referred to as the conscience of the world&lt;ref&gt;P willets 'Introduction' in  P.

[[Edward O Wilson]] has developed the idea of [[consilience]] to encourage coherence of global moral and scientific knowledge supporting the premise that "only unified learning, universally shared, makes accurate foresight and wise choice possible".&lt;ref&gt;Edward O Wilson. ''Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge''. Abacus. London. 2003 {{ISBN|0-349-11112-X}} p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, ''world conscience'' is a concept that overlaps with the [[Gaia hypothesis]] in advocating a balance of moral, legal, scientific and economic solutions to modern transnational problems such as [[global poverty]] and [[climate change]], through strategies such as [[environmental ethics]], [[climate ethics]], [[conservation (ethic)|natural conservation]], [[ecology]], [[cosmopolitanism]], [[sustainability]] and [[sustainable development]], [[biosequestration]] and legal protection of the [[biosphere]] and [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;[[EF Schumacher]].

The [[Green party]] politician [[Bob Brown]] (who was arrested by the [[Tasmanian]] state police for a conscientious act of [[civil disobedience]] during the [[Franklin Dam]] protest) expresses ''world conscience'' in these terms: "the universe, through us, is evolving towards experiencing, understanding and making choices about its future'; one example of policy outcomes from such thinking being a global tax (see [[Tobin tax]]) to alleviate global poverty and protect the biosphere, amounting to 1/10 of 1% placed on the worldwide speculative currency market.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Brown. ''Memo For a Saner World''. Penguin Books. Melbourne. 2004. pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; Such an approach sees ''world conscience'' best expressing itself through political reforms promoting democratically based [[globalisation]] or ''planetary democracy'' (for example [[internet]] voting for global governance organisations (see [[world government]]) based on the model of "one person, one vote, one value") which gradually will replace contemporary market-based globalisation.&lt;ref&gt;James Norman.

A challenge to ''world conscience'' was provided by an influential 1968 article by [[Garrett Hardin]] that critically analyzed the dilemma in which multiple individuals, acting independently after rationally consulting self-interest (and, he claimed, the apparently low 'survival-of-the-fittest' value of ''conscience''-led actions) ultimately destroy a shared limited resource, even though each acknowledges such an outcome is not in anyone's long-term interest.&lt;ref name=hardin68/&gt; Hardin's conclusion that commons areas are practicably achievable only in conditions of low population density (and so their continuance requires state restriction on the freedom to breed), created controversy additionally through his direct deprecation of the role of ''conscience'' in achieving individual decisions, policies and laws that facilitate global justice and peace, as well as [[sustainability]] and [[sustainable development]] of world commons areas, for example including those officially designated such under [[United Nations]] treaties (see [[common heritage of humanity]]).&lt;ref&gt;Axelrod, Robert.

The ancient epic of the Indian subcontinent, the [[Mahabharata]] of [[Vyasa]], contains two pivotal moments of ''conscience''. The first occurs when the warrior [[Arjuna]] being overcome with compassion against killing his opposing relatives in war, receives counsel (see [[Bhagavad-Gita]]) from [[Krishna]] about his spiritual duty ("work as though you are performing a sacrifice for the general good").&lt;ref&gt;Vyasa (Kamala Subramaniam abr.). ''Mahabharata''. Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Bombay. 1989. pp. 430–32&lt;/ref&gt; The second, at the end of the saga, is when king [[Yudhishthira]] having alone survived the moral tests of life, is offered eternal bliss, only to refuse it because a faithful dog is prevented from coming with him by purported divine rules and laws.&lt;ref&gt;Vyasa (Kamala Subramaniam abr.). ''Mahabharata''. Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Bombay. 1989. p. 742.&lt;/ref&gt; The French author [[Montaigne]] (1533–1592) in one of the most celebrated of [[Essays (Montaigne)|his essays]] ("On experience") expressed the benefits of living with a clear conscience: "Our duty is to compose our character, not to compose books, to win not battles and provinces, but order and tranquillity in our conduct. Our great and glorious masterpiece is to live properly".&lt;ref&gt;Michel de Montaigne. ''Essays''. Cohen JM (trans.) Penguin Books. Ringwood. 1984. p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt; In his famous Japanese travel journal ''[[Oku no Hosomichi]]'' (''Narrow Road to the Deep North'') composed of mixed [[haiku]] poetry and prose, [[Matsuo Bashō]] (1644–94) in attempting to describe the eternal in this perishable world is often moved in ''conscience''; for example by a thicket of summer grass being all that remains of the dreams and ambitions of ancient warriors.&lt;ref&gt;Matsuo Bashō. (Yuasa N (trans.) ''Narrow Road to the Deep North''. Penguin Books, Harmondsworth. 1966. p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chaucer]]'s "[[Franklin's Tale]]" in ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' recounts how a young suitor releases a wife from a rash promise because of the respect in his ''conscience'' for the freedom to be truthful, gentle and generous.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Chaucer. ''The Franklin's Prologue and Tale'' (Spearing AC intro.) Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. 1997. p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Eugène Delacroix - Hamlet and Horatio in the Graveyard - WGA6199.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Eugène Delacroix]], ''[[Hamlet]] and Horatio in the Graveyard'' (1839, oil on canvas)]] The critic [[A. C. Bradley]] discusses the central problem of [[Shakespeare]]'s tragic character [[Hamlet]] as one where conscience in the form of moral scruples deters the young Prince with his "great anxiety to do right" from obeying his father's hell-bound ghost and murdering the usurping King ("is't not perfect conscience to quit him with this arm?" (v.ii.67)).&lt;ref&gt;AC Bradley. ''Shakespearean Tragedy: Lectures on Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, Macbeth''. Macmillan and Co. London. 1937. pp. 97–101&lt;/ref&gt;
Bradley develops a theory about Hamlet's moral agony relating to a conflict between "traditional" and "critical" conscience: "The conventional moral ideas of his time, which he shared with the Ghost, told him plainly that he ought to avenge his father; but a deeper conscience in him, which was in advance of his time, contended with these explicit conventional ideas. It is because this deeper conscience remains below the surface that he fails to recognise it, and fancies he is hindered by [[cowardice]] or [[Sloth (deadly sin)|sloth]] or [[passion (emotion)|passion]] or what not; but it emerges into light in that speech to Horatio. And it is just because he has this nobler moral nature in him that we admire and love him".&lt;ref&gt;AC Bradley. ''Shakespearean Tragedy: Lectures on Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, Macbeth''. Macmillan and Co. London. 1937 p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; The opening words of Shakespeare's [[Sonnet 94]] ("They that have pow'r to hurt, and will do none") have been admired as a description of ''conscience''.&lt;ref&gt;Manning Clark. ''A Discovery of Australia: 1976 Boyer Lectures''. Australian Broadcasting Commission, Sydney. 1976. p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; So has [[John Donne]]'s commencement of his poem ''[[:s:Goodfriday, 1613. Riding Westward]]'': "Let man's soul be a sphere, and then, in this, Th' intelligence that moves, devotion is;"&lt;ref&gt;Joan Bennett. ''Five Metaphysical Poets''. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. 1971. p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anton Chekhov]] in his plays ''[[The Seagull]]'', ''[[Uncle Vanya]]'' and ''[[Three Sisters (play)|Three Sisters]]'' describes the tortured emotional states of doctors who at some point in their careers have turned their back on conscience.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Grecco. "A physician healing himself: Chekhov's treatment of doctors in the major plays" in ER Peschel (ed). ''Medicine and Literature'' (1980) pp. 3–10.&lt;/ref&gt; In his short stories, [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]] also explored how people misunderstood the voice of a tortured conscience. A promiscuous student, for example, in ''The Fit'' describes it as a "dull pain, indefinite, vague; it was like anguish and the most acute fear and despair&amp;nbsp;... in his breast, under the heart" and the young doctor examining the misunderstood agony of compassion experienced by the factory owner's daughter in ''From a Case Book'' calls it an "unknown, mysterious power&amp;nbsp;... in fact close at hand and watching him."&lt;ref&gt;Anton Chekhov. ''Selected Stories'' (J Coulson, trans.) Oxford University Press. London. 1963 p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; Characteristically, Chekhov's own conscience drove him on the long journey to [[Sakhalin]] to record and alleviate the harsh conditions of the prisoners at that remote outpost. As Irina Ratushinskaya writes in the introduction to that work: "Abandoning everything, he travelled to the distant island of [[Sakhalin]], the most feared place of exile and forced labour in Russia at that time. One cannot help but wonder why? Simply, because the lot of the people there was a bitter one, because nobody really knew about the lives and deaths of the exiles, because he felt that they stood in greater need of help that anyone else. A strange reason, maybe, but not for a writer who was the epitome of all the best traditions of a Russian man of letters. Russian literature has always focused on questions of '''conscience''' and was, therefore, a powerful force in the moulding of public opinion."&lt;ref&gt;Anton Chekhov. ''The Island: A Journey to Sakhalin'' (L and M Terpak trans) Century. London 1987 p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[E. H. Carr]] writes of [[Dostoevsky]]'s character the young student Raskolnikov in the novel ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'' who decides to murder a 'vile and loathsome' old woman money lender on the principle of transcending conventional morals: "the sequel reveals to us not the pangs of a stricken ''conscience'' (which a less subtle writer would have given us) but the tragic and fruitless struggle of a powerful intellect to maintain a conviction which is incompatible with the essential nature of man."&lt;ref&gt;EH Carr.

Tolkien]] in his epic ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' describes how only the [[hobbit]] [[Frodo]] is pure enough in ''conscience'' to carry the ring of power through war-torn [[Middle-earth]] to destruction in the [[Cracks of Doom]], Frodo determining at the end to journey without weapons, and being saved from failure by his earlier decision to spare the life of the creature [[Gollum]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kocher.

The [[impressionist]] painter [[Vincent van Gogh]] wrote in a letter to his brother Theo in 1878 that "one must never let the fire in one's soul die, for the time will inevitably come when it will be needed. And he who chooses poverty for himself and loves it possesses a great treasure and will hear the voice of his '''conscience''' address him every more clearly. He who hears that voice, which is God's greatest gift, in his innermost being and follows it, finds in it a friend at last, and he is never alone!&amp;nbsp;...

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1768">In [[mathematics]], particularly [[topology]], a '''cosmic space''' is any [[topological space]] that is a [[continuous function|continuous]] [[Image (mathematics)|image]] of some [[Separable space|separable]] [[metric space]]. Equivalently (for [[regular space|regular]] [[T1 space|''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; spaces]] but not in general), a space is cosmic if and only if it has a [[countable]] network; namely a [[countable set|countable]] collection of [[subset]]s of the space such that any [[open set]] is the [[Union (set theory)|union]] of a subcollection of these sets.

Cosmic spaces have several interesting properties. There are a number of unsolved problems about them.

==Examples and properties==

* Any open subset of a cosmic space is cosmic since open subsets of separable spaces are separable.
* Separable metric spaces are trivially cosmic.

==Unsolved problems==

It is unknown as to whether ''X'' is cosmic if:

a) ''X''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; contains no uncountable [[discrete space]];

b) the countable product of ''X'' with itself is hereditarily separable and hereditarily [[Lindelöf space|Lindelöf]].

'''Damping''' is an influence within or upon an [[oscillator|oscillatory system]] that has the effect of reducing, restricting or preventing its oscillations. In physical systems, damping is produced by processes that dissipate the energy stored in the oscillation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The '''damping ratio''' is a [[dimensionless]] measure describing how [[Harmonic oscillator|oscillations in a system]] decay after a disturbance. Many systems exhibit oscillatory behavior when they are disturbed from their position of [[static equilibrium]]. A mass suspended from a spring, for example, might, if pulled and released, bounce up and down. On each bounce, the system tends to return to its equilibrium position, but overshoots it. Sometimes losses (e.g. [[friction]]al) damp the system and can cause the oscillations to gradually decay in amplitude towards zero or [[attenuation|attenuate]]. The damping ratio is a measure describing how rapidly the oscillations decay from one bounce to the next.

The damping ratio is a system parameter, denoted by ζ (zeta), that can vary from '''undamped''' (ζ=0), '''underdamped''' (ζ&lt;1) through '''critically damped''' (ζ=1) to '''overdamped''' (ζ&gt;1).

The behaviour of oscillating systems is often of interest in a diverse range of disciplines that include [[control engineering]], [[chemical engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[structural engineering]], and [[electrical engineering]]. The physical quantity that is oscillating varies greatly, and could be the swaying of a tall building in the wind, or the speed of an [[electric motor]], but a normalised, or non-dimensionalised approach can be convenient in describing common aspects of behavior.

==Oscillation cases==
Depending on the amount of damping present, a system exhibits different oscillatory behaviors.
* Where the spring–mass system is completely lossless, the mass would oscillate indefinitely, with each bounce of equal height to the last. This hypothetical case is called ''undamped''.
* If the system contained high losses, for example if the spring–mass experiment were conducted in a [[viscous]] fluid, the mass could slowly return to its rest position without ever overshooting. This case is called ''overdamped''.
* Commonly, the mass tends to overshoot its starting position, and then return, overshooting again. With each overshoot, some energy in the system is dissipated, and the oscillations die towards zero. This case is called ''underdamped''.
* Between the overdamped and underdamped cases, there exists a certain level of damping at which the system will just fail to overshoot and will not make a single oscillation. This case is called ''critical damping''. The key difference between critical damping and overdamping is that, in critical damping, the system returns to equilibrium in the minimum amount of time.

== Definition ==
[[File:2nd Order Damping Ratios.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|The effect of varying damping ratio on a second-order system.]]

The ''damping ratio'' is a parameter, usually denoted by ζ (zeta),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| title = Introduction to Mechatronics and Measurement Systems 
| last = Alciatore
| first = David G.
| publisher = McGraw Hill

| ISBN = 978-0-07-296305-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; that characterizes the [[frequency response]] of a [[second-order differential equation|second-order ordinary differential equation]]. It is particularly important in the study of [[control theory]]. It is also important in the [[harmonic oscillator]].

The damping ratio provides a mathematical means of expressing the level of damping in a system relative to critical damping. For a damped harmonic oscillator with mass ''m'', damping coefficient ''c'', and spring constant ''k'', it can be defined as the ratio of the damping coefficient in the system's differential equation to the critical damping coefficient:

:&lt;math&gt; \zeta = \frac{c}{c_c},&lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt; \zeta = \frac {\text{actual damping}} {\text{critical damping}},&lt;/math&gt;

where the system's equation of motion is
:&lt;math&gt; m\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + c\frac{dx}{dt} + kx = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

and the corresponding critical damping coefficient is
:&lt;math&gt; c_c = 2 \sqrt{k m} &lt;/math&gt;

or
:&lt;math&gt; c_c =  2 m \sqrt{k/m} = 2m \omega_n &lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt; \omega_n = \sqrt{k/m} &lt;/math&gt; is the natural frequency of the system.

The damping ratio is dimensionless, being the ratio of two coefficients of identical units.

== Derivation ==
Using the [[natural frequency]] of a [[harmonic oscillator]]  &lt;math&gt;\omega_n = \sqrt{k/m}&lt;/math&gt; and the definition of the damping ratio above, we can rewrite this as:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + 2\zeta\omega_n\frac{dx}{dt} + \omega_n^2 x = 0. &lt;/math&gt;

This equation can be solved with the approach.
:&lt;math&gt; x(t) = C e^{s t},\,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''C'' and ''s'' are both [[complex number|complex]] constants, with ''s'' satisfying
:&lt;math&gt; s = -\omega_n \left(\zeta \pm i \sqrt{1 - \zeta^2}\right). &lt;/math&gt;

Two such solutions, for the two values of ''s'' satisfying the equation, can be combined to make the general real solutions, with oscillatory and decaying properties in several regimes:

; Undamped: Is the case where &lt;math&gt;\zeta = 0&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the undamped simple harmonic oscillator, and in that case the solution looks like &lt;math&gt;\exp(i\omega_nt)&lt;/math&gt;, as expected.
; Underdamped: If ''s'' is a pair of complex values, then each complex solution term is a decaying exponential combined with an oscillatory portion that looks like &lt;math&gt;\exp\left(i \omega_n \sqrt{1 - \zeta^2}t\right)&lt;/math&gt;.  This case occurs for &lt;math&gt; \ 0 \le \zeta &lt; 1 &lt;/math&gt;, and is referred to as ''underdamped''.
; Overdamped: If ''s'' is a pair of real values, then the solution is simply a sum of two decaying exponentials with no oscillation. This case occurs for &lt;math&gt; \zeta &gt; 1 &lt;/math&gt;, and is referred to as ''overdamped''.
; Critically damped: The case where &lt;math&gt; \zeta = 1 &lt;/math&gt; is the border between the overdamped and underdamped cases, and is referred to as ''critically damped''. This turns out to be a desirable outcome in many cases where engineering design of a damped oscillator is required (e.g., a door closing mechanism).

== Q factor and decay rate ==
The [[Q factor]], damping ratio ζ, and exponential decay rate α are related such that&lt;ref name=Siebert&gt;{{cite book | title = Circuits, Signals, and Systems | author = William McC. Siebert | publisher = MIT Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\zeta = \frac{1}{2 Q} = { \alpha \over \omega_0 }.
&lt;/math&gt;

When a second-order system has &lt;math&gt;\zeta &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt; (that is, when the system is underdamped), it has two complex [[complex conjugate|conjugate]] poles that each have a [[real part]] of &lt;math&gt;-\alpha&lt;/math&gt;; that is, the decay rate parameter &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; represents the rate of [[exponential decay]] of the oscillations. A lower damping ratio implies a lower decay rate, and so very underdamped systems oscillate for long times.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, a high quality [[tuning fork]], which has a very low damping ratio, has an oscillation that lasts a long time, decaying very slowly after being struck by a hammer.

==Logarithmic decrement==
For underdamped vibrations, the damping ratio is also related to the [[logarithmic decrement]] &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; via the relation
:&lt;math&gt; \zeta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + (\frac{2\pi}{\delta})^2}} \qquad \text{where} \qquad \delta \triangleq \ln\frac{x_1}{x_2}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt; are the vibration amplitudes at two successive peaks of the decaying vibration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11543">'''Decision Model and Notation''' ('''DMN''') is a standard published by the [[Object Management Group]].&lt;ref name="DMNstandard"&gt;OMG standard "Decision Model and Notation (DMN)", [http://www.omg.org/spec/DMN current version]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a standard approach for describing and modeling repeatable decisions within organizations to ensure that decision models are interchangeable across organizations.

The DMN standard provides the industry with a modeling notation for decisions that will support [[decision management]] and [[business rules]]. The notation is designed to be readable by business and IT users alike.  This enables various groups to effectively collaborate in defining a [[decision model]]:
* the business people who manage and monitor the decisions,
* the [[business analyst]]s or [[functional analyst]]s who document the initial decision requirements and specify the detailed decision models and decision logic, 
* the technical [[Software developer|developer]]s responsible for the automation of systems that make the decisions.

The DMN standard can be effectively used standalone but it is also complementary to the [[BPMN]] and [[CMMN]] standards. BPMN defines a special kind of activity, the Business Rule Task, which "provides a mechanism for the process to provide input to a business rule engine and to get the output of calculations that the business rule engine might provide"&lt;ref&gt;OMG standard "BPMN", [http://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/Current current version]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Purchase|first1=Jan|title=Book Review: Process and Decision Modeling in BPMN/DMN|url=http://blog.luxmagi.com/2015/01/book-review-process-and-decision-modeling-in-bpmndmn/|website=Decision Management for Finance Blog|publisher=Lux Magi Ltd|accessdate=19 April 2015|date=January 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that can be used to show where in a BPMN process a decision defined using DMN should be used.

DMN has been made a standard for Business Analysis according to [[BABOK]] v3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=IIBA|title=A Guide to the Business Analysis Body of Knowledge® (BABOK® Guide)|date=April 15, 2015|isbn=978-1927584026|pages=512|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Decision Modeling now standard for Business Analysts|url=http://jtonedm.com/2015/04/28/decision-modeling-now-standard-for-business-analysts/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Elements of the standard ==
The standard includes three main elements
* Decision Requirements Diagrams that show how the elements of decision-making are linked into a dependency network.
* Business context for decisions such as the roles of organizations or the impact on performance metrics.
* A Friendly Enough Expression Language (FEEL) that can be used to evaluate expressions in a decision table and other logic formats.

== Use cases ==
The standard identifies three main use cases for DMN
* Defining manual decision making
* Specifying the requirements for automated decision-making
* Representing a complete, executable model of decision-making

== Benefits ==
Using the DMN standard will improve business analysis and business process management, since
* other popular requirement management techniques such as [[BPMN]] and UML do not handle decision making
* growth of projects using business rule management systems or [[BRMS]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mann|first1=Stephanie|title=Business rules management: Tools, techniques for success|url=http://www.ebizq.net/topics/business_rules_management/features/13351.html|website=ebizq.net, The Insider's Guide to Next-Generation BPM|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which allow faster changes&lt;ref&gt;Discovering the Decisions within Your Business Processes using IBM Blueworks Live, [https://books.google.be/books?id=OhzCAgAAQBAJ Publisher IBM Redbooks, 2014] {{ISBN|0738453579}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship to BPMN ==

DMN has been designed to work with [[BPMN]]. [[Business process model]]s can be simplified by moving process logic into decision services. DMN is a separate domain within the OMG that provides an explicit way to connect to processes in BPMN. Decisions in DMN can be explicitly linked to processes and tasks that use the decisions. DMN expects that the logic of a decision will be deployed as a stateless, side-effect free Decision Service. Such a service can be invoked from a business process and the data in the process can be mapped to the inputs and outputs of the decision service.

== DMN BPMN example ==
As mentioned, [[BPMN]] is a related [[Object Management Group#OMG Standards|OMG Standard]] for process modeling. DMN complements [[BPMN]], providing a separation of concerns between the decision and the process. The example here describes a BPMN process and DMN DRD (Decision Requirements Diagram) for onboarding a bank customer. Several decisions are modeled and these decisions will direct the processes response.

===New bank account process===
In the BPMN process model shown in the figure, a customer makes a request to open a new bank account. The account application provides the account representative with all the information needed to create an account and provide the requested services. This includes the name, address and various forms of identification. In the next steps of the work flow, the 'Know Your Customer' (KYC) services are called. 
In the 'KYC' services, the name and address are validated; followed by a check against the international criminal database (Interpol) and the database of persons that are 'Politically exposed persons ([[Politically exposed person|PEP]])'.  The PEP is a person who is either entrusted with a prominent political position or a close relative thereof. Deposits from persons on the PEP list are potentially corrupt. This is shown as two services on the process model. Anti-money-laundering (AML) regulations require these checks before the customer account is certified. 
[[File:DMN_NewBankAccountProcess_BPMN.jpg|thumbnail|Figure: A process with decisions for creating a new bank customer.]]

The results of these services plus the forms of identification are sent to the Certify New Account decision. This is shown as a 'rule' activity, verify account, on the process diagram. If the new customer passes certification, then the account is classified into onboarding for Business Retail, Retail, Wealth Management and High Value Business. Otherwise the customer application is declined. The Classify New Customer Decision classifies the customer.
If the verify-account process returns a result of 'Manual' then the PEP or the Interpol check returned a close match. The account representative must visually inspect the name and the application to determine if the match is valid and accept or decline the application.

===Certify new account decision===
[[File:DMNCertifyNewA_DRG.jpg|thumbnail|The decision structure logic and data associated with the account verification.]]

An account is certified for opening if the individual's' address is verified, that valid identification is provided, and that the applicant is not on a list of criminals or politically exposed persons. These are shown as sub-decisions below the 'certify new account' decision.The account verification services provides a 100% match of the applicants address.
For identification to be valid, the customer must provide a driver's license, passport or government issued ID.

The checks against PEP and Interpol are 'Fuzzy' matches and return matching score values.  Scores above 85 are considered a 'match' and scores between 65 and 85 would require a 'manual' screening process. People who match either of these lists are rejected by the account application process.  If there is a partial match with a score between 65 and 85, against the Interpol or PEP list then the certification is set to manual and an account representative performs a manual verification of the applicant's data. These rules are reflected in the figure below, which presents the decision table for whether to pass the provided name for the lists checks.
[[File:DMN_pass_excluded_names_table_cropped.png|thumbnail|Business rules for evaluating the score of the PEP and Interpol 'Fuzzy' match.]]

===Client category===
The client's on-boarding process is driven by what category they fall in. The category is decided by the:
* Type of client, business or private 
* The size of the funds on deposit 
* And the estimated net worth 
This decision is shown below:
[[File:DMN_client_category_DRG.jpg|thumbnail|The client category decision.]]
There are 6 business rules that determine the client's category and these are shown in the decision table here:
[[File:DMN_client_category_table.jpg|thumbnail|A DMN decision table with business rules for classifying a customer into a category based on the input data.]]

===Summary example===
In this example, the outcome of the 'Verify Account' decision directed the responses of the new account process. The same is true for the 'Classify Customer' decision. By adding or changing the business rules in the tables, one can easily change the criteria for these decisions and control the process differently.

Modeling is a critical aspect of improving an existing process or business challenge. Modeling is generally done by a team of business analysts, IT personnel, and modeling experts. The expressive modeling capabilities of BPMN allows business analyst to understand the functions of the activities of the process. Now with the addition of DMN, business analysts can construct an understandable model of complex decisions. Combining BPMN and DMN yields a very powerful combination of models that work synergistically to simplify processes.

Here are some providers that support DMN:

The first book was published in 1992 and has "appeared in 18 languages in more than 30 countries and sold two million copies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrm.org/page276 |title=Illustrator Biographies |accessdate=14 October 2008 |publisher=Norman Rockwell Museum |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828055708/http://www.nrm.org./page276 |archivedate=28 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dinotopia: A Land Apart from Time'' and ''Dinotopia: The World Beneath'' both won [[Hugo award]]s for best original artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/?page_id=27 |title=The Hugo Awards: 1993 Hugo Awards |accessdate=20 October 2008 |publisher=World Science Fiction Society }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/?page_id=24 |title=The Hugo Awards: 1996 Hugo Awards |accessdate=20 October 2008 |publisher=World Science Fiction Society }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its original publication, over twenty Dinotopia books have been published by various authors to expand the series. A live-action TV mini-series, a brief live-action TV series, an animated film, and several video games have also been released.

==Background==
Gurney's assignments for ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' required him to work with archaeologists to envision and paint ancient cities that no one alive today has ever seen. This inspired him to imagine his own, so he painted "Waterfall City"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dinotopia.com/art_waterfall_city.html Waterfall City] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325193513/http://www.dinotopia.com/art_waterfall_city.html |date=25 March 2010 }}, dinotopia.com. Retrieved August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and "Dinosaur parade".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dinotopia.com/art_dinosaur_parade.html Dinosaur Parade] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325193504/http://www.dinotopia.com/art_dinosaur_parade.html |date=25 March 2010 }}, dinotopia.com. Retrieved August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; These were originally done as art prints for collectors.&lt;ref name=TimeforKids/&gt; He later decided to create an imaginary island based on these paintings.&lt;ref name=TimeforKids&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timeforkids.com/TFK/kids/news/story/0,28277,1675219,00.html |title=A Talk with James Gurney |accessdate=14 October 2008 |last=Maltby |first=Anna |date=24 October 2007 |work=Time for Kids |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208150140/http://www.timeforkids.com/TFK/kids/news/story/0,28277,1675219,00.html |archivedate=8 December 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than digital tools, Gurney used "[[plein-air]] studies, thumbnail sketches, models photographed in costume and original cardboard or clay [[maquette]]s"&lt;ref name=Murray/&gt; to create 150 oil paintings for his 2007 Dinotopia book.&lt;ref name=Murray&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.azcentral.com/ent/pop/articles/1129dinotopia1129.html?&amp;wired |title=Incredible journey: New book goes back to 'Dinotopia' |accessdate=14 October 2008 |last=Murray |first=Kathleen Wereszynski |date=29 November 2007 |work=The Arizona Republic }}&lt;/ref&gt; He called the series "Dinotopia": a [[portmanteau]] of "dinosaur" and "utopia".&lt;ref name=TimeforKids/&gt;

Many have claimed that some scenes in the film ''[[Star Wars: Episode I&amp;nbsp;– The Phantom Menace]]'' (particularly those in the city of [[Theed]] on [[Naboo]]) unfairly copy images from Gurney's books.&lt;ref name=Echo/&gt; Gurney acknowledges the resemblance but has remained positive about it.&lt;ref name=Echo/&gt; In 1994, director [[George Lucas]] had met with producers to discuss some of the concepts and visuals behind a ''Dinotopia'' movie that was never made.&lt;ref name=Echo&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.echostation.com/interview/gurney.htm |title="Breathe Deep, Seek Peace": Controversial Similarities Between "Dinotopia" and "The Phantom Menace", Including Discussion with the Author, James Gurney |accessdate=14 October 2008 |last=Phillips |first=Loren |date=6 June 1999 |publisher=Echo Station |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927215721/http://www.echostation.com/interview/gurney.htm |archivedate=27 September 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The island==
Upon the hidden island of Dinotopia, humans and dinosaurs live and work together in harmony with one another and with the Earth itself. It is a place of beauty and wonder lost to the rest of the world. The island is surrounded by a storm system and dangerous reefs that prevent safe travel to or from the island. Aside from a highly diverse ecosystem ranging from deserts to mountains to swamps, Dinotopia also has an extensive system of natural and man-made caves.

The dinosaurs, according to their own legends, have inhabited the island for millions of years, having sought shelter in the underground caverns during the climate changes that caused the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|extinction of dinosaurs]] elsewhere on the planet.

The caverns are referred to as the World Beneath, and many dinosaurs go there to die. According to legends, a half-man-half [[ceratopsian]] being named Ogthar climbed down there (where the sun is said to sleep at night) and stole pieces of it (known as "sunstones"), using them to create the empire of Poseidos and populating it with metal dinosaurs. However, the sea grew angry with the artificial city and rose to destroy it. It is implied that this is where the Atlantis myth originated.

[[File:Dinotopian script.svg|thumb|Dinotopia written in the [[Latin alphabet|Roman]] and Dinotopian scripts.]]
The human population consists of shipwrecked travelers called ''Dolphinbacks'' (who are often rescued and brought to shore by ''[[Kentriodon]]'') and the descendants of such arrivals. As such, they often fall into cultural zones based on the societies from whence their ancestors came, creating a cultural landscape across the island that is both unified and incredibly diverse.

Dinosaurs are not the only prehistoric creatures on the island. In the higher regions of the Forbidden Mountains (a Himalaya-like mountain chain), [[woolly mammoth]]s, [[ground sloth]]s, [[chalicothere]]s, [[saber-toothed cat]]s, and other prehistoric mammals can be found. Basal [[synapsid]]s are present as well; at least one ''[[Lystrosaurus]]'' and one ''[[Edaphosaurus]]'' can be found in the city of Pooktook.

[[Pterosaur]]s are also common, especially the ''[[Quetzalcoatlus]] [[skybax]]'', which serve as steeds for the skybax messenger riders.

The seas surrounding the island are completely inhabited by prehistoric life such as [[Plesiosauria|plesiosaurs]] and [[trilobite]]s, as well as an unknown species of dolphin.

The center of the island is made up of a dense rainforest called the "Rainy Basin". This place is where most of the island's large carnivores live, such as ''[[Giganotosaurus]]'', ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'', and ''[[Allosaurus]]''. They are just as sentient as the other dinosaurs on the island but must be kept apart due to their instinctual need to hunt. They have their own language yet it is very deep and guttural and difficult even for other dinosaurs to speak or understand fluently. The Basin is cut off from the rest of the island by a series of retractable bridges. There are caravans that make passages through the basin and are made up by very large sauropod dinosaurs outfitted with heavy suits of armor studded with sharp spikes and carry offerings of meat to appease any carnivores they meet. Often, a dinosaur that senses it will die soon will make a pilgrimage to the basin and die there so that it may be eaten by the carnivores and continue to contribute to the good of the island as a whole. The carnivores are actually very respectful of this and always wait for the dinosaur to pass peacefully, never attacking them while alive. The basin is divided by packs of predators, one ruled by Giganotosaurs, the other ruled by Tyrannosaurs.

The Great Desert is a desert in the east that stretches from Chandara to Pteros. The gorges of the Amu River is where Canyon City is built.

The northern part of Dinotopia has the Backbone Mountains which runs across the eastern and western parts of Dinotopia where it forms the northern border of the Rainy Basin and ending at Crackshell Point. Many large mammalian species reside here. In addition, there is the Northern Plains at its northern coast.

The southern part of Dinotopia has Blackwood Flats, a lowland area where its visitors are targets of biting insects, poisonous snakes, a tiger-striped Allosaurus, and a red-faced Tyrannosaurus.

Both the eastern and western halves of the dinotopian society share responsibility equally and live under a common set of laws known as the [[#Code of Dinotopia|Code of Dinotopia]]. The society is highly communal, lacking a monetary system or even a concrete concept of ownership. Individuals are educated from youth to be compassionate, co-operative, and generally conscious of others' needs. For example, food on the island is provided at no cost, but citizens take only what they need and leave the rest for others. Stealing or other crime is virtually non-existent.

==Main characters==

* '''Arthur Denison''' – An American scientist and the main protagonist of the books. Following the death of his wife Rachel in 1860 he and his son Will left their home Boston on a voyage of discovery, then in 1862 they were both washed up on the island of Dinotopia after being shipwrecked. During their time on the island Arthur wrote a journal detailing his discoveries. At some point both of his journals would end up in America where they would be discovered by James Gurney. Arthur currently lives in Waterfall City where he has a studio overlooking the falls.
* '''Will Denison''' – The son of Arthur Denison and the second main protagonist of the books. He accompanied his father on a two-year voyage of discovery following the death of his mother in 1860, then in 1862 he and Arthur were shipwrecked on Dinotopia. During his time on the island he met and fell in love with local Dinotopian girl, Sylvia Romano and eventually trained to be a Skybax Rider and was partnered with a Skybax named Cirrus. In the Dinotopia novel, The Hand of Dinotopia it is revealed that he and Sylvia are engaged to be married.
* '''Bix''' – A ''[[Protoceratops]]'' multilingual who is an ambassador and the good friend and traveling partner of Arthur Denison, having accompanied him to the World Beneath and Chandara. She first met the Denisons when they were washed up on Dinotopia, she was accidentally injured by Arthur when he thought that she meant to harm Will. She later met them again in Volcaneum when she became their guide, ever since she has become their good friend on their travels. She speaks every language on Dinotopia and is one of the few who speak the language of the Carnosaurs of the Rainy Basin.

In the second book ''The World Beneath'', his first villainous scheme to was escape Dinotopia in a sunstone powered strutter and return with an army to plunder the island, however he was foiled by Arthur. In the fourth book ''Journey to Chandara,'' he stole an invitation that was given to Arthur by the Chandaran emperor Hugo Khan and passed himself off as Arthur. However, when Arthur arrived in Chandara he exposed Crabb and he was punished.
* '''Oriana Nascava''' – A musician who lives in Waterfall City who accompanied Arthur during his return trip to the World Beneath.

After defeating the Air Scorpion he became the first ever Skybax Rider.

==Series overview==
''Dinotopia'' began as an illustrated children's book called ''Dinotopia: A Land Apart from Time''. It was a cross-over success, appealing to both children and adult readers, which led James Gurney to write and illustrate three more books called ''Dinotopia: The World Beneath,'' ''Dinotopia: First Flight'' and ''Dinotopia: Journey to Chandara''. They all deal with the adventures of Arthur and Will Denison to one degree or another. These are considered the main books of the series and establish the fictional world in which the others are set. Gurney keeps abreast with recent paleontological discoveries and has written then-newly discovered dinosaurs into his books, for example, including ''Giganotosaurus'' in ''The World Beneath'' and ''Microraptor'' in ''Journey to Chandara''

A children's flip-up version of the first book was also issued.

The ''Dinotopia Digest'' series consists of sixteen young adult novels penned by several different authors. These books feature other characters who are not specifically involved with the events of the main books, although characters from the main books (particularly the Denisons) have appeared in minor or cameo roles.

Two full-length adult fantasy novels were also issued with Gurney's authority, written by [[Alan Dean Foster]]: ''Dinotopia Lost'' and ''The Hand of Dinotopia''.

Several video games, as well as a TV mini-series, a short-lived TV series, and an animated children's movie, were also produced. These are also set in the ''Dinotopia'' universe, but do not tie in directly with the main series. Most of them take place in the modern world, unlike the books, which are mostly set in the mid-19th century.

==Main books==
The plot of the main ''Dinotopia'' books concerns Arthur Denison and his son, Will, and the various people they meet in their travels in Dinotopia. In the fashion of authors such as [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], the first and fourth books are written as if they were Arthur's [[diary|journal]]s, with Gurney going so far as to explain in the introductions how he happened to come across the old, waterlogged volumes.

===''A Land Apart from Time''===
In ''Dinotopia: A Land Apart from Time'' (1992),&lt;ref name=Dinotopia&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dinotopia.com/index.html |title=Dinotopia |publisher=Dinotopia |accessdate=8 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807202738/http://www.dinotopia.com/index.html |archivedate=7 August 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Denisons are shipwrecked near Dinotopia and, after making it ashore, are found by the people of the Hatchery. The [[Hatchery]] is a place where dinosaurs are born, tended by both dinosaurs and humans. The Denisons then set out to explore the island, hoping to find a means of returning to their old lives.

Arthur and Will undergo a broad journey, circling the island, as they endeavor to learn the customs and culture of their new neighbors. Arthur in particular develops an interest in the scientific accomplishments of the natives, which far exceed that of any human culture. Among the subjects he studies are the flora of the island, the partnership of its inhabitants, and the [[existence]] of a place known as the World Beneath. This World Beneath is an explanation for Dinotopians surviving the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|saurian extinction]]; according to the story, most of the Earth's dinosaurs were destroyed, whilst a few hid in vast underground caverns. These few became the original Dinotopians. No one has entered the World Beneath for centuries, but Arthur intends to do so.

His son Will, on the other hand, has chosen to train as a messenger of the sky; a Skybax rider, who lives in [[symbiosis]] with his mount, the great ''[[Quetzalcoatlus]]'' (nicknamed [[Skybax]]), a species of [[pterosaur]]. Training alongside Will is a girl called Sylvia, with whom Will falls in love. The natives refer to this and any other profound bond as ''Cumspiritik'', which literally means "together-breathing." (Romana Denison of the later Dinotopia film series is said to be Will's daughter.)

Arthur, for his part, travels into the World Beneath, at the same time that Will and Sylvia are learning to fly with the Skybax. When he returns, he is fascinated by the ancient relics found there and is convinced that they may be key in enabling him to leave or explore the island.

Meanwhile, Will and Sylvia learn and master Skybax flight. When at last they have been accepted as Riders, they travel to meet Arthur and his ''[[Protoceratops]]'' guide Bix, but are distracted on the way by a thunderstorm. Luckily, they survive and arrive on time to meet their kin. Will is at the time too young to marry Sylvia, but it is promised that they will. Arthur recognizes that his son has grown up, and they each accept the changes that are results of their new lives on the island.

===''The World Beneath''===
[[File:Dinotopia-twb.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''Dinotopia: The World Beneath''.]]
The first sequel, ''Dinotopia: The World Beneath'' (1995) focuses mainly on Arthur Denison's return expedition to the World Beneath and opens with Will fly testing an invention of his father, the Dragoncopter – a [[steam engine]] [[ornithopter]] modeled on the [[dragonfly]]. The Dragoncopter fails and Will is narrowly saved by Cirrus, his Skybax mount, before the Dragoncopter plummets into a waterfall.

After returning from his first expedition in ''A Land Apart From Time'', Arthur presents two items he discovered – a sunstone and half of a key – to the council at Waterfall City in an attempt to get a second expedition into the World Beneath.

A musician named Oriana Nascava comes forward with the missing half of Arthur's key, claiming it to be a family heirloom. She is only willing to give it up if she is allowed to accompany Arthur in his expedition, a term that he reluctantly accepts. Together with Bix as a guide and the scandalous Lee Crabb, the group travels to the shady Pliosaur Canal where they board a [[submersible]] in order to take an underwater route to the World Beneath.

Meanwhile, Will and Sylvia have been assigned to accompany a [[sauropod]] [[caravan (travellers)|caravan]] through the Rainy Basin and keep a watch for predatory ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''. However, Cirrus flies Will to ancient ruins in the jungle of which the ''Tyrannosaurus'' are strangely protective.

Arthur, Oriana, Bix, and Lee continue to explore the caverns underneath Dinotopia where they come across instantly [[germination|germinating]] [[fern]] [[spore]]s, uncut sunstones that appear to store ancestral memory, and mechanical limbs that twitch when the sunstone is brought near. Eventually, they reach an enormous man-made chamber filled with abandoned [[Mecha|walking vehicles]] modelled after prehistoric animals, left behind by the ancient civilization of Poseidos, which they nickname "Strutters". Arthur, Oriana, and Bix commandeer a [[ceratopsian]] strutter while Crabb takes a strutter modeled after a [[eurypterid|sea scorpion]] and they both climb out of the World Beneath, ending up in the Rainy Basin. They join the sauropod convoy, but are attacked by a pack of ''Tyrannosaurus'' and ''[[Allosaurus]]'', during which Crabb escapes in his strutter and the head of the ceratopsian strutter is ripped off.

After escaping the carnivores, Arthur realizes that the ''Tyrannosaurus'' at the ruins may have been guarding the mythical ruby sunstone, and takes his strutter back into the Rainy Basin with Oriana and Bix to discover it. Along the way, they come across a trapped juvenile ''[[Giganotosaurus]]'' and free it. The grateful father, named Stinktooth, protects Arthur and his companions from the tyrannosaurs and allows them passage into the ruins.

Inside the temple, Bix reveals that in the past, people have escaped the island and brought with them culture from Dinotopian civilizations, influencing ancient [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] and [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] civilizations.

However, they are too late, as Crabb has arrived first and taken the ruby sunstone. Vowing to escape Dinotopia and bring back an army of strutters to plunder the island, he destroys Arthur's strutter with his sea scorpion and escapes. Riding on top of Stinktooth, Arthur chases Lee into the sea and pulls the sunstone out of the power socket in the strutter before Lee can escape. During this chase, Arthur's journal is lost to the ocean where it will be discovered by [[Philippine]] sailors and eventually make its way to the library where [[James Gurney]] discovers it.

At the end, the ruby sunstone is lost, a new romance is suggested between Arthur and Oriana, and Crabb is placed under guard by a pair of ''[[Stygimoloch]]''.

===''First Flight''===
[[File:First Flight.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''Dinotopia: First Flight''.]]
''Dinotopia: First Flight'' (1999) was a prequel published by Gurney and included a [[board game]].

The main [[protagonist]] of the story is Gideon Altaire, a flight school student living in the capital city of Poseidos off the Dinotopian mainland, in which all organic life (save for humans) has been replaced by mechanical counterparts. After discovering an injured ''[[Scaphognathus]]'' named Razzamult, Gideon discovers that the city is planning to launch an attack on the mainland and conquer all of Dinotopia and that they have stolen the ruby sunstone from the pterosaur home of Highnest.

Gideon sneaks into a factory and discovers an enormous air scorpion attack strutter under construction. He locates and steals the ruby sunstone and frees a group of captive [[pterosaur]]s before escaping to the mainland in a police skimmer. He arrives only to find the island already under attack. He discovers and enlists the help of a band of indigenous creatures- Binny, a ''[[Necrolemur]]'', Bandy, a ''[[Plesictis]]'', Bongo, a ''[[Plesiadapis]]'', and Budge, an ''[[Estemmenosuchus]]''. During their trek towards Highnest, they are ambushed by a spider like attack strutter which proceeds to steal the ruby sunstone.

Gideon and his band reach Highnest, where they help the pterosaurs evacuate the eggs, then take to the air atop their pterosaurs to engage the air scorpion. During the battle, Gideon manages to pull the ruby sunstone out of the flying machine's power socket, causing it to crash and stopping the invasion of Dinotopia.

Gideon is presented as the first ever Skybax rider, although the species he rode wasn't a ''[[Quetzalcoatlus]] northropi''.

===''Journey to Chandara''===
[[File:Journey to Chandara.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''Dinotopia: Journey to Chandara''.]]
A fourth Dinotopia book by James Gurney, ''Dinotopia: Journey to Chandara'', was published in October 2007.&lt;ref name=Dinotopia/&gt; In it, Hugo Khan, the mysterious and reclusive emperor of Chandara, an empire long since isolated from the rest of Dinotopia, has heard of Arthur Denison and Bix's exploits and sends them a personal invitation to his court. Along the way, the duo encounter several new locals, including an old musician named Cornelius Mazurka and his companion ''[[Therizinosaurus]]'' Henriette in the ruins of an old city, a town called Bilgewater made completely out of salvaged ships that the inhabitants believe will carry them into another world, and Jorotongo, a consistently festive and completely nomadic village composed of pilgrims from the ''Sunflower'', sister ship to the ''Mayflower''.

Eventually, they meet Lee Crabb en route at Sauropolis, who escapes from his ''Stygimoloch'' guards and steals the invitation. Without proper passes for the border guards, Arthur and Bix are forced to sneak through the swamp of Blackwood Flats while evading packs of carnivorous ''Allosaurus''. After passing through the mountain city of Thermala, the duo encounter Neighbor Dooh, a bandit who steals all the possessions of passing travelers and compensates them with the possessions of the previous victim. Although Arthur loses all of his scientific equipment, he is given a set of desert robes which allow him and Bix to blend into a Chandaran caravan and pass the border without harassment from the guards.

They stop by the ruins of Ebulon, where Arthur finds Will and Sylvia preparing for an air-jousting tournament. Soon after that, they make their way to the capital city of Chandara. By the time they arrive, they find themselves with few possessions left to barter save for ideas, so Arthur sets up shop in the Marketplace of Ideas. During the night, the writings at Arthur's stand catches the attention of the emperor and he and Bix are invited into the court.

Once at the court, they discover that Lee Crabb has also entered the court under the guise of Arthur Denison and is attempting to gather up a stockpile of weapons, arguing that he is preparing for a ''Tyrannosaurus'' invasion. Hugo Khan finally reveals himself to be a small ''[[Microraptor]]'', and the real Denison promptly exposes Crabb. Khan punishes Crabb by assigning him to be a chef for a band of ''[[Acrocanthosaurus]]'' [[Shaolin Monastery|Shaolin-monks]], who ate their last chef after he failed to satisfy them.

To commemorate Arthur and Bix's presence on the court, Hugo Khan flies out during the night to find a child in sorrow. The next day, Arthur, Bix, and a handful of the Emperor's selected entertainers arrive at the house of and greet Rita Rose and Jeffer, an [[orphan]]ed ''[[Europasaurus]]'' hatchling who has lost the ability to walk. At the end of the day, Hugo Khan expresses his wish for Chandara to be reopened culturally to the rest of Dinotopia. Arthur and Bix accept the Emperor's offers to stay in Chandara for a while to fully discover the city and its culture.

Two full-length adult fantasy novels were also issued with Gurney's authority, written by [[Alan Dean Foster]]: ''Dinotopia Lost'' (1996) and ''The Hand of Dinotopia'' (1999).

==TV miniseries==
{{main|Dinotopia (miniseries)}}
A 2002 four-hour TV mini-series produced by [[Hallmark Entertainment]] was also based on James Gurney's work, and was advertised as the first "mega-series." The show featured new characters such as Zippo (changed to Zippeau for the TV series to avoid legal issues with the lighter maker Zippo), a [[troodon]] who is said to have worked with Sylvia; the sunstones, a technology restricted to the lost city of Poseidos in the books, are commonplace in the miniseries.  The failure both of the sunstones and of Dinotopian officials to adhere to the underlying meanings of their culture's philosophy caused several discontented people – a leader-in-training, Zippeau himself, and two twentieth-century Dolphinbacks, Karl and David – to embark on a quest that led ultimately to the World Beneath. The series is presented as a sequel of sorts to the books: Will Denison's daughter followed her father into the Skybax corps (an order acknowledged to be founded by Gideon Altaire), Oriana's granddaughter is the female protagonist, the character Zippo is said to have been the dinosaur partner of Sylvia (here the Nursery overseer and not a Skybax rider), and Lee Crabb's son Cyrus features as the [[antagonist]]. The mini-series won an Emmy for its special effects.

===Code of Dinotopia===
In the world of Dinotopia, the Code of Dinotopia is an ancient stone tablet citing the rules of living in Dinotopia. As the part of the tablet cracked since it was first carved, the last portion of it had been missing, but was recovered in the TV mini-series ''[[Dinotopia (TV miniseries)|Dinotopia]]''. The code itself is as follows:

:'''S'''urvival of all or none.
:'''O'''ne raindrop raises the sea.
:'''W'''eapons are enemies, even to their owners.

:'''G'''ive more, take less.
:'''O'''thers first, self last.
:'''O'''bserve, listen and learn.
:'''D'''o one thing at a time.

:'''S'''ing every day.
:'''E'''xercise imagination.
:'''E'''at to live, don't live to eat.
:'''D'''on't p...

The recovered first letters of each sentence spell out "SOW GOOD SEED". It was first written in the Dinotopian alphabet. In the TV mini-series, the 11th code began with ''Fin...'' and was found to be "Find the light".

In the original book by James Gurney, the last line of the code was a small joke amongst the historians and the librarian, who seemed to think it could have been "Don't pee in the bath" referencing the Saurian community's distaste with some humans' lack of cleanliness and hygiene. This was never elaborated on further or confirmed to be true though. Another theory is "Don't put off work for tomorrow that can be done today".

==TV series==
{{Main|Dinotopia (TV series)}}
A TV series of thirteen episodes was produced later in 2002 as a result of the success of the mini-series, but none of the cast of the mini-series reprised their roles. In the later TV series, a group of people known as Outsiders live outside the laws of Dinotopia and pose an additional danger aside from the featured antagonists, which include ''[[Pteranodon]]'', ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'', and ''[[Postosuchus]]''.

ABC originally planned to launch the series in September 2002, but decided to wait until Thanksgiving.&lt;ref name=Dailynews/&gt; ABC was somewhat disappointed by the initial 5.7&amp;nbsp;million viewers and the poor ratings, but continued to air the series for a little while longer, pointing out that it had been an "odd viewing night overall."&lt;ref name=Dailynews&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/2002/12/03/2002-12-03__dinotopia__gets_chance_to_a.html |title='Dinotopia' Gets Chance to Avoid Extinction |accessdate=14 October 2008 |last=Petrozzello |first=Donna |date=3 December 2002 |work=Daily News|location=New York |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208152216/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/2002/12/03/2002-12-03__dinotopia__gets_chance_to_a.html |archivedate=8 December 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was finally canceled in December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/dec/17/entertainment/et-lowry17 |title=ABC's 'Dinotopia' is a thing of the past |accessdate=14 October 2008 |last=Lowry |first=Brian |date=17 December 2002 |work=Los Angeles Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only six of the thirteen episodes were aired on ABC, but all thirteen were broadcast the following year in Europe and were released onto a three-disc DVD box set.

Science-fiction veteran [[David Winning]] directed two episodes of the series, and location shooting lasted for three months near [[Budapest]], Hungary. [[Georgina Rylance]] played Marion Waldo, and [[Lisa Zane]] portrayed her old friend LeSage, the leader of the Outsiders.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick S. Clarke, ''[[Cinefantastique]]'' vol. 34 (2002), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Brandon]], [[Jonathan Hyde]], and [[Erik von Detten]] also star in the series.

===DVD releases===
[[Artisan Entertainment]] released the complete series on DVD in Region 1 for the first time on 20 January 2004.  This release has been discontinued and is out of print. On 15 March 2016, [[Mill Creek Entertainment]] re-released the complete series on DVD in Region 1.&lt;ref name="2016DVD"&gt;[http://tvshowsondvd.com/news/Dinotopia-The-Series/21827 'The Series' to be Re-Released in 2016 by Mill Creek Entertainment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151218123506/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Dinotopia-The-Series/21827 |date=18 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other media==
===Animated film===
There is also a 2005 [[traditional animation|traditionally animated]] movie called ''[[Dinotopia: Quest for the Ruby Sunstone]]''. This film deviated from the original books even more than the mini-series by featuring Ogthar, a mythical ruler of the World Beneath (mentioned in the mini-series), as a human [[warlord]] rather than a benevolent, if commanding, emperor.

===Video games===
A number of ''Dinotopia'' video games have been produced:

'''Disability abuse''' is when a person with a disability is abused [[Physical abuse|physically]], [[Financial abuse|financially]], [[Sexual abuse|sexually]] and/or [[Psychological abuse|psychologically]] due to the person having a disability. Since many disabilities are not visible (for example, [[asthma]], [[schizophrenia]], or [[learning disabilities]]) some abusers cannot rationalise the non-physical disability with a need for understanding, support, and so on. Since some disabled people are in need of additional support from others throughout their lives, they are also [[social vulnerability|vulnerable]] to [[neglect]]. Disability abuse has also been considered a [[hate crime]].&lt;ref name=Quarmby&gt;Quarmby, Katharine.

''Portobello'', 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The abuse is not limited to those who are visibly disabled such as wheelchair-users or physically deformed such as those with a [[cleft lip]] but also those with [[learning disabilities]] or difficulties such as dyslexia and dysgraphia, and other disabilities, including [[autism spectrum disorder]], [[Down syndrome]]&lt;ref name=Sainsbury&gt;Sainsbury, Clare.

There are many known cases in which the disabled have been abused by staff of a care institution, such as the case revealed in a [[BBC]] ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' programme on a Castlebeck care home ([[Winterbourne View]]) near [[Bristol]] which led to its closure and the suspension or dismissal of some of the staff.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite news

Those with learning disabilities are often not as able to explain things to other people so are more likely to be disbelieved or ignored if they do complain.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}  There was one study done that shows 60 percent of the children with disabilities come forth about being bullied regularly, versus 25 percent of the students who are being bullied with no disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 10 facts parents, educators, and Students need to Know|url=http://www.pacer.org/bullying/resources/students-with-disabilities/|website=Bullying and Harassment of Students with Disabilities}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This can also affect their learning and school and education.  Their grades are more at risk in dropping, they have a more difficult time concentrating, and there is no interest in school and the learning material.  All of this can lead to the child dropping out of school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 10 facts parents. educators, and students need to know|url=http://www.pacer.org/bullying/resources/students-with-disabilities/|website=National Bullying prevention center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been numerous cases of parents of children with disabilities who have murdered their children because of their disabilities. Sometimes the parents kill themselves alongside their child. It was even advocated by Aristotle in the case of congenital deformity—"As to the exposure of children, let there be a law that no deformed child shall live."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Aristotle (384–322 bc): philosopher and scientist of ancient Greece| pmc=2672651 | pmid=16371395|doi=10.1136/adc.2005.074534|volume=91|year=2006|pages=F75–7 | last1 = Dunn | first1 = PM | journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is documented in various indigenous societies.

==Bullying==
{{Main article|Bullying}}
Bullying is an aggressive behavior or attitude towards a person that is unwanted.  It is usually a repeated behavior.  There is more than just one type of bullying, there is verbal bullying, social, and physical.  Verbal bullying consist of name calling a person, teasing, and threatening to cause harm to the person.  Social abuse is intentionally leaving a person out while in a social setting or gathering, or taunting the person.  Physical abuse consist of hitting or pushing someone, pulling their hair, tripping them, or breaking their belongings intentionally.  Bullying happens usually before or after school hours, and it is usually done on campus or on the playground of the school.  However, it can also happen while on the school bus or going to and from the school bus.   Bullying can also happen through the internet or through the phone as well, this is known as cyber bullying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stopbullying.gov/what-is-bullying/definition/|title=Bullying definition|last=|first=|date=|website=Stop Bullying|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 survey by the [[Interactive Autism Network]] found that 63% of children with [[autism]] are bullied in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-204_162-57406540/survey-finds-63-of-children-with-autism-bullied/ |title=Survey finds 63% of children with autism bullied |format= |work=CBS News |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over a third of autistic adults said they had been bullied at work in a survey by the UK's [[National Autistic Society]].&lt;ref name="The Independent"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/autistic-adults-bullied-and-not-supported-at-work-poll-shows-7743517.html |title=Autistic adults bullied and not supported at work, poll shows  |work=The Independent (UK) |accessdate= |location=London |first=Sarah |last=Cassidy |date=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

82% of children with learning disability in the UK are bullied, according to [[Mencap]], and 79% are scared to go out in case they are bullied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/jun/18/schools.children | title = Eight of out 10 disabled children bullied, report finds | accessdate = 2016-10-23| date = 2007-06-18| work = Mencap}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey that was done shows that roughly 7 out of 10 people with disabilities have been abused, and that it is an ongoing problem.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.disabilityscoop.com/2013/09/04/survey-abuse-widespread/18652/|title=Survey Finds Disability Abuse Widespread|website=Disability Scoop|access-date=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also found that bullying people with disabilities is a problem that is going on in different countries as well, and that problem is not always surfaced and given attention to.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Bullying is also a cause of disability and exacerbates existing disabilities.

Bullying can take occur in a variety of forms. They aren't always physical. Verbal bullying and nonverbal bullying are the ones that occur very often. Catherine Thornberry and Karin Olson claim that carers often [[Dehumanization|dehumanize]] disabled people, taking away their abilities and qualities that make them a person and lowering them to the level of just an object or a thing. They found that the caregivers or assistants are often the ones who are unintentionally bullying the disabled individuals. The caregivers look at the individuals at lower standard than they do other people, leading to their labeling of disabled individuals as a hate crime.&lt;ref&gt;Thornberry, Catherine, and Karin Olson.

Bullying a child with a disability is considered to be harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pacer.org/bullying/resources/students-with-disabilitie|title=Bullying and Harassment of Students with Disabilities|last=|first=|date=|website=Top 10 facts parents, educators, and students need to know|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual abuse==
{{Main article|Sexual abuse}}
Disabled people are more vulnerable to sexual abuse than the general population for numerous reasons. As they are less likely to report what has happened to them, their rapists are able to get away with the abuse. Victims often not taken seriously due to [[ableism]] which intersects with societal myths about sexual violence, for example, that 'ugly' people aren't raped, since society's beauty standard devalues disability.

According to Valenti-Hein &amp; Schwartz, only 3% of sexual abuse cases involving developmentally disabled people are ever reported, more than 90% of developmentally disabled people will experience sexual abuse at some point in their lives, and 49% will experience 10 or more abusive incidents.&lt;ref name="Leigh Ann Davis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwild.org/Victims%20of%20Crime/Downloads/Research/Vulnerability%20and%20Abuse%20of%20People%20with%20an%20Intellectual%20Disability/Davis%20n.d.pdf |title=People with Mental Retardation &amp; Sexual Abuse |format= |work=by Leigh Ann Davis |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study published in the ''British Journal of Psychiatry'' by Sequeira, Howlin, &amp; Hollins found that sexual abuse is associated with a higher incidence of psychiatric and behavioural disorder in people with learning disabilities in a case-control study. Sexual abuse was associated with increased rates of mental illness and behavioural problems, and with symptoms of post-traumatic stress. Psychological reactions to abuse were similar to those observed in the general population, but with the addition of stereotypical behaviour. The more serious the abuse, the more severe the symptoms that were reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/183/5/451|title=Psychological disturbance associated with sexual abuse in people with learning disabilities. Case-control study.|vauthors=Sequeira, H, Howlin, P, Hollins, S|journal=British Journal of Psychiatry|volume=183|number=5|year=2003|pages=451–456|doi=10.1192/bjp.183.5.451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual abuse is less likely to be reported by individuals with disabilities. The people that surround these individuals are often found to be less likely to report these cases of abuse. Society sees the disabled as weak and vulnerable targets, making it easy for the abuser to not feel guilty or to blame themselves. More often than not people figure they can trust their physicians or doctors who provide care for these individuals. In a clinical study it was found that the physicians would provide poor quality of care to individuals with disabilities. They would suppress the problems instead of addressing them by giving them drugs to make them be quiet. It was also found that physicians were less likely to report sexual abuse or any abuse that they found present on these individuals. The justified these actions by believing that in society that disabled people matter less than any other person.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Ruth.

Community Mental Health Journal 36.6 (2001): 499–509. Proquest Central. Web. 24 Apr. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder==
Extreme disability abuse can lead directly or indirectly to death. In [[Tanzania]], people with [[albinism]] are hunted by witchcraft practitioners for their organs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sociocultural aspects of albinism in Sub-Saharan Africa: mutilations and ritual murders committed in east Africa (Burundi and Tanzania)| pmid=20025171 | volume=69 | year=2009| journal=Med Trop (Mars)| pages=449–53 | last1 = Aquaron | first1 = R | last2 = Djatou | first2 = M | last3 = Kamdem | first3 = L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In England and Wales over 1700 disability hate crimes were recorded by police in 2011 and 2012, but a review by the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] said that they are 'overlooked' and 'under-reported'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Disability hate crime is 'overlooked and under-reported'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21865264|newspaper=BBC | date=2013-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Awareness Center"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theawarenesscenter.blogspot.co.uk/2002/08/people-with-mental-retardation-sexual.html |title=People with Mental Retardation &amp; Sexual Abuse |work=The Awareness Center |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7170">'''Dysfunctional impulsivity''' is a type of [[impulsivity]]{{vague|date=January 2014}} that is associated with a tendency to make quick decisions when this type of decision-making is non-optimal. This differs from [[functional impulsivity]] which is a tendency to make quick decisions where this is optimal. As dysfunctional impulsivity is often associated with a failure to consider the consequences of one’s behavior, it can often lead to life difficulties.&lt;ref name="Dickman"&gt;Dickman, S. J. (1990). Functional and dysfunctional impulsivity: Personality and cognitive correlates. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', 58(1), 95-102.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dickman Impulsivity Inventory ==

The distinction between functional and dysfunctional impulsivity was suggested by Scott J. Dickman in an article published in 1990. Before this, impulsivity was considered a complex construct that was made up of several different aspects. The Dickman Inventory classifies impulsivity into functional and dysfunctional categories.&lt;ref name="Dickman" /&gt;

Many of the previously used impulsivity scales have been significantly correlated to measures of dysfunctional impulsivity. These include the impulsiveness scale of Eysenck’s Impulsivity Inventory (part of the [[Eysenck Personality Questionnaire]]) as well as the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale.&lt;ref&gt;Cosi, S., Morales-Vives, F., Canals, J., Lorenzo-Seva, U., &amp; Vigil-Colet, A. (2008). Functional and dysfunctional impulsivity in childhood and adolescence. ''Psychological Reports'', 103, 67-76.&lt;/ref&gt;
Many of the questions used in the Dickman Impulsivity Inventory mirror those used on past questionnaires, and are used to assess overall impulsivity. Of the 23 questions on the Dickman Impulsivity Inventory, 12 of the items are used to measure dysfunctional impulsivity. This includes questions such as “I often get into trouble because I don’t think before I act” as well as “I often say and do things without considering the consequences”&lt;ref name="Dickman" /&gt; This scale has been adapted for use in children with similar results: clear distinctions between functional and dysfunctional impulsivity.&lt;ref&gt;Brunas-Wagstaff, J., Tilley, A., Verity, M., Ford, S., &amp; Thompson, D. (1997). Functional and dysfunctional impulsivity in children and their relationship to Eysenck’s impulsiveness and venturesomeness dimensions. ''Personality and Individual Differences'', 22(1), 19-35.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been translated into several languages, yielding similar results

E., &amp; Yeomans, M. R. (2007). Relationships between functional and dysfunctional impulsivity, delay discounting, and cognitive distortions. ''Personality and Individual Differences'', 43, 1517-1528.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Substance abuse ===

Impulsivity is significantly correlated with individuals being at a greater risk for [[substance abuse]]. Several studies have furthered this association to specifically relate dysfunctional impulsivity to this tendency.

[[Binge drinkers]] were found to have significantly higher scores of dysfunctional impulsivity compared to control groups. The same study found no difference in levels of functional impulsivity between groups, indicating that dysfunctional impulsivity was the version of impulsivity that led to substance abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Adan, A. (2011). Impulsividad functional y disfuncional en jovenes con consume intensive de alcohol (binge drinking). [Functional and dysfunctional impulsivity in young binge drinkers.] [Abstract]. ''Addicciones'', 24(1), 17-22.&lt;/ref&gt; This relationship with dysfunctional impulsivity has also been found in regards to cigarette smoking. Higher levels of dysfunctional impulsivity have been related to difficulty restraining oneself from smoking in inappropriate places, smoking without being aware of doing so, and overall craving for cigarettes.&lt;ref&gt;Pitts, S. R. &amp; Leventhal A. M. (2012). Associations of functional and dysfunctional impulsivity to smoking characteristics. ''Journal of Addiction Medicine'', 6(3), 226-232. doi.10.1097/ADM.0b013e31825e2a67&lt;/ref&gt; Dysfunctional impulsivity scores have also been found to be higher in heroin users&lt;ref&gt;Mokri, A., Ekhtiari, H., Edalati, H., Ganjgahi, H., &amp; Naderi, P.

The [[equivalence principle]] is one of the corner-stones of [[gravitation|gravitation theory]].  Different formulations of the '''equivalence principle''' are labeled ''weakest'', ''weak'', ''middle-strong'' and ''strong.''  All of these formulations are based on the empirical equality of inertial mass, gravitational active and passive charges.

The ''weakest'' equivalence principle is restricted to the motion law of a probe point mass in a uniform [[gravitational field]]. Its localization is the ''weak'' equivalence principle that states the existence of a desired local inertial frame at a given world point. This is the case of equations depending on a gravitational field and its first order derivatives, e. g., the equations of mechanics of probe point masses, and the equations of electromagnetic and Dirac fermion fields. The ''middle-strong'' equivalence principle is concerned with any matter, except a gravitational field, while the ''strong'' one is applied to all physical laws.

The above-mentioned variants of the equivalence principle aim to guarantee the transition of [[General Relativity]] to [[Special Relativity]] in a certain [[frame of reference|reference frame]]. However, only the particular ''weakest'' and ''weak'' equivalence principles are true. 
To overcome this difficulty, the equivalence principle can be formulated in geometric terms as follows.

In the spirit of [[Felix Klein|Felix Klein's]] [[Erlanger program]], Special Relativity can be characterized as the [[Klein geometry]] of [[Lorentz group]] invariants. Then the '''geometric equivalence principle''' is formulated to require the existence of Lorentz invariants on a [[world manifold]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{X}\,&lt;/math&gt;. This requirement holds if the [[tangent bundle]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{TX}\,&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{X}\,&lt;/math&gt; admits an atlas with Lorentz transition functions, i.e., a structure group of the associated [[frame bundle]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{FX}\,&lt;/math&gt; of linear tangent frames in &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{TX}\,&lt;/math&gt; is reduced to the Lorentz group &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\mathrm{SO}(1,3)}\,&lt;/math&gt;. By virtue of the well known theorem on [[reduction of the structure group|structure group reduction]], this reduction takes place if and only if the quotient bundle &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{FX/\mathrm{SO}(1,3)}\to \scriptstyle{X}\,&lt;/math&gt; possesses a global section, which is a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo-Riemannian metric]] on &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{X}\,&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus the geometric equivalence principle provides the necessary and sufficient conditions of the existence of a pseudo-Riemannian metric, i.e., a [[gravitational field]] on a world manifold.

Based on the geometric equivalence principle, gravitation theory is formulated as [[gauge gravitation theory|gauge theory]] where a gravitational field is described as a [[Higgs field (classical)|classical Higgs field]] responsible for spontaneous breakdown of space-time symmetries.

Where &lt;math&gt;P = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^n : Ax \leq b\}&lt;/math&gt;.  If &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is a bounded polyhedron (and thus a polytope) and &lt;math&gt;x^\ast&lt;/math&gt; is an optimal solution to the problem, then &lt;math&gt;x^\ast&lt;/math&gt; is either an extreme point (vertex) of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, or lies on a face &lt;math&gt;F \subset P&lt;/math&gt; of optimal solutions.

==Proof==
Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that &lt;math&gt;x^\ast \in \mathrm{int}(P)&lt;/math&gt;. Then there exists some &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that the ball of radius &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; centered at &lt;math&gt;x^\ast&lt;/math&gt; is contained in &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, that is &lt;math&gt;B_{\epsilon}(x^\ast) \subset P&lt;/math&gt;.  Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt;x^\ast - \frac{\epsilon}{2} \frac{c}{||c||} \in P&lt;/math&gt; and 

:&lt;math&gt;c^T\left( x^\ast - \frac{\epsilon}{2} \frac{c}{||c||}\right) = c^T x^\ast - \frac{\epsilon}{2} \frac{c^T c}{||c||} = c^T x^\ast - \frac{\epsilon}{2} ||c|| &lt; c^T x^\ast.&lt;/math&gt;

Hence &lt;math&gt;x^\ast&lt;/math&gt; is not an optimal solution, a contradiction. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;x^\ast&lt;/math&gt; must live on the boundary of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;x^\ast&lt;/math&gt; is not a vertex itself, it must be the convex combination of vertices of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, say &lt;math&gt;x_1, ..., x_t&lt;/math&gt;.  Then &lt;math&gt;x^\ast = \sum_{i=1}^t \lambda_i x_i&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^t \lambda_i = 1&lt;/math&gt;.  Observe that 

:&lt;math&gt;0=c^{T}\left(\left(\sum_{i=1}^{t}\lambda_{i}x_{i}\right)-x^{\ast}\right)=c^{T}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{t}\lambda_{i}(x_{i}-x^{\ast})\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{t}\lambda_{i}(c^{T}x_{i}-c^{T}x^{\ast}).&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;x^{\ast}&lt;/math&gt; is an optimal solution, all terms in the sum are nonnegative. Since the sum is equal to zero, we must have that each individual term is equal to zero.  Hence, &lt;math&gt;c^{T}x^{\ast}=c^{T}x_{i}&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;, so every &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; is also optimal, and therefore all points on the face whose vertices are &lt;math&gt;x_1, ..., x_t&lt;/math&gt;, are optimal solutions.

[[File:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|thumb|The study of planetary habitability is partly based upon extrapolation from knowledge of the [[Earth]]'s conditions, as the Earth is the only planet currently known to harbour life.]]

The '''Gaia hypothesis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|aɪ|.|ə}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|eɪ|.|ə}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|aɪ|ˈ|ʌ}}), also known as the '''Gaia theory''' or the '''Gaia principle''', proposes that living [[organism]]s interact with their [[inorganic]] surroundings on [[Earth]] to form a [[synergistic]] and [[Homeostasis|self-regulating]], [[complex system]] that helps to maintain and perpetuate the conditions for [[life]] on the planet.

The hypothesis was formulated by the chemist [[James Lovelock]]&lt;ref name="J1972" /&gt; and co-developed by the microbiologist [[Lynn Margulis]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="lovelock1974"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lovelock|first1=J.E.|last2=Margulis|first2=L.|title=Atmospheric homeostasis by and for the biosphere: the Gaia hypothesis|journal=Tellus|date=1974|volume=26|series=Series A|issue=1–2|pages=2–10|doi=10.1111/j.2153-3490.1974.tb01946.x|url=http://tellusa.net/index.php/tellusa/article/view/9731|accessdate=20 October 2012|publisher=International Meteorological Institute|location=Stockholm|issn=1600-0870|ref=harv|bibcode=1974Tell...26....2L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lovelock named the idea after [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], the primordial goddess who personified the Earth in [[Greek mythology]]. In 2006, the [[Geological Society of London]] awarded Lovelock the [[Wollaston Medal]] in part for his work on the Gaia hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wollaston Award Lovelock|url=https://www.geolsoc.org.uk/About/History/Awards-Citations-Replies-2001-Onwards/2006-Awards-Citations-Replies|accessdate=19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Topics related to the hypothesis include how the [[biosphere]] and the [[evolution]] of organisms affect the stability of [[global temperature]], [[salinity]] of [[seawater]], [[atmospheric oxygen]] levels, the maintenance of a [[hydrosphere]] of liquid water and other environmental variables that affect the [[habitability of Earth]].

The Gaia hypothesis was initially criticized for being [[teleological]] and against the principles of [[natural selection]], but later refinements aligned the Gaia hypothesis with ideas from fields such as [[Earth system science]], [[biogeochemistry]] and [[systems ecology]].&lt;ref name="Turney, Jon 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schwartzman2002"&gt;{{cite book |author=Schwartzman, David |title=Life, Temperature, and the Earth: The Self-Organizing Biosphere |publisher=Columbia University Press |date=2002 |isbn=0-231-10213-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gribbin, John (1990), "Hothouse earth: The greenhouse effect and Gaia" (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson)&lt;/ref&gt; Lovelock also once described the "geophysiology" of the Earth.&lt;ref name="agesofgaia"&gt;Lovelock, James, (1995) "The Ages of Gaia: A Biography of Our Living Earth" (W.W.Norton &amp; Co)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Explain|date=December 2017}} Even so, the Gaia hypothesis continues to attract criticism, and today some scientists consider it to be only weakly supported by, or at odds with, the available evidence.&lt;ref name="kirchner2002"&gt;{{Citation |last= Kirchner |first = James W. |title =Toward a future for Gaia theory |journal=[[Climatic Change (journal)|Climatic Change]] |volume = 52 |pages = 391–408 |date = 2002 | doi = 10.1023/a:1014237331082 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="volk2002"&gt;{{Citation |last= Volk |first = Tyler |title =The Gaia hypothesis: fact, theory, and wishful thinking |journal = Climatic Change |volume = 52 |pages = 423–430 |date = 2002 | doi = 10.1023/a:1014218227825 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="beerling2007"&gt;{{cite book |last=Beerling |first=David |authorlink=David Beerling|date=2007 |title=The Emerald Planet: How plants changed Earth's history |url=http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780192806024.do |location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press |page= |isbn= 978-0-19-280602-4 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Gaian hypotheses suggest that organisms [[Co-evolution|co-evolve]] with their environment: that is, they "influence their [[abiotic]] environment, and that environment in turn influences the [[Biota (ecology)|biota]] by [[Darwinism|Darwinian process]]". Lovelock (1995) gave evidence of this in his second book, showing the evolution from the world of the early [[Bacteria|thermo-acido-philic]] and [[methanogenic bacteria]] towards the oxygen-enriched [[atmosphere]] today that supports more [[Phanerozoic|complex life]].

A reduced version of the hypothesis has been called "influential Gaia"&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lapenis|first=Andrei G.|year=2002|title=Directed Evolution of the Biosphere: Biogeochemical Selection or Gaia?|url=|journal=The Professional Geographer|volume=54 |issue=3|pages=379–391|via=[Peer Reviewed Journal]}}&lt;/ref&gt; in "Directed Evolution of the Biosphere: Biogeochemical Selection or Gaia?" by Andrei G. Lapenis, which states the [[Biota (ecology)|biota]] influence certain aspects of the abiotic world, e.g. [[temperature]] and atmosphere.  This is not the work of an individual but a collective of Russian scientific research that was combined into this peer reviewed publication. It states the coevolution of life and the environment through “micro-forces”&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; and biogeochemical processes. An example is how the activity of [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] bacteria during Precambrian times have completely modified the [[Earth's atmosphere|Earth atmosphere]] to turn it aerobic, and as such supporting evolution of life (in particular [[eukaryotic]] life).

Since barriers existed throughout the Twentieth Century between Russia and the rest of the world, it is only relatively recently that the early Russian scientists who introduced concepts overlapping the Gaia hypothesis have become better known to the Western scientific community.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; These scientists include:
# [[Piotr Kropotkin|Piotr Alekseevich Kropotkin]] (1842–1921)
# Rafail Vasil’evich Rizpolozhensky (1847–1918)
# [[Vladimir Ivanovich Vernadsky]] (1863–1945)
# Vladimir Alexandrovich Kostitzin (1886–1963)

Biologists and Earth scientists usually view the factors that stabilize the characteristics of a period as an undirected [[emergent property]] or [[entelechy]] of the system; as each individual species pursues its own self-interest, for example, their combined actions may have counterbalancing effects on environmental change. Opponents of this view sometimes reference examples of events that resulted in dramatic change rather than stable equilibrium, such as the conversion of the Earth's atmosphere from a [[reducing environment]] to an [[oxygen]]-rich one at the end of the [[Archean|Archaean]] and the beginning of the [[Proterozoic]] periods.

Less accepted versions of the hypothesis claim that changes in the biosphere are brought about through the [[Superorganism|coordination of living organisms]] and maintain those conditions through [[homeostasis]]. In some versions of [[Gaia philosophy]], all lifeforms are considered part of one single living planetary being called ''Gaia''. In this view, the atmosphere, the seas and the terrestrial crust would be results of interventions carried out by Gaia through the [[Coevolution|coevolving]] diversity of living organisms.

The Gaia hypothesis was an influence on the [[deep ecology]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;David Landis Barnhill, Roger S. Gottlieb (eds.), ''Deep Ecology and World Religions: New Essays on Sacred Ground'', SUNY Press, 2010, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details==
The Gaia hypothesis posits that the Earth is a self-regulating [[complex system]] involving the [[biosphere]], the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], the [[hydrosphere]]s and the [[pedosphere]], tightly coupled as an evolving system. The hypothesis contends that this system as a whole, called Gaia, seeks a physical and chemical environment optimal for contemporary life.&lt;ref name="vanishing255"&gt;Lovelock, James. ''The Vanishing Face of Gaia''. Basic Books, 2009, p. 255. {{ISBN|978-0-465-01549-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaia evolves through a [[Cybernetic#In biology|cybernetic]] [[feedback]] system operated unconsciously by the [[biota (ecology)|biota]], leading to broad stabilization of the conditions of habitability in a full homeostasis. Many processes in the Earth's surface essential for the conditions of life depend on the interaction of living forms, especially [[microorganisms]], with inorganic elements. These processes establish a global control system that regulates Earth's [[Sea surface temperature|surface temperature]], [[atmosphere composition]] and [[ocean]] [[salinity]], powered by the global thermodynamic disequilibrium state of the Earth system.&lt;ref&gt;Kleidon, Axel. ''How does the earth system generate and maintain thermodynamic disequilibrium and what does it imply for the future of the planet?''. Article submitted to the ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society'' on Thu, 10 Mar 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Article submitted to Royal Society is not a valid reference. This must be replaced by actual article citation if accepted, or an alternative reference --&gt;

The existence of a planetary homeostasis influenced by living forms had been observed previously in the field of [[biogeochemistry]], and it is being investigated also in other fields like [[Earth system science]]. The originality of the Gaia hypothesis relies on the assessment that such homeostatic balance is actively pursued with the goal of keeping the optimal conditions for life, even when terrestrial or external events menace them.&lt;ref&gt;Lovelock, James. ''The Vanishing Face of Gaia''. Basic Books, 2009, p. 179. {{ISBN|978-0-465-01549-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulation of global surface temperature===
[[File:All palaeotemps.png|thumb|Rob Rohde's palaeotemperature graphs]]
{{See also|Paleoclimatology}}
Since life started on Earth, the energy provided by the [[Sun]] has increased by 25% to 30%;&lt;ref name="Owen1979"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Owen, T. | author2 = Cess, R.D. | author3 = Ramanathan, V. | date = 1979 | title = Earth: An enhanced carbon dioxide greenhouse to compensate for reduced solar luminosity | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 277 | pages = 640–2 | doi = 10.1038/277640a0 | issue=5698 | bibcode = 1979Natur.277..640O | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the surface temperature of the planet has remained within the levels of habitability, reaching quite regular low and high margins.  Lovelock has also hypothesised that methanogens produced elevated levels of methane in the early atmosphere, giving a view similar to that found in petrochemical smog, similar in some respects to the atmosphere on [[Titan (moon)|Titan]].&lt;ref name="agesofgaia"/&gt; This, he suggests tended to screen out ultraviolet until the formation of the ozone screen, maintaining a degree of homeostasis.  However, the [[Snowball Earth]]&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, P.F. 2001. [http://www.snowballearth.org ''Snowball Earth theory'']&lt;/ref&gt; research has suggested that "oxygen shocks" and reduced methane levels led, during the [[Huronian]], [[Sturtian]] and [[Marinoan]]/[[Cryogenian|Varanger]] Ice Ages, to a world that very nearly became a solid "snowball". These epochs are evidence against the ability of the pre [[Phanerozoic]] biosphere to fully self-regulate.

Processing of the greenhouse gas CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, explained below, plays a critical role in the maintenance of the Earth temperature within the limits of habitability.

The [[CLAW hypothesis]], inspired by the Gaia hypothesis, proposes a [[feedback|feedback loop]] that operates between [[ocean]] [[ecosystem]]s and the [[Earth]]'s [[climate]].&lt;ref name="CLAW87"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/326655a0 |author=[[Robert Jay Charlson|Charlson, R. J.]], [[James Lovelock|Lovelock, J. E]], Andreae, M. O. and Warren, S. G. |title=Oceanic phytoplankton, atmospheric sulphur, cloud albedo and climate |journal=Nature |volume=326 |issue=6114 |pages=655–661 |date=1987 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v326/n6114/abs/326655a0.html |bibcode=1987Natur.326..655C |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[hypothesis]] specifically proposes that particular [[phytoplankton]] that produce [[dimethyl sulfide]] are responsive to variations in [[climate forcing]], and that these responses lead to a [[negative feedback|negative feedback loop]] that acts to stabilise the [[temperature]] of the [[Earth's atmosphere]].

Currently the increase in human population and the environmental impact of their activities, such as the multiplication of [[greenhouse gases]] may cause [[negative feedback]]s in the environment to become [[positive feedback]]. Lovelock has stated that this could bring an [[James Lovelock#The revenge of Gaia|extremely accelerated global warming]],&lt;ref&gt;Lovelock, James. ''The Vanishing Face of Gaia''. Basic Books, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-465-01549-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he has since stated the effects will likely occur more slowly.&lt;ref&gt;Lovelock J., NBC News.

====Daisyworld simulations====
[[File:StandardDaisyWorldRun2color.gif|thumb|Plots from a standard black &amp; white [[Daisyworld]] simulation]]
{{Main|Daisyworld}}
James Lovelock and [[Andrew Watson (scientist)|Andrew Watson]] developed the mathematical model [[Daisyworld]], in which temperature regulation arises from a simple ecosystem consisting of two species whose activity varies in response to the planet's environment. The model demonstrates that beneficial feedback mechanisms can emerge in this "toy world" containing only self-interested organisms rather than through classic [[group selection]] mechanisms.&lt;ref name="daisyworld"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daisyworld examines the [[Earth's energy budget|energy budget]] of a planet populated by two different types of plants, black daisies and white daisies. The colour of the daisies influences the [[albedo]] of the planet such that black daisies absorb light and warm the planet, while white daisies reflect light and cool the planet. As the model runs the output of the "sun" increases, meaning that the surface temperature of an uninhabited "gray" planet will steadily rise. In contrast, on Daisyworld competition between the daisies (based on temperature-effects on growth rates) leads to a shifting balance of daisy populations that tends to favour a planetary temperature close to the optimum for daisy growth.

It has been suggested that the results were predictable because Lovelock and Watson selected examples that produced the responses they desired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1023/A:1023494111532 | date = 2003 | last1 = Kirchner | first1 = James W. | journal = Climatic Change | volume = 58 |issue=1–2| pages = 21–45 |title=The Gaia Hypothesis: Conjectures and Refutations | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulation of oceanic salinity===
Ocean [[salinity]] has been constant at about 3.5% for a very long time.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Introduction to Ocean Sciences|last=Segar|first=Douglas|publisher=Library of Congress|year=2012|isbn=978-0-9857859-0-1|location=http://www.reefimages.com/oceans/SegarOcean3Chap05.pdf|pages=Chapter 5 3rd Edition|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salinity stability in oceanic environments is important as most cells require a rather constant salinity and do not generally tolerate values above 5%. The constant ocean salinity was a long-standing mystery, because no process counterbalancing the salt influx from rivers was known. Recently it was suggested&lt;ref name="Gorham19912"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gorham|first=Eville|date=1 January 1991|title=Biogeochemistry: its origins and development|url=https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00002942|journal=Biogeochemistry|publisher=Kluwer Academic|volume=13|issue=3|pages=199–239|doi=10.1007/BF00002942|issn=1573-515X|ref=harv|accessdate=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that salinity may also be strongly influenced by [[seawater]] circulation through hot [[basalt]]ic rocks, and emerging as hot water vents on [[mid-ocean ridge]]s. However, the composition of seawater is far from equilibrium, and it is difficult to explain this fact without the influence of organic processes. One suggested explanation lies in the formation of salt plains throughout Earth's history. It is hypothesized that these are created by bacterial colonies that fix ions and heavy metals during their life processes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the biogeochemical processes of the earth, sources and sinks are the movement of elements. The composition of salt ions within our oceans and seas are: sodium (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), chlorine (Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), sulfate (SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;), Magnesium (Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) and potassium (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;).  The elements that comprise salinity do not readily change and are a conservative property of seawater.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  There are many mechanisms that change salinity from a particulate form to a dissolved form and back. The known sources of sodium i.e. salts is when weathering, erosion, and dissolution of rocks transport into rivers and deposit into the oceans.

The [[Mediterranean Sea]] as being Gaia's kidney is found ([http://scimar.icm.csic.es/scimar/index.php/secId/6/IdArt/209/ here]) by Kenneth J. Hsue a correspondence author in 2001.  The "[[desiccation]]" of the Mediterranean is the evidence of a functioning kidney.  Earlier "kidney functions" were performed during the "[[Deposition (geology)|deposition]] of the [[Cretaceous]] ([[Atlantic Ocean|South Atlantic]]), [[Jurassic]] ([[Gulf of Mexico]]), [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|Permo-Triassic]] ([[Europe]]), [[Devonian]] ([[Canada]]), [[Cambrian]]/[[Precambrian]] ([[Gondwana]]) saline giants."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scimar.icm.csic.es/scimar/index.php/secId/6/IdArt/209/|title=Scientia Marina: List of Issues|last=http://www.webviva.com|first=Justino Martinez.

The Gaia hypothesis states that the Earth's [[Atmospheric chemistry#Atmospheric composition|atmospheric composition]] is kept at a dynamically steady state by the presence of life.&lt;ref&gt;Lovelock, James. ''The Vanishing Face of Gaia''. Basic Books, 2009, p. 163. {{ISBN|978-0-465-01549-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The atmospheric composition provides the conditions that contemporary life has adapted to. All the atmospheric gases other than [[noble gas]]es present in the atmosphere are either made by organisms or processed by them.

The stability of the atmosphere in Earth is not a consequence of [[chemical equilibrium]]. [[Oxygen]] is a reactive compound, and should eventually combine with gases and minerals of the Earth's atmosphere and crust.  Oxygen only began to persist in the atmosphere in small quantities about 50 million years before the start of the [[Great Oxygenation Event]].&lt;ref name=Anabar2007&gt;{{Cite journal| last4 = Arnold| last6 = Creaser| last3 = Lyons| first1 = A. | first2 = Y.| last9 = Scott| last2 = Duan | first3 = T. | first4 = G.| last8 = Gordon | first5 = B. | first10 = J. | first6 = R.| last10 = Garvin | first7 = A.| last11 = Buick | first8 = G. | first11 = R. | first9 = C.| title = A whiff of oxygen before the great oxidation event?| journal = Science| volume = 317| issue = 5846| year = 2007| last7 = Kaufman| pages = 1903–1906| last5 = Kendall| pmid = 17901330| last1 = Anbar | doi = 10.1126/science.1140325|bibcode = 2007Sci...317.1903A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the start of the [[Cambrian]] period, atmospheric oxygen concentrations have fluctuated between 15% and 35% of atmospheric volume.&lt;ref name=Berner1999&gt;{{Cite journal

Recent work on the findings of fire-caused charcoal in Carboniferous and Cretaceous coal measures, in geologic periods when O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; did exceed 25%, has supported Lovelock's contention. {{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===Processing of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;===
{{See also|Carbon cycle}}
Gaia scientists see the participation of living organisms in the [[carbon cycle]] as one of the complex processes that maintain conditions suitable for life. The only significant natural source of [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric carbon dioxide]] ([[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]) is [[volcanic activity]], while the only significant removal is through the precipitation of [[carbonate rocks]].&lt;ref name="Karhu1996"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Karhu, J.A. | author2 = Holland, H.D. | date = 1 October 1996 | title = Carbon isotopes and the rise of atmospheric oxygen | journal = [[Geology (journal)|Geology]] | volume = 24 | issue = 10 | pages = 867–870 | url = http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/24/10/867 | doi = 10.1130/0091-7613(1996)024&lt;0867:CIATRO&gt;2.3.CO;2|bibcode = 1996Geo....24..867K | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon precipitation, solution and [[Carbon fixation|fixation]] are influenced by the [[bacteria]] and plant roots in soils, where they improve gaseous circulation, or in coral reefs, where calcium carbonate is deposited as a solid on the sea floor. Calcium carbonate is used by living organisms to manufacture carbonaceous tests and shells. Once dead, the living organisms' shells fall to the bottom of the oceans where they generate deposits of chalk and limestone.

One of these organisms is ''[[Emiliania huxleyi]]'', an abundant [[coccolithophore]] [[algae]] which also has a role in the formation of [[cloud]]s.&lt;ref name="Harding2006"&gt;{{cite book |author=Harding, Stephan |title=Animate Earth |publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing |date=2006 |pages=65 |isbn=1-933392-29-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; excess is compensated by an increase of coccolithophoride life, increasing the amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; locked in the ocean floor. Coccolithophorides increase the cloud cover, hence control the surface temperature, help cool the whole planet and favor precipitations necessary for terrestrial plants.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Lately the atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration has increased and there is some evidence that concentrations of ocean [[algal bloom]]s are also increasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | date = 12 September 2007 | title = Interagency Report Says Harmful Algal Blooms Increasing | url = http://www.publicaffairs.noaa.gov/releases2007/sep07/noaa07-r435.html | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080209234239/http://www.publicaffairs.noaa.gov/releases2007/sep07/noaa07-r435.html | archivedate = 9 February 2008 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lichen]] and other organisms accelerate the [[weathering]] of rocks in the surface, while the decomposition of rocks also happens faster in the soil, thanks to the activity of roots, fungi, bacteria and subterranean animals. The flow of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to the soil is therefore regulated with the help of living beings. When CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels rise in the atmosphere the temperature increases and plants grow. This growth brings higher consumption of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by the plants, who process it into the soil, removing it from the atmosphere.

==History==

===Precedents===
[[File:NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise.jpg|thumb|''[[Earthrise]]'' taken from [[Apollo 8]] on December 24, 1968]]
The idea of the Earth as an integrated whole, a living being, has a long tradition. The [[Gaia (mythology)|mythical Gaia]] was the primal Greek goddess personifying the [[Earth]], the Greek version of "[[Mother Nature]]" (from Ge = Earth, and Aia = 
[[PIE]] grandmother), or the [[Earth Mother]]. James Lovelock gave this name to his hypothesis after a suggestion from the novelist [[William Golding]], who was living in the same village as Lovelock at the time ([[Bowerchalke]], [[Wiltshire]], UK). Golding's advice was based on Gea, an alternative spelling for the name of the Greek goddess, which is used as prefix in geology, geophysics and geochemistry.&lt;ref name=vanish09 /&gt; Golding later made reference to Gaia in his [[Nobel prize]] acceptance speech.

In the eighteenth century, as [[geology]] consolidated as a modern science, [[James Hutton]] maintained that geological and biological processes are interlinked.&lt;ref name=CapraWeb&gt;{{cite book |author=Capra, Fritjof |title=The web of life: a new scientific understanding of living systems |publisher=Anchor Books |location=Garden City, N.Y |date=1996 |page=23|isbn=0-385-47675-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the [[naturalist]] and explorer [[Alexander von Humboldt]] recognized the coevolution of living organisms, climate, and Earth's crust.&lt;ref name=CapraWeb /&gt; In the twentieth century, [[Vladimir Vernadsky]] formulated a theory of Earth's development that is now one of the foundations of ecology. Vernadsky was a Ukrainian [[geochemist]] and was one of the first scientists to recognize that the oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere result from biological processes. During the 1920s he published works arguing that living organisms could reshape the planet as surely as any physical force. Vernadsky was a pioneer of the scientific bases for the environmental sciences.&lt;ref&gt;S.R. Weart, 2003, ''The Discovery of Global Warming'', Cambridge, Harvard Press&lt;/ref&gt; His visionary pronouncements were not widely accepted in the West, and some decades later the Gaia hypothesis received the same type of initial resistance from the scientific community.

Also in the turn to the 20th century [[Aldo Leopold]], pioneer in the development of modern [[environmental ethics]] and in the movement for [[wilderness]] conservation, suggested a living Earth in his biocentric or holistic ethics regarding land.

And if we could see this whole, as a whole, through a great period of time, we might perceive not only organs with coordinated functions, but possibly also that process of consumption as replacement which in biology we call metabolism, or growth. In such case we would have all the visible attributes of a living thing, which we do not realize to be such because it is too big, and its life processes too slow.| Aldo Leopold | ''Animate Earth''.&lt;ref&gt;Harding, Stephan.

Another influence for the Gaia hypothesis and the [[environmental movement]] in general came as a side effect of the [[Space Race]] between the Soviet Union and the United States of America. During the 1960s, the first humans in space could see how the Earth looked as a whole. The photograph ''[[Earthrise]]'' taken by astronaut [[William Anders]] in 1968 during the [[Apollo 8]] mission became, through the [[Overview Effect]] an early symbol for the global ecology movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitaljournalist.org/issue0309/lm11.html 100 Photographs that Changed the World by Life - The Digital Journalist]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formulation of the hypothesis===
[[File:James Lovelock in 2005.jpg|thumb|[[James Lovelock]], 2005]]
Lovelock started defining the idea of a self-regulating Earth controlled by the community of living organisms in September 1965, while working at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] in California on methods of detecting [[life on Mars (planet)|life on Mars]].&lt;ref name="Lovelock1965"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lovelock, J.E. | date = 1965 | title = A physical basis for life detection experiments | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 207 | issue = 7 | pages = 568–570 | doi = 10.1038/207568a0 | pmid=5883628|bibcode = 1965Natur.207..568L | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jameslovelock.org/page4.html Geophysiology]&lt;/ref&gt;  The first paper to mention it was ''Planetary Atmospheres: Compositional and other Changes Associated with the Presence of Life'', co-authored with C.E. Giffin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Lovelock, J.E. | author2 = Giffin, C.E. | date = 1969 | title = Planetary Atmospheres: Compositional and other changes associated with the presence of Life | journal = Advances in the Astronautical Sciences | volume = 25 | pages = 179–193 | isbn = 0-87703-028-6 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; A main concept was that life could be detected in a planetary scale by the chemical composition of the atmosphere. According to the data gathered by the [[Pic du Midi de Bigorre|Pic du Midi observatory]], planets like Mars or Venus had atmospheres in [[chemical equilibrium]]. This difference with the Earth atmosphere was considered to be a proof that there was no life in these planets.

Lovelock formulated the ''Gaia Hypothesis'' in journal articles in 1972&lt;ref name="J1972"&gt;{{cite journal | author = J. E. Lovelock | title = Gaia as seen through the atmosphere | date = 1972 | journal = [[Atmospheric Environment]] | volume = 6 | issue = 8 | pages = 579–580 | doi = 10.1016/0004-6981(72)90076-5 | ref = harv|bibcode = 1972AtmEn...6..579L }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1974,&lt;ref name="lovelock1974" /&gt; followed by a popularizing 1979 book ''Gaia: A new look at life on Earth''. An article in the ''[[New Scientist]]'' of February 6, 1975,&lt;ref&gt;Lovelock, John and Sidney Epton, (February 8, 1975). "The quest for Gaia". [https://books.google.com/books?id=pnV6UYEkU4YC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false New Scientist], p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt; and a popular book length version of the hypothesis, published in 1979 as ''The Quest for Gaia'', began to attract scientific and critical attention.

Lovelock called it first the Earth feedback hypothesis,&lt;ref name="Lovelock01"&gt;{{harvnb|Lovelock, James|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was a way to explain the fact that combinations of chemicals including [[oxygen]] and [[methane]] persist in stable concentrations in the atmosphere of the Earth. Lovelock suggested detecting such combinations in other planets' atmospheres as a relatively reliable and cheap way to detect life.

[[File:Lynn Margulis.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lynn Margulis]]]]

Later, other relationships such as sea creatures producing sulfur and iodine in approximately the same quantities as required by land creatures emerged and helped bolster the hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1=W.D. | last1=Hamilton | first2=T.M. | last2=Lenton | title=Spora and Gaia: how microbes fly with their clouds | journal=Ethology Ecology &amp; Evolution | volume=10 | pages=1–16 | date=1998 | issue=1 | url=http://ejour-fup.unifi.it/index.php/eee/article/viewFile/787/733 | format=PDF | doi=10.1080/08927014.1998.9522867 | ref=harv | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723055017/http://ejour-fup.unifi.it/index.php/eee/article/viewFile/787/733 | archivedate=2011-07-23 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971 [[microbiologist]] Dr. [[Lynn Margulis]] joined Lovelock in the effort of fleshing out the initial hypothesis into scientifically proven concepts, contributing her knowledge about how microbes affect the atmosphere and the different layers in the surface of the planet.&lt;ref name="Turney, Jon 2003"&gt;{{cite book |author=Turney, Jon |title=Lovelock and Gaia: Signs of Life |publisher=Icon Books |location=UK |date=2003 |isbn=1-84046-458-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The American biologist had also awakened criticism from the scientific community with her theory on the origin of [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] [[organelle]]s and her contributions to the [[endosymbiotic theory]], nowadays accepted. Margulis dedicated the last of eight chapters in her book, ''The Symbiotic Planet'', to Gaia. However, she objected to the widespread personification of Gaia and stressed that Gaia is "not an organism", but "an emergent property of interaction among organisms". She defined Gaia as "the series of interacting ecosystems that compose a single huge ecosystem at the Earth's surface. Period". The book's most memorable "slogan" was actually quipped by a student of Margulis': "Gaia is just symbiosis as seen from space".

James Lovelock called his first proposal the ''Gaia hypothesis'' but has also used the term ''Gaia theory''. Lovelock states that the initial formulation was based on observation, but still lacked a scientific explanation. The Gaia hypothesis has since been supported by a number of scientific experiments&lt;ref name="J1990"&gt;{{cite journal | author = J. E. Lovelock | title = Hands up for the Gaia hypothesis | date = 1990 | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 344 | issue = 6262 | pages = 100–2 | doi = 10.1038/344100a0|bibcode = 1990Natur.344..100L | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and provided a number of useful predictions.&lt;ref name="Volk2003"&gt;{{cite book |author=Volk, Tyler |title=Gaia's Body: Toward a Physiology of Earth |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |date=2003 |isbn=0-262-72042-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, wider research proved the original hypothesis wrong, in the sense that it is not life alone but the whole Earth system that does the regulating.&lt;ref name="vanishing255"/&gt;

===First Gaia conference===
In 1985, the first public symposium on the Gaia hypothesis, ''Is The Earth A Living Organism?'' was held at [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], August 1–6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Joseph |first=Lawrence E. |title=Britain's Whole Earth Guru |work=The New York Times Magazine |date=November 23, 1986 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/23/magazine/britain-s-whole-earth-guru.html |accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principal sponsor was the [[National Audubon Society]]. Speakers included James Lovelock, [[George Wald]], [[Mary Catherine Bateson]], [[Lewis Thomas]], [[John Todd (Canadian biologist)|John Todd]], Donald Michael, [[Christopher Bird]], [[Thomas Berry]], [[David Abram]], [[Michael A. Cohen|Michael Cohen]], and William Fields. Some 500 people attended.&lt;ref&gt;Bunyard, Peter (1996), "Gaia in Action: Science of the Living Earth" (Floris Books)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second Gaia conference===
In 1988, [[climatology|climatologist]] [[Stephen Schneider]] organised a conference of the [[American Geophysical Union]]. The first Chapman Conference on Gaia,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; was held in San Diego, California on March 7, 1988.

During the "philosophical foundations" session of the conference, [[David Abram]] spoke on the influence of metaphor in science, and of the Gaia hypothesis as offering a new and potentially game-changing metaphorics, while [[James Kirchner]] criticised the Gaia hypothesis for its imprecision. Kirchner claimed that Lovelock and Margulis had not presented one Gaia hypothesis, but four -

* [[Coevolution|CoEvolutionary]] Gaia: that life and the environment had evolved in a coupled way. Kirchner claimed that this was already accepted scientifically and was not new.
* [[Homeostatic]] Gaia: that life maintained the stability of the natural environment, and that this stability enabled life to continue to exist.
* [[Geophysics|Geophysical]] Gaia: that the Gaia hypothesis generated interest in geophysical cycles and therefore led to interesting new research in terrestrial geophysical dynamics.
* Optimising Gaia: that Gaia shaped the planet in a way that made it an optimal environment for life as a whole. Kirchner claimed that this was not testable and therefore was not scientific.

Of Homeostatic Gaia, Kirchner recognised two alternatives. "Weak Gaia" asserted that life tends to make the environment stable for the flourishing of all life. "Strong Gaia" according to Kirchner, asserted that life tends to make the environment stable, ''to enable'' the flourishing of all life. Strong Gaia, Kirchner claimed, was untestable and therefore not scientific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | bibcode=1989RvGeo..27..223K | doi = 10.1029/RG027i002p00223 | title=The Gaia hypothesis: Can it be tested? | date=1989 | last1=Kirchner | first1=James W. | journal=Reviews of Geophysics | volume=27 | issue=2 | pages=223 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lovelock and other Gaia-supporting scientists, however, did attempt to disprove the claim that the hypothesis is not scientific because it is impossible to test it by controlled experiment. For example, against the charge that Gaia was teleological, Lovelock and Andrew Watson offered the [[Daisyworld]] Model (and its modifications, above) as evidence against most of these criticisms.&lt;ref name="daisyworld"/&gt;  Lovelock said that the Daisyworld model "demonstrates that self-regulation of the global environment can emerge from competition amongst types of life altering their local environment in different ways".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid=10968941 | date=2000 | last1=Lenton | first1=TM | last2=Lovelock | first2=JE | title=Daisyworld is Darwinian: Constraints on adaptation are important for planetary self-regulation | volume=206 | issue=1 | pages=109–14 | doi=10.1006/jtbi.2000.2105 | journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lovelock was careful to present a version of the Gaia hypothesis that had no claim that Gaia intentionally or consciously maintained the complex balance in her environment that life needed to survive. It would appear that the claim that Gaia acts "intentionally" was a metaphoric statement in his popular initial book and was not meant to be taken literally. This new statement of the Gaia hypothesis was more acceptable to the scientific community. Most accusations of [[teleology|teleologism]] ceased, following this conference.

===Third Gaia conference===
By the time of the 2nd Chapman Conference on the Gaia Hypothesis, held at Valencia, Spain, on 23 June 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Simón|first=Federico|title=GEOLOGÍA Enfoque multidisciplinar La hipótesis Gaia madura en Valencia con los últimos avances científicos|journal=El País|date=21 June 2000|url=http://elpais.com/diario/2000/06/21/futuro/961538404_850215.html|accessdate=1 December 2013|language=spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; the situation had changed significantly. Rather than a discussion of the Gaian teleological views, or "types" of Gaia hypotheses, the focus was upon the specific mechanisms by which basic short term homeostasis was maintained within a framework of significant evolutionary long term structural change.

The major questions were:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=General Information Chapman Conference on the Gaia Hypothesis University of Valencia Valencia, Spain June 19-23, 2000 (Monday through Friday) |url=http://www.agu.org/meetings/chapman/chapman_archive/cc00bcall.html |work=AGU Meetings |accessdate=7 January 2017 |author=American Geophysical Union }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# "How has the global biogeochemical/climate system called Gaia changed in time? What is its history? Can Gaia maintain stability of the system at one time scale but still undergo vectorial change at longer time scales? How can the geologic record be used to examine these questions?"
# "What is the structure of Gaia? Are the feedbacks sufficiently strong to influence the evolution of climate? Are there parts of the system determined pragmatically by whatever disciplinary study is being undertaken at any given time or are there a set of parts that should be taken as most true for understanding Gaia as containing evolving organisms over time? What are the feedbacks among these different parts of the Gaian system, and what does the near closure of matter mean for the structure of Gaia as a global ecosystem and for the productivity of life?"
# "How do models of Gaian processes and phenomena relate to reality and how do they help address and understand Gaia? How do results from Daisyworld transfer to the real world? What are the main candidates for "daisies"? Does it matter for Gaia theory whether we find daisies or not? How should we be searching for daisies, and should we intensify the search? How can Gaian mechanisms be investigated using process models or global models of the climate system that include the biota and allow for chemical cycling?"

In 1997, Tyler Volk argued that a Gaian system is almost inevitably produced as a result of an evolution towards far-from-equilibrium homeostatic states that maximise [[entropy]] production, and Kleidon (2004) agreed stating: "...homeostatic behavior can emerge from a state of MEP associated with the planetary albedo"; "...the resulting behavior of a biotic Earth at a state of MEP may well lead to near-homeostatic behavior of the Earth system on long time scales, as stated by the Gaia hypothesis". Staley (2002) has similarly proposed "...an alternative form of Gaia theory based on more traditional Darwinian principles... In [this] new approach, environmental regulation is a consequence of population dynamics, not Darwinian selection. The role of selection is to favor organisms that are best adapted to prevailing environmental conditions. However, the environment is not a static backdrop for evolution, but is heavily influenced by the presence of living organisms. The resulting co-evolving dynamical process eventually leads to the convergence of equilibrium and optimal conditions".

===Fourth Gaia conference===
A fourth international conference on the Gaia hypothesis, sponsored by the Northern Virginia Regional Park Authority and others, was held in October 2006 at the Arlington, VA campus of George Mason University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaia Theory Conference at George Mason University Law School|url=http://www.arlingtonva.us/departments/Communications/PressReleases/page7530.aspx|accessdate=1 December 2013|author=Official Site of Arlington County Virginia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin Ogle, Chief Naturalist, for NVRPA, and long-time Gaia hypothesis proponent, organized the event.  Lynn Margulis, Distinguished University Professor in the Department of Geosciences, University of Massachusetts-Amherst, and long-time advocate of the Gaia hypothesis, was a keynote speaker. Among many other speakers: Tyler Volk, Co-director of the Program in Earth and Environmental Science at New York University; Dr. Donald Aitken, Principal of Donald Aitken Associates; Dr. Thomas Lovejoy, President of the Heinz Center for Science, Economics and the Environment; Robert Correll, Senior Fellow, Atmospheric Policy Program, American Meteorological Society and noted environmental ethicist, J. Baird Callicott.

This conference approached the Gaia hypothesis as both science and metaphor as a means of understanding how we might begin addressing 21st century issues such as climate change and ongoing environmental destruction.

==Criticism==
After initially being largely ignored by most scientists (from 1969 until 1977), thereafter for a period the initial Gaia hypothesis was criticized by a number of scientists, such as [[Ford Doolittle]],&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doolittle|first=W. F.|year=1981|title=Is Nature Really Motherly|url=|journal=The Coevolution Quarterly|volume=Spring|pages=58–63|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Dawkins]]&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Extended Phenotype: the Long Reach of the Gene|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1982|isbn=0-19-286088-7|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Stephen Jay Gould]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Turney, Jon. "Lovelock and Gaia: Signs of Life" (Revolutions in Science)&lt;/ref&gt; Lovelock has said that because his hypothesis is named after a Greek goddess, and championed by many non-scientists,&lt;ref name="Lovelock01"/&gt; the Gaia hypothesis was interpreted as a [[neo-Pagan]] [[religion]]. Many scientists in particular also criticised the approach taken in his popular book ''Gaia, a New Look at Life on Earth'' for being [[teleology|teleological]]—a belief that things are purposeful and aimed towards a goal. Responding to this critique in 1990, Lovelock stated, "Nowhere in our writings do we express the idea that planetary self-regulation is purposeful, or involves foresight or planning by the [[biota (ecology)|biota]]".

[[Stephen Jay Gould]] criticised Gaia as being "a metaphor, not a mechanism."&lt;ref name="Gould 1997"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gould S.J. |title=Kropotkin was no crackpot |journal=Natural History |volume=106 |pages=12–21 |date=June 1997  |url=http://libcom.org/library/kropotkin-was-no-crackpot |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wanted to know the actual mechanisms by which self-regulating homeostasis was achieved. In his defense of Gaia, David Abram argues that Gould overlooked the fact that "mechanism", itself, is a metaphor — albeit an exceedingly common and often unrecognized metaphor — one which leads us to consider natural and living systems as though they were machines organized and built from outside (rather than as [[autopoiesis|autopoietic]] or self-organizing phenomena). Mechanical metaphors, according to Abram, lead us to overlook the active or agential quality of living entities, while the organismic metaphorics of the Gaia hypothesis accentuate the active agency of both the biota and the biosphere as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Abram, D. (1988) "The Mechanical and the Organic: On the Impact of Metaphor in Science" in Scientists on Gaia, edited by Stephen Schneider and Penelope Boston, Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildethics.org/essays/the_mechanical_and_the_organic.html |title=The Mechanical and the Organic |accessdate=August 27, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223165936/http://www.wildethics.org/essays/the_mechanical_and_the_organic.html |archivedate=February 23, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to causality in Gaia, Lovelock argues that no single mechanism is responsible, that the connections between the various known mechanisms may never be known, that this is accepted in other fields of biology and ecology as a matter of course, and that specific hostility is reserved for his own hypothesis for other reasons.&lt;ref name="Lovelock, James 2001"&gt;Lovelock, James (2001), ''Homage to Gaia: The Life of an Independent Scientist'' (Oxford University Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from clarifying his language and understanding of what is meant by a life form, Lovelock himself ascribes most of the criticism to a lack of understanding of non-linear mathematics by his critics, and a linearizing form of [[greedy reductionism]] in which all events have to be immediately ascribed to specific causes before the fact. He also states that most of his critics are biologists but that his hypothesis includes experiments in fields outside biology, and that some self-regulating phenomena may not be mathematically explainable.&lt;ref name="Lovelock, James 2001"/&gt;

===Natural selection and evolution===
Lovelock has suggested that global biological feedback mechanisms could evolve by [[natural selection]], stating that organisms that improve their environment for their survival do better than those that damage their environment. However, in the early 1980s, [[Ford Doolittle|W. Ford Doolittle]] and [[Richard Dawkins]] separately argued against Gaia. Doolittle argued that nothing in the [[genome]] of individual organisms could provide the feedback mechanisms proposed by Lovelock, and therefore the Gaia hypothesis proposed no plausible mechanism and was unscientific.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Dawkins meanwhile stated that for organisms to act in concert would require foresight and planning, which is contrary to the current scientific understanding of evolution.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Like Doolittle, he also rejected the possibility that feedback loops could stabilize the system.

[[Lynn Margulis]], a microbiologist who collaborated with Lovelock in supporting the Gaia hypothesis, argued in 1999, that "[[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s grand vision was not wrong, only incomplete. In accentuating the direct competition between individuals for resources as the primary selection mechanism, Darwin (and especially his followers) created the impression that the environment was simply a static arena". She wrote that the composition of the Earth's atmosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere are regulated around "set points" as in [[homeostasis]], but those set points change with time.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Margulis, Lynn. Symbiotic Planet: A New Look At Evolution. Houston: Basic Book 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolutionary biologist [[W. D. Hamilton]] called the concept of Gaia [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernican]], adding that it would take another [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] to explain how Gaian self-regulation takes place through Darwinian [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name=vanish09&gt;Lovelock, James.

===Criticism in the 21st century===
The Gaia hypothesis continues to be broadly skeptically received by the scientific community. For instance, arguments both for and against it were laid out in the journal ''Climatic Change'' in 2002 and 2003. A significant argument raised against it are the many examples where life has had a detrimental or destabilising effect on the environment rather than acting to regulate it.&lt;ref name="kirchner2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="volk2002"/&gt; Several recent books have criticised the Gaia hypothesis, expressing views ranging from "... the Gaia hypothesis lacks unambiguous observational support and has significant theoretical difficulties"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Waltham |first=David |authorlink=David Waltham |date=2014|title=Lucky Planet: Why Earth is Exceptional – and What that Means for Life in the Universe |url=http://www.iconbooks.com/blog/title/lucky-planet/ |location= |publisher=Icon Books |page= |isbn=9781848316560 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to "Suspended uncomfortably between tainted metaphor, fact, and false science, I prefer to leave Gaia firmly in the background"&lt;ref name="beerling2007"/&gt; to "The Gaia hypothesis is supported neither by evolutionary theory nor by the empirical evidence of the geological record".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cockell |first1=Charles |authorlink1=Charles Cockell |last2=Corfield |first2=Richard |last3=Dise |first3= Nancy  |last4=Edwards |first4=Neil  |last5=Harris |first5=Nigel  |date=2008 |title= An Introduction to the Earth-Life System |url= http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/earth-and-environmental-science/palaeontology-and-life-history/introduction-earth-life-system |location=Cambridge (UK) |publisher= Cambridge University Press |page= |isbn= 9780521729536 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[CLAW hypothesis]],&lt;ref name="CLAW87" /&gt; initially suggested as a potential example of direct Gaian feedback, has subsequently been found to be less credible as understanding of [[cloud condensation nuclei]] has improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1= Quinn |first1=P.K. |last2= Bates |first2=T.S. |title =The case against climate regulation via oceanic phytoplankton sulphur emissions |journal =Nature |volume=480 |pages =51–56 |date = 2011 |doi=10.1038/nature10580|bibcode = 2011Natur.480...51Q |pmid=22129724}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 the [[Medea hypothesis]] was proposed: that life has highly detrimental (biocidal) impacts on planetary conditions, in direct opposition to the Gaia hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Ward (2009), ''The Medea Hypothesis: Is Life on Earth Ultimately Self-Destructive?'', {{ISBN|0-691-13075-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a recent book-length evaluation of the Gaia hypothesis considering modern evidence from across the various relevant disciplines the author, Toby Tyrrell, concluded that: "I believe Gaia is a dead end. Its study has, however, generated many new and thought provoking questions. While rejecting Gaia, we can at the same time appreciate Lovelock's originality and breadth of vision, and recognise that his audacious concept has helped to stimulate many new ideas about the Earth, and to champion a holistic approach to studying it".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Tyrrell |first=Toby |authorlink= |date= 2013|title= On Gaia: A Critical Investigation of the Relationship between Life and Earth |url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9959.html |location=Princeton |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=209 |isbn=9780691121581 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere he presents his conclusion "The Gaia hypothesis is not an accurate picture of how our world works".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Tyrrell |first = Toby |title =Gaia: the verdict is… |journal = New Scientist |volume = 220 |pages = 30–31 |date= 26 October 2013 |doi=10.1016/s0262-4079(13)62532-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statement needs to be understood as referring to the "strong" and "moderate" forms of Gaia—that the biota obeys a principle that works to make Earth optimal (strength 5) or favourable for life (strength 4) or that it works as a homeostatic mechanism (strength 3). The latter is the "weakest" form of Gaia that Lovelock has advocated. Tyrrell rejects it. However, he finds that the two weaker forms of Gaia—Coeveolutionary Gaia and Influential Gaia, which assert that there are close links between the evolution of life and the environment and that biology affects the physical and chemical environment—are both credible, but that it is not useful to use the term "Gaia" in this sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Tyrrell |first=Toby |authorlink= |date= 2013|title= On Gaia: A Critical Investigation of the Relationship between Life and Earth |url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9959.html |location=Princeton |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=208 |isbn=9780691121581 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6148">'''Globe Award''' is an international [[sustainability]] award which aims at encouraging and promoting the corporate and public sector, individual scientists as well as groups of innovator that have excelled in sustainable development in the world. Globe Award is a not-for-profit organisation with focuses on fostering sustainability in societies. Globe Award’s main goal boils down to inspire actors to take responsibility and act globally through awarding great cases within research, innovations, municipalities and companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globeaward.org/ |title=Home |publisher=Globe Award |date= |accessdate=2012-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The award is handed out in 4 categories: ''Sustainability Research, Sustainability Innovation, Sustainable City'' and ''Sustainability Reporting''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globeaward.org/globe_award_2011 |title=2011 |publisher=Globe Award |date= |accessdate=2012-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Globe Award values==

1. ''Sustainable development''

Driving sustainability by recognising and awarding sustainability champions from around the world is crucial. This is about understanding the consequences of nowadays’s activities and believing in global collaboration to reach solutions to safeguard humanity’s welfare today and in the future.

2. ''Impact''

It is significant to create behavioural change through rewording unique solutions that can be implemented in order to make a change.

3. ''Transparency''

The Globe Award jury groups run the selection process equally independently.

4. ''Innovation''

Honouring tomorrow's leaders develops innovative solutions to the world’s sustainability challenges. Innovative business perspectives are considered as well as people, planet and profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globeaward.org/about-globe-award |title=About |publisher=Globe Award |date= |accessdate=2012-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The noted and internationally recognized 4 groups of jury consist of experts in sustainability from all over the world. They select one winner in each category independently and on objective grounds. There is the over-all jury chairman who along with the Globe Award secretariat, keeps that the process and selection of applications is obeyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globeaward.org/jury |title=Jury 2011 |publisher=Globe Award |date= |accessdate=2012-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Globe Award is an initiative by Globe Forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globeforum.com/ |title=Start2011 |publisher=GlobeForum |date= |accessdate=2012-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

When started in 2007, Globe Award was a Swedish CSR Award. After two years of success in Sweden, Globe Forum decided to go further with Globe Award. Struggling in making a difference and increasing awareness towards sustainable development in all societies, it made sense in creating Globe Award a truly global prize focusing on sustainability, instead of CSR, starting from 2009.
The award ceremony takes place annually in [[Stockholm]]. The initiative is supported by H.R.H. [[Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden]].
Despite the world-wide edition, there was a national edition in [[Poland]]. It took place in Gdansk in 2009. The Globe Award Polish Edition was handed out in two categories: Sustainability Innovation and Sustainable City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globeaward.org/polish_edition/en/about.html |title=About |publisher=Globe Award |date= |accessdate=2012-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- USE POSSESSIVE HITCHENS'S IT IS ONE BRITISH VERSION SEE [[MOS:POSS]]#1. --&gt;
'''Hitchens's razor''' is an [[Epistemology|epistemological]] [[Razor (philosophy)|razor]] asserting that the [[Philosophical burden of proof|burden of proof]] regarding the truthfulness of a claim lies with the one who makes the claim, and if this burden is not met, the claim is unfounded, and its opponents need not argue further in order to dismiss it.

==Overview==
The concept is named, echoing [[Occam's razor]], for the journalist and writer [[Christopher Hitchens]], who in a 2003 ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' article formulated it thus: "'''What can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence'''".&lt;ref name=Slate&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2003/10/mommie_dearest.html|title=Mommie Dearest|first=Christopher|last=Hitchens|authorlink=christopher hitchens|work=Slate|date=20 October 2003|accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Cillian|last=McGrattan|title=The Politics of Trauma and Peace-Building: Lessons from Northern Ireland|location=Abingdon|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|page=2|isbn=978-1138775183}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dictum also appears in ''[[God Is Not Great|God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything]]'', a book by Hitchens published in 2007.&lt;ref name=God&gt;{{cite book|first=Christopher|last=Hitchens|authorlink=Christopher Hitchens|title=God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything|year=2007|page=150|publisher=Twelve Books|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1843545743}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitchens's razor is actually an English translation of the Latin proverb ''[[:q:en:Latin proverbs#Q|quod grātīs asseritur, grātīs negātur]]'' ("What is freely asserted is freely dismissed"), which was commonly used in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=SkepticInk&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.skepticink.com/backgroundprobability/2015/07/25/the-long-history-of-hitchens-razor|title=The Long History of Hitchens' Razor|first=Damion|last=Reinhardt|work=Skeptic Ink|date=25 July 2015|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Jon R. Stone}}, ''The Routledge Dictionary of Latin Quotations'' (2005), p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; It takes a stronger stance than the [[Sagan standard]] ("Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence"), instead applying to even non-extraordinary claims.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10083">[[File:MorinSurfaceAsSphere'sInsideVersusOutside.PNG|thumb|The homotopy principle generalizes such results as Smale's proof of [[sphere eversion]].]]

In [[mathematics]], the '''homotopy principle''' (or '''h-principle''') is a very general way to solve [[partial differential equation]]s (PDEs), and more generally [[partial differential relation]]s (PDRs).  The h-principle is good for [[underdetermined system|underdetermined]] PDEs or PDRs, such as occur in the [[immersion problem]], [[isometric immersion problem]], fluid dynamics, and other areas.

The theory was started by [[Yakov Eliashberg]], [[Mikhail Gromov (mathematician)|Mikhail Gromov]] and [[Anthony V. Phillips]]. It was based on earlier results that reduced partial differential relations to [[homotopy]], particularly for immersions. The first evidence of h-principle appeared in the [[Whitney–Graustein theorem]]. This was followed by the Nash-Kuiper Isometric &lt;math&gt;C^1&lt;/math&gt; embedding theorem and the Smale-Hirsch Immersion theorem.

==Rough idea==

Assume we want to find a function ''&amp;fnof;'' on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; which satisfies a partial differential equation of degree ''k'', in co-ordinates &lt;math&gt;(u_1,u_2,\dots,u_m)&lt;/math&gt;. One can rewrite it as

:&lt;math&gt;\Psi(u_1,u_2,\dots,u_m, J^k_f)=0&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;J^k_f&lt;/math&gt; stands for all partial derivatives of ''&amp;fnof;'' up to order&amp;nbsp;''k''. Let us exchange every variable in &lt;math&gt;J^k_f&lt;/math&gt; for new independent variables &lt;math&gt;y_1,y_2,\dots,y_N.&lt;/math&gt;
Then our original equation can be thought as a system of

:&lt;math&gt;\Psi^{}_{}(u_1,u_2,\dots,u_m,y_1,y_2,\dots,y_N)=0&lt;/math&gt;

and some number of equations of the following type 
:&lt;math&gt;y_j={\partial^k f\over \partial u_{j_1}\ldots\partial u_{j_k}}.&lt;/math&gt;

A solution of

:&lt;math&gt;\Psi^{}_{}(u_1,u_2,\dots,u_m,y_1,y_2,\dots,y_N)=0&lt;/math&gt;

is called a '''non-holonomic solution''', and a solution of the system (which is a solution of our original PDE) is called a '''holonomic solution'''.

In order to check whether a solution exists, first check if there is a non-holonomic solution (usually it is quite easy and if not then our original equation did not have any solutions).

A PDE ''satisfies the h-principle'' if any non-holonomic solution can be [[homotopy|deformed]] into a holonomic one in the class of non-holonomic solutions. Thus in the presence of h-principle, a differential topological problem reduces to an algebraic topological problem. More explicitly this means that apart from the topological obstruction there is no other obstruction to the existence of a holonomic solution. The topological problem of finding a ''non-holonomic solution'' is much easier to handle and can be addressed with the obstruction theory for topological bundles.

Many underdetermined partial differential equations satisfy the h-principle. However, the falsity of an h-principle is also an interesting statement, intuitively this means the objects being studied have non-trivial geometry that cannot be reduced to topology. As an example, embedded [[Lagrangian submanifold|Lagrangians]] in a symplectic manifold do not satisfy an h-principle, to prove this one needs to find invariants coming from [[Pseudoholomorphic curve|pseudo-holomorphic curves]].

== Simple examples ==

=== Monotone functions ===
Perhaps the simplest partial differential relation is for the derivative to not vanish: &lt;math&gt;f'(x) \neq 0.&lt;/math&gt; Properly, this is an ''ordinary'' differential relation, as this is a function in one variable. 

A holonomic solution to this relation is a function whose derivative is nowhere vanishing.  I.e., a strictly monotone differentiable functions, either increasing or decreasing.  The space of such functions consists of two disjoint [[convex set]]s: the increasing ones and the decreasing ones, and has the homotopy type of two points.

A non-holonomic solution to this relation would consist in the data of two functions, a differentiable function f(x), and a continuous function g(x), with g(x) nowhere vanishing.  A holonomic solution gives rise to a non-holonomic solution by taking g(x) = f'(x).  The space of non-holonomic solutions again consists of two disjoint convex sets, according as g(x) is positive or negative.  

Thus the inclusion of holonomic into non-holonomic solutions satisfies the h-principle. 

[[File:Winding Number Around Point.svg|thumb|The [[Whitney–Graustein theorem]] shows that immersions of the circle in the plane satisfy an h-principle, expressed by [[turning number]].]]
This trivial example has nontrivial generalizations:
extending this to immersions of a circle into itself classifies them by order (or [[winding number]]), by lifting the map to the [[universal covering space]] and applying the above analysis to the resulting monotone map – the linear map corresponds to multiplying angle: &lt;math&gt;\theta \mapsto n\theta&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;z \mapsto z^n&lt;/math&gt; in complex numbers). Note that here there are no immersions of order 0, as those would need to turn back on themselves. Extending this to circles immersed in the plane – the immersion condition is precisely the condition that the derivative does not vanish – the [[Whitney–Graustein theorem]] classified these by [[turning number]] by considering the homotopy class of the [[Gauss map]] and showing that this satisfies an h-principle; here again order 0 is more complicated.

Smale's classification of immersions of spheres as the homotopy groups of [[Stiefel manifold]]s, and Hirsch's generalization of this to immersions of manifolds being classified as homotopy classes of maps of [[frame bundle]]s are much further-reaching generalizations, and much more involved, but similar in principle – immersion requires the derivative to have rank ''k,'' which requires the partial derivatives in each direction to not vanish and to be linearly independent, and the resulting analog of the Gauss map is a map to the Stiefel manifold, or more generally between frame bundles.

=== A car in the plane ===
As another simple example, consider a car moving in the plane. The position of a car in the plane is determined by three parameters: two coordinates &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; for the location (a good choice is the location of the midpoint between the back wheels) and an angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; which describes the orientation of the car. The motion of the car satisfies the equation

:&lt;math&gt;\dot x \sin\alpha=\dot y\cos \alpha.&lt;/math&gt;
since a non-skidding car must move in the direction of its wheels. In [[robotics]] terms, not all paths in the task space are [[holonomic (robotics)|holonomic]].

A non-holonomic solution in this case, roughly speaking, corresponds to a motion of the car by sliding in the plane. In this case the non-holonomic solutions are not only [[homotopic]] to holonomic ones but also can be arbitrarily well approximated by the holonomic ones (by going back and forth, like parallel parking in a limited space) – note that this approximates both the position and the angle of the car arbitrarily closely. This implies that, theoretically, it is possible to parallel park in any space longer than the length of your car. It also implies that, in a contact 3 manifold, any curve is &lt;math&gt;C^0&lt;/math&gt;-close to a [[Legendrian knot|Legendrian]] curve.
This last property is stronger than the general h-principle; it is called the &lt;math&gt;C^0&lt;/math&gt;-'''dense h-principle'''.

While this example is simple, compare to the [[Nash embedding theorem]], specifically the [[Nash–Kuiper theorem]], which says that any [[short map|short]] smooth (&lt;math&gt;C^\infty&lt;/math&gt;) embedding or immersion of &lt;math&gt;M^m&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^{m+1}&lt;/math&gt; or larger can be arbitrarily well approximated by an isometric &lt;math&gt;C^1&lt;/math&gt;-embedding (respectively, immersion). This is also a dense h-principle, and can be proven by an essentially similar "wrinkling" – or rather, circling – technique to the car in the plane, though it is much more involved.

==Ways to prove the h-principle==
*[[Removal of Singularities]] technique developed by Gromov and Eliashberg
*[[Sheaf technique]] based on the work of Smale and Hirsch.
*[[Convex integration]] based on the work of Nash and Kuiper

==Some paradoxes==

Here we list a few counter-intuitive results which can be proved by applying the 
h-principle:

*'''Cone Eversion'''.&lt;ref&gt;D. Fuchs, S. Tabachnikov, ''Mathematical Omnibus: Thirty Lectures on Classic Mathematics''&lt;/ref&gt; Let us consider functions ''f'' on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; without origin ''f''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;|''x''|. Then there is a continuous one-parameter family of functions &lt;math&gt;f_t&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f_0=f&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f_1=-f&lt;/math&gt; and for any &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{grad}(f_t)&lt;/math&gt; is not zero at any point.
*Any open manifold admits a (non-complete) Riemannian metric of positive (or negative) curvature.
*[[Sphere eversion]] without creasing or tearing can be done using &lt;math&gt;C^1&lt;/math&gt; isometric embedding of &lt;math&gt;S^2&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3115">The '''Hopf maximum principle''' is a [[maximum principle]] in the theory of second order [[elliptic partial differential equation]]s and has been described as the "classic and bedrock result" of that theory. Generalizing the maximum principle for [[harmonic function]]s which was already known to [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] in 1839, [[Eberhard Hopf]] proved in 1927 that if a function satisfies a second order partial differential inequality of a certain kind in a domain of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; and attains a [[maximum]] in the domain then the function is constant. The simple idea behind Hopf's proof, the comparison technique he introduced for this purpose, has led to an enormous range of important applications and generalizations.

== Mathematical formulation ==

Let ''u'' = ''u''(''x''), ''x'' = (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;hellip;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) be a ''C''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; function which satisfies the differential inequality

: &lt;math&gt; Lu = \sum_{ij} a_{ij}(x)\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x_i\partial x_j} + 
\sum_i b_i(x)\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_i} \geq 0 &lt;/math&gt;

in an [[open set|open domain]] (connected open subset of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) &amp;Omega;, where the [[symmetric matrix]] ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''ji''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') is locally uniformly [[positive definite matrix|positive definite]] in &amp;Omega; and the coefficients ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;  are locally [[Bounded set|bounded]]. If ''u'' takes a maximum value ''M'' in &amp;Omega; then ''u'' &amp;equiv; ''M''.

The coefficients ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;  are just functions. If they are known to be continuous then it is sufficient to demand pointwise positive definiteness of ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; on the domain.

It is usually thought that the Hopf maximum principle applies only to [[linear differential operator]]s ''L''. In particular, this is the point of view taken by [[Richard Courant|Courant]] and [[David Hilbert|Hilbert's]] ''[[Methoden der mathematischen Physik]]''. In the later sections of his original paper, however, Hopf considered a more general situation which permits certain nonlinear operators ''L'' and, in some cases, leads to uniqueness statements in the [[Dirichlet problem]] for the [[mean curvature]] operator and the [[Monge–Ampère equation]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9825">'''Hyperfocus''' is an intense form of [[mind|mental]] [[attention|concentration]] or [[creative visualization|visualization]] that focuses [[consciousness]] on a subject, topic, or task.  In some individuals, various subjects or topics may also include [[daydream]]s, [[concept]]s, [[fiction]], the [[imagination]], and other [[object of the mind|objects of the mind]]. Hyperfocus on a certain subject can cause side-tracking away from  assigned or important tasks.

Hyperfocus may bear a relationship to the concept of [[Flow (psychology)|flow]].&lt;ref name="webb"&gt;{{citation |first1=James T. |last1=Webb |first2=Edward R. |last2=Amend |first3=Nadia E. |last3=Webb |first4=Jean |last4=Goerss |first5=Paul |last5=Beljan |first6=F.

In gifted children without ADD/ADHD, this rapt and productive attention state is described by Csikszentmihalyi (1990) as ‘flow.’ … What has been coined ‘hyperfocus’ in persons with ADD/ADHD seems to be a less medical-sounding description of perseveration. Thus the apparent ability to concentrate in certain limited situations does not exclude the diagnosis of ADD/ADHD. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some circumstances, both flow and hyperfocus can be an aid to achievement, but in other circumstances or situations, the same focus and behavior could be a liability, distracting from the task at hand. However, unlike hyperfocus, "flow" is often described in more glowing terms, suggesting they are not two sides of the same condition under contrasting circumstance or intellect.

== Confusion with perseveration (as a clinical symptom) ==

Hyperfocus may in some cases also be symptomatic of a [[Psychiatry|psychiatric]] condition. In these cases, it is more commonly and accurately&lt;ref name="webb" /&gt; referred to as [[perseveration]]—an inability or impairment in switching tasks or activities ("[[Task switching (psychology)|set-shifting]]"),&lt;ref name="priory"&gt;[http://priory.com/gloss.htm#perseveration Priory psychiatric glossary]&lt;/ref&gt; or desisting from mental or physical response repetition (gestures, words, thoughts) despite absence or cessation of a [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]],&lt;ref name="Dict Bio Psych"&gt;{{Citation | contribution=Perseveration | year=2001 | title=Dictionary of Biological Psychology | editor-last=Winn | editor-first=Philip | page=595 | isbn=9780415136068 | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | contribution-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UbL2MZ9xI7oC&amp;pg=PA595#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Helm-Estabrooks"&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Helm-Estabrooks N |title=The problem of perseveration |journal=Semin Speech Lang |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=289–90 |year=2004 |pmid=15599818 |doi=10.1055/s-2004-837241 |url=http://www.thieme-connect.com/ejournals/html/ssl/doi/10.1055/s-2004-837241 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PC def"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychcentral.com/encyclopedia/2008/perseveration/ |website=Psych Central |title=Perseveration |last=Grinnell |first=Renée |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Di def"&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/perseveration Dictionary.com definition]&lt;/ref&gt; and which is not excessive in terms of quantity but are apparently both functionless and involve a narrow range of behaviours, and are not better described as [[stereotypy]] (a highly repetitive [[idiosyncrasy|idiosyncratic]] behaviour).

Conditions associated with perseveration include neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly those considered to be on the [[autism spectrum]] (especially [[Asperger syndrome]]), and [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD). In the latter, it is informally but probably incorrectly called "hyperfocus"&lt;ref name="webb" /&gt; and may be a coping mechanism or a symptom of self-regulation impairment—as well as people who are  [[twice exceptional|both intellectually gifted and suffer a learning disability]] who may have either or both of hyperfocus and perseverative behaviours.&lt;ref name="webb" /&gt;  Other conditions involving dysfunction or disregulation within the frontal lobe could also theoretically have similar effects.

It is typical for individuals with [[ADHD]] to say they 1), cannot focus on boring things and 2), can only focus on stimulating things,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goodin|first1=Kate|title=Famous People with ADHD|url=http://www.parenting.com/gallery/famous-people-with-add-or-adhd?page=16|website=Parenting|publisher=Meredith Corporation|accessdate=2013-08-22|quote=David Neeleman, Founder of JetBlue Airways … reported in an interview with ADDitude magazine his ADHD prevents him from being detail-oriented and completing doing day-to-day tasks, saying, ‘I have an easier time planning a 20-aircraft fleet than I do paying the light bill.’}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''that focus is often extreme''. Thus, it is both a concentration deficit and over-concentration, or generically: "hyperfocus." More concisely, some types of ADHD are a difficulty in ''directing'' one's attention, (an [[executive function]] of the [[frontal lobe]]), ''not'' a lack of attention.&lt;ref&gt;2012 Burnett Lecture [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUQu-OPrzUc Video, Part 1 of 3, Keynote Speaker: Russell A. Barkley], Ph.D. by UNCCHLearningCenter, retrieved Aug 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;2012 Burnett Lecture, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZpF2_IelWo Video, Part 2 of 3, ADHD, Self-Regulation and Executive Functioning Theory], by UNCCHLearningCenter&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;2012 Burnett Lecture [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_hHNTDdgIU Video, Part 3 of 3, Q &amp; A Dr. Russell Barkley] by UNCCHLearningCenter  - Streamed live on Nov 1, 2012 Sponsored by the Academic Success Program for Students with LD and ADHD — a UNC-Chapel Hill Learning Center Program in the College of Arts and Sciences — and the UNC General Alumni&lt;/ref&gt; Glickman &amp; Dodd (1998)&lt;ref&gt;Glickman, M. M. &amp; Dodd, D. K. (1998).  GUTI: A measure of urgent task involvement among adults with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.  Psychological Reports, 82, 592-594.&lt;/ref&gt; found that adults with self-reported ADHD scored higher than normal adults on self-reported ability to hyperfocus on "urgent tasks" such as last-minute projects or preparations. Adults in the ADHD group were uniquely able to postpone eating, sleeping and other personal needs and stay absorbed in the "urgent task" for an extended time.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

Clinical conditions unlikely to be confused with hyperfocus often involve repetition of thoughts or behaviors such as [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] (OCD), [[PTSD|trauma]],&lt;ref name="differential"&gt;{{cite web |first=James Robert |last=Brasic |title=Pediatric Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Differential Diagnoses |date=9 July 2012 |website=Medscape Reference |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1826591-differential}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some cases of [[traumatic brain injuries|traumatic brain injury]].&lt;ref name="priory" /&gt;

== Information types ==
Various types of personal information often come under privacy concerns.

=== Internet ===
{{Main|Internet privacy}}

The ability to control the information one reveals about oneself over the internet, and who can access that information, has become a growing concern. These concerns include whether [[email]] can be stored or read by third parties without consent, or whether third parties can continue to track the websites that someone has visited. Another concern is if the websites that are visited can collect, store, and possibly share [[personally identifiable information]] about users.

The advent of various [[Web search engine|search engines]] and the use of [[data mining]] created a capability for data about individuals to be collected and combined from a wide variety of sources very easily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/surveillance/2006-06-18-data-mining-privacy_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=Research explores data mining, privacy | date=2006-06-18 | accessdate=2010-05-05 | first=Brian | last=Bergstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.seattlepi.com/business/154986_privacychallenge02.html | work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer | first=Brian | last=Bergstein | title=In this data-mining society, privacy advocates shudder | date=2004-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/21472572/u-s-demands-google-web-data | work=Information Management Journal | title=U.S. Demands Google Web Data | year=2006 | first=Nikki | last=Swartz }} Vol. 40 Issue 3, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; The FTC has provided a set of guidelines that represent widely accepted concepts concerning fair information practices in an electronic marketplace called the [[Fair Information Practice Principles]].

In order not to give away too much personal information, emails should be encrypted. Browsing of web pages as well as other online activities should be done trace-less via "anonymizers", in case those are not trusted, by open-source distributed anonymizers, so called [[mix net]]s, such as [[I2P]] or [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor – The Onion Router]].

Email isn't the only internet content with privacy concerns. In an age where increasing amounts of information are going online, social networking sites pose additional privacy challenges. People may be tagged in photos or have valuable information exposed about themselves either by choice or unexpectedly by others. Caution should be exercised with what information is being posted, as social networks vary in what they allow users to make private and what remains publicly accessible.&lt;ref name="SchneiderTheInter08"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E1fQdrzxAPoC&amp;pg=PA17-IA137 |title=The Internet: Illustrated Series |author=Schneider, G.; Evans, J.; Pinard, K.T. |publisher=Cengage Learning |page=156 |year=2008 |isbn=9781423999386 |accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without strong security settings in place and careful attention to what remains public, a person can be profiled by searching for and collecting disparate pieces of information, worst case leading to cases of [[cyberstalking]]&lt;ref name="BocijCyber04"&gt;{{cite book |title=Cyberstalking: Harassment in the Internet Age and How to Protect Your Family |author=Bocij, P. |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |pages=268 |year=2004 |isbn=9780275981181}}&lt;/ref&gt; or reputational damage.&lt;ref name="CannataciPrivacy16"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tGC_DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA26 |title=Privacy, free expression and transparency: Redefining their new boundaries in the digital age |author=Cannataci, J.A.; Zhao, B.; Vives, G.T. et al. |publisher=UNESCO |page=26 |year=2016 |isbn=9789231001888 |accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cable television ===
This describes the ability to control what information one reveals about oneself over cable television, and who can access that information. For example, third parties can track IP TV programs someone has watched at any given time. "The addition of any information in a broadcasting stream is not required for an audience rating survey, additional devices are not requested to be installed in the houses of viewers or listeners, and without the necessity of their cooperations, audience ratings can be automatically performed in real-time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/y2010/0011389.html | work=FreePatentsOnline.com | title=System for Gathering TV Audience Rating in Real Time in Internet Protocol Television Network and Method Thereof| date=2010-01-14 | accessdate=2011-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medical ===
{{Main|Medical privacy}}

People may not wish for their medical records to be revealed to others. This may be because they have concern that it might affect their insurance coverages or employment. Or, it may be because they would not wish for others to know about any medical or psychological conditions or treatments that would bring embarrassment upon themselves. Revealing medical data could also reveal other details about one's personal life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://aisel.aisnet.org/amcis2011_submissions/341/|title=The Economic Effect of Privacy Breach Announcements on Stocks: A Comprehensive Empirical Investigation|first1=Nicholas-Donald,|last1=Aurelia|first2=Matus, Jesus|last2=Francisco|first3=Ryu,|last3=SeungEui|first4=Mahmood, Adam|last4=M|date=1 June 2017|website=aisnet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are three major categories of medical privacy: informational (the degree of control over personal information), physical (the degree of physical inaccessibility to others), and psychological (the extent to which the doctor respects patients’ cultural beliefs, inner thoughts, values, feelings, and religious practices and allows them to make personal decisions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Serenko|first=Natalia|author2=Lida Fan|title=Patients’ Perceptions of Privacy and Their Outcomes in Healthcare|journal=International Journal of Behavioural and Healthcare Research |year=2013|url=http://aserenko.com/IJBHR_Serenko_Fan.pdf|volume = 4|issue=2|pages= 101–122 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Physicians and psychiatrists in many cultures and countries have standards for [[doctor-patient relationship]]s, which include maintaining confidentiality. In some cases, the [[physician-patient privilege]] is legally protected. These practices are in place to protect the dignity of patients, and to ensure that patients will feel free to reveal complete and accurate information required for them to receive the correct treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/everyday-law-encyclopedia/doctor-patient-confidentiality|title=If a patient is below the age of 18-years does confidentiality still works or should doctor breach and inform the parents?15years girl went for... - eNotes|website=eNotes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
To view the United States' laws on governing privacy of private health information, see [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]] and the [[Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act|HITECH Act]].

=== Financial ===
{{Main|Financial privacy}}
Information about a person's financial transactions, including the amount of assets, positions held in stocks or funds, outstanding debts, and purchases can be sensitive. If criminals gain access to information such as a person's accounts or credit card numbers, that person could become the victim of [[fraud]] or [[identity theft]].  Information about a person's purchases can reveal a great deal about that person's history, such as places he/she has visited, whom he/she has contacted with, products he/she has used, his/her activities and habits, or medications he/she has used. In some cases, corporations may use this information to target individuals with [[marketing]] customized towards those individual's personal preferences, which that person may or may not approve.

=== Locational ===
As location tracking capabilities of mobile devices are advancing ([[location-based service]]s), problems related to user privacy arise. Location data is among the most sensitive data currently being collected.&lt;ref name="AtaeiEphem16"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_BdADQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA360 |title=Progress in Location-Based Services 2016 |chapter=Ephemerality Is the New Black: A Novel Perspective on Location Data Management and Location Privacy in LBS |author=Ataei, M.; Kray, C. |publisher=Springer |pages=357–374 |year=2016 |isbn=9783319472898 |accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A list of potentially sensitive professional and personal information that could be inferred about an individual knowing only his mobility trace was published recently by the Electronic Frontier Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Blumberg, A.

A recent MIT study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Montjoye|first=Yves-Alexandre|author2=César A. Hidalgo |author3=Michel Verleysen |author4=Vincent D. Blondel |title=Unique in the Crowd: The privacy bounds of human mobility|journal=Scientific Reports|date=March 25, 2013|doi=10.1038/srep01376|url=http://www.nature.com/srep/2013/130325/srep01376/full/srep01376.html|accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Palmer|first=Jason|title=Mobile location data 'present anonymity risk'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-21923360|accessdate=12 April 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=March 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; by de Montjoye et al. showed that four spatio-temporal points, approximate places and times, are enough to uniquely identify 95% of 1.5&amp;nbsp;million people in a mobility database. The study further shows that these constraints hold even when the resolution of the dataset is low. Therefore, even coarse or blurred datasets provide little anonymity.

=== Political ===
{{Main|Political privacy}}
[[Political privacy]] has been a concern since [[voting system]]s emerged in ancient times. The [[secret ballot]] is the simplest and most widespread measure to ensure that political views are not known to anyone other than the voters themselves—it is nearly universal in modern [[democracy]], and considered to be a basic right of [[citizenship]]. In fact, even where other rights of [[privacy]] do not exist, this type of privacy very often does.

=== Educational ===
In the United Kingdom in 2012, the Education Secretary [[Michael Gove]] described the [[National Pupil Database]] as a "rich dataset" whose value could be "maximised" by making it more openly accessible, including to private companies. Kelly Fiveash of ''[[The Register]]'' said that this could mean "a child's school life including exam results, attendance, teacher assessments and even characteristics" could be available, with third-party organizations being responsible for anonymizing any publications themselves, rather than the data being anonymized by the government before being handed over. An example of a data request that Gove indicated had been rejected in the past, but might be possible under an improved version of privacy regulations, was for "analysis on sexual exploitation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/11/08/national_pupil_database_regulation_overhaul_in_private_sector_data_grab/|title=Psst: Heard the one about the National Pupil Database? Thought not|date=2012-11-08|accessdate=2012-12-12|work=[[The Register]]|last=Fiveash|first=Kelly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legality ==
{{Main|Information privacy law}}

The legal protection of the right to [[privacy]] in general – and of data privacy in particular – varies greatly around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://brooklynworks.brooklaw.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1082&amp;context=bjil|title=Blurred Line: Zooming in on Google Street View and the Global Right to Privacy|last=Rakower|first=Lauren|date=2011|website=brooklynworks.brooklaw.edu|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005101128/http://brooklynworks.brooklaw.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1082&amp;context=bjil|archive-date=2017-10-05|dead-url=no|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safe Harbor program and passenger name record issues ==
The [[United States Department of Commerce]] created the [[International Safe Harbor Privacy Principles]] certification program in response to the [[Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of personal data|1995 Directive on Data Protection]] (Directive 95/46/EC) of the European Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/privacy/law/index_en.htm|title=Protection of personal data – European Commission|website=ec.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Directive 95/46/EC declares in Chapter IV Article 25 that personal data may only be transferred from the countries in the [[European Economic Area]] to countries which provide [[adequate]] privacy protection. Historically, establishing adequacy required the creation of national laws broadly equivalent to those implemented by Directive 95/46/EU. Although there are exceptions to this blanket prohibition – for example where the disclosure to a country outside the EEA is made with the consent of the relevant individual (Article 26(1)(a)) – they are limited in practical scope.  As a result, Article 25 created a legal risk to organisations which transfer personal data from Europe to the United States.

The program regulates the exchange of [[passenger name record]] information between the EU and the US. According to the EU directive, personal data may only be transferred to third countries if that country provides an adequate level of protection. Some exceptions to this rule are provided, for instance when the controller himself can guarantee that the recipient will comply with the data protection rules.

The [[European Commission]] has set up the "Working party on the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Processing of Personal Data," commonly known as the "Article 29 Working Party".  The Working Party gives advice about the level of protection in the European Union and third countries.

The Working Party negotiated with U.S. representatives about the protection of personal data, the [[Safe Harbor Principles]] were the result. Notwithstanding that approval, the self-assessment approach of the Safe Harbor remains controversial with a number of European privacy regulators and commentators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/privacy/docs/adequacy/sec-2004-1323_en.pdf|title=Protection of personal data – European Commission|website=ec.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Safe Harbor program addresses this issue in the following way: rather than a blanket law imposed on all organisations in the [[United States]], a voluntary program is enforced by the FTC. U.S. organisations which register with this program, having self-assessed their compliance with a number of standards, are "deemed adequate" for the purposes of Article 25. Personal information can be sent to such organisations from the EEA without the sender being in breach of Article 25 or its EU national equivalents.  The Safe Harbor was approved as providing adequate protection for personal data, for the purposes of Article 25(6), by the European Commission on 26 July 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32000D0520:EN:HTML|title=EUR-Lex – 32000D0520 – EN|website=eur-lex.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Safe Harbor, adoptee organisations need to carefully consider their compliance with the ''onward transfer obligations'', where personal data originating in the EU is transferred to the US Safe Harbor, and then onward to a third country. The alternative compliance approach of "[[binding corporate rules]]", recommended by many EU privacy regulators, resolves this issue.  In addition, any dispute arising in relation to the transfer of HR data to the US Safe Harbor must be heard by a panel of EU privacy regulators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/privacy/docs/adequacy/information_safe_harbour_en.pdf|title=Protection of personal data – European Commission|website=ec.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2007, a new, controversial,&lt;ref name=R89 /&gt; [[Passenger Name Record]] agreement between the US and the EU was made.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20120112021643/http://www.libertysecurity.org/article1591.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--NOTE: Archive-only. Domain usage has changed.--&gt; A short time afterwards, the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] gave exemption for the [[Department of Homeland Security]], for the [[Arrival and Departure Information System]] (ADIS) and for the [[Automated Target System]] from the [[1974 Privacy Act]].&lt;ref name=Exemption&gt;[[Statewatch]], [http://www.statewatch.org/news/2007/sep/04eu-usa-pnr-exemptions.htm  US changes the privacy rules to exemption access to personal data] September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2008, [[Jonathan Faull]], the head of the EU's Commission of Home Affairs, complained about the US bilateral policy concerning PNR.&lt;ref name=Faull&gt;[http://euobserver.com/9/25657 Brussels attacks new US security demands], European Observer. See also [http://www.statewatch.org/news/ Statewatch newsletter] February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The US had signed in February 2008 a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the [[Czech Republic]] in exchange of a visa waiver scheme, without concerting before with Brussels.&lt;ref name=R89&gt;[http://www.rue89.com/2008/03/04/a-divided-europe-wants-to-protect-its-personal-data-wanted-by-the-us A divided Europe wants to protect its personal data wanted by the US], ''[[Rue 89]]'', 4 March 2008 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tensions between Washington and Brussels are mainly caused by a lesser level of [[data protection]] in the US, especially since foreigners do not benefit from the US [[Privacy Act of 1974]]. Other countries approached for bilateral MOU included the United Kingdom, Estonia, Germany and Greece.&lt;ref&gt;[[Statewatch]], March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Protecting privacy in information systems ==
As heterogeneous information systems with differing privacy rules are interconnected and information is shared, [[policy appliances]] will be required to reconcile, enforce, and monitor an increasing amount of privacy policy rules (and laws). There are two categories of technology to address privacy protection in [[Commerce|commercial]] IT systems: communication and enforcement.

;Policy communication
* [[P3P]] – The Platform for Privacy Preferences.  P3P is a standard for communicating privacy practices and comparing them to the preferences of individuals.

;Policy enforcement
* [[XACML]] – The Extensible Access Control Markup Language together with its Privacy Profile is a standard for expressing privacy policies in a machine-readable language which a software system can use to enforce the policy in enterprise IT systems.
* [[Enterprise Privacy Authorization Language|EPAL]] – The Enterprise Privacy Authorization Language is very similar to XACML, but is not yet a standard.
* WS-Privacy - "Web Service Privacy" will be a specification for communicating privacy policy in [[web service]]s.  For example, it may specify how privacy policy information can be embedded in the [[SOAP]] envelope of a web service message.

;Protecting privacy on the internet
On the internet many users give away a lot of information about themselves: unencrypted e-mails can be read by the administrators of an [[e-mail server]], if the connection is not encrypted (no [[HTTPS]]), and also the [[internet service provider]] and other parties [[packet analyzer|sniffing]] the network traffic of that connection are able to know the contents.
The same applies to any kind of traffic generated on the Internet, including [[web browsing]], [[instant messenger|instant messaging]], and others.
In order not to give away too much personal information, e-mails can be encrypted and browsing of webpages as well as other online activities can be done traceless via [[anonymizer]]s, or by open source distributed anonymizers, so-called [[mix network]]s.
Well known open-source mix nets include  [[I2P|I2P – The Anonymous Network]] and [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]].

=== Improving privacy through individualization ===

Computer privacy can be improved through [[forensic identification|individualization]]. Currently security messages are designed for the "average user", i.e. the same message for everyone.  Researchers have posited that individualized messages and security "nudges", crafted based on users' individual differences and personality traits, can be used for further improvements for each person's compliance with computer security and privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://blues.cs.berkeley.edu/blog/2015/08/26/the-myth-of-the-average-user-improving-privacy-and-security-systems-through-individualization-nspw-15/|title = The Myth of the Average User: Improving Privacy and Security Systems through Individualization (NSPW ’15) {{!}} BLUES|website = blues.cs.berkeley.edu|access-date = 2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Association for Feminist Economics (IAFFE)''' is a non-profit international association dedicated to raising awareness and inquiry of [[feminist economics]]. It has approximately six hundred members in sixty-four countries.&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.iaffe.org/pages/about-iaffe/history/|publisher=International Association for Feminist Economics (IAFFE)|accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The association publishes a quarterly journal entitled ''[[Feminist Economics (journal)|Feminist Economics]]''.&lt;ref name=Purpose&gt;{{cite web |title= Purposes and activities |url= http://www.iaffe.org/pages/about-iaffe/purposes-activities-copy/ |publisher=International Association for Feminist Economics (IAFFE) |accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1998 IAFFE has held [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] [[Special Consultative Status#Special|special consultative status]].&lt;ref name=Consult&gt;{{cite web | last= Willetts | first= Peter | title= List Non-Governmental Organisations in Consultative Status with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations, as of August 2003 - ECOSOC Special Consultative Status | url= http://www.staff.city.ac.uk/p.willetts/NGOS/NGO-2003.HTM#special |publisher=City University London | accessdate=7 June 2014 | quote= 598.

The organization is made up of [[Administrative division|'chapters']] which conduct panel meetings alongside the meetings of other economic groups such as, the [[European Association for Evolutionary Political Economy|European Association for Evolutionary and Political Economy (EAEPE)]] and the [[American Economic Association|American Economic Association (AEA)]].

== History ==
In 1990 [[Diana Strassmann]] organized a panel named, ''Can feminism find a home in economics?'' Members of the audience were invited specifically, by [[Jean Shackelford]] and April Aerni, to join a start-up network for economists which would be overtly feminist in outlook. In 1992 this network became the International Association for Feminist Economics (IAFFE) with Shackleford becoming their first president.&lt;ref name="Beyond"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Nelson | first1 = Julie A. | last2 = Ferber | first2 = Marianne | author-link1 = Julie A.

In 1998 IAFFE was made an [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] with [[Special Consultative Status#Special|special consultative status]] to the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council of the United Nations (ECOSOC)]].&lt;ref name=Consult /&gt;

By 2003 IAFFE had more than five hundred members from over thirty countries.&lt;ref name=Beyond /&gt; The association's president from 2003 to 2004 was [[Lourdes Benería]]. Shahra Razavi paid tribute to Benería in a speech at the IAFFE conference in 2012 describing Benería's work as, "not only empirically grounded and conceptually informed, but also contributing to a feminist critique that is systemic and connected to a broader critique of capitalism".&lt;ref name=Homage&gt;{{cite web|last1=Al-Adhami|first1=Rheem |last2=Razavi |first2=Shahra| title= Paying Homage: Shahra Razavi on the life and work of feminist economist Lourdes Benería|url=http://www.unrisd.org/80256B3C005BE6B5/search/394D8E693A63B3BFC1257A33004A3816?OpenDocument|publisher=United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD)|accessdate=7 June 2014|date=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IAFFE was awarded a grant of $1.5&amp;nbsp;million in 2010 from the [[Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency|Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA)]], to continue their work, including the publication of special issues of ''Feminist Economics''.&lt;ref name=SIDA&gt;{{cite web |title=International feminist organization based at UNL earns $1.5 million grant |url=http://newsroom.unl.edu/releases/2010/01/22/International+feminist+organization+based+at+UNL+earns+$1.5+M+grant |publisher=University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) |accessdate=7 June 2014 |date=22 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the association has gone on to number six hundred members in sixty-four countries.&lt;ref name=History /&gt;

== Chapters ==

=== European chapter ===
At the same time as IAFFE was setting up, a separate group of women, including [[Edith Kuiper]], in the Netherlands organized a conference on feminist perspectives on economic theory called ''Out of the Margins''. The conference brought many like minded people together who continued to network with one another and be involved in groups and activism, sometimes involving the IAFFE. (Another small group of Dutch economists founded another organization named FENN, the Feminist Economics Network in the Netherlands). In 1998, at a second Amsterdam conference, arrangements were made to hold the first meeting of IAFFE European chapter.&lt;ref name="Beyond_2"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Nelson | first1 = Julie A. | last2 = Ferber | first2 = Marianne | author-link1 = Julie A. Nelson | author-link2 = Marianne Ferber | contribution = Introduction - 'Beyond economic man', ten years later | editor-last1 = Nelson | editor-first1 = Julie A. | editor-last2 = Ferber | editor-first2 = Marianne | editor-link1 = Julie A.

The first official meeting of IAFFE Europe took place in Brussels in November 1998, there were twenty-five participants from ten countries and, as a result of the meeting, an e-mail list was created. Information about futures sessions and a report of the first meeting was sent to those interested, this led to more IAFFE panels (in 1999 and 2000) being organized for meetings of the [[European Association for Evolutionary Political Economy|European Association for Evolutionary and Political Economy (EAEPE)]].&lt;ref name=Beyond_2 /&gt;

The European chapter of IAFFE continued to meet and [[Ailsa McKay]], professor of economics at [[Glasgow Caledonian University]], was its chair until her death in March 2014.&lt;ref name=McKay&gt;{{cite news |last=Stewart |first=Catriona |title=Tributes for Caley Uni professor Ailsa |url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/tributes-for-caley-uni-professor-ailsa-154863n.23623353 |accessdate=7 June 2014 |newspaper=Evening Times|date=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australian and New Zealand Association for Feminist Economics (ANZAFFE) ===
The ''Out of the Margins'' conference resulted in a network of contacts being formed, one of these networks gradually became the Australian and New Zealand Association for Feminist Economics (ANZAFFE), a chapter of IAFFE. The chapter includes a small feminist economics group in Wellington, New Zealand led by [[Prue Hyman]].&lt;ref name=Beyond_2 /&gt;

=== United States chapter ===
The American chapter of IAFFE hold sessions at the [[American Economic Association|American Economic Association's (AEA)]] annual meetings.&lt;ref name=Beyond_2 /&gt;

== The Rhonda Williams Prize ==
IAFFE offer a prize scholarship in memory of former associate editor of ''Feminist Economics'' (1994–1998), Rhonda Williams. In 2014 the amount awarded was $1,500 to be given out at their summer conference to allow underrepresented groups in IAFFE attend the conference and present a paper.

Award winners must demonstrate a commitment to one or more of the following issues: inequalities; interrelationships (racism, sexism, homophobia, and classism); and connections between scholarship and activism. Funding is provided by both [[Routledge]] and, [[Taylor &amp; Francis]].&lt;ref name=RW_prize&gt;{{cite web|title=Upcoming Events|url=http://www.diversifyingecon.org/index.php/Upcoming_Events|publisher=Diversifying Economic Quality (Div.

== Conferences ==
IAFFE takes part in [[Allied Social Sciences Association|Allied Social Sciences Association's (ASSA)]] annual conference every year.&lt;ref name=Econ_Biz&gt;{{cite web|title=IAFFE Sessions at ASSA Conference|url=http://www.econbiz.de/events/event/iaffe-sessions-at-assa-conference/10005873761|publisher=EconBiz|accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has its own annual conferences.

'''Juggling notation''' is the written depiction of concepts and practices in [[juggling]].&lt;ref name=newsci&gt;{{cite journal|issue=2479 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18424792.100 |title= New juggling tricks created by maths |date=December 25, 2004 |first=Erica |last=Klarreich |journal=[[New Scientist]] |accessdate=August 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|accessdate=August 29, 2009|journal=[[Scientific American]] |url=http://www2.bc.edu/~lewbel/jugweb/sciamjug.pdf |date=November 1995 |volume=273 |issue=5 |pages=92–97 |title=The Science of Juggling |first1=Peter J. |last1=Beek |first2=Arthur |last2=Lewbel|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1195-92}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Toss juggling]] [[juggling pattern|patterns]] have a reputation for being "easier done than said" – while it might be easy to learn a given maneuver and demonstrate it for others, it is often much harder to communicate the idea accurately using speech or plain text. To circumvent this problem, various numeric or diagram-based notation systems have been developed to facilitate communication of patterns or tricks between jugglers, as well the investigation and discovery of new patterns.

A juggling notation system (based on [[percussion notation|music notation]]) was first proposed by Dave Storer in 1978 and while the first juggling diagram (a ladder diagram), by [[Claude Shannon]] around 1981, was not printed till 2010, the first printed diagram and second oldest notation system were proposed by Jeff Walker in 1982.&lt;ref name="Lewbel"&gt;Lewbel, Arthur (1996). "[http://www.juggle.org/history/archives/jugmags/49-2/v49no2-page%2057.htm The Academic Juggler: The Invention Of Juggling Notations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714182339/http://www.juggle.org/history/archives/jugmags/49-2/v49no2-page%2057.htm |date=2014-07-14 }}", ''Juggle.org''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagram-based==
[[File:JugglingBoxDiagram.gif|78px|thumb|Ladder diagram:&lt;br/&gt;3-ball [[box (juggling)|box]]]]

While diagrams are the most visual and reader-friendly way to notate many juggling patterns, they rely on images, so are complicated to produce and unwieldy to share via text or speech.

* '''Ladder diagrams''' - Each rung on the "ladder" represents a point in time (or "beat"). The juggled objects are represented as lines, their paths through time and between a pair of hands.
[[File:Juggling 6 ball 4 count ladder diagram.png|thumb|center|&lt;3p333:3p333&gt; pattern ladder diagram with a rail per juggler&lt;ref&gt;Voss, Jochen (2012-02-18). "[https://www.seehuhn.de/pages/passing Ball Passing Patterns]", ''Seehuhn.de'' (accessed 10/28/2017).&lt;/ref&gt;]]
* '''Causal diagrams''' - Similar to the ladder diagram but doesn't show the [[juggling prop|props]] held in a juggler's hands. Instead it only shows each "problem" &amp;mdash; an incoming prop &amp;mdash; and what the juggler should do to make space in his or her hands to catch that incoming prop. It is usually used for [[passing (juggling)|club passing]] and can be displayed or edited in some juggling software.
*'''Mills Mess State Transition Diagrams''' - [[Mills Mess]] is a popular pattern in which the arms cross and uncross. Mills Mess State Transition Diagrams can be used to track these basic arm movements.

==Numeric==
The following notation systems use only numbers and common characters. The patterns can easily be communicated by text. Most numeric systems are designed to be processed by software juggling simulators &amp;mdash; for example, to view juggling patterns as computer animations.

===Siteswap===
{{Main|Siteswap}}
Developed by mathematically inclined jugglers Bengt Magnusson and Bruce Boppo Tiemann in 1985,&lt;ref name=newsci/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|last=Donahue |first=Bill |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/16/science/jugglers-now-juggle-numbers-to-compute-new-tricks-for-ancient-art.html |title=Jugglers Now Juggle Numbers to Compute New Tricks for Ancient Art |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=1996-04-16 |accessdate=August 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=maa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maa.org/reviews/mathjuggling.html |title=Read This: The Mathematics of Juggling |publisher=[[Mathematical Association of America]] |date=2003-12-03 |accessdate=August 29, 2009 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016045559/http://www.maa.org/reviews/mathjuggling.html |archivedate=October 16, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[siteswap]] is by far the most common juggling notation.

A given juggling pattern is represented by a sequence of digits, like "333", "97531", or "744". Each digit represents the number of throws that occur by the time that same prop will be caught. For example, "333" represents a common three-ball [[cascade (juggling)|cascade]], where three props are thrown before the same prop will be caught and thrown again. Within the "531531" pattern, the prop thrown first, the '5' throw, will not be caught until five throws have been made, including itself, where it will be thrown again as a '1'. The prop thrown next, the '3', will be thrown again on the third throw afterwards, the next '3'. And the next prop is thrown with a '1' throw, which is a direct pass to the other hand and will be thrown on the very next throw as a '5'. 

Because the number represents the number of throws that occur before that prop will be caught, it can be also be thought to describe how high one throws the prop, or how long it remains in the air relative to the other throws, where even numbers inevitably come back to the same hand and odd numbers cross over to the other hand.

The number of props in a given juggling pattern can be determined by the average of one repeating group. "633633633", therefore describes a four-prop pattern, while "414414414" describes a three-prop juggling pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thomwall.com/siteswap-fundamentals|title=Siteswap Fundamentals ⋆ Thom Wall|date=2017-09-05|work=Thom Wall|access-date=2017-11-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Vanilla" siteswap is the most basic form of siteswap and uses only a simple string of digits to describe patterns that throw only one prop at a time, alternating between hands. For slightly more complicated patterns, extra rules and syntax are added to create the following two siteswap extensions:

*''Synchronous Siteswap'', or "Synch" Siteswap. This is used to notate patterns where both hands throw at the same time, rather than alternating left and right hands. The numbers for the two throws are combined in parentheses and separated by a comma. For example, "(4,4)(4,4)(4,4)".
*''Multiplex Siteswap''. "Multiplex", in the world of juggling, means "more than one ball is in the hand at the time of the throw". Multiplex Siteswap allows you to notate such patterns, and also can be mixed with synchronous siteswap. A multiplex is described by a digit for each prop in the multiplex throw contained within square brackets. "23[43]23[43]" is a common four ball multiplex. 

Vanilla, synch, and multiplex siteswap are the "standard" forms of siteswap. Not only are they understood by jugglers, there are also many computer programs capable of animating juggling patterns entered in siteswap notation.

Other extensions to siteswap have been developed for specific purposes. These are far less common than the "standard" forms of siteswap, understood by far fewer jugglers and only specialized software.

*'''Passing siteswap''' - used for simple passing patterns.
*'''Multi-Hand Notation''' (MHN) - Developed by Ed Carstens for use with his juggling program JugglePro, MHN can describe patterns with any number of hands and at any rhythm, but use is limited due to its being as complex as a computer programming language.
*'''Generalized Siteswap''' (GS) - Developed by Ben Beever, GS places siteswap into a matrix that uses optional, additional rows to describe any desired attributes of the throws or catches within a pattern, such as timing issues (e.g. for synch patterns), number of spins (e.g. for clubs) and hand position/orientation (e.g. for backcrosses, claw catches etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jugglingedge.com/pdf/BenBeeversGuidetoJugglingPatterns.pdf|title=SS Ben's Guide to Juggling Patterns|last=Beever|first=Ben|date=20 January 2002|work=The Juggling Edge|accessdate=5 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3391">The '''law in Africa''' is a diverse mix of [[common law]], [[customary law]], [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and [[religious law]] systems. Africa is the second largest continent and has 56 countries contained in it.

==History==
Modern Africa has been shaped primarily through different countries' inheritance of laws which existed in Europe through the nineteenth century. For instance, the primary sources of [[South Africa]] law were Roman-Dutch and English Common law, imports of Dutch settlements and British colonialism. Thus it is sometimes termed Anglo-Dutch law. Various lawmaking bodies have existed within South Africa over time. Yet in fact, some of the oldest legal systems began first in Africa. For instance, Ancient Egyptian law used a civil code, based on the concept of [[Ma'at]]. Tradition, rhetorical speech, social equality and impartiality were key principles.[http://www.cap-press.com/authors/217]&lt;ref&gt;Russ VerSteeg, ''Law in Ancient Egypt'' (2002) {{ISBN|0-89089-978-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judges kept records, which was used as precedent, although the systems developed slowly.

A [[polycentric law|polycentric]] [[legal system]], called ''[[Xeer]]'' developed exclusively in the [[Horn of Africa]] more than a millennium ago and is still widely used by the [[Somali people]]. Under this system, [[Elder (administrative title)|elders]] serve as judges and help mediate cases using precedents.&lt;ref name="LALL"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Xeer is a good example of how [[customary law]] can work in lieu of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], and is a good approximation of what is thought of as [[natural law]]. Several scholars have noted that even though Xeer may be centuries old, it has the potential to serve as the legal system of a modern, well functioning economy.&lt;ref name="PLBS"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Xeer also shows how influential a system of laws can be with regard to the development of a culture. According to one report, the Somali nation did not begin with the common use of the [[Somali language]] by the Somali clans, but rather with the collective observance of Xeer.

It is mainly used for the evaluation of [[nuclear medicine]] [[medical imaging|imaging]] data after the injection of a labeled ligand that binds reversibly to specific [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] or [[enzyme]].

In conventional [[Multi-compartment model|compartmental analysis]], an [[iterative method]] is used to fit the individual model parameters in the solution of a compartmental model of specific configuration to the measurements with a measured plasma time-activity curve that serves as an forcing (input) function, and the binding of the tracer can then be described. Graphical analysis is a simplified method that transforms the model equations into a linear equation evaluated at multiple time points and provides fewer parameters (i.e., slope and intercept). Although the slope and the intercept can be interpreted in terms of a combination of model parameters if a compartmental model configuration is assumed, the graphical methods are independent of any specific model configuration. In case of irreversible tracers, certain fraction of the radioactivity is trapped in the tissue or the binding site during the course of the experiment, whereas reversible tracers show uptake and loss from all compartments throughout the study. The theoretical foundation of graphical analysis for irreversible tracers (also called [[Patlak plot|Patlak graphical analysis]] or [[Patlak plot]]) was laid by [[Clifford Patlak]] and his colleagues&lt;ref name="Patlak1983"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=C.S.

== Description ==

The kinetics of radiolabeled compounds in a compartmental system can be described in terms of a set of first-order, constant-coefficient, ordinary differential equations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=K. Godfrey | title=Compartmental Models and Their Application | publisher=Academic Press, New York | year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=J.A. Jacquez | title=Compartmental Analysis in Biology and Medicine | publisher=The University of Michigan Press, Ann Arbor | edition=2nd | year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The time course of the activity in the multicompartmental system driven by a metabolite-corrected plasma input function &lt;math&gt;C_p(t)&lt;/math&gt; can be described by:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{d\mathbf{A}}{dt} = \mathbf{KA} + \mathbf{Q}C_p(t)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; is a column vector of activity concentration for each compartment at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K}&lt;/math&gt; is the matrix of the transfer constants between compartments, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Q}&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of plasma-to-tissue transfer constants. Patlak and Blasberg&lt;ref name="Patlak1985" /&gt; showed that the above equation can be written as:

: &lt;math&gt;\int_0^t A(\tau) \, d\tau = -\mathbf{U}_n^T \mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{Q} \int_0^t C_p(\tau) \, d\tau + \mathbf{U}_n^T \mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U}_n^T&lt;/math&gt; represents a row vector of 1s and &lt;math&gt;A(t) = \mathbf{U}_n^T \mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;.  The total activity in the [[region of interest]], &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{ROI}(t)&lt;/math&gt;, is a combination of radioactivities from all compartments plus a plasma volume fraction (&lt;math&gt;V_p&lt;/math&gt;)&lt;ref name="Patlak1983" /&gt; and thus:

: &lt;math&gt;\int_0^t \mathrm{ROI}(\tau) \, d\tau = (-\mathbf{U}_n^T \mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{Q} +V_p) \int_0^t C_p(\tau) \, d\tau + \mathbf{U}_n^T \mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;

By [[division (mathematics)|dividing]] both sides by &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{ROI}(t)&lt;/math&gt;, one obtains the following linear equation:

: &lt;math&gt;{{\int_0^t \mathrm{ROI}(\tau) \, d\tau} \over \mathrm{ROI}(t)} = (-\mathbf{U}_n^T \mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{Q} +V_p) {{\int_0^t C_p(\tau) \, d\tau} \over \mathrm{ROI}(t)} + {{\mathbf{U}_n^T \mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{A}} \over {\mathbf{U}_n^T \mathbf{A} + V_p C_p}}&lt;/math&gt;

For &lt;math&gt;t &gt; t'&lt;/math&gt;, Patlak and his colleagues&lt;ref name="Patlak1983" /&gt; showed that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = -\mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{Q} C_p(t)&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., the steady-state condition.  When this condition is satisfied, the intercept has reached its constant value so that after some time a plot of &lt;math&gt;{{\int_{0}^{t} C_p(\tau)d\tau} \over \mathrm{ROI}(t)}&lt;/math&gt; versus &lt;math&gt;{{\int_{0}^{t} \mathrm{ROI}(\tau)d\tau} \over \mathrm{ROI}(t)}&lt;/math&gt; becomes a straight line with slope &lt;math&gt;(-\mathbf{U}_n^T \mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{Q} + V_p)&lt;/math&gt; and intercept &lt;math&gt;{{\mathbf{U}_n^T \mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{A}} \over {\mathbf{U}_n^T \mathbf{A} + V_p C_p}}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Logan1990" /&gt;

For a catenary two-tissue compartment model with transfer constants &lt;math&gt;K_1&lt;/math&gt; (forward transport from plasma to tissue), &lt;math&gt;k_2&lt;/math&gt; (reverse transport from tissue to plasma), &lt;math&gt;k_3&lt;/math&gt; ([[Binding (molecular)|binding]] parameter proportional to &lt;math&gt;B_\max k_\mathrm{on}&lt;/math&gt;), and &lt;math&gt;k_4&lt;/math&gt; (dissociation constant) to analyze enzyme or receptor system, the slope represents the total [[distribution volume]] (&lt;math&gt;V_d&lt;/math&gt;) and is given by &lt;math&gt;\frac{K_1}{k_2}(1+\frac{k_3}{k_4}) + V_p&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name="Logan1990" /&gt; where &lt;math&gt;k_3 = B_\max k_\mathrm{on}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;k_4 = k_\mathrm{off}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\frac{k_3}{k_4} = \frac{B_\max}{K_d}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;K_d = k_\mathrm{off}/k_\mathrm{on}&lt;/math&gt;, in which &lt;math&gt;B_\max&lt;/math&gt; is the concentration of ligand binding sites, &lt;math&gt;K_d&lt;/math&gt; is the equilibrium [[dissociation constant]] for the ligand-binding site complex, &lt;math&gt;k_\mathrm{on}&lt;/math&gt; is the ligand-binding association constant, &lt;math&gt;k_\mathrm{off}&lt;/math&gt; is the ligand-binding dissociation constant.  For a one-tissue compartment model with transfer constants &lt;math&gt;K_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_2&lt;/math&gt;, the slope is &lt;math&gt;\lambda + V_p&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the [[partition coefficient]] (&lt;math&gt;{K_1}/{k_2}&lt;/math&gt;) and the intercept is &lt;math&gt;\frac{-1}{k_2(1+V_p/\lambda)}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Logan1990" /&gt;

==History==
The influence of rhythmic sounds and drums to enter altered states of consciousness is used in different indigenous tribes (see [[Shamanic music]]), as well as optical stimulation produced by the flickering light of camp fires or pressing lightly on the eyeballs.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thomason|first=Timothy|date=2010-01-01|title=The Role of Altered States of Consciousness in Native American Healing|url=http://works.bepress.com/timothy_thomason/10/|journal=Journal of Rural Community Psychology|volume=E13|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This “stroboscopic photo-stimulation produces "photic driving", the alpha type of brain electrical activity associated with an altered state in which people are susceptible to suggestion.” (&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;12).

First scientific observations were made by [[William Charles Wells]] in the 1790s who described different effects of binocular vision. His results were later transferred to be applied in [[binaural beats]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Destined for Distinguished Oblivion: The Scientific Vision of William Charles Wells (1757-1817)|last=Wade|first=N. J.|publisher=Kluwer-Plenum|year=2003|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Visual experiments with flickering lights were conducted in the 1940s by [[William Grey Walter]] who used stroboscopic light flashes to measure their effects on brain activity, assessed with EEG. He reported effect not just on visual areas but on the whole cortex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The living brain|last=Walter|first=W. G|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|year=1963|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the '60s and '70s the interest in different methods to induce altered states without the use of drugs were rising. Some of the induced states by rhythmic light and sound combinations were even described as psychedelic-like, while these claims lack adequate measurements for their similarity. In this line, numerous nightclubs began using strobes to maximize the effects of the music for dancing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The development of alpha EEG feedback (see [[neurofeedback]]) is an important starting point for biofeedback and its explicit use for entering altered states of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Lynch, J. |author2=Paskewitz, D. |author3=Orne, M. |date=1974|title=Some Factors in the Feedback Control of Human Alpha Rhythm|url=|journal=Psychosomatic Medicine|volume=36|issue=5|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these decades, Jack Schwarz built one of the first mind machines using rhythmic sounds and variable frequency lights in goggles to produce certain mental states.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Enterprises started to produce different types of mind machines and also some scientist followed the line of research to explore if and how these devices elicit effects on brain processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Audio-Visual Entrainment: History, Physiology, and Clinical Studies|last=Siever|first=D.|work=Handbook of Neurofeedback: Dynamics and Clinical Applications|publisher=James R. Evans|year=2007|isbn=|location=The Haworth Medical Press, Binghamton, NY|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s and early 1990s Farley initiated an investigation concerning medical claims made by some manufacturers and sellers.&lt;ref name="medical_claims" /&gt; The FDA concluded that Light and Sound Machines were not medical devices and did not warrant regulation. Sellers and manufacturers were given guidelines for how they could advertise these devices, and were required to include a disclaimer and cautionary document with each machine.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}
Nowadays, mind machines are rediscovered by some teenage cultures  as so called “digital drugs”, a legal way to enter altered states of consciousness.&lt;ref name="Idosing" /&gt;

== Application ==
Mind machines include flashing light devices, which are similar to the Brion Gysin dreamachine in that both produce a flickering visual field. Unlike flashing light devices, the dreamachine can be used by several people at once, but has few, if any, technical features.

=== Technical setting ===
[[File:Dreammachine.jpg |right|thumb|200px |A Brion Gysin Dreammachine.]]Mind machines typically consist of a control unit, a pair of headphones and/or strobe light goggles. The unit controls the sessions and drives the LEDs in the goggles. Professionally, they are usually referred to as Auditory Visual Stimulation Devices (AVS devices).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=PhD|first=Ruth Olmstead|date=2005-09-06|title=Use of Auditory and Visual Stimulation to Improve Cognitive Abilities in Learning-Disabled Children|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J184v09n02_04|journal=Journal of Neurotherapy|volume=9|issue=2|pages=49–61|doi=10.1300/J184v09n02_04|issn=1087-4208}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also mind machines are offered that can connect to the Internet for updates download of new session material.

=== Application rate ===
One session normally takes between 15 and 60 minutes. During a session the user should lie relaxed, and place the glasses on the eyes, which should remain closed during the whole session. Many machines have pre-programmed sessions which vary in parameters like light brightness, audio pitch or beat frequency but also give the opportunity for the user to create an own session for him-/herself. Typically one session consists of a series of segments. Within one segment parameters change in a constant way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.amazing1.com/products/the-proteus.html|title=Advanced light sound stimulation system: Reference Guide and User’s Manual|last=Proteus|date=2006|work=|access-date=May 20, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mind machines are often used together with biofeedback or neurofeedback equipment in order to adjust the frequency on the fly,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.happy-electronics.eu/avs/application/|title=Applications – Happy Electronics|website=www.happy-electronics.eu|access-date=2016-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; while proof for their effectiveness is lacking.

== Description of altered states ==

=== Perceptual changes ===
Light &amp; sound mind machines can have various effects on the user. Most users describe seeing a flashing light, others perceive swirling patterns that have been compared to psychedelic light shows or fractals. A few users report seeing detailed, virtual reality like scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://realization.org/page/doc0/doc0036.htm|title=Mind machines FAQ|last=Hicks|first=J.|date=1999|website=|publisher=|access-date=May 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; But also tactile and emotional changes are reported  after a 6&amp;nbsp;Hz photic stimulation, as well as auditory hallucinations like binaural beats.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Changes in brain activity ===
Sessions will typically aim to address the target frequencies which correspond to delta (1-3 hertz), theta (4–7&amp;nbsp;Hz), alpha (8–12&amp;nbsp;Hz) or beta brain waves (13–40&amp;nbsp;Hz).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=mindmods.com|title=Accessing Alternity: Neurotechnology and Alternate States of Consciousness|last=Harrah-Conforth|first=B.|date=1992|work=|access-date=July 15, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those frequency bands can be adjusted by the user based on the desired effects.

For relaxation, often a reduction from beta waves to lower alpha or theta frequencies is observed. It is aimed to reach a level of “slow alpha” (8&amp;nbsp;Hz).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Glickson (1986) states that an alpha frequency of 10&amp;nbsp;Hz is optimal for perceiving visual hallucinations. He assumes that it's the change in alpha activity and not the alpha activity itself that is facilitating an altered state of consciousness.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== After effects ===
Even if research is not sufficient so far, Michael Hutchison and other scientists report strong tranquilizing effects that lasted up to 3 days.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After several sessions it is observed that users can produce a desired brain state with the associated brainwaves easier and deliberately.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Other information ==

=== Therapeutic Use ===
Clinical research has been done on the use of auditory and visual stimulation to improve cognitive abilities in learning-disabled children as well as in the treatment of [[autism]] and [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Siever|first=D.|date=2003|title=Audio-Visual Entrainment: Applying Audio-Visual Entrainment Technology For Attention and Learning|url=|journal=Association for Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback (AAPB) publication, "Biofeedback Magazine"|volume=31|issue=4|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, lacking enough evidence to conclude that these treatments show efficacy, several studies indicate the potential to  increase effects on IQ and reading levels in primary students (cite Olmstead, 2005), but also improvements in inattention and impulsiveness in children with ADHD (cite Siever).

===Safety===

Rapidly flashing lights may be dangerous for people with [[photosensitive epilepsy]] or other nervous disorders.  It is thought that one out of 10,000 adults will experience a [[seizure]] while viewing such a device; about twice as many children will have a similar ill effect.&lt;ref name="Allen"&gt;{{cite news |first=Mark |last=Allen|title=Décor by Timothy Leary |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/20/garden/20mach.html?ex=1264050000&amp;en=2ead60550b324624&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt |work= |publisher=The New York Times |date=2005-01-20 |accessdate=2007-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulation===

Mind machine devices are legally available throughout the United States from many sources.&lt;ref name="Idosing" /&gt;

With some exceptions,&lt;ref name=TENS_approval&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm388765.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; these devices commonly do not have [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] approval for medical applications in the USA. They have been found by a U.S. district court to be Class III medical devices, and consequentially require FDA pre-market approval for all medical uses. One company making [[radionics|medical claims]] for a possibly unsafe device has been shut down and seen their devices destroyed.&lt;ref name=medical_claims&gt;{{ cite journal |last1 = Farley Dixie|year = 1994 |title = Unapproved 'Brain Wave' Devices Condemned after Seizure Reports |journal = FDA Consumer |quote = The devices were various models of a product called the InnerQuest Brain Wave Synchronizer - headgear (an audio cassette and eyeglasses) that emitted sounds and flashing lights.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3992">The [[stereotypical]] behavior of people from [[Minnesota]] to be [[courteous]], reserved, and mild-mannered, is popularly known as '''Minnesota nice'''. The cultural characteristics of "Minnesota nice" include polite friendliness, an aversion to confrontation, a tendency toward [[understatement]], a disinclination to make a fuss or stand out, emotional restraint, and [[self-deprecation]].&lt;ref name="Atkins"&gt;{{cite book|last=Atkins|first=Annette|year=2008|title=Creating Minnesota: A History from the Inside Out|publisher=[[Minnesota Historical Society]] |isbn=0-87351-633-8|pages=242, 243, 248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social norms ==
[[Playwright]] and corporate communications consultant Syl Jones suggested that ''Minnesota nice'' is not entirely about being "nice" but is more about keeping up appearances, maintaining the [[social order]], and keeping people in their place. He relates these [[social norms]] to the literary work of Danish-Norwegian novelist [[Aksel Sandemose]], the fictional [[Law of Jante]], and more generally, [[Scandinavia|Scandinavian]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news &lt;!-- actually commentary, but news citation format --&gt; | url = http://www.mprnews.org/story/2009/12/14/syljones | title = The unwritten rules that tell Minnesotans how to be nice | first = Syl | last = Jones | date = December 14, 2009 | publisher = [[Minnesota Public Radio]] | location = [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] | accessdate = December 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Garrison Keillor]]'s ''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]'' discusses "Wobegonics", the supposed language of Minnesotans which includes "no confrontational verbs or statements of strong personal preference".&lt;ref&gt;[http://prairiehome.publicradio.org/programs/19970419/97_0419WOBEGONICS.htm "Wobegonics" on ''A Prairie Home Companion'', Saturday, April 19, 1997] Retrieved December 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
The generosity of state citizens has been commented on; the heavily-reported [[influenza vaccine]] shortage of late 2004 did not strike the state as hard as elsewhere since many people willingly gave up [[injection (medicine)|injection]]s for others.&lt;ref&gt;''[[New York Times]]''. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/12/national/12flu.html In Minnesota, Flu Vaccines Go Waiting]". 12 November 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept has also received some support from the academic community; a national study by Peter Rentfrow, Samuel Gosling, and Jeff Potter done in 2008 found that Minnesota was the second most [[Agreeableness|agreeable]] and fifth most [[Extroversion|extroverted]] state in the nation, traits associated with "nice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1745-6924.2008.00084.x |pmid=26158954 |title=A Theory of the Emergence, Persistence, and Expression of Geographic Variation in Psychological Characteristics |journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science |volume=3 |issue=5 |pages=339–69 |year=2008 |last1=Rentfrow |first1=Peter J. |last2=Gosling |first2=Samuel D. |last3=Potter |first3=Jeff }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition of [[social progressivism]] in [[Minnesota politics]] has been linked to the Minnesota Nice culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Christian |last1=Eichenlaub |year=2008 |title='Minnesota Nice': A Comparative Analysis of Minnesota's Treatment of Adoption by Gay Couples |journal=University of St. Thomas Law Journal |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=312–34 |url=http://ir.stthomas.edu/ustlj/vol5/iss1/13/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Minnesota nice was an influence on the [[Coen brothers]] movie ''[[Fargo (film)|Fargo]]'', set in both Minnesota and neighboring [[North Dakota]]; a documentary about the making of the movie was entitled ''Minnesota Nice''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0323262/ ''Minnesota Nice''] at [[imdb.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Monographs|volume=7|pages=7&amp;ndash;11|isbn=0-12-356950-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monogenic semigroups are also called '''cyclic semigroups'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=A H Clifford|author2=G B Preston|title=The Algebraic Theory of Semigroups Vol.I|publisher=American Mathematical Society|year=1961|series=Mathematical Surveys|volume=7|pages=19&amp;ndash;20|isbn=978-0821802724}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The monogenic semigroup  generated by the [[singleton set]] { ''a'' } is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\langle a \rangle &lt;/math&gt;. The set of elements of &lt;math&gt;\langle a \rangle &lt;/math&gt; is  { ''a'', ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, ... }. There are two possibilities for the monogenic semigroup  &lt;math&gt;\langle a \rangle &lt;/math&gt;:
*''a''&lt;sup&gt; ''m''&lt;/sup&gt; =  ''a''&lt;sup&gt; ''n''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rArr; ''m'' = ''n''.
*There exist ''m'' &amp;ne; ''n'' such that ''a''&lt;sup&gt; ''m''&lt;/sup&gt; =  ''a''&lt;sup&gt; ''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.
In the former case &lt;math&gt;\langle a \rangle &lt;/math&gt; is [[isomorphic]] to the semigroup ( {1, 2, ... }, + ) of [[natural numbers]] under [[addition]]. In such a case, &lt;math&gt;\langle a \rangle &lt;/math&gt; is an ''infinite monogenic semigroup'' and  the element ''a'' is said to have ''infinite order''. It is sometimes called the ''free monogenic semigroup'' because it is also a [[free semigroup]] with one generator.

In the latter case let ''m'' be the smallest positive integer such that ''a''&lt;sup&gt; ''m''&lt;/sup&gt; =  ''a'' &lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; for some positive integer ''x'' &amp;ne; ''m'', and let ''r'' be smallest positive integer such that ''a''&lt;sup&gt; ''m''&lt;/sup&gt; =  ''a''&lt;sup&gt; ''m'' + ''r''&lt;/sup&gt;. The positive integer ''m'' is referred to as the '''index''' and the positive integer ''r'' as the '''period''' of the monogenic semigroup &lt;math&gt;\langle a \rangle &lt;/math&gt;. The '''order''' of ''a'' is defined as ''m''+''r''-1. The period and the index satisfy the following properties:
*''a''&lt;sup&gt; ''m''&lt;/sup&gt; =  ''a''&lt;sup&gt; ''m'' + ''r''&lt;/sup&gt;
*''a''&lt;sup&gt; ''m'' + ''x''&lt;/sup&gt; =  ''a''&lt;sup&gt; ''m'' + ''y''&lt;/sup&gt; if and only if ''m'' + ''x'' &amp;equiv;  ''m'' + ''y'' ( mod ''r'' )
*&lt;math&gt;\langle a \rangle &lt;/math&gt; = { ''a'', ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''2''&lt;/sup&gt;, ... , ''a''&lt;sup&gt; ''m'' + ''r'' &amp;minus; 1&lt;/sup&gt; }
*''K''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; = { ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;, ''a''&lt;sup&gt; ''m'' + 1&lt;/sup&gt;, ... , ''a''&lt;sup&gt; ''m'' + ''r'' &amp;minus; 1&lt;/sup&gt; } is a [[Cyclic group|cyclic]] [[subgroup]] and also an [[Semigroup#Subsemigroups and ideals|ideal]] of &lt;math&gt;\langle a \rangle &lt;/math&gt;. It is called the ''[[kernel of a semigroup|kernel]]'' of ''a'' and it is the [[minimal ideal]] of the monogenic semigroup &lt;math&gt;\langle a \rangle &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Kernel_of_a_semi-group&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Minimal_ideal&lt;/ref&gt;

The pair ( ''m'', ''r'' ) of positive integers determine the [[structure]] of monogenic semigroups. For every pair ( ''m'', ''r'' ) of positive integers, there does exist a monogenic semigroup having index ''m'' and period ''r''.  The monogenic semigroup having index ''m'' and period ''r'' is denoted by ''M'' ( ''m'', ''r'' ). The monogenic semigroup ''M'' ( 1, ''r'' ) is the [[cyclic group]] of order ''r''.

The results in this section [[Semigroup#Structure of semigroups|actually hold]] for any element ''a'' of an arbitrary semigroup and the monogenic subsemigroup &lt;math&gt;\langle a \rangle &lt;/math&gt; it generates.

== Related notions ==
A related notion is that of '''periodic semigroup''' (also called '''torsion semigroup'''), in which every element has finite order (or, equivalently, in which every mongenic subsemigroup is finite). A more general class is that of quasi-periodic semigroups (aka group-bound semigroups or [[epigroup]]s) in which every element of the semigroup has a power that lies in a subgroup.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Periodic_semi-group&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Higgins1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter M. Higgins|title=Techniques of semigroup theory|year=1992|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-853577-5|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[aperiodic semigroup]] is one in which every monogenic subsemigroup has a period of 1.

The '''multiplicative weights update method''' is an algorithmic technique most commonly used for decision making and prediction, and also widely deployed in game theory and algorithm design. The simplest use case is the problem of prediction from expert advice, in which a decision maker needs to iteratively decide on an expert whose advice to follow. The method assigns initial weights to the experts (usually identical initial weights), and updates these weights multiplicatively and iteratively according to the feedback of how well an expert performed: reducing it in case of poor performance, and increasing it otherwise. &lt;ref name = ref1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoryofcomputing.org/articles/v008a006/v008a006.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Multiplicative Weights Update Method: A Meta-Algorithm and Applications |date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was discovered repeatedly in very diverse fields such as machine learning ([[AdaBoost]], [[Winnow (algorithm)|Winnow]], Hedge), [[Mathematical optimization|optimization]] (solving [[Linear programming|linear programs]]), theoretical computer science (devising fast algorithm for [[Linear programming|LPs]] and [[Semidefinite programming|SDPs]]), and [[game theory]].

==Name==
"Multiplicative weights" implies the iterative rule used in algorithms derived from the multiplicative weight update method.&lt;ref name=ref2&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/academic/class/15859-f11/www/notes/lecture16.pdf |format=PDF |title= The Multiplicative Weights Algorithm* |access-date=2016-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is given with different names in the different fields where it was discovered or rediscovered.

==History and background==
The earliest known version of this technique was in an algorithm named "[[fictitious play]]" which was proposed in [[game theory]] in the early 1950s. Grigoriadis and Khachiyan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |format=PDF |title= A sublinear-time randomized approximation algorithm for matrix games. |date=1995 |access-date=2016-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; applied a randomized variant of "fictitious play" to solve two-player [[zero-sum game]]s efficiently using the multiplicative weights algorithm. In this case, player allocates higher weight to the actions that had a better outcome and choose his strategy relying on these weights. In [[machine learning]], Littlestone applied the earliest form of the multiplicative weights update rule in his famous [[Winnow (algorithm)|winnow algorithm]], which is similar to Minsky and Papert's earlier [[Perceptron|perceptron learning algorithm]]. Later, he generalized the winnow algorithm to weighted majority algorithm. Freund and Schapire followed his steps and generalized the winnow algorithm in the form of hedge algorithm.

The multiplicative weights algorithm is also widely applied in [[computational geometry]] such as [[Kenneth L. Clarkson|Clarkson's]] algorithm for [[Linear programming|linear programming (LP)]] with a bounded number of variables in linear time.&lt;ref name="KENNETH L. CLARKSON pp. 452"&gt;KENNETH L. CLARKSON. '' A Las Vegas algorithm for linear programming when the dimension is small.'', In Proc. 29th FOCS, pp. 452–456. IEEE Comp. Soc. Press, 1988.[doi:10.1109/SFCS.1988.21961] 123, 152.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KENNETH L. CLARKSON 1995"&gt;KENNETH L. CLARKSON. ''A Las Vegas algorithm for linear and integer programming when the dimension is small.'', J. ACM, 42:488–499, 1995. [doi:10.1145/201019.201036] 123, 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Bronnimann and Goodrich employed analogous methods to find [[Set cover problem|set covers]] for [[hypergraph]]s with small [[VC dimension]].&lt;ref name="M.T. GOODRICH. 1995"&gt;H. BRONNIMANN AND ¨ M.T. GOODRICH. ''Almost optimal set covers in finite VC-dimension.'', Discrete Comput. Geom., 14:463–479, 1995. Preliminary version in 10th Ann. Symp. Comp. Geom. (SCG'94). [doi:10.1007/BF02570718] 123, 152&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Operations research|operation research]] and on-line statistical decision making problem field, the weighted majority algorithm and its more complicated versions have been found independently.

In computer science field, some researchers have previously observed the close relationships between multiplicative update algorithms used in different contexts. Young discovered the similarities between fast LP algorithms and Raghavan's method of pessimistic estimators for derandomization of randomized rounding algorithms; Klivans and Servedio linked boosting algorithms in learning theory to proofs of Yao's XOR Lemma; Garg and Khandekar defined a common framework for convex optimization problems that contains Garg-Konemann and Plotkin-Shmoys-Tardos as subcases.&lt;ref name=ref4&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.satyenkale.com/papers/mw-survey.pdf |format=PDF |title= The Multiplicative Weights Update Method: A Meta-Algorithm and Applications |date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General setup==
A binary decision needs to be made based on n experts’ opinions to attain an associated payoff. In the first round, all experts’ opinions have the same weight. The decision maker will make the first decision based on the majority of the experts' prediction. Then, in each successive round, the decision maker will repeatedly update the weight of each expert's opinion depending on the correctness of his prior predictions. Real life examples includes predicting if it is rainy tomorrow or if the stock market will go up or go down.

==Algorithm analysis==

===Halving algorithm&lt;ref name=ref2&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/academic/class/15859-f11/www/notes/lecture16.pdf |format=PDF |title= The Multiplicative Weights Algorithm* |access-date=2016-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;===

Given a sequential game played between an adversary and an aggregator who is advised by N experts, the goal is for the aggregator to make as few mistakes as possible. Assume there is an expert among the N experts who always gives the correct prediction. In the halving algorithm, only the consistent experts are retained. Experts who make mistakes will be dismissed. For every decision, the aggregator decides by taking a majority vote among the remaining experts. Therefore, every time the aggregator makes a mistake, at least half of the remaining experts are dismissed. The aggregator makes at most  {{math|log&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;(''N'')}} mistakes.&lt;ref name=ref2&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/academic/class/15859-f11/www/notes/lecture16.pdf |format=PDF |title= The Multiplicative Weights Algorithm* |access-date=2016-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weighted majority algorithm&lt;ref name=ref4 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ref5&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall13/cos521/lecnotes/lec8.pdf |format=PDF |title= Lecture 8: Decision-making under total uncertainty: the multiplicative weight algorithm |date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;===

Unlike halving algorithm which dismisses experts who have made mistakes, weighted majority algorithm discounts their advice. Given the same "expert advice" setup, suppose we have n decisions, and we need to select one decision for each loop. In each loop, every decision incurs a cost. All costs will be revealed after making the choice. The cost is 0 if the expert is correct, and 1 otherwise. this algorithm's goal is to limit its cumulative losses to roughly the same as the best of experts.
The very first algorithm that makes choice based on majority vote every iteration does not work since the majority of the experts can be wrong consistently every time. The weighted majority algorithm corrects above trivial algorithm by keeping a weight of experts instead of fixing the cost at either 1 or 0.&lt;ref name=ref4 /&gt; This would make fewer mistakes compared to halving algorithm.

    '''Initialization''': 
       Fix an &lt;math&gt;\eta \le 1/2&lt;/math&gt;. For each expert, associate the weight &lt;math&gt;{w_i}^1&lt;/math&gt;≔1.
    '''For''' &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\mathit{1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathit{2}&lt;/math&gt;,…,&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;
       '''1'''. Make the prediction that is the weighted majority of the experts' predictions based on the weights &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{w_1}^t,..., \mathbb{w_n}^t&lt;/math&gt;. That is, making a binary choice depending on which prediction has a higher total weight of experts advising it (breaking ties arbitrarily). 
       '''2'''. For every expert i who predicts wrongly, decrease his weight for the next round by multiplying it by a factor of (1-η):
                                                              &lt;math&gt;w_{i}^{t+1}&lt;/math&gt;=&lt;math&gt;(1-\eta) w_{i}^{t}&lt;/math&gt; (update rule)

If &lt;math&gt;\eta =0&lt;/math&gt;, the weight of the expert's advice will remain the same. When &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; increases, the weight of the expert's advice will decrease. Note that some researchers fix &lt;math&gt;\eta =1/2&lt;/math&gt; in weighted majority algorithm.

After &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; steps, let &lt;math&gt;m_i^T&lt;/math&gt; be the number of mistakes of expert i and &lt;math&gt;M^T&lt;/math&gt; be the number of mistakes our algorithm has made. Then we have the following bound for every &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;:

                              &lt;math&gt;M^T \leq 2(1+\eta) m_i^T+ \frac{2 \ln(n)}{\eta}&lt;/math&gt;.

In particular, this holds for i which is the best expert. Since the best expert will have the least &lt;math&gt;m_i^T&lt;/math&gt;, it will give the best bound on the number of mistakes made by the algorithm as a whole.

===Randomized weighted majority algorithm&lt;ref name=ref2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ref6&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr06/cos511/scribe_notes/0330.pdf |format=PDF |title=COS 511: Foundations of Machine Learning |date=20 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;===
Given the same setup with N experts. Consider the special situation where the proportions of experts predicting positive and negative, counting the weights, are both close to 50%. Then, there might be a tie. Following the weight update rule in weighted majority algorithm, the predictions made by the algorithm would be randomized. The algorithm calculates the probabilities of experts predicting positive or negatives, and then makes a random decision based on the computed fraction:

predict  
:&lt;math&gt;
f(x) = \begin{cases}1 &amp; \text{with probability} \frac{q_1}{W}\\0 &amp; \text{otherwise}\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

where    
                &lt;math&gt;W= \sum_{i} { w_i} = q_0 + q_1&lt;/math&gt;.

The number of mistakes made by the randomized weighted majority algorithm is bounded as: 
                 &lt;math&gt;E\left [ \# \text{mistakes of the learner} \right ] \leq \alpha_\beta \left ( \# \text{ mistakes of the best expert} \right ) + c_\beta \ln(N) &lt;/math&gt;

where     &lt;math&gt;\alpha_\beta= \frac{\ln(\frac{1}{\beta})}{1-\beta}&lt;/math&gt; and          &lt;math&gt;c_\beta=\frac{1}{1-\beta}&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that only the learning algorithm is randomized. The underlying assumption is that the examples and experts' predictions are not random. The only randomness is the randomness where the learner makes his own prediction.
In this randomized algorithm, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_\beta \rightarrow 1&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\beta \rightarrow 1&lt;/math&gt;. Compared to weighted algorithm, this randomness halved the number of mistakes the algorithm is going to make.&lt;ref name=ref7 /&gt; However, it is important to note that in some research, people define &lt;math&gt;\eta =1/2&lt;/math&gt; in weighted majority algorithm and allow &lt;math&gt;0\leq \eta \leq 1&lt;/math&gt; in [[randomized weighted majority algorithm]].&lt;ref name=ref2 /&gt;

==Applications==
The multiplicative weights method is usually used to solve a constrained optimization problem. Let each expert be the constraint in the problem, and the events represent the points in the area of interest. The punishment of the expert corresponds to how well its corresponding constraint is satisfied on the point represented by an event.&lt;ref name=ref1 /&gt;

===Solving zero-sum games approximately (Oracle algorithm):&lt;ref name=ref1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ref4 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ref7&gt;{{cite web |url= https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-409-topics-in-theoretical-computer-science-an-algorithmists-toolkit-fall-2009/lecture-notes/MIT18_409F09_scribe24.pdfformat=PDF |title= An Algorithmist's Toolkit |date=8 December 2009 |access-date=2016-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;===

Suppose we were given the distribution &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; on experts. Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; = payoff matrix of a finite two-player zero-sum game, with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; rows.

When the row player &lt;math&gt;p_r&lt;/math&gt; uses plan &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and the column player &lt;math&gt;p_c&lt;/math&gt; uses plan &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;, the payoff of player &lt;math&gt;p_c&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;A \left ( i, j \right)&lt;/math&gt;≔&lt;math&gt;A_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;, assuming &lt;math&gt;A \left( i, j\right ) \in \left [ 0, 1 \right ]&lt;/math&gt;.

If player &lt;math&gt;p_r&lt;/math&gt; chooses action &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; from a distribution &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; over the rows, then the expected result for player &lt;math&gt;p_c&lt;/math&gt; selecting action &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;A \left (P, j \right )=E_{i \in P} \left [A \left(i,j \right) \right]&lt;/math&gt;.

To maximize &lt;math&gt;A \left (P, j \right)&lt;/math&gt;, player &lt;math&gt;p_c&lt;/math&gt; is should choose plan &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, the expected payoff for player &lt;math&gt;p_l&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;A \left (i,P\right )=E_{j\in P} \left [A \left(i,j \right) \right ]&lt;/math&gt;. Choosing plan &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; would minimize this payoff. By John Von Neumann's Min-Max Theorem, we obtain:

                                           &lt;math&gt;\min_P \max_j A\left( P, j \right) = \max_Q \min_i A\left( i, Q \right) &lt;/math&gt;
where P and i changes over the distributions over rows, Q and j changes over the columns.

Then, let &lt;math&gt;\lambda^*&lt;/math&gt; denote the common value of above quantities, also named as the "value of the game". Let &lt;math&gt;\delta&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; be an error parameter. To solve the zero-sum game bounded by additive error of &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;,

                                                  &lt;math&gt;\lambda^* - \delta \leq \min_i  A \left (i,q \right ) &lt;/math&gt;
                                                  &lt;math&gt;\max_j A \left(p, j \right) \leq \lambda^* +\delta &lt;/math&gt;

So there is an algorithm solving zero-sum game up to an additive factor of δ using O({{math|log&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'')}}/&lt;math&gt;\delta^2&lt;/math&gt;) calls to ORACLE, with an additional processing time of O(n) per call&lt;ref name =ref7 /&gt;

===Machine learning===
In machine learning, Littlestone and Warmuth generalized the winnow algorithm to the weighted majority algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;DEAN P. FOSTER AND RAKESH VOHRA (1999). ''Regret in the on-line decision problem'', p. 29. Games and Economic Behaviour&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Freund and Schapire generalized it in the form of hedge algorithm.&lt;ref name=ref8 /&gt; AdaBoost Algorithm formulated by Yoav Freund and Robert Schapire also employed the Multiplicative Weight Update Method.&lt;ref name=ref4 /&gt;

====Winnow algorithm====
Based on current knowledge in algorithms, multiplicative weight update method was first used in Littlestone's winnow algorithm.&lt;ref name=ref4 /&gt; It is used in machine learning to solve a linear program.

Given &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; labeled examples &lt;math&gt; \left (a_1, l_1 \right ),\text{…} ,\left (a_m, l_m \right ) &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;a_j \in \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; are feature vectors, and &lt;math&gt;l_j \in \left \{-1,1 \right \} \quad&lt;/math&gt; are their labels.

The aim is to find non-negative weights such that for all examples, the sign of the weighted combination of the features matches its labels. That is, require that &lt;math&gt;l_j a_j x \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;. Without loss of generality, assume the total weight is 1 so that they form a distribution. Thus, for notational convenience, redefine &lt;math&gt;a_j&lt;/math&gt; to be &lt;math&gt;l_j a_j&lt;/math&gt;, the problem reduces to finding a solution to the following LP:

                      &lt;math&gt;\forall j=1,2,\text{…}, m : a_j x \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;,
                      &lt;math&gt;1*x=1&lt;/math&gt;,
                      &lt;math&gt;\forall i : x_i \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;.

This is general form of LP.

====Hedge algorithm &lt;ref name=ref2 /&gt;====
The hedge algorithm is similar to the weighted majority algorithm. However, their exponential update rules are different.&lt;ref name=ref2 /&gt;
It is generally used to solve the problem of binary allocation in which we need to allocate different portion of resources into N different options. The loss with every option is available at the end of every iteration. The goal is to reduce the total loss suffered for a particular allocation. The allocation for the following iteration is then revised, based on the total loss suffered in the current iteration using multiplicative update.&lt;ref name=ref16&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shivani-agarwal.net/Teaching/E0370/Aug-2011/Lectures/20-scribe1.pdf |format=PDF |title= Online Learning from Experts: Weighed Majority and Hedge |access-date=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Analysis=====
Assume the learning rate &lt;math&gt;\eta &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and for &lt;math&gt;t \in [T]&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p^t&lt;/math&gt; is picked by Hedge. Then for all experts &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;,

                                 &lt;math&gt;\sum_{t \leq T} p^t m^t \leq \sum_{t \leq T} m^t +\frac{\ln(N)}{\eta}+\eta T&lt;/math&gt;

'''Initialization''': Fix an &lt;math&gt;\eta &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;. For each expert, associate the weight &lt;math&gt;w_i^1&lt;/math&gt; ≔1

       1. Pick the distribution &lt;math&gt;p_i^t= \frac{w_i^t}{\Phi t}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\Phi t=\sum_i w_i^t&lt;/math&gt;.

====AdaBoost algorithm====

[[AdaBoost|This algorithm]]&lt;ref name=ref8&gt;Yoav, Freund. Robert, E. Schapire (1996). ''TA Decision-Theoretic Generalization of On-Line Learning and an Application to Boosting*'', p. 55. journal of computer and system sciences.&lt;/ref&gt; maintains a set of weights &lt;math&gt;w^t&lt;/math&gt; over the training examples. On every iteration &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, a distribution &lt;math&gt;p^t&lt;/math&gt; is computed by normalizing these weights. This distribution is fed to the weak learner WeakLearn which generates a hypothesis &lt;math&gt;h_t&lt;/math&gt; that (hopefully) has small error with respect to the distribution. Using the new hypothesis &lt;math&gt;h_t&lt;/math&gt;, AdaBoost generates the next weight vector &lt;math&gt;w^{t+1}&lt;/math&gt;. The process repeats. After T such iterations, the final hypothesis &lt;math&gt;h_f&lt;/math&gt; is the output. The hypothesis &lt;math&gt;h_f&lt;/math&gt; combines the outputs of the T weak hypotheses using a weighted majority vote.&lt;ref name=ref8 /&gt;

====Problem====
Given a &lt;math&gt;m \times n&lt;/math&gt; matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b \in \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, is there a &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;A x \geq b&lt;/math&gt;?

                       &lt;math&gt;\exists ? x: A x \geq b &lt;/math&gt;              (1)

====Assumption====
Using the oracle algorithm in solving zero-sum problem, with an error parameter &lt;math&gt; \epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, the output would either be a point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;A x \geq b-\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; or a proof that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; does not exist, i.e., there is no solution to this linear system of inequalities.

====solution====
Given vector &lt;math&gt;p \in \Delta_n&lt;/math&gt;, solves the following relaxed problem

                      &lt;math&gt;\exists ? x: p^{\textsf T}\!\!A x\geq p^\textsf{T}\!b&lt;/math&gt;             (2)

If there exists a x satisfying (1), then x satisfies (2) for all &lt;math&gt; p\in \Delta_n&lt;/math&gt;. The contrapositive of this statement is also true.
Suppose if oracle returns a feasible solution for a &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, the solution &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; it returns has bounded width &lt;math&gt;\max_i |{(A x)}_i - b_i | \leq 1&lt;/math&gt;.
So if there is a solution to (1), then there is an algorithm that its output x satisfies the system (2) up to an additive error of &lt;math&gt;2\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;. The algorithm makes at most &lt;math&gt;\frac{\ln(m)}{\epsilon^2}&lt;/math&gt; calls to a width-bounded oracle for the problem (2). The contrapositive stands true as well. The multiplicative updates is applied in the algorithm in this case.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10016">Nearly 78 years have passed since Paul L. Dysart, Jr. invented the Negative Volume Index and Positive Volume Index indicators. The indicators remain useful to identify primary market trends and reversals.

In 1936, Paul L. Dysart, Jr. began accumulating two series of advances and declines distinguished by whether volume was greater or lesser than the prior day's volume. He called the cumulative series for the days when volume had been greater than the prior day's volume the Positive Volume Index (PVI), and the series for the days when volume had been lesser the Negative Volume Index (NVI).

A native of Iowa, Dysart worked in Chicago's LaSalle Street during the 1920s. After giving up his [[Chicago Board of Trade]] membership, he published an advisory letter geared to short-term trading using advance-decline data. In 1933, he launched the ''Trendway'' weekly stock market letter and published it until 1969 when he died. Dysart also developed the 25-day Plurality Index, the 25-day total of the absolute difference between the number of advancing issues and the number of declining issues, and was a pioneer in using several types of volume of trading studies. Richard Russell, editor of Dow Theory Letters, in his January 7, 1976 letter called Dysart "one of the most brilliant of the pioneer market technicians."

==Dysart’s NVI and PVI==
The daily volume of the [[New York Stock Exchange]] and the NYSE Composite Index's advances and declines drove Dysart's indicators. Dysart believed that “volume is the driving force in the market.” He began studying market breadth numbers in 1931, and was familiar with the work of Leonard P. Ayres and James F. Hughes, who pioneered the tabulation of advances and declines to interpret stock market movements.

Dysart calculated NVI as follows: 1) if today's volume is less than yesterday's volume, subtract declines from advances, 2) add the difference to the cumulative NVI beginning at zero, and 3) retain the current NVI reading for the days when volume is greater than the prior day's volume. He calculated PVI in the same manner but for the days when volume was greater than the prior day's volume. NVI and PVI can be calculated daily or weekly.

Initially, Dysart believed that PVI would be the more useful series, but in 1967, he wrote that NVI had “proved to be the most valuable of all the breadth indexes.” He relied most on NVI, naming it AMOMET, the acronym of “'''A''' '''M'''easure '''O'''f '''M'''ajor '''E'''conomic '''T'''rend.”

Dysart's theory, expressed in his 1967 Barron's article, was that “if volume advances and prices move up or down in accordance [with volume], the move is assumed to be a good movement - if it is sustained when the volume subsides.” In other words, after prices have moved up on positive volume days, "if prices stay up when the volume subsides for a number of days, we can say that such a move is 'good'." If the market “holds its own on negative volume days after advancing on positive volume, the market is in a strong position.”

He called PVI the “majority” curve. Dysart distinguished between the actions of the “majority” and those of the “minority.” The majority tends to emulate the minority, but its timing is not as sharp as that of the minority. When the majority showed an appetite for stocks, the PVI was usually “into new high ground” as happened in 1961.

It is said that the two indicators assume that "smart" money is traded on quiet days (low volume) and that the crowd trades on very active days. Therefore, the negative volume index picks out days when the volume is lower than on the previous day, and the positive index picks out days with a higher volume.

==Dysart’s Interpretation of NVI and PVI==
Besides an article he wrote for Barron's in 1967, not many of Dysart's writings are available. What can be interpreted about Dysart's NVI is that whenever it rises above a prior high, and the DJIA is trending up, a “Bull Market Signal” is given. When the NVI falls below a prior low, and the DJIA is trending down, a “Bear Market Signal” is given. The PVI is interpreted in reverse.
However, not all movements above or below a prior NVI or PVI level generate signals, as Dysart also designated “bullish” and “bearish penetrations.” These penetrations could occur before or after a Bull or Bear Market Signal, and at times were called “reaffirmations” of a signal. In 1969, he articulated one rule: “signals are most authentic when the NVI has moved sideways for a number of months in a relatively narrow range.” Dysart cautioned that “there is no mathematical system devoid of judgment which will continuously work without error in the stock market.”

According to Dysart, between 1946 and 1967, the NVI “rendered 17 significant signals,” of which 14 proved to be right (an average of 4.32% from the final high or low) and 3 wrong (average loss of 6.33%). However, NVI “seriously erred” in 1963-1964 and in 1968, which concerned him. In 1969, Dysart reduced the weight he had previously given to the NVI in his analyses because NVI was no longer a “decisive” indicator of the primary trend, although it retained an “excellent ability to give us ‘leading’ indications of short-term trend reversals.”

A probable reason for the NVI losing its efficacy during the mid-1960s may have been the steadily higher NYSE daily volume due to the dramatic increase in the number of issues traded so that prices rose on declining volume. Dysart’s NVI topped out in 1955 and trended down until at least 1968, although the DJIA moved higher during that period.
Norman G. Fosback has attributed the “long term increase in the number of issues traded” as a reason for a downward bias in a cumulative advance-decline line. Fosback was the next influential technician in the story of NVI and PVI.

==Fosback’s Variations==
Fosback studied NVI and PVI and in 1976 reported his findings in his classic Stock Market Logic. He did not elucidate on the indicators’ background or mentioned Dysart except for saying that “in the past Negative Volume Indexes have always [his emphasis] been constructed using advance-decline data….” He posited, “There is no good reason for this fixation on the A/D Line. In truth, a Negative Volume Index can be calculated with any market index - the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&amp;P 500, or even ‘unweighted’ market measures.... Somehow this point has escaped the attention of technicians to date.”

The point had not been lost on Dysart, who wrote in Barron’s, “we prefer to use the issues-traded data [advances and declines] rather than the price data of any average because it is more all-encompassing, and more truly represents what’s happening in the entire market.” Dysart was a staunch proponent of using advances and declines.

Fosback made three variations to NVI and PVI:

1. He cumulated the daily percent change in the market index rather than the difference between advances and declines. On negative volume days, he calculated the price change in the index from the prior day and added it to the most recent NVI. His calculations are as follows:

If C&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; denote the closing prices of today and yesterday, respectively, the NVI for today is calculated by

* adding NVI&lt;sub&gt;yesterday&lt;/sub&gt; (C&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; - C&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;) / C&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; to yesterday's NVI if today's volume is lower than yesterday's, adding zero otherwise,

and the PVI is calculated by:

* adding PVI&lt;sub&gt;yesterday&lt;/sub&gt; (C&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; - C&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;) / C&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; to yesterday's PVI if today's volume is higher than yesterday's, adding zero otherwise.

2. He suggested starting the cumulative count at a base index level such as 100.

3. He derived buy or sell signals by whether the NVI or PVI was above or below its one-year moving average.

Fosback's versions of NVI and PVI are what are popularly described in books and posted on Internet financial sites. Often reported are his findings that whenever NVI is above its one-year [[moving average (finance)|moving average]] there is a 96% (PVI - 79%) probability that a bull market is in progress, and when it is below its one-year moving average, there is a 53% (PVI - 67%) probability that a bear market is in place. These results were derived using a 1941-1975 test period. Modern tests might reveal different probabilities.

Today, NVI and PVI are commonly associated with Fosback's versions, and Dysart, their inventor, is forgotten. It cannot be said that one version is better than the other. While Fosback provided a more objective interpretation of these indicators, Dysart's versions offer value to identify primary trends and short-term trend reversals.

Although some traders use Fosback's NVI and PVI to analyze individual stocks, the indicators were created to track, and have been tested, on major market indexes. NVI was Dysart's most invaluable breadth index, and Fosback found that his version of “the Negative Volume Index is an excellent indicator of the primary market trend.” Traders can benefit from both innovations.

{{Humanism}}
'''Neohumanism''' is a [[Holism|holistic]] [[philosophical theory]] proposed by [[Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar]] to promote [[individual]] and [[collective]] progress. In this philosophy [[universalism]] plays a central role. It claims to elevate humanism to level of universalism.&lt;ref name=dis1&gt;''When the underlying spirit of humanism is extended to everything, animate and inanimate, in this universe – I have designated this as "neohumanism". This neohumanism will elevate humanism to universalism, the cult of love for all created beings of this universe.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Devotional Sentiment and Neohumanism (Discourse 1)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It claims not to have any grouping intention.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==History==
Sarkar detailed Neohumanism in his 1982 book ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''.{{r|dis1}}

In 1987, Sarkar published ''Neohumanism in a Nutshell'' (parts 1 and 2). They contain more discourses on Neohumanism, from various times that he discussed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ampublications.org/product-detail.php?proid=33&amp;mode=addtocart|title=Neo- Humanism in a Nutshell - 1|publisher=Ananda Marga|accessdate=15 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304093145/http://ampublications.org/product-detail.php?proid=33&amp;mode=addtocart|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ampublications.org/product-detail.php?proid=34|title=Neo- Humanism in a Nutshell - 2|publisher=Ananda Marga|accessdate=15 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304101630/http://ampublications.org/product-detail.php?proid=34|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
Neohumanism has three stages of development.&lt;ref name="Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan 1982"&gt;Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Neohumanism Is the Ultimate Shelter (Discourse 11)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first stage of Neohumanism is spiritual practice to enhance the physical, mental, and spiritual well-being of the practitioner. The stage of spiritual practice indirectly benefits society through the social service that is part of spiritual practice.
* The second stage of Neohumanism is spiritual principle (or essence). Its impact is mainly in the mental and spiritual realms, both individual and collective. According to Neohumanism, practice of [[#Rationality|rationality]] and adherence to the [[#Social equality|principle of social equality]] (especially when combined with [[#Protopsychospirituality|protospiritualistic mentality]]) will not only strengthen individual minds but also the collective human mind to the point that humanity as a whole can withstand the destructive impact of [[#Geosentiment|geosentiment]] and [[#Sociosentiment|sociosentiment]] and the ruthless exploiters who capitalize on those sentiments.
* {{anchor|stage3}}The third and final stage of Neohumanism is spiritual mission. According to Neohumanism, when an individual's existential nucleus (soul) merges with the "Cosmic Existential Nucleus", she/he attains the consummation of her/his existence. Neohumanism asserts that this supreme status ensures the future of not only the human world but also of the animal and plant worlds as well.

== Concepts ==
List of Neohumanism's key concepts in alphabetical order.

=== Devotion ===
According to neohumanism, love for the Supreme (devotion) is the highest and most valuable treasure of humanity. It automatically results in [[#Universalism|universalism]]. However, neohumanism deems devotion to be a very tender inner asset, frequently assailed by materialism and other onslaughts from the external world. To preserve this treasure, Sarkar submits neohumanism as a practical philosophy that provides a protective fence for devotion by (1) establishing harmony between the spiritual and material worlds (2) providing perennial inspiration for the onward march of society.{{r|dis1}}

=== Dogma ===
Neohumanism defines [[dogma]] as a mental prison. In other words, a dogma is any concept (belief) that one is expected to accept without question. Neohumanism perceives such conduct as fundamentally contrary to [[#Humanity|human nature]], which includes a constant quest for mental expansion. Hence, the position of neohumanism on dogma is that all dogma must be eradicated.&lt;ref name=dis2&gt;''The snares of dogma will have to be shattered to pieces; the iron prison gates of dogma will have to be crushed to dust.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Bondages and Solutions (Discourse 2)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exploitation ===
Neohumanism discourages both [[#Geosentiment|geosentiment]] and [[#Sociosentiment|sociosentiment]], because both tend to be injurious to society. However, neohumanism observes that, of the two, sociosentiment is more pernicious. Under the influence of sociosentiment, one group of people are driven to exploit a second group of people, that second group of people are driven to exploit a third group of people, and so on.&lt;ref name=dis7&gt;''Now, in sociosentiment, it happens that a certain group exploits another, and that exploited group in turn exploits a third.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Exploitation and Pseudoculture (Discourse 7)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Neohumanism, there are many types of exploitation, but exploitation always tends to come down to the economic plane. Economic exploitation manifests itself in two forms:
* '''Politico-economic exploitation''' occurs when an [[Imperialism|imperialist]] nation or group engages in economic exploitation through the use of brute force to impose direct political control over another nation or group. For example, under the [[British Empire]], the United Kingdom variously ruled the nations it conquered through three political mechanisms: [[wikt:direct rule|direct rule]], [[viceroy]]s, and [[Governor-General|governor-generals]].
* {{anchor|psycho-economic_exploitation}}'''Psycho-economic exploitation''' occurs when direct political control is not or is no longer feasible (often due to [[military logistics]]). At such times, the imperialist nation or group engages in economic exploitation by injecting fear and inferiority complexes in the minds of the people that they would [[Colonialism|colonize]].

A common name for psycho-economic exploitation is [[neocolonialism]]. However, Neohumanism observes that there is nothing new about psycho-economic exploitation. Wherever politico-economic exploitation takes place, it is invariably accompanied by psychic exploitation, the goal of which being to make the colonized people more docile. In other words, according to Neohumanism, in both politico-economic exploitation and psycho-economic exploitation, psychic exploitation is the foundation.{{r|dis7}} Neohumanism asserts that when politico-economic exploitation is combined with psycho-economic exploitation, the likely social devastation is much greater.{{r|dis7}}

==== Exploiters ====
In nature, there is a [[mainstream]], and there is also positive and negative deviation from the mainstream. This is true for all species of living beings. Neohumanism classifies this deviation for plants, animals, and humans. When a living being substantially deviates from the mainstream in a constructive fashion, neohumanism describes that being as ''remarkable'', ''good'', or ''blissful'' (depending on whether the structure of that being is of a plant, animal, or human respectively). Conversely, when a living being substantially deviates from the mainstream in a destructive fashion, neohumanism describes that being as ''notorious'', ''bad'', or ''demonic'' (depending on whether the structure of that being is of a plant, animal, or human respectively).{{r|dis10}} In respect to exploitation, our main concern is with human structures, specifically those human structures with [[genius]] that is exercised for destructive purpose, ''demons in human form/framework'' (DHFs).

DHFs are geniuses, and so they are exceptionally devious. They know how to pander to and play on the [[#Geosentiment|geosentiments]] and [[#Sociosentiment|sociosentiments]] of the common people, who rarely think deeply. But truth does not remain hidden forever. So whenever a particular abuse of geosentiment or sociosentiment is about to get exposed or that particular geosentiment or sociosentiment is likely to lose popularity, DHFs switch to a different sentiment. Neohumanism designates the adaptive art of conveniently switching sentiments as ''metamorphosed sentimental strategy''.{{r|dis10}}

According to neohumanism, DHFs wreak great havoc upon this world.{{r|dis10}} Because of their adeptness at metamorphosed sentimental strategy, Sarkar also sometimes refers to DHFs as ''human chameleons''. Like chameleons, DHFs are often very difficult to spot. Nevertheless, Sarkar insists that it is the duty of all neohumanists to identify the DHFs. Not only must neohumanists identify the DHFs, but they must also expose them.{{r|dis10}}

=== Humanism (general) ===
According to neohumanism, the radius of geosentiment and sociosentiment may be relatively short or long. In other words, they both have a minimal and maximal expression (geosentiment or sociosentiment ''minimitis'' and ''maximitis''). With respect to sociosentiment, its minimal expression (''sociosentiment minimitis'') is the attraction felt toward one's nuclear family. That minimal sociosentiment may be extended to embrace a larger community, for example, a city, a state, a nation, an ethnicity, a religious group, and so on. When sociosentiment extends beyond [[nationalism]] and [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]], theoretically embracing all human beings, that is ''sociosentiment maximitis''. According to Sarkar, general (or ordinary) humanism is essentially '''sociosentiment maximitis'''.&lt;ref name="Now 1982"&gt;''Now, this sociosentiment, in its stage of excellencio or in theory maximitis, is called "humanism." Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Pseudohumanism (Discourse 8)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pseudohumanism ====
Neohumanism is of the view that general or ordinary humanism is a distorted humanism that has done and is still doing harm in the world. According to neohumanism, in so far as humanism expanded sociosentiment, it was a positive trend; but in so far as it sets limits on the expansion of the underlying spirit of humanism, [[love]], it has been and continues to be counterproductive.

According to neohumanism, there is a tendency for general humanists to substitute [[pity]] for love. Sarkar said this type of '''pseudohumanism''' inevitably fosters '''intra-human conflict'''.

=== Humanity ===
Neohumanism rejects the classic definition of human being as "[[rational animal]]", which first appeared in [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' insisting that human beings have characteristics distinct from [[animal]]s. It considers human [[life]] to be an [[Ideology|ideological]] flow,{{subst:technical language}} characterized by identification with and commitment to an ideology.&lt;ref name=glory&gt;Shrii Shrii Anandamurti, "The Glory of Human Dharma", 21 February 1979, Bhopal. Published in ''Ananda Vacanamrtam Part 8'', Ananda Marga Publications, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inspiration (motivation) ===
According to neohumanism, the impetus (inspiration or motivation) for human movement - human dynamism - may be either of two conflicting [[principle]]s: the principle of selfish pleasure (''átma-sukha tattva'') or the principle of social equality (''sama-samája tattva'').

==== Selfish pleasure ====
According to neohumanism, selfishness is a socially divisive mental ailment. Those who promote or accept the [[#Dogma|dogmas]] founded on the principle of selfish pleasure typically do so in order to secure their own vested interests.&lt;ref&gt;''All the social, economic and geographical forces that normally motivate human beings are guided by dogma; and this dogma in its turn is entirely based on átma-sukha tattva [the principle of selfish pleasure]. Human beings yield to this dogma with the sole intention of attaining selfish pleasures; even educated people knowingly submit to dogma.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Sama-Samája Tattva (Discourse 6)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Social equality ====
The concept of [[egalitarianism]] has been in circulation for thousands of years. Over time, the concept has become broader and more sophisticated. Recently, various studies have been conducted with results that endorse the tremendous importance of having a more equitable society (see, for example, ''[[The Spirit Level: Why More Equal Societies Almost Always Do Better]]'' by [[Richard G. Wilkinson]] and [[Kate Pickett]]). Neohumanism promotes egalitarianism by asserting the principle of social equality and rejecting all [[#Dogma|dogma]] and [[superstition]].&lt;ref&gt;''The endeavor to advance towards the ultimate reality by forming a society free from all inequalities, with everyone of the human race moving in unison, is called sama-samája tattva [the principle of social equality]... We must totally reject all those hypocritical ideas which are contrary to this sama-samája tattva, and we must welcome all those ideas which will help human beings to be established in it. All opposing theories must be removed mercilessly, just like thorns from our path. And in this process we must not give indulgence to any dogmas or supernatural ideas. This should be the task of today’s human beings; all people should combine their efforts and strive unitedly to accomplish that end.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Sama-Samája Tattva (Discourse 6)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to neohumanism, realization of the principle of social equality is a natural consequence of spiritual practice (especially meditation founded on yogic [[morality]], '''Yama-Niyama'''&lt;ref&gt;Shrii Shrii Anandamurti, ''A Guide to Human Conduct''. Fourth Paperback Edition, 2004, Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|9788172521035}}.&lt;/ref&gt;). However, realization of this principle is not the final stage of neohumanism, because application of a principle is somewhat mechanical. In the final stage of neohumanism, the human being's life is transformed into a blissful mission of love (see the [[#stage3|third stage of neohumanism]]).

=== Internationalism ===
Many general humanists support the concept of [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]]. Neohumanism observes that internationalism does not even rise to the standard of [[#Humanism (general)|ordinary humanism]]. Indeed, it poses the same sort of risk to global peace as nationalism. Sarkar explains the problem as follows:

{{Quote|''Suppose I was working for a particular nation, but now I am working for all nations. When I admit the existence of nations and say that I am working for all nations, then it is neither humanism nor universalism – it is merely internationalism. When I use the term "internationalism", I am admitting the existence of separate nations, and along with this I must naturally also think, within the nations, of the people's five fundamental requirements of life (food, clothes, education, shelter, and medical care). But when I discover that one nation is trying to thrive on the life-blood of another, I oppose it, and this opposition ultimately leads to world war. So internationalism is not the solution either.''&lt;ref name="Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan 1982"/&gt;}}

From the perspective of neohumanism, the [[League of Nations]] could not prevent [[World War II]], and the [[United Nations]] cannot prevent a World War III. Only a [[world government]] could ensure peace on this planet.

=== Mental illness ===
According to neohumanism, the major cause of mental disorder is a lack of harmony between the rhythm and speed of the inner world and the outer world. In modern times, humanity has made great progress in the intellectual sphere. But, for most people, the speed of that intellectual progress is not well reflected in the external world (for example, a rising standard of living). Similarly, the patterns of thought for most persons (their internal psychic rhythm) is quite different from the external rhythm of the objective world. These disparities naturally cause clash, and that clash is felt even more in the psychic realm than the physical realm. Neohumanism asserts that this is the reason why many human beings lose their mental balance.{{r|dis1}}

=== Mental modes ===
According to neohumanism, in addition to various activities like [[Thought|thinking]] and [[Recall (memory)|remembering]], mind has three modes of functioning: ''[[instinct]]'', ''sentiment'', and ''[[rationality]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Geo-Sentiment (Discourse 3)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Anopheles stephensi.jpeg|thumb|200px|Mosquitoes suck blood instinctively.]]
* '''Instinct''': The position of neohumanism on ''[[instinct]]'' is somewhat [[Convention (norm)|conventional]]. All living beings, developed and undeveloped, have innate instincts. Many if not most such instincts incite behavior that increases the likelihood of [[self-preservation]] of an organism or a species. So, for example, mosquitoes suck blood, and human babies drink their mother's milk. Neohumanism takes note of the fact that life feeds on life,&lt;ref&gt;''It is true that living creatures are the food for other living beings (jiivah jiivasya bhojanam); and indeed, the vegetables that we eat every day also have living cells in them.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Devotional Sentiment and Neohumanism (Discourse 1)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but insists that human beings must employ [[rationality]] in the selection of food.&lt;ref&gt;''Once I read in a certain book that a great saint used to live only on locusts dipped in honey. That saint did not seriously consider that those little locusts also had vital life force throbbing in them... This concern for the vital rhythm throbbing in other human creatures has driven people to the fold of humanism, has made them humanists. Now, if the same human sentiment is extended to include all creatures of this universe, then and only then can human existence be said to have attained its final consummation.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Devotional Sentiment and Neohumanism (Discourse 1)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In short, neohumanism recognizes the fact that human beings are motivated to some extent by instinct, but neohumanism expects human beings to rely more on rationality so that any needlessly destructive impact of instinct (and sentiment) is curtailed.
* {{anchor|sentiment}}'''Sentiment''': Regarding ''sentiment'', neohumanism broadens the perspective. According to neohumanism, undeveloped minds operate only on instinct; whereas, in more developed minds (including human minds), sentiment also functions and tends to exceed instinct. Goaded by sentiment, mind runs blindly after what it likes (or away from what it does not like). A sentimental being does not ask questions about propriety or even employ common sense. Accordingly, sentiment poses the risk that an irrational course of action may be adopted - a course of action that could destroy not just the sentimental individual but also an entire family or social group.
* '''Discrimination''': Discrimination occurs when a conscious decision is taken regarding the appropriate course of action. A tiger stalks its prey and attacks from a selected vantage point. This is discrimination. A robber enters a house and calculates which room to plunder first, based on most likely gain. This is discrimination. A reasoned decision regarding pros and cons is taken. When discrimination goes one step further, considering a choice between right and wrong (proper and improper), then conscience ([[viveka]]) is invoked. At that point, discrimination rises to the level of [[#Rationality|rationality]]. Compared to instinct and sentiment, discrimination is a slow process. It takes more time to exercise discrimination.

=== Protopsychospirituality ===
Protopsychospirituality (also known as ''protospiritualistic mentality'') is a type of thinking whereby one remembers that everything and everyone with whom one comes in contact is a manifestation of Supreme Consciousness (''Parama Brahma''). Before and after doing any action, if one remembers that all existential phenomena emanate from and return to the Supreme (Cosmic) Existential Nucleus, a benevolent mode of thinking naturally arises within the mind. In that state of mind, one cannot contemplate doing harm to others. Neohumanism asserts that a protospiritualistic mentality is essential for identifying some exceptionally devious [[#Exploiters|exploiters]]. Identification becomes possible when the person with a protospiritualistic mentality notes that her/his benevolent mode of thinking is not reflected in the actions of the exploiter.{{r|dis10}}

=== Pseudoculture ===
[[Culture]] generally refers to the refinements in human expressions. Everyone eats. However, to eat only after washing one's hands is commonly deemed to be part of the ''culture'' of eating. According to neohumanism, human culture is one, but there are variations in its expression. For example, humans, being social creatures, typically like to communicate; but, depending on locality, different languages are used. Neohumanism observes that whenever one group of people has sought to economically exploit another group of people, the former group simultaneously attempted to destroy the local cultural expressions of the latter group. This has been done through the imposition of ''pseudoculture''. Examples of the imposition of pseudoculture are the forced acceptance of an imperialist ruler's language, religious dogma, style of dress, style of eating, political forms, historical perspectives, and artistic expressions.

Pseudoculture is imposed by various means from brute force to the mass media to public education. Often, the standard of refinement in pseudoculture is less than that which it replaces. But regardless of the standard of refinement, the end result is that the cultural backbone of the colonized society is broken. Psychologically crippled, the colonized people lose the will and the power to protest against exploitation. Instead, they tend to deem it just and proper to hand over much of their national wealth to the exploiters.&lt;ref&gt;''This exploitation in the cultural sphere is accomplished by the propagation of pseudoculture. Every honest, virtuous, rational person must fight against this pseudoculture, and inspire others to do the same. If this is not done, the future of humanity will be sealed. It is proper for human beings to struggle for political freedom, for social emancipation; but if their cultural backbone is broken, then all their struggles will end in nothing – like offering ghee into a fire that has died out.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Exploitation and Pseudoculture (Discourse 7)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rationality ===
Philosophers have defined [[rationality]] in various ways. Some of those definitions could equally apply to animals or even plants. Neohumanism offers a new and precise definition of rationality that calls for a standard of mentality that is not discernible in any species other than human beings. According to neohumanism, rationality (also known as ''rationalistic mentality'') is a three-stage process of discrimination that begins with adequate study to assimilate all relevant facts, proceeds to analyze the pros and cons of an action, and ends with a decision in favor of only a ''blissful auxiliary'' (practical action that furthers the welfare of all).&lt;ref&gt;''In the first stage you study; in the second you analyze the positive and negative sides; and in the third stage you arrive at "blissful or non-blissful, auxiliary or non-auxiliary". When you complete this whole process of logical reasoning, the outcome is your "awakened conscience". This state of awakened conscience is what is called "rationalistic mentality".'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Awakened Conscience (Discourse 9)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion ===
{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote=''So in the sphere of religion also, if you look carefully, you will see that behind those who have been knowingly or unknowingly operating the machinery of exploitation, there are certain wealthy parties. Those parties want to create their satellites. In every sphere of life you will find such wealthy people in the background.''&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Exploitation and Pseudoculture (Discourse 7)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;|source=Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar}}
Throughout history, [[religion]] has had a domineering influence on the human mind. According to neohumanism, all religions are based on [[#Dogma|dogma]], and the propagation of that religious dogma has been instrumental in the creation of satellite groups. Some religious persons and priests propagate the damaging dogma of religion unwittingly. When such persons are made to understand their mistake, some admit their error and rectify themselves. Others, however, refuse to do so, fearing that the admission of error would injure their prestige. The latter group of persons thereby join the ranks of conscious agents of injustice.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[File:Geosentiment.jpg|thumb|Degrees of geosentiment (simplified expansions)]]

=== Sentiments ===
According to neohumanism, two types of sentiment are common to human beings (in both an individual and collective sense): [[#Geosentiment|geosentiment]] and [[#Sociosentiment|sociosentiment]].&lt;ref&gt;Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Bondages and Solutions (Discourse 2)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Both sentiments have a minimal and a maximal expression (geosentiment or sociosentiment ''minimitis'' and ''maximitis''). As with any [[#sentiment|sentiment]], both geosentiment and sociosentiment may have good uses, but there is also great risk of harm (harm to others and harm to oneself). Neohumanism observes that those who would exploit other human beings for their own selfish gain ([[#Exploiters|exploiters]]) typically employ these two types of sentiment, often shifting or transforming sentiments whenever convenient.

==== Geosentiment ====
Geosentiment is the attraction felt toward one's own home, city, or country. Its minimal expression (''geosentiment minimitis'') is love for one's home (house, homestead, or the like). The maximal expression of geosentiment (''geosentiment maximitis'') is love for one's country. In theory, one might feel love for the entire planet, but today such an expression of geosentiment would be very rare, possibly non-existent. In the future, when interplanetary travel becomes commonplace, geosentiment maximitis may expand.

Geosentiment presents in many forms: [[geopolitics]], [[geoeconomics]], geopatriotism, georeligion, and so on. For example, georeligion would associate a religion or a religious group with a specific territory. So, the belief that God has granted a particular territory to a particular group of people is an example of georeligion. Similarly, the belief that prayer must be carried out facing in a specific direction is another expression of georeligion. Such type of beliefs (geosentiments) may prove harmless or harmful, depending on circumstances. According to neohumanism, the potential for harm in geosentiment can be curbed through the cultivation of a [[#Rationality|rationalistic mentality]].&lt;ref&gt;Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Geosentiment (Discourse 3)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sociosentiment.jpg|thumb|Degrees of sociosentiment (simplified expansions)]]

==== Sociosentiment ====
Sociosentiment is the attraction felt toward one's own family, nation, or other social grouping (linguistic, religious, political, and so on). Its minimal expression (''sociosentiment minimitis'') is the attraction felt toward one's nuclear family. That minimal sociosentiment may be extended to embrace a larger community, for example, a city, a state, a nation, an ethnicity, a religious group, and so on. When sociosentiment extends beyond [[nationalism]] and [[#Internationalism|internationalism]], theoretically embracing all human beings, that is ''sociosentiment maximitis''. According to Sarkar, [[#Humanism (general)|general (or ordinary) humanism]] is essentially sociosentiment maximitis.&lt;ref name="Now 1982"/&gt;

Sociosentiment presents itself in many forms: [[Political sociology|sociopolitics]], [[socioeconomics]], [[Patriotism|sociopatriotism]], [[Sociology of religion|socioreligion]], and so on. For example, sociopatriotism might express itself as [[jingoism]] with declarations like "my country, right or wrong" or "my country over all others". Socioeconomics might express itself in the form of an imperialist attempt to create [[Colony|colonies]] or [[satellite states]].

Compared to [[#Geosentiment|geosentiment]], sociosentiment has the capacity to do - and has done - much greater harm in the world. Sociosentiment can also be more difficult to recognize. As such, [[#Rationality|rationality]] might not be adequate to offset the dangers of sociosentiment. To overcome sociosentiment, neohumanism prescribes an additional tool, [[#Protopsychospirituality|protopsychospirituality]].&lt;ref&gt;''What is the way to counteract this sociosentiment? The only way to eliminate it is to develop protospiritualistic mentality. The basis of this protospiritualistic mentality is sama-samája tattva [the principle of social equality]. When people understand this principle from the core of their hearts, they spontaneously develop protospiritualistic mentality, protospiritualistic psychic structure.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Bondages and Solutions (Discourse 2)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social justice ===
Neohumanism extends the concept of ''society'' to include all living beings. Unlike most other theories, past or present, neohumanism distinguishes between [[human society]] and society (in its broadest or universal sense).

In respect to the universal society, the stance of neohumanism corresponds to the spirit of the third fundamental principle of [[Progressive Utilization Theory|PROUT]]. The physical, mental, and spiritual potential of each and every living being should be developed to the maximum. This means that humans should not only respect and protect the rights of the non-human creatures but also actively promote their welfare and happiness.

Regarding human society, neohumanism asserts that no one should be left to lag behind. In a healthy human society, no one should suffer from [[oppression]]. Every problem - big or small, individual or collective - should be taken as a problem of the entire humanity.&lt;ref&gt;''Spread out the sermons of amity amongst the humanity. Remind one and all that the establishment of human excellence does not lie in hypocrisy but in simplicity and sincerity. Make them all realize that every individual human problem, whether big or small, is the problem of universal humanity. Make them also understand that the origin as well as the finality of the entire humanity is one and the same.'' Shrii Shrii Anandamurti, 1982 January 1. Ánanda Váńii Saḿgraha. Compilation from 1956-1990, Ananda Marga Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; So, for example, neohumanism is claimed to oppose any form of [[social discrimination]] based on race or sex, and support women's rights. Neohumanism makes men responsible for acting in support of those rights.&lt;ref&gt;''In every sphere of life men have either substantially limited the rights of women, or made the ability of women to exercise their rights subject to the whims and caprices of men... The main point of the discussion is this: those who take advantage of people’s simplicity or ignorance are veritable demons in human form, and those who deceive people by exploiting their sentiments of sacrifice are even worse than demons... If at all a movement is required, it must be implemented by men themselves. Today men should consider the needs of women and gradually restore to women the rights which women once entrusted to men out of feelings of helplessness or in response to their heartfelt sentiments.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1959). ''Human Society Part 1''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-120-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concern of neohumanism for [[social justice]] extends even to relatively minor but intractable matters. So, for example, though it pertains only to grammar, the male bias of the English language should not continue. When the pronoun 'he' can mean 'he' or 'she' and when 'man' can mean 'man' or 'woman', should not the same be the case with 'she' and 'woman'? Either English must have neutral words or the meaning of existing words must change. Though such type of change generally takes a while to implement, neohumanism insists that it be done.

=== Social progress ===
As with [[Progressive Utilization Theory|PROUT]], neohumanism views social progress as a condition in which the welfare and happiness of the entire society is increased. Neohumanism considers the individual and the society to be an inalienable concomitance. Unlike other philosophical theories that would [[Satisficing|satisfice]] or allegedly optimize social well-being through principles like the [[lesser of two evils principle]] or the [[greatest good for the greatest number]], neohumanism measures progress on the basis of improvements in the poorest sectors of society. According to neohumanism, what is genuinely good for the individual is also good for the society; and what is genuinely good for the society is also good for the individual.

Neohumanism distinguishes two ways in which [[social progress]] may be effected: evolution and revolution.

* '''Evolution''' brings gradual and specific change.
* '''Revolution''' brings rapid and comprehensive change.

Of the two systems, neohumanism greatly prefers revolution.&lt;ref&gt;''Now, those who are courageous enough to speak out this truth in clear language – those who say, "Shatter this bondage of limitation!" – their path is called the path of revolution. And those who say, "Everything will be done gradually... why so much haste?" – their path is called the path of evolution. They can never accomplish any glorious task.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Exploitation and Pseudoculture (Discourse 7)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Neohumanism distinguishes four types of people who take a stance on the subject of social change: [[Reactionary|reactionaries]], [[Reformism|reformists]], vocal revolutionaries, and [[Revolutionary|revolutionaries]].

* '''Reactionaries''' openly oppose change. Neohumanism respects their honesty but deems such persons to be suffering from a fear complex.&lt;ref&gt;''There are still others who say straightforwardly, "No, no, how can I contradict the way followed by my ancestors – my father, my grandfather?" They are reactionaries. They suffer from a mental disease. They are afraid to accept the new; they suffer from fear complex. They utter high-sounding phrases, but their hearts are filled with fear complexes. Not that they are terribly reprehensible. They say outwardly: "We are just doing the same as our ancestors did." But their ancestors used to wear wooden sandals instead of shoes, and shawls instead of tailored shirts, eat guŕ [raw sugar] instead of refined sugar, and drink water from wells instead of from taps. Do they follow this also?'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Exploitation and Pseudoculture (Discourse 7)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Reformists''' promote some miscellaneous fixes. According to neohumanism, such persons outwardly claim to want change, but their inner desire is to perpetuate the machinery of exploitation. The contradictory nature of [[reformism]] may manifest as a ''pseudoreformist strategy''.&lt;ref&gt;''The reformists say, "Let us go slowly on the path of reform." But actually they intend that the process of exploitation should continue without interruption. There were many reformists in the world, but in reality they did not want the welfare of the society; they only wanted to perpetuate the process of exploitation by bringing about some patchwork improvements.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Exploitation and Pseudoculture (Discourse 7)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Vocal revolutionaries''' (also referred to as ''pseudorevolutionaries'') are similar to reformists but even less forthright. They pretend to want revolutionary change, but their tall talk is belied by their action.&lt;ref&gt;''I have branded these people as "vocal revolutionaries". They deliver long lectures against exploitation, but they do the opposite in practice.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Exploitation and Pseudoculture (Discourse 7)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{anchor|revolutionary}}'''Revolutionaries''' are forthright about their vision of a new society and unrelenting in their effort to materialize that vision.

According to neohumanism, revolutionaries are the true well-wishers of society. As such, neohumanism asserts that only the revolutionaries can effect significant social progress.

=== Universalism ===
Neohumanism's concept of [[Universalism#Non-religious Universalism|universalism]] is non-religious. It is a type of love that extends to all beings of this universe, animate and even inanimate. From the perspective of Neohumanism, such a viewpoint is the ultimate outcome of the principle of 'social equality and 'protopsychospirituality'.&lt;ref name=dis10&gt;''Whenever people, after performing some activity, think of the Nucleus of the circum-rotarian universe, their minds become all-pervasive. Such people can never think of harming others; rather they will think only of universal welfare.'' Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "An Ideology for a New Generation (Discourse 10)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Value systems ===
According to neohumanism, the human-centered [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] approach of general humanism is problematic in that it allows the possibility of cruelty to animals and plants. Such type of cruelty inevitably fosters inter-creature clash. Neohumanism extends this analysis by observing that cruelty has a tendency to become habitual. In other words, what a human does today to an animal, that same human may do tomorrow to another human being. Hence, according to neohumanism, general humanism may also foster intra-human clash. To offset the anthropic bias of general humanism and to reduce the potential for conflict, neohumanism posits two types of value: [[#Utility value|utility value]] and [[#Existential value|existential value]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Sarkar, Prabhat Ranjan (1982). "Pseudohumanism (Discourse 8)" of ''The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism''. Kolkata: Ananda Marga Publications. {{ISBN|81-7252-168-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Existential value and utility value ====
According to neohumanism, until now, people have tended to think primarily in terms of [[#Utility value|utility value]], typically the [[utility]] that another entity has for oneself or one's nation. So, for example, when horses were a primary means of transportation, the utility value of horses to human beings was very great. Today, with more efficient and comfortable means of transportation, horses have lost most of their utility value for humans. Accordingly, Sarkar argues that the status of horses in modern society is much reduced. But neohumanism insists that horses also have ''existential value''. The existential value of a horse to itself is no less than the existential value of a human being to itself. In terms of the existential value one holds for one's own existence, all beings are said to be equal. Neohumanism would give greater importance to this existential value than to utility value.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Sarkar said: "Who says that those creatures who have lost their immediate utility value have no right to exist? No one has the moral right to say this.''&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

== Critiques ==
In a recent book,&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, James R. ''Violence and New Religious Movements''. [[Oxford University Press]], 2011. {{ISBN|0199735611}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Helen Crovetto asserts that there is a "dramatic" number of correlations between [[Ananda Marga]] and [[Mark Juergensmeyer|Mark Juergensmeyer's]] "description of [[#Religion|religious]] groups inclined toward [[terrorism]]". Crovetto mentions here the imagery of "cosmic war" that appears in Sarkar's writings, and Crovetto repeatedly references language that seems to "satanize" opponents, for example, the term ''[[#Exploiters|demon in human form]]'' that is part of the terminology of neohumanism. After considerable analysis, Crovetto concludes that it is probably more appropriate to describe the followers of Sarkar as [[#revolutionary|''revolutionary'']] rather than ''terrorist''. As such, Crovetto classifies them as "revolutionary sociospiritual [[Utopia|''utopians'']]".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4111">The [[List of Latin phrases|Latin phrase]] '''''odium theologicum''''' (literally "theological hatred") is the name originally given to the often intense anger and [[hatred]] generated by disputes over [[theology]]. It has also been adopted to describe non-theological disputes of a rancorous nature.

[[John Stuart Mill]], discussing the fallibility of the moral consensus in his essay "On Liberty" (1859) refers scornfully to the ''odium theologicum'', saying that, in a sincere bigot, it is one of the most unequivocal cases of moral feeling. In this essay, he takes issue with those who rely on moral feeling rather than reasoned argument to justify their beliefs.

== Academic disputes ==
The early linguist [[Leonard Bloomfield]] believed it necessary to develop linguistics as a cumulative, non-personal discipline; as a "genuine" science. In a talk in 1946, speaking of the development of the American Linguistics Society, he stated the fostering of such a discipline had saved it "from the blight of the ''odium theologicum'' and the postulation of schools . . . denouncing all persons who disagree or who choose to talk about something else," and he added "The struggle with recalcitrant facts, unyielding in their complexity, trains everyone who works actively in science to be humble, and accustoms him to impersonal acknowledgement of error."

Philosopher and historian of science [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn]] argued that scientists are strongly committed to their beliefs, theories and methods (the collection of which he termed "[[paradigm]]s"), and that science progresses mainly by [[paradigm shift]]s. He claimed that scientists with conflicting paradigms will hold to them as dearly as theologians hold to their theological paradigms.  Philosopher of math and science [[Imre Lakatos]], a student of [[Karl Popper]], described the nature of science in a similar manner.  

According to Lakatos, science progresses by continual modification or else supersession of what he termed "research programs" (roughly equivalent to Kuhn's "paradigms").  Lakatos claimed that a research program is informed by [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] beliefs as well as observation of facts, and may infinitely resist [[falsifiability|falsification]] if a scientist wishes to continue holding it in spite of problems or the discovery of new evidence.  If this view is correct, science does not remedy ''odium theologicum'', it provides another field in which it may manifest.  

In the controversy over the validity of [[Method of Fluxions|fluxions]] the philosopher [[George Berkeley]] addressed his Newtonian opponent:
:You reproach me with "Calumny, detraction, and artifice". You recommend such means as are "innocent and just, rather than the criminal method of lessening or detracting from my opponents". You accuse me of the ''odium Theologicum'', the intemperate Zeal of Divines. . .&lt;ref&gt;''Defence of Free-Thinking in Mathematics'', 1735&lt;/ref&gt;

Whatever view of science and the [[sociology of scientific knowledge]] is correct, it is a fact that in the history of science there have been many instances of new theories (e.g., [[germ theory of disease]], finitude of the [[speed of light]], [[radioactivity]]) being ridiculed and shunned by the greater scientific community when first proposed or discovered, only later to be adopted as more probably accurate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8716">In [[romantic literature]], a work has '''organic form''' if the structure has originated from the materials and subjects used by the author. Using the organic metaphor, the structure is seen to grow as a plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajdrake.com/e491_fall_04/materials/guides/gd_rom_organic_metaphor.htm|title=The Organic Metaphor in Romantic Literature|last=Drake|first=Al|work=History of Literary Criticism – Guides|accessdate=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It stands in contrast to a '''mechanical form''', a work which has been produced in accordance with artificial rules.  The lack of rules in Shakespeare's works led some critics to claim that they lacked form; [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] leapt to his defence with the concept of organic form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/431992/organic-form|title=Organic form|year=2011|work=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.|accessdate=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.utoronto.ca/utel/glossary/Organic_form.html|title=Organic form|last1=Henderson|first1=Greig E.|last2=Brown|first2=Christopher|date=March 31, 1997|work=Glossary of Literary Theory|publisher=University of Toronto|accessdate=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Coleridge, an English poet, philosopher, literary critic, and founder of the [[Romantic movement]], suggested that the concept of organic form meant that a poem or literary piece was shaped, rather than structured, from within. The use of the form allowed a piece to uniquely develop itself as it unfolded, and ultimately revealed an emphasis on the whole outcome of the piece, including the connections of each development to each other.  
In contrast to the more mechanical processes and rules which many critics believed were necessary for the formation of poetry and works, S.T. Coleridge determined that a more subconscious approach was possible through the, ‘‘imagination of the artist’’ whereby the outcome is an organic form, where ‘‘content and form have coalesced and fused.’’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bhatnagar|first=Manmohan K.|year=2000|publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Distributors|location=New Delhi|isbn=81-7156-631-6|pages=128|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0xRf3GleCQYC&amp;dq=twentieth+century+literature+in+english+vol.2|title=Twentieth Century Literature in English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coleridge's explanation can be found in Vol. 2 of [https://books.google.com/books?id=0xRf3GleCQYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Twentieth Century Literature in English'']
:The form is mechanic when on any given material we impress a predetermined form, not necessarily arising out of the properties of the material-as when to a mass of wet clay we give whatever shape we wish it to retain when hardened. The organic form, on the other hand, is innate; it shapes as it develops itself from within, and the fullness of its development is one and the same with the perfection of its outward form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bhatnagar|first=Manmohan K.|year=2000|publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Distributors|location=New Delhi|isbn=81-7156-631-6|pages=128|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0xRf3GleCQYC&amp;dq=twentieth+century+literature+in+english+vol.2|title=Twentieth Century Literature in English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In R.A. Foake’s Introduction to [https://books.google.com/books?id=kRj3zH0Dck4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Coleridge's+criticism+of+Shakespeare&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=apWRTe6hC9SPcNqLqIkH&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "''Coleridge’s criticism of Shakespeare: a selection''"], he defines Coleridge’s defense of Shakespeare’s works as ‘’an act of sympathetic imagination, to enter into the spirit of each work, to reveal its inner organizing principle, and to show how Shakespeare, properly understood, was always in control and exercising judgement,’’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foakes|first=R. A.|year=1989|publisher=Athlone Press Ltd.|location=London|isbn=0-485-11349-X|pages=1–53|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kRj3zH0Dck4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=coleridge%27s+criticism+of+shakespeare:+a+selection+by+R.+A.+Foakes#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Coleridge's criticism of Shakespeare: A selection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding Shakespeare’s much criticized erratic form, Coleridge further imposed the possibilities of organic form:
:...each exterior is the [[physiognomy]] of the being within, its true image reflected and thrown out from the concave mirror; and even such is the appropriate excellence of her chosen poet, our own Shakespeare-himself a nature humanized, a genial understanding directing self-consciously a power and implicit wisdom deeper than consciousness.

Following on from Coleridge’s 18th Century ideas on organic form, was [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]], one of the most revered poets of the [[Victorian era]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=From the Academy of American Poets|url=http://www.poets.org|accessdate=27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Hopkins introduced the terms “[[inscape]]” and “instress”. “Inscape” was the core components in individual objects, allowing him to then home in on its relation to other objects and their perception as a whole. “Instress” focussed on the assimilating the immediate apperception and the sensory processes of perception .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levertov|first=Denise|title=Some Notes on Organic Form|journal=Poetry Foundation|date=September 1965|volume=106|issue=6|pages=420–425|jstor=40732772}}&lt;/ref&gt;

20th-Century American poet [[Denise Levertov]] was an artist of organic form. In ‘Some notes on organic form’ she gives credit to Gerard Manley Hopkin’s influence on her own ideas and poetic form: 
:A partial definition, then, of organic poetry might be that it is a method of apperception, i.e., of recognizing what we perceive, and is based on an intuition of an order, a form beyond forms, in which forms partake, and of which man’s creative works are analogies, resemblances, natural allegories. Such poetry is exploratory.

Levertov believed that in order to achieve organic form in literature, the artist must be ‘brought to speech’ through a demanding sensory experience which renders them no choice but to put pen to paper.&lt;ref name="www9.georgetown"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hallisey|first=Joan. F.|title=Denise Levertov (b. 1923)|url=http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/bassr/heath/syllabuild/iguide/levertov.html|publisher=Georgetown University|accessdate=March 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In her own work, Levertov concentrated on various techniques such as [[enjambment]], popular with much of Shakespeare’s work, and ‘juxtaposition of key words’ for effect. Avenues were carefully sought and deliberated upon to create the ‘right words, the right image, the right arrangement of the lines on the page’.&lt;ref name="www9.georgetown"/&gt; Many artists of organic form believed that a reader or audience were not immediately, if ever, considered during the construction of a poem or piece. Levertov, included, felt it was essential that a poem be produced from the ‘inner being of the poet’.&lt;ref name="www9.georgetown" /&gt;

Organic form in literature was also theorized by Schelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Matthews|first=Bruce|year=2011|publisher=State University Of New York|location=Albany|title=Schelling’s Organic Form of Philosophy: Life as the Schema of Freedom}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce Matthews suggests that, insofar as Schelling understands life according to a schema of freedom of thinking, representations are not absolutely different, and subjects and objects are grounded in an identity that links them together. Matthews argues that Schelling’s organic philosophy strives to support an integrated framework where conceptual ideas are scrutinized, challenging ideas and concepts in hopes to create a more significant understanding of the world.

The '''quadratic integrate and fire (QIF) model''' is a [[biological neuron model]] and a type of integrate-and-fire neuron which describes [[action potentials]] in neurons. In contrast to physiologically accurate but computationally expensive neuron models like the [[Hodgkin–Huxley model]], the QIF model seeks only to produce [[action potential]]-like patterns and ignores subtleties like gating variables, which play an important role in generating action potentials in a real neuron. However, the QIF model is incredibly easy to implement and compute, and relatively straightforward to study and understand, thus has found ubiquitous use in computational neuroscience {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}.

A quadratic integrate and fire neuron is defined by the [[autonomous differential equation]],

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dt} = x^2 + I&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is a real positive constant. Note that a solution to this differential equation is the tangent function, which blows up in finite time. Thus a "spike" is said to have occurred when the solution reaches positive infinity, and the solution is reset to negative infinity.

When implementing this model in computers, a threshold crossing value (&lt;math&gt;V_t&lt;/math&gt;) and a reset value (&lt;math&gt;V_r&lt;/math&gt;) is assigned, so that when the solution rises above the threshold, &lt;math&gt;x(t) \geq V_t&lt;/math&gt;, the solution is immediately reset to &lt;math&gt;V_r&lt;/math&gt;

Since starting as a [[Secret Santa]] exchange, RedditGifts has added a variety of different themed exchanges that run throughout the year, such as [[Nintendo]] and [[Halloween]].&lt;ref name="AboutRG" /&gt; The service also runs Arbitrary Day, "a celebration of nothing in particular". Up to 2011, approximately $1.5 million had been spent by Reddit users on the project.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

Microsoft chairman and philanthropist [[Bill Gates]] has participated in the service for five years under the username "thisisbillgates",&lt;ref name="BillGatesFiveTimes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clifford|first1=Catherine|title=Billionaire Bill Gates was this cat lover’s Secret Santa — here’s the epic haul of gifts he gave her|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/22/what-billionaire-bill-gates-gave-his-reddit-secret-santa.html|accessdate=April 9, 2018|work=CNBC|publisher=[[NBCUniversal]]|date=December 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; most notably in 2013 and in 2014,&lt;ref name="BusinessInsiderRG"&gt;{{cite news|last1=D'Onfro|first1=Jillian|title=Bill Gates Got One Lucky Reddit User An Incredibly Thoughtful Secret Santa Gift|url=https://www.businessinsider.com.au/bill-gates-reddit-secret-santa-gift-2014-12|accessdate=April 9, 2018|work=Business Insider Australia|date=December 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]] confirmed this.&lt;ref name="BillGatesSMH"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Prakash|first1=Neha|title=Bill Gates gives secret Santa present on Reddit|url=https://www.smh.com.au/technology/bill-gates-gives-secret-santa-present-on-reddit-20131220-2zozf.html|accessdate=April 9, 2018|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax|date=December 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gates was noted to send objects to Reddit users like "Calid7" (a 25-year-old Californian woman),&lt;ref name="BusinessInsiderRG" /&gt; such as a travel book and a stuffed cow.&lt;ref name="RedditAFR" /&gt; He has also been known to donate to charities in the name of the user he has been matched with.&lt;ref name="BusinessInsiderRG" /&gt;

==History==
RedditGifts was originally created by Reddit user Dan McComas,&lt;ref name="DailyBeastRG"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ries|first1=Brian|title=Secret Santa: The Creator of Reddit's Gift Exchange, the World's Biggest|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/secret-santa-the-creator-of-reddits-gift-exchange-the-worlds-biggest|accessdate=April 9, 2018|work=The Daily Beast|date=December 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "kickme444" as known on the site, and "5days". McComas first conceived the idea while working on freelance projects in 2009.&lt;ref name="DailyBeastRG" /&gt;

The site was launched in 2009 with 4,500 participants;&lt;ref name="TechCrunchRG" /&gt; the website reports that 212,894 people worldwide participated in the event during 2014.&lt;ref name="BusinessInsiderRG" /&gt;

The site is a three-time [[Guinness World Record]] holder for the World's Largest Gift Exchange.&lt;ref name="WorldRecordRG"&gt;{{cite web|title=redditgifts Secret Santa Guinness World Record|url=https://www.redditgifts.com/blog/view/worldrecord/|website=RedditGifts|publisher=[[Reddit]]|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WorldRecordGWR"&gt;{{cite web|title=Largest online Secret Santa game|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-online-secret-santa-game|website=Guinness World Records|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reddit acquisition===
In August 2011, Reddit bought the RedditGifts site. The two site-runners reportedly could not afford to continue maintaining the site while simultaneously working their day jobs. Both site-runners continued to run the website, although they are not involved with the daily operations of Reddit.&lt;ref name="TechCrunchRG" /&gt; The company takes a 15 to 20 percent cut of every purchase. Reddit operates the website as part of its ongoing plans to monetise their website. As of December 2013, approximately 14 percent of Reddit's revenue came from running the service, although McComas said that those sales alone could "put Reddit firmly in the black", and that the company may choose to reinvest funds in [[e-commerce]] customer service and infrastructure.&lt;ref name="RedditAFR" /&gt;

In December 2013, while expressing his desire for the Reddit business to become self-sustaining, then-Chief Executive [[Yishan Wong]] stated that the RedditGifts service "provides real value", and called it "promising" for the business. Wong increased the staff count dedicated to the project to eight after realising the service's potential.&lt;ref name="RedditAFR" /&gt;

'''Robert Singleton''', also known as Bob Singleton (born 1936), is a civil rights activist. He and his wife [[Helen Singleton]] are known for being part of the [[Freedom Riders|Freedom Rides]] together in [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]], [[Mississippi]]. He currently teaches economics at [[Loyola Marymount University|Loyola Marymount Universit&lt;nowiki/&gt;y]], where he has been for over twenty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Singleton|first1=Robert|title=Robert Singleton, Ph.D.|url=http://www.crmvet.org/vet/singleto.htm|publisher=Robert Singleton|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and education==
Robert was born and raised in Philadelphia. He joined the army and served in Europe. When he came back from war, he went to school at the University of California, Los Angeles. This is where studied economics and also went for his undergraduate. In 1964, he received his Ph.D. and then went on to teach at UCLA for a few years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Singleton|first1=Robert|title=Robert Singleton, Ph.D.|url=http://www.crmvet.org/vet/singleto.htm|publisher=Robert Singleton|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert began his activism at UCLA when he ran for president of their chapter for the NAACP. During his time on campus, he became inspired by the speakers that came and spoke, including James Farmer, Malcolm X, James Baldwin, and Langston Hughes, each of whom helped him realize the injustices in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Singleton|first1=Robert|title=Robert Singleton, Ph.D.|url=http://www.crmvet.org/vet/singleto.htm|publisher=Robert Singleton|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He first joined the sit-ins, where he met other activists and helped them organize events where they would find food and clothing, get sharecroppers to vote, and organize the freedom rider to Jackson, Mississippi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Singleton|first1=Robert|title=Robert Singleton, Ph.D.|url=http://www.crmvet.org/vet/singleto.htm|publisher=Robert Singleton|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he returned, the NAACP had been kicked out of the school, so it was replaced with a CORE group, of which he was chair.

==Freedom Rides==
Robert Singleton and his wife are most known for the Freedom Rides that they took part of in Jackson, Mississippi. The south ignored the ruling that the U.S Supreme Court made about public transportation not being segregated because segregation was unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adams|first1=Philip|title=American Freedom Riders|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/latenightlive/1961-freedom-riders/6140448|publisher=ABC|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, they protested against segregation on public transportation. On July 30, 1961, when they got to Mississippi, Robert, his wife, and the other riders were arrested and sent to Parchmen Penitentiary. The conditions in the prison were harsh. They were put in maximum security, separated from each other, and placed next to the gas chambers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adams|first1=Philip|title=American Freedom Riders|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/latenightlive/1961-freedom-riders/6140448|publisher=ABC|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Three months after the freedom rides they were to desegregate public transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greene|first1=Eric|title=UCLA to honor alumni who fought segregation as Freedom Riders|url=http://newsroom.ucla.edu/stories/ucla-to-honor-alumni-who-fought-segregation-as-freedom-riders|publisher=UCLA Newsroom|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert and Helen Singleton were among the few married couples who participated in the Freedom Rides.

The '''ruwenzori colobus''' (''Colobus angolensis ruwenzori'')&lt;ref name="Colobus"&gt;{{cite book|title=Rwanda|url=https://books.google.al/books?id=NVTLZ41XyX8C&amp;pg=PA144&amp;dq=Ruwenzori+colobus&amp;hl=sq&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjCnKbspb3eAhXDCewKHXbCA6gQ6AEIIjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Ruwenzori%20colobus&amp;f=false|author1=Philip Briggs|author2=Janice Booth|ISBN=978-1-84162-306-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Ruwenzori black-and-white colobus''', is a [[primate]] [[subspecies]] of [[Angola colobus]], native to [[Rwanda]] at [[Nyungwe National Park]].&lt;ref name=""pp1&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nyungwepark.com/nyungwe/the-park/|title=Nyungwe Forest|accessdate=21 April 2013|publisher=Official website of Nyungwe National Park.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy==
[[Duke Adolf Friedrich of Mecklenburg|Adolf Friedrichs]] recognized the validity of subspecies as ''Colobus angolensis ruwenzori''.&lt;ref name="Colobus"/&gt;&lt;ref name=msw3&gt;{{MSW3 Groves|pages=168|id=12100598}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Like all [[black-and-white colobus]], the ruwenzori colobus has black fur and a black face, surrounded by long, white locks of hair. It also has a mantle of white hair on the shoulders. The long, thin tail can be either black or white, but the tip is always white. There is a significant regional variation in the total amount of white on the body and the length of the fur.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

==Ecology and behavior==
The ruwenzori colobus is a highly arboreal and acrobatic leaf-eater.&lt;ref name="Colobus"/&gt; Their diet consists of about two thirds of leaves and one third of fruit and seeds.

Although all ''[[Colobus]]'' [[species]] are very sociable, they usually move on the troops of several hundred [[animal]]s.&lt;ref name="Colobus"/&gt;

==Distribution and habitat==
The ruwenzori colobus inhabit [[rainforest]]s of Nyungwe National Park near [[Rwenzori Mountains]].&lt;ref name="Colobus"/&gt; Some reports indicate that the subspecies may occur in some [[Tanzania]]n [[region]]s.&lt;ref name="AndersonCowlishawRowcliffe2007"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Anderson |first1=J. |last2=Cowlishaw |first2=G. |last3=Rowcliffe |first3=J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22640">The '''self-discrepancy theory''' states that people compare themselves to internalized standards called "self-guides". These different representations of the self can be contradictory and result in emotional discomfort. Self-discrepancy is the gap between two of these self-representations.  The theory states that people are motivated to reduce the gap in order to remove disparity in self-guides.&lt;ref name="Orellana-Damacela, L.E. 2000"&gt;Orellana-Damacela, L.E., Tindale, T.S., &amp; Suarez-Balcazar, Y. (2000). Decisional and behavioral procrastination: How they relate to self-discrepancies. Journal of Social Behavior and Personality, 15, 225–238.&lt;/ref&gt;

Developed by [[E. Tory Higgins|Edward Tory Higgins]] in 1987, the theory provides a platform for understanding how different types of discrepancies between representations of the self are related to different kinds of emotional vulnerabilities. It maintains close ties to a long-standing tradition of belief-incongruity research. Higgins sought to illustrate that internal disagreement causes emotional and psychological turmoil. Before, many theories such as the self-inconsistency theory,&lt;ref&gt;Lecky, P. (1961). Self-consistency: A theory of personality. New York, NY Shoe String Press&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Cognitive dissonance|cognitive dissonance theory]],&lt;ref&gt;Festinger, L. (1957) A theory of cognitive dissonance, Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Balance theory|imbalance theory]] (e.g., Heider, 1958), had done just that; however, Higgins aspired to predict and define what distinct emotions the cognitive imbalances would result in. Previous self-imbalance theories had recognized only positive or negative emotions, in a general sense, associated with the belief inconsistency. The self-discrepancy theory was the first to improve on these generalizations and assign specific emotions and affects to the disparity. It asserts two cognitive dimensions from which various self-states are measured: domains of the self and standpoints of the self.&lt;ref name="self discrepancy"&gt;Higgins, E. T. (1987). Self-discrepancy; A theory relating self and affect, Psychological Review, 94, 319–340.&lt;/ref&gt;    

The theory proposes how a variety of self-discrepancies represents a variety of types of negative psychological situations that are associated with different kinds of discomfort (p.&amp;nbsp;319).&lt;ref name="self discrepancy"/&gt; 
A primary goal of the self-discrepancy theory is to help aid in predicting which types of incongruent ideas will cause such individuals to feel different kinds of negative emotions (p.&amp;nbsp;319).&lt;ref name="self discrepancy"/&gt;

The structure of the theory was built based on three ideas: to distinguish among the different kinds of discomfort felt by those people holding incongruent ideals experienced, to relate the different possible kinds of emotional vulnerabilities felt by the different types of discrepancies that people may have for the self, and to consider the role of both the availability and accessibility to the different discrepancies that may potentially have in influencing the kind and type of discomfort they are most likely to experience. Also, the theory suggests that individuals are motivated to reach a goal of where the self-concept matches the appropriate self-guides (p.&amp;nbsp;321).&lt;ref name="self discrepancy"/&gt;

==Domains of the self==
The theory postulates three basic domains of the self:

===Actual===
Actual self is your representation of the attributes that you believe you actually possess, or that you believe others believe you possess.&lt;ref name="self discrepancy"/&gt; The "actual self" is a person's basic self-concept. It is one's perception of their own attributes (intelligence, athleticism, attractiveness, etc.).

===Ideal===
Ideal self is your representation of the attributes that someone (yourself or another) would like you, ideally, to possess (i.e., a representation of someone's hopes, aspirations, or wishes for you).&lt;ref name="self discrepancy"/&gt; The "ideal-self" is what usually motivates individuals to change, improve and achieve. 

The ideal self-regulatory system focuses on the presence or absence of ''positive'' outcomes (e.g., love provided or withdrawn).&lt;ref name="journal"&gt;Higgins, E.T., Roney, C.J.R., Crowe, E., Hymes C. (1994). Ideal versus ought predilections for approach and avoidance: Distinct self-regulatory systems, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 66, 276-286.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ought===
Ought is your representation of the attributes that someone (yourself or another) believes you should or ought to possess (i.e., a representation of someone's sense of your duty, obligations, or responsibilities).&lt;ref name="self discrepancy"/&gt;

The ''ought'' self-regulatory system focuses on the presence or absence of ''negative'' outcomes (e.g., criticism administered or suspended).&lt;ref name="journal"/&gt;

==Standpoints of the self==
Self-discrepancy theory initiates the importance of considering two different standpoints (or vantage points) in which "the self" is perceived. A standpoint on the self is defined as "a point of view from which you can be judged that reflects a set of attitudes or values."

===Own===
An individual's ''own'' personal standpoint.

===Other===
The standpoint of some ''significant other''.&lt;ref name="self discrepancy"/&gt; Significant others may comprise parents, siblings, spouses, or friends. The "other" standpoint is what the self perceives their significant other's standpoint to be.

Except for theories focusing on the actual self, previous theories of the self had not systematically considered the different domain of self in terms of the different standpoints on those domains.&lt;ref name="self discrepancy"/&gt; These two constructs provide the basis from which discrepancies arise; that is, when certain domains of the self are at odds with one another, individuals experience particular emotional affects (ex: one's beliefs concerning the attributes one would personally like ideally to possess versus your beliefs concerning the attributes that some significant other person, such as your mother, would like you ideally to possess).

==Discrepancies==
Discrepancies create two major types of negative physiological situations: absence of positive outcomes, which is associated with dejection-related emotions, and the presence of negative outcomes which is associated with agitation-related emotions.

===Self-concept===

====Actual/own vs. actual/other====
These self-state representations are the basic self-concept (from either or both standpoints). Discrepancies between own self-concept, and other self-concept can be described as an [[Identity crisis (psychology)|identity crisis]], which often occurs during [[adolescence]].&lt;ref&gt;Erikson, E. H. (1968). Identity: Youth and crisis.  New York:Norton.&lt;/ref&gt; Guilt is a characteristic result of discrepancy from the own perspective. Shame is a characteristic result of discrepancy from the other perspective.

===Self-guide===

====Actual/own vs. ideal/own====
In this discrepancy, a person's view of their actual attributes does not match the ideal attributes they hope to develop. Discrepancy between these self-guides is characterized by dejection-related emotions such as disappointment and dissatisfaction. Actual/ideal discrepancies are associated with low [[self-esteem]]&lt;ref&gt;Wells, L. E. &amp; Marwell, G. (1976) Self-esteem: Its conceptualization and measurement.  Beverly Hills, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; and characterized by the threat of absence of positive outcomes. Specifically, an individual is predicted to be vulnerable to disappointment or dissatisfaction because these emotions are associated with people believing that their personal wishes have been unfulfilled. These emotions have been described as being associated with the individuals' own standpoint and a discrepancy from his or her hope, desire, or ideals. The motivational nature of this discrepancy also suggests that it could be associated with frustration because of these unfulfilled desires. Emotions such as blameworthiness, feeling no interest in things, and not feeling effective was also associated with this discrepancy. In addition, this discrepancy is also associated with dejection from perceived lack of effectiveness or self-fulfillment.&lt;ref name="self discrepancy"/&gt; This discrepancy is uniquely associated with depression.&lt;ref name="self discrepancy"/&gt;

====Actual/own vs. ideal/other====
Here, one's view of their actual attributes does not match the ideal attributes their significant other hopes or wishes for them. The ideal self-guide is characterized by the absence of positive outcomes, and accompanied by dejection-related emotions. More specifically, because one believes that they have failed to obtain some significant other's hopes or wishes are likely to believe that the significant other is disappointed and dissatisfied with them. In turn, individuals will be vulnerable to shame, embarrassment, or feeling downcast, because these emotions are associated with people believing that they have lost standing or esteem in the eyes of others. Analysis of shame and related emotions have been described as being associated with the standpoint of one or more other people and discrepancies from achievement and/or status standards. Other analyses describe shame as being associated with concern over losing the affection or esteem of others. When people have a sense of the difference between their actual self and their social ideal self, an individual will experience feelings of shame and unworthiness. Shame that is often experienced when there is a failure to meet a significant other's goals or wishes involves loss of face and presumed exposure to the dissatisfaction of others.&lt;ref name="self discrepancy"/&gt; Feeling lack of pride, lack of feeling sure of self and goals, feeling lonely, feeling blue, and feeling not interested in things was also associated with this discrepancy. This discrepancy is associated with dejection from perceived or anticipated loss of social affection or esteem.&lt;ref name="self discrepancy"/&gt;

====Actual/own vs. ought/other====
This discrepancy exists when a person's own standpoint does not match what they believe a significant other considers to be his or her duty or obligation to attain. Agitation-related emotions are associated with this discrepancy and results in the presence of negative outcomes. More specifically, because violation of prescribed duties and obligations is associated with punishment, this particular discrepancy represents the presence of negative outcomes. The individual experiencing this discrepancy will have an expectation of punishment; therefore, the person is predicted to be vulnerable to fear and feeling threatened, because these emotions occur when danger or harm is anticipated or impending. Analyses of such emotions have described them as being associated with the standpoint of one or more other people and discrepancy from norms or moral standards. The motivational nature of this discrepancy suggests that one might experience feelings of resentment. The feeling of resentment arises from the anticipated pain to be inflicted by others. The person might also experience anxiety because of apprehension over negative responses from others. This discrepancy is associated with agitation from fear and threat.&lt;ref name="self discrepancy"/&gt; In addition, it is also associated with agitation from self-criticism.&lt;ref name="self discrepancy"/&gt; Social anxiety is uniquely associated with this discrepancy.&lt;ref name="self discrepancy"/&gt;

====Actual/own vs. ought/own====
A discrepancy between these self-guides occurs when one's view of their actual attributes do not meet the expectations of what they think they ought to possess. This discrepancy is associated with the presence of negative outcomes and is characterized by agitation-related emotions such as self-dissatisfaction. An individual predicts a readiness for self-punishment. The person is predicted to be vulnerable to guilt, self-contempt, and uneasiness, because these particular feelings occur when people believe they have transgressed a personally legitimate and accepted moral standard. Analysis of guilt have described it as associated with a person's own standpoint and a discrepancy from his or her sense of morality or justice. The motivational nature of this discrepancy suggests associations with feelings of moral worthlessness or weakness.&lt;ref name="self discrepancy"/&gt; Transgression of one's own internalized moral standards has been associated with guilt and self-criticism because when people attribute failure to a lack of sufficient effort on their part, they experience feelings of guilt.&lt;ref name="self discrepancy"/&gt;

===Ideal vs. ought===
Ideal self and ought self act as self guides with which the actual self aspires to be aligned. The ideal self represents hopes and wishes, whereas the ought self is determined through obligation and sense of duty. In terms of the ideal or ought discrepancy and specific to self-regulatory approach vs. avoidance behaviors, the ideal domain is predisposed to approach behavior and the ought domain is predisposed to avoidance behavior.&lt;ref name="journal"/&gt;

==Another domain of self==
In 1999 Charles Carver and associates made a new amendment to the theory by adding the domain of feared self.&lt;ref&gt;Carver, C.S., Lawrence, J.W., &amp; Scheier, M.F. (1999). Self-Discrepancies and Affect: Introducing the Role of Feared Selves. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 25, 7, 783-792.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the self guides proposed by Higgins which imply an actual or desired (better) self, the feared self is a domain that measures what one does not desire to be. In many cases, this may have a different level of influence in terms of priority on the self than previous domains and self-guides. It is human nature to avoid negative affect before approaching positives.

==Availability and accessibility of self-discrepancies==
Beliefs that are incongruent are cognitive constructs and can vary in both their availability and accessibility. In order to establish which types of discrepancies an individual holds and which are likely to be active and produce their associated emotions at any point, the availability and accessibility of self-discrepancies must be distinguished.&lt;ref name="self discrepancy"/&gt;

===Availability===
The availability of a self-discrepancy depends on the extent to which the attributes of the two conflicted self-state representations diverge for the person in question. Each attribute in one of the self-state representations (actual/own) is compared to each attribute in the other self-state representation (ideal/own). Each pair of attributes is either a match or a mismatch.&lt;ref name="self discrepancy"/&gt; The larger variance between the number of matches and the number of nonmatches (i.e., the greater the divergence of attributes between the two self-state representations), the larger the magnitude of that type of self-discrepancy that is available. Furthermore, the greater the magnitude of a particular discrepancy produces more intense feelings of discomfort accompanying the discrepancy when activated.&lt;ref name="self discrepancy"/&gt;

The availability of the self-discrepancy is not enough to influence emotions. In order to do so, the self-discrepancy must also be activated. The variable that influences the probability of activation is its accessibility.&lt;ref name="Higgins, E. T. 1999"&gt;Higgins, E. T. (1999). Who do self-discrepancies have specific relations to emotions? The second-generation question of Tangney, Niedenthal, Covert, and Barlow (1998). Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 77(6), 1313-1317.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accessibility===
The accessibility of a self-discrepancy depends on the same factors that determine the accessibility of any stored construct. One factor is how recently the construct has been activated. The more often a construct is activated, the more likely it will be used later on to understand social events. The accessibility or likelihood of activation, of a stored construct also depends on the relation between its "meaning" and the properties of the stimulus event. A stored construct will not be used to interpret an event unless it is applicable to the event. Thus the negative psychological situation represented in a self-discrepancy (i.e. the "meaning" of the discrepancy) will not be activated by an explicitly positive event. In sum, the accessibility of self-discrepancy is determined by its recency of activation, its frequency of activation, and its applicability to the stimulus event.&lt;ref name="self discrepancy"/&gt; The theory posits that the greater the accessibility of a self-discrepancy, the more powerfully the person will experience the emotion accompanying that discrepancy.&lt;ref name="Higgins, E. T. 1999"/&gt;

The theory does not propose that individuals are aware of the accessibility or availability of their self-discrepancies. However, it is obvious that both the availability and accessibility can influence social information processing automatically and without awareness.&lt;ref name="self discrepancy"/&gt; Thus, self-discrepancy theory simulates that the available and accessible negative psychological situations embodied in one's self-discrepancies can be used to provide meaning to events without being aware of either the discrepancies or their impact on processing. The measure of self-discrepancies requires only that one be able to retrieve attributes of specific self-state representations when asked to do so. It does not require that one be aware of the relations among these attributes of their significance.&lt;ref name="self discrepancy"/&gt;

Self-discrepancy theory hypothesizes that the greater the magnitude of a particular type of self-discrepancy possessed by a person, the more strongly the person will experience the emotion associated with that type of discrepancy.&lt;ref name="self discrepancy"/&gt;

==Application and use ==
Self-discrepancy theory becomes applicable when addressing some of the psychological problems individuals face with undesired self-image. The theory has been applied to psychological problems faced by college students compromising their career choice,&lt;ref&gt;Tsaousides, T., &amp; Jome, L. (2008) Perceived career compromise, affect and work-related satisfaction in college students. Journal of Vocational Behavior, 73(2), 185–194.&lt;/ref&gt; understanding clinically depressed students,&lt;ref&gt;Scott, L., &amp; O'Hara, M.W. (1993). Self-discrepancies in clinically anxious and depressed university students. Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 102, 282–287.&lt;/ref&gt; eating disorders, mental health and depression in chronically ill women&lt;ref&gt;Heidrich, S. M., &amp; Powwattana, A. (2004). Self-Discrepancy and Mental Health in Older Women with Chronic Illnesses. Journal of Adult Development, 11(4), 251-259(9).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, A., &amp; Lynn, S. (2008). Subclinical bulimia vs. depression in an interpersonal context. Eating Behaviors, 9(4), 509-512.&lt;/ref&gt; and even developing self-confidence in athletes.&lt;ref&gt;Beattie, S., Hardy, L., &amp; Woodman, T. (2004). Pre-competition self-confidence: The role of the self. Journal of Sport &amp; Exercise Psychology. 26(3), 427–441.&lt;/ref&gt; Self-Discrepancy Theory inherently provides a means to systematically lessen negative affect associated with self-discrepancies by reducing the discrepancies between the self domains in conflict of one another (Higgins, 1987). Not only has it been applied to psychological health, but also to other research and understanding to human emotions such as [[shame]] and [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]].&lt;ref&gt;Tangney, J.P., Niedenthal, P.M., Vowell, Covert M. and Hill, Barlow D., (1998). Are shame and guilt related to distinct self-discrepancies? A test of Higgin's (1987) hypotheses. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 75, 256–268.&lt;/ref&gt; The self-guided pressure society and ourselves induce throw an individual into turmoil. The theory finds many of its uses geared toward mental health, anxiety, and depression. Understanding what emotions are being aroused and the reasoning is important to reinstate psychological health.

===Procrastination===
Studies have correlated the theory and [[procrastination]]. Specifically, discrepancies in the ''actual/ought'' domain from the ''own'' perspective, are the ''strongest'' predictor of procrastination.&lt;ref name="Orellana-Damacela, L.E. 2000"/&gt; Avoidance is the common theme. The actual/ought self-regulatory system responds through avoidance. Procrastinators also have an avoidance relationship with their goals.

===Depression===
Depression is associated with ''conflict'' between a person's perceived ''actual'' self, and some standard, goal or aspiration. An ''actual/ought'' discrepancy triggers agitated depression (characterized by feelings of guilt, apprehension, anxiety or fear). An ''actual/ideal'' discrepancy triggers dejected depression (characterized by feelings of failure, disappointment, devaluation or shame).

===Emotions===
Higgins measured how individuals experienced self-discrepancies by having individuals reminisce and remember about "negative events or personal self-guides, including hopes, goals, duties, and obligations, and measure what will help increase the kind of discomfort that the individual experiences.&lt;ref name="self discrepancy"/&gt; The study found the "absence of an actual/own and ideal/own discrepancy" is associated with the emotions "happy" and "satisfied" and the "absence of an actual/own and ought/other discrepancy" is associated with the emotions "calm' and "secure" (p.&amp;nbsp;336).&lt;ref name="self discrepancy"/&gt;

'''Self-knowledge''' is a term used in [[psychology]] to describe the information that an individual draws upon when finding an answer to the question ''"What am I like?"''.

While seeking to develop the answer to this question, self-knowledge requires ongoing [[self-awareness]] and [[self-consciousness]] (which is not to be confused with [[consciousness]]). Young infants and chimpanzees display some of the traits of self-awareness&lt;ref&gt;Gallup, G. G., Jr. (1979). ''Self-recognition in chimpanzees and man: A developmental and comparative perspective''. New York: Plenum Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[agency (philosophy)|agency]]/contingency,&lt;ref&gt;Finkelstein, N. W., &amp; Ramey, C. T. (1977). Learning to control the environment in infancy. ''Child Development, 48,''806-819.&lt;/ref&gt; yet they are not considered as also having self-consciousness. At some greater level of [[cognition]], however, a self-conscious component emerges in addition to an increased self-awareness component, and then it becomes possible to ask ''"What am I like?"'', and to answer with self-knowledge.

Self-knowledge is a component of the [[Self (psychology)|self]] or, more accurately, the [[self-concept]]. It is the knowledge of oneself and one's properties and the ''desire'' to seek such knowledge that guide the development of the self-concept. Self-knowledge informs us of our mental representations of ourselves, which contain attributes that we uniquely pair with ourselves, and theories on whether these attributes are stable or dynamic.

The self-concept is thought to have three primary aspects:
* The [https://opentextbc.ca/socialpsychology/chapter/the-cognitive-self-the-self-concept/ cognitive self]
* The [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a864/fbfd34426c98b2832a3c2aa9fbc7df8bb910.pdf affective self]
* The [https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0010027715000256/1-s2.0-S0010027715000256-main.pdf?_tid=710543c7-e98f-4484-85e2-acf02e7076cc&amp;acdnat=1528121667_89562a04b60eba34b74c91685e1508c9 executive self]

The affective and executive selves are also known as the ''felt'' and ''active'' selves respectively, as they refer to the emotional and behavioral components of the self-concept.
Self-knowledge is linked to the cognitive self in that its motives guide our search to gain greater clarity and assurance that our own self-concept is an accurate representation of our ''true self'';{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} for this reason the cognitive self is also referred to as the ''known self''. The cognitive self is made up of everything we know (or ''think we know'' about ourselves). This implies physiological properties such as hair color, race, and height etc.; and psychological properties like beliefs, values, and dislikes to name but a few.

==Relationship with memory==
Self-knowledge and its structure affect how events we experience are [[Encoding (memory)|encoded]], how they are selectively [[Recollection|retrieved/recalled]], and what conclusions we draw from how we interpret the [[memory]]. The analytical interpretation of our own memory can also be called ''[[meta memory]]'', and is an important factor of ''[[meta cognition]]''.

The connection between our memory and our self-knowledge has been recognized for many years by leading minds in both [[philosophy]]&lt;ref&gt;Locke, J. (1731). ''An essay concerning human understanding.'' London: Edmund Parker. (Original work published 1690)&lt;/ref&gt; and psychology,&lt;ref&gt;James, W. (1890). ''The principles of psychology'' (Vol. 1). New York: Holt.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kihlstrom, J. F., &amp; Klein, S. B. (1994). The self as a knowledgeable structure. (As cited in Sedikedes, C., &amp; Brewer, M. B. (Eds.), ''Individual self, relational self, collective self.'' (pp. 35-36). Philadelphia, PA: Psychology Press)&lt;/ref&gt; yet the precise specification of the relation remains a point of controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Kihlstrom, J. F., &amp; Klein, S. B. (1997). Self-knowledge and self-awareness. (As cited in Sedikedes, C., &amp; Brewer, M. B. (Eds.), ''Individual self, relational self, collective self.'' (pp. 35-36). Philadelphia, PA: Psychology Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Specialized memory===
* Studies have shown there is a memory advantage for information encoded with reference to the self.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, T. B., Kuiper, N. A., &amp; Kirker, W. S. (1977). Self-reference and the encoding of personal information. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 35''(9),677-688&lt;/ref&gt;
* Patients with [[Alzheimer's]] who have difficulty recognizing their own family have not shown evidence of self-knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, S., Cosmides, L., &amp; Costabile, K. (2003). Preserved knowledge of self in a case of Alzheimer's dementia. ''Social Cognition, 21''(2), 157-165&lt;/ref&gt;

===The division of memory===
Self-theories have traditionally failed to distinguish between different source that inform self-knowledge, these are ''[[episodic memory]]'' and ''[[semantic memory]]''. Both episodic and semantic memory are facets of ''[[declarative memory]]'', which contains memory of facts. Declarative memory is the explicit counterpart to ''[[procedural memory]]'', which is implicit in that it applies to skills we have learnt; they are not ''facts'' that can be ''stated''.

[[File:Schematic memory.JPG|thumb|400px|A basic schematic representation of memory showing the 'locations' of semantic and episodic memory.]]

====Episodic memory====
{{Main article|Episodic memory}}
[[Episodic memory]] is the autobiographical memory that individuals possess which contains events, emotions, and knowledge associated with a given context.

====Semantic memory====
{{Main article|Semantic memory}}
[[Semantic memory]] does not refer to concept-based knowledge stored about a specific experience like episodic memory. Instead it includes the memory of meanings, understandings, general knowledge about the world, and factual information etc. This makes semantic knowledge independent of context and personal information. Semantic memory enables an individual to know information, including information about their selves, without having to consciously recall the experiences that taught them such knowledge.

=====Semantic self as the source=====
People are able to maintain a sense of self that is supported by semantic knowledge of personal facts in the absence of direct access to the memories that describe the episodes on which the knowledge is based.
* Individuals have been shown to maintain a sense of self despite catastrophic impairments in episodic recollection. For example, subject W.J., who suffered dense ''[[retrograde amnesia]]'' leaving her unable to recall any events that occurred prior to the development of amnesia. However, her memory for general facts about her life during the period of amnesia remained intact.
:*This suggests that a separate type of knowledge contributes to the self-concept, as W.J.'s knowledge could not have come from her episodic memory.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, S. B., Loftus, J., &amp; Kihlstrom, J. F. (1996). Self-knowledge of an amnesia patient: Toward a neuropsychology of personality and social psychology. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology, 125,''250-160&lt;/ref&gt;
:**A similar dissociation occurred in K.C. who suffered a total loss of episodic memory, but still knew a variety of facts about himself.&lt;ref&gt;Tulving, E. (1989). Remembering and knowing the past. ''American Scientist, 77,''361-367&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tulving, E., Schacter, D. L., McLachlan, D. R., &amp; Moscovitch, M. (1988). Priming of semantic autobiographical knowledge: A case study of retrograde amnesia. ''Brain and Cognition, 8,''3-20&lt;/ref&gt;
:*Evidence also exists that shows how patients with severe [[amnesia]] can have accurate and detailed semantic knowledge of what they are like as a person, for example which particular personality traits and characteristics they possess.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, S. B., &amp; Loftus, J. (1993). The mental representation of trait and autobiographical knowledge about the self. (As cited in Sedikedes, C., &amp; Brewer, M. B. (Eds.), ''Individual self, relational self, collective self.'' (pp. 36). Philadelphia, PA: Psychology Press)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klein, S. B., Chan, R. L., &amp; Loftus, J. (1999). Independence of episodic and semantic self-knowledge: The case from autism. ''Social Cognition, 17,''413-436&lt;/ref&gt;
This evidence for the dissociation between episodic and semantic self-knowledge has made several things clear:
# Episodic memory is not the only drawing point for self-knowledge, contrary to long-held beliefs. Self-knowledge must therefore be expanded to include the semantic component of memory.&lt;ref&gt;Cermack, L. S., &amp; O'Connor, M. (1983). The anteriograde retrieval ability of a patient with amnesia due to encephalitis. ''Neuropsychologia, 21,''213-234&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evans, J., Wilson, B., Wraight, E. P., &amp; Hodges, J. R. (1993). Neuropsychological and SPECT scan findings during and after transient global amnesia: Evidence for the differential impairment of remote episodic memory. ''Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry, 56,''1227-1230&lt;/ref&gt;
# Self-knowledge about the traits one possesses can be accessed without the need for episodic retrieval. This is shown through study of individuals with neurological impairments that make it impossible to recollect trait-related experiences, yet who can still make reliable and accurate trait-ratings of themselves, and even revise these judgements based on new experiences they cannot even recall.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, S. B., Kihlstrom, J. F., 7 Loftus, J. (2000). ''Preserved and impaired self-knowledge in amnesia: A case study''. Unpublished manuscript.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motives that guide our search==
People have goals that lead them to seek, notice, and interpret information about themselves. These goals begin the quest for self-knowledge.
There are three primary motives that lead us in the search for self-knowledge:
* Self-enhancement
* Accuracy
* Consistency

===Self-enhancement===
{{Main article|Self-enhancement}}
'''[[Self-enhancement]]''' refers to the fact that people seem motivated to experience positive emotional states and to avoid experiencing negative emotional states. People are motivated to feel good about themselves in order to maximize their feelings of self-worth, thus enhancing their [[self-esteem]].&lt;br /&gt;
The emphasis on ''feelings'' differs slightly from how other theories have previously defined self-enhancement needs, for example the ''Contingencies of Self-Worth Model''.&lt;ref&gt;Crocker, J., &amp; Wolfe, C. T. (2001). Contingencies of self-worth. ''Psychological Review, 108,''593-623&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Other theorists have taken the term to mean that people are motivated to '''''think''''' about themselves in highly favorable terms, rather than '''''feel''''' they are "good".&lt;ref&gt;Swann, W. B., Jr. (1990). To be adored or to be known? The interplay of self-enhancement and self-verification. (As cited in Brown, J. D. (1998). ''The self.'' USA: McGraw-Hill)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosenburg, M. (1979). ''Conceiving the self.'' New York: Basic Books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In many situations and cultures, feelings of self-worth are promoted by thinking of oneself as highly capable or ''better'' than one's peers. However, in some situations and cultures, feelings of self-worth are promoted by thinking of oneself as ''average'' or even ''worse'' than others. In both cases, thoughts about the self still serve to enhance feelings of self-worth.
The universal need is not a need to think about oneself in any specific way, rather a need to maximize one's feelings of self-worth. This is the meaning of the self enhancement motive with respect to self-knowledge.

====Arguments====
In Western societies, feelings of self-worth ''are'' in fact promoted by thinking of oneself in favorable terms.
* In this case, self-enhancement needs lead people to seek information about themselves in such a way that they are likely to conclude that they truly possess what they see as a positive defining quality.

See "[[#Self-verification theory|Self-verification theory]]" section.

===Accuracy===
Accuracy needs influence the way in which people search for self-knowledge. People frequently wish to know the truth about themselves without regard as to whether they learn something positive or negative.&lt;ref&gt;Trope, Y. (1986). Self-enhancement, self-assessment, and achievement behavior. (As cited in Brown, J. D. (1998). ''The self.'' USA: McGraw-Hill)&lt;/ref&gt;
There are three considerations which underlie this need:&lt;ref&gt;Brown, J. D. (1991). Accuracy and bias in self-knowledge. (As cited in Brown, J. D. (1998). ''The self.'' USA: McGraw-Hill)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Occasionally people simply want to reduce any uncertainty. They may want to know for the sheer intrinsic pleasure of knowing what they are truly like.
* Some people believe they have a moral ''obligation'' to know what they are really like. This view holds particularly strong in [[theology]] and [[philosophy]], particularly [[existentialism]].
* Knowing what one is really like can sometimes help an individual to achieve their goals. The basic fundamental goal to any living thing is survival, therefore accurate self-knowledge can be adaptive to survival.&lt;ref name="Festinger, L. 1954"&gt;Festinger, L. (1954). A theory of social comparison processes. ''Human Relations, 7,''117-140&lt;/ref&gt;
Accurate self-knowledge can also be instrumental in maximizing feelings of self-worth.&lt;ref&gt;Sedikedes, C., &amp; Strube, M. J. (1997). Self-evaluation: To thine own self be good, to thine own self be sure, to thine own self be true, and to thine own self be better. ''Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 29''&lt;/ref&gt; Success is one of the number of things that make people feel good about themselves, and knowing what we are like can make successes more likely, so self-knowledge can again be adaptive. This is because self-enhancement needs can be met by knowing that one ''can not'' do something particularly well, thus protecting the person from pursuing a dead-end dream that is likely to end in failure.

===Consistency===
Many theorists believe that we have a motive to protect the self-concept (and thus our self-knowledge) from change.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, S. (1980). The self-concept: A review and the proposal of an integrated theory of personality. (As cited in Brown, J. D. (1998). ''The self.'' USA: McGraw-Hill)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lecky, P. (1945). ''Self-consistency: A theory of personality.'' New York: Island Press&lt;/ref&gt; This motive to have consistency leads people to look for and welcome information that is consistent with what they believe to be true about themselves; likewise, they will avoid and reject information which presents inconsistencies with their beliefs. This phenomenon is also known as [[self-verification theory]].
Not everyone has been shown to pursue a self-consistency motive;&lt;ref&gt;Steele, C. M., &amp; Spencer, S. J. (1992). The primacy of self-integrity. ''Psychological Enquiry, 3,''345-346&lt;/ref&gt; but it has played an important role in various other influential theories, such as  [[Cognitive dissonance|cognitive dissonance theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Festinger, L. (1957). ''A theory of cognitive dissonance.'' Evanston, IL: Row Peterson&lt;/ref&gt;

====Self-verification theory====
{{Main article|Self-verification theory}}This theory was put forward by [[William Swann]] of the [[University Of Texas|University of Texas at Austin]] in 1983 to put a name to the aforementioned phenomena. The theory states that once a person develops an idea about what they are like, they will strive to verify the accompanying self-views.&lt;ref&gt;Swann, W. B., Jr. (1983). Self-verification: Bringing social reality into harmony with the self. (As cited in Suls, J., &amp; Greenwald, A. G. (Eds.), ''Social psychological perspectives on the self, 2,''33-66. Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum)&lt;/ref&gt;
Two considerations are thought to drive the search for self-verifying feedback:&lt;ref&gt;Swann, W. B., Jr., Stein-Seroussi, A., &amp; Giesler, R. B. (1992). Why people self-verify. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 62,''392-401&lt;/ref&gt;
* We feel more comfortable and secure when we believe that others see us in the same way that we see ourselves. Actively seeking self-verifying feedback helps people avoid finding out that they are wrong about their self-views.
* Self-verification theory assumes that social interactions will proceed more smoothly and profitably when other people view us the same way as we view ourselves. This provides a second reason to selectively seek self-verifying feedback.
These factors of self-verification theory create controversy when persons suffering from low-self-esteem are taken into consideration. People who hold negative self-views about themselves ''selectively seek negative feedback'' in order to verify their self-views. This is in stark contrast to self-enhancement motives that suggest people are driven by the desire to feel good about themselves.

==Sources==
There are three sources of information available to an individual through which to search for knowledge about the self:
* The physical world
* The social world
* The psychological world

===The physical world===
The physical world is generally a highly visible, and quite easily measurable source of information about one's self. Information one may be able to obtain from the physical world may include:
* Weight - by weighing oneself.
* Strength - by measuring how much one can lift.
* Height - by measuring oneself.

====Limitations====
* Many attributes are not measurable in the physical world, such as kindness, cleverness and sincerity.
* Even when attributes can be assessed with reference to the physical world, the knowledge that we gain is not necessarily the knowledge we are seeking. Every measure is simply a ''relative measure'' to the level of that attribute in, say, the general population or another specific individual.
** This means that any measurement only merits meaning when it is expressed in respect to the measurements of others.
** Most of our personal identities are therefore sealed in comparative terms from the social world.

===The social world===
The comparative nature of self-views means that people rely heavily on the social world when seeking information about their selves. Two particular processes are important:
* ''[[Social comparison theory|Social Comparison Theory]]''&lt;ref name="Festinger, L. 1954"/&gt;
* ''Reflected Appraisals''

====Social comparison====
{{Main article|Social comparison theory}}
People compare attributes with others and draw inferences about what they themselves are like. However, the conclusions a person ultimately draws depend on whom in particular they compare themselves with. The need for accurate self-knowledge was originally thought to guide the social comparison process, and researchers assumed that comparing with others who are similar to us in the ''important'' ways is more informative.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, J. V. (1989). Theory and research concerning social comparisons of personal attributes. ''Psychological Bulletin'', ''106'', 231-248&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Complications of the social comparison theory=====
People are also known to compare themselves with people who are slightly better off than they themselves are (known as an ''upward comparison'');&lt;ref&gt;Collins, R. L. (1996). For better or worse: The impact of upward social comparisons on self-evaluations. ''Psychological Bulletin, 119,''51-69&lt;/ref&gt; and with people who are slightly worse off or disadvantaged (known as a ''downward comparison'').&lt;ref&gt;Wills, T. A. (1981). Downward comparison principles in social psychology. ''Psychological Bulletin 90,''245-271&lt;/ref&gt;
There is also substantial evidence that the need for ''accurate'' self-knowledge is neither the only, nor most important factor that guides the social comparison process,&lt;ref&gt;Helgeson, V. S., &amp; Mickelson, K. D. (1995). Motives for social comparison. ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 21,''1200-1209&lt;/ref&gt; the need to feel good about ourselves affects the social comparison process.

====Reflected appraisals====
'''Reflected appraisals''' occur when a person observes how others respond to them. The process was first explained by the [[Sociology|sociologist]] Charles H. Cooley in 1902 as part of his discussion of the "''looking-glass self''", which describes how we see ourselves reflected in other peoples' eyes.&lt;ref name="cooley1902"&gt;Cooley, C. H. (1902). ''Human nature and the social order.'' New York: Charles Scribner's Sons&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that a person's feelings towards themselves are socially determined via a three-step process:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"A self-idea of this sort seems to have three principled elements: the imagination of our appearance to the other person; the imagination of his judgment of that appearance; and some sort of self-feeling, such as pride or mortification. The comparison with a looking-glass hardly suggests the second element, the imagined judgment which is quite essential. The thing that moves us to pride or shame is not the mere mechanical reflection of ourselves, but an imputed sentiment, the imagined effect of this reflection upon another's mind." (Cooley, 1902, p.153)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In simplified terms, Cooley's three stages are:&lt;ref name="cooley1902" /&gt;
# We imagine how we appear in the eyes of another person.
# We then imagine how that person is evaluating us.
# The imagined evaluation leads us to feel good or bad, in accordance with the judgement we have conjured.
Note that this model is of a [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenological]] nature.

In 1963, John W. Kinch adapted Cooley's model to explain how a person's ''thoughts''  about themselves develop rather than their ''feelings''.&lt;ref&gt;Kinch, J. W. (1963). A formalized theory of self-concept. ''American Journal of Sociology, 68,''481-486&lt;/ref&gt;

Kinch's three stages were:
# Actual appraisals - what other people actually think of us.
# Perceived appraisals - our perception of these appraisals.
# Self-appraisals - our ideas about what we are like based on the perceived appraisals.
This model is also of a phenomenological approach.

=====Arguments against the reflected appraisal models=====
Research has only revealed limited support for the models and various arguments raise their heads:
* People are not generally good at knowing what an individual thinks about them.&lt;ref&gt;Felson, R. B. (1993). The (somewhat) social self: How others affect self-appraisals. (As cited in Brown, J. D. (1998). ''The self.'' USA: McGraw-Hill)&lt;/ref&gt;
** Felson believes this is due to communication barriers and imposed social norms which place limits on the information people receive from others. This is especially true when the feedback would be negative; people rarely give one another negative feedback, so people rarely conclude that another person dislikes them or is evaluating them negatively.
* Despite being largely unaware of how one person in particular is evaluating them, people are better at knowing what other people ''on the whole'' think.&lt;ref&gt;Kenny, D. A., &amp; DePaulo, B. M. (1993). Do people know how others view them? An empirical and theoretical account. ''Psychological Bulletin, 114,''145-161&lt;/ref&gt;
** The reflected appraisal model assumes that ''actual appraisals'' determine ''perceived appraisals''. Although this may in fact occur, the influence of a common third variable could also produce an association between the two.

The sequence of reflected appraisals may accurately characterize patterns in early childhood due to the large amount of feedback infants receive from their parents, yet it appears to be less relevant later in life. This is because people are not passive, as the model assumes. People ''actively'' and ''selectively'' process information from the social world. Once a person's ideas about themselves take shape, these also influence the manner in which new information is gathered and interpreted, and thus the cycle continues.

===The psychological world===
'''The psychological world''' describes our "inner world". There are three processes that influence how people acquire knowledge about themselves:
* [[Introspection]]
* [[Self-perception theory|Self-perception processes]]
* [[Attribution (psychology)|Causal attributions]]

====Introspection====
[[Introspection]] involves looking inwards and directly consulting our attitudes, feelings and thoughts for meaning.
Consulting one's own thoughts and feelings can sometimes result in meaningful self-knowledge. The accuracy of introspection, however, has been called into question since the 1970s. Generally, introspection relies on people's explanatory theories of the self and their world, the accuracy of which is not necessarily related to the form of self-knowledge that they are attempting to assess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nisbett|first1=Richard E.|last2=Wilson|first2=Timothy D.|title=Telling more than we can know: Verbal reports on mental processes.|journal=Psychological Review|date=1977|volume=84|issue=3|pages=231–259|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.84.3.231}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* A stranger's ratings about a participant are more correspondent to the participant's self-assessment ratings when the stranger has been subject to the participant's thoughts and feelings than when the stranger has been subject to the participant's behavior alone, or a combination of the two.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, S. M. (1984). Self-knowledge and social inference: II. The diagnosticity of cognitive/affective and behavioral data. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 46,''280-293&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Comparing sources of introspection.''' People believe that spontaneous forms of thought provide more meaningful self-insight than more deliberate forms of thinking. Morewedge, Giblin, and Norton (2014) found that the more spontaneous a kind of thought, the more spontaneous a particular thought, and the more spontaneous thought a particular thought was perceived to be, the more insight into the self it was attributed. In addition, the more meaning the thought was attributed, the more the particular thought influenced their judgment and decision making. People asked to let their mind wander until they randomly thought of a person to whom they were attracted to, for example, reported that the person they identified provided them with more self-insight than people asked to simply think of a person to whom they were attracted to. Moreover, the greater self-insight attributed to the person identified by the (former) random thought process than by the latter deliberate thought process led those people in the random condition to report feeling more attracted to the person they identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morewedge|first1=Carey K.|last2=Giblin|first2=Colleen E.|last3=Norton|first3=Michael I.|title=The (perceived) meaning of spontaneous thoughts.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|date=2014|volume=143|issue=4|pages=1742–1754|doi=10.1037/a0036775}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Arguments against introspection=====
&lt;!-- are these meant to be arguments against the reliability of introspection, or arguments why it's not a good idea to introspect? needs to be made clear --&gt;
Whether introspection always fosters self-insight is not entirely clear. Thinking too much about why we feel the way we do about something can sometimes confuse us and undermine true self-knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, T. D., &amp; Hodges, S. D. (1992). Attitudes as temporary constructions. (As cited in Brown, J. D. (1998). ''The self.'' USA: McGraw-Hill)&lt;/ref&gt; Participants in an introspection condition are less accurate when predicting their own future behavior than controls&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, T. D., &amp; LaFleur, S. J. (1995). Knowing what you'll do: Effects of analyzing reasons on self-prediction. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 68,''21-35&lt;/ref&gt; and are less satisfied with their choices and decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, T. D., Lisle, D., Schooler, J., Hodges, S. D., Klaaren, K. J., &amp; LaFleur, S. J. (1993). Introspecting about reasons can reduce post-choice satisfaction. ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 19,''331-339&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it is important to notice that introspection allows the exploration of the consious mind only, and does not take into account the unconscious motives and processes, as found and formulated by Freud. 

====Self-perception processes====
{{Main article|Self-perception theory}}
Wilson's work is based on the assumption that people are not always aware of ''why'' they feel the way they do. Bem's '''self-perception theory'''&lt;ref&gt;Bem, D. J. (1972). Self-perception theory. (As cited in Brown, J. D. (1998). ''The self.'' USA: McGraw-Hill)&lt;/ref&gt; makes a similar assumption.
The theory is concerned with how people ''explain'' their behavior. It argues that people don't always ''know'' why they do what they do. When this occurs, they infer the causes of their behavior by analyzing their behavior in the context in which it occurred. Outside observers of the behavior would reach a similar conclusion as the individual performing it. The individuals then draw logical conclusions about why they behaved as they did.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Individuals come to "know" their own attitudes, emotions, and other internal states partially by inferring them from observations of their own overt behavior and/or the circumstances in which this behavior occurs. Thus, to the extent that internal cues are weak, ambiguous, or uninterpretable, the individual is functionally in the same position as an outside observer, an observer who must necessarily rely upon those same external cues to infer the individual's inner states." (Bem, 1972, p.2)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The theory has been applied to a wide range of phenomena. Under particular conditions, people have been shown to infer their attitudes,&lt;ref&gt;Olson, J. M., &amp; Hafer, C. L. (1990). Self-inference processes: Looking back and ahead. (As cited in Brown, J. D. (1998). ''The self.'' USA: McGraw-Hill)&lt;/ref&gt; emotions,&lt;ref&gt;Laird, J. D. (1974). Self-attribution and emotion: The effects of expressive behavior on the quality of emotional experience. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 29,''475-486&lt;/ref&gt; and motives,&lt;ref&gt;Lepper, M. R., Greene, D., &amp; Nisbett, R. E. (1973). Undermining of children's intrinsic interest with extrinsic rewards: A test of the "overjustification" hypothesis. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 28,''129-137&lt;/ref&gt; in the same manner described by the theory.

Similar to introspection, but with an important difference: with introspection we ''directly examine'' our attitudes, feelings and motives. With self-perception processes we ''indirectly infer'' our attitudes, feelings, and motives by ''analyzing our behavior''.

====Causal attributions====
Causal attributions are an important source of self-knowledge, especially when people make attributions for positive and negative events. The key elements in self-perception theory are explanations people give for their actions, these explanations are known as causal attributions.

Causal attributions provide answers to "Why?" questions by attributing a person's behavior (including our own) to a cause.&lt;ref&gt;Weiner, B. (1985). An attributional theory of achievement motivation and emotion. ''Psychological Review, 92,''548-573&lt;/ref&gt;

People also gain self-knowledge by making attributions for ''other people's'' behavior; for example "If nobody wants to spend time with me it must be because I'm boring".

==Activation==
Individuals think of themselves in many different ways, yet only some of these ideas are active at any one given time. The idea that is specifically active at a given time is known as the '''Current Self-Representation'''. Other theorists have referred to the same thing in several different ways:
* The phenomenal self&lt;ref&gt;Jones, E. E., &amp; Gerard, H. B. (1967). ''Foundations of social psychology.'' New York: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt;
* Spontaneous self-concept&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, W. J., &amp; McGuire, C. V. (1981). The spontaneous self-concept as affected by personal distinctiveness. (As cited in Brown, J. D. (1998). ''The self.'' USA: McGraw-Hill)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Self-identifications&lt;ref&gt;Schlenker, B. R., &amp; Weigold, M. F. (1989). Goals and the self-identification process: Constructing desired identities. (As cited in Brown, J. D. (1998). ''The self.'' USA: McGraw-Hill)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Aspects of the working self-concept&lt;ref name="Markus, H. 1986"&gt;Markus, H., &amp; Kunda, Z. (1986). Stability and malleability of the self-concept. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51,''858-866&lt;/ref&gt;
The current self-representation influences information processing, emotion, and behavior and is influenced by both ''personal'' and ''situational'' factors.

===Personal factors that influence current self-representation===

====Self-concept====
[[Self-concept]], or how people ''usually'' think of themselves is the most important personal factor that influences current self-representation. This is especially true for attributes that are important and self-defining.

Self-concept is also known as the self-schema, made of innumerable smaller self-schemas that are "chronically accessible".&lt;ref name="Markus, H. 1986"/&gt;

====Self-esteem====
[[Self-esteem]] affects the way people feel about themselves. People with high self-esteem are more likely to be thinking of themselves in positive terms at a given time than people suffering low self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, J. D., &amp; Mankowski, T. A. (1993). Self-esteem, mood, and self-evaluation: Changes in mood and the way you see you. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 64,''421-430&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mood state====
Mood state influences the accessibility of positive and negative self-views.

When we are happy we tend to think more about our positive qualities and attributes, whereas when we are sad our negative qualities and attributes become more accessible.&lt;ref&gt;Sedikides, C. (1995). Central and peripheral self-conceptions are differentially influenced by mood: Tests of the different sensitivity hypothesis. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 69,''759-777&lt;/ref&gt;

This link is particularly strong for people suffering low self-esteem.

====Goals====
People can deliberately activate particular self-views. We select appropriate images of ourselves depending on what role we wish to play in a given situation.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, M. (1979). Self-monitoring processes (As cited in Brown, J. D. (1998). ''The self.'' USA: McGraw-Hill)&lt;/ref&gt;

One particular goal that influences activation of self-views is the desire to feel good.&lt;ref&gt;Kunda, Z., &amp; Santioso, R. (1989). Motivated changes in the self-concept. ''Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 25,''272-285&lt;/ref&gt;

===Situational factors that influence current self-representation===

====Social roles====
How a person thinks of themselves depends largely on the social role they are playing. Social roles influence our personal identities.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, B. W., &amp; Donahue, E. M. (1994). One personality, multiple selves: Integrating personality and social roles. ''Journals of Personality, 62,''199-218&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social context and self-description====
People tend to think of themselves in ways that distinguish them from their social surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, L. J., &amp; Miller, D. T. (1995). The distinctiveness effect in social categorization: You are what makes you unusual. ''Psychological Science, 6,''246-249&lt;/ref&gt;
* The more distinctive the attribute, the more likely it will be used to describe oneself.
Distinctiveness also influences the salience of '''group identities'''.
:[[Self-categorization theory]]&lt;ref&gt;Turner, J. C., Hogg, M. A., Oakes, P. J., Reicher, S. D., &amp; Wetherell, M. S. (1987). ''Rediscovering the social group: A self-categorization theory.'' Oxford, England: Basil Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; proposes that whether people are thinking about themselves in terms of either their social groups or various personal identities depends partly on the social context.
* Group identities are more salient in the intergroup contexts.

=====Group size=====
The size of the group affects the salience of group-identities. Minority groups are more distinctive, so group identity should be more salient among minority group members than majority group members.

=====Group status=====
Group status interacts with group size to affect the salience of social identities.

====Social context and self-evaluation====
The social environment has an influence on the way people evaluate themselves as a result of social-comparison processes.

=====The contrast effect=====
People regard themselves as at the opposite end of the spectrum of a given trait to the people in their company.&lt;ref&gt;Morse, S., &amp; Gergen, K. J. (1970). Social comparison, self-consistency, and the concept of the self. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 16,''148-156&lt;/ref&gt; However, this effect has come under criticism as to whether it is a primary effect, as it seems to share space with the assimilation effect, which states that people evaluate themselves more positively when they are in the company of others who are exemplary on some dimension.
* Whether the assimilation or contrast effect prevails depends on the psychological closeness, with people feeling psychologically disconnected with their social surroundings being more likely to show contrast effects. Assimilation effects occur when the subject feels psychologically connected to their social surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, M. B., &amp; Weber, J. G. (1994). Self-evaluation effects of interpersonal versus intergroup social comparison. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 66,''268-275&lt;/ref&gt;

====Significant others and self-evaluations====
Imagining how one appears to others has an effect on how one thinks about oneself.&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, M. W. (1994). Primed relational schemas as a source of self-evaluative reactions. ''Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology, 13,''380-403&lt;/ref&gt;

====Recent events====
Recent events can cue particular views of the self, either as a direct result of failure, or via mood.
:The extent of the effect depends on personal variables. For example people with high self-esteem do not show this effect, and sometimes do the opposite.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, J. D., &amp; Smart, S. A. (1991). The self and social conduct: Linking self-representations to prosocial behavior. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 60,''368-375&lt;/ref&gt;
Memory for prior events influence how people think about themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Kunda, Z. (1990). The case for motivated reasoning. ''Psychological Bulletin, 108,''480-498&lt;/ref&gt;
:Fazio et al. found that selective memory for prior events can temporarily activate self-representations which, once activated, guide our behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Fazio, R. H., Effrein, E. A., &amp; Falender, V. J. (1981). Self-perception following social interaction. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 41,''232-242&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deficiencies==

===Specific types===

====Misperceiving====
*Deficiency in knowledge of the ''present self''.
*Giving reasons but not feelings disrupts self-insight.

====Misremembering====
*Deficiency of knowledge of the ''past self''.
*Knowledge from the present ''overinforms'' the knowledge of the past.
*False theories shape autobiographical memory.

====Misprediction====
*Deficiency of knowledge of the ''future self''.
*Knowledge of the present ''overinforms'' predictions of future knowledge.
*[[Affective forecasting]] can be affected by [[durability bias]].

====Miswanting====

{{refimprove|date=February 2010}}
'''Modular self-reconfiguring [[robot]]ic systems''' or '''self-reconfigurable modular robots''' are autonomous kinematic [[machine]]s with variable [[Morphology (materials science)|morphology]]. Beyond conventional actuation, sensing and control typically found in [[fixed-morphology robot]]s, [[self-reconfiguring robot]]s are also able to deliberately change their own shape by rearranging the connectivity of their parts, in order to adapt to new circumstances, perform new tasks, or recover from damage.

For example, a robot made of such components could assume a [[worm]]-like shape to move through a narrow pipe, reassemble into something with [[spider]]-like legs to cross uneven terrain, then form a third arbitrary object (like a ball or wheel that can spin itself) to move quickly over a fairly flat terrain; it can also be used for making "fixed" objects, such as walls, shelters, or buildings.

In some cases this involves each module having 2 or more connectors for connecting several together. They can contain [[electronics]], [[sensor]]s, [[computer processor]]s, [[memory]] and [[power supplies]]; they can also contain [[actuator]]s that are used for manipulating their location in the environment and in relation with each other. A feature found in some cases is the ability of the modules to automatically connect and disconnect themselves to and from each other, and to form into many objects or perform many tasks moving or manipulating the environment.

By saying "self-reconfiguring" or "self-reconfigurable" it means that the mechanism or device is capable of utilizing its own system of control such as with actuators or [[stochastic]] means to change its overall structural shape. Having the quality of being "modular" in "self-reconfiguring modular robotics" is to say that the same module or set of modules can be added to or removed from the system, as opposed to being generically "modularized" in the broader sense. The underlying intent is to have an indefinite number of identical modules, or a finite and relatively small set of identical modules, in a mesh or matrix structure of self-reconfigurable modules.

Self-reconfiguration is different from the concept of [[self-replication]], which is not a quality that a self-reconfigurable module or collection of modules needs to possess. A matrix of modules does not need to be able to increase the quantity of modules in its matrix to be considered self-reconfigurable. It is sufficient for self-reconfigurable modules to be produced at a conventional factory, where dedicated machines stamp or mold components that are then [[Assembly line|assembled]] into a module, and added to an existing matrix in order to supplement it to increase the quantity or to replace worn out modules.

A matrix made up of many modules can separate to form multiple matrices with fewer modules, or they can combine, or recombine, to form a larger matrix.  Some advantages of separating into multiple matrices include the ability to tackle multiple and simpler tasks at locations that are remote from each other simultaneously, transferring through barriers with openings that are too small for a single larger matrix to fit through but not too small for smaller matrix fragments or individual modules, and energy saving purposes by only utilizing enough modules to accomplish a given task.  Some advantages of combining multiple matrices into a single matrix is ability to form larger structures such as an elongated bridge, more complex structures such as a robot with many arms or an arm with more degrees of freedom, and increasing strength.  Increasing strength, in this sense, can be in the form of increasing the rigidity of a fixed or static structure, increasing the net or collective amount of force for raising, lowering, pushing, or pulling another object, or another part of the matrix, or any combination of these features.

There are two basic methods of segment articulation that self-reconfigurable mechanisms can utilize to reshape their structures: [[chain reconfiguration]] and [[lattice reconfiguration]].

==Structure and control==
Modular robots are usually composed of multiple building blocks of a relatively small repertoire, with uniform docking interfaces that allow transfer of mechanical forces and moments, electrical power and communication throughout the robot.

The modular building blocks usually consist of some primary structural actuated unit, and potentially additional specialized units such as grippers, feet, wheels, cameras, payload and energy storage and generation.

===A taxonomy of architectures===
Modular self-reconfiguring robotic systems can be generally classified into several architectural groups by the geometric arrangement of their unit (lattice vs. chain). Several systems exhibit hybrid properties, and modular robots have also been classified into the two categories of Mobile Configuration Change (MCC) and Whole Body Locomotion (WBL).&lt;ref&gt;P. Moubarak, et al., Modular and Reconfigurable Mobile Robotics, Journal of Robotics and Autonomous Systems, 60 (12) (2012) 1648 – 1663&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:MicroUnit.png|thumb|Lattice architecture: 12 modules of the homogeneous lattice system Micro Unit assembled together shown with corresponding grid and docking points network]]
* '''Lattice architecture''' have their units connecting their docking interfaces at points into virtual cells of some regular grid. This network of docking points can be compared to atoms in a crystal and the grid to the lattice of that crystal. Therefore, the kinematical features of lattice robots can be characterized by their corresponding crystallographic displacement groups (chiral [[space group]]s).&lt;ref&gt;N. Brener, F. Ben Amar, and P. Bidaud, "Characterization of Lattice Modular Robots by Discrete Displacement Groups", in ''IEEE/RSJ Int. Conf. on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)'', Tapei, Taiwan, October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Usually few units are sufficient to accomplish a reconfiguration step. Lattice architectures allows a simpler mechanical design and a simpler computational representation and reconfiguration planning that can be more easily scaled to complex systems.
* '''Chain architecture''' do not use a virtual network of docking points for their units. The units are able to reach any point in the space and are therefore more versatile, but a chain of many units may be necessary to reach a point making it usually more difficult to accomplish a reconfiguration step. Such systems are also more computationally difficult to represent and analyze.
* '''Hybrid architecture''' takes advantages of both previous architectures. Control and mechanism are designed for lattice reconfiguration but also allow to reach any point in the space.

Modular robotic systems can also be classified according to the way by which units are reconfigured (moved) into place.

* '''Deterministic reconfiguration''' relies on units moving or being directly manipulated into their target location during reconfiguration. The exact location of each unit is known at all times. Reconfiguration times can be guaranteed, but sophisticated feedback control is necessary to assure precise manipulation. Macro-scale systems are usually deterministic.
* '''Stochastic reconfiguration''' relies on units moving around using statistical processes (like Brownian motion). The exact location of each unit only known when it is connected to the main structure, but it may take unknown paths to move between locations. Reconfiguration times can be guaranteed only statistically. Stochastic architectures are more favorable at micro scales.

Modular robotic systems are also generally classified depending on the design of the modules.

* '''Homogeneous''' modular robot systems have many modules of the same design forming a structure suitable to perform the required task. An advantage over other systems is that they are simple to scale in size (and possibly function), by adding more units. A commonly described disadvantage is limits to functionality - these systems often require more modules to achieve a given function, than heterogeneous systems.
* '''Heterogeneous''' modular robot systems have different modules, each of which do specialized functions, forming a structure suitable to perform a task. An advantage is compactness, and the versatility to design and add units to perform any task. A commonly described disadvantage is an increase in complexity of design, manufacturing, and simulation methods.

Other modular robotic systems exist which are not self-reconfigurable, and thus do not formally belong to this family of robots though they may have similar appearance. For example, [[self-assembling]] systems may be composed of multiple modules but cannot dynamically control their target shape. Similarly, tensegrity robotics may be composed of multiple interchangeable modules but cannot self-reconfigure.

==Motivation and inspiration==
There are two key motivations for designing modular self-reconfiguring robotic systems.

* '''Functional advantage''': Self reconfiguring robotic systems are potentially more '''robust''' and more '''adaptive''' than conventional systems. The reconfiguration ability allows a robot or a group of robots to disassemble and reassemble machines to form new morphologies that are better suitable for new tasks, such as changing from a legged robot to a snake robot ([[snakebot]]) and then to a rolling robot. Since robot parts are interchangeable (within a robot and between different robots), machines can also replace faulty parts autonomously, leading to self-repair.

[[File:SpaceMolecubes.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Autonomous modular robotics in space]]

* '''Economic advantage''': Self reconfiguring robotic systems can potentially lower overall robot cost by making a range of complex machines out of a single (or relatively few) types of mass-produced modules.

Both these advantages have not yet been fully realized. A modular robot is likely to be inferior in performance to any single custom robot tailored for a specific task. However, the advantage of modular robotics is only apparent when considering multiple tasks that would normally require a set of different robots.

The added degrees of freedom make modular robots more versatile in their potential capabilities, but also incur a performance tradeoff and increased mechanical and computational complexities.

The quest for self-reconfiguring robotic structures is to some extent inspired by envisioned applications such as long-term space missions, that require long-term self-sustaining robotic ecology that can handle unforeseen situations and may require self repair. A second source of inspiration are biological systems that are self-constructed out of a relatively small repertoire of lower-level building blocks (cells or amino acids, depending on scale of interest). This architecture underlies biological systems' ability to physically adapt, grow, heal, and even self replicate – capabilities that would be desirable in many engineered systems.

Manufacturer operating in the self-reconfiguring modular robot industry include ABB Ltd., Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd., Yaskawa Electric Corporation, Fanuc Corporation, Kuka AG, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Denso Corporation, Nachi-Fujikoshi Corp., Comau S.P.A., Universal Robots A/S, and CMA Robotics S.P.A. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.coherentmarketinsights.com/ongoing-insight/self-reconfiguring-modular-robot-market-1180 Manufacturer of self-reconfiguring modular robot] Retrieved 19-09-2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application areas==
Given these advantages, where would a modular self-reconfigurable system be used? While the system has the promise of being capable of doing a wide variety of things, finding the "[[killer application]]" has been somewhat elusive. Here are several examples:

===Space exploration===
One application that highlights the advantages of self-reconfigurable systems is long-term space missions.&lt;ref name="space"&gt;{{cite web
| publisher = Palo Alto Research Center ([[PARC (company)|PARC]])
| year = 2004
| url = http://www2.parc.com/spl/projects/modrobots/publications/pdf/space.pdf
| title = Modular Reconfigurable Robots in Space Applications
| format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; These require long-term self-sustaining robotic ecology that can handle unforeseen situations and may require self repair. Self-reconfigurable systems have the ability to handle tasks that are not known a priori, especially compared to fixed configuration systems. In addition, space missions are highly volume- and mass-constrained. Sending a robot system that can reconfigure to achieve many tasks may be more effective than sending many robots that each can do one task.

===Telepario===
Another example of an application has been coined "telepario" by CMU professors Todd Mowry and Seth Goldstein. What the researchers propose to make are moving, physical,
three-dimensional replicas of people or objects, so lifelike that human senses would accept them as real. This would eliminate the need for cumbersome virtual reality gear and overcome the viewing angle limitations of modern 3D approaches. The replicas would mimic the shape and appearance of a person or object being imaged in real time, and as the originals moved, so would their replicas. One aspect of this application is that the main development thrust is geometric representation rather than applying forces to the environment as in a typical robotic manipulation task. This project is widely known as claytronics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~claytronics/|title=Claytronics - Carnegie Mellon University|first=Carnegie Mellon|last=University|date=|website=www.cs.cmu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Programmable matter]] (noting that programmable matter is a much more general term, encompassing functional programmable materials, as well).

===Bucket of stuff===
A third long term vision for these systems has been called "bucket of stuff". In this vision, consumers of the future have a container of self-reconfigurable modules say in their garage, basement, or attic. When the need arises, the consumer calls forth the robots to achieve a task such as "clean the gutters" or "change the oil in the car" and the robot assumes the shape needed and does the task.

== History and state of the art ==
The roots of the concept of modular self-reconfigurable robots can be traced back to the "quick change" end effector and automatic tool changers in computer numerical controlled machining centers in the 1970s. Here, special modules each with a common connection mechanism could be automatically swapped out on the end of a robotic arm. However, taking the basic concept of the common connection mechanism and applying it to the whole robot was introduced by Toshio Fukuda with the CEBOT (short for cellular robot) in the late 1980s.

The early 1990s saw further development from Greg Chirikjian, Mark Yim, Joseph Michael, and Satoshi Murata. Chirikjian, Michael, and Murata developed lattice reconfiguration systems and Yim developed a chain based system. While these researchers started with from a mechanical engineering emphasis, designing and building modules then developing code to program them, the work of Daniela Rus and Wei-min Shen developed hardware but had a greater impact on the programming aspects. They started a trend towards provable or verifiable distributed algorithms for the control of large numbers of modules.

One of the more interesting hardware platforms recently has been the MTRAN II and III systems developed by Satoshi Murata et al. This system is a hybrid chain and lattice system. It has the advantage of being able to achieve tasks more easily like chain systems, yet reconfigure like a lattice system.

More recently new efforts in stochastic self-assembly have been pursued by [[Hod Lipson]] and Eric Klavins. A large effort at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] headed by Seth Goldstein and Todd Mowry has started looking at issues in developing millions of modules.

Many tasks have been shown to be achievable, especially with chain reconfiguration modules. This demonstrates the versatility of these systems however, the other two advantages, robustness and low cost have not been demonstrated. In general the prototype systems developed in the labs have been fragile and expensive as would be expected during any initial development.

There is a growing number of research groups actively involved in modular robotics research. To date, about 30 systems have been designed and constructed, some of which are shown below.

===Some current systems===
[[File:g3dock.jpg|thumb|200px|Polybot G3 Modular self-reconfigurable robot]] 
;PolyBot G3 (2002)
A chain self-reconfiguration system. Each module is about 50&amp;nbsp;mm on a side, and has 1 rotational DOF. It is part of the PolyBot modular robot family that has demonstrated many modes of locomotion including walking: biped, 14 legged, slinky-like, snake-like: concertina in a gopher hole, inchworm gaits, rectilinear undulation and sidewinding gaits, rolling like a tread at up to 1.4&amp;nbsp;m/s, riding a tricycle, climbing: stairs, poles pipes, ramps etc. More information can be found at the polybot webpage at PARC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parc.com/modrobots/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-11-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020804033020/http://www.parc.com/modrobots/ |archivedate=4 August 2002 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:4leg2Cat.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Metamorphosis by a self-reconfigurable robot, M-TRAN III]]
;M-TRAN III (2005)
A hybrid type self-reconfigurable system. Each module is two cube size (65&amp;nbsp;mm side), and has 2 rotational DOF and 6 flat surfaces for connection. It is the 3rd M-TRAN prototypes. Compared with the former (M-TRAN II), speed and reliability of connection is largely improved. As a chain type system, locomotion by CPG (Central Pattern Generator) controller in various shapes has been demonstrated by M-TRAN II. As a lattice type system, it can change its configuration, e.g., between a 4 legged walker to a caterpillar like robot. See the M-TRAN webpage at AIST.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unit.aist.go.jp/is/frrg/dsysd/mtran3/|title=M-TRAN(Modular Transformer)MTRAN|author=|date=|website=unit.aist.go.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;AMOEBA-I (2005)

AMOEBA-I, a three-module reconfigurable mobile robot was developed in Shenyang Institute of Automation (SIA), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) by Liu J G et al.[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=1708645][http://www.springerlink.com/content/m81820061n48jh32/].AMOEBA-I has nine kinds of non-isomorphic configurations and high mobility under unstructured environments.Four generations of its platform have been developed and a series of researches have been carried out on their reconfiguration mechanism, non-isomorphic configurations, tipover stability, and reconfiguration planning. Experiments have demonstrated that such kind structure permits good mobility and high flexibility to uneven terrain. Being hyper-redundant, modularized and reconfigurable, AMOEBA-I has many possible applications such as Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) and space exploration.

'''Stochastic-3D (2005)'''

High spatial resolution for arbitrary three-dimensional shape formation with modular robots can be accomplished using lattice system with large quantities of very small, prospectively microscopic modules. At small scales, and with large quantities of modules, deterministic control over reconfiguration of individual modules will become unfeasible, while stochastic mechanisms will naturally prevail. Microscopic size of modules will make the use of electromagnetic actuation and interconnection prohibitive, as well, as the use of on-board power storage.

Three large scale prototypes were built in attempt to demonstrate dynamically programmable three-dimensional stochastic reconfiguration in a neutral-buoyancy environment. The first prototype used electromagnets for module reconfiguration and interconnection. The modules were 100&amp;nbsp;mm cubes and weighed 0.81&amp;nbsp;kg. The second prototype used stochastic fluidic reconfiguration and interconnection mechanism. Its 130&amp;nbsp;mm cubic modules weighed 1.78&amp;nbsp;kg each and made reconfiguration experiments excessively slow. The current third implementation inherits the fluidic reconfiguration principle. The lattice grid size is 80&amp;nbsp;mm, and the reconfiguration experiments are under way.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Molecubes (2005)'''

This hybrid self-reconfiguring system was built by the [[Cornell]] Computational Synthesis Lab to physically demonstrate artificial kinematic self-reproduction. Each module is a 0.65&amp;nbsp;kg cube with 100&amp;nbsp;mm long edges and one rotational degree of freedom. The axis of rotation is aligned with the cube's longest diagonal. Physical self-reproduction of a three- and a four-module robots was demonstrated. It was also shown that, disregarding the gravity constraints, an infinite number of self-reproducing chain meta-structures can be built from Molecubes.

The programmable parts are stirred randomly on an air-hockey table by randomly actuated air jets. When they collide and stick, they can communicate and decide whether to stay stuck, or if and when to detach. Local interaction rules can be devised and optimized to guide the robots to make any desired global shape.

The SuperBot modules fall into the hybrid architecture. The modules have three degrees of freedom each. The design is based on two previous systems: [http://www.isi.edu/robots/conro Conro] (by the same research group) and [https://web.archive.org/web/20061027060910/http://unit.aist.go.jp/is/dsysd/mtran3/ MTRAN] (by Murata et al.). Each module can connect to another module through one of its six dock connectors. They can communicate and share power through their dock connectors. Several locomotion gaits have been developed for different arrangements of modules. For high-level communication the modules use hormone-based control, a distributed, scalable protocol that does not require the modules to have unique ID's.

'''Miche (2006)'''

The Miche system is a modular lattice system capable of arbitrary shape formation. Each module is an autonomous robot module capable of connecting to and communicating with its immediate neighbors. When assembled into a structure, the modules form a system that can be virtually sculpted using a computer interface and a distributed process. The group of modules collectively decide who is on the final shape and who is not using algorithms that minimize the information transmission and storage. Finally, the modules not in the structure let go and fall off under the control of an external force, in this case gravity.

'''[http://www.idsc.ethz.ch/Research_DAndrea/DFA The Distributed Flight Array] (2009)'''

The Distributed Flight Array is a modular robot consisting of hexagonal-shaped single-rotor units that can take on just about any shape or form. Although each unit is capable of generating enough thrust to lift itself off the ground, on its own it is incapable of flight much like a helicopter cannot fly without its tail rotor. However, when joined together, these units evolve into a sophisticated multi-rotor system capable of coordinated flight and much more. More information can be found [http://www.idsc.ethz.ch/Research_DAndrea/DFA here].

'''[http://biorob.epfl.ch/roombots Roombots] (2009)'''

Roombots have a hybrid architecture. Each module has three degree of freedom, two of them using the diametrical axis within a regular cube, and a third (center) axis of rotation connecting the two spherical parts. All three axes are continuously rotatory. The outer Roombots DOF is using the same axis-orientation as Molecubes, the third, central Roombots axis enables the module to rotate its two outer DOF against each other. This novel feature enables a single Roombots module to locomote on flat terrain, but also to climb a wall, or to cross a concave, perpendicular edge. Convex edges require the assembly of at least two modules into a Roombots "Metamodule". Each module has ten available connector slots, currently two of them are equipped with an active connection mechanism based on mechanical latches.
Roombots are designed for two tasks: to eventually shape objects of daily life, e.g. furniture, and to locomote, e.g. as a quadruped or a tripod robot made from multiple modules.

Being inspired form social insects, multicellular organism and mophogenetic robots. The aim of the Sambot is to develop swarm robotics and  conduct research on the swarm intelligence, self-assembly and co-evolution of the body and brain for autonomous morphogeneous. Differing from swarm robot, self-reconfigurable robot and morphgenetic robot, the research focuses on self-assembly swarm modular robots that interact and dock as an autonomous mobile module with others to achieve swarm intelligence and furtherly discuss the autonomous construction in space station and exploratory tools and artificial complex structures. Each Sambot robot can run as an autonomous individual in wheel and besides, using combination of the sensors and docking mechanism, the robot can interact and dock with the environments and other robots. By the advantage of motion and connection, Sambot swarms can aggregate into a symbiotic or whole organism and generate locomotion as the bionic articular robots. In this case, some self-assembling, self-organizing, self-reconfiguring, and self-repairing function and research are available in design and application view. Inside the modular robot whose size is 80(W)X80(L)X102(H) mm, MCU (ARM and AVR), communication (Zigbee), sensors, power, IMU, positioning modules are embedded.

==Challenges, solutions, and opportunities==
Since the early demonstrations of early modular self-reconfiguring systems, the size, robustness and performance has been continuously improving. In parallel, planning and control algorithms have been progressing to handle thousands of units. There are, however, several key steps that are necessary for these systems to realize their promise of ''adaptability, robustness and low cost''. These steps can be broken down into challenges in the hardware design, in planning and control algorithms and in application. These challenges are often intertwined.

===Hardware design challenges===
The extent to which the promise of self-reconfiguring robotic systems can be realized depends critically on the numbers of modules in the system. To date, only systems with up to about 50 units have been demonstrated, with this number stagnating over almost a decade. There are a number of fundamental limiting factors that govern this number:

* Limits on strength, precision, and field robustness (both mechanical and electrical) of bonding/docking interfaces between modules
* Limits on motor power, motion precision and energetic efficiency of units, (i.e. specific power, specific torque)
* Hardware/software design. Hardware that is designed to make the software problem easier. Self-reconfiguring systems have more tightly coupled hardware and software than any other existing system.

===Planning and control challenges===
Though algorithms have been developed for handling thousands of units in ideal conditions, challenges to scalability remain both in low-level control and high-level planning to overcome realistic constraints:

* Algorithms for parallel-motion for large scale manipulation and locomotion
* Algorithms for robustly handling a variety of failure modes, from misalignments, dead-units (not responding, not releasing) to units that behave erratically.
* Algorithms that determine the optimal configuration for a given task
* Algorithms for optimal (time, energy) reconfiguration plan
* Efficient and scalable (asynchronous) communication among multiple units

===Application challenges===
Though the advantages of Modular self-reconfiguring robotic systems is largely recognized, it has been difficult to identify specific application domains where benefits can be demonstrated in the short term. Some suggested applications are

* [[Space exploration]] and [[Space colonization]] applications, e.g. [[Lunar colonization]]
* Construction of large architectural systems
* Deep sea exploration/mining
* Search and rescue in unstructured environments
* Rapid construction of arbitrary tools under space/weight constraints
* Disaster relief shelters for displaced peoples
* Shelters for impoverished areas which require little on-the-ground expertise to assemble

===Grand Challenges===
Several robotic fields have identified ''Grand Challenges'' that act as a catalyst for development and serve as a short-term goal in absence of immediate ''killer apps''. The Grand Challenge is not in itself a research agenda or milestone, but a means to stimulate and evaluate coordinated progress across multiple technical frontiers. Several Grand Challenges have been proposed for the modular self-reconfiguring robotics field:

* '''Demonstration of a system with &gt;1000 units'''. Physical demonstration of such a system will inevitably require rethinking key hardware and algorithmic issues, as well as handling noise and error.
* '''Robosphere'''. A self-sustaining robotic ecology, isolated for a long period of time (1 year) that needs to sustain operation and accomplish unforeseen tasks without ''any'' human presence.
* '''Self replication''' A system with many units capable of self replication by collecting scattered building blocks will require solving many of the hardware and algorithmic challenges.
* '''Ultimate Construction''' A system capable of making objects out of the components of, say, a wall.
* '''Biofilter analogy''' If the system is ever made small enough to be injected into a mammal, one task may be to monitor molecules in the blood stream and allow some to pass and others not to, somewhat like the [[blood–brain barrier]]. As a challenge, an analogy may be made where system must be able to:
** be inserted into a hole one module's diameter.
** travel some specified distance in a channel that is say roughly 40 x 40 module diameters in area.
** form a barrier fully conforming to the channel (whose shape is non-regular, and unknown beforehand).
** allow some objects to pass and others not to (not based on size).
** Since sensing is not the emphasis of this work, the actual detection of the passable objects should be made trivial.

===Inductive transducers===
A unique potential solution that can be exploited is the use of inductors as transducers. This could be useful for dealing with docking and bonding problems. At the same time it could also be beneficial for its capabilities of docking detection (alignment and finding distance), power transmission, and (data signal) communication. A proof-of-concept video can be seen 
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEZcE3UjF2w here]. The rather limited exploration down this avenue is probably a consequence of the historical lack of need in any applications for such an approach.

===Google Groups===
[http://groups.google.com/group/selfreconfigurable Self-Reconfiguring and Modular Technology] is a group for discussion of the perception and understanding of the developing field.robotics.

[https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/modular-robotics Modular Robotics Google Group] is an open public forum dedicated to announcements of events in the field of Modular Robotics. This medium is used to disseminate calls to workshops, special issues and other academic activities of interest to modular robotics researchers. The founders of this Google group intend it to facilitate the exchange of information and ideas within the community of modular robotics researchers around the world and thus promote acceleration of advancements in modular robotics. Anybody who is interested in objectives and progress of Modular Robotics can join this Google group and learn about the new developments in this field.

{{Sex differences}}
'''Sex differences in humans''' have been studied in a variety of fields. In humans, [[biological sex]] is determined by five factors present at birth: the presence or absence of a [[Y chromosome]], the type of [[gonad]]s, the [[Sex steroid|sex hormones]], the internal reproductive anatomy (such as the [[uterus]]), and the [[Human genitalia|external genitalia]].&lt;ref name="KnoxSchacht2011"&gt;Knox, David; Schacht, Caroline. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=iVOXAp27iQkC&amp;pg=PT64 Choices in Relationships: An Introduction to Marriage and the Family]''. 11 ed. Cengage Learning; 2011-10-10 [cited 17 June 2013]. {{ISBN|9781111833220}}. p. 64–66.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Genetic sex]] is determined solely by the presence or absence of a Y chromosome. 

Sex differences generally refer to traits that are [[sexually dimorphic]]. A subset of such differences is hypothesized to be the product of the evolutionary process of [[sexual selection]].&lt;ref name="Mealey, L. 2000"&gt;Mealey, L.  (2000). Sex differences. NY: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geary, D. C. (2009) Male, Female: The Evolution of Human Sex Differences.  Washington, D.C.: American Psychological Association&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medicine==
{{main|Sex differences in medicine}}
Sex differences in medicine include sex-specific diseases, which are [[disease]]s that occur ''only'' in people of one [[sex]]; and sex-related diseases, which are diseases that are more usual to one sex, or which manifest differently in each sex. For example, certain [[autoimmune disease]]s may occur predominantly in one sex, for unknown reasons. 90% of [[primary biliary cirrhosis]] cases are women, whereas [[primary sclerosing cholangitis]] is more common in men. Gender-based medicine, also called "gender medicine", is the field of medicine that studies the biological and physiological differences between the human sexes and how that affects differences in disease. Traditionally, medical research has mostly been conducted using the male body as the basis for clinical studies. Similar findings are also reported in the sport medicine literature where males typically account for &gt;60% of the individuals studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Where are all the female participants in Sports and Exercise Medicine research?|journal = European Journal of Sport Science|date = 2014-01-01|issn = 1536-7290|pmid = 24766579|pages = 847–851|volume = 14|issue = 8|doi = 10.1080/17461391.2014.911354|first = Joseph T.|last = Costello|first2 = Francois|last2 = Bieuzen|first3 = Chris M.|last3 = Bleakley}}&lt;/ref&gt; The findings of these studies have often been applied across the sexes and healthcare providers have assumed a uniform approach in treating both male and female patients. More recently, medical research has started to understand the importance of taking the sex into account as the symptoms and responses to medical treatment may be very different between sexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.columbia-stmarys.org/19301.cfm |title=Women, Men, and Medicine: We're Not Equal |author1=Cuozzo, Karen |author2=Bratman, Steven (reviewer) |publisher=EBSCO Publishing |date=September 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060710061518/http://www.columbia-stmarys.org/19301.cfm |archivedate=July 10, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither concept should be confused with [[sexually transmitted disease]]s, which are diseases that have a significant probability of transmission through sexual contact.

Sex-related illnesses have various causes:{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}
* [[Sex-linked]] genetic illnesses
* Parts of the [[reproductive system]] that are specific to one sex
* Social causes that relate to the [[gender role]] expected of that sex in a particular society.
* Different levels of prevention, reporting, diagnosis or treatment in each gender.

==Physiology==
{{main|Sex differences in human physiology}}
Sex differences in human physiology are distinctions of physiological characteristics associated with either male or female humans. These can be of several types, including direct and indirect. Direct being the direct result of differences prescribed by the Y-chromosome, and indirect being a characteristic influenced indirectly (e.g., hormonally) by the Y-chromosome. [[Sexual dimorphism]] is a term for the [[phenotype|phenotypic]] difference between males and females of the same species.

Direct sex differences follow a [[bimodal distribution]]. Through the process of [[meiosis]] and [[fertilization]] (with rare exceptions), each individual is created with zero or one Y-chromosome. The complementary result for the X-chromosome follows, either a double or a single X. Therefore, direct sex differences are usually binary in expression (although the deviations in complex biological processes produce a menagerie of exceptions). These include, most conspicuously, male (vs female) [[gonads]].

Indirect sex differences are general differences as quantified by [[empirical data]] and [[statistics|statistical]] analysis. Most differing characteristics will conform to a [[bell distribution|bell-curve]] (i.e., normal) distribution which can be broadly described by the mean (peak distribution) and standard deviation (indicator of size of range). Often only the mean or mean difference between sexes is given. This may or may not preclude overlap in distributions. For example, most [[males]] are taller and stronger than [[females]],&lt;ref name="Gustafsson"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gustafsson A, Lindenfors P|lastauthoramp=yes | year=2004 | title=Human size evolution: no allometric relationship between male and female stature | journal=Journal of Human Evolution | volume=47 | pages=253–266 | doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2004.07.004 | pmid=15454336 | issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; but an individual female could be taller and stronger than an individual male. The extents of these differences vary across societies.&lt;ref name="Birke, Lydia 2001"&gt;Birke, Lydia. The Gender and Science Reader ed. Muriel Lederman and Ingrid Bartsch. New York, Routledge, 2001. 306-322&lt;/ref&gt;

The most obvious differences between males and females include all the features related to reproductive role, notably the endocrine (hormonal) systems and their physiological and behavioral effects, including gonadal differentiation, internal and external genital and breast differentiation, and differentiation of muscle mass, height, and hair distribution. There are also differences in the structure of specific areas of the [[Human brain|brain]]. For example, on average, the [[Sexually dimorphic nucleus|SDN]] ([[INAH 3|INAH3]] in humans) has been repeatedly found to be considerably larger in males than in females.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Savic|first=Ivanka|last2=Garcia-Falgueras|first2=Alicia|last3=Swaab|first3=Dick F.|date=2010-01-01|title=Sexual differentiation of the human brain in relation to gender identity and sexual orientation|journal=Progress in Brain Research|volume=186|pages=41–62|doi=10.1016/B978-0-444-53630-3.00004-X|issn=1875-7855|pmid=21094885|series=Progress in Brain Research|isbn=9780444536303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==
{{main|Sex differences in human psychology}}
Research on biological sex differences in human psychology investigates cognitive and behavioral differences between [[men]] and [[women]]. This research employs experimental tests of [[cognition]], which take a variety of forms. Tests focus on possible differences in areas such as [[IQ]], spatial reasoning, [[aggression]], [[emotion]], and brain structure and function.

Chromosomal make up is important in human psychology. Women have two X chromosomes while males have an X and Y chromosomal structure. The X chromosome is much more active than Y and it affects behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Heredity Theory Says Intelligence in Males is 'Like Mother, Like Son'|last = Tanoyouye|first = Elyse|journal = Wall Street Journal|date =June 28, 1996|pmid = |page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic researchers theorize that the X chromosome may contain a gene responsible for sociability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB866070665214215000 |title = Hey guys, for your next party, try borrowing women's genes|last = Langreth|first = Robert|date = 1997|journal = Wall Street Journal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=June 2018}}

Most IQ tests are constructed so that there are no overall score differences between females and males. Areas where differences have been found include verbal and mathematical ability.&lt;ref name="lrainc.com"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.51.2.77| year = 1996| last1 = Neisser | first1 = U.| last2 = Boodoo | first2 = G.| last3 = Bouchard | first3 = T.

Because social and environmental factors affect brain activity and behavior, where differences are found, it can be difficult for researchers to assess whether or not the differences are [[innate]]. Studies on this topic explore the possibility of social influences on how both sexes perform in cognitive and behavioral tests. [[Stereotype]]s about differences between men and women have been shown to affect a person's behavior (this is called [[stereotype threat]]).&lt;ref name="Fine"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fine|first=Cordelia|authorlink=Cordelia Fine|title = [[Delusions of Gender|Delusions of Gender: How Our Minds, Society, and Neurosexism Create Difference]]| publisher =W.

In his book titled ''Gender, Nature, and Nurture'', psychologist Richard Lippa found that there were large differences in women's and men's preferences for realistic occupations (for example, mechanic or carpenters) and moderate differences in their preferences for social and artistic occupations. His results also found that women tend to be more people-oriented and men more thing-oriented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lippa|first=Richard A.|title=Gender, nature, and nurture|year=2005|publisher=Erlbaum|location=Mahwah, NJ [u.a.]|isbn=0-8058-5344-8|pages=12–44|edition=2.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hartung &amp; Widiger (1998) found that many kinds of mental illnesses and behavioral problems show gender differences in prevalence and incidence. "Of the 80 disorders diagnosed in adulthood for which sex ratios are provided, 35 are said to be more common in men than in women (17 of which are substance related or a [[paraphilia]]), 31 are said to be more common in women than men, and 14 are said to be equally common in both sexes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hartung|first=CM|author2=Widiger, TA |title=Gender differences in the diagnosis of mental disorders: conclusions and controversies of the DSM-IV.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=May 1998|volume=123|issue=3|pages=260–78|pmid=9602559|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.123.3.260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Differences in male and female jealousy can also be observed. While female jealousy is more likely to be inspired by emotional infidelity, male jealousy is most likely to be brought on by sexual infidelity. A clear majority of approximately 62% to 86% of women reported that they would be more bothered by emotional infidelity and 47% to 60% of men reported that they would be more bothered by sexual infidelity.&lt;ref name="Pietrzak 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pietrzak, Laird, Stevens, Thompson|first=Robert, James, David, Nicholas|title=Sex differences in human jealousy: A coordinated study of forced-choice, continuous rating-scale, and physiological responses on the same subjects|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|date=March 2002|pages=83–94|url=http://resolver.scholarsportal.info/resolve/10905138/v23i0002/83_sdihj|accessdate=21 March 2013|doi=10.1016/s1090-5138(01)00078-2|volume=23|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, [[Janet Shibley Hyde]] from the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]] introduced the gender similarities hypothesis, which suggests that males and females are similar on most, but not all, psychological variables. The research focused on cognitive variables (for example, reading comprehension, mathematics), communication (for example, talkativeness, facial expressions), social and personality (for example, aggression, sexuality), psychological well-being, and motor behaviors. Using results from a review of 46 meta-analyses, she found that 78% of gender differences were small or close to zero. A few exceptions were some motor behaviors (such as throwing distance) and some aspects of sexuality (such as attitudes about casual sex), which show the largest gender differences. She concludes her article by stating: "It is time to consider the costs of overinflated claims of gender differences. Arguably, they cause harm in numerous realms, including women’s opportunities in the workplace, couple conflict and communication, and analyses of self-esteem problems among adolescents."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hyde|first=Janet Shibley|title=The Gender Similarities Hypothesis|journal=American Psychologist|date=September 2005|volume=60|issue=6|pages=581–592|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.60.6.581|pmid=16173891}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyde also stated elsewhere that "variations ''within'' genders are greater than variations ''between'' genders."&lt;ref name=tugend&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tugend|first1=Alina|title=Engendering Sons|journal=[[California (magazine)|California]]|url=http://alumni.berkeley.edu/california-magazine/winter-2014-gender-assumptions|issue=Winter 2014|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 Irina Trofimova&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trofimova|first=Irina|title=A study of the dynamics of sex differences in adulthood. |journal=[[International Journal of Psychology]] |date= 2012|volume=47|issue=|pages=47, 1–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported “middle age – middle sex” phenomenon and suggested that the significant female advantage in verbal fluency and male advantage in physical power fade after age 25 in an asymmetric manner. She pointed out to several other studies on humans and other primates showing a levelling of sex differences in sociability and physical strength. Males and females might indeed have different timings of maturation of physical and verbal systems: according to McGuinness and Pribram (1978) during the first two years of life talking and walking rarely occur simultaneously, which suggests that these two abilities compete for the same set of neural connections, or that one type of neural organization inhibits the other. This coincides with the higher mobility of boys, accompanied by their lower rates of speech development in childhood, in comparison to girls. These different timings in maturation appear as sex differences in early age, and likely level off in later adulthood (Barbu, Cabanes, &amp; Le Maner-Idrissi, 2011). This middle age – middle sex phenomenon might explain why meta-analytic reports and several experimental studies of verbal abilities and dominance using adult participants reported no sex differences.

===Crime===
{{main|Sex differences in crime}}

Statistics have been consistent in reporting that men commit more criminal acts than women.&lt;ref name="Carrabine"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Eamonn Carrabine, Paul Iganski, Maggy Lee|title=Criminology: A Sociological Introduction|publisher=[[Psychology Press]]|isbn=0415281679|year=2004|page=88|accessdate=August 7, 2016|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CJm4AIc4sZEC&amp;pg=PA88|quote=Statistics repeatedly show that many more men than women commit crimes.

Some differing explanations include men's [[evolutionary]] tendency toward risk and violent behavior, sex differences in activity, [[social support]], and [[gender inequality]].

Despite the difficulty of interpreting them, [[crime statistics]] may provide a way to investigate such a relationship from a [[gender differences]] perspective. An observable difference in crime rates between men and women might be due to social and cultural factors, crimes going unreported, or to biological factors (for example, [[testosterone]] or sociobiological theories). Taking the nature of the crime itself into consideration may also be a factor. Crime can be measured by such data as arrest records, imprisonment rates, and surveys. However, not all crimes are reported or investigated. Moreover, some studies show that men can have an overwhelming bias against reporting themselves to be the victims of a crime (particularly when victimized by a woman), and some studies have argued that men reporting [[intimate partner violence]] find disadvantageous biases in law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;"[M]en who are involved in disputes with their partners, whether as alleged victims or as alleged offenders or both, are disadvantaged and treated less favorably than women by the law-enforcement system at almost every step."

===Education===
{{main|Sex differences in education}}
[[File:Map3.7Education Discrepancy compressed.jpg|right|thumb| 400px| A world map showing countries by gender education disparity, 2010.]]
Sometimes and in some places, there are sex differences in educational achievement. This may be caused by [[sexism|sex discrimination]] in law or culture, or may reflect natural differences in the interests of the sexes.&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, Jennifer. "Gender, Education and." Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology. Ritzer, George (ed). Blackwell Publishing, 2007. Blackwell Reference Online. 31 March 2008 &lt;http://www.blackwellreference.com/subscriber/tocnode?id=g9781405124331_chunk_g978140512433113_ss1-16&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leadership===
{{main|Sex differences in leadership}}
Research has been undertaken to examine whether or not there are sex differences in leadership. Until recently, leadership positions have predominantly been held by men. Women were rarely seen in senior [[leadership]] positions leading to a lack of data on how they behave in such positions.&lt;ref name="Ascited"&gt;as cited in {{cite journal | last1 = Andersen | first1 = J. A. | last2 = Hansson | first2 = P. H. | year = 2011 | title = At the end of the road? On differences between women and men in leadership behavior | url = | journal = Leadership and Organization Development Journal | volume = 32 | issue = 5| pages = 428–441 | doi=10.1108/01437731111146550}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two main lines of research contradict one another, the first being that there are significant sex differences in leadership and the second being that gender does not have an effect on leadership.

Women and men have been surveyed by Gallup each year concerning workplace topics, and when questioned about preferences of a female boss or a male boss, women chose a preference for a male boss 39% of the time, compared to 26% of men displaying preference for a male boss.  Only 27% of females would prefer a boss of the same gender.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-10-16/women-dislike-having-female-bosses-more-than-men-do Women Prefer Male Bosses Even More Than Men Do] Bloomberg, October 16, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  This preference, among both sexes, for male leadership in the workplace has continued unabated for sixty years, according to the survey results.

===Religion===
{{main|Sex differences in religion}}
Sex differences in religion can be classified as either "internal" or "external." Internal religious issues are studied from the perspective of a given religion, and might include religious beliefs and practices about the roles and rights of men and women in government, education and worship; beliefs about the sex or gender of deities and religious figures; and beliefs about the origin and meaning of human gender. External religious issues can be broadly defined as an examination of a given religion from an outsider's perspective, including possible clashes between religious leaders and laity;&lt;ref&gt;Juschka, Darlene. "Gender." In ed. J. Hinnels. The Routledge Companion to the Study of Religion. 2nd ed.  New York: Routledge, 2010:245-258.&lt;/ref&gt; and the influence of, and differences between, religious perspectives on social issues. For example, various religious perspectives have either endorsed or condemned alternative family structures, homosexual relationships, and abortion.&lt;ref&gt;

===Social capital===
{{main|Sex differences in social capital}}
Sex differences in social capital are differences between men and women in their ability to coordinate actions and achieve their aims through trust, norms and networks.&lt;ref name=laurie&gt;Laurie, Nina; Andolina, Robert; and Radcliffe, Sarah (2005) 'Ethnodevelopment: Social Movements, Creating Experts and Professionalising Indigenous Knowledge in Ecuador' Antipode 37(3): 470-496&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social capital]] is often seen as the missing link in development; as social networks facilitate access to resources and protect the commons, while cooperation makes markets work more efficiently.&lt;ref name="putnam"&gt;Putnam, Robert. (1993) Making Democracy Work. Civic Traditions in Modern Italy. Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Social capital has been thought of as women's capital as whereas there are gendered barriers to accessing economic capital, women's role in family, and community ensures that they have strong networks. There is potential that the concept can help to bring women's unpaid 'community and household labor',&lt;ref name=moser&gt;Moser, Caroline (1993) Gender Planning and Development: Theory, Practice and Training London and New York: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; vital to survival and development, to the attention of economists. However, research analyzing social capital from a gendered perspective is rare, and the notable exceptions are very critical.&lt;ref name=molyneux&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-7660.2010.01649.x/abstract |title=Molyneux, Maxine (2002) Gender and the Silences of Social Capital: Lessons from Latin America Development and Change 33 (2):167-188 |journal=Development and Change |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=495 |publisher=Onlinelibrary.wiley.com |date=2010-06-25 |accessdate=2014-01-15|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7660.2010.01649.x |last1=MacLean |first1=Kate }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=maclean&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-7660.2010.01649.x/abstract |title=Maclean, Kate (2010) 'Capitalising on Women's Social Capital?

===Suicide===
{{main|Sex differences in suicide}}
Sex differences in suicide have been shown to be significant; there are highly asymmetric rates of attempted and completed suicide between males and females.&lt;ref name=udry&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2061790 |first1=J.

===Financial risk-taking===

Sex differences in financial decision making are relevant and significant. Numerous studies have found that women tend to be financially more risk-averse than men and hold safer [[Portfolio (finance)|portfolios]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bajtelsmit| first1 = Vickie L | last2 = Bernasek| first2 = Alexandra| year = 1996| title = Why Do Women Invest Differently Than Men?| journal = Journal of Financial Counseling and Planning | volume = 7| pages = 1–10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Adhikari| first1 = Binay K | last2 = O'Leary| first2 = Virginia E | year = 2011| title = Gender Differences in Risk Aversion: A Developing Nation’s Case| url = https://www.dropbox.com/s/ehk7iwzukwu0kw4/Gender%20Differences%20Risk%20Aversion%20-%20Nepal.pdf?dl=0  | journal = Journal of Personal Finance | volume = 10|issue = 2| pages = 122–147}}&lt;/ref&gt; A May 3, 2015 article in the Wall Street Journal by Georgette Jasen reported that "when it comes to investing, men sometimes have their way of doing things, and women have different ways."&lt;ref&gt;Georgette Jasen, May 3, 2015, WSJ online.  https://www.wsj.com/articles/male-investors-vs-female-investors-how-do-they-compare-1430709406&lt;/ref&gt; Scholarly research has documented systematic differences in financial decisions such as buying investments versus insurance, donating to ingroups versus outgroups (such as terrorism victims in Iraq versus USA), spending in stores,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kurt | first1 = Didem | last2 = Inman | first2 = J.

"The duality of human existence: An essay on psychology and religion." (1966).&lt;/ref&gt; according to this theory, due to factors such as socialization, males are typically more agentic (focus on self, upside potential, aggressiveness) and females typically more communal (focus on others, downside potential, and nurturing). This framework robustly explains many financial decision making outcomes.

The '''small penis rule''' is an informal strategy used by authors to evade [[libel]] lawsuits. It was described in a ''[[New York Times]]'' article in 1998:

{{quote|"For a fictional portrait to be actionable, it must be so accurate that a reader of the book would have no problem linking the two," said Mr. Friedman. Thus, he continued, libel lawyers have what is known as "the small penis rule". One way authors can protect themselves from libel suits is to say that a character has a small penis, Mr. Friedman said. "Now no male is going to come forward and say, 'That character with a very small penis, that's me!{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F01E7DD1F3DF937A15753C1A96E958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2 | title=Writers as Plunderers; Why Do They Keep Giving Away Other People's Secrets? | author=Dinitia Smith | work=The New York Times | date=24 October 1998 | accessdate=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Human penis size|small penis]] rule was referenced in a 2006 dispute between [[Michael Crowley (journalist)|Michael Crowley]] and [[Michael Crichton]]. Crowley alleged that after he wrote an unflattering review of Crichton's novel ''[[State of Fear]]'', Crichton included a character named "Mick Crowley" in the novel ''[[Next (novel)|Next]]''. The character is a [[Child sexual abuse|child rapist]], described as being a [[Washington, D.C.]]-based journalist and [[Yale University|Yale]] graduate with a small penis.&lt;ref name="next"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/14/books/14cric.html | title=Columnist Accuses Crichton of ‘Literary Hit-and-Run’ | author=Felicia R.

[[File:Walletssn2.gif|thumb|The promotional United States [[Social Security card]] distributed as an example card in wallets distributed by the [[F.W. Woolworth Company]]]]

'''Social security''' is "any government system that provides monetary assistance to people with an inadequate or no income."&lt;ref name="Bach2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Bach|title=1001 Financial Words You Need to Know|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a5R44srUbsUC&amp;pg=PA185&amp;dq=%22social%20security%22|date=9 October 2003|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=978-0-19-517050-4|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, this is usually called '''welfare''' or a [[social safety net]], especially when talking about Canada and European countries.

Social security is asserted in Article 22 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], which states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Everyone, as a member of society, has the right to social security and is entitled to realization, through national effort and international co-operation and in accordance with the organization and resources of each State, of the [[economic, social and cultural rights]] indispensable for his [[human dignity|dignity]] and the free development of his personality.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In simple terms, the signatories agree that the society in which a person lives should help them to develop and to make the most of all the advantages (culture, work, [[social welfare]]) which are offered to them in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights|url=https://www.un.org/cyberschoolbus/humanrights/resources/plain.asp|work=Plain language version|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=20 April 2012|quote=Art 22. "22 The society in which you live should help you to develop and to make the most of all the advantages (culture, work, social welfare) which are offered to you and to all the men and women in your country."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social security may also refer to the action programs of an organization intended to promote the welfare of the population through assistance measures guaranteeing access to sufficient resources for food and shelter and to promote health and well-being for the population at large and potentially vulnerable segments such as children, the elderly, the sick and the unemployed. Services providing social security are often called '''[[social services]]'''.

Terminology in this area is somewhat different in the [[United States]] from in the rest of the English-speaking world. The general term for an action program in support of the well being of poor people in the United States is ''welfare program'', and the general term for all such programs is simply ''welfare''. In American society, the term ''welfare'' arguably has negative connotations. In the United States, the term ''Social Security'' refers to the [[Social Security (United States)|US social insurance program]] for all retired and disabled people. Elsewhere the term is used in a much broader sense, referring to the economic security society offers when people are faced with certain risks. In its 1952 [[Social Security (Minimum Standards) Convention, 1952|Social Security (Minimum Standards) Convention (nr. 102)]], the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) defined the traditional contingencies covered by social security as including:

*  Survival beyond a prescribed age, to be covered by ''[[old age pension]]s'';
*  The loss of support suffered by a widowed person or child as the result of the death of the breadwinner (''survivor’s benefit'');
*  Responsibility for the maintenance of children (''family benefit'');
*  The treatment of any morbid condition (including pregnancy), whatever its cause (''medical care'');
*  A suspension of earnings due to pregnancy and confinement and their consequences (''maternity benefit'');
*  A suspension of earnings due to an inability to obtain suitable employment for protected persons who are capable of, and available for, work (''[[unemployment benefits]]'');
*  A suspension of earnings due to an incapacity for work resulting from a morbid condition (''sickness leave benefit'');
*  A permanent or persistent inability to engage in any gainful activity (''[[disability benefits]]'');
*  The costs and losses involved in medical care, sickness leave, invalidity and death of the breadwinner due to an occupational accident or disease (''employment injuries'').

People who cannot reach a guaranteed [[minimum wage|social minimum]] for other reasons may be eligible for ''social assistance'' (or [[welfare]], in American English).

Modern authors often consider the ILO approach too narrow. In their view, social security is not limited to the provision of cash transfers, but also aims at security of work, health, and social participation; and new social risks (single parenthood, the reconciliation of work and family life) should be included in the list as well.&lt;ref&gt;See for a more elaborate discussion: {{cite book|author=J.C. Vrooman|title=Rules of Relief; Institutions of Social Security, and Their Impact|url=http://www.transactionpub.com/title/Rules-of-Relief-978-90-377-0218-7.html|year=2009|publisher=[[Transaction Publishers]] (The Netherlands Institute for Social Research)|pages=111–126}} {{ISBN|978-90-377-0218-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social security may refer to:
*  '''[[social insurance]]''', where people receive benefits or services in recognition of contributions to an insurance program. These services typically include provision for retirement [[pensions]], [[disability insurance]], survivor benefits and [[unemployment insurance]].
*  '''services''' provided by government or designated agencies responsible for social security provision. In different countries, that may include medical care, financial support during unemployment, sickness, or retirement, health and safety at work, aspects of social work and even industrial relations.
*  '''basic security''' irrespective of participation in specific insurance programs where eligibility may otherwise be an issue. For instance, assistance given to newly arrived refugees for basic necessities such as [[food]], [[clothing]], [[Home|housing]], [[education]], [[money]], and [[medicine|medical care]].

A report published by the ILO in 2014 estimated that only 27% of the world's population has access to comprehensive social security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/news/WCMS_244748/lang--en/index.htm|title=More than 70 per cent of the world population lacks proper social protection|author=|date=3 June 2014|website=ilo.org|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While several of the provisions to which the concept refers have a long history (especially in poor relief), the notion of "social security" itself is a fairly recent one. The earliest examples of use date from the 19th century. In a speech to mark the independence of [[Venezuela]], [[Simón Bolívar]] (1819) pronounced: "El sistema de gobierno más perfecto es aquel que produce mayor suma de felicidad posible, mayor suma de ''seguridad social'' y mayor suma de estabilidad política"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.correodelorinoco.gob.ve/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/EE_CO523.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130901103013/http://www.correodelorinoco.gob.ve/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/EE_CO523.pdf |archivedate=1 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; (which translates to "The most perfect system of government is that which produces the greatest amount of happiness, the greatest amount of social security and the greatest amount of political stability").

In the [[Roman Empire]], the Emperor [[Trajan]] (reigned A.D. 98–117) distributed gifts of money and free [[grain]] to the poor in the city of Rome, and returned the gifts of gold sent to him upon his accession by cities in Italy and the provinces of the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/602150/Trajan#tab=active~checked%2Citems~checked&amp;title=Trajan%20--%20Britannica%20Online%20Encyclopædia Britannica.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Trajan's program brought acclaim from many, including [[Pliny the Younger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/empires/romans/empire/nerva_trajan.html|title=The Roman Empire: in the First Century.

In Jewish tradition, charity (represented by [[tzedakah]]) is a matter of religious obligation rather than benevolence. Contemporary charity is regarded as a continuation of the [[Bible|Biblical]] [[Maaser Ani]], or poor-[[tithe]], as well as Biblical practices, such as permitting the poor to glean the corners of a field and harvest during the [[Shmita]] (Sabbatical year). Voluntary charity, along with [[prayer]] and [[repentance]], is befriended to ameliorate the consequences of bad acts.

The Song dynasty (c.1000 AD) government supported multiple forms of social assistance programs, including the establishment of retirement homes, public clinics, and pauper's graveyards.&lt;ref&gt;[[Song dynasty]]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to economist [[Robert Nelson (economist)|Robert Henry Nelson]], "The [[medieval]] [[Roman Catholic Church]] operated a far-reaching and comprehensive welfare system for the poor..."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Henry Nelson (2001). "''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Rw-bHEGNqqcC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Economics as religion: from Samuelson to Chicago and beyond]''".

The concepts of welfare and [[pension]] were put into practice in the early [[Sharia|Islamic law]]&lt;ref name=Crone/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=August 2010}} of the [[Caliphate]] as forms of ''[[Zakat]]'' (charity), one of the [[Five Pillars of Islam]], since the time of the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun caliph]] [[Umar]] in the 7th century. The [[tax]]es (including ''Zakat'' and ''[[Jizya]]'') collected in the [[treasury]] of an Islamic government were used to provide [[income]] for the needy, including the [[Poverty|poor]], [[Old age|elderly]], [[orphan]]s, [[widow]]ed persons, and the disabled. According to the Islamic jurist [[Al-Ghazali]] (Algazel, 1058–1111), the government was also expected to store up food supplies in every region in case a [[disaster]] or [[famine]] occurred.&lt;ref name=Crone&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6u13vgHhSdgC&amp;pg=PA308&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=''Medieval Islamic Political Thought''|first=Patricia|last=Crone|publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]]|year=2005|isbn=0-7486-2194-6|pages=308–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hamid&gt;{{Cite journal|title=An Islamic Alternative?

There is relatively little [[statistic]]al data on [[transfer payment]]s before the [[High Middle Ages]]. In the [[medieval]] period and until the [[Industrial Revolution]], the function of welfare payments in [[Europe]] was principally achieved through private giving or [[Charity (practice)|charity]]. In those early times, there was a much broader group considered to be in poverty as compared to the 21st century.

Early welfare programs in Europe included the [[England|English]] [[Poor Law]] of 1601, which gave [[parish]]es the responsibility for providing poverty relief assistance to the poor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/boyer.poor.laws.england The Poor Laws of England] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105105148/http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/boyer.poor.laws.england |date=5 January 2010 }} at EH.Net&lt;/ref&gt; This system was substantially modified by the 19th-century [[Poor Law Amendment Act]], which introduced the system of [[workhouse]]s.

It was predominantly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that an organized system of state welfare provision was introduced in many countries. [[Otto von Bismarck]], [[Chancellor of the German Empire|Chancellor]] of Germany, introduced one of the first welfare systems for the [[working class]]es in 1883. In [[Great Britain]] the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] government of [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] and [[David Lloyd George]] introduced the [[National Insurance]] system in 1911,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/history/mwh/britain/liberalreformsrev2.shtml Liberal Reforms] at [[BBC]] Bitesize&lt;/ref&gt; a system later expanded by [[Clement Attlee]]. The United States did not have an organized welfare system until the [[Great Depression]], when emergency relief measures were introduced under [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. Even then, Roosevelt's [[New Deal]] focused predominantly on a program of providing work and stimulating the economy through [[public spending]] on projects, rather than on cash payment.

== Income maintenance ==
{{Main|Unemployment benefits}}
This policy is usually applied through various programs designed to provide a population with income at times when they are unable to care for themselves. Income maintenance is based in a combination of five main types of program:
*  '''Social insurance''', considered above
*  '''Means-tested''' benefits, financial assistance provided for those who are unable to cover basic needs, such as food, clothing and housing, due to [[poverty]] or lack of income because of unemployment, sickness, disability, or caring for children. While assistance is often in the form of financial payments, those eligible for social welfare can usually access health and educational services free of charge. The amount of support is enough to cover basic needs and eligibility is often subject to a comprehensive and complex assessment of an applicant's social and financial situation. See also [[Income Support]].
*  '''Non-contributory''' benefits. Several countries have special schemes, administered with no requirement for contributions and no means test, for people in certain categories of need: for example, veterans of armed forces, people with disabilities and very old people.
*  '''Discretionary''' benefits. Some schemes are based on the discretion of an official, such as a social worker.
*  '''Universal''' or categorical benefits, also known as '''demogrants'''. These are non-contributory benefits given for whole sections of the population without a means test, such as family allowances or the public pension in New Zealand (known as New Zealand Superannuation). See also, [[Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend]].

== Social protection ==
{{main|Social protection}}
Social protection refers to a set of benefits available (or not available) from the state, market, civil society and households, or through a combination of these agencies, to the individual/households to reduce multi-dimensional deprivation. This multi-dimensional deprivation could be affecting less active poor persons (such as the elderly or the disabled) and active [[Poverty|poor]] persons (such as the unemployed).

This broad framework makes this concept more acceptable in developing countries than the concept of social security. Social security is more applicable in the conditions, where large numbers of citizens depend on the formal economy for their livelihood. Through a defined contribution, this social security may be managed.

But, in the context of widespread informal economy, formal social security arrangements are almost absent for the vast majority of the working population. Besides, in developing countries, the state's capacity to reach the vast majority of the poor people may be limited because of its limited infrastructure and resources. In such a context, multiple agencies that could provide for social protection, including health care, is critical for policy consideration.&lt;ref&gt;Mendoza, Roger Lee (1990).  The political economy of population control and retirement security in China, India and the Philippines.  ''Philippine Economic Review'', 31(2): 174–191.&lt;/ref&gt; The framework of social protection is thus holds the state responsible for providing for the poorest populations by regulating non-state agencies.

Collaborative research from the [[Institute of Development Studies]] debating Social Protection from a global perspective, suggests that advocates for social protection fall into two broad categories: "instrumentalists" and "activists". Instrumentalists argue that [[extreme poverty]], [[economic inequality|inequality]], and [[social vulnerability|vulnerability]] is dysfunctional in the achievement of development targets (such as the MDGs). In this view, social protection is about putting in place risk management mechanisms that will compensate for incomplete or missing insurance (and other) markets, until a time that private insurance can play a more prominent role in that society. Activist arguments view the persistence of extreme poverty, inequality, and vulnerability as symptoms of [[social injustice]] and [[Structural Inequality|structural inequality]] and see social protection as a right of citizenship. Targeted welfare is a necessary step between humanitarianism and the ideal of a "[[guaranteed minimum income]]" where entitlement extends beyond cash or food transfers and is based on citizenship, not philanthropy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ntd.co.uk/idsbookshop/details.asp?id=987 'Debating Social Protection'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724102136/http://www.ntd.co.uk/idsbookshop/details.asp?id=987 |date=24 July 2011 }} Devereux, S and Sabates-Wheeler, R.

is a kind of order in  [[absolute zero|zero-temperature]]  quantum-mechanical states of matter that have  a symmetry and a finite energy gap.

To derive the results in a most-invariant way,  [[renormalization group|renormalization group methods]] are used (leading to equivalence classes corresponding to certain fixed points).&lt;ref name=defspt /&gt; The SPT order  has the following defining properties:

(a) ''distinct SPT states with a given symmetry cannot be smoothly deformed into each other without a phase transition, if the deformation preserves the symmetry''. &lt;br&gt;
(b) ''however, they all can be smoothly deformed into the same trivial product state without a phase transition, if the symmetry is broken during the deformation''.

The above definition works for both bosonic systems and fermionic systems, which leads to the notions of bosonic SPT order and fermionic SPT order.

Using the notion of [[quantum entanglement]], we can say that SPT states
are [[short-range entanglement|short-range entangled]] states ''with a symmetry'' (by contrast: for long-range entanglement see [[topological order]], which is not related to the famous [[EPR paradox]]).
Since short-range entangled states have only trivial [[topological order]]s 
we may also refer the SPT order as Symmetry Protected "Trivial" order.

==Characteristic properties of SPT order==

# The boundary effective theory of a non-trivial SPT state always has pure [[Anomaly matching condition|gauge anomaly]] or mixed gauge-gravity anomaly for the symmetry group.&lt;ref&gt;
Xiao-Gang Wen,
''Classifying gauge anomalies through SPT orders and classifying gravitational anomalies through topological orders''
Phys. Rev. D 88, 045013 (2013); arXiv:1303.1803.
&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the boundary of a SPT state is either gapless or degenerate, regardless how we cut the sample to form the boundary. A gapped non-degenerate boundary is impossible for a non-trivial SPT state.  If the boundary is a gapped degenerate state, the degeneracy may be caused by  spontaneous symmetry breaking and/or (intrinsic) topological order.

&lt;/ref&gt; of the symmetry group. Monodromy defects are created by twisting the boundary condition along a cut by a symmetry transformation. The ends of such cut are the monodromy defects. For example, 2+1D bosonic Z&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; SPT states are classified by a Z&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; integer ''m''. One can show that ''n'' identical elementary monodromy defects in a Z&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; SPT state labeled by ''m'' will carry a total Z&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; quantum number ''2m'' which is not a multiple of ''n''.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation between SPT order and (intrinsic) topological order==
SPT states are short-range entangled while topologically ordered states are long-range entangled.
Both intrinsic [[topological order]], and also SPT order, can sometimes have protected [[gapless boundary excitation]]s. The difference is subtle: the gapless boundary excitations in intrinsic [[topological order]] can be robust against any local perturbations, while the gapless boundary excitations in SPT order are robust only against local perturbations ''that do not break the symmetry''. So the gapless boundary excitations in intrinsic [[topological order]] are topologically protected, while the gapless boundary excitations in SPT order are ''symmetry protected''.&lt;ref&gt;One should also note the semantical subtleness of the name SPT: "symmetry protected"  does not mean that the stability of the state is  conserved "because of the symmetry", but it is  just meant that the symmetry is ''kept'' by the interactions corresponding to the process.&lt;/ref&gt;

We also know that an intrinsic [[topological order]] has emergent [[fractional charge]], emergent [[fractional statistics]], and emergent [[gauge theory]]. In contrast, a SPT order has no emergent [[fractional charge]]/[[fractional statistics]] for finite-energy excitations, nor emergent [[gauge theory]] (due to its short-range entanglement). Note that the monodromy defects discussed above are not finite-energy excitations in the spectrum of the Hamiltonian, but defects created by '''modifying''' the Hamiltonian.

==Examples of SPT order==

The first example of SPT order is the [[AKLT|Haldane phase]] of odd-integer-spin chain.&lt;ref&gt;
F. D. M. Haldane, Phys. Rev. Lett. 50, 1153 (1983), Phys.
Lett. 3,464 (1983); I. Affleck and F. D. M. Haldane, Pyhs.
Rev. B 36, 5291 (1987); I. Affleck, J. Phys.: Condens.
Matter. 1, 3047 (1989).
&lt;/ref&gt; It is a SPT phase protected by [[SO(3)]] spin rotation symmetry.&lt;ref name=defspt/&gt; 
(Note that Haldane phases of even-integer-spin chain do not have SPT order.)
A more well known example of SPT order is the [[topological insulator]] of non-interacting fermions, a SPT phase protected by [[U(1)]] and [[time reversal symmetry]].

On the other hand, fractional [[quantum Hall effect|quantum Hall]] states are not SPT states. They are states with (intrinsic) topological order and long-range entanglements.

==Group cohomology theory for SPT phases==

Using the notion of [[quantum entanglement]], one obtains the following general picture of gapped
phases at zero temperature. All gapped zero-temperature phases can be divided into two classes: [[long-range entanglement|long-range entangled]] phases (''ie'' phases with intrinsic [[topological order]]) and [[short-range entanglement|short-range entangled]] phases (''ie'' phases with no intrinsic [[topological order]]). All short-range entangled phases can be further divided into three classes:  [[Spontaneous symmetry breaking|symmetry-breaking]] phases, SPT phases, and their mix (symmetry breaking order and SPT order can appear together).

It is well known that [[Spontaneous symmetry breaking|symmetry-breaking]] orders are described by [[group theory]]. For bosonic SPT phases with pure gauge anomalous boundary, it was shown that they are classified by [[group cohomology]] theory:&lt;ref name=spt&gt;

From the above results, many new quantum states of matter are predicted, including bosonic topological insulators (the SPT states protected  U(1) and time-reversal symmetry) and  bosonic topological superconductors (the SPT states protected by time-reversal symmetry), as well as many other new SPT states protected by other symmetries.

The phases before "+" come from &lt;math&gt;H^{d+1} [G, U(1)]&lt;/math&gt;. The phases after "+" come from &lt;math&gt;\oplus_{k=1}^d H^k[G,iTO^{d+1-k}]&lt;/math&gt;.
Just like group theory can give us 230 crystal structures in 3+1D, [[group cohomology]] theory can give us various SPT phases in any dimensions with any on-site symmetry groups.

On the other hand, the fermionic SPT orders are described by [[group super-cohomology]] theory.&lt;ref&gt;
Zheng-Cheng Gu, [[Xiao-Gang Wen]],
[https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.2648 Symmetry-protected topological orders for interacting fermions – fermionic topological non-linear sigma-models and a group super-cohomology theory ]
&lt;/ref&gt; So the group (super-)cohomology theory allows us to construct many
SPT orders even for interacting systems, which include  interacting topological insulator/superconductor.

==A complete classification of 1D gapped quantum phases (with interactions)==

Using the notions of [[quantum entanglement]] and SPT order, one can obtain
a complete classification of all 1D gapped quantum phases.

First, it is shown that there is no (intrinsic) [[topological order]] in 1D (''ie'' all 1D gapped states
are short-range entangled).&lt;ref&gt;
F. Verstraete, J. I. Cirac, J. I. Latorre, E. Rico, and M. M.
Wolf, Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 140601 (2005).
&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus, if the Hamiltonians have no symmetry, all their 1D gapped quantum states belong to one phase—the phase of trivial product states.
On the other hand, if the Hamiltonians do have a symmetry,  their 1D gapped quantum states 
are either [[Spontaneous symmetry breaking|symmetry-breaking]] phases, SPT phases, and their mix.

Such an understanding allows one to classify all 1D gapped quantum phases:&lt;ref name=spt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Xie Chen, Zheng-Cheng Gu, Xiao-Gang Wen, [https://arxiv.org/abs/1008.3745  Classification of Gapped Symmetric Phases in 1D Spin Systems],

84, 165139, (2011), [https://arxiv.org/abs/1010.3732 arXiv:1010.3732].
&lt;/ref&gt; All 1D gapped phases are classified by
the following three mathematical objects: &lt;math&gt;(G_H, G_\Psi, H^{2} [G_\Psi , U(1)])&lt;/math&gt; , where &lt;math&gt;G_H&lt;/math&gt; is the symmetry group of the Hamiltonian, &lt;math&gt;G_\Psi&lt;/math&gt; the symmetry group of the ground states, and &lt;math&gt;H^{2} [G_\Psi, U(1)]&lt;/math&gt; the second [[group cohomology]] class of &lt;math&gt;G_\Psi&lt;/math&gt;. (Note that &lt;math&gt;H^{2} [G, U(1)]&lt;/math&gt; classifies the projective representations of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.) If there is no symmetry breaking (''ie'' &lt;math&gt;G_\Psi=G_H&lt;/math&gt;), the 1D gapped phases are classified by the projective representations of symmetry group &lt;math&gt;G_H&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1444">In mathematics, Weinstein's '''symplectic category''' is (roughly) a [[category (mathematics)|category]] whose objects are [[symplectic manifold]]s and whose morphisms are '''canonical relations''', inclusions of [[Lagrangian submanifold]]s ''L'' into &lt;math&gt;M \times N^{-}&lt;/math&gt;, where the superscript minus means minus the given symplectic form (for example, the graph of a [[symplectomorphism]]; hence, minus). The notion was introduced by [[Alan Weinstein]], according to whom "Quantization problems&lt;ref&gt;He means [[geometric quantization]].&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that the category of symplectic manifolds and symplectomorphisms be augmented by the inclusion of canonical relations as morphisms." The composition of canonical relations is given by a [[fiber product]].

Strictly speaking, the symplectic category is not a well-defined category (since the composition may not be well-defined) without some transversality conditions.

'''''The Phenomenon of Man''''' (''Le phénomène humain'') is a 1955 book written by the [[French people|French]] [[philosopher]], [[paleontologist]] and [[Jesuit]] priest [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]]. In this work, Teilhard describes [[evolution]] as a process that leads to increasing complexity, culminating in the unification of [[consciousness]].

The book was finished in the 1930s, but was published [[List of works published posthumously|posthumously]] in 1955, and translated into English in 1959. The [[Roman Catholic Church]] initially prohibited the publication of some of Teilhard's writings on the grounds that they contradicted [[orthodoxy]].

The foreword to the book was written by one of the key advocates for [[natural selection]] and evolution of the 20th century, and a co-developer of the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] in biology, [[Julian Huxley]].

== Summary ==
Teilhard views [[evolution]] as a process that leads to increasing complexity. From the [[Cell (biology)|cell]] to the thinking animal, a process of psychical concentration leads to greater [[consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Phenomenon of Man'', Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, 1961, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' marks the beginning of a new age, as the power acquired by consciousness to turn in upon itself raises mankind to a new sphere.&lt;ref&gt;''The Phenomenon of Man'', Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, 1961, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; Borrowing Huxley’s expression, Teilhard describes humankind as evolution becoming conscious of itself.&lt;ref&gt;''The Phenomenon of Man'', Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, 1961, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
In Teilhard's conception of the evolution of the species, a collective identity begins to develop as trade and the transmission of ideas increases.&lt;ref&gt;''The Phenomenon of Man'', Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, 1961, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;  Knowledge accumulates and is transmitted in increasing levels of depth and complexity.&lt;ref&gt;''The Phenomenon of Man'', Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, 1961, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to a further augmentation of consciousness and the emergence of a thinking layer that envelops the earth.&lt;ref name="Man, Harper Torchbooks 1961, p. 244"&gt;''The Phenomenon of Man'', Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, 1961, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; Teilhard calls the new membrane the “[[noosphere]]” (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] “''nous''”, meaning mind), a term first coined by [[Vladimir Vernadsky]]. The noosphere is the [[collective consciousness]] of humanity, the networks of thought and emotion in which all are immersed.&lt;ref&gt;''The Phenomenon of Man'', Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, 1961, p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt;   
 
The development of [[science]] and [[technology]] causes an expansion of the human sphere of influence, allowing a person to be simultaneously present in every corner of the world. Teilhard argues that humanity has thus become cosmopolitan, stretching a single organized membrane over the [[Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Phenomenon of Man'', Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, 1961, p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; Teilhard describes the process by which this happens as a "gigantic psychobiological operation, a sort of mega-synthesis, the “super-arrangement” to which all the thinking elements of the earth find themselves today individually and collectively subject".&lt;ref name="Man, Harper Torchbooks 1961, p. 244"/&gt; The rapid expansion of the noosphere requires a new domain of psychical expansion, which "is staring us in the face if we would only raise our heads to look at it".&lt;ref&gt;''The Phenomenon of Man'', Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, 1961, p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Teilhard’s view, evolution will culminate in the [[Omega Point]], a sort of supreme consciousness. Layers of consciousness will converge in Omega, fusing and consuming them in itself.&lt;ref&gt;''The Phenomenon of Man'', Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, 1961, p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt; The concentration of a conscious universe will reassemble in itself all consciousnesses as well as all that we are conscious of.&lt;ref&gt;''The Phenomenon of Man'', Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, 1961, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt; Teilhard emphasizes that each individual facet of consciousness will remain conscious of itself at the end of the process.&lt;ref&gt;''The Phenomenon of Man'', Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, 1961, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
{{expand section|date=July 2010}}
In 1961, the Nobel Prize-winner [[Peter Medawar]], a British immunologist, wrote a scornful review of the book for the journal ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= P.B. Medawar|year= 1961 |title= Critical Notice |journal= [[Mind (journal)|Mind]]| publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |volume=LXX |issue= |pages=99–106 |url= http://bactra.org/Medawar/phenomenon-of-man.html |doi= 10.1093/mind/LXX.277.99 |pmid= |pmc= |authorlink= Peter Medawar }}&lt;/ref&gt; calling it "a bag of tricks" and saying that the author had shown "an active willingness to be deceived": "the greater part of it, I shall show, is nonsense, tricked out with a variety of metaphysical conceits, and its author can be excused of dishonesty only on the grounds that before deceiving others he has taken great pains to deceive himself".

The evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] called Medawar's review "devastating", and ''The Phenomenon of Man'' "the quintessence of bad poetic science".&lt;ref name="Dawkins2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Dawkins|title=Unweaving the Rainbow: Science, Delusion and the Appetite for Wonder|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZudTchiioUoC&amp;pg=PA320|date=5 April 2000|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=0-547-34735-9|pages=320–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the June 1995 issue of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', Jennifer Cobb Kreisberg said, "Teilhard saw the Net coming more than half a century before it arrived":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=A Globe, Clothing Itself With a Brain | publisher= [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | date=June 1995 | url= https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.06/teilhard_pr.html | author=Jennifer Cobb Kreisberg | accessdate=2010-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Teilhard imagined a stage of evolution characterized by a complex membrane of information enveloping the globe and fueled by human consciousness. It sounds a little off-the-wall, until you think about the Net, that vast electronic web encircling the Earth, running point to point through a nerve-like constellation of wires.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In July 2009, during a [[vespers]] service in [[Aosta Cathedral]] in northern Italy, [[Pope Benedict XVI]], reflecting on the [[Epistle to the Romans]] in which "St. Paul writes that the world itself will one day become a form of living worship", commented on Teilhard:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ncronline.org/print/14207 | title=Pope cites Teilhardian vision of the cosmos as a 'living host' | date=28 July 2009| author=John L. Allen Jr. | publisher= |work=[[National Catholic Reporter]]| accessdate=24 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It's the great vision that later Teilhard de Chardin also had: At the end we will have a true cosmic liturgy, where the cosmos becomes a living host. Let's pray to the Lord that he help us be priests in this sense, to help in the transformation of the world in adoration of God, beginning with ourselves.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[mathematics]], specifically in [[abstract algebra]], a '''torsion-free abelian group''' is an [[abelian group]] which has no non-trivial [[torsion (algebra)|torsion]] elements; that is, a [[group (mathematics)|group]] in which the [[group operation]] is [[commutative property|commutative]] and the [[identity element]] is the only element with finite [[order (group theory)|order]].  That is, multiples of any element other than the identity element generate an infinite number of distinct elements of the group.

== Definitions ==
{{main|Abelian group}}

An '''[[abelian group]]''' &lt;math&gt; \langle G, * ,e\rangle &lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''torsion-free''' if no element other than the identity &lt;math&gt; e &lt;/math&gt; is of finite [[Order (group theory)|order]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Fraleigh|1976|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lang|2002|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hungerford|1974|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compare this notion to that of a '''torsion group''' where every element of the group is of finite order. 

A natural example of a torsion-free group is &lt;math&gt; \langle \mathbb Z,+,0\rangle &lt;/math&gt;, as only the integer 0 can be added to itself finitely many times to reach 0.

==Properties==
* A torsion-free abelian group has no non-trivial finite [[subgroup (mathematics)|subgroup]]s.
* A [[generating set of a group#finitely generated group|finitely generated]] torsion-free abelian group is [[free abelian group|free]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lang|2002|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle of '''unicity''' explains that each event, each living being, each object, each person or each circumstance has the characteristic of its [[uniqueness]], of its particularity. Other similar events, living beings, objects, persons or circumstances may exist, but never the same entity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.webdianoia.com/glosario/display.php?action=view&amp;id=329&amp;from=action=search%7Cby=U&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Harris''' (1867–1931) was an early [[Western Australian]] leader for [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] [[civil rights]].&lt;ref name=" Harris, William (1867 - 1931) Biographical Entry "&gt;{{cite web |url=http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A090213b.htm|title= Biographical Entry |work=Australian Dictionary of Biography Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1867 - Born in Western Australia, he received a rudimentary education as a private pupil at the Swan Native and Half-Caste Mission, before educating himself to a considerable extent.

1904 – While working at the ports and on stations in the Ashburton and Gascoyne districts of Western Australia, Harris witnessed the brutish and cruel practices used to oppress, disenfranchise and subjugate the local Aboriginal people. After ''The Times'' (London) and the Australia press published an account of the ill-treatment of Aboriginal people in the Nor’-West of the State, Harris entered public debate about the issue with a letter to the press accusing the Colonial Secretary, [[Walter Kingsmill]] of willful hypocrisy and misrepresentation. Kingsmill had vehemently denied there was any evidence of the ill-treatment of Aboriginal people. Harris also criticized the Chief Protector of Aborigines for Western Australia, Henry Charles [[Prinsep]] for turning Aboriginal people off their land.

At the time the State Registrar-General, Malcolm A.C. Fraser had Harris in mind for a temporary position with the State Government to compile the vocabulary and descriptions of Aboriginal customs from different portions of the State together for posterity. Within weeks of the publication of Harris’s letter Malcolm Fraser appointed journalist Mrs [[Daisy Bates (Australia)|Daisy Bates]] to the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Queen of Deception|last = Lomas|first = Brian|publisher = Amazon|year = 2015|isbn = 9781517053857|location = |pages = 47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1906 – While prospecting in the Eastern Goldfields of Western Australia, Harris observed extensive starvation  and disease among the local Aboriginal population. Harris was so concerned by what he witnessed that he traveled to Perth and on February 8, 1906, Harris and the Goldfields MP, [[Patrick Lynch (Australian politician)|Patrick Lynch]] M.L.A. met with the State Premier, Mr C.H. [[Rason Ministry|Rason]]. Harris explained that the Aboriginal people living on the eastern goldfields were in desperate need of food and medicine and handed Premier Rason a letter signed by the local Justices of the Peace lending their support. Harris also had a meeting with the Chief Protector of Aborigines, Mr Prinsep in an effort to persuade the Aborigines Department to supply rations, clothes and medicine to those starving and diseased.

1921 - When Mrs Daisy Bates began making national headlines with sensational stories accusing the Aboriginal people of cannibalism,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = ABORIGINALS STILL CANNIBALS|last = Bates|first = Daisy|date = 13 May 1921|work = Barrier Miner (Broken Hill, NSW)|access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; William Harris was one of very few who contested her allegations. In her rejoinder to a published letter by Harris disputing her views,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = Proposed Aboriginal Reserve|last = Harris|first = William|date = 4 September 1921|work = Sunday Times (Perth WA)|access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; she wrote, ‘the only good half-caste is a dead one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = Aboriginal Reserves|last = Bates|first = Daisy|date = 2 October 1921|work = Sunday Times, Perth WA.|access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; William Harris reproached her comment as “a stigma on a small class of people whose position in the community was an unenviable one”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = TREATMENT OF HALF-CASTES, Mrs Daisy Bates Reproached.|last = Harris|first = William|date = 8 January 1922|work = Sunday Times, Perth WA.|access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

1926 – Alarmed at the persecution inflicted upon Aboriginal people by the West Australian Aborigines Department and its officials, he voiced the intention to form the Native Union of Western Australia. Harris was particularly concerned about conditions at Mogumber ([[Moore River Native Settlement]]) after the Chief Protector of Aborigines [[A. O. Neville]] changed the settlements purpose from an Aboriginal farming community to an internment camp.

1928 – In March 1928 William Harris headed the first Aboriginal deputation to meet with a West Australian Premier [[Philip Collier]]. Wilfred Morrison, Edward Jacobs, Arthur Kickett, William Bodney, William Harris, his brother Edward and his nephew Norman Harris met with the Premier  for an hour and half.[http://www.slwa.wa.gov.au/federation/popup/400.htm] They asked the Premier to repeal the Aborigines Act 1905 and give Aboriginal people the same rights at the white community. Describing the conditions at Mogumber as intolerable, they implored him to close it down. Because Aboriginal people were prohibited from entering central Perth, throughout the meeting they referred to Perth as ‘white city’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = NATIVES' WORST ENEMY|last = |first = |date = 9 March 1928|work = The Daily News (Perth, WA).|access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; William Harris also told Premier Collier that Mrs Daisy Bates and Chief Protector Neville were the worst enemies of the Aboriginal people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Queen of Deception|last = Lomas|first = Brian|publisher = Amazon|year = 2015|isbn = 9781517053857|location = |pages = 184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1930 - William Harris moved to the town of [[Geraldton]] where he died on 13 July 1931 and is buried in the Aboriginal cemetery at Utacarra, Geraldton.

The Aborigines Act 1905, continued to govern the lives of all Aboriginal people in Western Australia until it was repealed by the Native Welfare Act 1963. Mogumber (Moore River Native Settlement) continued as a segregation facility until 1974.
