      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1833">'''Archaeocytes''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''[[:wikt:archaios|archaios]]'' "beginning" and ''[[:wikt:kytos|kytos]]'' "hollow vessel") or '''amoebocytes'''  are [[Amoeba|amoeboid]] cells found in [[Sea sponge|sponges]].  They are [[Totipotency|totipotent]] and have varied functions depending on the [[species]].

==Location==
Archaeocytes are along with other specialized sponge cells including [[collencyte]]s and structural elements called [[spicule (sponge)|spicule]]s.  They move about within the mesohyl with amoeba-like movements performing a number of important functions.

==Functions==
[[Cellular differentiation]] is an essential function of the archaeocyte.  All specialized cells within the sponge have its origins with the archaeocyte. This is especially important in [[Biological reproduction|reproduction]] as the sex cells of the sponge in [[sexual reproduction]] are formed from these amoeboid cells.  Similarly in [[asexual reproduction]] amoebocytes result in the formation of [[gemmule]]s which are cyst-like spheres containing more amoebocytes as well as other sponge cells including the phylum specific [[choanocyte]]. These cells move within the walls of a sponge and form spicules.

{{Close Relationships|emotions}}
In [[psychology]], the [[theory of attachment]] can be applied to adult relationships including friendships, emotional affairs, adult romantic or platonic relationships and in some cases relationships with inanimate objects ("[[transitional objects]]").&lt;ref name= "Hooley JM, Wilson-Murphy M"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hooley JM.|author2=Wilson-Murphy M.|title=Adult attachment to transitional objects and borderline personality disorder|pmid=22486448|doi=10.1521/pedi.2012.26.2.179|volume=26|journal=J Pers Disord|pages=179-91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attachment theory, initially studied in the 1960s and 1970s primarily in the context of children and parents, was extended to adult relationships in the late 1980s.

Four main styles of attachment have been identified in adults:
*secure
*anxious-preoccupied
*dismissive-avoidant
*fearful-avoidant

Investigators have explored the organization and the stability of mental ''working models'' that underlie these attachment styles. They have also explored how attachment impacts relationship outcomes and how attachment functions in relationship dynamics.

==Extending attachment theory==
[[Mary Ainsworth]] and [[John Bowlby]] founded modern attachment theory on studies of children and their caregivers. Children and caregivers remained the primary focus of attachment theory for many years. Then, in the late 1980s, Cindy Hazan and Phillip Shaver applied attachment theory to adult relationships.&lt;ref name="Hazan Shaver 87"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hazan C. |author2=Shaver P.R. |title=Romantic love conceptualized as an attachment process |journal=J Pers Soc Psychol |volume=52 |issue=3 |pages=511–24 |date=March 1987 |pmid=3572722 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.52.3.511 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/psp/52/3/511}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hazan Shaver 90"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hazan | first1 = C. | last2 = Shaver | first2 = P.R. | year = 1990 | title = Love and work: An attachment theoretical perspective | url = | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = 270–280 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.59.2.270}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hazan Shaver 94"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hazan | first1 = C. | last2 = Shaver | first2 = P.R. | year = 1994 | title = Attachment as an organizational framework for research on close relationships | url = | journal = Psychological Inquiry | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 1–22 | doi=10.1207/s15327965pli0501_1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hazan and Shaver noticed that interactions between adults shared similarities to interactions between children and caregivers. For example, romantic or platonic partners desire to be close to one another. Adults feel comforted when their attachments are present and anxious or lonely when they are absent. Romantic relationships, for example, serve as a secure base that help people face the surprises, opportunities, and challenges life presents. Similarities such as these led Hazan and Shaver to extend attachment theory to adult relationships.

Relationships between adults differ in many ways from relationships between children and caregivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://internal.psychology.illinois.edu/~rcfraley/attachment.htm|title=A Brief Overview of Adult Attachment Theory and Research {{!}} R. Chris Fraley|website=internal.psychology.illinois.edu|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The claim is not that these two kinds of relationships are identical. The claim is that the core principles of attachment theory apply to both kinds of relationships.

Investigators tend to describe the core principles of attachment theory in light of their own theoretical interests. Their descriptions seem quite different on a superficial level. For example, Fraley and Shaver&lt;ref name="Fraley Shaver 00"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fraley | first1 = R.C. | last2 = Shaver | first2 = P.R. | year = 2000 | title = Adult attachment: Theoretical developments, emerging controversies, and unanswered questions | url = | journal = Review of General Psychology | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 132–154 | doi=10.1037/1089-2680.4.2.132}}&lt;/ref&gt; describe the "central propositions" of attachment in adults as follows:
* The emotional and behavioral dynamics of infant–caregiver relationships and adult relationships are governed by the same biological system.
* The kinds of individual differences observed in infant–caregiver relationships are similar to the ones observed in various close adult relationships.
* Individual differences in adult attachment behavior are reflections of the expectations and beliefs people have formed about themselves and their close relationships on the basis of their attachment histories; these "working models" are relatively stable and, as such, may be reflections of early caregiving experiences.
* Romantic love, as commonly conceived, involves the interplay of attachment, caregiving and intimacy.

Compare this with the five "core propositions" of attachment theory listed by Rholes and Simpson:&lt;ref name="Rholes Simpson 04"&gt;Rholes, W.S. &amp; Simpson, J.A. (2004). Attachment theory: Basic concepts and contemporary questions. In W.S. Rholes and J.A. Simpson (Eds.), ''Adult Attachment: Theory, Research, and Clinical Implications'', pp. 3–14. New York, NY: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Although the basic impetus for the formation of attachment relationships is provided by biological factors, the bonds that children form with their caregivers are shaped by interpersonal experience.
* Experiences in earlier relationships create internal working models and attachment styles that systematically affect attachment relationships.
* The attachment orientations of adult caregivers influence the attachment bond their children have with them.
* Working models and attachment orientations are relatively stable over time, but they are not impervious to change.
* Some forms of psychological maladjustment and clinical disorders are attributable in part to the effects of insecure working models and attachment styles.

While these two lists clearly reflect the theoretical interests of the investigators who created them, a closer look reveals a number of shared themes. The shared themes claim that:
* People are biologically driven to form attachments with others, but the process of forming attachments is influenced by learning experiences.
* Individuals form different kinds of attachments depending on the expectations and beliefs they have about their relationships. These expectations and beliefs constitute internal "working models" used to guide relationship behaviors.
* Internal "working models" are relatively stable even though they can be influenced by experience.
* Individual differences in attachment can contribute positively or negatively to mental health and to the quality of relationships with others.

No doubt these themes could be described in a variety of ways (and other themes added to the list). Regardless of how one describes the core principles of attachment theory, the key insight is that the same principles of attachment apply to close relationships throughout the lifespan. The principles of attachment between children and caregivers are fundamentally the same as the principles of attachment between adults.

==Styles==
Adults are described as having 4 attachment styles: Secure, Anxious-preoccupied, Dismissive-avoidant, and Fearful-avoidant.

The secure attachment style in adults corresponds to the secure attachment style in children. The anxious–preoccupied attachment style in adults corresponds to the anxious-ambivalent attachment style in children. However, the dismissive-avoidant attachment style and the fearful-avoidant attachment style, which are distinct in adults, correspond to a single avoidant attachment style in children. The descriptions of adult attachment styles offered below are based on the relationship questionnaire devised by Bartholomew and Horowitz&lt;ref name="Bartholomew Horowitz 91"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bartholomew K, Horowitz LM |title=Attachment styles among young adults: a test of a four-category model |journal=J Pers Soc Psychol |volume=61 |issue=2 |pages=226–44 |date=August 1991 |pmid=1920064 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.61.2.226 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/psp/61/2/226}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on a review of studies by Pietromonaco and Barrett.&lt;ref name="Pietromonaco Barrett 97"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pietromonaco PR, Barrett LF |title=Working models of attachment and daily social interactions |journal=J Pers Soc Psychol |volume=73 |issue=6 |pages=1409–23 |date=December 1997 |pmid=9418285 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.73.6.1409 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/psp/73/6/1409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several attachment-based treatment approaches that can be used with adults.&lt;ref name="Sable 00"&gt;Sable, P., (2000). Attachment &amp; Adult Psychotherapy. Northvale NJ: Aaronson.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there is an approach to treating couples based on [[attachment theory]].&lt;ref name="Johnson 02"&gt;Johnson, S., (2002). Emotionally Focused Couples Therapy with Trauma Survivors. NY: Guilford.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secure===
Securely attached people tend to agree with the following statements: "It is relatively easy for me to become emotionally close to others. I am comfortable depending on others and having others depend on me. I don't worry about being alone or others not accepting me." This style of attachment usually results from a history of warm and responsive interactions with their attachments. Securely attached people tend to have positive views of themselves and their attachments. They also tend to have positive views of their relationships. Often they report greater satisfaction and adjustment in their relationships than people with other attachment styles. Securely attached people feel comfortable both with intimacy and with independence. 

Secure attachment and adaptive functioning are promoted by a caregiver who is emotionally available and appropriately responsive to his or her child's attachment behavior, as well as capable of regulating both his or her positive and negative emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sable|first=Pat|title=What is Adult Attachment?|journal=Clin Soc Work J|date=2008|volume=36 |pages=21–30 |doi=10.1007/s10615-007-0110-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insecure===

==== Anxious-preoccupied ====
People with anxious-preoccupied attachment type tend to agree with the following statements: "I want to be completely emotionally intimate with others, but I often find that others are reluctant to get as close as I would like", and "I am uncomfortable being without close relationships, but I sometimes worry that others don't value me as much as I value them." People with this style of attachment seek high levels of [[intimacy]], approval, and responsiveness from their attachment figure. They sometimes value intimacy to such an extent that they become overly dependent on the attachment figure. Compared with securely attached people, people who are anxious or preoccupied with attachment tend to have less positive views about themselves. They may feel a sense of anxiousness that only recedes when in contact with the attachment figure. They often [[doubt]] their worth as a person and blame themselves for the attachment figure's lack of responsiveness. People who are anxious or preoccupied with attachment may exhibit high levels of emotional expressiveness, [[emotional dysregulation]], worry, and [[impulsiveness]] in their relationships.

==== Dismissive-avoidant ====
People with a dismissive style of avoidant attachment tend to agree with these statements: "I am comfortable without close emotional relationships", "It is  important to me to feel independent and self-sufficient", and "I prefer not to depend on others or have others depend on me." People with this attachment style desire a high level of independence. The desire for independence often appears as an attempt to avoid attachment altogether. They view themselves as self-sufficient and invulnerable to feelings associated with being closely attached to others. They often deny needing close relationships. Some may even view close relationships as relatively unimportant. Not surprisingly, they seek less intimacy with attachments, whom they often view less positively than they view themselves. Investigators commonly note the [[Defense mechanism|defensive]] character of this attachment style. People with a dismissive-avoidant attachment style tend to suppress and hide their feelings, and they tend to deal with [[Social rejection|rejection]] by distancing themselves from the sources of rejection (e.g. their attachments or relationships).

==== Fearful-avoidant ====
People with losses or other trauma, such as sexual abuse in childhood and adolescence may often develop this type of attachment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Contextualizing the effects of childhood sexual abuse on adult self- and social functioning: an attachment theory perspective|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0145213499000812 | doi=10.1016/S0145-2134(99)00081-2 | volume=23|journal=Child Abuse &amp; Neglect|pages=1141–1157}}&lt;/ref&gt; and tend to agree with the following statements: "I am somewhat uncomfortable getting close to others. I want emotionally close relationships, but I find it difficult to trust others completely, or to depend on them. I sometimes worry that I will be hurt if I allow myself to become too close to other people."
They tend to feel uncomfortable with emotional closeness, and the mixed feelings are combined with sometimes unconscious, negative views about themselves and their attachments. They commonly view themselves as unworthy of responsiveness from their attachments, and they don't trust the intentions of their attachments. Similar to the dismissive-avoidant attachment style, people with a fearful-avoidant attachment style seek less intimacy from attachments and frequently suppress and deny their feelings. Because of this, they are much less comfortable expressing affection.

==Working models==
Bowlby observed that children learn from their interactions with caregivers. Over the course of many interactions, children form expectations about the accessibility and helpfulness of their caregivers. These expectations reflect children's thoughts about themselves and about their caregivers:
{{quote|Confidence that an attachment figure is, apart from being accessible, likely to be responsive can be seen to turn on at least two variables: (a) whether or not the attachment figure is judged to be the sort of person who in general responds to calls for support and protection; (b) whether or not the self is judged to be the sort of person towards whom anyone, and the attachment figure in particular, is likely to respond in a helpful way. Logically, these variables are independent. In practice they are apt to be confounded. As a result, the model of the attachment figure and the model of the self are likely to develop so as to be complementary and mutually confirming. (Bowlby, 1973, p. 238)&lt;ref name="Bowlby 73"&gt;Bowlby, J. (1973). Separation: Anxiety &amp; Anger, Volume 2 of Attachment and loss London. Hogarth Press; New York: Basic Books; Harmondsworth: Penguin (1975).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Children's thoughts about their caregivers, together with thoughts about how deserving they are themselves of good care from their caregivers, form ''working models'' of attachment. Working models help guide behavior by allowing children to anticipate and plan for caregiver responses. Bowlby theorized that once formed,  working models remain relatively stable. Children usually interpret experiences in the light of their working models, rather than change their working models to fit new experiences. However, when experiences cannot be interpreted in the light of their working models children may then modify their working models.

When Hazen and Shaver extended attachment theory to romantic relationships in adults, they also included the idea of working models. Research into adult working models has focused on two issues. First, how are the thoughts that form working models organized in the mind? Second, how stable are working models across time? These questions are briefly discussed below.

===Organization of working models===
Bartholomew and Horowitz have proposed that working models consist of two parts.&lt;ref name="Bartholomew Horowitz 91"/&gt; One part deals with thoughts about the self. The other part deals with thoughts about others. They further propose that a person's thoughts about self are generally positive or generally negative. The same applies to a person's thoughts about others. In order to test these proposals, Bartholomew and Horowitz have looked at the relationship between attachment styles, self-esteem, and sociability. The diagram below shows the relationships they observed:
&lt;center&gt;
{| class="wikitable" align="center"
|+ Security-based strategy of affect regulation
! colspan=2 rowspan=2 style="background: none;" |
! colspan=2 | Self-esteem&lt;br&gt;(thoughts about self)
|-
! Positive
! Negative
|-
! rowspan=2 | Sociability&lt;br&gt;(thoughts about others)
! Positive
| Secure
| Anxious-preoccupied
|-
! Negative
| Dismissive-avoidant
| Fearful-avoidant
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

The secure and dismissive attachment styles are associated with higher self-esteem compared with the anxious and fearful attachment styles. This corresponds to the distinction between positive and negative thoughts about the self in working models. The secure and anxious attachment styles are associated with higher sociability than the dismissive or fearful attachment styles. This corresponds to the distinction between positive and negative thoughts about others in working models. These results suggested working models indeed contain two distinct domains—thoughts about self and thoughts about others—and that each domain can be characterized as generally positive or generally negative.

Baldwin and colleagues have applied the theory of relational schemas to working models of attachment. Relational schemas contain information about the way the attachment figure regularly interact with each other.&lt;ref name= "Baldwin 92"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baldwin | first1 = M.W. | year = 1992 | title = Relational schemas and the processing of social information | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 112 | issue = | pages = 461–484 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.112.3.461}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baldwin 97"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baldwin | first1 = M.W. | year = 1997 | title = Relational schemas as a source of if-then self-inference procedures | url = | journal = Review of General Psychology | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 326–335 | doi=10.1037/1089-2680.1.4.326}}&lt;/ref&gt; For each pattern of interaction that regularly occurs between partners, a relational schema is formed that contains:
* information about the self
* information about the attachment
* information about the way the interaction usually unfolds.

For example, if a person regularly asks his or her partner for a hug or kiss, and the partner regularly responds with a hug or kiss, the person forms a relational schema representing the predictable interaction. The schema contains information about the self (e.g., "I need lots of physical affection"). It also contains information about the partner (e.g., "My partner is an affectionate person"). And it contains information about the way the interaction usually unfolds, which can be summarized by an if–then statement (e.g., "''If'' I ask my partner for a hug or kiss, ''then'' my partner will respond with a hug or kiss and comfort me"). Relational schemas help guide behavior in relationships by allowing people to anticipate and plan for partner responses.

Baldwin and colleagues have proposed that working models of attachment are composed of relational schemas. The fact that relational schemas contain information about the self and information about others is consistent with previous conceptions of working models. The unique contribution of relational schemas to working models is the information about the way interactions with attachments usually unfold. Relational schemas add the if–then statements about interactions to working models. To demonstrate that working models are organized as relational schemas, Baldwin and colleagues created a set of written scenarios that described interactions dealing with trust, dependency and closeness.&lt;ref name="Baldwin Fehr Keedian Seidel Thompson 93"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baldwin | first1 = M.W. | last2 = Fehr | first2 = B. | last3 = Keedian | first3 = E. | last4 = Seidel | first4 = M. | last5 = Thompson | first5 = D.W. | year = 1993 | title = An exploration of the relational schemata underlying attachment styles: self-report and lexical decision approaches | url = | journal = [[Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin]] | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 746–754 | doi=10.1177/0146167293196010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the scenarios for closeness included:
* You want to spend more time with your attachment.
* You reach out to hug or kiss your partner.
* You tell your attachment how deeply you feel for him or her.

Following each scenario, people were presented with two options about how their attachments might respond. One option was "he/she accepts you." The other option was "he/she rejects you." People were asked to rate the likelihood of each response on a seven-point scale. Ratings of likely attachment responses corresponded to people's attachment styles. People with secure attachment styles were more likely to expect accepting responses from their attachments. Their relational schema for the third closeness scenario would be, "''If'' I tell my partner how deeply I feel for him or her, ''then'' my partner will accept me." People with other attachment styles were less likely to expect accepting responses from their attachments. Their relational schema for the third closeness scenario would be, "''If'' I tell my partner how deeply I feel for him or her, ''then'' my attachment will reject me." Differences in attachment styles reflected differences in relational schemas. Relational schemas may therefore be used to understand the organization of working models of attachment, as has been demonstrated in subsequent studies.&lt;ref name="Baldwin Fehr 95"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baldwin | first1 = M.W. | last2 = Fehr | first2 = B. | year = 1995 | title = On the Instability of Attachment Style Ratings | url = | journal = Personal Relationships | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 247–261 | doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.1995.tb00090.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baldwin Keelan Fehr Enns Koh-Rangarajoo 96"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baldwin | first1 = M.W. | last2 = Keelan | first2 = J.P.R. | last3 = Fehr | first3 = B. | last4 = Enns | first4 = V. | last5 = Koh-Rangarajoo | first5 = E. | year = 1996 | title = Social-cognitive conceptualization of attachment working models: Availability and accessibility effects | url = | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 71 | issue = | pages = 94–109 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.71.1.94}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baldwin Meunier 99"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baldwin | first1 = M.W. | last2 = Meunier | first2 = J. | year = 1999 | title = The Cued Activation of Attachment Relational Schemas | url = | journal = Social Cognition | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 209–227 | doi=10.1521/soco.1999.17.2.209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relational schemas involved in working models are likely organized into a hierarchy. According to Baldwin:
{{quote|A person may have a general working model of relationships, for instance, to the effect that others tend to be only partially and unpredictably responsive to one's needs. At a more specific level, this expectation will take different forms when considering different role relationships, such as customer or romantic partner. Within romantic relationships, expectations might then vary significantly depending on the specific attachment, or the specific situation, or the specific needs being expressed. (Baldwin, 1992, p. 429).&lt;ref name="Baldwin 92"/&gt;}}

The highest level of the hierarchy contains very general relational schemas that apply to all relationships. The next level of the hierarchy contains relational schemas that apply to particular kinds of relationships. The lowest level of the hierarchy contains relationship schemas that apply to specific relationships.

In fact, several theorists have proposed a hierarchical organization of working models.&lt;ref name="Bowlby 80"&gt;Bowlby, J.

''Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development'', 50 (1–2, Serial No. 209).&lt;/ref&gt; Pietromonaco and Barrett note:
{{quote|From this perspective, people do not hold a single set of working models of the self and others; rather, they hold a family of models that include, at higher levels, abstract rules or assumptions about attachment relationships and, at lower levels, information about specific relationships and events within relationships. These ideas also imply that working models are not a single entity but are multifaceted representations in which information at one level need not be consistent with information at another level. (Pietromonaco &amp; Barrett, 2000, page 159)&lt;ref name="Pietromonaco Barrett 00"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pietromonaco | first1 = P.R. | last2 = Barrett | first2 = L.F. | year = 2000 | title = The internal working models concept: What do we really know about the self in relation to others? | url = | journal = Review of General Psychology | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 155–175 | doi=10.1037/1089-2680.4.2.155}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Every hierarchy for working models includes both general working models (higher in the hierarchy) and relationship-specific working models (lower in the hierarchy). Studies have supported the existence of both general working models and relationship-specific working models. People can report a general attachment style when asked to do so, and the majority of their relationships are consistent with their general attachment style.&lt;ref name="Baldwin Keelan Fehr Enns Koh-Rangarajoo 96"/&gt; A general attachment style indicates a general working model that applies to many relationships. Yet, people also report different styles of attachments to their friends, parents and lovers.&lt;ref name="Trinke Bartholomew 97"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Trinke | first1 = S.J. | last2 = Bartholomew | first2 = K. | year = 1997 | title = Hierarchies of attachment relationships in young adulthood | url = | journal = [[Journal of Social and Personal Relationships]] | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 603–625 | doi=10.1177/0265407597145002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="La Guardia Ryan Couchman Deci 00"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=La Guardia JG, Ryan RM, Couchman CE, Deci EL |title=Within-person variation in security of attachment: a self-determination theory perspective on attachment, need fulfillment, and well-being |journal=J Pers Soc Psychol |volume=79 |issue=3 |pages=367–84 |date=September 2000 |pmid=10981840 |doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.79.3.367 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/psp/79/3/367}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relationship-specific attachment styles indicate relationship-specific working models. Evidence that general working models and relationship-specific working models are organized into a hierarchy comes from a study by Overall, Fletcher and Friesen.&lt;ref name="Overall Fletcher Friesen 03"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Overall | first1 = N.C. | last2 = Fletcher | first2 = G.J.O. | last3 = Friesen | first3 = M.D. | year = 2003 | title = Mapping the [[intimate relationship]] mind: Comparisons between three models of attachment representations | url = | journal = [[Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin]] | volume = 29 | issue = | pages = 1479–1493 | doi=10.1177/0146167203251519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In summary, the mental working models that underlie attachment styles appear to contain information about self and information about others organized into relational schemas. The relational schemas are themselves organized into a three-tier hierarchy. The highest level of the hierarchy contains relational schemas for a general working model that applies to all relationships. The middle level of the hierarchy contains relational schemas for working models that apply to different types of relationships (e.g., friends, parents, lovers). The lowest level of the hierarchy contains relational schemas for working models of specific relationships.

===Stability of working models===
Investigators study the stability of working models by looking at the stability of attachment styles. Attachment styles reflect the thoughts and expectations that constitute working models. Changes in attachment styles therefore indicate changes in working models.

Around 70–80% of people experience no significant changes in attachment styles over time.&lt;ref name="Baldwin Fehr 95"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Waters Merrick Treboux Crowell Albersheim 00"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Waters | first1 = E. | last2 = Merrick | first2 = S. | last3 = Treboux | first3 = D. | last4 = Crowell | first4 = J. | last5 = Albersheim | first5 = L. | year = 2000 | title = Attachment security in infancy and early adulthood: A twenty-year longitudinal study | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 71 | issue = | pages = 684–689 | doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00176 | pmid=10953934}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick Hazen 94"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kirkpatrick | first1 = L. | last2 = Hazen | first2 = C. | year = 1994 | title = Attachment styles and close relationships: A four year prospective study | url = | journal = Personal Relationships | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 123–142 | doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.1994.tb00058.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Feeney Noller 92"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Feeney | first1 = J. | last2 = Noller | first2 = P. | year = 1992 | title = Attachment style and romantic love: Relationship dissolution | url = | journal = Australian Journal of Psychology | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 69–74 | doi=10.1080/00049539208260145}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scharfe Bartholomew 94"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Scharfe | first1 = E. | last2 = Bartholomew | first2 = K. | year = 1994 | title = Reliability and stability of adult attachment patterns | url = | journal = Personal Relationships | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 23–43 | doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.1994.tb00053.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that attachment styles do not change for a majority of people indicates working models are relatively stable. Yet, around 20–30% of people do experience changes in attachment styles. These changes can occur over periods of weeks or months. The number of people who experience changes in attachment styles, and the short periods over which the changes occur, suggest working models are not rigid personality traits.

Why attachment styles change is not well understood. Waters, Weinfield and Hamilton propose that negative life experiences often cause changes in attachment styles.&lt;ref name="Waters Weinfield Hamilton 00"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Waters | first1 = E. | last2 = Weinfield | first2 = N.S. | last3 = Hamilton | first3 = C.E. | year = 2000 | title = The stability of attachment styles from infancy to adolescence and early adulthood: General discussion | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 71 | issue = | pages = 703–706 | doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their proposal is supported by evidence that people who experience negative life events also tend to experience changes in attachment styles.&lt;ref name="Waters Merrick Treboux Crowell Albersheim 00"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Hamilton 00"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = C.E. | year = 2000 | title = Continuity and discontinuity of attachment from infancy through adolescence | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 71 | issue = | pages = 690–694 | doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00177}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weinfield Sroufe Egelund 00"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weinfield | first1 = N.

The study found that all four sets of factors cause changes in attachment styles. Changes in attachment styles are complex and depend on multiple factors.

==Relationship outcomes==
Adult relationships vary in their outcomes. The participants of some relationships express more [[Contentment|satisfaction]] than the participants of other relationships. The participants of some relationships stay together longer than the partners of other relationships. Does attachment influence the satisfaction and duration of relationships?

===Satisfaction===
Several studies have linked attachment styles to relationship satisfaction. People who have secure attachment styles usually express greater satisfaction with their relationships than people who have other attachment styles.&lt;ref name="Brennan Shaver 95"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brennan | first1 = K.A. | last2 = Shaver | first2 = P.R. | year = 1995 | title = Dimensions of adult attachment, affect regulation, and romantic relationship functioning | url = | journal = [[Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin]] | volume = 21 | issue = | pages = 267–283 | doi=10.1177/0146167295213008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Feeney 94"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Feeney | first1 = J.A. | year = 1994 | title = Attachment style, communication patterns and satisfaction across the life cycle of marriage | url = | journal = Personal Relationships | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 333–348 | doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.1994.tb00069.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Feeney 96"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Feeney | first1 = J.A. | year = 1996 | title = Attachment, caregiving, and marital satisfaction | url = | journal = Personal Relationships | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 401–416 | doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.1996.tb00124.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Feeney Noller Callan 94"&gt;Feeney, J.A., Noller, P., &amp; Callan, V.J.

Although the link between attachment styles and marital satisfaction has been firmly established, the mechanisms by which attachment styles influence marital satisfaction remain poorly understood. One mechanism may be communication. Secure attachment styles may lead to more constructive communication and more intimate self-disclosures, which in turn increase relationship satisfaction.&lt;ref name="Feeney 94"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Keelan Dion Dion 98"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keelan | first1 = J.P.R. | last2 = Dion | first2 = K.K. | last3 = Dion | first3 = K.L. | year = 1998 | title = Attachment style and relationship satisfaction: Test of a self-disclosure explanation | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Behavioural Science | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 24–35 | doi=10.1037/h0087055}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other mechanisms by which attachment styles may influence relationship satisfaction include emotional expressiveness,&lt;ref name="Feeney 99"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Feeney | first1 = J.A. | year = 1999 | title = Adult attachment, emotional control, and marital satisfaction | url = | journal = Personal Relationships | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 169–185 | doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.1999.tb00185.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davila Bradbury Fincham 98"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davila | first1 = J. | last2 = Bradbury | first2 = T.N. | last3 = Fincham | first3 = F. | year = 1998 | title = Negative affectivity as a mediator of the association between adult attachment and marital satisfaction | url = | journal = Personal Relationships | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 467–484 | doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.1998.tb00183.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; strategies for coping with conflict,&lt;ref name="Lussier Sabourin Turgeon 97"/&gt; and perceived support from partners.&lt;ref name="Meyers Landsberger 02"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cobb Davila Bradbury 01"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cobb | first1 = R.J. | last2 = Davila | first2 = J. | last3 = Bradbury | first3 = T.N. | year = 2001 | title = Attachment security and marital satisfaction: The role of positive perceptions and social support | url = | journal = [[Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin]] | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 1131–1143 | doi=10.1177/0146167201279006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further studies are needed to better understand how attachment styles influence relationship satisfaction.

===Duration===
Some studies suggest people with secure attachment styles have longer-lasting relationships.&lt;ref name="Simpson 90"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Simpson | first1 = J.A. | year = 1990 | title = Influence of attachment styles on romantic relationships | url = | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = 971–980 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.59.5.971}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Duemmler Kobak 01"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Duemmler | first1 = S.L. | last2 = Kobak | first2 = R. | year = 2001 | title = The development of commitment and attachment in dating relationships: attachment security as relationship construct | url = | journal = Journal of Adolescence | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 401–415 | doi=10.1006/jado.2001.0406}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be partly due to commitment. People with secure attachment styles tend to express more commitment to their relationships. People with secure attachment styles also tend to be more satisfied with their relationships, which may encourage them to stay in their relationships longer. However, secure attachment styles are by no means a guarantee of long-lasting relationships.

Nor are secure attachment styles the only attachment styles associated with stable relationships. People with anxious–preoccupied attachment styles often find themselves in long-lasting, but unhappy, relationships.&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick Davis 94"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kirkpatrick | first1 = L.A. | last2 = Davis | first2 = K.E. | year = 1994 | title = Attachment style, gender, and relationship stability: A longitudinal analysis | url = | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 66 | issue = | pages = 502–512 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.66.3.502}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davila Bradbury 01"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davila | first1 = J. | last2 = Bradbury | first2 = T.N. | year = 2001 | title = Attachment insecurity and the distinction between unhappy spouses who do and do not divorce | url = | journal = Journal of Family Psychology | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 371–393 | doi=10.1037/0893-3200.15.3.371}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anxious–preoccupied attachment styles often involve anxiety about being abandoned and doubts about one's worth as a relationship. These kinds of feelings and thoughts may lead people to stay in unhappy relationships.

==Relationship dynamics==
Attachment plays a role in the way actors interact with one another. A few examples include the role of attachment in affect regulation, support, intimacy, and [[jealousy]]. These examples are briefly discussed below. Attachment also plays a role in many interactions not discussed in this article, such as conflict, communication and sexuality.&lt;ref name="Rholes Simpson Stevens 98"&gt;Rholes, W.S., Simpson, J.A., &amp; Stevens, J.G.

===Affect regulation===
Bowlby, in studies with children, observed that certain kinds of events trigger anxiety, and that people try to relieve their anxiety by seeking closeness and comfort from caregivers.&lt;ref name="Bowlby 69"&gt;Bowlby, J. (1969/1982) Attachment, Vol. 1 of Attachment and loss. London: Hogarth Press. New York: Basic Books (1982).&lt;/ref&gt; Three main sets of conditions trigger anxiety in children:
* Conditions of the child (fatigue, hunger, illness, pain, cold, etc.)
* Conditions involving the caregiver (caregiver absent, caregiver departing, caregiver discouraging of proximity, caregiver giving attention to another child, etc.)
* Conditions of the environment (alarming events, criticism or rejection by others)

The anxiety triggered by these conditions motivates the individuals to engage in behaviors that bring them physically closer to caregivers. A similar dynamic occurs in adults in relationships where others care about them. Conditions involving personal well-being, conditions involving a relationship partner, and conditions involving the environment can trigger anxiety in adults. Adults try to alleviate their anxiety by seeking physical and psychological closeness to their partners.

Mikulincer, Shaver and Pereg have developed a model for this dynamic.&lt;ref name="Mikulincer Shaver Pereg 03"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mikulincer | first1 = M. | last2 = Shaver | first2 = P.R. | last3 = Pereg | first3 = D. | year = 2003 | title = Attachment theory and affect regulation: The dynamics, development, and cognitive consequences of attachment-related strategies | url = | journal = Motivation and Emotion | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 77–102 | doi=10.1023/a:1024515519160}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the model, when people experience anxiety, they try to reduce their anxiety by seeking closeness with relationship partners. However, the partners may accept or reject requests for greater closeness. This leads people to adopt different strategies for reducing anxiety. People engage in three main strategies to reduce anxiety.

The first strategy is called the ''security-based'' strategy. The diagram below shows the sequence of events in the security-based strategy.
[[File:Attachment Theory Security Based.png|border|center|Security-based strategy of affect regulation.]]
A person perceives something that provokes anxiety. The person tries to reduce the anxiety by seeking physical or psychological closeness to her or his attachment. The attachment responds positively to the request for closeness, which reaffirms a sense of security and reduces anxiety. The person returns to her or his everyday activities.

The second strategy is called the ''hyperactivation'', or anxiety attachment, strategy. The diagram below shows the sequence of events in the hyperactivation strategy.
[[File:Attachment Theory Hyperactivation.png|border|center|Hyperactivation strategy of affect regulation.]]
The events begin the same way. Something provokes anxiety in a person, who then tries to reduce anxiety by seeking physical or psychological closeness to their attachment. The attachment rebuffs the request for greater closeness. The lack of responsiveness increases feelings of insecurity and anxiety. The person then gets locked into a cycle with the attachment: the person tries to get closer, the attachment rejects the request for greater closeness, which leads the person to try even harder to get closer, followed by another rejection from the attachment, and so on. The cycle ends only when the situation shifts to a security-based strategy (because the attachment finally responds positively) or when the person switches to an attachment avoidant strategy (because the person gives up on getting a positive response from the attachment).

The third strategy is called the ''attachment avoidance'' strategy. The following diagram shows the sequence of events in the attachment avoidance strategy.
[[File:Attachment Theory Attachment Avoidance.png|border|center|Attachment avoidance strategy of affect regulation.]]
The events begin the same way as the security-based strategy. A person perceives something that triggers anxiety, and the person tries to reduce anxiety by seeking physical or psychological closeness to her or his attachment. But the attachment is either unavailable or rebuffs the request for closeness. The lack of responsiveness fuels insecurity and heightens anxiety. The person gives up on getting a positive response from the attachment, suppresses her or his anxiety, and distances herself or himself from the attachment.

Mikulincer, Shaver, and Pereg contend these strategies of regulating attachment anxiety have very different consequences.&lt;ref name="Mikulincer Shaver Pereg 03"/&gt; The security-based strategy leads to more positive thoughts, such as more positive explanations of why others behave in a particular way and more positive memories about people and events. More positive thoughts can encourage more creative responses to difficult problems or distressing situations. The hyperactivation and attachment avoidance strategies lead to more negative thoughts and less creativity in handling problems and stressful situations. It is notable that the security-based strategy is contingent on a positive response from their attachment. From this perspective, it would benefit people to have attachments who are willing and able to respond positively to the person's request for closeness, so that they can use security-based strategies for dealing with their anxiety.

===Support===
People feel less anxious when close to their attachments because their attachments can provide support during difficult situations. Support includes the comfort, assistance, and information people receive from their attachments.

Attachment influences both the perception of support from others and the tendency to seek support from others. People who have attachments who respond consistently and positively to requests for closeness allow individuals to have secure attachments, and in return they seek more support, in a generally relaxed way, while people whose attachments are inconsistent in reacting positively or regularly reject requests for support find they need to use other attachment styles.&lt;ref name="Kobak Sceery 88"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kobak | first1 = R.R. | last2 = Sceery | first2 = A. | year = 1988 | title = Attachment in late adolescence: Working models, affect regulation, and representations of self and others | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = 135–146 | doi=10.2307/1130395}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mikulincer Florian Weller 93"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mikulincer | first1 = M. | last2 = Florian | first2 = V. | last3 = Weller | first3 = A. | year = 1993 | title = Attachment styles, coping strategies, and post-traumatic psychological distress: The impact of the Gulf War in Israel | url = | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 64 | issue = | pages = 817–826 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.64.5.817}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Simpson Rholes Nelligan 92"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Simpson | first1 = J.A. | last2 = Rholes | first2 = W.S. | last3 = Nelligan | first3 = J.S. | year = 1992 | title = Support seeking and support giving within couples in an anxiety provoking situation: The role of attachment styles | url = | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 62 | issue = | pages = 434–446 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.62.3.434}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Florian Mikulincer Bucholtz 95"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Florian V, Mikulincer M, Bucholtz I |title=Effects of adult attachment style on the perception and search for social support |journal=J Psychol |volume=129 |issue=6 |pages=665–76 |date=November 1995 |pmid=7500299 |doi=10.1080/00223980.1995.9914937}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with secure attachment styles may trust their attachments to provide support because their attachments have reliably offered support in the past. They may be more likely to ask for support when it's needed. People with insecure attachment styles often do not have a history of supportive responses from their attachments. They may rely less on their attachments and be less likely to ask for support when it's needed, though there may be other factors involved, as well.

Changes in the way people perceive attachment tend to occur with changes in the way people perceive support. One study looked at college students' perceptions of attachment to their mothers, fathers, same-sex friends, and opposite-sex friends&lt;ref name="Asendorpf Wilpers 00"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Asendorpf | first1 = J.B. | last2 = Wilpers | first2 = S. | year = 2000 | title = Attachment security and available support: Closely linked relationship qualities | url = | journal = Journal of Social and Personal Relationships | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 115–138 | doi=10.1177/0265407500171006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and found that when students reported changes in attachment for a particular relationship, they usually reported changes in support for that relationship as well. Changes in attachment for one relationship did not affect the perception of support in other relationships. The link between changes in attachment and changes in support was relationship-specific.

===Intimacy===
Attachment theory has always recognized the importance of intimacy. Bowlby writes:
{{quote|Attachment theory regards the propensity to make intimate emotional bonds to particular individuals as a basic component of human nature, already present in germinal form in the neonate and continuing through adult life into old age. (Bowlby, 1988, pp. 120–121)&lt;ref name="Bowlby 88"&gt;Bowlby, J. (1988). A secure base. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The desire for intimacy has biological roots and, in the great majority of people, persists from birth until death. The desire for intimacy also has important implications for attachment. Relationships that frequently satisfy the desire for intimacy lead to more secure attachments. Relationships that rarely satisfy the desire for intimacy lead to less secure attachments.

Collins and Feeney have examined the relationship between attachment and intimacy in detail.&lt;ref name="Collins Feeney 04"&gt;Collins, N.L. &amp; Freeney, B.C. (2004). An Attachment Theory Perspective on Closeness and Intimacy. In D.J. Mashek &amp; A. Aron (Eds.), ''Handbook of Closeness and Intimacy'', pp. 163–188. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; They define intimacy as a special set of interactions in which a person discloses something important about himself or herself, and their attachment responds to the disclosure in a way that makes the person feel validated, understood, and cared for. These interactions usually involve verbal self-disclosure. However, intimate interactions can also involve non-verbal forms of self-expression such as touching, hugging, kissing, and sexual behavior. From this perspective, intimacy requires the following:
* willingness to disclose one's true thoughts, feelings, wishes, and fears
* willingness to rely on an attachment for care and emotional support
* willingness to engage in physical intimacy in the case of romantic or potential romantic partners

Collins and Feeney review a number of studies showing how each attachment style relates to the willingness to self-disclose, the willingness to rely on partners, and the willingness to engage in physical intimacy. The secure attachment style is generally related to more self-disclosure, more reliance on partners, and more physical intimacy than other attachment styles. However, the amount of intimacy in a relationship can vary due to personality variables and situational circumstances, and so each attachment style may function to adapt an individual to the particular context of intimacy in which they live.

Mashek and Sherman report some findings on the desire for less closeness with partners.&lt;ref name="Mashek Sherman 04"&gt;Mashek, D.J., &amp; Sherman, M.D. (2004). Desiring less closeness with initimate others. In A. Aron and Mashek, D.J. (Eds.), ''Handbook of Closeness and Intimacy'' (pp. 343–356). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes too much intimacy can be suffocating. People in this situation desire less closeness with their partners. On one hand, the relationship between attachment styles and desire for less closeness is predictable. People who have fearful-avoidant and anxious-preoccupied attachment styles typically want greater closeness with their partners. People who have dismissive–avoidant attachment styles typically want less closeness with their partners. On the other hand, the relatively large numbers of people who admit to wanting less closeness with their partners (up to 57% in some studies) far outnumbers the people who have dismissive-avoidant attachment styles. This suggests people who have secure, anxious–preoccupied, or fearful-avoidant attachment styles sometimes seek less closeness with their partners. The desire for less closeness is not determined by attachment styles alone.

===Jealousy===
{{main|Jealousy}}
Jealousy refers to the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that occur when a person believes a valued relationship is threatened by a rival. A jealous person experiences anxiety about maintaining support, intimacy, and other valued qualities of her or his relationship. Given that attachment relates to anxiety regulation, support, and intimacy, as discussed above, it is not surprising that attachment also relates to jealousy.

Bowlby observed that attachment behaviors in children can be triggered by the presence of a rival:
{{quote|In most young children the mere sight of mother holding another baby in her arms is enough to elicit strong attachment behaviour. The older child insists on remaining close to his mother, or on climbing on to her lap. Often he behaves as though he were a baby. It is possible that this well-known behaviour is only a special case of a child reacting to mother's lack of attention and lack of responsiveness to him. The fact, however, that an older child often reacts in this way even when his mother makes a point of being attentive and responsive suggests that more is involved; and the pioneer experiments of Levy (1937) also indicate that the mere presence of a baby on mother's lap is sufficient to make an older child much more clinging. (Bowlby, 1969/1982, page 260)&lt;ref name="Bowlby 69"/&gt;}}

When children see a rival contending for a caregiver's attention, the children try to get close to the caregiver and capture the caregiver's attention. Attempts to get close to the caregiver and capture the caregiver's attention indicate the attachment system has been activated. But the presence of a rival also provokes jealousy in children. The jealousy provoked by a sibling rival has been described in detail.&lt;ref name="Volling McElwain Miller 02"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Volling | first1 = B.L. | last2 = McElwain | first2 = N.L. | last3 = Miller | first3 = A.L. | year = 2002 | title = Emotion regulation in context: The jealousy complex between young siblings and its relations with child and family characteristics | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 73 | issue = | pages = 581–600 | doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00425}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies have shown that a rival can provoke jealousy at very young ages. The presence of a rival can provoke jealousy in infants as young as six months old.&lt;ref name="Hart 02"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hart | first1 = S. | year = 2002 | title = Jealousy in 6-month-old infants | url = | journal = Infancy | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 395–402 | doi=10.1207/s15327078in0303_6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hart 04"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hart | first1 = S. | year = 2004 | title = When infants lose exclusive maternal attention: Is it jealousy? | url = | journal = Infancy | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 57–78 | doi=10.1207/s15327078in0601_3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harris 04"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harris | first1 = C.R. | year = 2004 | title = The evolution of jealousy | url = | journal = American Scientist | volume = 92 | issue = | pages = 62–71 | doi=10.1511/2004.45.919}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attachment and jealousy can both be triggered in children by the presence of a rival.

Attachment and jealousy can be triggered by the same perceptual cues in adults, too.&lt;ref name="Sharpsteen Kirkpatrick 97"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sharpsteen | first1 = D.J. | last2 = Kirkpatrick | first2 = L.A. | year = 1997 | title = Romantic jealousy and adult romantic attachment | url = | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 72 | issue = | pages = 627–640 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.72.3.627}}&lt;/ref&gt; The absence of the attachment can trigger both a need for close proximity and jealousy when people believe the attachment is spending time with a rival. The presence of a rival can also trigger greater need for attachment and jealousy.

Differences in attachment styles influence both the frequency and the pattern of jealous expressions. People who have anxious–preoccupied or fearful-avoidant attachment styles experience jealousy more often and view rivals as more threatening than people who have secure attachment styles.&lt;ref name="Sharpsteen Kirkpatrick 97"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Buunk 97"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buunk | first1 = B.P. | year = 1997 | title = Personality, birth order and attachment styles as related to various types of jealousy | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 997–1006 | doi=10.1016/s0191-8869(97)00136-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guerrero 98"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Guerrero | first1 = L.K. | year = 1998 | title = Attachment-style differences in the experience and expression of romantic jealousy | url = | journal = Personal Relationships | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 273–291 | doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.1998.tb00172.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Radecki-Bush Farrell Bush 93"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Radecki-Bush | first1 = C. | last2 = Farrell | first2 = A.D. | last3 = Bush | first3 = J.I. | year = 1993 | title = Predicting jealous responses: The influence of adult attachment and depression on threat appraisal | url = | journal = Journal of Social and Personal Relationships | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 569–588 | doi=10.1177/0265407593104006}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with different attachment styles also express jealousy in different ways. One study found that:
{{quote|Securely attached participants felt anger more intensely than other emotions and were relatively more likely than other participants to express it, especially toward their attachment. And although anxious participants felt anger relatively intensely, and were as likely as others to express it through irritability, they were relatively unlikely to actually confront their attachment. This might be attributable to feelings of inferiority and fear, which were especially characteristic of the anxiously attached and which might be expected to inhibit direct expressions of anger. Avoidants felt sadness relatively more intensely than did secures in both studies. Further, avoidants were relatively more likely than others to work to maintain their self-esteem and, perhaps as a consequence, relatively unlikely to be brought closer to their attachment. (Sharpsteen &amp; Kirkpatrick, 1997, page 637)&lt;ref name="Sharpsteen Kirkpatrick 97"/&gt;}}

A subsequent study has confirmed that people with different attachment styles experience and express jealousy in qualitatively different ways.&lt;ref name="Guerrero 98"/&gt; Attachment thus plays an important role in jealous interactions by influencing the frequency and the manner in which attachments express jealousy.

===After love===
After dissolution of important romantic relationships people usually go through separation anxiety and grieving. Grief is a process which leads to the acceptance of loss and usually allows the person to move on. During this process people use different strategies to cope. Securely attached individuals tend to look for support, the most effective coping strategy. Avoidantly attached individuals tend to devalue the relationships and to withdraw. Anxiously attached individuals are more likely to use emotionally focused coping strategies and pay more attention to the experienced distress (Pistole, 1996). After the end of the relationships, securely attached individuals tend to have less negative overall emotional experience than insecurely attached individuals  (Pistole, 1995).

===Same-sex relationships===
Ridge &amp; Feeney (1998) have studied a group of gays and lesbians in Australian universities. Results showed that the frequency of attachment styles in the gay and lesbian population was the same as in the heterosexual; at the same time attachment styles have predicted relationship variables in a similar way as in the heterosexual population. However, gay and lesbian adult attachment styles were not related to childhood experiences with parents. Contradicting this last result, Robinson (1999) has found that in the lesbian population there was a link between attachment styles and early parenting. However, unlike in heterosexual females, attachment style was related to participants' relationship with their fathers.

'''BSRIA''' (it takes its name from the initial letters of the '''Building Services Research and Information Association''') is a [[United Kingdom|UK]]-based testing, instrumentation, research and consultancy organisation, providing specialist services in [[construction]] and [[building services engineering]]. It is a not-for-profit, member-based association, with over 650 member companies; related services are delivered by a trading company, BSRIA Limited. Any profits made are invested in its research programme, producing best practice guidance.

BSRIA is a full member of the [[Construction Industry Council]].

==Structure==
BSRIA had a turnover of £11.8 million in 2010/11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About BSRIA|url=http://www.bsria.co.uk/about/|publisher=BSRIA|accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It employs over 180 people at its UK head office in [[Bracknell]] as well as regionally based engineers in the UK and offices in [[France]], [[Spain]], [[Germany]], [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Brazil]] and [[North America]].

BSRIA's mission is&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BSRIA Mission |url=http://www.bsria.co.uk/about/mission/ |publisher=BSRIA |accessdate=13 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009113932/http://www.bsria.co.uk/about/mission/ |archivedate=9 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;
"to enable the building services and construction industries and their clients to enhance the value of the built environment, by improving the quality of their products and services, the efficiency of their provision and the effectiveness of their operation."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== History of BSRIA ==
BSRIA was formed in 1955 as the Heating and [[Ventilation (architecture)|Ventilating]] Research Council, later to become the Heating and Ventilating Research Association. As the industry became increasingly linked with other services so its research association and professional body saw the need to widen their remit. In 1975 the 'building services' scope was adopted, marked by the formation of the Building Services Research and Information Association, commonly shortened to BSRIA, and, in 1976, the formation of the Chartered Institution of Building Services, renamed the [[Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers]] (CIBSE) in 1985.

As the Association's activities developed to meet the needs of an integrated construction industry and to provide more than just research and information, the full name became less relevant. When new government rules required it to split research and other activities into two companies, BSRIA started formal use of the abbreviation.

Trading activities, including research, are now managed through a trading company, BSRIA Limited, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Building Services Research and Information Association, which is a company limited by guarantee. Thus, members - largely companies active in designing and delivering building services - join the Building Services Research and Information Association, and services are provided by BSRIA Limited.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20150">In [[mathematics]], the '''Bianchi classification''', named for [[Luigi Bianchi]], is a classification of [[Lie algebra]]s.

==Classification==

===Lower Dimensions===

In zero dimensions, the only Lie algebra is the [[abelian Lie algebra]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;.  In one dimension, the only Lie algebra is the abelian Lie algebra '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, with outer automorphism group the group of non-zero real numbers.

{{expand section|date=April 2017}}

===Dimension 2===

In two dimensions, there are two Lie algebras:

* The abelian Lie algebra '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, with outer automorphism group GL&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;('''R''').
* The [[solvable Lie algebra]] of 2×2 upper triangular matrices of trace 0. The simply connected group has trivial center and outer automorphism group of order 2; it is the [[affine group]] of the line.

{{expand section|date=April 2017}}

===Dimension 3===

The system classifies 3-dimensional real Lie algebras into 11 classes, 9 of which are single groups and two of which have a continuum of isomorphism classes. Sometimes{{according to whom|date=April 2017}} type Type VI and Type VII groups are included in the infinite families, giving 9 instead of 11 classes.

All the 3-dimensional Lie algebras other than types VIII and IX can be constructed as a semidirect product of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and '''R''', with '''R''' acting on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; by some 2 by 2 matrix ''M''. The different types correspond to different types of matrices ''M'', as described below.

|}

====Type Ⅰ====

This is the abelian and unimodular Lie algebra '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The simply connected group has center '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and outer automorphism group GL&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;('''R'''). This is the case when ''M'' is 0.

====Type Ⅱ====

[[Heisenberg algebra]]. The simply connected group has center '''R''' and outer automorphism group GL&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;('''R'''). This is the case when ''M'' is nilpotent but not 0 (eigenvalues all 0).

====Type Ⅲ====

This algebra is a product of '''R''' and the 2-dimensional non-abelian Lie algebra.  (It is a limiting case of type VI, where one eigenvalue becomes zero.) The simply connected group has center '''R''' and outer automorphism group the group of non-zero real numbers. The matrix ''M'' has one zero and one non-zero eigenvalue.

====Type Ⅳ====

[''y'',''z''] = 0, [''x'',''y''] = ''y'', [''x'', ''z''] = ''y'' + ''z''. The simply connected group has trivial center and outer automorphism group the product of the reals and a group of order 2. The matrix ''M'' has two equal non-zero eigenvalues, but is not semisimple (diagonalizable).

====Type Ⅴ====

[''y'',''z''] = 0, [''x'',''y''] = ''y'', [''x'', ''z''] = ''z''. (A limiting case of type VI where both eigenvalues are equal.) The simply connected group has trivial center and outer automorphism group the elements of GL&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;('''R''') of determinant +1 or −1. The matrix ''M'' has two equal eigenvalues, and is semisimple (diagonalizable).

====Type Ⅵ====

An infinite family. Semidirect products of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; by '''R''', where the matrix ''M'' has non-zero distinct real eigenvalues with non-zero sum. The simply connected group has trivial center and outer automorphism group a product of the non-zero real numbers and a group of order 2.

====Type Ⅵ₀====

This Lie algebra is the semidirect product of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; by '''R''', with '''R''' where the matrix ''M'' has non-zero distinct real eigenvalues with zero sum. It is the Lie algebra of the 2-dimensional [[Poincaré group]], the group of isometries of 2-dimensional [[Minkowski space]]. The simply connected group has trivial center and outer automorphism group the product of the [[positive real numbers]] with the [[dihedral group]] of order 8.

====Type Ⅶ====

An infinite family. Semidirect products of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; by '''R''', where the matrix ''M'' has non-real and non-imaginary eigenvalues. The simply connected group has trivial center and outer automorphism group the non-zero reals.

====Type Ⅶ₀====

Semidirect products of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; by '''R''', where the matrix ''M'' has non-zero imaginary eigenvalues. This is the Lie algebra of the group of isometries of the plane. The simply connected group has center '''Z''' and outer automorphism group a product of the non-zero real numbers and a group of order 2.

====Type Ⅷ====

The Lie algebra ''sl''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;('''R''') of traceless 2 by 2 matrices.  The simply connected group has center '''Z''' and its outer automorphism group has order 2.

====Type Ⅸ====

The Lie algebra of the orthogonal group ''O''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;('''R'''). The simply connected group has center of order 2 and trivial outer automorphism group, and is a [[spin group]].

The classification of 3-dimensional complex Lie algebras is similar except that types VIII and IX become isomorphic, and types VI and VII both become part of a single family of Lie algebras.

The connected 3-dimensional Lie groups can be classified as follows: they are a quotient of the corresponding simply connected Lie group by a discrete subgroup of the center, so can be read off from the table above.

The groups are related to the 8 geometries of Thurston's [[geometrization conjecture]]. More precisely, seven of the 8 geometries can be realized as a left-invariant metric on the simply connected group (sometimes in more than one way). The Thurston geometry of type ''S&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''×'''R''' cannot be realized in this way.

====Structure constants====

The three-dimensional Bianchi spaces each admit a set of three [[Killing vector]]s &lt;math&gt;\xi^{(a)}_i&lt;/math&gt; which obey the following property:

:&lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{\partial \xi^{(c)}_i}{\partial x^k} - \frac{\partial \xi^{(c)}_k}{\partial x^i} \right) \xi^i_{(a)} \xi^k_{(b)} = C^c_{\ ab}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;C^c_{\ ab}&lt;/math&gt;, the "structure constants" of the group, form a [[constant (mathematics)|constant]] [[tensor|order-three tensor]] [[antisymmetric tensor|antisymmetric]] in its lower two indices. For any three-dimensional Bianchi space, &lt;math&gt;C^c_{\ ab}&lt;/math&gt; is given by the relationship

:&lt;math&gt;C^c_{\ ab} = \varepsilon_{abd}n^{cd} - \delta^c_a a_b + \delta^c_b a_a&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{abd}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Levi-Civita symbol]], &lt;math&gt;\delta^c_a&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Kronecker delta]], and the vector &lt;math&gt;a_a = (a,0,0)&lt;/math&gt; and [[diagonal matrix|diagonal]] tensor &lt;math&gt;n^{cd}&lt;/math&gt; are described by the following table, where &lt;math&gt;n^{(i)}&lt;/math&gt; gives the ''i''th [[eigenvalue]] of &lt;math&gt;n^{cd}&lt;/math&gt;;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Course of Theoretical Physics vol. 2: The Classical Theory of Fields |author=Lev Landau |author-link=Lev Landau  |author2=Evgeny Lifshitz|author2-link=Evgeny Lifshitz |last-author-amp=yes |isbn=978-0-7506-2768-9 |year=1980 |publisher=[[Butterworth-Heinemann]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the parameter ''a'' runs over all positive [[real number]]s:

|}
The standard Bianchi classification can be derived from the structural constants in the following six steps:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Due to the antisymmetry &lt;math&gt;C_{ab}^c = -C_{ba}^c&lt;/math&gt;, there are nine independent constants &lt;math&gt;C_{ab}^c&lt;/math&gt;. These can be equivalently represented by the nine components of an arbitrary constant matrix ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''ab''&lt;/sup&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;C_{ab}^c = \varepsilon_{abd} C^{dc},&lt;/math&gt;

where ε&lt;sub&gt;''abd''&lt;/sub&gt; is the totally antisymmetric three-dimensional Levi-Civita symbol (ε&lt;sub&gt;123&lt;/sub&gt; = 1). Substitution of this expression for &lt;math&gt;C_{ab}^c&lt;/math&gt; into the [[Jacobi identity]], results in
:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{abd} C^{bd} C^{ac} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The structure constants can be transformed as:
:&lt;math&gt;C^{ab} = \left (\det{A} \right )^{-1} A_m^a A_n^b \acute{C}^{mn}.&lt;/math&gt;
Appearance of det '''A''' in this formula is due to the fact that the symbol ε&lt;sub&gt;''abd''&lt;/sub&gt; transforms as tensor density: &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{abc} = \left ( \det{A} \right ) D_a^m D_b^n D_c^d \acute{\varepsilon}_{mnd}&lt;/math&gt;, where έ&lt;sub&gt;''mnd''&lt;/sub&gt; ≡ ε&lt;sub&gt;''mnd''&lt;/sub&gt;. By this transformation it is always possible to reduce the matrix ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''ab''&lt;/sup&gt; to the form:
:&lt;math&gt;C^{ab} = \begin{bmatrix}
n_1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; C^{22} &amp; C^{23} \\
0 &amp; C^{32} &amp; C^{33}
\end{bmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;
After such a choice, one still have the freedom of making triad transformations but with the restrictions &lt;math&gt;A_2^1 = A_3^1 = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A_1^2 = A_1^3 = 0.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now, the Jacobi identities give only one constraint:
:&lt;math&gt; \left ( C^{23} - C^{32} \right ) n_1 = 0.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≠ 0 then ''C''&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; – ''C''&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; = 0 and by the remaining transformations with &lt;math&gt;A_{\bar{b}}^{\bar{a}} \neq 0 , \quad \bar{a},\bar{b} = \bar{2},\bar{3}&lt;/math&gt;, the 2 × 2 matrix &lt;math&gt;C^{\bar{a} \bar{b}}&lt;/math&gt; in ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''ab''&lt;/sup&gt; can be made diagonal. Then
:&lt;math&gt;C^{ab} = \begin{bmatrix}
n_1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; n_2 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; n_3
\end{bmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;
The diagonality condition for ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''ab''&lt;/sup&gt; is preserved under the transformations with diagonal &lt;math&gt;A_b^a&lt;/math&gt;. Under these transformations, the three parameters ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; change in the following way:
:&lt;math&gt;n_a = \left ( A_1^1 A_2^2 A_3^3 \right ) \left ( A_a^a \right )^2 \acute{n}_a, \text{no summation over} \ a.&lt;/math&gt;
By these diagonal transformations, the modulus of any ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; (if it is not zero) can be made equal to unity. Taking into account that the simultaneous change of sign of all ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; produce nothing new, one arrives to the following invariantly different sets for the numbers ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (invariantly different in the sense that there is no way to pass from one to another by some transformation of the triad &lt;math&gt;e_a^{\bar{a}} = A_{\bar{b}}^{\bar{a}} e_a^{\bar{b}}&lt;/math&gt;), that is to the following different types of homogeneous
spaces with diagonal matrix ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''ab''&lt;/sup&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
Bianchi \ IX &amp; : &amp; (n_1, n_2, n_3) &amp; = &amp; (1, 1, 1), \\
Bianchi \ VIII &amp; : &amp; (n_1, n_2, n_3) &amp; = &amp; (1, 1, -1), \\
Bianchi \ VII_0 &amp; : &amp; (n_1, n_2, n_3) &amp; = &amp; (1, 1, 0), \\
Bianchi \ VI_0 &amp; : &amp; (n_1, n_2, n_3) &amp; = &amp; (1, -1, 0), \\
Bianchi \ II &amp; : &amp; (n_1, n_2, n_3) &amp; = &amp; (1, 0, 0).
\end{matrix} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider now the case ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0. It can also happen in that case that ''C''&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; – ''C''&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; = 0. This returns to the situation already analyzed in the previous step but with the additional condition ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0. Now, all essentially different types for the sets ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are (0, 1, 1), (0, 1, −1), (0, 0, 1) and (0, 0, 0). The first three repeat the types ''VII''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''VI''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''II''. Consequently, only one new type arises:
:&lt;math&gt;Bianchi \ I \ : \ (n_1 , n_2 , n_3) \ = \ (0, 0, 0).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The only case left is ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 and ''C''&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; – ''C''&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; ≠ 0. Now the 2 × 2 matrix &lt;math&gt;C^{\bar{a} \bar{b}} ( \bar{a}, \bar{b} = 2, 3)&lt;/math&gt; is non-symmetric and it cannot be made diagonal by transformations using &lt;math&gt;A_{\bar{b}}^{\bar{a}} \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;. However, its symmetric part can be diagonalized, that is the 3 × 3 matrix ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''ab''&lt;/sup&gt; can be reduced to the form:
:&lt;math&gt;C^{ab} = \begin{bmatrix}
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; n_2 &amp; a \\
0 &amp; -a &amp; n_3
\end{bmatrix}, &lt;/math&gt;
where ''a'' is an arbitrary number. After this is done, there still remains the possibility to perform transformations with diagonal &lt;math&gt;A_{\bar{b}}^{\bar{a}}&lt;/math&gt;, under which the quantities ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and ''a'' change as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;n_2 = \left ( A_1^1 A_2^2 A_3^3 \right )^{-1} \left ( A_2^2 \right )^2 \acute{n}_2, \quad n_3 = \left ( A_1^1 A_2^2 A_3^3 \right )^{-1} \left ( A_3^3 \right )^2 \acute{n}_3, \quad a = \left ( A_1^1 \right )^{-1} \acute{a}.&lt;/math&gt;
These formulas show that for nonzero ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a'', the combination ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; is an invariant quantity. By a choice of &lt;math&gt;A_1^1&lt;/math&gt;, one can impose the condition ''a'' &gt; 0 and after this is done, the choice of the sign of &lt;math&gt;A_3^3 \left ( A_2^2 \right )^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; permits one to change both signs of ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; simultaneously, that is the set (''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; , ''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is equivalent to the set (−''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,−''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). It follows that there are the following four different possibilities:
:&lt;math&gt;(a, n_2, n_3 ) = (a, 0, 0), (a, 0, 1), (a, 1, 1), (a, 1,-1).&lt;/math&gt;
For the first two, the number ''a'' can be transformed to unity by a choice of
the parameters &lt;math&gt;A_1^1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A_3^3 \left ( A_2^2 \right )^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. For the second two possibilities, both of these parameters are already fixed and ''a'' remains an invariant and arbitrary positive number. Historically these four types of homogeneous spaces have been classified as:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
Bianchi \ V &amp; : &amp; n_1 = 0, \ (a, n_2, n_3) &amp; = &amp; (1, 0, 0), \\
Bianchi \ IV &amp; : &amp; n_1 = 0, \ (a, n_2, n_3) &amp; = &amp; (1, 0, 1), \\
Bianchi \ VII &amp; : &amp; n_1 = 0, \ (a, n_2, n_3) &amp; = &amp; (a, 1, 1), \\
Bianchi \ III &amp; : &amp; n_1 = 0, \ (a, n_2, n_3) &amp; = &amp; (1, 1, -1), \\
Bianchi \ VI &amp; : &amp; n_1 = 0, \ (a, n_2, n_3) &amp; = &amp; (a, 1, -1).
\end{matrix} &lt;/math&gt;
Type ''III'' is just a particular case of type ''VI'' corresponding to ''a'' = 1. Types ''VII'' and ''VI'' contain an infinity of invariantly different types of algebras corresponding to the arbitrariness of the continuous parameter ''a''. Type ''VII''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a particular case of ''VII'' corresponding to ''a'' = 0 while type ''VI''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a particular case of ''VI'' corresponding also to ''a'' = 0.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

==Curvature of Bianchi spaces==
The Bianchi spaces have the property that their [[Ricci tensor]]s can be [[separation of variables|separated]] into a product of the [[basis vector]]s associated with the space and a coordinate-independent tensor.

For a given [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] 
:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = \gamma_{ab} \xi^{(a)}_i \xi^{(b)}_k dx^i dx^k&lt;/math&gt;
(where &lt;math&gt;\xi^{(a)}_idx^i&lt;/math&gt;　are [[differential form|1-forms]]), the Ricci curvature tensor &lt;math&gt;R_{ik}&lt;/math&gt; is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;R_{ik} = R_{(a)(b)} \xi^{(a)}_i \xi^{(b)}_k&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;R_{(a)(b)} = \frac{1}{2} \left[ C^{cd}_{\ \ b} \left( C_{cda} + C_{dca} \right) + C^c_{\  cd} \left( C^{\ \ d}_{ab} + C^{\ \ d}_{ba} \right) - \frac{1}{2} C^{\ cd}_b C_{acd} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

where the indices on the structure constants are raised and lowered with &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{ab}&lt;/math&gt; which is not a function of &lt;math&gt;x^i&lt;/math&gt;.

== Cosmological application ==
In [[cosmology]], this classification is used for a [[homogeneous space|homogeneous]] [[spacetime]] of dimension 3+1. The 3-dimensional Lie group is as the symmetry group of  the 3-dimensional spacelike slice, and the Lorentz metric satisfying the Einstein equation is generated by varying the metric components as a function of t. The [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]]s are isotropic, which are particular cases of types I, V, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\text{VII}_h&lt;/math&gt; and IX. The Bianchi type I models include the [[Kasner metric]]  as a special case.
The Bianchi IX cosmologies include the [[Taub-NUT vacuum|Taub metric]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Wald]], ''General Relativity'', [[University of Chicago Press]] (1984). {{ISBN|0-226-87033-2}}, (chapt 7.2, pages 168–179)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the dynamics near the singularity is approximately governed by a series of successive Kasner (Bianchi I) periods. The complicated dynamics,
which essentially amounts to billiard motion in a portion of hyperbolic space, exhibits chaotic behaviour, and is named [[Mixmaster universe|Mixmaster]]; its analysis is referred to as the [[BKL singularity|BKL analysis]] after Belinskii, Khalatnikov and Lifshitz.

More recent work{{clarify|date=January 2016}} has established a relation of (super-)gravity theories{{which|date=January 2016}} near a spacelike singularity (BKL-limit) with Lorentzian [[Kac–Moody algebra]]s, [[Weyl group]]s and hyperbolic [[Coxeter group]]s.&lt;ref&gt;M.

[[File:An-actress-at-her-toilet-or-miss-brazen-just-breecht-john-colley.jpg|300px|thumb|1779 John Colley Playbill of an actress dressing in breeches]]
{{Crossdressing|history}}
A '''breeches role''' (also '''pants role''' or '''trouser role''', ''[[Travesti (theatre)|travesti]]'' or "Hosenrolle") is a role in which an actress appears in male clothing. [[Breeches]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|ɪ|tʃ|ᵻ|z}}, also "britches"), tight-fitting knee-length pants, were the standard male garment at the time breeches roles were introduced. 

In opera it also refers to any male character that is sung and acted by a female singer. Most often the character is an adolescent or a very young man, sung by a [[mezzo-soprano]] or [[contralto]].&lt;ref name="Grove"&gt;Budden J. Breeches part. In: ''The New Grove Dictionary of Opera.'' Macmillan, London and New York, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The operatic concept assumes that the character is male, and the audience accepts him as such, even knowing that the actor is not. Cross-dressing female characters (e.g., Leonore in ''[[Fidelio]]'' or Gilda in Act III of ''[[Rigoletto]]'') are not considered breeches roles. The most frequently performed breeches roles are Cherubino (''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]''), Octavian (''[[Der Rosenkavalier]])'', Hansel (''[[Hansel und Gretel (opera)|Hansel und Gretel]]'') and Orpheus (''[[Orfeo ed Euridice|Orpheus and Euridice]]''), though the latter was originally written for a male singer, first a [[castrato]] and later, in the revised French version, an [[haute-contre]].

Because non-musical stage plays generally have no requirements for vocal range, they do not usually contain breeches roles in the same sense as opera. Some plays do have male roles that were written for adult female actors, and (for other practical reasons) are usually played by women (e.g., ''[[Peter and Wendy|Peter Pan]]''); these could be considered modern-era breeches roles. However, in most cases, the choice of a female actor to play a male character is made at the production level; [[Hamlet#Hamlet as a character|Hamlet]] is not a breeches role, but [[Sarah Bernhardt]] once played Hamlet ''as'' a breeches role. When a play is spoken of as "containing" a breeches role, this ''does'' mean a role where a female character pretends to be a man and uses male clothing as a disguise.

== History ==
When the London theatres re-opened in 1660, the first professional actresses appeared on the public stage, replacing the boys in dresses of the [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] era. To see real women speak the risqué dialogue of [[Restoration comedy]] and show off their bodies on stage was a great novelty, and soon the even greater sensation was introduced of women wearing male clothes on stage. Out of some 375 plays produced on the London stage between 1660 and 1700, it has been calculated that 89, nearly a quarter, contained one or more roles for actresses in male clothes (see Howe). Practically every Restoration actress appeared in trousers at some time, and breeches roles would even be inserted gratuitously in revivals of older plays.

Some critics, such as Jacqueline Pearson, have argued that these [[cross-dressing]] roles subvert conventional [[gender roles]] by allowing women to imitate the roistering and sexually aggressive behaviour of male Restoration [[Rake (character)|rakes]], but Elizabeth Howe has objected in a detailed study that the male disguise was "little more than yet another means of displaying the actress as a sexual object". The epilogue to [[Thomas Southerne]]'s ''Sir Anthony Love'' (1690) suggests that it does not much matter if the play is dull, as long as the audience can glimpse the legs of the famous "breeches" actress [[Susanna Verbruggen|Susanna Mountfort]] (also known as Susanna Verbruggen):

:You'll hear with Patience a dull Scene, to see,
:In a contented lazy waggery,
:The Female Mountford bare above the knee.

Katharine Eisaman Maus also argues that as well as revealing the female legs and buttocks, the breeches role frequently contained a revelation scene where the character not only unpins her hair but as often reveals a breast as well. This is evidenced in the portraits of many of these actresses of the Restoration.

Breeches roles remained an attraction on the British stage for centuries, but their fascination gradually declined as the difference in real-life male and female clothing became less extreme. They played a part in [[Victorian burlesque]] and are traditional for the [[principal boy]] in [[pantomime]].

== Opera ==
Historically, the list of roles that are considered to be breeches roles is constantly changing, depending on the tastes of the opera-going public. In early Italian opera, many leading operatic roles were assigned to a [[castrato]], a male castrated before puberty with a very strong and high voice. As the practice of castrating boy singers faded, composers created heroic male roles in the mezzo-soprano range, where singers such as [[Marietta Alboni]] and Rosamunda Pisaroni specialised in such roles.&lt;ref name="Grove"/&gt; (See ''[[Serse|Xerxes]]'' below.)

Currently, many castrato roles are being reclaimed by men. As the training and use of [[countertenor]]s becomes more common, there are more men with these very high voices to sing these roles.

Casting directors are left with choices such as whether to cast the young Prince Orlofsky in [[Johann Strauss II|Johann Strauss II's]] ''[[Die Fledermaus]]'' for a woman or man; both commonly sing the role. When played by a mezzo, the prince looks like a woman, but sounds like a boy. When played by a counter-tenor, he looks like a man, but sings like a woman. This disparity is made even clearer if, as in this case, there is also spoken dialogue.

The term ''Travesty'' (from the Italian ''travesti'', disguised) applies to any roles sung by the opposite sex.&lt;ref&gt;Budden J. Travesty. In: ''The New Grove Dictionary of Opera.'' Macmillan, London and New York, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

A closely related term is a ''skirt role'', a female character to be played by a male singer, usually for comic or visual effect. These roles are often ugly stepsisters or very old women, and are not as common as trouser roles. As women were not allowed to sing on stage in the [[Papal States]] during the [[Baroque period]], many female operatic roles which premiered in those areas were originally written as skirt roles for [[castrato|castrati]] (e.g. ''Mandane'' and ''Semira'' in [[Leonardo Vinci]]'s [[Artaserse (Vinci)|Artaserse]]). Britten's Madwoman in ''[[Curlew River]]'' and the Cook in Prokofiev's ''[[The Love for Three Oranges]]'' are examples. The role of the witch in Humperdinck's ''[[Hänsel und Gretel (opera)|Hänsel und Gretel]]'', although written for a mezzo-soprano is now more regularly{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} sung by a tenor, who sings the part an octave lower. In the same opera the "male" roles of Hänsel, the Sandman, and the Dewman are however meant to be sung by women.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9801">{{about|| the [[hyperpigmentation]] (skin discolouration) condition nicknamed "bronze disease" |Addison's disease}}

'''Bronze disease''' is the irreversible and nearly inexorable [[corrosion]] process occurring when [[chloride]]s come into contact with [[bronze]] or other copper-bearing alloys. It occurs as a dark [[green]] or a lighter fuzzy green coating on copper, bronze, and other copper-bearing alloys generally due either to contamination by salt water or after burial in dirt (as chloride salts are generally present in soil to some degree). If not treated, complete destruction of the affected artifact is possible. Transfer of chlorides from the contaminated artifact to other artifacts can spread the condition.

== Description ==
Bronze disease is the chloride corrosion of cupreous (copper based) artifacts. It was originally thought to be caused by bacteria. It is contagious in that the chlorides which cause it can spread the condition if they are brought into contact with another cupreous object. Despite its name bronze disease can affect any copper-bearing alloy, not just bronze. It is not reserved for antique objects but can affect contemporary metals like modern [[cupro-nickel]] coins.

Bronze disease ranges from vivid green to pastel green. It is commonly present in all colors in this range due to the series of reactions that cause it and there may also be tiny, possibly microscopic, blue crystals. Bronze disease typically affects isolated patches of the object in severe cases being a visibly and tactilely raised bloom of microscopic crystals as well as being associated with pitting. The patches of bronze disease can be scraped off the surface using a fingernail or a wooden pick. These properties are all in comparison with [[verdigris]], which is normally a duller shade, uniform across the whole of the affected object, and cannot be scratched off with wood or fingernails. Unlike bronze disease, verdigris serves to protect the metal.

As it relies upon the presence of chlorides, water, and oxygen, the absence of one of these three halts the progress, although any damage done is irreversible. Treatment for the condition typically involves physical removal of the chlorides (through scrubbing), chemical or electrochemical removal, and then isolating the object from oxygen, water, and future chloride contamination using an airtight container or a wax coating. These treatments may also remove any patina, loss of which is often seen as undesirable to collectors and conservators but is preferable to loss of the object.

Bronze disease is common or even ubiquitous on artifacts recovered from a marine environment due to the presence of chlorides in sea water. Coastal areas may also be hazardous due to salt carried in the atmosphere as well as the humidity. Absence of dissolved chlorides and oxygen in soil means buried objects may not be affected while interred (similarly, lack of soluble salts and oxygen means that buried metals may not develop a [[patina]] or that oxidation of the metal may be reversed). When an artifact is recovered, surface encrustations may hide and/or protect bronze disease.

Chlorides may occur in or on the metal due to contamination from soil, water (especially sea water), the atmosphere, human sweat, or be present as impurities when the object was created. In many cases chlorides may be present within the interior of the artifact; the disease may reoccur if not isolated from water and/or oxygen.

== Reaction ==
Initially copper is oxidized to the cuprous ion:

(1) Cu → Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

The cuprous ion reacts with the chloride ion to form the insoluble white colored salt [[cuprous chloride]]:

(2) Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → CuCl

The cuprous chloride reacts with atmospheric moisture and oxygen to form a green [[cupric chloride]]/cupric hydroxide compound and [[hydrochloric acid]]:

(3) 4 CuCl + 4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·3 Cu(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 HCl

The remaining copper is oxidised by air to the cuprous ion:

(4) Cu → Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

The cuprous ion reacts with the chloride ion in the hydrochloric acid to form the insoluble white colored salt [[cuprous chloride]]:

(5) Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → CuCl

The reaction then repeats from equation (3). It is the presence of two different white and green salts that lead to the fuzzy green appearance.

== Treatment and prevention ==
Initial treatment can involve placing the object in a desiccating environment. Deprived of water, the reaction cannot continue. However, re-exposure of the object to even atmospheric water can restart the process.

=== Surface treatment ===
[[File:Carbonate crystals forming on ancient bronze coin.ogg|thumb|Formation of harmless unidentified sodium carbonate crystals on ancient Roman bronze coin that has been treated in carbonate solution for bronze disease for four weeks and has been removed and rinsed several times. Video has been accelerated to ten times normal speed.]]

Removal of the chlorides is essential. In practice this first involves physical cleaning (with a wooden or even metal pick) to remove the bulk of the chlorides and then chemical treatment. One chemical treatment is soaking the object in a 5% [[sodium sesquicarbonate]] solution. This serves to neutralize the acid that attacks the metal as well as converting the reactive cuprous chloride to largely inert cuprous oxide. The oxide may coat the artifact with unsightly but harmless black spots or generally darken the metal.

The duration of soaking may be days to weeks or even a year for severely contaminated objects. The sesquicarbonate may remove copper from the artifact as it forms a [[complex ion]] with copper. Amateurs report that the patina may be stripped from the artifact but this is when the solution is boiled so that the carbonate rinse removes the chlorides in hours rather than the cool bath of long duration used by professional conservators.

Soaking in [[sodium carbonate]]—which does not form a complex ion with copper and is unlikely to affect the patina but is slower than the sesquicarbonate—or [[benzotriazole]] aqueous solutions may also be used. The carbonate is similar in effect to the sesquicarbonate. The benzotriazole does not remove the chlorides or neutralize the acid present but acts as a physical barrier to water, oxygen, and chlorides and so can be used as a final step in all cases but as a first or only step in only minor cases.

Use of tap water for initial carbonate rinses is fine as any chloride content in the water is low compared to the content found when the chlorides from the contaminated artifact have dissolved into the water. Later rinses should be with distilled water though it is to be noted that the chlorine of a chlorinated town water supply is likely to have evaporated from tap water inside 24 hours and therefore will not further contaminate the object.

[[File:Carbonate crystals formed on ancient bronze coin.png|thumb|Unidentified sodium carbonate crystals (white) formed on the same Roman coin treated for bronze disease. The green masses on the coin's reverse are a copper carbonate which formed in the region where the bronze disease was most prevalent. It will be physically removed to ensure that the chlorides have also been removed prior to further conservation efforts. The photos were taken some 20 minutes after rinsing and surface drying.]]

Instead of rinses, electrolysis may be used, often with sodium carbonate as the electrolyte and mild or stainless steel as the anode. This converts the cupreous ions to elemental copper. Elemental copper released from the chlorides may be redeposited on the artifact as a pinkish coating. A coin may take only hours, whereas a large artifact, such as a cannon, may take months.

Once treated, the specimen should be held in a dry environment and periodically inspected for recurrence of bronze disease as no long-term treatment has been confirmed.

=== Internal treatment ===
If chloride ions have penetrated beyond the surface more rigorous treatment is required.

This typically involves soaking in acetone to displace any water in the specimen. Then soaking in a [[benzotriazole]] (BTA)–[[ethanol]] solution to [[chelate]] the copper and make it unreactive. Pits and holes may be filled with zinc powder, which is then painted over with [[shellac]] coloured to look like the specimen.

=== Prevention ===
Waxes prepared with BTA are available commercially, the idea being that the BTA will prevent any reaction by chelating the surface copper and the wax acting as a physical barrier reducing exposure to water, oxygen, and chlorides. (However, coating an infected object with wax will not obviate the problem.) Storing the object in a completely dry or oxygen free environment will also prevent bronze disease as will isolation from contact with chlorides.

{{Marxism|Variants}}

The '''Budapest School''' ({{lang-hu|Budapesti iskola}}; {{lang-de|Budapester Schule}}) was a [[school of thought]], originally of [[Marxist humanism]], but later of [[Post-Marxism]] and dissident [[Liberalism]] that emerged in [[Hungary]] in the early 1960s, belonging to so called Hungarian New Left. Its members were students or colleagues of [[Georg Lukács]]. The school was originally oriented towards developing Lukacs' later works on [[social ontology]] and [[aesthetics]], but quickly began to challenge the paradigm of Lukacsian-Marxism, thus reconstructing contemporary critical theory.  Most of the members later came to abandon [[Marxism]]. The School also critiqued the "dictatorship over needs" of the Soviet states. Most of the members were forced into exile by the pro-Soviet Hungarian government.

In a letter to the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'' of February 15, 1971, Georg Lukács drew attention to “The Budapest School of Marxism,” and helped attract attention to the school from [[Western Marxism]].

Members of the school include [[Ágnes Heller]], [[Ferenc Fehér]] [[:hu:Fehér Ferenc (filozófus)|(hu)]], [[György Márkus]], [[István Mészáros (professor)|István Mészáros]], [[Mihály Vajda]] and [[Maria Márkus]], among others. The Budapest School's writings have been read and researched widely since the 1960s.

==History==
The [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]] was one of the most important political events of Agnes Heller's life, for at this time she saw the effect of the academic freedoms of Marxist [[critical theory]] as dangerous to the entire political and social structure of Hungary. The uprising confirmed Heller’s ideas that what [[Karl Marx|Marx]] really intended is for the people to have political autonomy and collective determination of social life.

Lukács, Heller and other Marxist critical theorists emerged from the Revolution with the belief that Marxism and [[socialism]] needed to be applied to different nations in individual ways, effectively questioning the role of the [[History of the Soviet Union (1953-1985)|Soviet Union]] in Hungary’s future. These ideas set Heller on an ideological collision course with the new Moscow-supported government of [[János Kádár]]: Heller was again expelled from the Communist Party and she was dismissed from the University in 1958 for refusing to indict Lukács as a collaborator in the Revolution. She was not able to resume her research until 1963, when she was invited to join the Sociological Institute at the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences|Hungarian Academy]] as a researcher (Tormey 4–18) (Grumley 5–15). 
   
From 1963 can be seen the emergence of what would later be called the “Budapest School”, a philosophical forum that was formed by Lukács to promote the renewal of Marxist criticism in the face of [[actually existing socialism]] and its theories. Other participants in the Budapest School included together with Heller her second husband Ferenc Fehér, György Márkus, Mihály Vajda and some other scholars with looser connections to the school (such as [[András Hegedüs]], [[István Eörsi]], [[János Kis]] and [[György Bence]]). The School emphasized the idea of the renaissance of Marxism, described by radical philosophy scholar [[Simon Tormey]] as "a flowering of the critical, oppositional potential they believed lay within Marxism and in particular within the ‘early Marx’ ... the Marxism of the individual ‘rich in needs,' of solidarity and self-governance ... they hoped to precipitate a crisis in those systems that had the temerity to call themselves 'socialist'."

Heller’s work from this period, concentrates on themes such as what Marx means to the character of modern societies; liberation theory as applied to the individual; the work of changing society and government from “the bottom up,” and affecting change through the level of the values, beliefs and customs of "everyday life". Since 1990, Heller has been more interested in the issues of aesthetics in ''The Concept of The Beautiful'' (1998), ''Time Is Out of Joint'' (2002), and ''Immortal Comedy'' (2005).

The Budapest School carried out research on the Political Economy of both the Soviet Union and Western Capitalism. The School accepted many of the critiques of Soviet planning and inefficiency from [[Neoclassical Economics]], as well as the connection between markets and freedom. The Soviet system was condemned as a dictatorship over needs. The school also analyzed the [[mixed economies]] of modern capitalism. Most traditional Marxist economics was jettisoned. [[Economy of Sweden|Sweden]] and the [[Nordic Model]] was held as a model of the mixed economy and managed capitalism. The School advocated Radical Democracy as a solution to the authoritarian and undemocratic features of the mixed economy.

==Ágnes Heller==

Heller was born in 1929. It is well known that she is the most prominent philosopher and aesthetician from Budapest School, and one of the most representative critical theorists from Eastern European Neo-Marxists. She has published more than forty books on social theory, the theory of history, the philosophy of ethics and moral and political philosophy. Since 1990s, she has been paying more attention to issues of aesthetics.

==Ferenc Fehér==
Fehér wrote an important book called Paradoxical poet in the early 1970s under the influence of Georg Lukács's The Theory of the Novel, and later published some writings about aesthetics and political philosophy with Agnes Heller in Australia and the U.S. He died in 1994.

==Mihály Vajda==
Mihály András Vajda is a [[Széchenyi Prize]]-winning Hungarian philosopher, professor, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, full member. His work is primarily in the phenomenology of the 20th-century German philosophy and theory in totalitarian societies. Between 1996 and 2000 the Kossuth Lajos University Institute of Philosophy, 2005 to 2009, the Institute for Philosophical Research Director.

He graduated from high school in 1953, and began his tertiary studies at the Lenin Institute. He studied there until 1956, then from 1957 to 1960 he attended and graduated from the Eötvös Loránd University of Sciences, Faculty of Philosophy, German Philosophy faculty. György Lukács accepted among students, the School of Budapest belonged.

Upon completion of undergraduate studies he worked as a primary school teacher, and in 1961, became a scientific assistant at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences Institute of Philosophy. In 1967 he defended his candidate's dissertation in the philosophy of science. Gradually departed from the Marxist eszmétől, and in 1973 the Budapest school's role in respect of political incompetence and szabadúszóvá dismissed from the institute became a translator and worked as a language teacher. In 1977, Bremen has been a visiting professor, he lectured until 1980. In the 1980s, more than once was in New York visiting professor. 1991-1992 in Siegen, Kassel in 1994 as a teacher.

In 1989, rehabilitated, and in 1990 the Kossuth Lajos University (now University of Debrecen), senior lecturer in the Department of Philosophy University professor was appointed. In 1992 he defended his doctoral thesis. In 1994, the MTA Representative Assembly, and in 2000 became chairman of the Committee of the Institute of Philosophy, and in 2001 he was elected to the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, e-mail, and in 2007 a full member. Between 1999 and 2002 Széchenyi fellowship researched. 2005 emeritálták . Also in 2005, the Institute for Philosophical Research was appointed. The institute is headed by 2009.

Research areas at the beginning of his career, the 20th-century phenomenology, [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Max Scheler]]'s work, he later turned to social theory.
In this period of fascism until 1995, his book is not jelentethette Hungarian. In the 1970s, towards a critical Marxist written works, most of which are also not jelentethetett it. The regime, the possibility of post-modern philosophy, and the impossibility of questions employed. Furthermore, dealt with philosophy, history and political philosophy.
He published a work in which he compared [[Husserl]]'s theory of the sedimentation of the European sciences with Lukacs' concept of [[Reification (Marxism)|reification]].

More than eighty publications, they are mainly in Hungarian, English and German disclose to the public.

He is married with a son and a daughter.

==István Mészáros==

'''István Mészáros''' is a Hungarian [[Marxist]] philosopher, and [[Professor Emeritus]] at the [[University of Sussex]]. He held the Chair of Philosophy at Sussex for fifteen years and was earlier Professor of Philosophy and Social Science for four years at [[York University]].

He can be linked to the so-called "Budapest school", a group of Hungarian philosophers who were taught or influenced by Georg Lukács, including Ágnes Heller and György Márkus.

He left his native Hungary in 1956 after the [[Soviet invasion of Hungary|Soviet invasion]] and worked for a time in [[Turin]], [[Italy]] before settling in the [[UK]].

The '''Center for Biofilm Engineering''' ('''CBE''') is an interdisciplinary research, education, and technology transfer institution located on the central campus of [[Montana State University]] in [[Bozeman, Montana]]. The center was founded in April 1990 as the '''Center for Interfacial Microbial Process Engineering''' with a grant from the [[Engineering Research Centers]] (ERC) program of the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF).&lt;ref name=charter&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.biofilm.montana.edu/files/CBE/NSF-awd-lttr_CIMPEwb.pdf |title=Original Charter |publisher=National Science Foundation |date=April 15, 1990 |format=pdf |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CBE integrates faculty from multiple university departments to lead multidisciplinary research teams—including graduate and undergraduate students—to advance fundamental [[biofilm]] knowledge, develop beneficial uses for microbial biofilms, and find solutions to industrially relevant biofilm problems. The center tackles biofilm issues including [[chronic wounds]], [[bioremediation]], and [[microbial corrosion]] through cross-disciplinary research and education among [[engineers]], [[microbiologists]] and industry.&lt;ref name=Invade/&gt;&lt;ref name=CBEResearch/&gt;

==History==
The center originated as the Institute for Chemical and Biological Process Analysis (IPA) in 1983.&lt;ref name=CBE1990/&gt; In 1990, the center became a national ERC as the Center for Interfacial Microbial Process Engineering based on a $7.2 million grant from the NSF.&lt;ref name="Environment/Ecology Grants"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/11538/title/Science-Grants/ |title=Environment/Ecology Grants |journal=The Scientist |volume=4 |number=24 |page=25 |date=December 10, 1990 |accessdate=2015-02-27|quote=To establish new Center for Interfacial Microbial Process Engineering; work will focus on biofouling and biocorrosion, bioremediation, and biohydrometallurgy. $7.2 million from NSF to Montana State University, Bozeman. |publisher=LabX Media Group |location=Midland, Ontario, Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 the center assumed its current name-Center for Biofilm Engineering. The original grants expired in 2001 and the center became self-sufficient. The center celebrated its 25&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; anniversary as an NSF ERC in 2015.

===Institute for Chemical and Biological Process Analysis (1979–1990)===
In 1979 W.G. (Bill) Characklis came to Montana State University from [[Rice University]] as a professor in civil (environmental) and chemical engineering. He assembled a multidisciplinary team of [[engineer]]s, [[microbiologist]]s and [[chemist]]s to study the processes and effects of microbial growth at interfaces&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=InProcess |title=Center for Interfacial Microbial Process Engineering Newsletter |date=Fall 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; He established a cross-disciplinary environmental biotechnology institute to address the needs of industry in the areas of [[biofouling]], [[microbial corrosion]] and biofilm technology.&lt;ref name=CBE1990&gt;{{cite report |title=Report on Research 1990, Montana State University |pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute for Chemical and Biological Process Analysis (IPA) was chartered by the [[Montana University System|Montana Board of Regents]] in 1983 within the Montana State University College of Engineering. Bill Characklis was its first director. The IPA provided the foundation for eventual Engineering Research Center status in several ways. The IPA conducted fundamental research, development, and testing for industry and government agencies and it pursued biofilm projects that crossed traditional scientific discipline boundaries.&lt;ref name=news1983&gt;Brochure: "Montana State University introduces The Institute for Biological and Chemical Process Analysis." 1983&lt;/ref&gt; The IPA established an Industrial Associates membership program and by 1989 the program had 12 participating members, each contributing $10,000 annually to the center. Membership benefits provided them the opportunity to assist in critiquing and defining the IPA research programs. Members included oil/gas/power companies, a chemical manufacturer, a pulp and paper company and partnership with the [[Idaho National Engineering Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;Report: "Strategic Plan of the Institute for Biological and Chemical Process Analysis." February 1989, p 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Center for Interfacial Microbial Process Engineering (1990–1993)===
[[File:Confocal Microscopes Center for Biofilm Research MSU.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=photograph of microscope|Leica [[Confocal laser scanning microscopy|confocal microscope systems]]]]
In 1989, the IPA applied to the NSF for Engineering Research Center status, which was granted in April 1990.&lt;ref name=charter/&gt; The Center for Interfacial Microbial Process Engineering was established as one of three national Engineering Research Centers out of 48 applicants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title=Strategic Plan of the Institute for Biological and Chemical Process Analysis |date=February 1989 |page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an ERC, the new organization was charged with building a cross-disciplinary research and education program at Montana State University, as well as increasing U.S. industrial competitiveness in biofilm related technologies. The center's charter mandated that research, education, and technology transfer programs would be fully integrated within the center's program planning. The Industrial Associates program continued to be used as a mechanism for the center to get information from industry about significant biofilm-related problems and collaborate on center research initiatives designed to address biofilm issues. The center’s education program recruited students to participate on interdisciplinary research teams and to interact with industry representatives.&lt;ref name=CBE1990/&gt;

The provision of $7.2 million in grants from the NSF during the first five years enabled the expansion of center research into new areas, notably [[bioremediation]] and [[biohydrometallurgy]]. The center's industrial focus expanded from biofilm control and mitigation to include positive use of biofilm processes to break up soil and water contaminants as well as extracting minerals from low-grade ores.&lt;ref name=CBE1990/&gt; Center projects were designed to span scales of inquiry from fundamental bench-scale to applied field-scale experiments. These projects enabled the continued development of microsensors to measure gradients of gases and pH within biofilm communities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lewandowski Z, Lee W, Characklis WG, Little BJ | year = 1989 | title = Dissolved oxygen and pH microelectrode measurements at water-immersed metal surfaces | url = | journal = Corrosion Science | volume = 45 | issue = 2| pages = 92–98 | doi=10.5006/1.3577838}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[microscopy]] to elucidate physiological activity of community organisms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Wentland, Eric J.; Stewart, Philip S.; Huang, Ching-Tsan; McFeters, Gordon A. |title=Spatial variations in growth rate within Klebsiella pneumoniae colonies and biofilm |journal=Biotechnology Progress |date=1996 |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=316–321 |accessdate=2015-03-06 |publisher=American Institute of Chemical Engineers |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1021/bp9600243/abstract |doi=10.1021/bp9600243}}&lt;/ref&gt; and modeling to predict biofilm behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bit.260411005/abstract |authors=Jones, Warren L.; Dockery, Jack D.; Vogel, Curtis R.; Sturman, Paul J. |title=Diffusion and reaction within porous packing media: A phenomenological model |journal=Biotechnology and Bioengineering |date= April 25, 1993 |volume=41 |issue=10 |pages=947–956 |accessdate=2015-03-06 |publisher=Wiley Periodicals, Inc. |doi=10.1002/bit.260411005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Center for Biofilm Engineering (1993–present)===
In 1992, two years after its establishment, the center's first director, Bill Characklis, died. Montana State University signaled its commitment to the center by hiring J.W. (Bill) Costerton, a professor of microbiology from the [[University of Calgary]], as Executive Director and James Bryers, a professor of biochemical engineering from [[Duke University]], as Director of Research for the center. In 1993 the center’s name was changed to Center for Biofilm Engineering (CBE).&lt;ref&gt;Center for Biofilm Engineering News, 1993 April;1(1):1-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Costerton's direction the center continued to fulfill its charter and began expanding its scope of inquiry. Costerton encouraged exploration of the [[bioelectric]] effect,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Costerton J.William; Ellis, Brian; Lam, Kan; Johnson, Frank; Khoury, Antoine E. |title=Mechanism of the electrical enhancement of the efficacy of antibiotics in killing biofilm bacteria |journal=Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy |date=December 1994 |volume=38 |issue=12 |pages=2803–2809 |publisher=American Society for Microbiology |url=http://aac.asm.org/content/38/12/2803.full.pdf+html |accessdate=2015-02-28 |doi=10.1128/aac.38.12.2803|pmc=188289 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the phenomenon of cell-cell signaling and its relation to biofilm structure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Davies, D.G.; Geesey, G.G.|title=Regulation of the alginate biosynthesis gene algC in Pseudomonas aeruginosa during biofilm development in continuous culture |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC167351/pdf/610860.pdf |format=pdf |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology |date=March 1995 |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=860–7 |accessdate=2015-03-02 |publisher=American Society for Microbiology |pmc=167351 |pmid=7793920}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsurface biobarrier technologies to protect water and soils from mining contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=James, Garth A., Warwood, Bryan K.; Cunningham Alfred B.; Sturman, Paul J.; Hiebert, Randall; Costerton J.W. |url=http://www.engg.ksu.edu/HSRC/95Proceed/james.pdf |format=pdf |date=May 24, 1995 |title=Evaluation of subsurface biobarrier formation and persistence |journal=Proceedings of the 10th Annual Conference on Hazardous Waste Research, Manhattan, KS. |pages=82–91 |accessdate=2015-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industrial interest and membership grew in response to more diversified research topics.

===Self-sufficiency (2001–)===
The NSF ERC program was designed to create institutional centers that would be self-sufficient within ten years. The Center for Biofilm Engineering at Montana State University started planning for self-sufficiency in 1998 through the establishment of a Self-sufficiency Task Force at the university. The center achieved self-sufficiency in 2001 and continues to be funded in part through federal and private grants with continued emphasis on providing value to the Industrial Associates, and support from Montana State University and the [[Montana|State of Montana]].&lt;ref&gt;Center for Biofilm Engineering Final Report. February 2001. p15.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 Philip S. Stewart, a professor of chemical and biological engineering, was selected to be the third CBE Director. Stewart, who had participated as a CBE faculty member since 1991, was a leading expert on antimicrobials and biofilm control.&lt;ref name=deBeer&gt;{{cite journal|authors=de Beer, Dirk; Srinivasan, Rohini; and Stewart, Philip S. |title=Direct measurement of chlorine penetration into biofilms during disinfection |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology |date=December 1994 |volume=60 |number=12 |pages=4339–4344 |url=http://aem.asm.org/content/60/12/4339.full.pdf+html |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v426/n6964/full/nature02122.html |authors=Mah, Thien Fah; Pitts, Betsey; Pellock, Brett; Walker, Graham C.; Stewart, Philip S.; O’Toole, George A. |title=A genetic basis for Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm antibiotic resistance |journal=Nature |date=November 20, 2003 |volume=426 |issue=6964 |pages=306–310 |accessdate=2015-02-27 |doi=10.1038/nature02122 |pmid=14628055}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Walters, Marshall C.

====Undergraduate studies====
The Center for Biofilm Engineering's Undergraduate Research Experience (URE) was founded by Director J.W. (Bill) Costerton and Ryan Jordan in the late 1990s. PhD candidate (and subsequent Senior Research Engineer at the CBE)  Jordan directed the CBE's first URE students as part of a backcountry water quality program in Yellowstone National Park and the Bridger-Teton Wilderness where URE students under Jordan's direction became the first researchers to identify the role of biofilm in the failure of portable water treatment filters used in disaster relief, military, and outdoor recreation applications.

Undergraduate students are hired as undergraduate research assistants and work in CBE laboratories as members of research teams on interdisciplinary biofilm projects. CBE undergraduates are encouraged to acquire competence in laboratory skills, experimental design and group communication. By 2017, over 785 undergraduates from 11 disciplines had worked on laboratory biofilm projects under the direction of CBE-affiliated faculty members. Twenty-nine of 62 undergraduates (46%) in the 2016-17 academic year were female.&lt;ref name="2014AR"&gt;{{cite report |title=MSU Center for Biofilm Engineering 25 years and growing |date=2014 |pages=1–24 |url=http://www.biofilm.montana.edu/files/CBE/documents/2014_and_25-YrReport_CBE.pdf |format=pdf |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2014ARappx" /&gt;

====Graduate studies====
Graduate students pursue their degree in a discipline offered through one of the science, agriculture, or engineering departments at Montana State University while they conduct their research in CBE laboratories. Student graduate committees are typically interdisciplinary. The student and graduate committee members select coursework appropriate for the student’s interests and degree program. Engineering students are encouraged to take microbiology courses; science students are encouraged to take relevant engineering coursework. Graduate students acquire experience by designing and performing research that crosses traditional academic discipline boundaries and has direct impact on current environmental, industrial, and medical issues. Students work on projects that range from fundamental to applied topics. In addition, the CBE’s Industrial Associates program brings students into working relationships with potential employers. Graduate students are encouraged to develop their communication and leadership skills by presenting at research conferences, mentoring undergraduate students, organizing the CBE’s seminar series, and assisting with outreach efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CBE Graduate Education |url=http://www.biofilm.montana.edu/node/2184 |publisher=Montana State University |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 2017, 256 graduate students had received advanced degrees, including 30 with doctorate degrees and 22 with masters degrees . During the 2016-17 academic year 53% graduate students were female.&lt;ref name=2014AR/&gt;&lt;ref name=2014ARappx/&gt;

&lt;!--==Proposed DYK==
… that the '''[[Center for Biofilm Engineering]]''' at [[Montana State University|MSU]] uses interdisciplinary research &amp; education to tackle biofilm issues including [[chronic wounds]], [[bioremediation]], and [[microbial corrosion]]?--&gt;

&lt;!--Text of source for DYK Hook:

Biofiims were once considered chiefly a practical problem, the province of industrial engineers concerned about corroded pipes and fouled equipment. So in the 1980s, when William Characklis spoke about biofilms at microbiology conferences, the biologists he addressed were not a receptive audience: He was considered a "microbiologist who had fallen amongst engineers," recalls biofilm expert William Costerton. In reality, Characklis, who died an untimely death in 1992 at age 50, was a chemical engineering professor at Montana State University in Bozeman. But he had become convinced that a more biological perspective was needed to understand the puzzling nature of biofilms. Costerton and other biofilm leaders credit Characklis for almost single-handedly bridging biology and engineering, tirelessly crisscrossing the boundary between the two camps by training himself in microbiology, attending meetings, and teaching diverse graduate students. In 1990 Characklis won National Science Foundation (NSF) support to start an Engineering Research Center on biofilms at Montana State. Under his leadership, the center, then called the Center for Microbial Interfacial Process Engineering, drew students and faculty from engineering, science, mathematics, and agricultural departments. After Characklis's death, the center's name changed to the Center for Biofilm Engineering (CBE), but his interdisciplinary vision is thriving under the leadership of microbiologist Costerton. The center's original 5-year NSF grant was renewed in June, for $7.6 million for the next 5 years. One of the center's crucial jobs is to develop tools to study biofilms. For example, early researchers thought that the bacteria grew uniformly in a polysaccharide envelope, a view that stemmed from drying or treating biofilms before studying them. Then in 1991, researchers at the CBE and the University of Saskatchewan in Canada used confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM) to examine successive planes in living biofilms in real time. CSLM 
clearly showed that biofilm bacteria grow as remarkably complex microcolonies, crisscrossed by water channels that comprise up to 60% of the biofilm's volume. CBE scientists, led by Zbigniew Lewandow- ski, are now further refining this method with new probes and software for mapping interactions among bacteria. Today the CBE is a haven of interdisciplinary work, with graduate students from 10 departments working in interdisciplinary teams. Engineering students clone genes, microbiologists construct mathematical models, and mathematicians letnm biochemistrv. all to solve real-world problems. "The center has evolved a system that works," says Costerton, who thinks the key to success is the interdisciplinary research teams. A microbiologist may help an engineer do taxonomic mapping of a mixed-species biofilm, then the engineer might help the microbiologist scan the surface of a medical device with a scanning vibrating electrode to measure the extent of biofilm- induced corrosion. Another part of the CBE's mission is to advance industrial competitiveness, by transferring technology to industrial associates such as oil companies or municipal water districts. Microbiologist Rod Donlan of Calgon Corp. in Pittsburgh, for example, has used the center's expertise to find chemical disinfectants that can kill biofilms in industrial water systems. He adopted a CBE- developed staining technique to identify the kinds of bacteria and their metabolic activity inside a biofilm, and this helps him deter- mine which bacteria are harmed by disinfectants. "That's why we're part of the center-because they do basic research that helps us develop new applications," he says. And it's clear that Characklis's cross-disciplinary spirit lives on. During a recent NSF site review, an eminent microbiologist was convinced that two students presenting a project about biofilms degrading trichloroethylene were microbiologists. "They were, in fact, both engineers," says Costerton. -CP--&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4362">The '''''chreia''''' or '''''chria''''' ({{lang-el|[[wikt:χρεία#Ancient Greek|χρεία]]}}) was, in [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]] and the [[Byzantine Empire]], both a genre of literature and one of the [[progymnasmata]].

==Definition==

A chreia was a brief, useful (χρεία means "use") anecdote about a particular character.  That is, a chreia was shorter than a narration—often as short as a single sentence—but unlike a maxim, it was attributed to a character.  Usually it conformed to one of a few patterns, the most common being "On seeing..." (ιδών or ''cum vidisset''), "On being asked..." (ἐρωτηθείς or ''interrogatus''), and "He said..." (ἔφη or ''dixit'').&lt;ref&gt;On the meaning of ''chria'' cf. Quintilian, ''Institutio oratoria'' 1,9,4. and Seneca, ''Epistulae morales'' 33,7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

The following chreia, the most common in ancient sources, is illustrative:

{{Quotation|[[Diogenes of Sinope|Diogenes]], on seeing a youth misbehaving, struck his [[pedagogy|paedagogus]], adding "Why do you teach such things?"}}

Chreiai could be silly:

{{Quotation|[[Olympias]], on hearing that her son [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] was proclaiming himself the offspring of Zeus, said "Won't this fellow stop slandering me to Hera?"}}

Or solemn:

{{Quotation|A [[Sparta|Laconian]], who had become a prisoner of war and was being sold, on being asked by someone what he could do, said, "Be free."}}

Wise:

{{Quotation|[[Aristeides]], on being asked what justice is, said: "Not desiring the possessions of others."}}

Or witty:

{{Quotation|Diogenes, on being asked why people give to beggars but not to philosophers, said: "Because they suppose they might become lame and blind but they never suppose they might take up philosophy."}}

Or all of these:

{{Quotation|[[Socrates]] the philosopher, when a certain student named Apollodorus said to him, "The Athenians have unjustly condemned you to death," said with a laugh, "But did you want them to do it justly?"}}

As a literary genre the chreia was a subject of collection. Scholars such as [[Plutarch]] or [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] kept their own private collections of chreiai.  Published collections were also available.  The chreia is primarily known, however, for its role in education.  Students were introduced to simple chreiai almost as soon as they could read.  Later they practiced the complex grammar of Greek by putting these chreiai through changes of [[voice (grammar)|voice]] and [[grammatical tense|tense]].  As one of the last stages in their preparation for rhetoric—this is where chreiai serve as one of the progymnasmata—they would elaborate the theme of a chreiai into a formal eight-paragraph essay.  The student would praise, paraphrase, explain, contrast, compare, provide an example, make a judgment, and, in conclusion, exhort the reader.

Chreiai are also common in the [[New Testament]], mainly in the [[Gospel]]s. An example is in Mark 13: 1-2:

{{Quotation|And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here! And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down (King James Version.)}}

The famous passage in Luke 20: 21-25 also has the typical structure of a chreia, though its length is somewhat unusual:

{{Quotation|And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person of any, but teachest the way of God truly: Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or no? But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why tempt ye me? Shew me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it? They answered and said, Caesar's. And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's, and unto God the things which be God's. (King James Version.)}}

'''Conservation photography''' is the active use of the [[photographic process]] and its products, within the parameters of [[photojournalism]], to [[advocate]] for [[Conservation biology|conservation]] outcomes.

Conservation photography combines [[nature photography]] with the proactive, issue-oriented approach of [[documentary photography]] as an agent for protecting [[nature]] and improving the [[biosphere]] and [[natural environment]]. Conservation Photography furthers [[environmental conservation]], [[wildlife conservation]], [[habitat conservation]] or cultural conservation by expanding public awareness of issues and stimulating remedial action.

==History==
[[File:Carleton E. Watkins - Mt. Broderick, Nevada Fall - SFM.95.98 01 d02.jpg|thumb|Photo by [[Carleton Watkins|Carleton E. Watkins]] (1829–1916) of Mt. Broderick and Nevada Fall (700 ft.) at Yosemite Valley in 1861]]
[[File:Ansel Adams-Half Dome, Apple Orchard, Yosemite.jpg|thumb|Photo by [[Ansel Adams]] of Yosemite Half Dome, Apple Orchard, trees with snow on branches in April 1933]]
Photography has developed as a powerful medium to empower conservation. Photography has served this role since the 1860s, although not widely acknowledged as such.&lt;ref name=" "&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A notable example are the powerful images of [[Carleton Watkins]] which were successfully used to stimulate the establishment of [[Yosemite National Park]] in 1864 and [[William Henry Jackson]] and [[Ansel Adams]] who advocated for expansion and continued funding of the park.

Renewed emphasis on photography-for-conservation arose at the beginning of the 21st century, primarily in response to the human-caused [[environmental crisis]], recognizing that the global pattern of [[ecosystem]] degradation was not sustainable.

The modern field of conservation photography was formalized in October 2005 with the founding of the [[International League of Conservation Photographers]] by photographer [[Cristina Mittermeier]], during the 8th [[World Wilderness Congress]] in [[Anchorage, Alaska]]. Prior to 2005 "conservation photography" was not widely recognized as a discipline.

Conservation and photography appear as two distinct fields, but their combined impact can be profound. Simply put, conservation photography is photography that empowers or enables conservation.

According to the acclaimed photographer, [[Joel Sartore]], “the typical nature photograph shows a butterfly on a pretty flower. The conservation photograph shows the same thing, but with a bulldozer coming at it in the background. This doesn’t mean there’s no room for beautiful pictures, in fact we need beautiful images just as much as the issues. It does mean that the images exist for a reason; to save the Earth while we still can.”

The serious conservation photographer brings to their work a deep empathy for the natural world. Proper use of the resulting images has the power to bring about positive change.

Conservation photographs fall into two broad categories, both of which are equally valuable:

*The snapshot: upon seeing a striking scene one pulls out a cell phone or point-and-shoot camera, and snaps some quick framed pictures without expending too much time or effort.
*The carefully crafted image:: One sees the same scene, but instead of quickly shooting it and moving on, they take a series of skillfully crafted, high-quality images that tell the story in a more powerful way. Dramatic framing enhances the influence of a picture.

Such photographs have a stronger impact on the audience. One may also proactively seek opportunities to take crafted conservation pictures. Determined effort can result in excellent photo stories that can move people’s hearts and minds.&lt;ref name="CI"/&gt;

==Applications==
[[File:Gp-esso.jpg|thumb|Photo of [[Greenpeace]] protest against [[Esso]] /[[ExxonMobil in 2003]]]]
[[File:2011 flooding in Ayutthaya Province-EO-1 merged.jpg|thumb|True-colour [[satellite image]] showing [[flood]]ing in Ayutthaya and Pathum Thani Provinces in Central [[Thailand]] (right), compared to before the flooding (left) in 2011]]
In order to create an impact, conservation pictures should be put to work for specific causes. Though not every picture may find an immediate use, a carefully catalogued archive of conservation pictures can help increase impact of conservation related news stories, provide material for public awareness campaigns, including [[internet activism]] and sometimes serve as [[Investigative journalism]] evidence in court proceedings. Images of habitat destruction, especially in [[protected area]]s, can be important as legal evidence against the activity.

==Organizations==
There are many [[environmental organization]]s that effectively use conservation photography to help advocate their goals. Just a few are:


*[[ARKive]] is a global initiative with the mission of "promoting the conservation of the world's threatened species, through the power of wildlife imagery", which it does by locating and gathering films, photographs and audio recordings of the world's [[species]] into a centralised [[Digital data|digital]] [[archive]]. Its current priority is the completion of audio-visual profiles for the c. 17,000 species on the [[IUCN Red List]] of [[threatened species]].&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arkive.org/about/|title=About ARKive|work=ARKive|accessdate=12 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Sanctuary Asia]] is [[India]]'s first and one of its leading [[Environmentalism|environmental]] [[news magazine]]s. It was founded in 1981 to raise awareness among [[Indian people]] of their disappearing [[natural heritage]]. The magazine is attractively packaged&lt;ref&gt;Various authors, India, pp. 76; [[Lonely Planet]] Publications, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; with colored photographs. The ''Sanctuary Photo Library''' is a melting pot of natural history visuals, information and resources used to produce some of the finest wildlife and nature calendars, posters, slide shows, exhibitions and other products available in India.
*[[Sierra club]] maintains a publishing imprint, [[Sierra Club Books]], publishing books on environmental issues, wilderness photographic essays, nature guides, and other related subjects.

'''CADP'''&lt;ref&gt;Garavel H, Lang F, Mateescu R, Serwe W: [http://vasy.inria.fr/publications/Garavel-Lang-Mateescu-Serwe-13.html ''CADP 2011: A Toolbox for the Construction and Analysis of Distributed Processes''] International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer (STTT), 15(2):89-107, April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; (Construction and Analysis of Distributed Processes) is a toolbox for the design of communication protocols and distributed systems. CADP  is developed by the CONVECS team (formerly by the VASY team) at [[INRIA]] Rhone-Alpes and connected to various complementary tools. CADP is maintained, regularly improved, and used in many industrial projects.

The purpose of the CADP toolkit is to facilitate the design of reliable systems by use of formal description techniques together with software tools for simulation, [[rapid application development]], verification, and test generation.

CADP can be applied to any system that comprises asynchronous concurrency, i.e., any system whose behavior can be modeled as a set of parallel processes governed by interleaving semantics. Therefore, CADP can be used to design hardware architecture, distributed algorithms, telecommunications protocols, etc.
The enumerative verification (also known as explicit state verification) techniques implemented in CADP, though less general that theorem proving, enable an automatic, cost-efficient detection of design errors in complex systems.

CADP includes tools to support use of two approaches in formal methods, both of which are needed for reliable systems design:

* Models provide mathematical representations for parallel programs and related verification problems. Examples of models are automata, networks of communicating automata, Petri nets, binary decision diagrams, boolean equation systems, etc. From a theoretical point of view, research on models seeks for general results, independent of any particular description language.
* In practice, models are often too elementary to describe complex systems directly (this would be tedious and error-prone). A higher level formalism known as [[process algebra]] or [[process calculus]] is needed for this task, as well as compilers that translate high-level descriptions into models suitable for verification algorithms.

==History==

Work began on CADP in 1986, when the development of the first two tools, CAESAR and ALDEBARAN, was undertaken. In 1989, the CADP acronym was coined, which stood for ''CAESAR/ALDEBARAN Distribution Package''. Over time, several tools were added, including programming interfaces that enabled tools to be contributed: the CADP acronym then became the ''CAESAR/ALDEBARAN Development Package''. Currently CADP contains over 50 tools. While keeping the same acronym, the name of the toolbox has been changed to better indicate its purpose:
''Construction and Analysis of Distributed Processes''.

===Major releases===

==CADP features==

CADP offers a wide set of functionalities, ranging from step-by-step simulation to massively parallel [[model checking]]. It includes:
* Compilers for several input formalisms:
** High-level protocol descriptions written in the ISO language [[Language Of Temporal Ordering Specification|LOTOS]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Language Of Temporal Ordering Specification|ISO 8807, Language of Temporal Ordering Specification]]&lt;/ref&gt; The toolbox contains two compilers (CAESAR and CAESAR.ADT) that translate LOTOS descriptions into C code to be used for simulation, verification, and testing purposes.
** Low-level protocol descriptions specified as finite state machines.
** Networks of communicating automata, i.e., finite state machines running in parallel and synchronized (either using process algebra operators or synchronization vectors).
* Several [[equivalence checking]] tools (minimization and comparisons modulo bisimulation relations), such as BCG_MIN and BISIMULATOR.
* Several model-checkers for various temporal logic and mu-calculus, such as EVALUATOR and XTL.
* Several verification algorithms combined: enumerative verification, on-the-fly verification, symbolic verification using binary decision diagrams, compositional minimization, partial orders, distributed model checking, etc.
* Plus other tools with advanced functionalities such as [[visual checking]], performance evaluation, etc.

CADP is designed in a modular way and puts the emphasis on intermediate formats and programming interfaces (such as the BCG and OPEN/CAESAR software environments), which allow the CADP tools to be combined with other tools and adapted to various specification languages.

===Models and verification techniques===
Verification is comparison of a complex system against a set of properties characterizing the intended functioning of the system (for instance, deadlock freedom, mutual exclusion, fairness, etc.).

Most of the verification algorithms in CADP are based on the labeled transition systems (or, simply, automata or graphs) model, which consists of a set of states, an initial state, and a transition relation between states. This model is often generated automatically from high level descriptions of the system under study, then compared against the system properties using various decision procedures. Depending on the formalism used to express the properties, two approaches are possible:
* Behavioral properties express the intended functioning of the system in the form of automata (or higher level descriptions, which are then translated into automata). In such a case, the natural approach to verification is [[equivalence checking]], which consists in comparing the system model and its properties (both represented as automata) modulo some equivalence or preorder relation. CADP contains equivalence checking tools that compare and minimize automata modulo various equivalence and preorder relations; some of these tools also apply to stochastic and probabilistic models (such as Markov chains). CADP also contains [[visual checking]] tools that can be used to verify a graphical representation of the system.
* Logical properties express the intended functioning of the system in the form of temporal logic formulas. In such a case, the natural approach to verification is [[model checking]], which consists of deciding whether or not the system model satisfies the logical properties. CADP contains model checking tools for a powerful form of temporal logic, the modal mu-calculus, which is extended with typed variables and expressions so as to express predicates over the data contained in the model. This extension provides for properties that could not be expressed in the standard mu-calculus (for instance, the fact that the value of a given variable is always increasing along any execution path).

Although these techniques are efficient and automated, their main limitation is the state explosion problem, which occurs when models are too large to fit in computer memory. CADP provides software technologies for handling models in two complementary ways:
* Small models can be represented explicitly, by storing in memory all their states and transitions (exhaustive verification);
* Larger models are represented implicitly, by exploring only the model states and transitions needed for the verification (on the fly verification).

===Languages and compilation techniques===
Accurate specification of reliable, complex systems requires a language that is executable (for enumerative verification) and has formal semantics (to avoid any as language ambiguities that could lead to interpretation divergences between designers and implementors). Formal semantics are also required when it is necessary to establish the correctness of an infinite system; this cannot be done using enumerative techniques because they deal only with finite abstractions, so must be done using theorem proving techniques, which only apply to languages with a formal semantics.

CADP acts on a [[Language Of Temporal Ordering Specification|LOTOS]] description of the system. LOTOS is an international standard for protocol description (ISO/IEC standard 8807:1989), which combines the concepts of process algebras (in particular [[Calculus of communicating systems|CCS]] and [[Communicating sequential processes|CSP]] and algebraic abstract data types. Thus, LOTOS can describe both asynchronous concurrent processes and complex data structures.

LOTOS was heavily revised in 2001, leading to the publication of E-LOTOS (Enhanced-Lotos, ISO/IEC standard 15437:2001), which tries to provide a greater expressiveness (for instance, by introducing quantitative time to describe systems with real-time constraints) together with a better user friendliness.

Several tools exist to convert descriptions in other process calculi or intermediate format into LOTOS, so that the CADP tools can then be used for verification.

==Tools summary==

The toolbox contains several tools:
* CAESAR.ADT&lt;ref&gt;H. Garavel. ''Compilation of LOTOS Abstract Data Types'', in ''Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Formal Description Techniques FORTE'89'' (Vancouver B.C., Canada), S. T. Vuong (editor), North-Holland, December 1989, p. 147–162.&lt;/ref&gt; is a compiler that translates [[Language Of Temporal Ordering Specification|LOTOS]] abstract data types into C types and C functions. The translation involves pattern-matching compiling techniques and automatic recognition of usual types (integers, enumerations, tuples, etc.), which are implemented optimally.
* CAESAR&lt;ref&gt;H. Garavel, J. Sifakis. ''Compilation and Verification of LOTOS Specifications'', in ''Proceedings of the 10th International Symposium on Protocol Specification, Testing and Verification'' (Ottawa, Canada), L. Logrippo, R. L. Probert, H. Ural (editors), North-Holland, IFIP, June 1990, p. 379–394.&lt;/ref&gt; is a compiler that translates LOTOS processes into either C code (for rapid prototyping and testing purposes) or finite graphs (for verification). The translation is done using several intermediate steps, among which the construction of a Petri net extended with typed variables, data handling features, and atomic transitions.
* OPEN/CAESAR&lt;ref&gt;H. Garavel. ''OPEN/CÆSAR: An Open Software Architecture for Verification, Simulation, and Testing'', in Proceedings of the First International Conference on Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems TACAS'98 (Lisbon, Portugal), Berlin, B. Steffen (editor), Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Full version available as [http://hal.inria.fr/inria-00073337 Inria Research Report RR-3352], Springer Verlag, March 1998, vol. 1384, p. 68–84.&lt;/ref&gt; is a generic software environment for developing tools that explore graphs on the fly (for instance, simulation, verification, and test generation tools). Such tools can be developed independently of any particular high level language. In this respect, OPEN/CAESAR plays a central role in CADP by connecting language-oriented tools with model-oriented tools. OPEN/CAESAR consists of a set of 16 code libraries with their programming interfaces, such as:
** Caesar_Hash, which contains several hash functions
** Caesar_Solve, which resolves boolean equation systems on the fly
** Caesar_Stack, which implements stacks for depth-first search exploration
** Caesar_Table, which handles tables of states, transitions, labels, etc.

A number of tools have been developed within the OPEN/CAESAR environment:
** BISIMULATOR, which checks bisimulation equivalences and preorders
** CUNCTATOR, which performs on-the-fly steady state simulation
** DETERMINATOR, which eliminates stochastic nondeterminism in normal, probabilistic, or stochastic systems
** DISTRIBUTOR, which generates the graph of reachable states using several machines
** EVALUATOR, which evaluates regular alternation-free mu-calculus formulas
** EXECUTOR, which performs random execution of code
** EXHIBITOR, which searches for execution sequences matching a given regular expression
** GENERATOR, which constructs the graph of reachable states
** PREDICTOR, which predict the feasibility of reachability analysis,
** PROJECTOR, which computes abstractions of communicating systems
** REDUCTOR, which constructs and minimizes the graph of reachable states modulo various equivalence relations
** SIMULATOR, X-SIMULATOR and OCIS, which allow interactive simulation
** TERMINATOR, which searches for deadlock states
* BCG (Binary Coded Graphs) is both a file format for storing very large graphs on disk (using efficient compression techniques) and a software environment for handling this format, including partitioning graphs for distributed processing. BCG also plays a key role in CADP as many tools rely on this format for their inputs/outputs. The BCG environment consists of various libraries with their programming interfaces, and of several tools, including:
** BCG_DRAW, which builds a two-dimensional view of a graph,
** BCG_EDIT which allows to modify interactively the graph layout produced by Bcg_Draw
** BCG_GRAPH, which generates various forms of practically useful graphs
** BCG_INFO, which displays various statistical information about a graph
** BCG_IO, which performs conversions between BCG and many other graph formats
** BCG_LABELS, which hides and/or renames (using regular expressions) the transition labels of a graph
** BCG_MERGE, which gathers graph fragments obtained from distributed graph construction
** BCG_MIN, which minimizes a graph modulo strong or branching equivalences (and can also deal with probabilistic and stochastic systems)
** BCG_STEADY, which performs steady-state numerical analysis of (extended) continuous-time Markov chains
** BCG_TRANSIENT, which performs transient numerical analysis of (extended) continuous-time Markov chains
** PBG_CP, which copies a partitioned BCG graph
** PBG_INFO, which displays information about a partitioned BCG graph
** PBG_MV which moves a partitioned BCG graph
** PBG_RM, which removes a partitioned BCG graph
** XTL (eXecutable Temporal Language), which is a high level, functional language for programming exploration algorithms on BCG graphs. XTL provides primitives to handle states, transitions, labels, successor and predecessor functions, etc. For instance, one can define recursive functions on sets of states, which allow to specify in XTL evaluation and diagnostic generation fixed point algorithms for usual temporal logics (such as HML,&lt;ref&gt;M. Hennessy, R. Milner. ''Algebraic Laws for Nondeterminism and Concurrency'', in: ''Journal of the ACM'', 1985, vol. 32, p. 137–161.&lt;/ref&gt; CTL,&lt;ref&gt;E. M. Clarke, E. A. Emerson, A. P. Sistla. ''Automatic Verification of Finite-State Concurrent Systems using Temporal Logic Specifications'', in: ''ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems'', April 1986, vol. 8, no 2, p. 244–263.&lt;/ref&gt; ACTL,&lt;ref&gt;R. De Nicola, F. W. Vaandrager. ''Action versus State Based Logics for Transition Systems'', ''Lecture Notes in Computer Science'', Springer Verlag, 1990, vol. 469, p. 407–419.&lt;/ref&gt; etc.).

The connection between explicit models (such as BCG graphs) and implicit models (explored on the fly) is ensured by OPEN/CAESAR-compliant compilers including:
** CAESAR.OPEN, for models expressed as LOTOS descriptions
** BCG.OPEN, for models represented as BCG graphs
** EXP.OPEN, for models expressed as communicating automata
** FSP.OPEN, for models expressed as FSP descriptions
** LNT.OPEN, for models expressed as LNT descriptions
** SEQ.OPEN, for models represented as sets of execution traces

The CADP toolbox also includes additional tools, such as ALDEBARAN and TGV (Test Generation based on Verification) developed by the Verimag laboratory (Grenoble) and the Vertecs project-team of INRIA Rennes.

The CADP tools are well-integrated and can be accessed easily using either the EUCALYPTUS graphical interface or the SVL&lt;ref&gt;H. Garavel, F. Lang.
''SVL: a Scripting Language for Compositional Verification'', in: ''Proceedings of the 21st IFIP WG 6.1 International Conference on Formal Techniques for Networked and Distributed Systems FORTE'2001'' (Cheju Island, Korea), M. Kim, B. Chin, S. Kang, D. Lee (editors), Full version available as [http://hal.inria.fr/inria-00072396 Inria Research Report RR-4223], Kluwer Academic Publishers, IFIP, August 2001, p. 377–392.&lt;/ref&gt; scripting language. Both EUCALYPTUS and SVL provide users with an easy, uniform access to the CADP tools by performing file format conversions automatically whenever needed and by supplying appropriate command-line options as the tools are invoked.

The '''day–evening–night noise level''' or '''L{{sub|den}}''' is a 2002 [[European Union|European]] standard to express noise level over an entire day. It is calculated as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32002L0049&amp;from=EN|title=Directive 2002/49/EC|date=25 June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;L_{den} = 10 \cdot log_{10} \left(\frac{1}{24} \left(12\cdot 10 ^ \frac{L_{day}}{10} + 4\cdot 10 ^\frac{L_{evening} + 5}{10} + 8\cdot 10 ^\frac{L_{night} + 10}{10}\right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;

'''Ecological genetics''' is the study of [[genetics]] in natural populations.

This contrasts with [[classical genetics]], which works mostly on crosses between laboratory strains, and [[DNA]] [[sequence analysis]], which studies genes at the molecular level.

Research in this field is on [[Phenotypic trait|traits]] of ecological significance—that is, traits related to [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]], which affect an organism's survival and reproduction. Examples might be: flowering time, [[drought]] tolerance, [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]], [[mimicry]], avoidance of attacks by [[predator]]s.

Research usually involves a mixture of field and laboratory studies.&lt;ref&gt;Ford E.B. 1981. ''Taking genetics into the countryside''. Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Samples of natural populations may be taken back to the laboratory for their genetic variation to be analysed. Changes in the populations at different times and places will be noted, and the pattern of [[death|mortality]] in these populations will be studied. Research is often done on [[insect]]s and other organisms that have short generation times.

== History ==
Although work on natural populations had been done previously, it is acknowledged that the field was founded by the [[United Kingdom|English]] biologist [[Edmund Brisco Ford|E.B. Ford]] (1901–1988) in the early 20th century. Ford was taught genetics at [[Oxford University]] by [[Julian Huxley]], and started research on the genetics of natural populations in 1924. Ford also had a long working relationship with [[R.A. Fisher]]. By the time Ford had developed his formal definition of [[genetic polymorphism]],&lt;ref name ="New systematics"&gt;Ford E.B. 1940. Polymorphism and taxonomy. In Huxley J. ''The new systematics''. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ford E.B. 1965. ''Genetic polymorphism''. All Souls Studies, Faber &amp; Faber, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Fisher had got accustomed to high [[natural selection]] values in nature. This was one of the main outcomes of research on natural populations. Ford's magnum opus was ''Ecological genetics'', which ran to four editions and was widely influential.&lt;ref name=Henry&gt;Ford E.B. 1975. ''Ecological genetics'', 4th ed. Chapman and Hall, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable ecological geneticists would include [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]] who worked on [[chromosome]] [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]] in [[Drosophila|fruit flies]]. As a young researcher in Russia, Dobzhansky had been influenced by [[Sergei Chetverikov]], who also deserves to be remembered as a founder of genetics in the field, though his significance was not appreciated until much later. Dobzhansky and colleagues carried out studies on natural populations of ''Drosophila'' species in western USA and Mexico over many years.&lt;ref&gt;Dobzhansky, Theodosius. ''Genetics and the origin of species''. Columbia, N.Y. 1st ed 1937; second ed 1941; 3rd ed 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dobzhansky, Theodosius 1970. ''Genetics of the evolutionary process''. Columbia, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dobzhansky, Theodosius 1981. ''Dobzhansky's genetics of natural populations I-XLIII''. R.C. Lewontin, J.A. Moore, W.B. Provine &amp; B. Wallace, eds. Columbia University Press, New York 1981. (reprints the 43 papers in this series, all but two of which were authored or co-authored by Dobzhansky)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philip Sheppard]], [[Cyril Clarke]], [[Bernard Kettlewell]] and [[A.J. Cain]] were all strongly influenced by Ford; their careers date from the post World War II era. Collectively, their work on [[lepidoptera]], and on human [[blood groups]], established the field, and threw light on selection in natural populations where its role had been once doubted.

Work of this kind needs long-term funding, as well as grounding in both ecology and genetics. These are both difficult requirements. Research projects can last longer than a researcher's career; for instance, research into [[mimicry]] started 150 years ago, and is still going strongly.&lt;ref&gt;Mallet J. and Joron M. 1999. Evolution in diversity in warning color and mimicry: polymorphisms, shifting balance and speciation. ''Annual Review of Ecological Systematics'' 1999. '''30''' 201–233&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruxton G.D. Sherratt T.N. and Speed M.P. 2004. ''Avoiding attack: the evolutionary ecology of crypsis, warning signals &amp; mimicry''. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Funding of this type of research is still rather erratic, but at least the value of working with natural populations in the field cannot now be doubted.

'''Forensic geophysics''' is a branch of [[forensic science]] and is the study, the search, the localization and the mapping of buried objects or elements beneath the soil or the water, using [[geophysics]] tools for legal purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year=2012 |last1=Pringle |first1=JK |last2=Ruffell |first2=A |last3=Jervis |first3=JR |last4=Donnelly |first4=L |last5=McKinley |first5=J |last6=Hansen |first6=J |last7=Morgan |first7=R |last8=Pirrie |first8=D |last9=Harrison |first9=M |title=The use of geoscience methods for terrestrial forensic searches |volume=114 |pages=108–123|journal=Earth-Science Reviews|bibcode = 2012ESRv..114..108P |doi = 10.1016/j.earscirev.2012.05.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are various geophysical techniques for forensic investigations in which the targets are buried and have different dimensions (from weapons or metallic barrels to human burials and bunkers). Geophysical methods have the potential to aid the search and the recovery of these targets because they can non-destructively and rapidly investigate large areas where a suspect, illegal burial or, in general, a forensic target is hidden in the [[subsoil]]. When in the subsurface there is a contrast of physical properties between a target and the material in which it is buried, it is possible to individuate and define precisely the concealing place of the searched target. It is also possible to recognize evidences of human soil occupation or excavation, both recent and older. Forensic geophysics is an evolving technique that is gaining popularity and prestige in [[law enforcement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1177/1043986211405885 |year=2011 |last1=Larson |first1=DO |last2=Vass |first2=AA |last3=Wise |first3=M |title=Advanced Scientific Methods and Procedures in the Forensic Investigation of Clandestine Graves |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=149–182 |journal=Journal of Contemporary Criminal Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Searched for objects obviously include clandestine graves of murder victims, but also include unmarked burials in graveyards and cemeteries, weapons used in criminal activities and environmental crime illegally dumping material.

There are various near-surface geophysical techniques that can be utilised to detect a near-surface buried object, which should be site and case-specific. A thorough desk study (including historical maps), utility survey, site reconnaissance and control studies should be undertaken before trial geophysical surveys and then full geophysical surveys are undertaken in phased investigations. Note also other search techniques should be used to first to prioritise suspect areas, for example [[Search and rescue dog#Human remains detection|cadaver dogs]] or forensic geomorphologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=2014 |last1=Ruffell |first1=A |last2=McKinley |first2=J |title=Forensic geomorphology |volume=206 |pages=14–22| journal=Geomorphology |bibcode = 2014Geomo.206...14R |doi = 10.1016/j.geomorph.2013.12.020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==

For large-scale buried objects, [[seismic]] surveys may be appropriate but these have, at best, 2m vertical resolution so may not be ideal for certain targets, more typically they are used to detect bedrock below the surface (see.&lt;ref name=Reynolds&gt;{{cite book |last=Reynolds|first= JR |title=An Introduction to Applied and Environmental Geophysics, 2nd Edition|publisher=Wiley|date=2011|isbn=978-0-471-48535-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For relatively quick site surveys, bulk ground [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|electrical conductivity]] surveys can be collected which identifies areas of disturbance of different ground but these can suffer from a lack of resolution. This recent Black Death investigation in central London&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.jas.2015.04.010 |year=2015 |last1=Dick |first1=HC |last2=Pringle |first2=JK |last3=Sloane |first3=B |last4=Carver |first4=J |last5=Wisneiwski |first5=KD |last6=Haffenden |first6=A |last7=Porter |first7=S |last8=Roberts |first8=D |last9=Cassidy |first9=NJ |title=Detection and characterisation of Black Death burials by multi-proxy geophysical methods |volume=59 |pages=132–141| journal=Journal of Archaeological Science }}&lt;/ref&gt; shows an example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid=10855986 |year=2000 |last1=Nobes |first1=D |title=The Search for "Yvonne": A Case Example of the Delineation of a Grave Using Near-Surface Geophysical Methods |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages=715–721| journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences }}&lt;/ref&gt; shows a successful woodland search for a cold case in woodland in New Zealand.

[[Ground-penetrating radar]] (or GPR) has a typical maximum depth below ground level (bgl) of 10 m, depending upon the antennae frequencies used, typically 50&amp;nbsp;MHz to 1.2 Gz. The higher the frequency the smaller the object that can be resolved but also penetration depths decrease, so operators need to think carefully when choosing antennae frequencies and, ideally, undertake trial surveys using different antennae over a target at a known depth onsite. GPR is the most popularly used technique in forensic search, but is not suitable in certain soil types and environments, e.g. coastal (i.e. salt-rich) and clay-rich soils (lack of penetration). 2D profiles can be relatively quickly collected and, if time permits, successive profiles can be used to generate 3D datasets which may resolve more subtle targets (see &lt;ref name="Reynolds"/&gt;). Recent studies have used GPR to locate mass graves from the Spanish Civil War in mountainous &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2016.05.040 | year=2016 |last1=Fernandez-Alvarez |first1=J-P |title=Discovery of a mass grave from the Spanish Civil War using Ground Penetrating Radar and forensic archaeology |volume=267 |issue=10 |pages=e10-e17| journal=Forensic Science International }}&lt;/ref&gt; and urban &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2018.03.034 | year=2018 |last1=Fernandez-Alvarez |first1=J-P |title=GPR and ERT detection and characterization of a mass burial, Spanish Civil War, Northern Spain |volume=287 |pages=e1-e9| journal=Forensic Science International }}&lt;/ref&gt; environments.

Electrical resistivity methods can also detect objects, especially in clay-rich soil which would preclude the use of GPR. There are different equipment configurations, the dipole-dipole (fixed-offset) method is the most common which can traverse across an area, measuring resistivity variations at a set depth (typically 1-2x probe separations) which have been used in forensic searches. More slower methods are putting out many probes and collecting both spatially horizontally and vertically, called [[Electrical resistivity imaging]] (ERI). Multiple 2D profiles is termed [[electrical resistivity tomography]] (ERT).&lt;ref name=pye&gt;{{cite book |last=Pye|first= Kenneth|author2=D.J. Croft|title=Forensic geoscience: principles, techniques and applications|publisher=Geological Society of London|date=2004|isbn=1-86239-161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Magnetometry]] can detect buried metal (or indeed fired objects such as bricks or even where surface fires were) using simple total field magnetometers, through to fluxgate gradiometers and high-end alkali vapour gradiometers, depending upon accuracy (and cost) required (see &lt;ref name="Reynolds"/&gt;). Surface magnetic susceptibility has also shown recent promise for forensic search.

Water-based searches are also becoming more common,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.earscirev.2017.04.012 | year=2017 |last1=Ruffell |first1=A |last2=Pringle |first2=JK |last3=Cassella |first3=JP |last4=Morgan |first4=RM |last5=Ferguson |first5=M |last6=Heaton |first6=V |last7=Hope |first7=C | last8=McKinley |first8=J | title=The use of geoscience methods for aquatic forensic searches | journal=Earth-Science Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt; with specialist marine magnetometers, side-scan sonar&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2013.05.032 |year=2013 |last1=Schultz |first1=JJ |last2=Healy |first2=CA |last3=Parker |first3=K |last4=Lowers |first4=B|title=Detecting submerged objects: The application of side scan sonar to forensic contexts |volume=231 |pages=306–316| journal=Forensic Science International |pmid=23890654}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other acoustic methods and even water-penetrating radar&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/S1355-0306(06)71602-1 |year=2009 |last1=Ruffell |first1=A |title=Under-water Scene Investigation Using Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) in the Search for a Sunken Jet ski, Northern Ireland |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=221–230| journal=Science &amp; Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt; methods used to rapidly scan bottoms of ponds, lakes, rivers and near-shore depositional environments.

==Controlled research==
There has been recent efforts to undertake research over known buried and below-water surface simulated forensic targets in order to gain an insight into optimum search technique(s) and/or equipment configuration(s). Most commonly, this involved the burial porcine cadavers and long-term monitoring for soilwater,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pringle|first=Jamie K.|last2=Cassella|first2=John P.|last3=Jervis|first3=John R.|last4=Williams|first4=Anna|last5=Cross|first5=Peter|last6=Cassidy|first6=Nigel J.|date=2015-07-01|title=Soilwater Conductivity Analysis to Date and Locate Clandestine Graves of Homicide Victims|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1556-4029.12802/abstract|journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences|language=en|volume=60|issue=4|pages=1052–1060|doi=10.1111/1556-4029.12802|issn=1556-4029}}&lt;/ref&gt; seasonal effects on electrical resistivity surveys, burial in walls and beneath concrete,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ruffell|first=A|last2=Pringle|first2=JK|last3=Forbes|first3=S|date=2014-01-05|title=Search protocols for hidden forensic objects beneath floors and within walls|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.forsciint.2013.12.036/abstract|journal=Forensic Science International|language=en|volume=237|pages=237–245|doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2013.12.036}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Long-Term monitoring in the UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pringle|first=Jamie K.|last2=Jervis|first2=John R.|last3=Roberts|first3=Daniel|last4=Dick|first4=Henry C.|last5=Wisniewski|first5=Kristopher D.|last6=Cassidy|first6=Nigel J.|last7=Cassella|first7=John P.|date=2016-03-01|title=Long-term Geophysical Monitoring of Simulated Clandestine Graves using Electrical and Ground Penetrating Radar Methods: 4–6 Years After Burial|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1556-4029.13009/abstract|journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences|language=en|volume=61|issue=2|pages=309–321|doi=10.1111/1556-4029.13009|issn=1556-4029}}&lt;/ref&gt; the US&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schultz|first=John J.|last2=Walter|first2=Brittany S.|last3=Healy|first3=Carrie|date=2016-09-01|title=Long-term sequential monitoring of controlled graves representing common burial scenarios with ground penetrating radar: Years 2 and 3|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926985116301707|journal=Journal of Applied Geophysics|volume=132|pages=60–74|doi=10.1016/j.jappgeo.2016.06.015|bibcode=2016JAG...132...60S}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Molina|first=Carlos Martin|last2=Pringle|first2=Jamie K.|last3=Saumett|first3=Miguel|last4=Evans|first4=Gethin T.|date=2016-12-01|title=Geophysical and botanical monitoring of simulated graves in a tropical rainforest, Colombia, South America|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926985116303706|journal=Journal of Applied Geophysics|volume=135|pages=232–242|doi=10.1016/j.jappgeo.2016.10.002|bibcode=2016JAG...135..232M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally there has been surveys in graveyards over graves of known ages to determine the geophysical responses of multi-geophysical techniques with increasing burial ages&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dick|first=H |last2=Pringle|first2=JK |last3=Wisniewski|first3=KD|last4=Goodwin|first4=J|last5=van der Putten|first5=R|last6=Evans|first6=GT|last7=Francis|first7=JD|last8=Cassella|first8=JP|last9=Hansen|first9=JD|date=2017|title=Determining geophysical responses from burials in graveyards and cemeteries|url=http://library.seg.org/doi/abs/10.1190/geo2016-0440.1|journal=Geophysics|volume=x|pages=x–x|doi=10.1190/geo2016-0440.1||bibcode=2017Geop...82B.245D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''framebuffer''' ('''frame buffer''', or sometimes '''framestore''') is a portion of [[Random-access memory|RAM]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/F/frame_buffer.html|title=What is frame buffer? A Webopedia Definition|work=webopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; containing a [[bitmap]] that drives a video display. It is a [[Data buffer|memory buffer]] containing a complete [[Film frame|frame]] of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sunhelp.org/faq/FrameBuffer.html#00 |title=Frame Buffer FAQ |accessdate=14 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern [[video cards]] contain framebuffer circuitry in their cores. This circuitry converts an in-memory bitmap into a [[video signal]] that can be displayed on a computer monitor. 

In [[computing]], a '''screen buffer''' is a part of [[computer memory]] used by a computer application for the representation of the content to be shown on the [[computer display]].&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=.NET Framework Solutions: In Search of the Lost Win32 API|author=Mueller, J.|date=2002|publisher=Wiley|isbn=9780782141344|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XYQruTc6_44C|page=160|accessdate=2015-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The screen buffer may also be called the '''video buffer''', the '''regeneration buffer''', or '''regen buffer''' for short.&lt;ref name="smartcomputing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smartcomputing.com/editorial/dictionary/detail.asp?searchtype=2&amp;DicID=10421&amp;RefType=Dictionary&amp;guid=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324192310/http://www.smartcomputing.com/editorial/dictionary/detail.asp?searchtype=2&amp;DicID=10421&amp;RefType=Dictionary&amp;guid= |archive-date=2012-03-24 |dead-url=yes|title=Smart Computing Dictionary Entry - video buffer|accessdate=2015-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Screen buffers should be distinguished from [[video memory]]. To this end, the term '''off-screen buffer''' is also used.

The information in the buffer typically consists of color values for every [[pixel]] to be shown on the display. Color values are commonly stored in 1-bit [[binary image|binary]] (monochrome), 4-bit [[palette (computing)|palettized]], 8-bit palettized, 16-bit [[high color]] and 24-bit [[Color depth#True color .2824-bit.29|true color]] formats. An additional [[Alpha compositing|alpha channel]] is sometimes used to retain information about pixel transparency. The total amount of memory required for the framebuffer depends on the [[Display resolution|resolution]] of the output signal, and on the [[color depth]] or [[Palette (computing)|palette]] size.

== History ==
Computer researchers{{who?|date=July 2017}} had long discussed the theoretical advantages of a framebuffer, but were unable to produce a machine with sufficient memory at an economically practicable cost.{{cn|date=August 2017}} In 1969, A. Michael Noll of [[Bell Labs]] implemented a scanned display with a frame buffer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Noll |first=A. Michael |title=Scanned-Display Computer Graphics |work=Communications of the ACM |volume=14 |number=3 |date=March 1971 |pages=145-150 |doi=10.1145/362566.362567}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later on, the Bell Labs system was expanded to display an image with a color depth of three bits on a standard color TV monitor. An even earlier scanned display was implemented at the [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author1=D. Ophir |author2=S. Rankowitz |author3=B. J. Shepherd |author4=R. J. Spinrad |title=BRAD: The Brookhave Raster Display |work=Communications of the ACM |volume=11 |number=6 |date=June 1968 |pages=415–416 |doi=10.1145/363347.363385}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advances in [[Integrated circuit|integrated-circuit]] memory in the 1970s made it more practical to create framebuffers capable of holding a standard video image.

In 1972, [[Richard Shoup (programmer)|Richard Shoup]] developed the [[SuperPaint]] system at [[Xerox PARC]].&lt;ref name="Shoup_SuperPaint"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://accad.osu.edu/~waynec/history/PDFs/Annals_final.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040612215245/http://accad.osu.edu/~waynec/history/PDFs/Annals_final.pdf |archive-date=2004-06-12 |title=SuperPaint: An Early Frame Buffer Graphics System |author=Richard Shoup |publisher=IEEE |work=Annals of the History of Computing |year=2001 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shoup was also able to use the SuperPaint framebuffer to create an early digital video-capture system. By synchronizing the output signal to the input signal, Shoup was able to overwrite each pixel of data as it shifted in. Shoup also experimented with modifying the output signal using color tables. These color tables allowed the SuperPaint system to produce a wide variety of colors outside the range of the limited 8-bit data it contained. This scheme would later become commonplace in computer framebuffers.

In 1974 [[Evans &amp; Sutherland]] released the first commercial framebuffer, the Picture System,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Picture System |url=http://s3data.computerhistory.org/brochures/evanssutherland.3d.1974.102646288.pdf |publisher=Evans &amp; Sutherland |access-date=2017-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; costing about $15,000. It was capable of producing resolutions of up to 512 by 512 pixels in 8-bit [[grayscale]], and became a boon for graphics researchers who did not have the resources to build their own framebuffer. The [[New York Institute of Technology]] would later create the first 24-bit color system using three of the Evans &amp; Sutherland framebuffers.&lt;ref name="NYIT-History"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ph/nyit/masson/nyit.html |title=History of the New York Institute of Technology Graphics Lab |accessdate=2007-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each framebuffer was connected to an [[RGB color model|RGB]] color output (one for red, one for green and one for blue), with a Digital Equipment Corporation PDP 11/04 [[minicomputer]] controlling the three devices as one.

In 1975, the UK company [[Quantel]] produced the first commercial full-color broadcast framebuffer, the Quantel DFS 3000. It was first used in TV coverage of the [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Montreal Olympics]] to generate a [[picture-in-picture]] inset of the Olympic flaming torch while the rest of the picture featured the runner entering the stadium.

The rapid improvement of integrated-circuit technology made it possible for many of the home computers of the late 1970s to contain low-color-depth framebuffers. Today, nearly all computers with graphical capabilities utilize a framebuffer for generating the video signal. [[Amiga]] computers, created in the 1980s, featured special design attention to graphics performance and included a unique [[Hold-And-Modify]] framebuffer capable of displaying 4096 colors.

Framebuffers also became popular in high-end workstations and [[arcade system board]]s throughout the 1980s. [[Silicon Graphics|SGI]], [[Sun Microsystems]], [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] and [[IBM]] all released framebuffers for their workstation computers in this period. These framebuffers were usually of a much higher quality than could be found in most home computers, and were regularly used in television, printing, computer modeling and 3D graphics. Framebuffers were also used by [[Sega]] for its high-end [[List of Sega arcade system boards|arcade boards]], which were also of a higher quality than on home computers.

== Display modes ==
[[Image:Sun sbus cgsix framebuffer2.jpg|thumb|A Sun cgsix framebuffer]]
Framebuffers used in personal and home computing often had sets of defined ''modes'' under which the framebuffer can operate. These modes reconfigure the hardware to output different resolutions, color depths, memory layouts and [[refresh rate]] timings. 

In the world of [[Unix]] machines and operating systems, such conveniences were usually eschewed in favor of directly manipulating the hardware settings. This manipulation was far more flexible in that any resolution, color depth and refresh rate was attainable – limited only by the memory available to the framebuffer.

An unfortunate side-effect of this method was that the [[display device]] could be driven beyond its capabilities. In some cases this resulted in hardware damage to the display.&lt;ref&gt;http://tldp.org/HOWTO/XFree86-Video-Timings-HOWTO/overd.html XFree86 Video Timings HOWTO: Overdriving Your Monitor&lt;/ref&gt; More commonly, it simply produced garbled and unusable output. Modern CRT monitors fix this problem through the introduction of protection circuitry. When the display mode is changed, the monitor attempts to obtain a signal lock on the new refresh frequency. If the monitor is unable to obtain a signal lock, or if the signal is outside the range of its design limitations, the monitor will ignore the framebuffer signal and possibly present the user with an error message.

LCD monitors tend to contain similar protection circuitry, but for different reasons. Since the LCD must digitally sample the display signal (thereby emulating an electron beam), any signal that is out of range cannot be physically displayed on the monitor.

== Color palette ==
Framebuffers have traditionally supported a wide variety of color modes. Due to the expense of memory, most early framebuffers used 1-bit (2-color), 2-bit (4-color), 4-bit (16-color) or 8-bit (256-color) color depths. The problem with such small color depths is that a full range of colors cannot be produced. The solution to this problem was [[indexed color]] which adds a [[lookup table]] to the framebuffer. Each color stored in framebuffer memory acts as a color index. The lookup table serves as a palette with a limited number of different colors.

In some designs it was also possible to write data to the LUT (or switch between existing palettes) on the run, allowing dividing the picture into horizontal bars with their own palette and thus render an image that had a far wider palette. For example, viewing an outdoor shot photograph, the picture could be divided into four bars, the top one with emphasis on sky tones, the next with foliage tones, the next with skin and clothing tones, and the bottom one with ground colors. This required each palette to have overlapping colors, but carefully done, allowed great flexibility.

== Memory access ==
While framebuffers are commonly accessed via a [[Memory-mapped I/O|memory mapping]] directly to the CPU memory space, this is not the only method by which they may be accessed. Framebuffers have varied widely in the methods used to access memory. Some of the most common are:
* Mapping the entire framebuffer to a given memory range.
* Port commands to set each pixel, range of pixels or palette entry.
* Mapping a memory range smaller than the framebuffer memory, then [[bank switching]] as necessary.

The framebuffer organization may be [[packed pixel]] or [[Planar (computer graphics)|planar]]. The framebuffer may be [[all points addressable]] or have restrictions on how it can be updated.

== RAM on the video card ==
{{see also|Video memory}}
Video cards always have a certain amount of RAM. This RAM is where the bitmap of image data is "buffered" for display. The term ''frame buffer'' is thus often used interchangeably when referring to this RAM.

The CPU sends image updates to the video card. The video processor on the card forms a picture of the screen image and stores it in the frame buffer as a large bitmap in RAM. The bitmap in RAM is used by the card to continually refresh the screen image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://karbosguide.com/hardware/module7b1.htm|title=An illustrated Guide to the Video Cards|work=karbosguide.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]--&gt;

== Virtual framebuffers ==
Many systems attempt to emulate the function of a framebuffer device, often for reasons of compatibility. The two most common "virtual" framebuffers are the [[Linux framebuffer]] device ('''fbdev''') and the X Virtual Framebuffer ([[Xvfb]]). The X Virtual Framebuffer was added to the X Window System distribution to provide a method for running X without a graphical framebuffer. While the original reasons for this are lost to history, {{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} it is often used on modern systems to support programs such as the [[Sun Microsystems]] [[JVM]] that do not allow dynamic graphics to be generated in a [[headless system|headless]] environment.

The Linux framebuffer device was developed to abstract the physical method for accessing the underlying framebuffer into a guaranteed memory map that is easy for programs to access. This increases portability, as programs are not required to deal with systems that have disjointed memory maps or require bank switching.

== Page flipping ==
{{main|Double buffering}}

Since framebuffers are often designed to handle more than one resolution, they often contain more memory than is necessary to display a single frame at lower resolutions. Since this memory can be considerable in size, a trick was developed to allow for new frames to be written to video memory without disturbing the frame that is currently being displayed.

The concept works by telling the framebuffer to use a specific chunk of its memory to display the current frame. While that memory is being displayed, a completely separate part of memory is filled with data for the next frame. Once the secondary buffer is filled (typically referred to as the "back buffer"), the framebuffer is instructed to look at the secondary buffer instead. The primary buffer (typically referred to as the "front buffer") becomes the secondary buffer, and the secondary buffer becomes the primary. This switch is often done after the [[vertical blanking interval]] to prevent the screen from "[[Screen tearing|tearing]]" (i.e., half the old frame is shown, and half the new frame is shown).

Most modern framebuffers are manufactured with enough memory to perform this trick even at high resolutions. As a result, it has become a standard technique used by PC [[game programmer]]s.

== Graphics accelerators ==
{{main|Video card}}

As the demand for better graphics increased, hardware manufacturers created a way to decrease the amount of [[CPU]] time required to fill the framebuffer. This is commonly called "graphics accelerating".

Common graphics drawing commands (many of them geometric) are sent to the graphics accelerator in their raw form. The accelerator then [[raster graphics|rasterizes]] the results of the command to the framebuffer. This method can save thousands or millions of CPU cycles per command, as the CPU is freed to do other work.

While early accelerators focused on improving the performance of 2D [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] systems, most modern accelerators focus on producing 3D imagery in real time. A common design is to send commands to the graphics accelerator using a library such as [[OpenGL]] or [[Direct3D]]. The graphics driver then translates those commands to instructions for the accelerator's [[graphics processing unit]] (GPU). The GPU uses those [[instruction set|microinstructions]] to compute the rasterized results. Those results are [[bit blit]]ted to the framebuffer. The framebuffer's signal is then produced in combination with built-in video overlay devices (usually used to produce the mouse cursor without modifying the framebuffer's data) and any analog special effects that are produced by modifying the output signal. An example of such analog modification was the [[spatial anti-aliasing]] technique used by the [[3dfx]] [[Voodoo Graphics|Voodoo cards]]. These cards add a slight blur to output signal that makes aliasing of the rasterized graphics much less obvious.

At one time there were many manufacturers of graphics accelerators, including: [[3dfx Interactive|3dfx]]; [[ATI Technologies|ATI]];  [[Hercules Computer Technology|Hercules]]; [[Trident Microsystems|Trident]];  [[Nvidia]]; [[Radius (hardware company)|Radius]]; [[S3 Graphics]]; [[Silicon Integrated Systems|SiS]] and [[Silicon Graphics]].  {{as of|2015}} the market for graphics accelerators for x86-based systems is dominated by Nvidia (acquired 3dfx in 2002), [[AMD]] (who acquired ATI in 2006), and [[Intel]] (which currently produces only [[Graphics processing unit#Integrated graphics solutions|integrated GPUs]] rather than discrete video cards).

==Comparisons to other display technologies==
Framebuffers differ significantly from the [[vector display]]s that were common prior to the advent of raster graphics (and, consequently, to the concept of a framebuffer). With a vector display, only the [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]] of the graphics primitives are stored. The [[Cathode ray|electron beam]] of the output display is then commanded to move from vertex to vertex, tracing an analog line across the area between these points. With a framebuffer, the electron beam (if the display technology uses one) is commanded to trace a left-to-right, top-to-bottom path across the entire screen, the way a [[television]] renders a broadcast signal. The color information for each point thus displayed on the screen is pulled from the framebuffer, creating a set of discrete picture elements, i.e. pixels.

Likewise, framebuffers differ from the technology used in early text displays, where a buffer holds codes for characters, not individual pixels.  The video display device drives the electron beam in a raster pattern the same as with a framebuffer, but generates the pixels of each character in the buffer as it directs the beam.

{{Science|phil/hist}}
'''Research funding''' is a term generally covering any funding for scientific [[research]], in the areas of both "hard" [[science]] and [[technology]] and [[social science]]. The term often connotes funding obtained through a competitive process, in which potential research projects are evaluated and only the most promising receive funding. Such processes, which are run by government, corporations or foundations, allocate scarce funds.

Most research funding comes from two major sources, corporations (through [[research and development]] departments) and government (primarily carried out through universities and specialized government agencies; often known as ''research councils''). Some small amounts of scientific research are carried out (or funded) by charitable foundations, especially in relation to developing cures for diseases such as [[cancer]], [[malaria]] and [[AIDS]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

According to [[OECD]], more than 60% of [[research and development]] in scientific and technical fields is carried out by industries, and 20% and 10% respectively by [[universities]] and government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/science-and-technology/oecd-science-technology-and-industry-scoreboard-2015_sti_scoreboard-2015-en|title=OECD Science, Technology and Industry Scoreboard 2015: Innovation for growth and society |last= |first= |publisher=OECD |year=2015 |isbn=9789264239784 |location= |pages=156 |doi=10.1787/sti_scoreboard-2015-en |quote=|via=oecd-ilibrary.org|series=OECD Science, Technology and Industry Scoreboard }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparatively, in countries with less GDP, such as [[Portugal]] and [[Mexico]] the industry contribution is significantly lower. The US government spends more than other countries on military R&amp;D, although the proportion has fallen from around 30% in the 1980s to under 20.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} Government funding for medical research amounts to approximately 36%&lt;!-- OF WHAT?? --&gt; in the U.S. The government funding proportion in certain industries is higher, and it dominates research in [[social science]] and [[humanities]]. Similarly, with some exceptions (e.g. [[biotechnology]]) government provides the bulk of the funds for ''basic'' scientific research.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} In commercial research and development, all but the most research-oriented corporations focus more heavily on near-term commercialization possibilities rather than "blue-sky" ideas or technologies (such as [[nuclear fusion]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Taylor | first1 = R.A. | year = 2012 | title = Socioeconomic impacts of heat transfer research | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735193312002199 | journal = International Communications in Heat and Mass Transfer | volume = 39 | issue = 10| pages = 1467–1473 | doi=10.1016/j.icheatmasstransfer.2012.09.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main article|History of science policy}}

In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, as the pace of technological progress increased before and during the [[industrial revolution]], most scientific and technological research was carried out by individual [[inventor]]s using their own funds. A system of [[patent]]s was developed to allow inventors a period of time (often twenty years) to commercialise their inventions and recoup a profit, although in practice many found this difficult. The talents of an inventor are not those of a businessman, and there are many examples of inventors (e.g. [[Charles Goodyear]]) making rather little money from their work whilst others were able to market it.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

In the twentieth century, scientific and technological research became increasingly systematised, as [[corporation]]s developed, and discovered that continuous investment in [[research and development]] could be a key element of success in a competitive strategy. It remained the case, however, that imitation by competitors - circumventing or simply flouting patents, especially those registered abroad - was often just as successful a strategy for companies focused on innovation in matters of organisation and production technique, or even in marketing. A classic example is that of [[Wilkinson Sword]] and [[Global Gillette|Gillette]] in the [[disposable razor]] market, where the former has typically had the technological edge, and the latter the commercial one.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

==National funding by country==
{{Main|List of countries by research and development spending}}
Different countries spend vastly different amounts on research, in both absolute and relative terms. For instance, [[South Korea]] and [[Israel]] spend more than 4% of their GDP on research while many Arabic countries spend less than 1% (e.g. [[Saudi Arabia]] 0.25%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Gross domestic spending on R&amp;D (indicator)|doi=10.1787/d8b068b4-en|url=https://data.oecd.org/rd/gross-domestic-spending-on-r-d.htm|accessdate=1 July 2017|date=2017-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===USA===
The US spent $456.1 billion for research and development (R&amp;D) in 2013, the most recent year for which such figures are available, according to the [[National Science Foundation]]. The private sector accounted for $322.5 billion, or 71%, of total national expenditures, with universities and colleges spending $64.7 billion, or 14%, in second place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anonymous|year=2016|title=Microbiology Policy Bulletin Board|url=http://www.asmscience.org/docserver/fulltext/microbe/11/4/microbe_11_4.pdf|journal=Microbe Magazine|volume=11|pages=145|via=ASM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
[[Switzerland]] spent CHF 22 billion for R&amp;D in 2015 with an increase of 10.5% compared with 2012 when the last survey was conducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Recherche et développement en Suisse 2015 (press release)|url=https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/fr/home/actualites/communiques-presse.assetdetail.2422944.html |accessdate=1 July 2017|date=2017-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In relative terms, this represents 3.4% of the country's GDP. R&amp;D activities are carried out by nearly 125,000 individuals, mostly in the private sector (71%) and higher education institutions (27%).

==Process==
Often scientists apply for research funding which a granting agency may (or may not) approve to financially support.  These ''grants'' require a lengthy process as the granting agency can inquire about the researcher(s)'s background, the facilities used, the equipment needed, the time involved, and the overall potential of the scientific outcome.  The process of grant writing and grant proposing is a somewhat delicate process for both the grantor and the grantee:  the grantors want to choose the research that best fits their scientific principles, and the individual grantees want to apply for research in which they have the best chances but also in which they can build a body of work towards future scientific endeavors.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

The [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council]] in the United Kingdom has devised an alternative method of fund-distribution: the sandpit.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news

[...] The wheels of such events are oiled with the promise of up to £1 million in funding, which is dished out at the end through a group peer-review process.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Most universities have research administration offices to facilitate the interaction between the researcher and the granting agency.&lt;ref&gt;
Gonzales, Evelina Garza, "External Funding and Tenure at Texas State University-San Marcos" (2009). Texas State University. Applied Research Projects. Paper 315.  http://ecommons.txstate.edu/arp/315
&lt;/ref&gt;
"Research administration is all about service—service to our faculty, to our academic units, to the institution, and to our sponsors.  To be of service, we first have to know what our customers want and then determine whether or not we are meeting those needs and expectations."&lt;ref&gt;

''[http://www.aiseducation.com/RAG_product.html SPONSORED RESEARCH ADMINISTRATION: A Guide to Effective Strategies and Recommended Practices ]''
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States of America, the [[National Council of University Research Administrators]] (NCURA) serves its members and advances the field of research administration through education and professional development programs, the sharing of knowledge and experience, and by fostering a professional, collegial, and respected community.

===Public funding===
{{Main article|Science policy}}
{{see also|Research council|United States national laboratories (disambiguation){{!}}United States national laboratories|Federally funded research and development centers|label 3 = List of federally-funded research and development centers (US)}}
Government-funded research can either be carried out by the government itself, or through [[Grant (money)|grants]] to researchers outside the government.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} The bodies providing public funding are often referred to as ''research councils''.

Critics{{Who|date=December 2014}} of [[basic research]] are concerned that research funding for the sake of knowledge itself does not contribute to a great return.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}  However, scientific innovations often foreshadow or inspire further ideas unintentionally. For example, NASA's quest to put a man on the moon inspired them to develop better sound recording and reading technologies.  NASA's research was furthered by the music industry, who used it to develop audio cassettes.  Audio cassettes, being smaller and able to store more music, quickly dominated the music industry and increased the availability of music.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

An additional distinction of government-sponsored research is that the government does not make a claim to the [[intellectual property]], whereas private research-funding bodies sometimes claim ownership of the intellectual property that they are paying to have developed. Consequently, government-sponsored research more often allows the individual discoverer to file intellectual property claims over their own work.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

====List of research councils====
Research councils are (usually public) bodies that provide research funding in the form of research grants or [[scholarship]]s.  These include [[arts council]]s and research councils for the funding of science.

Examples of companies that fund basic research include IBM (high temperature superconductivity was [[High-temperature superconductivity|discovered by IBM sponsored basic experimental research]] in 1986), L'Oreal (which created the [[L'Oréal-UNESCO Awards for Women in Science|L'Oreal-Unesco prize for women scientists]] and finances internships), AXA (which launched a [http://www.axa-research.org/ Research Fund] in 2008 and finances Academic Institutions such as advanced fundamental mathematics French Foundation IHES).

A company may share resources with a [[materials science]] society to gain proprietary knowledge or trained workers.

===Hard money versus soft money===
In academic contexts, '''hard money''' may refer to funding received from a government or other entity at regular intervals, thus providing a steady inflow of financial resources to the beneficiary. The antonym, '''soft money''', refers to funding provided only through competitive [[research grant]]s and the writing of grant proposals.&lt;ref name="StackExchangeHardMoney"&gt;[http://academia.stackexchange.com/a/30627 "What is a soft-money research position?"], Academia StackExchange&lt;/ref&gt;

Hard money is usually issued by the government for the advancement of certain projects or for the benefit of specific agencies. Community [[healthcare]], for instance, may be supported by the government by providing hard money. Since funds are disbursed regularly and continuously, the offices in charge of such projects are able to achieve their objectives more effectively than if they had been issued one-time grants.

Individual jobs at a research institute may be classified as "hard-money positions" or "soft-money positions";&lt;ref name="StackExchangeHardMoney"/&gt; the former are expected to provide [[job security]] because their funding is secure in the long term, whereas individual "soft-money" positions may come and go with fluctuations in the number of grants awarded to the institution.

==Influence on research==
The source of funding may introduce conscious or unconscious biases into a researcher's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://undsci.berkeley.edu/article/0_0_0/who_pays|title=Who pays for science?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest (COIs) is used by biomedical journals to guarantee credibility and transparency of the scientific process. Conflict of interest disclosure, however, is not systematically nor consistently dealt with by journals which publish scientific research results.  When research is funded by the same agency that can be expected to gain from a favorable outcome there is a potential for biased results and research shows that results are indeed more favorable than would be expected from a more objective view of the evidence. A 2003 [[systematic review]] studied  the scope and impact of industry sponsorship in biomedical research.  The researchers found financial relationships among industry, scientific investigators, and academic institutions  widespread.  Results  showed a statistically significant association between industry sponsorship and pro-industry conclusions and concluded that "Conflicts of interest arising from these ties can influence biomedical research in important ways".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Relationship between Funding Source and Conclusion among Nutrition-Related Scientific Articles|volume=4|issue=1|pages=e5|work=[[PLOS Medicine]]|publisher=[[PLOS]]|author1=Lenard I Lesser |author2=Cara B Ebbeling |author3=Merrill Goozner |author4=David Wypij |author5=David S Ludwig |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0040005|pmid=17214504|pmc=1764435|date=January 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A British study found that a majority of the members on national and food policy committees receive funding from food companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Food company sponsorship of nutrition research and professional activities: a conflict of interest?|volume=4|issue=5|pages=1015–1022|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=566532|work=[[Public Health Nutrition]]|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|accessdate=24 March 2014|author=Marion Nestle|doi=10.1079/PHN2001253|date=October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to cut costs, the pharmaceutical industry has turned to the use of private, nonacademic research groups (i.e., contract research organizations [CROs]) which can do the work for less money than academic investigators.  In 2001 CROs came under criticism when the editors of 12 major scientific journals issued a joint editorial, published in each journal, on the control over clinical trials exerted by sponsors, particularly targeting the use of contracts which allow sponsors to review the studies prior to publication and withhold publication of any studies in which their product did poorly. They further criticized the trial methodology  stating that researchers are frequently restricted from contributing to the trial design, accessing the raw data, and interpreting the results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 81460 | pmid=11584570 | volume=165 | issue=6 | title=Sponsorship, authorship and accountability |date=September 2001 | journal=CMAJ | pages=786–8| author1=Davidoff | first1=F | last2=Deangelis | first2=C.

The [[Cochrane Collaboration]], a worldwide group that aims to provide compiled scientific evidence to aid well informed health care decisions,  conducts [[systematic review]]s of [[randomized controlled trial]]s of health care interventions and tries to disseminate the results and conclusions derived from them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Cochrane Collaboration|journal=Eur J Clin Nutr|date=August 2005|volume=59|series=Suppl 1|issue=S1|pages=S147–S149|doi=10.1038/sj.ejcn.1602188|url=http://www.nature.com/ejcn/journal/v59/n1s/full/1602188a.html|accessdate=31 January 2012|pmid=16052183|last1=Scholten|first1=R.

The systematic reviews are published in the [[Cochrane Library]]. A 2011 study done to disclose possible conflicts of interests [COI] in underlying research studies used for medical [[meta-analyses]] reviewed 29 meta-analyses and found that COIs in the studies underlying the meta-analyses were rarely disclosed.   The 29 meta-analyses reviewed an aggregate of 509 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Of these, 318 RCTs reported funding sources with 219 (69%) industry funded. 132 of the 509 RCTs reported author COI disclosures, with 91 studies (69%) disclosing industry financial ties with one or more authors. The information was, however, seldom reflected in the meta-analyses. Only two (7%) reported RCT funding sources and none reported RCT author-industry ties. The authors concluded "without acknowledgement of COI due to industry funding or author industry financial ties from RCTs included in meta-analyses, readers' understanding and appraisal of the evidence from the meta-analysis may be compromised."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Well Do Meta-Analyses Disclose Conflicts of Interests in Underlying Research Studies|url=http://www.cochrane.org/news/blog/how-well-do-meta-analyses-disclose-conflicts-interests-underlying-research-studies|work=The Cochrane Collaboration website|publisher=[[Cochrane Collaboration]]|accessdate=24 March 2014|date=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 researchers looked at the association between authors' published positions on the safety and efficacy in assisting with weight loss of [[olestra]], a [[fat substitute]] manufactured by the [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] (P&amp;G), and their financial relationships with the food and beverage industry.  They found that supportive authors were significantly more likely than critical or neutral authors to have financial relationships with P&amp;G and all authors disclosing an affiliation with P&amp;G were supportive.  The authors of the study concluded: "Because authors' published opinions were associated with their financial relationships, obtaining noncommercial funding may be more essential to maintaining objectivity than disclosing personal financial interests."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Authors' Financial Relationships With the Food and Beverage Industry and Their Published Positions on the Fat Substitute Olestra| pmc=1447808 | pmid=12660215|volume=93| issue=4 |year=2003|pages=664–9 | last1 = Levine | first1 = J | last2 = Gussow | first2 = JD | last3 = Hastings | first3 = D | last4 = Eccher | first4 = A | doi=10.2105/ajph.93.4.664 | journal=American Journal of Public Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Out of the scientists questioned, 15.5% admitted to altering design, methodology or results of their studies due to pressure of an external funding source.

A theoretical model has been established whose simulations imply that peer review and over-competitive research funding foster mainstream opinion to monopoly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fang | first1 = H. | year = 2011 | title = Peer review and over-competitive research funding fostering mainstream opinion to monopoly | url = | journal = Scientometrics | volume = 87 | issue = 2| pages = 293–301 | doi=10.1007/s11192-010-0323-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Efficiency of funding ==
Most funding agencies mandate efficient use of their funds, that is, they want to maximize outcome for their money spent. Outcome can be measured by [[Scientific literature|publication]] output, [[citation impact]], number of [[Patent|patents]], number of [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhDs]] awarded etc. Another question is how to allocate funds to different disciplines, institutions, or researchers. A recent study by Wayne Walsh found that “prestigious institutions had on average 65% higher grant application success rates and 50% larger award sizes, whereas less-prestigious institutions produced 65% more publications and had a 35% higher citation impact per dollar of funding.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/research-dollars-go-farther-at-less-prestigious-institutions--study-64529|title=Research Dollars Go Farther at Less-Prestigious Institutions: Study|website=The Scientist Magazine®|language=en|access-date=2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wahls|first=Wayne P.|date=2018-07-13|title=High cost of bias: Diminishing marginal returns on NIH grant funding to institutions|url=https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/13/367847|journal=bioRxiv|language=en|pages=367847|doi=10.1101/367847}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Merge from |Glue code |date=September 2018 }}
In [[electronics]], '''glue logic''' is the custom [[Digital circuit|logic circuitry]] used to interface a number of [[Commercial off-the-shelf|off-the-shelf]] [[integrated circuits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glue Logic|url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,1237,t=glue+logic&amp;i=43822,00.asp|work=Definitions|accessdate=2 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is often achieved using ordinary (cheap) [[7400 series|7400]]- or [[4000 series|4000]]-series components. In more complex cases, programmable logic devices like a [[Complex programmable logic device|CPLD]] or [[Field-programmable gate array|FPGA]] might be used. The falling price of programmable logic devices, combined with their reduced size and power consumption (compared to discrete components), is making them common even for simple systems. In addition, programmable logic can be used to hide the exact function of a circuit, in order to prevent a product from being cloned or counterfeited (see: [[reverse engineering]]).

The software equivalent of glue logic is called [[glue code]].

==Usage==
Typical functions of glue logic may include:
*[[List of 7400 series integrated circuits|Simple logic functions]].
*[[Address decoder|Address decoding circuitry]] used with older processors like the [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]] or [[Zilog Z80|Z80]] to divide up the processor's address space into RAM, ROM and I/O. Newer versions of these processors (such as [[WDC 65816|65816]] or [[Zilog eZ80|eZ80]]), may add features that enable glueless interfacing to external devices.
*Buffers to protect outputs from overload, or protect sensitive inputs from [[Electrostatic discharge|ESD]] damage.
*Voltage level conversion, e.g. when interfacing one logic family ([[CMOS]]) to another ([[Transistor-transistor logic|TTL]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23827">The '''Gödel Prize''' is an annual prize for outstanding papers in the area of [[theoretical computer science]], given jointly by [[European Association for Theoretical Computer Science]] (EATCS) and the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computational Theory ([[ACM SIGACT]]). The award is named in honor of [[Kurt Gödel]]. Gödel's connection to theoretical computer science is that he was the first to mention the "[[P versus NP]]" question, in a 1956 letter to [[John von Neumann]] in which Gödel asked whether a certain [[NP-complete]] problem could be solved in quadratic or linear time.&lt;ref&gt;https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/the-gdel-letter/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gödel Prize has been awarded since 1993. The prize is awarded either at STOC (ACM [[Symposium on Theory of Computing]], one of the main [[North American]] conferences in theoretical computer science) or ICALP ([[International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming]], one of the main [[Europe]]an conferences in the field).  To be eligible for the prize, a paper must be published in a refereed journal within the last 14 (formerly 7) years.  The prize includes a reward of US$5000.&lt;ref name="Godël2017" /&gt;

The winner of the Prize is selected by a committee of six members. The EATCS President and the SIGACT Chair each appoint three members to the committee, to serve staggered three-year terms. The committee is chaired alternately by representatives of EATCS and SIGACT.

[[File:Gandhara Buddha (tnm).jpeg|thumb|right|220px|[[Standing Buddha]] with a halo, 1st–2nd century AD (or earlier), [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of [[Gandhara]].]]
[[File:Masaccio chapelle Brancacci.png|thumb|right|320px|[[Jesus]] and nine of the [[Twelve Apostles]] depicted with "Floating" disk haloes in perspective (detail from ''[[The Tribute Money (Masaccio)|The Tribute Money]]'', illustrating {{bibleverse||Matthew|17:24-27|KJV}}, by [[Masaccio]], 1424, [[Brancacci Chapel]]).]]

A '''halo''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἅλως}}, ''halōs'';&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|halo}} {{LSJ|a(/lws|ἅλως|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; also known as a '''nimbus''', '''[[Aureola|aureole]]''', '''glory''', or '''gloriole''') is a crown of light rays, circle or disk of light&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/halo-art|title=halo – art|website=britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; that surrounds a person in art.  They have been used in the [[iconography]] of many religions to indicate holy or sacred figures, and have at various periods also been used in images of rulers or heroes.  In the sacred art of [[Ancient Greece]], [[Ancient Rome]], [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]], among other religions, sacred persons may be depicted with a halo in the form of a circular glow, or flames in [[Asian art]], around the head or around the whole body—this last one is often called a [[mandorla]].  Halos may be shown as almost any color or combination of colors, but are most often depicted as golden, yellow or white when representing light or red when representing flames.

[[Homer]] describes a more-than-natural light around the heads of [[Greek hero|heroes]] in battle.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Iliad]]'' v.4ff, xviii.203ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Depictions of [[Perseus]] in the act of slaying [[Medusa]], with lines radiating from his head, appear on a white-ground toiletry box in the [[Louvre]] and on a slightly later [[Red-figure pottery|red-figured vase]] in the style of [[Polygnotos (vase painter)|Polygnotos]], ca. 450-30 BC, in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;Marjorie J. Milne, "[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/bibliography/?id=12253 Perseus and Medusa on an Attic Vase]" ''The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin'' New Series, '''4'''.5 (January 1946, pp. 126-130) 126.p.) {{JSTOR|3257993}}&lt;/ref&gt; On painted wares from [[Magna Graecia|south Italy]], radiant lines or simple haloes appear on a range of mythic figures: Lyssa, a personification of madness; a [[sphinx]]; a sea demon; and [[Thetis]], the sea-nymph who was mother to [[Achilles]].&lt;ref&gt;L. Stephani, ''Nimbus und Strahlenkranz in den Werken der Alten Kunst" in ''Mémoires de l'Académie des Sciences de Saint-Petersbourg'', series vi, vol. vol ix, noted in Milne 1946:130.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Colossus of Rhodes]] was a statue of the sun-god [[Helios]] and had his usual [[radiate crown]] (copied for the [[Statue of Liberty]]). [[Hellenistic]] rulers are often shown wearing radiate crowns that seem clearly to imitate this effect.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Further afield, [[Sumer]]ian religious literature frequently speaks of ''melam'' (loaned into [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] as ''melammu''), a "brilliant, visible glamour which is exuded by gods, heroes, sometimes by kings, and also by temples of great holiness and by gods' symbols and emblems."&lt;ref&gt;J. Black and A. Green, ''Gods, Demons and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotmia'' (Austin, 1992) p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Asian art ==
[[File:Menander II with nimbate Nike.jpg|thumb|350px|Coin of [[Indo-Greek]] king [[Menander II]] (90–85 BCE), displaying [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]] with a halo on the reverse.]]
The halo and the [[aureola]] have been widely used in Indian art, particularly in [[Buddhist]] iconography&lt;ref name="metmuseum.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/explore/publications/pdfs/asia/divided/d1_Art_S_Asia.pdf|title=Metropolitan Museum of Art: Art of South Asia|website=metmuseum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it has appeared since at least the 1st century AD; the Kushan [[Bimaran casket]] in the [[British Museum]] is dated 60AD (at least between 30BC and 200AD).  The rulers of the [[Kushan Empire]] were perhaps the earliest to give themselves haloes on their coins, and the nimbus in art may have originated in Central Asia and spread both east and west.&lt;ref name="metmuseum.org" /&gt;

In Chinese and Japanese [[Buddhist art]] the halo has also been used since the earliest periods in depicting the image of [[Amitabha|Amitabha Buddha]] and others. [[Tibetan Buddhism]] uses haloes and aureoles of many types, drawing from both Indian and Chinese traditions, extensively in statues and [[Thangka]] paintings of Buddhist saints such as [[Milarepa]] and [[Padmasambhava]] and deities.  Different coloured haloes have specific meanings: orange for monks, green for the Buddha and other more elevated beings,&lt;ref&gt;including the [[Qianlong Emperor]] – see note below. Rhie, Marylin and Thurman, Robert (eds):''Wisdom And Compassion: The Sacred Art of Tibet'', p. 99, &amp; passim, 2000, 1991, {{ISBN|0-8109-2526-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and commonly figures have both a halo for the head, and another circular one for the body, the two often intersecting somewhere around the head or neck. Thin lines of gold often radiate outwards or inwards from the rim of the halo, and sometimes a whole halo is made up of these.&lt;ref&gt;Rhie and Thurman, pp 77, 176, 197 etc.&lt;/ref&gt;  

In India the head halo is called ''Prabhamandala'' or ''Siras-cakra'', while the full body halo is ''Prabhavali''.&lt;ref&gt; Gopinatha  Rao, T. A. (1985).

[[Motilal Banarsidass]]. {{ISBN|9788120808782}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Elaborate haloes and especially aureoles also appear in [[Hindu]] sculpture, where they tend to develop into architectural frames in which the original idea can be hard to recognise. [[Theravada]] Buddhism and [[Jainism]] did not use the halo for many centuries, but later adopted it, though less thoroughly than other religious groups.

In Asian art, the nimbus is often imagined as consisting not just of light, but of flames.  This type seems to first appear in Chinese bronzes of which the earliest surviving examples date from before 450.&lt;ref&gt;No doubt, as later, the same motif appeared in paintings, but none survive from this early.  L Sickman &amp; A Soper, "The Art and Architecture of China", Pelican History of Art, 3rd ed 1971, pp 86-7, Penguin (now Yale History of Art), LOC 70-125675&lt;/ref&gt; The depiction of the flames may be very formalized, as in the regular little flames on the ring aureole surrounding many [[Chola]] bronzes and other classic Hindu sculptures of divinities, or very prominent, as with the more realistic flames, and sometimes smoke, shown rising to a peak behind many Tibetan Buddhist depictions of the "wrathful aspect" of divinities, and also in Persian miniatures of the classic period.  This type is also very rarely found, and on a smaller scale, in medieval Christian art.&lt;ref&gt;See Didron&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2017}}  Sometimes a thin line of flames rise up from the edges of a circular halo in Buddhist examples.&lt;ref&gt;Often in paintings from the [[Dunhuang caves]], see Anne Farrer (ed), "Caves of the Thousand Buddhas" , 1990, British Museum publications, nos 42, 53, 54 etc, {{ISBN|0-7141-1447-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Tibetan paintings the flames are often shown as blown by a wind, usually from left to right.&lt;ref&gt;Rhie and Thurman, p.161&lt;/ref&gt;

Halos are found in [[Islamic art]] from various places and periods, especially in [[Persian miniature]]s and [[Moghul]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] art influenced by them.  Flaming halos derived from Buddhist art surround angels, and similar ones are often seen [[Depiction of Muhammad|around Muhammad]] and other sacred human figures.  From the early 17th century, plainer round haloes appear in portraits of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal Emperors]] and subsequently [[Rajput]] and [[Sikh]] rulers;&lt;ref name="metmuseum.org" /&gt; despite the more local precedents art historians believe the Mughals took the motif from European religious art, though it expresses a Persian idea of the God-given [[charisma]] of kingship that is far older.&lt;ref&gt;Crill &amp; Jariwala, 29 and note&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] avoided using halos for the [[sultan]]s, despite their title as [[Caliph]], and they are only seen on Chinese emperors if they are posing as Buddhist religious figures, as some felt entitled to do.&lt;ref&gt;Such as the [[Qianlong Emperor]] [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:The_Qianlong_Emperor_in_Buddhist_Dress.jpg the Qianlong Emperor in Buddhist Dress], and his father.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Apollo1.JPG|thumb|240px|right|[[Apollo]] with a radiant halo in a Roman floor [[mosaic]] (late 2nd century, [[El Djem]], Tunisia)]]

The halo represents an [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]] or the glow of sanctity which was conventionally drawn encircling the head. It first appeared in the culture of Hellenistic Greece and [[Rome]], possibly related to the [[Zoroastrian]] ''hvarena'' – "glory" or "divine lustre" – which marked the Persian kings, and may have been imported with [[Mithraism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ramsden|first=E.

In a late 2nd century AD floor mosaic from Thysdrus, [[El Djem]],   (''illustration'') [[Helios|Apollo Helios]] is identified by his effulgent halo.  Another haloed Apollo in mosaic, from [[Hadrumentum]], is in the museum at [[Sousse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tunisiaonline.com/mosaics/mosaic05b.html |title=Illustration |accessdate= |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708143541/http://www.tunisiaonline.com/mosaics/mosaic05b.html |archivedate=8 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The conventions of this representation, head tilted, lips slightly parted, large-eyed, curling [[Hairstyle|hair cut]] in locks grazing the neck, were developed in the 3rd century BC to depict [[Alexander the Great]] (Bieber 1964; Yalouris 1980).

== In Christian art ==

[[File:ChristAsSol.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Early pre-4th century Mosaic of [[Sol Invictus]]&lt;ref&gt;According to the 1967 [[New Catholic Encyclopedia]], a standard library reference, in an article on ''[[Constantine the Great]]'': "Besides, the Sol Invictus had been adopted by the Christians in a Christian sense, as demonstrated in the Christ as [[Helios|Apollo-Helios]] in a [[mausoleum]] (c. 250) discovered beneath [[St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter's in the Vatican]]."&lt;/ref&gt; in Mausoleum M in the pre-4th-century necropolis [http://www.saintpetersbasilica.org/Necropolis/Scavi.htm beneath] [[St Peter's Basilica]] – interpreted by many as representing Christ.]]

The halo was incorporated into [[Early Christian art]] sometime in the 4th century with the earliest [[icon]]ic images of Christ, initially the only figure shown with one (together with his symbol, the [[Lamb of God]]).  Initially the halo was regarded by many as a representation of the ''[[Logos]]'' of Christ, his divine nature, and therefore in very early (before 500) depictions of Christ before his Baptism by [[John the Baptist|John]] he tends not to be shown with a halo, it being a matter of debate whether his ''Logos'' was innate from conception (the Orthodox view), or acquired at Baptism (the [[Nestorian doctrine|Nestorian]] view).  At this period he is also shown as a child or youth in ''Baptisms'', though this may be a hieratic rather than an age-related representation.&lt;ref&gt;G Schiller, ''Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. I'', 1971 (English trans. from German), Lund Humphries, London, p. 135, figs 150-53, 346-54. {{ISBN|0-85331-270-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kölner Meister eines Evangelienbuches 001.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]]'' and ''[[Transfiguration of Jesus in Christian art|Transfiguration]]'' of Christ, with cross haloes; the [[Twelve Apostles|apostles]], [[angel]]s and [[prophet]]s have plain ones. (1025–50, [[Cologne]]).]]

A '''cruciform halo''', that is to say a cross within, or extending beyond, a halo is used to represent the persons of the [[Holy Trinity]], especially [[Jesus]], and especially in medieval art.  In Byzantine and Orthodox images, inside each of the bars of the cross in Christ's halo is one of the [[Greek letter]]s Ο Ω Ν, making up {{lang|grc|[[I Am that I Am|ὁ ὢν]]}}—"ho ōn", literally, "the Existing One"—indicating the [[divinity of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Early Christian Symbols |url=http://www.catholicbiblical.ca/wp-content/uploads/Early-Christian-symbols.pdf |publisher=Catholic Biblical Association of Canada |accessdate=20 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111223120343/http://www.catholicbiblical.ca/wp-content/uploads/Early-Christian-symbols.pdf |archivedate=23 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At least in later Orthodox images, each bar of this cross is composed of three lines, symbolising the [[dogma]]s of the Trinity, the [[Divine simplicity|oneness of God]] and the [[Christology|two natures of Christ]].

In [[mosaic]]s in [[Santa Maria Maggiore]] (432-40) the juvenile Christ has a four-armed cross either on top of his head in the radius of the nimbus, or placed above the radius, but this is unusual.  In the same mosaics the accompanying angels have haloes (as, in a continuation of the Imperial tradition, does [[Herod the Great|King Herod]]), but not [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]].  Occasionally other figures have crossed haloes, such as the seven doves representing the [[Seven gifts of the Holy Spirit]] in the 11th century [[Codex Vyssegradensis]] [[Tree of Jesse]] (where [[Jesse]] and [[Isaiah]] also have plain haloes, as do the [[Ancestors of Christ]] in other miniatures).&lt;ref&gt;G Schiller, ''Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. I'', 1971 (English trans. from German), Lund Humphries, London, figs 20-22, {{ISBN|0-85331-270-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, triangular haloes are sometimes given to [[God the Father]] to represent the [[Trinity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/content?contentName=GL_Halo Nationalgallery.org.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070423223708/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/content?contentName=GL_Halo |date=23 April 2007 }},  Late 15th century reliefs by [[Jacopo della Quercia]] on the portal of San Petronio, Bologna are an early example of the triangular halo. According to Didron, Adolphe Napoléon: ''Christian Iconography: Or, The History of Christian Art in the Middle Ages'', London, 1851, Vol 2, p30, this is "extremely rare in France, but common enough in Italy and Greece&lt;/ref&gt;  When he is represented by a [[Hand of God (art)|hand emerging from a cloud]], this may be given a halo.

Plain round haloes are typically used to signify [[saint]]s, the Virgin Mary, [[Old Testament]] prophets, angels, symbols of the [[Four Evangelists]], and some other figures. [[Byzantine emperor]]s and empresses were often shown with them in compositions including saints or Christ, however the haloes were outlined only.  This was copied by Ottonian and later Russian rulers. Old Testament figures become less likely to have haloes in the West as the Middle Ages go on.&lt;ref&gt;Didron, Vol 2, pp.68-71&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pope Paschalis I. in apsis mosaic of Santa Prassede in Rome.gif|thumb|right|180px|[[Pope Paschal I]] is depicted during his lifetime, so with a square halo, c. 820, [[Santa Prassede]], Rome.]]
[[Beatification|Beatified]] figures, not yet canonised as saints, are sometimes shown in medieval Italian art with linear rays radiating out from the head, but no circular edge of the nimbus defined; later this became a less obtrusive form of halo that could be used for all figures.&lt;ref&gt;The distinction is observed in the ''Christ Glorified in the Court of Heaven'' (1423-4) by [[Fra Angelico]], [[National Gallery, London]], where only the beatified saints at the edges have radiating linear haloes.&lt;/ref&gt;   Mary has, especially from the [[Baroque]] period onwards, a special form of halo in a [[circle of stars|circle of twelve stars]], derived from her identification as the [[Woman of the Apocalypse]].

'''Square haloes''' were sometimes used for the living in [[donor portrait]]s of about 500-1100 in Italy;&lt;ref&gt;only in Italy, according to Didron, Vol 2 p.79.&lt;/ref&gt; Most surviving ones are of Popes and others in [[mosaic]]s in Rome, including the [[Episcopa Theodora]] head of the mother of the Pope of the day.  They seem merely an indication of a contemporary figure, as opposed to the saints usually accompanying them, with no real implication of future canonization. A late example is of [[Desiderius, Abbot of Monte Cassino]], later Pope, from a manuscript of 1056–86;&lt;ref&gt;see Didron, Vol 2 p.79 and Dodwell, C.R.; ''The Pictorial arts of the West, 800-1200'', 1993, Yale UP, {{ISBN|0-300-06493-4}}, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; Pope [[Gregory the Great]] had himself depicted with one, according to the 9th-century writer of his ''[[Hagiography|vita]]'', [[John, deacon of Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Diaconus gives the reason: ''circa verticem tabulae similitudinem, quod viventis insigne est, preferens, non-coronam'' ("bearing around his head the likeness of a square, which is the sign for a living person, and not a crown") ([[Migne]], ''Pat. Lat.'' 75, 231). The deacon of Rome was unaware of the Eastern tradition of depicting the emperor with a halo.  Surviving examples are rare, and seem to be becoming rarer; Bishop Ecclesius has a clear one in older photos of the mosaics in [[Basilica of San Vitale|San Vitale, Ravenna]], which appears to have been removed in recent restoration [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:SanVitale16.jpg Cupola of the choir] – see: James Hall, ''A History of Ideas and Images in Italian Art'', p100 &amp; photo p.93, 1983, John Murray, London, {{ISBN|0-7195-3971-4}}.  Other surviving examples are [[Pope Hadrian I]] in a mural formerly in [[Santa Prassede]], Rome, donor figures in the church at [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]]  [http://www.hp.uab.edu/image_archive/cr-03/cr-01/index.html and two more Roman examples – items 3 and 5]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630131544/http://www.hp.uab.edu/image_archive/cr-03/cr-01/index.html |date=30 June 2007 }}, one of Paschal's mother, the rather mysterious [[Episcopa Theodora]]. see also: Fisher, Sally.

Edited by Harriet Whelchel, Harry N Abrams, Inc., 1995&lt;/ref&gt;  A figure who may represent [[Moses]] in the 3rd century [[Dura Europos Synagogue]] has one, where no round halos are found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dura_Europos_fresco_holy_man.jpg|title=Joshua.

James Hall, ''A History of Ideas and Images in Italian Art'', p202, 1983, John Murray, London, {{ISBN|0-7195-3971-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scalloped haloes, sometimes just appearing as made of radiating bars, are found in the manuscripts of the [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] "Ada School", such as the [[Ada Gospels]].

The whole-body image of radiance is sometimes called the  '[[Aureola|aureole]]' or ''glory''; it is shown radiating from all round the body, most often of Christ or Mary, occasionally of saints (especially those reported to have been seen surrounded by one).  Such an aureola is often a [[mandorla]] ("almond-shaped" [[vesica piscis]]), especially around [[Christ in Majesty]], who may well have a halo as well.  In [[Transfiguration of Jesus in Christian art|depictions of the Transfiguration of Jesus]] a more complicated shape is often seen, especially in the [[Eastern Orthodox]] tradition, as in the famous 15th century icon in the [[Tretyakov Gallery]] in [[Moscow]].&lt;ref&gt;Didron, Vol 2, pp. 107-126&lt;/ref&gt;

Where gold is used as a background in [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]], [[mosaic]]s and panel paintings, the halo is often formed by inscribing lines in the [[gold leaf]], and may be decorated in patterns ([[diapering]]) within the outer radius, and thus becomes much less prominent.  The gold leaf inside the halo may also be burnished in a circular manner, so as to produce the effect of light radiating out from the subject's head. In the early centuries of its use, the Christian halo may be in most colours (though black is reserved for [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]], [[Satan]] and other evil figures) or multicoloured; later gold becomes standard, and if the entire background is not gold leaf, the halo itself usually will be.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Margaret Jensen, ''Understanding Early Christian Art'', p. 112, 2000, Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415-20454-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Decline of the halo ===
[[File:Fra Angelico 082.jpg|thumb|left|290px|[[Fra Angelico]]. ''[[Coronation of the Virgin]]''.  Note the haloes of the kneeling figures at the front, seen from behind.]]

With increasing [[Realism (visual arts)|realism]] in painting, the halo came to be a problem for artists.  So long as they continued to use the old compositional formulae which had been worked out to accommodate haloes, the problems were manageable, but as Western artists sought more flexibility in composition, this ceased to be the case.  In free-standing medieval [[sculpture]], the halo was already shown as a flat disk above or behind the head.  When [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] came to be considered essential, painters also changed the halo from an aura surrounding the head, always depicted as though seen full-on, to a flat golden disk or ring that appeared in perspective, floating above the heads of the saints, or vertically behind, sometimes transparent.  This can be seen first in [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]], who still gives Christ the cruciform halo which began to be phased out by his successors.  In northern Europe the radiant halo, made up of rays like a [[sunburst]], came into fashion in French painting around the end of the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;Tait, Hugh. ''Catalogue of the Waddesdon Bequest in the British Museum'', p. 43, 1986, British Museum Press, {{ISBN|978-0-7141-0525-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 15th century [[Jan van Eyck]] and [[Robert Campin]] largely abandoned their use, although some other [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] artists continued to use them.&lt;ref&gt;Haloes were also often added by later dealers and restorers to such works, and indeed sometimes used to convert portraits into "saints". [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/neth/hd_neth.htm Intentional Alterations of Early Netherlandish Painting, Metropolitan Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;  In Italy at around the same time, [[Pisanello]] used them if they did not clash with one of the enormous hats he liked to paint.  Generally they lasted longer in Italy, although often reduced to a thin gold band depicting the outer edge of the nimbus, usual for example in [[Giovanni Bellini]].  Christ began to be shown with a plain halo.
[[File:Madonna Benois.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Leonardo da Vinci]] (attributed),  ''[[The Benois Madonna|Benois Madonna]]''.  Floating semi-transparent haloes in perspective.]]

[[Fra Angelico]], himself a [[monk]], was a conservative as far as haloes are concerned, and some of his paintings demonstrate the problems well, as in several of his more crowded compositions, where they are shown as solid gold disks on the same plane as the picture surface, it becomes difficult to prevent them obstructing other figures.  At the same time they were useful in crowded narrative scenes for distinguishing the main, identifiable, figures from the mass of a crowd. [[Giotto]]'s [[Lamentation of Christ]] from the [[Scrovegni Chapel]] has eight figures with haloes and ten without, to whom the viewer knows they are not meant to attach a specific identity. In the same way, a ''Baptism of Christ'' by [[Perugino]] in Vienna gives neither Christ nor [[John the Baptist]] haloes, as sufficiently recognisable without them, but a saint in the background, not usually present in this scene, has a ring halo to denote his status.&lt;ref&gt;If not their identity. The painting has been partly repainted, and the current appearance may not be the original one. [[:File:Pietro Perugino 077.jpg|Vienna Perugino]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[High Renaissance]], even most Italian painters dispensed with haloes altogether, but in the Church's reaction to the [[Protestant Reformation]], that culminated in the [[Art in the Protestant Reformation and Counter-Reformation#Council of Trent|decrees on images of the Council of Trent]] of 1563, their use was mandated by clerical writers on religious art such as [[Molanus]] and Saint [[Carlo Borromeo]].  Figures were placed where natural light sources would highlight their heads, or instead more discreet quasi-naturalistic flickering or glowing light was shown around the head of Christ and other figures (perhaps pioneered by [[Titian]] in his late period). [[Rembrandt]]'s [[etching]]s, for example, show a variety of solutions of all of these types, as well as a majority with no halo effect at all.  The disk halo was rarely used for figures from [[classical mythology]] in the Renaissance, although they are sometimes seen, especially in the classical radiant form, in [[Mannerist]] and [[Baroque]] art.

By the 19th century haloes have become unusual in Western mainstream art, although retained in iconic and popular images, and sometimes as a medievalising effect.  When [[John Millais]] gives his otherwise realist ''[[St Stephen]]'' (1895) a ring halo, it seems rather surprising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/millais-saint-stephen-n01563|title=‘Saint Stephen’, Sir John Everett Millais, Bt, 1895 – Tate|first=|last=Tate|website=tate.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In popular graphic culture, a simple ring has become the predominant representation of a halo since at least the late 19th century, as seen for example in the logo for the [[Simon Templar]] ("The Saint") series of novels and other adaptations.

== Spiritual significance in Christianity ==

The early [[Church Fathers]] expended much rhetorical energy on conceptions of God as a source of light; among other things this was because "in the controversies in the 4th century over the consubstantiality of the Father and the Son, the relation of the ray to the source was the most cogent example of emanation and of distinct forms with a common substance" – key concepts in the theological thought of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Notes on Castelseprio (1957) in Meyer Schapiro, Selected Papers, volume 3, p117, Late Antique, Early Christian and Mediaeval Art, 1980, Chatto &amp; Windus, London, {{ISBN|0-7011-2514-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more [[Catholic]] interpretation, less dualistic in its assumptions, is that the halo represents the light of divine grace suffusing the soul, which is perfectly united and in harmony with the physical body.

In the theology of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], an [[icon]] is a "window into heaven" through which Christ and the Saints in heaven can be seen and communicated with. The gold background of the icon indicates that what is depicted is in heaven. The halo is a symbol of the [[Uncreated Light]] (Greek: Ἄκτιστον Φῶς) or [[Divine grace|grace]] of God shining forth through the icon. [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] in his ''[[De Coelesti Hierarchia|Celestial Hierarchies]]'' speaks of the angels and saints being illuminated by the grace of God, and in turn illumining others.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Origins and usage of the different terms ==
[[File:Preobrazhenie.jpeg|thumb|Late Byzantine/Russian [[icon]] of the [[Transfiguration of Jesus in Christian art|Transfiguration]]. Christ is shown surrounded by a light blue aureole with white flashes of lightning (15th century,  attributed to [[Theophanes the Greek]], [[Tretyakov Gallery]], [[Moscow]]).]]

The distinction between the alternative terms in English is rather unclear.  The oldest term in English is "glory", the only one available in the [[Middle Ages]], but now largely obsolete. It came from the French "gloire" which has much the same range of meanings as "glory".  "Gloriole" does not appear in this sense until 1844, being a modern invention, as a diminutive, in French also. "Halo" is first found in English in this sense in 1646 (nearly a century after the optical or astronomical sense). Both "halos" and "haloes" may be used as plural forms, and halo may be used as a verb.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]] original edition for "glory", "gloriole" and "halo".&lt;/ref&gt;  Halo comes originally from the Greek for "threshing-floor" – a circular, slightly sloping area kept very clean, around which slaves or oxen walked to thresh the grain.  In Greek, this came to mean the divine bright disk.

Nimbus means a cloud in Latin and is found as a divine cloud in 1616, whereas as "a bright or golden disk surrounding the head" it does not appear until 1727.  The plural "nimbi" is correct but "rare"; "nimbuses" is not in the OED but sometimes used. "Nimb" is an obsolete form of the noun, but not a verb, except that the obsolete "nimbated", like the commoner "nimbate", means "furnished with a nimbus".  It is sometimes preferred by art-historians, as sounding more technical than halo.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]] original edition for "nimbus" etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Aureole", from the Latin for "golden", has been used in English as a term for a gold crown, especially that traditionally considered the reward of [[martyr]]s, since the Middle Ages (OED 1220).  But the first use recorded as a term for a halo is in 1848, very shortly after which matters were greatly complicated by the publication in 1851 of the English translation of [[Adolphe Napoléon Didron]]'s important ''Christian Iconography: Or, The History of Christian Art in the Middle Ages''.  This, by what the OED calls a "strange blunder", derived the word from the Latin "aura" as a diminutive, and also defined it as meaning a halo or glory covering the whole body, whilst saying that "nimbus" referred only to a halo around the head.  This, according to the OED, reversed the historical usage of both words, but whilst Didron's diktat was "not accepted in France", the OED noted it had already been picked up by several English dictionaries, and influenced usage in English, which still seems to be the case, as the word "nimbus" is mostly found describing whole-body haloes, and seems to have also influenced "gloriole" in the same direction.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]] original edition for "aureole".&lt;/ref&gt;

The only English term that unequivocally means a full-body halo, and cannot be used for a circular disk around the head is "[[mandorla]]", first occurring in 1883.  However, this term, which is the Italian word for "[[almond]]", is usually reserved for the [[vesica piscis]] shape, at least in describing Christian art.  In discussing Asian art, it is used more widely.&lt;ref&gt;For example by Sickman and Soper, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;  Otherwise, there could be said to be an excess of words that could refer to either a head-disk or a full-body halo, and no word that clearly denotes a full-body halo that is not vesica piscis shaped.  "Halo" by itself, according to recent dictionaries,&lt;ref&gt;Concise Oxford Dictionary, 1995, and Collins English Dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt; means only a circle around the head, although Rhie and Thurman use the word also for circular full-body aureoles.&lt;ref&gt;op &amp; pages cit.  The Catholic Encyclopedia of 1911 (link above) has a further set of meanings for these terms, including glory.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hauora.svg|thumb|Diagram of a [[whare]], named with domains of Hauora.]]
The '''Hauora''' is a [[Māori people|Māori]] [[philosophy]] of [[health]] and [[well-being]] unique to [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tki.org.nz/r/health/curriculum/statement/page31_e.php Te Kete Ipurangi (TKI) – The Online Learning Centre]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four dimensions of Hauora; Taha Tinana (Physical Wellbeing - health), Taha Hinengaro (Mental &amp; Emotional wellbeing - self-confidence), Taha Whanau (Social Wellbeing - self-esteem) and Taha Wairua (Spiritual wellbeing - personal beliefs) There is physical, emotional/mental, social and spiritual caring.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuff.co.nz/timaru-herald/entertainment/attitude/8221630/Chant-grab-their-chances Chant grab their chances]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Whare Tapa Wha model represents aspects of Hauora as the four walls of a [[Wharenui|whare]], each wall representing a different dimension. All four dimensions are necessary for strength and stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Durie|first1=Mason|title=Whaiora; Maori Health Development|date=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Other models of Hauora have been designed. For example, in 1997, Moeau suggested that a fifth dimension, [[Tangata whenua|whenua]] (connection with the land), be added to the original model. In 2001, Hokowhitu also tried to have whenua added to the Tapawha model but again it was not added.

The Hauora has been integrated into [[primary school|primary]] and [[secondary school]]s in New Zealand to allow students to learn and understand the traditional Māori aspects of well-being.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1240">The term '''hill-slope enclosure''' describes a type of late prehistoric [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthwork]] found across South West England and also in Wales. Normally formed from a single bank, or [[Ditch (fortification)|ditch]] and bank, enclosing an area of less than 1 hectare, and not on the summit of a hill. They are often found on a [[Spur (topography)|spur]] of a larger hill or range of hills.&lt;ref name="Riley"&gt;{{cite book|last=Riley|first=Hazel|title=The Historic Landscape of the Quantock Hills|publisher=English Heritage|isbn=978-1905624294|pages=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original purpose of the hill-slope enclosure is obscure but it is thought that they were not primarily defensive structures. Surveys and excavations have revealed low densities of [[posthole]]s and [[Storage pit (archaeology)|storage pits]] suggesting they functioned as defensible farmsteads and permanent livestock enclosures.&lt;ref name="Riley"/&gt;

They may also have served different purposes at different times and they may have had symbolic and religious significance which is now impossible to determine.&lt;ref name="Riley"/&gt;

[[File:Tyranov - Young Housewife.jpg|thumb|''Young Housewife'', Oil on canvas, by [[Alexey Tyranov]] (1801–1859), in the [[Russian Museum]], [[Saint Petersburg|St Petersburg]], [[Russia]]]]

A '''housewife''' (also known as a '''homekeeper''') is a woman whose work is running or managing her family's home—caring for her [[children]]; buying, [[cooking]], and [[Food preservation|storing]] food for the family; buying [[Good (economics)|goods]] that the family needs in everyday life; [[housekeeping]] and maintaining the home; and [[Sewing|making]] clothes for the family—and who is not employed outside the home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/american/housewife|website= Macmillan Dictionary |title=Housewife}}&lt;/ref&gt; A housewife may also be called a '''stay-at-home mother'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stayathomemum.com.au|website=StayAtHomeMum|title=Home page}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a househusband may be called a "male homemaker" or [[stay-at-home dad|stay-at-home father]].

''[[Webster's Dictionary]]'' describes a housewife as a married woman who is in charge of her [[household]]. The British ''Chambers's Twentieth Century Dictionary'' (1901) defined a housewife as: "the mistress of a household; a female domestic manager; a pocket sewing kit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Davidson, Thomas (ed.)|title=Chambers's Twentieth Century Dictionary of the English Language|location=London|publisher= W. &amp; R. Chambers|page=443}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small sewing kit is sometimes called a "housewife" or "'''hussif'''".&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|housewife|id=88947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout history, women have usually worked for pay, either by contributing to farming and other family-owned businesses or working for other employers.  Housewives were common in developed countries only for a few decades during the middle of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

  | isbn = 978-0-88961-062-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and non-feminist [[economist]]s (particularly proponents of [[historical materialism]], the methodological approach of [[Marxist historiography]]) note that the value of housewives' work is ignored in standard formulations of economic output, such as [[GDP]] or [[employment]] figures. Housewives work many unpaid hours a week, often depending on income from their husband's employment for financial support.

===Traditional societies===
[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-46-45.jpg|thumb|A housewife in Yendi, [[Kumasi]], Ghana, pours water into a meal and her children play; 1957]]
In societies of [[Hunter-gatherer|hunters and gatherers]] like the traditional society of the Australian aboriginal people, the men hunt animals for meat, and the women gather other foods such as [[grain]], [[fruit]] and [[vegetable]]s. One of the reasons for this division of labor was that it is much easier to look after a baby while gathering fruit than while hunting a fast-moving animal. Even when homes were very simple and there were few possessions, men and women did different jobs.

In rural societies, where the main work is [[farming]], women have also taken care of gardens and animals around the house, generally helping men with heavy work when a job needed to be done quickly, usually because of the season.

Examples of the heavy work that a traditional housewife (homemaker) in a ''rural society'' would do are:
* Picking fruit when it was ripe for market
* Planting rice in a [[rice|paddy field]]
* Harvesting and stacking grain
* Cutting hay

In rural studies, the word ''housewife'' is occasionally used for a woman who does the majority of the chores within a farm's [[Compound (enclosure)|compound]] as opposed to field and livestock work{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}.

===Modern society===
A career woman may follow a "[[mommy track]]", or a [[shared earning/shared parenting marriage]].

Regarding [[Family#Size|family size]], a study of three [[Mexico|Mexican]] cities came to the result that there was no significant difference in the number of children in housewife families compared to those where women worked outside of the home part or full-time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Chant | first=Sylvia | title=Women and Survival in Mexican Cities: perspectives on gender, labour markets, and low-income households | publisher=Manchester University Press Distributed in the USA and Canada by St. Martin's Press | location=Manchester, UK; New York, NY, USA | year=1991 | isbn=0-7190-3443-4 | ref=harv}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=bPTPAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA128 Page 128]&lt;/ref&gt;

It has become more commonplace for the husband and wife to both be employed outside of the home and for both to share in the "housework" and caring for the children.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Full-time homemakers usually share in the income produced by members of the household who are employed; wage-earners working full-time benefit from the unpaid work provided by the housewife; otherwise, the performance of such work (child care, cooking, housecleaning, teaching, transporting, etc.) could be a household expense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/whats-a-wife-worth/Content?oid=871934|title=What's a Wife Worth?|date=17 March 1988|accessdate=17 Oct 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Community property]] states recognize joint ownership of marital property and income, and unless a prenuptial or postnuptial agreement is followed, most marital households in the US operate as a joint financial team and file [[taxes]] jointly.

===Education===
The method, necessity and extent of education of house wives has been debated since at least the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dement|first1=Alice L.|title=Higher Education of the Housewife: Wanted or Wasted?|journal=The Journal of Higher Education|date=1960|volume=31|issue=1 (January)|doi=10.2307/1977571|jstor=1977571|publisher=Ohio State University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mummy, I want to be a housewife|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/mummy-i-want-to-be-a-housewife/93431.article|accessdate=8 May 2016|work=Times Higher Education|date=26 April 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic1114896.files/Najmabadi%201998.pdf|title=Crafting an Educated Housewife in Iran}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/columnists/article3485879.ece|title=Highly educated housewives: what an economic waste|date=25 July 2012|work=The Times|accessdate=8 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Songs about the housewife's lot==
The housewife's tasks have often been the subject of songs. Examples include: "The Housewife's Lament" (from the diary of Sarah Price, Ottawa, Illinois, mid 19th century);&lt;ref&gt;Recorded on: ''The Female Frolic'', Argo ZDA 82 &amp; [[Peggy Seeger|Seeger, P.]] ''Penelope isn't Waiting any More'' Blackthorne BR 1050&lt;/ref&gt; "Nine Hours a Day" (1871 English song, anonymous); "A Woman's Work is Never Done"&lt;ref&gt;Recorded on [[Sam Richards (writer)|Staverton Bridge]] SADISC SDL 266&lt;/ref&gt; or "A Woman Never Knows When her Day's Work is Done"; "The Labouring Woman"; "How Five and Twenty Shillings were Expended in a Week" (English popular songs); "A Woman's Work" (London music hall song by Sue Pay, 1934).&lt;ref&gt;Kathy Henderson et al., comp. (1979) ''My Song is My Own: 100 women's songs''. London: Pluto; pp. 126-28, 142-43&lt;/ref&gt; "The Housewife's Alphabet", by [[Peggy Seeger]], was issued as a Blackthorne Records single with "My Son".&lt;ref&gt;''New City Songster''; vol. 13, Oct. 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

===In China===
In [[Imperial era of Chinese history|imperial China]] (excluding periods of the [[Tang dynasty]]), women were bound to homemaking by the doctrines of [[Confucianism]] and cultural norms. Generally, girls did not attend school and, therefore, spent the day doing household chores with their mothers and female relatives (for example, [[cooking]] and [[Housekeeping|cleaning]]). In most cases, the husband was alive and able to work, so the wife was almost always forbidden to take a job and mainly spent her days at home or doing other domestic tasks. As Confucianism spread across [[East Asia]], this social norm was also observed in [[Korea]], [[Japan]] and [[Vietnam]]. As [[foot binding]] became common after the [[Song Dynasty]], many women lost the ability to work outside.

After the founding of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] in 1911, these norms were gradually loosened and many women were able to enter the workforce. Shortly thereafter, a growing number of females began to be permitted to attend schools. Starting with the rule of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949, all women were freed from compulsory family roles. During the [[Great Leap Forward]] and [[Cultural Revolution]], some women even worked in fields that were traditionally reserved for males.

In modern China, housewives are no longer as common, especially in the largest cities and other urban areas.  Many modern women work simply because one person's income is insufficient to support the family, a decision made easier by the fact that it is common for Chinese grandparents to watch after their grandchildren until they are old enough to go to school. Nonetheless, the number of Chinese housewives has been steadily rising in recent years as China's economy expands.{{dubious|date=February 2017}}

===In India===

In a traditional [[Hindu]] family, the head of the family is the ''Griha Swami'' (Lord of the House) and his wife is the ''Griha Swamini'' (Lady of the House). The [[Sanskrit]] words ''Grihast'' and ''Grihasta'' perhaps come closest to describing the entire gamut of activities and roles undertaken by the homemaker. ''Grih'' is the Sanskrit root for house or home; Grihasta and Grihast are derivatives of this root, as is [[Grihastya]]. The couple lives in the state called ''Grihastashram'' or family system and together they nurture the family and help its members (both young and old) through the travails of life. The woman who increments the family tree (bears children) and protects those children is described as the ''Grihalakshmi'' (the wealth of the house) and ''Grihashoba'' (the glory of the house). The elders of the family are known as ''Grihshreshta''. The husband or wife may engage in countless other activities which may be social, religious, political or economic in nature for the ultimate welfare of the family and society. However, their unified status as joint householders is the nucleus from within which they operate in society. The traditional status of a woman as a homemaker anchors them in society and provides meaning to their activities within the social, religious, political and economic framework of their world. However, as India undergoes modernisation, many women are in employment, particularly in the larger cities such as [[Mumbai]], [[Delhi]], [[Kolkata]], [[Chennai]], [[Hyderabad]], [[Bangalore]] where most women will work. The role of the male homemaker is not traditional in [[India]], but it is socially accepted in [[urban area|urban]] areas. According to one sociologist's study in 2006, twelve percent of unmarried Indian men would consider being a homemaker according to a survey conducted by ''[[Business Today (business magazine)|Business Today]]''.&lt;ref name="life&amp;times"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://specials.indiatoday.com/indianmensurvey/Unmarried_Man_partner.php|title=Life &amp; Times of Indian Men|date=July 29, 2009|publisher=Business Today|accessdate=2009-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; One sociologist, Sushma Tulzhapurkar, called this a shift in Indian society, saying that a decade ago, "it was an unheard concept and not to mention socially unacceptable for men to give up their jobs and remain at home."&lt;ref name="dias"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/NEWS/City/Bombay-Times/Now-papas-do-what-mamas-did-best-/articleshow/1682154.cms|title=Now papas do what mamas did best!|last=Dias|first=Raul|date=June 26, 2006|publisher=Times of India|accessdate=2009-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, only 22.7 percent of Indian women are part of the [[labor force]], compared to 51.6 percent of men; thus, women are more likely to be caregivers because most do not work outside the home.&lt;ref name="fao"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/sd/wpdirect/WPre0108.htm|title=Asia's women in agriculture, environment and rural production|accessdate=2009-07-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630002611/http://www.fao.org/sd/wpdirect/WPre0108.htm|archivedate=2014-06-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Korea===

====North Korea====
Until around 1990, the [[North Korea]]n state required every able-bodied male to be employed by some [[state enterprise]]. However, some 30% of married women of working age were allowed to stay at home as full-time housewives (less than in some countries in the same region like South Korea, Japan and [[Taiwan]]; more than in the former [[Soviet Union]], [[Mainland China]] and Nordic countries like Sweden, and about the same as in the United States&lt;ref&gt;[http://article.yeeyan.org/view/91830/133129 a Chinese-English translation web (译言网）:Will Chinese women rule the world?]&lt;/ref&gt;). In the early 1990s, after an estimated 900,000-3,500,000 people perished in the [[North Korean famine]], the old system began to fall apart. In some cases women began by selling homemade food or household items they could do without. Today at least three-quarters of North Korean market vendors are women. A joke making the rounds in [[Pyongyang]] goes: 'What do a [[husband]] and a pet dog have in common?' Answer: 'Neither works nor earns money, but both are cute, stay at home and can scare away burglars.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cuyoo.com/html/guoji/2010/0422/14322.html |author=Andrei Lankov (a professor in South Korea National University)|work= cuyoo.com (Chinese-English Translate Web|title= Pyongyang’s Women Wear the Pants}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two British magazines for housewives have been published: ''The Housewife'' (London: Offices of "The Million", 1886[1900]) and ''Housewife'' (London: Hultons, 1939–68).&lt;ref&gt;Held by various libraries in the UK; [http://copac.ac.uk Copac]&lt;/ref&gt;

"On a Tired Housewife" is an anonymous poem about the housewife's lot:

&lt;poem&gt;
Here lies a poor woman who was always tired,
She lived in a house where help wasn't hired:
Her last words on earth were: "Dear friends, I am going
To where there's no cooking, or washing, or sewing,
For everything there is exact to my wishes,
For where they don't eat there's no washing of dishes.
I'll be where loud anthems will always be ringing,
But having no voice I'll be quit of the singing.
Don't mourn for me now, don't mourn for me never,
I am going to do nothing for ever and ever."&lt;ref&gt;''The Penguin Book of Comic and Curious Verse'', ed. J. M. Cohen. Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1952; p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;

About 50% of married US women in 1978 continued to work after giving birth, while in 1997, the number was 61%. The number of housewives increased in the 2000s. With the [[2008 financial crisis]], a decrease in average income made two incomes more attractive, and the percentage of married US women who kept working after they giving birth increased to 69% by 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/news.release/famee.nr0.htm Employment Characteristics of Families Summary". U.S. Department of Labor. Retrieved 2011-10-22.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://article.yeeyan.org/view/91830/133129 a Chinese-English translation web (译言网: Will Chinese women rule the world?]&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, according to the Pew Research Center, more than one in four mothers are stay at home in the United States.

Housewives in America were typical in the middle of the 20th century among middle-class and upper-class white families.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://longreads.com/2018/03/21/seeking-a-roadmap-for-the-new-american-middle-class/|title=Seeking a Roadmap for the New American Middle Class|last=Gershon|first=Livia|date=2018-03-21|work=Longreads|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Black families, recent immigrants, and other minority groups tended not to benefit from the union wages, government policies, and other factors that led to white wives being able to stay at home during these decades.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A 2005 study estimated that 31 percent of working mothers leave the workplace (for an average of 2.2 years), most often precipitated by the birth of the second child.&lt;ref&gt;Hewlett, S. A., Luce, C. B., Shiller, P. &amp; Southwell, S. (2005, March). The hidden brain drain: Off-ramps and on-ramps in women’s careers. Center for WorkLife. Policy/Harvard Business Review Research. Report, Product no. 9491. Cambridge, MA: Harvard Business School Publishing Corporation.&lt;/ref&gt; This gives time to concentrate full-time on child-rearing and to avoid the high cost of child care, particularly through the early years (before school begins at age five). There is considerable variability within the stay-at-home mother population with regard to their intent to return to the paid workforce. Some plan to work from their homes, some will do part-time work, some intend to return to part or full-time work when their children have reached school age, some may increase their skill sets by returning to higher education, and others may find it financially feasible to refrain from entering (or re-entering) the paid workforce. Research has linked feelings of "maternal guilt and separation anxiety" to returning to the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, Stacey E., and H. Ray Wooten. "Highly educated stay-at-home mothers: A study of commitment and conflict." ''The Family Journal'' 15.4 (2007): 336-345.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, there is considerable variation in the stay-at-home mother's attitude towards domestic work not related to caring for children. Some may embrace a traditional role of housewife, cooking and cleaning in addition to caring for children. Others see their primary role as that of child-care providers, supporting their children's physical, intellectual, emotional, and spiritual development while sharing or outsourcing other aspects of home care.

==History==
Although men have generally been thought of as the primary [[breadwinner]]s for families in recent history, the division of labor between men and women in traditional societies required both genders to take an active role in obtaining resources outside the domestic sphere. Prior to discovering agriculture and animal husbandry, predictable food sources were a scarce commodity. To achieve optimal nutrition during this time, it was imperative that both men and women focus their energies on hunting and gathering as many different edible foods as possible to sustain themselves on a daily basis. Lacking the technologies necessary to store and preserve food, it was critical for men and women to seek out and obtain fresh food sources almost continuously. These nomadic tribes used gender differences to their advantage, allowing men and women to use their complementary adaptations and survival strategies to find the most diverse and nutritionally complete foods available. For example, in the context of daily foraging, childcare itself was not a hindrance to women's productivity; rather, performing this task with her children both increased the overall efficiency of the activity (more people participating equals a greater yield of edible roots, berries, nuts and plants), and functioned as an important hands-on lesson in survival skills for each child. By sharing the burden of daily sustenance – and developing specialized gender niches – humans not only ensured their continued survival, but also paved the way for later technologies to evolve and grow through experience.

In the 19th century, more and more women in industrialising countries stopped being homemakers and farm wives and began to undertake paid work in various industries outside the home and away from the family farm, in addition to the work they did at home. At this time many big [[factory|factories]] were set up, first in England then in other European countries and the United States. Many thousands of young women went to work in factories; most factories employed women in roles different from those occupied by men. There were also women who worked at home for low wages while caring for their children at the same time.

Being a housewife was only realistic among middle-class and upper-class families.  In working-class families, it was typical for women to work.  In the 19th century, a third to half of married women in England were recorded in the census as working for outside pay, and some historians believe this to be an undercount.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/13/working-women-stay-at-home-wives-myths|title=So wives didn't work in the 'good old days'?

Women were often very proud to be a good homemaker and have their house and children respectably taken care of.  Other women, like [[Florence Nightingale]], pursued non-factory professions even though they were wealthy enough that they did not need the income. Some professions open to women were also restricted to unmarried women, e.g., teaching.

In the early 20th century, both world wars ([[World War I]], 1914–18, and [[World War II]], 1939-45) were fought by men from many countries. (There were also special roles in the armed forces carried out by women, e.g. nursing, transport, etc. and in some countries women soldiers also.) While the men were at war, many of their womenfolk went to work to keep the countries running. Women, who were also homemakers, worked in factories, businesses and farms. At the end of both wars, many men had died, and others had returned injured. Some men were able to return to their previous positions, but some women stayed in the workforce as well. In addition to this surge in women entering the workforce, convenience food and technology were also rising in popularity, both of which saved women time that they may have spent performing domestic tasks, and enabled them to instead pursue other interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite | last = Maurer | first = Elizabeth | title = "How Highly Processed Foods Liberated 1950s Housewives" | publisher = National Women's History Museum | year = 2017 | url = https://www.womenshistory.org/articles/how-highly-processed-foods-liberated-1950s-housewives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The governments of [[Communist]] countries in the early and middle 20th century such as the Soviet Union and China encouraged married women to keep working after giving birth. There were very few housewives in Communist countries until [[Post-communism|free market economic reform]] in the 1990s, which led to a resurgence in the number of housewives. Conversely, in the [[Western World]] of the 1950s, many women quit their jobs to be housewives after giving birth. Only 11% of married women in the US kept working after giving birth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doc88.com/p-57886790766.html In the kitchen debate in 1959: Nixon said American housewives are happier than the Soviet Union working women]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s in western countries, it was becoming more accepted for a woman to work until she got married, when it was widely held that she should stop work and be a housewife. Many women believed that this was not treating men and women [[gender equality|equally]] and that women should do whatever jobs they were able to do, whether they were married or not. ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'', a 1963 book by [[Betty Friedan]] which is widely credited with sparking the beginning of [[second-wave feminism]] in the United States, discussed among other things the lives of housewives from around the United States who were unhappy despite living in material comfort and being married with children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/feminine-mystique/summary |title=The Feminine Mystique Summary |publisher=Enotes.com |accessdate=2011-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes2006"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/05/national/05friedan.html Betty Friedan, Who Ignited Cause in 'Feminine Mystique,' Dies at 85] - ''The New York Times,'' February 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, many women were becoming more educated. As a result of this increased education, some women were able to earn more than their husbands. In very rare cases, the husband would remain at home to raise their young children while the wife worked. In 1964 a US stamp was issued honoring homemakers for the 50th anniversary of the [[Smith-Lever Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nwhm.org/online-exhibits/stamps/homemakers.html|title=Leaving Their Stamp on History|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906064904/https://www.nwhm.org/online-exhibits/stamps/homemakers.html|archivedate=2015-09-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arago.si.edu/category_2034154.html|title=Arago: Homemakers Issue|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 20th century, in many countries it became harder for a family to live on a single wage. Subsequently, many women were required to return to work following the birth of their children. However, the number of male homemakers began gradually increasing in the late 20th century, especially in developed Western nations. In 2010, the number of male homemakers had reached its highest point of 2.2 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2014/06/05/growing-number-of-dads-home-with-the-kids/|title=Growing Number of Dads Home with the Kids|last=Livingston|first=Gretchen|website=Pew Research Center’s Social &amp; Demographic Trends Project|access-date=2016-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the role is subject to many [[stereotype]]s, and men may have difficulties accessing parenting benefits, communities, and services targeted at mothers, it became more socially acceptable by the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrea Doucet]], 2006.

However, in some regions of the world the male homemaker remains culturally unacceptable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4196">'''Irrigation informatics''' is a newly emerging academic field that is a cross-disciplinary science using [[informatics]] to study the information flows and data management related to [[irrigation]]. The field is one of many new informatics sub-specialities that uses the science of information, the practice of information processing, and the engineering of information systems to advance a biophysical science or engineering field.

== Background ==
Agricultural productivity increases are eagerly sought by governments and industry, spurred by the realisation that world food production must double in the 21st century to feed growing populations&lt;ref name="madramootoo1"&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ird.555/pdf], Madramootoo, C.A. and Fyles, H. 2010. Irrigation in the context of today's global food crisis, Irrig. and Drain. 59: 40–52&lt;/ref&gt; and that as irrigation makes up 36% of global food production,&lt;ref name="fao2"&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/x0262e/x0262e01.htm], Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), Water and food security, retrieved Sept. 2010&lt;/ref&gt; but that new land for irrigation growth is very limited,&lt;ref name="meyer1"&gt;[http://www.irrigationfutures.org.au/news.asp?catID=10&amp;ID=291], Irrigation Futures CRC media release "Improving irrigated agriculture - how far can we go?", retrieved Sept. 2010&lt;/ref&gt; irrigation efficiency must increase. Since irrigation science is a mature and stable field, irrigation researchers are looking to cross-disciplinary science to bring about production gains and informatics is one such science along with others such as [[social sciences|social science]]. Much of the driver for work in the area of irrigation informatics is the perceived success of other informatics fields such as [[health informatics]].

== Current research ==
Irrigation informatics is very much a part of the wider research into irrigation wherever [[information technology]] or data systems are used, however the term ''informatics'' is not always used to describe research involving computer systems and data management so that ''information science'' or ''information technology'' may alternatively be used. This leads to a great number of irrigation informatics articles not using the term ''irrigation informatics''. There are currently no formal publications (journals) that focus on ''irrigation informatics'' with the publication most likely to present articles on the topic being [http://www.elsevier.com/locate/compag/ Computers and electronics in Agriculture] or one of the many irrigation science journals such as [http://www.springerlink.com/openurl.asp?genre=journal&amp;issn=0342-7188 Irrigation Science].

Recent work in the general area of irrigation informatics has mentioned the exact phrase "Irrigation Informatics" with at least one publication in scientific conference proceedings using it in its title.&lt;ref name="car1"&gt;[http://www.mssanz.org.au/MODSIM07/papers/2_s44/TowardsANewGeneration_s44_Car_.pdf], Car, N. J., Christen, E. W., Hornbuckle, J. W. and Moore, G. 2007. Towards a new generation of Irrigation Decision Support Systems - Irrigation Informatics?. In "MODSIM 2007 International Congress on Modelling and Simulation". Christchurch, New Zealand&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current implementations ==
Meteorological informatics, as with all informatics, are increasingly being used to handle the growing volumes of data that are available from sensors, remote sensing and scientific models. The Australian [[Bureau of Meteorology (Australia)|Bureau of Meteorology]] has recently implemented an XML data format, known as the [[Water data transfer format|Water Data Transfer Format]] (WDTF) and standard to be used by Australian government agencies and meteorological data suppliers when delivering data to the Bureau. This format includes specifications for [[evapotranspiration]] and other weather parameters that are useful for irrigation and may be used through implementations of irrigation informatics.

'''Markus Breitschmid''' (born 20 April 1966, [[Lucerne]], Switzerland) is a Swiss [[architectural theoretician]] and author. He has lived and worked in the USA since the 1990s, and is a [[permanent resident]] of the USA. Breitschmid, together with the [[architect]] [[Valerio Olgiati]], has introduced the term [[Non-Referential Architecture]] into the architectural discourse.

==Biography==
Breitschmid is a [[professor]] of [[architecture]] at [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University]] ([[Virginia Tech]]) since 2004. Previously, among other academic appointments, he was the "2003 Visiting Historian for the [[History of Architecture]] and Urbanism" at [[Cornell University]] and taught at the [[University of North Carolina]]. He has been a visiting lecturer and visiting critic at many universities, museums, and professional associations in America, Europe, and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archdesign.vt.edu/faculty/markus-breitschmid Virginia Tech Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Breitschmid received his architectural education in Switzerland, the United States and Germany. He is a registered architect in Switzerland and a member of the Swiss Institute of Architects and Engineers. He received his [[Philosophiae Doctor]] (Ph.D.) in Engineering Science from the [[Technische Universität Berlin]], where he was the first doctoral student of the architectural theoretician [[Fritz Neumeyer]], the pre-eminent [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]]-scholar.&lt;ref&gt;Markus Breitschmid: Der bauende Geist. Friedrich Nietzsche und die Architektur. Luzern: Quart Verlag, 2001, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings on Architecture== 
Breitschmid's writing concerns the aesthetic mentality of [[modernism]] and [[contemporary architecture]]. Among other subjects, Breitschmid has written books on the German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s thoughts on building, the work of Swiss architect Valerio Olgiati, and on [[Non-Referential Architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;A+U. Architecture and Urbanism. No. 12, Tokyo: A+U Publishing Co., Ltd, 2012, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Breitschmid submitted his doctoral dissertation "Der Baugedanke bei Friedrich Nietzsche" at the Technische Universität Berlin in 1999; it was subsequently published as a German-language book titled "Der bauende Geist. Friedrich Nietzsche und die Architektur" (The Building Spirit. Friedrich Nietzsche and Architecture). Together with books on Nietzsche by [[Fritz Neumeyer]] and [[Tilmann Buddensieg]], "Der bauende Geist" became the foundation for scholarship on the subject of Nietzsche and architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmut Mayer: Mimesis und moderne Architektur. Eine architekturtheoretische Neubewertung. Bielefeld: transcript Verlag, 2017, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ole W. Fischer: Nietzsches Schatten: Henry van de Velde - von Philosophie zu Form. Berlin: Gebrüder Mann Verlag, 2012, pp. 12-14.&lt;/ref&gt; "Der bauende Geist" was included in Hanno-Walter Kruft's "A History of Architectural Theory from Vitruvius to the Present" for the revised 2013 edition.&lt;ref&gt;Hanno-Walter Kruft: Die Geschichte der Architekturtheorie - Von der Antike zur Gegenwart. München: Verlag C.H. Beck, (1985) 2013, p 703.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, Breitschmid's publications have dealt with such subjects as Contemporary Swiss Architecture,&lt;ref&gt;Markus Breitschmid. Three Architects in Switzerland: Beat Consoni – Morger &amp; Degelo – Valerio Olgiati. Lucerne: Quart Publishers 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Markus Breitschmid [with Victoria Easton].

Eduard Fuehr (ed.), Cottbus: No. 2/2007, pp. 162-171.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Markus Breitschmid. “Architecture &amp; Philosophy: Thoughts on Building” in: Designing Design Education. Amsterdam: Designtrain, 2008, pp. 138-147.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2006, Breitschmid has made a name for himself by means of a sustained collaboration with architect Valerio Olgiati on numerous publications that took on the form of books, essays, and interviews.&lt;ref&gt;Breitschmid, Markus. The Significance of the Idea – Die Bedeutung der Idee. Sulgen: Niggli Verlag, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Markus Breitschmid. Valerio Olgiati – Conversation with Students. Blacksburg: Virginia Tech Architecture Publications, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Markus Breitschmid. “El Repertorio Conceptual de Valerio Olgiati - Valerio Olgiati’s Ideational Inventory” in: Valerio Olgiati 1996-2011. Afinados Discordancias – Hamonized Discodances. Enrique Marquez (ed.). Madrid: [[El Croquis]] Editorial, 2011, pp. 6-29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Markus Breitschmid. “One Question for the Architect Who Does Not Believe in Anything” in: Architecture + Urbanism Tokyo: 12/2012, pp. 44-47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Markus Breitschmid. “Un’architettura che, in fondo, e ‘solo’ astratta” in: [[Casabella]]. No.770. Francesco Dal Co (ed.), Milano: Mondadori, 2008, pp. 8-9; 107-108.&lt;/ref&gt; In her 2012 book "Forms of Practice", the Rumanian-British architecture historian Irina Davidovici argues that the thesis "The Significance of the Idea" – that Breitschmid used to describe Olgiati's œuvre – is pertinent for all of the contemporary architecture of “post-Enlightenment culture.”&lt;ref&gt;Irina Davidovici. Forms of Practice. German-Swiss Architecture 1980-2000. Zurich: gta Verlag, pp. 10-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2013, Olgiati and Breitschmid propagate Non-Referential Architecture as a response to a contemporary societal current that increasingly rejects ideologies of any kind, political and otherwise. The first use of the term Non-Referential appears in a reprint of an interview between Olgiati and Breitschmid in the Italian journal Domus.&lt;ref&gt;Valerio Olgiati [in an interview with Markus Breitschmid], “Sulla non referezialita” in: Domus No. 974, Milano: 13/2013, pp. 45–46.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Breitschmid published a rebuttal titled "Architecture is Derived from Architecture" (published in German language) in the Swiss journal Werk, Bauen + Wohnen, thereby responding to an architectural claim made by others that attempts to imbue meaning into architecture from the extra-architectural.&lt;ref&gt;Markus Breitschmid. “Architektur leitet sich von Architektur ab” in: Werk, Bauen + Wohnen, Zurich: 9/2014, 45-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Breitschmid and Olgiati published the book Non-Referential Architecture, a treatise on contemporary architecture. It analyses the societal currents of the early 21st century and argues that those currents are radically different from the epoch of [[postmodernity]]. The book proposes a new framework for architecture and defines the seven underlying principles – 1) Experience of Space, 2) Oneness, 3) Newness, 4) Construction, 5) Contradiction, 6) Order, 7) Sensemaking – for a Non-Referential Architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Non-Referential Architecture. Ideated by Valerio Olgiati; Written by Markus Breitschmid. Basel: Simonett &amp; Baer, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Micrography''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]], literally small-writing – "Μικρογραφία"), also called '''microcalligraphy''', is a [[Jew]]ish form of [[calligram]]s developed in the 9th century, with parallels in Christianity and Islam,&lt;ref&gt;[http://expositions.bnf.fr/parole/grand/134.htm Torah, Bible, Coran] (French)&lt;/ref&gt; utilizing minute [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew letters]] to form representational, geometric and abstract designs. Colored micrography is especially distinctive because these rare artworks are customarily rendered in black and white.

== Description ==
The artwork is created from text that forms an image when viewed at a distance, creating an interplay between the text and image. The [[photomosaic]], whose tiny individual images form a mosaic when viewed from a distance, is a modern analogue.

== Motivation ==
{{see also|Calligram}}
[[File:Caligrafia arabe pajaro.jpg|thumb|An Arabic [[calligram]] in the form of a peacock.]]
There is a relationship between this form of art, employing both digital and analogic symbols, and the restrictions on images found in the [[Ten commandments#Traditional division and interpretation|second commandment]]. Micrography provides a unique solution to the visual artist who wishes to remain devout in observation of [[Jewish law]], by using only text, not images per se. As similar restrictions exist in certain [[Islam|Muslim]] societies, this solution has been adapted in [[Islamic calligraphy]] to the [[Arabic alphabet]] as well.

{{Ancient Roman religion}}
'''Numen''', pl. '''numina''',  is a [[Latin]] term for "[[divinity]]", or a "divine presence", "divine will." The Latin authors defined it as follows.&lt;ref name=lewisnumen&gt;For a more extensive account, refer to {{cite encyclopedia | author1=Charlton T.

It causes the motions and cries of birds during augury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Cicero | title=De Divinatione | at=I.119-120 | publisher=Loeb Classical Library; penelope.uchicago.edu | url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cicero/de_Divinatione/1*.html}} {{cite web | author=Marci Tulli Ciceronis | title=De divinatione Prior | language=Latin | at=I.119-120 | publisher=The Latin Library | url=http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cicero/divinatione1.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Virgil]]'s recounting of the blinding of the one-eyed giant, [[Polyphemus]], from the Odyssey, in his [[Aeneid]], he has Odysseus and his men first "ask for the assistance of the great numina" (''magna precati numina'').&lt;ref&gt;3. 634.&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing public opinion of [[Augustus]] on the day of his funeral, the historian [[Tacitus]] reports that some thought "no honor was left to the gods" when he "established the cult of himself" (''se ... coli vellet'') "with temples and the effigies of numina" (''effigie numinum'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=C.

Lucretius Carus, ''De Natura rerum'', 3.144.&lt;/ref&gt; or "bidding of the mind,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author1=Lucretius |title=On the Nature of Things | author2=R. Allison, Translator | publisher=Arthur Humphries | location=London | year=1919}}&lt;/ref&gt; where "bidding" is ''numen'', not, however, the divine numen, unless the mind is to be considered divine, but as simply human will.&lt;ref name=lewisnumen/&gt;

Since the early 20th century, numen has sometimes been treated in the [[History of religions|history of religion]] as a [[animism|pre-animistic]] phase; that is, a belief system inherited from an earlier time. ''Numen'' is also used by [[sociologists]] to refer to the idea of magical power residing in an [[magical object|object]], particularly when writing about ideas in the western tradition. When used in this sense, ''numen'' is nearly synonymous with ''[[mana]]''. However, some authors reserve use of ''mana'' for ideas about [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] from [[Polynesia]] and southeast [[Asia]].

==Etymology==
Etymologically, the word means "a nod of the head", here referring to a [[deity]] as it were "nodding", or making its will or its presence known). According to [[H. J. Rose]]: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The literal meaning is simply "a nod", or more accurately, for it is a passive formation, "that which is produced by nodding", just as ''flamen'' is "that which is produced by blowing", ''i.e.'', a gust of wind. It came to mean "the product or expression of power" — not, be it noted, power itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rose|first=H. J.|title=Primitive Culture in Italy|year=1926|publisher=Methuen &amp; Co.|pages=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus, ''numen'' (divinity) is not personified (although it can be a personal attribute) and should be distinguished from ''[[deus]]'' (god).&lt;ref name="Bailey"&gt;{{cite book| last=Bailey| first=Cyril |title=The Religion of Ancient Rome |year=1907|publisher=Archibald Constable &amp; Co Ltd| url =http://www.gutenberg.org/files/18564/18564-h/18564-h.htm}}, freely available from [[Project Gutenberg]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman cults of the numina==
Numen was also used in the [[imperial cult (Ancient Rome)|imperial cult]] of ancient Rome, to refer to the [[Genius (mythology)#Imperial genii|guardian-spirit]], 'godhead' or divine power of a living emperor—in other words, a means of worshiping a living emperor without literally calling him a god.&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt;

The [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|cult]] of [[Augustus]] was promoted by [[Tiberius]], who dedicated the ''Ara Numinis Augusti''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fishwick|first=Duncan|title=''Genius'' and ''Numen''|journal = Harvard Theological Review|volume = 62| issue = 3| pages = 356–367| date = July 1969| doi=10.1017/s0017816000032405}} Reprinted in Fishwick, D. (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;
In this context, a distinction can be made between the terms ''numen'' and ''[[Genius (mythology)|genius]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fishwick|first=Duncan|title='Numina Augustorum|journal = The Classical Quarterly |series=New Series|volume = 20| issue = 1| pages = 191–197| date = May 1970| doi=10.1017/s0009838800044773}} Reprinted in Fishwick, D. (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition as a pre-animistic phase of religion==
The expression ''Numen inest'' appears in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'' (III, 296) and has been translated as 'There is a spirit here'.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid. Fasti. Translated by Frazer, James George. Loeb Classical Library Volume. Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; London, William Heinemann Ltd. 1931.&lt;/ref&gt; Its interpretation, and in particular the exact sense of ''numen'' has been discussed extensively in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rose|first=Herbert Jennings|title=Nvmen inest: 'Animism' in Greek and Roman Religion|journal = Harvard Theological Review|volume = 28| issue = 4| pages = 237–257| date = October 1935| doi=10.1017/s0017816000023026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The supposition that a ''numinous presence'' in the natural world supposed in the earliest layers of [[Ancient peoples of Italy|Italic]] religion, as it were an "[[animism|animistic]]" element left over in historical Roman religion and especially in the etymology of Latin theonyms, has often been popularly implied, but was criticised as "mostly a scholarly fiction" by McGeough (2004).&lt;ref&gt;Kevin McGeough ''The Romans: new perspectives'' 2004:179 "Numinous Forces and Other scholarly Inventions"; "Scholars may have to content themselves with nodes of meanings for the Italic gods rather than hard-and-fast definitions," observes Charles Robert Phillips III, in "A Note on Vergil's Aeneid 5, 744," ''Hermes'' '''104'''.2 (1976:247–249) p. 248, with recent bibliography; Gerhard Radke's classification of the forms and significances of these multifarious names in ''Die Götter Altitaliens'' (Münster, 1965) was criticized as "unwarranted precision" in the review by A. Drummond in ''The Classical Review'', New Series, '''21'''.2 (June 1971:239–241); the coupling and uncoupling of Latin and Italic [[cognomen|cognomina]] of the gods, creating the appearance of a multitude of deities, were classically dissected in Jesse Benedictus Carter, ''De Deorum Romanorum Cognominibus: Quaestiones Selectae'' (Leipzig, 1898).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Numina and specific religions==
The phrase "numen eris caeloque redux mirabere regna" appears on line 129 of the poem ''Metrum in Genesin'',&lt;ref name="KreuzPseudo-Hilary2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gottfried Kreuz|author2=Pseudo-Hilary|title=Pseudo-Hilarius Metrum in Genesin, Carmen de Evangelio: Einleitung, Text und Kommentar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LaEXAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=9 April 2012|year=2006|publisher=Verlag der Österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften|isbn=978-3-7001-3790-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; attributed to [[Hilary of Arles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pavlovskis|first=Zoja|title=The Pastoral World of Hilarius' "in Genesin"|journal = The Classical Journal|volume = 85| issue = 2| pages = 121–132| date = December 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{In popular culture|date=May 2017}}
In modern times, the term (referring to the Christian God) has been used in various expressions:

* ''Innocue vivito, numen adest'' (Live blameless; God is here.) was the motto of [[Linnaeus]],&lt;ref name="JacksonFries2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Benjamin Daydon Jackson|author2=Theodor Magnus Fries|title=Linnaeus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IWa-A--2LZEC|accessdate=9 April 2012|date=22 December 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-108-03723-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; taken from Ovid's [[Ars Amatoria]] (I, 640).
* ''[[Nil sine numine]]'' is the [[List of U.S. state mottos|state motto]] of [[Colorado]]. Its origin could be the phrase "...non haec sine numine divum eveniunt" (...these things do not come to pass without the will of Heaven) from [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'' (II, 777).
* ''Numen lumen'' (God is the light) is the motto of the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] and [[Elon University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=University of Wisconsin-Madison Unified |url=http://kb.wisc.edu/page.php?id=11472 |title=Numen Lumen / School Motto |publisher=Kb.wisc.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of tables of the '''oldest people''' in the world in ordinal ranks. To avoid including [[Longevity claims|false or unconfirmed claims of extreme old age]], names here are restricted to those people whose ages have been validated by an international body that specifically deals in longevity research, such as the [[Gerontology Research Group]] (GRG) or ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' (GWR), and others who have otherwise been [[WP:RS|reliably sourced]].

According to this criterion, the longest human lifespan is that of [[Jeanne Calment]] of [[France]] (1875–1997), who lived to the age of 122 years, 164 days. She met [[Vincent van Gogh]] when she was 12 or 13.&lt;ref name="Calment"&gt;{{cite news |last=Whitney |first=Craig R. |date=5 August 1997 |title=Jeanne Calment, World's Elder, Dies at 122 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E7D7113DF936A3575BC0A961958260 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received news media attention in 1985, after turning 110. Subsequent investigation found documentation for Calment's age, beyond any reasonable question, in the records of her native city, [[Arles]], France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |authors=[[Jean-Marie Robine|Robine, Jean-Marie]]; Allard, Michel |year=1999 |title=Jeanne Calment: Validation of the Duration of Her Life|url=http://www.demogr.mpg.de/books/odense/6/09.htm|location=Odense |publisher=[[University Press of Southern Denmark]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; More evidence of Calment's lifespan has been produced than for any other supercentenarian, such that her case serves as an archetype in the methodology for verifying the ages of the world's oldest people.&lt;ref name="Calmentthoroughly"&gt;{{cite web |last=Shaw |first=Michael D. |date=1 December 2008 |title=You Say You Want to Live for a Long Time? |url=http://www.gasdetection.com/news2/health_news_digest184.html |publisher=Health News Digest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Life_expectancy#Sex_differences|women live longer than men on average]], combined records for both sexes are predominated by women. The longest undisputed lifespan for a man is that of [[Jiroemon Kimura]] of [[Japan]] (1897–2013), who died at age 116 years, 54 days.

Since the death of 117-year-old Chiyo Miyako of Japan on 22 July 2018, 115-year-old [[Kane Tanaka]], also of Japan, born 2 January 1903, is the oldest living person in the world whose age has been documented. Since the death of 113-year-old [[List of Spanish supercentenarians#Francisco Núñez Olivera|Francisco Núñez Olivera]] of Spain on 29 January 2018, 113-year-old [[List of Japanese supercentenarians#Masazō Nonaka|Masazō Nonaka]] of Japan, born 25 July 1905, is the world's oldest verified living man.

'''Patient education''' is the process by which [[health professional]]s and others impart information to patients and their caregivers that will alter their health behaviors or improve their health status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://odphp.osophs.dhhs.gov/pubs/GUIDECPS/text/iv_edu.txt|title=iv. Patient Education and Counseling for Prevention|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421064558/http://odphp.osophs.dhhs.gov/pubs/GUIDECPS/text/iv_edu.txt|archivedate=April 21, 2014|deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Education may be provided by any healthcare professional who has undertaken appropriate training education, education on patient communication and education is usually included in the healthcare professional's training.

[[Health education]] is also a tool used by [[managed care]] plans, and may include both general [[Preventive medicine|preventive]] education or [[health promotion]] and disease or condition specific education.&lt;ref&gt;Peter R. Koongstvedt, "The Managed Health Care Handbook," Fourth Edition, Aspen Publishers, Inc., 2001, page 788 {{ISBN|0-8342-1726-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Important elements of patient education are skill building and responsibility: patients need to know when, how, and why they need to make a lifestyle change. Group effort is equally important: each member of the patient’s health care team needs to be involved.It can also help the patients by a better lifestyle, it give them the ability to learn new information. 

The value of patient education can be summarized as follows:
*Improved understanding of medical condition, diagnosis, disease, or disability.
*Improved understanding of methods and means to manage multiple aspects of medical condition.
*Improved self-advocacy in deciding to act both independently from medical providers and in interdependence with them.
*Increased Compliance – Effective communication and patient education increases patient motivation to comply.
*Patient Outcomes – Patients more likely to respond well to their treatment plan – fewer complications.
*Informed Consent – Patients feel you've provided the information they need.
*Utilization – More effective use of medical services – fewer unnecessary phone calls and visits.
*Satisfaction and referrals – Patients more likely to stay with your practice and refer other patients.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.krames.com Krames Patient Education]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Risk Management – Lower risk of malpractice when patients have realistic expectations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patient-education.com/?p=editorial&amp;s=xplainresearch&amp;ver=~2 Patient Education Institute, Research evidence]&lt;/ref&gt;

The competencies of a [[health educator]] include the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bastable|first=Susan B.|title=Health Professionals as Educator|year=2011|publisher=Jones &amp; Barlett Learning, LLC|location=Sudbury, MA|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Incorporate a personal ethic in regards to social responsibilities and services towards others.
*Provide accurate, competent, and evidence-based care.
*Practice preventative health care.
*Focus on relationship-centered care with individuals and their families.
*Incorporate the multiple determinants of health when providing care.
*Be culturally sensitive and be open to a diverse society.
*Use technology appropriately and effectively.
*Be current in the field and continue to advance education.
There are many areas where patient education can improve the outcomes of treatment.
* For example, in patients with amputations, patient education has been shown to be effective when approached from all angles by the healthcare team (nurse, primary care physician, prosthetist, physical therapist, occupational therapist etc.). Support groups have been shown to be a helpful method for dealing with depression in this population. Preoperative patient education helped patients with their decision making process by informing them of factors related to pain, limb loss, and functional restriction faced after amputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pantera|first=E.|last2=Pourtier-Piotte|first2=C.|last3=Bensoussan|first3=L.|last4=Coudeyre|first4=E.|title=Patient education after amputation: Systematic review and experts’ opinions|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1877065714000165|journal=Annals of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine|volume=57|issue=3|pages=143–158|doi=10.1016/j.rehab.2014.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the case of arthritis, patient education was found to be administered through three methods, including individual face to face meetings with healthcare professionals, patient groups, online support programs. Category I evidence was found for individual, face to face counseling. Meeting with rheumatologists, occupational therapists, physical therapists, nurses, and other healthcare providers was found to be effective in creating adherence to treatment, medication, and for improving  overall patient health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zangi|first=Heidi A.|last2=Ndosi|first2=Mwidimi|last3=Adams|first3=Jo|last4=Andersen|first4=Lena|last5=Bode|first5=Christina|last6=Boström|first6=Carina|last7=Eijk-Hustings|first7=Yvonne van|last8=Gossec|first8=Laure|last9=Korandová|first9=Jana|date=2015-06-01|title=EULAR recommendations for patient education for people with inflammatory arthritis|url=http://ard.bmj.com/content/74/6/954|journal=Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases|language=en|volume=74|issue=6|pages=954–962|doi=10.1136/annrheumdis-2014-206807|issn=1468-2060|pmid=25735643}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4374">The theme of '''poet as legislator''' reached its [[Grandiosity|grandiose]] peak in the [[Romanticism|Romantic era]],&lt;ref&gt;C. Prendergast ed., ''Cultural Materialism'' (1995) p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; epitomised in the view of the lonely, alienated poet as 'unacknowledged legislator' to the whole world.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Holmes, ''Dr Johnson and Mr Savage'' (1994) p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

However the concept had a long prehistory in Western culture, with classical figures like [[Orpheus]] or [[Solon]] being appealed to as precedents for the poet's civilising role.&lt;ref&gt;D. Griffin, ''Patriotism and Poetry in Eighteenth-Century Britain'' (2005) p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical origins==

[[Plato]]'s opposition to poets in his ideal Republic was predicated on the contemporary existence of [[Homer]]ic expounders who claimed that "a man ought to regulate the tenour of his whole life by this poet's directions".&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Davies/D. J. Vaughan trans., ''The Republic of Plato'' (1908) p. 352&lt;/ref&gt; Plato only allowed the already censured poet to guide the young, to be an acknowledged legislator at the price of total external control.&lt;ref&gt;E. B. Castle, ''Ancient Education and Today'' (1969) p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

Less threatened by the poetic role, the Romans by contrast saw poetry, with [[Horace]], as primarily pleasing, and only secondarily as instructive.&lt;ref&gt;M. H. Abrams, ''The Mirror and the Lamp'' (1971) p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renaissance and Augustan views==

Building the view of the fifteenth century Florentine [[Neoplatonism in the Renaissance|Neoplatonists]] on the poet as seer,&lt;ref&gt;M. H. Abrams, ''The Mirror and the Lamp'' (1971) p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; however, [[Sir Philip Sidney]] developed a more powerful concept of the poet as overtopping the philosopher, historian and lawyer to stand out as "the monarch...of all sciences.&lt;ref&gt;J. A van Dorsten ed, ''Sidney: A Defence of Poetry'' (1984) p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

Such a viewpoint was more or less institutionalised in [[Augustan literature]], Johnson's [[Rasselas]] maintaining for example that the poet "must write as the interpreter of nature and the legislator of mankind"&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Johnson, ''Rasselas'' (1905) p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; – a fully public, even patriotic role moreover&lt;ref&gt;D. Griffin, ''Patriotism and Poetry in Eighteenth-Century Britain'' (2005) p. 71-2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Romantic peaks==

By contrast the Romantic view of the poet as ''unackowledged'' legislator emerges at the turm of the century in the writing of [[William Godwin]], with his anarchic view of the poet as "the legislator of generations and the moral instructor of the world".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in J. A. Carlson, ''England's First Family of Writers'' (2007) p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;

It received its most memorable formulation however in [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]'s 1820 "[[A Defence of Poetry]]".&lt;ref&gt;I. Ousby ed., ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' (1995) p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; Shelley maintained that, through their powers of imaginative understanding, 'Poets' (in the widest sense, of ancient Greece) were able to identify and formulate emerging socio-cultural trends; and were as a result "the hierophants of an unapprehended inspiration...the unacknowledged legislators of the world".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in M. H. Abrams, ''The Mirror and the Lamp'' (1971) p. 332&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modernist irony==

The grand claims of the Romantics began to give way in the twentieth century to a more ironic stance&lt;ref&gt;S. Chatterji, ''Memories of a Lost War'' (2001) p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; – [[Yeats]] speaking for his calling in general when he wrote "We have no gift to set a statesman right".&lt;ref&gt;W. B. Yeats, ''The Poems'' (1984) p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

What remained of the Shelley claim was to be further diminished by [[Postmodernism]]'s distrust for grand narratives, if not perhaps destroyed entirely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://call-for-papers.sas.upenn.edu/node/33792 Tools of the Sacred]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], more precisely in [[formal language theory]], the profinite words are the generalization of the notion of finite words into a [[Cauchy completion|complete topological space]]. This notion allows to use [[topology]] to study languages and finite semigroups. For example, profinite words are used to give an alternative characterization to the algebraic notion of [[variety of finite semigroups]].

==Definition==

Let '''A''' an [[Alphabet (formal languages)|alphabet]]. The set of profinite words over '''A''' consists in the [[Completion (topology)|completion]] of a metric space defined on the set &lt;math&gt;\hat A^*&lt;/math&gt; of words over '''A'''. The distance used to define this metric space is defined using a notion of separation of words. Those notions are now defined.

===Separation===
Let '''M''' and '''N''' [[monoid]]s, let '''p''' and '''q''' be elements of the monoid '''M'''. Let '''φ''' a [[morphism]] of monoid from '''M''' to '''N'''. It is said that the morphism φ separates '''p''' and '''q''' if &lt;math&gt;\phi(p)\ne\phi(q)&lt;/math&gt;. For example, the morphism &lt;math&gt;\phi:A^*\to \mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z, w\mapsto |w|&lt;/math&gt; sending a words to the parity of its length separates the words '''ababa''' and '''abaa'''. Indeed &lt;math&gt;\phi(ababa)=1\ne0=\phi(abaa)&lt;/math&gt;. 

It is said that '''N''' separates '''p''' and '''q''' if there exists a morphism of monoid φ from '''M''' to '''N''' which separates '''p''' and '''q'''. Using previous example, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z&lt;/math&gt; separates '''ababa''' and '''abaa'''. More generally, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z/n\mathbb Z&lt;/math&gt; separates any words whose size are not congruent modulo '''n'''. In general, any two distinct words can be separated, using the monoid whose elements are the factors of '''p''' plus a fresh element 0. The morphism sends prefixes of '''p''' to themselves and everything else to 0.

===Distance===
The distance between two distinct words '''p''' and '''q''' is defined as the inverse of the size of the least morphism '''N''' separating '''p''' and '''q'''. Thus, the distance of '''ababa''' and '''abaa''' is &lt;math&gt;\frac12&lt;/math&gt;. The distance of '''p''' and itself is defined as 0.

This distance '''d''' is ultrametric, and furthermore it satisfies &lt;math&gt;d(uw,vw)\le d(u,v)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d(wu,wv)\le d(u,v)&lt;/math&gt;.

Since any word '''p''' can be separated from any other word using a monoid with '''|p|+1''' elements, where '''|p|''' is the length of '''p''', it follows that the distance between '''p''' and any other word is at least &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{|p|}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the topology defined by this metric is discrete. 
===Profinite topology===
The profinite topology over '''A''', denoted &lt;math&gt;\hat A^*&lt;/math&gt;, is the [[Completion (topology)|completion]] of the set of finite words under the distance defined above. It should be noted that the completion preserve the monoid structure.

The topology &lt;math&gt;\hat A^*&lt;/math&gt; is compact.

Any monoid morphism &lt;math&gt;\phi:A^*\to M&lt;/math&gt;, with '''M''' finite can be extended uniquely into  a morphism &lt;math&gt;\hat\phi:\hat A^*\to M&lt;/math&gt;, and this morphism is uniformly continuous.  Furthermore, it is the least topological space with this property.

===Profinite word===
A profinite word is an element of the profinite topology. And a profinite language is a set of profinite word. Each finite words are profinite words. A few examples of profinite words which are not finite are now given.

For '''m''' any word, let &lt;math&gt;m^\omega&lt;/math&gt; denote &lt;math&gt;\lim_{i\to\infty}m^{i!}&lt;/math&gt;. Note that &lt;math&gt;m^{i!}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Cauchy sequence]]. Intuitively, to separate &lt;math&gt;m^{i!}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m^{i'!}&lt;/math&gt;, a monoid should count at least up to &lt;math&gt;\min(i,i')&lt;/math&gt;, hence requires at least &lt;math&gt;\min(i,i')&lt;/math&gt; elements. Since &lt;math&gt;m^{i!}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Cauchy sequence]], &lt;math&gt;x^\omega&lt;/math&gt; is indeed a profinite word.

Furthermore, the word &lt;math&gt;x^\omega&lt;/math&gt; is idempotent. This is due to the fact that, for any morphism &lt;math&gt;\phi:A^*\to N&lt;/math&gt; with '''N''' finite, &lt;math&gt;\phi(m^{i!})=\phi(m)^{i!}=n^{i!}&lt;/math&gt; for some '''n''' belonging to '''N'''. Since '''N''' is finite, for '''i''' great enough, &lt;math&gt;n^{i!}&lt;/math&gt; is idempotent, and the sequence is constant. 

Similarly, &lt;math&gt;m^{\omega+1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m^{\omega-1}&lt;/math&gt; are defined as &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}m^{n!+ 1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}m^{n!-1}&lt;/math&gt; respectively.

==Profinite languages==
The notion of profinite languages allow to relate notions of [[semigroup theory]] to notions of topology. More precisely, given  '''P''' a profinite language, the following statements are equivalent:
*'''P''' is clopen.
*'''P''' is [[recognizable_set|recognizable]],
*The [[syntactic congruence]] of '''P''' is clopen, as a subset of &lt;math&gt;\hat A^*\times\hat A^*&lt;/math&gt;.

Similar statements also holds for languages '''P''' of finite words.  The following conditions are equivalent.
*&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is recognisable (as a subset of &lt;math&gt;A^*&lt;/math&gt;),
*the [[closure (topology)|closure]] of '''P''', &lt;math&gt;\overline P&lt;/math&gt;, is recognisable (as a subset of &lt;math&gt;\hat A^*&lt;/math&gt;), where 
*&lt;math&gt;P=K\cap A^*&lt;/math&gt;, for some clopen '''K''',
*&lt;math&gt;\overline P&lt;/math&gt; is clopen.

Those characterisations are due to the more general fact that, taking the closure of a finite language, and restricting a profinite language to finite words are inverse operations, when they are applied to recognisable languages.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3852">'''Pseudolaw''' consists of statements, beliefs, or practices that are claimed to be based on accepted law or legal doctrine, but which deviate significantly from most conventional understandings of law and jurisprudence, or which originate from non-existent statutes or legal principals the advocate or adherent of incorrectly believes exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Powell|first1=Corey|title=Here comes pseudolaw, a weird little cousin of pseudoscience|url=https://aeon.co/ideas/here-comes-pseudolaw-a-weird-little-cousin-of-pseudoscience|accessdate=January 4, 2018|work=[[Aeon (digital magazine)|Aeon]]|date=March 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes referred to as "legalistic gibberish".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=T.C.

Followers of such ideologies can cause problems for courts and government administrators by filing unusual applications that are difficult to process. Courts in Canada refer to such arguments as '''Organized Pseudolegal Commercial Arguments''', and have called them frivolous and vexatious.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://canlii.ca/en/ab/abqb/doc/2012/2012abqb571/2012abqb571.html Meads v. Meads, 2012 ABQB 571]''(CanLII), Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta, 18 September 2012, para. 77&lt;/ref&gt; There is no recorded instance of such tactics being upheld in a court of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/18/freeman-land-strategy-bullet-debt |title=The freeman-on-the-land strategy is no magic bullet for debt problems |last1=Bizzle |first1=Legal |date=18 November 2011 |website=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common among psudolegal beliefs is a belief that one is partially or fully sovereign from the country in which they live, and believe that no laws, or only certain laws, apply to them. Groups espousing such pseudolegal beliefs include [[freemen on the land]] and the [[sovereign citizen movement]]. Some believe that their state itself is illegitimate, such as [[Reichsbürgerbewegung]].

Also under the umbrella of pseudolegal arguments are [[conspiracy theorists]] who believe there is a secret parallel legal system that one can access through certain means, like using a secret phrase or by placing stamps on the right place on documents. For example, the [[redemption movement]] believes that a secret fund is created for everyone at birth by the government, and that a procedure exists to "redeem" or reclaim money from this fund. See [[tax protester conspiracy arguments]] for a discussion of these beliefs related to tax law. Many of these revolve around the "legal name fraud" movement, which believes that birth certificates give the state legal ownership of a [[personal name]] and refusing to use this name therefore removes oneself from a court's jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dalgleish|first1=Katherine|title=Guns, border guards, and the Magna Carta: the Freemen-on-the-Land are back in Alberta courts|url=https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=018e9df4-b9fe-4c88-9db9-d784f423348c|website=lexology.com|publisher=Lexology|accessdate=January 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kelly|first1=John|title=The mystery of the 'legal name fraud' billboards|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-36499750|accessdate=January 4, 2018|work=[[BBC News]]|date=June 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various groups advocate that one can avoid this state ownership by distinguishing between capitalized and non-capitalized versions of one's name, or by adding punctuation to one's name. See [[strawman theory]] (also known as the capital letters argument) for more information.

'''Rhetorical modes''' (also known as '''modes of discourse''') describe the variety, conventions, and purposes of the major kinds of [[language]]-based [[communication]], particularly [[writing]] and [[speaking]]. Four of the most common rhetorical modes and their purpose are [[Narrative mode|narration]], [[description]], [[Exposition (narrative)|exposition]], and [[Argumentation theory|argumentation]].{{sfn|Rozakis|2003|p=271}}  The first codification of these rhetorical modes was by Samuel P. Newman in ''A Practical System of Rhetoric'' in 1827.{{sfn|Connors|1981|p=445}} 

==Narration==
{{further|Exposition (narrative)}}
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2014}}
The purpose of [[narrative mode|narration]] is to tell a story or narrate an event or series of events. This writing mode frequently uses the tools of descriptive writing. Narration is an especially useful tool for sequencing or putting details and information into some kind of logical order, usually chronological. Working with narration helps us see clear sequences separate from all other mental functions. Examples include:
*[[Anecdote]]s
*[[Autobiography]]
*[[Biography]]
*[[Novel]]s
*[[Oral history]]
*[[Short story]]

==Description==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}
The  purpose of description is to re-create, invent, or visually present a person, place, event, or action so that the reader can picture that which is being described. Descriptive writing can be found in the other rhetorical modes.  Examples include:
*[[Personal journal|Journal writing]]
*[[Poetry]]

==Exposition==
Expository writing is a type of [[writing]] where the purpose is to explain, inform, or even describe.&lt;ref name=ball&gt;{{cite web|last=Ball|first=Arnetha F.|title=Expository Writing|url=http://www.stanford.edu/~arnetha/expowrite/info.html|publisher=Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered to be one of the four most common rhetorical modes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nordquist|first=Richard|title=Expository Writing|url=http://grammar.about.com/od/e/g/Expository-Writing-term.htm|publisher=About.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of expository writing is to explain and analyze information by presenting an idea, relevant evidence, and appropriate discussion. In [[narrative]] contexts (such as [[history]] and [[fiction]]), [[exposition (narrative)|exposition]] provides background information to teach or entertain. In other [[nonfiction]] contexts (such as [[technical communication]]), the purpose is to teach and inform. Examples include:{{sfn|Rozakis|2003|p=271}}
* Business
**[[Business letter]]s
**[[Report]]s
**[[News release|Press releases]]
* Journalism
**[[How-to|How-to essays, such as recipes and other instructions]]
**[[Article (publishing)|News article]]
* Personal
**[[Personal letter]]s
**[[Will (law)|Wills]]
* Academic and [[technical communication]]
**[[Scientific writing]]
***[[Scientific report]]s
***[[Scientific journal]] articles
**[[Academic writing]]
***[[Term paper]]s
***[[Textbook]]s
***General [[reference work]]s
****[[Encyclopedia|Encyclopedia articles]]
**[[Technical writing]]
***[[User guide]]s
***[[Technical standard]]s

==Argumentation==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}
The purpose of argumentation (also called ''[[persuasive writing]]'') is to prove the validity of an idea, or point of view, by presenting sound reasoning, discussion, and argument to thoroughly convince the reader. Persuasive writing/Persuasion is a type of argumentation with the additional aim to urge the reader to take some form of action.  Examples include:

Another form of persuasive rhetoric is satirical rhetoric, or using humor in order to make a point about some aspect of life or society. Perhaps the most famous example is [[Jonathan Swift]]'s "[[A Modest Proposal]]".

==Fiction-writing modes==
Each [[fiction-writing mode]] has its own purposes and conventions. Agent and author Evan Marshall identifies five fiction-writing modes: action, summary, dialogue, feelings/thoughts, and background.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt| Marshall | 1998 | pp = 143–165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author and writing-instructor [[Jessica Page Morrell]] lists six delivery modes for fiction-writing: action, exposition, description, dialogue, summary, and transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt | Morrell | 2006 | p = 127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Peter Selgin]] refers to ''methods'', including action, dialogue, thoughts, summary, scene, and description.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt | Selgin | 2007 | p = 38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''single-core''' processor is a [[microprocessor]] with a single core on a chip, running a single [[thread (computing)|thread]] at any one time. The term became common after the emergence of [[multi-core]] processors (which have several independent processors on a single chip) to distinguish non-multi-core designs. For example, [[Intel]] released a [[Core 2 Solo]] and [[Core 2 Duo]], and one would refer to the former as the 'single-core' variant. Most microprocessors prior to the multi-core era are single-core. The class of [[many-core]] processors follows on from multi-core, in a progression showing increasing [[parallel computing|parallelism]] over time.

Processors remained single-core until it was impossible to achieve performance gains from the increased [[clock speed]] and [[transistor count]] allowed by [[Moore's law]]  (there were diminishing returns to increasing the depth of a [[pipeline (computing)|pipeline]], increasing [[CPU cache]] sizes, or adding [[execution units]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=architecting solutions of the manycore era|url= http://www.slideshare.net/Talbott/architecting-solutions-for-the-manycore-future}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Increasing parallel trend==
* Single-core{{snd}} one processor on a die. Since about 2012, even most [[iPhone 5|smartphone]] [[CPUs]] marketed are no longer single-core; [[Microcontroller]]s are still single-core, while there are exceptions.
* [[Multi-core]]{{snd}} a 'few' processors on a die, e.g. 2, 4, 8.
* [[Many-core]]{{snd}} a 'large number' of processors on a die, e.g. 10s, 100s, 1000s. Some specialist [[ASIC]]s/[[Hardware acceleration|Accelerators]] and [[GPU]]s fall into this category.

'''Sust 'n' Able''' is the [[Woodcraft Folk]]'s programme of education for [[sustainable development]].
[[Image:sustnable.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Sust'N'Able Logo]]

The project was the theme of the Woodcraft Folk's 2001 international camp in [[Nottinghamshire]] where 4,000 young people attended. The camp focused on sustainable development education and ran activates for children from five to twenty five around the themes.

At the camp a simulation game took place called '''World on a Tight Rope'', it ran the length of the camp and involved people working for credits to create a more sustainable world. The simulation included two 'Earth Summits' held at the camp to come up with a declaration to the world's leaders at the [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] (WSSD). The Earth Summit had "action stations" where people debated the issues to be included in the declaration.

==The declaration and delegation==
The Declaration created as part of the simulation game was presented by a delegation of 11 young people. The delegation attended the [[United Nations]]' [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] including both the civil society and the official political areas of the summit. The group worked with the [[International Falcon Movement - Socialist Education International]] delegation attending the summit.

Delegations from Woodcraft Folk attend all the [[Commission on Sustainable Development]] meetings in [[New York City]] which are follow-up meetings to the annual WSSD, with thematic cycles changing every two years.

'''TESST College of Technology''' is a private for-profit technical college located in metropolitan [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. It is owned and operated by Education Corporation of America.

==History==
TESST College of Technology began offering instruction in electronics in 1957 as TESST Technology Institute. The campus was located in [[Hyattsville, Maryland]]. In December 1992, TESST expanded its reach in the Baltimore market by acquiring the Arundel Institute of Technology. In the summer of 1998, the Hyattsville and Baltimore campuses relocated to new buildings in [[Beltsville, Maryland|Beltsville]] and [[Towson, Maryland]].

In 1999, TESST acquired RETS Technical Training Center, which had been offering classes in Maryland since 1956. In June 2001, TESST Technology Institute received approval to offer associate of applied science degrees in network information systems and electronics, computer, and telecommunications technology.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} All campuses then became known as TESST College of Technology.

In May 2002, the College was acquired by Quest Education Corporation, a subsidiary of Kaplan, Inc.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-85932155.html|title=Acquisition by Kaplan, Inc.|publisher=PR Newswire|accessdate=2009-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2002, Quest changed its name to Kaplan Higher Education Corporation. In March 2004, the campus expanded by adding a {{convert|6800|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility located at 3922 Vero Road, less than a mile from the campus.

In September 2015, TESST College of Technology was acquired by [[Education Corporation of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Education Corporation of America Completes Purchase of Kaplan Campuses|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/education-corporation-of-america-completes-purchase-of-kaplan-college-campuses-300137913.html|publisher=PR Newswire|accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the efforts of TOPP, information never before accessed by humans was now available, such as migration routes and ecosystems,&lt;ref name="A TOPP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tagging PP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.mongabay.com/2008/0217-hance_sharks.html |title=Tagging of Pacific Pelagics, (TOPP) |publisher=SIMoN |date=200-11-20 |accessdate=2009-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; but from the animals', rather than human, aspects.&lt;ref name="M aquarium"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/cr/topp.asp |title=Monterey Bay Aquarium |publisher=Montery Bay Aquarium |accessdate=2009-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also became possible to learn about the ocean itself through use of the animals, because they can go where humans cannot. We learn through their everyday actions, and through these data, researchers have been able to determine better ways of protecting endangered species, such as the leatherback turtle.&lt;ref name="A TOPP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="T Ocean"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seaturtles.org/article.php?id=1283 |title=Sea Turtle Restoration Project |publisher=Sea Turtle Restoration Project |accessdate=2009-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Endangered"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xray-mag.com/en/node/658 |title=Satellite Tagging Research |publisher=X-Ray Magazine |accessdate=2009-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
In addition to the [[National Marine Fisheries Service|NOAA’s Pacific Fisheries Ecosystems Lab]], Stanford’s [[Hopkins Marine Station#Hopkins Marine Station|Hopkins Marine Lab]], and [[University of California, Santa Cruz]]’s Long Marine Laboratory,&lt;ref name="A TOPP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="T Census"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coml.org/projects/tagging-pacific-predators-topp |title=Census of Marine Life, TOPP |publisher=Census of Marine Life |accessdate=2009-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; a wide range of people contribute to the success of the program, including [[marine biologist]]s, [[oceanographer]]s, engineers, computer programmers, journalists, graphic designers, educators and the public who provide support.&lt;ref name="A TOPP" /&gt;

==Tagging==
[[File:Elephant seal tag.jpg|thumb|right|A CDT tag taken off an elephant seal at Año Nuevo State Reserve]]
Many different types of tags are used in the TOPP tagging program, each designed for different marine animals and different types of data.&lt;ref name="KQED"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kqed.org/quest/television/view/924 |title=KQED Quest Television Story |publisher=KQED |date=2008-05-20 |accessdate=2009-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archival tags, though small, are very powerful, and can last up to 10 years.&lt;ref name="A TOPP" /&gt; Researchers surgically implant them into the bellies of tuna, where the tags record, as often as every few seconds, pressure (for depth of dives), ambient light (to estimate location), internal and external body temperature, and, in some cases, speed of travel.&lt;ref name="A TOPP" /&gt; The tags are small and light enough to be attached to the outside of an animal, such as the tail feathers of red-footed boobies. However, they do have a drawback, they have to be retrieved. So, they are useful for fish likely to be caught as seafood, such as bluefin or yellowfin tuna,&lt;ref name="bluefin"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tagagiant.org/Science.Pac.shtml |title=Tag-A-Giant Foundation |publisher=TAG |accessdate=2009-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219062345/http://tagagiant.org/Science.Pac.shtml |archivedate=2009-02-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or animals that return to rookeries or nesting beaches, such as boobies and leatherback turtles.&lt;ref name="A TOPP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Youtube Turtle"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxOfsySiS-s&amp;feature=channel_page |title=Youtube, Tagging Leatherback Turtle |publisher=Youtube |accessdate=2009-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pop-up Satellite Archival Tag|Pop-up satellite archival tags]] (PSATs), also known simply as pop-up archival tags (PATs), are just like archival tags, except they are designed to release at a preset time, like 30 days. They then float to the surface and send their data via an Argos satellite back to the laboratory for two weeks, which is the life of its battery.&lt;ref name="A TOPP" /&gt; Even when the battery dies, the data are saved on the tag, so if it is ever recovered, the whole data set can be downloaded. This tag is useful for animals that do not spend a lot of time at the surface, and are not caught often.&lt;ref name="A TOPP" /&gt; Numerous white sharks have been tagged with this tag.&lt;ref name="Mysterious Shark"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.mongabay.com/2008/0217-hance_sharks.html |title=Mysteries of the Great White Shark |publisher=Mongabay.com |date=2008-02-17 |accessdate=2009-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Underwater shark"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.underwatertimes.com/news.php?article_id=71510839062 |title=Released Aquarium Great White Shark |publisher=Underwater Times |date=2008-05-20 |accessdate=2009-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sign On San Diego"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/state/20071118-9999-lz1n18shark.html |title=Tracking the White Shark |publisher=SignOnSanDiego.com |date=2007-11-18 |accessdate=2009-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Youtube Shark"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOb0ywsbKA8&amp;feature=channel_page |title=Youtube, Tagged White Shark |publisher=Youtube |accessdate=2009-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tags are attached to white sharks by inserting a small surgical titanium anchor into it.&lt;ref name="Blue Sharks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/sci/sa-mfpd/elasmobranchs/blueshark_tagging.htm |title=Blue Shark Tagging |publisher=Groundfish |accessdate=2009-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805181024/http://www.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/sci/sa-mfpd/elasmobranchs/blueshark_tagging.htm |archivedate=August 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On elephant seals, the tag is glued to the fur.&lt;ref name="Youtube Elephant Seal"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh-1JkScKEQ&amp;feature=channel_page |title=Youtube, Tagging Elephant Seals |publisher=Youtube |accessdate=2009-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connecting the tag to the anchor is a thin line that loops around a metal pin at the base of the tag.&lt;ref name="A TOPP" /&gt; This metal pin is connected to a battery. A clock in the tag turns the battery on at a preprogrammed time. When the battery turns on, the attachment pin dissolves. The tag floats to the surface and starts transmitting data to one of the Argos satellites.&lt;ref name="A TOPP" /&gt;

Spot tags, or smart positioning, or temperature transmitting tags, are ideal tags for air-breathing marine animals (seals, whales and sea turtles) and animals that often swim close to the surface (salmon sharks, blue sharks and makos).&lt;ref name="A TOPP" /&gt; When the antenna breaks the surface, it sends data to a satellite. The data include pressure, speed, and water temperature. Location is estimated by calculating the Doppler shift in the transmission signal in successive transmissions.&lt;ref name="A TOPP" /&gt; When the animal goes beneath the surface, a saltwater switch turns off the tag. The tag, made by Wildlife Computers, lasts about two years.&lt;ref name="Wildlife"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildlifecomputers.com/ |title=Wildlife Computers |publisher=Wildlife Computers |accessdate=2009-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Satellite relay data logger (SRDL) tags compress data so more information can be transmitted through the Argos satellite.&lt;ref name="A TOPP" /&gt; These can be outfitted with CTD tags to record the salinity, temperature and depth data oceanographers need to identify ocean currents and water.&lt;ref name="A TOPP" /&gt; Elephant seals, sea lions and leatherback sea turtles wear these tags.

==Programs==
[[File:Ellie seal TOPP.jpg|thumb|An elephant seal named Ellie tagged though TOPP]]
TOPP has also set up programs to engage the public in learning about marine science and marine conservation. One of its programs is called Elephant Seal Homecoming Days, which was started by TOPP in 2008 for the months the northern elephant seals return to Año Nuevo State Reserve during the breeding season. TOPP picks around 10 of the many they tagged to become "spokes-seals" for the public, allowing them to see what it is like being one of the biggest seals in the world.&lt;ref name="TOPP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://topp.org/ |title=TOPP |publisher=TOPP |date= |accessdate=2009-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elephant seals are prime candidates for tagging because they tend to return to the same beach every year to breed, yielding high tag recovery.&lt;ref name="Tagging of E Seals"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elephantseal.org/E-Seals/tagging.htm |title=Tagging of Elephant Seals |publisher=Friends of the Elephant Seal |accessdate=2009-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can gather immense amounts of information because they can swim for thousands of miles.&lt;ref name="NOAA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://las.pfeg.noaa.gov/TOPP/ |title=NOAA |publisher=TOPP |accessdate=2009-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UC News"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/article/7889 |title=UC Newsroom |publisher=University of California |date=2006-02-21 |accessdate=2009-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seals are issued their own [[Facebook]] profile that is kept up for them by undergraduate volunteer keepers.&lt;ref name="facebook"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/people/Penelope-Seal/792464921 |title=Penelope Seal's Facebook |publisher=Facebook |accessdate=2009-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook profiles keep the public updated on their progress while they give birth and proceed to take care of their pups. Two seals are the stars of TOPP Elephant Seal Homecoming Days. The first is Penelope Seal, who has been part of the program since 2008. The second one is new as of 2009, and his name is Stelephant Colbert (in reference to [[Stephen Colbert]] of  ''[[The Colbert Report]]'').&lt;ref name="Stelephant"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nofactzone.net/?p=10657 |title=Stelephant Colbert |publisher=No Fact Zone |date=2009-01-29 |accessdate=2009-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Early years
Stelephant started out as a mere pup in a small harem of northern elephant seals located at Año Nuevo State Reserve.&lt;ref name="Ano Nuevo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=523 |title=Año Nuevo State Reserve |publisher=CA.gov |accessdate=2009-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has since grown into one of the most famous elephant seals ever, even appearing on ''The Colbert Report''. Around eight years old, Stelephant is a 4,500-pound beast. Not known as the pretty-boy, he gets by on his aggressiveness and determination to get as close to females as possible. With his proboscis, or nose, high in the air, almost any male is turned away unless they wish to fight.&lt;ref name="Fighting males"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct_Bq3KpVmQ |title=Back To The Fight"Males at Año Nuevo |publisher=Youtube |date=2008-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; These fights are not known to last for long, however, because Stelephant is a seasoned fighter and knows how to win. He is what every male elephant seal strives to be, huge, strong, and proud.

When Stelephant Colbert was weaned, he spent the next few weeks on the beach waiting for the courage to go and join the adult seals out in the northern Pacific Ocean. He returned the next year to the same beach on the California coast as a yearling, where he was exiled to the outskirts of the harems with all the other yearlings. The next few years were spent building muscle and growing large to be able to compete with the larger males. During his third to fifth year, Stelephant practiced his fighting skills with other young males to build strength; while he did compete with the adults, he was not much competition and spent most of his days far away from females.&lt;ref name="marine mammals"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marinemammalcenter.org/learning/education/pinnipeds/noelephseal.asp |title=Elephant Seals |publisher =The Marine Mammal Center |accessdate=2009-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was around seven years old with his proboscis finally grown in, he was finally ready to compete with the adult males for the alpha position.

*Tagging
Stelephant has been involved with the University of California, Santa Cruz Long Marine Lab researchers, and was tagged last spring to track his foraging habits while swimming and diving off the [[Aleutian Islands]] in the northern Pacific Ocean.

*Current
Stelephant was issued his own Facebook page, where people can keep track of his whereabouts and his status updates.&lt;ref name="Meet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailybreeze.com/news/ci_11601414 |title=Meet Stelephant Colbert and Jon Sealwart |publisher=dailybreeze.com |date=2009-01-31 |accessdate=2009-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mercury News"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_11599365?IADID=Search-www.mercurynews.com-www.mercurynews.com |title=Mercury News:California Seals Names for Pundits Colbert, Stewart |publisher=Mercury News |date=2009-01-31 |accessdate=2009-02-26 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the most talked-about seal in the program in that he was featured in the Santa Cruz Sentinel, the Associated Press, and many additional media organizations.&lt;ref name="comic"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://ohmonkeytrumpets.blogspot.com/2009/02/todays-mark-trail-cannot-be-coincidence.html |title=Today’s Mark Trial cannot be a coincidence |publisher=Oh Monkey Trumpets |date=2009-02-08 |accessdate=2009-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sentinel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_11597937 |title=Santa Cruz Sentinel:Stelephant Colbert |publisher=Santa Cruz Sentinel |date=2009-01-31 |accessdate=2009-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KGet.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kget.com/news/state/story/Calif-seals-named-for-pundits-Colbert-Stewart/ZuSzpTLv5UmmmooX7oXUlg.cspx |title=Calif. seals named for pundits |publisher=17KGet.com |date=2009-01-31 |accessdate=2009-02-26 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest media event was when Stephen Colbert of ''The Colbert Report'', after whom Stelephant is named, spoke of his seal on his show.&lt;ref name="FOX"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.kcba.com/Global/story.asp?S=9768323&amp;nav=menu1593_4  |title=UCSC Seals Named After Political Satirists |publisher=FOX 35 |date=2009-02-01 |accessdate=2009-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Steven forum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.colbertnation.com/tcr/board/message?board.id=Stephen&amp;thread.id=699 |title=Colbert Nation Thread |publisher=Colbert Nation |date=2009-01-26 |accessdate=2009-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UCSC name"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ktvu.com/news/18612531/detail.html#- |title=UCSC Marine Biologists Name Seals after Colbert, Stewart |publisher=KTVU.com |date=2009-01-31 |accessdate=2009-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stelephant was featured in one of the show episodes, creating a media buzz.&lt;ref name="unappreciative"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topix.net/forum/city/opal-cliffs-ca/T0IALG9AFJ9GNF21K |title=Stelephant Colbert, the elephant Seal |publisher=Topix |date=2009-01-31 |accessdate=2009-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Stelephant’s fan based has skyrocketed bringing attention to TOPP and the UCSC Long Marine Lab who Stelephant is associated with.&lt;ref name="UCSC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=2704 |title=I am elephant seals(and so can you) |publisher=UC Santa Cruz |date=2009-01-30 |accessdate=2009-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Approval"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.pressreleasepoint.com/topp-program-gets-039seal039-approval-comedian-stephen-colbert |title=TOPP program gets ‘seal’ of approval from comedian Stephen Colbert |publisher=PressReleasePoint |date=2009-02-05 |accessdate=2009-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stelephant has enabled TOPP to engage the public in learning about northern elephant seals, marine science, and marine conservation.

Stelephant is now an alpha male at Año Nuevo State Reserve, and will soon return to the ocean to forage once again. Stelephant was featured on Oceans Google Earth, which allows the user to explore the oceans.&lt;ref name="oceans"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/centralcoast/ci_11614425?nclick_check=1 |title=Google Ocean allows underwater exploration without the wetsuit |date=2009-02-03 |accessdate= 2009-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SC Oceans"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/localnews/ci_11614425?source=rss |title= Google Ocean allows underwater exploration without the wetsuit |publisher=Santa Cruz Sentinel |date=2009-02-03 |accessdate=2009-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; His tags were recovered in January and he was not tagged again.

==Penelope Seal==
Penelope Seal is an elephant seal and one of the many marine animals tagged as a part of the TOPP program.

Penelope was born as a "little" {{Convert|90|lb|kg|abbr=on}} pup in early January 1998 at the [[Año Nuevo State Reserve]] on the [[California]]n coast.&lt;ref name="ianimals"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ianimals.com/videoplay/Pups_and_mom_elephant_seals_at_A%C3%B1o_Nuevo_State_Reserve.html |title=iAnimals |publisher=iAnimals |accessdate=2003-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, she has become a {{Convert|1500|lb|kg|abbr=on}} full grown female northern elephant seal with six pups of her own, and many fans who have contributed to her fame.&lt;ref name="The Marine Mammal Center"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marinemammalcenter.org/learning/education/pinnipeds/noelephseal.asp |title=The Marine Mammal Center |publisher=The Marine Mammal Center |date= |accessdate=2009-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; From five years old, she has had one pup a year, all at Año Nuevo State Reserve. Penelope Seal is known as gnarly seal and a survivor, considering 50% of her species will die before they reach maturity.&lt;ref name="TOPP elephant seals"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.topp.org/species/elephant_seals |title=Elephant Seals |publisher=TOPP |date= |accessdate=2009-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215031553/http://topp.org/species/elephant_seals |archivedate=2009-02-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She has beautiful dark-brown fur that she molts (or sheds) once a year. The beach is a known hangout spot of hers and one can usually spot her basking in the sun, or if its raining, cuddling up to another elephant seal. She has had multiple relationships, never known to be a [[monogamous]] seal, and in fact living in a [[polygynous]] society. The group, or harem, is made up of many other females and an alpha male with which Penelope has been known to hang out.&lt;ref name="The Marine Mammal Center" /&gt; However, Penelope has also been seen socializing with some other beta males around the harem, much to the dismay of the alpha.
*Early life
Penelope spent her early life as a weaner, or weaned pup, at Año Nuevo State Reserve. During this time she fasted on the beach waiting until she was brave enough to go out into the open ocean for the first time. The next year she became a yearling and spent her days being shunned from her harem, since she was still small compared to the others. Years two and three were spent much the same way. During this period she learned a lot about how to become a successful predator, like being able to travel all the way out into the northern Pacific Ocean and back again without any maps, and making it to the same place every time, which can be around an {{Convert|8000|mi|km|abbr=on}} journey. However, when she was four years old, she became pregnant with her first pup and gave birth to him 10 months later at Año Nuevo State Reserve.
*Tagging
Penelope is tagged with a small tag and collects data for the TOPP team's researchers. Penelope's tag has a time depth recorder,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lotek.com/archival.htm&lt;/ref&gt; which documents the dive depth, dive duration, and light levels.&lt;ref name="E Seal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://topp.org/species/elephant_seals |title=Elephant Seals |publisher=TOPP |date= |accessdate=2009-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elephant seals are incredible divers and allow scientists to learn about their unique behavior and the environment in which they live.   Elephant seals are prime candidates for tagging because they tend to return to the same beach every year to breed, yielding high tag recovery.&lt;ref name="Tagging of E Seals"/&gt; They can gather immense amounts of information because they can swim for thousands of miles.&lt;ref name="NOAA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UC News"/&gt; Penelope herself has been involved with the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] Long Marine Lab researchers and was tagged last year.

*Current
Penelope has since had her seventh pup, and is living on the beaches of Año Nuevo State Reserve. She was not tagged this year.  Stelephant Colbert has since taken on the challenge of promoting elephant seals, and has been quite successful.&lt;ref name="colbertnation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/217977/february-05-2009/stelephant-colbert-the-elephant-seal |title=Stelephant Colbert The Elephant Seal |publisher=The Colbert Report |date=2009-02-05 |accessdate=2009-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Penelope is featured on the new version of Ocean [[Google Earth]], which allows the user to explore the oceans. Penelope can be located at Año Nuevo State Reserve.&lt;ref name="Oceans"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.justmagic.com/GM-GE.html |title=Google Ocean |publisher=Magic Instinct Software |accessdate=2009-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blog"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.topp.org/blog/penelope_returns |title=Penelope Returns! |publisher=TOPP |date=2009-02-06 |accessdate=2009-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211142441/http://topp.org/blog/penelope_returns |archivedate=2009-02-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="meet pen"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hxrhwj_SPOw |title=Meet Penelope Seal On Google Ocean! |publisher=Google Earth |accessdate=2009-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Oceans"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.underwatertimes.com/news.php?article_id=01029837156 |title=Underwater Times |publisher=UnderwaterTimes.com |date=2009-02-02 |accessdate=2009-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Penelope Seal has been the star of Elephant Seal Homecoming Days for the past two years. She enabled TOPP to engage the public in learning about northern elephant seals, marine science, and marine conservation.

==The Great Turtle Race==
The Great Turtle Race is an international sea turtle conservation event that brings together corporate sponsors and conservation organizations. The race tracks sea turtles as they move toward feeding areas south of the Galapagos Islands after nesting at Playa Grande in Costa Rica’s Las Baulas National Park, the primary nesting area for leatherbacks in the Pacific.

TOPP is a cosponsor of The Great Turtle Race, and tracking technology created and used by TOPP is how the turtles are tracked. The race occurred in 2007 and 2008 in April.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wildlifeextra.com/go/news/leatherback-race.html#cr&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Page from The Indian Antiquary.jpg|thumbnail|right|Cover page of a 1931 edition of ''The Indian Antiquary'']]
'''''The Indian Antiquary, A journal of oriental research in archaeology, history, literature, language, philosophy, religion, folklore, &amp;c, &amp;c,''''' (subtitle varies) was a journal of original research relating to India, published between 1872 and 1933. It was founded by the archaeologist [[James Burgess (archaeologist)|James Burgess]] to enable the sharing of knowledge between scholars based in Europe and in India and was notable for the high quality of its epigraphic illustrations which enabled scholars to make accurate translations of texts that in many cases remain the definitive versions to this day. It was also pioneering in its recording of Indian [[folklore]]. It was succeeded by ''The New Indian Antiquary'' (1938-47) and the ''Indian Antiquary'' (1964-71).

==History==
''The Indian Antiquary'' was founded in 1872 by the archaeologist [[James Burgess (archaeologist)|James Burgess]] [[Order of the Indian Empire|CIE]] as a journal of original research relating to India. It was designed to enable the sharing of knowledge between scholars based in Europe and in India.&lt;ref name=Pros&gt;[http://indianhistorybooks.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/indian-antiquary-vol-i-1872.pdf Prospectus] in ''The Indian Antiquary'', Part 1, 5 January 1872, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Indian Antiquary" in ''[[The Antiquaries Journal]]'', Vol. 2, No. 2, April 1922, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The journal was a private venture,&lt;ref name=Temp&gt;[[Richard Carnac Temple|Temple, Richard Carnac]].

The journal had an archaeological and historical focus, and in the late nineteenth century that naturally meant that [[epigraphy]] (the study of inscriptions as writing rather than as literature) would be one of the principal subjects covered in its pages.&lt;ref name=Sal&gt;{{cite book|author=Salomon, Richard (1998)|title=Indian Epigraphy: A Guide to the Study of Inscriptions in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and the other Indo-Aryan Languages: A Guide to the Study of Inscriptions in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and the other Indo-Aryan Languages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XYrG07qQDxkC&amp;pg=PA219|date=|location= New York|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0-19-535666-3|page=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the ''Antiquary'' was the premier source of European scholarship on Indian epigraphy until the twentieth century and the official Indian government journal of epigraphy, the ''[[Epigraphia Indica]]'', was published as a quarterly supplement to the ''Antiquary'' between 1892 and 1920.&lt;ref name=Temp/&gt;

The ''Antiquary'' was printed at [[Mazgaon]], Bombay, by the [[Bombay Education Society]] and later the British India Press, but illustrations were produced in London by the firm of Griggs who were known for the accuracy of their work.&lt;ref name=Temple.p.6/&gt; A high standard of reproduction was essential so that scholars could work on the epigraphic material without needing to see the originals.&lt;ref name=Temple.p.6&gt;Temple, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Illustrations in the ''Antiquary'' were used by scholars such as Bhandarkar, [[Bhagvanlal Indraji]], [[Georg Bühler]], [[John Faithfull Fleet]], Eggeling and B.

Retrieved 30 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and in many cases their translations remain the definitive versions to this day.&lt;ref name=Sal/&gt;

Over one thousand plates were included in ''The Indian Antiquary'' and the ''Epigraphia Indica'' over the first fifty years of publication, but having the illustrations produced abroad was not without its disadvantages. On one occasion during World War I, enemy action meant that expensive plates had to be sent from London three times before they reached Bombay safely.&lt;ref name=Temple.p.6/&gt;

'''''The Travelling Artist''''' is an art house production inspired by [[German Expressionism|German expressionism]] co-directed by Jez Blackmore and Richard Hulse from a screenplay by Jenni Grant.

== Plot ==

A dark fairytale combining the drama of modern horror with classic elements of Gothic imagery inspired by the German Expressionist films of the 1920s.

A young artist, Lucy Snow, struggles bravely to cope with more than one grief; the plight of her seriously ill mother, and her own faltering talents as a painter.

Her dreams become haunted by a shadowy figure, the mythical Travelling Artist. This lonely wanderer, it’s whispered, has roamed the world for over a century in pursuit of his creative visions. Can such a man exist? And if he does, will his powers be able to rescue Lucy from sadness and what form will salvation take?

== Cast ==

* Holly- Marie Laurence as Lucy Snow
* Simon Baker as The Travelling Artist
* Poppy Flanagan as Lucy's mother
* Martine Sherlock as Eliza Rose

== Influences ==

''The Travelling Artist'' is a modern take on classic German expressionist films including ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari|The Cabinet of Doctor Caligari]]'' (1920), ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' (1927), and ''[[Nosferatu]]'' (1922).

[[Image:Total least squares.svg|right|thumb|200px| The bivariate (Deming regression) case of total least squares. The red lines show the error in both ''x'' and ''y''. This is different from the traditional least squares method which measures error parallel to the ''y'' axis. The case shown, with deviations measured perpendicularly, arises when ''x'' and ''y'' have equal variances.]]

In [[applied statistics]], '''total least squares''' is a type of [[errors-in-variables regression]], a [[least squares]] data modeling technique in which observational errors on both dependent and independent variables are taken into account. It is a generalization of [[Deming regression]] and also of [[orthogonal regression]], and can be applied to both linear and non-linear models.

The total least squares approximation of the data is generically equivalent to the best, in the [[Frobenius norm]], [[low-rank approximation]] of the data matrix.&lt;ref&gt;I. Markovsky and [[Sabine Van Huffel|S. Van Huffel]], ''Overview of total least squares methods.'' Signal Processing, vol. 87, pp. 2283–2302, 2007. [http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/13855/1/tls_overview.pdf preprint]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Linear model ==

===Background===

In the [[least squares]] method of data modeling, the [[objective function]], ''S'',
:&lt;math&gt;S=\mathbf{r^TWr},&lt;/math&gt;
is minimized, where ''r'' is the vector of [[errors and residuals in statistics|residuals]] and ''W'' is a weighting matrix. In [[linear least squares (mathematics)|linear least squares]] the model contains equations which are linear in the parameters appearing in the parameter vector &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\beta&lt;/math&gt;, so the residuals are given by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r=y-X\boldsymbol\beta}.&lt;/math&gt;
There are ''m'' observations in '''y''' and ''n'' parameters in '''β''' with ''m''&gt;''n''. '''X''' is a ''m''×''n'' matrix whose elements are either constants or functions of the independent variables, '''x'''. The weight matrix '''W''' is, ideally, the inverse of the [[variance-covariance matrix]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf M_y&lt;/math&gt; of the observations '''y'''. The independent variables are assumed to be error-free. The parameter estimates are found by setting the gradient equations to zero, which results in the normal equations
&lt;ref group="note"&gt;An alternative form is &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X^TWX\boldsymbol\Delta \boldsymbol\beta=X^T W \boldsymbol\Delta y}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\Delta \boldsymbol\beta&lt;/math&gt; is the parameter shift from some starting estimate of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\beta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\Delta \mathbf y&lt;/math&gt; is the difference between '''y''' and the value calculated using the starting value of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\beta&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X^TWX\boldsymbol\beta=X^T Wy}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Allowing observation errors in all variables===

Now, suppose that both '''x''' and '''y''' are observed subject to error, with variance-covariance matrices &lt;math&gt;\mathbf M_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf M_y&lt;/math&gt; respectively. In this case the objective function can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;S=\mathbf{r_x^TM_x^{-1}r_x+r_y^TM_y^{-1}r_y},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf r_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf r_y&lt;/math&gt; are the residuals in '''x''' and '''y''' respectively. Clearly these residuals cannot be independent of each other, but they must be constrained by some kind of relationship. Writing the model function as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f(r_x,r_y,\boldsymbol\beta)}&lt;/math&gt;, the constraints are expressed by ''m'' [[condition equations]].&lt;ref&gt;W.E. Deming, Statistical Adjustment of Data, Wiley, 1943&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F=\Delta y -\frac{\partial f}{\partial r_x} r_x-\frac{\partial f}{\partial r_y} r_y -X\Delta\boldsymbol\beta=0}.&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, the problem is to minimize the objective function subject to the ''m'' constraints. It is solved by the use of [[Lagrange multipliers]]. After some algebraic manipulations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gans |first=Peter |title=Data Fitting in the Chemical Sciences |year=1992 |publisher=Wiley |isbn=9780471934127 |url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471934127.html |accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the result is obtained.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X^TM^{-1}X\Delta \boldsymbol\beta=X^T M^{-1} \Delta y}, &lt;/math&gt;

or alternatively &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X^TM^{-1}X \boldsymbol\beta=X^T M^{-1} y},&lt;/math&gt;
where '''M''' is the variance-covariance matrix relative to both independent and dependent variables.
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M=K_xM_xK_x^T+K_yM_yK_y^T;\ K_x=-\frac{\partial f}{\partial r_x},\ K_y=-\frac{\partial f}{\partial r_y}}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Example ===

When the data errors are uncorrelated, all matrices '''M''' and '''W''' are diagonal. Then, take the example of straight line fitting.
:&lt;math&gt;f(x_i,\beta)=\alpha + \beta x_i&lt;/math&gt;
in this case
:&lt;math&gt;M_{ii}=\sigma^2_{y,i}+\beta^2 \sigma^2_{x,i}&lt;/math&gt;
showing how the variance at the ''i''th point is determined by the variances of both independent and dependent variables and by the model being used to fit the data. The expression may be generalized by noting that the parameter &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is the slope of the line.
:&lt;math&gt;M_{ii}=\sigma^2_{y,i}+\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^2_i \sigma^2_{x,i}&lt;/math&gt;

An expression of this type is used in fitting [[Determination of equilibrium constants#Parameter errors and correlation|pH titration data]] where a small error on ''x'' translates to a large error on y when the slope is large.

=== Algebraic point of view ===
First of all it is necessary to note that the TLS problem does not have a solution in general, which was already shown in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;G. H. Golub and C. F. Van Loan, An analysis of the total least squares problem. Numer. Anal., 17, 1980, pp. 883–893.&lt;/ref&gt; The following considers the simple case where a unique solution exists without making any particular assumptions.

The computation of the TLS using [[singular value decomposition]] is described in standard texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}} pp 596.&lt;/ref&gt; We can solve the equation 
:&lt;math&gt;XB \approx Y&lt;/math&gt;
for ''B'' where ''X'' is ''m''-by-''n'' and ''Y'' is ''m''-by-''k''. &lt;ref group="note"&gt;The notation ''XB''&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;''Y'' is used here to reflect the notation used in the earlier part of the article.  In the computational literature the problem has been more commonly presented as ''AX''&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;''B'', i.e. with the letter ''X'' used for the ''n''-by-''k'' matrix of unknown regression coefficients.&lt;/ref&gt;

That is, we seek to find ''B'' that minimizes error matrices ''E'' and ''F'' for ''X'' and ''Y'' respectively. That is,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{argmin}_{E,F} \| [E\; F] \|_F, \qquad (X+E) B = Y+F&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;[E\; F]&lt;/math&gt; is the [[augmented matrix]] with ''E'' and ''F'' side by side and &lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\|_F&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Frobenius norm]], the square root of the sum of the squares of all entries in a matrix and so equivalently the square root of the sum of squares of the lengths of the rows or columns of the matrix.

This can be rewritten as
:&lt;math&gt;[(X+E) \; (Y+F)] \begin{bmatrix} B\\ -I_k\end{bmatrix} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;I_k&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;k\times k&lt;/math&gt; identity matrix.
The goal is then to find &lt;math&gt;[E\; F]&lt;/math&gt; that reduces the rank of &lt;math&gt;[X\; Y]&lt;/math&gt; by ''k''. Define &lt;math&gt;[U] [\Sigma] [V]^*&lt;/math&gt; to be the singular value decomposition of the augmented matrix &lt;math&gt;[X\; Y]&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;[X\; Y] = [U_X\; U_Y] \begin{bmatrix}\Sigma_X &amp;0 \\ 0 &amp; \Sigma_Y\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}V_{XX} &amp; V_{XY} \\ V_{YX} &amp; V_{YY}\end{bmatrix}^* =  [U_X\; U_Y] \begin{bmatrix}\Sigma_X &amp;0 \\ 0 &amp; \Sigma_Y\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} V_{XX}^* &amp; V_{YX}^* \\ V_{XY}^* &amp; V_{YY}^*\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''V'' is partitioned into blocks corresponding to the shape of ''X'' and ''Y''.

Using the [[Eckart–Young theorem]], the approximation minimising the norm of the error is such that matrices &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; are unchanged, while the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-smallest singular values are replaced with zeroes. That is, we want
:&lt;math&gt;[(X+E)\; (Y+F)] = [U_X\; U_Y] \begin{bmatrix}\Sigma_X &amp;0 \\ 0 &amp; 0_{k\times k}\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}V_{XX} &amp; V_{XY} \\ V_{YX} &amp; V_{YY}\end{bmatrix}^*&lt;/math&gt;
so by linearity,
:&lt;math&gt;[E\; F] = -[U_X\; U_Y] \begin{bmatrix}0_{n\times n} &amp;0 \\ 0 &amp; \Sigma_Y\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}V_{XX} &amp; V_{XY} \\ V_{YX} &amp; V_{YY}\end{bmatrix}^*. &lt;/math&gt;
We can then remove blocks from the ''U'' and Σ matrices, simplifying to
:&lt;math&gt;[E\; F] = -U_Y\Sigma_Y \begin{bmatrix}V_{XY}\\V_{YY}\end{bmatrix}^*= -[X\; Y] \begin{bmatrix}V_{XY}\\V_{YY}\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}V_{XY}\\ V_{YY}\end{bmatrix}^*.&lt;/math&gt;
This provides ''E'' and ''F'' so that 
:&lt;math&gt;[(X+E) \; (Y+F)] \begin{bmatrix}V_{XY}\\ V_{YY}\end{bmatrix} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
Now if &lt;math&gt;V_{YY}&lt;/math&gt; is nonsingular, which is not always the case (note that the behavior of TLS when &lt;math&gt;V_{YY}&lt;/math&gt; is singular is not well understood yet), we can then right multiply both sides by &lt;math&gt;-V_{YY}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; to bring the bottom block of the right matrix to the negative identity, giving&lt;ref&gt;Bjõrck, Ake (1996) ''Numerical Methods for Least Squares Problems'', Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics. {{ISBN|978-0898713602}} {{page needed|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;[(X+E) \; (Y+F)] \begin{bmatrix} -V_{XY} V_{YY}^{-1} \\ -V_{YY} V_{YY}^{-1}\end{bmatrix} = [(X+E) \; (Y+F)] \begin{bmatrix} B\\ -I_k\end{bmatrix} =  0 ,&lt;/math&gt;
and so
:&lt;math&gt;B=-V_{XY} V_{YY}^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

A naive [[GNU Octave]] implementation of this is:

&lt;source lang="matlab"&gt;
function B = tls(X,Y)

[m n]   = size(X);            % n is the width of X (X is m by n)
Z       = [X Y];              % Z is X augmented with Y.
[U S V] = svd(Z,0);           % find the SVD of Z.
VXY     = V(1:n,1+n:end);     % Take the block of V consisting of the first n rows and the n+1 to last column
VYY     = V(1+n:end,1+n:end); % Take the bottom-right block of V.
B       = -VXY/VYY;

end
&lt;/source&gt;

The way described above of solving the problem, which requires that the matrix &lt;math&gt;V_{YY}&lt;/math&gt; is nonsingular, can be slightly extended by the so-called ''classical TLS algorithm''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sabine Van Huffel|S. Van Huffel]] and J. Vandewalle (1991) ''The Total Least Squares Problems: Computational Aspects and Analysis''. SIAM Publications, Philadelphia PA.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Computation ===

The standard implementation of classical TLS algorithm is available through [http://www.netlib.org/vanhuffel/index.html Netlib], see also.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sabine Van Huffel|S. Van Huffel]], Documented Fortran 77 programs of the extended classical total least squares algorithm, the partial singular value decomposition algorithm and the partial total least squares algorithm, Internal Report ESAT-KUL 88/1, ESAT Lab., Dept. of Electrical Engineering, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Sabine Van Huffel|S. Van Huffel]], The extended classical total least squares algorithm, J. Comput. Appl. Math., 25, pp. 111–119, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; All modern implementations based, for example, on solving a sequence of ordinary least squares problems, approximate the matrix &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; (denoted &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; in the literature), as introduced by [[Sabine Van Huffel|Van Huffel]] and Vandewalle. It is worth noting, that this &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is, however, ''not the TLS solution'' in many cases.&lt;ref&gt;M. Plešinger, The Total Least Squares Problem and Reduction of Data in AX ≈ B.

Strakoš, and [[Sabine Van Huffel|S. Van Huffel]], The total least squares problem in AX ≈ B. A new classification with the relationship to the classical works.

== Non-linear model ==
For [[non-linear least squares|non-linear systems]] similar reasoning shows that the normal equations for an iteration cycle can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J^TM^{-1}J\Delta \boldsymbol\beta=J^T M^{-1} \Delta y}. &lt;/math&gt;

== Geometrical interpretation ==
{{main|Curve fitting#Algebraic fit versus geometric fit for curves}}
{{further|Orthogonal regression}}
When the independent variable is error-free a residual represents the "vertical" distance between the observed data point and the fitted curve (or surface). In total least squares a residual represents the distance between a data point and the fitted curve measured along some direction. In fact, if both variables are measured in the same units and the errors on both variables are the same, then the residual represents the [[distance from a point to a line|shortest distance between the data point and the fitted curve]], that is, the residual vector is perpendicular to the tangent of the curve. For this reason, this type of regression is sometimes called ''two dimensional Euclidean regression'' (Stein, 1983)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stein |first=Yaakov J. |title=Two Dimensional Euclidean Regression |url =http://www.dspcsp.com/pubs/euclreg.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''orthogonal regression''.

== Scale invariant methods ==
A serious difficulty arises if the variables are not measured in the same units. First consider measuring distance between a data point and the line, as in the diagram – what are the measurement units for this distance? If we consider measuring distance based on Pythagoras' Theorem then it is clear that we shall be adding quantities measured in different units, which is  meaningless. Secondly, if we rescale one of the variables e.g., measure in grams rather than kilograms, then we shall end up with different results (a different line). To avoid these problems it is sometimes suggested that we convert to dimensionless variables—this may be called normalization or standardization. However there are various ways of doing this, and these lead to fitted models which are not equivalent to each other. One approach is to normalize by known (or estimated) measurement precision thereby minimizing the [[Mahalanobis distance]] from the points to the line, providing a [[maximum-likelihood]] solution;{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} the unknown precisions could be found via [[analysis of variance]].

In short, total least squares does not have the property of units-invariance&amp;mdash;i.e. it is not [[scale invariance|scale invariant]]. For a meaningful model we require this property to hold. A way forward is to realise that residuals (distances) measured in different units can be combined if multiplication is used instead of addition. Consider fitting a line: for each data point the product of the vertical and horizontal residuals equals twice the area of the triangle formed by the residual lines and the fitted line. We choose the line which minimizes the sum of these areas. Nobel laureate [[Paul Samuelson]] proved in 1942 that, in two dimensions, it is the only line expressible solely in terms of the ratios of standard deviations and the correlation coefficient which (1) fits the correct equation when the observations fall on a straight line, (2) exhibits scale invariance, and (3) exhibits invariance under interchange of variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Samuelson |first=Paul A. |year=1942 |title=A Note on Alternative Regressions |journal=Econometrica |publisher=The Econometric Society |doi=10.2307/1907024 |jstor=1907024 |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=80–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; This solution has been rediscovered in different disciplines and is variously known as '''standardised major axis''' (Ricker 1975, Warton et al., 2006),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ricker |first=W.

'''Usenet''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|j|uː|z|n|ɛ|t}}) is a worldwide distributed discussion system available on computers. It was developed from the general-purpose [[UUCP|Unix-to-Unix Copy (UUCP)]] [[Dial-up Internet access|dial-up]] network architecture. [[Tom Truscott]] and [[Jim Ellis (computing)|Jim Ellis]] conceived the idea in 1979, and it was established in 1980.&lt;ref name="Lueg"&gt;''From Usenet to CoWebs: interacting with social information spaces'', Christopher Lueg, Danyel Fisher, Springer (2003), {{ISBN|1-85233-532-7}}, {{ISBN|978-1-85233-532-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users read and post messages (called ''articles'' or ''posts'', and collectively termed ''news'') to one or more categories, known as [[Usenet newsgroup|newsgroups]]. Usenet resembles a [[bulletin board system]] (BBS) in many respects and is the precursor to [[Internet forum]]s that are widely used today. Discussions are [[Threaded discussion|threaded]], as with web forums and BBSs, though posts are stored on the server sequentially. The name comes from the term "users network".&lt;ref&gt;[http://jargon-file.org/archive/jargon-4.4.7.dos.txt The jargon file v4.4.7] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105200447/http://jargon-file.org/archive/jargon-4.4.7.dos.txt |date=January 5, 2016 }}, Jargon File Archive.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/~hauben/book/ch106.x03 Chapter 3 - The Social Forces Behind The Development of Usenet] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804110914/http://www.columbia.edu/~hauben/book/ch106.x03 |date=August 4, 2016 }}, Netizens Netbook by Ronda Hauben and  Michael Hauben.&lt;/ref&gt;

One notable difference between a BBS or web forum and Usenet is the absence of a central server and dedicated administrator. Usenet is distributed among a large, constantly changing conglomeration of servers that store and forward messages to one another in so-called news feeds. Individual users may read messages from and post messages to a local server operated by a commercial usenet provider, their [[Internet service provider]], university, employer, or their own server.

Usenet has significant cultural importance in the networked world, having given rise to, or popularized, many widely recognized concepts and terms such as "[[FAQ]]", "[[flaming (Internet)|flame]]", and "[[spam (electronic)|spam]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsdemon.com/usenet_term_spam.php| title=USENET Newsgroup Terms – SPAM |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120915/http://www.newsdemon.com/usenet_term_spam.php |archivedate=2012-09-15 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
Usenet was conceived in 1979 and publicly established in 1980, at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] and [[Duke University]],{{r|emerson198310}}&lt;ref name="Lueg" /&gt; over a decade before the [[World Wide Web]] went online and the general public received access to the [[Internet]], making it one of the oldest [[computer network]] communications systems still in widespread use. It was originally built on the "poor man's [[ARPANET]]", employing UUCP as its transport protocol to offer mail and file transfers, as well as announcements through the newly developed [[Newsreader (Usenet)|news software]] such as [[A News]]. The name Usenet emphasized its creators' hope that the [[USENIX]] organization would take an active role in its operation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsdemon.com/first-official-announcement-usenet.php "Invitation to a General Access UNIX Network] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120924152631/http://www.newsdemon.com/first-official-announcement-usenet.php |date=September 24, 2012 }}", James Ellis and Tom Truscott, in First Official Announcement of USENET, NewsDemon (K&amp;L Technologies, Inc), 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

The articles that users post to Usenet are organized into topical categories known as [[Usenet newsgroup|newsgroups]], which are themselves logically organized into hierarchies of subjects. For instance, ''[news:sci.math sci.math]'' and ''[news:sci.physics sci.physics]'' are within the ''sci.*'' hierarchy, for science. Or, ''[news:talk.origins talk.origins]'' and ''[news:talk.atheism talk.atheism]'' are in the ''talk.*'' hierarchy. When a user subscribes to a newsgroup, the [[news client]] software keeps track of which articles that user has read.&lt;ref&gt;Lehnert, Wendy G.; Kopec, Richard (2007). ''Web 101.'' Addison Wesley. p. 291. {{ISBN|9780321424679}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most newsgroups, the majority of the articles are responses to some other article. The set of articles that can be traced to one single non-reply article is called a [[Threaded discussion|thread]]. Most modern newsreaders display the articles arranged into threads and subthreads.

When a user posts an article, it is initially only available on that user's news server. Each news server talks to one or more other servers (its "newsfeeds") and [[#Technical details|exchanges]] articles with them. In this fashion, the article is copied from [[inter-server|server to server]] and should eventually reach every server in the network. The later [[peer-to-peer]] networks operate on a similar principle, but for Usenet it is normally the sender, rather than the receiver, who initiates transfers. Usenet was designed under conditions when networks were much slower and not always available. Many sites on the original Usenet network would connect only once or twice a day to batch-transfer messages in and out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dga/15-849/store_and_forward.html |title=Store And Forward Communication: UUCP and FidoNet |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120630/http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dga/15-849/store_and_forward.html |archivedate=2012-06-30 |deadurl=no}}. Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science.&lt;/ref&gt; This is largely because the [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]] network was typically used for transfers, and phone charges were lower at night.

The format and transmission of Usenet articles is similar to that of Internet [[e-mail]] messages. The difference between the two is that Usenet articles can be read by any user whose news server carries the group to which the message was posted, as opposed to email messages, which have one or more specific recipients.&lt;ref&gt;Kozierok, Charles M. (2005). ''The TCP/IP guide: a comprehensive, illustrated Internet protocols reference.'' No Starch Press. p. 1401. {{ISBN|978-159327-047-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Usenet has diminished in importance with respect to [[Internet forum]]s, [[blog]]s and [[mailing list]]s. Usenet differs from such media in several ways: Usenet requires no personal registration with the group concerned; information need not be stored on a remote server; archives are always available; and reading the messages requires not a mail or web client, but a news client. The groups in ''[[alt.binaries]]'' are still widely used for data transfer.

==ISPs, news servers, and newsfeeds==
Many Internet service providers, and many other Internet sites, operate [[news server]]s for their users to access. ISPs that do not operate their own servers directly will often offer their users an account from another provider that specifically operates newsfeeds. In early news implementations, the server and newsreader were a single program suite, running on the same system. Today, one uses separate newsreader client software, a program that resembles an email client but accesses Usenet servers instead. Some clients such as [[Mozilla Thunderbird]] and [[Outlook Express]] provide both abilities.

Not all ISPs run news servers. A news server is one of the most difficult Internet services to administer because of the large amount of data involved, small customer base (compared to mainstream Internet services such as email and web access), and a disproportionately high volume of customer support incidents (frequently complaining of missing news articles that are not the ISP's fault). Some ISPs outsource news operation to specialist sites, which will usually appear to a user as though the ISP ran the server itself. Many sites carry a restricted newsfeed, with a limited number of newsgroups. Commonly omitted from such a newsfeed are foreign-language newsgroups and the ''[[alt.* hierarchy|alt.binaries]]'' hierarchy which largely carries software, music, videos and images, and accounts for over 99 percent of article data.

There are also Usenet providers that specialize in offering service to users whose ISPs do not carry news, or that carry a restricted feed.

See also [[news server operation]] for an overview of how news systems are implemented.

===Newsreaders===
Newsgroups are typically accessed with [[Newsreader (Usenet)|newsreaders]]: applications that allow users to read and reply to postings in newsgroups. These applications act as [[Client (computing)|clients]] to one or more news servers. Although historically, Usenet was associated with the [[Unix]] operating system developed at [[AT&amp;T]], newsreaders are available for all major operating systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmoz.org/Computers/Software/Internet/Clients/Usenet/ |title=Open Directory Usenet Clients |publisher=Dmoz.org |date=October 9, 2008 |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120730/http://www.dmoz.org/Computers/Software/Internet/Clients/Usenet/ |archivedate=2012-07-30 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern mail clients or "communication suites" commonly also have an integrated newsreader. Often, however, these integrated clients are of low quality, compared to standalone newsreaders, and incorrectly implement Usenet protocols, standards and conventions. Many of these integrated clients, for example the one in [[Microsoft]]'s Outlook Express, are disliked by purists because of their misbehavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

With the rise of the World Wide Web (WWW), web [[front end processor (program)|front-ends]] (web2news) have become more common. Web front ends have lowered the technical entry barrier requirements to that of one application and no Usenet NNTP server account. There are numerous websites now offering web based gateways to Usenet groups, although some people have begun filtering messages made by some of the web interfaces for one reason or another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Improve-Usenet| date = October 13, 2008| url = http://improve-usenet.org |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120713/http://improve-usenet.org |archivedate=2012-07-13 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Improve-Usenet Comments| date = October 13, 2008| url = http://improve-usenet.org/voices1.html | accessdate =June 29, 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080426174022/http://improve-usenet.org/voices1.html |archivedate = April 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Google Groups]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/ |title=Google Groups |publisher=Groups.google.com |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120525/http://groups.google.com/ |archivedate=2012-05-25 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one such web based front end and some [[web browser]]s can access Google Groups via news: protocol links directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mykzilla.blogspot.com/2008/11/news-links-to-google-groups.html| title=News: links to Google Groups |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120712/http://mykzilla.blogspot.com/2008/11/news-links-to-google-groups.html |archivedate=2012-07-12 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moderated and unmoderated newsgroups===
A minority of newsgroups are moderated, meaning that messages submitted by readers are not distributed directly to Usenet, but instead are emailed to the moderators of the newsgroup for approval. The moderator is to receive submitted articles, review them, and inject approved articles so that they can be properly propagated worldwide. Articles approved by a moderator must bear the Approved: header line. Moderators ensure that the messages that readers see in the newsgroup conform to the charter of the newsgroup, though they are not required to follow any such rules or guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.big-8.org/wiki/Moderated_Newsgroups#Who_can_force_the_moderators_to_obey_the_group_charter.3F |title=Who can force the moderators to obey the group charter? |publisher=Big-8.org |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120804/http://www.big-8.org/wiki/Moderated_Newsgroups%23Who_can_force_the_moderators_to_obey_the_group_charter.3F#Who_can_force_the_moderators_to_obey_the_group_charter.3F |archivedate=August 4, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, moderators are appointed in the proposal for the newsgroup, and changes of moderators follow a succession plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.big-8.org/wiki/Moderated_Newsgroups#How_does_a_group_change_moderators.3F |title=How does a group change moderators? |publisher=Big-8.org |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120719/http://www.big-8.org/wiki/Moderated_Newsgroups%23How_does_a_group_change_moderators.3F#How_does_a_group_change_moderators.3F |archivedate=July 19, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, a ''mod.*'' hierarchy existed before Usenet reorganization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livinginternet.com/u/ui_early.htm |title=Early Usenet Newsgroup Hierarchies |publisher=Livinginternet.com |date=October 25, 1990 |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120921/http://www.livinginternet.com/u/ui_early.htm |archivedate=2012-09-21 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now, moderated newsgroups may appear in any hierarchy, typically with &lt;tt&gt;.moderated&lt;/tt&gt; added to the group name.

Usenet newsgroups in the [[Big 8 (Usenet)|Big-8 hierarchy]] are created by proposals called a Request for Discussion, or RFD. The RFD is required to have the following information: newsgroup name, checkgroups file entry, and moderated or unmoderated status. If the group is to be moderated, then at least one moderator with a valid email address must be provided. Other information which is beneficial but not required includes: a charter, a rationale, and a moderation policy if the group is to be moderated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.big-8.org/wiki/How_to_Create_a_New_Big-8_Newsgroup |title=How to Create a New Big-8 Newsgroup |publisher=Big-8.org |date=July 7, 2010 |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120722/http://www.big-8.org/wiki/How_to_Create_a_New_Big-8_Newsgroup |archivedate=July 22, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussion of the new newsgroup proposal follows, and is finished with the members of the Big-8 Management Board making the decision, by vote, to either approve or disapprove the new newsgroup.

Unmoderated newsgroups form the majority of Usenet newsgroups, and messages submitted by readers for unmoderated newsgroups are immediately propagated for everyone to see. Minimal editorial content filtering vs propagation speed form one crux of the Usenet community. One little cited defense of propagation is canceling a propagated message, but few Usenet users use this command and some news readers do not offer [[Cancel message#cancel|cancellation commands]], in part because article storage expires in relatively short order anyway. Almost all unmoderated Usenet groups have become collections of [[spam (electronic)|spam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TxaoAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA168&amp;ots=vsxrAQqzZx&amp;dq=usenet%20spam%20prevalence&amp;pg=PA168#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Social Machine: Designs for Living Online|quote=Today, Usenet still exists, but it is an unsociable morass of spam, porn, and pirated software}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/issue-sections/features-issue-sections/12223/markovian-parallax-denigrate-usenet-spam/|title=Unraveling the Internet’s oldest and weirdest mystery|quote=Groups filled with spam, massive fights took place against spammers and over what to do about the spam.

Creation of moderated newsgroups often becomes a hot subject of controversy, raising issues regarding censorship and the desire of a subset of users to form an [[intentional community]].{{citation needed |date=August 2014}}

===Technical details===
Usenet is a set of protocols for generating, storing and retrieving news "articles" (which resemble Internet mail messages) and for exchanging them among a readership which is potentially widely distributed. These protocols most commonly use a [[flooding algorithm]] which propagates copies throughout a network of participating servers. Whenever a message reaches a server, that server forwards the message to all its network neighbors that haven't yet seen the article. Only one copy of a message is stored per server, and each server makes it available on demand to the (typically local) readers able to access that server. The collection of Usenet servers has thus a certain [[peer-to-peer]] character in that they share resources by exchanging them, the granularity of exchange however is on a different scale than a modern peer-to-peer system and this characteristic excludes the actual users of the system who connect to the news servers with a typical client-server application, much like an email reader.

RFC 850 was the first formal specification of the messages exchanged by Usenet servers. It was superseded by RFC 1036 and subsequently by RFC 5536 and RFC 5537.

In cases where unsuitable content has been posted, Usenet has support for automated removal of a posting from the whole network by creating a cancel message, although due to a lack of authentication and resultant abuse, this capability is frequently disabled. Copyright holders may still request the manual deletion of infringing material using the provisions of [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] treaty implementations, such as the United States [[Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act]], but this would require giving notice to each individual news server administrator.

On the Internet, Usenet is transported via the [[Network News Transfer Protocol]] (NNTP) on [[Computer port (software)|TCP Port]] 119 for standard, unprotected connections and on TCP port 563 for [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]] encrypted connections which is offered only by a few sites.

===Organization===
[[File:Usenet Big Nine.svg|thumb|right|The "Big Nine" hierarchies of Usenet]]

The major set of worldwide newsgroups is contained within nine hierarchies, eight of which are operated under consensual guidelines that govern their administration and naming. The current ''[[Big 8 (Usenet)|Big Eight]]'' are:
* ''comp.*'' – computer-related discussions (''comp.software'', ''comp.sys.amiga'')
* ''humanities.*'' – [[fine art]]s, [[literature]], and [[philosophy]] (''humanities.classics'', ''humanities.design.misc'')
* ''misc.*'' – miscellaneous topics (''misc.education'', ''misc.forsale'', ''misc.kids'')
* ''news.*'' – discussions and announcements about news (meaning Usenet, not current events) (''news.groups'', ''news.admin'')
* ''rec.*'' – recreation and entertainment (''rec.music'', ''rec.arts.movies'')
* ''sci.*'' – science related discussions (''sci.psychology'', ''sci.research'')
* ''soc.*'' – social discussions (''soc.college.org'', ''soc.culture.{{sic|hide=y|african}}'')
* ''talk.*'' – talk about various controversial topics (''talk.religion'', ''talk.politics'', ''[[talk.origins]]'')

See also the [[Great Renaming]].

The [[alt.* hierarchy|''alt.*'' hierarchy]] is not subject to the procedures controlling groups in the Big Eight, and it is as a result less organized. Groups in the ''alt.*'' hierarchy tend to be more specialized or specific—for example, there might be a newsgroup under the Big Eight which contains discussions about children's books, but a group in the alt hierarchy may be dedicated to one specific author of children's books. [[Binaries]] are posted in ''alt.binaries.*'', making it the largest of all the hierarchies.

Many other hierarchies of newsgroups are distributed alongside these. Regional and language-specific hierarchies such as ''{{sic|hide=y|japan}}.*'', ''{{sic|hide=y|malta}}.*'' and ''ne.*'' serve specific countries and regions such as [[Japan]], [[Malta]] and [[New England]]. Companies and projects administer their own hierarchies to discuss their products and offer community technical support, such as the historical ''{{sic|hide=y|gnu}}.*'' hierarchy from the [[Free Software Foundation]]. [[Microsoft]] closed its newsserver in June 2010, providing support for its products over forums now.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/communities/newsgroups/default.mspx Microsoft Responds to the Evolution of Communities] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918084608/http://www.microsoft.com/communities/newsgroups/default.mspx |date=September 18, 2012 }}, Announcement, undated. {{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-20004109-56.html |title=Microsoft hitting 'unsubscribe' on newsgroups |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120712/http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-20004109-56.html |archivedate=2012-07-12 |deadurl=no }}, CNET, May 4, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Some users prefer to use the term "Usenet" to refer only to the Big Eight hierarchies; others include alt as well. The more general term "netnews" incorporates the entire medium, including private organizational news systems.

Informal sub-hierarchy conventions also exist. ''*.answers'' are typically moderated cross-post groups for FAQs. An FAQ would be posted within one group and a cross post to the ''*.answers'' group at the head of the hierarchy seen by some as a refining of information in that news group. Some subgroups are recursive—to the point of some silliness in ''alt.*''{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}.

===Binary content===
[[File:Usenet Binaries Upload process.PNG|thumb|300px|A visual example of the many complex steps required to prepare data to be uploaded to Usenet newsgroups. These steps must be done again in reverse to download data from Usenet.]]

Usenet was originally created to distribute text content encoded in the 7-[[bit]] [[ASCII]] character set. With the help of programs that encode 8-bit values into ASCII, it became practical to distribute [[binary file]]s as content. Binary posts, due to their size and often-dubious copyright status, were in time restricted to specific newsgroups, making it easier for administrators to allow or disallow the traffic.

The oldest widely used encoding method for binary content is [[uuencode]], from the [[Unix]] UUCP package. In the late 1980s, Usenet articles were often limited to 60,000 characters, and larger hard limits exist today. Files are therefore commonly split into sections that require reassembly by the reader.

With the header extensions and the [[Base64]] and Quoted-Printable [[MIME]] encodings, there was a new generation of binary transport. In practice, MIME has seen increased adoption in text messages, but it is avoided for most binary attachments. Some operating systems with [[metadata (computing)|metadata]] attached to files use specialized encoding formats. For Mac OS, both [[Binhex]] and special MIME types are used.

Other lesser known encoding systems that may have been used at one time were [[BTOA]], [[Xxencode|XX encoding]], [[BOO (encoding)|BOO]], and [[USR encoding]].

In an attempt to reduce file transfer times, an informal file encoding known as [[yEnc]] was introduced in 2001. It achieves about a 30% reduction in data transferred by assuming that most 8-bit characters can safely be transferred across the network without first encoding into the 7-bit ASCII space.

The most common method of uploading large binary posts to Usenet is to convert the files into [[RAR (file format)|RAR]] archives and create [[Parchive]] files for them. Parity files are used to recreate missing data when not every part of the files reaches a server.

====Binary retention time====
[[File:Usenet-total-storage.jpg|thumb|300px|This is a list of some of the biggest binary groups. With 1341+ days retention, the (binary) Usenet storage (which binsearch.info indexes) is more than 33 [[petabyte]]s (33000 [[terabyte]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.binsearch.info/groupinfo.php |title=Usenet storage is more than 33 petabytes (33000 terabytes) |publisher=binsearch.info |accessdate=October 7, 2016 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120921/https://www.binsearch.info/groupinfo.php |archivedate=2012-09-21 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Each news server generally allocates a certain amount of storage space for post content in each newsgroup. When this storage has been filled, each time a new post arrives, old posts are deleted to make room for the new content. If the network bandwidth available to a server is high but the storage allocation is small, it is possible for a huge flood of incoming content to overflow the allocation and push out everything that was in the group before it. If the flood is large enough, the beginning of the flood will begin to be deleted even before the last part of the flood has been posted.

Binary newsgroups are only able to function reliably if there is sufficient storage allocated to a group to allow readers enough time to download all parts of a binary posting before it is flushed out of the group's storage allocation. This was at one time how posting of undesired content was countered; the newsgroup would be flooded with random garbage data posts, of sufficient quantity to push out all the content to be suppressed. This has been compensated by service providers allocating enough storage to retain everything posted each day, including such spam floods, without deleting anything.

The average length of time that posts are able to stay in the group before being deleted is commonly called the ''retention time''. Generally the larger Usenet servers have enough capacity to archive several years of binary content even when flooded with new data at the maximum daily speed available. A good binaries service provider must not only accommodate users of fast connections (3 megabit) but also users of slow connections (256 kilobit or less) who need more time to download content over a period of several days or weeks.

Major NSPs{{what|date=July 2018}} have a retention time of more than 4 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giganews.com/faq.html#q0.4 |title=Giganews FAQ – How long are articles available? |publisher=Giganews.com |accessdate=October 23, 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120904/http://www.giganews.com/faq.html%23q0.4 |archivedate=2012-09-04 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This results in more than 33 [[petabyte]]s (33000 [[terabyte]]s) of storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giganews.com/blog/2011/05/announcing-1000-days-retention-prize.html
 |title=9 petabyte of usenet storage on giganews.com |publisher=giganews.com |accessdate=February 14, 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120921/http://www.giganews.com/blog/2011/05/announcing-1000-days-retention-prize.html |archivedate=2012-09-21 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In part because of such long retention times, as well as growing Internet [[upload]] speeds, Usenet is also used by individual users to store [[backup]] data in a practice called ''Usenet backup'', or uBackup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wikihow.com/Backup-Your-Data-on-Usenet-%28Ubackup%29 |title=usenet backup (uBackup) |publisher=Wikihow.com |accessdate=February 14, 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120918/http://www.wikihow.com/Backup-Your-Data-on-Usenet-%28Ubackup%29 |archivedate=2012-09-18 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; While commercial providers offer more [[ease of use|easy to use]] [[List of online backup services|online backup services]], storing data on Usenet is free of charge (although access to Usenet itself may not be). The method requires the user to [[Backup#Data repository models|manually select, prepare and upload the data]]. Because anyone can potentially download the backup files, the data is typically [[encryption|encrypted]]. After the files are uploaded, the uploader does not have any control over them; the files are automatically copied to all Usenet providers, so there will be multiple copies of it spread over different geographical locations around the world—desirable in a backup scheme.

====Legal issues====
While binary newsgroups can be used to distribute completely legal user-created works, open-source software, and public domain material, some binary groups are used to illegally distribute commercial software, copyrighted media, and obscene material.

ISP-operated Usenet servers frequently block access to all ''alt.binaries.*'' groups to both reduce network traffic and to avoid related legal issues. Commercial Usenet service providers claim to operate as a telecommunications service, and assert that they are not responsible for the user-posted binary content transferred via their equipment. In the United States, Usenet providers can qualify for protection under the [[DMCA]] [[Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act|Safe Harbor regulations]], provided that they establish a mechanism to comply with and respond to takedown notices from copyright holders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.supernews.com/docs/dmca.html |title=Digital Millenium Copyright Act|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120910/http://www.supernews.com/docs/dmca.html |archivedate=2012-09-10 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Removal of copyrighted content from the entire Usenet network is a nearly impossible task, due to the rapid propagation between servers and the retention done by each server. Petitioning a Usenet provider for removal only removes it from that one server's retention cache, but not any others. It is possible for a special ''post cancellation'' message to be distributed to remove it from all servers, but many providers ignore [[Cancel message|cancel]] messages by standard policy, because they can be easily falsified and submitted by anyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cancel Messages FAQ |url=http://wiki.killfile.org/projects/usenet/faqs/cancel/|accessdate=June 29, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215161039/http://www.killfile.org/faqs/cancel.html |archivedate=February 15, 2008 |quote=...Until authenticated cancels catch on, there are no options to avoid forged cancels and allow unforged ones...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Microsoft knowledgebase article stating that many servers ignore cancel messages {{cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/q164420/ |title=Support.microsoft.com |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120719/http://support.microsoft.com/kb/q164420/ |archivedate=2012-07-19 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a takedown petition to be most effective across the whole network, it would have to be issued to the origin server to which the content has been posted, before it has been propagated to other servers. Removal of the content at this early stage would prevent further propagation, but with modern high speed links, content can be propagated as fast as it arrives, allowing no time for content review and takedown issuance by copyright holders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.measurement.sk/2005/S1/Surmacz.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - Surmacz.doc |format=PDF |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521051120/http://www.measurement.sk/2005/S1/Surmacz.pdf |archive-date=May 21, 2013 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Establishing the identity of the person posting illegal content is equally difficult due to the trust-based design of the network. Like [[SMTP]] email, servers generally assume the header and origin information in a post is true and accurate. However, as in SMTP email, Usenet post headers are easily falsified so as to obscure the true identity and location of the message source.&lt;ref&gt;''...every part of a Usenet post may be forged apart from the left most portion of the "Path:" header...'' {{cite web |url=http://www.by-users.co.uk/faqs/email/headers/ |title=By-users.co.uk |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120723/http://www.by-users.co.uk/faqs/email/headers/ |archivedate=2012-07-23 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this manner, Usenet is significantly different from modern P2P services; most P2P users distributing content are typically immediately identifiable to all other users by their [[network address]], but the origin information for a Usenet posting can be completely obscured and unobtainable once it has propagated past the original server.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup|message-id=StUPidfuk01@uunet.uu.net|newsgroup=news.admin.misc|title=Better living through forgery |url=http://groups.google.com/group/news.admin.misc/msg/9f6aa173f228ac6a?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain|date=1995-06-10 |accessdate=December 5, 2014|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120724/http://groups.google.com/group/news.admin.misc/msg/9f6aa173f228ac6a?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |archivedate=2012-07-24 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also unlike modern P2P services, the identity of the downloaders is hidden from view. On P2P services a downloader is identifiable to all others by their network address. On Usenet, the downloader connects directly to a server, and only the server knows the address of who is connecting to it. Some Usenet providers do keep usage logs, but not all make this logged information casually available to outside parties such as the [[Recording Industry Association of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giganews.com/legal/privacy.html |title=Giganews Privacy Policy |publisher=Giganews.com |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120731/http://www.giganews.com/legal/privacy.html |archivedate=2012-07-31 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aioe.org/index.php?logging-policy |title=Logging Policy |publisher=Aioe.org |date=June 9, 2005 |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120708/http://aioe.org/index.php?logging-policy |archivedate=July 8, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of anonymising gateways to USENET also complicates the tracing of a postings true origin.

Newsgroup experiments first occurred in 1979. [[Tom Truscott]] and [[Jim Ellis (computing)|Jim Ellis]] of [[Duke University]] came up with the idea as a replacement for a local announcement program, and established a link with nearby [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]] using [[Bourne shell]] scripts written by [[Steve Bellovin]]. The public release of [[A News|news]] was in the form of conventional compiled [[software]], written by Steve Daniel and Truscott.&lt;ref name="emerson198310"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1983-10/1983_10_BYTE_08-10_UNIX#page/n219/mode/2up | title=Usenet / A Bulletin Board for Unix Users | work=BYTE | date=October 1983 | accessdate=31 January 2015 | author=Emerson, Sandra L. | pages=219–236}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;LaQuey, Tracy (1990). ''The User's directory of computer networks.'' Digital Press. p. 386. {{ISBN|978-1555580476}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, Usenet was connected to [[ARPANET]] through {{nowrap|UC Berkeley}} which had connections to both Usenet and ARPANET. [[Mary Ann Horton|Mark Horton]], the graduate student who set up the connection, began "feeding mailing lists from the ARPANET into Usenet" with the "fa" ("From ARPANET"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oreillynet.com/network/2001/12/21/usenet.html|title=And So It Begins|access-date=September 15, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100715195100/http://www.oreillynet.com/network/2001/12/21/usenet.html|archive-date=July 15, 2010|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;) identifier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.let.leidenuniv.nl/history/ivh/chap3.htm|title=History of the Internet, Chapter Three: History of Electronic Mail|access-date=September 15, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812153615/http://www.let.leidenuniv.nl/history/ivh/chap3.htm|archive-date=August 12, 2014|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usenet gained 50 member sites in its first year, including [[Reed College]], [[University of Oklahoma]], and [[Bell Labs]],{{r|emerson198310}} and the number of people using the network increased dramatically; however, it was still a while longer before Usenet users could contribute to ARPANET.&lt;ref&gt;Hauben, Michael and Hauben, Ronda. "[http://www.columbia.edu/~rh120/ Netizens: On the History and Impact of Usenet and the Internet, On the Early Days of Usenet: The Roots of the Cooperative Online Culture] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610060052/http://www.columbia.edu/~rh120/ |date=June 10, 2015 }}".

===Network===
UUCP networks spread quickly due to the lower costs involved, and the ability to use existing leased lines, [[X.25]] links or even [[ARPANET]] connections. By 1983, thousands of people participated from more than 500 hosts, mostly universities and Bell Labs sites but also a growing number of Unix-related companies; the number of hosts nearly doubled to 940 in 1984. More than 100 newsgroups existed, more than 20 devoted to Unix and other computer-related topics, and at least a third to recreation.&lt;ref&gt;Haddadi, H. (2006). "[http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~hamed/papers/mphil.pdf Network Traffic Inference Using Sampled Statistics] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117133532/http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~hamed/papers/mphil.pdf |date=November 17, 2015 }}". University College London.&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|emerson198310}} As the mesh of UUCP hosts rapidly expanded, it became desirable to distinguish the Usenet subset from the overall network. A vote was taken at the 1982 USENIX conference to choose a new name. The name Usenet was retained, but it was established that it only applied to news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Horton| first = Mark| title = Arachnet| date = December 11, 1990 |url = http://communication.ucsd.edu/bjones/Usenet.Hist/Nethist/0111.html |accessdate=4 June 2007 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120921/http://communication.ucsd.edu/bjones/Usenet.Hist/Nethist/0111.html |archivedate=2012-09-21 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name UUCPNET became the common name for the overall network.

In addition to UUCP, early Usenet traffic was also exchanged with [[Fidonet]] and other dial-up [[Bulletin board system|BBS]] networks. Widespread use of Usenet by the BBS community was facilitated by the introduction of UUCP feeds made possible by MS-DOS implementations of UUCP, such as UFGATE (UUCP to FidoNet Gateway), FSUUCP and UUPC. In 1986, RFC 977 provided the [[Network News Transfer Protocol]] (NNTP) specification for distribution of Usenet articles over [[Internet protocol suite|TCP/IP]] as a more flexible alternative to informal Internet transfers of UUCP traffic. Since the Internet boom of the 1990s, almost all Usenet distribution is over NNTP.&lt;ref&gt;Huston, Geoff (1999). ''ISP survival guide: strategies for running a competitive ISP.'' Wiley. p. 439.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Software===
Early versions of Usenet used Duke's [[A News]] software, designed for one or two articles a day. Matt Glickman and Horton at Berkeley produced an improved version called [[B News]] that could handle the rising traffic (about 50 articles a day as of late 1983).{{r|emerson198310}} With a message format that offered compatibility with Internet mail and improved performance, it became the dominant server software. [[C News]], developed by [[Geoff Collyer]] and [[Henry Spencer]] at the [[University of Toronto]], was comparable to B News in features but offered considerably faster processing. In the early 1990s, [[InterNetNews]] by [[Rich Salz]] was developed to take advantage of the continuous message flow made possible by NNTP versus the batched store-and-forward design of UUCP. Since that time [[InterNetNews|INN]] development has continued, and other news server software has also been developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsreaders.com/unix/servers.html |title=Unix/Linux news servers |publisher=Newsreaders.com |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120905/http://www.newsreaders.com/unix/servers.html |archivedate=2012-09-05 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public venue===
Usenet was the first Internet community and the place for many of the most important public developments in the pre-commercial Internet. It was the place where [[Tim Berners-Lee]] announced the launch of the [[World Wide Web]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup| title = WorldWideWeb: Summary| author = Tim Berners-Lee| date = August 6, 1991| newsgroup = alt.hypertext|message-id= 6487@cernvax.cern.ch|url = http://groups.google.com/group/alt.hypertext/msg/395f282a67a1916c| accessdate =June 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; where [[Linus Torvalds]] announced the [[Linux]] project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup | title = What would you like to see most in minix? | newsgroup = comp.os.minix |message-id= 1991Aug25.205708.9541@klaava.Helsinki.FI |url = http://groups.google.com/group/comp.os.minix/msg/b813d52cbc5a044b | last = Torvalds | first = Linus | accessdate =September 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and where [[Marc Andreessen]] announced the creation of the [[Mosaic browser]] and the introduction of the image tag,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup| title = NCSA Mosaic for X 0.10 available.| author = Marc Andreessen| date = March 15, 1993| newsgroup = comp.infosystems.gopher, comp.infosystems.wais, comp.infosystems, alt.hypertext, comp.windows.x| message-id = MARCA.93Mar14225600@wintermute.ncsa.uiuc.edu| url = http://groups.google.com/group/comp.windows.x/msg/7fde2f6d4d5dc4e7| accessdate = 4 June 2007| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060616013046/http://groups.google.com/group/comp.windows.x/msg/7fde2f6d4d5dc4e7| archive-date = June 16, 2006| dead-url = no| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which revolutionized the World Wide Web by turning it into a graphical medium.

===Internet jargon and history===
Many [[jargon]] terms now in common use on the Internet originated or were popularized on Usenet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, many conflicts which later spread to the rest of the Internet, such as the ongoing difficulties over [[spam (electronic)|spamming]], began on Usenet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Campbell|first=K.

Massive, difficult to redirect, awe-inspiring, entertaining, and a source of mind-boggling amounts of excrement when you least expect it." | [[Gene Spafford]], 1992}}

===Decline===
Sascha Segan of ''[[PC Magazine]]'' said in 2008 that "Usenet has been dying for years".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Segan |first1=Sascha |title=R.I.P Usenet: 1980-2008 |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2326849,00.asp |accessdate=July 21, 2017 |work=PC Magazine |date=July 31, 2008 |language=en |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120909/http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2326849,00.asp |archive-date=September 9, 2012 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Segan said that some people pointed to the [[Eternal September]] in 1993 as the beginning of Usenet's decline. Segan believes that when pornographers and software [[Copyright infringement|crackers]] began putting large (non-text) files on Usenet by the late 1990s, Usenet [[disk space]] and traffic increased correspondingly. Internet service providers questioned why they needed to host space for pornography and unauthorized software.  When the [[State of New York]] opened an investigation on [[child pornographer]]s who used Usenet, many ISPs dropped all Usenet access or access to the [[alt.* hierarchy|''alt.*'' hierarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2326849,00.asp |title=R.I.P Usenet: 1980–2008 |work=PC Magazine |author=Sascha Segan |date=July 31, 2008 |page=2|accessdate=May 8, 2011 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120909/http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2326849,00.asp |archivedate=2012-09-09 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, John Biggs of [[TechCrunch]] said "As long as there are folks who think a [[command line]] is better than a mouse, the original text-only [[Social networking service|social network]] will live on".&lt;ref&gt;"{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2008/08/01/the-reports-of-usenets-death-are-greatly-exaggerated/ |title=Reports of Usenet's Death Are Greatly Exaggerated |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120716/http://techcrunch.com/2008/08/01/the-reports-of-usenets-death-are-greatly-exaggerated/ |archivedate=2012-07-16 |deadurl=no}}." [[TechCrunch]]. August 1, 2008. Retrieved on May 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[AOL]] discontinued Usenet access in 2005. In May 2010, [[Duke University]], whose implementation had kicked off Usenet more than 30 years earlier, decommissioned its Usenet server, citing low usage and rising costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://today.duke.edu/2010/05/usenet.html |title=A Piece of Internet History |work=Duke Today |author=Cara Bonnett|date=May 17, 2010 |accessdate=May 24, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120711/http://news.duke.edu/2010/05/usenet.html |archivedate=2012-07-11 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/05/20/usenet_duke_server/ |title=Usenet's home shuts down today |work=The Register |author=Andrew Orlowski |date=May 20, 2010 |accessdate=May 24, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120921/https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/05/20/usenet_duke_server/ |archivedate=2012-09-21 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After 32 years, the Usenet news service link at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (news.unc.edu) was retired on February 4, 2011.

==Usenet traffic changes==
Over time, the amount of Usenet traffic has steadily increased. {{As of | 2010}} the number of all text posts made in all Big-8 newsgroups averaged 1,800 new messages every hour, with an average of 25,000 messages per day.&lt;ref name="newsadmin1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsadmin.com/top100tmsgs.asp |title=Top 100 text newsgroups by postings |publisher=NewsAdmin |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061016004305/http://www.newsadmin.com/top100tmsgs.asp |archivedate=October 16, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these averages are minuscule in comparison to the traffic in the binary groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsadmin.com/top100bmsgs.asp |title=Top 100 binary newsgroups by postings |publisher=NewsAdmin |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061016004534/http://www.newsadmin.com/top100bmsgs.asp |archivedate=October 16, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this traffic increase reflects not an increase in discrete users or newsgroup discussions, but instead the combination of massive automated spamming and an increase in the use of ''.binaries'' newsgroups&lt;ref name="newsadmin1"/&gt; in which large files are often posted publicly. A small sampling of the change (measured in feed size per day) follows:

In 2008, [[Verizon Communications]], [[Time Warner Cable]] and [[Sprint Nextel]] signed an agreement with [[Attorney General of New York]] [[Andrew Cuomo]] to shut down access to sources of [[child pornography]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosencrance, Lisa. {{cite web |url=http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9095778 |title=3 top ISPs to block access to sources of child porn |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120722/http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9095778 |archivedate=2012-07-22 |deadurl=no}}.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distributed archiving of Usenet posts was suggested in November 1982 by Scott Orshan, who proposed that "Every site should keep all the articles it posted, forever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/net.news/msg/e8145eace8aa0529?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |title=Distributed archiving of netnews |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120708/http://groups.google.com/group/net.news/msg/e8145eace8aa0529?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |archivedate=2012-07-08 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in November of that year, Rick Adams responded to a post asking "Has anyone archived netnews, or does anyone plan to?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/net.news/msg/a9ad42b15688b910?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |title=Archive of netnews |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120724/http://groups.google.com/group/net.news/msg/a9ad42b15688b910?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |archivedate=2012-07-24 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; by stating that he was, "afraid to admit it, but I started archiving most 'useful' newsgroups as of September 18."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/net.news/msg/87c9160730b36989?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |title=Re: Archive of netnews |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120715/http://groups.google.com/group/net.news/msg/87c9160730b36989?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |archivedate=2012-07-15 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1982, Gregory G. Woodbury proposed an "automatic access to archives" system that consisted of "automatic answering of fixed-format messages to a special mail recipient on specified machines."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/net.general/msg/a377e12ab1a829ff?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |title=Automatic access to archives |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120712/http://groups.google.com/group/net.general/msg/a377e12ab1a829ff?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |archivedate=2012-07-12 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, two news archiving systems and one [[Request for Comments|RFC]] were posted to the Internet. The first system, called keepnews, by Mark M. Swenson of [[The University of Arizona]], was described as "a program that attempts to provide a sane way of extracting and keeping information that comes over Usenet." The main advantage of this system was to allow users to mark articles as worthwhile to retain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/net.sources/msg/737d29fd3af2d5ae?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |title=keepnews – A Usenet news archival system |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120717/http://groups.google.com/group/net.sources/msg/737d29fd3af2d5ae?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |archivedate=2012-07-17 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second system, YA News Archiver by Chuq Von Rospach, was similar to keepnews, but was "designed to work with much larger archives where the wonderful quadratic search time feature of the Unix ... becomes a real problem."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/net.sources/msg/d5c0cec804f745dd?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |title=YA News Archiver |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120709/http://groups.google.com/group/net.sources/msg/d5c0cec804f745dd?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |archivedate=2012-07-09 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Von Rospach in early 1985 posted a detailed RFC for "archiving and accessing usenet articles with [[Index term|keyword]] lookup." This RFC described a program that could "generate and
maintain an archive of Usenet articles and allow looking up articles based on the article-id, subject lines, or keywords pulled out of the article itself." Also included was [[C (programming language)|C]] code for the internal data structure of the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/net.news/msg/f26190057834ed87?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |title=RFC usenet article archive program with keyword lookup |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120715/http://groups.google.com/group/net.news/msg/f26190057834ed87?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |archivedate=2012-07-15 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The desire to have a fulltext search index of archived news articles is not new either, one such request having been made in April 1991 by [[Alex Martelli]] who sought to "build
some sort of keyword index for [the news archive]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/news.software.nn/msg/16381a7e3fd611d4?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |title=Looking for fulltext indexing software for archived news |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120921/http://groups.google.com/group/news.software.nn/msg/16381a7e3fd611d4?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |archivedate=2012-09-21 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early May, Mr. Martelli posted a summary of his responses to Usenet, noting that the "most popular suggestion award must definitely go to 'lq-text' package, by Liam Quin, recently posted in alt.sources."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/news.software.nn/msg/f503efa9034f1c1d?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |title=Summary: search for fulltext indexing software for archived news |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120708/http://groups.google.com/group/news.software.nn/msg/f503efa9034f1c1d?dmode=source&amp;output=gplain |archivedate=2012-07-08 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The huge site http://asstr.org archives and indexes erotic and pornographic stories posted to the Usenet group alt.sex.stories.

Today, the archiving of Usenet has led to a fear of loss of privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2326849,00.asp |title=R.I.P Usenet: 1980–2008 – Usenet's Decline – Columns by PC Magazine |publisher=Pcmag.com |date=January 1, 1970 |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |first=Sascha |last=Segan |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120909/http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2326849,00.asp |archivedate=2012-09-09 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; An archive simplifies ways to profile people. This has partly been countered with the introduction of the '' [[X-No-Archive|X-No-Archive: Yes]]'' header, which is itself controversial.&lt;ref&gt;Strawbridge, Matthew (2006).

===Archives by Google Groups and DejaNews===
{{Main|Google Groups}}

Web-based archiving of Usenet posts began in 1995 at [[Deja News]] with a very large, searchable database. In 2001, this database was acquired by [[Google]].&lt;ref&gt;Cullen, Drew (February 12, 2001). {{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/02/12/google_saves_deja_com_usenet/ |title=Google saves Deja.com Usenet service |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120921/https://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/02/12/google_saves_deja_com_usenet/ |archivedate=2012-09-21 |deadurl=no}}. ''[[The Register]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Google Groups hosts an archive of Usenet posts dating back to May 1981. The earliest posts, which date from May 1981 to June 1991, were donated to Google by the [[University of Western Ontario]] with the help of [[David Wiseman]] and others,&lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, David. [http://www.csd.uwo.ca/~magi/personal/usenet.html "Magi's NetNews Archive Involvement"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20050209012732/http://www.csd.uwo.ca/~magi/personal/usenet.html |date=February 9, 2005 }}, csd.uwo.ca.&lt;/ref&gt; and were originally archived by [[Henry Spencer]] at the University of Toronto's Zoology department.&lt;ref&gt;Mieszkowski, Katharine.

Google began archiving Usenet posts for itself starting in the second week of August 2000.

Google has been criticized by ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' and [[Wired (magazine)|''Wired'']] contributors as well as former employees for its stewardship of the archive and for breaking its search functionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.wired.com/2009/10/usenet|title = Google’s Abandoned Library of 700 Million Titles|website = Wired|last = Poulsen|first = Kevin|access-date = March 12, 2017|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170309162758/https://www.wired.com/2009/10/usenet/|archive-date = March 9, 2017|dead-url = no|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://motherboard.vice.com/read/google-a-search-company-has-made-its-internet-archive-impossible-to-search|title = Google, a Search Company, Has Made Its Internet Archive Impossible to Search|website = Motherboard|last = Braga|first = Matthew|access-date = August 30, 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150905023932/http://motherboard.vice.com/read/google-a-search-company-has-made-its-internet-archive-impossible-to-search|archive-date = September 5, 2015|dead-url = no|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = I'm Feeling Lucky: The Confessions of Google Employee Number 59|last = Edwards|first = Douglas|publisher = Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-547-41699-1|pages = 209–213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''École des technologies numériques appliquées''' ('''ETNA''') is a [[France|French]] private school in [[computer science]] localized at [[Ivry-sur-Seine]]. Created in 2005 by Patrice Dumoucel, the school since 2006 is part of [[IONIS Education Group]]. The certification delivered by the school are recognized by the [[France|French state]]&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}}[http://textes.droit.org/JORF/2010/07/22/0167/0008 Arrêté du 12 juillet 2010 portant enregistrement au répertoire national des certifications professionnelles]&lt;/ref&gt;{{,}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}}[http://textes.droit.org/JORF/2010/07/22/0167/ Journal officiel de la République Française du 22 juillet 2010, édition n°167]&lt;/ref&gt;

The school is from the same group as [[École Pour l'Informatique et les Techniques Avancées|EPITA]] and [[École pour l'informatique et les nouvelles technologies|EPITECH]]. The partnership ETNA/EPITA/EPITECH allows students to use the equipment to the two other universities. ETNA graduates can proceed to others courses at the [[IONIS School of Technology and Management]]&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}}[http://www.ionis-stm.com/ IONIS School of Technology and Management]&lt;/ref&gt; or a [[Master's in business administration|MBA]] at the ''[[Institut supérieur de gestion]]''. Students of ETNA can prepare major certifications  ([[Microsoft]], [[Cisco Systems]], [[Oracle Database|Oracle]]).

== Curriculum ==

The course is a three-year [[dual education system]] and includes 200 hours of lessons and 400 hours of practical cases study per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}}[http://www.capcampus.com/mba-458/etna-ecole-des-technologies-numeriques-appliquees-o20371.htm ETNA, Ecole des technologies numériques appliquées]&lt;/ref&gt;
Two specializations are available : [[software development]] or system and [[computer network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}}[http://www.jobingenieur.com/ETNA ETNA ECOLE DES TECHNOLOGIES NUMÉRIQUES APPLIQUÉES]&lt;/ref&gt;

Students choose one of these two in the second year.

The main lessons of the first year of study offers the following subjects:  [[management]], [[database]], [[IPv4]] network, web technologies, system administration, PHP / [[World Wide Web|web]], culture [[computer]], English, [[mathematics]] and method.
The second year can address the following topics: project, business valuation, English, [[mathematics]], drafting and document analysis, and [[marketing]] / business / management.
During the last year, the curriculum includes the subjects: project, English, [[mathematics]], drafting and document analysis, [[marketing]] / business / management and [[psychology]] work.

Since September 2013, the school will start a new program in 2 years after French ''[[Baccalauréat]]'' which will be entirely free. 250 tickets are available. The innovation is that there are graduate students who will pay for the students in training (250 euros per month during three years).&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}}[http://www.meltycampus.fr/ionis-group-evoque-son-avenir-a158109.html Ionis Education Group évoque son avenir]&lt;/ref&gt;
