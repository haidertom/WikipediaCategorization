The [[Little Red Riding Hood]] [[fairy tale]] has often been '''adapted''', and into a wide variety of media.

==Comics==
[[File:zenescope1.jpg|thumb|Little Red Riding Hood in one of a number of comic book adaptations. Art by [[Al Rio]], published by Zenescope.]]
*In the Tales of [[Asgard]] section of [[Marvel Comics]]' series ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #114 (1965 March), a story which at the end claims to be the basis of Little Red Riding Hood appears. The goddess [[Iðunn|Iduna]] walks the forests of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] carrying a bundle of golden apples. These "Golden Apples of Immortality" are for All-Father [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]], and Iduna brings them to him every year. Along her journey she meets Haakun the Hunter. Haakun greets her warmly and tells her to go in peace. As Iðunn continues further down the path, wearing her crimson cloak and hood, [[Fenris Wolf (Marvel Comics)|Fenris]] the Wolf-God sees her and transforms himself. Iduna next comes upon "a frail stranger". The stranger offers Iduna protection along her journey, but she declines the offer. The stranger takes a strong interest in Iduna's basket and begins asking her questions. She quickly grows suspicious, saying his hands seem so grasping -so brutal, and he has an odd voice, like the guttural snarl of a wild beast. She finds his manner sinister-frightening, and says his eyes burn with hatred-with pure savagery. She then discovers that the stranger is actually Fenris the Wolf God in disguise. Fenris shape shifts into his true form and attacks her. Haakun the Hunter arrives and drives Fenris away with his enchanted battle ax, causing the Wolf to shrink in an attempt to escape. The ax pursues Fenris and finally strikes him, spiriting him off to the shadowy land of Varinheim.
* [[Neil Gaiman]] worked a darker, more erotic, pre-Perrault version of the Red Riding Hood tale in ''[[The Sandman: The Doll's House|The Doll's House]]'' arc of ''[[The Sandman (DC Comics Modern Age)|The Sandman]]'' comics (1995). In this version, the wolf kills the old lady, tricks the girl into eating her grandmother's meat and drinking her blood, orders the girl to undress and lie in bed with him, and finally devours her. According to Gaiman, his portrayal of the tale was based on the one reported in Robert Darnton's book ''The Great Cat Massacre: And Other Episodes in French Cultural History''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neilgaiman.com/journal/archive/2001_11_01_archive.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060320210843/http://www.neilgaiman.com/journal/archive/2001_11_01_archive.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=March 20, 2006|website=NeilGaiman.com|title=Archive|date=November 1, 2001|author=Gaiman, Neil}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Both the Big Bad Wolf and Little Red Riding Hood are characters in the ''[[Fables (comic)|Fables]]'' [[comic book]] universe (2002–present). The Big Bad Wolf has taken on human form and become known as [[Bigby Wolf]]. He is the sheriff of [[Fabletown]] when the series begins. The figure of Red Riding Hood ("Ride") appears three times. The first two instances are actually spies working for the Fables' enemy The Adversary, magically disguising themselves as Little Red Riding Hood (the second of which is actually the witch [[Baba Yaga]]). The third Red Riding Hood seems to be the genuine article.
* In [[Kaori Yuki]]'s manga ''[[Ludwig Kakumei]]''  (2004-2007), Red Riding Hood is an infamous assassin whose first victims are her parents, after she is tricked by the Prince.
* The character "Red", in the [[webcomic]] ''[[No Rest for the Wicked (webcomic)|No Rest for the Wicked]]'' (2004–present), lives alone in the woods and always carries an axe with her. After being attacked by a wolf (which she has presumably killed and eaten), she has  systematically killed many other wolves in the forest.
* [[Benkyo Tamaoki]] created a twisted and dark version of Red Riding Hood in the manga ''[[Tokyo Red Hood]]'' (2003-2004). It is about a demonic girl dressed as Red Riding Hood who wanted to be devoured by a creature only known as ''Mr. Wolf''.
* [[Palmeros]]' one-shot manga, ''[[Little Red Riding Hood and the Kind Wolf]]'', is a dialogue-less tragedy based on the story of Little Red Riding Hood, portraying the title character as a young girl who befriends a wolf, only for a grim series of events to unfold when she is revealed to have been abused.
* A comic created by Hector Sevilla and Mike S. Miller called ''Lullaby'' features a Red Riding Hood character who is half girl and half wolf (because she got bitten by The Big Bad Wolf). The art can be viewed at [[DeviantArt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Deviant Art|url=http://www.elsevilla.deviantart.com/ |title=elsevilla.deviantart.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An adaptation of Little Red Riding Hood in Zenescope's [[Grimm Fairy Tales (comic series)|''Grimm Fairy Tales'' comic series]] depicts Red Riding Hood as a teenage girl nicknamed Red who is going off to bring food to her sick grandmother, who lives deep in the woods. Red gets attacked by a werewolf that kills her grandmother and attacks Red. Red is saved by the woodsman, named Samson, and the wolf turns out be a former lover. This story was a teenager's dream sequence after she gets into a fight with her boyfriend, who wanted to have sex with her.
* The [[manga]] ''[[One Piece]]'' references Red Riding Hood in chapter 413: "The Hunter". One of the protagonists, [[Usopp|Sogeking]], wears a red cloak and is almost killed by a "wolfman", Jyabura. He is saved by Sanji, "the hunter". Later on, Jyabura, attempting to bluff his way out of a fight, depicts [[Nico Robin]] (in a red hood) as his sister.
* Streetfables published a modern, urban adaptation of Little Red Riding Hood called ''Red''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.streetfables.com:80/red/ |website=Streetfables |title=Red |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313132656/http://www.streetfables.com/red/ |archivedate=2007-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Issue #1 of the [[Marvel Comics]] series ''[[Marvel Fairy Tales#Spider-Man Fairy Tales|Spider-Man Fairy Tales]]'' (2007) is an adaptation of Little Red Riding Hood, with [[Mary Jane Watson]] as the protagonist.
* In Shaun Healey's [[webcomic]] ''EverAfter'', Little Red Riding Hood is depicted as having gone insane inside the Big Bad Wolf's belly, and emerged a violent [[sociopath]] who chopped up the woodsman with his own saw, and needed to be placed in the EverAfter Maximum Security Asylum, along with other twisted fairy tale characters ranging from [[Tom Thumb]] to [[Goldilocks]], [[Hansel and Gretel]], [[Miss Muffet]], etc., all under the care of President [[Humpty Dumpty]] and Dr. Crooked (from a nursery rhyme).
* [[Serena Valentino]] and [[Foo Swee Chin]] wrote and illustrated an adaptation of Red Riding Hood in ''[[Nightmares &amp; Fairy Tales]]'' #8, wherein Red is known as Luna. This comic version focuses on Luna's struggle to cope with her fellow villagers' intense disdain for wolves. When a supposedly "dead" wolf kills her father, Luna sympathizes with the animal more than her parent, causing her mother to throw her out of the house in a fit of rage. Luna befriends a kind young man on the way to her grandmother's house and eventually discovers that her grandmother is a werewolf. When Luna's mother arrives and kills Luna's wolf-grandmother, Luna begins to change into a white wolf but is spared a gruesome death when her friend, in wolf-form, rescues her.
* The origin of [[Batman]]'s famous foe, the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]], is often shown to involve him dressing up as a character the Red Hood, which criminals hoped to use to make him seem like the mastermind of a robbery.

==Film==
* In the early 1960s, María Gracia starred as Little Red Riding Hood in a trilogy of [[Mexico|Mexican]] films by director Roberto Rodriguez, which were then re-dubbed in English and released in the [[United States]] courtesy of [[K. Gordon Murray]]: the so-called "King of the Kiddie Matinee". These films were: [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053693/ ''La Caperucita roja''] (''Little Red Riding Hood'', [[1960 in film|1960]]), [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055825/ ''Caperucita y sus tres amigos''] (''Little Red Riding Hood and Her Friends''/''Little Red Riding Hood and Her Three Friends '', [[1961 in film|1961]]) and ''[[Tom Thumb and Little Red Riding Hood|Caperucita y Pulgarcito contra los monstruos]]'' (''Little Red Riding Hood and the Monsters'', [[1962 in film|1962]]). The latter of these films also starred Cesáreo Quezadas, who reprised his recurring role of ''Pulgarcito'' ([[Tom Thumb]]).
* In a 1960 [[Popeye]] film called ''Little Olive Riding Hood'', [[Olive Oyl|Olive]] is using a red hood and delivering hamburgers to her sick friend, [[Wimpy (Popeye)|Wimpy]]. The [[Sea Hag]] wants those hamburgers for herself.
* [[Liza Minnelli]] starred in the television film ''The Dangerous Christmas of Red Riding Hood'' (1965), with [[Cyril Ritchard]] as the Wolf and [[Vic Damone]] as the huntsman. This [[Fictional revisionism|revisionist fairy tale]] is told from the Wolf's point of view.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0281766|The Dangerous Christmas of Red Riding Hood (1965 TV movie)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Soviet film studio [[Belarusfilm]] (1977) made the film ''[[Pro Krasnuyu Shapochku]]'' (''About Red Hat'' ({{lang-ru|Про Красную Шапочку}}) ([[:ru:Про Красную Шапочку (фильм)|in Russian]]).
* Artist [[Red Grooms]] made a 16-minute farcical film version in 1978 starring his daughter Saskia. In 2014 it was combined with a 1984 immersive sculptural work, ''The Alley'', into an exhibition titled ''Beware a Wolf in the Alley''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/28/arts/design/red-grooms-beware-a-wolf-in-the-alley.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://marlboroughchelsea.com/broome-st/exhibitions/red-grooms-beware-a-wolf-in-the-alley&lt;/ref&gt;
* Filmmaker [[Neil Jordan|Neil Jordan's]] [[horror film|horror]]/[[fantasy film]] ''[[The Company of Wolves]]'' ([[1984 in film|1984]]), based on the eponymous short story by [[Angela Carter]], told an interweaving series of folkloric tales loosely based on Red Riding Hood that fully exploited its subtexts of [[lycanthropy]], violence and sexual awakening.
* In the [[Cinema of Japan|Japanese]] live-action film ''[[The Red Spectacles]]'' (1987; aka ''Akai Megane''), the featured "young lady" (as mentioned in the French and German versions of the tale), an allegory for Fate, is dressed like the Little Red Riding Hood. An anime version of this character appeared later in the film's sequel, ''Jin-Roh''.
* ''[[Red Riding Hood (1989 film)|Red Riding Hood]]'' (1989), starring [[Isabella Rossellini]] and [[Craig T. Nelson]], is an American/Israeli musical film directed by [[Adam Brooks (filmmaker)|Adam Brooks]].
* [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]'s television film adaption, ''The Trial of Red Riding Hood'' (1992), starring figure skater [[Elizabeth Manley]], premiered on the [[Disney Channel]] in 1994.
* ''[[Freeway (1996 film)|Freeway]]'' ([[1996 in film|1996]]), starring [[Kiefer Sutherland]] and [[Reese Witherspoon]], adapts the story&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110629104317/http://www.salon.com/nov96/freeway961111.html Salon review of film]&lt;/ref&gt; into a modern setting in which the major characters become a psychotic but charming serial killer (named Bob Wolverton) and a sexually abused teenage girl.
* [[Christina Ricci]] starred in ''[[Little Red Riding Hood (1997 film)|Little Red Riding Hood]]'' ([[1997 in film|1997]]), a [[short film]] based on the subject matter.
* The [[Belgium|Belgian]] short film ''[[Black XXX-Mas]]'' ([[1999 in film|1999]]) translates the story to a nightmarish, futuristic urban setting. "The Forest" is the nickname for the jungle-like city, and "Wolfy" is a crooked police officer who hounds this film's Little Red.
* The Kenneth Liu short film [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317473/ ''Falsehood'' ([[2001 in film|2001]])] refigures the Little Red Riding Hood story as a legal drama, with the [[Big Bad Wolf]] on trial and [[Little Bo Peep]] as his attorney. Scenes between Peep and the Wolf pay homage to the [[Clarice Starling]]/[[Hannibal Lecter]] scenes in ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' (1991).
* The [[horror film]] ''[[Red Riding Hood (2003 film)|Red Riding Hood]]'' ([[2003 in film|2003]]), directed by [[Giacomo Cimini]], was a darker take on the classic story.
* [[Cinema of Singapore|Singapore]] cult director [[Tzang Merwyn Tong]] directed the 45-minute short film ''[[A Wicked Tale]]'' ([[2005 in film|2005]]).
* ''[[Hoodwinked]]'' (2005) is an American [[computer-animated]] [[Family film|family]] [[comedy film]] that retells the folktale ''[[Little Red Riding Hood]]'' as a police investigation, using flashbacks to show multiple characters' points of view.
* The film ''[[Hard Candy (film)|Hard Candy]]'' (2005), in which a young girl ensnares and tortures a suspected paedophile, was not originally intended to be a ''Red Riding Hood'' homage; however, the film's star, [[Ellen Page]], incidentally chose a red [[hoodie]] to wear in the final scenes, giving them an unintended metaphoric subtext that was later exploited in advertising for the film.&lt;ref&gt;''The Making of Hard Candy'', Hard Candy DVD&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;!--Can people please refrain from writing about this particular film in a way akin to advertising it. This is meant to be a brief synopsis that leads into the main article--&gt;''[[Red Riding Hood (2006 film)|Red Riding Hood]]'' ([[2006 in film|2006]]) is a [[musical film]] adaptation directed by [[Randal Kleiser]] and test-released in late 2004. The [[experimental film|experimental]] virtual reality features were then enhanced for over an additional year. The film stars [[Morgan Thompson]] as "Red"; also among the actors are [[Henry Cavill]], [[Ashley Rose Orr]], [[Andrea Bowen]], and music opera entertainers well known on Broadway: [[Lainie Kazan]], [[Debi Mazar]], and [[Joey Fatone]].
* The [[short film]] ''Big Bad Wolves'' (2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0874259|Big Bad Wolves (2006 short)}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Rajneel Singh takes a [[black comedy|black-comedy]]-meets-[[fantasy]] approach by having the story told from the point of view of [[Quentin Tarantino|Tarantino-style]] [[gangsters]] who try to convince each other that it is actually a [[fable]] about [[Human female sexuality|female sexuality]]. This version features a more classic, [[fairy tale]] approach to the narrative and visuals, but also utilizes a [[werewolf]] as a literal [[sexual predator]].
*The [[horror anthology]] film ''[[Trick r Treat]]'' (2007) contains one story thread inspired by the tale. A girl, played by [[Anna Paquin]], dresses up as Little Red Riding Hood for a Halloween party, but is waylaid by a serial killer in the woods. However, the story twists when she reveals herself to be a werewolf seeking her "first time".
*The 2007 family film [[Enchanted (2007 film)|Enchanted]] depicts Red Riding Hood as the villain of the story who 'tells it a little bit differently' when relating the events of the fairy tale. Princess Giselle claims that her chipmunk sidekick stopped Red from hacking the innocent wolf to death with an axe.
* Writer/director [[Joseph Bat]] is working on ''A Take of Little Red Riding Hood'' (which was expected to be released in 2009), that will feature a darker re-imagining of the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/13411 |title=BD Horror News - New 'Little Red Riding Hood' Tale |publisher=Bloody-disgusting.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collections===

Many of the short stories and poems (as well as many older texts) are collected in ''The Trials and Tribulations of Little Red Riding Hood'' by [[Jack Zipes]].

===Novels===
* ''[[Wolf (book)|Wolf]]'' by [[Gillian Cross]] ([[1990 in literature|1990]]), winner of the 1991 Carnegie Medal. This is a very loose adaptation of the tale set in the modern day.
* ''Caperucita en Manhattan'' by Carmen Martín Gaite ([[1990 in literature|1990]]).
* ''[[Witches Abroad]]'' by [[Terry Pratchett]] ([[1991 in literature|1991]]) parodies a number of fairy tales, including Little Red Riding Hood. In this version [[Granny Weatherwax]] and [[Nanny Ogg]] stop the wolf before it has a chance to eat the grandmother (much to its own relief, as it's acting against its will). Nanny Ogg remembers hearing about the same thing happening a couple of villages away, when she was a girl. She also refers obliquely to an incident when ''she'' visited her grandmother in a red hood, involving "Sumpkins the lodger".
* ''Little Red Riding Hood in the Red Light District'' by Manlio Argueta ([[1998 in literature|1998]]).
* ''Darkest Desire: The Wolf's Own Tale'' by Anthony Schmitz ([[1998 in literature|1998]]).

* ''Little Red Riding Wolf (Seriously Silly Stories)'' ([[2004 in literature|2004]]), a children's novel by Laurence Anholt and Arthur Robins, in which the roles of the main characters are reversed, so that the 'Big Bad Girl' terrorises the innocent hero, Little Red Riding Wolf, before meeting her come-uppance from the terrifying Old Granny Wolf.
* ''[[The Book of Lost Things]]'' by [[John Connolly (author)|John Connolly]] ([[2006 in literature|2006]]).

* ''Red Rider's Hood'' (2006) by [[Neal Shusterman]].
* ''Sisters Red'' (2010) by [[Jackson Pearce]].
* ''Red Hood's Revenge'' (2010) by [[Jim C. Hines]] The third book in Hines' Princess series- starring Danielle Whiteshore ([[Cinderella]]), Talia Malak-el-Dahshat ([[Sleeping Beauty]]), and [[Snow White]] as a trio of 'secret agents' for Danielle's mother-in-law-, Roudette has become an assassin known as the Lady of the Red Hood, after her family were killed by the Wild Hunt, a group of monstrous spirits who kill anyone in their path; the wolf in her story was actually her grandmother wearing an enchanted wolf-skin when she was killed by the Hunt for her long vendetta against them. After her grandmother's death, Roudette took the skin and combined it with her pre-existing red cloak; initially enchanted to block magic, Roudette had the runes changed so that they deflect fairy magic, the combination of the two cloaks making Roudette immune to magic cast on her directly and able to transform into a wolf. She is killed at the conclusion of the novel after defeating the Wild Hunt, with her cloak being subsequently claimed by her former rival Talia (AKA [[Sleeping Beauty]]).
* ''Dust City'' (2010) by [[Robert Paul Weston]]. Deals more with the wolf.
* ''Glasgow Fairytale''(2010) by Alastair D McIver is based on intertwined versions of traditional fairy tales set in and around modern day Glasgow, including the story of Wee Red Hoodie and the Big Bad Wolf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Book Review: Glasgow Fairytale|url=http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/culture/books/book-review-glasgow-fairytale-1-826983|accessdate=28 September 2017|work=The Scotsman|date=30 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Red Riding Hood'' (2011) by [[Sarah Blakley-Cartwright]]
* ''The Red Hood, Black Hood Trilogy" (2012) by [[Kenneth W. Hether]] A previously published serial novel that retold the events of Little Red Riding Hood in a futuristic urban setting. As of December 2017 the original serial consisting of three novellas has been the only completed collection in a planned six announced on the author's Facebook upon publishing the first trilogy. The series has since been cancelled in an open letter to fans promising that one day the stories would return as a "retooled and, frankly more robust" version of itself. 
* ''[[Scarlet (novel)|Scarlet]]'' (2013) by [[Marissa Meyer]]. The second book in ''[[The Lunar Chronicles]]'', a series of interconnected fairy-tale retellings in a gritty futuristic setting.

* Early [[Bugs Bunny]] cartoons, such as ''[[Little Red Riding Rabbit]]'' (1944), utilize characters from fairy tales such as Little Red Riding Hood. In one cartoon comic version, ''[[Red Riding Hoodwinked]]'' (1955), Little Red Riding Hood is accompanied by [[Tweety Bird]] while the villains are played by a Wolf and [[Sylvester (Looney Tunes)|Sylvester]], who almost come to blows over who is going to play "Grandma".

* The Japanese animated film ''[[Jin-Roh]]'' (1999; also known as ''Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade''), about a secret society within an anti-terrorist unit of an [[alternate history|alternative]] post-World War II Japan, makes several literary and visual references to the German oral version of the story (most notably a ''Rotkäppchen'' book offered to the main character by one of the female bomb couriers), which is closer to the Perrault version, than the tale of Grimm, with an anti-terrorist commando as the wolf (the title is literally "Man-wolf" in Japanese"), and a former terrorist courier as the young lady.
* The main character of the anime ''[[Otogi Jushi Akazukin]]'' has as is a girl named Akazukin, who is a Fairy Musketeer and has to protect a boy named Souta, who's the Elde Key, from the world of Science.

* The computer-animated children's [[film]], ''[[Hoodwinked!]]'' (2005), uses the anachronistic parody approach to the tale typified by the ''[[Shrek]]'' films, envisioning the story as a ''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]''-like mystery in which the [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphised]] animal police of the forest question the four participants of the story after they are detained for an apparent domestic disturbance that the police suspect is tied to the mysterious "Goodie Bandit", a thief who has been stealing sweet shop store owners' books. One by one, each character is interviewed and explains to the police their story of how they got to Granny's house and why, and each story is followed in a lengthy flashback. All four characters are discovered to not quite be what they initially appear to be, and all of their stories have overlap with each other:
**Red Puckett is a worldly wise delivery girl, who gets her name from the red hooded cloak she wears. She is determined to protect her Granny's recipe book after someone breaks into Granny's store.
**Granny Puckett secretly lives a double life as an extreme sports athlete named "Triple G". She participates in a ski race and is nearly killed by the Bandit's henchmen. After incapacitating them by staging an avalanche, she ends up bound and gagged in her own closet when the parachute and ripcord she uses to escape get caught in her ceiling fan after she comes down the chimney.
**The Wolf (full name Wolf W. Wolf) is an investigative journalist. He and his assistant, a hyperactive squirrel named Twitchy, think that Red is somehow involved in the Goodie Bandit thefts.
**Kirk Kirkkendall, the woodsman, is not a lumberjack, but an out-of-work actor who spends his days selling schnitzel out of a truck and has just been auditioned for a foot ointment commercial. After someone raids and cannibalizes his truck, he starts cutting down trees with an axe to [[method acting|try to get into the shoes of a woodsman]]. He is accidentally thrown through Granny's cottage window after trying to cut down a very large tree.
* In the film ''[[Shrek the Third]]'' (2007), Little Red Riding Hood is portrayed as one of the villains; she is seen pick pocketing in one scene during Prince Charming's pillage. The [[Big Bad Wolf]] is considered one of the good guys.
* "Red Riding Hood" is a character in ''[[Super Why!]]'' (2007), in which she calls herself "Wonder Red," wears roller blades, and has "Word Power".
* The anime ''[[Ōkami-san (light novels)#Anime|Okami-san and her Seven Companions]]'' (2010) is based around the characters Ryōko Ōkami (Ōkami meaning wolf), Ryōshi Morino (his name also meaning "The Forest's Hunter" in Japanese) and Ringo Akai (representing Little Red Riding Hood) and the rest of the "trading" club named the "Otogi High School Bank" as they fix students problems, whatever they may be, in exchange for the students helping them out later. Almost all of the characters in the anime are based on characters from Little Red Riding Hood or other fairytales. The ending theme song, "Akazukin-chan Goyoujin" (''Little Red Riding Hood, Be Careful'') by OToGi, makes many references to Little Red Riding Hood and its characters as well.

Hood]] (an acronym for "Baby Bonnie Hood", Japanese name "Bulleta"), who is inspired by the protagonist in the Little Red Riding Hood fables. "Hood" as-it-were is something of a loose interpretation of the character; in that her persona is far more eccentric, volatile, and outlandish then what is typically depicted in the classic tale. This particular character has been seen in subsequent Capcom video game releases including: the ''[[Darkstalkers]]'' video game series (in which she first appeared), and the second installment of the fan-favorite video game ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom]]''.

* [[Adventure Quest Worlds]] has a brunette variation of Red Riding Hood, called Red Hunting Hood here. She is a skilled hunter who wants the players' help to hunt down several monsters.
* ''[[Fairytale Fights]]'' has Lil' Red as a playable character.

After he was killed in a wolf attack Isabella established the "Order of Red Riding Hood Sisters" in the Vosges Mountains, Eastern France.
*[[The Wolf Among Us]], a video game adaptation was made from the comic [[Fables (comics)|Fables]] where you play as the Big Bad Wolf, Bigby Wolf. The character Red is only mentioned briefly, mentioning that she didn't survive after the fables escaped their homelands. Later, the Fables series was amended by a comic book adaptation of the game.
*[[Woolfe: The Red Hood Diaries]] is a side-scrolling platform hack and slash video game developed and published by Belgian independent development studio GriN Gamestudio.

'''Ashton Lane''' is a cobbled backstreet in the [[Glasgow#The West End|West End]] of [[Glasgow]]. It is connected to [[Byres Road]] by a short linking lane beside [[Hillhead subway station]] and is noted for its bars, restaurants and a licensed cinema.
[[File:Glasgow westend (31).JPG|thumb|right|240px|Off the main thoroughfare of [[Byres Road]], Ashton Lane is a focus for bars, cafes and restaurants.]]

==Overview==
The Lane was not always the focus of West End cafe society. By the early 1970s, it was a run-down area of small residential and empty commercial properties. However, in 1976, the cost to renew the lease on the cramped property in Ruthven Lane that housed the Ubiquitous Chip restaurant&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/may/16/ubiquitous-chip-glasgow-restaurant-review|title=The Ubiquitous Chip, Glasgow – restaurant review {{!}} Marina O'Loughlin|last=O'Loughlin|first=Marina|date=2014-05-16|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; forced the owner to look for new premises. 'The Chip', as it is locally known, moved to its current location in a derelict property that had been the stables for a funeral undertaker. The move was a gamble for the owner, Ronnie Clydesdale, since the Lane was a backwater to the thriving [[Byres Road|Byres Rd]] but in 1977 the [[Glasgow Underground|Glasgow Subway]] closed for a major refurbishment. This forced several small businesses to relocate from [[Byres Road|Byres Rd]] and the then-famous Grosvenor Cafe followed The Chip into Ashton Lane.

[[File:AshtonLaneGlasgow.JPG|thumb|right|240px|Ashton Lane, looking from Great George Street.]]

Other bars and restaurants were opened: the Cul-de-Sac creperie in the former [[Barr and Stroud]] factory and Bar Brel in the old coachhouse that had been used latterly as a landscape gardener's yard but was, in 1910, the chauffeur’s house and garage for Dr Marion Gilchrist’s 'prim dark green Wolseley landaulette'. Dr Gilchrist (1864-1952) was, in 1894, the first woman to graduate in medicine in Scotland.

The Grosvenor Picture Theatre was built on site of Henderson’s Cab and Funeral Office in Byres Road and Ashton Lane. The cinema opened on 3 May 1921 with 'Helen of the Four Gates' and 'Eastwards Ho' and the performances were accompanied by the theatre’s own orchestra and organist. The building was designed by architects Gardner &amp; Glen and had a distinctive terracotta façade. The original entrance faced Byres Road and the upper level housed a Café and American Soda Fountain and, by 1929, a waiting room. The original cinema seated around 1,350 people, but in the 1970s it underwent considerable reconstruction. The entrance was moved from Byres Rd to Ashton Lane, and the old entrance became Bonham's Wine Bar (the railing in the original foyer is retained in the upstairs bar). After falling into disrepair, the cinema closed 30 June 2002, but was relaunched in October 2003 after a multimillion-pound refurbishment. This created two screens on the ground floor, a bar and restaurant in the former neglected roof space and a new cafe/bar on Ashton Lane. The cinema now has two screens, each seating a hundred people and shows a mix of blockbuster and art-house movies. 

Today, bars and restaurants occupy most of the premises in Ashton Lane. The Famous Grosvenor Cafe and the now internationally renowned 'Chip' remain a defining feature. Some like Jinty McGuintys Irish Bar have been there a while too, almost 25 years.

Ashton Lane continues north as Cresswell Lane, where the variety of bars and restaurants is supplemented by a gallery of small specialist shops. The Lane and its surroundings might then be regarded as Glasgow's equivalent of [[Dublin]]'s [[Temple Bar, Dublin|Temple Bar]] area or [[Edinburgh]]'s [[Rose Street]]. While still popular with local residents and students, it is now firmly established on the Glasgow tourist trail.

'''Bill Henson''' (born 7 October 1955)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/col/artist/2363 NGV]. Retrieved 8 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Australian]] contemporary art photographer.

==Art==
Henson has exhibited nationally and internationally in galleries such as the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] in New York, the [[Venice Biennale]], the [[National Gallery of Victoria]] in Melbourne, Australia, the [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]] in Sydney, Australia and the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]] in Paris. His current practice involves holding one exhibition in Australia every two years, and up to three overseas exhibitions each year.

The use of [[chiaroscuro]]&lt;ref&gt;"What becomes apparent when you see Henson’s work in person is the importance of the almost pitch-black darkness that, in whatever formal context he has devised over the years, always cloaks his forlorn, defiantly unneedy subjects, giving their run-down urban environments the look of remote desert outposts. It’s a black that seems both to be caked on the surface of the photographs, like tar or centuries of soot, and to recede infinitely into the background. It looks as solid as lead, a physical threat to the teens it blankets, and at the same time it’s as if the blackness were exuded by their bodies, forming a kind of paranormal manifestation of some feeling too intense and guarded to register in any other fashion. In its own peculiar way Henson’s black is as unique an achievement as, say, Robert Ryman’s white." Dennis Cooper (2002) The Photography of Bill Henson: Naked Youth, ''Artforum International'', No. 6, p.94-97&lt;/ref&gt; is common throughout his works, through underexposure and adjustment in printing. His photographs' use of [[bokeh]] is intended to give them a [[painterly]] atmosphere. The work is often presented as [[diptych]]s, [[triptych]]s and in other groupings, and the exhibitions are specifically curated by Henson to reflect a sense of musicality.&lt;ref&gt;"As the new Biss recording of Mozart's K364 ''Sinfonia Concertante'', the ''Andante'' movement only, repeats itself endlessly on my stereo, the sound of Richard Tognetti and the ACO orchestra at their absolute greatest washes over me like a tsunami, while my head is also spinning with the staggering beauty of a single gesture made by a woman riding the escalator at the Westfield Doncaster shopping centre, and with just how Tognetti's violin sounds like she looked. Well, there you have it. I call it millennial slippage. You might call it madness..." Henson in interview with Amanda Smith, Artworks Broadcast:Sunday 15 August 2010 11:05AM, Australian Broadcasting Commission transcript, http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/artworks/artworks-feature-bill-henson/3020240 Downloaded 26 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Capon, E., Malouf, D. &amp; Annear, J., in ''Mnemosyne'', Art Gallery of New South Wales, Scalo, (2205) 8-9, 12, 35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see discussion of the ''Luminous'' concert (2005) performed by the Australian Chamber Orchestra to a screening of Henson imagery in Stevens, Meghan (2009).''Music and Image in Concert''. Australia: Music and Image in Concert&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smee, S., Touch of Innocence, Weekend Australian [newspaper]. 22–23 January 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Duality is a recurring theme of Henson's work, often in combination with adolescent subjects.&lt;ref&gt;"And this sexiness that is there and emphasised is crucial to the austere pessimism of these works. But to see it as the point of the photographs, arraigning Henson as a purveyor of kiddie porn to the elite, is, putting it charitably, to miss the point. It’s like reading him as a centrefold photographer for whom the background is just backdrop. Or thinking the clothed figure in Titian’s ''Allegory of Vice and Virtue'' represents the good girl. What Henson is actually giving us is a series of shattered paysages moralisés, where the innocent sexiness of the bodies is posed against a landscape they are not part of — the majestic, insensible alps (alps that bring to mind the poignancy, which had never struckeme before of Robbe-Grillet’s statement about how Mt Blanc had not been waiting since the Permian Age to be a symbol for Shelley). Henson’s alps appear like a scroll rolled back, to reveal a ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|deus sive natura]]'' it is sentimental to even describe as pitiless. These alps tower over the figures but the environment they are posed in seems just as alien. There is no back to nature primitivism about these figures. They are bruised and wounded and helpless — the flowers about to be consumed in the furnace." John Forbes (1993) 'Bill Henson'.

His works are often in the form of staged tableaux&lt;ref&gt;DARIA, Ioan (2009) The Photographic Treatment of Emotion in Front of a Stage. Bill Henson: The Opera Project.

Burke, Janine and Henson, Bill. Art for the End of the World. ''Meanjin'', Vol. 40, No. 3, Oct 1981: 375-388.&lt;/ref&gt;

Henson states that he is not interested in a political or sociological agenda.&lt;ref&gt;"I don’t use soap boxes. I don’t have much to say about whether or not people have lost the plot now. No." Henson, Bill &amp; Mirlesse, Sabine (2015) ''Dreamscapes and Sensory Experience: An Interview with Bill Henson By Sabine Mirlesse, June 15, 2015.''

==Life and influences==
Raised in the Eastern suburbs of Melbourne, Henson studied Visual Arts and Design 1974–1975 at [[Victoria College, Melbourne|Prahran College of Advanced Education]] where [[Athol Shmith]] was head of the Photography program and [[John Cato]] and [[Paul Cox (director)|Paul Cox]] were lecturers. He did not complete the diploma, but the nineteen-year-old Henson's work was promoted by Shmith to [[Jennie Boddington]],&lt;ref&gt;"It is remarkable that, so young, his armoury of technical skill is so narrowly focused and accurately directed to serve his needs. He does his own colour processing in his bedroom[...]. He has referred to a ‘certain morbidity’ in his work. Well, that is an element of life too. The young ballerinas seem to be under a spell, in thrall. At one and the same time he is tender artist and tyrant.  The delicacy and control of colour in these shades will excite wonderment and pleasure, where a hint of coral light imbues the lobe of an ear, or minuscule catchlight alights with barest touch on the tip of eyelashes or edges the profiled iris of her eye. At times he teases with only a suggestion of vaporous form, but the presence breathes within the frame. Do we not grieve for mortality when we perceive (for there is a tactile as well as a visual understanding here) the wisp of hair on the nape of her neck? There is something in the order of mystery. Enter the trance." Jennie Boddington (1975), ''Of Tender Years'' Published Photography Gallery room brochure, National Gallery of Victoria. Melbourne&lt;/ref&gt;   inaugural Curator of Photography at the [[National Gallery of Victoria]]&lt;ref&gt;Boddington, J., Henson, B., (July 1975) exhibition catalogue.

Art and Australia Vol.42, No.3, Autumn 2005, p. 396 – 405&lt;/ref&gt;

From his period as a student until its closure in 1980, he worked at The Bookshop of Margareta Webber&lt;ref&gt;Henson, Bill, (1980) ''The bookshop of Margareta Webber'' : 1 map ; 46 x 60 cm. (Not drawn to scale). State Library of Victoria collection. Melbourne: Webbers Booksellers http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/7648003&lt;/ref&gt; 343 Little Collins Street Melbourne, which specialised in luxurious books on ballet, dance and the visual arts. Leaving the bookshop, he traveled and photographed in Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;'The first city I wanted to see was Dresden.' Henson quoted by Smee, Sebastian. Bill Henson. ''Art and Australia'' Vol.42, No.3, Autumn 2005, p. 396 – 405&lt;/ref&gt; He taught briefly at the [[Victorian College of the Arts]] in Melbourne. Henson's long-term relationship with Luminist Melbourne painter [[Louise Hearman]], whom he met in 1981 at the Victorian College of Arts, has been noted&lt;ref&gt;Coslovich, Gabriella (2008) Seeing in the dark: Louise Hearman remains enthralled by the richness of oil paint.

But Hearman was coy on the subject. "Well, why don’t we just leave that open?" she said.  Capon is a long-term friend of Henson and Hearman, and curated Henson’s 2005 exhibition at the AGNSW.'

==Controversies==

===Images seized===
On 22 May 2008, the opening night of Bill Henson's 2007–2008 exhibition at the [[Roslyn Oxley9 Gallery]] in [[Paddington, New South Wales|Paddington]], Sydney, was canceled after eight individual complaints were made to Police voicing concerns about an email invitation from the Gallery to a "Private View" that depicted photographs of a nude 13-year-old girl. [[Hetty Johnston]], a [[child protection]] advocate also lodged a complaint with the New South Wales police.&lt;ref name="Tovey"&gt;{{cite news | last = Tovey | first = Josephine |author2=Kennedy, Les |author3=Welch, Dylan | date = 24 May 2008| title = Art obscenity charges | work = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/arts/henson-finds-support-over-photos/2008/05/23/1211183097197.html | accessdate = 2008-05-28 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080713043449/http://www.smh.com.au/news/arts/henson-finds-support-over-photos/2008/05/23/1211183097197.html| archivedate= 13 July 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gallery"&gt;{{cite news |title=Gallery: Nude children exhibit shut |work=[[News.com.au]] |url=http://www.news.com.au/gallery/0,22056,5031912-5010140,00.html |accessdate=2008-05-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080525213842/http://www.news.com.au/gallery/0%2C22056%2C5031912-5010140%2C00.html |archivedate=25 May 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
On the same day a ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' columnist, [[Miranda Devine]], had also written a scathing article in response to viewing the email invitation,&lt;ref name="Devine"&gt;{{cite news | last = Devine | first = Miranda | date = 22 May 2008 | title = Moral backlash over sexing up of our children | work = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | url = http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2008/05/21/1211182891875.html?page=3 | accessdate = 2008-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; which precipitated heated talk-back and media discussion throughout the day. In the process of removing the images from the Gallery, Police found more photographs of naked children on exhibition among various [[large format]] photographs of nonfigurative subjects, which they later sought to examine for the purposes of determining their legal status under the NSW Crimes Act and child protection legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aifs.gov.au/nch/resources/legislation/legislation.html |title=Australian child protection legislation- National Child Protection Clearinghouse |accessdate=2009-07-11 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711023525/http://www.aifs.gov.au/nch/resources/legislation/legislation.html |archivedate=11 July 2009 |df=dmy }}. aifs.gov.au&lt;/ref&gt; Following discussions with the Gallery and a decision by Henson, the Gallery canceled the opening and postponed the show.&lt;ref&gt;Roslyn Oxley Gallery, 'Media Statement', 23/5/08&lt;/ref&gt;

It was announced on 23 May that a number of the images in the exhibition had been seized by police local Area Commander Alan Sicard, with the intention of charging Bill Henson, the Gallery, or both with "publishing an indecent article" under the Crimes Act.&lt;ref name="Kennedy"&gt;{{cite news | last = Kennedy | first = Les | date = 23 May 2008| title = Henson show charges | work = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/arts/henson-show-charges/2008/05/23/1211183060208.html | accessdate = 2008-05-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The seized images were also removed from the Roslyn Oxley9 Gallery website, where the remainder of the series can now be viewed online.&lt;ref name="roslynoxley9"&gt;{{cite web | title = Bill Henson, 2008 | work = Roslyn Oxley9 Gallery | url = http://www.roslynoxley9.com.au/artists/18/Bill_Henson/1098/ | accessdate = 2008-05-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation provoked a national debate on censorship. In a televised interview, Prime Minister [[Kevin Rudd]] stated that he found the images "absolutely revolting"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2008/05/23/1211183044543.html Rudd revolted – Arts – Entertainment]. smh.com.au (2008-05-23).

On 5 June 2008 the former director of the National Gallery of Australia, Betty Churcher, said it was "not surprising" that the New South Wales Department of Public Prosecutions (DPP) would announce its official recommendation that no charges be laid regarding the Sydney Roslyn Oxley9 gallery's collection of photographs by artist Bill Henson.

'''''Black Square''''' (also known as '''''The Black Square''''' or '''''Malevich's Black Square''''') is an iconic painting by [[Kazimir Malevich]]. The first version was done in 1915. Malevich made four variants of which the last is thought to have been painted during the late 1920s or early 1930s. ''Black Square'' was first shown in [[0,10 Exhibition|The Last Futurist Exhibition 0,10]] in 1915. The work is frequently invoked by critics, historians, curators, and artists as the "zero point of painting", referring to the painting's historical significance and paraphrasing Malevich.

==History==
[[File:0.10 Exhibition.jpg|thumb|A section of Suprematist works by Malevich exhibited at the [[0,10 Exhibition]], Petrograd, 1915]]
Malevich painted his first ''Black Square'' in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/theme.php?theme_id=10202 John Milner, ''Suprematism'', MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; He made four variants of which the last is thought to have been painted during the late 1920s or early 1930s, despite the author's "1913" inscription on the reverse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/wps/portal/hermitage/what-s-on/temp_exh/1999_2013/hm4_1_30/?lng=en ''Kasimir Malevich.

It was first shown in [[0,10 Exhibition|The Last Futurist Exhibition 0,10]] in 1915.

Forensic detail reveals of how ''Black Square'' was painted over a more complex and colorful composition.&lt;ref name="THE MAKING OF BLACK SQUARE" /&gt;

==Historical context==
A plurality of art historians, curators, and critics refer to ''Black Square'' as one of the seminal works of [[modern art]], and of [[abstract art]] in the Western painterly tradition generally.

Malevich declared the square a work of [[Suprematism]], a movement which he proclaimed but which is associated almost exclusively with the work of Malevich and his apprentice [[Lissitzky]] today.  The movement did have a handful of supporters amongst the Russian avant garde but it was dwarfed by its sibling [[constructivism (art)|constructivism]] whose manifesto harmonized better with the ideological sentiments of the revolutionary communist government during the early days of Soviet Union. Suprematism may be understood as a transitional phase in the evolution of Russian art, bridging the evolutionary gap between [[futurism]] and [[constructivism (art)|constructivism]].{{cn|date=June 2018}}

The larger and more universal leap forward represented by the painting, however, is the break between representational painting and abstract painting—a complex transition with which ''Black Square'' has become identified and for which it has become one of the key shorthands, touchstones or symbols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Collings|first1=Matthew|title=The Rules of Abstraction|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04gv5kl|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perception==
The work is frequently invoked by critics, historians, curators, and artists as the "zero point of painting",&lt;ref name="ALMOST NOTHING"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mazzoni|first1=Ira|title=Everything and Nearly Nothing: Malevich and His Effects|url=http://db-artmag.com/archiv/07/e/thema-mazzoni.html|publisher=DeutscheBank/Art|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="THE PROPHET"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schjehldahl|first1=Peter|title=The Prophet: Malevich's Revolution|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2003/06/02/the-prophet-2|publisher=The New Yorker|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="THE SHAPE OF THINGS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schjehldahl|first1=Peter|title=The Shape of Things:After Kazimir Malevich |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/03/14/shapes-of-things|publisher=The New Yorker|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the painting's historical significance as a paraphrase of a number of comments Malevich made about ''The Black Square'' in letters to his colleagues and dealers.

Malevich had made some remarks about his painting.
* "It is from zero, in zero, that the true movement of being begins."&lt;ref name=GUGGENHEIM&gt;{{cite web|last1=Malevich|first1=K.|title=Kazimir Malevich: Suprematism|url=https://archive.org/details/kazimir00male|publisher=Guggenheim|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "I transformed myself in the zero of form and emerged from nothing to creation, that is, to [[Suprematism]], to the new realism in painting - to non-objective creation."&lt;ref name=GUGGENHEIM /&gt;
* "[Black Square is meant to evoke] the experience of pure non-objectivity in the white emptiness of a liberated nothing."&lt;ref name=GUGGENHEIM /&gt;
[[File:Casimir Malevich photo.jpg|thumb|175px|Photograph of Malevich]]

[[Peter Schjeldahl]] wrote:&lt;ref name="THE PROPHET" /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The brushwork is juicy and brusque: filling in the shapes, fussing with the edges. But the forms are weightless, more like thoughts than like images. You don’t look at the picture so much as launch yourself into its trackless empyrean. Beyond its obvious design flair, the work looks easy because it is. Malevich is monumental not for what he put into pictorial space but for what he took out: bodily experience, the fundamental theme of Western art since the Renaissance. His appeal to Americans isn’t surprising. Apart from a peculiarly Russian mystical tradition, which he exploited—evoking the compact spell of the icon, as a conduit of the divine—his work amounts to a cosmic “Song of the Open Road.” It conveys sheer, surging, untrammelled possibility. This quality seemed in synch with the Revolution of 1917. It wasn’t—which Malevich was painfully made aware of, first by his rivals in the Russian avant-garde and then, conclusively, by the regime of Joseph Stalin."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Conservation==
Negligence and contempt on the part of the Soviet government in whose keeping the original ''Black Square'' remained for decades has resulted in the painting degrading considerably.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Shaw. [https://www.tate.org.uk/art/research-publications/the-sublime/philip-shaw-kasimir-malevichs-black-square-r1141459 The Art of the Sublime – 'Kasimir Malevich’s Black Square']. Tate Research Publication, January 2013. Retrieved 06 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Schjeldahl writes:&lt;ref name="THE PROPHET" /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The painting looks terrible: crackled, scuffed, and discolored, as if it had spent the past eighty-eight years patching a broken window. In fact, it passed most of that time deep in the Soviet archives, classed among the lowliest of the state's treasures. Malevich, like other members of the Revolutionary-era Russian avant-garde, was thrown into oblivion under Stalin. The axe fell on him in 1930. Accused of "[[Russian formalism|formalism]]", he was interrogated and jailed for two months."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Contemporary discovery == 
In 2015, while viewing the ''Black Square'' with a microscope, art historians at the State Tretyakov Gallery in Russia discovered a message underneath its black paint. It was believed to read as "Battle of negroes in a dark cave."

The reference was linked to a 1897 comic by French writer [[Alphonse Allais]] with the caption: “Combat de Nègres dans une cave pendant la nuit” or “Negroes Fighting in a Cellar at Night.” The researchers at the State Tretyakov Gallery speculated that Malevich was responding to the joke within Allais' popular work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dunne|first1=Carey|title=Art Historians Find Racist Joke Hidden Under Malevich’s “Black Square”|url=https://hyperallergic.com/253361/art-historian-finds-racist-joke-hidden-under-malevichs-black-square/|website=Hyperalleric.com|publisher=Hyperallergic Media Inc.|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brisbane Arts Theatre''' refers to both an independent theatre company in [[Brisbane]], [[Queensland]], Australia and the building in which it resides.

__TOC__

== Theatre company history ==
Brisbane Arts Theatre was founded in 1936 as Brisbane Amateur Theatres by Jean Trundle and Vic Hardgraves. The company's name was changed in 1947. Its early seasons up until the early 1960s consisted of five productions, each with three-night seasons in venues such as All Saint's Hall, Princess Theatre, Theatre Royal and Albert Hall. It also presented 12 to 14 performances of an annual junior [[Shakespeare]] play and three one act plays throughout its season at various venues, including the Brisbane branch of the [[Royal Over-Seas League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Arts Theatre (Brisbane, Qld.) | title=[Arts Theatre [Brisbane] : Program File] | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/36727362 | accessdate=2 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fryer Library Theatre Programs – Arts Theatre [1951-] {{cite web|url=http://www.library.uq.edu.au/fryer/theatre_programs/arts_theatre.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120903190904/http://www.library.uq.edu.au/fryer/theatre_programs/arts_theatre.pdf |archivedate=2012-09-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brisbane Arts Theatre's first production in its new venue on Petrie Terrace was ''The Multi-Coloured Umbrella'' by [[Armidale, New South Wales|Armidale]] playwright Barbara Mary Vernon, which opened on 16 September 1961. Its first full season in its new home included nine plays of up to 20 performances each.

During the rebuilding of the venue (see below) between 1964 and 1965, the company persisted with its seasons off site. Following the completion of the rebuilt venue, ten plays per season were performed, each consisting of 19 performances over a five-week duration. In 1965, an annual children's theatre season was added with the first production featuring [[Carol Burns]] as Gretel in ''Hansel and Gretel''.

The company was funded only by box office revenue until government funding began in the form of a small annual [[Government of Queensland|Queensland state government]] grant in 1969, which ceased in the 1990s under the [[Wayne Goss|Goss Labor government]]. It has since again operated solely on performance revenue and College of Theatre Practice tuition fees.

In recent years the theatre's annual seasons have consisted of five to seven productions each from its mainhouse and children's theatre divisions. Its recent high-grossing productions have included the stage debuts of three plays based on novels by [[John Birmingham]], adapted by Simon Bedak: [[He Died with a Felafel in His Hand]], [[The Tasmanian Babes Fiasco]] and How to Be a Man; and productions of [[Avenue Q]] in 2012 and in 2014 and 2015. The company claims to be "Brisbane's home of Avenue Q."

== Venue history ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Brisbane Arts Theatre 210 Petrie Terrace 1960s.jpg| thumb | right | 250px | Brisbane Arts Theatre's venue in the 1960s. The venue's architectural shape served as the inspiration behind the company's new logo in 2014. {{deletable image-caption|Wednesday, 17 August 2016}}]] --&gt;
Brisbane Arts Theatre was the first theatre company in Brisbane to operate its own theatre premises. The venue is located at 210 Petrie Terrace, in the suburb of [[Petrie Terrace, Queensland|Petrie Terrace]]. It seats 151 people in the stalls and gallery combined and features a small courtyard and a bar.

The property, formerly Dan's, a second-hand shop, was purchased in June 1959 for £6,000 and redeveloped as a theatre. Initially reported to seat 220, it opened in September 1961 with a single-level, raked 144-seat auditorium and a 10[[Foot (unit)|ft]]-deep stage. The first floor accommodated the costume department and office. The theatre was officially opened by [[Premier of Queensland]] [[Frank Nicklin]] on 22 September.&lt;ref name="50years"&gt;Brisbane Arts Theatre (1987). ''The First Fifty Years 1936-1986''. {{ISBN|0731610350}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At around 3 am on 31 May 1964, the theatre was heavily damaged by fire, caused by an electrical fault in the toilet block. Upon initial assessment of the damage, the theatre director and insurance representatives agreed that the building could be repaired within a matter of weeks, however, smouldering materials ignited a second blaze at 8.30am, which resulted in extensive damage throughout. £12,000 was loaned by the [[Commonwealth Trading Bank]] for the rebuilding of the theatre based on a new design by the initial architect, John Dalton. It included the addition of a [[Theater (structure)#Seating and audience|dress circle]], increased [[Theater (structure)#Seating and audience|stalls]] capacity, a 25ft deep stage and two dressing rooms under the stage. The theatre reopened on 25 June 1965, the reconstruction totalling £20,000.&lt;ref name="50years" /&gt;

In the late 1960s the adjoining cottage – a deceased estate – was purchased for £6,000 and later, in the early 1970s, the two-storey building at 222 Petrie Terrace was added to the complex. The cottage, at number 206, was renamed after Cor Boogaart, a set constructionist for the theatre for 27 years. The property at number 222 housed the theatre's [[Wardrobe (clothing)|wardrobe department]] and rehearsal space until its sale in 2011. Cor Boogart Cottage, having previously been used as a rehearsal venue, now houses the wardrobe division and a rehearsal space and [[Theatrical scenery|set]] [[Set construction|construction]] workshop downstairs. The two rehearsal venues were renovated between 1976 and 1978 at the same time as the construction of the theatre's current [[office]] and bar. The Cor Boogaart Cottage was again refurbished following the sale of 222 in May 2011.&lt;ref name="50years" /&gt;

Brisbane Arts Theatre also runs the College of Theatre Practice, offering certificates in Performing Arts and in Live Production and Technical Services.

==Alumni==
A number of notable Australian actors have performed at Brisbane Arts Theatre, including [[Carol Burns]], [[Michael Caton]], [[Barry Otto]], [[Judith McGrath]], [[Bunny Brooke]], [[Jennifer Flowers]], [[John Stanton (actor)|John Stanton]], Penny Downie, and Kate Wilson.
Other notable performers include actor and director Ian Thomson, the late Wayne Goss, who would later become Premier of Queensland (ironically his government would cut an annual grant to the company), and Roslyn Atkinson, who would be the judge in the trial of [[Daniel Morcombe]]'s killer.

'''Carolingian art''' comes from the [[Frankish Empire]] in the period of roughly 120 years from about 780 to 900—during the reign of [[Charlemagne]] and his immediate heirs—popularly known as the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. The art was produced by and for the court circle and a group of important [[monasteries]] under Imperial patronage; survivals from outside this charmed circle show a considerable drop in quality of workmanship and sophistication of design. The art was produced in several centres in what are now France, Germany, Austria, northern Italy and the [[Low Countries]], and received considerable influence, via continental mission centres, from the [[Insular art]] of the British Isles, as well as a number of Byzantine artists who appear to have been resident in Carolingian centres.

There was for the first time a thoroughgoing attempt in Northern Europe to revive and emulate classical Mediterranean art forms and styles, that resulted in a blending of classical and Northern elements in a sumptuous and dignified style, in particular introducing to the North confidence in representing the human figure, and setting the stage for the rise of [[Romanesque art]] and eventually [[Gothic art]] in the West.  The Carolingian era is part of the period in [[medieval art]] sometimes called the "[[Pre-Romanesque art|Pre-Romanesque]]".  After a rather chaotic interval following the Carolingian period, the new [[Ottonian dynasty]] revived Imperial art from about 950, building on and further developing Carolingian style in [[Ottonian art]].

==Overview==
[[File:Musée Picardie Médiéval 01.jpg|thumb|300px|Ivory plaque, probably from a book cover, [[Reims]] late 9th century, with two scenes from the life of [[Saint Remy]] and the Baptism of [[Clovis I|Clovis]]]]
Having established an Empire as large as the [[Byzantine Empire]] of the day, and rivaling in size the old [[Western Roman Empire]], the Carolingian court must have been conscious that they lacked an artistic style to match these or even the post-antique (or "sub-antique" as [[Ernst Kitzinger]] called it)&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 8&lt;/ref&gt; art still being produced in small quantities in [[Rome]] and a few other centres in Italy, which [[Charlemagne]] knew from his campaigns, and where he was crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]] in Rome in 800.

As symbolic representative of Rome he sought the ''renovatio'' (revival) of Roman culture and learning in the West, and needed an art capable of telling stories and representing figures with an effectiveness which ornamental Germanic [[Migration period art]] could not.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 40–42&lt;/ref&gt; He wished to establish himself as the heir to the great rulers of the past, to emulate and symbolically link the artistic achievements of [[Early Christian art|Early Christian]] and [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] culture with his own.

But it was more than a conscious desire to revive ancient Roman culture. During Charlemagne's reign the [[Byzantine Iconoclasm]] controversy was dividing the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Charlemagne supported the Western church's consistent refusal to follow iconoclasm; the [[Libri Carolini]] sets out the position of his court circle, no doubt under his direction. With no inhibitions from a cultural memory of Mediterranean pagan [[idolatry]], Charlemagne introduced the first Christian monumental religious sculpture, a momentous precedent for Western art.

Reasonable numbers of Carolingian [[illuminated manuscript]]s and small-scale sculptures, mostly in ivory, have survived, but far fewer examples of metalwork, mosaics and frescoes and other types of work. Many manuscripts in particular are copies or reinterpretations of Late Antique or Byzantine models, nearly all now lost, and the nature of the influence of specific models on individual Carolingian works remains a perennial topic in art history. As well as these influences, the extravagant energy of [[Insular art]] added a definite flavour to Carolingian work, which sometimes used [[interlace (visual arts)|interlacedecoration]], and followed more cautiously the insular freedom in allowing decoration to spread around and into the text on the page of a manuscript.

With the end of Carolingian rule around 900, high quality artistic production greatly declined for about three generations in the Empire. By the later 10th century with the [[Cluny]] reform movement, and a revived spirit for the idea of Empire, art production began again. New Pre-Romanesque styles appeared in Germany with the [[Ottonian art]] of the next stable dynasty, in England with late [[Anglo-Saxon art]], after the threat from the [[Viking]]s was removed, and in Spain.

==Illuminated manuscripts==
[[File:DrogoSacramentaryFol71vAscension.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Drogo Sacramentary]], c. 850: a [[historiated initial]] 'C' contains the [[Ascension of Christ]]. The text is in gold ink.]]
{{See also|Key works of Carolingian illumination}}
The most numerous surviving works of the Carolingian renaissance are [[illuminated manuscripts]]. A number of luxury manuscripts, mostly [[Gospel book]]s, have survived, decorated with a relatively small number of full-page [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]], often including [[evangelist portrait]]s, and lavish [[canon tables]], following the precedent of the [[Insular art]] of Britain and Ireland. Narrative images and especially cycles are rarer, but many exist, mostly of the [[Old Testament]], especially [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]; [[New Testament]] scenes are more often found on the ivory [[relief]]s on the covers.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 69. Dodwell, 49 discusses the reasons for this.&lt;/ref&gt; The oversized and heavily decorated initials of Insular art were adopted, and the [[historiated initial]] further developed, with small narrative scenes seen for the first time towards the end of the period—notably in the [[Drogo Sacramentary]]. Luxury manuscripts were given [[treasure binding]]s or rich covers with jewels set in gold and carved ivory panels, and, as in Insular art, were prestige objects kept in the church or treasury, and a different class of object from the working manuscripts kept in the library, where some initials might be decorated, and pen drawings added in a few places. A few of the grandest imperial manuscripts were written on [[purple parchment]]. The [[Bern Physiologus]] is a relatively rare example of a secular manuscript heavily illustrated with fully painted miniatures, lying in between these two classes, and perhaps produced for the private library of an important individual, as was the [[Vatican Terence]]. The [[Utrecht Psalter]], stands alone as a very heavily illustrated library version of the Psalms done in pen and wash, and almost certainly copied from a much earlier manuscript.

Other liturgical works were sometimes produced in luxury manuscripts, such as [[sacramentary|sacramentaries]], but no Carolingian Bible is decorated as heavily as the Late Antique examples that survive in fragments. Teaching books such as theological, historical, literary and scientific works from ancient authors were copied and generally only illustrated in ink, if at all. The [[Chronography of 354]] was a Late Roman manuscript that apparently was copied in the Carolingian period, though this copy seems to have been lost in the 17th century.

===Centres of illumination===
Carolingian manuscripts are presumed to have been produced largely or entirely by clerics, in a few workshops around the Carolingian Empire, each with its own style that developed based on the artists and influences of that particular location and time.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 52&lt;/ref&gt; Manuscripts often have inscriptions, not necessarily contemporary, as to who commissioned them, and which church or monastery they were given to, but few dates or names and locations of those producing them. The surviving manuscripts have been assigned, and often reassigned, to workshops by scholars, and the controversies attending this process have largely died down. The earliest workshop was the Court School of Charlemagne; then a [[Rheims]]ian style, which became the most influential of the Carolingian period; a Touronian style; a Drogo style; and finally a Court School of Charles the Bald. These are the major centres, but others exist, characterized by the works of art produced there.

[[File:Ebbo Gospels St Mark.jpg|thumb|left|[[Saint Mark]] from the [[Ebbo Gospels]]]]

The Court School of Charlemagne (also known as the '''Ada School''') produced the earliest manuscripts, including the [[Godescalc Evangelistary]] (781–783); the [[Codex Aureus of Lorsch|Lorsch Gospels]] (778–820); the [[Ada Gospels]]; the [[Soissons Gospels]]; the [[Harley Golden Gospels]] (800-820);  and the [[Vienna Coronation Gospels]]; ten manuscripts in total are usually recognised. The Court School manuscripts were ornate and ostentatious, and reminiscent of 6th-century ivories and mosaics from [[Ravenna]], Italy. They were the earliest Carolingian manuscripts and initiated a revival of Roman classicism, yet still maintained [[Migration Period art]] (Merovingian and [[Insular art|Insular]]) traditions in their basically linear presentation, with no concern for volume and spatial relationships.

In the early 9th-century Archbishop [[Ebo of Rheims]], at [[Hautvillers]] (near [[Rheims]]), assembled artists and transformed Carolingian art to something entirely new. The [[Gospel book of Ebbo]] (816–835) was painted with swift, fresh and vibrant brush strokes, evoking an inspiration and energy unknown in classical Mediterranean forms. Other books associated with the Rheims school include the [[Utrecht Psalter]], which was perhaps the most important of all Carolingian manuscripts, and the ''[[Bern Physiologus]]'', the earliest Latin edition of the Christian [[Medieval allegory|allegorical]] text on animals. The expressive animations of the Rheims school, in particular the Utrecht Psalter with its naturalistic expressive figurine line drawings, would have influence on northern medieval art for centuries to follow, into the Romanesque period.

Another style developed at the monastery of [[St Martin of Tours]], in which large Bibles were illustrated based on Late Antique bible illustrations. Three large Touronian Bibles were created, the last, and best, example was made about 845/846 for [[Charles the Bald]], called the [[Vivian Bible]]. The [[Tours]] School was cut short by the invasion of the [[Normans]] in 853, but its style had already left a permanent mark on other centers in the Carolingian Empire.

[[File:Utrecht 15v 2.jpg|right|thumb|From the [[Utrecht Psalter]], 9th-century Naturalistic and energetic figurine line drawings were entirely new, and were to become the most influential innovation of Carolinian art in later periods.]]

The [[diocese of Metz]] was another center of Carolingian art. Between 850 and 855 a [[sacramentary]] was made for Bishop [[Drogo of Metz|Drogo]] called the [[Drogo Sacramentary]]. The illuminated "historiated" decorated initials (see image this page) were to have influence into the Romanesque period and were a harmonious union of classical lettering with figural scenes.

In the second half of the 9th century the traditions of the first half continued. A number of richly decorated Bibles were made for Charles the Bald, fusing Late Antiquity forms with the styles developed at Rheims and Tours. It was during this time a [[Franco-Saxon]] style appeared in the north of France, integrating Hiberno-Saxon interlace, and would outlast all other Carolingian styles into the next century.

Charles the Bald, like his grandfather, also established a Court School. Its location is uncertain but several manuscripts are attributed to it, with the [[Codex Aureus of St. Emmeram]] (870) being the last and most spectacular. It contained Touronian and Rheimsian elements, but fused with the style that characterized Charlemagne's Court School more formal manuscripts.

With the death of Charles the Bald patronage for manuscripts declined, signaling the beginning of the end, but some work did continue for a while. The [[Abbey of St. Gall]] created the [[Folchard Psalter]] (872) and the [[Golden Psalter]] (883). This Gallish style was unique, but lacked the level of technical mastery seen in other regions.

==Sculpture and metalwork==
[[File:Codex Aureus Sankt Emmeram.jpg|thumb|left|Gem-encrusted cover of the [[Codex Aureus of St. Emmeram]], 870]]

Luxury Carolingian manuscripts were intended to have [[treasure binding]]s—ornate covers in precious metal set with jewels around central carved ivory panels—sometimes these were donated some time after the manuscript itself was produced. Only a few such covers have survived intact, but many of the ivory panels survive detached, where the covers have been broken up for their materials. The subjects were often narrative religious scenes in vertical sections, largely derived from Late Antique paintings and carvings, as were those with more hieratic images derived from [[consular diptych]]s and other imperial art, such as the front and back covers of the [[Lorsch Gospels]], which adapt a 6th-century Imperial triumph to the triumph of Christ and the Virgin.

Important Carolingian examples of goldsmith's work include the upper cover of the [[Lindau Gospels]]; the cover of the [[Codex Aureus of St. Emmeram]], which can be precisely dated to 870, is probably a product of the same workshop, though there are differences of style. This workshop is associated with the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charles the Bald|Charles II (the Bald)]], and often called his "Palace School". Its location (if it had a fixed one) remains uncertain and much discussed, but [[Basilica of St Denis|Saint-Denis Abbey]] outside Paris is one leading possibility.&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, 60–68&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Arnulf Ciborium]] (a miniature [[ciborium (architecture)|architectural ciborium]] rather than the [[Ciborium (container)|vessel for hosts]]), now in the [[Munich Residenz]], is the third major work in the group; all three have fine relief figures in [[repoussé]] gold. Another work associated with the workshop is the frame of an antique [[Serpentine group|serpentine]] dish in the [[Louvre]].&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, 64-65, 66-67; [[:File:Serpentine paten Louvre MR415.jpg|picture of the dish]]&lt;/ref&gt; Recent scholars tend to group the Lindau Gospels and the Arnulf Ciborium in closer relation to each other than the Codex Aureus to either.

Charlemagne revived large-scale bronze casting when he created a foundry at [[Aachen]] which cast the doors for his [[Palatine Chapel in Aachen|palace chapel]], in imitation of Roman designs. The chapel also had a now lost life-size crucifix, with the figure of Christ in gold, the first known work of this type, which was to become so important a feature of medieval church art. Probably a wooden figure was mechanically [[gilding|gilded]], as with the Ottonian [[Golden Madonna of Essen]].

One of the finest examples of Carolingian goldsmiths' work is the Golden Altar (824–859), a ''[[paliotto]]'', in the [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]] in [[Milan]]. The altars four sides are decorated with images in gold and silver [[repoussé]], framed by borders of [[filigree]], precious stones and [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]].

The [[Lothair Crystal]], of the middle of the 9th century, is one of the largest of a group of about 20 engraved pieces of [[rock crystal]] which survive; this shows large numbers of figures in several scenes showing the unusual subject of the story of [[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|Suzanna]].

==Mosaics and frescos==
[[File:Germigny Des Pres 2007 01.jpg|thumb|Mosaic of the [[Ark of the Covenant]], [[Germigny-des-Prés]], c. 806, but restored. The subject seems drawn from illuminated Jewish bibles, and relates to the [[Libri Carolini]], possibly written by Theodulf, where the Ark is cited as divine approval of sacred images.]]
Sources attest to the abundance of wall paintings seen in churches and palaces, most of which have not survived. Records of [[Titulus (inscription)|inscriptions]] show that their subject matter was primarily religious.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mosaic]]s installed in [[Palatine Chapel in Aachen|Charlemagne's palatine chapel]] showed an enthroned Christ worshipped by the [[Evangelist's symbol]]s and the twenty-four elders from the [[Apocalypse]]. This mosaic no longer survives, but an over-restored one remains in the [[apse]] of the [[Oratory (worship)|oratory]] at [[Germigny-des-Prés]] (806) which shows the [[Ark of the Covenant]] adored by angels, discovered in 1820 under a coat of plaster.

The villa to which the oratory was attached belonged to a key associate of Charlemagne, Bishop [[Theodulf of Orléans]]. It was destroyed later in the century, but had [[fresco]]s of the [[Seven liberal arts]], the [[season|Four Seasons]], and the [[Mappa Mundi]].&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 13–17&lt;/ref&gt; We know from written sources of other [[fresco]]s in churches and palaces, nearly all completely lost. Charlemagne's Aachen palace contained a wall painting of the [[Liberal Arts]], as well as narrative scenes from his war in Spain. The palace of [[Louis the Pious]] at [[Ingelheim]] contained historical images from antiquity to the time of Charlemagne, and the palace church contained [[Typology (theology)|typological]] scenes of the Old and New Testaments juxtaposed with one another.

Fragmentary paintings have survived at [[Auxerre]], [[Coblenz]], [[Lorsch]], [[Cologne]], [[Fulda]], [[Corvey]], [[Trier]], [[Müstair]], [[Mals]], [[Naturns]], [[Cividale]], [[Brescia]] and [[Milan]].

==Spolia==
[[File:Codexaureus 25.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lorsch Gospels]] 778–820. Charlemagne's Court School.]]
[[File:Lothair Crystal AD 855-869 (Carolingian Empire).jpg|thumb|The [[Lothair Crystal]], mid-9th century]]
''[[Spolia]]'' is the Latin term for "spoils" and is used to refer to the taking or appropriation of ancient monumental or other art works for new uses or locations. We know that many marbles and columns were brought from Rome northward during this period.

Perhaps the most famous example of Carolingian spolia is the tale of an equestrian statue. In Rome, Charlemagne had seen the [[Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius]] in the [[Lateran Palace]]. It was the only surviving statue of a pre-Christian Roman Emperor because it was mistakenly thought, at the time, to be that of [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]] and thus held great accord—Charlemagne thus brought an equestrian statue from [[Ravenna]], then believed to be that of [[Theodoric the Great]], to Aachen, to match the statue of "Constantine" in Rome.

Antique [[carved gems]] were reused in various settings, without much regard to their original [[iconography]].

'''Cave Canem Foundation''' is an American [[501(c)(3)]] organization founded in 1996 by poets [[Toi Derricotte]] and [[Cornelius Eady]] to remedy the under-representation and isolation of [[African-American]] poets in [[Master of Fine Arts]] (MFA) programs and [[writing workshop]]s across the United States. It is based in [[Brooklyn]], New York.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Charles|first1=Ron|title=National Book Foundation honors group that supports African American poetry|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/national-book-foundation-honors-group-that-supports-african-american-poetry/2016/09/19/8c6a22ca-7d16-11e6-bd86-b7bbd53d2b5d_story.html|accessdate=February 7, 2017|work=The Washington Post|date=September 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cave Canem programs include an annual summer retreat, regional workshops, first- and second-book poetry prizes, anthology publication and national readings and panels. The organization has also published two anthologies, ''Gathering Ground: A Reader Celebrating Cave Canem’s First Decade'', edited by Derricotte and Eady ([[University of Michigan Press]], 2006), and ''The Ringing Ear: Black Poets Lean South'', edited by [[Nikky Finney]] ([[University of Georgia Press]], 2007).

In September 2016, [[National Book Foundation]] awarded Cave Canem the [[Literarian Award]] for service to the American literary community.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==History==
Founded in 1996 by poets Toi Derricotte and Cornelius Eady,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Cave Canem Foundation began as a week-long writing retreat for selected African-American poets at Mount St. Alphonsus Conference Center in [[Esopus, New York]]. Since then, Cave Canem "has grown from an initial gathering of 26 poets to become an influential movement with a renowned faculty and a high-achieving national fellowship" of over 300.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.chronicle.pitt.edu/?p=1445 | first=Patricia Lomando | last=White | title=Pitt Supports Cave Canem’s Annual Poetry Retreat | date=March 27, 2008 | newspaper=Pitt Chronicle | publisher=University of Pittsburgh | location=Pittsburgh, PA | accessdate=June 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation's name, [[Cave Canem]], is Latin for "[[Beware of the Dog]]" and refers to a sign that Derricotte spotted while visiting the [[House of the Tragic Poet]] in the volcanic ash covered city of [[Pompeii]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Programs==
Writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 2015, [[Stephen Burt]] described Cave Canem as "a major incubator for the current renaissance in black poetry, which includes the poets [[Tracy K. Smith]], who won the 2012 [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry|Pulitzer Prize in poetry]]; Afaa Michael Weaver, who won the Kingsley Tufts prize last year; and, most recently, [[Claudia Rankine]], who won the [[National Book Critics Circle Award]] for poetry this year."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Burt|first1=Stephen|title=Galaxies Inside His Head|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/29/magazine/galaxies-inside-his-head-poet-terrance-hayes.html|accessdate=February 5, 2017|work=The New York Times|date=March 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retreat===
Currently held annually at the [[University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg]], Pennsylvania, Cave Canem’s tuition-free retreat is a week of faculty-led writing workshops and poetry readings for African-American poets. Accepted applicants (fellows) may participate for a maximum of three summers within a five-year period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://cavecanempoets.org/retreat| title=Cave Canem: Retreat| accessdate=March 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Past faculty have included Presidential Inaugural poet [[Elizabeth Alexander (poet)|Elizabeth Alexander]];&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Pulitzer Prize]] winner [[Yusef Komunyakaa]]; [[National Book Award]] finalists [[Patricia Smith (poet)|Patricia Smith]] and [[Carl Phillips]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and 2011 National Book Award winner [[Nikky Finney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gordinier|first1=Jeff|title=The Dark Room Collective: Where Black Poetry Took Wing|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/27/arts/the-dark-room-collective-where-black-poetry-took-wing.html|accessdate=February 7, 2017|work=The New York Times|date= May 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Established in 1999, workshops for emerging poets of color are held semi-annually in [[New York City]] and, more recently, in [[Columbia, South Carolina]], in partnership with the South Carolina Poetry Initiative. Instructors have included former [[List of U.S. states' Poets Laureate|Poet Laureate of Connecticut]], [[Marilyn Nelson]], [[Whiting Writers' Award]] winner [[Tyehimba Jess]], and [[American Book Award]] winner, [[Kimiko Hahn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://cavecanempoets.org/workshops| title=Cave Canem: Workshops| accessdate=March 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In 2016, Cave Canem became the first organization (rather than individual) to win the National Book Foundation's Literarian Award for service to the American literary community. The National Book Foundation's executive director [[Lisa Lucas (publisher)|Lisa Lucas]] said: "Cave Canem’s innovative and effective literary activism has been transformative to the world of letters. Their ongoing commitment to provide supportive channels for African American poets to thrive has yielded works that enrich the world’s literary culture."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the [[theatre of ancient Greece]], the '''''chorêgos''''' (pl. ''chorêgoi''; {{lang-el|χορηγός}}, [[Greek etymology]]: χορός "chorus" + ἡγεῖσθαι "to lead"){{#tag:ref|The Attic and Doric form was "χορᾱγός" (choragos) rather than the more usual Greek form "χορηγός" (choregos).&lt;ref&gt;[[A Greek–English Lexicon|Liddell and Scott]], p. 1668&lt;/ref&gt; The later forms of the word in [[Latin]] (choragus) and Italian (corago) followed the Attic spelling.&lt;ref name=OED&gt;[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/32286?redirectedFrom=choragus "choragus, n."], ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', September 2013. Oxford University Press. Retrieved 9 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} was a wealthy [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] citizen who assumed the public duty, or ''choregiai'', of financing the preparation for the [[Greek chorus|chorus]] and other aspects of dramatic production that were not paid for by the government of the ''[[polis]]'' or [[city-state]].&lt;ref name=Brockett&gt;Brockett, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Anglicized forms of the word include '''choragus''' and '''choregus''', with the accepted plurals being the Latin forms ''choregi'' and ''choragi''.&lt;ref name=OED/&gt; In modern Greek the word ''χορηγός'' is synonymous with the word "grantor".&lt;ref&gt;Pring, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt;

''Choregoi'' were appointed by the [[archon]] and the tribes of Athenian citizens from among the Athenian citizens of great wealth. Service as a ''choregos'', though an honor, was a duty for wealthy citizens and was part of the [[Liturgy (ancient Greece)|liturgical]] system designed to improve the city-state's economic stability through the use of private wealth to fund public good.  Choregoi paid for costumes, rehearsals, expenses of the chorus (including training, salaries, board and lodging), scenery, props (including elaborate [[Theatre of ancient Greece#Masks|masks]]), special effects and most of the musicians.  The ''choregos'' also hosted a feast if his chorus proved victorious in competition. The prizes for drama at the Athenian festival competitions were awarded jointly to the playwright and the ''choregos''.&lt;ref name=Brockett/&gt; Such victories carried prestige for the ''choregos''. Several notable political figures served as ''choregoi'', including [[Themistocles]], [[Pericles]] and [[Plato]], among others.  Monuments were built in honor of victorious ''choregoi''.

At the turn of the 17th century AD, in an attempt to recreate the ancient Greek dramatic tradition, the position was revived briefly in Italian opera, and combined the roles of impresario and director.

==Nomination and appointment==
Under the [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] constitution, ''choregoi'' were appointed by the [[archon]] and the [[Phyle|tribes]] of Athenian citizens. The archon appointed ''choregoi'' for the tragedies, while the tribes supplied five ''choregoi'' for the comedies as well as ''choregoi'' for the [[Dionysia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Choragus|volume=6|page=269}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Thargelia]] (the major festival competitions).&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;  The archon, who began this process months in advance of a festival, were able easily to identify potential dramatic ''choregoi'' because their mutual wealth allowed them to move in the same social circles as the most qualified candidates. In order to be considered for the role of ''choregos'', an individual had to be an Athenian citizen and possess great wealth. ''Choregoi'' for [[Greek chorus|choruses]] of boys were required by Athenian law to be over forty years old to protect the young participants. Volunteers from this selected group of qualified individuals may have been the source of most appointments. The figure of the ''choregos'' can be traced back as early as the 7th century B.C. References to the title are found in recovered portions of the earliest choral lyric poetry, including the ''Parthenia'' (or "Maiden-songs") of [[Alkman]], a poet of archaic [[Sparta]].&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;Wilson, pp. 53–61, 113 and 198–213&lt;/ref&gt;

Service as a ''choregos'', though an honor, was a duty rather than a choice for wealthy citizens. This duty was one among many built into the state [[Liturgy (ancient Greece)|liturgical]] system of ancient Athens, which was designed to improve the city-state's economic stability through the use of private wealth to fund public good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaiser|first=Brooks A.|title=The Athenian Trierarchy: Mechanism Design for the Private Provision of Public Goods|journal=The Journal of Economic History|date=June 2007| volume=67|issue=2| page=448| jstor=4501159| doi=10.1017/s0022050707000162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once nominated, however, a potential ''choregos'' had three choices. He could accept the nomination and the duty. Through a process called ''skepsis'', he could claim one of several specifically defined exemptions and be excused from service. Finally, he could identify another Athenian who was more qualified to perform the role of ''choregos'' and use the procedure of ''skepsis'' to resolve the matter.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;

==Duties of the ''choregoi''==
Choregoi were responsible for supporting many aspects of [[Theatre of ancient Greece|theatre]] production in ancient Athens: paying for costumes, rehearsals, the chorus, scenery or scene painting (including such items as ''[[mechane]]'' and ''[[ekkyklema]]''), props (including elaborate [[Theatre of ancient Greece#Masks|masks]]), special effects, such as sound, and musicians, except that the state provided the flute player and paid the actors not in the chorus.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, William; Wayte, William; Marindin, G.E. Ed. (1890). [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0063%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DC%3Aentry+group%3D5%3Aentry%3Dchoregus-cn "Choragus"]. ''A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities''. perseus.tufts.edu. Retrieved 17 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; At the City Dionysia in Athens, for example, the ''choregos'' was expected to finance all aspects relating to the chorus, which could include training, the hiring of an expert to execute such training, salaries, and board and lodging during a lengthy rehearsal period.&lt;ref name=Foley/&gt;

The ''choregos'' did not act as the director for the production; this role was fulfilled by the playwright.&lt;ref&gt;The playwright also appeared in the production and acted as the ''didaskalos'' or teacher, instructing the other principal actors. See Brockett, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''choregos'' would appoint a ''chorodidaskalos'' (Χοροδιδάσκαλος, often shortened to διδάσκαλος), often the playwright, to train the chorus.&lt;ref&gt;Buck, 18-33&lt;/ref&gt; The ''choregos'' was often expected to host a feast, analogous to a modern cast party, should his chorus prove victorious in competition.&lt;ref name=Foley/&gt; According to the ''Oxford Dictionary of the Classical World'': "The sums spent on choregiai show that the duty could elicit vast expenditure. One extremely enthusiastic choregos catalogues a list which represents an outlay of nearly two and a half talents. This includes a dithyrambic choregia at the Little Panathenaea for 300 drachmae, and a tragic choregia for 3,000 dr. The latter figure is roughly ten times what a skilled worker might have earned annually."&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, John (ed.) "chorēgia", ''Oxford Dictionary of the Classical World'', Oxford University Press, 2007 {{ISBN|9780192801463}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reorganization of the ''choregia'' in 406 BC spread the cost among the wider community – the synchoregia – with the ''choregos'' paying only part of the expense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Capps| first=Edward|title=The Dramatic Synchoregia at Athens|journal=The American Journal of Philology|year=1896| volume=17| issue=3| pages=319–328| jstor=288240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prizes and recognition==
[[File:Choragic Monument of Lysicrates.jpg|thumb|Choragic Monument of Lysicrates near the Acropolis in Athens, Greece]]
The prizes for drama at the Dionysia were awarded jointly to the playwright and the ''choregos''.&lt;ref name=Brockett/&gt; Originally the ''choregos'' acted on behalf of his tribe, which collectively won the [[wikt:kudos#Noun|kudos]] for a successful performance. Gradually the sponsoring ''choregoi'' asserted more personal responsibility, and by the fourth century BC the prize for the ''choregos'' was a personal award. The winner was expected to display his trophy in a place of honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Buck|first=Carl D.|title=Discoveries in the Attic Deme of Ikaria 1888. III. The Choregia in Athens and at Ikaria. Inscriptions from Ikaria Nos. 5-7|journal=The American Journal of Archaeology and of the History of the Fine Arts|date=March 1889|volume=5|issue=1|pages=18–33|jstor=495931}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such victories carried prestige for the ''choregos'', and these honors could be an important stepping stone to a successful political career for wealthy young Athenians. Conversely, failure to successfully execute one's role as a ''choregos'' could lead to social humiliation.&lt;ref name=Foley&gt;{{cite journal|last=Foley| first=Helene| title=Choral Identity in Greek Tragedy|journal=Classical Philology|date=January 2003|volume=98|issue=1|page=3| doi=10.1086/378725| jstor=10.1086/378725}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victorious ''choregoi'' were honored further with the erection of a monument in honor of their accomplishment. These monuments, which have become an important source of scholarly knowledge about the ''choregoi'', were the final step in the victory celebration, which also involved a parade and a feast. Each monument featured an eloquent inscription that echoed the original victory announcement made at the Dionysia.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;

==Notable ''choregoi''==
Greek society was a symbiosis of art and politics, and several notable political figures of the time served as ''choregoi''. [[Themistocles]] was ''choregos'' for [[Phrynichus (tragic poet)|Phrynichus']] ''Phoenissae'' (named for the Phoenician women who formed the chorus), and [[Pericles]] acted as ''choregos'' for ''[[The Persians]]'' by [[Aeschylus]].&lt;ref&gt;Zelenak, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; In 365 BC, [[Plato]], a rare exception to the qualification of wealth, served as ''choregos'' for a boys chorus supported by the patronage of [[Dionysius II of Syracuse]].&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; Choregos Lysicrates is remembered today because of the [[Choragic Monument of Lysicrates|monument]] still standing in Athens erected in honor of the festival victory of his production in 335 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = De Cou | first1 = Herbert F. | year = 1893 | title = The Frieze of the Choragic Monument of Lysikrates at Athens | url = | journal = The American Journal of Archaeology and of the History of the Fine Arts | volume = 8 | issue = 1| pages = 42–55 | doi=10.2307/495920| jstor = 495920 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruins of a choragic monument to [[Nicias]] from the 5th-century BC were discovered in Athens in 1852.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dinsmoor|first=W.B.|title=The Choragic Monument of Nicias| journal=American Journal of Archaeology|date=October–December 1910|volume=14|issue=4|page=459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropic context==
''Choregoi'' were an example of a larger tradition of cosmopolitanism, defined by an interest in benefiting others, that dominated many aspects of urban life for the wealthy in ancient Greece and which has been linked to Western philanthropy.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller| first=Eugene F.| title=Philanthropy and Cosmopolitanism|journal=The Good Society| year=2006| volume=15| issue=1| pages=51–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these acts, which also included subsidy of temples, armories, and other essential municipal needs, were driven more by personal vanity, societal pressure, and political influence than the modern philanthropic impulse. Nevertheless, the ''choregoi's'' contributions to the theatre of ancient Greece were integral to the flourishing of drama in ancient Greece and the structure of the society's cultural landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Philanthropy – Ancient Mediterranean Examples| url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/10645/Philanthropy-Ancient-Mediterranean-Examples.html| accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest references to the philanthropic impulse can be traced to Aeschylus's ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'' with the use of the word ''philanthropia'', which is translates to "love of humankind," displaying an early tie between the theatre and the ''choregoi'', and philanthropy.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt;

==17th-century revival==
At the turn of the 17th century AD, when the first operas were being written in an attempt to recreate the old Greek dramatic tradition, the position of ''choregos'' was revived briefly. It was known in Italian as "corago", and combined the roles of impresario and director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Savage|first=Rover|author2=Matteo Sansone|title=Il Corago and the Staging of Early Opera: Four Chapters from an Anonymous Treatise circa 1630|journal=Early Music|date=November 1989|volume=17|series=The Baroque Stage I|issue=4|pages=494–511|doi=10.1093/earlyj/xvii.4.495|jstor=3127018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christopher Burkett''' (born 1951) is an American [[landscape photography|landscape photographer]], known not only for his [[large format]] photography of woodlands but also as a craftsman who "makes every print himself with a skill that is unsurpassed"&lt;ref&gt;Jim Alinder "Paradise Found"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Photography==
Burkett requires "absolute material accuracy" and has since 1980 evolved into one of the greatest color printers in the history of the medium, creating Cibachrome color prints of unprecedented dimension (40x50) from his brilliant 8x10 transparencies.  "The best of Christopher Burkett's photographs have an almost mystical sense of connection to us, one that cannot fully be conveyed through words or reproductions.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Alinder "Paradise Found"&lt;/ref&gt; "All of Christopher's photographs, is able to act across distance, to illumine a viewer standing fifty or a hundred feet away, to transcend the physical dimensions of its frame."&lt;ref&gt;James Reid "Vital Form and Radiant Light: A Painter Explores the Photographs of Christopher Burkett"&lt;/ref&gt;

Burkett is also a former brother in an [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] religious order who, Vincent Rossi writes, has "transformed photographic technique into a spiritual endeavor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=Rossi, V.|title=Glimpses of Paradise: Beauty and the Natural World in the Photography of Christopher Burkett|booktitle = Intimations of Paradise: Photographs by Christopher Burkett|publisher=West Wind Arts|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 15, 2018 the PBS national network broadcast a segment about Burkett on NewsHour Weekend. The program states: "Christopher Burkett has been photographing the American landscape for over four decades." "He and his wife, Ruth, have lugged their camera gear across all 50 states."  "He says he want to make both the physical and the ethereal accessible."  "Light and luminosity are critical elements of Burkett's work."  "For Burkett, photography is not just an artistic but a spiritual experience that's informed by his religious faith."  And Burkett says: "...going out and photographing is one thing, but spending time bringing the light out of these images to share them with other people is really what it’s all about."&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/landscape-photographer-races-to-finish-decades-of-work PBS video shown on NewsHour Weekend]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Burkett was born in 1951, grew up in the [[Pacific Northwest]], and now lives in [[Oregon]]. He joined a Christian religious brotherhood in the early 1970s&lt;ref&gt;The date he joined the brotherhood is not listed explicitly in the [http://www.christopherburkett.com/pages/articles/certainlight.html View Camera Magazine interview from Burkett's web site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320195844/http://www.christopherburkett.com/pages/articles/certainlight.html |date=2007-03-20 }} but can be inferred from the 1979 date he left the order and from the seven years he is said to have spent in it.&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 1975, first became interested in photography as a form of spiritual expression.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christopherburkett.com/pages/articles/certainlight.html View Camera Magazine interview from Burkett's web site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320195844/http://www.christopherburkett.com/pages/articles/certainlight.html |date=2007-03-20 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979 he left the brotherhood and married his wife, Ruth.

A '''costume designer''' is a person who designs [[costume]]s for a [[film]], [[Stage (theatre)|stage]] production or television. The role of the costume designer is to create the characters' outfits/costumes and balance the scenes with texture and colour, etc.&lt;ref name="Landis"&gt;{{cite book | title=Filmcraft: Costume Design: Costume Design | publisher=Elsevier Science | author=Landis, Deborah Nadoolman | date=2012-03-16 | pages=Introduction | isbn=9780240818672}}&lt;/ref&gt; The costume designer works alongside the [[Theatre director|director]], [[scenic design|scenic]], [[lighting designer]], sound designer, and other creative personnel. The costume designer may also collaborate with hair stylist, wig master, or makeup artist. In European theatre, the role is different, as the theatre designer usually designs both costume and scenic elements.

Designers typically  seek to enhance a character's personality, and to create an evolving plot of colour, changing social status, or period through the visual design of garments and accessories. They may distort or enhance the body—within the boundaries of the director's vision. The designer must ensure that the designs let the actor move as the role requires. The actor must execute the director's blocking of the production without damaging the garments. Garments must be durable and washable, especially for plays with extended runs or films with near-[[Real time (media)|real time]] [[Pace (speed)|pacing]] (meaning that most costumes will not change between scenes) but whose [[principal photography]] phase may stretch across several weeks. The designer must consult not only with the director, but the set and lighting designers to ensure that all elements of the overall production design work together. The designer must possess strong artistic capabilities and a thorough knowledge of pattern development, draping, drafting, textiles and fashion history. The designer must understand historical costuming, and the movement style and poise that period dress may require. 

==History==
{{Expand section|date=May 2016}}

During the late-19th century, [[Theatrical company management|company managers]] in the US usually selected costumes for a show. Many were pulled from a rental house; few were designed. Though designers in other theatrical disciplines were recognized, few who specialized in costumes were. The few that were included [[Caroline Siedle]], [[William Charles John Pitcher|C. Wilhelm]], [[Percy Anderson]], and Mrs. John Alexander. They sometimes even received credit on the title page of a [[Programme (booklet)|playbill]] rather than in the back.&lt;ref&gt;King, Kimball. ''Western Drama through the Ages: A Student Reference Guide''. Westport, CT: Greenwood, 2007. 534. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, film costume designers like [[Edith Head]] and [[Adrian (costume designer)|Adrian]] became well known. Later, those working in television like [[Nolan Miller]] (''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''), [[Janie Bryant]] (''[[Mad Men]]''), and [[Patricia Field]] (''[[Sex and the City]]'') became more prominent, some becoming authors and having their own clothing and jewelry lines.&lt;ref name="meltzer20130919"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/19/fashion/costume-designers-for-tv-have-a-big-impact-on-fashion.html |title=Get Me Wardrobe! |last=Meltzer |first=Marisa |date=2013-09-19 |newspaper=The New York Times |page=E1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of costume designers==
{{Costume}}

Professional costume designers generally fall into three types: freelance, residential, and academic.

*Freelance designers are hired for a specific production by a theatre, dance or opera company, and may or may not actually be local to the theatre they design for.  A freelancer is traditionally paid in three instalments: Upon hire, on delivery of final renderings, and opening night of the production.  Freelancers are not obligated to any exclusivity in what projects they work on, and may design for several productions concurrently.
*A residential designer is hired by a specific theatre, dance or opera company for an extended series of productions.  This can be as short as a summer stock contract, or may be for many years.  A residential designer's contract may limit the amounts of freelance work they are allowed to accept.  Unlike the freelancer, a residential designer is consistently "on location" at the theater—at hand to work with costume studio and other collaborators.  Residential designers tend to be more established than strict freelancers, but this is not always the case.
*An academic designer is one who holds professorship at a school.  The designer is primarily an instructor, but may also act as a residential designer to varying degrees.  They are often free to freelance, as their schedule allows.  In the past, professors of costume design were mostly experienced professionals that may or may not have had formal post-graduate education, but it has now become increasingly common to require a professor to have at least a [[Master of Fine Arts]] in order to teach.

Both residential and academic designers are generally also required to act as Shop Master or Mistress of an onsite costume shop, in addition to designing productions. In a resident theatre, there is almost always a shop staff of stitchers, drapers, cutters and craft artisans. In an academic environment the shop "staff" is generally students, who are learning about costume design and construction. Most universities require costume design students to work a specified number of hours in the shop as part of their course work.

==Unions==
There are two unions that costume designers can belong to:

Costume Designers Guild, Local 892 is one union that represents Costume Designers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.CostumeDesignersGuild.com]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees]] and [[United Scenic Artists]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usa829.org/ Local 829] usa829.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Many costumers belong to the Motion Picture Costumers Union, Local 705 and represent every position within the costume department (except the costume designer).  Local 705 represents Costume Supervisors, Key Costumers, Costumers, Tailor/Seamstress, Ager/Dyer, Cutter/Fitters, Costume House Employees and Commercial Costumers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.motionpicturecostumers.org/local705/ Local 705] motionpicturecostumers.org&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3839">The '''Cripple Creek Theatre Company''' is a grassroots, non-profit theatre company in [[New Orleans, LA]], [[Louisiana]], [[United States]] known for producing productions with large, diverse casts.  The company was founded in December 2005 by [[Andrew Kingsley]] and [[Andrew Vaught]] for the purpose of instigating action toward social and economic justice in the South. The founders both attended [[Kenyon College]] in [[Gambier, Ohio]] where they studied American history and theater.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.www.kenyoncollegian.com/media/storage/paper821/news/2006/11/09/Features/Players.For.Social.Change-2450265.shtml "Players for social change" by Kate Farrow, November 9, 2006, from ''Kenyon Collegian'']{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre has been identified a driving force in the recovering city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/08/01/arts/NA-FEA-US-Katrina-Theater.php?page=1 "New Orleans theater's post-Katrina boom," International Herald Tribune, August 1, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Productions ==

In March 2007, the theatre produced ''The Green, Gold and Purple Shuffle'' a satire of Louisiana politics featuring former governor [[Edwin Edwards]] and klansman [[David Duke]]. The production, performed in Washington Park in the [[Faubourg Marigny|Marigny]], employed the device of [[invisible theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090105230519/http://www.cripplecreekplayers.org/documents/reviews/tp-shuffle.pdf "Satirical Shuffle Amuzes in Park" by David Cuthbert, March 17, 2007, from ''The Times-Picayune'']&lt;/ref&gt; The [[City of New Orleans]] refused access to the Moon Walk adjacent [[Jackson Square, New Orleans|Jackson Square]] because of the controversial subject matter.

''Bury the Dead'', an anti-war zombie play. The production was nominated for three [[Ambie Awards]], including best drama. Andrew Vaught was nominated for best direction and Andrew Kingsley for best lighting design.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stageclick.com/show/75.aspx "Ambie Awards for 2007"&lt;/ref&gt;

The company's production of the Inspector General by [[Nikolai Gogol]] and adapted by Andrew Kingsley was taped by CNN.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bestofneworleans.com/dispatch/2008-03-04/thea_rec.php "Stage Recommended: The Inspector General" by Will Coviello, March 4, 2008, from ''Gambit Weekly'']{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The play coincided with the establishment of the [[City of New Orleans]]' Office of the Inspector General. [[Robert A. Cerasoli]] addressed the audience following many performances.

The theatre was asked to restage its inaugural production, Tennessee Williams' 'Kingdom of Earth' at the Tennessee Williams Festival in the spring of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120907151624/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/123862.html "Sternhagen, Caldwell, Seldes, Among Guests at 2009 Tennessee Williams Fest" by Kenneth Jones, December 2, 2008, from ''Playbill Magazine'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs ==

The company also runs the [[Louisiana Stage Writers' Workshop]] which encourages playwright development in New Orleans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cripplecreekplayers.org/pages/initiatives.html Cripple Creek Theatre Co.] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20080820025825/http://www.cripplecreekplayers.org/pages/initiatives.html |date=2008-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dead Island: Official Announcement Trailer''''' is an [[advertisement|announcement trailer]] for the 2011 video game ''[[Dead Island]]'', which was developed by [[Techland]] and published by [[Deep Silver]]. The story of the trailer follows a family who is attacked by a horde of zombies in a hotel. The trailer ends with the infected daughter, who has turned into a zombie, being thrown to her death from a hotel window. The trailer was produced by Glasgow-based Axis Animation, with music created by [[Giles Lamb]].

The trailer was designed to be emotional, allowing players to care for the characters and to be distinct from trailers for the game's competitors. The trailer does not show any actual gameplay, instead telling a short story about the game's world and the background behind its events. The development team also had the goal to show the inevitability and the helplessness of a family in a zombie outbreak. Upon its release on February 16, 2011, the trailer sparked public interest, and the community reaction led Techland to adjust the content of the actual game. It was met with a mixed reception from critics. Praise was directed at the trailer's new ideas, story, immersion and tone, however, it received criticism for lacking gameplay information and its depiction of a dead child. The trailer received multiple awards upon release.

==Plot==
The story is presented in [[Reverse chronology|reverse chronological order]] and in [[slow motion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2011/03/23/dead-island-there-is-an-apocalypse-happening/|title=Dead Island: "There is an apocalypse happening"|first=Keza|last=MacDonald|work=[[VG247]]|date=March 23, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/videos/dead-island-cgi-trailer/2300-6299756/|title=Dead Island CGI Trailer|first=Dan|last= Mihoerck |date=February 17, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015|work=[[GameSpot]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trailer follows a family, consisting of a father, a mother and a daughter, visiting Banoi, an island paradise. After they have settled in a hotel, an unexpected [[zombie outbreak]] occurs.&lt;ref name="Kok"/&gt; The daughter is running away from the horde of zombies in the hotel's corridor and dashing towards her room, where her father and mother are staying, when she is caught. A zombie bites the daughter's legs, causing her to become infected with the zombie virus.

The father opens the door and picks up a [[fire axe]] to fight against zombies. He rescues his daughter and brings her inside the hotel room. After placing the injured daughter on a bed, the couple begin fighting the zombies who are breaking into the room. The zombies overwhelm them, and the daughter turns into a zombie and attacks her father, biting him on the neck.  To defend himself, the father struggles, trying to push her off, until he throws her out of the window, breaking the glass. The daughter dies on impact with the ground. While the father is struggling, the mother is attacked and eaten by several zombies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZqrG1bdGtg|title=Dead Island: Official Announcement Trailer|work=[[IGN]]|date=February 16, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The corpses of the couple can be seen in a hotel room in the beginning of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5837416/the-final-moments-of-that-heartbreaking-dead-island-family-discovered-in-the-game|title=The Final Moments of That Heartbreaking Dead Island Family Discovered in the Game|first=Brian|last=Crecente|work=[[Kotaku]]|date=September 6, 2011|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
''[[Dead Island]]'', originally announced in 2007 by Techland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/08/08/dead-island-details-rescued|title=Dead Island Details Rescued|first=Daemon|last=Hatfield|work=[[IGN]]|date=August 8, 2007|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[action role-playing game|action role-playing]] [[survival horror]] video game. Set in a zombie-infested tropical island called Banoi, the game focuses heavily on melee combat. According to Techland, it was a game about killing zombies, not a game focused on delivering an emotional experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5775798/that-heartbreaking-dead-island-family-theyre-not-in-the-game|title=That Heartbreaking Dead Island Family? They're Not In The Game|first=Brian|last=Crecente|work=[[Kotaku]]|date=April 3, 2011|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2011, Techland declined to give new information regarding the game as requested by the game's publisher, [[Deep Silver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/coj-dev-still-working-on-dead-island|title=COJ dev still working on Dead Island |first=Ellie|last=Gibson|date=June 7, 2009|accessdate=October 24, 2015|work=[[Eurogamer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the lack of new information surrounding the game, many critics believed that the game had been quietly cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/dead-island-trailer-shows-the-worst-vacation-ever/|title=Dead Island Trailer Shows The Worst Vacation Ever|work=[[International Business Times]]|date=February 16, 2011|first=Ryan|last=Fleming|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was released on February 16, 2011, approximately four years after the game's initial announcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2011/02/16/welcome-to-dead-island|title=Welcome to Dead Island|first=Ryan|last=Geddes|work=[[IGN]]|date=February 16, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trailer was produced and made by the [[Glasgow]]-based Axis Animation, which had previously created trailers for ''[[Killzone 2]]'' and ''[[Mass Effect 2]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.develop-online.net/news/dead-island-trailer-creators-revealed/0108748|title=Dead Island trailer creators revealed|first=Rob|last=Crossley|work=[[Develop (magazine)|Develop]]|date=February 17, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stuart Aitken, Axis's Managing Director and Technical Director and the director of the trailer, [[Deep Silver]] gave the team a lot of creative freedom and flexibility in creating the trailer, allowing them to create their own characters instead of using the in-game protagonists.&lt;ref name="Line"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.list.co.uk/article/37118-dead-island/|title=Dead Island: The game behind the stunning trailer, developed by Axis Animation and Savalas, is finally ready for release|first=Henry|last=Northmore|work=[[The List (magazine)|The List]]|date=August 25, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deep Silver had given them a script and general ideas for them to follow, and the team expanded upon it. In order to make the trailer feel [[non-linear]] and focused, the team decided to narrow down the trailer's location to only a single hotel room.&lt;ref name="G4TV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/710713/dead-island-the-making-of-an-amazing-video-game-trailer/|title=Dead Island: The Making Of An Amazing Video Game Trailer|first=Anthony|last=Hernandez|work=[[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4TV]]|date=February 22, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deep Silver wanted the trailer to have some exterior environment. As a result, the team added a segment which has the daughter falling from the hotel window; in the process, audiences glimpse the island setting.&lt;ref name="Dev"/&gt;

The team hoped that despite the short duration of the trailer, audiences would understand the story and be connected with its characters. They decided that it would be easy for players to identify with a family and that a story involving parents and children could convey the message quickly.&lt;ref name="G4TV"/&gt; They intended to use the trailer to depict the background information of the game, presenting information regarding the "discovery" of the outbreak, its inevitability,&lt;ref name="Dev"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.develop-online.net/interview/how-we-made-the-gore-ballet-dead-island-trailer/0116981|title=How we made the 'gore ballet' Dead Island trailer|work=[[Develop (magazine)|Develop]]|first=Rob|last=Crossley|date=February 24, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the helplessness of the family. The team had an internal debate on whether the trailer should show guns, ultimately deciding that doing so would distract from the primary goal of the story.&lt;ref name="G4TV"/&gt; The story originally had the mother turn into a zombie, but the team changed it to the daughter, as they considered her more vulnerable when facing a large group of zombies.&lt;ref name="Dev"/&gt; The team was worried that the action and violence featured would seem excessive, and they decided to alleviate the problem by introducing non-chronological storytelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/109577-Dead-Island-Publisher-Shares-Its-Trailer-Making-Secrets|title=Dead Island Publisher Shares Its Trailer-Making Secrets|first=Logan|last=Westbrook|work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]|date=April 29, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deep Silver also proposed to mitigate the violence by having the trailer presented in [[slow motion]], as they believed that it could make the action feel "balletic" instead of purely violent.&lt;ref name="Dev"/&gt;

The trailer is made up of [[computer imagery]], and it does not show any actual gameplay footage of ''Dead Island''.&lt;ref name="Line"/&gt; The team hoped to use the trailer as a piece of "artwork", stating influence from the ''Carousel'' trailer from [[Philips]].&lt;ref name="Escapist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/issues/issue_303/8817-The-Ballet-of-Death|first=Robert|last=Rath|title=Rise From Your Grave: The Ballet Of Death|work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]|date=April 26, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trailer was also designed to showcase "great zombie moments" in an effort to attract the genre's supporters.&lt;ref name="Dev"/&gt; The actual game development team used the trailer to build up the mood and atmosphere for the game, and they designed quests which required players to help people who had lost their families. They hoped that the mood would make players feel that they were the only hope existing on the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/07/paradise-lost-how-dead-island-hopes-to-live-up-to-emotional-trailer/|title=How Dead Island hopes to live up to emotional trailer|first=Andrew|last=Webster|work=[[Ars Technica]]|date=July 15, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trailer's music was composed by [[Giles Lamb]], who worked for a soundtrack development company called Savalas.&lt;ref name="Line"/&gt; The music was designed to be "somber", "melancholy", and "elegant",&lt;ref name="Dev"/&gt; in contrast with the gore presented in the trailer.&lt;ref name="Line"/&gt; The music was designed to be tense when the trailer is depicting violent action, and beautiful during peaceful moments. The team hoped that the music would create a "juxtaposition between beauty and horror".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2011/02/25/dead-island-cinematic-designer-responds-to-mixed-trailer-reactions.aspx|title=Dead Island Cinematic Designer Responds To Mixed Trailer Reactions|first=Annette|last=Gonzalez|date=February 25, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015|work=[[Game Informer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular reaction to the trailer led Techland to slightly adjust the game's tone, gameplay, and story, as well as the game's promotion strategy.&lt;ref name="Poly"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2012/11/14/3537988/dead-island-the-reckoning|title=Dead Island: The Reckoning|first=Russ|last=Pitts|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=February 21, 2012|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="views"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2011/09/02/dead-island-release-trailer/|title=How a viral trailer set up Dead Island as a triple-A game release next week|first=Matthew|last=Lynley|work=[[VentureBeat]]|date=September 2, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
A week after the release of the trailer, more than one million people had viewed it through [[YouTube]], exceeding Deep Silver's expectation of only 100,000 views.&lt;ref name="views"/&gt; ''Dead Island'' also became one of the most searched items on [[Google]], [[YouTube]], and [[Twitter]] for several days.&lt;ref name="views"/&gt; Axis was pleasantly surprised at the trailer's popularity.&lt;ref name="Dev"/&gt; Following the trailer's release, ''Dead Island'' became a widely anticipated game.&lt;ref name="views"/&gt;

Many critics praised the trailer's use of reverse storytelling. Keith Stuart from ''[[The Guardian]]'' compared it favorably to [[Coldplay]]'s "[[The Scientist (song)|The Scientist]]", saying that it successfully delivered an affecting and emotive experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2011/feb/17/dead-island-trailer-controversial|title=Dead Island: Will It Be The Most Controversial Trailer Ever Made|first=Keith|last=Sturat|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=February 17, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mike Fahey from ''[[Kotaku]]'' called the trailer's use of the dead girl "heartbreaking" and thought that it would be amazing if Techland was able to incorporate these emotional elements into the actual game.&lt;ref name="Kok"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5762287/dead-island-returns-and-a-little-girl-dies|title=The Most Heartbreaking Zombie Video Game Trailer You'll Ever See|first=Mike|last=Fahey|work=[[Kotaku]]|date=February 16, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its graphics and pacing also received commendation.&lt;ref name="Reception"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-problem-with-game-trailers/1100-6365663/|title=The Problem With Game Trailers|first=Laura|last= Parker |date=March 12, 2012|accessdate=October 24, 2015|work=[[GameSpot]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trailer's story was praised for presenting an unconventional take on a zombie apocalypse.&lt;ref name="reception"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kotaku.com.au/2011/09/dead-islands-trailer-was-amazing-appalling-and-enlightening/|title=Dead Island's Trailer Was Amazing, Appalling And Enlightening|first=Kirk|last=Hamilton|work=[[Kotaku]]|date=September 13, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jason Schreier from ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' said that the trailer had successfully made a saturated genre feel fresh again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2011/02/dead-island-trailer/|title=Don't Get Caught Up In Dead Island Trailer Hype|first=Jason|last=Schreier|work=[[Wired.co.uk]]|date=February 17, 2011|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trailer generated controversy around the depiction of the daughter's death. Fahey said that such elements are something video games usually "shy away from", yet it is presented as a main focus in the trailer.&lt;ref name="Kok"/&gt; Ben Parfitt from ''[[Market for Home Computing and Video Games]]'' found it offensive and thought that the team had stepped across the mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/opinion-that-dead-island-trailer/04843|title=OPINION: That Dead Island trailer|first=Ben|last=Parfitt|work=[[Market for Home Computing and Video Games]]|date=February 17, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defending the trailer, Axis said that their depiction fit the overarching narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/dead-island-trailer-creator-speaks-to-dead-girl-controversy/|title=Dead Island trailer creator speaks to dead girl controversy|first=Matt|last=Bradford|work=[[GamesRadar]]|date=February 24, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Rath from ''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]'' also liked the segment, calling it "deliberate and necessary", and thought that the overall effect would have been significantly hampered if had been removed from the trailer.&lt;ref name="Escapist"/&gt;

The lack of gameplay information was also criticized. Laura Parker found the trailer disconnected from the actual game, with the trailer being misleading by not showing any in-game information, and with the game failing to deliver the same emotional effect as the trailer.&lt;ref name="Reception"/&gt; Daemon Hatfield from [[IGN]] similarly thought that the trailer was not useful in assessing the game's quality and expressed concerns that the game would not be as entertaining and interesting as the trailer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2011/03/04/gdc-is-dead-island-anything-like-its-debut-trailer|title=GDC: Is Dead Island Anything Like Its Debut Trailer|first=Daemon|last=Hatfield|work=[[IGN]]|date=March 3, 2011|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon release, many reviewers thought that the trailer had set expectation too high for the actual game, and that the game ended up not meeting expectations.&lt;ref name="reception"/&gt;

The trailer was given a gold award at the [[Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/06/29/dead-island-trailer-wins-gold-award-at-cannes-advertising-fe/|title=Dead Island trailer wins Gold award at Cannes ... advertising festival|first=Christopher|last=Grant|work=[[Joystiq]]|date=June 29, 2011|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was named by gaming journalists as one of the best video game trailers ever made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videogamer.com/features/article/ten_of_the_best_cgi_game_trailers.html|title=Ten of the Best CGI Game Trailers|work=VideoGamer.com|date=February 17, 2011|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/the-best-game-trailers-of-the-generation-1462534128|title=The Best Game Trailers Of The Generation|first=Kirk|last=Hamilton|work=[[Kotaku]]|date=November 11, 2013|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/11/the-14-best-game-trailers-of-2014|title=The 14 Best Game Trailers Of 2014|first=Marty|last=Silva|work=[[IGN]]|date=December 11, 2014|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Destruction''' is a German [[thrash metal]] band, formed in 1982. They are often credited as one of the "Big Four" of the [[German thrash metal]] scene, the others being [[Kreator]], [[Sodom (band)|Sodom]] and [[Tankard (band)|Tankard]]. In addition to helping pioneer [[black metal]] by containing several elements of what was to become the genre, Destruction was part of the second wave of thrash metal in the late 1980s, along with American bands [[Testament (band)|Testament]], [[Sacred Reich]], [[Death Angel]] and [[Dark Angel (band)|Dark Angel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.metalblade.com/us/news/sacred-reich-announces-usa-tour-with-byzantine/|title=Sacred Reich announces "30 Years of Ignorance" USA tour with Byzantine as support|website=[[Metal Blade Records|metalblade.com]]|date=May 1, 2017|accessdate=November 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For most of the 1990s, the band was not signed to a record label and was forced to self-produce their albums until they signed a contract with [[Nuclear Blast]] in the early 2000s.

== Biography ==
Inspired by [[Iron Maiden]], [[Mercyful Fate]], [[Motörhead]] and [[Venom (band)|Venom]], Destruction were formed as Knight of Demon in 1982. The original line-up featured vocalist and bassist Schmier, drummer Tommy Sandmann, and guitarist Mike Sifringer. They soon changed their name to Destruction and released a demo titled ''[[All Hell Breaks Loose (Destruction album)#Bestial Invasion of Hell|Bestial Invasion of Hell]]'' in 1984. After this the group signed with [[SPV GmbH|Steamhammer Records]] and released an EP titled ''[[Sentence of Death]]'' later that year.

Destruction released their first full-length album titled ''[[Infernal Overkill]]'' in 1985, followed by ''[[Eternal Devastation]]'' in 1986. The trio then added a second guitarist, Harry Wilkens, and released the EP ''[[Mad Butcher]]'' and the full-length album ''[[Release from Agony]]'' in 1987, then a live recording ''[[Live Without Sense]]'' in 1989, and ''[[Cracked Brain]]'' in 1990.

In 1989, during the initial recording sessions of ''Cracked Brain'', Schmier was fired from the band, and was replaced by [[Poltergeist (band)|Poltergeist]] frontman André Grieder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrrecords.de/high_roller/sites/release_detail.php?relno=552|title=DESTRUCTION - Cracked Brain LP|publisher=hrrecords.de|accessdate=February 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mike Sifringer continued to release albums under the moniker of "Neo-Destruction". In 1999, Schmier rejoined, and things began to look up for the band as they signed a record deal with [[Nuclear Blast]]. They then released three more albums: ''[[All Hell Breaks Loose (Destruction album)|All Hell Breaks Loose]]'' in 2000, ''[[The Antichrist (album)|The Antichrist]]'' in 2001, and ''[[Metal Discharge]]'' in 2003. The band would then sign with [[AFM Records]] and release ''[[Inventor of Evil]]'' in 2005. That album was followed two years later by the compilation of re-recorded songs ''[[Thrash Anthems]]'' (2007), and then a year later by ''[[D.E.V.O.L.U.T.I.O.N.]]'' (2008). In February 2011, Destruction released ''[[Day of Reckoning (Destruction album)|Day of Reckoning]]''.

A European tour with [[Overkill (band)|Overkill]] was scheduled for March 2011. Headlining dates in South America and North America were being planned for April and May.

The band's thirteenth studio album, ''[[Spiritual Genocide]]'', was released in November 23, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nuclearblast.de/en/label/music/news/details/2771282.destruction-spiritual-genocide-out-now.html |title=Destruction – 'Spiritual Genocide' Out Now! |publisher=Nuclearblast.de |date=2012-09-23 |accessdate=2013-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their next album, ''[[Under Attack (Destruction album)|Under Attack]]'', was released on May 13, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/destruction-to-release-under-attack-album-in-may/|title=DESTRUCTION To Release 'Under Attack' Album In May|publisher=bravewords.com|date=January 15, 2016|accessdate=January 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through an exclusive [[PledgeMusic]] campaign, Destruction recorded a sequel to ''Thrash Anthems'' titled ''[[Thrash Anthems II]]''. Like its predecessor, this album is a compilation of more re-recordings of classic songs by the band. The band released a full download of the album through PledgeMusic for free to accompany all purchases of the physical copies of the album on July 18, 2017. The exclusive CDs/Vinyls were shipped in August 2017 and once sold out, Nuclear Blast will release a more widely available version at the end of the year.

On January 23, 2018, it was announced that Vaaver had left Destruction "for family reasons", according to Schmier. He took time off in 2015 to be with his family following the birth of his second child. Drummer [[Randy Black]] would temporarily replace him until the band finds a "worthy successor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/destruction-parts-ways-with-drummer-wawrzyniec-vaaver-dramowicz/|title=DESTRUCTION Parts Ways With Drummer WAWRZYNIEC 'VAAVER' DRAMOWICZ|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|accessdate=January 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/destruction-drummer-vaaver-explains-his-decision-to-leave/|title=DESTRUCTION Drummer VAAVER Explains His Decision To Leave|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|accessdate=January 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later announced as the band's new drummer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/destruction-officially-welcomes-new-drummer-randy-black/|title=DESTRUCTION Officially Welcomes New Drummer RANDY BLACK|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|accessdate=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[El Greco]] painted his '''''Dormition of the Virgin''''' near the end of his Cretan period, probably before 1567. El Greco's signature on the base of the central candelabrum was discovered in 1983. The discovery of the ''Dormition'' led to the attribution of three other signed works of "Doménicos" to El Greco (''[[Modena Triptych]]'', ''[[St. Luke Painting the Virgin and Child]]'', and ''[[The Adoration of the Magi]]'') and then to the acceptance as authentic of more works, signed or not (such as ''The Passion of Christ (Pietà with Angels),'' painted in 1566).&lt;ref name="Alberge"&gt;D. Alberge, [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,13509-2326011,00.html  Collector Is Vindicated as Icon is Hailed as El Greco]&lt;/ref&gt;

This discovery constituted a significant advance in the understanding of El Greco's formation and early career.&lt;ref name="Gallery"&gt;Web Gallery of Art, [http://www.wga.hu/html/g/greco_el/01/0101grec.html ''The Dormition of the Virgin'']&lt;/ref&gt; The painting combines [[Cretan School|post-Byzantine]] and Italian [[Mannerism|mannerist]] stylistic and iconographic elements. El Greco is now seen as an artist with a formative training on Crete; a series of works illuminate the style of early El Greco, some painted while he was still in Crete, some from his period in Venice, and some from his subsequent stay in Rome.&lt;ref name="Cormack"&gt;Cormack-Vassilaki, [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0PAL/is_522_162/ai_n15950295/pg_1 The Baptism of Christ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[icon]], which retains its function as an object of veneration in the Church of the Dormition of the Virgin in [[Syros]], was probably brought to the island during the [[Greek War of Independence]]. The icon conforms closely to the established pattern for this subject, which was very common in the Orthodox Church in which El Greco was raised and was influenced by.&lt;ref name="Gallery"/&gt;  Nevertheless, it has lost some elements of the traditional Byzantine austerity, adopting traits of the [[Renaissance]] engravings.&lt;ref&gt;M. Tazartes, ''El Greco'', 74&lt;/ref&gt;

The composition of the ''[[Burial of the Count of Orgaz]]'' has been closely related to the Byzantine [[iconography]] of the [[Dormition of the Theotokos]]. The examples that have been used to support this point of view have a close relationship with the icon of the ''Dormition'' by El Greco that was discovered in 1983 in the church of the same name in Syros. Marina Lambraki-Plaka believes that such a connection exists.&lt;ref name="Plaka55"&gt;M. Lambraki-Plaka, ''El Greco-The Greek'', 55&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Byron, according to whom the iconographic type of the ''Dormition'' was the compositional model for ''The Burial of the Count of Orgaz'', asserts that El Greco as a genuine Byzantine painter worked throughout his life with a repertoire of components and motifs at will, depending on the narrative and expressive requirements of the art.&lt;ref name="Byron160"&gt;R. Byron, ''Greco: The Epilogue to Byzantine Culture'', 160-174&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hadon of Ancient Opar''''' is a [[fantasy]] novel by American writer [[Philip José Farmer]], first published in paperback by [[DAW Books]] in April 1974, and reprinted three times through 1983. The first British edition was published by Magnum in 1977; it was reprinted by Methuen in 1993. The first trade paperback edition was published by Titan Books in 2013. The work has also been translated into French. It was later gathered together with its sequels ''[[Flight to Opar]]'' and ''The Song of Kwasin''  into the omnibus collection ''Gods of Opar: Tales of Lost Khokarsa'' (2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{isfdb title|id=9570|title=Hadon of Ancient Opar}}&lt;/ref&gt; It and its sequels purport to fill in some of the ancient prehistory of the lost city of [[Opar (fictional city)|Opar]], created by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] as a setting for his [[Tarzan]] series.

==Plot==
In the plot of the novel, Hadon journeys to Khokarsa to compete in the "Great Games", in which he triumphs. The prize being that he is entitled to marry the ruling high priestess, should she choose to accept him, and thus become high priest and king of the Khokarsa. However, King Minruth is unwilling to relinquish power and schemes to be rid of Hadon.

The novel deals with the expedition of Hadon, a young Oparian warrior, to the Wild Lands and as far as the mysterious Ringing Sea, which would one day be called the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], with the strange woman whom he meets and brings with him, and with the cataclysmic [[civil war]] which breaks out on his return and which he partly (and completely unintentionally) helps touch off.

The ancient [[Khokarsa]]n society of which Opar is a part is a [[matriarchy]] (a reasonable inference from the culture of the later-day Opar encountered by Tarzan). A delicate balance between the genders is maintained, symbolized by the co-rule of the high priestess and the king (whose main authority is command of the army), which corresponds to some theories of sociologists and historians on the way actual matriarchal societies may have worked. The same scheme is repeated on a smaller scale on the local level, where towns are co-governed by a local priestess and the commander of the local garrison.

The current king, Minruth, tries to subvert this immemorial system and establish exclusive male power, which incidentally would force an incestuous relationship upon the current high priestess, Awineth, who happens to be his daughter. Lalila, the foreign "White Witch from the Sea," whom Hadon brings with him and with whom he falls in love, is used as a pawn in King Minruth's power game; the xenophobic suspicions aroused about her are used in an attempt to undermine the position of women in general.

Hadon and his male and female friends rally to the high priestess' banner against the king's evil schemes.

==Setting==
[[Opar (fictional city)|Opar]] is the first and most frequently re-visited of the many [[lost cities]] and cultures which [[Tarzan]] discovers in [[Africa]]. As portrayed by Burroughs, Opar is ruled by the high priestess [[La (Tarzan)|La]], with whom Tarzan develops a prolonged love/hate relationship. The city itself is a decayed remnant of ancient greatness; it is suggested, though not conclusively, that it is a cut-off colony of [[Atlantis]].

Farmer seizes on Burroughs' ambiguity over the issue to recast Opar as a member city of an otherwise unknown local civilization that flourished in central Africa during the last [[Ice Age]]. It was supposedly based on a pair of now vanished inland seas connected by a narrow strait, with a surface roughly equivalent to the [[Mediterranean]]. The two seas facilitated the appearance of a mercantile culture, technologically similar to [[Ancient Greece]], while the rest of the world was still deep in the [[Stone Age]].

Farmer shows this culture at or near the peak of its ancient glory, more than 10,000 years ago. It comprises numerous thriving (and sometimes warring) [[city states]] and empires, one of which is Opar. Opar is, in fact, far from the most important of these cities. The Opar described in the Tarzan novels is depicted as a "former colony of [[Atlantis]]" and this is adhered to by Farmer, though "Atlantis" in this context—the capital of the empire of which Opar is a province—is located on an island in the African inland sea, not in the [[Atlantic Ocean]].

Eventually, subsequent to the period of his story, the two seas drain off into the Atlantic and the culture dependent on them decays and disappears, leaving only the remnant of Opar forgotten in the jungles where Tarzan will discover it. The seas' modern remnants are represented to be the much-shrunken [[Lake Chad]] and the [[Congo River]] basin.

While originally derived from the Tarzan series, the world created by Farmer is given its own independent literary existence, with the sociological and cultural aspects worked out in meticulous detail, and a long historical annex added at the end.

==Reception==
[[Lester del Rey]] found the novel to be "good fun" and noted that Farmer was not imitating Burroughs either in storytelling or characterization, although he faulted Farmer for providing an installment in a longer story rather than one with a dramatic resolution.&lt;ref&gt;"Reading Room", [[If (magazine)|''If'']], August 1974, pp.141-42&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on the novel for ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Theodore Sturgeon]] described Farmer as "tireless and astonishing".&lt;ref&gt;"If . . . ?", ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'', September 8, 1974, p.38&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property''' ('''ICCROM''') is an [[Intergovernmental organisation|intergovernmental organization]] dedicated to the preservation of cultural heritage worldwide through training, information, research, cooperation and advocacy programmes. It aims to enhance the field of [[conservation-restoration]] and raise awareness to the importance and fragility of cultural heritage.

The creation of the Centre took place as a result of a proposal at the [[UNESCO]] General Conference held in [[New Delhi]], in 1956. Three years later, the Centre was established in [[Rome]], [[Italy]], where its headquarters remain to this day.

ICCROM responds to the needs of its [[Member States]], which are currently at 136.&lt;ref name="About Us"&gt;{{Cite web

| accessdate = 2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
ICCROM’s mission is defined by a set of statutes that were drafted shortly before its establishment (and revised on 25 November 2009).&lt;ref name="ICCROM Statutes"&gt;{{Cite web
| title = ICCROM Statutes
| url = https://www.iccrom.org/sites/default/files/2017-01/Statutes_2009_EN%26FR.pdf

{{quote|Article 1, Purpose and functions

The 'International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property', hereinafter called 'ICCROM', shall contribute to the worldwide conservation and restoration of cultural property by initiating, developing, promoting and facilitating conditions for such conservation and restoration. ICCROM shall exercise, in particular, the following functions:

# collect, study and circulate information concerned with scientific, technical and ethical issues relating to the conservation and restoration of cultural property;
# coordinate, stimulate or institute research in this domain by means, in particular, of assignments entrusted to bodies or experts, international meetings, publications and the exchange of specialists;
# give advice and make recommendations on general or specific questions relating to the conservation and restoration of cultural property;
# promote, develop and provide training relating to the conservation and restoration of cultural property and raise the standards and practice of conservation and restoration work;
# encourage initiatives that create a better understanding of the conservation and restoration of cultural property. }}

===Activities===
ICCROM's mission is fulfilled through five areas of activity: training, information, research, cooperation and advocacy.

====Training====
ICCROM contributes to capacity building through the development of educational materials, training activities worldwide, internships and fellows. Since 1965, ICCROM has offered courses to mid-career professionals on a wide range of topics that include archaeological site conservation, architectural records and inventories, built heritage conservation, conservation decision making, cultural heritage management, preventive conservation in museums and risk management to endangered collections. Other courses are focused on specific materials such as stone, wood, or sound and image collections, and others still focus on the conservation of heritage in specific regional areas, such as the Arab region or Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name="ICCROM Information"&gt;ICCROM Information (brochure, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Information====
The ICCROM library is one of the world’s leading sources of information on the conservation and restoration of cultural heritage. It contains more than 115,000 registered references and 1,800 specialized journals in more than 60 languages. In addition, the archive contains institutional records that date back to ICCROM’s creation, as well as over 200,000 images of cultural heritage worldwide in relation to ICCROM’s scientific and educational activities. The website is a portal to comprehensive information about courses, activities, international events, and employment and training opportunities in the conservation field.&lt;ref name="ICCROM Information"/&gt;

====Research====
ICCROM facilitates a vast network of conservation professionals and institutions through which it organizes and coordinates meetings to devise common approaches and methodologies. It also promotes the definition of internationally agreed ethics, criteria and technical standards for conservation practice. The in-house laboratory is also a reference point and resource for professionals, course participants, interns and fellows of the organization.&lt;ref name="ICCROM Information"/&gt;

====Cooperation====
ICCROM carries out all of its activities in collaboration with a vast number of institutional and professional partners. Additionally, it serves its Member States in the form of collaborative projects, training, and technical advice. &lt;ref name="ICCROM Information"/&gt;

====Advocacy====
ICCROM disseminates teaching materials and organizes workshops and conferences to raise public awareness and support for conservation.&lt;ref name="ICCROM Information"/&gt;

==History==
The end of the Second World War came with the need to repair monuments and other forms of cultural heritage that had been either damaged or destroyed. At the same time, other countries were emerging from colonization and were eager to industrialize, reclaim and redefine their cultural identity, and train personnel to preserve their heritage.

On an international level, there was a lack of cohesive training and authoritative bodies to guide countries in rebuilding and protecting their heritage. Thus, during the Sixth Session of the UNESCO General Conference (1951), the Swiss government introduced a resolution that proposed the establishment of an international centre to encourage the study and awareness of methods of conservation on a global scale. This was adopted and a committee of experts were put together to decide upon the role and functions of this institution. In the Centre’s ten-year anniversary commemorative booklet ("The First Decade 1959-1969", pp. 12-13), Hiroshi Daifuku of the Section for the Development of the Cultural Heritage (UNESCO) explained,&lt;ref name="Daifuku"&gt;{{Citation

  | url = http://www.iccrom.org/ifrcdn/pdf/ICCROMhistory_10years_en.pdf
  | accessdate = &lt;!-----9 February 2010-----&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Mr. [[Georges Henri Rivière]] (then Director of [[International Council of Museums|ICOM]]) was appointed chairman of a sub-committee of the International Committee for Monuments of UNESCO for the creation of the Centre. The members of this Committee, when discussing the proposed functions of the Centre (September 25, 1953), considered that such a body could, for example:
:# treat major problems involved in conservation, such as lighting;
:# call upon a wide range of specialists from different countries;
:# provide information to countries which lack laboratories;
:# treat problems concerned with the preservation of monuments;
:# coordinate research and having a stronger [[moral authority]] eventually prevent badly trained conservators from undertaking restoration of important works of art.|}}

These functions would become the template for the Centre’s statutes.

In 1956 the resolution was adopted at the Ninth Session of the UNESCO General Conference in New Delhi and in 1957, an agreement was signed between the Government of the Italian Republic and UNESCO to establish this Centre in Rome.&lt;ref name="Daifuku"&gt;{{Citation

  | url = http://www.iccrom.org/ifrcdn/pdf/ICCROMhistory_10years_en.pdf
  | accessdate = &lt;!-----9 February 2010-----&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The adhesion of five Member States by 1958 allowed the Statutes to come into force, making the Centre a legal entity. Collaboration was established with other European conservation institutions, namely the Central Institute of Restoration of Italy (ICR, now ISCR) and the Royal Institute for Restoration of Works of Art (IRPA) in Belgium. A provisional council nominated by UNESCO was created to govern the Centre and in 1959, it opened in Rome with [[Harold Plenderleith|Harold J. Plenderleith]], renowned Keeper at the [[British Museum]], as its Director. The Belgian art historian, Paul Philippot was appointed Deputy Director and the first General Assembly took place in 1960 during which the first regular Council Members were elected.

'''Joni Eareckson Tada''' (born October 15, 1949) is an [[evangelical Christian]] author, radio host, and founder of ''Joni and Friends'', an organization "accelerating Christian ministry in the disability community."

==Early life==
Tada was born in 1949 in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], the youngest of four daughters. Her parents were named John and Lindy Eareckson.&lt;ref name="HistorysWomen"&gt;{{cite web |title=Joni Eareckson Tada |url=https://historyswomen.com/history-in-the-making/joni-eareckson-tada/ |website="historyswomen.com" |publisher=A Minute with History's Women |accessdate=November 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joni was named for her father, John Eareckson, so her name is pronounced like "Johnny".&lt;ref name="HistorysWomen" /&gt;

Her father participated in the 1932 Olympics as an alternate for the United States wrestling team and was honored as a Distinguished Member of the National Wrestling Hall of Fame in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wrestling Hall of Fame {{!}} Johnny Eareckson |url=https://nwhof.org/stillwater/hall-of-fame/#type=hof&amp;honoree=102 |website=''nwhof.org'' |publisher=National Wrestling Hall of Fame |accessdate=November 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Rev. Neil C. Damgaard, Th.M., D.Min. |title=Notes from the Pulpit Ministry |url=https://dartmouthbible.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/Hope-in-God-2-Mar-25-2018-2.pdf |website="www.dartmouthbible.org" |publisher=Dartmouth Bible Church |accessdate=December 2, 2018 |date=March 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the example of her parents, Tada lived a very active life all through her growing up years. She enjoyed riding horses, hiking, tennis, and swimming. On July 30, 1967, she dove into the [[Chesapeake Bay]] after misjudging the shallowness of the water. She suffered a fracture between the fourth and fifth cervical levels and became a [[quadriplegic]] (or [[Tetraplegia|tetraplegic]]), paralyzed from the shoulders down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.joniandfriends.org/radio/5-minute/jonis-diving-accident45-years/ |title=Joni Eareckson Tada Commemorates 45 Years of Quadriplegia &amp;#124; Radio |publisher=Joni and Friends |date=July 30, 2012 |accessdate=April 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Tada's two years of rehabilitation, according to her autobiography ''Joni'', she experienced anger, depression, suicidal thoughts, and religious doubts. However, during occupational therapy, learned to paint with a brush between her teeth and began selling her artwork. She also writes this way, although for most writing tasks she relies on voice recognition software. To date, she has written over forty books, recorded several musical albums, starred in an autobiographical movie of her life, and is an advocate for people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Victory Through Suffering |url=http://powertochange.com/changed/jeareckson/ |publisher=Power to Change |accessdate=November 30, 2018 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090110172239/http://powertochange.com/changed/jeareckson/ |archivedate=January 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tada wrote of her experiences in her 1976 international best-selling autobiography, ''Joni: The unforgettable story of a young woman's struggle against quadriplegia &amp; depression'', which has been distributed in many languages. The book was made into a 1979 feature film of the same name, starring herself. Her second book, ''A Step Further'', was released in 1978.&lt;ref name="RightNow"&gt;{{cite web |title=Joni Eareckson Tada |url=https://www.rightnowmedia.org/Content/Speaker/1139 |publisher=RightNow Media |accessdate=November 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ministry and public life==
Tada founded Joni and Friends in 1979, an organization to "accelerate [[Christian]] ministry in the disability community"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.joniandfriends.org/about-us/|title=About Us |website=''joniandfriends.org''| publisher=Joni and Friends|access-date=October 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; throughout the world. In 2007 the Joni and Friends International Disability Center in [[Agoura Hills, California]], was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.joniandfriends.org/radio/4-minute/joni-and-friends-international-disability-center/|title=The Joni and Friends International Disability Center |website=''joniandfriends.org''| publisher=Joni and Friends|access-date=October 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Led by Tada and Doug Mazza (President and COO), the Joni and Friends International Disability Center runs a multi-faceted non-profit covering a number of program outlets. The longest running program is "Joni and Friends Radio", a five-minute radio program begun in 1982. It now runs four minutes in length and can be heard each weekday on over 1,000 broadcast outlets. Tada also records a one-minute radio broadcast "Diamonds in the Dust" that airs daily. Both programs have received awards: "Joni and Friends Radio" received the "Radio Program of the Year"&lt;ref name="Ambassador"&gt;{{cite web |title=Joni Eareckson Tada |url=https://ambassadoradvertising.com/portfolio-posts/joni-eareckson-tada/ |website=ambassadoradvertising.com |publisher=Ambassador Advertising |accessdate=December 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; award from [[National Religious Broadcasters]] in 2002 and "Diamonds in the Dust" won the same award in 2011 in the short program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Diamonds in the Dust Named NRB Short Form Radio Program of the Year |url=http://nrb.org/news-room/press_center/diamondsi-in-the-dust-named-nrb-short-form-radio-program-of-the/ |website=National Religious Broadcasters |accessdate=December 2, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
Tada received media attention in 2014 for her performance of the title song from the Christian film ''[[Alone yet Not Alone]]''.

== Personal life ==
Joni married Ken Tada in 1982. For many years, Ken was a high school history teacher and coach, though he is now retired. Ken is [[sansei]], meaning that he is the second generation to be born in the United States after his family relocated from Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.joniandfriends.org/blog/kintsugi/|title=Kintsugi|access-date=October 31, 2017|publisher=Joni and Friends}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ken and Joni live in [[Calabasas, California]].&lt;ref name="GodTV"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://godtv.com/joni-eareckson-tada-faced-mandatory-evacuation-due-to-the-california-wildfires/|title=Joni Eareckson Tada Was Evacuated Due To The California Wildfires.

[[File:Photograph of Artist Karen Wheeler.jpg|thumb|Karen Wheeler]]
'''Karen Sue Wheeler''' (born 1955 in [[Winfield, Kansas]]) is an American artist who was born with a neurodegenerative condition called [[spinal muscular atrophy]] which causes muscle wasting. She uses a technique called "layering" that resembles colored pencil. Each painting that she produces takes from 150–500 hours to complete.

== Childhood ==
Wheeler was born in 1955 in Winfield, Kansas, and is the middle of three children. Her parents were told she would not live beyond a year old.&lt;ref name="LVRJ Mar2011"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bornfeld|first=Steve|title=Karen Wheeler Doesn't Let Muscular Dystrophy Curtail Her Artistry|url=http://www.lvrj.com/neon/karen-wheeler-doesn-t-let-muscular-dystrophy-curtail-her-artistry-118975179.html|accessdate=1 July 2012|newspaper=Las Vegas Review Journal|date=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wheeler says that she started creating art when she was 5, because she was unable to play outside.&lt;ref name="LVNV Jun2002"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bristol|first=Emily|title=Artist Overcomes Adversity With Love of Painting|url=http://www.viewnews.com/2002/VIEW-Jun-19-Wed-2002/anthem/18954660.html|accessdate=6 July 2012|newspaper=Las Vegas Neighborhood View|date=19 June 2002}}(dead link)&lt;/ref&gt;

== College ==
Wheeler attended [[Santa Ana College]] before transferring to [[California State University, Fullerton]], where she received a Master’s Degree in Art in 1981 with a 4.0 grade point average.&lt;ref name=2.&gt;{{cite news|last=Lyle|first=Michael|title=Henderson Artist to be Featured at Gallery During First Friday|url=http://www.lvrj.com/view/henderson-artist-to-be-featured-at-gallery-during-first-friday-132979818.html|accessdate=1 July 2012|newspaper=Las Vegas Review Journal|date=1 Nov 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Wheeler has developed a sling-like device&lt;ref name="LVRJ Mar2011"/&gt; that she wears on her arm to assist her with wielding her tools, rather a brush, pencil or pen. She uses a small brush and very little pigment that creates a dry-brush effect called "layering" that resembles colored pencil. Each painting that she produces takes from 150–500 hours to complete.&lt;ref name=3.&gt;{{cite news|last=Perez|first=Pj|title=Art Provides Independence|url=http://www.lasvegasweekly.com/news/archive/2006/jul/20/art-provides-independence/|accessdate=6 July 2012|newspaper=Las Vegas Weekly|date=20 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wheeler served on the Board of Directors of [[Very Special Arts]] California from 1985 to 1992, and currently serves as an honorary board member. She was selected as Disabled Professional Woman of the Year by the Pilot Club of Southeast Los Angeles in 1990, and has been a Board member of the (Las) Vegas Artists Guild since 2003, serving two terms as President and was the Director of Vegas Artists Guild, and in charge of Shows until September 2012.&lt;ref name="LVRJ Mar2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LVNV Jun2002" /&gt;

In April 2012, Wheeler with business partner, William Schnell co-created GoHitYourself.com. They created the site to educate persons with disabilities on how to better their situations and to illuminate these situations for the able-bodied person. In 2014, Wheeler and Schnell rebranded and merged GoHitYourself.com with Wheeler's personal site where her amazing art is now profiled alongside her stories about living with a disability. The rebranded site is located at KarenWheeler.com.

== Works ==
Wheeler's early works are watercolor, but she has also used oil paints, acrylics, pencils and ink.  Her subject matter varies but she is known to hide a rose in most of her pieces which symbolizes herself.&lt;ref name="LVRJ Mar2011" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3221">In [[US]] and [[Canada|Canadian]] [[filmmaking]], the '''key grip''' supervises all [[Grip (job)|grip]] (lighting and rigging) crews and reports to the [[director of photography]].&lt;ref name=Goodell&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodell|first=Gregory|title=Independent Feature Film Production: A Complete Guide from Concept Through Distribution|year=2003|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=0312304625|pages=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsibilities==
Before filming begins, the key grip attends location scouts and meets the director of photography to determine what additional tools (location-specific motor vehicles, dollies, cranes, mounts, etc.) will be needed, orders and prepares required equipment, and transports equipment to the filming location.&lt;ref name=Uva /&gt; Once on set, the key grip coordinates with the electric and camera departments alongside the director of photography to control lighting and camera movement and setup.&lt;ref name=Dzyaz&gt;{{cite book|last=Dzyak|first=Brian|title=What I Really Want to Do on Set in Hollywood: A Guide to Real Jobs in the Film Industry|year=2010|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|isbn=0307875164}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a supervisor, the key grip directs the crew of grips, many with specialized skills such as dolly grips, crane operators, or special equipment operators.&lt;ref name=Uva&gt;{{cite book|last=Uva|first=Michael G.|title=Uva's Basic Grip Book|year=2002|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis US|isbn=0240804856|pages=5–6|author2=Uva, Michael |author3=Uva, Sabrina }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The key grip is sometimes credited as the "first company grip."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Honthaner|first=Eve Light|title=The Complete Film Production Handbook|year=2010|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis US|isbn=024081150X|pages=471|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety==

The key grip is frequently asked to be the safety monitor of the film set. Changes in the film and television worlds have created lasting change in crew responsibilities. Any union production crews working under the "Hollywood" umbrella are required to take [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]]-style certified courses in safety. The first AD (first [[assistant director]]) is responsible for the safe operation of the set. The key grip no longer has that distinction in newer Hollywood policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uic.edu/sph/glakes/harts1/HARTS_library/filmall.txt uic.edu, LIGHTS! CAMERA! SAFETY!, A Health and Safety Manual for Motion Picture and Television Production, by Michael McCann, Ph.D., C.I.H.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other countries==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8451">'''''Le livre du chemin de long estude''''' ("The book of the path of long study") is a first-person [[Dream vision|dream allegory]] by [[Christine de Pizan]]. Composed in 1402–03, it presents a critique of the moral state of the world and particularly France, lamenting the results of warfare.

The poem was dedicated to [[Charles VI of France]]; Christine de Pizan presented the first manuscript to [[John, Duke of Berry]]. [[Philip the Bold|Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy]], and [[Louis I, Duke of Orléans]], also received copies.&lt;ref name=Blumenfeld-Kosinski/&gt;

==Contents==
As the first-person narrator sits in her study, she reads [[Boethius]]'s ''[[The Consolation of Philosophy]]'', which cheers her momentarily and, as she falls asleep, prompts a vision in which the [[Cumaean Sibyl]] comes to her and takes her on a journey that takes her to [[Mount Parnassus]], the abode of philosophers and poets, then to the Holy Land and Asia, and ends at the [[Earthly Paradise]], of which the Christine narrator is offered a vision and explanation. The journey continues through the [[Celestial spheres]], before she is returned to earth.

Back on earth, the Christine narrator witnesses a debate between two allegorical figures: [[Earth (classical element)#European tradition|Earth]] attempts to convince [[Reason|Lady Reason]] to put a stop to war. Other allegorical characters are asked for advice, and the ideal qualities of a person who could function as a world emperor are discussed. The group decides that such an emperor must be chosen at the French court; Christine is appointed as the messenger who should deliver their conclusions to France. Then, there is a knock at the bedroom door, and the dream is over.

==Background and literary models==
The book is one of two "lengthy allegories on political and philosophical themes" by de Pizan; the other is ''Le livre de la mutacion de fortune''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kempt|first=Daniel|editor=Carole Levin|others=Patricia A.

==Publication history and legacy==
The book was, like many others by Christine de Pizan, made for a number of patrons; though dedicated to [[Charles VI of France]]; manuscripts were presented to [[John, Duke of Berry]], [[Philip the Bold|Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy]], and [[Louis I, Duke of Orléans]].&lt;ref name=Blumenfeld-Kosinski/&gt; There are four known illustrated versions remaining: [[Harleian Library|Harley 4431]] (part of the collection de Pizan prepared for [[Isabeau of Bavaria]]), [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|BNF 836]], and [[Royal Library of Belgium|Brussels]] 10982 and 10983. The four all have different illustrations of different scenes, placing different accents on textual aspects; for instance, Harley 4431 has eight illustrations, of which four are set in the heavens, thus "privileging the celestial portion of Christine's journey".&lt;ref name=gibbons/&gt;

In 1549 a modernized prose version was produced by Jean Chaperon and printed by [[Estienne Groulleau]] in Geneva, under the title ''Le Chemin de long estude de Dame Cristine de Pise''; this was the last printed edition of any of her texts in the sixteenth century. Chaperon gives de Pizan all the credit for its contents, and according to Cynthia J. Brown, the publication of this edition meant that "Christine de Pizan's authorship and literary reputation had become firmly established by the mid-sixteenth century and that French publishers were directing her work to a male and female audience".&lt;ref name=brown&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Cynthia J.|editor=Marilynn Desmond|title=Christine de Pizan and the Categories of Difference|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oY9LHLWTR9sC&amp;pg=PA227|series=Medieval Cultures|volume=14|year=1998|publisher=U of Minnesota P|isbn=9780816630806|pages=236–56|chapter=The Reconstruction of an Author in Print: Christine de Pizan in the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==

===Female agency===
Scholars have recognized de Pizan's gendering of formerly male discourse in the ''Chemin''. According to Mary Weitzel Gibbons, this appropriation take place in the text as well as its accompanying illustrations. In the text, de Pizan takes the place of Dante, while the Sibyl takes the place of Virgil, replacing two male authorities by two female ones. In the illustrations, a similar replacement is shown: "every illumination of the ''Chemin'' portrays the Sibyl and Christine and thereby fixes female agency in the realm of interpretation and authority".&lt;ref name=gibbons&gt;{{cite book|last=Gibbons|first=Mary Weitzel|editor=Marilynn Desmond|title=Christine de Pizan and the Categories of Difference|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=04bV9xgrLl4C&amp;pg=PA128|series=Medieval Cultures|volume=14|year=1998|publisher=U of Minnesota P|isbn=9780816630806|pages=128–45|chapter=The ''Bath of the Muses'' and Visual Allegory in the ''Chemin de long estude''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reception of authority===
Besides appropriating some of Dante's authority, the ''Chemin'' also leans on [[Ovid]]; the illustration of the Bath of the Muses, for example, comes from the ''[[Ovide Moralisé]]'', which had derived it from book 5 of the ''[[Metamorphoses]]''. But where Christine's text does not stray far from the ''Ovide'', focusing on the purity of the water (which flows from [[Mount Helicon]], presided over by [[Apollo]], and thus a site of male authority), the image puts the Christine figure and the Sibyl, as well as the female muses, front and center.&lt;ref name=gibbons/&gt;

'''Letras y figuras''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]], "letters and figures"), is a [[Genre art|genre]] of [[painting]] pioneered by [[José Honorato Lozano]] during the [[History of the Philippines (1521–1898)|Spanish colonial period in the Philippines]]. The art form is distinguished by the depiction of letters of the [[alphabet]] using a genre of painting that contoured shapes of human figures, animals, plants, and other objects called [[Tipos del Pais]] popularized by [[Damián Domingo]]. The letters depicted spell out a phrase or a name, usually that of the [[Patronage|patron]] who commissioned the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Blanco | first =John D. | title =Frontier Constitutions: Christianity and Colonial Empire in the Nineteenth-Century Philippines | publisher =[[University of California]] | year =2009 | isbn =978-0-520-25519-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The paintings were done with [[watercolor]] on [[Manila paper]]. The earliest example of this art form dates from 1845; the latest existing specimens were completed during the latter portion of the American period in the 1930s during the administration of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]].&lt;ref name=ecapz&gt;{{cite web | title =Letras Y Figuras Uniquely Filipino Art Genre | url=https://knoji.com/letras-y-figuras-uniquely-filipino-art-genre | accessdate = 20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The BALVINO MAURICIO was completed by José Honorato Lozano in November 1864 for its namesake, Balvino Mauricio, a [[Binondo]] merchant who was later implicated in the [[1872 Cavite mutiny]].

==History==
On May 8, 1902, the Actors Fund opened a home for retired entertainers on [[Staten Island]], a [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]].

In 1928, the [[Government of New York City|New York City government]] took the property using [[eminent domain]] to enlarge an adjacent city park. That year, the residents were moved to the former mansion of American businesswoman [[Hetty Green]] in Englewood.&lt;ref name=fund/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=New Jersey –  A Guide to the State |author=Westergaard, Barbara |page=95 |location = New Brunswick, New Jersey | publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]] |year=2006 | isbn = 978-0-813-51242-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mansion was razed in 1959, and a modern facility was erected in 1961.

In 1975, the facility was merged with the Percy Williams Home on [[Long Island]], New York.

The facilities were expanded in 1988 with a 50-bed [[nursing home]]. In the same year, the [[Edwin Forrest]] wing was created at the nursing home after a merger with the Edwin Forrest Home in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].

In 1993, a wing was named in honor of actress [[Natalie Schafer]], notable for her role as [[Lovey Howell|Eunice "Lovey" Wentworth Howell]] on the television [[sitcom]] ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'' (1964&amp;ndash;1967), who left $1.5 million to the Actors Fund after her death.&lt;ref name=fund/&gt;

In 2003, it was named in honor of Lillian Booth, a philanthropist who donated $2 million to the facility.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, Andrew H. (November 5, 1991).

Retrieved August 17, 2012.  "The home here was renamed for the philanthropist Lillian Booth just last spring, after she presented it a $2 million gift.

}}
'''Ludovic-Napoléon Lepic''' (17 December 1839 &amp;ndash; 27 October 1889) was a French artist, archaeologist and patron of the arts. He was styled as ''Vicomte Lepic'' until his father's death in 1875, when he succeeded to the title of ''Comte Lepic''. He is best remembered today as a friend of [[Edgar Degas]], who included him in some eleven paintings and pastels. He was among the original [[Impressionist]] group and later became a recognised marine painter.

==Life and career==
Lepic was the grandson of the Napoleonic general [[Louis Lepic]], from whom the [[comital title]] had descended. His father was Louis-Joseph-Napoléon Lepic (1810–1875), who had a distinguished military career and was a close supporter of [[Napoléon III]]. 

Destined for a similar career, Ludovic persuaded his father to allow him to train as a painter instead, originally with [[Gustave Wappers]], the official painter of the Belgian king, and later with the animal painter [[Charles Verlat]], who encouraged him to take up etching. Much of Lepic’s early work was in this genre, and he joined the ''Société des aquafortistes'' in 1862. The following year, he gained notability for his sentimental etching ''For the poor'',&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Fichier:Ludovic Lepic - For the Poor.jpg|Wikimedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; after which he undertook further training from [[Charles Gleyre]] and the academic artist [[Alexandre Cabanel]].

During the next few years, he took up archaeology and between 1869&amp;ndash;76 was a member of the ''Société d’anthropologie de Paris''. In 1872, he founded a museum at [[Aix-les-Bains]] and published a ground-breaking illustrated work on prehistoric tools, ''Les armes et les outils préhistoriques reconstitués''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmlisieux.com/curiosa/lepic000.htm|title=L.-N. Lepic : Les Armes et les outils préhistoriques reconstitués (1872)|work=bmlisieux.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; His experiments with etching during this time were equally innovative, and he developed the technique of ‘variable etching’ (''eau-forte mobile'') where, by varying the ink on the plate, he was able to produce individual results at each printing.&lt;ref&gt;William Jung, History of the Monotype [https://web.archive.org/web/20040612091026/http://waterbasedinks.com/newsletters/newsletterhist.html June1996] ; view also the varied effects of his [http://histoire.andresy.free.fr/lepic-eau%20forte.htm Lake of Nemi] series&lt;/ref&gt; He was to teach this technique to his old friend [[Edgar Degas]] and the two co-operated on, and duly signed, Degas' large monotype ''The ballet master'' of 1874, now in the [[National Gallery of Art, Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov/feature/artnation/degas/danceportfolio_3.shtm|title=The Dance Lesson by Edgar Degas|work=nga.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lepic and Degas were friends as young men, with similar interests, and were to co-operate in other ways too.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey Buchanan, “Edgar Degas and Ludovic Lepic”, Cleveland Studies in the History of Art 2, 1997, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/20079691 p. 32]&lt;/ref&gt; It was Degas who persuaded Lepic to help plan and participate in the first two Impressionist exhibitions, but insistence by the group that he should not exhibit at the same time in the official [[:fr:Salon de peinture et de sculpture|Salon]] led Lepic to distance himself from them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abcgallery.com/D/degas/degas36.html|title=Edgar Degas. Place de la Concorde - Olga's Gallery|work=abcgallery.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, he had bought himself a boat and from 1877 paid annual visits to the town of [[Berck]], south of Le Touquet, which was an artistic haven also for other artists on the fringes of Impressionism, such as [[Édouard Manet]] and [[Eugène Boudin]]. It is for his depictions of the beach and fishing boats there that Lepic is particularly remembered as a painter today.&lt;ref&gt;See selections at [http://www.mincoin.com/infos/musee-archive-janvier-07.php  Artnet], [http://www.galeriearyjan.com/oeuvres/19eme/ludovic-napoleon-lepic the Ary Jan Gallery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823002300/http://www.galeriearyjan.com/oeuvres/19eme/ludovic-napoleon-lepic |date=2011-08-23 }} and [http://popartmachine.com/item/pop_art/FASF-FASF.64475/LUDOVIC-NAPOL&amp;EACUTE;ON-LEPIC-BOATS-ON-THE-BEACH-AT-BERCK-CIRCA-1876 San Francisco Museum] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120715100023/http://popartmachine.com/item/pop_art/FASF-FASF.64475/LUDOVIC-NAPOL&amp;EACUTE;ON-LEPIC-BOATS-ON-THE-BEACH-AT-BERCK-CIRCA-1876 |date=2012-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1883, he achieved recognition by being appointed an official [[Peintre de la Marine|marine painter]] by the state, following his growing popularity after the award of a medal at the 1877 Salon. In 1879, he had a large individual exhibition of some 100 pictures at the Gallery “La vie moderne” and in 1883, he exhibited 150 at the [[Musée des Arts Décoratifs, Paris|Musée des Arts décoratifs]]. In between, he had published an illustrated account of an archaeological trip to Egypt, ''La dernière Egypte'' (1881).

[[File:Lepic bateau cassé.jpg|thumb|Lepic's painting of "The Smashed Boat" was one of the medal-winners at the 1877 Salon]] 
The appearance of Lepic in several works by Degas records some of the enthusiasms they had in common. These included horse racing and Degas' ''Gentlemen’s race: Before the start'' (1862; [[Musée d’Orsay]]) pictures Lepic mounted among the jockeys.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artclon.com/OtherFile/The_Gentlemens_Race_Before_the_Start_1862.jpeg View online]&lt;/ref&gt; Ballet was another enthusiasm.  Lepic is shown gazing through [[opera glasses]] in ''The ballet from Robert le Diable'' (1871; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York]]), one of Degas’ earliest treatments of the subject,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/29.100.552|title=Edgar Degas: The Ballet from Robert le Diable (29.100.552) - Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History - The Metropolitan Museum of Art|work=metmuseum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in quarter profile from behind in the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]]’s larger copy  (1876).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O17815/oil-painting-the-ballet-scene-from-meyerbeers|title=The Ballet Scene from Meyerbeer's Opera Robert Le Diable|work=vam.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Lepic’s fondness for dogs, evidenced by his many etchings, resulted in Degas’ final pastel of Lepic holding one in the Cleveland Museum of Art (1889).&lt;ref&gt;[http://dreamdogsart.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c192953ef0134836a181e970c-pi View online]&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, he had included another dog in the amusing ''[[Place de la Concorde (painting)|Place de la Concorde]]'', in which the elegantly dressed and cigar-smoking Lepic strides to the right, an umbrella under his arm, while his two daughters and the dog all face the other way. Earlier still, the daughters appeared on either side of their father in the intimate painting ''[[Count Lepic and His Daughters|Ludovic Lepic and His Daughters]]'' (1871).

Notwithstanding his marriage in 1865 with Joséphine Scévole de Barral, the mother of these daughters, Lepic was later to take the [[prima ballerina]] [[Marie Sanlaville]] as his mistress and designed dresses for the ballets in which she danced, including the Harlequin costume for ''Les Jumeaux de Bergame''. Degas was also to sketch this while it was in rehearsal in 1885. In 1889, he was suddenly taken ill, and Marie Sanlaville cared for him at her apartment until his death in October. He was then interred in the vault of the family property at [[:fr:Andrésy|Andrésy]].

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Marsh with Water Lilies''}}
'''''Marsh with Water Lilies''''' is a drawing by [[Vincent van Gogh]]. It was executed at Etten (now [[Etten-Leur]]) in June 1881.

Vincent's father Theodorus van Gogh, a pastor, was called to Etten in 1875. Vincent spent periods of time there, notably from Easter to Christmas 1881 when he returned to join his brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]], an art dealer, determined to become an artist. This period at Etten represents the beginning proper of Vincent's ten-year career as an artist. He had drawn since boyhood, and the previous year had enrolled in a beginners' class in Brussels where he met the painter [[Anthon van Rappard]], but he now began to draw in earnest. He rapidly developed an accomplished technique in landscape drawing but remained rather more uncertain in his figure drawing, which he practiced assiduously with the aid of [[Charles Bargue]]'s drawing course.&lt;ref&gt;Hulsker pp. 13-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Rappard made a twelve-day visit during this time, and they sketched together in the marshes and heaths round Etten. Vincent also visited his cousin-in-law [[Anton Mauve]] in [[The Hague]], a celebrated artist of the time, who had expressed an interest in his drawings and who encouraged him  further. At this time Vincent had not progressed as far as painting, though he did wash some of his drawings with watercolor. At the end of the year he made an extended visit to Mauve, who introduced him to painting. He returned to Etten with the intention of setting up a studio there. However he quarreled with his father on Christmas Day and left the family home to set up his studio in [[The Hague]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;Naifeh and White Smith pp. 230-52.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The drawing was in the holdings of Vincent's sister [[Wil van Gogh|Wil]] who left Etten in June 1881 to take up a position as a governess in Amsterdam. At the same time there is a mention in a letter to Theo of Vincent making a pen drawing in the Passievaart marshes of lilies during an excursion with Anthon van Rappard, who was visiting. It is reasonable to suppose he gave this drawing as a leaving gift to Wil, thus  dating the drawing as around 13 June 1881 from van Rappard's own date for his Passievaart drawing.&lt;ref&gt;Hulsker, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group= "Letters"&gt;{{cite web|title= Letter 168 to Theo van Gogh. Etten, end of June 1881|url= http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let168/letter.html|work= Vincent van Gogh: The Letters|publisher=[[Van Gogh Museum]]|at= 1r:1|quote= I must tell you that Rappard was here for 12 days or so, and has now left. Naturally he sends you his regards.&lt;br&gt;We went on a fair number of excursions together, several times to the heath at Seppe, among other places, and the so-called Passievaart, a huge marsh. There Rappard painted a large study (1 metre x 50 cm), much of which was good. Incidentally, he made around 10 small sepias, also in the Liesbos.&lt;br&gt;While he was painting I made a pen drawing of another spot in the marsh where many water lilies grow.

== Early life and education ==
After completing her service in the [[Israel Defense Forces|Israeli Defence Forces]], Michal left Israel in the mid 1990s and travelled to [[Paris]] to take foundational art courses, while being homeless for a period of time. She settled in [[London]] in 1997, where she pursued her Bachelor of Arts in Fine Art from [[Central Saint Martin’s College of Art and Design|Central Saint Martin’s College of Art &amp; Design]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://young-masters.co.uk/2014/10/17/shortlisted-artist-michal-cole-tells-us-more-about-her-work/|title=Shortlisted artist Michal Cole tells us more about her work...|last=|first=|date=|website=Young Masters|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. While attending university she created a number of works in which she used fragments of real money. A group of bankers were interested in buying many of her works and ended up becoming inappropriately sexual in their language with her. After they gave her their ties after believing she was flirting with them, she used them as inspiration and materials for her 2017 [[Venice Biennale]] Pavilion of Humanity exhibition ''Top Gun.''&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/may/11/hot-under-the-collar-venice-biennale-artist-uses-27000-neckties-for-installation|title=Hot under the collar: Venice Biennale artist uses 27,000 neckties for installation|last=Ellis-Petersen|first=Hannah|date=2017-05-11|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cole later completed her Master of Art in Fine Art from [[Chelsea College of Arts]] at the [[University of the Arts London]] in 2013.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Artistic career ==

=== Textiles ===
In Michal Cole’s textile pieces ''Inferno'', 2013 and ''Clamare'', 2013, Cole referenced famous art pieces such as [[Sandro Botticelli]]'s ''Mappa dell’Inferno'' and [[Edvard Munch]]'s ''[[The Scream]]'' with lavish colours and cheerful compositions through textiles. She attempted to bring religious figurative paintings back to life through the more contemporary medium of tapestry that more accurately depicted current views and beliefs as a reflection of society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Exhibited at the 2017 Venice Biennale, Michal Cole created a work titled ''Top Gun'' in the Pavilion of Humanity, which was made of tens of thousands of used men’s ties including those of men she knew and men who had either harassed her or her friends. The ties were strenuously tied together to cover the floor, walls, a fireplace, a sofa, a pipe, a mounted moose on the wall and a rifle which all encompass a traditionally masculine styled living room. Ties were specifically chosen as they represent a piece of clothing typically worn by men for historically masculine activities such as boardroom and workplace life, witnessing business deals, hiring employees, and winding down at a pub. Cole’s intention of the subject was to comment on the oppression of women that is more apparent under [[Donald Trump]]’s government than ever before; including issues such as the [[gender pay gap]], [[sexual harassment]] and a predominantly male political office. The piece similarly spoke to personal inequalities that were apparent in Cole’s life, such as her being a victim of sexual abuse, serving mandatory time in the military where hundreds of cases of sexual assault are disregarded, and her grandmother being a child bride.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Michal Cole’s use of textiles has been exhibited in pieces such as ''After Caravaggio'' and ''Roses'' in a process where she replicated famous paintings and destroyed them before the paint had dried. The pieces were later transformed in to fabric textiles, which involved mapping out and recreating the paintings with materials such as Tibetan highland wool, Bikaner wool, Chinese silk and nettle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hamhigh.co.uk/property/michal-cole-knots-rugs-interview-1-5473924|title='It was a marriage made in heaven' - Michal Cole on working with Knots Rugs|last=McFadyen|first=Alex|work=Hampstead Highgate Express|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Installation art ===

==== ''Mute-Ululation'' ====
Michal Cole exhibited a site-specific video installation at Ex Bazzi Gallery at the 2015 Venice Biennale’s Pavilion of Humanity titled ''Mute-Ululation.'' This work addresses Cole’s identity as a resident of England who is of [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] ethnicity. For this installation, Michal travelled to Morocco and Israel and filmed women’s mouths while performing the traditional celebratory [[ululation]]: a long, repetitive, high-pitched vocal sound that involves the rapid movement of the tongue side to side in the mouth. On three walls in a darkened room, the videos of these women assemble frame-by-frame until there are hundreds of mouths simultaneously performing the ululation at a loud volume. This work was used to showcase a unifying bond amongst women that transcends geographical borders, religions and ideologies, while empowering these women and showcasing their poetic happiness and expression. It similarly is a piece in which Cole grapples with her own identity as having significant elements of her life that are tied in Middle-Eastern and [[Moroccan culture]] while having adopted aspects of [[Western culture]] due to living in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.artlyst.com/news/michal-cole-presents-ululation-video-installation-at-venice-biennale/|title=Michal Cole Presents Ululation Video Installation At Venice Biennale - Artlyst|work=Artlyst|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Objection'' ====
After numerous visits to [[Istanbul]], Michal Cole met Ekin Onat, a [[Turkish Muslims|Turkish Muslim]] artist who addresses female and political issues of contemporary [[Turkey]]. The two staged their joint project ''Objection'' in the Pavilion of Humanity at the 2017 Venice Biennale. The project revolved around the notion of the home, based on their independent yet complementary artistic interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artlyst.com/reviews/pavilion-humanity-objection-exhibited-venice-biennale/|title=Pavilion of Humanity Where Objection is Exhibited At The Venice Biennale|last=|first=|date=|website=Artlyst|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhibition, which featured a number of rooms in an artificial home included Cole’s textile room ''Top Gun and'' raised the question of the role of arts and culture in times of crisis, political upheaval and change while uniformly making an argument of compassion and non-violent protest.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.itsliquid.com/the-pavilion-of-humanity-objection.html|title=The Pavilion of Humanity – OBJECTION|date=2017-07-17|work=ITSLIQUID GROUP - Official website|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both women transformed the Venetian villa “to give an artistic home to women’s rights and free speech.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1992618197?accountid=6180|title=April 11, 2017 (Page SS1-14)|last=|first=|date=April 11, 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=October 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the numerous rooms in the home, both artists contemplate with political oppression and the power of speech, which is shown in Cole’s ''Domestic Godless,'' a video installation in the kitchen which showcased different videos coming from screens inside cups, bowls and teapots, in which the subject is shown to be screaming. The videos are meant to be representative of a time in Cole’s life where she was left ‘howling like an injured dog’ and addresses the role of women across all planes of human existence. Specifically it showcases how inner frustrations at unrealistic pressures are universally placed upon women, such as being beautiful, smart, maternal, and sexual. In the traditionally feminized location of the kitchen, the screams and female outrage can be heard coming from the videos, giving the voice to the woman, where she would have traditionally taken on a role of servitude.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The upper floor of the home held collaborative works by the two artists titled ''The Journey Between Human Being'' and ''Being Human.'' Voices could be heard coming from behind a locked door and when the listener approached the keyhole in an attempt to get the clearest sound, the voices became increasingly overlapped making it apparent that different languages were being spoken between the women. The themes of speaking and silence continued in the master bedroom, where ''Absent Presence'' is a life-like model of the artist sitting with their backs facing one-another on the bed.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Awards and honours ==
Apart from showcasing work twice at the Venice Biennale, in 2015 and 2017, as well as exhibiting in [[Sotheby's|Sotheby’s]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Michal Cole has exhibited her work worldwide to much acclaim. She is the winner of the My Art Space Scope Miami competition, the 2011 Signature Art Awards, the [[Saatchi Gallery]]’s Showdown competition award in London.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Personal life ==
After visiting London as a teenager, Cole built a group titled the ''Heavy Metalists'' in [[Tel Aviv]] which took over nightclubs and formed a mini revolution of anarchy and mayhem. The intention of the group was to challenge existing local beliefs, views, fashion and musical tastes by communicating new ideas of freedom, specifically artistic freedom, atheism and passion for challenging conformity. The group, led by Cole until the age of 18, grew in popularity and was featured in mainstream media. After running away to Paris when she was 17 in an attempt to avoid recruitment, Cole was recruited at age 18 to the Israeli Defense Forces to serve mandatory military service.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Michal Cole’s parents are [[Moroccan Jews]] who trace their roots back to the [[Jews of Spain]] who migrated to Morocco after the [[Spanish Inquisition]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Her parents [[Migration of Moroccan Jews to Israel|left Morocco]] in the early 1950s, being deported by sea to Israel where they were placed in refugee camps and suffered poverty and racial discrimination as a new minority in Israel.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Much of Cole’s work involves the notions of displacement and exile – both internal and external. Due to the merging of her Moroccan-Israeli ethnicity and adopted Western cultural aspects, she explores the collisions of tradition and modernity while similarly delving in to the roles of women and the absurdity of global inequality in her work.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Michal Cole uses her artworks as a form of celebration and examination of the human condition while inviting the viewer to contemplate the beauty, joy, and humour of life set against the uncontrollable social, economic, political and religious injustices and hypocrisies that inevitably affect us. She is specifically fascinated by moments of transition – economical transitions, religious shifts, the collapse of beliefs and infrastructures and loss of faith. Cole attempts to envision the possibility of order born from chaos and mayhem, creativity out of destruction and inspiration derived from man’s fallibility and stupidity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The artist Cole is most inspired by is [[Caravaggio]] due to his rebelliousness and insanity, and the eroticism, drama and violence of his work. She spent a summer touring [[Italy]] in search of his original artworks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Neo-Tiwanakan''' or Pseudo-Tiwanakan [[architecture]] is a style developed by the architect [[Emilio Villanueva|Emilio Villanueva Peñaranda]] between the years 1930 and 1948 inspired in the designs of the [[Pre-Columbian]] archeological site of [[Tiwanaku]] in [[Bolivia]].&lt;ref name="SocArq"&gt;{{cite book |author=Browman, David   |title=La Sociedad arqueológica de Bolivia y su influencia en el desarrollo de la práctica arqueológica en Bolivia |trans-title=The archeological society of Bolivia and its influence in the development of the archeological practice in Bolivia |url=http://www.arqueobolivia.com/revistas/23_51_32-1222738970.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=1 February 2010 |series=Nuevos Aportes |volume=4 |year=2007 |location=La Paz, Bolivia |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GuiaLP"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Pérez, Martín   |author2=Boero Rojo, Hugo |author3=de la Riva, Miroslava |editor=Unión  de Ciudades Capitales Iberoamericanas |title=Guía de La Paz |trans-title=La Paz guide |url=https://books.google.com/?id=D3e7AAAAIAAJ |series=Guías UCCI |volume=13 |year=1990 |publisher= |location=Madrid, Spain |language=Spanish |isbn=978-84-87771-02-6 |oclc=433846494 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The architect Emilio Villanueva popularized the Neo-Tiwanakan architecture in the city of [[La Paz]] during the decade of the 1930s. The inspiration for these designs was the blueprints for ideal reconstructions of Tiwanaku elaborated by Edmund Kiss in 1937; these designs were adapted by Villanueva to give them an urban and contemporaneous style.&lt;ref name="SocArq" /&gt;

[[File:Groningenkeuring.jpg|thumb|325px|The "Paardenkeuring" (horse inspection) in Groningen (1920)]]
'''Otto Eerelman''' (23 March 1839, [[Groningen]] - 3 October 1926, Groningen) was a Dutch painter; best known for his depictions of dogs and horses. He was also a [[court painter]] and did several portraits of [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Wilhelmina]], as Princess and Queen.

== Biography ==
His father was [[Sexton (office)|sexton]] at [[Der Aa-kerk]]. He showed an early aptitude for art and, against the wishes of his parents, enrolled at the [[Academie Minerva]] in 1860, where he studied with [[Johannes Hinderikus Egenberger|J.H. Egenberger]].&lt;ref name="K"&gt;[http://www.kunstbus.nl/kunst/otto+eerelman.html Brief biography] @ Kunstbus.&lt;/ref&gt;After graduating, he spent another year at the [[Royal Academy of Fine Arts (Antwerp)]]. Later, he took private lessons in the studios of [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]].&lt;ref name="D"&gt;[http://www.dodenakkers.nl/beroemd/kunst/104-eerelman.html Brief biography] by Martin Mulder @ Dodenakkers.&lt;/ref&gt; 

After a brief stay in Paris, he returned to Groningen and worked as a teacher at the Academie from 1867 to 1874.&lt;ref name="D" /&gt; He moved to Brussels that year to establish himself as a painter but, for unknown reasons, relocated to [[The Hague]] in 1875, where he lived until 1902. It was during this time that he served as a court painter and many of his works are still to be seen in [[Het Loo]].&lt;ref name="K" /&gt; 

In 1898, an illustrated album called ''Horse Races'' was published, containing 40 lithographs of Eerelman's paintings by Richard Schoenbeck (1840-1919). It featured Queen Wilhelmina's favorite horse, "Woyko", and proved to be very popular. Later, an annotated collection of his works was translated into English by [[Clara Bell]] under the title ''Horses and Dogs''. His best known painting, "De paardenkeuring op de Grote Markt op de 28ste augustus", depicts an annual celebration (featuring horses) held to commemorate the lifting of the [[Siege of Groningen]].  

For health reasons ("rheumatic neuralgia"), he spent five years in [[Arnhem]], then went back to Groningen in 1907. At the age of eighty, he was made a [[Ridder (title)|Ridder]] and a street in Groningen was named after him.&lt;ref name="D" /&gt; It was said that one could tell when visitors to the [[Louvre]] were from Groningen because they would ask "where are the Eerelmans?".{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} He was, however, mostly forgotten by the second half of the 20th century. It is only recently that interest in his works has been revived. From April to August, 2015, a major retrospective was held at the Museum Nienoord in [[Leek, Netherlands|Leek]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumnienoord.nl/nieuws/nienoords-hommage-aan-otto-eerelman Eerelman exhibition] @ the Museum Nienoord website.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Paracas textiles''' were found at a [[necropolis]] in [[Peru]] in the 1920s. The necropolis held 420 bodies who had been [[mummified]] and wrapped in embroidered textiles in 200–300 BCE&lt;ref name="bm"/&gt; The examples in the [[British Museum]] show flying [[shaman]]s who hold severed heads by their hair.&lt;ref name="bm"/&gt;

==Description==
These textiles were made by South American people over a thousand years before the rise of the [[Inca]]. They are brightly coloured and show evidence of both a design and a style.  The subject of these images are supernatural creatures or shamans who use their hands to hold severed human heads whilst their wings transport them like birds.&lt;ref name="Proulx"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Proulx|first=Donald A.|title=A Sourcebook of Nasca Ceramic Iconography: Reading a culture through its art|publisher=University of Iowa Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-87745-979-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sjBJSTyvRywC|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; These could be intended to represent being carried to the next world by spirits or that these figures represent the spirits themselves.&lt;ref name="bm"&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/aoa/p/paracas_textile.aspx Paracas textile], British Museum, accessed 27 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The people who created these textiles had a complex society. There is evidence of pottery, fishing, and farming. There were craftspeople who could make knives from obsidian, jewellery from gold&lt;ref name="bm"/&gt; as well as understanding all the complexities of weaving.&lt;ref name="feltham"&gt;{{cite book|last=Feltham|first=Jane|title=Peruvian Textiles |pages= 46–7|year=1989|publisher=Shire Ethnography|isbn=0-7478-0014-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
The textiles were made from wool and cotton. The wool is thought to have come from [[Alpaca fiber|Alpaca]] or [[Llama]].&lt;ref name="bm"/&gt; They had been dyed with [[natural dye]]s which unusually had kept their colour after over 2,000 years. The preservation of the colours is attributed to the dry conditions combined with the lack of damage which would usually have been caused by sunlight.&lt;ref name="ahotw"/&gt;

The smaller fragments illustrated here have been taken from the large pieces of cloth&lt;ref name="ahotw"/&gt; that were used to wrap the bodies of the dead. These cloths were as long as 100 feet (34 metres) and would have required a significant organisation of a number of people to construct. The bodies were found in groups of 40 or 50 as if they were family vaults which had been used by several generations.

One of the unusual qualities of the skulls that were found is that many of them had been distorted in unusual ways. This distortion is achieved by attaching boards and weights to the skull as it grows. Other distortions are due to the process of [[trepanning]] which as where holes were drilled into the skulls of living people. Inspection shows that these holes had healed and shows that the patients did not die when this process was applied. Museums in Peru like the [[Ica, Peru|Museo Regional de Ica]] display both these skulls and the textiles that were found around them.&lt;ref name="Schlecht"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schlecht|first=Neil E.|title=Frommer's Peru |year=2010|page=154|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bbB_BBi751MC&amp;pg=PA154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
The necropolis was discovered by [[Julio C. Tello]] in the 1920s. Tello first visited the site on July 26, 1925 following a trail that had begun in 1915 when he had purchased ancient textiles in [[Pisco, Peru]].&lt;ref name="burger"/&gt; On 25 October 1927, Tello and his team uncovered the first of hundreds of ceremonial mummified bundle burials. Tello discovered a necropolis that contained corpses that were sat in baskets. Around each of the bodies were large textiles that included large woven cotton that was decorated with woollen embroidery.

A {{ill|Museo Julio C. Tello|lt=purpose built museum|es}} was built near [[Paracas (municipality)|Paracas]] at the request of [[Óscar R. Benavides|President Benevides]] who in August 1938 authorised Tello to build a museum to house the 380 textiles that Tello and his staff had preserved. They were able to put on display over 180 textiles. The preservation of these had been funded by the [[Rockefeller Foundation]].&lt;ref name="burger"&gt;{{cite book|last=Burger|first=Richard L.|title=The life and writings of Julio C. Tello: America's first indigenous archaeologist|pages=28, 38|year=2009|publisher=University of Iowa Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=75xVOiyWo4gC&amp;pg=PA56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The embroidery illustrated here are fragments from a larger piece of fabric that were removed before they were purchased by the British Museum. Today these are only shown under limited light conditions where they are held tight between a backing material and perspex.&lt;ref name="ahotw"/&gt; In 1928 they began to remove these for safe keeping.&lt;ref name="burger"/&gt;

==History of the World==
These textile pictures from the British Museum were chosen to be one of the [[A History of the World in 100 Objects|History of the World in 100 Objects]] which was a series of radio programmes that started in 2010 and that were created in a partnership between the [[BBC]] and the British Museum.&lt;ref name="ahotw"&gt;{{cite web|title=Paracas textile|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/wm8NbFLMQGGc5zX7d7mszg|work=A History of the World in 100 Objects|publisher=BBC|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4317">'''Prince Dance Group''', a [[dance troupe]] based in [[Berhampur]], [[Orissa, India]] led by T. Krishna Mohan Reddy. It has won a reality show [[India's Got Talent]] on an Indian TV channel "Colors" [[Colors (India TV channel)]]. The group is unique that the members are from a remote part of India and most of them are from disadvantaged sections of different parts of Ganjam district. Two of them, Padmanabha Sahu (24) and Telu Tarini (13) are physically challenged.&lt;ref name="TOI"/&gt; They have won the hearts of all Oriyas, including chief minister Naveen Patnaik, and even outsiders with their performance in the programme "[[India's Got Talent]]". Prince Group also performed in Sardotsav- annual winter festival in [[Pithoragarh]] ([[Uttarakhand]]) on 6 November 2014.

==The group==
After winning Rs 50 [[Indian numbering system|lakh]] (Rs five million) prize money and a [[audi]] car from the Colors channel, a pleasant surprise lay in store for them. The Orissa government announced a cash prize of Rs two [[Indian numbering system|crore]] (Rs twenty million) and four acres of land for the group to build a dance academy.

Confirming the news, Krishna Mohan Reddy, the choreographer of Prince Dance Group said, "We have heard that our government has announced a prize for us. We feel honoured. I am very happy that our efforts have paid off."

The group, which is from [[Berhampur]], [[Orissa, India|Orissa]], consists of 20 members. Krishna leads the team and the rest are labourers from a construction site. It was their Krishna act which earned the group accolades from the viewers nationwide and they also became a favourite with the judges.

Commenting on their future plans, Krishna added, “I am a choreographer and want to grow in this profession. With the land provided to us by the government I want to build a dance academy and take this art forward. I would also want to perform on an international platform.”

==India's Got Talent==
The group did an astonishing performance depicting Lord Krishna and his avatars that got good comments from all the three judges. Shekhar Kapoor was mesmerised by their performance. In their semi-final act on 15 August, they depicted the Indian Flag. The special act in which two of the group's  challenged students also performed moved the judges to tears. The audience became so involved in the act that they started chanting "Bharat mata ki jay", after the performance was over.

==World's Got Talent==
Prince Group performed in Sardotsav- annual winter festival in [[Pithoragarh]] (Uttarakhand) on 06 November 2014.
The Prince dance group will, in all probability, represent India at the global stage in the first [[World's Got Talent]] contest, which will see them competing with the 25 winners from various [[Got Talent series]] of different countries. This would be the world's biggest reality TV talent show with a proposed prize money of £1 million and an intended airdate of 2011 with [[UK]] serving as the venue.&lt;ref name="WGT"/&gt;

'''Public relations''' ('''PR''') is the practice of managing the spread of [[information]] between an individual or an [[organization]] (such as a business, government agency, or a nonprofit organization) and the [[General public|public]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Grunig|first1=James E|last2=Hunt|first2=Todd|title=Managing Public Relations|location=Orlando, FL|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|year=1984|edition= 6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public relations may include an organization or [[individual]] gaining [[publicity|exposure]] to their audiences using topics of public interest and news items that do not require direct payment.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Seitel|first=Fraser P.|title=The Practice of Public Relations. |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|publisher= Pearson Prentice Hall|year= 2007|edition= 10th}}&lt;/ref&gt; This differentiates it from [[advertising]] as a form of [[marketing communications]]. Public relations is the idea of creating coverage for clients for free, rather than [[marketing]] or advertising. But now advertising is also a part of greater PR Activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/306758|title=#10 Important Trends in PR that You Can't Afford to Ignore|last=Singh|first=Honey|date=2017-12-29|work=Entrepreneur|access-date=2018-08-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An example of good public relations would be generating an article featuring a client, rather than paying for the client to be advertised next to the article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = What You Need to Get a Job in Public Relations After College - AfterCollege|url = http://blog.aftercollege.com/2014/need-get-job-public-relations-college/#sthash.m6uq8xLi.dpuf|accessdate = 2015-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of public relations is to inform the public, prospective customers, investors, partners, employees, and other stakeholders and ultimately persuade them to maintain a positive or favorable view about the organization, its [[leadership]], products, or political decisions. Public relations professionals typically work for PR and marketing firms, [[businesses]] and [[companies]], [[government]], and [[official|public officials]] as [[public information officer|PIOs]] and [[nongovernmental organizations]], and [[nonprofit organizations]].

Public relations specialists establish and maintain relationships with an organisation's target [[audience]], the [[mass media|media]], relevant trade media, and other [[opinion leadership|opinion leaders]]. Common responsibilities include designing communications campaigns, writing [[press release|news releases]] and other content for [[news]], working with the [[News media|press]], arranging interviews for company spokespeople, writing [[speech]]es for company leaders, acting as an organisation's [[spokesperson]], preparing clients for [[press conferences]], media interviews and speeches, writing [[website]] and [[social media]] content, managing company reputation ([[crisis management]]), managing [[internal communications]],  and marketing activities like brand awareness and event management &lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last= Rubel|first= Gina F.|title= Everyday Public Relations for Lawyers|location=Doylestown, PA|edition=  1st|year= 2007|isbn= 978-0-9801719-0-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Success in the field of public relations requires a deep understanding of the interests and concerns of each of the company's many stakeholders.

== Definitions ==
[[Ivy Lee]], the man who turned around the [[Rockefeller]] name and image, and his friend, [[Edward Bernays|Edward Louis Bernays]], established the first definition of public relations in the early 1900s as follows: "a management function, which tabulates public attitudes, defines the policies, procedures and interests of an organization... followed by executing a program of action to earn public understanding and acceptance."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DdhyJ_n1HFkC&amp;pg=PR17&amp;lpg=PR17&amp;dq=a+management+function,+which+tabulates+public+attitudes,+defines+the+policies,+procedures+and+interests+of+an+organization...+followed+by+executing+a+program+of+action+to+earn+public+understanding+and+acceptance.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tyoaqRfdcA&amp;sig=fyUEmNuDbztwXb891AgOkadYm3U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi71fbm2fTRAhVDylQKHajTAggQ6AEILTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=a%20management%20function,%20which%20tabulates%20public%20attitudes,%20defines%20the%20policies,%20procedures%20and%20interests%20of%20an%20organization...%20followed%20by%20executing%20a%20program%20of%20action%20to%20earn%20public%20understanding%20and%20acceptance.&amp;f=false|title=PR 2.0: New Media, New Tools, New Audiences|last=Breakenridge|first=Deirdre|date=2008-03-26|publisher=FT Press|isbn=9780132703970|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when Lee was later asked about his role in a hearing with the [[United Transit Commission]], he said "I have never been able to find a satisfactory phrase to describe what I do."&lt;ref name="twoway"/&gt; In 1948, historian Eric Goldman noted that the definition of public relations in Webster's would be "disputed by both practitioners and critics in the field."&lt;ref name="twoway"&gt;{{cite book

According to Bernays, the public relations counsel is the agent working with both modern media of communications and group formations of society in order to provide ideas to the public’s consciousness. Furthermore, he is also concerned with ideologies and courses of actions as well as material goods and services and public utilities and industrial associations and large trade groups for which it secures popular support.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Bernays, "The New Propagandists," in Propaganda, (New York: H. Liverlight, 1928), 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1978, the World Assembly of Public Relations Associations defined the field as &lt;blockquote&gt;"the art and [[social science]] of analyzing [[fad|trends]], predicting their consequences, counseling organizational leaders and implementing planned programs of action, which will serve both the organization and the [[public interest]]."&lt;ref&gt;Jensen Zhao.

In 2011 and 2012, the PRSA solicited crowd supplied definitions for the term and allowed the public to vote on one of three finalists. The winning definition stated that: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Public relations is a strategic communication process that builds mutually beneficial relationships between organizations and their publics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/02/business/media/public-relations-a-topic-that-is-tricky-to-define.html |author= Stuart Elliot| title=Public Relations Defined, After an Energetic Public Discussion|date=March 1, 2012|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Public relations can also be defined as the practice of managing [[communication]] between an organization and its publics.&lt;ref&gt;Grunig, James E. and Hunt, Todd. Managing Public Relations. (Orlando, FL: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1984), 6e. Public relations is what you do with what you know and what other think about what you say.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of public relations}}
Public relations is not a phenomenon of the 20th century, but rather has historical roots. Most textbooks consider the establishment of the Publicity Bureau in 1900 to be the founding of the public relations profession. However, academics have found early forms of public influence and communications management in ancient civilizations, during the settling of the [[New World]] and during the movement to abolish slavery in England. Basil Clark is considered the founder of public relations in the [[United Kingdom]] for his establishment of Editorial Services in 1924.

Propaganda was used by the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and others to rally for domestic support and demonize enemies during the World Wars, which led to more sophisticated commercial publicity efforts as public relations talent entered the private sector. Most historians believe public relations became established first in the US by [[Ivy Lee]] or [[Edward Bernays]], then spread internationally. Many American companies with PR departments spread the practice to Europe when they created European subsidiaries as a result of the [[Marshall plan]].

The second half of the 1900s is considered the professional development building era of public relations. Trade associations, PR news magazines, international PR agencies, and academic principles for the profession were established. In the early 2000s, press release services began offering social media press releases. [[The Cluetrain Manifesto]], which predicted the effect of social media in 1999, was controversial in its time, but by 2006, the effect of social media and new internet technologies became broadly accepted.

== Tactics ==
Public relations professionals present the face of an organization or individual, usually to articulate its objectives and official views on issues of relevance, primarily to the media. Public relations contributes to the way an organization is perceived by influencing the media and maintaining relationships with stakeholders. According to Dr. Jacquie L’Etang from Queen Margaret University, public relations professionals can be viewed as "discourse workers specializing in communication and the presentation of argument and employing [[rhetorical]] strategies to achieve managerial aims."&lt;ref name="L'Etang2004"&gt;{{cite book|first=Jacquie|last=L'Etang|title=Public Relations in Britain: A History of Professional Practice in the Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hEuTTo4lpTYC|accessdate=22 May 2013|date=2 September 2004|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-4106-1081-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific public relations disciplines include:
* Financial public relations – communicating financial results and business strategy
* [[Consumer]]/[[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] public relations – gaining publicity for a particular product or service
* [[Crisis communication]] – responding in a crisis
* [[Internal communications]] – communicating within the company itself
* [[Government relations]] – engaging government departments to influence public policy
* [[Media relations]] – a public relations function that involves building and maintaining close relationships with the news media so that they can sell and promote a business.
*Celebrity public relations− promotion of a celebrity to various media publications and outlets 
*In-house public relations – maintaining communication between entertainment networks/production companies and the media
* Food-centric relations – communicating specific information centered on foods, beverages and wine.

Building and managing relationships with those who influence an organization or individual’s audiences has a central role in doing public relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=David|last=Phillips|year=2006|title=Towards relationship management: Public relations at the core of organizational development|journal=Journal of Communication Management|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kamau, C. (2009) [http://www.igi-global.com/bookstore/Chapter.aspx?TitleId=36662 Strategising impression management in corporations: cultural knowledge as capital]. In D. Harorimana (Ed) Cultural implications of knowledge sharing, management and transfer: identifying competitive advantage. Chapter 4. Information Science Reference. {{ISBN|978-1-60566-790-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a public relations practitioner has been working in the field, they accumulate a list of relationships that become an asset, especially for those in media relations.

Within each discipline, typical activities include [[pseudo-event|publicity events]], speaking opportunities, [[press releases]], [[newsletters]], [[blog]]s, [[social media]], press kits, and outbound communication to members of the press. Video and audio news releases (VNRs and ANRs) are often produced and distributed to TV outlets in hopes they will be used as regular program content.

=== Audience targeting ===
A fundamental technique used in public relations is to identify the [[target audience]] and to tailor messages to be relevant to each audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Target audience|title=Key concepts in public relations|page=227|first1=Bob|last1=Franklin|first2=Mike|last2=Hogan|first3=Quentin|last3=Langley|first4=Nick|last4=Mosdell|first5=Elliot|last5=Pill|publisher=SAGE|isbn=978-1-4129-2318-7|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the interests of differing audiences and stakeholders common to a public relations effort necessitate the creation of several distinct but complementary messages. These messages however should be relevant to each other, thus creating a consistency to the overall message and theme. Audience targeting tactics are important for public relations practitioners because they face all kinds of problems: low visibility, lack of public understanding, opposition from critics, and insufficient support from funding sources.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Ronald D. Strategic Planning for Public Relations. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 2002. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]] theory identifies people who have a stake in a given institution or issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Stakeholder Approach Revisited|first=R Edward|last=Freeman|year=2004|publisher=Rainer Hampp Verlag|volume=5|issue=3|journal=Zeitschrift für Wirtschafts- und Unternehmensethik}}&lt;/ref&gt; All audiences are stakeholders (or presumptive stakeholders), but not all stakeholders are audiences. For example, if a charity commissions a public relations agency to create an advertising campaign to raise money to find a cure for a disease, the [[charitable organization|charity]] and the people with the disease are stakeholders, but the audience is anyone who is likely to donate money. Public relations experts possess deep skills in media relations, market positioning, and branding. They are powerful agents that help clients deliver clear, unambiguous information to a target audience that matters to them.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, Mark. "Climate Change and Public Relations."

=== The Publics in Public Relations ===
The public is any group whose members have a common interest or common values in a particular subject, such as political party. Those members would then be considered stakeholders, which are people who have a stake or an interest in an organization or issue that potentially involves the organization or group they're interested in. The Publics in Public Relations are:

-'''''Traditional Publics''''': Groups with which you have an on-going and long term relationship with, this may include; Employees, Media, Governments, Investors, and Customers&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/660088137|title=Public relations : a values-driven approach|last=David.|first=Guth,|date=2012|publisher=Allyn &amp; Bacon|others=Marsh, Charles, 1955-|isbn=9780205811809|edition= 5th|location=Boston|oclc=660088137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

-'''''Non-Traditional Publics''''': Groups that are typically unfamiliar with your organization and you have not had a relationship with but may become traditional publics due to changes in the organization, in society or if a group changing event occurs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

-'''''Latent Publics''''': A group whose values have come into contact with the values of your organization but whose members haven't yet realized it; the members of that public are not yet aware of the relationship.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

-'''''Aware Publics''''': A group of members who are aware of the existence of a commonality of values or interests with your organization, but have not organized or attempted to respond to that commonality.

-'''''Intervening Publics''''': Any public that helps you send a message to another public, could be the media or someone with stature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

-'''''Primary Publics:''''' If a public can directly affect your organization's pursuit of its values-driven goals. This publics would include media, employees, government, shareholder, financial institutions, and the immediate community.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

-'''''Secondary Publics''''': Have high interest in the company such as the primary publics but will not be directly affected by decisions of the organization.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

-'''''Internal Publics''''': People within your organization&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

-'''''External Publics''''': People outside of your organization&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

-'''''Domestic Publics''''': Those within your country&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''-International Publics''''': Those outside of your country and when communicating with this publics you must be weary of that areas culture, beliefs, values, ethic, and other valuable cultural difference as to not offend anyone.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Messaging ===
Messaging is the process of creating a consistent story around: a product, person, company, or service. Messaging aims to avoid having readers receive contradictory or confusing information that will instill doubt in their purchasing choices, or other decisions that affect the company. Brands aim to have the same problem statement, industry viewpoint, or brand perception shared across sources and media.

=== Social media marketing ===
{{Main|Digital marketing}}
Digital marketing is the use of [[Internet]] tools and technologies such as [[search engines]], Web 2.0 social bookmarking, [[new media]] relations, [[blogging]], and [[social media marketing]]. Interactive PR allows companies and organizations to disseminate information without relying solely on mainstream publications and communicate directly with the public, customers and prospects.

PR practitioners have always relied on the media  such as TV, radio, and magazines, to promote their ideas and messages tailored specifically to a target audience. Social media marketing is not only a new way to achieve that goal, it is also a continuation of a strategy that existed for decades. Lister et al. said that "Digital media can be seen as a continuation and extension of a principal or technique that was already in place".&lt;ref&gt;Lister, M., Dovey, J., Giddings, S., Grant, I., &amp; Kelly, K. (2009). New media: A critical introduction. (2nd ed.). New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
PR professionals are well aware of the fact that digital technology is used in a practically different way than before. For instance, cellphones are no longer just devices we use to talk to one another. They are also used for online shopping, dating, learning and getting the most up to date news around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Tapscott, D. (2009). Grown up digital: How the net generation is changing your world. New York: McGraw hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

As digital technology has evolved, the methods to measure effective online public relations effectiveness have improved. The Public Relations Society of America, which has been developing PR strategies since 1947, identified 5 steps to measure online public relations effectiveness. 
# ''Engagement'': Measure the number of people who engaged with an item (social shares, likes and comments). 
# ''Impressions'': Measure the number of people who may have viewed an item.
# ''Items'': Measure any content (blog posts, articles, etc.) that originally appeared as digital media.
# ''Mentions'': Measure how many online items mention the brand, organization, or product.
# ''Reach'': Measure how far the PR campaign managed to penetrate overall and in terms of a particular audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prsa.org/Intelligence/BusinessCase/MeasurementStandarization/#.VdZtN1WrTmE|title=PR Measurement Standardization: Moving Toward Industry Agreement: PRSA|first=Arthur|last=Yann|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other techniques ===
[[Litigation public relations]] is the management of the communication process during the course of any legal dispute or adjudicatory processing so as to affect the outcome or its effect on the client’s overall [[reputation]] (Haggerty, 2003).

== Ethics ==
Public relations professionals both serve the public's interest and private interests of businesses, associations, non-profit organizations, and governments. This dual obligation gave rise to heated debates among scholars of the discipline and practitioners over its fundamental values. This conflict represents the main ethical predicament of public relations.&lt;ref name="Carolyn Bronstein 2006"&gt;Kathy Fitzpatrick and Carolyn Bronstein, " Introduction: Towards a Definitional Framework for Responsible Advocacy," in Ethics in Public Relations, Responsible Advocacy, ed. Kathy Fitzpatrick and Carolyn Bronstein (USA: Sage Publications, Inc. 2006), ix.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the [[Public Relations Society of America]] (PRSA) responded to the controversy by acknowledging in its new code of ethics "advocacy" – for the first time – as a core value of the discipline.&lt;ref name="Carolyn Bronstein 2006"/&gt;

The field of public relations is generally highly un-regulated, but many professionals voluntarily adhere to the code of conduct of one or more professional bodies to avoid exposure for ethical violations.&lt;ref name="Marshall2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marshall|first1=Tim|title=Ethics – Who needs them?|journal=Journal of Communication Management|volume=7|issue=2|year=2002|pages=107–112|issn=1363-254X|doi=10.1108/13632540310807313}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chartered Institute of Public Relations]], the Public Relations Society of America, and The Institute of Public Relations are a few organizations that publish an ethical code. Still, [[Edelman (firm)|Edelman]]'s 2003 semi-annual trust survey found that only 20 percent of survey respondents from the public believed paid communicators within a company were credible.&lt;ref name="journal"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1108/13632540510621498|title = Can the professionalisation of the UK public relations industry make it more trustworthy?| journal=Journal of Communication Management| volume=9| pages=56–64|year = 2005|last1 = Tobin|first1 = Natasha}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public relations people are growing increasingly concerned with their company’s marketing practices, questioning whether they agree with the company’s social responsibility. They seek more influence over marketing and more of a counseling and policy-making role. On the other hand, marketing people are increasingly interested in incorporating publicity as a tool within the realm marketing.&lt;ref&gt;Kermani, Faiz and Alan Needham. Marketing and Public Relations. Marlow: Institute of Clinical Research, 2006. N. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Scott Cutlip, the social justification for public relations is the right for an organization to have a fair hearing of their point of view in the public forum, but to obtain such a hearing for their ideas requires a skilled advocate.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Scott|last=Cutlip|author-link=Scott Cutlip|year=1994|title=The Unseen Power: Public Relations: A History|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|isbn=978-0-8058-1464-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public Relation Code of Ethics: ===
The Public Relation Student Society of America has established a set of fundamental guidelines that people within the public relations professions should practice and use in their business atmosphere. These values are:

'''''Advocacy''''': Serving the public interest by acting as responsible advocates for the clientele. This can occur by displaying the marketplace of ideas, facts, and viewpoints to aid informed public debate.

'''''Honesty''''': Standing by the truth and accuracy of all facts in the case and advancing those statements to the public.

'''''Expertise''''': To become and stay informed of the specialized knowledge needed in the field of Public Relations. Taking that knowledge and improving the field through development, research, and education. Meanwhile professionals also build their understanding, credibility, and relationships to understand various audiences and industries.

'''''Independence''''': Provide unbiased work to those that are represented while being accountable for all actions.

'''''Loyalty''''': Stay devoted to your client while remembering you have a duty to still serve the public interest.

'''''Fairness''''': Honorably conduct business with any and all clients, employers, competitors, peers, vendors, media, and general public. Respecting all opinions and right of free expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.prsa.org/ethics/code-of-ethics/|title=Code of Ethics - Public Relations Society of America|work=Public Relations Society of America|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spin ===
{{Main|Spin (public relations)}}
Spin has been interpreted historically to mean overt deceit that is meant to manipulate the public, but since the 1990s has shifted to describing a "polishing of the truth."&lt;ref name="Safire96"/&gt; Today, spin refers to providing a certain interpretation of information meant to sway public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/spin|title=spin|publisher=|via=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Companies may use spin to create the appearance of the company or other events are going in a slightly different direction than they actually are.&lt;ref name="Safire96"&gt;Safire, William
(1996) [https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/22/magazine/the-spinner-spun.html?scp=19&amp;sq=spin%20definition&amp;st=cse ''The Spinner Spun'']&lt;/ref&gt; Within the field of public relations, spin is seen as a derogatory term, interpreted by professionals as meaning blatant deceit and manipulation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://donhalepr.com/?p=163 Spin Doctor a Derogatory Term That Needs to Go, Dilenschneider Says]. Don Hale PR. Retrieved on 2013-07-16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.prnewswire.com/2012/02/17/dear-gracie-is-flack-a-four-letter-word/ Dear Gracie: Is ‘Flack’ a Four-Letter Word? | Beyond PR]. Blog.prnewswire.com (2012-02-17). Retrieved on 2013-07-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Skilled practitioners of spin are sometimes called "spin doctors."

In Stuart Ewen’s ''PR! A Social History of Spin'', he argues that public relations can be a real menace to democracy as it renders the public discourse powerless. Corporations are able to hire public relations professionals and transmit their messages through the media channels and exercise a huge amount of influence upon the individual who is defenseless against such a powerful force. He claims that public relations is a weapon for capitalist deception and the best way to resist is to become media literate and use critical thinking when interpreting the various mediated messages.&lt;ref&gt;W. Timothy Coombs and Sherry J. Holladay, "Does Society Need Public Relations? Criticisms of Public Relations" in It’s Not Just PR: Public Relations in Society, (Blackwell Publishing Ltd, 2007), 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The techniques of spin include selectively presenting facts and quotes that support ideal positions ([[Cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry picking]]), the so-called "[[non-denial denial]]," phrasing that in a way presumes unproven truths, [[euphemism]]s for drawing attention away from items considered distasteful, and ambiguity in public statements. Another spin technique involves careful choice of timing in the release of certain news so it can take advantage of prominent events in the news.

=== Negative ===
{{see also|Negative campaigning}}
Negative public relations, also called dark public relations (DPR) and in some earlier writing "Black PR", is a process of destroying the target's reputation and/or [[corporate identity]]. The objective in DPR is to discredit someone else, who may pose a threat to the client's business or be a political rival. DPR may rely on [[IT security]], [[industrial espionage]], [[social engineering (security)|social engineering]], and [[competitive intelligence]]. Common techniques include using dirty secrets from the target, producing misleading facts to fool a competitor.&lt;ref&gt;Wattenberg, Martin P. (22 Aug. 1996). Negative Campaign Advertising: Demobilizer or Mobilizer. eScholarship Repository. UC Irvine, Department of Politics and Society. Retrieved on 29 January 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bike, William S.

Public relations are frequently just recycled information used by a plethora of sources, thus giving way to minimal perspectives regarding events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uk-engage.org/2013/08/what-are-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-using-a-proportional-representation-pr-electoral-system/|title=Advantages &amp; Disadvantages of A PR Electoral System {{!}} UK Engage|website=www.uk-engage.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-04|date=2013-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Politics and civil society ===
In ''Propaganda'' (1928), Bernays argued that the manipulation of public opinion was a necessary part of democracy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/EdwardLBernays-Propaganda Edward Bernays ''Propaganda'' (1928) p. 10]&lt;/ref&gt; In public relations, [[lobby groups]] are created to influence government policy, corporate policy or [[public opinion]], typically in a way that benefits the sponsoring organization.

In fact, Bernays stresses that we are in fact dominated in almost every aspect of our lives, by a relatively small number of persons who have mastered the ‘mental processes and social patterns of the masses,’ which include our behavior, political and economic spheres or our morals.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Bernays, "Organizing Chaos," in Propaganda, (New York: H. Liverlight, 1928), 10.&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, each individual chooses his own opinion on behavior and public issues. However, in practice, it is impossible for one to study all variables and approaches of a particular question and come to a conclusion without any external influence. This is the reason why the society has agreed upon an ‘invisible government’ to interpret on our behalf information and narrow the choice field to a more practical scale.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Bernays, "Organizing Chaos," in Propaganda, (New York: H. Liverlight, 1928), 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

When a lobby group hides its true purpose and support base, it is known as a [[front group]].&lt;ref&gt;See Peter Viggo Jakobsen, ''Focus on the CNN Effect Misses the Point: The Real Media Impact on Conflict Management is Invisible and Indirect'', Journal of Peace Research, vol.37, no.2. Institute of Political Science, University of Copenhagen (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Front groups are a form of [[astroturfing]], because they intend to sway the public or the government without disclosing their financial connection to corporate or political interests. They create a fake grass-roots movement by giving the appearance of a trusted organization that serves the public, when they actually serve their sponsors.

Politicians also employ public relations professionals to help project their views, policies, and even personalities to their best advantages.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=On the Record: Politics, Politicians and Power|first=Laurie|last=Oakes|page=191|year=2010|publisher=Hachette Australia|isbn=978-0-7336-2700-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Red Monkey was formed by Rachel Holborow, Pete Dale and Marc Walker in 1996,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Strong |first=Martin C. |title=The Great Alternative &amp; Indie Discography |year= 1999 |publisher=Canongate |isbn=0-86241-913-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; following on from Rachel and Pete’s earlier bands, the riot grrrl four-piece [[Pussycat Trash]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/803319-Pussycat-Trash |title=Pussycat Trash Discography |publisher=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Downes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/2383/1/uk_bl_ethos_522933.pdf |format=PDF |title=DIY Queer Feminist (Sub)cultural Resistance in the UK |author=Julia Downes |publisher=Etheses.whiterose.ac.uk |accessdate=2015-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gullbuy.com/buy/2003/6_10/pussycattrash.php |title=Pussycat Trash - The Brat Years: 1992-1995 gullbuy music review |publisher=Gullbuy.com |date=2003-06-10 |accessdate=2015-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lo-fi duo Avocado Baby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/951187-Avocado-Baby |title=Avocado Baby Discography |publisher=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both acts had released records on the duo’s own record label [[Slampt]], based in their adopted home town of [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]]. Marc had previously drummed for Newcastle-based Post Hardcore/Rock bands Spinach and Kodiak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipeoutmusic.com/wpcproduct/kodiak/ |title=Independent Music Publishers |publisher=Wipeoutmusic.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Red Monkey’s first release was the "Do What You Feel"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Red-Monkey-Do-What-You-Feel-Feel-What-You-Do/release/2174223 |title=Red Monkey (2) - Do What You Feel (Feel What You Do) (Vinyl) |publisher=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Extended play|EP]] on Slampt, followed by "The Time Is Right"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Red-Monkey-The-Time-Is-Right/release/749956 |title=Red Monkey (2) - The Time Is Right (Vinyl) |publisher=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; EP on [[United States|US]] label [[Troubleman Unlimited Records|Troubleman Unlimited]] and then their debut [[album]] ''Make The Moment''. [[Allmusic]] praised the album for its "melodic appeal" and the band’s "ability to make entirely political lyrics work in a personal, intelligent manner",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nitsuh Abebe |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/make-the-moment-mw0000667280 |title=Make the Moment - Red Monkey &amp;#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date=1998-03-30 |accessdate=2015-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the group’s sound was compared to [[Gang of Four (band)|Gang of Four]].

In 1998 the band toured the US to support the stateside release of the album, and a third single followed on [[Kill Rock Stars]] records,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Red-Monkey-Mailorder-Freak-7-Singles-Club-March/release/1374179 |title=Red Monkey (2) - Mailorder Freak 7" Singles Club (March) (Vinyl) |publisher=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; including two tracks performed on the band’s [[Peel Sessions|Peel Session]] earlier the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/sessions/1990s/1998/Jan25redmonkey/ |title=Radio 1 - Keeping It Peel - 25/01/1998 Red Monkey |publisher=BBC.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tours of [[Ireland]] and [[Europe]] followed before the band recorded their second album ''Difficult Is Easy'', released in 1999. The record received more mixed reviews than the first; it was praised by the [[NME]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/1090 |title=NME Reviews - Difficult Is Easy |publisher=Nme.Com |date=2005-09-12 |accessdate=2015-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Popmatters]] criticised the album for failing to capture the live energy of the band,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;nbsp; |url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/redmonkey-difficult/ |title=Red Monkey: Difficult Is Easy |publisher=PopMatters.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; albeit while making favourable comparisons to both [[Minutemen]] and [[Fugazi]], the latter of whom Red Monkey supported on their American tours.

Third and final album ''Gunpowder, Treason and Plot''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Red-Monkey-Gunpowder-Treason-And-Plot/master/311419 |title=Red Monkey (2) - Gunpowder, Treason And Plot |publisher=Discogs.com |date=2011-12-19 |accessdate=2015-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; was released in 2001 on Troubleman Unlimited, after Slampt records was wound down the previous year. Joe Mask (of Leeds group [[Bilge Pump (band)|Bilge Pump]]) joined the band on second guitar. The album was praised as a return to form and noted for the use of non-standard time signatures, as well as horns, which brought comparisons to [[The Ex (band)|The Ex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insound.com/Gunpowder-Treason-Plot-Vinyl-LP-Red-Monkey/P/INS10820/ |accessdate=May 16, 2014 |deadurl=yes |title=insound|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408225015/http://www.insound.com/Gunpowder-Treason-Plot-Vinyl-LP-Red-Monkey/P/INS10820/ |archivedate=April 8, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2001 the band was less active as members focused increasingly on their families and careers. A final split single with [[Erase Errata]] was released in 2003 and the band played their last shows in 2005.&lt;ref name="krs"/&gt; Dale started work as a music teacher, and later as a lecturer at [[Oxford Brookes University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arts.brookes.ac.uk/staff/petedale.html |title=Pete Dale — School of Arts — Oxford Brookes University |publisher=Arts.brookes.ac.uk |date=2010-07-05 |accessdate=2015-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; while continuing to play in long term side project [[Milky Wimpshake]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/245210-Milky-Wimpshake |title=Milky Wimpshake Discography |publisher=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also, immediately following Red Monkey, in a band called Chronicity. Marc Walker and Rachel Holborow went on to play in The Guise and Do The Right Thing, respectively.&lt;ref name="krs"/&gt;

==Reception==
The band have been notated for their overt [[left-wing politics|left]]-leaning political lyrics. [[Allmusic]] acclaimed the political agenda of the group, describing it as "down with materialist culture, up with self-actualization".{{r|allmusic}} Chris Nelson, writing for [[MTV]] in 1998, noted the group's lyrics and "jagged" sound. He added that the three members had "... distinct voices moving forward as one."{{r|mtv}}

'''Rice and Rasam''' (ಅನ್ನ ಸಾರು) is a 52&amp;nbsp;minutes documentary film produced by [[Rajiv Mehrotra]] of the PSBT ([[Public Service Broadcasting Trust]]) in the year 2012. It is directed by [[Ramchandra PN]], under a fellowship that is awarded by [[Public Service Broadcasting Trust|PSBT]] for the year 2011-2012. The film is about the nomadic life style of the artists of the professional theater troupes in Karnataka, South India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psbt.org/general/Fellowships PSBT]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Company Theater==
Influenced by the proscenium Parsi theater style, professional theater troupes were quite popular in the state of Karnataka during the 19th century. These theater troupes are commonly called as 'Company Theater'. The nomadic artists of the company theater move from one village to another, pitch tin sheet tents and stage plays. The best known exponent of this was the Gubbi Company, a theater troupe run by the legendary [[Gubbi Veeranna]]. But changing times has brought in a decline of these artists.
&lt;blockquote&gt;'By the year 1900, professional theater activity became institutionalized .These troupes staged plays periodically in many towns and cities and also during annual Jaatras and important festivals in different regions. With both the Maharaja and the public patronizing them more and more theater became a part and parcel of daily life. Initially the stage used to be lit with kerosene lamps and subsequently gaslights were used, to be replaced later by electric lights.'&lt;/blockquote&gt;(Source: Karnataka Varthe)&lt;ref&gt;[http://karnatakavarthe.org/a-glimpse-of-kannada-theatre Karnataka Varthe]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The film deals with the two troupes of professional theater artist Rajanna Jewargi as they struggle to adapt to times, remain relevant and survive. Gubbi Nagesh, a member of the erstwhile Gubbi Company, his wife Gubbu Manjula, son Prashant Gubbi, daughter Sweta Gubbi are also part of this entourage. The film shows the dismantling and reconstruction of the theater; and the condition in which the artists live.
&lt;blockquote&gt;'While Rice and Rasam of 52 minute duration deals with the quotidian daily routines, struggles, mediocrity, conflicts and joy, it simultaneously is critical of rapidly changing scenario of economic decline in Gubbi Theater.'&lt;/blockquote&gt;(Source: Pradip Biswas)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thescape.in/news/20120914/OPEN-FORUM-FESTIVAL-2012-A-BENCHMARK-PHENOMENON/3581 Pradip Biswas]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Title==
At one point of time when the company theater was at its glory, Companies success were judged by the number of messes that they had and the number of items that they served. But the modern day companies gives its employees only Rice and Rasam, the staple diet of Karnataka. Anything else, the employees will have to either cook themselves or buy it from outside. Hence the name of the film is Rice and Rasam.

==Production==
The film has been shot in various locations in the Southern State of Karnataka in  India - in villages like Jewargi, Kudithini, Mannur and Kukanur - spread over a period of a year during the period 2011–2012.

==Crew==
While the film has been photographed, editing and directed by [[Ramchandra PN]], location sound is by Santosh Kumar and Sound Designer and Sound Editing is by Mohandas VP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sonkfilms.com/Rice-Rasam.htm Sonk Films]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film Festival Participation==

The '''Second Situationist International''' were a small group of [[situationist]]s (the "Nashists") who broke away from the [[Situationist International]] (SI). [[Jørgen Nash]] identifies the first manifestation of the group as a leaflet signed by himself along with [[Jacqueline de Jong]] and [[Ansgar Elde]], shortly after the group Seven Rebels was formed at Situationist Bauhau at [[Asger Jorn]]'s farm [[Drakabygget]] in southern [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'', Special Issue, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the rupture with the SI, Jorn, who sided with the SI against Nash, emphasised [[situlogy]], "the transformative morphology of the unique."&lt;ref&gt;Asger Jorn "Open Creation and its Enemies," ''Internationale Situationniste'' No. 5, 1960&lt;/ref&gt;

Howard Slater describes the break between the "Parisian" and the "Scandinavian" tendencies as amounting to "a conflict between a conceptual and an expressionist approach, or, to echo Jorn's two tendencies of situlogy, a conflict between the ludic and the analytical," and quotes the ''Drakabygget Declaration'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Franco-Belgian Situationists base themselves on the same principles as [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]], [[René Descartes|Descartes]]... action precedes emotion. Emotion is a primary non-reflective intelligence: passionate thought/thinking passion. ... We do not always distinguish between theory and practice. We intend to produce our theories after the event.... The French work exactly the other way round. They want everything straight before they start and everybody has to line up correctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.infopool.org.uk/2001.html | title= Divided We Stand - An Outline of Scandinavian Situationism | author= Slater, Howard |date= 2001 | publisher= http://www.infopool.org.uk Infopool.org | accessdate= 2008-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Drakabygget Declaration'' was the founding document of the Second Situationist International, which appeared in the ''Situationist Times'' No. 2, 1962.

The declaration was signed by [[Jørgen Nash]], [[Jens Jørgen Thorsen]], [[Gordon Fazakerley]], [[Hardy Strid]], Stefan Larsson, [[Ansgar Elde]], [[Jacqueline de Jong]], and [[Guy Atkins|Patrick O'Brien]],&lt;ref&gt;According to Slater, Patrick O'Brien was a pseudonym for Guy Atkins, author of ''Asger Jorn'' (Methuen London, 1977).&lt;/ref&gt; following their expulsion from the Situationist International.

The contributors to ''[[Situationist Antinational]]'' were all associated with the Second Situationist International.

==Synopsis==
This coming of age story of courage and inspiring perseverance opens in 1960s [[Vienna]], where [[Shlomo Carlebach]] is giving a concert, having returned to the city for the first time in decades,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rabbi With a Beat and Tie-Dyed Prayers |publisher=The New York Times |date=August 15, 2013 |author=Charles Isherwood |url=http://theater.nytimes.com/2013/08/16/theater/reviews/soul-doctor-a-musical-about-rabbi-shlomo-carlebach.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then transitions back in time to Nazi-occupied [[Austria]] when Shlomo, as a child, witnessed the murder of a Jewish man singing in the streets. This experience causes Shlomo to make a pledge to always stand up for freedom of expression through music. To escape persecution, the Carlebach family moves to the [[Upper West Side]] in New York City where Shlomo is a [[Yeshiva]] student studying the [[Talmud]] and memorizing the [[Torah]], following his father's footsteps to become a [[Rabbi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Soul Doctor: Shalom, Love, and Understanding |publisher=The Village Voice |date= August 21, 2013 |author=Tom Sellar |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2013-08-21/theater/soul-doctor/full/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shlomo's path soon changes when he meets the legendary jazz singer [[Nina Simone]] in a [[Greenwich Village]] night club. She not only teaches him about her [[Gospel music|gospel]] and [[jazz]] musical roots, but also confesses how her people, like Jews in Europe at the time, were being persecuted in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Love, Prayer, LSD and Nina Simone: Get to Know Soul Doctor’s Rock Star Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach  |publisher=Broadway.com |date=July 31, 2013 |author=Josh Ferri |url=http://www.broadway.com/buzz/170898/love-prayer-lsd-and-nina-simone-get-to-know-soul-doctors-rock-star-rabbi-shlomo-carlebach/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by the music of Simone, Shlomo begins to break [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] tradition by obtaining a guitar. He is soon writing songs and playing his music for women and non-Jews in clubs around [[New York City]]. Shlomo embraces [[pop music]] and [[hippiedom]] over established scholasticism despite ramifications within his family. In the late '60s he moved to [[Haight-Ashbury]] in [[San Francisco]] where a "[[House of Love and Prayer]]" becomes his home with a following that keeps growing. During this period he played concerts alongside acts such as [[Bob Dylan]], [[Grateful Dead|the Grateful Dead]], [[Pete Seeger]] and [[Jefferson Airplane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Soul Doctor |publisher=Entertainment Weekly |date=August 15, 2013 |author=Keith Staskiewicz |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20364394_20726248,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He and Nina Simone end the show back in Vienna, performing a concert in memory of the Jewish singer he saw gunned down in the street by [[Nazism|Nazis]].

Shlomo's inspired life was driven by his talent, heart and optimism. His [[inspirational message]] is clearly heard through his own songs throughout Soul Doctor, an uplifting musical for people of all ages, religions and backgrounds. His personal pledge to stand up for [[freedom of expression]] through the power of music soars with the spirit instilled in him from lessons learned throughout his unique and interesting life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Broadway Review: ‘Soul Doctor’ |publisher=Variety |date=August 15, 2013 |author=Marilyn Stasio |url=https://variety.com/2013/legit/reviews/broadway-review-soul-doctor-1200579212/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical reception ==
The Soul Doctor musical was reviewed by many publications following its openings in [[New York City|New York]] and [[Miami]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://souldoctorbroadway.com/press.php/ Official Press Notes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224062348/http://souldoctorbroadway.com/press.php |date=2013-02-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Barbara Siegel in Theatre Mania wrote in her review: "The story is going to be compared to ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'', but the engaging and often moving new musical has a good deal more thematic depth that its predecessor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Siegel | first=Barbara | url=http://www.theatermania.com/new-york-city-theater/reviews/08-2012/soul-doctor_60461.html | title=Soul Doctor, review | publisher=Theater Mania | date=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lisa Klug's review in Jewlicious.com concluded: "With plenty of good Jewish perspectives on the comedy of life, it had me laughing, singing and clapping ... it's so good ...

[[Frank Scheck]], in ''[[The New York Post]]'', praised [[Eric Anderson (actor)|Eric Anderson]]'s performance, writing: "Eric Anderson beautifully suggests Carlebach's soft-spoken, gentle appeal, as well as the charisma that jolted him to stardom. Erica Ash is equally superb as Simone, whether quietly conveying the singer's fierce dignity or delivering stunning versions of signature classics such as "[[Sinnerman]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Scheck | first=Frank | url= http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/theater/rocking_tale_of_star_sung_in_shlomo_VuZTYpHuLXm5N2LzepDsuK | title=SA rocking tale of '60s star sung in Shlomo | publisher=[[The New York Post]] | date=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jason Zinoman also praised Anderson's performance in ''[[The New York Times]]'', writing: "Transforming from a mild-mannered rabbi into a kinetic dynamo, [[Eric Anderson (actor)|Anderson]] imbues his numbers with their own arc, often starting in a meditative mood before slowly building to a joyous, leaping roar."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Zinoman | first= Jason | url= http://theater.nytimes.com/2012/08/16/theater/reviews/soul-doctor-shlomo-carlebach-new-york-theater-workshop.html | title=T''Religious Roots Tangle With the Groovy '60s'' | publisher= [[The New York Times]] | date=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following its 2013 opening on Broadway, the Soul Doctor show was reviewed by ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Associated Press]]'', ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', and ''[[Newsday]]'', all of whom applauded Anderson's performance as [[Shlomo Carlebach|Carlebach]] while comparing the show to ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'' and ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'', and giving overall mixed to positive reviews of the musical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Review Roundup: SOUL DOCTOR Opens on Broadway - All the Reviews! |publisher=Broadway world |date=August 15, 2013 |author=Review Roundups |url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Review-Roundup-SOUL-DOCTOR-Opens-on-Broadway-Updating-LIVE-20130815}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rabbi With a Beat and Tie-Dyed Prayers |publisher=The New York Times |date=August 15, 2013 |author=Charles Isherwood |url=http://theater.nytimes.com/2013/08/16/theater/reviews/soul-doctor-a-musical-about-rabbi-shlomo-carlebach.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title='Soul Doctor' review: Rock-Star Rabbi |publisher=Newsday |date=August 14, 2013 |author=Steve Parks |url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/theater/soul-doctor-review-rock-star-rabbi-1.5890458}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gravure door Reinier van Persijn.jpg|thumb|right|"''The singing swan''" (1655) by [[Reinier van Persijn]].]]
The '''swan song''' ([[ancient Greek]]: κύκνειον ᾆσμα; [[Latin]]: ''carmen cygni'') is a metaphorical phrase for a final gesture, effort, or performance given just before [[death]] or [[retirement]]. The phrase refers to an ancient belief that [[swan]]s (''Cygnus'' spp.) sing a beautiful song just before their death, having been silent (or alternatively, not so musical) during most of their lifetime. This belief, whose basis in actuality is long-debated, had become proverbial in [[ancient Greece]] by the 3rd century BC, and was reiterated many times in later Western poetry and art.

==Origin and description==
In [[Greek mythology]], the swan was a bird consecrated to [[Apollo]], and it was therefore considered a symbol of harmony and beauty and its limited capabilities as a singer were sublimated to those of [[songbird]]s.

[[Aesop]]'s fable of "[[The Swan and the Goose]]" incorporates the swan song legend as saving its life when it was caught by mistake instead of the goose but was recognized by its song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Complete Fables|last=Aesop|publisher=Penguin Classics|year=1998|isbn=0-14-044649-4}}, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0140446494&amp;id=ZB-rVxPvtPEC&amp;pg=PA127 p.127]&lt;/ref&gt;  There is a subsequent reference in [[Aeschylus]]' ''[[Agamemnon (play)|Agamemnon]]'' (verses 1444–5) from 458 BC. In that play, [[Clytemnestra]] compares the dead [[Cassandra]] to a swan who has "sung her last final lament". [[Plato]]'s ''[[Phaedo]]'' (84d) records [[Socrates]] saying that, although swans sing in early life, they do not do so as beautifully as before they die. Furthermore, [[Aristotle]] noted in his ''[[History of Animals]]'' (615b) that swans "are musical, and sing chiefly at the approach of death". By the third century BC the belief had become a proverb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Arnott |first=W. Geoffrey |title=Swan Songs |journal=Greece &amp; Rome |volume=24 |number=2 |date=October 1977 |pages=149–153 |jstor=642700}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brazil, Mark 2003"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Whooper Swan|author=Brazil, Mark|publisher=T &amp; A D Poyser|year=2003|isbn=978-0-7136-6570-3}} pp. 64–65. ([https://books.google.com/books?id=b-E6dEYkcwsC&amp;pg=PA64 Online version])&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ovid]] mentions it in "The Story of Picus and Canens" (''[[Metamorphoses]]'', book XIV:320–396): "There, she poured out her words of grief, tearfully, in faint tones, in harmony with sadness, just as the swan sings once, in dying, its own funeral song."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ovid|publisher=University of Virginia|url=http://etext.virginia.edu/latin/ovid/trans/Metamorph14.htm#_Toc487618609|title=Metamorphoses (Kline) 14, the Ovid Collection, Univ. of Virginia E-Text Center; Bk XIV:320–396: The transformation of Picus}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The swan was also described as a singer in the works of the poets [[Virgil]] and [[Martial]].&lt;!--{{Fact}} begin--&gt;{{fix

==Controversy==
The most familiar European swan, the [[mute swan]] (''Cygnus olor''), although not actually mute, is known neither for musicality nor to vocalize as it dies. This has led some to criticize swan song beliefs since antiquity, one of the earliest&lt;ref name="Arnott, W. Geoffrey 2007"&gt;{{cite book|title=Birds in the Ancient World from A to Z|author=Arnott, W. Geoffrey|publisher=Routledge|year=2007|isbn=0-203-94662-6}} pp. 182–184. ([https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=b4pN4OApWw4C&amp;pg=PA183&amp;lpg=PA183&amp;dq=arnott+whooper+swan&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pwU1WdFdhd&amp;sig=JIw_h0GKRwwwxsM794hJVmiyfkc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Nq38UO3EMa-W0QWG0IDoDA&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=arnott%20whooper%20swan&amp;f=false Online version])&lt;/ref&gt; being [[Pliny the Elder]]: in AD 77, ''[[Pliny's Natural History|Natural History]]'' (book 10, chapter xxxii: ''olorum morte narratur flebilis cantus, falso, ut arbitror, aliquot experimentis''), states: "observation shows that the story that the dying swan sings is false." Peterson et al. note that ''Cygnus olor'' is "not mute but lacks bugling call, merely honking, grunting, and hissing on occasion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Field Guide to the Birds of Britain and Europe|author=Peterson, Roger Tory|author2=Guy Mountfort|author3=P. A. D. Hollum|author4=P. A. D. Hollom|year=2001|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Field Guides|isbn=0-618-16675-0}}, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the [[whooper swan]] (''Cygnus cygnus''), a winter visitor to parts of the eastern Mediterranean, does possess a 'bugling' call, and has been noted for issuing a drawn-out series of notes as its lungs collapse upon expiry, both being a consequence of an additional tracheal loop within its sternum. This was proposed by naturalist [[Peter Pallas]] as the basis for the legend. Both mute and whooper swans appear to be represented in ancient Greek and Egyptian art.&lt;ref name="Brazil, Mark 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Arnott, W. Geoffrey 2007"/&gt;

The whooper swan's nearest relatives, the [[trumpeter swan|trumpeter]] and [[tundra swan]]s, share its musical tracheal loop. Zoologist [[Daniel Giraud Elliot|D.G. Elliot]] reported in 1898 that a tundra swan he had shot and wounded in flight began a long glide down whilst issuing a series of "plaintive and musical" notes that "sounded at times like the soft running of the notes of an octave".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=21 January 2013|url=http://www.prairiefirenewspaper.com/2013/01/the-swans-of-nebraska|title=The Swans of Nebraska|work=Prairie Fire|location=USA|date=January 2013|author=Johnsgard, Paul A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] wrote of "The Ialous swan, ayens his deth that singeth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Skeat

In [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', Portia exclaims "Let music sound while he doth make his choice; Then, if he lose, he makes a swan-like end, / Fading in music."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/views/plays/play_view.php?WorkID=merchantvenice#1405 ''The Merchant of Venice'', Act 3 Scene 2]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in ''[[Othello]]'', the dying Emilia exclaims, "I will play the swan, / And die in music."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/views/plays/play_view.php?WorkID=othello#3598 ''Othello'', Act 5 Scene 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

The well-known [[Orlando Gibbons]] [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]] "[[The Silver Swan (song)|The Silver Swan]]" states the legend thus:
{{cquote|
:The silver Swan, who living had no Note,
:when Death approached, unlocked her silent throat.
:Leaning her breast against the reedy shore,
:thus sang her first and last, and sang no more:
:"Farewell, all joys! O Death, come close mine eyes!
:"More Geese than Swans now live, more Fools than Wise."}}

"The Swan Song" (''"Schwanengesang"'') is the nickname of the 1733 [[Baroque music|Baroque]] [[Concerto]] written by [[Georg Philipp Telemann]]: Concerto in D minor for oboe, strings and continuo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/georg-philipp-telemann-funeral-music-for-garlieb-sillem-mw0001799230|title=Georg Philipp Telemann: Funeral Music for Garlieb Sillem|author=James Manheim|work=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The concerto of Telemann begins with a sad part ([[Tempo|adagio]]) later a glad part ([[Tempo|allegro]]), the singing of the swan itself, another sad part (death), and finally a hopeful end.

According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the English phrase "swan song" or "swan-song" borrows from the [[German language|German]] ''schwanen(ge)sang'' or ''schwanenlied''.&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |date=June 2011 |title= swan, n.|journal=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |issue= |pages=  |url= http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/195413 |accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Scottish cleric [[John Willison]], in one of his Scripture Sermons, 1747, proposes a verse from Psalm 48 as a "swan-song" for the faithful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.the-highway.com/Five_Sacramental_Sermons2.html |title = www.the-highway.com |accessdate =3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Danish painter [[Nicolai Abildgaard]] painted ''Ossian synger sin Svanesang'', or ''Ossian sings his swan song'', in 1780–1782.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.smk.dk/besoeg-museet/udstillinger/dansk-og-nordisk-kunst-1750-1900/sale-i-dansk-og-nordisk-kunst-1750-1900/sal-217b/ |title = Sal 217B |publisher = Statens Museum for Kunst website |accessdate =8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] made comic use of the legend when he quipped ironically:
{{cquote|Swans sing before they die— 't were no bad thing
Should certain persons die before they sing.}}

[[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Tennyson]]'s poem "[[The Dying Swan]]"&lt;ref name=tennyson&gt;[[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Tennyson]], "The Dying Swan," [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/8eptn10.txt The Early poems of Alfred Lord Tennyson] (Project Gutenberg text), search on "shawm." This and other sources assert not merely that the swan sings, but that the song is beautiful.&lt;/ref&gt; is a poetic evocation of the beauty of the supposed song and so full of detail as to imply that he had actually heard it:
{{cquote|
:The wild swan's death-hymn took the soul
:Of that waste place with joy
:Hidden in sorrow: at first to the ear
:The warble was low, and full and clear; ...
:But anon her awful jubilant voice,
:With a music strange and manifold,
:Flow’d forth on a carol free and bold;
:As when a mighty people rejoice
:With [[shawm]]s, and with cymbals, and harps of gold...}}

Tennyson's poem was an inspiration for the ballet ''[[The Dying Swan]]'' created for [[Anna Pavlova]] in 1905 and danced to the music of ''[[Le cygne]]'' by the French composer [[Camille Saint-Saëns]].&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Naughtin, ''Ballet Music: A Handbook'', [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1YcNBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA210&amp;ots=11GLgVzmW-&amp;dq=%22the%20dying%20swan%22%20%20ballet%20inspired%20by%20Tennyson&amp;pg=PA210#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20dying%20swan%22%20%20ballet%20inspired%20by%20Tennyson&amp;f=false p.210]&lt;/ref&gt;

The band [[Led Zeppelin]]'s record label for the second half of their career was [[Swan Song Records]]. Their first five releases were on Atlantic records, the next five were on Swan Song Records.

In the television show [[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]], the twenty second episode of the fifth season is given the title Swan Song. 

Swan Song is one of the last tracks on singer [[Lana Del Rey]]'s album [[Honeymoon (Lana Del Rey album)|Honeymoon]].

The first track of Canadian band Islands' album, Return to the Sea, is entitled Swans (Life After Death). &lt;ref&gt;islandsmusic.bandcamp.com/track/swans-life-after-death-remaster&lt;/ref&gt;

==Idiom==
By extension, "swan song" has become an [[idiom]] referring to a final theatrical or dramatic appearance, or any final work or accomplishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/swansong?q=swansong|title=swansong – definition of swansong in English from the Oxford dictionary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an athlete that wins a championship or breaks records in their final season are sometimes said to have had a "swan song season."

'''Examples:'''
*[[Ray Bourque]] winning the Stanley Cup in 2001, his final season in the NHL.
*[[David Bowie]]'s ''[[Blackstar (album)|Blackstar]]'', released just 2 days before his death from liver cancer in 2016.

*[[Peyton Manning]] winning the Super Bowl in his last season.
*[[Andy Pettitte]] throwing his first [[complete game]] in 7 years in his final [[Starting pitcher|start]].

*[[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s 1991 song [[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|"The Show Must Go On"]] can be considered as a swan song for frontman [[Freddie Mercury]], discussing his attitudes regarding his declining health from [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]]; Mercury would die of complications from the disease nine months after the release of the song's associated album, ''[[Innuendo (album)|Innuendo]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="845">[[Wilhelm Furtwängler]]'s '''Symphony No. 1 in B minor''', written between 1938 and 1941, is based on an earlier piece he wrote, a Largo in B minor from 1908. To this he added three more movements for a 4-movement work:

# Largo
# Scherzo. Allegro
# Adagio
# Moderato assai

==Discography==

Unlike his later two symphonies, Furtwängler himself never recorded this one. The work lasts about 80 minutes, so [[George Alexander Albrecht]]'s interpretation on Arte Nova Classics requires two discs, while [[Alfred Walter]] conducting the Slovak State Philharmonic Orchestra, Košice only needs one Marco Polo CD.

The '''''Tarot Garden''''' (Italian: '''''Il Giardino dei Tarocchi''''') is a [[sculpture garden]] based on the esoteric [[tarot]], created by the French artist [[Niki de Saint Phalle]] (1930–2002) in [[Pescia Fiorentina]], [[località]] ''Garavicchio'', in the municipality of [[Capalbio]], [[province of Grosseto]], [[Tuscany]], [[Italy]]. The park was opened to the public in 1998.

Niki de Saint Phalle, inspired by [[Antoni Gaudí]]´s [[Parc Güell]] in Barcelona, and [[Parco dei Mostri]] in Bomarzo, as well as [[Palais Idéal]] by [[Ferdinand Cheval]], and [[Watts Towers]] by [[Simon Rodia]],  decided to make something similar in design for her monumental sculpture park based on the [[Tarot]]. In 1979, she acquired some land on top of an [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] [[Ruins|ruin]] in Garavicchio, Tuscany, about 100 km north-west of Rome along the coast&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/04/18/niki-de-saint-phalles-tarot-garden|title=The Psychedelic Garden of Tuscany|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-06-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. There she built the Giardino dei Tarocchi, containing twenty-two monumental figures representing her idea of the greater Mysteries of the tarot, constructed of reinforced concrete and covered with mirrors and ceramic mosaic.&lt;ref name="Pozzana146"&gt;Pozzana, Maria (2001). ''Gardens of Florence and Tuscany: A Complete Guide''. Giunti Editore. p. 146. {{ISBN|8809020642}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The figures can be walked through; the artist lived inside the [[sphinx]]-like ''Empress'' for several months during the construction of the garden.&lt;ref name="Pozzana146" /&gt;

'''''The Fall of the Titans''''' is an [[oil painting]] of the [[Titanomachy]] by the Dutch painter [[Cornelis van Haarlem]] in 1588–1590. It measures {{nowrap|239 × 307 cm}} {{nowrap|(94 × 121 in)}}. The work is in the collection of the [[Statens Museum for Kunst|Statens Museum]] (the national art gallery) in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]].  It is an ambitious work of the [[Haarlem Mannerists]], and a display of the artist's ability to devise and depict a large number of varied poses for the male nudes.&lt;ref&gt;Statens&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Greek mythology]], the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] were members of the second generation of divine beings, descending from the [[Greek primordial deities|primordial deities]] and preceding the [[Twelve Olympians#Olympians|Olympians]]. Based on [[Mount Othrys]], the Titans most famously included the first twelve children of [[Gaia]] (Mother Earth) and [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]] (Father Sky). They ruled during the legendary [[Golden Age]], and also comprised the first [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] of Greek deities.&lt;ref&gt;Statens&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as the Titan [[Cronus]] overthrew his father Uranus, the Titans were overthrown by Cronus's children (Zeus, Hades, Poseidon, Hestia, Hera and Demeter), the core Olympian deities, in the [[Titanomachy]] (or "War of the Titans"), at the end of which they were imprisoned in [[Tartarus]], a Greek version of [[Hell]].  Their arrival there is depicted in the painting. 

The painting was bought by King [[Christian IV of Denmark]] in 1621, and followed most of the royal collection into public ownership in the Statens in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Statens&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Terrace''''' is a 1909 landscape painting by [[Milly Childers]] showing the members' terrace of the [[Palace of Westminster]] with its view of the [[Thames]] looking towards [[Lambeth Bridge]]. 

The people on the terrace are, not surprisingly, all men. In their relaxed poses the painting seems to give more of a general impression of a men's club, which the [[House of Commons]] still was in 1909. On closer inspection contemporary viewers may have seen more than just an old boys' network in action. The central figures are [[Sir John Benjamin Stone]], who took a photograph of Childers with her painting. He appears to be giving a photograph to Sir Henry David Erskine, the Serjeant-at-Arms who had been responsible for removing the suffragettes Helen Fox and [[Muriel Matters]] who had chained themselves to the grilles of the ladies gallery of the [[House of Commons]] on 28 October 1908.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/item/rbcmiller001253/ Suffragettes Rush the House of Commons], Library of Congress archives&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/evolutionofparliament/parliamentwork/offices-and-ceremonies/collections/serjeant-at-arms/portrait-of-sir-henry-david-erskine/ Comments on the portrait of Sir Henry David Erskine] in the Parliamentary Art Collection&lt;/ref&gt; The man leaning against the balustrade and looking at the painter was the Labor Party leader [[Keir Hardie]], a friend of the suffragette [[Emmeline Pankhurst]].

'''Urban art''' is a style of art that relates to cities and city life often done by artists who live in or have a passion for city life. In that way urban art combines [[street art]] and [[graffiti]] and is often used to summarize all [[visual art]] forms arising in [[urban area]]s, being inspired by urban architecture or present urban lifestyle. Because the urban arts are characterized by existing in the public space, they are often viewed as [[vandalism]] and destruction of private property.

Although urban art started at the neighborhood level, where a lot of people of different cultures live together, it is an international art form with an unlimited number of uses nowadays. Many urban artists travel from city to city and have social contacts all over the world. The notion of 'Urban Art' developed from street art which is primarily concerned with [[graffiti]] culture. Urban art represents a broader cross-section of artists that, in addition to covering traditional street artists working in formal gallery spaces, also cover artists using more traditional media but with a subject matter that deals with contemporary urban culture and political issues. In Paris, [[Le Mur (urban art)|Le Mur]] is a [[Public art|public]] museum of urban art.

== In the mainstream ==
Though starting as an underground movement, urban artists like [[Banksy]] and [[Adam Neate]] have now gained mainstream status and have, in turn, propelled the urban art scene into popular culture. Perceptions have started to change as urban movements such as graffiti slowly gain acceptance from the public. A confirmation of street art's new mainstream status can be, in part, confirmed by an invitation from the [[Tate]] calling upon artists to create outdoor pieces on the Thames side of the gallery in the summer of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/artblog/2008/apr/08/streetartattate|title=Street Art is Officially Mainstream|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band [[Gorillaz]] uses an urban art style to promote their band. The band members are animated in a [[graffiti]] style.

The '''Victory Monument''', created by sculptor [[Leonard Crunelle]], was built to honor the Eighth Regiment of the Illinois National Guard, an African-American unit that served in France during [[World War I]]. It is located in the [[Black Metropolis-Bronzeville District]] in the [[Douglas, Chicago|Douglas]] [[Community areas of Chicago|community area]] of [[Chicago, IL|Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. It was designated a [[Chicago Landmark]] on September 9, 1998.&lt;ref name=CL&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.chi.il.us/Landmarks/V/Victory.html|title=Victory Monument (Chicago)|publisher=City of Chicago Department of Planning and Development, Landmarks Division|year=2003|accessdate=May 7, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070410125837/http://www.ci.chi.il.us/Landmarks/V/Victory.html|archive-date=April 10, 2007|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The structure was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on April 30, 1986.  An annual [[Memorial Day]] ceremony is held at the monument.&lt;ref name=CL/&gt;

== Description and history ==
The [[Smithsonian Institution]]’s [[Archives of American Art]] describes the monument:
::A white granite shaft topped with a bronze [[doughboy]] sculpture. On the monument's shaft are three bronze relief panels depicting life-sized figures. (Victory Panel:) Left full-length profile of a Classically draped African-American female figure representing motherhood. In her hand she holds a branch symbolizing Victory. (Columbia Panel:) Full-length Classically draped female figure with a helmet on her head. In her proper left hand she holds a tablet inscribed with the names of battles in which African-American soldiers fought. (African-American Soldier Panel:) A bare chested African-American soldier of the 370th Infantry, which fought in France, standing with an eagle in left profile in front of him.&lt;ref name = "siris"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::In 1927, the State of Illinois erected this monument in the Chicago neighborhood known as "[[Douglas, Chicago#Bronzeville|Bronzeville]]," which was home of the "Fighting Eighth" Regiment of the [[Illinois National Guard]]. The names of 137 members of the [[370th Infantry Regiment (United States)|Eighth Infantry]], Illinois National Guard, who lost their lives during World War I, are inscribed on a bronze panel. The Eighth Regiment of the Illinois National Guard was reorganized as the [[370th Infantry Regiment (United States)|370th U.S. Infantry of the 93rd Division]], and this regiment saw service on WWI major battlefields. It was the last regiment pursuing the retreating German forces in the [[Aisne-Marne]] region of France, just before the November 11, 1918 Armistice.

In 1908 while [[Aaron Montgomery Ward]] was contesting the land use law for [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]] for a second time in the [[Illinois Supreme Court]], the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] considered locating the ''[[Fountain of the Great Lakes]]'' at 35th Street and Grand Boulevard (the latter has been renamed as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Public Sculptor: Lorado Taft and the Beautification of Chicago|author=Garvey, Timothy J.|year=1988|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=0-252-01501-0|page =17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead, the Victory Monument was installed at this intersection.&lt;ref name=CL/&gt;

The [[Bud Billiken Parade]] has for many years traveled along King Drive. In some years, the Parade has started at 31st and King and in other years it has started as far south as 39th and King Drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uchospitals.edu/programs/community/sponsorships/billiken.html|title=Bud Billiken Parade|accessdate=July 19, 2009|publisher=[[University of Chicago Medical Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.budbillikenparade.com/|title=Bud Billiken Parade &amp; Picnic|accessdate=July 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has often started very near this monument.

Recently, the monument has received a grant for restoration as part of World War I centennial activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-wwi-centennial-met-20170927-story.html|title=For WWI centennial, six Illinois memorials to get restoration funds|first=Gregory|last=Pratt|publisher=|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate=September 28, 2017|date=September 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Young Sick Bacchus''''' (Italian: ''Bacchino Malato''), also known as the '''''Sick Bacchus''''' or the '''''Self-Portrait as Bacchus''''',  is an early self-portrait by the [[Baroque]] artist [[Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio]], dated between 1593 and 1594. It now hangs in the [[Galleria Borghese]] in [[Rome]]. According to Caravaggio's first biographer, [[Giovanni Baglione]], it was a [[Cabinet painting|cabinet piece]] painted by the artist using a mirror.&lt;ref name=Hibbard&gt;{{cite book|last=Hibbard|first=Howard|title=Caravaggio|year=1985|publisher=Westview Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780064301282|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The painting dates from Caravaggio's first years in Rome following his arrival from his native [[Milan]] in mid-1592. Sources for this period are inconclusive and probably inaccurate, but they agree that at one point the artist fell extremely ill and spent six months in the hospital of Santa Maria della Consolazione.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} According to a 2009 article in the American medical publication ''[[Clinical Infectious Diseases]]'', the painting indicates that Caravaggio's physical ailment likely involved [[malaria]], as the [[jaundice]]d appearance of the skin and the [[jaundice|icterus]] in the eyes are indications of some active [[hepatic]] disease causing high levels of [[bilirubin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Clinical Infectious Diseases |author= IDSA|publisher=Clinical Infectious Disease |date=Jan 1, 2009 |url=http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/48/1.toc.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Sick Bacchus'' was among the many works making up the collection of [[Giuseppe Cesari]], one of Caravaggio's early employers, which was seized by the art-collector [[Cardinal-Nephew]] [[Scipione Borghese]] in 1607, together with the ''[[Boy Peeling Fruit (Caravaggio)|Boy Peeling Fruit]]'' and ''[[Boy with a Basket of Fruit (Caravaggio)|Boy with a Basket of Fruit]]''.

==Style==
{{sectOR|date=May 2012}}
Apart from its assumed autobiographical content, this early painting was likely used by Caravaggio to market himself, demonstrating his virtuosity in painting genres such as [[still-life]] and [[portraits]] and hinting at the ability to paint the classical figures of antiquity. The three-quarters angle of the face was among those preferred for late renaissance portraiture, but what is striking is the grimace and tilt of the head, and the very real sense of the suffering; a feature that most Baroque art shares.

The [[still-life]] can be compared with that contained in slightly later works such as the ''Boy With a Basket of Fruit'' and the ''[[Boy Bitten by a Lizard (Caravaggio)|Boy Bitten by a Lizard]]'' where the fruits are in a much better condition, reflecting no doubt Caravaggio's improved condition, both physically and mentally.

The painting shows the influence of his teacher, the Bergamasque [[Simone Peterzano]], in the utilization of the tensed musculature depiction, and of the austere Lombard school style in its attention to realistic details.

==Commentary==
[[Cindy Sherman]], as part of her ''History Portrait'' series (1989-1990), produced a parody on ''Sick Bacchus'', an ironic photographic self-portrait named ''Untitled # 224''.&lt;ref&gt;Kimberlee A. Cloutier-Blazzard, [http://breadandcircusnetwork.wordpress.com/2007/07/29/cindy-sherman-her-%E2%80%9Chistory-portrait%E2%80%9D-series-as-post-modern-parody/ Cindy Sherman: Her “History Portrait” Series as Post-Modern Parody], ''Bread and Circus'', 29 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

During a 2018 [[NPR]] interview, [[Paul Janeway]] of the band [[St. Paul &amp; the Broken Bones]] said that the title of his band's new album, ''[[Young Sick Camellia]]'', is an homage to Caravaggio's ''Young Sick Bacchus'' ([[camellias]] being the [[state flower]] of the band's home state, [[Alabama]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Family Blood Of St. Paul &amp; The Broken Bones|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/09/08/645818831/the-family-blood-of-st-paul-the-broken-bones/|accessdate=September 11, 2018|work=NPR.org|date=September 8, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
