      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12409">The '''Alsószentmihály inscription''' is an [[inscription]] on a building stone in [[Mihai Viteazu, Cluj]] ([[Transylvania]], today [[Romania]]). The origins and translation of the inscription are uncertain.

== The relic ==
[[File:Alsoszentmihaly rovas felirat fenykep.png|thumb|The photo of the Alsószentmihály inscription]]
The stone was an ancient Roman building stone—proved by the leaf-symbol, a frequently applied ornamental element of ancient Roman inscriptions—reused in the 10th century. Alsószentmihály located on the territory of the late [[Dacia Aureliana|Province Dacia]] existed up to the middle of the 3rd century. Dénes showed that the [[Kabar|Khavars]] (Khazar rebels joined the Hungarians in the 9th century&lt;ref&gt;Kristó, Gyula &amp; Makk, Ferenc (2001): ''A kilencedik és a tizedik század története'' [The history of the 9th and the 10th centuries], p. 52. In: ''Magyar Századok'' [Hungarian Centuries]. Published by Pannonica Kiadó, Ser. ed.: Gyula Szvák, 222 p.&lt;/ref&gt;) probably settled in this region (that time Transylvania).&lt;ref&gt;Dénes, József (1984-1985): ''A magyarok hét neme és hét országa (A magyar “törzsek” elhelyezkedése a Kárpát-medencében”)'' [The seven gens and seven countries of the Magyars (The allocation of the Magyar “tribes” in the Carpathian Basin)]. In: ''Móra Ferenc Múzeum Évkönyve'' [The Annual of the Ferenc Móra Museum of Szeged], Szeged, 1991, p. 573&lt;/ref&gt; In some parts of Hungary, there are data of the Khavars even from the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;Györffy, György (1990): ''A magyarság keleti elemei''. [The Eastern Elements of the Hungarians]. Budapest: Gondolat, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

==Script used for the Alsószentmihály inscription==
Some quotations from historian [[Gábor Vékony]] about the identification of the script in this inscription:

* Vékony wrote in page 218: "Mivel az alsószentmihályi felirat nem a székely rovásírás elterjedési területén található, s az első sorban csak magánhangzókat olvashatnánk egymás mellett a székely ábécé alapján, nyugodtan kijelenthetjük, hogy a feliratnak csak a székely íráson kívüli magyarázata lehet." Translated: "Since the Alsószentmihály inscription was found not in the geographical area of the Old Hungarian script, and in the first line, only vowels could be read based on the [[Szekely alphabet]], we can state surely that the possible transcription of the inscription is surely out of the Szekely script".&lt;ref&gt;Vékony Gábor (2004): A székely írás emlékei, kapcsolatai, története. Budapest: Nap Kiadó, page 218, first five rows of the first paragraph&lt;/ref&gt;
* Vékony wrote in page 230: "Összefoglalóan megállapíthatjuk, hogy az alsószentmihályfalvi felirat az Erdélybe került kavarok emléke, amely természetesen kazárul, kazár írással íródott.". Translated: "To summarize, we can state that the Alsószentmihály Village inscription is the relic of the Khavars settled into Transylvania, which is naturally written in Khazar with Khazarian script."&lt;ref&gt;Vékony Gábor (2004): A székely írás emlékei, kapcsolatai, története. Budapest: Nap Kiadó, page 230, first three rows of the second paragraph&lt;/ref&gt;
* Vékony wrote in page 280: "Hasonló jel előfordul más kazáriai rovásfeliratokon is." Translated: ''Similar symbol occurs in other Khazarian runic inscriptions as well.''&lt;ref&gt;Vékony Gábor (2004): A székely írás emlékei, kapcsolatai, története. Budapest: Nap Kiadó, page 280, fifth and sixth rows of the fourth paragraph&lt;/ref&gt;
* Vékony wrote in page 109:"Erdélyben, az alsószentmihályfalvi templomba másodlagosan beépített kő felirata egyértelműen a kazár rovásábécével íródott.". Translated: "In Transylvania, the inscription of the reused stone built into the wall of the church of the Alsószentmihály Village is unambiguously written with Khazarian runic alphabet."&lt;ref&gt;Vékony Gábor (2004): A székely írás emlékei, kapcsolatai, története. Budapest: Nap Kiadó, page 109, last third of the second paragraph&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the quotations above examples, it can be stated that Vékony identified the script of the Alsószentmihály relic as a Khazarian script. According to Vékony, another relic, namely the [[Homokmégy-Halom inscription]] contains Khazarian text as well.&lt;ref&gt;Vékony Gábor (2004): A székely írás emlékei, kapcsolatai, története. Budapest: Nap Kiadó, page 218, first five rows of the first paragraph&lt;/ref&gt;

== The meaning of the inscription ==

The Alsószentmihály inscription was deciphered by archaeologist [[Gábor Vékony]].

According to [[Gábor Vékony|Vékony]], the inscription was made by a [[Kabar|Khavar]] leader, whose religion was [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Gábor Vékony|Vékony, Gábor]] (1985): Késő népvándorláskori rovásfeliratok [Rovas inscriptions from the Late Migration Period]. In: Életünk Vol. XXII, No. 1, pp. 71-84&lt;/ref&gt; The first symbol of the first row is a ligature, its transcription: '''&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;tl&lt;sup&gt;ï&lt;/sup&gt;ɣ'''.&lt;ref&gt;Vékony, Gábor (1985): Késő népvándorláskori rovásfeliratok [Runic inscriptions from the Late Migration Period]. In: Életünk Vol. XXII, No. 1, pp. 71-84&lt;/ref&gt; The first symbol (from left) in the second row is a Khazarian word separator.&lt;ref&gt;Vékony Gábor (2004): A székely írás emlékei, kapcsolatai, története. Budapest: Nap Kiadó, page 217&lt;/ref&gt;

In the inscription, the third symbol of the first row (from left), and the symbol in the second and last place can be considered as the descendants of the [[Turkic ideograms]]. Nevertheless, their relation needs more evidence.

==Critics, alternative theories==
There are several critics of Vékony's theories and translations, most notably the Hungarian [[Linguistics|linguist]] and historian, [[András Róna-Tas]]. The debates were summarized{{How|date=June 2016}} by István Riba in 1999 and 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Riba,István: Jöttek, honfoglaltak, fújtak. Régészvita egy rovásírásról [Came, settled, blown.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29555">'''Attentional bias''' is the tendency for people's perception to be affected by their recurring thoughts at the time.&lt;ref name="Bar-Haim2007" /&gt; Attentional biases may explain an individual's failure to consider alternative possibilities, as specific thoughts guide the train of thought in a certain manner.&lt;ref name="Baron2013"/&gt; For example, smokers tend to possess a [[bias]] for cigarettes and other smoking-related cues around them, due to the positive thoughts they've already attributed between smoking and the cues they were exposed to while smoking.&lt;ref name="Begh2013" /&gt; Attentional bias has also been associated with clinically relevant symptoms such as [[anxiety]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]].&lt;ref name="Tran2015" /&gt;

==In decision making==
A commonly studied experiment to test for attentional bias is one in which there are two variables, a factor (A) and a result (B). Both can be either present (P) or not present (N). This results in four possible combinations:

#Both the factor and result are present (AP/BP)
#Both the factor and result are not present (AN/BN)
#While the factor is present, the result is not (AP/BN)
#While the result is present, the factor is not (AN/BP)

The four combinations can be shown in table form as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
!
! scope="col" | A present (A)
! scope="col" | A not present (A')
|-
! scope="row" | B present (B)
|AP/BP
|AN/BP
|-
! scope="row" | B not present (B')
|AP/BN
|AN/BN
|}

A common question which follows the structure of the above experiment is: "Does God answer prayers?"&lt;ref name="Nisbett1980"/&gt; Due to attentional bias, theists tend to say "yes". They focus on the present/present (A/B) cell, as their religious beliefs in a deity cause them to fixate on the occasions when they were given what they asked for, thus they use the justification: "Many times I've asked God for something, and he's given it to me." Similarly, due to attentional bias, atheists equally tunnel on data from the present/absent (A/B', A'/B) cells: "Has God ever given me something that I didn't ask for?" or "Have I asked God for something and didn't receive it?" This experiment too supports Smedslund's general conclusion that subjects tend to ignore part of the table depending on their specific attentional biases.&lt;ref name="Baron2013"/&gt;

The scenarios can be illustrated below in a similar table to above:

{| class="wikitable"
!
! scope="col" | Asked god for A (A)
! scope="col" | Did not ask god for A (A')
|-
! scope="row" | A was fulfilled (B)
|A/B
|A'/B
|-
! scope="row" | A was not fulfilled (B')
|A/B'
|A'/B'
|}

When making decisions, attentional biases toward positive [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] have been associated with numerous positive outcomes, such as increased [[social engagement]], increased [[prosocial behaviour]], decreased [[externalizing disorders]], and decreased [[Emotional detachment|emotionally withdrawn behavior]].&lt;ref name="Troller-Renfree2015" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Troller-Renfree|first=Sonya|last2=McLaughlin|first2=Katie A.|last3=Sheridan|first3=Margaret A.|last4=Nelson|first4=Charles A.|last5=Zeanah|first5=Charles H.|last6=Fox|first6=Nathan A.|date=January 2017|title=The beneficial effects of a positive attention bias among children with a history of psychosocial deprivation|journal=Biological Psychology|volume=122|pages=110–120|doi=10.1016/j.biopsycho.2016.04.008|issn=0301-0511|pmc=5074922|pmid=27109625}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, individuals with clinically relevant symptoms, such as [[anxiety disorder]]&lt;ref name="Bar-Haim2007" /&gt; and [[chronic pain]]&lt;ref name="Schoth2010" /&gt; are shown to prioritize threat cues over reward cues.&lt;ref name="Mogg2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mathews1994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tran2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MacLeod2002" /&gt; In one experiment, faces with varying valences were presented (neutral, threatening, and happy) with a forced-choice reaction time at two exposure durations, 500 and 1250msec. For individuals with high trait anxiety, there was strong evidence for an attentional bias favoring threatening facial expressions. Additionally, increased [[dysphoria]] correlated with the tendency to avoid happy faces.&lt;ref name="Bradley1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fox2010" /&gt; This tendency leads to a spiraling effect, as one will only see negative faces, which induces greater anxiety, which exacerbates the aforementioned tendency to avoid positive stimuli – a form of the vigilance-avoidance pattern.&lt;ref name="Mogg1996" /&gt;

Notably, there is also a difference in attention biases between anxious and depressed individuals. Word pairs were shown to the subjects, with a dot probe following a word of each pair (dot probe paradigm). One-half of the word pairs were presented on the subliminal level, and the other half were presented on the supraliminal level, and then the response time was measured. As expected, the anxious and depressed groups showed an attentional bias towards negative words compared to the normal control group. On a supraliminal level, the depressed group showed greater vigilance for threat stimuli than the anxious group. However, for subliminal threat stimuli, the anxious group showed a greater vigilance, which implies an anxiety-related bias on the subconscious level.&lt;ref name="Mogg1995" /&gt;

==In addictive behaviour==
Research from the past two decades has established that [[Addiction|addictive behaviour]] is strongly correlated to the attentional bias for substance-related cues, in how the latter characterizes the former.&lt;ref name="Fielda2008" /&gt; An example of this is smoking and smoking-related cues.&lt;ref name="Begh2013" /&gt;

Research (using the Stroop paradigm) tested the effect of mixing smoking related words (cigarette, puff, and smoke) with: negative connoting words (sick, pain and guilty), positive connoting words, (safe, glad, and hopeful) and neutral connoting words (tool, shovel, and hammer). Results showed a strong correlation between a slower reaction time and the degree of negative language employed when discussing smoking. The results indicate attentional bias, suggesting the influence negative language has had on the individual attitude towards smoking.&lt;ref name="DrobesElibero2006"/&gt; When asked to think of the negative consequences of smoking, as the negative language evoked underlying negative feelings toward smoking, they displayed fewer cravings than the smoker subjects who were encouraged to smoke.&lt;ref name="Szasz2012" /&gt; The experiment illustrates the influence of attentional bias on environmental smoking cues and how these could contribute to a smokers' inability to quit. As stated earlier individuals' attentional biases are influenced by [[subliminal stimuli]], so in the smoker's case, they are more subject to substance-related stimuli such as observing other smokers or noticing ads for cigarettes.&lt;ref name="YanJiang2009" /&gt; The stimuli evoke expectancy of substance availability, which creates a further attentional bias for substance-related stimuli and induces craving for the substance.&lt;ref name="Fielda2008" /&gt;

Similar Stroop paradigm studies have concluded that attentional bias is not dependent on smoking itself, but rather the person who is the smoker displays attentional bias. A recent study required one group of smokers to refrain from smoking the night before and another less than an hour before. Abstinence from smoking created slower reaction time, but a smoke break between study sessions showed increased reaction time. Researchers say this shows that [[nicotine]] dependence intensifies attention, but does not directly depend on smoking itself due to lack of evidence.&lt;ref name="CanamarLondon2012" /&gt; The longer reaction time suggests smokers craving a cigarette linger on smoking related words.&lt;ref name="Field2009" /&gt; Smokers and smokers attempting to quit displayed the same slower reaction time for smoking related words,&lt;ref name="Cane2008" /&gt; which supports research that implies attentional bias is a behavioral mechanism versus a dependency mechanism, due to the fact that the smokers were slowed down by smoking related words and negative words, but not slowed down by positive and neutral words.

Drug addiction is also an example of attentional bias in that certain memories or objects can prompt intense cravings to one’s drug of choice. It is easier for individuals who experience this to relapse and begin their drug use again, because the urges given off by that initial stimuli can prove to be too strong to curve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Motivation|last=Deckers|first=Lambert|publisher=Routledge|year=2018|isbn=9781351713887|edition=5th|location=New York|pages=110-111}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are some ways that individuals could overcome attentional bias, and a solution is stimuli-related therapy. This type of therapy would give those struggling with addiction and relapse an opportunity to overcome the initial fear associated with a particular object. A study conducted by a group of researchers in the Netherlands found that by giving participants an opportunity to attend therapy sessions during their treatment for drug addiction, more participants remained drug free compared to those who relapsed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Marissen, M. A. E., Franken, I. H. A., Waters, A. J., Blanken, P., van den Brink, W., &amp; Hendriks, V. M. (2006). Attentional bias predicts heroin relapse following treatment. ''Addiction'', ''101''(9), 1306–1312.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the conclusion can be drawn that with exposure therapy, the number of patients who will leave a treatment facility and relapse decreases.The Stoop Test also showed in this study that between the control group and the treatment group the only major component of the test was time; researchers made the claim that those who received treatment reacted a lot faster to certain drug related stimuli versus those in the control group who did not.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This means that when experiencing attentional bias, treated addicts seemed to brush off the memories a little easier compared to those who had not received proper treatment. In other words, certain steps need to be taken in treatment facilities across the country to ensure that drug addiction no longer rises, or continues to ruin people’s lives. Also, a therapy of this kind should be closely monitored and mandatory to ensure the smallest number of relapses occur after treatment.

==Measurements==
There are two different forms of attentional bias that can be measured:

; Within-subject bias
: When there is a significant difference between an anxious individuals' attention bias towards threat-related stimuli and attention bias towards [[Neutral stimulus|neutral stimuli]] (which usually favors threat-related stimuli)&lt;ref name="Bar-Haim2007" /&gt;

; Between-subject bias
: When there is a significant difference between non-anxious and anxious individuals' attention bias towards and neutral stimuli and threat-related stimuli&lt;ref name="Bar-Haim2007" /&gt;

===Measurement paradigms===
There are four main paradigms used to measure attentional bias:&lt;ref name="Tran2015" /&gt;

; [[Stroop effect|Stroop]] paradigm
: The Stroop paradigm was the first measure of attentional bias.&lt;ref name="Tran2015" /&gt; It also uses reaction time, only in this case utilizing [[color]]s. The subject would have to read the color of the word (e.g. brown), however, the name of the word would be a different color (e.g. red). Variations involve the opposite, where one would have to read the name of the word, but the color of the word would differ to it.

; [[Dot-probe paradigm]]
: The dot-probe paradigm/task is the gold standard in attentional bias research, considered an upgraded version of the dot-probe paradigm.&lt;ref name="Tran2015" /&gt; Two stimuli of difference valences are presented simultaneously for a fixed time. Then, a probe replaces one of the two stimuli, which the participants have to respond to – by classifying the probe or responding to the location.&lt;ref name="Mogg1996" /&gt;

; Posner paradigm
: The Posner paradigm or Posner cueing task is similar to the [[dot-probe paradigm]].&lt;ref name="Tran2015" /&gt; It is a sight test, which assesses the individual's ability to switch and focus on different stimuli presented. The subject focuses on a specific point, then attempts to react as quickly as possible to target stimuli presented to the sides of the specified point.

; [[Visual search]] paradigm
: The visual search is a less used method of assessing attentional bias.&lt;ref name="Mogg1996" /&gt; It involves measuring one's ability to spot and discern particular objects among other objects.

While the other options are valid methods, they all tap into different aspects of attention bias.&lt;ref name="Bar-Haim2007" /&gt; Because of this, some methods are less used when looking into specific aspects of attentional bias. For example, in a posner cueing task, the cues were either a ''neutral'', ''angry'' or ''happy'', facial expression. There were both valid (targets appearing in the same location as the cue/face) and invalid trials (The target appearing in a different location to the cue/face). Surprisingly enough, in the invalid tests, individuals' response times increased to the same degree of attentional bias for both negative stimuli and positive stimuli, contrary to hundreds of other studies.&lt;ref name="Fox2010" /&gt;

==Mechanisms==
On a scientific level, attentional bias often seen in eye tracking movements is thought to be an underlying issue of addiction. Smokers linger on smoking cues compared with neutral cues. Researchers found higher activation in the [[insular cortex]], the [[orbitofrontal cortex]] and the [[amygdala]] when presented with smoking cues. The [[orbitofrontal cortex]] is known to be coordinated with drug-seeking behavior and the insular cortex and amygdala are involved in the autonomic and emotional state of an individual.&lt;ref name="Janes2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KangChang2012" /&gt;

Neural activity is also known to decrease upon the beginning of smoking, focusing the smokers' attention on their upcoming cigarette. Therefore, when smoking cues are nearby it is harder for a smoker to concentrate on other tasks. This is seen in the activation of the dorsal [[anterior cingulate cortex]], known for focusing attention on relevant stimuli.&lt;ref name="Luijten2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stippekohl2012" /&gt;

However beyond this, the mechanisms of attentional bias is an uncertain area, as there are many conflicting theories on how attentional biases operate.&lt;ref name="Bar-Haim2007" /&gt; An initial theory was [[Schema (psychology)|schema theory]], in which it was believed schema was biased towards threats, thus threat-related material is always favored in cognitive thinking.&lt;ref name="Beck1997" /&gt; Conversely, other individuals have argued that humans are prone to attentional biases at certain points of information processing, which is now a more common topic of controversy.&lt;ref name="Mogg1996" /&gt;

Psychologist [[J. Mark G. Williams]] and colleagues have argued that anxious individuals tend to prioritize threat stimuli during early information processing, and direct their attention away from threats in more strategic stages of processing.&lt;ref name="Williams1997" /&gt; This correlates with the vigilance-avoidance pattern, which is when one initially directs attention to threat, however then proceeds to avoid processing details and information in order to avoid an anxious state of mind.&lt;ref name="Mogg1996" /&gt; Conversely, others theorize that anxiety has little impact on initial detection of threats but has is more significant in modulating the maintenance of attention on the source of the threat.&lt;ref name="Bar-Haim2007" /&gt; This can be explained by the alternative theory to the vigilance-avoidance pattern, which is that anxious individuals, once processing the threat, struggle to disengage attention from the threat stimuli due to reasons such as fear.&lt;ref name="Mogg1996" /&gt;

Regardless of the opinions, there have been numerous studies which attempt to find the ultimate explanation, however, there have been results which support both theories, thus making the mechanisms of attention bias an uncertain topic.

==Variables==

===Time===
In one study, stimulus exposure duration was tested against attentional bias for threat stimuli (for non-clinical anxiety). Individuals were given exposure durations of 100, 500, and 1500 millisecond intervals. However, there was shown to be no significant change is the bias towards threat stimuli.&lt;ref name="Mogg1996" /&gt; The experiment has yet to be tested for clinical anxiety.

===Neurocognitive function===
A study also explored the negative relationship between neurocognitive function and attentional bias. Individuals with a lower capacity in the attentional domain, particularly in [[Digit symbol substitution test|digit symbol coding]], exhibited more attentional bias toward threats.&lt;ref name="Mogg1996" /&gt;

==Clinical applications==
The link between attentional biases and addictions illustrate how controlling attentional processes may be essential in assisting smokers who are trying to quit. However, this is not dealt with, as in the case of the United Kingdom (UK), the Stop Smoking Services (SSS) and [[National Health Service]] (NHS) both have yet to target attentional biases in their [[smoking cessation]] programs.&lt;ref name="Begh2013" /&gt;

Individuals with clinically relevant symptoms, such as anxiety disorders&lt;ref name="Bar-Haim2007" /&gt; and chronic pain&lt;ref name="Schoth2010" /&gt; are shown to initially focus on threatening information.&lt;ref name="Mogg2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mathews1994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tran2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MacLeod2002" /&gt; However, there is still uncertainty regarding the causes of this relationship. Two studies explored the causes by using a modified dot-probe paradigm and experimentally inducing differential attentional responses to emotional stimuli and then noting the effect on the consequential emotional vulnerability. The results confirmed how inducing attentional bias can alter emotional vulnerability, thus introducing the possibility that cognitive-experimental procedures designed around these results have potential therapeutic value in the future.&lt;ref name="MacLeod2002" /&gt;

A '''''Beerwolf''''' ('''''Bärwolf''''', '''''Werwolf''''') is a German folk-tale monster&lt;ref&gt;''The European Reformation'', Euan Cameron, p 354&lt;/ref&gt; commonly known as a [[werewolf]].

Beerwolf is a concept introduced by [[Martin Luther]] (in a 1539 debate) that Luther uses to describe the [[Pope]] and [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. In the context of [[resistance theory]], a "Beerwolf", "in contrast to a mere tyrant, not only broke the law, but overturned the entire moral order upon which it is based. All the subjects of such a ruler ... had the right to resist and even to kill him and all his supporters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Cynthia Grant Schonberger|title=Luther and the Justification of Resistance to Legitimate Authority|journal=[[Journal of the History of Ideas]]|volume=40|issue=1|pages=3&amp;ndash;20|doi=10.2307/2709257|date=January–March 1979|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|jstor=2709257}}; as specified in Luther's Collected Works, 39(ii) 41-42&lt;/ref&gt;

The significance of the term lies in the fact that, for most of his life, Luther held that no subject could actively resist his secular ruler, an issue of obvious significance in a time when many rulers in the German lands and their respective subjects held competing religious beliefs. The concept of ''Beerwolf'' marked Luther's final, and most extreme, position on resistance theory, as it relied on [[natural law]] (specifically, what would later come to be called [[Hobbes]]' right to self-preservation) instead of earlier and more limited rights to resistance that Luther had accepted as flowing from German constitutional law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Robert V.

The concept of just rebellion that the term ''Beerwolf'' introduced was subsequently developed by fellow Protestants who faced a similar situation in France, the Huguenot [[Monarchomachs]].

== Meaning ==
[[File:Ramakrishna trance 1879.jpg|thumb|[[Ramakrishna]] in samadhi at the house of Keshab Chandra Sen. He is seen supported by his nephew Hriday and surrounded by brahmo devotees.]]
''Bhava samadhi'', sometimes translated as 'trance', has no direct counterpart in the English language, though "ecstasy" is the closest translation.&lt;ref&gt;Swami Sarananda, ''Shri Ramakrishna: The Great Master'' (India, Madras, 1952) {{ISBN|81-7120-480-5}} pp 403 &amp; pp 520&lt;/ref&gt; The various translations that have been proposed all refer to an ecstatic state of consciousness, which is attained by channelling the emotions into one-pointed concentration.  For example, in ''[[The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna]]'', the author, M., later identified as [[Mahendranath Gupta]], recounts observing Ramakrishna Paramahamsa's introverted mood in which he became "unconscious of the outer world."&lt;ref&gt;M., ''The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna'', pp. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;  M. later "learnt that this mood is called ''bhava'', ecstasy."&lt;ref&gt;M., ''The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna'', Ramakrishna-Vivekananda Center, 1942, pp. 78; see also Swami Bhaskarananda, ''Meditation, Mind and Patanjali's Yoga'', pp. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Bhava" denotes the mood of ecstasy and self-surrender which is induced by the maturing of devotion to one's '''Ishta deva' '' (object of devotion).&lt;ref&gt;Lt. Gen. Hanut Singh, ''Shri Shri Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj: Life &amp; Spiritual Ministration,'' pp. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;  "[[Bhava]]" literally means feeling, emotion, mood, or devotional state of mind. This refers to the aspirant's emotional life, which in the practice of ''jnana'' or ''raja'' yoga is controlled in order to transcend the spheres of the mind and intellect. In ''bhakti'' yoga, however, ''bhava'' is neither controlled nor suppressed, but is transformed into devotion and channelled to the Lord."&lt;ref&gt;Definition can be found at [http://www.tarayogacentre.co.uk/glossary.html Tara Yoga Center] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127074505/http://www.tarayogacentre.co.uk/glossary.html |date=January 27, 2010 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Swami Sivananda]] states it is an "internal feeling" that needs to be developed through proper practice just like any other faculty of the mind e.g. memory or will power.&lt;ref&gt;See Swami Sivananda [http://www.sivanandaonline.org/public_html/?cmd=displaysection&amp;section_id=1526 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ramakrishna Paramahamsa real bhava can only be said to occur when the relationship with the Divine is so established that it remains fixed in our consciousness at all times, "whether eating, drinking, sitting or sleeping." &lt;ref&gt;Swami Saradananda, ''Shri Ramakrishna: The Great Master'' (India, Madras, 1952) {{ISBN|81-7120-480-5}} pp432&lt;/ref&gt;

Only when the ''bhava'' has fully ripened does the ''sadhaka'' (spiritual seeker) experience "''bhava samadhi''." &lt;ref&gt;Lt. Gen. Hanut Singh, ''Shri Shri Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj: Life &amp; Spiritual Ministration,'' pp. 109. and Swami Devananda, Meditation and mantra, Motilal Banarsidass, 1978, pp258&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bhava samadhi'' occurs when the emotions are perfectly channelled into one-pointed concentration on the object of one's devotion.&lt;ref&gt;Shri Shiva Rudra Balayogi, "The Path Supreme," 2010 page 160&lt;/ref&gt;   It has also been described as "Absorption in meditation due to emotional cause, e.g. ''kirtan'' [devotional music]"&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.padma.org.uk/tiki/tiki-index.php?page=Yoga%20Glossary here].&lt;/ref&gt; and "sheer ecstasy, a condition caused when the heart is seized by the Divine embrace."&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.russillpaul.com/articles/article/1162814/10603.htm here] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113175841/http://www.russillpaul.com/articles/article/1162814/10603.htm |date=January 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Devotional practices that can evoke ''bhava'', such as "bhajans" and ''kirtan'' (spiritual music), are standard practices in the ''bhakti'' tradition, and in the missions of many Indian saints including Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and [[Shivabalayogi]] Maharaj.  Shri Shivabalayogi often used the words "bhava" and "bhava samadhi" interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas L. Palotas, ''Divine Play, the Silent Teaching of Shivabalayogi'', p 203.&lt;/ref&gt; He explained ''bhava'' as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Everyone is in some sort of ''bhava'' of the guru because of their attachment to the guru. The mind's attachment and devotion is the true ''bhava''."&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Young, ''Guru-Disciple,'' pp. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;
“Bhava is the beginning for samadhi and tapas. Higher souls induce it. Bhava helps in physical, mental, and spiritual progress."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas L. Palotas, ''Swamiji's Treasure, God Realization and Experiences of Shivabalayogi'' pp. 324-5.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The qualities required for a genuine bhava samadhi have been emphasized by Ramakrishna Paramahamsa when he said that a spiritual experience of a lower plane may be had by "the momentary exuberance of emotions" but the scriptures say bhava samadhi is impossible to retain unless worldly desires have been removed and proper qualities have been established like renunciation and detachment.&lt;ref&gt;Swami Saradananda, ''Shri Ramakrishna: The Great Master'' (India, Madras, 1952) {{ISBN|81-7120-480-5}} pp 520&lt;/ref&gt;

== Misuse and controversy ==

There have been many misuses and controversies associated with ''bhava samadhi''.  Firstly, ''bhava'' itself has been mistaken to be an advanced spiritual state, whereas the great exponent of ''bhava samadhi'', Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, made it clear to his disciple, [[Swami Vivekananda]], that ''bhava'' is a preliminary state of consciousness:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Witnessing the religious ecstasy (bhava) of several devotees, Narendra (Swami Vivekananda) one day said to the Master that he too wanted to experience it. 'My child,' he was told, 'when a huge elephant enters a small pond, a great commotion is set up, but when it plunges into the Ganga, the river shows very little agitation. These devotees are like small ponds; a little experience makes their feelings flow over the brim. But you are a huge river.' "&lt;ref&gt;See online [http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/vivekananda_biography/04_training.htm Vivekananda biography]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Several other times Ramakrishna Paramahamsa made the same point like when he told one of his close devotees Gopalchandra Ghosh (later known as [[Disciples of Ramakrishna|Swami Advaitananda]], his most senior monastic disciple) that it was not so important to experience such a temporary ecstasy (bhava) and that on the spiritual path "true faith and renunciation are far greater."&lt;ref&gt;Swami Saradananda, ''Shri Ramakrishna: The Great Master'' (India, Madras 1952) {{ISBN|81-7120-480-5}} pp 403&lt;/ref&gt;

That ''bhava'' is a preliminary experience has also been emphasized by Shivabalayogi Maharaj:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"During this all your ''bhava'' (the mind’s feelings) will get concentrated on your favorite deity and thus your mind becomes more concentrated, more single-pointed. Then meditation itself becomes much easier and consequently one would take up meditation more willingly. "It's like giving chocolate to a child to make it go to school. But one should not settle just for the chocolate - one must go on to school. In the same way, one must meditate."&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Young, ''Guru-Disciple'' pp. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Secondly, people have falsely claimed to have spontaneously attained spiritual powers and experiences through ''bhava'', whereas ''bhava samadhi'' is the culmination of a long period of devotional practice.&lt;ref&gt;Lt. Gen. Hanut Singh, ''Shri Shri Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj: Life &amp; Spiritual Ministration,'' pp. 109, and [http://www.shivarudrabalayogi.org/his-teachings teachings of Shri Shiva Rudra Balayogi].&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Bhava'' has even been used by people to falsely claim that they are "possessed by sacred deities" and to issue orders on behalf of these deities.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Young, ''Guru-Disciple'' pp. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; If the ''bhava'' is genuine, however, the person will become non-violent and introverted, and will not claim or give instructions through ''bhava''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shivarudrabalayogi.org/his-teachings Teachings of Shri Shiva Rudra Balayogi].&lt;/ref&gt; Spiritual efforts should always enable the mind to recede and become quiet, going introverted toward the Self.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shivarudrabalayogi.org/his-teachings Teachings of Shri Shiva Rudra Balayogi].&lt;/ref&gt;  Swami Vivekananda warned ''sadhaks'' (spiritual aspirants) to beware of claims made of ''bhava'' experiences:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
He pointed out that Ramakrishna had been through long years of strictest self discipline and that his ecstasy was a fruit of that discipline, not a superficial emotionalism. "When people try to practice religion," said Naren "eighty percent of them turn into cheats, and about fifteen percent go mad. Its only the remaining five percent who get some direct knowledge of the Truth and so become blessed. So Beware."&lt;ref&gt;Isherwood, C., ''Ramakrishna and His Disciples'', 1980, {{ISBN|978-0-87481-037-0}} pp. 290-291.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thirdly, genuine ''bhava samadhi'', which is an internal state of consciousness, has been identified with outer movements of the body, such as dancing and singing. It has been claimed that "the very nature of ''bhava'' itself - sometimes having such vigorous outward expression in action and movement - had always meant that those who wished attention or status in a group would sometimes simply pretend to be in ''bhava'' to obtain some personal gain."&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Young, ''Guru-Disciple'' pp. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it has been made clear by Ramakrishna that emotional displays do not constitute spiritual experience:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
One evening Subodh (later to become Swami Subodhananda) observed the devotees dancing and singing Kirtan in the Masters room at Dakshineshwar. They were overwhelmed with devotion. Shri Ramakrishna himself joined them and his ecstasy surcharged the whole place with heavenly bliss.  Some were crying, some laughing, some dancing. Others were transfixed like motionless statues, and some began to roll on the floor. Subodh was very skeptical about this kind of emotional display ... [He asked] "who had real ecstasy in the kirtan today?" The Master thought for a while and then said, "Today Latu (later to become [[Swami Adbhutananda]]) alone had the fullest measure of it; some others had sprinklings."&lt;ref&gt;Swami Chetananda, ''God Lived with Them'' {{ISBN|81-7505-198-1}}, 1997, pp. 536-537.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The depth of ''bhava'' experience varies across different individuals and depends on the spiritual maturity of their minds.&lt;ref&gt;Lt. Gen. Hanut Singh, ''Shri Shri Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj: Life &amp; Spiritual Ministration,'' pp. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; Mature ''sadhaks'' usually do not display outward signs of ''bhava'', which are indicative of the depth of their experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Shri Shiva Rudra Balayogi "The Path Supreme" 2010 page 160, Lt. Gen. Hanut Singh, Shri Shri Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj: Life &amp; Spiritual Ministration, pp. 109-110.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of devotees attempting to make claims about their inner state of consciousness by imitating external indicators of genuine ''bhava samadhi'' was addressed by Swami Vivekananda in the Ramakrishna Mission:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It was discovered that several were actually trying to induce the outer physical symptoms of ''Samadhi'' and also imitate the movements of one who is dancing in ecstasy. Naren reasoned with these devotees and persuaded them to stop starving themselves and eat wholesome food, and to try control their emotions instead of cultivating hysteria. The result was an increase in spirituality and a decrease in outer show.&lt;ref&gt;Isherwood, C., ''Ramakrishna and His Disciples'' Vedanta Press, 1980, {{ISBN|978-0-87481-037-0}}, pp. 290-291.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The actions of people in bhava samadhi, like dancing in ecstasy, can appear very strange to some. In Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj's mission various levels of bhava occurred to hundreds of people. Bhava was controversial throughout Shivabalayogi's public programs, and his own statements on the phenomenon appear inconsistent. Although some were acting or misusing the experience, when people complained to Sri Shivabalayogi, he was intolerant of most criticism or interference. "It is not drama. It really happens."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas L. Palotas, ''Divine Play, the Silent Teaching of Shivabalayogi'', p 203, &amp; ''Swamiji's Treasure, God Realization &amp; Experiences of Shivabalayogi'', pp 326-7 &amp; 348.&lt;/ref&gt;

To place bhava samadhi into the correct spiritual context Ramakrishna Paramahansa said,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"If the depth of spiritual experiences is to be measured, it must be done from observing one's steadfastness, renunciation, strength of character, the attenuation of desires for enjoyment etc. It is by this touchstone alone, and no other means, that the amount of dross in ecstacy can be assessed." &lt;ref&gt;Swami Saradananda, ''Shri Ramakrishna: The Great Master'' (India, Madras, 1952) {{ISBN|81-7120-480-5}} pp 405&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Blockingmiserlou.PNG|thumb|right|300px|Note the movement ratio at trial stage 3A]]
[[File:Classical conditioning - blocking.svg|thumb|right|300px|Blocking effect for mice. ''Left:'' pairings of light (CS1) and food (US) causes salivation (CR). ''Unshown:'' after training, CS1 alone causes CR. ''Mid:'' pairing of CS1, tone (CS2), and US causes CR. ''Right:'' CS2 alone doesn't trigger CR.]]
In [[Leon Kamin|Kamin]]'s '''blocking effect'''&lt;ref&gt;Kamin, L.J. (1969). Predictability, surprise, attention and conditioning. In B.A. Campbell &amp; R.M. Church (eds.), ''Punishment and aversive behavior'', 279–96, New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts&lt;/ref&gt; the [[classical conditioning|conditioning]] of an association between two stimuli, a conditioned stimulus (CS) and an unconditioned stimulus (US) is impaired if, during the conditioning process, the CS is presented together with a second CS that has already been associated with the unconditioned stimulus.

For example, an agent (such as a mouse in the figure) is exposed to a light (the first conditioned stimulus, CS1), together with food (the unconditioned stimulus, US). After repeated pairings of CS1 and US, the agent salivates when the light comes on (conditioned response, CR). Then, there are more conditioning trials, this time with the light (CS1) and a tone (CS2) together with the US.  Now, when tested, the agent does not salivate to the tone (CS2).  In other words, an association between the tone CS2 and the US has been "blocked" because the CS1–US association already exists.

This effect was most famously explained by the [[Rescorla–Wagner model]]. The model says, essentially, that if one CS (here the light) already fully predicts that the US will come, nothing will be learned about a second CS (here the tone) that accompanies the first CS. Blocking is an outcome of other models that also base learning on the difference between what is predicted and what actually happens.&lt;ref name = "Bouton" &gt; Bouton, M. E.(2007)  '' Learning and Behavior: A Contemporary Synthesis'' Sunderland, MA: Sinauer  &lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparator==
While some argue that blocking demonstrates that the organism did not learn the association between the CS2 and the US, this is not necessarily the case. For instance, after a traditional blocking paradigm, the CS2 does not elicit a response (alone). However, if the response to the CS1 is extinguished, the organism will begin to respond to CS2 alone. This demonstrates that the association between the CS2 and the US was initially learned but in comparison to the stronger predictive value of the CS1 there is no conditioned response. However, after extinction, the CS2 does have more predictive value than the now extinguished CS1.&lt;ref&gt;Blaisdell, A., Gunther, L. &amp; Miller, R. (1999). Recovery from blocking achieved by extinguishing the blocking CS. Animal Learning &amp; Behavior, 27, 63-76.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this finding was not replicated in a later, similar study.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, P. (1999). Overshadowing and blocking as acquisition deficits: No recovery after extinction of overshadowing or blocking cues. The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, 52B, 307-333.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Backward blocking==
The reverse of blocking is often called backward blocking. In backward blocking, the subject is exposed to the compound stimulus (CS1 and CS2 together) first, and only later to CS1 alone. In some human and animal studies, subjects show a reduction in the association between CS2 and the US, though the effect is often weaker than the standard blocking effect, and vanishes under some conditions. This effect is not predicted by the [[Rescorla–Wagner model]] although other models have been proposed that capture this effect.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole section|date=February 2016}}

==Robustness of the effect==

Maes and colleagues reported fifteen experiments that attempted to replicate the blocking effect. None of them succeeded despite using procedures well-established in previous literature.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4901">In [[theoretical computer science]], a '''certifying algorithm''' is an algorithm that outputs, together with a solution to the problem it solves, a proof that the solution is correct. A certifying algorithm is said to be ''efficient'' if the combined runtime of the algorithm and a proof checker is slower by at most a constant factor than the best known non-certifying algorithm for the same problem.&lt;ref name="mmns"&gt;{{citation

The proof produced by a certifying algorithm should be in some sense simpler than the algorithm itself, for otherwise any algorithm could be considered certifying (with its output verified by running the same algorithm again). Sometimes this is formalized by requiring that a verification of the proof take less time than the original algorithm, while for other problems (in particular those for which the solution can be found in [[linear time]]) simplicity of the output proof is considered in a less formal sense.&lt;ref name="mmns"/&gt; For instance, the validity of the output proof may be more apparent to human users than the correctness of the algorithm, or a checker for the proof may be more amenable to [[formal verification]].&lt;ref name="mmns"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Implementations of certifying algorithms that also include a checker for the proof generated by the algorithm may be considered to be more reliable than non-certifying algorithms. For, whenever the algorithm is run, one of three things happens: it produces a correct output (the desired case), it detects a bug in the algorithm or its implication (undesired, but generally preferable to continuing without detecting the bug), or both the algorithm and the checker are faulty in a way that masks the bug and prevents it from being detected (undesired, but unlikely as it depends on the existence of two independent bugs).&lt;ref name="mmns"/&gt;

==Examples==
Many examples of problems with checkable algorithms come from [[graph theory]].
For instance, a classical algorithm for testing whether a graph is [[bipartite graph|bipartite]] would simply output a Boolean value: true if the graph is bipartite, false otherwise. In contrast, a certifying algorithm might output a 2-coloring of the graph in the case that it is bipartite, or a cycle of odd length if it is not. Any graph is bipartite if and only if it can be 2-colored, and non-bipartite if and only if it contains an odd cycle. Both checking whether a 2-coloring is valid and checking whether a given odd-length sequence of vertices is a cycle may be performed more simply than testing bipartiteness.&lt;ref name="mmns"/&gt;

Analogously, it is possible to test whether a given directed graph is [[directed acyclic graph|acyclic]] by a certifying algorithm that outputs either a [[topological sorting|topological order]] or a directed cycle. It is possible to test whether an undirected graph is a [[chordal graph]] by a certifying algorithm that outputs either an elimination ordering (an ordering of all vertices such that, for every vertex, the neighbors that are later in the ordering form a [[Clique (graph theory)|clique]]) or a chordless cycle. And it is possible to test whether a graph is [[planar graph|planar]] by a certifying algorithm that outputs either a planar embedding or a [[Kuratowski's theorem|Kuratowski subgraph]].&lt;ref name="mmns"/&gt;

The [[extended Euclidean algorithm]] for the [[greatest common divisor]] of two integers {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} is certifying: it outputs three integers {{mvar|g}} (the divisor), {{mvar|a}}, and {{mvar|b}}, such that {{math|''ax'' + ''by'' {{=}} ''g''}}. This equation can only be true of multiples of the greatest common divisor, so testing that {{mvar|g}} is the greatest common divisor may be performed by checking that {{mvar|g}} divides both {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} and that this equation is correct.&lt;ref name="mmns"/&gt;

'''Deductive closure''' is a [[property (philosophy)|property]] of a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of [[object (philosophy)|objects]] (usually the objects in question are [[statement (logic)|statement]]s). A [[set (mathematics)|set]] of objects, &lt;var&gt;O&lt;/var&gt;, is said to exhibit ''closure'' or to be ''closed'' under a given [[closure operator|operation]], &lt;var&gt;R&lt;/var&gt;, provided that for every object, &lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;, if &lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt; is a member of &lt;var&gt;O&lt;/var&gt; and &lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt; is &lt;var&gt;R&lt;/var&gt;-related to any object, &lt;var&gt;y&lt;/var&gt;, then &lt;var&gt;y&lt;/var&gt; is a member of &lt;var&gt;O&lt;/var&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter D. Klein]], ''Closure'', ''[[The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy]] (second edition)&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of statements, a deductive closure is the set of all the statements that can be [[Deductive reasoning|deduced]] from a given set of statements.

In [[propositional calculus|propositional logic]], the set of all true propositions exhibits '''deductive closure''': if set &lt;var&gt;O&lt;/var&gt; is the set of true propositions, and operation &lt;var&gt;R&lt;/var&gt; is [[logical consequence]] (“&lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt;”), then provided that proposition &lt;var&gt;p&lt;/var&gt; is a member of &lt;var&gt;O&lt;/var&gt; and &lt;var&gt;p&lt;/var&gt; is &lt;var&gt;R&lt;/var&gt;-related to &lt;var&gt;q&lt;/var&gt; (i.e., p&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;q), &lt;var&gt;q&lt;/var&gt; is also a member of &lt;var&gt;O&lt;/var&gt;.

== Epistemic closure ==
{{main|Epistemic closure}}

In [[epistemology]], many philosophers have and continue to debate whether particular subsets of [[proposition]]s—especially ones ascribing [[knowledge]] or [[Theory of justification|justification]] of a [[belief]] to a subject—are closed under deduction.

'''Ecological land classification''' is a cartographical delineation or [[regionalisation]] of distinct [[ecology|ecological]] areas, identified by their [[geology]], [[topography]], [[soil]]s, [[vegetation]], [[climate]] conditions, living species, [[habitat]]s, water resources, and sometimes also [[wikt:anthropic|anthropic]] factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kellogg|first=Charles|title=A Method for the Classification of Rural Lands for Assessment in Western North Dakota|journal=The Journal of Land &amp; Public Utility Economics|date=February 1933|volume=9|issue=1|page=12|jstor=3138756}}&lt;/ref&gt; These factors control and influence biotic composition and ecological processes.

==Concept==
The expression "ecological land classification" as understood in this article, is approximate with the biogeographical and ecological regionalisations in a scientific context (see [[biogeography#biogeographic units|biogeographic units]]).

However, its actual usage is more approximate with a tool used for [[land management]], in the context of [[environmental resource management]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller, M.R. 1981. ''Ecological land classification terrestrial subsystem: a basic inventory system for planning and management on the Mark Twain National Forest''. USDA Forest Service, Eastern Region. 56 pp., [https://books.google.com/books?id=AOGkpcqyS44C].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, J. C., Bestelmeyer, B. T., McClaran, M. P., Robinett, D., Briske, D. D., Wu, X. B., &amp; Fernández-Giménez, M. E. (2016). Can ecological land classification increase the utility of vegetation monitoring data?. ''Ecological Indicators'' 69: 657-666.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada ecological land classification schemes are commonly used.&lt;ref&gt;Wicken, E. B. 1986. ''Terrestrial ecozones of Canada. Environment Canada''. Ecological Land Classification Series No. 19. Lands Directorate, Ottawa. 26 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Provincial authorities have adopted methods to classify [[Ecosystem|ecosystems]] within various ecoregions of the province. Ontario is one such province that uses an extensive method to define [[ecological unit]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/LUEPS/Publication/264779.html].&lt;/ref&gt; Improvements in hand held technology have allowed for more efficient collection of vegetation and physiological data in the field, such as with the ELC eTool.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecosim.ca/ELCWebApp/ecological_land_classification/ELC_eTool.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification types==
Many different lists and ecological land classification schemes have been developed.&lt;ref&gt;Part of the list proposed below is inspired by [[Miklos Udvardy]] ''classification of the Biographical Provinces in the World'' which was prepared by Unesco's Man and the Biosphere program, published in 1975 and updated in 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Udvardy, M. D. F. (1975). ''A classification of the biogeographical provinces of the world''. IUCN Occasional Paper no. 18. Morges, Switzerland: IUCN, [http://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/udvardy.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pcap-sk.org/docs/6_skecositeguide/Ecoregions_and_Ecosites.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Biogeography]] - Biogeographical provinces take into account both flora and fauna.
*[[Phytogeography]] - from Greek words phyto = [[plant]] and [[geography]] meaning also distribution, concerned with the geographic distribution of [[plant species]].
*[[Botany]] - botanists have identified [[floristic province]]s based on [[flora]]-[[plant community|plant communities]]
*[[Zoology]] - zoologists have identified zoogeographic provinces based on [[fauna]]l communities.
*[[Conservation ethic|Conservation]] - approximating ecosystem capacity and potentials.
*[[Geology]] and [[Pedology (soil study)]] - the physical matter and energy that constitute the Earth.

=== Approaches to classifications===

American geographer [[Robert Bailey (geographer)|Robert Bailey]] defines a hierarchy of ecosystem units ranging from micro-ecosystems (individual homogeneous sites, in the order of {{convert|10|km2|0}} in area), through meso-ecosystems ([[landscape ecology|landscape mosaics]], in the order of {{convert|1000|km2|-2}}) to macro-ecosystems ([[ecoregions]], in the order of {{convert|100000|km2|-4}}).&lt;ref name="BaileyCh2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ecosystem Geography|last=Bailey|first=Robert G.|publisher=Springer|year=2009|isbn=978-0-387-89515-4|edition=Second|location=New York|pages=25-28|chapter=Chapter 2}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Bailey outlined five different methods for identifying ecosystems: ''[[Holism|gestalt]]'' ("a whole that is not derived through considerable of its parts"), in which regions are recognized and boundaries drawn intuitively; a map overlay system where different layers like [[geology]], [[landform]]s and soil types are overlain to identify ecosystems; [[Cluster analysis|multivariate clustering]] of site attributes; [[digital image processing]] of [[remote sensing|remotely sensed]] data grouping areas based on their appearance or other [[Multispectral image|spectral]] properties; or by a "controlling factors method" where a subset of factors (like soils, climate, vegetation [[physiognomy]] or the [[species distribution|distribution]] of plant or animal species) are selected from a large array of possible ones are used to delineate ecosystems.&lt;ref name="BaileyCh3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ecosystem Geography|last=Bailey|first=Robert G.|publisher=Springer|year=2009|isbn=978-0-387-89515-4|edition=Second|location=New York|pages=29–40|chapter=Chapter 3}} &lt;/ref&gt; 

In contrast with Bailey's methodology, Puerto Rico ecologist [[Ariel Lugo]] and coauthors identified ten characteristics of an effective classification system. For example that it be based on [[georeference]]d, quantitative data; that it should minimize subjectivity and explicitly identify criteria and assumptions; that it should be structured around the factors that drive ecosystem processes; that it should reflect the hierarchical nature of ecosystems; that it should be flexible enough to conform to the various scales at which ecosystem management operates.&lt;ref name="Lugo1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lugo|first=A. E.|author2=S.L. Brown |author3=R. Dodson |author4=T.S. Smith |author5= H.H.

'''Elaboration''' is the s of adding more information to existing, relatively simple information to create a more complex, [[Emergent properties|emergent]] whole. It involves developing an idea by incorporating details to amplify the original simple idea. Elaboration enhances ideas and objects by providing nuance and detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://people.bethel.edu/~shenkel/PhysicalActivities/CreativeMovement/CreativeThinking/Torrance.html |title=Torrance Framework for Creative Thinking |author=Torrance, P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.specialconnections.ku.edu/?q=instruction/cognitive_strategies/teacher_tools/elaboration_strategies |title=Elaboration Strategies |author=KU}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elaboration may involve [[planning]] or executing a task with painstaking attention to numerous parts or details.

==Examples of elaboration in other fields==
In the [[law]], a [[bill of particulars]] is an elaboration of allegations, theories of law, and facts contained in another [[pleading]], such as a complaint, answer, or reply.

In [[mathematics]], an [[iteration]] is the elaboration of a [[Function (mathematics)|function]].

'''''Esoteric Buddhism''''' is a book originally published in 1883 in London; it was compiled by a member of the [[Theosophical Society]], [[Alfred Percy Sinnett|A. P. Sinnett]].{{sfn|Formats and editions}}{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=154}} It was one of the first books written for the purpose explain of the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]] for the wide range of readers,{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=197}} and was "made up of the [[Mahatma Letters|author's correspondence]] with an [[Koot Hoomi|Indian mystic]]."{{sfn|WorldCat Identities}} This is the most significant theosophical work of the author. According to [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke|Goodrick-Clarke]], it "disseminated the basic teachings of Theosophy in its new Asian cast."{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=12}}{{refn|group=note|"His [Sinnett's] second book, ''Esoteric Buddhism,'' an outline of some of the main teachings of theosophy, attracted much attention and served as a harbinger of [[Helena Blavatsky|H.P.B.'s]] monumental work, ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]''."{{sfn|Ryan|1975|loc=Ch. 9}}}}

== From history of compilation ==
Through the mediation of [[Helena Blavatsky|Blavatsky]]{{refn|group=note|P. Washington wrote that Blavatsky with Sinnett and his wife Patience has been in sincere friendship.{{sfn|Washington|1995|loc=Ch. 3}}}} Sinnett began a correspondence in 1880 with the two adepts, who sponsored the Theosophical Society, the [[mahatma]]s [[Kuthumi]] and [[Morya (Theosophy)|Morya]].{{sfn|Theosopedia}}{{refn|group=note|Goodrick-Clarke wrote that "the very concept of the [[mahatma|Masters]]" is the [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucian]] idea of "invisible and secret adepts, working for the advancement of humanity."{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=6}} And Tillett stated: "The concept of Masters or Mahatmas as presented by [[Helena Blavatsky|HPB]] involved a mixture of western and eastern ideas; she located most of them in India or Tibet. Both she and Colonel [[Henry Steel Olcott|Olcott]] claimed to have seen and to be in communication with Masters. In Western [[occultism]] the idea of 'Supermen' has been found in such schools as... the fraternities established by [[Martinez de Pasqually|de Pasqually]] and [[Louis Claude de Saint-Martin|de Saint-Martin]]."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=966}}}} [[Olav Hammer|Hammer]] noted that between 1880 and 1884 Sinnett received from the mahatmas circa one hundred twenty letters with explanation of "[[occult]] cosmology". From this material, he attempted to formulate in his new book "the basis of a revised theosophy."{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=381}} By foundation of the book became "Cosmological notes" received from the Mahatma Morya{{sfn|Barker|1924|loc=Letters 12, 13}} together with a long series of answers to questions sent by mahatma Kuthumi{{sfn|Barker|1924|loc=Letters 14–18}} during the summer of 1882.{{sfn|Hanson|1980|loc=Ch. IX}}&lt;br/&gt;[[Tallapragada Subba Row|Subba Row]] received from his Master mahatma Morya the instruction to provide assistance to Sinnett in his work on the book, but, according to the memoirs of the author, he did it reluctantly, and what little help. The main help came from the mahatmas through Blavatsky in the form of answers to the questions referred to her by the author.{{sfn|Sinnett|1986|p=23}}

In preface to the original edition author says that [[exoteric]] [[Buddhism]] "has remained in closer union with the [[esoteric]] doctrine" than any other [[Major religious groups|world religion]]. Thus, specification of the "inner knowledge" addressed to modern readers will be connected with the familiar features of the Buddhist teaching. Sinnett argues that esoteric teaching "be most conveniently studied in its Buddhist aspect."{{Sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=xviii}}{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=123}}

=== Esoteric teachers ===
At the beginning of the first chapter the author makes the following statement:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I am bringing to my readers knowledge which I have obtained by favour{{refn|group=note|[[Mahatma Letters|Letters from mahatmas]] formed the basis of two theosophical books by Sinnett.{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=61}}}} rather than by effort. It will not be found the less valuable on that account; I venture, on the contrary, to declare that it will be found of incalculably greater value, easily as I have obtained it, than any results in a similar direction which I could possibly have procured by ordinary methods of research."{{Sfnm|Sinnett|1885|1p=1|Лесевич|1887|2p=16}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
On the question of the whereabouts of his teachers Sinnett says that for a long time in [[Tibet]] there is a "certain secret region," hitherto unknown and inaccessible to ordinary people and for those living in the surrounding mountains as well as for visitors, "in which adepts have always congregated. But the country generally was not in Buddha's time, as it has since become, the chosen habitation of the great brotherhood. Much more than they are at present, were the Mahatmas in former times, distributed about the world." But the development of civilization has led to the fact that many occultists gathered in Tibet. The system of rules and laws for them has been developed in the 14th century by [[Je Tsongkhapa|Tsong-ka-pa]].{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|pp=181–182}}{{sfn|Lopez|1999|p=50}}

=== The constitution of man ===
The author argues that "a complete, or perfect man" is made up of [[Septenary (Theosophy)|seven elements]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
#The [[Physical body|Physical Body]] (''[[Rūpa]]'').
#Vitality (''[[Prana]]'', or ''Jiva'').
#[[Subtle body|Astral Body]] (''Linga Sharira'').
#Animal [[Soul]] ([[Kāma|''Kāma Rūpa'']]).
#Human Soul ([[Manas (early Buddhism)|''Manas'']]).
#Spiritual Soul (''[[Buddhi]]'').
#[[Spirit]] ([[Ātman (Buddhism)|''Ātma'']]).{{Sfnm|Sinnett|1885|1p=24|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|2p=17}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== The world periods ===
A French philosopher [[René Guénon]] stated that the central place of the Theosophical doctrine [which there is in Sinnett's book] is occupied the "idea of evolution." He then wrote that, according to the Theosophical teaching, there are
&lt;blockquote&gt;"seven '[[Root race|mother-races]]' succeed one another in the course of a 'world period', that is to say while the 'wave of life' sojourns on a given planet. Each 'race' includes seven 'sub-races', each of which is divided into seven 'branches'. On the other hand, the 'wave of life' successively runs through seven globes in a '[[Round (Theosophy)|round]]', and this 'round' is repeated seven times in a same 'planetary chain', after which the 'wave of life' passes to another 'chain', composed likewise of seven planets which will be traversed seven times in their turn. Thus there are seven 'chains' in a 'planetary system', also called an 'enterprise of evolution'; and finally, our solar system is formed of ten 'planetary systems'... We are presently in the fifth 'race' of our 'world period', and in the fourth 'round' of the 'chain' of which the earth forms part and in which it occupies the fourth rank. This 'chain' is also the fourth of our 'planetary system'."{{sfnm|Sinnett|1885|1pp=55, 131|Guénon|2004|2p=98}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Man after death ===
In the fifth chapter of his book, Sinnett explains the fate of man after death. Of the seven components that make up our personality, the three lower at the time of physical death, moving away from us.{{Sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=77}}{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=466}} The four upper components move on [[Astral plane|Kama loca]], and "from there [soul] proceed to Devachan, a kind of theosophical version of heaven." (The analogy should not be carried overly; Sinnett argues that Devachan is a state, not a place.{{Sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=81}}{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=466}}) Then these four components divide themselves, the law of [[karma]] specifies that it will happen to them—different souls receive different devachanic experience. Only after a long stay in this state, the soul [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|reincarnates]].{{refn|group=note|"The lower four, or quaternary, are transitory, while the upper triad is related to the eternal element in man, his real nature and identity with the universal soul."{{Sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=24}}{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=17}}}} New incarnations on the [[Physical plane|earth plane]] are actually rather rare, "but re-birth in less than fifteen hundred years is spoken of as almost impossible."{{Sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=98}}{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=466}}

Sinnett says that the mediums contact with the inhabitants of Devachan, but very rare, and in this time occurs the following:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The spirit of the [[Psychic|sensitive]], getting odylized,{{sfn|Melton|2001}} so to say, by the [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]] of the spirit in the Devachan, ''becomes'' for a few minutes that departed personality, and writes in the handwriting of the latter, in his language and in his thoughts, as they were during his lifetime. The two spirits become blended in one, and the preponderance of one over the other during such phenomena determines the preponderance of personality in the characteristic exhibited. Thus it may incidentally be observed, what is called ''[[rapport]],'' is, in plain fact, an identity of molecular vibration between the astral part of the incarnate medium and the astral part of the disincarnate personality."{{Sfnm|Sinnett|1885|1p=95|Hammer|2003|2p=467}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Occult philosophy ===
[[File:Man on planet.jpg|thumb|left|220px|&lt;center&gt;Diagram "Man on a Planet".{{refn|group=note|"Man evolves in seven major or root-races; 49 minor races; and the subordinate races or offshoots. The arrow indicates the direction taken by the evolutionary impulse.&lt;br/&gt;
I, II, III, IV, etc., are the seven major or [[root race|root-races]].&lt;br/&gt;
1, 2, 3, etc., are the minor races.&lt;br/&gt;
a, a, a, are the subordinate or offshoot races.&lt;br/&gt;
N, the initial and terminal point of evolution on the planet.&lt;br/&gt; 
S, the axial point where the development equilibrates or adjusts itself in each race evolution.&lt;br/&gt; 
E, the equatorial points wherein the descending arc intellect overcomes spirituality and in the ascending arc spirituality outstrips intellect.&lt;br/&gt;
A word or two [globe, earth] added to make it apply as well  to a whole manwantaric chain of worlds."{{sfn|Barker|1924|loc=Letter 14}}}}&lt;/center&gt;]]
Lavoie noted that in Sinnett's book there are the two major questions – "the structure of the universe and [[spiritual evolution]]." He selected "some key terms" in the book.{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=197}}

[[Avīci|'''Avitchi''']] is a state "of punishment reached only in exceptional cases and by exceptional natures." The usual man will work his karma out in a new [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|incarnation]].{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=93}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=197}}&lt;br/&gt;
[[Sukhavati|'''Devachan''']] is a state of greatest bliss where "the levels of intensity and the duration of stay are based on the karma one produces in his/her lifetime."{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=92}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=197}}&lt;br/&gt;
'''Eighth sphere''' is a planet associated with our planetary chain that is more materialistic than the earth.{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=113}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=197}} The Soul in the mean of the fifth round "can be sent to the eighth sphere for annihilation if it has developed a positive attraction to materialism and a repulsion of spirituality."{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=162}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=197}}&lt;br/&gt;
[[Astral plane|'''Kama loca''']] is "an unconscious state of gestation. It is here that the fourth principle (the animal soul) is separated from the others." The fourth component and some of the fifth component stays in Kama loca while "the rest of the principles continue on in their spiritual evolution."{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|pp=100–101}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=198}} The Ego's duration in Kama loca can last from few moments to years.{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=97}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=198}}&lt;br/&gt;
'''[[Manvantara]]''' is a period of activity or manifestation.{{sfn|Glossary|1999}} There are three different manvantaras: 1) the mahamanvantara, 2) the solar manvantara, 3) the minor manvantara.{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|pp=196–197}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=198}}&lt;br/&gt;
[[Monad (philosophy)|'''Monad''']] is upper triad of the seven principles of man (Atma-Buddhi-Manas).{{sfn|Glossary|1999}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=198}}&lt;br/&gt;
'''[[Pralaya]]''' is a state of nonbeing.{{sfn|Glossary|1999}} "Pralaya is described by Sinnett as a type of sleep, rest, or a time of inactivity." There are three different pralayas: 1) the mahapralaya, 2) the solar pralaya, 3) the minor pralaya.{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|pp=196–197}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=198}}&lt;br/&gt;
[[Round (Theosophy)|'''Round''']] is a full turnover via the seven globes. "During each round there is a maximum of 120 incarnations for each monad in each race with the average of 8,000 years between incarnations."{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=143}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=198}}

Man begins as a monad and dwells in seven major races on each of the seven planets. Each race takes circa one million years. Only 12,000 of those will be used for objective existence on the planets. The rest of that time will be used mainly in a subjective existence on the [[Mental plane|devachanic plane]]. "This meant that out of one million years – 988,000 years are spent reaping the effects of karma."{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|pp=142–143}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=199}}{{refn|group=note|In ''Mahatma Letters'' (letter 14) this number is "slightly different."{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=244}} The letter states that man "has passed in all his lives upon our planet (in this Round) but 77,700 years he has been in the subjective spheres 922,300 years."{{sfn|Barker|1924|loc=Letter 14}}}} A branch race is one of seven belonging to a subrace, itself one of seven belonging to a main race. "If each monad in each race incarnates once, the total number of incarnations in each globe would be 343 (7 branch races x 7 subraces x 7 [[root race]]s); however, each monad incarnates typically at a minimum of two times and some even more frequently."{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|pp=60–61, 140}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=199}} In ''Mahatma Letters'' it is said that "one life in each of the seven root-races; seven lives in each of the 49 sub-races – or 7 x 7 x 7 = 343 and add 7 more. And then a series of lives in offshoot and branchlet races; making the total incarnations of man in each station or planet 777."{{sfn|Barker|1924|loc=Letter 14}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=244}}

=== Theosophical Buddha ===
The ninth chapter of Sinnett's book called "Buddha". It begins with the words:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The historical Buddha, as known to the custodians of the esoteric doctrine, is a personage whose birth is not invested with the quaint marvels popular story has crowded round it. Nor was his progress to adeptship traced by the literal occurrence of the supernatural struggles depicted in symbolic legend. On the other hand, the incarnation, which may outwardly be described as the birth of Buddha, is certainly not regarded by occult science as an event like any other birth, nor the spiritual development through which Buddha passed during his earth-life a mere process of intellectual evolution, like the mental history of any other philosopher. The mistake which ordinary European writers make in dealing with a problem of this sort lies in their inclination to treat exoteric legend either as a record of a miracle about which no more need be said, or as pure myth, putting merely a fantastic decoration on a remarkable life."{{Sfnm|Sinnett|1885|1p=167|Lopez|2008|2pр=187–188}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to [[Donald S. Lopez Jr.|Lopez]], author of ''Esoteric Buddhism'' "has a broader view of the Buddha" than that of Western Buddhologists and scholars of Oriental studies. Sinnett stated that the Buddha is simply one of a row "of adepts who have appeared over the course of the centuries."{{Sfn|Lopez|2008|p=189}} Buddha's next incarnation happened approximately sixty years after his death. He appeared as [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]], the well-known Vedantic philosopher. Sinnett noted that for the uninitiated it is known that date of Shankara's birth is one thousand years after Buddha's death, and that he was hostile to Buddhism. Sinnett wrote that the Buddha came as Shankara "to fill up some gaps and repair certain errors in his own previous teaching."{{Sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=176}} The Buddha had leaved "from the practice of earlier adepts by opening the path" to adeptship to men of all [[caste]]s. "Although well-intentioned, this led" to a deterioration of occult knowledge when it was penetrated into ignominious hands.{{Sfn|Lopez|2008|p=189}} Sinnett wrote that to further appeared a need "to take no candidates except from the class which, on the whole, by reason of its hereditary advantages, is likely to be the best nursery of fit candidates."{{Sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=177}}&lt;br/&gt;Sinnett claimed that the  Buddha's next incarnation was as the great Tibetan adept reformer of the 14th century Tsong-ka-pa.{{Sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=181}}

=== Against blind faith ===
In the tenth chapter Sinnett expresses (as well as the Mahatmas) his very negative attitude to religiosity of any kind. He argues:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Nothing can produce more disastrous effects on human progress, as regards the destiny of individuals, than the very prevalent notion that one religion followed out in a pious spirit, is as good as another, and that if such and such doctrines are perhaps absurd when you look into them, the great majority of good people will never think of their absurdity, but will recite them in a blamelessly devoted attitude of mind."{{Sfnm|Sinnett|1885|1pp=194–195|Guénon|2004|2p=126}}{{refn|group=note|"It is priestly imposture that rendered these gods so terrible to man; it is religion that makes of him the selfish bigot, the fanatic that hates all mankind out of his own sect without rendering him any better or more moral for it. It is the belief in God and gods that makes two-thirds of humanity the slaves of a handful of those who deceive them under the false pretence of saving them. &lt;...&gt; In our [Tibetan] temples there is neither a god nor gods worshipped, only the thrice sacred memory of the greatest as the holiest [[Gautama Buddha|''man'']] that ever lived."{{sfn|Barker|1924|loc=Letter 10}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Criticism ==
The presence of a secret or esoteric teaching in Buddhism is "not accepted by orthodox Buddhist."{{sfn|Harris}} For example, [[Thomas Rhys Davids|Rhys Davids]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In this connection, I shall doubtless be expected to say a few words on Theosophy, if only because one of the books giving an account of that very curious and widely spread movement has been called ''Esoteric Buddhism.'' It has always been a point of wonder to me why the author should have chosen this particular title for his treatise. For if there is anything that can be said with absolute certainty about the book it is, that it is not esoteric, and not Buddhism. The original Buddhism was the very contrary of esoteric."{{sfn|Rhys Davids|1896|pp=209–210}}{{refn|group=note|Nonetheless [[Christmas Humphreys|Humphreys]] wrote that "Buddha's Teaching was not born from a spiritual vacuum, but was an expression of some portion of that Gupta Vidya 'the accumulated Wisdom of the ages', which antedates all known religions."{{sfn|Humphreys|2012|p=23}}&lt;br/&gt;
"'''Gupta-vidya''' (Sanskrit) ''Gupta-vidyā'' [from ''gupta'' from the verbal root ''gup'' to conceal, preserve + ''vidyā'' knowledge, wisdom] Secret knowledge, secret wisdom; the source of all religions and philosophies known to the world: theosophy, the ancient wisdom-religion, the esoteric philosophy."{{sfn|Glossary|1999}}}}{{refn|group=note|Sinnett received instructions from the Tibetan Masters, and Rhys Davids believed that [[Lamaism]] was a Religion not only different from Buddhism, but and being in his time in antagonism with the teachings and the institutions of original Buddhism.{{sfn|Лесевич|1887|p=16}} See also a book by Eva M. Dargyay{{sfn|Dargyay|1979}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[René Guénon|Guénon's]] opinion on the subject was the same. He wrote that never was genuine "esoteric Buddhism." The ancient Buddhism was substantially an exoteric teaching "serving as theoretical support for a social movement with egalitarian tendencies."{{sfn|Guénon|2004|p=93}} According to Guénon, Sinnett, who "at the beginning probably contributed more than anybody else to make [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophism]] known in Europe, was genuinely fooled by all of Mme Blavatsky's tricks."{{sfn|Guénon|2004|p=36}}

Some Theosophists did not share the views presented by Sinnett in his new work; for example, according to [[Anna Kingsford|Kingsford]], this book was very distant from the esoteric, and the main mistake of the author was that he thought about the symbols as reality.{{sfn|Washington|1995|loc=Ch. 4}}

== New editions and translations ==
After its first publication in 1883 the book was reprinted several times: in the same 1883 came 2nd edition, in 1885 – 5th, 1898 – 8th. This work has been translated into several European languages: French, German, Italian, Spanish, Russian.{{sfn|Formats and editions}}{{refn|group=note|"153 editions published between 1883 and 2016 in 8 languages and held by 610 WorldCat member libraries worldwide".{{sfn|WorldCat Identities}}}}

In the field of [[waste management]], '''extended producer responsibility''' ('''EPR''') is a strategy designed to promote the integration of environmental costs associated with goods throughout their life cycles into the market price of the products.&lt;ref&gt;{OECD (2001). ''Extended Producer Responsibility: A Guidance Manual for Governments''. Paris, France.&lt;/ref&gt;  Extended producer responsibility legislation is a driving force behind the adoption of remanufacturing initiatives as it
"focuses on the end-of-use treatment of consumer products and has the primary aim to increase the amount and degree of product recovery and to minimize the environmental impact of waste materials"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Michael R.|last2=McCarthy|first2=Ian P.|date=2014-10-01|title=Product recovery decisions within the context of Extended Producer Responsibility|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0923474813000817|journal=Journal of Engineering and Technology Management|series=Engineering and Technology Management for Sustainable Business Development|volume=34|pages=9–28|doi=10.1016/j.jengtecman.2013.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept was first formally introduced in Sweden by [[Thomas Lindhqvist]] in a 1990 report to the Swedish Ministry of the Environment.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Lindhqvist &amp; Karl Lidgren, "Models for Extended Producer Responsibility," in Sweden, October 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent reports prepared for the Ministry, the following definition emerged: "[EPR] is an environmental protection strategy to reach an environmental objective of a decreased total environmental impact of a product, by making the manufacturer of the product responsible for the entire life-cycle of the product and especially for the take-back, recycling and final disposal.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Lindhqvist, "Towards an [EPR]- analysis of experiences and proposals," April 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

EPR uses financial incentives to encourage manufacturers to design environmentally friendly products by holding producers responsible for the costs of managing their products at end of life. This policy approach, which differs from [[product stewardship]], which shares responsibility across the chain of custody of a product,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Waste to Wealth|title=Extended Producer Responsibility|url=http://www.ilsr.org/recycling/epr/index.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310194722/http://www.ilsr.org/recycling/epr/index.html|archivedate=2012-03-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; attempts to relieve local governments of the costs of managing certain [[priority product]]s by requiring manufacturers internalize the cost of recycling within the product price. EPR is based upon the principle that because producers (usually brand owners) have the greatest control over product design and marketing and these same companies have the greatest ability and responsibility to reduce toxicity and waste.&lt;ref name="Sierra Club"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Sierra Club]]|title=Producer Responsibility Recycling|url=http://www.sierraclub.org/committees/zerowaste/producerresponsibility/index.asp|accessdate=May 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201111452/http://www.sierraclub.org/committees/zerowaste/producerresponsibility/index.asp|archivedate=2008-12-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EPR may take the form of a reuse, buy-back, or recycling program. The producer may also choose to delegate this responsibility to a third party, a so-called ''producer responsibility organization'' (PRO), which is paid by the producer for used-product management. In this way, EPR shifts the responsibility for waste management from government to private industry, obliging producers, importers and/or sellers to internalise waste management costs in their product prices and ensuring the safe handling of their products.&lt;ref&gt;Hanisch, C. (2000). Is Extended Producer Responsibility Effective?. Environ Sci Technol, 34 (7), pp.170 A-175 A.&lt;/ref&gt;

A good example for producer responsibility organizations are the member organizations of PRO EUROPE. PRO EUROPE s.p.r.l. (Packaging Recovery Organisation Europe), founded in 1995, is the umbrella organization for European packaging and packaging waste recovery and recycling schemes. Product stewardship organizations like PRO EUROPE are intended to relieve industrial companies and commercial enterprises of their individual obligation to take back used products through the operation of an organization which fulfills these obligations on a nationwide basis on behalf of their member companies. The aim is to ensure the recovery and recycling of packaging waste in the most economically efficient and ecologically sound manner.  In many countries, this is done through the [[Green Dot (symbol)|Green Dot]]  trademark of which PRO EUROPE is the general licensor. The Green Dot has evolved into a proven concept in many countries as implementation of Producer Responsibility. In twenty-five nations companies are now using the Green Dot as the financing symbol for the organization of recovery, sorting and recycling of sales packaging.

==Take-back==

In response to all of the growing problem of excessive waste, several countries adopted waste management policies in which manufacturers are responsible for taking back their products from end users at the end of the products' useful life, or partially financing a collection and recycling infrastructure. These policies were adopted due to the lack of collection infrastructure for certain products that contain hazardous materials, or due to the high costs to local governments of providing such collection services. The primary goals of these take-back laws therefore are to partner with the private sector to ensure that all wastes are managed in a way that protects public health and the environment.
The goals of take-back laws are to
#encourage companies to design products for reuse, recyclability, and materials reduction;
#correcting market signals to the consumer by incorporating waste management costs into the product’s price;
#promoting innovation in recycling technology.&lt;ref&gt;James Sallzman, Sustainable Consumption and the Law, 27ENVTL. L. 1274 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;
Take-back programs help promote these goals by creating incentives for companies to redesign their products to minimize waste management costs, by designing their products to contain safer materials (so they do not need to be managed separately) or designing products that are easier to recycle and reuse (so recycling becomes more profitable).&lt;ref&gt;Linda Roeder, Hazardous Waste: Advocacy Group Recommendations Promote Manufacturer Responsibility, DAILY ENV”T REP., March 16, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest take-back activity began in Europe, where government-sponsored take-back initiatives arose from concerns about scarce landfill space and potentially hazardous substances in component parts. The European Union adopted a directive on [[WEEE|Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE)]]. The purpose of this directive is to prevent the production of waste electronics and also to encourage reuse and recycling of such waste. The directive requires the Member States to encourage design and production methods that take into account the future dismantling and recovery of their products.&lt;ref&gt;Directive 2002/96/EC of 27 January 2003 on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE), 203 O.J. (l 37) 46&lt;/ref&gt; These take-back programs have been now adopted in nearly every OECD country. In the United States, most of these policies have been implemented at the state level, due to the political impasse at the federal level.

== Plastic bags ==

Recycling, banning, and taxation fails to adequately reduce the pollution caused by plastic bags. An alternative to these policies would be to increase extended producer responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/PageFiles/24472/epr.pdf|title=Extended Producer Responsibility An examination of its impact on innovation and greening products|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, under the Clinton presidency, the President's Council on Sustainable Development suggested EPR in order to target different participants in the cycle of a product's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://clinton2.nara.gov/PCSD/Publications/EPR.html|title=Proceedings - Extended Product Responsibility|website=clinton2.nara.gov|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can, however, make the product more expensive since the cost must be taken into consideration before being put on the market, which is why it is not widely used in the United States currently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Toffel|first=Michael W.|last2=Stein|first2=Antoinette|last3=Lee|first3=Katharine L.|date=2008-01-01|title=Extending Producer Responsibility: An Evaluation Framework for Product Take-Back Policies|url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/hbs/wpaper/09-026.html|publisher=Harvard Business School}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, there is banning or taxation of plastic bags, which puts the responsibility on the consumers. In the United States, EPR has not successfully been made mandatory, instead being voluntary.  What has been recommended is a comprehensive program which combines taxation, producer responsibility, and recycling to combat pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sipa.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/FOR%20PUBLICATION_Ocean%20Conservancy.pdf|archive-url=http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20160624090252/https://sipa.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/FOR%20PUBLICATION_Ocean%20Conservancy.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=June 24, 2016|title=Public Policy Approaches for the Reduction of Plastic Bag Marine Debris|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=November 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electronics==

Many governments and companies have adopted extended producer responsibility to help address the growing problem of [[electronic waste|e-waste]] — used electronics contain materials that cannot be safely thrown away with regular household trash. In 2007, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, people threw away 2.5 million tons of cell phones, TVs, computers, and printers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reagan|first=Robert|date=March 15, 2015|title=A COMPARISON OF E-WASTE EXTENDED PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY LAWS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND CHINA|url=|journal=Vermont Journal of Environmental Law|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many governments have partnered with corporations in creating the necessary collection and recycling infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manufacturer Takeback Programs|url=http://www.electronicstakeback.com/how-to-recycle-electronics/manufacturer-takeback-programs/|publisher=Electronics Takeback Coalition|accessdate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that local and manufacturer-supported extended producer responsibility laws give manufacturers greater responsibility for the reuse, recycling, and disposal of their own products.&lt;ref name="Sierra Club"/&gt;

The kinds of chemicals found in e-waste that are particularly dangerous to human health and the environment are lead, mercury, brominated flame-retardants, and cadmium. Lead is found in the screens of phones, TVs and computer monitors and can damage kidneys, nerves, blood, bones, reproductive organs, and muscles. Mercury is found in the bulbs in flat screen TVs, laptop screens, and fluorescent bulbs, and can cause damage to the kidneys and the nervous system.  Brominated flame-retardants found in cables and plastic cases can cause cancer, disruption of liver function, and nerve damage. Cadmium is found in rechargeable batteries and can cause kidney damage and cancer.  Poorer countries are dumping grounds for the United States' e-waste as many governments accept money for disposing this waste on their lands. This causes increased health risks for people in these countries, especially ones who work or live close to these dumps.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the United States, 25 states have implemented laws that require the recycling of electronic waste. Of those, 23 have incorporated some form of extended producer responsibility into their laws.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.electronicstakeback.com/wp-content/uploads/Lessons-Learned-from-State-E-waste-laws.pdf|title=Ten Lessons Learned from State E-Waste Laws|last=|first=|date=|website=Electronics TakeBack Coalition|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to analysis done by the Product Stewardship Institute, some states have not enacted EPR laws because of a lack of recycling infrastructure and funds for proper e-waste disposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.productstewardship.us/page/State_EPR_Laws_Map|title=Map of State EPR Laws|last=|first=|date=May 2016|website=Product Stewardship Institute|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, according to a study of EPR legislation done by the Electronics TakeBack Coalition, states that have seen success in their e-waste recycling programs have done so because they have developed a convenient e-waste infrastructure or the state governments have instituted goals for manufacturers to meet. Essentially, these EPR programs have included some driver for increased collection of e-waste, and that is why these states have seen a greater impact on proper e-waste disposal than others. 

Advocates for EPR also argue that including "high expectations for performance" into the laws, and ensuring that those are only minimum requirements, contribute to making the laws successful. In this way, manufacturers can be incentivized to collect more and dispose of e-waste more properly.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Finally, the larger the scope of products that can be collected, the more e-waste will be disposed of properly.

Similar laws have been passed in other parts of the world as well. The [[Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive|European Union]] has taken steps to combat the issue of electronic waste management. They have restricted the use of harmful substances in member countries and have made it illegal to export waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/everyday-tech/e-waste1.htm|title=How E-waste Works|last=Toothman|first=Jessika|date=|website=How Stuff Works|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Chinese laws regarding e-waste are similar to the ones in the EU, but they focus on banning the import of e-waste. This has proven to be difficult, however, because illegal smuggling of waste still occurs in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/eight-million-tons-illegal-e-waste-smuggled-china-each-year-180949930/|title=Eight Million Tons of Illegal E-Waste is Smuggled into China Each Year|last=Nuwer|first=Rachel|date=February 28, 2014|website=Smithsonian|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to dispose of e-waste in [[Electronic waste in China|China]] today, a license is required and plants are held responsible for treating pollution.

===Advantages===

When producers either face a financial or physical burden of recycling their electronics after use, they may be incentivized to design more sustainable, less [[electronic waste|toxic]], and easily recyclable electronics.&lt;ref name="Sierra Club"/&gt;&lt;ref name="epa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/epawaste/partnerships/stewardship/basic.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100806123116/http://www.epa.gov/epawaste/partnerships/stewardship/basic.htm |archivedate=2010-08-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="seven"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://72.10.40.168/commentaries/scarlett_20001004.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070812124841/http://72.10.40.168/commentaries/scarlett_20001004.shtml |archivedate=2007-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using fewer materials and designing products to last longer can directly reduce producers' end-of-life costs.&lt;ref name="epa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="epr"&gt;http://www.eprworkinggroup.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, extended producer responsibility is often cited&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Prakash|first=Bhavani|title=The Light Bulb Conspiracy: The Story of Planned Obsolescence|url=http://www.ecowalkthetalk.com/blog/2011/08/26/the-light-bulb-conspiracy-the-story-of-planned-obsolescence/|publisher=Eco Walk the Talk|accessdate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Annie Leonard interview &amp; "Story of Electronics" release|url=http://www.nourishthespirit.com/annie-leonard-interview-story-of-electronics-release/|publisher=Nourish the Spirit|accessdate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as one way to fight [[planned obsolescence]], because it financially encourages manufacturers to design for recycling and make products last longer.

===Disadvantages===
Some people have concerns about extended producer responsibility programs for complex electronics that can be difficult to safely recycle, such as [[Lithium-ion polymer battery|lithium-ion polymer batteries]].&lt;ref name="seven"/&gt; Others worry that such laws could increase the cost of electronics because producers would add recycling costs into the initial price tag.&lt;ref name="seven"/&gt; When companies are required to transport their products to a recycling facility, it can be expensive if the product contains hazardous materials and does not have a scrap value, such as with CRT televisions, which can contain up to five pounds of lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why do CRT monitors contain lead?|url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/question678.htm|publisher=How Stuff Works|accessdate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations and researchers against EPR claim that the mandate would slow innovation and impede technological progress.&lt;ref name="seven"/&gt; 

Other critics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rivera|first=Ray|title=Mayor Calls Electronics Recycling Bill 'Illegal'|url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/15/mayor-says-hell-ignore-veto-on-electronic-recycling/#comment-39647|work=City Room|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; are concerned that manufacturers may use takeback programs to take secondhand electronics off the reuse market, by shredding rather than reusing or repairing goods that come in for recycling. Another argument against EPR is that EPR policies are not accelerating environmentally-friendly designs because "manufacturers are already starting to moving toward reduced material-use per unit of output, reduced energy use in making and delivering each product, and improved environmental performance."&lt;ref&gt;Gattuso, Dana, and Joel Schwartz. "Extended Producer Responsibility." Reason Foundation. Reason Foundation, 1 June 2002. Web. 5 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Reason Foundation]] argues that EPR is not clear in the way fees are established for the particular recycling processes. Fees are set in place to help incentivize recycling, but this may deter the use of manufacturing with better materials for the different electronic products. There are not set fees for certain materials, so confusion occurs when companies do not know what design features to include in their devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://reason.org/studies/show/extended-producer-responsibili|title=Extended Producer Responsibility|last=Schwartz|first=Joel|date=June 1, 2002|website=Reason Foundation|publisher=The Reason Foundation|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==

EPR has been implemented in many forms, which may be classified into three major approaches:
* Mandatory
* Negotiated
* Voluntary

It is perhaps because of the tendency of economic policy in market-driven economies not to interfere with consumers' preferences that the producer-centric representation is the dominant form of viewing the environmental impacts of industrial production: in statistics on energy, emissions, water, etc., impacts are almost always presented as attributes of industries ("on-site" or "direct" allocation) rather than as attributes of the supply chains of products for consumers. On a smaller scale, most existing schemes for [[corporate sustainability]] reporting include only impacts that arise out of operations controlled by the reporting company, and not supply-chain impacts&lt;ref&gt;World Business Council on Sustainable Development an World Resources Institute (2001). The Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Conches-Geneva, Switzerland.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this world view, "upstream and downstream [environmental] impacts are ... allocated to their immediate producers. The institutional setting and the different actors' spheres of influence are not reflected".&lt;ref&gt;Spangenberg, J. H. and S. Lorek (2002). Environmentally sustainable household consumption: from aggregate environmental pressures to priority fields of action. Ecological Economics, 43, pp. 127-140.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, a number of studies have highlighted that final consumption and affluence, especially in the industrialised world, are the main drivers for the level and growth of environmental pressure. Even though these studies provide a clear incentive for complementing producer-focused environmental policy with some consideration for consumption-related aspects, demand-side measures to environmental problems are rarely exploited.&lt;ref&gt;Princen, T. (1999). Consumption and environment: some conceptual issues. Ecological Economics, 31, pp. 347-363.&lt;/ref&gt;

The nexus created by the different views on impacts caused by industrial production is exemplified by several contributions to the discussion about producer or consumer responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions. Emissions data are reported to the IPCC as contributions of producing industries located in a particular country rather than as embodiments in products consumed by a particular population, irrespective of productive origin. However, especially for open economies, taking into account the greenhouse gases embodied in internationally traded commodities can have a considerable influence on national greenhouse gas balance sheets. Assuming consumer responsibility, exports have to be subtracted from, and imports added to national greenhouse gas inventories. In Denmark, for example, Munksgaard and Pedersen (2001) report that a significant amount of power and other energy-intensive commodities are traded across Danish borders, and that between 1966 and 1994 the Danish foreign trade balance in terms of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; developed from a 7 Mt deficit to a 7 Mt surplus, compared to total emissions of approximately 60 Mt.&lt;ref&gt;Munksgaard, J. and K. A. Pedersen (2001). CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; accounts for open economies: producer or consumer responsibility. Energy Policy, 29, pp. 327-334.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, electricity traded between Norway, Sweden and Denmark is subject to large annual fluctuations due to varying rainfall in Norway and Sweden. In wet years Denmark imports hydro-electricity whereas electricity from coal-fired power plants is exported in dry years. The official Danish emissions inventory includes a correction for electricity trade and thus applies the consumer responsibility principle.&lt;ref&gt;Danish Environmental Protection Agency (1998). Denmark's Second National Communication on Climate Change submitted under the UN FCCC. [http://www.mst.dk Danish Ministry of Environment and Energy]&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, at the company level, "when adopting the concept of eco-efficiency and the scope of an environmental management system stated in for example ISO 14001, it is insufficient to merely report on the carbon dioxide emissions limited to the judicial borders of the company".&lt;ref&gt;Cerin, P. and L. Karlson (2002). Business incentives for sustainability: a property rights approach. Ecological Economics, 40, pp. 13-22.&lt;/ref&gt; 7 "Companies must recognise their wider responsibility and manage the entire life-cycle of their products ... Insisting on high environmental standards from suppliers and ensuring that raw materials are extracted or produced in an environmentally conscious way provides a start."&lt;ref&gt;Cerin, P. (2005) Environmental Strategies in Industry: Turning Business Incentives into Sustainability. Report 5455. Swedish Environmental Protection Agency.&lt;/ref&gt; A life-cycle perspective is also taken in EPR frameworks: "Producers of products should bear a significant degree of responsibility (physical and/or financial) not only for the environmental impacts of their products downstream from the treatment and disposal of their product, but also for their upstream activities inherent in the selection of materials and in the design of products."&lt;ref&gt;Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development 2001, p. 21-22&lt;/ref&gt; "The major impetus for EPR came from northern European countries in the late 1980s and early 1990s, as they were facing severe landfill shortages. [... As a result,] EPR is generally applied to post-consumer wastes which place increasing physical and financial demands on municipal waste management."&lt;ref&gt;Environment Protection Authority New South Wales 2003, p. 2-4&lt;/ref&gt;

EPR has rarely been consistently quantified. Moreover, applying conventional [[life cycle assessment]], and assigning environmental impacts to producers and consumers can lead to [[Double counting (accounting)|double-counting]]. Using [[input-output analysis]], researchers have attempted for decades to account for both producers and consumers in an economy in a consistent way. Gallego and Lenzen demonstrate and discuss a method of consistently delineating producers' supply chains, into mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive responsibilities to be shared by all agents in an economy.&lt;ref&gt;Gallego, B. and M. Lenzen (2005). A consistent input-output formulation of shared producer and consumer responsibility. Economic Systems Research, 17(4), pp. 365-391.&lt;/ref&gt; Their method is an approach to allocating responsibility across agents in a fully inter-connected circular system. Upstream and downstream environmental impacts are shared between all agents of a supply chain – producers and consumers.

==Examples==

Auto Recycling Nederland (ARN) is a producer responsibility organisation (PRO) that organises vehicle recycling in the [[Netherlands]]. An advanced recycling fee is charged to those who purchase a new vehicle and is used to fund the recycling of it at the end of its useful life. The PRO was set up to satisfy the European Union's [[End of Life Vehicles Directive]].

The Swiss Association for Information, Communication and Organisational Technology (SWICO), an ICT industry organisation, became a PRO to address the problem of [[electronic waste]].

The Canada-Wide Action Plan for Extended Producer Responsibility (CAP-EPR) was adopted in Canada in 2009 under the guidance of the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment. The CAP-EPR followed years of waste and recycling efforts in Canada that remained largely ineffective as the diversion rates from landfills and incineration persisted. Despite three decades worth of recycling efforts, Canada fell short of many other [[Group of Eight|G8]] and [[OECD]] countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ccme.ca/files/current_priorities/waste/pn_1499_epr_cap_e.pdf|title=Canada-Wide Action Plan for Extended Producer Responsibility|last=|first=|date=October 2009|website=Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the CAP-EPR’s 2009 inception, most provinces have enforced legislation or restrictions on a wider range of products and materials under EPR programs. “Nine out of ten provinces have [since implemented] EPR programs or [put] requirements in place… As a result of these new programs or requirements and expansion of existing ones, almost half of the product categories for Phase 1 are now covered by legislated EPR programs or requirements across Canada.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ccme.ca/files/Resources/waste/extended/CAP-EPR%20Progress%20Report.pdf|title=Progress Report on the Canada-Wide Action Plan for Extender Producer Responsibility|last=|first=|date=2014|website=Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==

In Germany, since the adoption of EPR, "between 1991 and 1998, the per capita consumption of packaging was reduced from 94.7 kg to 82 kg, resulting in a reduction of 13.4%".&lt;ref name="Hanisch 170A-75A"&gt;Hanisch, Carola. "Is Extended Producer Responsibility Effective?" Environmental Science &amp; Technology 34.7 (2000): 170A-75A. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, due to Germany's influence in EPR, the "European Commission developed one waste directive" for all of member states (Hanisch 2000). One major goal was to have all member states recycle "25% of all packaging material"&lt;ref name="Hanisch 170A-75A"/&gt; and have accomplished the goal.

In the United States, EPR is gaining popularity "with 40 such laws enacted since 2008. In 2010 alone, 38 such EPR bills were introduced in state legislatures across the United States, and 12 were signed into law."&lt;ref name="JIE 175-85"&gt;Nash, Jennifer, and Christopher Bosso. "Extended Producer Responsibility in the United States." ''Journal of Industrial Ecology'' 17.2 (2013): 175-85. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; However, these laws are only at the state level as there are no federal laws for EPR. So far, "only a handful of states have imposed five to six EPR laws as well as 32 states having at least one EPR law".&lt;ref name="JIE 175-85"/&gt;

The '''Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker''' ('''FLRW''') '''[[Riemannian metric|metric]]''' is an [[Exact solutions in general relativity|exact solution]] of [[Einstein field equations|Einstein's field equations]] of [[general relativity]]; it describes a [[homogeneity (physics)#Translation invariance|homogeneous]], [[isotropic]], [[metric expansion of space|expanding]] (or otherwise, contracting) [[universe]] that is [[path-connected]], but not necessarily [[simply connected space|simply connected]].&lt;ref&gt;For an early reference, see Robertson (1935); Robertson ''assumes'' multiple connectedness in the positive curvature case and says that "we are still free to restore" simple connectedness.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LaLu95"&gt;{{Citation |author1=M.

Robertson]] and [[Arthur Geoffrey Walker]] are customarily grouped as '''Friedmann''' or '''Friedmann–Robertson–Walker''' ('''FRW''') or '''Robertson–Walker''' ('''RW''') or '''Friedmann–Lemaître''' ('''FL'''). This model is sometimes called the ''Standard Model'' of modern [[Physical cosmology|cosmology]],&lt;ref name=Goobar&gt;{{citation |author=L. Bergström, A. Goobar |date=2006 |title=Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics |page=61 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CQYu_sutWAoC&amp;pg=PA61 |edition=2nd |publisher=[[Springer (publisher)|Sprint]] |isbn=3-540-32924-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; although such a description is also associated with the further developed [[Lambda-CDM model]]. The FLRW model was developed independently by the named authors in the 1920s and 1930s.

== General metric ==

The FLRW metric starts with the assumption of [[homogeneity (physics)#Translation invariance|homogeneity]] and [[isotropy]] of space. It also assumes that the spatial component of the metric can be time-dependent. The generic metric which meets these conditions is
:&lt;math&gt;- c^2 \mathrm{d}\tau^2 = - c^2 \mathrm{d}t^2 + {a(t)}^2 \mathrm{d}\mathbf{\Sigma}^2&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Sigma}&lt;/math&gt; ranges over a 3-dimensional space of uniform curvature, that is, [[elliptical space]], [[Euclidean space]], or [[hyperbolic space]]. It is normally written as a function of three spatial coordinates, but there are several conventions for doing so, detailed below. &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}\mathbf{\Sigma}&lt;/math&gt; does not depend on ''t'' — all of the time dependence is in the function ''a''(''t''), known as the "[[Scale factor (universe)|scale factor]]".

===Reduced-circumference polar coordinates===
In reduced-circumference polar coordinates the spatial metric has the form
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}\mathbf{\Sigma}^2 = \frac{\mathrm{d}r^2}{1-k r^2} + r^2 \mathrm{d}\mathbf{\Omega}^2, \quad \text{where } \mathrm{d}\mathbf{\Omega}^2 = \mathrm{d}\theta^2 + \sin^2 \theta \, \mathrm{d}\phi^2.&lt;/math&gt;

''k'' is a constant representing the curvature of the space. There are two common unit conventions:
*''k'' may be taken to have units of length&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;, in which case ''r'' has units of length and ''a''(''t'') is unitless. ''k'' is then the [[Gaussian curvature]] of the space at the time when ''a''(''t'') = 1. ''r'' is sometimes called the reduced [[circumference]] because it is equal to the measured circumference of a circle (at that value of ''r''), centered at the origin, divided by 2{{pi}} (like the ''r'' of [[Schwarzschild coordinates]]). Where appropriate, ''a''(''t'') is often chosen to equal 1 in the present cosmological era, so that &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}\mathbf{\Sigma}&lt;/math&gt; measures [[comoving distance]].
*Alternatively, ''k'' may be taken to belong to the set {−1,0,+1} (for negative, zero, and positive curvature respectively). Then ''r'' is unitless and ''a''(''t'') has units of length. When ''k'' = ±1, ''a''(''t'') is the [[Radius of curvature (mathematics)|radius of curvature]] of the space, and may also be written ''R''(''t'').

A disadvantage of reduced circumference coordinates is that they cover only half of the 3-sphere in the case of positive curvature—circumferences beyond that point begin to decrease, leading to degeneracy. (This is not a problem if space is [[elliptical geometry|elliptical]], i.e. a 3-sphere with opposite points identified.)

===Hyperspherical coordinates===
In ''hyperspherical'' or ''curvature-normalized'' coordinates the coordinate ''r'' is proportional to radial distance; this gives
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}\mathbf{\Sigma}^2 = \mathrm{d}r^2 + S_k(r)^2 \, \mathrm{d}\mathbf{\Omega}^2&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}\mathbf{\Omega}&lt;/math&gt; is as before and
:&lt;math&gt;S_k(r) =
\begin{cases}
\sqrt{k}^{\,-1} \sin (r \sqrt{k}), &amp;k &gt; 0 \\
r, &amp;k = 0 \\
\sqrt{|k|}^{\,-1} \sinh (r \sqrt{|k|}), &amp;k &lt; 0.
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

As before, there are two common unit conventions:
*''k'' may be taken to have units of length&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;, in which case ''r'' has units of length and ''a''(''t'' ) is unitless.  ''k'' is then the [[Gaussian curvature]] of the space at the time when ''a''(''t'' ) = 1.  Where appropriate, ''a''(''t'' ) is often chosen to equal 1 in the present cosmological era, so that &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}\mathbf{\Sigma}&lt;/math&gt; measures [[comoving distance]].
*Alternatively, as before, ''k'' may be taken to belong to the set {−1,0,+1} (for negative, zero, and positive curvature respectively). Then ''r'' is unitless and ''a''(''t'' ) has units of length. When ''k'' = ±1, ''a''(''t'' ) is the [[Radius of curvature (mathematics)|radius of curvature]] of the space, and may also be written ''R''(''t'' ).  Note that, when ''k'' = +1, ''r'' is essentially a third angle along with ''θ'' and ''φ''. The letter ''χ''  may be used instead of&amp;nbsp;''r''.

Though it is usually defined piecewise as above, ''S'' is an [[analytic function]] of both ''k'' and ''r''. It can also be written as a [[power series]]
:&lt;math&gt;S_k(r) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n k^n r^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!} = r - \frac{k r^3}{6} + \frac{k^2 r^5}{120} - \cdots&lt;/math&gt;
or as
:&lt;math&gt;S_k(r) = r \; \mathrm{sinc} \, (r \sqrt{k})&lt;/math&gt;
where sinc is the unnormalized [[sinc function]] and &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{k}&lt;/math&gt; is one of the imaginary, zero or real square roots of ''k''. These definitions are valid for all ''k''.

===Cartesian coordinates===
When ''k'' = 0 one may write simply
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}\mathbf{\Sigma}^2 = \mathrm{d}x^2 + \mathrm{d}y^2 + \mathrm{d}z^2.&lt;/math&gt;
This can be extended to ''k'' ≠ 0 by defining
:&lt;math&gt; x = r \cos \theta \,&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt; y = r \sin \theta \cos \phi \,&lt;/math&gt;, and
:&lt;math&gt; z = r \sin \theta \sin \phi \,&lt;/math&gt;,
where ''r'' is one of the radial coordinates defined above, but this is rare.

===Curvature===
====Cartesian coordinates====
In flat &lt;math&gt;(k=0)&lt;/math&gt; FLRW space using Cartesian coordinates, the surviving components of the [[Ricci tensor]] are&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wald |first=Robert |title=General Relativity |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; R_{tt} = - 3 \frac{\ddot{a}}{a}, \quad R_{xx}= R_{yy} = R_{zz} = c^{-2} (a \ddot{a} + 2 \dot{a}^2) &lt;/math&gt;
and the Ricci scalar is  
:&lt;math&gt; R = 6 c^{-2} \left(\frac{\ddot{a}(t)}{a(t)}  +  \frac{\dot{a}^2(t)}{a^2(t)}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

====Spherical coordinates====
In more general FLRW space using spherical coordinates (called "reduced-circumference polar coordinates" above), the surviving components of the Ricci tensor are&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icc.ub.edu/~liciaverde/Cosmology.pdf |title=Cosmology |page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; R_{tt} = - 3 \frac{\ddot{a}}{a}, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R_{rr}=\frac{c^{-2}(a(t)\ddot{a}(t) + 2\dot{a}^2(t)) + 2k}{1 - kr^2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; R_{\theta\theta} = r^2(c^{-2}(a(t)\ddot{a}(t) + 2\dot{a}^2(t)) + 2k)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R_{\phi\phi} =r^2(c^{-2}(a(t)\ddot{a}(t) + 2\dot{a}^2(t)) + 2k)\sin^2(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;
 
and the Ricci scalar is  
:&lt;math&gt; R =  6  \left(\frac{\ddot{a}(t)}{c^2 a(t)}  +  \frac{\dot{a}^2(t)}{c^2 a^2(t)} + \frac{k}{a^2(t)}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

==Solutions==
{{General relativity sidebar |solutions}}
{{main|Friedmann equations}}

Einstein's field equations are not used in deriving the general form for the metric: it follows from the geometric properties of homogeneity and isotropy. However, determining the time evolution of &lt;math&gt;a(t)&lt;/math&gt; does require Einstein's field equations together with a way of calculating the density, &lt;math&gt;\rho (t),&lt;/math&gt; such as a [[equation of state (cosmology)|cosmological equation of state]].

This metric has an analytic solution to [[Einstein field equations|Einstein's field equations]] &lt;math&gt;G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^{4}} T_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; giving the [[Friedmann equations]] when the [[energy-momentum tensor]] is similarly assumed to be isotropic and homogeneous. The resulting equations are:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=P. Ojeda and H. Rosu |date=2006 |title=Supersymmetry of FRW barotropic cosmologies |journal=[[International Journal of Theoretical Physics]] |volume=45 |issue=6 |pages=1191–1196 |doi=10.1007/s10773-006-9123-2 |arxiv=gr-qc/0510004 |bibcode=2006IJTP...45.1152R}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\dot a}{a}\right)^{2} + \frac{kc^{2}}{a^2} - \frac{\Lambda c^{2}}{3} = \frac{8\pi G}{3}\rho&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;2\frac{\ddot a}{a} + \left(\frac{\dot a}{a}\right)^{2} + \frac{kc^{2}}{a^2} - \Lambda c^{2} = -\frac{8\pi G}{c^{2}} p.&lt;/math&gt;

These equations are the basis of the standard [[big bang]] cosmological model including the current [[Lambda-CDM model|ΛCDM]] model. Because the FLRW model assumes homogeneity, some popular accounts mistakenly assert that the big bang model cannot account for the observed lumpiness of the universe. In a strictly FLRW model, there are no clusters of galaxies, stars or people, since these are objects much denser than a typical part of the universe. Nonetheless, the FLRW model is used as a first approximation for the evolution of the real, lumpy universe because it is simple to calculate, and models which calculate the lumpiness in the universe are added onto the FLRW models as extensions. Most cosmologists agree that the [[observable universe]] is well approximated by an ''almost FLRW model'', i.e., a model which follows the FLRW metric apart from [[primordial fluctuations|primordial density fluctuations]]. {{As of|2003}}, the theoretical implications of the various extensions to the FLRW model appear to be well understood, and the goal is to make these consistent with observations from [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]] and [[WMAP]].

If the spacetime is [[Spacetime topology|multiply connected]], then each event will be represented by more than one [[tuple]] of coordinates.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

===Interpretation===
The pair of equations given above is equivalent to the following pair of equations
:&lt;math&gt;{\dot \rho} = - 3 \frac{\dot a}{a}\left(\rho+\frac{p}{c^{2}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\ddot a}{a} = - \frac{4\pi G}{3}\left(\rho + \frac{3p}{c^{2}}\right) + \frac{\Lambda c^{2}}{3}&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, the spatial curvature index, serving as a [[constant of integration]] for the first equation.

The first equation can be derived also from [[Thermodynamics of the universe|thermodynamical considerations]] and is equivalent to the [[first law of thermodynamics]], assuming the expansion of the universe is an [[adiabatic process]] (which is implicitly assumed in the derivation of the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric).

The second equation states that both the energy density and the pressure cause the expansion rate of the universe &lt;math&gt;{\dot a}&lt;/math&gt; to decrease, i.e., both cause a deceleration in the expansion of the universe. This is a consequence of [[gravitation]], with pressure playing a similar role to that of energy (or mass) density, according to the principles of [[general relativity]]. The [[cosmological constant]], on the other hand, [[Dark energy|causes an acceleration in the expansion]] of the universe.

===Cosmological constant===
The [[cosmological constant]] term can be omitted if we make the following replacements
:&lt;math&gt;\rho \rightarrow \rho + \frac{\Lambda c^{2}}{8 \pi G}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;p \rightarrow p - \frac{\Lambda c^{4}}{8 \pi G}.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the [[cosmological constant]] can be interpreted as arising from a form of energy which has negative pressure, equal in magnitude to its (positive) energy density:
:&lt;math&gt;p = - \rho c^2. \,&lt;/math&gt;
Such form of energy—a generalization of the notion of a [[cosmological constant]]—is known as [[dark energy]].

In fact, in order to get a term which causes an acceleration of the universe expansion, it is enough to have a [[scalar field theory|scalar field]] which satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;p &lt; - \frac {\rho c^2} {3}. \,&lt;/math&gt;
Such a field is sometimes called [[Quintessence (physics)|quintessence]].

===Newtonian interpretation===
This is due to McCrea and Milne &lt;ref&gt;McCrea, W. H.; Milne, E. A. (1934). "Newtonian universes and the curvature of space". Quarterly Journal of Mathematics. 5: 73–80.&lt;/ref&gt; although sometimes incorrectly ascribed to Friedmann. The Friedmann equations are equivalent to this pair of equations:
:&lt;math&gt; - a^3 {\dot \rho} = 3 a^2 {\dot a} \rho + \frac{3 a^2 p {\dot a}}{c^2} \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{{\dot a}^2}{2} - \frac{G \frac{4 \pi a^3}{3} \rho}{a} = - \frac{k c^2}{2} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The first equation says that the decrease in the mass contained in a fixed cube (whose side is momentarily ''a'') is the amount which leaves through the sides due to the expansion of the universe plus the mass equivalent of the work done by pressure against the material being expelled. This is the conservation of mass-energy ([[first law of thermodynamics]]) contained within a part of the universe.

The second equation says that the kinetic energy (seen from the origin) of a particle of unit mass moving with the expansion plus its (negative) gravitational potential energy (relative to the mass contained in the sphere of matter closer to the origin) is equal to a constant related to the curvature of the universe. In other words, the energy (relative to the origin) of a co-moving particle in free-fall is conserved. General relativity merely adds a connection between the spatial curvature of the universe and the energy of such a particle: positive total energy implies negative curvature and negative total energy implies positive curvature.

The [[cosmological constant]] term is assumed to be treated as dark energy and thus merged into the density and pressure terms.

During the [[Planck epoch]], one cannot neglect [[quantum mechanics|quantum]] effects. So they may cause a deviation from the Friedmann equations.

== Name and history ==

The Soviet mathematician [[Alexander Friedmann]] first derived the main results of the FLRW model in 1922 and 1924. Although the prestigious physics journal ''[[Zeitschrift für Physik]]'' published his work, it remained relatively unnoticed by his contemporaries. Friedmann was in direct communication with [[Albert Einstein]], who, on behalf of ''Zeitschrift für Physik'', acted as the scientific referee of Friedmann's work. Eventually Einstein acknowledged the correctness of Friedmann's calculations, but failed to appreciate the physical significance of Friedmann's predictions.

Friedmann died in 1925. In 1927, [[Georges Lemaître]], a Belgian priest, astronomer and periodic professor of physics at the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|Catholic University of Leuven]], arrived independently at results similar to those of Friedmann and published them in the ''Annales de la Société Scientifique de Bruxelles'' (Annals of the Scientific Society of Brussels).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author= G. Lemaître |title= Un Univers homogène de masse constante et de rayon croissant rendant compte de la vitesse radiale des nébuleuses extra-galactiques |journal= Annales de la Société Scientifique de Bruxelles |volume= 47 |page= 49 |date= April 1927 |url= http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1927ASSB...47...49L&amp;defaultprint=YES&amp;filetype=.pdf |language= French |bibcode = 
 1927ASSB...47...49L }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the face of the observational evidence for the expansion of the universe obtained by [[Edwin Hubble]] in the late 1920s, Lemaître's results were noticed in particular by [[Arthur Eddington]], and in 1930–31 Lemaître's paper was translated into English and published in the ''[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]''.

[[Howard P. Robertson]] from the US and [[Arthur Geoffrey Walker]] from the UK explored the problem further during the 1930s. In 1935 Robertson and Walker rigorously proved that the FLRW metric is the only one on a spacetime that is spatially homogeneous and isotropic (as noted above, this is a geometric result and is not tied specifically to the equations of general relativity, which were always assumed by Friedmann and Lemaître).

This solution, often called the Robertson–Walker ''metric'' since they proved its generic properties, is different from the dynamical "Friedmann-Lemaître" ''models'', which are specific solutions for ''a''(''t'') which assume that the only contributions to stress-energy are cold matter ("dust"), radiation, and a cosmological constant.

== Einstein's radius of the universe ==

'''Einstein's radius of the universe''' is the [[Radius of curvature (mathematics)|radius of curvature]] of space of [[Einstein's universe]], a long-abandoned [[Static spacetime|static]] model that was supposed to represent our universe in idealized form. Putting

&lt;math&gt;\dot{a} = \ddot{a} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

in the Friedmann equation, the radius of curvature of space of this universe (Einstein's radius) is{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

&lt;math&gt;R_E=c/\sqrt {4\pi G\rho}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of light, &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gravitational constant|Newtonian gravitational constant]], and &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the density of space of this universe. The numerical value of Einstein's radius is of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; [[light year]]s.

A '''Glasgow smile''' (also known as a '''Chelsea smile''', or a '''Glasgow''', '''Chelsea''' or '''Cheshire grin''') is a [[wound]] caused by making a cut from the corners of a victim's mouth up to the ears, leaving a [[scar]] in the shape of a smile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/68037/Surgeon-says-hospitals-treat-a-knife-victim-every-six-hours|work=[[The Daily Express]]|title=Surgeon Says Hospitals Treat a Knife Victim Every Six Hours|accessdate=2009-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=If the Booze Doesn't Get You, The Blade Will|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/2683007/Suns-look-at-Broken-Britain-day-four-Glasgows-East-End.html|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|accessdate=2009-11-20|location=London|first=Oliver|last=Harvey|date=2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/city-slicker-glasgow-1616900.html|title=City Slicker Glasgow|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=2009-11-20 | location=London | first=John | last=Arlidge | date=1995-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The act is usually performed with a [[utility knife]] or a piece of broken glass,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Maxillofacial trauma and esthetic facial reconstruction |page=555 |author1=Peter Ward Booth |author2=Barry L. Eppley |author3=Rainer Schmelzeisen |year=2003 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8tdpAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving a scar which causes the victim to appear to be [[smile|smiling]] broadly.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3528">'''Gossen's Second “Law”''', named for [[Hermann Heinrich Gossen]] (1810–1858), is the assertion that an [[Economics|economic]] agent will allocate his or her expenditures such that the ratio of the [[marginal utility]] of each [[Good (economics)|good]] or [[Service (economics)|service]] to its price (the marginal expenditure necessary for its acquisition) is equal to that for every other good or service.  Formally,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial U/\partial x_i}{p_i}=\frac{\partial U/\partial x_j}{p_j}~\forall\left(i,j\right)&lt;/math&gt;
where
* &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is [[utility]]
* &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; is quantity of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th good or service
* &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; is the price of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th good or service

== Informal derivation ==
Imagine that an agent has spent money on various sorts of goods or services.  If the last unit of currency spent on goods or services of one sort bought a quantity with ''less'' marginal utility than that which would have been associated with the quantity of another sort that could have been bought with the money, then the agent would have been ''better off'' instead buying more of that other good or service.  Assuming that goods and services are continuously divisible, the only way that it is possible that the marginal expenditure on one good or service should not yield more utility than the marginal expenditure on the other (or ''vice versa'') is if the marginal expenditures yield ''equal'' utility.

== Formal derivation ==
Assume that utility, goods, and services have the requisite properties so that &lt;math&gt;\partial U/\partial x_i&lt;/math&gt; is [[Well-defined|well defined]] for each good or service.  An agent then optimizes
:&lt;math&gt;U\left(x_1 ,x_2 ,\dots,x_n\right)&lt;/math&gt;
subject to a [[budget constraint]]
:&lt;math&gt;W\geq\sum_{i=1}^n \left(p_i\cdot x_i \right)&lt;/math&gt;
where
* &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is the total available sum of money
Using the method of [[Lagrange multipliers]], one constructs the function
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}\left(x_1 ,x_2 ,\dots,x_n ,\lambda\right)=U\left(x_1 ,x_2 ,\dots,x_n\right)+\lambda\cdot\left[W-\sum_{i=1}^n \left(p_i\cdot x_i \right)\right]&lt;/math&gt;
and finds the first-order conditions for optimization as
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\lambda}=0&lt;/math&gt;
(which simply implies that all of &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; will be spent) and
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial x_i}=0~~\forall i&lt;/math&gt;
so that
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial U}{\partial x_i}-\lambda\cdot p_i =0~~\forall i&lt;/math&gt;
which is algebraically equivalent to
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial U/\partial x_i}{p_i}=\lambda~~\forall i&lt;/math&gt;
Since every such ratio is equal to &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, the ratios are all equal one to another:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial U/\partial x_i}{p_i}=\frac{\partial U/\partial x_j}{p_j}~\forall\left(i,j\right)&lt;/math&gt;

(Note that, as with any maximization using first-order conditions, the equations will hold only if the utility function satisfies specific concavity requirements and does not have maxima on the edges of the set over which one is maximizing.)

'''Hiroshima National Peace Memorial Hall for the Atomic Bomb Victims''' is one of the National Memorial Halls in [[Hiroshima]], [[Japan]].

==Overview==
The Hall was founded by the Japanese national government to mourn the atomic bomb victims in 2002. It was designed by [[Kenzo Tange]].  There is [[Nagasaki National Peace Memorial Hall for the Atomic Bomb Victims|another National Peace Memorial Hall for the Atomic Bomb Victims]] in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] built for the same purpose.

The Hall is in [[Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park]] near [[Hiroshima Peace Memorial]] across the "Motoyasu River" by "Motoyasu Bridge".  The Hall curators are collecting atomic bomb memories and stories from the survivors to mourn the victims, as the survivors are aging. They are also collecting names and photographs of atomic bomb victims for the same purpose and for the same reason. From the collection, they are developing a project to "read the stories of the atomic bombing".

Admission is free of charge.

'''Historical dynamics''' broadly includes the scientific modeling of history.  This might also be termed computer modeling of history, historical simulation, or simulation of history - allowing for an extensive range of techniques in simulation and estimation.  Historical dynamics does not exist as a separate science, but there are individual efforts such as [[long range planning]], [[population modeling]], [[economic forecasting]], [[demographics]], [[global modeling]], [[country modeling]], [[regional planning]], [[urban planning]] and many others in the general categories of [[computer modeling]], [[planning]], [[forecasting]], and [[simulations]].

Some examples of "large" history where historical dynamics simulations would be helpful include; [[global history]], large structures, [[:category:histories of empires|histories of empires]], long duration history, [[philosophy of history]], [[Eurasian history]], [[comparative history]], long-range [[environmental history]], [[world systems theory]], non-Western political and economic development, and [[historical demography]].
 
==Information sources for simulations==
With the rise of technologies like wikis, and internet-wide search engines, some historical and social data can be mined to constrain models of history and society.  Data from social media sites, and busy sites, can be mined for human patterns of action.  These can provide more and more realistic behavioral models for individuals and groups of any size.  [[Agent-based model]]s and [[microsimulation]]s of [[human behavior]] can be embedded in larger historical simulations.  Related subfields are [[behavioral economics]] and [[human behavioral ecology]].

* [[Crowd computing]] has been applied to [[crowd computing#History|history]], and offers another tool for historical verification and validation.

==Sectoral databases==
In every sector of human activity, there are extensive databases for [[North american transportation statistics interchange|transportation data]], [[urban development]], [[health statistics]], [[education data]], [[social data]], [[economic data]]—along with many projections.  See [[:Category:economic databases]], [[:Category:statistical data sets]], [[:Category:social statistics data]], [[:Category:social statistics]] and [[:Category:statistics]].

Some examples of database activity include [[Asian Development Bank]] statistics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adb.org/data/statistics |title=Asian Development Bank - Statistics |publisher=Adb.org |date=2014-03-03 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[World Bank]] data,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/ |title=World Bank - Data |publisher=Data.worldbank.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[International Monetary Fund]] data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imf.org/external/data.htm |title=International Monetary Fund - Data |publisher=Imf.org |date=2014-06-27 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Time series analysis]] and [[econometrics]] are well established fields for the analysis of trends and [[forecasting]]; but, survey data and microdatasets can also be used in forecasts and simulations.
&lt;!-- This section can be expanded considerably. Many relevant datasets --&gt;

==Global, country, and sectoral models in international development==

The United Nations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/ |title=United Nations Population Division, Economic and Social Affairs |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other organizations routinely project the population of individual countries and regions of the world decades into the future.  These demographic models are used by other organizations for projecting demand for services in all sectors of each economy.

* [[International Monetary Fund]] - Finance, Government Accounts
* [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]
* [[World Health Organization]] - Health
* [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] - Food and Agriculture
* [[International Labour Organization]] - Labour
* [[World Trade Organization]] - Trade
* [[World Bank]] - extensive modeling and data activities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic#2 |title=World Bank topics by global practices |publisher=Worldbank.org |date=2014-06-30 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/0,,menuPK:476823~pagePK:64165236~piPK:64165141~theSitePK:469372,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Each country often has their corresponding modeling groups for each of these major sectors.  These can be grouped in separate articles according to sector.  Groups include government departments, [[List of development aid agencies|international aid agencies]], as well as nonprofit and [[non-governmental organization]]s.

A broad class of models used for economic and social modeling of countries and sectors are the [[Computable general equilibrium]] (CGE) model - also called [[applied general equilibrium]] models.  In the context of time based simulations and policy analysis, see [[dynamic stochastic general equilibrium]] models.

==Linked economic, social, and climate models==
Partly because of the controversy over [[global climate change]], there is an extensive network of global climate models,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=WMO Webteam |url=http://www.wmo.int/pages/themes/climate/climate_models.php |title=World Meteorological Organization models |publisher=Wmo.int |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giss.nasa.gov/projects/gcm/ |title=NASA global climate models |publisher=Giss.nasa.gov |date=2014-07-17 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and related social and economic models.  These seek to estimate, not only the change in climate and its physical effects, but also the impact on human society and the natural environment.  See [[global economic models]], [[social model]], [[microsimulation]], [[climate model]], [[global climate models]], and [[general circulation model]].

The relationship between the environment and society is examined through [[environmental social science]].  [[human ecology]], [[political ecology]], and [[ecology]], in general, can be areas where computer and mathematical modeling over time can be relevant to historical simulation.

==Historical simulations==
Web-based historical simulations, [[simulations of history]], interactive historical simulations, are increasingly popular for entertainment and educational purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://socialstudiescentral.com/?q=content/online-interactive-simulations |title=Social Studies Central, Interactive History Simulations |publisher=Socialstudiescentral.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The field is expanding rapidly and no central index seems to be available.

Several computer games allow players to interact with the game to model societies over time. The [[Civilization (series)]] is one example.  Others include [[Age of Empires]], [[Rise of Nations]], [[Spore]], [[Colonization]], [[Alpha Centauri]], [[Call to Power]], and [[CivCity: Rome]].  A longer list of games in historical context, which might include degrees of simulation, are found at [[:Category:Video games with historical settings]].

[[Military simulation]] is a well-developed field and increasingly accessible on the internet.

==Simulating society==
Computer models for simulating society fall under [[artificial society]], [[social simulation]], [[computational sociology]], [[computational social science]], and [[mathematical sociology]].  There is an interdisciplinary [[Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation]] for computer simulation of social processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/ |title=Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation |publisher=Jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[European Social Simulation Association]] promotes social simulation research in Europe; it is the publisher of JASSS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.essa.eu.org/ European Social Simulation Association]&lt;/ref&gt;  There is a corresponding [[Computational Social Science Society of the Americas]].,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://computationalsocialscience.org/ |title=Computational Social Science Society of the Americas |publisher=Computationalsocialscience.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Pan-Asian Association for Agent-based Approach in Social Systems Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paaa.asia/ |title=Pan-Asian Association for Agent-based Approach in Social Systems Sciences |publisher=Paaa.asia |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  PAAA lists some related Japanese associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paaa.asia/related-associations/ |title=Related social simulation associations |publisher=Paaa.asia |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SimSoc ([[Simulated Society]] tool) is in its fifth edition.

==Cities==
There has been extensive research in [[urban planning]], [[environmental planning]] and related fields: [[regional planning]], [[land-use planning]], [[transportation planning]], [[urban studies]], and [[regional science]].  Journals for these fields are listed at [[List of planning journals]].

[[SimCity]] is a game for simulations of artificial cities.  It has spawned a range of "sim" games.  The planning groups try to simulate changes in real cities.  The game groups allow experiments with artificial cities.  And the two are merging in such efforts as Vizicities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geospatial.blogs.com/geospatial/2013/09/simcity-with-real-data-modeling-real-cities-in-3d-in-a-web-environment.html |title=SimCity with real data: modeling real cities in 3D in a Web environment |publisher=Geospatial.blogs.com |date=2013-09-20 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industry==
The profiling of industries is well developed, and most industries make forecasts and plans.  See [[industrial history]], [[history of steel]], [[history of mining]], [[history of construction]], [[history of the petroleum industry]], and many other histories of specific industries.  See [[cyclical industrial dynamics]] for modeling of industries in the sense of "historical dynamics of industries".  Some related terms are [[industrial planning]], [[history of industry]], [[industrial evolution]], [[technology change]], and [[technology forecasting]]. An example of "history friendly" industrial models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=F Malerba a |author2=R Nelson b |author3=L Orsenigo |author4=S Winter d |url=http://icc.oxfordjournals.org/content/8/1/3.abstract |title='History-friendly' models of industry evolution: the computer industry |publisher=Icc.oxfordjournals.org |date=2014-08-04 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the journal, Industrial and Corporate Change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icc.oxfordjournals.org/ |title=Journal: Industrial and Corporate Change |publisher=Icc.oxfordjournals.org |date=2014-08-04 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economy-wide models must take into account the interactions between industry and the rest of the economy.  See [[Input–output model]], [[economic planning]], and [[social accounting matrix]] for some relevant techniques.

==Futures==
Many of the techniques from [[futures studies]] are applicable to historical dynamics.  Whether projecting forward from a point in the past to the present for validation studies, or projecting backwards from the present into the past - many of the techniques are useful.  Likewise, simulations of the past, or alternative pasts, provide a groundwork of techniques for futures studies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31378">{{Psychology sidebar}}'''Intergroup relations''' refers to interactions between individuals in different social groups, and to interactions taking place between the groups themselves collectively. It has long been a subject of research in [[social psychology]], [[political psychology]], and [[organizational behavior]].&lt;ref name="iess"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title=Intergroup Relations|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences/applied-and-social-sciences-magazines/intergroup-relations|date=2008|language=en|website=International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences|access-date=2018-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|year=2014|title=Intergroup Relations|encyclopedia=Wiley Encyclopedia of Management|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118785317.weom110172/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, [[Muzafer Sherif]] proposed a now-widely recognized definition of intergroup relations:

"Whenever individuals belonging to one group interact, collectively or individually, with another group or its members in terms of their group identification, we have an instance of intergroup behavior".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title=Intergroup relations|url=http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9780631233176_chunk_g978063123536113_ss2-18|website=The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Management|access-date=2018-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on intergroup relations involves the study of many psychological phenomena related to intergroup processes including [[Social identity theory|social identity]], [[prejudice]], [[group dynamics]], and [[conformity]] among [[#See also|many others]]. Research in this area has been shaped my many [[#Notable Figures|notable figures]] and continues to provide empirical insights into modern social issues such as social inequality and discrimination.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/637074045|title=Social psychology|last=M.|first=Kassin, Saul|date=2011|publisher=Cengage Wadsworth|others=Fein, Steven., Markus, Hazel Rose.|isbn=9780495812401|edition= 8th|location=Belmont, CA|oclc=637074045}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
While philosophers and thinkers have written about topics related to intergroup relations dating back to [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/59879503|title=Aristotle's Politics : critical essays|date=2005|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|others=Kraut, Richard, 1944-, Skultety, Steven.|isbn=0742534235|location=Lanham|oclc=59879503}}&lt;/ref&gt; the psychological study of group attitudes and behavior began in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Allport, G. W (1985). "The historical background of social psychology". In Lindzey, G; Aronson, E. The Handbook of Social Psychology. New York: McGraw Hill.p.5&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest scientific publications on group processes is ''[[The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind]]'', written in 1895 by French doctor and scientist [[Gustave Le Bon]]. Le Bon proposed that a group of individuals is different from the sum of its parts (often paraphrased as "a group is more than the sum of its parts"). This idea of [[crowd psychology]] states that when individuals form a group, this group behaves differently than each individual would normally act. Le Bon theorized that when individuals formed a group or crowd, there would emerge a new psychological entity which would be shaped by the group's "[[Racial unconscious|racial [collective] unconscious]]."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/925485880|title=Crowds in the 21st century : perspectives from contemporary social science|others=Drury, John., Stott, Clifford John T.|isbn=1138922919|location=Abingdon, Oxfordshire|oclc=925485880}}&lt;/ref&gt; Le Bon put forth three phenomena that explained crowd behavior: ''submergence'' (or ''anonymity''), when individuals lose their sense of self and responsibility by joining a crowd, ''contagion'', the tendency for individuals in a crowd to follow the beliefs and behaviors of the crowd, and ''suggestion'', which refers to how the beliefs and behaviors of the crowd are shaped by a shared [[Collective unconscious|racial unconscious.]]&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Subsequent generations of intergroup relations researchers built from these foundational ideas and explored them through empirical studies.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

The empirical study of intergroup relations, as well as the broader field of [[social psychology]], grew tremendously in the years following [[World War II]]. The events of [[World War II]], including the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Fascism|Facism]], and the widespread use of [[Propaganda in Nazi Germany|propaganda]], led many social scientists to study [[Group conflict|intergroup conflict]], [[Obedience (human behavior)|obedience]], [[conformity]], [[dehumanization]], and other related phenomena.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Social scientists were interested in understanding the behavior of the german population under [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] rule, specifically how their attitudes were influenced by [[Propaganda in Nazi Germany|propaganda]] and how so many could obey orders to carry out or support the mass murder of Jews and other minority groups as part of the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust.]]&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Several prominent social psychologists were directly affected by the Nazi's actions because of their [[Jews|Jewish]] faith, including [[Kurt Lewin]], [[Fritz Heider]], and [[Solomon Asch]]. [[Muzafer Sherif]] was briefly detained by the Turkish government in 1944 for his pro-communist and anti-fascist beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/879600152|title=Norms, groups, conflict, and social change : rediscovering Muzafer Sherif's psychology|others=Dost-Gozkan, Ayfer., Keith, Doga Sonmez.|isbn=9781412855051|location=New Brunswick, New Jersey|oclc=879600152}}&lt;/ref&gt; These scientists would draw from these experiences and go on to make major theoretical contributions to intergroup relations research as well as the broader field of psychology.

The [[cognitive revolution]] in psychology in the 1950s and 60s led researchers to study how [[cognitive bias]]es and [[Heuristics in judgment and decision-making|heuristics]] influence beliefs and behavior. The resulting focus on [[Cognition|cognitive processes]] and [[meaning-making]] represented a significant shift away from the mainstream [[Behaviorism|behaviorist]] philosophy that shaped much of psychology research in the first half of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Citation|last=Thagard|first=Paul|title=Cognitive Science|date=2018|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2018/entries/cognitive-science/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition= Winter 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; During and after the cognitive revolution, intergroup relations researchers began to study [[Bias|cognitive biases]], [[heuristic]]s, and [[stereotype]]s and their influences on beliefs and behavior.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; [[Asch conformity experiments|Solomon Asch's studies on conformity]] in the 1950s were among the first experiments to explore how a cognitive process (the need to conform to the behavior of the group) could override individual preferences to directly influence behavior.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; [[Leon Festinger]] also focused on cognitive processes in developing [[cognitive dissonance]] theory,&lt;ref&gt;Festinger, L. (1957) Cognitive dissonance. Stanford, Calif.: [[Stanford University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; which [[Elliot Aronson]] and other researchers would later build upon to describe how individuals feel liking for a group whose views they may not agree with but they were initiated into.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aronson|first=Elliot|last2=Mills|first2=Judson|date=1959|title=The effect of severity of initiation on liking for a group.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/h0047195|journal=The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|volume=59|issue=2|pages=177–181|doi=10.1037/h0047195|issn=0096-851X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1950s and 60s galvanized social scientists to study [[prejudice]], [[discrimination]], and [[collective action]] in the context of race in America. [[Gordon Allport]]'s 1954 book ''[[The Nature of Prejudice]]'' provided the first theoretical framework for understanding and counteracting prejudice.&lt;ref name="iess" /&gt; In his book, Allport proposed the [[contact hypothesis]] which states that interpersonal contact, in the correct context, can be an effective means of reducing [[prejudice]], [[discrimination]], and reliance on [[stereotype]]s.&lt;ref name="iess" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Subsequent generations of scientists built on and applied Allport's [[contact hypothesis]] to other domains of [[prejudice]] including [[sexism]], [[homophobia]], and [[ableism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pettigrew|first=Thomas F.|last2=Tropp|first2=Linda R.|date=2006|title=A meta-analytic test of intergroup contact theory.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/0022-3514.90.5.751|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|language=en|volume=90|issue=5|pages=751–783|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.90.5.751|issn=1939-1315}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Martin Luther King]] spoke at the annual meeting of the [[American Psychological Association]] urging social scientists to advance causes of social justice in their research.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=King|first=Martin Luther|date=1968|title=The Role of the Behavioral Scientist in the Civil Rights Movement|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-4560.1968.tb01465.x|journal=Journal of Social Issues|language=en|volume=24|issue=1|pages=1–12|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1968.tb01465.x|issn=0022-4537|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his speech, Dr. King called on scientists to study many topics related to the [[civil rights movement]] including the barriers to upward social mobility for African Americans, political engagement and action in the African American community, and the processes of psychological and ideological change among African Americans and Whites.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Intergroup relations research in the final decades of the 20th century refined earlier theories and applied technological advances to the study of [[group dynamics]]. For example, [[Lee Ross]] applied his research on [[Fundamental attribution error|correspondence biases and attributional errors]] as part of the [[conflict resolution]] process in Northern Ireland during [[The Troubles]].&lt;ref&gt;Ravindran, Sandeep (2012). "Profile of Lee D. Ross". Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. 109 (19): 7132–7133. doi:10.1073/pnas.1205295109. PMC 3358840. &lt;nowiki&gt;PMID 22517739&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[implicit-association test]] (IAT), developed by [[Anthony Greenwald]] and colleagues in 1998 as a means to measure the strength of implicit (automatic) association of between different mental representations of objects, is one example of psychologists leveraging new technology to advance intergroup relations research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greenwald|first=Anthony G.|last2=McGhee|first2=Debbie E.|last3=Schwartz|first3=Jordan L.

== Foundational Theories ==

=== Contact Hypothesis ===
{{Main|Contact hypothesis}}[[Gordon Allport]] developed this hypothesis which states that contact with members of another social group in the appropriate circumstances can lead to a reduction of [[prejudice]] between majority and minority group members.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; There are three psychological processes underlying the [[contact hypothesis]]: learning about the outgroup through direct contact, fear and anxiety reduction when interacting with the outgroup, and increased ability to [[Perspective-taking|perspective take]] and empathize with the outgroup which results in reduced negative evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan, W. G.; Stephan, C. W. (1985). "Intergroup anxiety". Journal of Social Issues. 41 (3): 157–175. doi:10.1111/j.1540-4560.1985.tb01134.x.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephan, W. G.; Finlay, K. (1999). "The role of empathy in improving intergroup relations". Journal of Social Issues. 55 (4): 729–743. doi:10.1111/0022-4537.00144.&lt;/ref&gt; These processes take place optimally when four conditions are met: groups must have relatively equal status, shared goals, be able to cooperate with each other, and recognize an authority that supports contact between groups.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Some researchers have critiqued the [[contact hypothesis]], specifically its generalizability and the fact that intergroup contact can result in an increase rather than decrease in prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, John; Durrheim, Kevin; Tredoux, Colin (2005). "Beyond the optimal contact strategy: A reality check for the contact hypothesis". American Psychologist. 60 (7): 697–711.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barlow, F. K.; Paolini, S.; Pedersen, A.; Hornsey, M. J.; Radke, H. R. M.; Harwood, J.; Rubin, M.; Sibley, C. G. (2012). "The contact caveat: Negative contact predicts increased prejudice more than positive contact predicts reduced prejudice". Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin. 38 (12): 1629–1643. doi:10.1177/0146167212457953. &lt;nowiki&gt;PMID 22941796&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Realistic Conflict Theory ===
{{Main|Realistic conflict theory}}[[Realistic conflict theory|Realistic Conflict Theory]] (RCT), also known as Realistic Group Conflict Theory (RGCT), is a model of [[Group conflict|intergroup conflict]] that describes how conflict and [[prejudice]] between groups stems from conflicting goals and competition for limited resources.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Jay W (1993). "Realistic Group Conflict Theory: A Review and Evaluation of the Theoretical and Empirical Literature". Psychological Record. 43 (3): 395–415.&lt;/ref&gt; Groups may compete for concrete resources such as money and land or abstract resources such as political power and social status which leads to hostility-perpetuating [[Zero-sum thinking|zero-sum beliefs]].&lt;ref&gt;Baumeister, R.F. &amp; Vohs, K.D. (2007). "Realistic Group Conflict Theory". Encyclopedia of Social Psychology. 2: 725–726.&lt;/ref&gt; The RCT was originally proposed by [[Donald T. Campbell]] and was later elaborated on in classic experiments by [[Muzafer Sherif]] and [[Carolyn Sherif|Carolyn Wood Sherif]].&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, D.T. (1965). Ethnocentric and Other Altruistic Motives. Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press. pp. 283–311.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherif, M. 1961 pp. 155"&gt;Sherif, M.; Harvey, O.J.; White, B.J.; Hood, W. &amp; Sherif, C.W. (1961). Intergroup Conflict and Cooperation: The Robbers Cave Experiment. Norman, OK: The University Book Exchange. pp. 155–184.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sherifs' Robbers Cave experiment provided evidence for the RCT by arbitrarily assigning boys at a summer camp with similar backgrounds to different groups. The boys in these groups then competed with each other and elicited hostile outgroup beliefs until a superordinate, cooperative goal was imposed that required the groups to work together resulting in decreased feelings of intergroup hostility.&lt;ref name="Sherif, M. 1961 pp. 155"/&gt;

=== Social Identity Approach ===
{{Main|Social identity approach|Self-categorization theory|Social identity theory}}Relations between groups and group-members are based on individuals first categorizing themselves into meaningful social groups. In the 1970s and 80s, [[Henri Tajfel]] and [[John Turner (psychologist)|John Turner]] proposed two connected theories of social identity, [[self-categorization theory]] and [[social identity theory]], that together form a method for understanding the psychological processes underlying how individuals make sense of their identities and group membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/457164088|title=Rediscovering social identity : key readings|date=2010|publisher=Psychology Press|others=Postmes, T. (Tom), Branscombe, Nyla R.|isbn=9781841694917|location=New York, NY|oclc=457164088}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Self-categorization theory]] explains the contexts in which an individual perceives a collection of people as a group and the psychological processes that result from an individual perceiving people in terms of a group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/28221607|title=Stereotyping and social reality|last=J.|first=Oakes, Penelope|date=1994|publisher=Blackwell|others=Haslam, S. Alexander., Turner, John C., 1947-|isbn=0631188711|location=Oxford, UK|oclc=28221607}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Social identity theory]] describes how individual identity is shaped by membership in a social group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/4194174|title=The Social psychology of intergroup relations|date=1979|publisher=Brooks/Cole Pub. Co|others=Austin, William G., Worchel, Stephen.|isbn=0818502789|location=Monterey, Calif.|oclc=4194174}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also predicts differences in intergroup behavior based on perceived status differences between social groups, the legitimacy and stability of those perceived status differences, and ability to move between social groups.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Tajfel, H., &amp; Turner, J. C. (1979). "An integrative theory of intergroup conflict". In W. G. Austin &amp; S. Worchel. ''The social psychology of intergroup relations''.

"Some current issues in research on social identity and self-categorization theories". ''Social identity''. Oxford: Blackwell: 6–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[social identity approach]] has had a wide-ranging impact on [[social psychology]], influencing theory on topics such as [[social influence]],&lt;ref&gt;Turner, J. C. (1991). Social influence. Milton Keynes: Open University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[self-stereotyping]],&lt;ref&gt;McGarty, C. (1999). Categorization in social psychology. Sage Publications: London, Thousand Oaks, New Delhi.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[personality]].&lt;ref&gt;Turner, J. C.; Onorato, R. S. (1998). Tyler, T. R.; Kramer, R. M.; John, O. P., eds. "Social identity, personality, and the self-concept: A self-categorization perspective". The Psychology of the Social Self: 11–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current Directions ==
Early research on intergroup relations focused on understanding the processes behind group interactions and dynamics, constructing theories to explain these processes and related psychological phenomena. Presently, intergroup relations is characterized by researchers applying and refining these theories in the context of modern social issues such as [[discrimination]] based on [[gender identity]], [[sexual orientation]], [[Race and ethnicity in the United States|race/ethnicity]], and [[religion]].

=== Prejudice Reduction ===
Theories from intergroup relations research have informed many [[approaches to prejudice reduction]]. Researchers have focused on developing theoretical frameworks for understanding how to effectively reduce [[Group conflict|intergroup conflict]] and [[prejudice]]. For example, a recent intervention developed by [[Patricia Devine]] and colleagues focuses on training individuals to overcome cognitive biases and reduce implicit bias. The intervention resulted in reduced implicit bias up to 2 months after the intervention was administered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Devine|first=Patricia G.|last2=Forscher|first2=Patrick S.|last3=Austin|first3=Anthony J.|last4=Cox|first4=William T.L.|date=2012|title=Long-term reduction in implicit race bias: A prejudice habit-breaking intervention|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022103112001369|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=48|issue=6|pages=1267–1278|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2012.06.003|issn=0022-1031|pmc=3603687|pmid=23524616|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable Figures ==

=== Kurt Lewin  ===
{{Main|Kurt Lewin}}[[Kurt Lewin]] is considered to be one of the founding fathers of [[social psychology]] and made major contributions to psychological research. Lewin founded the [http://www.rcgd.isr.umich.edu/ Research Center for Group Dynamics] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] in 1945:

"Lewin was interested in the scientific study of the processes that influence individuals in group situations, and the center initially focused on group productivity; communication; social perception; intergroup relations; group membership; leadership and improving the functioning of groups"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcgd.isr.umich.edu/|title=Research Center for Group Dynamics|website=www.rcgd.isr.umich.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewin coined the term [[group dynamics]] to describe how individuals and groups behave differently depending on their environmental context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/842246442|title=Group dynamics|last=Forsyth|first=Donelson R.|date=|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning|year=2014|isbn=9781133956532|edition= 6th|location=Belmont, CA|pages=|oclc=842246442}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of intergroup relations, he applied his formula of ''B'' = ''ƒ''(''P'', ''E'') - behavior is a function of the person and their environment - to group behavior. The theory behind this formula, which emphasizes that context shapes behavior in conjunction with an individual's motivations and beliefs, is a cornerstone of social psychological research.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Gordon Allport ===
{{Main|Gordon Allport}}

The American social psychologist [[Gordon Allport]] is considered to be one of the pioneers of the psychological study of intergroup relations. Especially influential is Allport's 1954 book ''[[The Nature of Prejudice]]'', which proposed the [[contact hypothesis]] and has provided a foundation for research in the area since the mid-1950s.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Allport, G. W. (1954). The nature of prejudice. Cambridge, MA: Perseus Books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iess" /&gt;

=== Muzafer Sherif and Carolyn Wood Sherif ===
{{Main|Muzafer Sherif|Carolyn Sherif}}Other influential researchers on intergroup relations include [[Muzafer Sherif]] and [[Carolyn Sherif|Carolyn Wood Sherif]], who performed multiple notable experiments on the subject in the mid-20th century; these experiments formed the basis for [[realistic conflict theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sk.sagepub.com/reference/processes/n232.xml|title=Sherif, Muzafer (19061988)|last=Vaughan|first=Graham M.|date=2010|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|pages=754–756|access-date=2018-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muzafer Sherif's research was informed by his experiences studying discrimination and social pressures in the United States and in Turkey, and he was motivated to understand the psychology of [[group conflict]].

=== Solomon Asch ===
{{Main|Solomon Asch}}

[[Asch conformity experiments|Solomon Asch's work on conformity]] in the 1950s also helped shape the study of intergroup relations by exploring the social pressures to adhere to group attitudes and behavior. This research first shed light on the how the social pressures of group membership influence individuals to adhere their behavior, attitudes, and beliefs to [[Social norm|group norms]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Asch|first=Solomon E.|date=1955|title=Opinions and Social Pressure|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/scientificamerican1155-31|journal=Scientific American|volume=193|issue=5|pages=31–35|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1155-31|issn=0036-8733}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/11112922|title=Handbook of social psychology|date=1985|publisher=Random House|others=Lindzey, Gardner., Aronson, Elliot.|isbn=0394350499|edition=3rd|location=New York|oclc=11112922}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asch's research, along with [[Stanley Milgram shock experiments|Stanley Milgram's shock expriments]], shed light on the psychological processes underlying [[Obedience (human behavior)|obedience]], [[conformity]], and authority.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Henri Tajfel and John Turner ===
{{Main|Henri Tajfel|John Turner (psychologist)}}

British psychologists [[Henri Tajfel]] and [[John Turner (psychologist)|John Turner]] developed [[social identity theory]] and later [[self-categorization theory]], pioneering the [[social identity approach]] in psychology in the 1970s and 80s. Tajfel &amp; Turner were among the first psychologists to study the importance of social group membership and explored how whichever group membership was most salient determined behavior and beliefs in the group context.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Lee Ross ===
{{Main article|Lee Ross}}[[Lee Ross]] has conducted research on several psychological phenomena closely related to intergroup relations including the [[fundamental attribution error]], [[belief perseverance]], and most recently [[Naïve realism (psychology)|naive realism]] - the idea that we believe they see the world objectively and that those who disagree with us must be irrational or biased.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, L., &amp; Ward, A. (1996). Naive realism in everyday life: Implications for social conflict and misunderstanding. In T. Brown, E. S. Reed &amp; E. Turiel (Eds.), ''Values and Knowledge'' (pp. 103–135). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; Ross studied many of these concepts as they apply [[conflict resolution]] and worked on negotiation and resolution efforts in Northern Ireland during [[The Troubles]] and in the middle east in the wake of the [[Gulf War]].&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ravindran|first=Sandeep|date=2012-05-08|title=Profile of Lee D.

In 1984, Ross co-founded the [https://law.stanford.edu/stanford-center-on-international-conflict-and-negotiation-scicn/ Stanford Center on International Conflict and Negotiation (SCICN)], an interdisciplinary research center focused on applying findings from [[psychology]], [[law]], and [[sociology]] to help resolve international socio-political conflicts. &lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Susan Fiske ===
{{Main|Susan Fiske}}[[Susan Fiske]], along with her colleagues [[Amy Cuddy]], Peter Glick, and Jun Xu, developed the [[stereotype content model]] which states that stereotypes and intergroup impressions are formed along two dimensions: warmth and competence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fiske|first=Susan T.|last2=Cuddy|first2=Amy J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10812">'''Irenicism''' in [[Christian theology]] refers to attempts to unify Christian [[apologetical]] systems by using [[reason]] as an essential attribute. The word is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''ειρήνη (eirene)'' meaning [[peace]]. It is a concept related to [[natural theology]] and opposed to [[polemicism]] (war-like argumentation) being rooted in the ideals of [[pacifism]]{{fact|date=June 2017}}. Those who affiliate themselves with irenicism identify the importance of unity in the Christian church, and declare the common bond between all Christians under [[Christ]].

==Erasmus and his influence==

[[Desiderius Erasmus]] was a [[Christian humanist]] and reformer, in the sense of checking clerical abuses, honoring inner [[piety]], considering reason as meaningful in theology as in other ways. He also promoted the notion that  Christianity must remain under one church, both theologically and literally; under the body of the [[Catholic Church]]. Since his time, irenicism has postulated removing conflicts between different Christian creeds by way of mediation and gradual amalgamation of theological differences. Erasmus wrote extensively on topics related generally to peace, and an irenic approach is part of the texture of his thought, both on theology and in relation to politics:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Despite the frequency and severity of polemics directed against him, Erasmus continued ... to practice a kind of discourse that is critical and ironic, yet modest and irenic.&lt;ref&gt;Terence J. Martin, ''Living Words: Studies in Dialogues about Religion'' (1998), p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Certain important irenic contributions from Erasmus helped to further the humanist consideration of themes of peace and religious conciliation; these included the ''Inquisitio de fide'' (1524), arguing against the papal opinion that [[Martin Luther]] was a heretic, and ''De sarcienda ecclesiae concordia'' (1533). Erasmus had close associates sharing his views ([[Julius von Pflug]], [[Christoph von Stadion]], and [[Jakob Ziegler]]), and was followed on the Catholic side by [[George Cassander]] and [[Georg Witzel]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter G. Bietenholz, Thomas Brian Deutscher, ''Contemporaries of Erasmus: A Biographical Register of the Renaissance and Reformation'' (2003), p. 78, p. 275 and p. 475.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.science.uva.nl/~seop/archives/win2008/entries/erasmus/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nick Thompson, ''The Long Reach of Reformation Irenicism: the Considerationes Modestae et Pacificae of William Forbes (1585–1634).'' pp. 124–147 in ''Reforming the Reformation'' (2004); [http://www.abdn.ac.uk/~wad005/documents/forbes.pdf PDF] (at p. 2 and p. 8).&lt;/ref&gt; 

The influence of Erasmus was, however, limited, by the virtual exclusion of his works from countries such as France, from 1525, at least in the open; though they did appear in numerous forms and translations. James Hutton speaks of "the surreptitious manner in which Erasmus' peace propaganda reached the French public."&lt;ref&gt;James Hutton, ''Themes of Peace in Renaissance Poetry'' (1984), p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Franciscus Junius (the elder)|Franciscus Junius]] published in 1593 ''Le paisible Chrestien'' arguing for [[religious tolerance]] and [[Ecumenism]]. He addressed [[Philip II of Spain]], using arguments taken from the French ''[[politique]]'' statesman [[Michel de l'Hôpital]] and reformer [[Sebastian Castellio]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin van Gelderen, ''The Political Thought of the Dutch Revolt 1555–1590'' (2002), p. 83; [https://books.google.com/books?id=hXK2fxzn2lAC&amp;pg=PA83 Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt;

==17th century: Catholics and Protestants==
Irenic movements were influential in the 17th century, and irenicism, for example in the form of [[Gottfried Leibniz]]'s efforts to reunite Catholics and Protestants, is in some ways a forerunner to the more modern [[ecumenical]] movements.

The 1589 ''Examen pacifique de la doctrine des Huguenots'' by [[Henry Constable]] proved influential, for example on [[Christopher Potter]] and [[William Forbes (bishop)|William Forbes]]. [[Richard Montagu]] admired Cassander and [[Andreas Fricius]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Milton, ''Catholic and Reformed: The Roman and Protestant Churches in English Protestant Thought, 1600–1640'' (2002), pp. 248–9; [https://books.google.com/books?id=stwluHDJsQgC&amp;pg=PA248 Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt; The 1628 ''Syllabus aliquot synodorum'' was a bibliography of the literature of religious concord, compiled by [[Jean Hotman, Marquis de Villers-St-Paul]] decades earlier, and seen into print by [[Hugo Grotius]] using the pseudonym "Theodosius Irenaeus," with a preface by [[Matthias Bernegger]].&lt;ref&gt;W. B. Patterson, ''King James VI and I and the Reunion of Christendom'' (2000), p. 149; [https://books.google.com/books?id=zYK_Czpa1WwC&amp;pg=PA149 Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt;  

It was typical enough, however, for moderate and even irenical writers on the Catholic side to find in this period that their arguments were turned back against Catholicism. This style of arguing developed in England from [[Thomas Bell (priest)|Thomas Bell]] and particularly [[Thomas Morton (bishop)|Thomas Morton]]. It led to [[Thomas James]] mining [[Marcantonio de Dominis]] and [[Paolo Sarpi]], and making efforts to claim Witzel for the Protestant tradition; to the arguments of [[Gallicanism]] being welcomed but also treated as particularly insidious; and an irenist such as [[Francis a Sancta Clara]] being attacked strongly by firm [[Calvinist]]s. The handful of Protestant writers who were convinced in their irenic approach to Catholics included [[William Covell]] and [[Thomas Dove (theologian)|Thomas Dove]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Milton, ''Catholic and Reformed: The Roman and Protestant Churches in English Protestant Thought, 1600–1640'' (2002), pp. 233–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==17th century: Protestant divisions==
[[James I of England]] thought that the Bible translation he commissioned might effect some reconciliation between the English Protestant religious factions, and prove an ''irenicon''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Adam |last=Nicolson |title=God's Secretaries |year=2003 |page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek ἐιρηνικόν (''eirenikon'') or peace proposal is also seen as ''irenicum'' in its Latin version.

An irenic literature developed, relating to divisions within Protestantism, particularly in the twenty years after the [[Peace of Westphalia]]. Examples marked out by title are:

*[[David Pareus]], ''Irenicum sive de unione et synodo Evangelicorum'' (1614)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ccel.org/s/schaff/encyc/encyc11/htm/old/0238=218.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[John Forbes (died 1648)|John Forbes]], ''Irenicum Amatoribus Veritatis et Pacis in Ecclesia Scotiana'' (Aberdeen, 1629)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ccel.org/s/schaff/encyc/encyc04/htm/0356=340.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Jeremiah Burroughs]], ''Irenicum'' (1653)
*[[John Dury]], ''Irenicum: in quo casus conscientiæ inter ecclesias evangelicas pacis, breviter proponuntur &amp; decidunter'' (1654)
*[[Daniel Zwicker]], ''Irenicum irenicorum'' (1658)
*[[Edward Stillingfleet]], ''Irenicum: A Weapon Salve for the Church's Wounds'' (1659 and 1661)  
*[[Matthew Newcomen]]. ''Irenicum; or, An essay towards a brotherly peace &amp; union, between those of the congregational and presbyterian way'' (1659)
*[[Moses Amyraut]], ''Irenicum sive de ratione pacis in religionis negotio inter Evangelicos'' (1662)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/creeds1.ix.ii.xi.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Samuel Mather (minister)|Samuel Mather]], ''Irenicum: or an Essay for Union'' (1680)

[[Isaac Newton]] wrote an ''Irenicum'' (unpublished manuscript); it supported a [[latitudinarian]] position in theology, derived from a review of church history.&lt;ref&gt;James E. Force, [[Richard Henry Popkin]], ''Newton and Religion: Context, Nature, and Influence'' (1999), p. 146 and p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evaluation of early modern irenicism==
Anthony Milton writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Ecumenical historians] have tended to assume the existence of an irenical 'essentialism' in which the association of Christian unity with peace, toleration and ecumenism is presupposed. [...] In fact, most thinkers of this period accepted that religious unity was a good idea, in the same way that they believed that sin was a bad idea. The problem was that, of course, different people wanted irenicism on different terms. [...] Different interpretations of irenicism could have direct political implications, making the rhetoric of Christian unity an important tool in the political conflicts of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Milton, ''’The Unchanged Peacemaker’? John Dury and the politics of Irenicism in England, 1628–1643'', p. 96 in Mark Greengrass (editor), ''Samuel Hartlib and Universal Reformation: Studies in Intellectual Communication'' (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is in that light that he comments on the irenists' succession: Erasmus, Cassander, [[Jacob Acontius]], Grotius, then John Dury, who spent much time on a proposed reconciliation of Lutherans and Calvinists.

==Modern usage==

''Irenical'' has become a commonly used adjective to design an idealist and pacific conception, such as the [[democratic peace theory]]. 

''False irenicism'' or ''false eirenism'' is an expression used in certain 20th-century documents of the Catholic Church to criticize attempts at ecumenism that would allow Catholic doctrine to be distorted or clouded. Documents using the term include the encyclical ''[[Humani generis]]'', promulgated by [[Pope Pius XII]] in 1950, the [[Second Vatican Council]]'s 1964 Decree on [[Ecumenism]], ''[[Unitatis Redintegratio]],'' and [[Pope John Paul II]]'s 1984 post-synodal apostolic exhortation, ''[[Reconciliatio et paenitentia]]''.

Taylor, like many of the organizations he is associated with, is often described as promoting [[Racism|racist ideologies]] by, among others, civil rights groups, news media, and academics studying racism in the U.S.&lt;ref name="Roddy"/&gt;&lt;ref name=splc2&gt;[http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-files/groups/american-renaissance American Renaissance] Southern Poverty Law Center&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sussman2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Atkins2011pp59-60"/&gt;

==Early life and education==
Taylor was born on September 15, 1951, to Christian [[missionary]] parents in [[Kobe]], Japan. He lived in Japan until he was 16 years old and attended Japanese public school up to the age of 12, becoming fluent in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] in the process.&lt;ref name="Swain2003p87"&gt;{{Harvnb|Swain|Nieli|2003|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|reason=Nothing in the source says "public school" or "up to the age of 12". Furthermore, if he was born and raised in Japan, surrounded by people speaking Japanese, then saying he "became fluent in Japanese in the process" (or even something closer to the source's "he learned to speak fluent Japanese") is problematic, as he is probably natively bilingual, having "acquired" Japanese naturally the same way he acquired the language of his parents and the same way most Japanese children acquire Japanese; you would not say Shinzo Abe "became fluent in Japanese in the process of living in Japan and attending school".|date=October 2018}}

He graduated from [[Yale University]] in 1973 with a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in philosophy.&lt;ref name="adl1"&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://archive.adl.org/learn/ext_us/jared_taylor/background.html?LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&amp;xpicked=2&amp;item=taylor|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818042017/http://archive.adl.org/learn/ext_us/jared_taylor/background.html?LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&amp;xpicked=2&amp;item=taylor |archive-date=August 18, 2016 |title=Jared Taylor/American Renaissance|publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League]]|access-date=2017-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received an [[Master of Arts|MA]] in international economics at the [[Sciences Po|Paris Institute of Political Studies]] in 1978.

==Views==
Taylor has been described as a [[White nationalism|white nationalist]],&lt;ref&gt;
*[[Leonard Zeskind]], ''Blood and Politics: The History of the White Nationalist Movement from the Margins to the Mainstream'' (Farrar, Straud and Giroux, 2009), p. 370 &amp; 427: "Taylor began his public foray into the white nationalist arena with a newsletter he edited called ''American Renaissance''... Taylor, by eschewing conspiracy mongering and what they called 'paramilitary infantilism,' gave white nationalism greater potential access to the conservative mainstream."
*Roxanne Lynn Doty, ''The Law Into Their Own Hands: Immigration and the Politics of Exceptionalism'' (University of Arizona Press, 2009), p. 61: "One of the more prominent members of the new white nationalism is Jared Taylor, editor of ''American Renaissance''."

This doesn't mean that I want America to become Asian.

Taylor describes himself as an advocate for white interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Swain|Nieli|2003|pp=87–88}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He states that his journal, ''American Renaissance'', was founded to provide such a voice for white interests, and argues that its work is analogous to other interest groups that advocate for ethnic or racial groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Swain|Nieli|2003|p=88}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in that journal in 2005, he stated, "Blacks and whites are different.

Taylor supports immigration policies that would favor white immigrants over other groups. Taylor is noted as saying, "Whites deserve a homeland," and when questioned about the US immigration laws passed in 1965, under the [[Hart-Celler Act]], said that "Whites are making a terrible mistake by setting in motion forces that will reduce them to a minority."&lt;ref&gt;Jared Taylor, in an interview with ABC News' Amna Nawaz, on 26 March 2017; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z90KJWk3dPY Jared Taylor, ABC Interview 2017].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism and anti-Semitism===
Kathleen R. Arnold a professor from the  Political Science department at [[DePaul University]] states, "unlike many other white supremacists, Taylor is not [[anti-Semitic]], and in fact encourages Jews to join his fight...however many within the white supremacist/[[Opposition to immigration#United States|anti-immigration movement]] disagree with Taylor..... and he has been under tremendous pressure to break ties with the Jewish community."&lt;ref name="Arnold2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kathleen R.

===Donald Trump===

==Reception==
The [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] describes Taylor as "a courtly presenter of ideas that most would describe as crudely white supremacist—a kind of modern-day version of the refined but racist colonialist of old."&lt;ref name="splc"/&gt;

Mark Potok and Heidi Beirich, writers in the ''[[Intelligence Report]]'' (a publication of the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]]), have written that "Jared Taylor is the cultivated, cosmopolitan face of white supremacy. He is the guy who is providing the intellectual heft, in effect, to modern-day Klansmen." They have also stated that "''American Renaissance'' has become increasingly important over the years, bringing a measure of intellectualism and seriousness to the typically thug-dominated world of white supremacy".&lt;ref name=differences&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=644&amp;printable=1|title=Schism Threatens White Nationalist Group|publisher=''[[Intelligence Report]]''|date=Summer 2006|accessdate=July 20, 2010|author=Mark Potok|author2=Heidi Beirich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 feature in the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' described Taylor as "a racist in the guise of expert".&lt;ref name="Roddy"&gt;"[http://www.post-gazette.com/life/dennis-roddy/2005/01/23/Jared-Taylor-a-racist-in-the-guise-of-expert/stories/200501230176 Jared Taylor, a Racist in the Guise of 'Expert']". Dennis Roddy. ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette''. January 23, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2330">The '''law of contagion''' is a magical law that suggests that once two people or objects have been in contact a magical link persists between them unless or until a formal [[Ritual purification|cleansing]], [[consecration]], [[exorcism]], or other act of [[banishing]] breaks the non-material bond. The first description of the law of contagion appeared in ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' by [[James George Frazer]]. [[Isaac Bonewits|Bonewits and Bonewits]] have noted parallels in quantum physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bonewits|first1=Phaedra|last2=Bonewits|first2=Isaac|title=Real Energy: Systems, Spirits, and Substances to Heal, Change, and Grow|date=2007|publisher=New Page Books|location=[[Franklin Lakes, New Jersey]]|isbn=1564149048|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits and dangers==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
According to this law, contagion has both dangers and benefits. Benefits, for example, include that the holiness of a [[saint]], [[god]] or other venerated figure confers benefits to [[relic]]s, as do [[temple]]s and [[church (building)|churches]], by virtue of their having [[religious]] [[ritual]]s conducted within them. [[Psychics]] and [[mediumship|mediums]] commonly utilize an object once owned by a missing or deceased subject as their "focus" for [[psychometry (paranormal)|psychometry]] or [[clairvoyance]] or during [[séance]]s.

Dangers include, for example, a [[magician (paranormal)|sorcerer]] or [[witch]] might acquire a lock of hair, [[nail clipping]] or scrap of clothing in order to facilitate a [[curse]]. [[Voodoo doll]]s resemble the victim and often incorporate hair or clothing from them. In cultures that practice sorcery individuals often exercise care that their hair or nails do not end up in the hands of sorcerers.

==Unconscious belief in the law of contagion==
Even among people who do not profess a belief in magic, [[psychological experiment]]s have shown a reluctance on the part of the public to, say, try on a sweater worn by a [[serial murderer]].{{citation required|date=July 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3805">In [[economics]], '''marginal concepts''' are associated with a ''specific change'' in the quantity used of a [[Good (economics)|good]] or [[Service (economics)|service]], as opposed to some notion of the over-all significance of that class of good or service, or of some total quantity thereof.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

== Marginality ==

Constraints are conceptualized as a ''border'' or ''margin''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Wicksteed|Wicksteed, Philip Henry]]; ''The Common Sense of Political Economy'' (1910), Bk I Ch 2 and elsewhere.&lt;/ref&gt;  The location of the margin for any individual corresponds to his or her ''endowment'', broadly conceived to include opportunities.  This endowment is determined by many things including physical laws (which constrain how forms of energy and matter may be transformed), accidents of nature (which determine the presence of natural resources), and the outcomes of past decisions made both by others and by the individual himself or herself.

A value that holds true given particular constraints is a [[marginal value|''marginal'' value]].  A change that would be affected as or by a specific loosening or tightening of those constraints is a ''marginal'' change, as large as the smallest relevant division of that good or service.&lt;ref name="wieser_ein"&gt;von Wieser, Friedrich; ''Über den Ursprung und die Hauptgesetze des wirtschaftlichen Wertes'' &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''The Nature and Essence of Theoretical Economics''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; (1884), p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;  For reasons of tractability, it is often assumed in [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical analysis]] that goods and services are [[Continuum (theory)|continuously divisible]].  In such context, a marginal change may be an [[infinitesimal]] change or a [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]].  However, strictly speaking, the smallest relevant division may be quite large.

== Some important marginal concepts ==

The '''[[marginal use]]''' of a [[Good (economics)|good or service]] is the specific use to which an agent would put a given increase, or the specific use of the good or service that would be abandoned in response to a given decrease.&lt;ref name="wieser_ein" /&gt;

The '''[[marginal utility]]''' of a [[Good (economics)|good or service]] is the [[utility]] of the specific use to which an agent would put a given increase in that good or service, or of the specific use that would be abandoned in response to a given decrease.  In other words, marginal utility is the utility of the  [[marginal use]].

The '''[[marginal rate of substitution]]''' is the rate of substitution is the least favorable rate, at the margin, at which an agent is willing to exchange units of one good or service for units of another.

A '''[[marginal benefit]]''' is a benefit (howsoever ranked or measured) associated with a marginal change.

The term “'''[[marginal cost]]'''” may refer to an [[opportunity cost]] at the margin, or to marginal ''[[Money|pecuniary]]'' cost — that is to say marginal cost measured by forgone money.

Other marginal concepts include (but are not limited to):
* [[marginal product|marginal physical product]] (sometimes also known as “marginal product”)
* [[marginal rate of transformation]], the rate at which one output or result must be sacrificed in order to increase another output or result
* [[marginal revenue product]]
* [[marginal propensity to save]] and [[marginal propensity to consume|consume]]
* [[marginal tax rate]]

'''[[Marginalism]]''' is the use of marginal concepts to explain economic phenomena.

The related concept of [[elasticity (economics)|elasticity]] is the ratio of the incremental percentage change in one variable with respect to an incremental percentage change in another variable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7392">A '''metasystem transition''' is the [[emergence]], through [[evolution]], of a higher [[:wikt:level|level]] of [[organization]] or [[Control theory|control]].

A [[metasystem]] is formed by the integration of a number of initially independent components, such as [[molecules]] (as theorized for instance by [[Hypercycle_(chemistry)|hypercycles]]), [[cell (biology)|cells]], or individuals, and the emergence of a system steering or controlling their interactions. As such, the collective of components becomes a new, goal-directed [[individual]], capable of acting in a coordinated way. This metasystem is more [[Complex systems|complex]], more [[intelligent]], and more flexible in its actions than the initial component systems. Prime examples are the [[origin of life]], the transition from unicellular to [[multicellular]] organisms, the emergence of [[eusociality]] or [[symbol]]ic [[thought]]. 

The concept of metasystem transition was introduced by the cybernetician [[Valentin Turchin]] in his 1970 book ''The Phenomenon of Science'', and developed among others by [[Francis Heylighen]] in the [[Principia Cybernetica]] Project. The related notion of [[The Major Transitions in Evolution|evolutionary transition]] was proposed by the biologists [[John Maynard Smith]] and [[Eörs Szathmáry]], in their 1995 book ''[[The Major Transitions in Evolution]]''.&lt;ref name="Major Transition"&gt;Smith, J. M., &amp; Szathmary, E. (1997). ''The Major Transitions in Evolution''. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Another related idea, that systems ("operators") evolve to become more complex by successive closures encapsulating components in a larger whole, is proposed in "[[the operator theory]]", developed by Gerard Jagers op Akkerhuis.

Turchin has applied the concept of metasystem transition in the domain of computing, via the notion of [[metacompilation]] or supercompilation. A supercompiler is a compiler program that compiles its own code, thus increasing its own efficiency, producing a remarkable speedup in its execution.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

== Evolutionary quanta ==

The following is the classical sequence of metasystem transitions in the history of animal evolution according to Turchin, from the origin of [[animal|animate]] life to [[sapience|sapient]] culture:

#''' Control of Position = [[motility|Motion]]''': the animal or agent develops the ability to control its position in space
# '''Control of Motion = [[sentience|Irritability]]''': the movement of the agent is no longer given, but a reaction to elementary sensations or stimuli
# '''Control of Irritability = [[Reflex]]''': different elementary sensations and their resulting actions are integrated into a coordinated, but still rigid, reflex-like behavior
# '''Control of Reflex = [[Association (psychology)|Association]]''': behavioral routines become flexible or adaptive, through the learning of new associations between experienced stimuli and actions
# '''Control of Association = [[Thought]]''': new routines no longer need to be learned through experience; they can be developed by abstract, symbolic [[reasoning]]
# '''Control of Thought = [[Culture]]''': symbols and concepts are no longer fixed entities; they  adapt through a process of [[cultural evolution]]

== Contemporary perspectives ==

[[File:Major Evolutionary Transitions digital.jpg|thumb|340px|Schematic timeline of information and replicators in the biosphere: [[The Major Transitions in Evolution|major evolutionary transitions]] in information processing&lt;ref name=" InfoBiosphere2016"/&gt;]]

Many{{who|date=December 2016}} argue that the next human metasystem transition consists of a merger of biological metasystems with technological metasystems, especially information processing technology. Several [[The Major Transitions in Evolution|cumulative major transitions of evolution]] have transformed life through key innovations in information storage and replication, including [[RNA]], [[DNA]], [[multicellularity]], and also [[language]] and [[culture]] as inter-human information processing systems.&lt;ref name="Major Transition"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jablonka, E., &amp; Szathmáry, E. (1995). The evolution of information storage and heredity. Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution, 10(5), 206–211. http://doi.org/10.1016/S0169-5347(00)89060-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Szathmáry, E. (2015).

''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'', 112(33), 10104–10111. http://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1421398112&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense it can be argued that the carbon-based biosphere has generated a [[cognitive system]] (humans) capable of creating technology that will result in a comparable evolutionary transition. "Digital information has reached a similar magnitude to information in the biosphere... Like previous evolutionary transitions, the potential symbiosis between biological and digital information will reach a critical point where these codes could compete via natural selection. Alternatively, this fusion could create a higher-level superorganism employing a low-conflict division of labor in performing informational tasks... humans already embrace fusions of biology and technology. We spend most of our waking time communicating through digitally mediated channels, ...most transactions on the stock market are executed by automated trading algorithms, and our electric grids are in the hands of artificial intelligence. With one in three marriages in America beginning online, digital algorithms are also taking a role in human pair bonding and reproduction".&lt;ref name="InfoBiosphere2016"&gt;[http://doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2015.12.013 "Information in the Biosphere: Biological and Digital Worlds"], Gillings, M.

In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[differential geometry]], a '''metric tensor''' is a type of function which takes as input a pair of [[tangent vector]]s {{mvar|v}} and {{mvar|w}} at a point of a surface (or higher dimensional [[differentiable manifold]]) and produces a [[real number]] [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] {{math|''g''(''v'', ''w'')}} in a way that generalizes many of the familiar properties of the [[dot product]] of [[Vector (geometry)|vectors]] in [[Euclidean space]].  In the same way as a dot product, metric tensors are used to define the length of and angle between tangent vectors.  Through [[integral|integration]], the metric tensor allows one to define and compute the length of curves on the manifold.

A metric tensor is called ''positive-definite'' if it assigns a positive value {{math|''g''(''v'', ''v'') &gt; 0}} to every nonzero vector {{mvar|v}}.  A manifold equipped with a positive-definite metric tensor is known as a [[Riemannian manifold]].  On a Riemannian manifold, the curve connecting two points that (locally) has the smallest length is called a [[geodesic]], and its length is the distance that a passenger in the manifold needs to traverse to go from one point to the other.  Equipped with this notion of length, a Riemannian manifold is a [[metric space]], meaning that it has a [[metric (mathematics)|distance function]] {{math|''d''(''p'', ''q'')}} whose value at a pair of points {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|q}} is the distance from {{mvar|p}} to {{mvar|q}}.  Conversely, the metric tensor itself is the [[derivative]] of the distance function (taken in a suitable manner).  Thus the metric tensor gives the ''infinitesimal'' distance on the manifold.

While the notion of a metric tensor was known in some sense to mathematicians such as [[Carl Gauss]] from the early 19th century, it was not until the early 20th century that its properties as a [[tensor]] were understood by, in particular, [[Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro]] and [[Tullio Levi-Civita]], who first codified the notion of a tensor.  The metric tensor is an example of a [[tensor field]].

The components of a metric tensor in a [[coordinate basis]] take on the form of a [[symmetric matrix]] whose entries transform [[covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariantly]] under changes to the coordinate system.  Thus a metric tensor is a covariant [[symmetric tensor]].  From the [[Coordinate-free|coordinate-independent]] point of view, a metric tensor field is defined to be a [[nondegenerate form|nondegenerate]] [[symmetric bilinear form]] on each tangent space that varies [[smooth function|smoothly]] from point to point.

==Introduction==
[[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] in his 1827 ''[[#CITEREFGauss1827|Disquisitiones generales circa superficies curvas]]'' (''General investigations of curved surfaces'') considered a surface [[parametric surface|parametrically]], with the [[Cartesian coordinates]] {{mvar|x}}, {{mvar|y}}, and {{mvar|z}} of points on the surface depending on two auxiliary variables {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}}. Thus a parametric surface is (in today's terms) a [[vector-valued function]]

:&lt;math&gt;\vec{r}(u,v) = \bigl( x(u,v), y(u,v), z(u,v) \bigr)&lt;/math&gt;

depending on an [[ordered pair]] of real variables {{math|(''u'', ''v'')}}, and defined in an [[open set]] {{mvar|D}} in the {{mvar|uv}}-plane. One of the chief aims of Gauss's investigations was to deduce those features of the surface which could be described by a function which would remain unchanged if the surface underwent a transformation in space (such as bending the surface without stretching it), or a change in the particular parametric form of the same geometrical surface.

One natural such invariant quantity is the [[arclength|length of a curve]] drawn along the surface. Another is the [[angle]] between a pair of curves drawn along the surface and meeting at a common point. A third such quantity is the [[area]] of a piece of the surface. The study of these invariants of a surface led Gauss to introduce the predecessor of the modern notion of the metric tensor.

===Arc length===
If the variables {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}} are taken to depend on a third variable, {{mvar|t}}, taking values in an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}, then {{math|{{vec|''r''}}(''u''(''t''), ''v''(''t''))}} will trace out a [[parametric curve]] in parametric surface {{mvar|M}}. The [[arc length]] of that curve is given by the [[integral]]

: &lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
  s &amp;= \int_a^b\left\|\frac{d}{dt}\vec{r}(u(t),v(t))\right\|\,dt \\
    &amp;= \int_a^b \sqrt{u'(t)^2\,\vec{r}_u\cdot\vec{r}_u + 2u'(t)v'(t)\, \vec{r}_u\cdot\vec{r}_v + v'(t)^2\,\vec{r}_v\cdot\vec{r}_v}\, dt \,,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \left\| \cdot \right\| &lt;/math&gt; represents the [[Norm (mathematics)#Euclidean norm|Euclidean norm]]. Here the [[chain rule]] has been applied, and the subscripts denote [[partial derivative]]s:

:&lt;math&gt;\vec{r}_u = \frac{\partial \vec{r}}{\partial u}\,, \quad \vec{r}_v = \frac{\partial \vec{r}}{\partial v}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The integrand is the restriction&lt;ref&gt;More precisely, the integrand is the [[pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]] of this differential to the curve.&lt;/ref&gt; to the curve of the square root of the ([[quadratic form|quadratic]]) [[differential (infinitesimal)|differential]]

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;(ds)^2 = E \,(du)^2 + 2F \,du\, dv + G\, (dv)^2 ,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

where

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
  E = \vec r_u \cdot \vec r_u, \quad
  F = \vec r_u \cdot \vec r_v , \quad
  G = \vec r_v \cdot \vec r_v .
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

The quantity {{mvar|ds}} in ({{EquationNote|1}}) is called the [[line element]], while {{math|''ds''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} is called the [[first fundamental form]] of {{mvar|M}}. Intuitively, it represents the [[principal part]] of the square of the displacement undergone by {{math|{{vec|''r''}}(''u'', ''v'')}} when {{mvar|u}} is increased by {{mvar|du}} units, and {{mvar|v}} is increased by {{mvar|dv}} units.

Using matrix notation, the first fundamental form becomes
:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 =
  \begin{bmatrix} du &amp; dv \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix} E &amp; F \\ F &amp; G \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix} du \\ dv \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Coordinate transformations===
Suppose now that a different parameterization is selected, by allowing {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}} to depend on another pair of variables {{math|''u''′}} and {{math|''v''′}}. Then the analog of ({{EquationNote|2}}) for the new variables is
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
  E' = \vec r_{u'} \cdot \vec r_{u'}, \quad
  F' = \vec r_{u'} \cdot \vec r_{v'}, \quad
  G' = \vec r_{v'} \cdot \vec r_{v'}.
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2'}}}}

The [[chain rule]] relates {{math|''E''′}}, {{math|''F''′}}, and {{math|''G''′}} to {{mvar|E}}, {{mvar|F}}, and {{mvar|G}} via the [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] equation

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} E' &amp; F' \\ F' &amp; G' \end{bmatrix} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \frac{\partial u}{\partial u'} &amp; \frac{\partial u}{\partial v'} \\
    \frac{\partial v}{\partial u'} &amp; \frac{\partial v}{\partial v'}
  \end{bmatrix}^\mathsf{T}
  \begin{bmatrix} E &amp; F \\ F &amp; G \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \frac{\partial u}{\partial u'} &amp; \frac{\partial u}{\partial v'} \\
    \frac{\partial v}{\partial u'} &amp; \frac{\partial v}{\partial v'}
  \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

where the superscript T denotes the [[matrix transpose]]. The matrix with the coefficients {{mvar|E}}, {{mvar|F}}, and {{mvar|G}} arranged in this way therefore transforms by the [[Jacobian matrix]] of the coordinate change

:&lt;math&gt;
  J = \begin{bmatrix}
    \frac{\partial u}{\partial u'} &amp; \frac{\partial u}{\partial v'} \\
    \frac{\partial v}{\partial u'} &amp; \frac{\partial v}{\partial v'}
\end{bmatrix}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

A matrix which transforms in this way is one kind of what is called a [[tensor]]. The matrix

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} E &amp; F \\ F &amp; G \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

with the transformation law ({{EquationNote|3}}) is known as the metric tensor of the surface.

===Invariance of arclength under coordinate transformations===
{{harvtxt|Ricci-Curbastro|Levi-Civita|1900}} first observed the significance of a system of coefficients {{mvar|E}}, {{mvar|F}}, and {{mvar|G}}, that transformed in this way on passing from one system of coordinates to another. The upshot is that the first fundamental form ({{EquationNote|1}}) is ''invariant'' under changes in the coordinate system, and that this follows exclusively from the transformation properties of {{mvar|E}}, {{mvar|F}}, and {{mvar|G}}. Indeed, by the chain rule,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} du \\ dv \end{bmatrix} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \frac{\partial u}{\partial u'} &amp; \frac{\partial u}{\partial v'} \\
    \frac{\partial v}{\partial u'} &amp; \frac{\partial v}{\partial v'}
  \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix} du' \\ dv' \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

so that

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  ds^2
  &amp;=
    \begin{bmatrix} du &amp; dv \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix} E &amp; F \\ F &amp; G \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix} du \\ dv \end{bmatrix} \\
  &amp;=
    \begin{bmatrix} du' &amp; dv' \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
      \frac{\partial u}{\partial u'} &amp; \frac{\partial u}{\partial v'} \\
      \frac{\partial v}{\partial u'} &amp; \frac{\partial v}{\partial v'}
    \end{bmatrix}^\mathsf{T}
    \begin{bmatrix} E &amp; F \\ F &amp; G \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
      \frac{\partial u}{\partial u'} &amp; \frac{\partial u}{\partial v'} \\
      \frac{\partial v}{\partial u'} &amp; \frac{\partial v}{\partial v'}
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix} du' \\ dv' \end{bmatrix} \\
  &amp;=
    \begin{bmatrix} du' &amp; dv' \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix} E' &amp; F' \\ F' &amp; G' \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix} du' \\ dv' \end{bmatrix}\\
  &amp;= \left(ds'\right)^2 \,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

===Length and angle===
Another interpretation of the metric tensor, also considered by Gauss, is that it provides a way in which to compute the length of [[tangent vector]]s to the surface, as well as the angle between two tangent vectors. In contemporary terms, the metric tensor allows one to compute the [[dot product]] of tangent vectors in a manner independent of the parametric description of the surface. Any tangent vector at a point of the parametric surface {{mvar|M}} can be written in the form

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} = p_1\vec{r}_u + p_2\vec{r}_v&lt;/math&gt;

for suitable real numbers {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}. If two tangent vectors are given:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \mathbf{a} &amp;= a_1\vec{r}_u + a_2\vec{r}_v \\
  \mathbf{b} &amp;= b_1\vec{r}_u + b_2\vec{r}_v
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

then using the [[bilinear transform|bilinearity]] of the dot product,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}
    &amp;= a_1 b_1 \vec{r}_u\cdot\vec{r}_u + a_1b_2 \vec{r}_u\cdot\vec{r}_v + b_1a_2 \vec{r}_v\cdot\vec{r}_u + a_2 b_2 \vec{r}_v\cdot\vec{r}_v \\[8pt]
    &amp;= a_1 b_1 E + a_1b_2 F + b_1a_2 F + a_2b_2G \\[8pt]
    &amp;= \begin{bmatrix} a_1 &amp; a_2 \end{bmatrix}
         \begin{bmatrix} E &amp; F \\ F &amp; G \end{bmatrix}
         \begin{bmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \end{bmatrix} \,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This is plainly a function of the four variables {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and {{math|''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}. It is more profitably viewed, however, as a function that takes a pair of arguments {{math|'''a''' {{=}} [''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]}} and {{math|'''b''' {{=}} [''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]}} which are vectors in the {{mvar|uv}}-plane. That is, put

:&lt;math&gt;g(\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b}) = a_1b_1 E + a_1b_2 F + b_1a_2 F + a_2b_2G \,.&lt;/math&gt;

This is a [[symmetric function]] in {{math|'''a'''}} and {{math|'''b'''}}, meaning that

:&lt;math&gt;g(\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b}) = g(\mathbf{b}, \mathbf{a})\,.&lt;/math&gt;

It is also [[bilinear form|bilinear]], meaning that it is [[linear functional|linear]] in each variable {{math|'''a'''}} and {{math|'''b'''}} separately. That is,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  g\left(\lambda\mathbf{a} + \mu\mathbf{a}', \mathbf{b}\right) &amp;= \lambda g(\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b}) + \mu g\left(\mathbf{a}', \mathbf{b}\right),\quad\text{and} \\
  g\left(\mathbf{a}, \lambda\mathbf{b} + \mu\mathbf{b}'\right) &amp;= \lambda g(\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b}) + \mu g\left(\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b}'\right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

for any vectors {{math|'''a'''}}, {{math|'''a'''′}}, {{math|'''b'''}}, and {{math|'''b'''′}} in the {{mvar|uv}} plane, and any real numbers {{mvar|μ}} and {{mvar|λ}}.

In particular, the length of a tangent vector {{math|'''a'''}} is given by

:&lt;math&gt; \left\| \mathbf{a} \right\| = \sqrt{g(\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{a})}&lt;/math&gt;

and the angle {{mvar|θ}} between two vectors {{math|'''a'''}} and {{math|'''b'''}} is calculated by

:&lt;math&gt;\cos(\theta) = \frac{g(\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b})}{ \left\| \mathbf{a} \right\| \left\| \mathbf{b} \right\| } \,.&lt;/math&gt;

===Area===
The [[surface area]] is another numerical quantity which should depend only on the surface itself, and not on how it is parameterized. If the surface {{mvar|M}} is parameterized by the function {{math|{{vec|''r''}}(''u'', ''v'')}} over the domain {{mvar|D}} in the {{mvar|uv}}-plane, then the surface area of {{mvar|M}} is given by the integral

:&lt;math&gt;\iint_D \left|\vec{r}_u \times \vec{r}_v\right|\,du\,dv&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|×}} denotes the [[cross product]], and the absolute value denotes the length of a vector in Euclidean space. By [[Lagrange's identity]] for the cross product, the integral can be written

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
       &amp;\iint_D \sqrt{\left(\vec{r}_u\cdot\vec{r}_u\right) \left(\vec{r}_v\cdot\vec{r}_v\right) - \left(\vec{r}_u\cdot\vec{r}_v\right)^2}\,du\,dv \\
   ={} &amp;\iint_D \sqrt{EG - F^2}\,du\,dv\\
   ={} &amp;\iint_D \sqrt{\operatorname{det}\begin{bmatrix} E &amp; F \\ F &amp; G \end{bmatrix}}\, du\, dv
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|det}} is the [[determinant]].

==Definition==
Let {{mvar|M}} be a [[smooth manifold]] of dimension {{mvar|n}}; for instance a [[surface (differential geometry)|surface]] (in the case {{math|''n'' {{=}} 2}}) or [[hypersurface]] in the [[Cartesian space]] {{math|'''ℝ'''&lt;sup&gt;''n'' + 1&lt;/sup&gt;}}. At each point {{math|''p'' ∈ ''M''}} there is a [[vector space]] {{math|T&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''}}, called the [[tangent space]], consisting of all tangent vectors to the manifold at the point {{mvar|p}}. A metric tensor at {{mvar|p}} is a function {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} which takes as inputs a pair of tangent vectors {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} at {{mvar|p}}, and produces as an output a [[real number]] ([[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]]), so that the following conditions are satisfied:
* {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is [[bilinear form|bilinear]]. A function of two vector arguments is bilinear if it is linear separately in each argument. Thus if {{math|''U''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are three tangent vectors at {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are real numbers, then
*:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  g_p\left(aU_p + bV_p, Y_p\right) &amp;= ag_p\left(U_p, Y_p\right) + bg_p\left(V_p, Y_p\right) \,, \quad \text{and} \\
  g_p\left(Y_p, aU_p + bV_p\right) &amp;= ag_p\left(Y_p, U_p\right) + bg_p\left(Y_p, V_p\right) \,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
* {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is [[symmetric function|symmetric]].&lt;ref&gt;In several formulations of [[classical unified field theories]], the metric tensor was allowed to be non-symmetric; however, the antisymmetric part of such a tensor plays no role in the contexts described here, so it will not be further considered.&lt;/ref&gt; A function of two vector arguments is symmetric provided that for all vectors {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}},
*:&lt;math&gt;g_p\left(X_p, Y_p\right) = g_p\left(Y_p, X_p\right)\,.&lt;/math&gt;
* {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is [[nondegenerate]]. A bilinear function is nondegenerate provided that, for every tangent vector {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; ≠ 0}}, the function
*:&lt;math&gt;Y_p\mapsto g_p\left(X_p,Y_p\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:obtained by holding {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} constant and allowing {{math|''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} to vary is not [[identically zero]]. That is, for every {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; ≠ 0}} there exists a {{math|''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} such that {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;) ≠ 0}}.

A metric tensor field {{mvar|g}} on {{mvar|M}} assigns to each point {{mvar|p}} of {{mvar|M}} a metric tensor {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} in the tangent space at {{mvar|p}} in a way that varies [[smooth function|smoothly]] with {{mvar|p}}. More precisely, given any [[open set|open subset]] {{mvar|U}} of manifold {{mvar|M}} and any (smooth) [[vector field]]s {{mvar|X}} and {{mvar|Y}} on {{mvar|U}}, the real function

:&lt;math&gt;g(X, Y)(p) = g_p\left(X_p, Y_p\right)&lt;/math&gt;

is a smooth function of {{mvar|p}}.

==Components of the metric==
{{Hatnote|This section assumes some familiarity with [[coordinate vector]]s.}}
The components of the metric in any [[basis of a vector space|basis]] of [[vector field]]s, or [[frame bundle|frame]], {{math|'''f''' {{=}}  (''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} are given by&lt;ref&gt;The notation of using square brackets to denote the basis in terms of which the components are calculated is not universal. The notation employed here is modeled on that of {{harvtxt|Wells|1980}}. Typically, such explicit dependence on the basis is entirely suppressed.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;g_{ij}[\mathbf{f}] = g\left(X_i, X_j\right).&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4}}}}
The {{math|''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} functions {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;['''f''']}} form the entries of an {{math|''n'' × ''n''}} [[symmetric matrix]], {{math|''G''['''f''']}}. If
:&lt;math&gt;v = \sum_{i=1}^n v^iX_i \,, \quad w = \sum_{i=1}^n w^iX_i&lt;/math&gt;
are two vectors at {{math|''p'' ∈ ''U''}}, then the value of the metric applied to {{mvar|v}} and {{mvar|w}} is determined by the coefficients ({{EquationNote|4}}) by bilinearity:

:&lt;math&gt;g(v, w) = \sum_{i,j=1}^n v^iw^jg\left(X_i,X_j\right) = \sum_{i,j=1}^n v^iw^jg_{ij}[\mathbf{f}]&lt;/math&gt;

Denoting the [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] {{math|(''g''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;['''f'''])}} by {{math|''G''['''f''']}} and arranging the components of the vectors {{mvar|v}} and {{mvar|w}} into [[column vector]]s {{math|'''v'''['''f''']}} and {{math|'''w'''['''f''']}},

:&lt;math&gt;g(v,w) = \mathbf{v}[\mathbf{f}]^\mathsf{T} G[\mathbf{f}] \mathbf{w}[\mathbf{f}] = \mathbf{w}[\mathbf{f}]^\mathsf{T} G[\mathbf{f}]\mathbf{v}[\mathbf{f}]&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''v'''['''f''']}}&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; and {{math|'''w'''['''f''']}}&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; denote the [[matrix transpose|transpose]] of the vectors {{math|'''v'''['''f''']}} and {{math|'''w'''['''f''']}}, respectively. Under a [[change of basis]] of the form

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f}\mapsto \mathbf{f}' = \left(\sum_k X_ka_{k1},\dots,\sum_k X_ka_{kn}\right) = \mathbf{f}A&lt;/math&gt;

for some [[invertible matrix|invertible]] {{math|''n'' × ''n''}} matrix {{math|''A'' {{=}} (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, the matrix of components of the metric changes by {{mvar|A}} as well. That is,

:&lt;math&gt;G[\mathbf{f}A] = A^\mathsf{T} G[\mathbf{f}]A&lt;/math&gt;

or, in terms of the entries of this matrix,

:&lt;math&gt;g_{ij}[\mathbf{f}A] = \sum_{k,l=1}^n a_{ki}g_{kl}[\mathbf{f}]a_{lj} \, .&lt;/math&gt;

For this reason, the system of quantities {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;['''f''']}} is said to transform covariantly with respect to changes in the frame {{math|'''f'''}}.

===Metric in coordinates===
A system of {{mvar|n}} real-valued functions {{math|(''x''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;)}}, giving a [[local coordinates|local coordinate system]] on an [[open set]] {{mvar|U}} in {{mvar|M}}, determines a basis of vector fields on {{mvar|U}}
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f} = \left(X_1 = \frac{\partial}{\partial x^1}, \dots, X_n = \frac{\partial}{\partial x^n}\right) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The metric {{mvar|g}} has components relative to this frame given by
:&lt;math&gt;g_{ij}\left[\mathbf{f}\right] = g\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}, \frac{\partial}{\partial x^j}\right) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Relative to a new system of local coordinates, say
:&lt;math&gt;y^i = y^i(x^1, x^2, \dots, x^n),\quad i=1,2,\dots,n&lt;/math&gt;

the metric tensor will determine a different matrix of coefficients,
:&lt;math&gt;g_{ij}\left[\mathbf{f}'\right] = g\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial y^i}, \frac{\partial}{\partial y^j}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

This new system of functions is related to the original {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;('''f''')}} by means of the [[chain rule]]
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial y^i} = \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{\partial x^k}{\partial y^i}\frac{\partial}{\partial x^k}&lt;/math&gt;

so that
:&lt;math&gt;g_{ij}\left[\mathbf{f}'\right] = \sum_{k,l=1}^n \frac{\partial x^k}{\partial y^i} g_{kl}\left[\mathbf{f}\right]\frac{\partial x^l}{\partial y^j}.&lt;/math&gt;

Or, in terms of the matrices {{math|''G''['''f'''] {{=}} (''g''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;['''f'''])}} and {{math|''G''['''f'''′] {{=}} (''g''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;['''f'''′])}},
:&lt;math&gt;G\left[\mathbf{f}'\right] = \left((Dy)^{-1}\right)^\mathsf{T} G\left[\mathbf{f}\right] (Dy)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|Dy}} denotes the [[Jacobian matrix]] of the coordinate change.

===Signature of a metric===
{{main|Metric signature}}

Associated to any metric tensor is the [[quadratic form]] defined in each tangent space by

:&lt;math&gt;q_m(X_m) = g_m(X_m,X_m) \,, \quad X_m\in T_mM.&lt;/math&gt;

If {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is positive for all non-zero {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, then the metric is [[definite bilinear form|positive-definite]] at {{mvar|m}}. If the metric is positive-definite at every {{math|''m'' ∈ ''M''}}, then {{mvar|g}} is called a [[Riemannian metric]]. More generally, if the quadratic forms {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;}} have constant [[signature of a quadratic form|signature]] independent of {{mvar|m}}, then the signature of {{mvar|g}} is this signature, and {{mvar|g}} is called a [[pseudo-Riemannian metric]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dodson|Poston|1991|loc=Chapter VII §3.04}}&lt;/ref&gt; If {{mvar|M}} is [[connected space|connected]], then the signature of {{mvar|q&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;}} does not depend on {{mvar|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vaughn|2007|loc=§3.4.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By [[Sylvester's law of inertia]], a basis of tangent vectors {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} can be chosen locally so that the quadratic form diagonalizes in the following manner

:&lt;math&gt;q_m\left(\sum_i\xi^iX_i\right) = \left(\xi^1\right)^2+\left(\xi^2\right)^2+\cdots+\left(\xi^p\right)^2 - \left(\xi^{p+1}\right)^2-\cdots-\left(\xi^n\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

for some {{mvar|p}} between 1 and {{mvar|n}}. Any two such expressions of {{mvar|q}} (at the same point {{mvar|m}} of {{mvar|M}}) will have the same number {{mvar|p}} of positive signs. The signature of {{mvar|g}} is the pair of integers {{math|(''p'', ''n'' − ''p'')}}, signifying that there are {{mvar|p}} positive signs and {{math|''n'' − ''p''}} negative signs in any such expression. Equivalently, the metric has signature {{math|(''p'', ''n'' − ''p'')}} if the matrix {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;}} of the metric has {{mvar|p}} positive and {{math|''n'' − ''p''}} negative [[eigenvalue]]s.

Certain metric signatures which arise frequently in applications are:
* If {{mvar|g}} has signature {{math|(''n'', 0)}}, then {{mvar|g}} is a Riemannian metric, and {{mvar|M}} is called a [[Riemannian manifold]]. Otherwise, {{mvar|g}} is a pseudo-Riemannian metric, and {{mvar|M}} is called a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]] (the term semi-Riemannian is also used).
* If {{mvar|M}} is four-dimensional with signature {{math|(1, 3)}} or {{math|(3, 1)}}, then the metric is called [[Lorentzian metric|Lorentzian]]. More generally, a metric tensor in dimension {{mvar|n}} other than 4 of signature {{math|(1, ''n'' − 1)}} or {{math|(''n'' − 1, 1)}} is sometimes also called Lorentzian.
* If {{mvar|M}} is {{math|2''n''}}-dimensional and {{mvar|g}} has signature {{math|(''n'', ''n'')}}, then the metric is called [[ultrahyperbolic metric|ultrahyperbolic]].

===Inverse metric===
Let {{math|'''f''' {{=}} (''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} be a basis of vector fields, and as above let {{math|''G''['''f''']}} be the matrix of coefficients
:&lt;math&gt;g_{ij}[\mathbf{f}] = g\left(X_i,X_j\right) \,.&lt;/math&gt;
One can consider the [[inverse matrix]] {{math|''G''['''f''']&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, which is identified with the '''inverse metric''' (or ''conjugate'' or ''dual metric''). The inverse metric satisfies a transformation law when the frame {{math|'''f'''}} is changed by a matrix {{mvar|A}} via

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;G[\mathbf{f}A]^{-1} = A^{-1}G[\mathbf{f}]^{-1}\left(A^{-1}\right)^\mathsf{T}.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|5}}}}

The inverse metric transforms ''[[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariantly]]'', or with respect to the inverse of the change of basis matrix {{mvar|A}}. Whereas the metric itself provides a way to measure the length of (or angle between) vector fields, the inverse metric supplies a means of measuring the length of (or angle between) [[covector]] fields; that is, fields of [[linear functional]]s.

To see this, suppose that {{mvar|α}} is a covector field. To wit, for each point {{mvar|p}}, {{mvar|α}} determines a function {{math|''α''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} defined on tangent vectors at {{mvar|p}} so that the following [[linear transformation|linearity]] condition holds for all tangent vectors {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and all real numbers {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_p \left(aX_p + bY_p\right) = a\alpha_p \left(X_p\right) + b\alpha_p \left(Y_p\right)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

As {{mvar|p}} varies, {{mvar|α}} is assumed to be a [[smooth function]] in the sense that

:&lt;math&gt;p \mapsto \alpha_p \left(X_p\right)&lt;/math&gt;

is a smooth function of {{mvar|p}} for any smooth vector field {{mvar|X}}.

Any covector field {{mvar|α}} has components in the basis of vector fields {{math|'''f'''}}. These are determined by

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_i = \alpha \left(X_i\right)\,,\quad i = 1, 2, \dots, n\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Denote the [[row vector]] of these components by

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha[\mathbf{f}] = \big\lbrack\begin{array}{cccc} \alpha_1 &amp; \alpha_2 &amp; \dots &amp; \alpha_n \end{array}\big\rbrack \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Under a change of {{math|'''f'''}} by a matrix {{mvar|A}}, {{math|''α''['''f''']}} changes by the rule

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha[\mathbf{f}A] = \alpha[\mathbf{f}]A \,.&lt;/math&gt;

That is, the row vector of components {{math|''α''['''f''']}} transforms as a ''covariant'' vector.

For a pair {{mvar|α}} and {{mvar|β}} of covector fields, define the inverse metric applied to these two covectors by

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\tilde{g}(\alpha,\beta) = \alpha[\mathbf{f}]G[\mathbf{f}]^{-1}\beta[\mathbf{f}]^\mathsf{T}.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|6}}}}

The resulting definition, although it involves the choice of basis {{math|'''f'''}}, does not actually depend on {{math|'''f'''}} in an essential way. Indeed, changing basis to {{math|'''f'''''A''}} gives

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
      &amp;\alpha[\mathbf{f}A] G[\mathbf{f}A]^{-1} \beta[\mathbf{f}A]^\mathsf{T} \\
  ={} &amp;\left(\alpha[\mathbf{f}]A\right) \left(A^{-1}G[\mathbf{f}]^{-1} \left(A^{-1}\right)^\mathsf{T}\right) \left(A^\mathsf{T}\beta[\mathbf{f}]^\mathsf{T}\right) \\
  ={} &amp;\alpha[\mathbf{f}] G[\mathbf{f}]^{-1} \beta[\mathbf{f}]^\mathsf{T}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

So that the right-hand side of equation ({{EquationNote|6}}) is unaffected by changing the basis {{math|'''f'''}} to any other basis {{math|'''f'''''A''}} whatsoever. Consequently, the equation may be assigned a meaning independently of the choice of basis. The entries of the matrix {{math|''G''['''f''']}} are denoted by {{math|''g''&lt;sup&gt;''ij''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, where the indices {{mvar|i}} and {{mvar|j}} have been raised to indicate the transformation law ({{EquationNote|5}}).

===Raising and lowering indices===
{{See also|Raising and lowering indices}}
In a basis of vector fields {{math|'''f''' {{=}} (''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, any smooth tangent vector field {{mvar|X}} can be written in the form

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;X =
  v^1[\mathbf{f}]X_1 + v^2 [\mathbf{f}]X_2 + \dots + v^n[\mathbf{f}]X_n =
  \mathbf{f} \begin{bmatrix}v^1[\mathbf{f}] \\ v^2[\mathbf{f}] \\ \vdots \\ v^n[\mathbf{f}]\end{bmatrix} =
  \mathbf{f} v[\mathbf{f}]
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|7}}}}

for some uniquely determined smooth functions {{math|''v''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ..., ''v''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Upon changing the basis {{math|'''f'''}} by a nonsingular matrix {{mvar|A}}, the coefficients {{math|''v''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;}} change in such a way that equation ({{EquationNote|7}}) remains true. That is,

:&lt;math&gt;X = \mathbf{fA}v[\mathbf{fA}] = \mathbf{f}v[\mathbf{f}]\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Consequently, {{math|''v''['''f'''''A''] {{=}} ''A''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''v''['''f''']}}. In other words, the components of a vector transform ''contravariantly'' (with respect to the inverse) under a change of basis by the nonsingular matrix {{mvar|A}}. The contravariance of the components of {{math|''v''['''f''']}} is notationally designated by placing the indices of {{math|''v''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;['''f''']}} in the upper position.

A frame also allows covectors to be expressed in terms of their components. For the basis of vector fields {{math|'''f''' {{=}} (''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} define the [[dual basis]] to be the [[linear functional]]s {{math|(''θ''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;['''f'''], ..., ''θ''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;['''f'''])}} such that

:&lt;math&gt;\theta^i[\mathbf{f}](X_j) = \begin{cases} 1 &amp; \mathrm{if}\ i=j\\ 0&amp;\mathrm{if}\ i\not=j.\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

That is, {{math|''θ''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;['''f'''](''X''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;) {{=}} ''δ''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, the [[Kronecker delta]]. Let

:&lt;math&gt;\theta[\mathbf{f}] = \begin{bmatrix}\theta^1[\mathbf{f}] \\ \theta^2[\mathbf{f}] \\ \vdots \\ \theta^n[\mathbf{f}]\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

Under a change of basis {{math|'''f''' ↦ '''f'''''A''}} for a nonsingular matrix {{math|''A''}}, {{math|''θ''['''f''']}} transforms via

:&lt;math&gt;\theta[\mathbf{f}A] = A^{-1}\theta[\mathbf{f}].&lt;/math&gt;

Any linear functional {{mvar|α}} on tangent vectors can be expanded in terms of the dual basis {{mvar|θ}}

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \alpha &amp;= a_1[\mathbf{f}] \theta^1[\mathbf{f}] + a_2[\mathbf{f}] \theta^2[\mathbf{f}] + \cdots + a_n[\mathbf{f}] \theta^n[\mathbf{f}] \\[8pt]
         &amp;= \big\lbrack\begin{array}{cccc}a_1[\mathbf{f}] &amp; a_2[\mathbf{f}] &amp; \dots &amp; a_n[\mathbf{f}]\end{array}\big\rbrack \theta[\mathbf{f}] \\[8pt]
         &amp;= a[\mathbf{f}] \theta[\mathbf{f}]
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|8}}}}

where {{math|''a''['''f''']}} denotes the [[row vector]] {{math|[ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;['''f'''] ... ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;['''f'''] ]}}. The components {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} transform when the basis {{math|'''f'''}} is replaced by {{math|'''f'''''A''}} in such a way that equation ({{EquationNote|8}}) continues to hold. That is,

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = a[\mathbf{f}A]\theta[\mathbf{f}A] = a[\mathbf{f}]\theta[\mathbf{f}]&lt;/math&gt;

whence, because {{math|''θ''['''f'''''A''] {{=}} ''A''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''θ''['''f''']}}, it follows that {{math|1=''a''['''f'''''A''] {{=}} ''a''['''f''']''A''}}. That is, the components {{mvar|a}} transform ''covariantly'' (by the matrix {{mvar|A}} rather than its inverse). The covariance of the components of {{math|''a''['''f''']}} is notationally designated by placing the indices of {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;['''f''']}} in the lower position.

Now, the metric tensor gives a means to identify vectors and covectors as follows. Holding {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} fixed, the function

:&lt;math&gt;g_p(X_p, -) : Y_p \mapsto g_p(X_p, Y_p)&lt;/math&gt;

of tangent vector {{math|''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} defines a [[linear functional]] on the tangent space at {{mvar|p}}. This operation takes a vector {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} at a point {{mvar|p}} and produces a covector {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;, −)}}. In a basis of vector fields {{math|'''f'''}}, if a vector field {{mvar|X}} has components {{math|''v''['''f''']}}, then the components of the covector field {{math|''g''(''X'', −)}} in the dual basis are given by the entries of the row vector
:&lt;math&gt;a[\mathbf{f}] = v[\mathbf{f}]^\mathsf{T} G[\mathbf{f}].&lt;/math&gt;

Under a change of basis {{math|'''f''' ↦ '''f'''''A''}}, the right-hand side of this equation transforms via
:&lt;math&gt;
  v[\mathbf{f}A]^\mathsf{T} G[\mathbf{f}A] =
    v[\mathbf{f}]^\mathsf{T} \left(A^{-1}\right)^\mathsf{T} A^\mathsf{T} G[\mathbf{f}]A =
    v[\mathbf{f}]^\mathsf{T} G[\mathbf{f}]A
&lt;/math&gt;

so that {{math|''a''['''f'''''A''] {{=}} ''a''['''f''']''A''}}: {{mvar|a}} transforms covariantly. The operation of associating to the (contravariant) components of a vector field {{math|''v''['''f'''] {{=}} [ ''v''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;['''f'''] ''v''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;['''f'''] ... ''v''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;['''f'''] ]}}&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; the (covariant) components of the covector field {{math|''a''['''f'''] {{=}} [ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;['''f'''] ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;['''f'''] … ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;['''f'''] ]}}, where
:&lt;math&gt;a_i[\mathbf{f}] = \sum_{k=1}^n v^k[\mathbf{f}]g_{ki}[\mathbf{f}]&lt;/math&gt;

is called '''lowering the index'''.

To ''raise the index'', one applies the same construction but with the inverse metric instead of the metric. If {{math|''a''['''f'''] {{=}} [ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;['''f'''] ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;['''f'''] ... ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;['''f'''] ]}} are the components of a covector in the dual basis {{math|''θ''['''f''']}}, then the column vector
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;v[\mathbf{f}] = G^{-1}[\mathbf{f}]a[\mathbf{f}]^\mathsf{T}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|9}}}}
has components which transform contravariantly:
:&lt;math&gt;v[\mathbf{f}A] = A^{-1}v[\mathbf{f}].&lt;/math&gt;

Consequently, the quantity {{math|''X'' {{=}} '''f'''''v''['''f''']}} does not depend on the choice of basis {{math|'''f'''}} in an essential way, and thus defines a vector field on {{mvar|M}}. The operation ({{EquationNote|9}}) associating to the (covariant) components of a covector {{math|''a''['''f''']}} the (contravariant) components of a vector {{math|''v''['''f''']}} given is called '''raising the index'''. In components, ({{EquationNote|9}}) is
:&lt;math&gt;v^i[\mathbf{f}] = \sum_{k=1}^n g^{ik}[\mathbf{f}] a_k[\mathbf{f}].&lt;/math&gt;

===Induced metric===
&lt;!--{{main|Induced metric}} Not currently well-written. --&gt;
Let {{mvar|U}} be an [[open set]] in {{math|'''ℝ'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and let {{mvar|φ}} be a [[continuously differentiable]] function from {{mvar|U}} into the [[Euclidean space]] {{math|'''ℝ'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, where {{math|''m'' &gt; ''n''}}. The mapping {{mvar|φ}} is called an [[immersion (mathematics)|immersion]] if its differential is [[injective]] at every point of {{mvar|U}}. The image of {{mvar|φ}} is called an [[immersed submanifold]].

Suppose that {{mvar|φ}} is an immersion onto the submanifold {{math|''M'' ⊂ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The usual Euclidean [[dot product]] in {{math|'''ℝ'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is a metric which, when restricted to vectors tangent to {{mvar|M}}, gives a means for taking the dot product of these tangent vectors. This is called the '''induced metric'''.

Suppose that {{mvar|v}} is a tangent vector at a point of {{mvar|U}}, say
:&lt;math&gt;v = v^1\mathbf{e}_1 + \dots + v^n\mathbf{e}_n&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the standard coordinate vectors in {{math|'''ℝ'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. When {{mvar|φ}} is applied to {{mvar|U}}, the vector {{mvar|v}} goes over to the vector tangent to {{mvar|M}} given by
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi_*(v) = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{a=1}^m v^i\frac{\partial \varphi^a}{\partial x^i}\mathbf{e}_a\,.&lt;/math&gt;

(This is called the [[pushforward (differential)|pushforward]] of {{mvar|v}} along {{mvar|φ}}.) Given two such vectors, {{mvar|v}} and {{mvar|w}}, the induced metric is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;g(v,w) = \varphi_*(v)\cdot \varphi_*(w).&lt;/math&gt;

It follows from a straightforward calculation that the matrix of the induced metric in the basis of coordinate vector fields {{math|'''e'''}} is given by
:&lt;math&gt;G(\mathbf{e}) = (D\varphi)^\mathsf{T}(D\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|Dφ}} is the Jacobian matrix:
:&lt;math&gt;D\varphi = \begin{bmatrix}
  \frac{\partial\varphi^1}{\partial x^1} &amp; \frac{\partial\varphi^1}{\partial x^2} &amp;
    \dots  &amp; \frac{\partial\varphi^1}{\partial x^n} \\[1ex]
  \frac{\partial\varphi^2}{\partial x^1} &amp; \frac{\partial\varphi^2}{\partial x^2} &amp;
    \dots  &amp; \frac{\partial\varphi^2}{\partial x^n} \\
  \vdots                                 &amp; \vdots                                 &amp;
    \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
  \frac{\partial\varphi^m}{\partial x^1} &amp; \frac{\partial\varphi^m}{\partial x^2} &amp;
    \dots  &amp; \frac{\partial\varphi^m}{\partial x^n}
\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Intrinsic definitions of a metric==
The notion of a metric can be defined intrinsically using the language of [[fiber bundle]]s and [[vector bundle]]s. In these terms, a '''metric tensor''' is a function

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;g : \mathrm{T}M\times_M \mathrm{T}M\to \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|10}}}}

from the [[fiber product]] of the [[tangent bundle]] of {{mvar|M}} with itself to {{math|'''R'''}} such that the restriction of {{mvar|g}} to each fiber is a nondegenerate bilinear mapping

:&lt;math&gt;g_p : \mathrm{T}_pM\times \mathrm{T}_pM \to \mathbf{R}.&lt;/math&gt;

The mapping ({{EquationNote|10}}) is required to be [[continuous function|continuous]], and often [[continuously differentiable]], [[smooth function|smooth]], or [[real analytic]], depending on the case of interest, and whether {{mvar|M}} can support such a structure.

===Metric as a section of a bundle===
By the [[Tensor product#Universal property|universal property of the tensor product]], any bilinear mapping ({{EquationNote|10}}) gives rise [[natural transformation|naturally]] to a [[section (fiber bundle)|section]] {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;⊗&lt;/sub&gt;}} of the [[dual space|dual]] of the [[tensor product bundle]] of {{math|T''M''}} with itself

:&lt;math&gt;g_\otimes \in \Gamma\left((\mathrm{T}M \otimes \mathrm{T}M)^*\right).&lt;/math&gt;

The section {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;⊗&lt;/sub&gt;}} is defined on simple elements of {{math|T''M'' ⊗ T''M''}} by

:&lt;math&gt;g_\otimes(v \otimes w) = g(v, w)&lt;/math&gt;

and is defined on arbitrary elements of {{math|T''M'' ⊗ T''M''}} by extending linearly to linear combinations of simple elements. The original bilinear form {{mvar|g}} is symmetric if and only if
:&lt;math&gt;g_\otimes \circ \tau = g_\otimes&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\tau : \mathrm{T}M \otimes \mathrm{T}M \stackrel{\cong}{\to} TM \otimes TM&lt;/math&gt;
is the [[tensor product#Tensor powers and braiding|braiding map]].

Since {{mvar|M}} is finite-dimensional, there is a [[natural isomorphism]]

:&lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{T}M \otimes \mathrm{T}M)^* \cong \mathrm{T}^*M \otimes \mathrm{T}^*M,&lt;/math&gt;

so that {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;⊗&lt;/sub&gt;}} is regarded also as a section of the bundle {{math|T*''M'' ⊗ T*''M''}} of the [[cotangent bundle]] {{math|T*''M''}} with itself. Since {{mvar|g}} is symmetric as a bilinear mapping, it follows that {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;⊗&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a [[symmetric tensor]].

===Metric in a vector bundle===
More generally, one may speak of a metric in a [[vector bundle]]. If {{mvar|E}} is a vector bundle over a manifold {{mvar|M}}, then a metric is a mapping

:&lt;math&gt;g : E\times_M E\to \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt;

from the [[fiber product]] of {{mvar|E}} to {{math|'''R'''}} which is bilinear in each fiber:

:&lt;math&gt;g_p : E_p \times E_p\to \mathbf{R}.&lt;/math&gt;

Using duality as above, a metric is often identified with a [[section (fiber bundle)|section]] of the [[tensor product]] bundle {{math|''E''* ⊗ ''E''*}}. (See [[metric (vector bundle)]].)

===Tangent–cotangent isomorphism===
{{see also|Musical isomorphism}}
The metric tensor gives a [[natural isomorphism]] from the [[tangent bundle]] to the [[cotangent bundle]], sometimes called the [[musical isomorphism]].&lt;ref&gt;For the terminology "musical isomorphism", see {{harvtxt|Gallot|Hulin|Lafontaine|2004|p=75}}. See also {{harvtxt|Lee|1997|pp=27–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This isomorphism is obtained by setting, for each tangent vector {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ T&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''}},

:&lt;math&gt;S_gX_p\, \stackrel\text{def}{=}\, g(X_p, -),&lt;/math&gt;

the [[linear functional]] on {{math|T&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''}} which sends a tangent vector {{math|''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} at {{mvar|p}} to {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;,''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}. That is, in terms of the pairing {{math|[−, −]}} between {{math|T&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''}} and its [[dual space]] {{math|T{{su|b=''p''|p=∗}}''M''}},

:&lt;math&gt;[S_gX_p, Y_p] = g_p(X_p, Y_p)&lt;/math&gt;

for all tangent vectors {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. The mapping {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a [[linear transformation]] from {{math|T&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''}} to {{math|T{{su|b=''p''|p=∗}}''M''}}. It follows from the definition of non-degeneracy that the [[kernel (set theory)|kernel]] of {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is reduced to zero, and so by the [[rank–nullity theorem]], {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a [[linear isomorphism]]. Furthermore, {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a [[symmetric linear transformation]] in the sense that

:&lt;math&gt;[S_gX_p, Y_p] = [S_gY_p, X_p] &lt;/math&gt;

for all tangent vectors {{math|''X''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

Conversely, any linear isomorphism {{math|''S'' : T&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''M'' → T{{su|b=''p''|p=∗}}''M''}} defines a non-degenerate bilinear form on {{math|T&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''}} by means of

:&lt;math&gt;g_S(X_p, Y_p) = [SX_p, Y_p]\,.&lt;/math&gt;

This bilinear form is symmetric if and only if {{mvar|S}} is symmetric. There is thus a natural one-to-one correspondence between symmetric bilinear forms on {{math|T&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''}} and symmetric linear isomorphisms of {{math|T&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''}} to the dual {{math|T{{su|b=''p''|p=∗}}''M''}}.

As {{mvar|p}} varies over {{mvar|M}}, {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt;}} defines a section of the bundle {{math|Hom(T''M'', T*''M'')}} of [[vector bundle morphism|vector bundle isomorphisms]] of the tangent bundle to the cotangent bundle. This section has the same smoothness as {{mvar|g}}: it is continuous, differentiable, smooth, or real-analytic according as {{mvar|g}}. The mapping {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, which associates to every vector field on {{mvar|M}} a covector field on {{mvar|M}} gives an abstract formulation of "lowering the index" on a vector field. The inverse of {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a mapping {{math|T*''M'' → T''M''}} which, analogously, gives an abstract formulation of "raising the index" on a covector field.

The inverse {{math|''S''{{su|b=''g''|p=−1}}}} defines a linear mapping
:&lt;math&gt;S_g^{-1} : \mathrm{T}^*M \to \mathrm{T}M&lt;/math&gt;

which is nonsingular and symmetric in the sense that
:&lt;math&gt;\left[S_g^{-1}\alpha, \beta\right] = \left[S_g^{-1}\beta, \alpha\right]&lt;/math&gt;

for all covectors {{mvar|α}}, {{mvar|β}}. Such a nonsingular symmetric mapping gives rise (by the [[tensor-hom adjunction]]) to a map
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{T}^*M \otimes \mathrm{T}^*M \to \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt;

or by the [[Double dual|double dual isomorphism]] to a section of the tensor product
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{T}M \otimes \mathrm{T}M.&lt;/math&gt;

==Arclength and the line element==
Suppose that {{mvar|g}} is a Riemannian metric on {{mvar|M}}. In a local coordinate system {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, {{math|''i'' {{=}} 1, 2, …, ''n''}}, the metric tensor appears as a [[matrix (math)|matrix]], denoted here by {{math|'''G'''}}, whose entries are the components {{math|''g''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;}} of the metric tensor relative to the coordinate vector fields.

Let {{math|''γ''(''t'')}} be a piecewise-differentiable [[parametric curve]] in {{mvar|M}}, for {{math|''a'' ≤ ''t'' ≤ ''b''}}. The [[arclength]] of the curve is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;L = \int_a^b \sqrt{ \sum_{i,j=1}^n g_{ij}(\gamma(t)) \left(\frac{d}{dt}x^i \circ \gamma(t)\right) \left(\frac{d}{dt} x^j \circ \gamma(t)\right)}\,dt \,.&lt;/math&gt;

In connection with this geometrical application, the [[quadratic form|quadratic]] [[differential form]]

:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = \sum_{i,j=1}^n g_{ij}(p) dx^i dx^j&lt;/math&gt;

is called the [[first fundamental form]] associated to the metric, while {{mvar|ds}} is the [[line element]]. When {{math|''ds''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} is [[pullback (differential geometry)|pulled back]] to the image of a curve in {{mvar|M}}, it represents the square of the differential with respect to arclength.

For a pseudo-Riemannian metric, the length formula above is not always defined, because the term under the square root may become negative. We generally only define the length of a curve when the quantity under the square root is always of one sign or the other. In this case, define

:&lt;math&gt;L = \int_a^b \sqrt{ \left|\sum_{i,j=1}^ng_{ij}(\gamma(t)) \left(\frac{d}{dt}x^i \circ \gamma(t)\right)\left(\frac{d}{dt}x^j \circ \gamma(t)\right)\right|}\,dt \, .&lt;/math&gt;

Note that, while these formulas use coordinate expressions, they are in fact independent of the coordinates chosen; they depend only on the metric, and the curve along which the formula is integrated.

===The energy, variational principles and geodesics===
Given a segment of a curve, another frequently defined quantity is the (kinetic) '''energy''' of the curve:

:&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{1}{2} \int_a^b \sum_{i,j=1}^ng_{ij}(\gamma(t)) \left(\frac{d}{dt}x^i \circ \gamma(t)\right)\left(\frac{d}{dt}x^j \circ \gamma(t)\right)\,dt \,. &lt;/math&gt;

This usage comes from [[physics]], specifically, [[classical mechanics]], where the integral {{mvar|E}} can be seen to directly correspond to the [[kinetic energy]] of a point particle moving on the surface of a manifold. Thus, for example, in Jacobi's formulation of [[Maupertuis' principle]], the metric tensor can be seen to correspond to the mass tensor of a moving particle.

In many cases, whenever a calculation calls for the length to be used, a similar calculation using the energy may be done as well. This often leads to simpler formulas by avoiding the need for the square-root. Thus, for example, the [[geodesic equation]]s may be obtained by applying [[variational principle]]s to either the length or the energy. In the latter case, the geodesic equations are seen to arise from the [[principle of least action]]: they describe the motion of a "free particle" (a particle feeling no forces) that is confined to move on the manifold, but otherwise moves freely, with constant momentum, within the manifold.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sternberg|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canonical measure and volume form==
In analogy with the case of surfaces, a metric tensor on an {{mvar|n}}-dimensional paracompact manifold {{mvar|M}} gives rise to a natural way to measure the {{mvar|n}}-dimensional [[volume]] of subsets of the manifold. The resulting natural positive [[Borel measure]] allows one to develop a theory of integrating functions on the manifold by means of the associated [[Lebesgue integral]].

A measure can be defined, by the [[Riesz representation theorem]], by giving a positive [[linear functional]] {{mvar|Λ}} on the space {{math|''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''M'')}} of [[compact support|compactly supported]] [[continuous function]]s on {{mvar|M}}. More precisely, if {{mvar|M}} is a manifold with a (pseudo-)Riemannian metric tensor {{mvar|g}}, then there is a unique positive [[Borel measure]] {{math|''μ''&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt;}} such that for any [[coordinate chart]] {{math|(''U'', ''φ'')}},
:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda f = \int_U f\,d\mu_g = \int_{\varphi(U)} f\circ\varphi^{-1}(x) \sqrt{|\det g|}\,dx&lt;/math&gt;
for all {{mvar|f}} supported in {{mvar|U}}. Here {{math|det ''g''}} is the [[determinant]] of the matrix formed by the components of the metric tensor in the coordinate chart. That {{mvar|Λ}} is well-defined on functions supported in coordinate neighborhoods is justified by [[integration by substitution|Jacobian change of variables]]. It extends to a unique positive linear functional on {{math|''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''M'')}} by means of a [[partition of unity]].

If {{mvar|M}} is in addition [[orientation (mathematics)|oriented]], then it is possible to define a natural [[volume form]] from the metric tensor. In a [[right-handed coordinate system|positively oriented coordinate system]] {{math|(''x''&lt;sup&gt;''1''&lt;/sup&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;)}} the volume form is represented as
:&lt;math&gt;\omega = \sqrt{|\det g|}\, dx^1\wedge\cdots\wedge dx^n&lt;/math&gt;
where the {{math|''dx''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;}} are the [[coordinate differential]]s and {{math|∧}} denotes the [[exterior product]] in the algebra of [[differential form]]s. The volume form also gives a way to integrate functions on the manifold, and this geometric integral agrees with the integral obtained by the canonical Borel measure.

==Examples==

===Euclidean metric===
The most familiar example is that of elementary [[Euclidean geometry]]: the two-dimensional [[Euclidean distance|Euclidean]] metric tensor. In the usual {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} coordinates, we can write

:&lt;math&gt;g = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1\end{bmatrix} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

The length of a curve reduces to the formula:

:&lt;math&gt;L = \int_a^b \sqrt{ (dx)^2 + (dy)^2} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

The Euclidean metric in some other common coordinate systems can be written as follows.

[[Polar coordinates]] {{math|(''r'', ''θ'')}}:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  x &amp;= r \cos\theta \\
  y &amp;= r \sin\theta \\
  J &amp;= \begin{bmatrix}\cos\theta &amp; -r\sin\theta \\ \sin\theta &amp; r\cos\theta\end{bmatrix} \,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

So
:&lt;math&gt;g = J^\mathsf{T}J =
  \begin{bmatrix}
      \cos^2\theta + \sin^2\theta                  &amp; -r\sin\theta \cos\theta + r\sin\theta\cos\theta \\
    -r\cos\theta\sin\theta + r\cos\theta\sin\theta &amp; r^2 \sin^2\theta + r^2\cos^2\theta
  \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
    1 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; r^2
  \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
by [[trigonometric identity|trigonometric identities]].

In general, in a [[Cartesian coordinate system]] {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;}} on a [[Euclidean space]], the partial derivatives {{math|∂ / ∂''x&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;''}} are [[orthonormal]] with respect to the Euclidean metric. Thus the metric tensor is the [[Kronecker delta]] δ&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; in this coordinate system. The metric tensor with respect to arbitrary (possibly curvilinear) coordinates {{math|''q&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;''}} is given by
:&lt;math&gt;g_{ij} =
  \sum_{kl}\delta_{kl}\frac{\partial x^k}{\partial q^i} \frac{\partial x^l}{\partial q^j} =
  \sum_k\frac{\partial x^k}{\partial q^i}\frac{\partial x^k}{\partial q^j}.
&lt;/math&gt;

====The round metric on a sphere====
The unit sphere in {{math|'''ℝ'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} comes equipped with a natural metric induced from the ambient Euclidean metric. In standard spherical coordinates {{math|(''θ'', ''φ'')}}, with {{math|''θ''}} the [[colatitude]], the angle measured from the {{mvar|z}}-axis, and {{mvar|φ}} the angle from the {{mvar|x}}-axis in the {{mvar|xy}}-plane, the metric takes the form

:&lt;math&gt;g = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; \sin^2 \theta\end{bmatrix} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

This is usually written in the form

:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta\,d\varphi^2\,.&lt;/math&gt;

===Lorentzian metrics from relativity===
{{main|Metric tensor (general relativity)}}
In flat [[Minkowski space]] ([[special relativity]]), with coordinates
:&lt;math&gt;r^\mu \rightarrow \left(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3\right) = (ct, x, y, z) \, ,&lt;/math&gt;

the metric is, depending on choice of [[metric signature]],
:&lt;math&gt;g = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 \end{bmatrix} \quad \text{or} \quad g = \begin{bmatrix} -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

For a curve with—for example—constant time coordinate, the length formula with this metric reduces to the usual length formula. For a [[Spacetime interval|timelike]] curve, the length formula gives the [[proper time]] along the curve.

In this case, the [[spacetime interval]] is written as
:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = c^2 dt^2 - dx^2 - dy^2 - dz^2 = dr^\mu dr_\mu = g_{\mu \nu} dr^\mu dr^\nu\,. &lt;/math&gt;

The [[Schwarzschild metric]] describes the spacetime around a spherically symmetric body, such as a planet, or a [[black hole]]. With coordinates
:&lt;math&gt;\left(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3\right) = (ct, r, \theta, \varphi) \,,&lt;/math&gt;

we can write the metric as
:&lt;math&gt;g_{\mu\nu} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \left(1 - \frac{2GM}{rc^2}\right) &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; -\left(1 - \frac{2GM}{r c^2}\right)^{-1} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; -r^2 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -r^2 \sin^2 \theta
  \end{bmatrix}\,,
&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|G}} (inside the matrix) is the [[gravitational constant]] and {{mvar|M}} represents the total [[mass-energy]] content of the central object.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1126">A '''morphogram''' is the representation of a [[morpheme]] by a [[grapheme]] based solely on its meaning. [[Kanji]] and [[hanja]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} are two writing systems that make use of '''morphograms''', where Chinese characters were borrowed to represent native morphemes because of their meanings. Thus, a single character can represent a variety of morphemes which originally all had the same meaning. An example of this in Japanese would be the grapheme 東 [east], which can be read as ''higashi'' or ''azuma'', in addition to its [[logographic]] representation of the morpheme ''tō''. Additionally, in Japanese, the logographic (Chinese-derived) reading is called the ''on'', and the morphographic reading (native Japanese) is called the ''kun''.

'''Moshé Pinchas Feldenkrais''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: משה פנחס פלדנקרייז, May 6, 1904 – July 1, 1984) was an [[Israel]]i engineer and physicist and the founder of the [[Feldenkrais Method]],which is claimed to improve human functioning by increasing self-awareness through movement; it is not supported by medical evidence.&lt;ref name=aus17/&gt;

Feldenkrais' theory is that "thought, feeling, perception and movement are closely interrelated and influence each other."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helsana.ch/en/individuals/all-about-health/relaxation/the-feldenkrais-method All About Health: The Feldenkrais Method] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126004300/http://www.helsana.ch/en/individuals/all-about-health/relaxation/the-feldenkrais-method |date=2016-01-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
He was born in the [[Russian Empire]] city of [[Slavuta]] (now in [[Ukraine]]) and grew up in [[Baranovichi]], [[Belarus]]. In 1918, he [[aliyah|immigrated]] to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].&lt;ref name="Who Was Moshe Feldenkrais"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feldenkrais.com/method/frequently_asked_questions/#9|title=Who Was Moshe Feldenkrais?|publisher=Feldenkrais Guild of North America|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080831152550/https://feldenkrais.com/method/frequently_asked_questions/|archivedate=31 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked as a laborer and obtained his high school diploma from [[Gymnasia Herzliya]] in 1925.&lt;ref name="haaretz.com"&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/ben-gurion-s-personal-trainer-1.124885 Ben Gurion's Personal Trainer, [[Haaretz]]]&lt;/ref&gt;  After graduation, he worked as a [[cartography|cartographer]] for the British survey office and began to study self-defense, including [[Ju-Jitsu]]. A soccer injury in 1929 promoted the development of his method in later years.&lt;ref name="who"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feldenkraislearning.com/html/about_moshe.html|title=About Moshe|author=Reese, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1930s, he lived in [[France]], where he earned his engineering degree from the [[École Spéciale des Travaux Publics]] and, later, his [[Doctor of Science]] in [[Physics]] at the [[University of Paris]], where [[Marie Curie]] was one of his teachers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/features/.premium-1.663700 The Father of Feldenkrais Dies, [[Haaretz]]]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.normandoidge.com/?page_id=1042 The Brain's Way of Healing&lt;/ref&gt;

He worked as a research assistant to nuclear chemist and [[Nobel Prize]] laureate [[Frédéric Joliot-Curie]] at the [[Curie Institute (Paris)|Radium Institute]]. In September 1933, he met [[Jigoro Kano]], the founder of [[judo]] in Paris. Kano encouraged him to study Judo under [[Mikinosuke Kawaishi]]. Feldenkrais became a close friend of Kano and corresponded with him regularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buckard|first1=Christian|title=Moshé Feldenkrais: Der Mensch hinter der Methode|date=2015|publisher=Berlin Verlag|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-8270-1238-8|pages=107–116}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, he earned a [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] in judo, and later gained his 2nd degree black belt in 1938. He was a co-founding member of the [[List of judo organizations#France|Ju-Jitsu Club de France]], one of the oldest Judo clubs in Europe, which still exists today.  Frédéric and [[Irène Joliot-Curie]] and Bertrand Goldschmidt took Judo lessons from him during their time together at the institute.

On the eve of the Nazi invasion of France in 1940, Feldenkrais fled to Britain with a jar of [[heavy water]] and a sheaf of research material, with instructions to deliver them to the British Admiralty [[War Office]]. Until 1946, he was a science officer in the [[Admiralty]] working on [[anti-submarine weapon]]ry in [[Fairlie, Scotland#MOD base and other facilities|Fairlie, Scotland]].  His work on improving [[sonar]] led to several patents. He also taught self-defense techniques to his fellow servicemen.  On slippery submarine decks, he re-aggravated an old soccer knee injury. Refusing an operation, he was prompted to intently explore and develop self-rehabilitation and awareness techniques by self-observation that later evolved into the method.&lt;ref name="haaretz.com"/&gt;  His discoveries led him to begin sharing with others (including colleague [[J. D. Bernal]]) through lectures, experimental classes, and one-on-one work with a few.

After leaving the Admiralty, he lived and worked in private industry in London. His self-rehabilitation enabled him to continue his judo practice. From his position on the International Judo Committee, he began to study judo scientifically, incorporating the knowledge that he had gained by self-rehabilitation. In 1949, he published the first book on his method, ''Body and Mature Behavior: A Study of Anxiety, Sex, Gravitation and Learning''. He studied the work of [[Gurdjieff]], [[F. Matthias Alexander]], [[Elsa Gindler]] and [[William Bates (physician)|William Bates]]. He also traveled to Switzerland to study with [[Heinrich Jacoby]].

In 1951, he returned to [[Israel]]. In 1954, after directing the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] Department of Electronics for several years, he settled in [[Tel Aviv]] and began to teach his method full-time.&lt;ref name="Berlin Verlag"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buckard|first1=Christian|title=Moshé Feldenkrais: Der Mensch hinter der Methode|date=2015|publisher=Berlin Verlag|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-8270-1238-8|pages=240–241}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="derstandard.at"&gt;Priesching, Doris. (June 6, 2010). [http://derstandard.at/1271378154314/Interview-Alles-kann-ein-bisschen-besser-werden "Alles Kann Ein Bisschen Besser Werden."]. ''Der Standard.''&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1957, he met Mia Segal, who became his assistant and worked with him for thirty years.&lt;ref name="haaretz.com"/&gt; He also became the personal trainer of  [[David Ben-Gurion]], the [[Prime Minister of Israel]], whom he taught to stand on his head in a yoga pose.&lt;ref name="Berlin Verlag"/&gt;&lt;ref name="derstandard.at"/&gt;

Throughout the 1960s, 1970s, and the 1980, he presented his method in [[Europe]] and in [[North America]] (including an Awareness Through Movement program for human potential trainers at [[Esalen Institute]] in 1972). He trained the first group of 13 teachers in the method from 1969 to 1971 in Tel Aviv. Over the course of four summers, from 1975 to 1978, he trained 65 teachers in [[San Francisco]] at [[Lone Mountain College]] under the auspices of the [[Saybrook Graduate School and Research Center|Humanistic Psychology Institute]]. In 1980, 235 students began his summer teacher-training course at [[Hampshire College]] in [[Amherst, Massachusetts]].

{{main|Feldenkrais method}}

The Feldenkrais is intended to teach better posture and improve quality of life, by means of instruction and gentle manipulation of the body.&lt;ref name=aus17/&gt;

In 2015 the Australian Government's Department of Health published the results of a review of alternative therapies that sought to determine if any were suitable for being covered by health insurance; the Feldenkrais Method was one of 17 therapies evaluated for which no clear evidence of effectiveness was found. The report notes that there is "a paucity of evidence regarding the effectiveness of Feldenkrais for the improvement of health outcomes for any clinical condition".&lt;ref name=aus17&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/0E9129B3574FCA53CA257BF0001ACD11/$File/Natural%20Therapies%20Overview%20Report%20Final%20with%20copyright%2011%20March.pdf |publisher=Australian Government &amp;ndash; Department of Health |format=PDF |author=Baggoley C |title=Review of the Australian Government Rebate on Natural Therapies for Private Health Insurance |year=2015 |laysummary=https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/australian-review-finds-no-benefit-to-17-natural-therapies |lay-source=Gavura, S.

[[File:Dwayne Jones in Car.jpg|thumb|Dwayne Jones sitting in a car's driver seat]]
'''Dwayne Jones''' was a Jamaican 16-year-old who was killed by a [[mobbing|violent mob]] in [[Montego Bay]] in 2013, after he attended a dance party dressed in women's clothing.{{efn|While some media commentators describe Jones as [[transgender]],&lt;ref name="PinkNewsVigil"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McFadden"/&gt; his best friend described him using male pronouns,&lt;ref name="McFadden"/&gt; and so other sources refer to him as a [[cross-dressing|cross-dresser]]&lt;ref name="Gleaner28"/&gt; or [[gender variance|gender non-conforming]].&lt;ref name="J-FLAG"/&gt;}} The incident attracted national and international media attention and brought increased scrutiny to the status of [[LGBT rights in Jamaica]].

Perceived as [[effeminancy|effeminate]], Jones was [[bullying|bullied]] in school and, at the age of 14, was forced out of his family home by his father. He moved into a derelict house in Montego Bay with [[transgender]] friends. On the evening of 21 July 2013, they went to the [[Irwin, Jamaica|Irwin]] area of the city and attended a dance party. When some men at the party discovered that the [[cross-dressing]] Jones was not a woman, they confronted and attacked him. Jones was beaten, stabbed, shot, and run over with a car; he died in the early hours of the morning. Police investigated the murder but did not arrest or charge anyone for the crime, which remains unsolved.

The event made newspaper headlines in Jamaica and was also the subject of reporting in both the United Kingdom and the United States. While voices on social media accused Jones of provoking his killers by cross-dressing in public, the murder was condemned by Jamaican educators and the country's [[Cabinet of Jamaica|Justice Minister]]. In the wake of the attack, both domestic and international organisations devoted to [[LGBT rights by country|LGBT rights]] and [[human rights]] – among them [[Human Rights Watch]], [[Jamaicans for Justice]], and the [[J-FLAG|Jamaica Forum for Lesbians, All-Sexuals &amp; Gays]] – asked the Jamaican authorities for a proper investigation and legal recognition of LGBT rights on the island.

Raised in an impoverished slum in [[Montego Bay]], a city in northwest Jamaica, Jones faced bullying at high school from students who perceived his behaviour as [[effeminacy|effeminate]].&lt;ref name="McFadden"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/jamaica-transgender-teen-murdered-mob|title=In Jamaica, transgender teen killed by mob|work=[[Associated Press]]|author=McFadden, David|accessdate=14 August 2013|date=11 August 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103213141/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/jamaica-transgender-teen-murdered-mob|archivedate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wills"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.webpronews.com/transgender-teen-dwayne-jones-murdered-by-mob-2013-08|title=Transgender Teen Dwayne Jones Murdered by Mob|publisher=Web Pro News|author=Wills, Courtney|accessdate=14 August 2013|date=11 August 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6MLxS4Ckk?url=http://www.webpronews.com/transgender-teen-dwayne-jones-murdered-by-mob-2013-08|archivedate=3 January 2014|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Jones was 14, his father ejected him from the family home and encouraged neighbours to chase him out of the neighbourhood.&lt;ref name="McFadden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wills"/&gt; After a period sleeping in bushes and on beaches, he began [[squatting]] in a derelict house in the hills above Montego Bay with two transgender friends, Keke and Khloe, both 23 at the time of Jones' death.&lt;ref name="McFadden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wills"/&gt; Jones was known among friends as "Gully Queen",&lt;ref name="McFadden"/&gt; a reference to the storm drainage systems in which many homeless LGBT Jamaicans live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advocate.com/world/2014/07/31/watch-go-underground-jamaicas-gully-queens|title=WATCH: Go Underground with Jamaica's 'Gully Queens'|website=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|Advocate]]|date=31 July 2014|accessdate=5 July 2015|author=Senzee, Thom|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ZnrysiKo?url=http://www.advocate.com/world/2014/07/31/watch-go-underground-jamaicas-gully-queens|archivedate=5 July 2015|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friends noted that Jones desired to become a teacher or to work in the [[Tourism in Jamaica|tourist industry]].&lt;ref name="Quinn"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2013/08/11/homophobia_a_way_of_life_in_jamaica.html|title=Homophobia a way of life in Jamaica|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|author=Quinn, Jennifer|accessdate=14 August 2013|date=11 August 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6MLxmvhJe?url=http://www.thestar.com/news/world/2013/08/11/homophobia_a_way_of_life_in_jamaica.html|archivedate=3 January 2014|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wanted to become a performer like the American pop star [[Lady Gaga]], and had won a local dancing competition.&lt;ref name="McFadden"/&gt; Khloe described him as "a diva" who was "always very feisty and joking around".&lt;ref name="McFadden"/&gt;

===Anti-LGBT sentiment in Jamaica===
In 2006, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine said that Jamaica may be the most [[homophobia|homophobic]] country in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Padgett, Tim|title=The Most Homophobic Place on Earth?|date=12 April 2006|website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1182991,00.html|accessdate=19 October 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101043423/http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0%2C8599%2C1182991%2C00.html|archivedate=1 January 2016|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country's [[LGBT rights in Jamaica#Laws, policies, and the Jamaican constitution|laws criminalising same-sex activity]] between males were introduced in 1864, during the [[Colony of Jamaica|British colonial administration]]. According to the [[Sexual Offences Act of 2009]], any man convicted under these laws must register as a [[sex offender]].&lt;ref name="IBTimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HRWReport"/&gt; These laws have been cited as contributing to wider homophobic attitudes among the Jamaican populace,&lt;ref name="HRWReport"/&gt; including the view that gay people are criminals regardless of whether or not they have committed any criminal act.&lt;ref name="IBTimes"/&gt; Anti-LGBT perspectives have been furthered by the island's conservative Christian churches.&lt;ref name="IBTimes"/&gt; Many [[reggae]] and [[dancehall]] songs, among them [[Buju Banton]]'s "Boom Bye Bye", call for the killing of gays.&lt;ref name="IBTimes"/&gt; Writing for the ''[[International Business Times]]'' in the summer of 2013, the journalist Palash Gosh noted that while Jamaica was "awash in crime and violence, gays and lesbians are particularly prominent targets of wanton brutality."&lt;ref name="IBTimes"/&gt; In the mid-2000s, two of Jamaica's best-known LGBT rights activists, [[Brian Williamson]] and [[Lenford Harvey|Steve Harvey]], were murdered.&lt;ref name="IBTimes"/&gt; In the summer of 2013, [[Human Rights Watch]] carried out five weeks of fieldwork among Jamaica's LGBT community, reporting that over half of those interviewed had experienced violence as a result of their sexual orientation or gender identity, sometimes on more than one occasion.&lt;ref name="HRWReport"/&gt;

==Murder==
On the evening of 21 July 2013 – when Jones was 16 – he dressed in female clothing and attended a dance party with Keke and Khloe called Henessey Sundays, held at a bar in the [[Irwin, Jamaica|Irwin]] area.&lt;ref name="McFadden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wills"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IrieFM"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iriefm.net/news/headline/cross-dressing-teen-killed-mob|title=Cross dressing teen killed by mob|publisher=Irie FM|accessdate=14 August 2013|date=22 July 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6LCdlc9nP?url=http://www.iriefm.net/news/headline/cross-dressing-teen-killed-mob|archivedate=17 November 2013|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LGBTNation"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lgbtqnation.com/2013/07/cross-dressing-gay-teen-hacked-stabbed-to-death-by-jamaican-mob/|title=Cross-dressing gay teen hacked, stabbed to death by Jamaican mob|publisher=LGBTQ Nation|author=Littauer, Dan|accessdate=14 August 2013|date=23 July 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ZnsazdVb?url=http://www.lgbtqnation.com/2013/07/cross-dressing-gay-teen-hacked-stabbed-to-death-by-jamaican-mob/|archivedate=5 July 2015|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They arrived by taxi at around 2&amp;nbsp;am.&lt;ref name="Wills"/&gt; Jones [[passing (gender)|passed]] as a girl at the party, and several males danced with him.&lt;ref name="McFadden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wills"/&gt; Although he initially kept his biological sex a secret from others at the party, fearing [[homophobia|homophobic]] persecution, he revealed his identity to a girl with whom he had previously been to church.&lt;ref name="McFadden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wills"/&gt; The girl informed her male friends, who accosted him outside the venue, demanding to know, "Are you a woman or a man?"&lt;ref name="McFadden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wills"/&gt; One of the men used a lantern to examine Jones' feet, claiming that they were too large to be those of a biological woman.&lt;ref name="McFadden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wills"/&gt; Discovering his sex, they started calling him "[[batty boy]]" and other homophobic epithets.&lt;ref name="McFadden"/&gt; Khloe tried to get him to avoid confrontation, whispering in his ear, "Walk with me, walk with me", but Jones refused, instead insisting to those assembled that he was female.&lt;ref name="McFadden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wills"/&gt;

When someone pulled on Jones' bra strap, he ran away, and the crowd pursued and attacked him further down the road. He was beaten, stabbed, shot and run over by a car.

==Reaction==

===In Jamaica===
Jones' murder made headline news across Jamaica.&lt;ref name="McFadden"/&gt; Jamaica's Justice Minister, Senator [[Mark Golding]], condemned the killing and called for an end to "depraved acts of violence" in Jamaica.&lt;ref name="JamaicaObserver"/&gt; He added that "all well-thinking Jamaicans" should embrace "the principle of respect for the basic human rights of all persons" and express tolerance towards minority groups such as the LGBT community.&lt;ref name="IBTimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/boom-bye-bye-murder-cross-dresser-lifts-lid-jamaicas-violent-homophobia-1370173|title=Boom Bye Bye: Murder of Cross-Dresser Lifts Lid on Jamaica's Violent Homophobia|newspaper=[[International Business Times]]|author=Ghosh, Palash|accessdate=14 August 2013|date=2 August 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140211045826/http://www.ibtimes.com/boom-bye-bye-murder-cross-dresser-lifts-lid-jamaicas-violent-homophobia-1370173|archivedate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Annie Paul, the publications officer of the Jamaican campus of the [[University of the West Indies]] (UWI), stated that on the basis of comments provided on social media, she thought that most Jamaicans believed that Jones provoked his own murder by cross-dressing within a society that did not tolerate such behaviour.&lt;ref name="McFadden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roberts"/&gt; Newton&amp;nbsp;D. Duncan, the UWI Professor of Paediatric Surgery, similarly noted that the "overwhelming majority" of Jamaicans believed that cross-dressers are homosexuals and deserve punishment. He added that this was a common misconception, because the majority of cross-dressers were heterosexual. He condemned the attack and compared it to the [[Lynching in the United States|lynching]] of an [[African Americans|African-American]] man in [[Harper Lee]]'s novel ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'', drawing links between the anti-LGBT violence of Jamaica and the anti-black violence of the mid-20th century United States.&lt;ref name="Duncan"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20130901/focus/focus4.html|title=To Kill a Cross-Dresser - Jamaica Flirts with Jim Crow|newspaper=The Gleaner|author=Duncan, Newton D.|accessdate=11 October 2013|date=1 September 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705230144/http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20130901/focus/focus4.html|archivedate=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in the Jamaican broadsheet ''[[The Gleaner (newspaper)|The Gleaner]]'', Carolyn Cooper, Professor of Literary and Cultural Studies at UWI, condemned the group who committed Jones' murder. She blamed their behaviour on the selective use of the [[Bible]], noting that while many Jamaicans embrace those Biblical passages which [[The Bible and homosexuality|condemn same-sex sexual activity and cross-dressing]], they are themselves typically guilty of many other Biblical sins, such as [[adultery]] and [[murder]].&lt;ref name="Cooper"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20130804/cleisure/cleisure3.html|title=Dressed for Murder|newspaper=The Gleaner|author=Cooper, Carolyn|accessdate=14 August 2013|date=4 August 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222191011/http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20130804/cleisure/cleisure3.html|archivedate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She commented that Jones had been killed just for being himself and expressed the hope that his killers face legal prosecution for their crime.&lt;ref name="Cooper"/&gt; The following week she published a follow-up article in which she responded to several emails that she had received which claimed that the real victims of the scenario were the men whom Jones deceived when he was dancing with them. She reiterated her condemnation of Jones' killers, remarking that rather than retaliating violently, they should have brushed it off with a humorous comment.&lt;ref name="Cooper2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20130811/cleisure/cleisure3.html|title=Sexual Falsehood Top to Bottom|newspaper=The Gleaner|author=Cooper, Carolyn|accessdate=14 August 2013|date=11 August 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222205646/http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20130811/cleisure/cleisure3.html|archivedate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jaevion Nelson, an [[HIV/AIDS]] campaigner and human rights advocate, also published an article on the subject in ''The Gleaner''. He noted that his initial reaction was to question why Jones had gone to the dance party and why he was not satisfied in attending Jamaica's [[Underground culture|underground]] gay parties. He added that he had subsequently realised that adopting this viewpoint was rooted in "the culture of violence" by which a [[victim blaming|victim is blamed]] for what happened to them. He called on Jamaicans to be tolerant of LGBT individuals, and to focus on "rebuilding this great nation on the principles of inclusivity, love, equality and respect with no distinctions whatsoever".&lt;ref name="Nelson"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20130801/cleisure/cleisure3.html|title=Make Space for Pariahs|newspaper=The Gleaner|author=Nelson, Jaevion|accessdate=14 August 2013|date=1 August 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130802004039/http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20130801/cleisure/cleisure3.html|archivedate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in ''The Gleaner'', Sheila Veléz Martínez, a law professor at the [[University of Pittsburgh]], condemned the murder as "alarming evidence" of the high rates of homophobia in Jamaican society.&lt;ref name="Martinez2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20130813/cleisure/cleisure3.html|title=Gov't Shouldn't Let Dwayne Jones' Death Go in Vain|newspaper=The Gleaner|author=Veléz Martínez, Sheila|accessdate=14 August 2013|date=13 August 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705231423/http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20130727/news/news3.html|archivedate=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 July, the [[J-FLAG|Jamaica Forum for Lesbians, All-Sexuals &amp; Gays]] (J-FLAG), an LGBT rights organisation, issued a public statement expressing their "deep concern" regarding the case, and offering their condolences to Jones' friends and family. They encouraged local people to aid the police in locating the perpetrators of the attack, which they asserted was an affront to Jamaica's democracy.&lt;ref name="J-FLAG"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jflag.org/2013/07/violence-against-lgbt-people-is-an-affront-to-democracy/|title=Violence is an Affront to Democracy|publisher=Jamaica Forum for Lesbians, All-Sexuals &amp; Gays|accessdate=14 August 2013|date=23 July 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6LCeQaWv7?url=http://www.jflag.org/2013/07/violence-against-lgbt-people-is-an-affront-to-democracy/|archivedate=17 November 2013|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gleaner24"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/latest/article.php?id=46697|title=J-FLAG Condemns Mob Killing of Alleged MoBay Cross-Dresser|newspaper=The Gleaner|accessdate=14 August 2013|date=24 July 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ZnuEKr1x?url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/power/46697|archivedate=5 July 2015|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sieczkowski"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/25/dwayne-jones-cross-dressing-jamaican-stabbed_n_3652665.html|title=Dwayne Jones, 'Cross-Dressing' Jamaican Teen, Allegedly 'Chopped and Stabbed' to Death by Mob|newspaper=[[HuffPost|The Huffington Post]]|author=Sieczkowski, Cavan|accessdate=14 August 2013| date=25 July 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114211847/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/25/dwayne-jones-cross-dressing-jamaican-stabbed_n_3652665.html|archivedate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; J-FLAG's director Dane Lewis later commented that despite an increase in homophobic violence, Jamaican society was becoming more tolerant toward LGBT people; he attributed this to the actions of individuals like Jones, who have helped improve the public visibility of LGBT people in Jamaican society.&lt;ref name="Roberts"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/08/12/murdered-jamaican-trans-teenager-dwayne-jones-suffered-bullying-from-father-and-at-school/|title=Murdered Jamaican trans teenager Dwayne Jones suffered bullying from father and at school|publisher=PinkNews|author=Roberts, Scott|accessdate=14 August 2013|date=12 August 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705225641/http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/08/12/murdered-jamaican-trans-teenager-dwayne-jones-suffered-bullying-from-father-and-at-school/|archivedate=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another LGBT rights organisation, [[Quality of Citizenship Jamaica]], issued a press release calling for the government and churches to engage with LGBT organisations to establish common ground which could be undergirded by the principle of "true respect for all," found in the nation's [[Jamaica, Land We Love|National Anthem]].&lt;ref name="QCJ"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://qcjm.org/press-release-murder-of-17yr-old-irwin-st-james/|title=Press Release – Murder of 17yr old, Irwin St. James|publisher=Quality of Citizenship Jamaica|accessdate=15 October 2013| date=23 July 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705225243/http://qcjm.org/press-release-murder-of-17yr-old-irwin-st-james/|archivedate=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human rights organisation [[Jamaicans for Justice]] called on Prime Minister [[Portia Simpson-Miller]] and religious leaders to condemn the murder, also commenting on what they saw as a lack of media coverage and public outrage about the incident, adding that "we must ask ourselves what this says about us as a people."&lt;ref name="Martinez"/&gt;

News of Jones' murder attracted international media attention, resulting in condemnation of the killing by human rights groups.&lt;ref name="JamaicaObserver"/&gt; Graeme Reid, the LGBT Rights Program director at Human Rights Watch in New York, issued a statement that the Jamaican government should send an "unequivocal message" that there would be "zero tolerance" of anti-LGBT violence.&lt;ref name="IBTimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-23544130|title=Call for probe into death of Jamaica 'cross-dresser'|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=14 August 2013|date=2 August 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101013331/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-23544130|archivedate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reid noted that Jamaica's Prime Minister had vowed to decriminalise same-sex sexual activity in her [[Jamaican general election, 2011|2011 election campaign]] but had yet to implement that promise. He encouraged the Jamaican authorities to take action to investigate Jones' murder and to promote respect for the country's LGBT citizens.&lt;ref name="IBTimes"/&gt;

In a February 2014 briefing, the U.S. [[Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor|Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]], [[Uzra Zeya]], cited Jones' case as well as the torture and murder of Cameroonian HIV/AIDS activist [[Eric Ohena Lembembe]] as examples of the "troubling acts of violence" against LGBT individuals that had happened across the globe in the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Zeya, Uzra|title=Briefing on the Country Reports on Human Rights|date=27 February 2014|website=United States Department of State|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/rm/2014/222659.htm|accessdate=19 October 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113022755/http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/rm/2014/222659.htm|archivedate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her introduction to an academic study of "queerness and children's literature", Laura Robinson, an Associate Professor of English at the [[Royal Military College of Canada]], cited Jones' murder alongside the 2013 [[Russian LGBT propaganda law]] as an example in which youth issues intersected with LGBT issues. She added that Jones was a "child who did not end up having what [[Judith Butler]] calls a 'livable life'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Robinson, Laura|title=Queerness and Children's Literature: Embracing the Negative|journal=Bookbird: A Journal of International Children's Literature|volume=52|number=1|date=January 2014|pages=v–vi|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/bookbird/v052/52.1.robinson01.html|doi=10.1353/bkb.2014.0034}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Rubin2.jpg|thumb|[[Rubin vase|Rubin's vase]] is an [[optical illusion]] in which the negative space around the vase forms the silhouettes of two faces in profile, a well-known example of [[Figure-ground (perception)|figure-ground reversal by emphasizing that negative space]]]]

'''Negative space''', in [[art]], is the space around and between the subject(s) of an image. Negative space may be most evident when the space around a subject, not the subject itself, forms an interesting or artistically relevant shape, and such space occasionally is used to artistic effect as the "real" subject of an image.

==Overview==
The use of negative space is a key element of artistic composition. The [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word "[[Ma (negative space)|ma]]" is sometimes used for this concept, for example in [[garden design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.gardenweb.com/forums/load/jgard/msg100248139141.html |title=FAQ: 'Ma' and 'Mu' - Japanese Gardens Forum - GardenWeb |publisher=Forums.gardenweb.com |date= |accessdate=2009-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/Ne.html |title=ArtLex's Ne-Nz page |publisher=Artlex.com |date= |accessdate=2009-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990504184946/http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/Ne.html |archivedate=1999-05-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfj-online.org/journalPages/MFJ38/iimura.html |title=A Note for MA: Space/Time in the Garden of Ryoan-Ji - Iimura |publisher=Mfj-online.org |date= |accessdate=2009-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a two-tone, black-and-white image, a subject is normally depicted in black and the space around it is left blank (white), thereby forming a [[silhouette]] of the subject. Reversing the tones so that the space around the subject is printed black and the subject itself is left blank, however, causes the negative space to be apparent as it forms shapes around the subject. This is called [[Figure-ground (perception)|figure-ground reversal]].

In [[graphic design]] of printed or displayed materials, where effective communication is the objective, the use of negative space may be crucial. Not only within the [[typography]], but in its placement in relation to the whole. It is the basis of why upper and lower case typography always is more legible than the use of all capital letters.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} Negative space varies around lower case letters, allowing the human eye to distinguish each word rapidly as one distinctive item, rather than having to parse out what the words are in a [[Space (punctuation)|string of letters]] that all present the same overall profile as in all caps. The same judicious use of negative space drives the [[white space (visual arts)|effectiveness of the entire design]]. Because of the long history of the use of black ink on white paper, "[[white space (visual arts)|white space]]" is the term often used in graphics to identify the same separation.

Elements of an image that distract from the intended subject, or in the case of [[photography]], objects in the same [[focal plane]], are not considered negative space. Negative space may be used to depict a subject in a chosen medium by showing everything around the subject, but not the subject itself. Use of negative space will produce a [[silhouette]] of the subject. Most often, negative space is used as a neutral or contrasting background to draw attention to the main subject, which then is referred to as the positive space.

==Use==
Considering and improving the balance between negative space and positive space in a composition is considered by many to enhance the design. This basic, but often overlooked, principle of design gives the eye a "place to rest," increasing the appeal of a composition through subtle means.

The use of negative space in art may be analogous to silence in music, but only when it is juxtaposed with adjacent musical ideas. As such, there is a difference between inert and active silences in music, where the latter is more closely analogous to negative space in art.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10018">In [[mathematics]],  a '''nilmanifold''' is a [[differentiable manifold]] which has a transitive [[nilpotent group|nilpotent]] group of diffeomorphisms acting on it.  As such, a nilmanifold is an example of a [[homogeneous space]] and is diffeomorphic to the [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient space]] &lt;math&gt;N/H&lt;/math&gt;, the quotient of a nilpotent [[Lie group]] ''N'' modulo a [[closed (topology)|closed]] [[subgroup]] ''H''.  This notion was introduced by [[Anatoly Maltsev|A. Mal'cev]] in 1951.

In the Riemannian category, there is also a good notion of a nilmanifold.  A [[Riemannian manifold]] is called a '''homogeneous nilmanifold''' if there exist a nilpotent group of isometries acting transitively on it.  The requirement that the transitive nilpotent group acts by isometries leads to the following rigid characterization: every homogeneous nilmanifold is isometric to a nilpotent Lie group with left-invariant metric (see Wilson &lt;ref&gt;E. Wilson, "Isometry groups on homogeneous nilmanifolds", Geometriae Dedicata 12 (1982) 337–346&lt;/ref&gt;).

Nilmanifolds are important geometric objects and often arise as concrete examples with interesting properties; in Riemannian geometry these spaces always have mixed curvature,&lt;ref&gt;Milnor, John ''Curvatures of left invariant metrics on Lie groups.'' Advances in Math. 21 (1976), no. 3, 293–329.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Almost flat manifold|almost flat spaces]] arise as quotients of nilmanifolds,&lt;ref&gt;Gromov, M. ''Almost flat manifolds.'' J. Differential Geom. 13 (1978), no. 2, 231–241.&lt;/ref&gt; and compact nilmanifolds have been used to construct elementary examples of collapse of Riemannian metrics under the Ricci flow.&lt;ref&gt;Chow, Bennett; Knopf, Dan, ''The Ricci flow: an introduction.'' Mathematical Surveys and Monographs, 110. American Mathematical Society, Providence, RI, 2004. xii+325 pp. {{isbn|0-8218-3515-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to their role in geometry, nilmanifolds are increasingly being seen as having a role in [[arithmetic combinatorics]] (see Green–Tao &lt;ref&gt;Ben Green and Terence Tao, [https://arxiv.org/pdf/math.NT/0606088 Linear equations in primes],  22 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[ergodic theory]] (see, e.g., Host–Kra &lt;ref&gt;Bernard Host and [[Bryna Kra]], [http://www.math.northwestern.edu/~kra/papers/convnil.pdf Nonconventional ergodic averages and nilmanifolds], Ann. of Math. (2) 161 (2005), no. 1, 397–488.&lt;/ref&gt;).

== Compact nilmanifolds ==
A compact nilmanifold is a nilmanifold which is compact.  One way to construct such spaces is to start with a simply connected nilpotent Lie group ''N'' and a [[discrete subgroup]] &lt;math&gt; \Gamma &lt;/math&gt;.  If the subgroup &lt;math&gt; \Gamma &lt;/math&gt; acts cocompactly (via right multiplication) on ''N'', then the quotient manifold &lt;math&gt;N/ \Gamma &lt;/math&gt; will be a compact nilmanifold.  As Mal'cev has shown, every compact
nilmanifold is obtained this way.&lt;ref&gt;A. I. Mal'cev, ''On a class of homogeneous spaces'', AMS Translation No. '''39''' (1951).&lt;/ref&gt;

Such a subgroup &lt;math&gt; \Gamma &lt;/math&gt; as above is called a [[lattice (group theory)|lattice]] in ''N''.  It is well known that a nilpotent Lie group admits a lattice if and only if its Lie algebra admits a basis with rational [[structure constants]]: this is [[Malcev's criterion]].  Not all nilpotent Lie groups admit lattices; for more details, see also Raghunathan.&lt;ref&gt;Raghunathan, Chapter II, ''Discrete Subgroups of Lie Groups'', M. S. Raghunathan&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''compact Riemannian nilmanifold''' is a compact Riemannian manifold which is locally isometric to a nilpotent Lie group with left-invariant metric.  These spaces are constructed as follows.  Let &lt;math&gt; \Gamma &lt;/math&gt; be a lattice in a simply connected nilpotent Lie group ''N'', as above.  Endow ''N'' with a left-invariant (Riemannian) metric.  Then the subgroup &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; acts by isometries on ''N'' via left-multiplication.  Thus the quotient &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \backslash N&lt;/math&gt; is a compact space locally isometric to ''N''.  Note: this space is naturally diffeomorphic to &lt;math&gt;N / \Gamma &lt;/math&gt;.

Compact nilmanifolds also arise as [[principal bundles]].  For example, consider a 2-step [[nilpotent Lie group]] ''N'' which admits a lattice (see above).  Let &lt;math&gt;Z=[N,N]&lt;/math&gt; be the commutator subgroup of ''N''.  Denote by p the dimension of ''Z'' and by q the codimension of ''Z''; i.e. the dimension of ''N'' is p+q.  It is known (see Raghunathan) that &lt;math&gt;Z \cap \Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a lattice in ''Z''.  Hence, &lt;math&gt;G = Z/(Z \cap \Gamma )&lt;/math&gt; is a ''p''-dimensional compact torus.  Since ''Z'' is central in ''N'', the group G acts on the compact nilmanifold &lt;math&gt;P = N/ \Gamma&lt;/math&gt; with quotient space &lt;math&gt;M=P/G&lt;/math&gt;.  This base manifold ''M'' is a ''q''-dimensional compact torus.  It has been shown that ever principal torus bundle over a torus is of this form, see.&lt;ref&gt;Palais, R. S.; Stewart, T. E. ''Torus bundles over a torus.'' Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 12 1961 26–29.&lt;/ref&gt;  More generally, a compact nilmanifold is torus bundle, over a torus bundle, over...over a torus.

As mentioned above, [[almost flat manifold]]s are intimately compact nilmanifolds.  See that article for more information.

==Complex nilmanifolds==

Historically, a '''complex nilmanifold''' meant a quotient of a complex nilpotent Lie group over
a [[cocompact lattice]]. An example of such a nilmanifold is an [[Iwasawa manifold]]. From the 1980s, another (more general) notion of a complex nilmanifold gradually replaced this one.

An '''almost complex structure''' on a real Lie algebra ''g'' is an endomorphism &lt;math&gt;I:\; g \rightarrow g&lt;/math&gt; which squares to
&amp;minus;Id&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt;. This operator is called '''a complex structure''' if its eigenspaces, corresponding to eigenvalues
&lt;math&gt;\pm \sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, are subalgebras in &lt;math&gt;g \otimes {\Bbb C}&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, ''I'' defines a left-invariant complex structure on the corresponding Lie group. Such a manifold (''G'',''I'') is called '''a complex group manifold'''.
It is easy to see that every connected complex [[homogeneous space|homogeneous manifold]] equipped with a free, transitive, holomorphic action by a real Lie group is obtained this way.

Let ''G'' be a real, nilpotent Lie group. A '''complex nilmanifold''' is a quotient of a complex group  manifold (''G'',''I''), equipped with a left-invariant complex structure, by a discrete, cocompact lattice, acting from the right.

Complex nilmanifolds are usually not homogeneous, as complex varieties.

In complex dimension 2, the only complex nilmanifolds are a complex torus and a [[Kodaira surface]].&lt;ref&gt;Keizo Hasegawa  ''Complex and Kähler structures on Compact Solvmanifolds,'' J. Symplectic Geom. Volume 3, Number 4 (2005), 749–767.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==

Compact nilmanifolds (except a torus) are never [[formal space|homotopy formal]].&lt;ref&gt;Keizo Hasegawa,  ''Minimal models of nilmanifolds,'' Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 106 (1989), no. 1, 65–71.&lt;/ref&gt; This implies immediately that compact nilmanifolds (except a torus) cannot
admit a [[Kähler structure]] (see also &lt;ref&gt;C. Benson, C.S. Gordon, ''Kähler and symplectic structures on nilmanifolds'', Topology '''27'''(4) (1988) 513–518.&lt;/ref&gt;).

Topologically, all nilmanifolds can be obtained
as iterated torus bundles over a torus. This is easily seen from a filtration by [[Upper central series|ascending central series]].&lt;ref&gt;Sönke Rollenske,  [https://arxiv.org/abs/0901.3120 Geometry of nilmanifolds with left-invariant complex structure and deformations in the large], 40 pages, arXiv:0901.3120, Proc. London Math. Soc., 99, 425–460, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

=== Nilpotent Lie groups ===
From the above definition of homogeneous nilmanifolds, it is clear that any nilpotent Lie group with left-invariant metric is a homogeneous nilmanifold.  The most familiar nilpotent Lie groups are matrix groups whose diagonal entries are 1 and whose lower diagonal entries are all zeros.

For example, the [[Heisenberg group]] is a 2-step nilpotent Lie group.  This nilpotent Lie group is also special in that it admits a compact quotient.  The group &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; would be the upper triangular matrices with integral coefficients.  The resulting nilmanifold is 3-dimensional.  One possible [[fundamental domain]] is (isomorphic to) [0,1]&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; with the faces identified in a suitable way.  This is because an element &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; x &amp; z \\ &amp; 1 &amp; y \\ &amp; &amp; 1\end{pmatrix}\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; of the nilmanifold can be represented by the element &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; \{x\} &amp; \{z-x \lfloor y \rfloor \} \\ &amp; 1 &amp; \{y\} \\ &amp; &amp; 1\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; in the fundamental domain.  Here &lt;math&gt;\lfloor x \rfloor&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[floor function]] of ''x'', and &lt;math&gt;\{ x \}&lt;/math&gt; the [[Floor_function#Fractional_part|fractional part]].  The appearance of the floor function here is a clue to the relevance of nilmanifolds to additive combinatorics: the so-called bracket polynomials, or generalised polynomials, seem to be important in the development of higher-order Fourier analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Green and Terence Tao, [https://arxiv.org/abs/math.NT/0606088 Linear equations in primes],  Ann. of Math.  Volume 171 (2010), Issue 3, 1753–1850&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abelian Lie groups ===
A simpler example would be any abelian Lie group.  This is because any such group is a nilpotent Lie group.  For example, one can take the group of real numbers under addition, and the discrete, cocompact subgroup consisting of the integers.  The resulting 1-step nilmanifold is the familiar circle &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.  Another familiar example might be the compact 2-torus or Euclidean space under addition.

== Generalizations ==
A parallel construction based on [[solvable group|solvable]] Lie groups produces a class of spaces called '''solvmanifolds'''. An important example of a solvmanifolds are [[Inoue surface]]s, known in [[complex geometry]].

The '''P300''' ('''P3''') wave is an [[event related potential]] (ERP) component elicited in the process of decision making. It is considered to be an [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] potential, as its occurrence links not to the physical attributes of a stimulus, but to a person's reaction to it. More specifically, the P300 is thought to reflect processes involved in stimulus evaluation or categorization.  It is usually elicited using the [[oddball paradigm]], in which low-probability target items are mixed with high-probability non-target (or "standard") items.

When recorded by  [[electroencephalography]] (EEG), it surfaces as a positive deflection in voltage with a latency (delay between stimulus and response) of roughly 250 to 500 ms.&lt;ref name="Polich2007"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Polich, J.|year=2007|title=Updating P300: An integrative theory of P3a and P3b|journal= Clinical Neurophysiology|volume=118|issue=10|pages=2128–2148|doi=10.1016/j.clinph.2007.04.019|pmc=2715154|pmid=17573239}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The signal is typically measured most strongly by the electrodes covering the [[parietal lobe]].  The presence, magnitude, topography and timing of this signal are often used as metrics of [[cognitive function]] in decision making processes. While the neural substrates of this ERP component still remain hazy, the reproducibility and ubiquity of this signal makes it a common choice for psychological tests in both the clinic and laboratory.

== History ==
 
Early observations of the P300 (more specifically, the component that would later be named the P3b) were reported in the mid-1960s.  In 1964, researchers Chapman and Bragdon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Chapman, R.M.|author2=Bragdon, H.R.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1964|title=Evoked responses to numerical and non-numerical visual stimuli while problem solving|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume=203|pages=1155–1157|pmid=14213667|doi=10.1038/2031155a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;   found that ERP responses to [[visual]] stimuli differed depending on whether the stimuli had meaning or not.  They showed subjects two kinds of visual stimuli: numbers and flashes of light.  Subjects viewed these stimuli one at a time in a sequence.   For every two numbers, the subjects were required to make simple decisions, such as telling which of the two numbers was numerically smaller or larger, which came first or second in the sequence, or whether they were equal.  When examining evoked potentials to these stimuli (i.e., ERPs), Chapman and Bragdon found that both the numbers and the flashes elicited the expected sensory responses (e.g., [[visual N1]] components), and that the amplitude of these responses varied in an expected fashion with the intensity of the stimuli.  They also found that the ERP responses to the numbers, but not to the light flashes, contained a large positivity that peaked around 300&amp;nbsp;ms after the stimulus appeared.  Chapman and Bragdon speculated that this differential response to the numbers, which came to be known as the P300 response, resulted from the fact that the numbers were meaningful to the participants, based on the task that they were asked to perform.

In 1965, Sutton and colleagues published results from two experiments that further explored this late positivity.  They presented subjects with either a cue that indicated whether the following stimulus would be a click or a flash, or a cue which required subjects to guess whether the following stimulus would be a click or a flash.  They found that when subjects were required to guess what the following stimulus would be, the amplitude of the "late positive complex"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sutton, S.|author2=Braren, M.|author3=Zubin, J.|author4=John, E.R.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1965|title=Evoked-Potential Correlates of Stimulus Uncertainty|journal=Science|volume=150|issue=3700|pages=1187–1188|pmid=5852977|doi=10.1126/science.150.3700.1187}}&lt;/ref&gt; was larger than when they knew what the stimulus would be.  In a second experiment, they presented two cue types.  For one cue there was a 2 in 3 chance that the following stimulus would be a click and a 1 in 3 chance that the following stimulus would be a flash.  The second cue type had probabilities that were the reverse of the first.  They found that the amplitude of the positive complex was larger in response to the less probable stimuli, or the one that only had a 1 in 3 chance of appearing.  Another important finding from these studies is that this late positive complex was observed for both the clicks and flashes, indicating that the physical type of the stimulus (auditory or visual) did not matter.

In later studies published in 1967, Sutton and colleagues had subjects guess whether they would hear one click or two clicks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sutton, S.|author2=Tueting, P.|author3=Zubin, J.|author4=John, E.R.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1967|title=Information delivery and the sensory evoked potential|journal=Science|volume=155|issue=3768|pages=1436–1439|doi=10.1126/science.155.3768.1436|pmid=6018511}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They again observed a positivity around 300&amp;nbsp;ms after the second click occurred – or would have occurred, in the case of the single click.  They also had subjects guess how long the interval between clicks might be, and in this case, the late positivity occurred 300&amp;nbsp;ms after the second click.  This shows two important findings: first, that this late positivity occurred when uncertainty about the type of click was resolved, and second, that even an absence of a stimulus would elicit the late positive complex, if said stimulus was relevant to the task.  These early studies encouraged the use of ERP methods to study cognition and provided a foundation for the extensive work on the P300 in the decades that followed.

== P3a and P3b ==
{{main|P3a|P3b}}
Since the initial discovery of the P300, research has shown that the P300 has two subcomponents. The subcomponents are the novelty P3, or [[P3a]], and the classic P300, which has since been renamed [[P3b]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Squires, N.K.|author2=Squires, K.C.|author3=Hillyard, S.A.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1975|title=Two varieties of long-latency positive waves evoked by unpredictable auditory stimuli in man|journal=Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology|volume=38|issue=4|pages=387–401|pmid=46819|doi=10.1016/0013-4694(75)90263-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The P3a, or novelty P3,&lt;ref name="Comerchero"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0168-5597(98)00033-1 | last1 = Comerchero | first1 = M. D. | last2 = Polich | first2 = J. | year = 1999 | title = P3a and P3b from typical auditory and visual stimuli | url =https://www.sfu.ca/~jmcd/courses/925/papers/Comerchero(1999).pdf | journal = Clinical Neurophysiology | volume = 110 | issue = 1| pages = 24–30 | pmid = 10348317 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has a positive-going amplitude that displays maximum amplitude over frontal/central electrode sites and has a peak latency in the range of 250-280&amp;nbsp;ms.  The P3a has been associated with [[brain]] activity related to the engagement of [[attention]] (especially the [[orienting response|orienting]], involuntary shifts to changes in the environment), and the processing of novelty.&lt;ref name="fMRI"&gt;{{cite book|author=Polich, J.|year=2003|contribution=Overview of P3a and P3b|editor=J. Polich|title=Detection of Change: Event-Related Potential and fMRI Findings|pages=83–98|publisher=Kluwer Academic Press|location=Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The P3b has a positive-going amplitude (usually relative to a reference behind the ear or the average of two such references) that peaks at around 300&amp;nbsp;ms, and the peak will vary in latency from 250–500&amp;nbsp;ms or more depending upon the task.&lt;ref name="Polich2007" /&gt; Amplitudes are typically highest on the scalp over parietal brain areas.&lt;ref name="Polich2007" /&gt;  The P3b has been a prominent tool used to study cognitive processes, especially psychology research on information processing.  Generally speaking, improbable events will elicit a P3b, and the less probable the event, the larger the P3b amplitude.&lt;ref name="Donchin1981"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Donchin, E.|year=1981|title=Presidential Address, 1980: Surprise!...Surprise?|journal=Psychophysiology|volume=18|issue=5|pages=493–513|pmid=7280146|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8986.1981.tb01815.x|url=http://apsychoserver.psych.arizona.edu/jjbareprints/psyc501a/readings/Donchin_Surprise,%20Surprise_%20Psychofizz_1980.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in order to elicit a P3b, the improbable event must be related to the task at hand in some way (for example, the improbable event could be an infrequent target letter in a stream of letters, to which a subject might respond with a button press).  The P3b can also be used to measure how demanding a task is on [[cognitive load|cognitive workload]].&lt;ref  name="Donchin1981" /&gt;

== Applications ==
Since the mid-1980s, one of the most discussed uses of ERPs such as the P300 is related to [[lie detection]]. In a proposed "guilty knowledge test"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Farwell LA, Smith SS|title=Using brain MERMER testing to detect knowledge despite efforts to conceal|journal=J Forensic Sci|volume=46|issue=1|pages=135–143|date=January 2001|url=http://www.brainwavescience.com/Farwell_Smith_Journal_of_Forensic_Sciences_Brain_Fingerprinting.pdf|pmid=11210899}}&lt;/ref&gt; a subject is interrogated via the oddball paradigm much as they would be in a typical lie-detector situation. This practice has recently enjoyed increased legal permissibility while conventional [[polygraph]]y has seen its use diminish, in part owing to the unconscious and uncontrollable aspects of the P300. The technique relies on reproducible elicitation of the P300 wave, central to the idea of a Memory and Encoding Related Multifaceted Electroencephalographic Response (MERMER) developed by Dr. [[Lawrence Farwell]].

Applications in [[brain computer interface|brain-computer interfacing]] (BCI) have also been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Piccione F, Giorgi F, Tonin P|displayauthors=etal|title=P300-based brain computer interface: Reliability and performance in healthy and paralysed participants|journal=Clin Neurophysiol|volume=117|issue=3|pages=531–537|date=March 2006|pmid=16458069|doi=10.1016/j.clinph.2005.07.024}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "seventeen"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Donchin E, Spencer KM, Wijesinghe R|title=The Mental Prosthesis: Assessing the Speed of a P300-Based Brain–Computer Interface|journal=IEEE Transactions on Rehabilitation Engineering|volume=8|issue=2|pages=174–179|date=June 2000|doi=10.1109/86.847808}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Nijboer F, Sellers EW, Mellinger J|displayauthors=etal|title=A P300-based brain–computer interface for people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|journal=Clin Neurophysiol|volume=119|pages=1909–1916|pmid=18571984|doi=10.1016/j.clinph.2008.03.034|pmc=2853977}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.intechopen.com/articles/show/title/application-of-p300-event-related-potential-in-brain-computer-interface|title=Application of P300 Event-Related Potential in Brain-Computer Interface|last=Haider|first=Ali|last2=Fazel-Rezai|first2=Reza|date=2017|publisher=InTech|language=en|doi=10.5772/intechopen.69309}}&lt;/ref&gt; The P300 has a number of desirable qualities that aid in implementation of such systems. First, the waveform is consistently detectable and is elicited in response to precise stimuli. The P300 waveform can also be evoked in nearly all subjects with little variation in measurement techniques, which may help simplify interface designs and permit greater usability. The speed at which an interface is able to operate depends on how detectable the signal is despite "noise." One negative characteristic of the P300 is that the amplitude of the waveform requires averaging of multiple recordings to isolate the signal. This and other post-recording processing steps determine the overall speed of an interface.&lt;ref name="seventeen" /&gt; The algorithm proposed by Farwell and Donchin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=L. A. Farwell|author2=E. Donchin|lastauthoramp=y|title=Talking off the top of your head: A mental prosthesis utilizing event-related brain potentials|journal=Electroencephalogr. Clin. Neurophysiol.|volume=70|issue=6|pages=510–523|year=1988|pmid=2461285|doi=10.1016/0013-4694(88)90149-6|url=http://www.brainwavescience.com/pdf/publication/Farwell_Donchin_Talking_Off_the_Top_of_Your_Head_1988_BCI.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides an example of a simple BCI that relies on the unconscious decision making processes of the P300 to drive a computer. A 6×6 grid of characters is presented to the subject, and various columns or rows are highlighted. When a column or row contains the character a subject desires to communicate, the P300 response is elicited (since this character is "special" it is the target stimulus described in the typical oddball paradigm). The combination of the row and column which evoked the response locates the desired character. A number of such trials must be averaged to clear noise from the EEG. The speed of the highlighting determines the number of characters processed per minute. Results from studies using this setup show that normal subjects could achieve a 95% success rate at 3.4–4.3 chars/min. Such success rates are not limited to non-disabled users; a study conducted in 2000 revealed that 4 paralyzed participants (one with complete paraplegia, three with incomplete paraplegia) performed as successfully as 10 normal participants.&lt;ref name = "seventeen"/&gt;

Scientific research often relies on measurement of the P300 to examine event related potentials, especially with regard to decision making. Because cognitive impairment is often correlated with modifications in the P300, the waveform can be used as a measure for the efficacy of various treatments on cognitive function. Some have suggested its use as a clinical marker for precisely these reasons. There is a broad range of uses for the P300 in clinical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hansenne M|trans-title=The P300 event-related potential. II.

'''Passion''' (Greek ''πασχω'' "to suffer, to be acted on"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/greek/3958.htm|title=3958. paschó|work=Strong's Concordance|accessdate=December 15, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170718232618/http://biblehub.com/greek/3958.htm|archivedate=July 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Late Latin (chiefly Christian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/passion|title=Definition of passion|work=Oxford English Dictionary|accessdate=December 15, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170504214510/https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/passion|archivedate=May 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) ''passio'' "passion; suffering" (from Latin ''pati'' "to suffer")) is a feeling of intense enthusiasm towards or compelling desire for someone or something. Passion can range from eager interest in or admiration for an idea, proposal, or cause; to enthusiastic enjoyment of an interest or activity; to strong attraction, excitement, or emotion towards a person. It is particularly used in the context of romance or sexual desire, though it generally implies a deeper or more encompassing emotion than that implied by the term ''[[lust]]''.

[[Denis Diderot]] describes passions as "penchants, inclinations, desires and aversions carried to a certain degree of intensity, combined with an indistinct sensation of pleasure or pain, occasioned or accompanied by some irregular movement of the blood and animal spirits, are what we call passions. They can be so strong as to inhibit all practice of personal freedom, a state in which the soul is in some sense rendered passive; whence the name passions. This inclination or so-called disposition of the soul, is born of the opinion we hold that a great good or a great evil is contained in an object which in and of itself arouses passion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|hdl=2027/spo.did2222.0000.248|title=Passions|first=Denis |last=Diderot|date=1 April 2004|journal=Encyclopedia of Diderot &amp; d'Alembert - Collaborative Translation Project|volume=12|page=142–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He further breaks down pleasure and pain, which are the guiding principles of passion into four major categories:

# Pleasures and pains of the senses 
# Pleasures of the mind or of the imagination 
# Our perfection or our imperfection of virtues or vices 
# Pleasures and pains in the happiness or misfortunes of others

==Reason==

'''Strong Desire for something:''' 
In whatever context, if someone desires for something and that desire has some strong feeling or emotion is defined in terms of passion. Passion has no boundary, being passionate about something which is boundless can be sometimes dangerous, In which person forget about everything and is fully determined towards the particular thing-'''(Sanyukta)'''

In his wake, [[Stoicism|Stoics]] like [[Epictetus]] emphasized that "the most important and especially pressing field of study is that which has to do with the stronger emotions...sorrows, lamentations, envies...passions which make it impossible for us even to listen to reason".&lt;ref&gt;W. A. Oldfield trans., ''Epitectus: The Discourses Vol II''  (london 1978) p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; The Stoic tradition still lay behind [[Hamlet]]'s plea to "Give me that man That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him In my heart's core",&lt;ref&gt;Harold Jenkins ed., ''Hamlet'' (London 1995) p. 292&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Erasmus]]'s lament that "Jupiter has bestowed far more passion than reason&amp;nbsp;– you could calculate the ratio as 24 to one".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Goleman, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; It was only with the [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]] that a valorisation of passion ''over'' reason took hold in the Western tradition: "the more Passion there is, the better the Poetry".&lt;ref&gt;John Dennis, in M. H. Abrams, ''The Mirror and the Lamp'' (Oxford 1953) p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

The recent concerns of emotional intelligence have been to find a synthesis of the two forces—something that "turns the old understanding of the tension between reason and feeling on its head: it is not that we want to do away with emotion and put reason in its place, as Erasmus had it, but instead find the intelligent balance of the two".&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, p. 28-9&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Descartes' Error"===
[[Antonio Damasio]] studied what ensued when something "severed ties between the lower centres of the emotional brain...and the thinking abilities of the [[neocortex]]".&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; He found that while "emotions and feelings can cause havoc in the processes of reasoning...the ''absence'' of emotion and feeling is no less damaging";&lt;ref&gt;Antonio R. Damasio, ''Descartes' Error'' (London 1996) p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt; and was led to "the counter-intuitive position that feelings are typically ''indispensable'' for rational decisions".&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; The passions, he concluded, "have a say on how the rest of the brain and cognition go about their business. Their influence is immense...[providing] a frame of reference&amp;nbsp;– as opposed to [[Descartes]]' error...the Cartesian idea of a disembodied mind".&lt;ref&gt;Damasio, p. 160 and p. 250&lt;/ref&gt;

==In marriage==

A tension or [[dialectic]] between marriage and passion can be traced back in Western society at least as far as the Middle Ages, and the emergence of the cult of [[courtly love]]. [[Denis de Rougemont]] has argued that 'since its origins in the twelfth century, passionate love was constituted in opposition to marriage'.&lt;ref&gt;Denis de Rougement, ''Love in the Western World'' (Princeton 1983) p. 276&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stacey Oliker]] writes that while "[[Puritanism]] prepared the ground for a marital love ideology by prescribing love in marriage", only from the eighteenth century has "romantic love ideology resolved the Puritan antagonism between passion and reason"&lt;ref&gt;Stacey J. Oliker, ''Best Friends and Marriage'' (1989) p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; in a marital context. (Note though that [[Saint Paul]] spoke of loving one's wife in [[Ephesians]] 5.)

==Intellectual passions==

[[George Bernard Shaw]] "insists that there are passions far more exciting than the physical ones...'intellectual passion, mathematical passion, passion for discovery and exploration: the mightiest of all passions'".&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Weintraub, ''Shaw's People'' (1996) p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; His contemporary, [[Sigmund Freud]], argued for a continuity (not a contrast) between the two, physical and intellectual, and commended the way "[[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]] had energetically sublimated his sexual passions into the passion for independent scientific research".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''Freud: A Life for Our Time'' (London 1989) p. 272&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a motivation in an occupation==
There are different reasons individuals are [[Motivation|motivated]] for an [[Job (role)|occupation]]. One of these includes passion for the occupation. When an individual is passionate about their occupation they tend to be less obsessive about their behavior while on their job, resulting in more work being done and more work satisfaction. These same individuals have higher levels of [[psychological]] well-being.&lt;ref name="BurkeFik"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burke|first=R. J.|author2=Fiksenbaum, Lisa|title=Work Motivations, Satisfactions, and Health Among Managers: Passion Versus Addiction|journal=Cross-Cultural Research|date=May 2009|volume=43|pages=349–365|doi=10.1177/1069397109336990|url=http://ccr.sagepub.com/content/43/4/349|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160812093750/http://ccr.sagepub.com/content/43/4/349|archivedate=2016-08-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When people genuinely enjoy their profession and are motivated by their passion, they tend to be more satisfied with their work and more psychologically healthy. When individuals are unsatisfied with their profession they tend to also be dissatisfied with their family relationships and experience psychological distress.&lt;ref name="BurkeFik"/&gt; Other reasons people are more satisfied when they are motivated by their passion for their occupation include the effects of intrinsic and external motivations. When an individual is doing the job to satisfy others, they tend to have lower levels of satisfaction and psychological health. Also, these same individuals have shown they are motivated by several beliefs and fears concerning other people.&lt;ref name="BurkeFik"/&gt; Thirdly, though some individuals believe one should not work extreme hours, many prefer it because of how passionate they are about the occupation. On the other hand, this may also put a strain on family relationships and friendships. The balance of the two is something that is hard to achieve and it is always hard to satisfy both parties.

===Work enjoyment vs. inner pressures===
There are different components that qualify as reasons for considering an individual as a [[workaholic]]. Burke &amp; Fiksenbaum refer to Spence and Robbins (1992) by stating two of the three workaholism components that are used to measure workaholism.  These include feeling driven to work because of inner pressure and work enjoyment.  Both of these affect an individual differently and each has different outcomes.  To begin, work enjoyment brings about more positive work outcomes and is unrelated to health indicators. Inner pressure, on the other hand, is negatively related with work outcomes and has been related negatively to measures of psychological health. Burke &amp; Fiksenbaum make a reference to Graves et al. (2006) when examining work enjoyment and inner pressures. Work enjoyment and inner pressure were tested with performance ratings. The former was positively related to performance ratings while the latter interfered with the performance-enhancing aspects of work enjoyment. Burke &amp; Fiksenbaum refer to Virick and Baruch (2007) when explaining how these two workaholism components affect [[life satisfaction]]. Not surprisingly, inner pressure lowered the balance between work-life and life satisfaction but enhanced people's performance at their occupation, whereas work enjoyment led to a positive balance between the two. Again, when individuals are passionate about their occupation and put in many hours, they then become concerned that their occupation will satisfy personal relationships and the balance must then be found according to the importance levels of the individual.&lt;ref name="BurkeFik"/&gt;

====Motivation and outcomes====
The researchers indicate different patterns of correlations between these two components. These patterns include antecedents and consequences. The two components offer unique motivations or orientations to work which result in its effects on work and well-being. Inner pressures will hinder performance while work enjoyment will smooth performance.  Inner pressures of workaholism have characteristics such as persistence, rigidity, perfectionism, and heightened levels of job stress. This component is also associated with working harder, not smarter.  On a more positive note, individuals who enjoy their work will have higher levels of performance for several reasons. These include creativity, trust in their colleagues, and reducing levels of stress.&lt;ref name="BurkeFik"/&gt;

====Good and bad workaholics====
Burke and Fiksenbaum refer to Schaufeli, Taris, and Bakker (2007) when they made a distinction between an individual being a good workaholic and him being a bad workaholic. A good workaholic will score higher on measures of work engagement and a bad workaholic will score higher on measures of burnout. They also suggest why this is – some individuals work because they are satisfied, engaged, and challenged and to prove a point. On the other hand, the opposite kind work hard because they are addicted to work; they see that the occupation makes a contribution to finding an identity and purpose.&lt;ref name="BurkeFik"/&gt;

====Desire in an occupation====
Passion and desire go hand in hand, especially as a motivation. Linstead &amp; Brewis refer to Merriam-Webster to say that passion is an "intense, driving, or overmastering feeling or conviction". This suggests that passion is a very intense emotion, but can be positive or negative. Negatively, it may be unpleasant at times. It could involve pain and has obsessive forms that can destroy the self and even others. In an occupation, when an individual is very passionate about their job, they may be so wrapped up in work that they cause pain to their loved ones by focusing more on their job than on their friendships and relationships. This is a constant battle of balance that is difficult to achieve and only an individual can decide where that line lies. Passion is connected to the concept of desire. In fact, they are inseparable, according to a mostly western way of thinking related to Plato, Aristotle, and Augustine. These two concepts cause individuals to reach out for something, or even someone. They both can either be creative or destructive and this dark side can very well be dangerous to the self or others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Linstead|first=S.|author2=Brewis, J.|title=Passion, Knowledge and Motivation: Ontolgies of Desire|journal=Organization|year=2007|volume=14|series=3|pages=351–371|doi=10.1177/1350508407076149|url=http://org.sagepub.com/content/14/3/351|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210041556/http://org.sagepub.com/content/14/3/351|archivedate=2015-12-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a motivation for hobbies==
[[Hobbies]] require a certain level of passion in order to continue engaging in the hobby. Singers, athletes, dancers, artists, and many others describe their emotion for their hobby as a passion. Although this might be the emotion they're feeling, passion is serving as a motivation for them to continue their hobby. Recently there has been a model to explain different types of passion that contribute to engaging in an activity.

=== Dualistic model ===
According to researchers who have tested this model, "A dualistic model in which passion is defined as a strong inclination or desire toward a self-defining activity that one likes (or even loves), that one finds important (high valuation), and in which one invests time and energy." &lt;ref name="Mediating"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Phillipe|first=F.L.|author2=Vallerand, R. J. |author3=Houlfort, N. |author4=Lavigne, G. L. |author5=Donahue, E. G. |title=Passion for an activity and quality of interpersonal relationships: The mediating role of emotions.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2010|volume=98|issue=6|pages=917–932 |doi=10.1037/a0018017 |pmid=20515247}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is proposed that there exist two types of passion. The first type of passion is harmonious passion.

"A harmonious passion refers to a strong desire to engage in the activity that remains under the person's control." &lt;ref name="Mediating"/&gt;This is mostly obtained when the person views their activity as part of their [[Identity (social science)|identity]]. Furthermore, once an activity is part of the person's identity then the motivation to continue the specific hobby is even stronger. The harmony obtained with this passion is conceived when the person is able both to freely engage in or to stop the hobby. It's not so much that the person is forced to continue this hobby, but on his or her own [[free will]] is able to engage in it. For example, if a girl loves to play [[volleyball]], but she has a project due the next day and her friends invite her to play, she should be able to say "no" on the basis of her own free will.

The second kind of passion in the dualistic model is ''obsessive passion''. Being the opposite of ''harmonious passion''. This type has a strong desire to engage in the activity, but it's not under the person's own control and he or she is forced to engage in the hobby. This type of passion has a negative effect on a person where they could feel they need to engage in their hobby to continue, for example,  interpersonal relationships, or "fit in" with the crowd. To change the above example, if the girl has an obsessive passion towards volleyball and she is asked to play with her friends, she will likely say "yes" even though she needs to finish her project for the next day.

==== Intrinsic motivation ====
Since passion can be a type of motivation in hobbies then assessing intrinsic motivation is appropriate. Intrinsic motivation helps define these types of passion. Passion naturally helps the needs or desires that motivate a person to some particular action or behavior.&lt;ref name="RobinKeys"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robinson|first=C.|title=The Keys to Turbo-Charging Intrinsic Motivation|journal=Journal For Quality &amp; Participation|year=2010|volume=33|issue=3|pages=4–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain abilities and hobbies can be developed early and the innate motivation is also something that comes early in life. Although someone might know how to engage in a hobby, this doesn't necessarily mean they are motivated to do it. Christine Robinson makes the point in her article that, " ...knowledge of your innate motivation can help guide action toward what will be fulfilling." &lt;ref name="RobinKeys"/&gt; Feeling satisfied and fulfilled builds the passion for the hobby to continue a person's happiness.

==Fictional examples==

In [[Margaret Drabble]]'s ''[[The Realms of Gold]]'', the hero flies hundreds of miles to reunite with the heroine, only to miss her by 24 hours&amp;nbsp;– leaving the onlookers "wondering what grand passion could have brought him so far...a quixotic look about him, a look of harassed desperation".&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Drabble, ''The Realms of Gold''(Penguin 1977) p. 296&lt;/ref&gt; When the couple ''do'' finally reunite, however, the heroine is less than impressed. "'If you ask me, it was a very ''childish'' gesture. You're not twenty-one now, you know'. 'No, I know. It was my last fling'".&lt;ref&gt;Drabble, p. 334&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Alberto Moravia]]'s ''1934'', the revolutionary double-agent, faced with the girl he is betraying, "was seized by violent desire...he never took his eyes off my bosom...I believe those two dark spots at the end of my breasts were enough to make him forget tsarism, revolution, political faith, ideology, and betrayal".&lt;ref&gt;Alberto Moravia, ''1934'' (London 1983) p. 128-9&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=October 2011}}
The '''Phillips curve''' is a single-equation [[econometric model]], named after [[William Phillips (economist)|William
Phillips]], describing a historical inverse relationship between rates of [[unemployment]] and corresponding rates of rises in wages that result within an economy. Stated simply, decreased unemployment, (i.e., increased levels of employment) in an economy will correlate with higher rates of wage rises.&lt;ref&gt;[[AW Phillips]], ‘The Relation between Unemployment and the Rate of Change of Money Wage Rates in the United Kingdom 1861–1957’ (1958) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2550759 25 Economica 283], referring to unemployment and the "change of money wage rates".&lt;/ref&gt; Phillips did not himself state there was any relationship between employment and [[inflation]], this notion was a trivial deduction from his statistical findings. Samuelson and Solow made the connection explicit and subsequently [[Milton Friedman]] from 1967&lt;ref&gt;M Friedman, ‘The Role of Monetary Policy’ (1968) 58(1) American Economic Review 1.&lt;/ref&gt; put the theoretical structure in place. In so doing, Friedman was to successfully predict the imminent collapse of Phillip's a-theoretic correlation.

While there is a short run tradeoff between unemployment and inflation, it has not been observed in the long run.&lt;ref name=chang&gt;Chang, R. (1997) [https://wwz.unibas.ch/fileadmin/wwz/redaktion/makrooekonomie/intermediate_macro/reader/7/02_ACFC7.pdf "Is Low Unemployment Inflationary?"] ''Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta Economic Review'' 1Q97:4-13&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, [[Milton Friedman]] asserted that the Phillips curve was only applicable in the short-run and that in the long-run, inflationary policies would not decrease unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Friedman |first=Milton |year=1968 |title=The role of monetary policy |journal=American Economic Review |volume=68 |issue=1 |pages=1–17 |jstor=1831652 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Phelan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecommentator.com/article/1895/milton_friedman_and_the_rise_and_fall_of_the_phillips_curve|title=Milton Friedman and the rise and fall of the Phillips Curve|accessdate=September 29, 2014|publisher=thecommentator.com|last=Phelan|first=John|date=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friedman then correctly predicted that in the [[1973–75 recession]], both [[Stagflation|inflation and unemployment would increase]].&lt;ref name="Phelan"/&gt; The long-run Phillips curve is now seen as a vertical line at the natural rate of unemployment, where the rate of inflation has no effect on unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/PhillipsCurve.html#lfHendersonCEE2-126_figure_036|title=Phillips Curve: The Concise Encyclopedia of Economics - Library of Economics and Liberty|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In recent years{{when?|date=March 2018}} the slope of the Phillips curve appears to have declined and there has been significant questioning of the usefulness of the Phillips curve in predicting inflation.  Nonetheless, the Phillips curve remains the primary framework for understanding and forecasting inflation used in central banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20170926a.htm|title=Speech by Chair Yellen on inflation, uncertainty, and monetary policy|work=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System|access-date=2017-09-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Phillips curve.jpg|Rate of Change of Wages against Unemployment, United Kingdom 1913–1948 from Phillips (1958)|thumb|200px]]
[[William Phillips (economist)|William Phillips]], a [[New Zealand]] born economist, wrote a paper in 1958 titled ''The Relation between Unemployment and the Rate of Change of Money Wage Rates in the United Kingdom, 1861-1957'', which was published in the quarterly journal ''[[Economica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Phillips |first=A. W. |year=1958 |title=The Relationship between Unemployment and the Rate of Change of Money Wages in the United Kingdom 1861-1957 |journal=Economica |volume=25 |issue=100 |pages=283–299 |doi= 10.1111/j.1468-0335.1958.tb00003.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the paper Phillips describes how he observed an inverse relationship between money wage changes and unemployment in the British economy over the period examined. Similar patterns were found in other countries and in 1960 [[Paul Samuelson]] and [[Robert Solow]] took Phillips' work and made explicit the link between inflation and unemployment: when inflation was high, unemployment was low, and vice versa.&lt;ref name="SamuelsonSolow1960" /&gt;

In the 1920s, an American economist [[Irving Fisher]] noted this kind of Phillips curve relationship. However, Phillips' original curve described the behavior of money wages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fisher |first=Irving |year=1973 |title=I discovered the Phillips curve: ‘A statistical relation between unemployment and price changes’ |journal=Journal of Political Economy |volume=81 |issue=2 |pages=496–502 |doi= 10.1086/260048|jstor= 1830534|publisher=The University of Chicago Press }} Reprinted from 1926 edition of ''International Labour Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years following Phillips' 1958 paper, many economists in the advanced industrial countries believed that his results showed that there was a permanently stable relationship between inflation and unemployment.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} One implication of this for government policy was that governments could control unemployment and inflation with a [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] policy. They could tolerate a reasonably high rate of inflation as this would lead to lower unemployment – there would be a [[trade-off]] between inflation and unemployment. For example, [[monetary policy]] and/or [[fiscal policy]] could be used to stimulate the economy, raising [[gross domestic product]] and lowering the unemployment rate. Moving along the Phillips curve, this would lead to a higher inflation rate, the cost of enjoying lower unemployment rates.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Economist [[James Forder]] argues that this view is historically false and that neither economists nor governments took that view and that the 'Phillips curve myth' was an invention of the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Forder"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Forder |first1=James |title=Macroeconomics and the Phillips Curve Myth |date=2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-968365-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U0SZBAAAQBAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1974, seven Nobel Prizes have been given to economists for, among other things, work critical of some variations of the Phillips curve. Some of this criticism is based on the United States' experience during the 1970s, which had periods of high unemployment and high inflation at the same time. The authors receiving those prizes include [[Thomas Sargent]], [[Christopher Sims]], [[Edmund Phelps]], [[Edward Prescott]], [[Robert A. Mundell]], [[Robert E. Lucas]], [[Milton Friedman]], and [[F.A. Hayek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/briandomitrovic/2011/10/10/the-economics-nobel-goes-to-sargent-sims-attackers-of-the-phillips-curve/|title=The Economics Nobel Goes to Sargent &amp; Sims: Attackers of the Phillips Curve|last=Domitrovic|first=Brain|date=10 October 2011|publisher=Forbes.com|accessdate=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stagflation===
In the 1970s, many countries experienced high levels of both inflation and unemployment also known as [[stagflation]]. Theories based on the Phillips curve suggested that this could not happen, and the curve came under a concerted attack from a group of economists headed by [[Milton Friedman]].{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Friedman argued that the Phillips curve relationship was only a short-run phenomenon.  In this he followed eight years after Samuelson and Solow [1960] who wrote "All of our discussion has been phrased in short-run terms, dealing with what might happen in the next few years.  It would be wrong, though, to think that our Figure 2 menu that related obtainable price and unemployment behavior will maintain its same shape in the longer run.  What we do in a policy way during the next few years might cause it to shift in a definite way."&lt;ref name="SamuelsonSolow1960"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Analytical Aspects of Anti-Inflation Policy |first=Paul A. |last=Samuelson |first2=Robert M. |last2=Solow |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=50 |issue=2 |year=1960 |pages=177–194 |jstor=1815021 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Samuelson and Solow had argued 8 years earlier, he argued that in the long run, workers and employers will take inflation into account, resulting in employment contracts that increase pay at rates near anticipated inflation. Unemployment would then begin to rise back to its previous level, but now with higher inflation rates. This result implies that over the longer-run there is no trade-off between inflation and unemployment. This implication is significant for practical reasons because it implies that [[central bank]]s should not set unemployment targets below the natural rate.&lt;ref name=chang/&gt;

More recent research suggests that there is a moderate trade-off between low-levels of inflation and unemployment. Work by [[George Akerlof]], [[William Dickens]], and [[George Perry (American economist)|George Perry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=George A. |last=Akerlof |first2=William T. |last2=Dickens |first3=George L. |last3=Perry |title=Near-Rational Wage and Price Setting and the Long-Run Phillips Curve |journal=Brookings Papers on Economic Activity |volume=2000 |issue=1 |year=2000 |pages=1–60 }}&lt;/ref&gt; implies that if inflation is reduced from two to zero percent, unemployment will be permanently increased by 1.5 percent. This is because workers generally have a higher tolerance for real wage cuts than nominal ones. For example, a worker will more likely accept a wage increase of two percent when inflation is three percent, than a wage cut of one percent when the inflation rate is zero.

===Today===
[[File:U.S. Phillips Curve 2000 to 2013.png|thumb|right|U.S. inflation and unemployment 1/2000 to 8/2014]]
Most economists no longer use the Phillips curve in its original form because it was shown to be too simplistic.&lt;ref name="hossfeld"&gt;Oliver Hossfeld (2010) [http://www.hhl.de/fileadmin/texte/publikationen/forschungspapiere/HOSSFELD_USMONEY_INFERWP_2010-4.pdf "US Money Demand, Monetary Overhang, and Inflation Prediction"] ''International Network for Economic Research'' working paper no. 2010.4&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen in a cursory analysis of US inflation and unemployment data from 1953–92. There is no single curve that will fit the data, but there are three rough aggregations—1955–71, 1974–84, and 1985–92—each of which shows a general, downwards slope, but at three very different levels with the shifts occurring abruptly. The data for 1953–54 and 1972–73 do not group easily, and a more formal analysis posits up to five groups/curves over the period.&lt;ref name=chang/&gt;

But still today, modified forms of the Phillips curve that take inflationary expectations into account remain influential. The theory goes under several names, with some variation in its details, but all modern versions distinguish between short-run and long-run effects on unemployment. Modern Phillips curve models include both a short-run Phillips Curve and a long-run  Phillips Curve. This is because in the short run, there is generally an inverse relationship between inflation and the unemployment rate; as illustrated in the downward sloping short-run Phillips curve. In the long run, that relationship breaks down and the economy eventually returns to the natural rate of unemployment regardless of the inflation rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apeconreview.com/phillips-curve.html|title=AP Macroeconomics Review: Phillips Curve|last=Jacob|first=Reed|date=2016|website=APEconReview.com|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "short-run Phillips curve" is also called the "expectations-augmented Phillips curve", since it shifts up when inflationary expectations rise, [[Edmund Phelps]] and [[Milton Friedman]] argued. In the long run, this implies that monetary policy cannot affect unemployment, which adjusts back to its "[[natural rate of unemployment|natural rate]]", also called the "NAIRU" or "long-run Phillips curve". However, this long-run "[[neutrality of money|neutrality]]" of monetary policy does allow for short run fluctuations and the ability of the monetary authority to temporarily decrease unemployment by increasing permanent inflation, and vice versa. The popular textbook of [[Olivier Blanchard|Blanchard]] gives a textbook presentation of the expectations-augmented Phillips curve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Blanchard |first=Olivier |title=Macroeconomics |publisher=Prentice Hall |edition=Second |year=2000 |isbn=0-13-013306-X |pages=149–55 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dxu3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA149 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An equation like the expectations-augmented Phillips curve also appears in many recent [[New Keynesian economics|New Keynesian]] [[dynamic stochastic general equilibrium]] models. In these [[macroeconomic model]]s with [[sticky (economics)|sticky prices]], there is a positive relation between the rate of inflation and the level of demand, and therefore a negative relation between the rate of inflation and the rate of unemployment. This relationship is often called the "New Keynesian Phillips curve".  Like the expectations-augmented Phillips curve, the New Keynesian Phillips curve implies that increased inflation can lower unemployment temporarily, but cannot lower it permanently. Two influential papers that incorporate a New Keynesian Phillips curve are [[Richard Clarida|Clarida]], [[Jordi Galí|Galí]], and [[Mark Gertler (economist)|Gertler]] (1999),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clarida |first=Richard |author2=Galí, Jordi |author3=Gertler, Mark  |year=1999 |title=The science of monetary policy: a New-Keynesian perspective |journal=Journal of Economic Literature |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=1661–1707 |doi= 10.1257/jel.37.4.1661|jstor= 2565488|publisher=American Economic Association }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Olivier Blanchard|Blanchard]] and [[Jordi Galí|Galí]] (2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Blanchard |first=Olivier |author2=Galí, Jordi |year=2007 |title=Real Wage Rigidities and the New Keynesian Model |journal=Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking |volume=39 |issue=s1 |pages=35–65 |doi=10.1111/j.1538-4616.2007.00015.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematics==
There are at least two different mathematical derivations of the Phillips curve. First, there is the traditional or [[Keynesian]] version. Then, there is the new Classical version associated with [[Robert E. Lucas, Jr.]]

===The traditional Phillips curve===
The original Phillips curve literature was not based on the unaided application of economic theory. Instead, it was based on empirical generalizations. After that, economists tried to develop theories that fit the data.

====Money wage determination====
The traditional Phillips curve story starts with a wage Phillips Curve, of the sort described by Phillips himself. This describes the rate of growth of money wages ('''gW'''). Here and below, the operator '''g''' is the equivalent of "the percentage rate of growth of" the variable that follows.
:&lt;math&gt;gW = gW^{T} - f(U)&lt;/math&gt;
The "money wage rate" ('''W''') is shorthand for total money wage costs per production employee, including benefits and payroll taxes. The focus is on only production workers' money wages, because (as discussed below) these costs are crucial to pricing decisions by the firms.

This equation tells us that the growth of money wages rises with the trend rate of growth of money wages (indicated by the superscript "T") and falls with the unemployment rate ('''U'''). The function '''f'''() is assumed to be monotonically increasing with '''U''' so that the dampening of money-wage increases by unemployment is shown by the negative sign in the equation above.

There are several possible stories behind this equation. A major one is that money wages are set by ''bilateral negotiations'' under partial [[bilateral monopoly]]: as the unemployment rate rises, ''all else constant'' worker bargaining power falls, so that workers are less able to increase their wages in the face of employer resistance.

During the 1970s, this story had to be modified, because (as the late [[Abba Lerner]] had suggested in the 1940s) workers try to keep up with inflation. Since the 1970s, the  equation has been changed to introduce the role of inflationary expectations (or the expected inflation rate, '''gP&lt;sup&gt;ex&lt;/sup&gt;'''). This produces the expectations-augmented wage Phillips curve:

:&lt;math&gt;gW = gW^{T} - f(U) + \lambda.gP^{ex}.&lt;/math&gt;

The introduction of inflationary expectations into the equation implies that actual inflation can ''feed back'' into inflationary expectations and thus cause further inflation. The late economist [[James Tobin]] dubbed the last term "inflationary inertia," because in the current period, inflation exists which represents an inflationary impulse left over from the past.

It also involved much more than expectations, including the price-wage spiral. In this spiral, employers try to protect profits by raising their prices and employees try to keep up with inflation to protect their real wages. This process can feed on itself, becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy.

The parameter '''λ''' (which is presumed constant during any time period) represents the degree to which employees can gain money wage increases to keep up with expected inflation, preventing a fall in expected real wages. It is usually assumed that this parameter equals unity in the long run.

In addition, the function '''f'''() was modified to introduce the idea of the [[non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment]] (NAIRU) or what's sometimes called the "natural" rate of unemployment or the
inflation-threshold unemployment rate:

: [1]  '''gW''' = '''gW&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;''' - '''f'''('''U''' − '''U*''')  +  '''λ'''·'''gP&lt;sup&gt;ex&lt;/sup&gt;'''.

Here, '''U*''' is the NAIRU. As discussed below, if '''U''' &lt; '''U*''', inflation tends to accelerate. Similarly, if '''U''' &gt; '''U*''', inflation tends to slow. It is assumed that '''f'''(0) = 0, so that when '''U''' = '''U*''', the '''f''' term drops out of the equation.

In equation [1], the roles of  '''gW&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;''' and '''gP&lt;sup&gt;ex&lt;/sup&gt;''' seem to be redundant, playing much the same role. However, assuming that '''λ'''  is equal to unity, it can be seen that they are not. If the trend rate of growth of money wages equals zero, then the case where '''U''' equals '''U*''' implies that '''gW''' equals expected inflation. That is, expected real wages are constant.

In any reasonable economy, however, having constant expected real wages could only be consistent with actual real wages that are constant over the long haul.  This does not fit with economic experience in the U.S. or any other major industrial country. Even though real wages have not risen much in recent years, there have been important increases over the decades.

An alternative is to assume that the trend rate of growth of money wages equals the trend rate of growth of average labor productivity ('''Z'''). That is:

: [2]  '''gW&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;''' = '''gZ&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;'''.

Under assumption [2], when '''U''' equals '''U*''' and '''λ''' equals unity, expected real wages would increase with labor productivity. This would be consistent with an economy in which actual real wages increase with labor productivity. Deviations of real-wage trends from those of labor productivity might be explained by reference to other variables in the model.

====Pricing decisions====
Next, there is price behavior. The standard assumption is that markets are ''imperfectly competitive'', where most businesses have some power to set prices. So the model assumes that the average business sets a unit price ('''P''') as a mark-up ('''M''') over the [[unit labor cost]] in production measured at a standard rate of capacity utilization (say, at 90 percent use of plant and equipment) and then adds in the unit materials cost.

The standardization involves later ignoring deviations from the trend in labor productivity. For example, assume that the growth of labor productivity is the same as that in the trend and that current productivity equals its trend value:

: '''gZ''' = '''gZ&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;''' and '''Z''' = '''Z&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;'''.

The markup reflects both the firm's degree of market power and the extent to which overhead costs have to be paid. Put another way, all else equal, '''M''' rises with the firm's power to set prices or with a rise of overhead costs relative to total costs.

So pricing follows this equation:

:'''P''' = '''M''' × ('''unit labor cost''') + '''(unit materials cost)'''

:: = '''M''' × ('''total production employment cost''')/('''quantity of output''') + '''UMC'''.

'''UMC''' is unit raw materials cost (total raw materials costs divided by total output). So the equation can be restated as:

:'''P ''' = ''' M ''' × ('''production employment cost per worker''')/('''output per production employee''') + ''' UMC'''.

This equation can again be stated as:

:'''P''' = '''M'''×('''average money wage''')/('''production labor productivity''') + '''UMC'''

:: = '''M'''×('''W'''/'''Z''') + '''UMC'''.

Now, assume that both the average price/cost mark-up ('''M''') and '''UMC''' are constant. On the other hand, labor productivity grows, as before.  Thus, an equation determining the price inflation rate ('''gP''') is:

: '''gP''' = '''gW''' - '''gZ&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;'''.

====Price====
Then, combined with the wage Phillips curve [equation 1] and the assumption made above about the trend behavior of money wages [equation 2], this price-inflation equation gives us a simple expectations-augmented price Phillips curve:

: '''gP''' = −'''f'''('''U''' − '''U*''') + '''λ'''·'''gP&lt;sup&gt;ex&lt;/sup&gt;'''.

Some assume that we can simply add in '''gUMC''', the rate of growth of '''UMC''', in order to represent the role of supply shocks (of the sort that plagued the U.S. during the 1970s). This produces a standard short-term Phillips curve:

: '''gP''' = −'''f'''('''U''' − '''U*''')  + '''λ'''·'''gP&lt;sup&gt;ex&lt;/sup&gt;''' + '''gUMC'''.

Economist [[Robert J. Gordon]] has called this the "Triangle Model" because it explains short-run inflationary behavior by three factors: demand inflation (due to low unemployment), supply-shock inflation ('''gUMC'''), and inflationary expectations or inertial inflation.

In the ''long run'', it is assumed, inflationary expectations catch up with and equal actual inflation so that '''gP''' = '''gP&lt;sup&gt;ex&lt;/sup&gt;'''. This represents the long-term equilibrium of expectations adjustment. Part of this adjustment may involve the adaptation of expectations to the experience with actual inflation. Another might involve guesses made by people in the economy based on other evidence. (The latter idea gave us the notion of so-called [[rational expectations]].)

Expectational equilibrium gives us the long-term Phillips curve. First,  with '''λ''' less than unity:

:'''gP''' = [1/(1 − '''λ''')]·(−'''f'''('''U''' − '''U*''') + '''gUMC''').

This is nothing but a steeper version of the short-run Phillips curve above. Inflation rises as unemployment falls, while this connection is stronger. That is, a low unemployment rate (less than '''U*''') will be associated with a higher inflation rate in the long run than in the short run. This occurs because the actual higher-inflation situation seen in the short run feeds back to raise inflationary expectations, which in turn raises the inflation rate further. Similarly, at high unemployment rates (greater than '''U*''') lead to low inflation
rates. These in turn encourage lower inflationary expectations, so that inflation itself drops again.

This logic goes further if '''λ''' is equal to unity, i.e., if workers are able to protect their wages ''completely'' from expected inflation, even in the short run. Now, the Triangle Model equation becomes:

:- '''f'''('''U''' − '''U*''') = '''gUMC'''.

If we further assume (as seems reasonable) that there are no long-term supply shocks, this can be simplified to become:

: −'''f'''('''U''' − '''U*''') = 0 which implies that  '''U''' = '''U*'''.

All of the assumptions imply that in the long run, there is only one possible unemployment rate, '''U*''' at any one time. This uniqueness explains why some call this unemployment rate "natural."

To truly understand and criticize the uniqueness of '''U*''', a more sophisticated and realistic model is needed. For example, we might introduce the idea that workers in different sectors push for money wage increases that are similar to those in other sectors. Or we might make the model even more realistic. One important place to look is at the determination of the mark-up, '''M'''.

===New classical version===
The Phillips curve equation can be derived from the (short-run) [[Lucas aggregate supply function]]. The Lucas approach is very different from that the traditional view. Instead of starting with empirical data, he started with a classical economic model following very simple economic principles.

Start with the [[aggregate supply]] function:

:&lt;math&gt;Y = Y_n + a (P-P_e) \, &lt;/math&gt;

where '''''Y''''' is log value of the actual [[output (economics)|output]], '''''Y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''''' is log value of the "natural" level of output, '''''a''''' is a positive constant, '''''P''''' is log value of the actual [[price level]], and '''''P&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''''' is log value of the expected [[price level]]. Lucas assumes that '''Y&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''' has a unique value.

Note that this equation indicates that when expectations of future inflation (or, more correctly, the future price level) are ''totally accurate'', the last term drops out, so that actual output equals the so-called "natural" level of real GDP.  This means that in the Lucas aggregate supply curve, the ''only'' reason why actual real GDP should deviate from potential—and the actual unemployment rate should deviate from the "natural" rate—is because of ''incorrect expectations'' of what is going to happen with prices in the future. (The idea has been expressed first by [[John Maynard Keynes|Keynes]], ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money|General Theory]]'', Chapter 20 section III paragraph 4).

This differs from other views of the Phillips curve, in which the failure to attain the "natural" level of output can be due to the imperfection or incompleteness of markets, the stickiness of prices, and the like. In the non-Lucas view, incorrect expectations can contribute to aggregate demand failure, but they are not the only cause. To the "new Classical" followers of Lucas, markets are presumed to be perfect and always attain equilibrium (given inflationary expectations).

We re-arrange the equation into:

:&lt;math&gt; P = P_e + \frac{Y-Y_n}{a} &lt;/math&gt;

Next we add unexpected exogenous shocks to the world supply '''''v''''':

:&lt;math&gt; P = P_e + \frac{Y-Y_n}{a} + v &lt;/math&gt;

Subtracting last year's price levels '''''P&lt;sub&gt;−1&lt;/sub&gt;''''' will give us inflation rates, because

:&lt;math&gt; P-P_{-1}\ \approx \pi &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; P_e- P_{-1}\ \approx \pi_e &lt;/math&gt;

where '''π''' and '''π&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''' are the [[inflation]] and expected inflation respectively.

There is also a negative relationship between output and unemployment (as expressed by [[Okun's law]]). Therefore, using
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{Y-Y_n}{a} = -b(U-U_n) &lt;/math&gt;
where '''''b''''' is a positive constant, '''''U''''' is unemployment, and '''''U&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''''' is the [[natural rate of unemployment]] or [[NAIRU]], we arrive at the final form of the short-run Phillips curve:

:&lt;math&gt; \pi = \pi_e - b(U-U_n) + v \, &lt;/math&gt;

This equation, plotting inflation rate '''π''' against unemployment '''''U''''' gives the downward-sloping curve in the diagram that characterises the Phillips curve.

===New Keynesian version===
The New Keynesian Phillips curve was originally derived by Roberts in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Roberts |first=John M. |year=1995 |title=New Keynesian Economics and the Phillips Curve |journal=[[Journal of Money, Credit and Banking]] |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=975–984 |jstor=2077783 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and since been used in most state-of-the-art New Keynesian DSGE models like the one of Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clarida |first=Richard |last2=Galí |first2=Jordi |last3=Gertler |first3=Mark |year=2000 |title=Monetary Policy Rules and Macroeconomic Stability: Evidence and Some Theory |journal=[[The Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=115 |issue=1 |pages=147–180 |doi=10.1162/003355300554692 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Romer |first=David |year=2012 |chapter=Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium Models of Fluctuation |title=Advanced Macroeconomics |publisher=McGraw-Hill Irwin |location=New York |pages=312–364 |isbn=978-0-07-351137-5 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=xTovPwAACAAJ&amp;pg=PA312 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\pi_{t} = \beta E_{t}[\pi_{t+1}] + \kappa y_{t}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\kappa = \frac{\alpha[1-(1-\alpha)\beta]\phi}{1-\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;. The current expectations of next period's inflation are incorporated as &lt;math&gt;\beta E_{t}[\pi_{t+1}]&lt;/math&gt;

==NAIRU and rational expectations==
[[File:NAIRU-SR-and-LR.svg|thumb|right|200px|Short-Run Phillips Curve before and after Expansionary Policy, with Long-Run Phillips Curve (NAIRU)]]
In the 1970s, new theories, such as [[rational expectations]] and the [[NAIRU]] (non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment) arose to explain how [[stagflation]] could occur. The latter theory, also known as the "[[natural rate of unemployment]]", distinguished between the "short-term" Phillips curve and the "long-term" one. The short-term Phillips Curve looked like a normal Phillips Curve, but shifted in the long run as expectations changed. In the long run, only a single rate of unemployment (the NAIRU or "natural" rate) was consistent with a stable inflation rate. The long-run Phillips Curve was thus vertical, so there was no trade-off between inflation and unemployment. [[Edmund Phelps]] won the [[Nobel Prize in Economics]] in 2006 in part for this work. However, the expectations argument was in fact very widely understood (albeit not formally) before Phelps' work on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Forder|first1=James|title=The historical place of the 'Friedman-Phelps' expectations critique|journal=European Journal of the History of Economic Thought|date=2010|volume=17|issue=3|pages=493–511|doi=10.1080/09672560903114875}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the diagram, the long-run Phillips curve is the vertical red line. The NAIRU theory says that when unemployment is at the rate defined by this line, inflation will be stable. However, in the short-run policymakers will face an inflation-unemployment rate tradeoff marked by the "Initial Short-Run Phillips Curve" in the graph. Policymakers can therefore reduce the unemployment rate temporarily, moving from point '''A''' to point '''B''' through expansionary policy. However, according to the NAIRU, exploiting this short-run tradeoff will raise inflation expectations, shifting the short-run curve rightward to the "new short-run Phillips curve" and moving the point of equilibrium from '''B''' to '''C'''.  Thus the reduction in unemployment below the "Natural Rate" will be temporary, and lead only to higher inflation in the long run.

Since the short-run curve shifts outward due to the attempt to reduce unemployment, the expansionary policy ultimately worsens the exploitable tradeoff between unemployment and inflation. That is, it results in more inflation at each short-run unemployment rate. The name "NAIRU" arises because with actual unemployment below it, inflation accelerates, while with unemployment above it, inflation decelerates. With the actual rate equal to it, inflation is stable, neither accelerating nor decelerating. One practical use of this model was to provide an explanation for stagflation, which confounded the traditional Phillips curve.

The rational expectations theory said that expectations of inflation were equal to what actually happened, with some minor and temporary errors. This in turn suggested that the short-run period was so short that it was non-existent: any effort to reduce unemployment below the NAIRU, for example, would ''immediately'' cause inflationary expectations to rise and thus imply that the policy would fail. Unemployment would never deviate from the NAIRU except due to random and transitory mistakes in developing expectations about future inflation rates. In this perspective, any deviation of the actual unemployment rate from the NAIRU was an illusion.

However, in the 1990s in the U.S., it became increasingly clear that the NAIRU did not have a unique equilibrium and could change in unpredictable ways. In the late 1990s, the actual [[unemployment]] rate fell below 4% of the labor force, much lower than almost all estimates of the NAIRU. But inflation stayed very moderate rather than accelerating. So, just as the Phillips curve had become a subject of debate, so did the NAIRU.

Furthermore, the concept of [[rational expectations]] had become subject to much doubt when it became clear that the main assumption of models based on it was that there exists a single (unique) [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] in the economy that is set ahead of time, determined independently of demand conditions. The experience of the 1990s suggests that this assumption cannot be sustained.

==Theoretical questions==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2007}}
The Phillips curve started as an empirical observation in search of a theoretical explanation.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} Specifically, the Phillips curve tried to determine whether the inflation-unemployment link was [[Correlation does not imply causation|causal or simply correlational]]. There are several major explanations of the short-term Phillips curve regularity.

To [[Milton Friedman]] there is a short-term correlation between inflation shocks and employment. When an inflationary surprise occurs, workers are fooled into accepting lower pay because they do not see the fall in real wages right away. Firms hire them because they see the inflation as allowing higher profits for given nominal wages. This is a movement along the Phillips curve as with change '''A'''. Eventually, workers discover that real wages have fallen, so they push for higher money wages. This causes the Phillips curve to shift upward and to the right, as with '''B'''. Some research underlines that some implicit and serious assumptions are actually in the background of the Friedmanian Phillips curve. This information asymmetry and a special pattern of flexibility of prices and wages are both necessary if one wants to maintain the mechanism told by Friedman. However, as it is argued, these presumptions remain completely unrevealed and theoretically ungrounded by Friedman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Galbács |first=Peter |title=The Theory of New Classical Macroeconomics. A Positive Critique |location=Heidelberg/New York/Dordrecht/London |publisher=Springer |year=2015 |isbn= 978-3-319-17578-2|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-17578-2|url = https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-319-17578-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economists such as [[Edmund Phelps]] reject this theory because it implies that workers suffer from [[money illusion]]. According to them, rational workers would only react to [[real wages]], that is, inflation adjusted wages. However, one of the characteristics of a modern industrial economy is that workers do not encounter their employers in an atomized and perfect market. They operate in a complex combination of imperfect markets, [[monopoly|monopolies]], [[monopsony|monopsonies]], [[labor unions]], and other institutions. In many cases, they may lack the [[bargaining power]] to ''act on'' their expectations, no matter how rational they are, or their perceptions, no matter how free of money illusion they are. It is not that high inflation ''causes'' low unemployment (as in Milton Friedman's theory) as much as ''vice versa'': Low unemployment raises worker bargaining power, allowing them to successfully push for higher nominal wages. To protect profits, employers raise prices.

Similarly, built-in inflation is not simply a matter of subjective "inflationary expectations" but also reflects the fact that high inflation can gather momentum and continue beyond the time when it was started, due to the objective price/wage spiral.

However, other economists, like Jeffrey Herbener, argue that price is market-determined and competitive firms cannot simply raise prices.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} They reject the Phillips curve entirely, concluding that unemployment's influence is only a small portion of a much larger inflation picture that includes prices of raw materials, intermediate goods, cost of raising capital, worker productivity, land, and other factors.

===Gordon's triangle model===
[[Robert J. Gordon]] of [[Northwestern University]] has analyzed the Phillips curve to produce what he calls the [[Inflation#Keynesian view|triangle model]], in which the actual inflation rate is determined by the sum of

#[[demand pull inflation|demand pull or short-term Phillips curve inflation]],
#[[cost push inflation|cost push or supply shocks]], and
#[[built-in inflation]].

The last reflects inflationary expectations and the [[price/wage spiral]]. Supply shocks and changes in built-in inflation are the main factors shifting the short-run Phillips Curve and changing the trade-off. In this theory, it is not only inflationary expectations that can cause stagflation. For example, the steep climb of oil prices during the 1970s could have this result.

Changes in built-in inflation follow the [[adaptive expectations|partial-adjustment]] logic behind most theories of the NAIRU:

# Low unemployment encourages high inflation, as with the simple Phillips curve. But if unemployment stays low and inflation stays high ''for a long time'', as in the late 1960s in the U.S., both inflationary expectations and the price/wage spiral accelerate. This ''shifts'' the short-run Phillips curve upward and rightward, so that more inflation is seen at any given unemployment rate. (This is with shift '''B''' in the diagram.)
# High unemployment encourages low inflation, again as with a simple Phillips curve. But if unemployment stays high and inflation stays low for a long time, as in the early 1980s in the U.S., both inflationary expectations and the price/wage spiral slow. This ''shifts'' the short-run Phillips curve downward and leftward, so that less inflation is seen at each unemployment rate.

In between these two lies the NAIRU, where the Phillips curve does not have any inherent tendency to shift, so that the inflation rate is stable.  However, there seems to be a range in the middle between "high" and "low" where built-in inflation stays stable. The ends of this "non-accelerating inflation range of unemployment rates" change over time.

==The sport of Xpogo==
'''Extreme Pogo''' or Xpogo is an [[extreme sport|action sport]] which involves riding and performing tricks on extreme [[pogo sticks]], defined as such by their durability and potential for height. Today's Xpogo sticks have the potential for over 10&amp;nbsp;ft. of height (measured from the ground to the bottom of the tip).&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;{{cite web|last=McCluskey|first=Jack|title=Pogo Resurges as Action Sport|url=http://espn.go.com/espn/page2/index?id=5489084|work=ESPN 2|publisher=ESPN 2|accessdate=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Extreme pogo is a young extreme sport and is currently emerging into [[popular culture]] as evidenced by the growing number of Xpogo athletes around the globe, growing sales from extreme pogo companies,&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|last=Sabar|first=Ariel|title=How the Pogo Stick Leapt From Classic Toy to Extreme Sport|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/How-the-Pogo-Stick-Leapt-From-Classic-Toy-to-Extreme-Sport-165593346.html?c=y&amp;page=7|publisher=Smithsonian Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; the popularity of Xpogo athlete exhibition teams,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pogo Dudes Website|url=http://www.thepogodudes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; positive feedback and continued interest in Xpogo content,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pogo GoPro|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxxm87yjzbE|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the expanding scope of the annual Pogopalooza: The Xpogo World Championship Series.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite web|agency=Associated Press|title=HOME  &gt;  AP  &gt;  STRANGE Pogo Athletes Building Brand New Extreme Sport|url=http://www.ktvu.com/videos/ap/strange/pogo-athletes-building-brand-new-extreme-sport/vdcCL/|work=KTVU|publisher=KTVU|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202232137/http://www.ktvu.com/videos/ap/strange/pogo-athletes-building-brand-new-extreme-sport/vdcCL/|archivedate=2013-12-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first Pogopalooza was held in 2004 in a parking lot in [[Nebraska]], organized by [[Dan Brown (blogger)|Dan Brown]], one of the original Xpogo founders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pogo Athletes Building Brand New Extreme Sport|url=http://orangeleader.com/v?vid=ndn-23788117&amp;sid=AP%20Editors%20Picks|publisher=The Orange Leader|accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the event was small in scope and only drew friends and family, it set the precedent to hold an annual event bringing together extreme pogo athletes from around the country, and eventually the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pogopalooza History|url=http://www.xpogo.com/pogopalooza-history/pogopalooza-1/|publisher=Xpogo.com|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each year since Pogopalooza 1, the event grew in scope and design.  Gaining more structure, media attention, athlete attendance, Pogopalooza progressed steadily for 5 years.  Pogopalooza 6 in 2009, which was held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania saw the biggest turnout of athletes yet, over 50+ from across the United States, Canada, and England and involved the whole of the City through four days of events and competition.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;{{cite web|last=Maher|first=Kris|title=Boing!

[[The Wall Street Journal]] ran a front-page article on the sport and numerous other countrywide and even international publications began covering athletes, events, and the growth of Xpogo in general.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt;  Pogopalooza 7, 8, and 9 represented steady progress as well, leading up to Pogopalooza 10, which stood as another breakout year.   Widely attended and heavily covered, Pogopalooza 10 occurred in New York City across July 26-28th, 2013.  After the event, organizers announced that the Pogopalooza competition would be expanded into a multi-city international touring format for 2014.  Today, the event is referred to as "Pogopalooza: The Xpogo World Championship Series" and occurs multiple times throughout the year in cities around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pogopalooza Website|url=http://www.Pogopalooza.com|work=WebPage History|publisher=Xpogo LLC|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Prasrabhi''' (Sanskrit; Tibetan: ཤིན་ཏུ་སྦྱང་བ་, Tibetan Wylie: ''shin tu sbyang ba'', Pali: [[passaddhi]]) is a Mahayana [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] term translated as "pliancy", "flexibility",  or "alertness". It is defined as the ability to apply body and mind towards virtuous activity.&lt;ref name=g1&gt;Guenther (1975), Kindle Locations 623-624.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eric1&gt;Kunsang (2004), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Prasrabhi'' is identified as:
* One of the [[Mental factors (Buddhism)#Eleven virtuous mental factors|eleven virtuous mental factors]] within the Mahayana [[Abhidharma]] teachings. 
* One of the [[eight antidotes]] applied to overcome obstacles in [[Samatha]] meditation within the Mahayana tradition.

The [[Abhidharma-samuccaya]] states: 

:What is alertness? It is the pliability of body and mind in order to interrupt the continuity of the feeling of sluggishness in body and mind. Its function is to do away with all obscurations.&lt;ref name="g1"/&gt;

{{Property law}}

'''Property''', in the [[Abstract and concrete|abstract]], is what belongs to or with something, whether as an attribute or as a component of said thing. In the context of this article, it is one or more components (rather than attributes), whether [[Tangible property|physical]] or [[Intangible property|incorporeal]], of a person's [[Estate (law)|estate]]; or so belonging to, as in being [[Ownership|owned]] by, a person or jointly a group of people or a legal entity like a [[corporation]] or even a [[society]]. Depending on the nature of the property, an owner of property has the right to [[Consumable|consume]], alter, [[Easement|share, redefine]], [[Renting|rent]], [[Mortgage law|mortgage]], [[Collateral (finance)|pawn]], [[Sales|sell]], [[Barter|exchange]], [[Transfer payment|transfer]], [[Gift|give away]] or destroy it, or to exclude others from doing these things,&lt;ref name="businessdict"&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/property.html |title=property definition |work=BusinessDictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="americanheritagedict"&gt;{{citation |title=American Heritage Dictionary |contribution=property |url=http://www.bartleby.com/cgi-bin/texis/webinator/sitesearch?FILTER=col61&amp;query=property&amp;x=0&amp;y=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wordnet"&gt;{{citation |title=WordNet |contribution=property |url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=property&amp;sub=Search+WordNet&amp;o2=&amp;o0=1&amp;o7=&amp;o5=&amp;o1=1&amp;o6=&amp;o4=&amp;o3=&amp;h= |accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to perhaps [[Lost, mislaid, and abandoned property|abandon]] it; whereas regardless of the nature of the property, the owner thereof has the right to properly use it (as a [[Durable good|durable]], [[Fixed investment|mean or factor]], or whatever), or at the very least exclusively keep it.

In economics and political economy, there are three broad forms of property: [[private property]], [[public property]], and [[collective property]] (also called [[cooperative]] property).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century |year=2003 |last=Gregory |first=Paul R. |last2=Stuart |first2=Robert C. |location=Boston |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |isbn=0618261818 |pages=27 |quote=There are three broad forms of property ownership-private, public, and collective (cooperative).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Property that jointly belongs to more than one party may be possessed or controlled thereby in very similar or very distinct ways, whether simply or complexly, whether equally or unequally. However, there is an expectation that each party's will (rather discretion) with regard to the property be clearly defined and unconditional,{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} so as to distinguish ownership and easement from rent. The parties might expect their wills to be [[Unanimity|unanimous]], or alternately every given one of them, when no opportunity for or possibility of dispute with any other of them exists, may expect his, her, its or their own will to be sufficient and absolute.

The [[Restatements of the Law|Restatement]] (First) of Property defines property as anything, tangible or intangible whereby a legal relationship between persons and the state enforces a possessory interest or legal title in that thing. This mediating relationship between individual, property and state is called a property regime.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irma.ac.in/pdf/randp/1175_17402.pdf Pellissery, Sony and Dey Biswas, Sattwick (2012) Emerging Property Regimes In India: What It Holds For the Future of Socio-Economic Rights? IRMA Working Paper 234]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[sociology]] and [[anthropology]], property is often defined as a relationship between two or more individuals and an object, in which at least one of these individuals holds a bundle of rights over the object. The distinction between "collective property" and "private property" is regarded as a confusion since different individuals often hold differing rights over a single object.&lt;ref&gt;[[Graeber]], New York: Palgrave (2001) Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value: The False Coin of Our Own Dreams. {{ISBN|978-0312240448}}  "... one might argue that property is a social relation as well, reified in exactly the same way: when one buys a car one is not really purchasing the right to use it so much as the right to prevent others from using it-or, to be even more precise, one is purchasing their recognition that one has the right to do so. But since it is so diffuse a social relation- a contract, in effect, between the owner and everyone else in the entire world-it is easy to think of it as a thing..." (p. 9)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology, Property in Anthropology, {{cite web |url=http://www.eth.mpg.de/cms/en/research/d2/completed/property/moreinfo/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150116101316/http://www.eth.mpg.de/cms/en/research/d2/completed/property/moreinfo/ |archivedate=2015-01-16 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Important widely recognized types of property include [[realty|real property]] (the combination of land and any improvements to or on the land), [[personal property]] (physical possessions belonging to a person), private property (property owned by legal persons, business entities or individual natural persons), public property (state owned or publicly owned and available possessions) and [[intellectual property]] (exclusive rights over artistic [[Gene theft#Property and Commercialization of Body Tissue|creations, inventions]], etc.), although the last is not always as widely recognized or enforced.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anti-copyright]] advocates and other [[Criticism of intellectual property|critics of intellectual property]] dispute the concept of intellectual property.[http://praxeology.net/anticopyright.htm].&lt;/ref&gt; An article of property may have physical and incorporeal parts. A [[title (property)|title]], or a [[right]] of [[ownership]], establishes the relation between the property and other persons, assuring the owner the right to dispose of the property as the owner sees fit.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

==Overview==

Often property is defined by the code of the local [[sovereignty]], and protected wholly or more usually partially by such entity, the owner being responsible for any remainder of protection. The [[Standard of proof|standards of proof]] concerning proofs of ownerships are also addressed by the code of the local sovereignty, and such entity plays a role accordingly, typically [[Recorder of deeds|somewhat managerial]]. Some philosophers{{who|date=April 2012}} assert that property [[rights]] arise from [[Convention (norm)|social convention]], while others find justifications for them in [[morality]] or in [[natural law]].

Various scholarly disciplines (such as [[law]], [[economics]], [[anthropology]] or [[sociology]]) may treat the concept more systematically, but definitions vary, most particularly when involving [[contract]]s. [[Positive law]] defines such rights, and the [[judiciary]] can adjudicate and enforce property rights.

According to [[Adam Smith]], the expectation of profit from "improving one's stock of capital" rests on private property rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=2004 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=9Kw5vLbYq-4C&amp;pg=PA355&amp;lpg=PA355&amp;dq=Adam+Smith,+the+expectation+of+profit+from+%22improving+one%27s+stock+of+capital%22+rests+on+private+property+rights#v=onepage&amp;q=Adam%20Smith%2C%20the%20expectation%20of%20profit%20from%20%22improving%20one's%20stock%20of%20capital%22%20rests%20on%20private%20property%20rights&amp;f=false |title=Understanding the Global Economy, Howard Richards (p. 355) |publisher=Peace Education Books|isbn=978-0974896106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Capitalism]] has as a central assumption that property rights encourage their holders to develop the property, generate [[wealth]], and efficiently allocate [[factors of production|resources]] based on the operation of markets.  From this has evolved the modern conception of property as a right enforced by positive law, in the expectation that this will produce more wealth and better standards of living. However, Smith also expressed a very critical view on the effects of property laws on inequality:

:: "Wherever there is great property, there is great inequality … Civil government, so far as it is instituted for the security of property, is in reality instituted for the defence of the rich against the poor, or of those who have some property against those who have none at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |accessdate=2011-12-15 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jH5bTCHDYTgC |title=An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (p. 177) |publisher=Hackett Publishing Company|isbn=0872202046 |year=1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Adam Smith]], ''[[Wealth of Nations]]'')

In his text ''The Common Law'', [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] describes property as having two fundamental aspects. The first,  possession, can be defined as control over a resource based on the practical inability of another to contradict the ends of the possessor. The second, title, is the expectation that others will recognize rights to control resource, even when it is not in possession. He elaborates the differences between these two concepts, and proposes a history of how they came to be attached to persons, as opposed to families or to entities such as the church.
* [[Classical liberalism]] subscribes to the [[labor theory of property]]. They hold that individuals each own their own life, it follows that one must own the products of that life, and that those products can be traded in free exchange with others.

:: "Every man has a property in his own person. This nobody has a right to, but himself." ([[John Locke]], ''[[Second Treatise on Civil Government]]'')

:: "The reason why men enter into society is the preservation of their property." ([[John Locke]], ''Second Treatise on Civil Government'')

:: "Life, liberty, and property do not exist because men have made laws. On the contrary, it was the fact that life, liberty, and property existed beforehand that caused men to make laws in the first place." ([[Frédéric Bastiat]], ''[[The Law (1849 book)|The Law]]'')
* [[Conservatism]] subscribes to the concept that freedom and property are closely linked. That the more widespread the possession of private property, the more stable and productive is a state or nation.  Economic leveling of property, conservatives maintain, especially of the forced kind, is not economic progress.

:: "Separate property from private possession, and Leviathan becomes master of all... Upon the foundation of private property, great civilizations are built... The conservative acknowledges that the possession of property fixes certain duties upon the possessor; he accepts those moral and legal obligations cheerfully." ([[Russell Kirk]], ''The Politics of Prudence'')
* [[Socialism]]'s fundamental principles center on a critique of this concept, stating (among other things) that the cost of defending property exceeds the returns from private property ownership, and that, even when property rights encourage their holders to develop their property or generate wealth, they do so only for their own benefit, which may not coincide with benefit to other people or to society at large.
* [[Libertarian socialism]] generally accepts property rights, but with a short abandonment period. In other words, a person must make (more-or-less) continuous use of the item or else lose ownership rights. This is usually referred to as "possession property" or "[[usufruct]]". Thus, in this usufruct system, absentee ownership is illegitimate and workers own the machines or other equipment that they work with.
* [[Communism]] argues that only collective ownership of the [[means of production]] through a [[Body politic|polity]] (though not necessarily a [[State (polity)|state]]) will assure the minimization of unequal or unjust outcomes and the maximization of benefits, and that therefore humans should abolish private ownership of [[capital (economics)|capital]] (as opposed to property).

Both communism and some kinds of socialism have also upheld the notion that private ownership of capital is inherently illegitimate. This argument centers mainly on the idea that private ownership of capital always benefits one [[Social class|class]] over another, giving rise to domination through the use of this privately owned capital. Communists do not oppose personal property that is "hard-won, self-acquired, self-earned" (as the [[Communist Manifesto]] puts it) by members of the [[proletariat]]. Both socialism and communism distinguish carefully between private ownership of capital (land, factories, resources, etc.) and private property (homes, material objects and so forth).

=== Types of property ===
Most [[legal system]]s distinguish between different types of property, especially between land ([[immovable property]], [[estate in land]], [[real estate]], [[real property]]) and all other forms of property—goods and [[Personal property|chattels]], [[movable property]] or [[personal property]], including the [[Face value|value of legal tender]] if not the [[Legal tender|legal tender itself]], as the [[Currency#Control and production|manufacturer]] rather than the possessor might be the owner. They often distinguish [[tangible property|tangible]] and [[intangible property]]. One categorization scheme specifies three species of property: land, improvements (immovable man-made things), and personal property (movable man-made things).{{cn|date=August 2018}}

In [[common law]], [[real property]] ([[immovable property]]) is the combination of [[Rights|interests]] in land and improvements thereto, and [[personal property]] is interest in movable property. Real property rights are rights relating to the land.  These rights include ownership and usage. Owners can grant rights to persons and entities in the form of [[lease]]s, [[license]]s and [[easement]]s.

Throughout the last centuries of the [[2nd millennium|second millennium]], with the development of more complex theories of property, the concept of personal property had become divided{{By whom|date=May 2013}} into tangible property (such as [[Automobile|cars]] and [[clothing]]) and intangible property (such as [[financial instrument]]s, including [[stock]]s and [[Bond (finance)|bonds]]; [[intellectual property]], including [[patent]]s, [[copyright]]s and [[trademark]]s; [[digital file]]s; [[communication channel]]s; and certain forms of [[identifier]], including [[domain name|Internet domain names]], some forms of [[network address]], some forms of [[Call sign|handle]] and again trademarks).

Treatment of intangible property is such that an article of property is, by law or otherwise by traditional conceptualization, subject to expiration even when [[Inheritance|inheritable]], which is a key distinction from tangible property. Upon expiration, the property, if of the intellectual category, becomes a part of [[public domain]], to be used by but not owned by anybody, and possibly used by more than one party simultaneously due the inapplicability of [[scarcity]] to intellectual property. Whereas things such as communications channels and pairs of electromagnetic spectrum band and signal transmission power can only be used by a single party at a time, or a single party in a divisible context, if owned or used at all. Thus far or usually those are not considered property, or at least not private property, even though the party bearing right of exclusive use may transfer that right to another.

==Issues in property theory==

=== What can be property? ===
The two major justifications given for original property, or the [[homestead principle]], are '''effort''' and '''scarcity'''. [[John Locke]] emphasized effort, "mixing your labor"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.constitution.org/jl/2ndtr05.htm |title=John Locke: Second Treatise of Civil Government: Chapter 5 |publisher= |accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an object, or clearing and cultivating virgin land. [[Benjamin Tucker]] preferred to look at the [[Telos (philosophy)|telos]] of property, i.e. What is the purpose of property?  His answer: to solve the scarcity problem.  Only when items are relatively scarce with respect to people's desires do they become property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zetetics.com/mac/libdebates/ch6intpr.html |title=News – WendyMcElroy.com |publisher= |accessdate=14 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706115752/http://www.zetetics.com/mac/libdebates/ch6intpr.html |archivedate=6 July 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, hunter-gatherers did not consider land to be property, since there was no shortage of land.  Agrarian societies later made arable land property, as it was scarce.  For something to be economically scarce it must necessarily have the ''exclusivity property''—that use by one person excludes others from using it.  These two justifications lead to different conclusions on what can be property. [[Intellectual property]]—incorporeal things like ideas, plans, orderings and arrangements (musical compositions, novels, computer programs)—are generally considered valid property to those who support an effort justification, but invalid to those who support a scarcity justification, since the things don't have the exclusivity property (however, those who support a scarcity justification may still support other "intellectual property" laws such as [[Copyright]], as long as these are a subject of [[contract]] instead of government arbitration). Thus even ardent [[propertarian]]s may disagree about IP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://praxeology.net/anticopyright.htm |title=Molinari Institute – Anti-Copyright Resources |publisher= |accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By either standard, one's body is one's property.

From some [[anarchism|anarchist]] points of view, the validity of property depends on whether the "property right" requires enforcement by the state.  Different forms of "property" require different amounts of enforcement: [[intellectual property]] requires a great deal of state intervention to enforce, ownership of distant physical property requires quite a lot, ownership of carried objects requires very little, while ownership of one's own body requires absolutely no state intervention. Some [[anarchism|anarchists]] don't believe in property at all.

Many things have existed that did not have an [[owner]], sometimes called the [[commons]].  The term "commons," however, is also often used to mean something quite different: "general collective ownership"—i.e. [[common ownership]]. Also, the same term is sometimes used by [[Statism|statists]] to mean government-owned property that the general public is allowed to access ([[public property]]).  Law in all societies has tended to develop towards reducing the number of things not having clear owners. Supporters of property rights argue that this enables better protection of scarce resources, due to the [[tragedy of the commons]], while critics argue that it leads to the 'exploitation' of those resources for personal gain and that it hinders taking advantage of potential [[network effects]].  These arguments have differing validity for different types of "property"—things that are not scarce are, for instance, not subject to the [[tragedy of the commons]].  Some apparent critics advocate general collective ownership rather than ownerlessness.

Things that do not have owners include: [[idea]]s (except for [[intellectual property]]), [[seawater]] (which is, however, protected by anti-pollution laws), parts of the [[seafloor]] (see the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] for restrictions), gases in [[Earth's atmosphere]], animals in the wild (although in most nations, animals are tied to the land.  In the United States and Canada wildlife are generally defined in statute as property of the state.  This public ownership of wildlife is referred to as the North American Model of Wildlife Conservation and is based on The Public Trust Doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://joomla.wildlife.org/index.php?id=171&amp;option=com_content&amp;task=view |title=The North American Model of Wildlife Conservation and Public Trust Doctrine |deadurl=yes |accessdate=2012-08-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119010211/http://joomla.wildlife.org/index.php?id=171&amp;option=com_content&amp;task=view |archivedate=2012-01-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;), celestial bodies and outer space, and land in [[Antarctica]].

The nature of children under the [[age of majority]] is another contested issue here.  In ancient societies children were generally considered the property of their parents.  Children in most modern societies theoretically own their own bodies but are not considered competent to exercise their rights, and their parents or [[legal guardian|guardians]] are given most of the actual rights of control over them.

Questions regarding the nature of ownership of the body also come up in the issue of [[abortion]], [[drugs]] and [[euthanasia]].

In many ancient legal systems (e.g. early [[Roman law]]), religious sites (e.g. [[temple]]s) were considered property of the [[God]] or gods they were devoted to. However, [[religious pluralism]] makes it more convenient to have religious sites owned by the [[religious body]] that runs them.

[[Intellectual property]] and air ([[airspace]], [[no-fly zone]], pollution laws, which can include tradable [[emissions trading|emissions rights]]) can be property in some senses of the word.

Ownership of land can be held separately from the ownership of rights over that land, including sporting rights,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.basc.org.uk/media/2001_definition_of_sporting_rights.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227003852/http://www.basc.org.uk/media/2001_definition_of_sporting_rights.pdf |archivedate=2008-02-27 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[mineral rights]], development rights, [[air rights]], and such other rights as may be worth segregating from simple land ownership.

=== Who can be an owner? ===
{{Main article|Ownership}}
Ownership laws may vary widely among countries depending on the nature of the property of interest (e.g. firearms, real property, personal property, animals). Persons can own property directly. In most societies [[Juristic person|legal entities]], such as [[corporations]], [[Trust law|trusts]] and nations (or governments) own property.

In many countries women have limited access to property following restrictive inheritance and family laws, under which only men have actual or formal rights to own property.

In the Inca empire, the dead emperors, who were considered gods, still controlled property after death.&lt;ref&gt;Mckay, John P. , 2004, "A History of World Societes". Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company&lt;/ref&gt;

===Whether and to what extent the state may interfere with property===
Under [[United States]] law the principal limitations on whether and the extent to which the State may interfere with property rights are set by the Constitution. The "Takings" clause requires that the government (whether state or federal—for the 14th Amendment's due process clause imposes the 5th Amendment's takings clause on state governments) may take private property only for a public purpose, after exercising due process of law, and upon making "just compensation." If an interest is not deemed a "property" right or the conduct is merely an intentional tort, these limitations do not apply and the doctrine of [[sovereign immunity]] precludes relief.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, ''[[United States v. Willow River Power Co.]]'' (not a property right because force of law not behind it); ''[[Schillinger v. United States]]'', 155 U.S. 163 (1894) (patent infringement is tort, not taking of property); ''Zoltek Corp. v. United States'', 442 F.3d 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, if the interference does not almost completely make the property valueless, the interference will not be deemed a taking but instead a mere regulation of use.&lt;ref&gt;''Penn Central Transportation Co. v. City of New York'', 438 U.S. 104 (1978).&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, some governmental regulations of property use have been deemed so severe that they have been considered "[[regulatory taking]]s."&lt;ref&gt;See ''United States v. Riverside Bayview Homes'', 474 U.S. 121 (1985).&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, conduct sometimes deemed only a nuisance or other tort has been held a taking of property where the conduct was sufficiently persistent and severe.&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Causby'', 328 U.S. 256 (1946).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theories ==

There exist many theories of property. One is the relatively rare [[first possession theory of property]], where ownership of something is seen as justified simply by someone seizing something before someone else does.&lt;ref&gt;"Property". Graham Oppy. ''The shorter Routledge encyclopedia of philosophy''. Editor [[Edward Craig (philosopher)|Edward Craig]]. Routledge, 2005, p. 858&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps one of the most popular is the [[natural rights]] definition of property rights as advanced by [[John Locke]]. Locke advanced the theory that God granted dominion over nature to man through Adam in the book of Genesis.  Therefore, he theorized that when one mixes one’s labor with nature, one gains a relationship with that part of nature with which the labor is mixed, subject to the limitation that there should be "enough, and as good, left in common for others." (see [[Lockean proviso]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Second Treatise of Civil Government |year=1690 |first=John |last=Locke |url=http://www.constitution.org/jl/2ndtr05.txt |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the RERUM NOVARUM, [[Pope Leo XIII]] wrote "It is surely undeniable that, when a man engages in remunerative labor, the impelling reason and motive of his work is to obtain property, and thereafter to hold it as his very own."

Anthropology studies the diverse systems of ownership, rights of use and transfer, and possession&lt;ref&gt;Hann, Chris ''[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/search/article?title=anthropology&amp;title_type=tka&amp;year_from=1998&amp;year_to=2007&amp;database=1&amp;pageSize=20&amp;index=14 A new double movement? Anthropological perspectives on property in the age of neoliberalism]'' Socio-Economic Review, Volume 5, Number 2, April 2007, pp. 287–318(32)&lt;/ref&gt; under the term "theories of property." Western legal theory is based, as mentioned, on the owner of property being a legal person. However, not all property systems are founded on this basis.

In every culture studied ownership and possession are the subject of custom and regulation, and "law" where the term can meaningfully be applied. Many tribal cultures balance individual ownership with the laws of collective groups: tribes, families, associations and nations. For example, the 1839 Cherokee Constitution frames the issue in these terms:

{{quote|Sec. 2.  The lands of the Cherokee Nation shall remain common property; but the improvements made thereon, and in the possession of the citizens respectively who made, or may rightfully be in possession of them:  Provided, that the citizens of the Nation possessing exclusive and indefeasible right to their improvements, as expressed in this article, shall possess no right or power to dispose of their improvements, in any manner whatever, to the United States, individual States, or to individual citizens thereof; and that, whenever any citizen shall remove with his effects out of the limits of this Nation, and become a citizen of any other government, all his rights and privileges as a citizen of this Nation shall cease:  Provided, nevertheless, That the National Council shall have power to re-admit, by law, to all the rights of citizenship, any such person or persons who may, at any time, desire to return to the Nation, on memorializing the National Council for such readmission.}}

Communal property systems describe ownership as belonging to the entire social and political unit. Such arrangements can under certain conditions erode open access resources. This development has been critiqued by the [[tragedy of the commons]].

Corporate systems describe ownership as being attached to an identifiable group with an identifiable responsible individual. The Roman property law was based on such a corporate system.  In a well-known paper that contributed to the creation of the field of [[law and economics]] in the late 1960s, the American scholar [[Harold Demsetz]] described how the concept of property rights makes social interactions easier:

{{Quote
|text=In the world of [[Robinson Crusoe]] property rights play no role.  Property rights are an instrument of society and derive their significance from the fact that they help a man form those expectations which he can reasonably hold in his dealings with others.  These expectations find expression in the laws, customs, and mores of a society.  An owner of property rights possesses the consent of fellowmen to allow him to act in particular ways.  An owner expects the community to prevent others from interfering with his actions, provided that these actions are not prohibited in the specifications of his rights.
|author=Harold Demsetz (1967)
|source="Toward a Theory of Property Rights", ''The American Economic Review'' '''57''' (2), p. 347.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Merrill &amp; Smith (2017), pp. 238–39.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Different societies may have different theories of property for differing types of ownership. [[Pauline Peters]] argued that property systems are not isolable from the social fabric, and notions of property may not be stated as such, but instead may be framed in negative terms: for example the taboo system among Polynesian peoples.

== Property in philosophy ==
In [[medieval]] and [[Renaissance]] [[Europe]] the term "property" essentially referred to land. After much rethinking, land has come to be regarded as only a special case of the property genus. This rethinking was inspired by at least three broad features of early modern Europe: the surge of commerce, the breakdown of efforts to prohibit [[interest]] (then called "[[usury]]"), and the development of centralized national [[monarchy|monarchies]].

=== Ancient philosophy ===
[[Urukagina]], the king of the [[Sumer]]ian city-state [[Lagash]], established the first laws that forbade compelling the sale of property.&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Noah Kramer]]. ''From the Tablets of Sumer: Twenty-Five Firsts in Man's Recorded History.'' Indian Hills: The Falcon's Wing Press, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ten Commandments]] shown in Exodus 20:2–17 and Deuteronomy 5:6–21 stated that the [[Israelites]] were not to steal, but the connection between Bronze Age concepts of theft and modern concepts of property is suspect.

[[Aristotle]], in ''Politics,'' advocates "private property." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/p/pipes-property.html|title=Property and Freedom|website=www.nytimes.com|access-date=2018-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} He argues that self-interest leads to neglect of the commons. "[T]hat which is common to the greatest number has the least care bestowed upon it. Every one thinks chiefly of his own, hardly at all of the common interest; and only when he is himself concerned as an individual."{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;This bears some similarities to the over-use argument of Garrett Hardin's "[[Tragedy of the Commons]]".&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition he says that when property is common, there are natural problems that arise due to differences in labor: "If they do not share equally enjoyments and toils, those who labor much and get little will necessarily complain of those who labor little and receive or consume much. But indeed there is always a difficulty in men living together and having all human relations in common, but especially in their having common property." ([http://www.cavehill.uwi.edu/bnccde/PH19C/tutorial10.html ''Politics, 1261b34''])

[[Cicero]] held that there is no private property under [[natural law]] but only under [[human law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carlyle |first1=A.J. |title=Property: Its Duties and Rights |date=1913 |publisher=Macmillan |location=London |page=121 |url=https://archive.org/stream/propertyitsdutie00gorerich#page/122/mode/1up |accessdate=4 April 2015}}  citing Cicero, [[De officiis]], i. 7, "Sunt autem privata nulla natura".&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] viewed property as only becoming necessary when men become avarice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carlyle |first1=A.J. |title=Property: Its Duties and Rights |date=1913 |publisher=Macmillan |location=London |page=122 |url=https://archive.org/stream/propertyitsdutie00gorerich#page/122/mode/1up |accessdate=4 April 2015}} citing Seneca, Epistles, xiv, 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[St. Ambrose]] latter adopted this view and [[St. Augustine]] even derided heretics for complaining the Emperor could not confiscate property they had labored for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carlyle |first1=A.J. |title=Property: Its Duties and Rights |date=1913 |publisher=Macmillan |location=London |page=125 |url=https://archive.org/stream/propertyitsdutie00gorerich#page/125/mode/1up |accessdate=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medieval philosophy ===

==== Thomas Aquinas (13th century) ====

* it is natural for man to possess external things
* it is lawful for a man to possess a thing as his own
* the essence of theft consists in taking another's thing secretly
* theft and robbery are sins of different species, and robbery is a more grievous sin than theft
* theft is a sin; it is also a [[mortal sin]]
* it is, however, lawful to steal through stress of need: ''"in cases of need all things are common property."''

===Modern philosophy===

==== Thomas Hobbes (17th century) ====
The principal writings of [[Thomas Hobbes]] appeared between 1640 and 1651—during and immediately following [[First English Civil War|the war between forces]] loyal to King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and those loyal to [[Parliament]]. In his own words, Hobbes' reflection began with the idea of "giving to every man his own," a phrase he drew from the writings of [[Cicero]]. But he wondered: How can anybody call anything his own? He concluded: My own can only truly be mine if there is one unambiguously strongest power in the realm, and that power treats it as mine, protecting its status as such.&lt;ref&gt;"The Origin of Property". Anti Essays. 27 May 2012, &lt;http://www.antiessays.com/free-essays/226947.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==== James Harrington (17th century) ====

A contemporary of Hobbes, [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], reacted to the same tumult in a different way: he considered property natural but not inevitable. The author of ''[[Oceana (book)|Oceana]]'', he may have been the first political theorist to postulate that political power is a consequence, not the cause, of the distribution of property. He said that the worst possible situation is one in which the commoners have half a nation's property, with crown and nobility holding the other half—a circumstance fraught with instability and violence. A much better situation (a stable republic) will exist once the commoners own most property, he suggested.

In later years, the ranks of Harrington's admirers included American revolutionary and founder [[John Adams]].

==== Robert Filmer (17th century) ====

Another member of the Hobbes/Harrington generation, Sir [[Robert Filmer]], reached conclusions much like Hobbes', but through [[Biblical]] [[exegesis]]. Filmer said that the institution of kingship is analogous to that of fatherhood, that subjects are but children, whether obedient or unruly, and that property rights are akin to the household goods that a father may dole out among his children—his to take back and dispose of according to his pleasure.

==== John Locke (17th century) ====

In the following generation, [[John Locke]] sought to answer Filmer, creating a rationale for a balanced [[constitution]] in which the monarch had a part to play, but not an overwhelming part. Since Filmer's views essentially require that the [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] family be uniquely descended from the [[patriarchs]] of the [[Bible]], and since even in the late 17th century that was a difficult view to uphold, Locke attacked Filmer's views in his [[Two Treatises of Government#First Treatise|First Treatise on Government]], freeing him to set out his own views in the [[Second Treatise on Civil Government]]. Therein, Locke imagined a pre-social world, each of the unhappy residents of which are willing to create a [[social contract]] because otherwise "the enjoyment of the property he has in this state is very unsafe, very unsecure," and therefore the "great and chief end, therefore, of men's uniting into commonwealths, and putting themselves under government, is the preservation of their property."&lt;ref&gt;John Locke, ''The Second Treatise of Civil Government'' (1690), Chap. IX, §§&amp;nbsp;123–124.&lt;/ref&gt; They would, he allowed, create a [[monarchy]], but its task would be to execute the will of an elected legislature. "To this end" (to achieve the previously specified goal), he wrote, "it is that men give up all their natural power to the society they enter into, and the community put the [[legislative power]] into such hands as they think fit, with this trust, that they shall be governed by declared laws, or else their peace, quiet, and property will still be at the same uncertainty as it was in the [[state of nature]]."&lt;ref&gt;John Locke, ''The Second Treatise of Civil Government'' (1690), Chap. XI, §&amp;nbsp;136.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when it keeps to proper legislative form, though, Locke held that there are limits to what a government established by such a contract might rightly do.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"It cannot be supposed that [the hypothetical contractors] they should intend, had they a power so to do, to give any one or more an absolute arbitrary power over their persons and estates, and put a force into the magistrate's hand to execute his unlimited will arbitrarily upon them; this were to put themselves into a worse condition than the state of nature, wherein they had a liberty to defend their right against the injuries of others, and were upon equal terms of force to maintain it, whether invaded by a single man or many in combination. Whereas by supposing they have given up themselves to the absolute arbitrary power and will of a legislator, they have disarmed themselves, and armed him to make a prey of them when he pleases..."&lt;ref&gt;John Locke, ''The Second Treatise of Civil Government'' (1690), Chap. XI, §&amp;nbsp;137.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Note that both "persons ''and'' estates" are to be protected from the arbitrary power of any magistrate, inclusive of the "power and will of a legislator." In Lockean terms, depredations against an estate are just as plausible a justification for resistance and revolution as are those against persons. In neither case are subjects required to allow themselves to become prey.

To explain the ownership of property Locke advanced a [[labor theory of property]].

==== David Hume (18th century) ====

In contrast to the figures discussed in this section thus far [[David Hume]] lived a relatively quiet life that had settled down to a relatively stable social and political structure. He lived the life of a solitary writer until 1763 when, at 52 years of age, he went off to [[Paris]] to work at the British embassy.

In contrast, one might think, to his polemical works on [[religion]] and his [[empiricism]]-driven [[philosophical skepticism|skeptical]] [[epistemology]], Hume's views on law and property were quite conservative.

He did not believe in hypothetical contracts, or in the love of mankind in general, and sought to ground politics upon actual human beings as one knows them. "In general," he wrote, "it may be affirmed that there is no such passion in human mind, as the love of mankind, merely as such, independent of personal qualities, or services, or of relation to ourselves." Existing customs should not lightly be disregarded, because they have come to be what they are as a result of human nature. With this endorsement of custom comes an endorsement of existing governments, because he conceived of the two as complementary: "A regard for [[liberty]], though a laudable passion, ought commonly to be subordinate to a reverence for established [[government]]."

Therefore, Hume's view was that there are property rights because of and to the extent that the existing law, supported by social customs, secure them.&lt;ref&gt;This view is reflected in the opinion of the [[United States Supreme Court]] in ''[[United States v. Willow River Power Co.]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; He offered some practical home-spun advice on the general subject, though, as when he referred to [[avarice]] as "the spur of [[industry]]," and expressed concern about excessive levels of taxation, which "destroy industry, by engendering despair."

====Adam Smith====
{{quote|"Civil government, so far as it is instituted for the security of property, is, in reality, instituted for the defense of the rich against the poor, or of those who have property against those who have none at all."| [[Adam Smith]], ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', 1776&lt;ref&gt;''[[An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations]]'', by [[Adam Smith]], Cooke &amp; Hale, 1818, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;}}

"The property which every man has in his own labour, as it is the original foundation of all other property, so it is the most sacred and inviolable. The patrimony of a poor man lies in the strength and dexterity of his hands; and to hinder him from employing this strength and dexterity in what manner he thinks proper without injury to his neighbour, is a plain violation of this most sacred property. It is a manifest encroachment upon the just liberty both of the workman, and of those who might be disposed to employ him. As it hinders the one from working at what he thinks proper, so it hinders the others from employing whom they think proper. To judge whether he is fit to be employed, may surely be trusted to the discretion of the employers whose interest it so much concerns. The affected anxiety of the law-giver lest they should employ an improper person, is evidently as impertinent as it is oppressive."
— (Source: [[Adam Smith]], ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', 1776, Book I, Chapter X, Part II.)

By the mid 19th century, the industrial revolution had transformed England and the United States, and had begun in France. The established conception of what constitutes property expanded beyond land to encompass scarce goods in general. In France, the revolution of the 1790s had led to large-scale confiscation of land formerly owned by church and king. The restoration of the monarchy led to claims by those dispossessed to have their former lands returned.

====Karl Marx====

Section VIII, "[[Primitive accumulation of capital|Primitive Accumulation]]" of Capital involves a critique of Liberal Theories of property rights. Marx notes that under Feudal Law, peasants were legally as entitled to their land as the aristocracy was to its manors. Marx cites several historical events in which large numbers of the peasantry were removed from their lands, which were then seized by the aristocracy. This seized land was then used for commercial ventures (sheep heading). Marx sees this "Primitive Accumulation as integral to the creation of English Capitalism. This event created a large unlanded class which had to work for wages in order to survive. Marx asserts that Liberal theories of property are "idyllic" fairy tales that hide a violent historical process.

==== Charles Comte – legitimate origin of property ====

[[Charles Comte]], in ''Traité de la propriété'' (1834), attempted to justify the legitimacy of private property in response to the [[Bourbon Dynasty, Restored|Bourbon Restoration]]. According to David Hart, Comte had three main points: "firstly, that interference by the state over the centuries in property ownership has had dire consequences for justice as well as for economic productivity; secondly, that property is legitimate when it emerges in such a way as not to harm anyone; and thirdly, that historically some, but by no means all, property which has evolved has done so legitimately, with the implication that the present distribution of property is a complex mixture of legitimately and illegitimately held titles."&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepage.mac.com/dmhart/ComteDunoyer/Ch6.html#RTFToC4 ''The Radical Liberalism of Charles Comte and Charles Dunoyer''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060130070015/http://homepage.mac.com/dmhart/ComteDunoyer/Ch6.html |date=2006-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comte, as Proudhon later did, rejected [[Roman law|Roman legal tradition]] with its toleration of slavery. He posited a communal "national" property consisting of non-scarce goods, such as land in ancient hunter-gatherer societies. Since agriculture was so much more efficient than hunting and gathering, private property appropriated by someone for farming left remaining hunter-gatherers with more land per person, and hence did not harm them. Thus this type of land appropriation did not violate the [[Lockean proviso]] – there was "still enough, and as good left." Comte's analysis would be used by later theorists in response to the socialist critique on property.

==== Pierre Proudhon – property is theft ====
{{Main article|What is Property?|Property is theft!}}

In his 1840 treatise ''[[What is Property?]]'', [[Pierre Proudhon]] answers with "[[Property is theft!]]" In natural resources, he sees two types of property, ''de jure'' property (legal title) and ''de facto'' property (physical possession), and argues that the former is illegitimate.  Proudhon's conclusion is that "property, to be just and possible, must necessarily have equality for its condition."

His analysis of the product of labor upon natural resources as property (usufruct) is more nuanced. He asserts that land itself cannot be property, yet it should be held by individual possessors as stewards of mankind with the product of labor being the property of the producer. Proudhon reasoned that any wealth gained without labor was stolen from those who labored to create that wealth. Even a voluntary contract to surrender the product of labor to an employer was theft, according to Proudhon, since the controller of natural resources had no moral right to charge others for the use of that which he did not labor to create and therefore did not own.

Proudhon's theory of property greatly influenced the budding socialist movement, inspiring anarchist theorists such as [[Mikhail Bakunin]] who modified Proudhon's ideas, as well as antagonizing theorists like [[Karl Marx]].

==== Frédéric Bastiat – property is value ====

[[Frédéric Bastiat]]'s main treatise on property can be found in chapter 8 of his book ''Economic Harmonies'' (1850).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Bastiat: Economic Harmonies |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a radical departure from traditional property theory, he defines property not as a physical object, but rather as a relationship between people with respect to an object. Thus, saying one owns a glass of water is merely verbal shorthand for ''I may justly gift or trade this water to another person''. In essence, what one owns is not the object but the value of the object.  By "value," Bastiat apparently means ''market value''; he emphasizes that this is quite different from utility. ''"In our relations with one another, we are not owners of the utility of things, but of their value, and value is the appraisal made of reciprocal services."''

Bastiat theorized that, as a result of technological progress and the division of labor, the stock of communal wealth increases over time; that the hours of work an unskilled laborer expends to buy e.g. 100 liters of wheat decreases over time, thus amounting to "gratis" satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php?title=79&amp;chapter=35530&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27 |title=Economic Harmonies (Boyers trans.) – Online Library of Liberty |publisher= |accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, private property continually destroys itself, becoming transformed into communal wealth. The increasing proportion of communal wealth to private property results in a tendency toward equality of mankind. ''"Since the human race started from the point of greatest poverty, that is, from the point where there were the most obstacles to be overcome, it is clear that all that has been gained from one era to the next has been due to the spirit of property."''

This transformation of private property into the communal domain, Bastiat points out, does not imply that private property will ever totally disappear. This is because man, as he progresses, continually invents new and more sophisticated needs and desires.

==== Andrew J. Galambos – a precise definition of property ====

[[Andrew Joseph Galambos|Andrew J. Galambos]] (1924–1997) was an astrophysicist and philosopher who innovated a social structure that seeks to maximize human peace and freedom. Galambos’ concept of property was basic to his philosophy. He defined property as a man’s life and all non-procreative derivatives of his life. (Because the English language is deficient in omitting the feminine from “man” when referring to humankind, it is implicit and obligatory that the feminine is included in the term “man”.)

Galambos taught that property is essential to a non-coercive social structure. That is why he defined freedom as follows: “Freedom is the societal condition that exists when every individual has full (100%) control over his own property.”&lt;ref&gt;Galambos, Andrew (1999). Sic Itur Ad Astra. San Diego, California: The Universal Scientific Publications Company, Inc. pp. 868–869. {{ISBN|0880780045}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Galambos defines property as having the following elements:
* '''Primordial property''', which is an individual’s life
* '''Primary property''', which includes ideas, thoughts, and actions
* '''Secondary property''', which includes all tangible and intangible possessions which are derivatives of the individual's primary property.

Property includes all non-procreative derivatives of an individual’s life; this means children are not the property of their parents.&lt;ref&gt;Galambos, Andrew (1999). Sic Itur Ad Astra. San Diego, California: The Universal Scientific Publications Company, Inc. p. 23. {{ISBN|0880780045}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and "primary property" (a person's own ideas).&lt;ref&gt;Galambos, Andrew (1999). Sic Itur Ad Astra. San Diego, California: The Universal Scientific Publications Company, Inc. pp. 39, 52, 84, 92–93, 153, 201, 326. {{ISBN|0880780045}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Galambos emphasized repeatedly that true government exists to protect property and that the state attacks property.
For example, the state requires payment for its services in the form of taxes whether or not people desire such services. Since an individual’s money is his property, the confiscation of money in the form of taxes is an attack on property. Military conscription is likewise an attack on a person’s primordial property.

===Contemporary views===

Contemporary political thinkers who believe that natural persons enjoy rights to own property and to enter into contracts espouse two views about John Locke. On the one hand, some admire Locke, such as [[William Harold Hutt|W.H. Hutt]] (1956), who praised Locke for laying down the "quintessence of individualism". On the other hand, those such as [[Richard Pipes]] regard Locke's arguments as weak, and think that undue reliance thereon has weakened the cause of individualism in recent times. Pipes has written that Locke's work "marked a regression because it rested on the concept of [[Natural Law]]" rather than upon Harrington's sociological framework.

[[Hernando de Soto (economist)|Hernando de Soto]] has argued that an important characteristic of capitalist market economy is the functioning state protection of property rights in a formal [[property system]] which clearly records ownership and transactions. These property rights and the whole formal system of property make possible:
* Greater independence for individuals from local community arrangements to protect their assets
* Clear, provable, and protectable ownership
* The standardization and integration of property rules and property information in a country as a whole
* Increased trust arising from a greater certainty of punishment for cheating in economic transactions
* More formal and complex written statements of ownership that permit the easier assumption of shared risk and ownership in companies, and insurance against risk
* Greater availability of [https://indianmoney.com/loan-against-property loans] for new projects, since more things can serve as collateral for the loans
* Easier access to and more reliable information regarding such things as credit history and the worth of assets
* Increased [[fungibility]], standardization and transferability of statements documenting the ownership of property, which paves the way for structures such as national markets for companies and the easy transportation of property through complex networks of individuals and other entities
* Greater protection of biodiversity due to minimizing of [[shifting agriculture]] practices

All of the above, according to de Soto, enhance [[economic growth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2001/03/desoto.htm |title=Finance &amp; Development, March 2001 – The Mystery of Capital |work=Finance and Development – F&amp;D |accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EEG cap.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Electroencephalography|EEG]] technology has been used for meditation research]]

For the purpose of this article, '''research on [[meditation]]''' concerns research into the psychological and physiological effects of [[meditation]] using the [[scientific method]]. In recent years, these studies have increasingly involved the use of modern scientific techniques and instruments, such as fMRI and EEG which are able to directly observe brain physiology and neural activity in living subjects, either during the act of meditation itself, or before and after a meditation effort, thus allowing linkages to be established between meditative practice and changes in brain structure or function.

Since the 1950s hundreds of studies on [[meditation]] have been conducted, but many of the early studies were flawed and thus yielded unreliable results.&lt;ref name="State of the Research"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ospina MB, Bond K, Karkhaneh M, Tjosvold L, Vandermeer B, Liang Y, Bialy L, Hooton N, Buscemi N, Dryden DM, Klassen TP | title = Meditation practices for health: state of the research | journal = Evidence Report/Technology Assessment | volume =  | issue = 155 | pages = 1–263 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17764203 | pmc = 4780968 | url = http://www.ahrq.gov/downloads/pub/evidence/pdf/meditation/medit.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090225175425/http://www.ahrq.gov/downloads/pub/evidence/pdf/meditation/medit.pdf | df = dmy-all | deadurl = yes | archive-date = 25 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Antoine |last1=Lutz |first2=John D. |last2=Dunne |first3=Richard J. |last3=Davidson | name-list-format = vanc |year=2007 |chapter=Meditation and the Neuroscience of Consciousness: An Introduction |pages=499–552 |editor1-first=Philip David |editor1-last=Zelazo |editor2-first=Morris |editor2-last=Moscovitch |editor3-first=Evan |editor3-last=Thompson |title=The Cambridge Handbook of Consciousness |series=Cambridge Handbooks in Psychology |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-511-81678-9 |doi=10.1017/CBO9780511816789.020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary studies have attempted to address many of these flaws with the hope of guiding current research into a more fruitful path.&lt;ref name="NCCIH 2008"/&gt; In 2013, researchers at Johns Hopkins, publishing in the [[JAMA (journal)|Journal of the American Medical Association]], identified 47 studies that qualify as well-designed and therefore reliable.

==Weaknesses in historic meditation and mindfulness research==
[[File:Meditation&amp;BP.jpg|thumb|300px|A comparison of the effect of various meditation techniques on systolic [[blood pressure]].&lt;ref name="State of the Research"/&gt;]]

In June, 2007 the United States [[National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health]] (NCCIH) published an independent, peer-reviewed, meta-analysis of the state of meditation research, conducted by researchers at the [[University of Alberta]] Evidence-based Practice Center. The report reviewed 813 studies involving five broad categories of meditation: [[mantra]] meditation, [[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|mindfulness meditation]], [[yoga]], [[T'ai chi ch'uan|T'ai chi]], and [[Qigong]], and included all studies on adults through September 2005, with a particular focus on research pertaining to [[hypertension]], [[cardiovascular disease]], and [[substance abuse]]. The report concluded, "''Scientific research on meditation practices does not appear to have a common theoretical perspective and is characterized by poor methodological quality. Firm conclusions on the effects of meditation practices in healthcare cannot be drawn based on the available evidence. Future research on meditation practices must be more rigorous in the design and execution of studies and in the analysis and reporting of results.''" (p.&amp;nbsp;6) It noted that there is no theoretical explanation of health effects from meditation common to all meditation techniques.&lt;ref name="State of the Research" /&gt;

A version of this report subsequently published in the ''Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine'' stated that "''Most clinical trials on meditation practices are generally characterized by poor methodological quality with significant threats to [[Validity (logic)|validity]] in every major quality domain assessed''". This was the conclusion despite a [[statistically significant]] increase in quality of all reviewed meditation research, in general, over time between 1956 and 2005. Of the 400 clinical studies, 10% were found to be good quality. A call was made for rigorous study of meditation.&lt;ref name="NCCIH 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ospina MB, Bond K, Karkhaneh M, Buscemi N, Dryden DM, Barnes V, Carlson LE, Dusek JA, Shannahoff-Khalsa D | title = Clinical trials of meditation practices in health care: characteristics and quality | journal = Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine | volume = 14 | issue = 10 | pages = 1199–213 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 19123875 | doi = 10.1089/acm.2008.0307 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These authors also noted that this finding is not unique to the area of meditation research and that the quality of reporting is a frequent problem in other areas of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) research and related therapy research domains.

Of more than 3,000 scientific studies that were found in a comprehensive search of 17 relevant databases, only about 4% had randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which are designed to exclude the placebo effect.&lt;ref name="State of the Research"/&gt;

A 2013 statement from the [[American Heart Association]] evaluated the evidence for the effectiveness of TM as a treatment for hypertension as "unknown/unclear/uncertain or not well-established", and stated: "''Because of many negative studies or mixed results and a paucity of available trials...&amp;nbsp;other meditation techniques are not recommended in clinical practice to lower BP at this time.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brook RD, Appel LJ, Rubenfire M, Ogedegbe G, Bisognano JD, Elliott WJ, Fuchs FD, Hughes JW, Lackland DT, Staffileno BA, Townsend RR, Rajagopalan S | title = Beyond medications and diet: alternative approaches to lowering blood pressure: a scientific statement from the american heart association | journal = Hypertension | volume = 61 | issue = 6 | pages = 1360–83 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23608661 | doi = 10.1161/HYP.0b013e318293645f }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mindfulness scales===
In the relatively new field of western psychological mindfulness, researchers attempt to define and measure the results of mindfulness primarily through controlled, randomised studies of mindfulness intervention on various dependent variables. The participants in mindfulness interventions measure many of the outcomes of such interventions subjectively. For this reason, several mindfulness inventories or scales (a set of questions posed to a subject whose answers output the subject's aggregate answers in the form of a rating or category) have arisen. Twelve such methods are mentioned by the Mindfulness Research Guide&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mindfulness Research Guide |url=http://www.mindfulexperience.org/measurement.php |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503100616/http://www.mindfulexperience.org/measurement.php |archive-date=3 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brain mechanisms===
In 2011, [[National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health]] (NCCIH) released findings from a study in which [[magnetic resonance image]]s were taken of the brains of 16 participants 2 weeks before and after the participants joined the mindfulness meditation (MM) program by researchers from [[Massachusetts General Hospital]], Bender Institute of Neuroimaging in Germany, and the [[University of Massachusetts Medical School]]. Researchers concluded that {{quote|..these findings may represent an underlying brain mechanism associated with mindfulness-based improvements in mental health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Research Spotlight: Mindfulness Meditation Is Associated With Structural Changes in the Brain |url=http://nccih.nih.gov/research/results/spotlight/012311.htm |date= January 30, 2011 |publisher=[[NCCIH]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The [[analgesic]] effect of MM involves multiple brain mechanisms including the activation of the [[anterior cingulate cortex]] and the [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zeidan F, Grant JA, Brown CA, McHaffie JG, Coghill RC | title = Mindfulness meditation-related pain relief: evidence for unique brain mechanisms in the regulation of pain | journal = Neuroscience Letters | volume = 520 | issue = 2 | pages = 165–73 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22487846 | pmc = 3580050 | doi = 10.1016/j.neulet.2012.03.082 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, brief periods of MM training increases the amount of grey matter in the [[hippocampus]] and [[parietal lobe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jensen MP, Day MA, Miró J | title = Neuromodulatory treatments for chronic pain: efficacy and mechanisms | journal = Nature Reviews.

(Cohen's d = 0.46) However the results should be interpreted with caution because [[funnel plot]]s indicate that publication bias is an issue in meditation research.&lt;ref name="Fox_2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fox KC, Nijeboer S, Dixon ML, Floman JL, Ellamil M, Rumak SP, Sedlmeier P, Christoff K | title = Is meditation associated with altered brain structure?

A follow up by Fox et al. (2016) using 78 functional neuro-imaging studies suggests that different meditation styles are reliably associated with different brain activity. Activations in some brain regions are usually accompanied by deactivation in others. This finding suggests that meditation research must put emphasis on comparing practices from the same style of meditation, for example results from studies investigating focused attention methods cannot be compared to results from open monitoring approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fox KC, Dixon ML, Nijeboer S, Girn M, Floman JL, Lifshitz M, Ellamil M, Sedlmeier P, Christoff K | title = Functional neuroanatomy of meditation: A review and meta-analysis of 78 functional neuroimaging investigations | journal = Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews | volume = 65 | pages = 208–28 | date = June 2016 | pmid = 27032724 | doi = 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2016.03.021 | arxiv = 1603.06342 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attention and mindfulness===

====Attention networks and mindfulness meditation====
Psychological and Buddhist conceptualisations of mindfulness both highlight awareness and attention training as key components, in which levels of mindfulness can be cultivated with practise of mindfulness meditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kabat-Zinn J | year = 2003 | title = Mindfulness‐based interventions in context: past, present, and future | url = | journal = Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice | volume = 10 | issue = 2| pages = 144–156 | doi=10.1093/clipsy/bpg016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Focused attention meditation and open monitoring meditation are distinct types of mindfulness meditation, and the former relates to directing and maintaining attention on a chosen object (e.g. the breath).&lt;ref name="Lutz2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lutz A, Slagter HA, Dunne JD, Davidson RJ | title = Attention regulation and monitoring in meditation | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | pages = 163–9 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18329323 | pmc = 2693206 | doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2008.01.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Open monitoring meditation does not involve focus on a specific object, and instead awareness is grounded in the perceptual features of one’s environment.

Focused attention meditation is typically practiced first to increase the ability to enhance attentional stability, and awareness of mental states with the goal being to transition to open monitoring meditation practise that emphasizes the ability to monitor moment-by-moment changes in experience, without a focus of attention to maintain. Mindfulness meditation may lead to greater [[cognitive flexibility]] &lt;ref name="Moore&amp;Malinowski2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moore A, Malinowski P | title = Meditation, mindfulness and cognitive flexibility | journal = Consciousness and Cognition | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 176–86 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19181542 | doi = 10.1016/j.concog.2008.12.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Evidence for improvements in three areas of attention====
''Sustained attention''
* Tasks of sustained attention relate to vigilance and the preparedness that aids completing a particular task goal. Psychological research into the relationship between mindfulness meditation and the sustained attention network have revealed the following:
* Mindfulness meditators have demonstrated superior performance when the stimulus to be detected in a task was unexpected, relative to when it was expected. This suggests that attention resources were more readily available in order to perform well in the task. This was despite not receiving a visual cue to aid performance. (Valentine &amp; Sweet, 1999).
* In a [[Continuous performance task]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =Schmertz SK, Anderson PL, Robins DL | year = 2009 | title = The relation between self-report mindfulness and performance on tasks of sustained attention | url = | journal = Journal of Psychopathology and Behavioral Assessment | volume = 31 | issue = 1| pages = 60–66 | doi=10.1007/s10862-008-9086-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; an association was found between higher dispositional mindfulness and more stable maintenance of sustained attention.
* In an EEG study,&lt;ref&gt;[[Electroencephalography]]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Attentional blink]] effect was reduced, and [[P3b]] ERP amplitude decreased in a group of participants that completed a mindfulness retreat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Slagter HA, Lutz A, Greischar LL, Francis AD, Nieuwenhuis S, Davis JM, Davidson RJ | title = Mental training affects distribution of limited brain resources | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 5 | issue = 6 | pages = e138 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17488185 | pmc = 1865565 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0050138 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The incidence of reduced attentional blink effect relates to an increase in detectability of a second target. This may have been due to a greater ability to allocate attentional resources for detecting the second target, reflected in a reduced P3b amplitude.
* A greater degree of attentional resources may also be reflected in faster response times in task performance, as was found for participants with higher levels of mindfulness experience.&lt;ref name="Jha2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jha AP, Krompinger J, Baime MJ | title = Mindfulness training modifies subsystems of attention | journal = Cognitive, Affective &amp; Behavioral Neuroscience | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 109–19 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17672382 | doi = 10.3758/cabn.7.2.109 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Selective attention''
* Selective attention as linked with the orientation network, is involved in selecting the relevant stimuli to attend to.
* Performance in the ability to limit attention to potentially sensory inputs (i.e. selective attention) was found to be higher following the completion of an 8-week MBSR course, compared to a one-month retreat and control group (with no mindfulness training).&lt;ref name="Jha2007" /&gt; The ANT task is a general applicable task designed to test the three attention networks, in which participants are required to determine the direction of a central arrow on a computer screen.&lt;ref name="Fan, J. 2002"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fan J, McCandliss BD, Sommer T, Raz A, Posner MI | title = Testing the efficiency and independence of attentional networks | journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 340–7 | date = April 2002 | pmid = 11970796 | doi = 10.1162/089892902317361886 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.590.8796 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Efficiency in orienting that represent the capacity to selectively attend to stimuli was calculated by examining changes in the reaction time that accompanied cues indicating where the target occurred relative to the aid of no cues.
* Meditation experience was found to correlate negatively with reaction times on an [[Eriksen flanker task]] measuring responses to global and local figures. Similar findings have been observed for correlations between mindfulness experience in an orienting score of response times taken from Attention Network Task performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van den Hurk PA, Giommi F, Gielen SC, Speckens AE, Barendregt HP | title = Greater efficiency in attentional processing related to mindfulness meditation | journal = Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 63 | issue = 6 | pages = 1168–80 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20509209 | doi = 10.1080/17470210903249365 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Executive control attention''
* Executive control attention include functions of inhibiting the conscious processing of distracting information. In the context of mindful meditation, distracting information relates to attention grabbing mental events such as thoughts related to the future or past.&lt;ref name="Lutz2008" /&gt;
* More than one study have reported findings of a reduced [[Stroop effect]] following mindfulness meditation training.&lt;ref name="Moore&amp;Malinowski2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tang2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chan D, Woollacott M | title = Effects of level of meditation experience on attentional focus: is the efficiency of executive or orientation networks improved? | journal = Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = 651–7 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17718648 | doi = 10.1089/acm.2007.7022 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stroop effect]] indexes interference created by having words printed in colour that differ to the read semantic meaning e.g. green printed in red. However findings for this task are not consistently found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Anderson ND, Lau MA, Segal ZV, Bishop SR | year = 2007 | title = Mindfulness-based stress reduction and attentional control | url = | journal = Clinical Psychology &amp; Psychotherapy | volume = 14 | issue = 6| pages = 449–463 | doi=10.1002/cpp.544}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hölzel_2011b" /&gt; For instance the MBSR may differ to how mindful one becomes relative to a person who is already high in trait mindfulness.&lt;ref name = "Malinowski_2013" /&gt;
* Using the Attention Network Task (a version of [[Eriksen flanker task]] &lt;ref name="Fan, J. 2002"/&gt;) it was found that error scores that indicate executive control performance were reduced in experienced meditators &lt;ref name="Jha2007" /&gt; and following a brief 5 session mindfulness training program.&lt;ref name="Tang2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tang YY, Ma Y, Wang J, Fan Y, Feng S, Lu Q, Yu Q, Sui D, Rothbart MK, Fan M, Posner MI | title = Short-term meditation training improves attention and self-regulation | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 104 | issue = 43 | pages = 17152–6 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17940025 | pmc = 2040428 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0707678104 | bibcode = 2007PNAS..10417152T }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A neuroimaging study supports behavioural research findings that higher levels of mindfulness are associated with greater proficiency to inhibit distracting information. As greater activation of the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was shown for mindfulness meditators than matched controls.
* Following a [[Stroop test]], reduced amplitude of the [[P300 (neuroscience)|P3]] ERP component was found for a meditation group relative to control participants. This was taken to signify that mindfulness meditation improves executive control functions of attention. An increased amplitude in the [[N200 (neuroscience)|N2]] ERP component was also observed in the mindfulness meditation group, thought to reflect more efficient perceptual discrimination in earlier stages of perceptual processing.&lt;ref name="pmid22363278"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moore A, Gruber T, Derose J, Malinowski P | title = Regular, brief mindfulness meditation practice improves electrophysiological markers of attentional control | journal = Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 18 | date = 2012 | pmid = 22363278 | pmc = 3277272 | doi = 10.3389/fnhum.2012.00018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emotion regulation and mindfulness===
Reductions in rumination have been found following Mindfulness meditation practise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kumar S, Feldman G, Hayes A | year = 2008 | title = Changes in mindfulness and emotion regulation in an exposure-based cognitive therapy for depression | url = | journal = Cognitive Therapy and Research | volume = 32 | issue = 6| pages = 734–744 | doi=10.1007/s10608-008-9190-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ramel W, Goldin PR, Carmona PE, McQuaid JR | year = 2004 | title = The effects of mindfulness meditation on cognitive processes and affect in patients with past depression | journal = Cognitive Therapy and Research | volume = 28 | issue = 4| pages = 433–455 | doi = 10.1023/b:cotr.0000045557.15923.96 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Evidence of mindfulness and emotion regulation outcomes====
Emotional reactivity can be measured and reflected in brain regions related to the production of emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ochsner KN, Gross JJ | title = The cognitive control of emotion | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | pages = 242–9 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15866151 | doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2005.03.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be reflected in tests of attentional performance, indexed in poorer performance in attention related tasks. The regulation of emotional reactivity as initiated by attentional control capacities can be taxing to performance, as attentional resources are limited &lt;ref name="Posner_2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Posner MI, Rothbart MK | title = Research on attention networks as a model for the integration of psychological science | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 58 | issue =  | pages = 1–23 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17029565 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.58.110405.085516 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD) exhibited reduced amygdala activation in response to negative self-beliefs following an MBSR intervention program that involves mindfulness meditation practise &lt;ref name="Goldin"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goldin PR, Gross JJ | title = Effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) on emotion regulation in social anxiety disorder | journal = Emotion | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 83–91 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 20141305 | pmc = 4203918 | doi = 10.1037/a0018441 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The LPP ERP component indexes arousal and is larger in amplitude for emotionally salient stimuli relative to neutral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cuthbert BN, Schupp HT, Bradley MM, Birbaumer N, Lang PJ | title = Brain potentials in affective picture processing: covariation with autonomic arousal and affective report | journal = Biological Psychology | volume = 52 | issue = 2 | pages = 95–111 | date = March 2000 | pmid = 10699350 | doi = 10.1016/s0301-0511(99)00044-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schupp HT, Cuthbert BN, Bradley MM, Cacioppo JT, Ito T, Lang PJ | title = Affective picture processing: the late positive potential is modulated by motivational relevance | journal = Psychophysiology | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 257–61 | date = March 2000 | pmid = 10731776 | doi = 10.1111/1469-8986.3720257 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schupp HT, Junghöfer M, Weike AI, Hamm AO | title = Attention and emotion: an ERP analysis of facilitated emotional stimulus processing | journal = NeuroReport | volume = 14 | issue = 8 | pages = 1107–10 | date = June 2003 | pmid = 12821791 | doi = 10.1097/00001756-200306110-00002 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.521.5802 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals higher in trait mindfulness showed lower LPP responses to high arousal unpleasant images.

* Participants that completed a 7-week mindfulness training program demonstrated a reduction in a measure of emotional interference (measured as slower responses times following the presentation of emotional relative to neutral pictures). This suggests a reduction in emotional interference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ortner CN, Kilner SJ, Zelazo PD | year = 2007 | title = Mindfulness meditation and reduced emotional interference on a cognitive task | url = | journal = Motivation and Emotion | volume = 31 | issue = 4| pages = 271–283 | doi=10.1007/s11031-007-9076-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Following a MBSR intervention, decreases in social anxiety symptom severity were found, as well as increases in bilateral parietal cortex neural correlates. This is thought to reflect the increased employment of inhibitory attentional control capacities to regulate emotions &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goldin P, Ziv M, Jazaieri H, Hahn K, Gross JJ | title = MBSR vs aerobic exercise in social anxiety: fMRI of emotion regulation of negative self-beliefs | journal = Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 65–72 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 22586252 | pmc = 3541489 | doi = 10.1093/scan/nss054 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Farb"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Farb NA, Segal ZV, Mayberg H, Bean J, McKeon D, Fatima Z, Anderson AK | title = Attending to the present: mindfulness meditation reveals distinct neural modes of self-reference | journal = Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 313–22 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18985137 | pmc = 2566754 | doi = 10.1093/scan/nsm030 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Controversies in mindful emotion regulation====
It is debated as to whether top-down executive control regions such as the [[Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]] (DLPFC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Quirk GJ, Beer JS | title = Prefrontal involvement in the regulation of emotion: convergence of rat and human studies | journal = Current Opinion in Neurobiology | volume = 16 | issue = 6 | pages = 723–7 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17084617 | doi = 10.1016/j.conb.2006.07.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are required &lt;ref name="Farb" /&gt; or not &lt;ref name="Goldin" /&gt; to inhibit reactivity of the amygdala activation related to the production of evoked emotional responses. Arguably an initial increase in activation of executive control regions developed during mindfulness training may lessen with increasing mindfulness expertise &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chiesa A, Calati R, Serretti A | title = Does mindfulness training improve cognitive abilities?

===[[Prevention of mental disorders|Prevention of mental illness]]===

An 8 week [[mindfulness]] course given to students was found to reduce the number subsequently needing treatment for [[mental illness]] by 60%, although the study was not of large size and commented that the effect could be due to 'non-specific effects', as the control group had received no attention at all, rather than an alternative intervention.&lt;ref name="Galante et al 2017"

===[[Psychological stress|Stress]] reduction===

Research has shown stress reduction benefits from mindfulness.&lt;ref name="journals.lww.com"&gt;https://journals.lww.com/psychosomaticmedicine/Fulltext/2018/06000/Common_and_Dissociable_Neural_Activity_After.6.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.laboratoryequipment.com/news/2018/06/mindfulness-meditation-relaxation-response-have-different-effects-brain-function&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future directions===
A large part of mindfulness research is dependent on technology. As new technology continues to be developed, new imaging techniques will become useful in this field. Real-time fMRI might give immediate feedback and guide participants through the programs. It could also be used to more easily train and evaluate mental states during meditation itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tang YY, Posner MI | title = Tools of the trade: theory and method in mindfulness neuroscience | journal = Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 118–20 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23081977 | pmc = 3541497 | doi = 10.1093/scan/nss112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new technology in the upcoming years offers many exciting potentials for the continued research.

A study comparing practitioners of Sahaja Yoga meditation with a group of non meditators doing a simple relaxation exercise, measured a drop in skin temperature in the meditators compared to a rise in skin temperature in the non meditators as they relaxed. The researchers noted that all other meditation studies that have observed skin temperature have recorded increases and none have recorded a decrease in skin temperature. This suggests that Sahaja Yoga meditation, being a mental silence approach, may differ both experientially and physiologically from simple relaxation.&lt;ref name="Manocha_2010" /&gt;

===Kundalini Yoga===
{{Main|Kundalini yoga#Medical research}}
Kundalini Yoga has proved to increase the prevention of cognitive decline and evaluate the response of biomarkers to treatment, thereby shedding light on the underlying mechanisms of the link between Kundalini Yoga and cognitive impairment. For the study, 81 participants aged 55 and older who had subjective memory complaints and met criteria for mild cognitive impairment, indicated by a total score of 0.5 on the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale. The results showed that at 12 weeks, both the yoga group showed significant improvements in recall memory and visual memory and showed significant sustained improvement in memory up to the 24-week follow-up, the yoga group showed significant improvement in verbal fluency and sustained significant improvements in executive functioning at week 24. In addition, the yoga cohort showed significant improvement in depressive symptoms, apathy, and resilience from emotional stress. This research was provided by Helen Lavretsky, M.D. and colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Watts |first1=Vabren | name-list-format = vanc |title=Kundalini Yoga Found to Enhance Cognitive Functioning in Older Adults |journal=Psychiatric News |volume=51 |issue=9 |year=2016 |pages=1 |doi=10.1176/appi.pn.2016.4b11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In another study, Kundalini Yoga did not show significant effectiveness in treating obsessive-compulsive disorders compared with Relaxation/Meditation.&lt;ref name=pmid16437509&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Krisanaprakornkit T, Krisanaprakornkit W, Piyavhatkul N, Laopaiboon M | title = Meditation therapy for anxiety disorders | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume =  | issue = 1 | pages = CD004998 | date = January 2006 | pmid = 16437509 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD004998.pub2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research on unspecified or multiple types of meditation==

===Brain activity===
{{Main|Brain activity and meditation}}

The medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices have been found to be relatively deactivated during meditation (experienced meditators using concentration, lovingkindness and choiceless awareness meditation). In addition experienced meditators were found to have stronger coupling between the posterior cingulate, dorsal anterior cingulate, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices both when meditating and when not meditating.&lt;ref name="pnas"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brewer JA, Worhunsky PD, Gray JR, Tang YY, Weber J, Kober H | title = Meditation experience is associated with differences in default mode network activity and connectivity | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 108 | issue = 50 | pages = 20254–9 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 22114193 | pmc = 3250176 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1112029108 | bibcode = 2011PNAS..10820254B | jstor = 23060108 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mental health===

A meta analysis found meditation gave some benefits, but no evidence that it was better than other treatments, for mental illness.&lt;ref name="Goyal_2014"/&gt;

===Physical changes in the brain===
Meditation has been shown to change [[grey matter]] concentrations and the [[precuneus]].&lt;ref name="pmid25632405"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kurth F, Luders E, Wu B, Black DS | title = Brain Gray Matter Changes Associated with Mindfulness Meditation in Older Adults: An Exploratory Pilot Study using Voxel-based Morphometry | journal = Neuro | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 23–26 | year = 2014 | pmid = 25632405 | pmc = 4306280 | doi = 10.17140/NOJ-1-106 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Hölzel_2011a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kurth_2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kurth F, MacKenzie-Graham A, Toga AW, Luders E | title = Shifting brain asymmetry: the link between meditation and structural lateralization | journal = Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 55–61 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 24643652 | pmc = 4994843 | doi = 10.1093/scan/nsu029 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fox_2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hölzel_2010"/&gt;

An eight-week [[MBSR]] course induced changes in gray matter concentrations.&lt;ref name = "Hölzel_2011a" /&gt; Exploratory whole brain analyses identified significant increases in gray matter concentration in the PCC, TPJ, and the cerebellum. These results suggest that participation in MBSR is associated with changes in gray matter concentration in brain regions involved in learning and memory processes, emotion regulation, self-referential processing, and perspective taking.

===Perception===
Studies have shown that meditation has both short-term and long-term effects on various perceptual faculties. In 1984 a study showed that meditators have a significantly lower detection threshold for light stimuli of short duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brown D, Forte M, Dysart M | title = Differences in visual sensitivity among mindfulness meditators and non-meditators | journal = Perceptual and Motor Skills | volume = 58 | issue = 3 | pages = 727–33 | date = June 1984 | pmid = 6382144 | doi = 10.2466/pms.1984.58.3.727 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 a study of the perception of visual illusions by zen masters, novice meditators, and non-meditators showed statistically significant effects found for the [[Poggendorff Illusion]] but not for the [[Müller-Lyer Illusion]]. The zen masters experienced a statistically significant reduction in initial illusion (measured as error in millimeters) and a lower decrement in illusion for subsequent trials.&lt;ref name="perceptualskills"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tloczynski J, Santucci A, Astor-Stetson E | title = Perception of visual illusions by novice and longer-term meditators | journal = Perceptual and Motor Skills | volume = 91 | issue = 3 Pt 1 | pages = 1021–6 | date = December 2000 | pmid = 11153836 | doi = 10.2466/pms.2000.91.3.1021 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tloczynski has described the theory of mechanism behind the changes in perception that accompany mindfulness meditation thus: "''A person who meditates consequently perceives objects more as directly experienced stimuli and less as concepts… With the removal or minimization of cognitive stimuli and generally increasing awareness, meditation can therefore influence both the quality (accuracy) and quantity (detection) of perception.''"&lt;ref name="perceptualskills"/&gt; Brown also points to this as a possible explanation of the phenomenon: "''[the higher rate of detection of single light flashes] involves quieting some of the higher mental processes which normally obstruct the perception of subtle events.''"{{cite quote|date=October 2014}} In other words, the practice may temporarily or permanently alter some of the top-down processing involved in filtering subtle events usually deemed noise by the perceptual filters.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

===Relaxation response===
[[Herbert Benson]], founder of the Mind-Body Medical Institute, which is affiliated with [[Harvard University]] and several Boston hospitals, reports that meditation induces a host of biochemical and physical changes in the body collectively referred to as the "relaxation response".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Benson H | title = The relaxation response: therapeutic effect | journal = Science | volume = 278 | issue = 5344 | pages = 1694–5 | date = December 1997 | pmid = 9411784 | doi = 10.1126/science.278.5344.1693b | bibcode = 1997Sci...278.1693B }}&lt;/ref&gt; The relaxation response includes changes in metabolism, heart rate, respiration, blood pressure and brain chemistry. Benson and his team have also done clinical studies at Buddhist monasteries in the [[Himalaya]]n Mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cromie |first1=William J. |title=Meditation changes temperatures: Mind controls body in extreme experiments |url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/2002/04.18/09-tummo.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070524212421/http://www.hno.harvard.edu/gazette/2002/04.18/09-tummo.html |archive-date=24 May 2007 |date=18 April 2002 |work=Harvard University Gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benson wrote ''[[The Relaxation Response]]'' to document the benefits of meditation, which in 1975 were not yet widely known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Benson |first=Herbert | name-list-format = vanc |title=The Relaxation Response |year=2001 |publisher=HarperCollins |isbn=978-0-380-81595-1 |pages=61–3}}{{psc|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Calming effects===
According to an article in ''Psychological Bulletin'', EEG activity slows as a result of meditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cahn BR, Polich J | title = Meditation states and traits: EEG, ERP, and neuroimaging studies | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 132 | issue = 2 | pages = 180–211 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16536641 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.132.2.180 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Institutes of Health|National Institutes of Health (NIH)]] has written, "It is thought that some types of meditation might work by reducing activity in the [[sympathetic nervous system]] and increasing activity in the [[parasympathetic nervous system]],"{{cite quote|date=October 2014}} or equivalently, that meditation produces a reduction in arousal and increase in relaxation.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

===Arousing effects===
Although the most common modern characterization of Buddhist meditation is a ‘relaxation’ technique, both scientific studies and Buddhist textual sources proves meditation’s arousing or wake-promoting effects.&lt;ref name="Britton"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Britton, W, Lindahl, J, Cahn, B, Davis, J, Goldman, R | title = Awakening is not a metaphor: The effects of buddhist meditation practices on basic wakefulness. | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 13071 | issue = 1 | pages = 64–81 | date = 2014 | doi = 10.1111/nyas.12279 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meditations aiming at improving meta-cognitive skills and compassion (e.g. loving-kindness meditation) are associated with physiological arousal, compared to breathing meditation.&lt;ref name= "Lumma"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lumma, A, Kok, B, Singer, T | title = Is meditation always relaxing? investigating heart rate, heart rate variability, experienced effort and likeability during training of three types of meditation. | journal = International Journal of Psychophysiology | volume = 97 | issue = 1 | pages = 38–45 | date = 2015 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2015.04.017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Theravada (i.e.Vipassana) styles of meditation induce relaxation responses, while Vajrayana styles of meditation induce arousal responses.&lt;ref name="Amihai"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Amihai, I, Maria, K | title = Arousal vs. relaxation: A comparison of the neurophysiological and cognitive correlates of vajrayana and theravada meditative practices. | journal = PLoS One | volume = 9 | issue = 7 | date = 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Short term meditation training enables the voluntary activation of the Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS) results in epinephrine release.&lt;ref name="Kox"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kox, M, Eijk, L, Zwaag, J, Wildenberg, J, Sweep, F, Hoeven, J, Pickkers, P | title = Voluntary activation of the sympathetic nervous system and attenuation of the innate immune response in humans. | journal = National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 111 | issue = 20 | pages = 7379–7384 | date = 2014 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1322174111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the SNS is activated, human body is turning into ‘fight or flight’ mode, whereas the PNS is termed the ‘rest and digest’ mode.&lt;ref name="brodal"&gt;{{cite book |first=Per |last=Brodal |title=The Central Nervous System: Structure and Function  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WdATFQ0YUrMC&amp;pg=PA369#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |edition=3 |publisher=Oxford University Press US |year=2004 |pages=369–396 |isbn=0-19-516560-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when SNS is activated, heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration will be increased, and catecholamines will be produced, while heart rate variability and galvanic skin resistance will be decreased.&lt;ref name="brodal"/&gt; Therefore, Relaxing meditation seems to correspond to PNS dominance, and arousing meditation seems to correspond to SNS dominance.

===Slowing aging===
Aging is a process accompanied by a decrease in brain weight and volume. This phenomenon can be explained by structural changes in the brain, namely, a loss of grey matter. Some studies over the last decade have implicated meditation as a protective factor against normal age-related brain atrophy.&lt;ref name="Luders, E. 2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Luders E, Cherbuin N, Kurth F | title = Forever Young(er): potential age-defying effects of long-term meditation on gray matter atrophy | journal = Frontiers in Psychology | volume = 5 | pages = 1551 | year = 2015 | pmid = 25653628 | pmc = 4300906 | doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01551 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first direct evidence for this link emerged from a study investigating changes in the cortical thickness of meditators. The researchers found that regular meditation practice was able to reduce age-related thinning of the frontal cortex, albeit, these findings were restricted to particular regions of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lazar SW, Kerr CE, Wasserman RH, Gray JR, Greve DN, Treadway MT, McGarvey M, Quinn BT, Dusek JA, Benson H, Rauch SL, Moore CI, Fischl B | title = Meditation experience is associated with increased cortical thickness | journal = NeuroReport | volume = 16 | issue = 17 | pages = 1893–7 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16272874 | pmc = 1361002 | doi = 10.1097/01.wnr.0000186598.66243.19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar study looked to further expand on this finding by including a behavioural component. Consistent with the previous study, meditators did not show the expected negative correlation between grey matter volume and age. In addition, the results for meditators on the behavioural test, measuring attentional performance, were comparable across all age groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pagnoni G, Cekic M | title = Age effects on gray matter volume and attentional performance in Zen meditation | journal = Neurobiology of Aging | volume = 28 | issue = 10 | pages = 1623–7 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17655980 | doi = 10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2007.06.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that meditation can potentially protect against age-related grey matter loss and age-related cognitive decline. Since then, more research has supported the notion that meditation serves as a neuroprotective factor that slows age-related brain atrophy.&lt;ref name="Luders, E. 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kurth F, Cherbuin N, Luders E | title = Reduced age-related degeneration of the hippocampal subiculum in long-term meditators | journal = Psychiatry Research | volume = 232 | issue = 3 | pages = 214–8 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 25907419 | doi = 10.1016/j.pscychresns.2015.03.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Still, all studies have been cross sectional in design. Furthermore, these results merely describe associations and do not make causal inferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Luders E | title = Exploring age-related brain degeneration in meditation practitioners | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1307 | issue = 1 | pages = 82–88 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 23924195 | doi = 10.1111/nyas.12217 | bibcode = 2014NYASA1307...82L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further work using longitudinal and experimental designs may help solidify the causal link between meditation and grey matter loss. Since few studies have investigated this direct link, however insightful they may be, there is not sufficient evidence for a conclusive answer.

Research has also been conducted on the malleable determinants of cellular aging in an effort to understand human longevity. Researchers have stated, "We have reviewed data linking stress arousal and oxidative stress to telomere shortness. Meditative practices appear to improve the endocrine balance toward positive arousal (high DHEA, lower cortisol) and decrease oxidative stress. Thus, meditation practices may promote mitotic cell longevity both through decreasing stress hormones and oxidative stress and increasing hormones that may protect the telomere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Epel E, Daubenmier J, Moskowitz JT, Folkman S, Blackburn E | title = Can meditation slow rate of cellular aging?

===Happiness===

Studies have shown meditators to have higher happiness than control groups, although this may be due to non-specific factors such as meditators having better general self-care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ramesh MG, Sathian B, Sinu E, Kiranmai SR | title = Efficacy of rajayoga meditation on positive thinking: an index for self-satisfaction and happiness in life | journal = Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research | volume = 7 | issue = 10 | pages = 2265–7 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 24298493 | pmc = 3843423 | doi = 10.7860/JCDR/2013/5889.3488 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.paid.2015.08.040 |title=Meditation and happiness: Mindfulness and self-compassion may mediate the meditation–happiness relationship |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |volume=93 |pages=80–85 |year=2016 |last1=Campos |first1=Daniel |last2=Cebolla |first2=Ausiàs |last3=Quero |first3=Soledad |last4=Bretón-López |first4=Juana |last5=Botella |first5=Cristina |last6=Soler |first6=Joaquim |last7=García-Campayo |first7=Javier |last8=Demarzo |first8=Marcelo |last9=Baños |first9=Rosa María | name-list-format = vanc |hdl=10234/157867 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Manocha et al 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="degruyter.com"/&gt;

The following is an official statement from the [[Federal government of the United States|US government]]-run [[National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"''Meditation is considered to be safe for healthy people. There have been rare reports that meditation could cause or worsen symptoms in people who have certain psychiatric problems, but this question has not been fully researched.

==Research methods on the human brain remain primitive==
Although we can now scan the brain, inferring value from blood movements in a human brain remains debatable.

{{quote|''Numerous studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of a variety of meditation practices. It has been unclear to what extent these practices share neural correlates. Interstingly, a recent study compared electroencephalogram activity during a focused-attention and open monitoring meditation practice from practitioners of two Buddhist traditions (17). The researchers found that the differences between the two meditation traditions were more pronounced than the differences between the two types of meditation. These data are consistent with our findings that theoretical orientation of how a practice is taught strongly influences neural activity during these practices. However, the study used long-term practitioners from different cultures, which may have confounded the results.''&lt;ref name="journals.lww.com"&gt;https://journals.lww.com/psychosomaticmedicine/Fulltext/2018/06000/Common_and_Dissociable_Neural_Activity_After.6.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6353">In the theory of [[renewal process]]es, a part of the mathematical theory of probability, the '''residual time''' or the '''forward recurrence time''' is the time between any given time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and the next [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]] of the renewal process under consideration. In the context of random walks, it is also known as '''overshoot'''. Another way to phrase residual time is "how much longer time is there to wait?". 

The residual time is very important in most of the practical applications of renewal processes:
* In [[queueing theory]], it determines the remaining time, that a newly arriving customer to a non-empty queue has to wait until being served.&lt;ref&gt;William J. Stewart, "Probability, Markov Chains, Queues, and Simulation: The Mathematical Basis of Performance Modeling", Princeton University Press, 2011, {{ISBN|1-4008-3281-0}}, 9781400832811&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[wireless networking]], it determines, for example, the remaining lifetime of a wireless link on arrival of a new packet.
* In [[dependability]] studies, it models the remaining lifetime of a component.
* etc.

== Formal definition ==
[[File:Renewal process.reetep.png|thumb|right|350px|Sample evolution of a renewal process with ''holding times'' ''S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and jump times ''J&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''.]]
Consider a renewal process &lt;math&gt;\{N(t),t\geq0\}&lt;/math&gt;, with ''holding times'' &lt;math&gt;S_{i}&lt;/math&gt; and ''jump times'' (or renewal epochs) &lt;math&gt;J_{i}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;i\in\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;. The holding times &lt;math&gt;S_{i}&lt;/math&gt; are non-negative, independent, identically distributed random variables and the renewal process is defined as &lt;math&gt;N(t) = \sup\{n: J_{n} \leq t\}&lt;/math&gt;. Then, to a given time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, there corresponds uniquely an &lt;math&gt;N(t)&lt;/math&gt;, such that:

:&lt;math&gt;J_{N(t)} \leq t &lt; J_{N(t)+1}. \, &lt;/math&gt;

The '''residual time''' (or excess time) is given by the time &lt;math&gt;Y(t)&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; to the next renewal epoch.

:&lt;math&gt;Y(t) = J_{N(t)+1} - t. \,&lt;/math&gt;

== Probability distribution of the residual time ==
Let the [[cumulative distribution function]] of the holding times &lt;math&gt;S_{i}&lt;/math&gt; be &lt;math&gt;F(t) = Pr[S_{i} \leq t]&lt;/math&gt; and recall that the [[Renewal theory#Properties of renewal processes and renewal-reward processes|renewal function]] of a process is &lt;math&gt;m(t) = \mathbb{E}[N(t)]&lt;/math&gt;. Then, for a given time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, the cumulative distribution function of &lt;math&gt;Y(t)&lt;/math&gt; is calculated as:&lt;ref&gt;Jyotiprasad Medhi, "Stochastic processes", New Age International, 1994, {{ISBN|81-224-0549-5}}, 9788122405491&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi(x,t) = \Pr[Y(t) \leq x] = F(t+x) - \int_0^t \left[1 - F(t+x-y)\right]dm(y)&lt;/math&gt;

Differentiating with respect to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, the probability density function can be written as 
:&lt;math&gt;\phi(x, t) = f(t+x) + \int_0^t f(u+x) m'(t-u) du, &lt;/math&gt;

where we have substituted &lt;math&gt;u = t-y.&lt;/math&gt; From elementary renewal theorem &lt;math&gt;m'(t) \rightarrow 1/\mu&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;t \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt;. If we consider the limiting distribution as &lt;math&gt;t \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt;, assuming that &lt;math&gt;f(t) \rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;t \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt;, we have the limiting pdf as

:&lt;math&gt; \phi(x) = \frac{1}{\mu} \int_0^\infty f(u+x) du = \frac{1}{\mu} \int_x^\infty f(v) dv  = \frac{1 - F(x)}{\mu},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the mean of the distribution &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. Likewise, the cumulative distribution of the residual time is 

:&lt;math&gt; \Phi(x) = \frac{1}{\mu} \int_0^x [1 - F(x)] du.&lt;/math&gt;

For large &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, the distribution is independent of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, making it a stationary distribution. An interesting fact is that the limiting distribution of forward recurrence time (or residual time) has the same form as the limiting distribution of the backward recurrence time (or age). This distribution is always J-shaped, with mode at zero.

The first two moments of this limiting distribution &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; are:

:&lt;math&gt; E[Y] = \frac{\mu_2}{2\mu} = \frac{\mu^2 + \sigma^2}{2\mu}, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; E[Y^2] = \frac{\mu_3}{3\mu}, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2&lt;/math&gt; is the variance of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu_3&lt;/math&gt; are its second and third moments. 

=== Waiting time paradox ===
The fact that &lt;math&gt; E[Y] = \frac{\mu^2 + \sigma^2}{2\mu} &gt; \frac{\mu}{2}, &lt;/math&gt; is also known variously as the waiting time paradox, inspection paradox, or the paradox of renewal theory. The paradox arises from the fact that the average waiting time for to the next renewal, assuming that the reference time point &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is uniform randomly selected within the inter-renewal interval, is larger than the average inter-renewal interval &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mu}{2}&lt;/math&gt;. The average waiting is &lt;math&gt;E[Y] = \frac{\mu}{2}&lt;/math&gt; only when &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2 = 0&lt;/math&gt;, that is when the renewals are always punctual or deterministic.

=== Special case: Markovian holding times ===
When the holding times &lt;math&gt;S_{i}&lt;/math&gt; are exponentially distributed with &lt;math&gt;F(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}&lt;/math&gt;, the residual times are also exponentially distributed. That is because &lt;math&gt;m(t) = \lambda t&lt;/math&gt; and:

:&lt;math&gt;\Pr[Y(t) \leq x] = \left[1-e^{-\lambda(t+x)}\right] - \int_0^t \left[1 - 1+e^{-\lambda(t+x-y)}\right]d(\lambda y) = 1 - e^{-\lambda x}.&lt;/math&gt;

This is a known characteristic of the [[exponential distribution]], i.e., its [[Exponential distribution#Memorylessness|memoryless property]]. Intuitively, this means that it does not matter how long it has been since the last renewal epoch, the remaining time is still probabilistically the same as in the beginning of the holding time interval.

== Related notions ==
Renewal theory texts usually also define the '''spent time''' or the '''backward recurrence time''' (or the current lifetime) as &lt;math&gt;Z(t) = t - J_{N(t)}&lt;/math&gt;. Its distribution can be calculated in a similar way to that of the residual time. Likewise, the total '''life time''' is the sum of backward recurrence time and forward recurrence time.

'''Sir Richard Owen''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|KCB|FRMS|FRS}} (20 July 1804 – 18 December 1892) was an English [[biologist]], [[comparative anatomy|comparative anatomist]] and [[paleontology|paleontologist]]. Despite being a controversial figure, Owen is generally considered to have been an outstanding naturalist with a remarkable gift for interpreting [[fossil]]s.

Owen produced a vast array of scientific work, but is probably best remembered today for coining the word ''[[Dinosauria]]'' (meaning "Terrible [[Reptile]]" or "Fearfully Great [[Reptile]]").&lt;ref name="Owen 1841" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC 2015"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sir Richard Owen: The man who invented the dinosaur|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lancashire-31623397|publisher=BBC|date=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An outspoken critic of [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]], Owen agreed with Darwin that evolution occurred, but thought it was more complex than outlined in Darwin's ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''.&lt;ref name="Cosans2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cosans|first1=Christopher E.|title=Owen's Ape &amp; Darwin's Bulldog: Beyond Darwinism and Creationism|date=2009|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|isbn=978-0-253-22051-6|pages=1–192}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owen's approach to evolution can be seen as having anticipated the issues that have gained greater attention with the recent emergence of [[evolutionary developmental biology]].&lt;ref name="Amundson2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Amundson|first1=Ron| authorlink = Ron Amundson|title=The Changing Role of the Embryo in Evolutionary Thought: Roots of Evo-Devo.|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge University of Press|location=New York|isbn=0521806992|pages=1–296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owen was the first president of the [[Microscopical Society of London]] in 1839 and edited many issues of its journal – then known as ''[[The Microscopic Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/(ISSN)1365-2818/asset/homepages/Introduction.pdf?v=1&amp;s=923176206c03ac89a50d1594fc459670d791a88d | title=175th Anniversary Special Issue: Introduction | author=Wilson, Tony | journal=Journal of Microscopy | year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owen also campaigned for the natural specimens in the [[British Museum]] to be given a new home. This resulted in the establishment, in 1881, of the now world-famous [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] in [[South Kensington]], London.&lt;ref name="Rupke1994"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rupke|first1=Nicolaas A.| authorlink = Nicolaas Adrianus Rupke|title=Richard Owen: Victorian Naturalist|date=1994|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=978-0300058208|pages=1–484}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bill Bryson]] argues that, "by making the Natural History Museum an institution for everyone, Owen transformed our expectations of what museums are for".&lt;ref name="Bryson2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bryson|first1=Bill|title=A Short History of Nearly Everything|date=2003|publisher=Doubleday|location=London|isbn=0-7679-0817-1|pages=1–672}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His contributions to science and public learning notwithstanding, Owen's driving ambition, occasionally vicious temperament, and determination to succeed meant that he was not always popular with his fellow scientists. Owen was feared and even hated by some contemporaries such as [[Thomas Henry Huxley]]. His later career was tainted by controversies, many of which involved accusations that he took credit for other people's work.

==Biography==
Owen was born in [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] in 1804, one of six children of a West Indian Merchant named Richard Owen (1754–1809).  His mother, Catherine Longworth (nee Parrin), was descended from [[Huguenot]]s and he was educated at [[Lancaster Royal Grammar School]]. In 1820, he was apprenticed to a local [[surgery|surgeon]] and [[apothecary]] and, in 1824, he proceeded as a medical student to the [[University of Edinburgh]]. He left the university in the following year and completed his medical course in [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]], London, where he came under the influence of the eminent surgeon [[John Abernethy (surgeon)|John Abernethy]].
[[File:Richard Owen.JPG|left|thumb|upright|The young Richard Owen]]
In July 1835 Owen married Caroline Amelia Clift in [[St Pancras, London|St Pancras]] by whom he had one son, William Owen.  He outlived both wife and son. After his death, in 1892, he was survived by his three grandchildren and daughter-in-law Emily Owen, to whom he left much of his £33,000 fortune.

Upon completing his education, he contemplated the usual professional career, but his bent was evidently in the direction of anatomical research. He was induced by Abernethy to accept the position of assistant to [[William Clift]], conservator of the museum of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|Royal College of Surgeons]]. This congenial occupation soon led him to abandon his intention of medical practice and his life thenceforth was devoted to purely scientific labours. He prepared an important series of catalogues of the [[John Hunter (surgeon)|Hunterian Collection]], in the Royal College of Surgeons and, in the course of this work, he acquired the unrivalled knowledge of comparative anatomy that enabled him to enrich all departments of the science and especially facilitated his researches on the remains of [[extinct animal]]s.
[[File:Natural History Museum London Jan 2006.jpg|thumb|Owen was the driving force behind the establishment, in 1881, of the [[British Museum (Natural History)]] in London.]]
In 1836, Owen was appointed Hunterian professor, in the Royal College of Surgeons and, in 1849, he succeeded Clift as conservator. He held the latter office until 1856, when he became superintendent of the natural history department of the [[British Museum]]. He then devoted much of his energies to a great scheme for a National Museum of Natural History, which eventually resulted in the removal of the natural history collections of the British Museum to a new building at [[South Kensington]]: the British Museum (Natural History) (now the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]]). He retained office until the completion of this work, in December, 1883, when he was made a knight of the [[Order of the Bath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Eminent persons: Biographies reprinted from the Times, Vol V, 1891–1892 - Sir Richard Owen (Obituary)|publisher=Macmillan &amp; Co.|pages=291–299|year=1896|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bKEMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA291 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He lived quietly in retirement at Sheen Lodge, [[Richmond Park]], until his death in 1892.

His career was tainted by accusations that he failed to give credit to the work of others and even tried to appropriate it in his own name. This came to a head in 1846, when he was awarded the [[Royal Medal]] for a paper he had written on [[belemnite]]s.  Owen had failed to acknowledge that the belemnite had been discovered by Chaning Pearce, an amateur biologist, four years earlier. As a result of the ensuing scandal, he was voted off the councils of the [[Zoological Society of London|Zoological Society]] and the [[Royal Society]].

Owen always tended to support orthodox men of science and the status quo. The royal family presented him with the cottage in Richmond Park and [[Robert Peel]] put him on the [[Civil List]]. In 1843, he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].

He died at home on 15 December 1892 and is buried in the churchyard at [[Ham, London|Ham]] near [[Richmond, Surrey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work on invertebrates==
While occupied with the cataloguing of the Hunterian collection, Owen did not confine his attention to the preparations before him but also seized every opportunity to dissect fresh subjects. He was allowed to examine all animals that died in [[Zoological Society of London|London Zoo]]'s gardens and, when the Zoo began to publish scientific proceedings, in 1831, he was the most prolific contributor of anatomical papers. His first notable publication, however, was his ''Memoir on the Pearly [[Nautilus]]'' (London, 1832), which was soon recognized as a classic. Henceforth, he continued to make important contributions to every department of comparative anatomy and [[zoology]] for a period of over fifty years. In the sponges, Owen was the first to describe the now well-known [[Venus' Flower Basket]] or ''[[Euplectella]]'' (1841, 1857). Among Entozoa, his most noteworthy discovery was that of ''Trichina spiralis'' (1835), the parasite infesting the muscles of man in the disease now termed [[trichinosis]] (see also, however, [[James Paget|Sir James Paget]]). Of [[Brachiopod]]a he made very special studies, which much advanced knowledge and settled the classification that has long been accepted. Among [[Mollusc]]a, he described not only the pearly nautilus but also ''[[Spirula]]'' (1850) and other [[Cephalopod]]a, both living and extinct, and it was he who proposed the universally-accepted subdivision of this class into the two orders of Dibranchiata and Tetrabranchiata (1832). In 1852 Owen named ''[[Protichnites]]'' – the oldest footprints found on land.&lt;ref name="Owen1852"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Owen|first1=Richard|title=Description of the impressions and footprints of the Protichnites from the Potsdam sandstone of Canada|journal=Geological Society of London Quarterly Journal|date=1852|volume=8|pages=214–225}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Applying his knowledge of anatomy, he correctly postulated that these [[Cambrian]] trackways were made by an extinct type of [[arthropod]],&lt;ref name="Owen1852"/&gt; and he did this more than 150 years before any fossils of the animal were found.&lt;ref name="ColletteHagadorn2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collette|first1=Joseph H.|last2=Hagadorn|first2=James W.|title=Three-dimensionally preserved arthropods from Cambrian Lagerstatten of Quebec and Wisconsin|journal=Journal of Paleontology|date=2010|volume=84|issue=4|pages=646–667}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ColletteGassHagadorn2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collette|first1=Joseph H|last2=Gass|first2=Kenneth C|last3=Hagadorn|first3=James W|title=Protichnites eremita unshelled?

==Fish, reptiles, birds, and naming of dinosaurs==
[[File:Richard Owen 1856.jpg|thumb|upright|Richard Owen in 1856 with the skull of a crocodile]]
Owen's technical descriptions of the [[vertebrate|Vertebrata]] were still more numerous and extensive than those of the [[invertebrate]] animals. His ''Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of Vertebrates'' (3 vols. London 1866–1868) was indeed the result of more personal research than any similar work since [[Georges Cuvier]]'s ''Leçons d'anatomie comparée''. He not only studied existing forms but also devoted great attention to the remains of [[extinct]] groups, and followed Cuvier, the pioneer of [[vertebrate paleontology]]. Early in his career, he made exhaustive studies of [[teeth]] of existing and extinct animals and published his profusely illustrated work on ''Odontography'' (1840–1845). He discovered and described the remarkably complex structure of the [[teeth]] of the extinct animals which he named [[Labyrinthodontia]]. Among his writings on fish, his memoir on the African lungfish, which he named ''[[Protopterus]]'', laid the foundations for the recognition of the [[Lungfish|Dipnoi]] by [[Johannes Peter Müller|Johannes Müller]]. He also later pointed out the serial connection between the [[teleostean]] and [[ganoid]] fishes, grouping them in one sub-class, the [[Teleostomi]].

Most of his work on [[reptile]]s related to the [[skeleton]]s of extinct forms and his chief memoirs, on British specimens, were reprinted in a connected series in his ''History of British Fossil Reptiles'' (4 vols. London 1849–1884). He published the first important general account of the great group of [[Mesozoic]] land-reptiles, and he coined the name [[Dinosauria]] from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''δεινός'' (''deinos'') "terrible, powerful, wondrous" + ''σαύρος'' (''sauros'') "lizard".&lt;ref name="Owen 1841"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Owen|first1=Richard|title=Report on British fossil reptiles.

(*Gr.

Most of these were obtained from South Africa, beginning in 1845 (''[[Dicynodon]]'') and eventually furnished materials for his ''Catalogue of the Fossil Reptilia of South Africa'', issued by the [[British Museum]], in 1876. Among his writings on birds, his classical memoir on the [[kiwi]] (1840–1846), a long series of papers on the extinct [[Moa|Dinornithidae]] of [[New Zealand]], other memoirs on ''[[Adzebill|Aptornis]]'', the [[takahe]], the [[dodo]] and the [[great auk]], may be especially mentioned. His monograph on ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' (1863), the long-tailed, toothed bird from the [[Bavaria]]n lithographic stone, is also an epoch-making work.

With [[Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins]], Owen helped create the first life-size sculptures depicting dinosaurs as he thought they might have appeared. Some models were initially created for the [[Great Exhibition of 1851]], but 33 were eventually produced when [[the Crystal Palace]] was relocated to [[Sydenham]], in South London. Owen famously hosted a dinner for 21 prominent men of science inside the hollow concrete ''[[Iguanodon]]'' on New Year's Eve 1853. However, in 1849, a few years before his death in 1852, [[Gideon Mantell]] had realised that ''Iguanodon'', of which he was the discoverer, was not a heavy, [[Pachydermata|pachyderm]]-like animal,&lt;ref name=GM51&gt;{{cite book |last=Mantell |first=Gideon A. |title= Petrifications and their teachings: or, a handbook to the gallery of organic remains of the British Museum. |year=1851 |publisher=H. G. Bohn |location=London |oclc= 8415138}}&lt;/ref&gt; as Owen was proposing, but had slender forelimbs; his death left him unable to participate in the creation of the [[Crystal Palace Dinosaurs|Crystal Palace dinosaur sculptures]], and so Owen's vision of dinosaurs became that seen by the public. He had nearly two dozen lifesize sculptures of various prehistoric animals built out of concrete sculpted over a steel and brick framework; two ''Iguanodon'', one standing and one resting on its belly, were included.

==Work on mammals==
[[File:Camel Skeleton - Richard Owen - On the Anatomy of Vertebrates (1866).jpg|thumb|Owen's illustration of a [[camel]]'s [[skeleton]]]]
Owen was granted [[right of first refusal]] on any freshly dead animal at the London Zoo. His wife once arrived home to find the carcass of a newly deceased rhinoceros in her front hallway.&lt;ref name="Bryson2003"/&gt;

With regard to living mammals, the more striking of Owen's contributions relate to the [[monotreme]]s, [[marsupial]]s and the anthropoid [[ape]]s. He was also the first to recognize and name the two natural groups of typical Ungulate, the odd-toed ([[Odd-toed ungulate|Perissodactyla]]) and the even-toed ([[Even-toed ungulate|Artiodactyla]]), while describing some fossil remains, in 1848. Most of his writings on mammals, however, deal with extinct forms, to which his attention seems to have been first directed by the remarkable fossils collected by [[Charles Darwin]], in South America. ''[[Toxodon]]'', from the [[pampas]], was then described and gave the earliest clear evidence of an extinct generalized hoof animal, a pachyderm with affinities to the [[Rodent]]ia, [[Edentata]] and [[herbivorous]] [[Cetacea]]. Owen's interest in South American extinct mammals then led to the recognition of the giant [[armadillo]], which he named ''[[Glyptodon]]'' (1839) and to classic memoirs on the giant [[ground sloth|ground-sloth]]s, ''[[Mylodon]]'' (1842) and ''[[Megatherium]]'' (1860), besides other important contributions. Owen also first described the [[false killer whale]] in 1863.

At the same time, Sir [[Thomas Mitchell (explorer)|Thomas Mitchell]]'s discovery of fossil bones, in [[New South Wales]], provided material for the first of Owen's long series of papers on the extinct mammals of Australia, which were eventually reprinted in book-form in 1877. He discovered ''[[Diprotodon]]'' (1838) and ''[[Thylacoleo]]'' (1859), besides extinct [[kangaroo]]s and [[wombat]]s, of gigantic size. While occupied with so much material from abroad, Owen was also busily collecting facts for an exhaustive work on similar fossils from the British Isles and, in 1844–1846, he published his ''History of British Fossil Mammals and Birds'', which was followed by many later memoirs, notably his ''Monograph of the Fossil Mammalia of the Mesozoic Formations'' (Palaeont. Soc., 1871). One of his latest publications was a little work entitled ''Antiquity of Man as deduced from the Discovery of a Human Skeleton during Excavations of the Docks at Tilbury'' (London, 1884).

==Owen, Darwin, and the theory of evolution==
[[File:dinornis1387.jpg|thumb|upright|Owen with a [[giant moa]] skeleton]]
Following [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|the voyage of the ''Beagle'']], [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] had at his disposal a considerable collection of specimens and, on 29 October 1836, he was introduced by [[Charles Lyell]] to Owen, who agreed to work on fossil bones collected in South America. Owen's subsequent revelations, that the extinct giant creatures were rodents and sloths, showed that they were related to current species in the same locality, rather than being relatives of similarly sized creatures in Africa, as Darwin had originally thought. This was one of the many influences that led Darwin later to formulate his own ideas on the concept of [[natural selection]].

At this time, Owen talked of his theories, influenced by [[Johannes Peter Müller]], that living matter had an "organising energy", a life-force that directed the growth of tissues and also determined the lifespan of the individual and of the species. Darwin was reticent about his own thoughts, understandably, when, on 19 December 1838, as secretary of the [[Geological Society of London]], he saw Owen and his allies ridicule the [[Lamarckian]] 'heresy' of Darwin's old tutor, [[Robert Edmund Grant]]. In 1841, when the recently married Darwin was ill, Owen was one of the few scientific friends to visit; however, Owen's opposition to any hint of [[Transmutation of species|transmutation]] made Darwin keep quiet about his hypothesis.

Sometime during the 1840s Owen came to the conclusion that species arise as the result of some sort of evolutionary process.&lt;ref name="Rupke1994"/&gt; He believed that there was a total of six possible mechanisms: parthenogenesis, prolonged development, premature birth, congenital malformations, Lamarckian atrophy, Lamarckian hypertrophy and transmutation,&lt;ref name="Rupke1994"/&gt; of which he thought transmutation was the least likely.&lt;ref name="Rupke1994"/&gt;  The historian of science Evelleen Richards has argued that Owen was likely sympathetic to developmental theories of evolution, but backed away from publicly proclaiming them after the critical reaction that had greeted the anonymously published evolutionary book ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]'' in 1844 (it was revealed only decades later that the book had been authored by publisher [[Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802)|Robert Chambers]]). Owen had been criticized for his own evolutionary remarks in his ''Nature of the Limbs'' in 1849.&lt;ref name="Richards1987"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richards|first1=Evellen|title=A Question of Property Rights: Richard Owen's Evolutionism Reassessed|journal=British Journal for the History of Science|date=1987|volume=20|issue=2|pages=129–171|jstor=4026305}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of ''On the Nature of Limbs'' Owen had suggested that humans ultimately evolved from fish as the result of natural laws,&lt;ref&gt;Owen, 2007, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; which resulted in his being criticized in the ''[[Manchester Spectator]]'' for denying that species such as humans were created by God.&lt;ref name="Rupke1994"/&gt;

During the [[development of Darwin's theory]], his investigation of [[barnacle]]s showed, in 1849, how their segmentation related to other crustaceans, showing how they had diverged from their relatives. To both Darwin and Owen such "homologies" in comparative anatomy were evidence of descent. Owen demonstrated fossil evidence of an evolutionary sequence of horses, as supporting his idea of development from archetypes in "ordained continuous becoming" and, in 1854, gave a [[British Association for the Advancement of Science|British Association]] talk on the impossibility of bestial apes, such as the recently discovered [[gorilla]], standing erect and being transmuted into men, but Owen did not rule out the possibility that humans had evolved from other extinct animals by evolutionary mechanisms other than transmutation. Working-class militants were trumpeting man's monkey origins. To crush these ideas, Owen, as President-elect of the Royal Association, announced his authoritative anatomical studies of primate brains, claiming that the human brain had structures that apes brains did not, and that therefore humans were a separate sub-class, starting a dispute which was subsequently satirised as the [[Great Hippocampus Question]]. Owen's main argument was that humans have much larger brains for their body size than other mammals including the great apes.&lt;ref name="Cosans2009"/&gt; Darwin wrote that "I cannot swallow Man [being that] distinct from a Chimpanzee". The combative [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] used his March 1858 [[Royal Institution]] lecture to deny Owen's claim and affirmed that structurally, gorillas are as close to humans as they are to [[baboon]]s. He believed that the "mental &amp; moral faculties are essentially... the same kind in animals &amp; ourselves". This was a clear denial of Owen's claim for human uniqueness, given at the same venue.
[[File:Vertebrate archetype.jpg|thumb|This 1847 diagram by Richard Owen shows his conceptual archetype for all vertebrates]]
On the [[publication of Darwin's theory]], in ''[[On The Origin of Species]]'', he sent a complimentary copy to Owen, saying "it will seem 'an abomination{{' "}}. Owen was the first to respond, courteously claiming that he had long believed that "existing influences" were responsible for the "ordained" birth of species. Darwin now had long talks with him and Owen said that the book offered the best explanation "ever published of the manner of formation of species", although he still had the gravest doubts that transmutation would bestialize man. It appears that Darwin had assured Owen that he was looking at everything as resulting from designed laws, which Owen interpreted as showing a shared belief in "Creative Power".

As head of the Natural History Collections at the [[British Museum]], Owen received numerous inquiries and complaints about the ''Origin''. His own views remained unknown: when emphasising to a Parliamentary committee the need for a new Natural History museum, he pointed out that "The whole intellectual world this year has been excited by a book on the origin of species; and what is the consequence? Visitors come to the British Museum, and they say, 'Let us see all these varieties of pigeons: where is the tumbler, where is the pouter?' and I am obliged with shame to say, I can show you none of them" .... "As to showing you the varieties of those species, or of any of those phenomena that would aid one in getting at that mystery of mysteries, the origin of species, our space does not permit; but surely there ought to be a space somewhere, and, if not in the British Museum, where is it to be obtained?"

However, Huxley's attacks were making their mark. In April 1860 the ''Edinburgh Review'' included Owen's anonymous review of the ''Origin''. In it Owen showed his anger at what he saw as Darwin's caricature of the creationist position, and his ignoring Owen's "axiom of the continuous operation of the ordained becoming of living things". As well as attacking Darwin's "disciples", Hooker and Huxley, for their "short-sighted adherence", he thought that the book symbolised the sort of "abuse of science... to which a neighbouring nation, some seventy years since, owed its temporary degradation" in a reference to the [[French Revolution]]. Darwin thought it "Spiteful, extremely malignant, clever, and... damaging" and later commented that "The Londoners say he is mad with envy because my book is so talked about. It is painful to be hated in the intense degree with which Owen hates me."

During the [[reaction to Darwin's theory]], Huxley's arguments with Owen continued. Owen tried to smear Huxley, by portraying him as an "advocate of man's origins from a transmuted ape" and one of his contributions to the ''Athenaeum'' was titled "Ape-Origin of Man as Tested by the Brain". In 1862 (and on other occasions) Huxley took the opportunity to arrange demonstrations of ape brain anatomy (e.g. at the BA meeting, where [[William Henry Flower|William Flower]] performed the dissection). Visual evidence of the supposedly missing structures ([[posterior horn of lateral ventricle|posterior cornu]] and [[hippocampus minor]]) was used, in effect, to indict Owen for perjury. Owen had argued that the absence of those structures in apes were connected with the lesser size to which the ape brains grew, but he then conceded that a poorly developed version might be construed as present without preventing him from arguing that brain size was still the major way of distinguishing apes and humans.&lt;ref name="Cosans2009"/&gt;  Huxley's campaign ran over two years and was devastatingly successful at persuading the overall scientific community, with each "slaying" being followed by a recruiting drive for the Darwinian cause. The spite lingered. While Owen had argued that humans were distinct from apes by virtue of having large brains, Huxley claimed that racial diversity blurred any such distinction.  In his paper criticizing Owen, Huxley directly states: "if we place A, the European brain, B, the [[Bosjesman]] brain, and C, the orang brain, in a series, the differences between A and B, so far as they have been ascertained, are of the same nature as the chief of those between B and C".&lt;ref name="Huxley1861"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huxley|first1=Thomas Henry|title=On the Zoological Relations of Man with the Lower Animals|journal=Natural History Review|date=1861|volume=1|pages=67–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owen countered Huxley by saying the brains of all human races were really of similar size and intellectual ability, and that the fact that humans had brains that were twice the size of large apes like male gorillas, even though humans had much smaller bodies, made humans distinguishable.&lt;ref name="Cosans2009"/&gt;  When Huxley joined the Zoological Society Council, in 1861, Owen left and, in the following year, Huxley moved to stop Owen from being elected to the Royal Society Council, accusing him "of wilful &amp; deliberate falsehood". (See also [[Thomas Henry Huxley]].)

In January 1863, Owen bought the ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' fossil for the [[British Museum]]. It fulfilled Darwin's prediction that a proto-bird with unfused wing fingers would be found, although Owen described it unequivocally as a bird.

The feuding between Owen and Darwin's supporters continued. In 1871, Owen was found to be involved in a threat to end government funding of [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]]'s botanical collection, at [[Kew]], possibly trying to bring it under his [[British Museum]]. Darwin commented that "I used to be ashamed of hating him so much, but now I will carefully cherish my hatred &amp; contempt to the last days of my life".

==Legacy==
[[File:Richard Owen with his granddaughter.jpg|thumb|upright|Owen with his granddaughter Emily]]
Owen's detailed memoirs and descriptions require laborious attention in reading, on account of their complex terminology and ambiguous modes of expression. The fact that very little of his terminology has found universal favour causes them to be more generally neglected than they otherwise would be. At the same time, it must be remembered that he was a pioneer in concise anatomical nomenclature and, so far at least as the vertebrate skeleton is concerned, his terms were based on a carefully reasoned philosophical scheme, which first clearly distinguished between the now-familiar phenomena of [[Analogy (biology)|analogy]] and [[homology (biology)|homology]]. Owen's theory of the Archetype and Homologies of the Vertebrate Skeleton (1848), subsequently illustrated also by his little work ''On the Nature of Limbs'' (1849), regarded the vertebrate frame as consisting of a series of fundamentally identical segments, each modified according to its position and functions. Much of it was fanciful and failed when tested by the facts of [[embryology]], which Owen systematically ignored, throughout his work. However, though an imperfect and distorted view of certain great truths, it possessed a distinct value at the time of its conception.

To the discussion of the deeper problems of biological philosophy, he made scarcely any direct and definite contributions. His generalities rarely extended beyond strict comparative anatomy, the phenomena of adaptation to function and the facts of geographical or geological distribution. His lecture on virgin reproduction or [[parthenogenesis]], however, published in 1849, contained the essence of the [[germ plasm theory]], elaborated later by [[August Weismann]] and he made several vague statements concerning the geological succession of genera and species of animals and their possible derivation one from another. He referred, especially, to the changes exhibited by the successive forerunners of the [[crocodile]]s (1884) and horses (1868) but it has never become clear how much of the modern doctrines of organic evolution he admitted. He contented himself with the bare remark that "the inductive demonstration of the nature and mode of operation of the laws governing life would henceforth be the great aim of the philosophical naturalist."

He was the first director in [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] in London and his statue was in the main hall there until 2009, when it was replaced with a statue of Darwin.

A bust of Owen by [[Alfred Gilbert]] (1896) is held in the [[Hunterian Museum, London]]. There is a blue plaque in his honour at [[Lancaster Royal Grammar School]].

A [[species]] of Central American lizard, ''[[Diploglossus|Diploglossus owenii]]'', was named in his honor by French [[Herpetology|herpetologists]] [[André Marie Constant Duméril]] and [[Gabriel Bibron]] in 1839.&lt;ref&gt;Beolens B, Watkins M, Grayson M (2011).

==Conflicts with his peers==
{{Quotation|Owen: the most distinguished vertebrate zoologist and palaeontologist... but a most deceitful and odious man."|[[Richard Broke Freeman]] in ''Charles Darwin: a Companion'', 1978}}

Owen has been described by some as a malicious, dishonest and hateful individual. He has been described in one biography as being a "social experimenter with a penchant for sadism. Addicted to controversy and driven by arrogance and jealousy". [[Deborah Cadbury]] stated that Owen possessed an "almost fanatical egoism with a callous delight in savaging his critics." Indeed, an Oxford University professor once described Owen as "a damned liar. He lied for God and for malice".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strangescience.net/owen.htm Rocky Road: Sir Richard Owen]. Strangescience.net (2011-05-28). Retrieved on 2011-09-17.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gideon Mantell]] claimed it was "a pity a man so talented should be so dastardly and envious".

{{Quotation|No one fact tells so strongly against Owen...as that he has never reared one pupil or follower.|Charles Darwin to [[Asa Gray]], 1860, in ''More Letters of C.D'', p. 153}}

Owen famously credited himself and [[Georges Cuvier]] with the discovery of the ''[[Iguanodon]]'', completely excluding any credit for the original discoverer of the dinosaur, [[Gideon Mantell]]. This was not the first or last time Owen would falsely claim a discovery as his own. It has also been suggested by some authors, including [[Bill Bryson]] in ''[[A Short History of Nearly Everything]]'', that Owen even used his influence in the [[Royal Society]] to ensure that many of Mantell’s research papers were never published. Owen was finally dismissed from the Royal Society's Zoological Council for [[plagiarism]].
[[File:Richard Owen, riding his hobby.jpg|thumb|left|upright|1873 [[caricature]] of Owen "riding his hobby", by [[Frederick Waddy]]]]
When Mantell suffered an accident that left him permanently crippled, Owen exploited the opportunity by renaming several dinosaurs which had already been named by Mantell, even having the audacity to claim credit for their discovery himself. When Mantell finally died in 1852, an obituary carrying no byline derided Mantell as little more than a mediocre scientist, who brought forth few notable contributions. The obituary’s authorship was universally attributed to Owen by every geologist. The president of the Geological Society claimed that it "bespeaks of the lamentable coldness of the heart of the writer". Owen was subsequently denied the presidency of the society for his repeated and pointed antagonism towards Gideon Mantell.

Even more extraordinary was the way Owen ignored the genuine scientific content of Mantell's work. For example, despite the paucity of finds Mantell had worked out that some dinosaurs were bipedal, including ''[[Iguanodon]]''. This remarkable insight was totally ignored by Owen, whose instructions for the [[Crystal Palace Dinosaurs|Crystal Palace models]] by [[Waterhouse Hawkins]] portrayed ''Iguanodon'' as grossly overweight and quadrupedal, with its misidentified thumb on its nose. Mantell did not live to witness the discovery in 1878 of articulated skeletons in a Belgium coal-mine that showed ''Iguanodon'' was mostly bipedal (and in that stance could use its thumb for defence). Owen made no comment or retraction; he never did on any errors he made. Moreover, since the earliest known dinosaurs were bipedal, Mantell's idea was indeed insightful.
[[File:Old Owen@72.jpg|thumb|upright|Richard Owen in old age]]
Despite originally starting out on good terms with Darwin, Owen was highly critical of the ''Origin'' in large part because Darwin did not refer much to the previous scientific theories of evolution that had been proposed by people like Chambers and himself, and instead compared the theory of evolution by natural selection with the unscientific theory in the Bible.

Another reason for his criticism of the ''Origin'', some historians claim, was that Owen felt upstaged by Darwin and supporters such as Huxley, and his judgment was clouded by jealousy. Owen in Darwin's opinion was "Spiteful, extremely malignant, clever; the Londoners say he is mad with envy because my book is so talked about".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext01/1mlcd10.txt|title=More Letters of Charles Darwin — Volume 1 A Record of His Work in a Series of Hitherto Unpublished Letters|first=Charles|last=Darwin|editor-first1=Francis|editor-last1=Darwin|editor-first2=A.

In the article, Owen was critical of Darwin for not offering many new observations, and heaped praise (in the third person) upon himself, while being careful not to associate any particular comment with his own name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://darwin.gruts.com/docs/er-1860-04/ Darwin on the Origin of Species]. Darwin.gruts.com. Retrieved on 2011-09-17.&lt;/ref&gt; Owen did praise, however, the ''Origin'''s description of Darwin's work on insect behavior and pigeon breeding as Huxley, Thomas H., (1861), "On the Zoological Relations of Man with the Lower Animals", Natural History Review 1: 67–84."real gems".&lt;ref name="Owen1860"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Owen (published anonymously)|first1=Richard|title=Darwin on the Origin of Species|journal=Edinburgh Review|date=1860|volume=111|pages=487–532}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owen was also a party to the threat to end government funding of the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]] botanical collection (see [[Joseph Dalton Hooker#Attacks on Hooker and on Kew|Attacks on Hooker and Kew]]), orchestrated by [[Acton Smee Ayrton]]:
:"There is no doubt that rivalry resulted between the British Museum, where there was the very important Herbarium of the Department of Botany, and Kew. The rivalry at times became extremely personal, especially between Joseph Hooker and Owen...  At the root was Owen’s feeling that Kew should be subordinate to the British Museum (and to Owen) and should not be allowed to develop as an independent scientific institution with the advantage of a great botanic garden." &lt;ref&gt;Turrill W.B. 1963. ''Joseph Dalton Hooker''. Nelson, London. p90.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested by some authors that the portrayal of Owen as a vindictive and treacherous man was fostered and encouraged by his rivals (particularly Darwin, Hooker and Huxley) and may be somewhat undeserved. In the first part of his career he was regarded rightly as one of the great scientific figures of the age. In the second part of his career his reputation slipped. This was not due solely to his underhanded dealings with colleagues; it was also due to serious errors of scientific judgement that were discovered and publicized. A fine example was his decision to classify man in a separate subclass of the Mammalia (see ''[[Man's place in nature]]''). In this Owen had no supporters at all. Also, his unwillingness to come off the fence concerning evolution became increasingly damaging to his reputation as time went on. Owen continued working after his official retirement at the age of 79, but he never recovered the good opinions he had garnered in his younger days.&lt;ref&gt;Desmond A. 1982.

'''Rita Levant Schwerner''' '''Bender''' (born 1942) is a civil rights activist and lawyer. She and her first husband [[Michael Schwerner|Michael (Mickey) Schwerner]] participated in the [[Freedom Summer]] of 1964, where Michael was murdered by the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. As his young widow, she drew national attention for her commentary on racial prejudice in the United States, delivered at a press conference after her husband went missing. After the [[Civil Rights Movement]], Schwerner became an attorney,&lt;ref name="superlawyers.com"&gt;Hauser, Susan G. "Rita L. Bender - Washington Family Law Lawyers - The Truth-Seeker." Super Lawyers. Thomson Reuters, 2010. Web. 03 Nov. 2015. http://www.superlawyers.com/washington/article/The-Truth-Seeker/e0cdd093-6626-4a32-9a64-8a2afbf4a7e4.html&lt;/ref&gt; now practicing family law in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] state. She continues to advocate for civil rights today through her law practice and public presentations.

==Early life==
Schwerner and husband Michael both grew up in New York.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They married when she was 20, he 22.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dewan|first1=Shaila|title=Widow Recalls Ghosts of '64 at Rights Trial|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/17/us/widow-recalls-ghosts-of-64-at-rights-trial.html?_r=0|accessdate=4 August 2016|work=The New York Times|date=17 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==

Rita Schwerner became active in the civil rights movement first in the north; she and Michael were both arrested at a civil rights protest in [[Baltimore]] in July 1963.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=AP|title=Killen verdict shows race matters, victim's widow says|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-06-22-civil-rights-widow_x.htm|accessdate=4 August 2016|work=USAToday|date=June 22, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freedom Summer and death of Michael Schwerner===
The Schwerners moved to [[Meridian, Mississippi]] in January 1964.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hannah-Jones|first1=Nikole|title=A Brutal Loss, but an Enduring Conviction|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/a-brutal-loss-but-an-enduring-conviction|accessdate=4 August 2016|work=ProPublica|date=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was a teacher, and the two worked at a [[Freedom Schools|freedom school]] and registering black voters.

The summer of 1964, known as "Freedom Summer" was an endeavor to register more black voters in the deep south. It was headed up by civil rights activist groups such as the [[Congress of Racial Equality|Congress for Racial Equality]] (CORE), and the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC).&lt;ref&gt;History.com Staff. "Freedom Summer." History.com. A&amp;E Television Networks, 2009. Web. 17 Nov. 2015 http://www.history.com/topics/black-history/freedom-summer&lt;/ref&gt;  Rita Schwerner and her husband Michael (Mickey) were among a group of three hundred students who went to Mississippi to help with the voting campaign. They were 22 and 24 years old.

In June 1964, the Schwerners were attending a civil rights activism training in Ohio when they learned a church involved in the movement in [[Neshoba County, Mississippi|Neshoba County]], Mississippi, had been burned down and its clergy beaten. Michael Schwerner, [[James Chaney]], a black man, and [[Andrew Goodman]], who was white (as were the Schwerners) drove the Schwerner family station wagon back to Mississippi to investigate. On Sunday June 21, the three men were driving together when they were stopped by Neshoba deputy sheriff [[Cecil Price]] outside of the town of [[Philadelphia, Mississippi]]. Price arrested the three men on charge of speeding and locked them in the jailhouse, only to release them around 10pm that night. The men were never seen again.&lt;ref&gt;'Eyes on the Prize. Dir. Henry Hampton.  PBS, 1987. Online.&lt;/ref&gt; Rita Schwerner was still in Ohio when she learned of their disappearance, and two days later, at the Cincinnati airport with [[Fannie Lou Hamer]] and getting ready to travel back to Mississippi, Schwerner learned their station wagon had been found burned, in a swamp.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Schwerner returned to Mississippi, for safety "staying [at a] black-owned hotel, with a guard organized by black ministers keeping watch outside."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Schwerner spoke actively, pressing [[Lyndon B. Johnson|President Johnson]] to expand the federal government's efforts to find them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-06-24/news/mn-1892_1_goodman-and-schwerner-rita-schwerner-bender-andrew-goodman|title=Rights Martyrs' Relatives Speak Bluntly to Bush|last=Lauter|first=David|date=June 24, 1989|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=August 3, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.historyisaweapon.com/defcon1/schwernertestimony.html&lt;/ref&gt; The national media covered the story in detail, and [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] posters went up for the three all over the country. In the wake of this national crisis and the disappearance of her husband,  Rita Schwerner was interviewed by the media in Meridian, Mississippi and gave this response to the situation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is tragic, as far as I am concerned, that white northerners have to be caught up in the machinery of injustice and indifference in the South. Before the American people register concern, I personally suspect that if Mr. Cheney, who is a native Mississippian negro, had been alone at the time of the disappearance that this case like so many other that have come before would have been completely unnoticed.&lt;ref&gt;Eyes on the Prize. Dir. Henry Hampton. Perf. Rita Schwerner. PBS, 1987. Online.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Soon it was discovered that Schwerner, Cheney, and Goodman had been murdered by the Ku Klux Klan. Sheriff Price was affiliated with the Klan and had participated in the murder.

Three years later, Price was convicted with the killing of the three men and was given six years in prison. He died in 2001 at the age of 63. While there were other Klan members involved in the murder, only six of them were convicted along with Price.&lt;ref&gt;Stout, David. "Cecil Price, 63, Deputy Guilty In Killing of 3 Rights Workers." The New York Times. The New York Times, 08 May 2001. Web. 17 Nov. 2015. https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/09/us/cecil-price-63-deputy-guilty-in-killing-of-3-rights-workers.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/01/12/577664811/edgar-ray-killen-dies-klansman-behind-civil-rights-workers-murders-in-1964&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continued civil rights activism===
After her husband's death, Schwerner stayed in Mississippi and continued to pursue civil rights work with the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]]. In particular she worked on an action "challeng[ing] the all-white Mississippi delegation" to the [[1964 Democratic National Convention]] in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]]: "Delegates used borrowed passes to march on the convention floor and were hauled away by guards, galvanizing Mississippi's black population. Rita Schwerner testivied [sic] before the credentials committee with Freedom Democratic Party members standing in silent tribute."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-06-22-civil-rights-widow_x.htm|title=Killen verdict shows race matters, victim's widow says|date=June 22, 2005|work=USAToday|last1=AP|accessdate=4 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law school and second marriage==

After her work in the Civil Right Movement, Schwerner decided to go to law school and become an attorney. She attended [[Rutgers School of Law–Camden|Rutgers School of Law]] in [[New Jersey]] in 1965, graduating three years after her husband was murdered. Out of 150 students in the graduating class of 1968, Schwerner was one of five women.&lt;ref name="superlawyers.com"/&gt; She later worked for the [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]].

While studying at Rutgers, she also met her second husband, William J. Bender.

==Current law practice==

Rita Schwerner Bender is now a private family practice attorney in Washington State.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.superlawyers.com/washington/article/the-truth-seeker/e0cdd093-6626-4a32-9a64-8a2afbf4a7e4.html&lt;/ref&gt; Her areas of specialty are family law, [[adoption]] and [[Assisted reproductive technology|assisted reproduction]], professional ethics and discipline, and "specializes in providing indigent defendants access to legal assistance."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Bender continues to be active in the fight for civil rights today, speaking on topics like "Searching for Restorative Justice: The Trial of Edgar Ray Killen" and "Racial Disparity in Education and State Action." Additionally, Bender has written or co-written several publications pertaining to her areas of law practice.  A few of her works are "FAQ: Surrogacy, Sperm Donation and Egg Donation in Washington for Prospective Gay and Lesbian Parents" (with Raegen N. Rasnic and Janet M. Helson) and "Washington State Legal Technician Rule: Myths and Facts," which appeared in the Washington State Bar news in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;"Rita L. Bender."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5402">This article describes '''shape analysis''' to analyze and process geometric [[shape]]s. 
The shape analysis described here is related to the [[statistical shape analysis|statistical analysis of geometric shapes]], to shape matching and shape recognition. It applies purely to the geometry of an object, not to the [[structural analysis]] that deals with predicted behaviour of mechanical parts.

==Description==
''Shape analysis'' is the (mostly){{Clarification needed|reason=|date=May 2017}} automatic analysis of geometric shapes, for example using a computer to detect similarly shaped objects in a database or parts that fit together. For a computer to automatically analyze and process geometric shapes, the objects have to be represented in a digital form. Most commonly a [[boundary representation]] is used to describe the object with its boundary (usually the outer shell, see also [[3D model]]). However, other volume based representations (e.g. [[constructive solid geometry]]) or point based representations ([[point cloud]]s) can be used to represent shape.

Once the objects are given, either by modeling ([[computer-aided design]]), by scanning ([[3D scanner]]) or by extracting shape from 2D or 3D images, they have to be simplified before a comparison can be achieved. The simplified representation is often called a ''shape descriptor'' (or fingerprint, signature). These simplified representations try to carry most of the important information, while being easier to handle, to store and to compare than the shapes directly.
A ''complete shape descriptor'' is a representation that can be used to completely reconstruct the original object (for example the [[medial axis]] transform).

==Application fields==
Shape analysis is used in many application fields:
*[[archeology]] for example, to find similar objects or missing parts
*[[architecture]] for example, to identify objects that spatially fit into a specific space
*[[medical imaging]] to understand shape changes related to illness or aid [[surgical planning]]
*[[Virtual reality|virtual environments]] or on the [[3D models|3D model market]] to identify objects for copyright purposes
*security applications such as face recognition
*entertainment industry (movies, games) to construct and process geometric models or animations
*[[computer-aided design]] and [[computer-aided manufacturing]] to process and to compare designs of mechanical parts or design objects.

==Shape descriptors==
Shape descriptors can be classified by their invariance with respect to the transformations allowed in the associated shape definition. Many descriptors are invariant with respect to ''congruency'', meaning that congruent shapes (shapes that could be translated, rotated and mirrored) will have the same descriptor (for example [[moment (mathematics)|moment]] or [[spherical harmonic]] based descriptors or [[Procrustes analysis]] operating on point clouds).

Another class of shape descriptors (called ''intrinsic'' shape descriptors) is invariant with respect to [[isometry]]. These descriptors do not change with different isometric embeddings of the shape. Their advantage is that they can be applied nicely to deformable objects (e.g. a person in different body postures) as these deformations do not involve much stretching but are in fact near-isometric. Such descriptors are commonly based on geodesic distances measures along the surface of an object or on other isometry invariant characteristics such as the [[Laplace-Beltrami operator|Laplace-Beltrami]] [[spectrum (functional analysis)|spectrum]] (see also [[spectral shape analysis]]).

There are other shape descriptors, such as ''graph-based'' descriptors like the [[medial axis]] or the [[Reeb graph]] that capture geometric and/or topological information and simplify the shape representation but can not be as easily compared as descriptors that represent shape as a vector of numbers.

From this discussion it becomes clear, that different shape descriptors target different aspects of shape and can be used for a specific application. Therefore, depending on the application, it is necessary to analyze how well a descriptor captures the features of interest.

In mathematics, a '''sheaf of planes''' is the set of all [[plane (geometry)|planes]] that have the same common [[line (geometry)|line]].&lt;ref name="def"&gt;[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SheafofPlanes.html Definition on ''Mathworld Wolfram'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sommerville|first1=D.

When extending the concept of line to the [[line at infinity]], a set of '''parallel planes''' can be seen as a ''sheaf of planes'' intersecting in a ''line at infinity''. To distinguish it from the more common definition the adjective ''parallel'' can be added to it, resulting in the expression: ''parallel sheaf of planes''.&lt;ref name="para"&gt;[http://www.vitutor.com/geometry/space/sheaf_planes.html Vitutor: Sheaf of Planes]&lt;/ref&gt;

Simulacra have long been of interest to philosophers. In his ''[[Sophist (dialogue)|Sophist]]'', [[Plato]] speaks of two kinds of image making. The first is a faithful reproduction, attempted to copy precisely the original. The second is intentionally distorted in order to make the copy appear correct to viewers. He gives the example of [[Art in ancient Greece|Greek statuary]], which was crafted larger on the top than on the bottom so that viewers on the ground would see it correctly. If they could view it in scale, they would realize it was malformed. This example from the visual arts serves as a [[metaphor]] for the philosophical arts and the tendency of some philosophers to distort truth so that it appears accurate unless viewed from the proper angle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Plato |title=The Sophist |others=Translated by Benjamin Jowett |url=http://philosophy.eserver.org/plato/sophist.txt |accessdate=2 May 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051230161511/http://philosophy.eserver.org/plato/sophist.txt |archivedate=30 December 2005 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] addresses the concept of simulacrum (but does not use the term) in the ''[[Twilight of the Idols]]'', suggesting that most philosophers, by ignoring the reliable input of their senses and resorting to the constructs of language and reason, arrive at a distorted copy of reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nietzsche |first=Friedrich |chapter=Reason in Philosophy |title=Twilight of the Idols |others=Translated by Walter Kaufmann and R.

[[Postmodernism/Philosophy|Postmodernist]] French [[social theorist]] [[Jean Baudrillard]] argues that a simulacrum is not a copy of the real, but becomes truth in its own right: the [[Hyperreality|hyperreal]]. Where Plato saw two types of representation—faithful and intentionally distorted (simulacrum)—Baudrillard sees four: (1) basic reflection of reality; (2) perversion of reality; (3) pretence of reality (where there is no model); and (4) simulacrum, which "bears no relation to any reality whatsoever".&lt;ref name="Simulacra and Simulations"&gt;[http://www.stanford.edu/dept/HPS/Baudrillard/Baudrillard_Simulacra.html Baudrillard Simulacra] retrieved 2 May 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040209024621/http://www.stanford.edu/dept/HPS/Baudrillard/Baudrillard_Simulacra.html |date=9 February 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Baudrillard's concept, like Nietzsche's, simulacra are perceived as negative, but another modern philosopher who addressed the topic, [[Gilles Deleuze]], takes a different view, seeing simulacra as the avenue by which an accepted [[Ideal (ethics)|ideal]] or "privileged position" could be "challenged and overturned".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Deleuze |first=Gilles |title=Difference and Repetition |others=Translated by Paul Patton |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=Columbia |year=1968 |pages=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deleuze defines simulacra as "those systems in which different relates to different ''by means of'' difference itself. What is essential is that we find in these systems no ''prior [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]]'', no ''internal resemblance''".&lt;ref&gt;p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alain Badiou]], in speaking with reference to Nazism about Evil, writes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Badiou |first=Alain |title=Ethics - An Essay on the Understanding of Evil|others=Translated by Peter Hallward |publisher=Verso |location=London |year=2001 |pages=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; "fidelity to a simulacrum, unlike fidelity to an event, regulates its break with the situation not by the universality of the void, but by the closed particularity of an abstract set ... (the 'Germans' or the 'Aryans')".

==Recreation==
Recreational simulacra include [[historical reenactment|reenactments of historical events]] or replicas of landmarks, such as [[Colonial Williamsburg]] and the [[Eiffel Tower]], and constructions of fictional or cultural ideas, such as [[Fantasyland]] at [[The Walt Disney Company]]'s [[Magic Kingdom]]. The various Disney parks have by some philosophers been regarded as the ultimate recreational simulacra, with Baudrillard noting that [[Walt Disney World Resort]] is a copy of a copy, "a simulacrum to the second power".&lt;ref&gt;Baudrillard, Jean. transl. Francois Debrix. Liberation. 4 March 1996. [http://www.egs.edu/faculty/jean-baudrillard/articles/disneyworld-company/ "Disneyworld Company."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527152759/http://www.egs.edu/faculty/jean-baudrillard/articles/disneyworld-company/ |date=27 May 2010 }} retrieved 5 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, Italian author [[Umberto Eco]] argued that at Disney's parks, "we not only enjoy a perfect imitation, we also enjoy the conviction that imitation has reached its apex and afterwards reality will always be inferior to it".&lt;ref&gt;Eco, Umberto. ''Travels in Hyperreality.'' Reproduced in relevant portion at
[http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~breslin/eco_robots.html "The City of Robots"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060912200642/http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~breslin/eco_robots.html |date=12 September 2006 }} retrieved 2 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; This is for some an ongoing concern. Examining the impact of Disney's simulacrum of [[national park]]s, [[Disney's Wilderness Lodge]], environmentalist Jennifer Cypher and [[anthropologist]] Eric Higgs expressed worry that "the boundary between artificiality and reality will become so thin that the artificial will become the centre of moral value".&lt;ref&gt;Cypher, Jennifer and Eric Higgs. [http://www.ethics.ubc.ca/papers/invited/cypher-higgs.html "Colonizing the Imagination: Disney's Wilderness Lodge".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704185846/http://www.ethics.ubc.ca/papers/invited/cypher-higgs.html |date=4 July 2007 }} retrieved 2 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Eco also refers to commentary on watching sports as sports to the power of three, or sports cubed. First, there are the players who participate in the sport (the real), then the onlookers merely witnessing it, and finally the commentary on the act of witnessing the sport. Visual artist [[Paul McCarthy]] has created entire installations based on ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' and theme park simulacra, with videos playing inside the installation.

==Caricature==
An interesting example of simulacrum is [[caricature]]. When an artist produces a line drawing that closely approximates the facial features of a real person, the subject of the sketch cannot be easily identified by a random observer; it can be taken for a likeness of any individual. However, a caricaturist exaggerates prominent facial features, and a viewer will pick up on these features and be able to identify the subject, even though the caricature bears far less actual resemblance to the subject.

==Iconography==
Beer (1999: p.&amp;nbsp;11) employs the term "simulacrum" to denote the formation of a sign or iconographic image, whether [[iconic]] or [[aniconic]], in the landscape or greater field of [[Thangka]] art and Tantric Buddhist [[iconography]]. For example, an iconographic [[Representation (arts)|representation]] of a cloud formation sheltering a deity in a thanka or covering the auspice of a [[sacred mountain]] in the natural environment may be discerned as a simulacrum of an "auspicious canopy" (Sanskrit: [[Chhatra]]) of the [[Ashtamangala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beer |first=Robert |year=1999 |title=The Encyclopedia of Tibetan Symbols and Motifs |publisher=Shambhala Publications |isbn=978-1-57062-416-2 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Perceptions of religious imagery in natural phenomena]] approach a [[cultural universal]] and may be proffered as evidence of the natural creative spiritual engagement of the experienced environment endemic to the [[human psychology]].

==Word usage==
The Latinised plural ''simulacra'' is interchangeable with the anglicised version ''simulacrums''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/simulacrum |title=simulacrum |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=12 April 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150712155454/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/simulacrum |archivedate=12 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

SDO is conceptualized as a measure of individual differences in levels of group-based discrimination; that is, it is a measure of an individual's preference for [[hierarchy]] within any [[social system]] and the domination over lower-status groups. It is a predisposition toward anti-[[egalitarianism]] within and between groups. The concept of SDO as a measurable individual difference is a product of [[social dominance theory]].

Individuals who score high in SDO desire to maintain and, in many cases, increase the differences between [[social status]]es of different groups, as well as individual group members. Typically, they are dominant, driven, tough, and seekers of [[Power (social and political)|power]]. People high in SDO also prefer hierarchical group orientations. Often, people who score high in SDO adhere strongly to belief in a "[[wiktionary:dog eat dog|dog-eat-dog]]" world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0146167202282002 |title=Social Dominance Orientation and Intergroup Bias: The Legitimation of Favoritism for High-Status Groups |year=2002 |last1=Levin |first1=S. |last2=Federico |first2=C.

==Social dominance theory==

SDO was first proposed by Jim Sidanius and Felicia Pratto as part of their [[social dominance theory]] (SDT).  SDO is the key measurable component of SDT that is specific to it.

SDT begins with the empirical observation that surplus-producing social systems have a threefold group-based hierarchy structure: age-based, gender-based and "arbitrary set-based", which can include race, class, sexual orientation, caste, ethnicity, religious affiliation, etc. Age-based hierarchies invariably give more power to adults and middle-age people than children and younger adults, and gender-based hierarchies invariably grant more power to one [[gender]] over others, but arbitrary-set hierarchies—though quite resilient—are truly arbitrary.

SDT is based on three primary assumptions:{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}
#While age- and gender-based hierarchies will tend to exist within all social systems, arbitrary-set systems of social hierarchy will invariably emerge within social systems producing sustainable economic surpluses.
#Most forms of group conflict and oppression (e.g., racism, homophobia, ethnocentrism, sexism, classism, regionalism) can be regarded as different manifestations of the same basic human predisposition to form group-based hierarchies.
#Human social systems are subject to the counterbalancing influences of hierarchy-enhancing (HE) forces, producing and maintaining ever higher levels of group-based social inequality, and hierarchy-attenuating (HA) forces, producing greater levels of group-based social equality.

SDO is the individual attitudinal aspect of SDT.  It is influenced by group status, socialization, and temperament.  In turn, it influences support for HE and HA "legitimating myths", defined as "values, attitudes, beliefs, causal attributions and ideologies" that in turn justify social institutions and practices that either enhance or attenuate group hierarchy.

==Early development==
While the correlation of gender with SDO scores has been empirically measured and confirmed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.2044-8309.1997.tb01118.x |title=The gender gap: Differences in political attitudes and social dominance orientation |year=1997 |last1=Pratto |first1=Felicia |last2=Stallworth |first2=Lisa M. |last3=Sidanius |first3=Jim |journal=British Journal of Social Psychology |volume=36 |pages=49–68 |pmid=9114484}}&lt;/ref&gt; the impact of temperament and socialization is less clear. Duckitt has suggested a model of attitude development for SDO, suggesting that unaffectionate socialisation in childhood causes a tough-minded attitude.  According to Duckitt's model, people high in tough-minded personality are predisposed to view the world as a competitive place in which resource competition is [[zero-sum]]. A desire to compete, which fits with social dominance orientation, influences in-group and outside-group attitudes. People high in SDO also believe that hierarchies are present in all aspects of society and are more likely to agree with statements such as "It's probably a good thing that certain groups are at the top and other groups are at the bottom". In turn, SDO predicts stereotyping, discrimination and prejudice.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Scale==

SDO has been measured by a series of scales that have been refined over time, all of which contain a balance of pro- and contra-trait statements or phrases. A 7-point [[Likert scale]] is used for each item; participants rate their agreement or disagreement with the statements from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).  Most of the research was conducted with the SDO-5 (a 14-point scale) and SDO-6. The SDO-7 scale is the most recent scale measuring social dominance orientation, which embeds two sub-dimensions: dominance (SDO-D) and anti-egalitarianism (SDO-E).&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ho|first=Arnold K.|last2=Sidanius|first2=Jim|last3=Kteily|first3=Nour|last4=Sheehy-Skeffington|first4=Jennifer|last5=Pratto|first5=Felicia|last6=Henkel|first6=Kristin E.|last7=Foels|first7=Rob|last8=Stewart|first8=Andrew L.|title=The nature of social dominance orientation: Theorizing and measuring preferences for intergroup inequality using the new SDO₇ scale.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=109|issue=6|pages=1003–1028|doi=10.1037/pspi0000033|pmid=26479362|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms of the construct==
Rubin and Hewstone (2004)&lt;ref name=Rubin2004&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9221.2004.00400.x |title=Social Identity, System Justification, and Social Dominance: Commentary on Reicher, Jost et al., and Sidanius et al |year=2004 |last1=Rubin |first1=Mark |last2=Hewstone |first2=Miles |journal=Political Psychology |volume=25 |issue=6 |pages=823–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that social dominance research has changed its focus dramatically over the years, and these changes have been reflected in different versions of the social dominance orientation construct. Social dominance orientation was originally defined as "the degree to which individuals desire social dominance and superiority for themselves and their primordial groups over other groups" (p.&amp;nbsp;209).&lt;ref name=Sidanius1993&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sidanius |first1=James |chapter=The psychology of group conflict and the dynamics of oppression: A social dominance perspective |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=Io8pP8ihLg4C&amp;pg=PA183 |editor1-last=Iyengar |editor1-first=Shanto |editor2-last=McGuire |editor2-first=William James |year=1993 |title=Explorations in political psychology.

==Group-based and individual dominance==

Robert Altemeyer said that people with a high SDO want more power (agreeing with items such as "''Winning is more important than how you play the game''") and are more [[Machiavellianism|Machiavellian]] (manipulative and amoral, agreeing with items such as "''There really is no such thing as'' 'right and wrong' and  ''It all boils down to what you can get away with''").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://members.shaw.ca/jeanaltemeyer/drbob/TheAuthoritarians.pdf |title=The Authoritarians |page=166 |last=Altemeyer |first=Robert |authorlink=Bob Altemeyer |year=2006 |format=PDF |accessdate=20 March 2016}}{{page needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These observations are at odds with conceptualisations of SDO as a group-based phenomenon, suggesting that the SDO reflects interpersonal dominance, not only group-based dominance. This is supported by Sidanius and Pratto's own evidence that high-SDO individuals tend to gravitate toward hierarchy-enhancing jobs and institutions, such as law enforcement, that are themselves hierarchically structured vis-a-vis individuals within them.

==Relations with other personality traits==

===Connection with right wing authoritarianism===

SDO correlates weakly with [[right-wing authoritarianism]] (RWA) ([[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|r]] ≈ .18).&lt;ref name=pratto /&gt; Both predict attitudes, such as [[sexist]], [[racist]], and [[Heterosexism|heterosexist]] attitudes.&lt;ref name=Sibley2006&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9221.2006.00531.x |title=Social Dominance Orientation and Right-Wing Authoritarianism: Additive and Interactive Effects |year=2006 |last1=Sibley |first1=Chris G. |last2=Robertson |first2=Andrew |last3=Wilson |first3=Marc S. |journal=Political Psychology |volume=27 |issue=5 |pages=755–68 |jstor=3792537}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two contribute to different forms of prejudice; SDO correlates to higher prejudice against subordinate and disadvantaged groups, RWA correlates to higher prejudice against threatening groups, while both are associated with increases in prejudice for "dissident" groups.&lt;ref name=crawford2013&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.2012.00990.x |title=Right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation differentially predict biased evaluations of media reports |year=2013 |last1=Crawford |first1=Jarret T. |last2=Jussim |first2=Lee |last3=Cain |first3=Thomas R. |last4=Cohen |first4=Florette |journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology |volume=43 |pages=163–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Duckitt2007&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/per.614 |title=Right wing authoritarianism, social dominance orientation and the dimensions of generalized prejudice |year=2007 |last1=Duckitt |first1=John |last2=Sibley |first2=Chris G. |journal=European Journal of Personality |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=113–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Asbrock2009&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/per.746 |title=Right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation and the dimensions of generalized prejudice: A longitudinal test |year=2009 |last1=Asbrock |first1=Frank |last2=Sibley |first2=Chris G. |last3=Duckitt |first3=John |journal=European Journal of Personality |pages=324–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; SDO and RWA contribute to [[prejudice]] in an additive rather than interactive way (the interaction{{clarify|date=May 2012}} of SDO and RWA accounted, in one study, for an average of less than .001% variance in addition to their linear combination), that is the association between SDO and prejudice is similar regardless of a person's level of RWA, and vice versa.&lt;ref name=Sibley2006/&gt; Crawford et al. (2013) found that RWA and SDO differentially predicted interpretations of media reports about socially threatening (for example, gays and lesbians) and disadvantaged groups (for example, African Americans), respectively. Subjects with high SDO, but not RWA, scores reacted positively to articles and authors that opposed [[affirmative action]], and negatively to pro-affirmative-action article content. Moreover, RWA, but not SDO, predicted subjects' evaluations of same-sex relationships, such that high-RWA individuals favored anti-same-sex relationships article content and low-RWA individuals favorably rated pro-same-sex relationships content.&lt;ref name=crawford2013/&gt;

Studies on the relationship of SDO with the higher order [[Big Five personality traits]] have associated high SDO with lower [[openness to experience]] and lower [[agreeableness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/per.526|last1=Ekehammar|first1=Bo|last2=Akrami|first2=Nazar|last3=Gylje|first3=Magnus|last4=Zakrisson|first4=Ingrid|title=What matters most to prejudice: Big Five personality, Social Dominance Orientation, or Right-Wing Authoritarianism?|journal=European Journal of Personality|volume=18|issue=6|pages=463–482|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Meta-analysis|Meta-analytic]] aggregation of these studies indicates that the association with low Agreeableness is more robust than the link to Openness to experience.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Right-Wing Authoritarianism and Social Dominance Orientation|journal = Journal of Individual Differences|date = 2006-01-01|issn = 1614-0001|pages = 117–126|volume = 27|issue = 3|doi = 10.1027/1614-0001.27.3.117|first = Nazar|last = Akrami|first2 = Bo|last2 = Ekehammar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals low in Agreeableness are more inclined to report being motivated by self-interest and self-indulgence''.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Big-Five personality prospectively predicts Social Dominance Orientation and Right-Wing Authoritarianism|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886911003825|journal = Personality and Individual Differences|date = 2012-01-01|pages = 3–8|volume = 52|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2011.08.009|first = Ryan|last = Perry|first2 = Chris G.|last2 = Sibley}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also tend to be more self-centred and are more '[[Psychoticism|tough-minded]]' compared to those who are high on Agreeableness, leading them to perceive the world to be a highly-competitive place, where the way to success is through power and dominance – all of which predict SDO.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Personality and Prejudice: A Meta-Analysis and Theoretical Review|url = http://psr.sagepub.com/content/12/3/248|journal = Personality and Social Psychology Review|date = 2008-08-01|issn = 1088-8683|pmid = 18641385|pages = 248–279|volume = 12|issue = 3|doi = 10.1177/1088868308319226|first = Chris G.|last = Sibley|first2 = John|last2 = Duckitt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low Openness, by contrast, aligns more strongly with RWA; thinking in clear and straightforward moral codes that dictate how society as a system should function. Being low in Openness prompts the individual to value security, stability and control: fundamental elements of RWA.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Facet-level associations ====

In case of SDO all five facets of Agreeableness significantly correlate (negatively), even after controlling for RWA.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 'Tough-mindedness' (opposite of tender-mindedness' facet) is the strongest predictor of SDO. After the effect of SDO is controlled for only one facet of agreeableness is predictive of RWA. {{Citation needed|date = December 2015}} Facets also distinguish SDO from RWA, with  'Dominators' (individuals high on SDO), but not 'authoritarians' (individuals who score high on RWA), having been found to be lower in dutifulness, morality, sympathy and co-operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Right-wing authoritarianism, social dominance orientation and personality: an analysis using the IPIP measure|journal = European Journal of Personality|date = 2001-01-01|issn = 1099-0984|pages = 49–56|volume = 15|issue = 1|doi = 10.1002/per.389|first = Patrick C. L.|last = Heaven|first2 = Sandra|last2 = Bucci}}&lt;/ref&gt; RWA is also associated with religiosity, conservativism, righteousness, and, to some extent, a conscientious moral code, which distinguishes RWA from SDO.

=== Empathy ===
SDO is inversely related to [[empathy]]. Facets of Agreeableness that are linked to [[altruism]], sympathy and compassion are the
strongest predictors of SDO.&lt;ref name="pratto" /&gt; SDO has been suggested to have a link with callous affect (which is to be found on the [[psychopathy]] sub-scale), the 'polar opposite' of empathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The role of "dark personalities" (narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy), Big Five personality factors, and ideology in explaining prejudice|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656609000658|journal = Journal of Research in Personality|date = 2009-08-01|pages = 686–690|volume = 43|issue = 4|doi = 10.1016/j.jrp.2009.02.005|first = Gordon|last = Hodson|first2 = Sarah M.|last2 = Hogg|first3 = Cara C.|last3 = MacInnis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between SDO and ''(lack of)'' empathy has been found to be reciprocal &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = You're Inferior and Not Worth Our Concern: The Interface Between Empathy and Social Dominance Orientation|journal = Journal of Personality|date = 2013-06-01|issn = 1467-6494|pages = 313–323|volume = 81|issue = 3|doi = 10.1111/jopy.12008|pmid = 23072294|first = Jim|last = Sidanius|first2 = Nour|last2 = Kteily|first3 = Jennifer|last3 = Sheehy-Skeffington|first4 = Arnold K.|last4 = Ho|first5 = Chris|last5 = Sibley|first6 = Bart|last6 = Duriez}}&lt;/ref&gt; – with equivocal findings. Some studies show that empathy significantly impacts SDO,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Structural Modeling of Generalized Prejudice|journal = Journal of Individual Differences|date = 2007-01-01|issn = 1614-0001|pages = 10–17|volume = 28|issue = 1|doi = 10.1027/1614-0001.28.1.10|first = Martin|last = Bäckström|first2 = Fredrik|last2 = Björklund}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas other research suggest the opposite effect is more robust; that SDO predicts empathy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The latter showcases how powerful of a predictor SDO may be, not only affecting individual's certain behaviours, but potentially influencing upstream the
proneness to those behaviours. It also suggests, that those scoring high on SDO proactively avoid scenarios that could prompt
them to be more empathetic or tender-minded. This avoidance decreases concern for other's welfare.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Empathy indirectly affects generalized [[prejudice]] through its negative relationship with SDO.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It also
has a direct effect on generalized prejudice, as lack of empathy makes one unable to put oneself in the other person's shoes, which predicts prejudice and antidemocratic views.

==Correlation with conservative political views==

Felicia Pratto and her colleagues have found evidence that a high social dominance orientation is strongly correlated with [[conservatism|conservative]] political views, and opposition to programs and policies that aim to promote equality (such as [[affirmative action]], laws advocating [[Civil rights|equal rights]] for [[homosexuals]], women in combat, etc.).&lt;ref name=pratto&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.67.4.741 |title=Social dominance orientation: A personality variable predicting social and political attitudes |year=1994 |last1=Pratto |first1=Felicia |last2=Sidanius |first2=Jim |last3=Stallworth |first3=Lisa M. |last4=Malle |first4=Bertram F. |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=67 |issue=4 |pages=741–63|url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:3207711 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been some debate within the psychology community on what the relation is between SDO and racism/sexism. One explanation suggests that opposition to programs that promote equality need not be based on racism or sexism but on a "principled conservatism",&lt;ref name=sidanius96&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.70.3.476 |title=Racism, conservatism, Affirmative Action, and intellectual sophistication: A matter of principled conservatism or group dominance? |year=1996 |last1=Sidanius |first1=Jim |last2=Pratto |first2=Felicia |last3=Bobo |first3=Lawrence |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=70 |issue=3 |pages=476–90|citeseerx=10.1.1.474.1114 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that is, a "concern for [[Equality of opportunity|equity]], [[Color blindness (race)|color-blindness]], and genuine conservative values".

Some principled-conservatism theorists have suggested that racism and conservatism are independent, and only very weakly correlated among the highly educated, who truly understand the concepts of conservative values and attitudes. In an effort to examine the relationship between education, SDO, and racism, Sidanius and his colleagues&lt;ref name=sidanius96 /&gt; asked approximately 4,600 Euro-Americans to complete a survey in which they were asked about their political and social attitudes, and their social dominance orientation was assessed. "These findings contradict much of the case for the principled conservatism hypothesis, which maintains that political values that are largely devoid of racism, especially among highly educated people."  Contrary to what these theorists would predict, correlations among SDO, political conservatism, and racism were strongest among the most educated, and weakest among the least educated. Sidanius and his colleagues hypothesized&lt;ref name=sidanius96 /&gt; this was because the most educated conservatives tend to be more invested in the hierarchical structure of society and in maintaining the inequality of the [[status quo]] in society in order to safeguard their status.

==Culture==
SDO is typically measured as an individual personality construct.  However, cultural forms of SDO have been discovered on the macro level of society.&lt;ref name="Fischer 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9221.2012.00884.x |title=Cultural and Institutional Determinants of Social Dominance Orientation: A Cross-Cultural Meta-Analysis of 27 Societies |year=2012 |last1=Fischer |first1=Ronald |last2=Hanke |first2=Katja |last3=Sibley |first3=Chris G. |journal=Political Psychology |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=437–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discrimination, prejudice and stereotyping can occur at various levels of institutions in society, such as transnational corporations, government agencies, schools and criminal justice systems. The basis of this theory of societal level SDO is rooted in [[evolutionary psychology]], which states that humans have an evolved predisposition to express social dominance that is heightened under certain social conditions (such as group status) and is also mediated by factors such as individual personality and temperament. Democratic societies are lower in SDO measures&lt;ref name="Fischer 2012"/&gt; The more that a society encourages citizens to cooperate with others and feel concern for the welfare of others, the lower the SDO in that culture. High levels of national income and empowerment of women are also associated with low national SDO, whereas more traditional societies with lower income, male domination and more closed institutional systems are associated with a higher SDO. Individuals who are socialized within these traditional societies are more likely to internalize gender hierarchies and are less likely to challenge them.

==Biology and sexual differences==
The biology of SDO is unknown.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Plenty of evidence suggests that men tend to score higher on SDO than women, and this is true across different countries,
cultures, age-groups, classes, religions and educational levels.&lt;ref name="Sidanius1994" /&gt; Researchers argue for an
'invariance' in the difference between men and women's SDO; suggesting that even if all other factors were to be controlled for, the difference between men and women's SDO would still remain – this however in some cases is disproved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Inverse gender gap in Germany: Social dominance orientation among men and women|journal = [[International Journal of Psychology]] |date = 2011-02-01|issn = 1464-066X|pages = 33–45|volume = 46|issue = 1|doi = 10.1080/00207594.2010.491121|pmid = 22044131|first = Beate|last = Küpper|first2 = Andreas|last2 = Zick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From an evolutionary and biological perspective SDO facilitates men to be successful in their reproductive strategy through
achieving social power and control over other males and becoming desired mating partners for the opposite sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Political Psychology of Reproductive Strategies|url = http://pss.sagepub.com/content/11/1/57|journal = Psychological Science|date = 2000-01-01|issn = 0956-7976|pmid = 11228844|pages = 57–62|volume = 11|issue = 1|doi = 10.1111/1467-9280.00215|first = Felicia|last = Pratto|first2 = Peter|last2 = Hegarty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Males are observed to be more socially hierarchical, as indicated by speaking time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.2002.tb00814.x |title=Dominance as Expressed and Inferred Through Speaking Time |year=2002 |last1=Mast |first1=Marianne Schmid |journal=Human Communication Research |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=420–450}}&lt;/ref&gt; and yielding to interruptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0146167202281003 |title=Female Dominance Hierarchies: Are They Any Different from Males'? |year=2002 |last1=Mast |first1=M. S. |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |volume=28 |pages=29–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noting that males tend to have higher SDO scores than females, Sidanius and Pratto speculate that SDO may be influenced by hormones that differ between the sexes, namely [[androgen]]s, primarily [[testosterone]].  Male levels of testosterone are much higher than that of females.

Taking a socio-cultural perspective, it is argued that the gap between women and men in SDO is dependent upon [[Norm (social)|societal norms]] prescribing different expectations for [[gender role]]s of men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Gender Gaps in Sociopolitical Attitudes: A Social Psychological Analysis.|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|pages = 796–816|volume = 87|issue = 6|doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.87.6.796|first = Alice H.|last = Eagly|first2 = Amanda B.|last2 = Diekman|first3 = Mary C.|last3 = Johannesen-Schmidt|first4 = Anne M.|last4 = Koenig|pmid=15598107|year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men are expected to be dominant and assertive, whereas women are supposed to be submissive and tender.

Differences between male and female attributional cognitive complexity is suggested contribute to the gender gap in SDO.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Gender Differences in Social Dominance Orientation: The Role of Cognitive Complexity|journal = Sex Roles|date = 2010-04-15|issn = 0360-0025|pages = 684–692|volume = 62|issue = 9–10|doi = 10.1007/s11199-010-9775-5|first = Rob|last = Foels|first2 = Landon D.|last2 = Reid}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women have been found to be more attributionally complex compared to men; they use more contextual information and evaluate social information more precisely. It is proposed that lower social status prompts higher cognitive complexity in order to compensate for the lack of control in that social situation by processing it more attentively and evaluating it more in depth. The difference in cognitive complexity between high and low status individuals could contribute to the differences between male and female SDO.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12271">'''Svātantrya''' (from the [[Sanskrit]] ''sva'' meaning ''self'' and ''tantram'' meaning ''dependence''&lt;ref name="Siva Sutras - Jaideva Singh, p. 9"&gt;Siva Sutras&amp;nbsp;– Jaideva Singh, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– 'self-dependency', or '[[free will]]') is the [[Kashmir Shaivism|Kashmiri Shaivite]] concept of divine sovereignty. ''Svātantrya'' is described as an energy that emanates from the Supreme (''Paramaśiva''),&lt;ref&gt;Siva Sutras&amp;nbsp;– Jaideva Singh, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; a wave of motion inside consciousness (''spanda'') that acts as the fundament of the world,&lt;ref&gt;Siva Sutras&amp;nbsp;– Jaideva Singh, p. 262&lt;/ref&gt; or in another view, the original word ([[logos]], pārāvak).&lt;ref name="J. Singh p. 16"&gt;Pratyabhijnahrdayam&amp;nbsp;– J. Singh, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; It does not use any external instrument&lt;ref&gt;The Pratyabhijna Philosophy&amp;nbsp;– G.V. Tagare, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; as it itself is the first stage of creation.

In antithesis with the [[Vedanta|Vedantic]] concept of [[Brahman]], which is a mere conscious witness without effective power, being inflicted by the illusory power (or ''[[Maya (illusion)|maya]]'' of the Brahman), in the Kashmiri Shaivite viewpoint creation is actively willed into existence by the supreme consciousness (''[[Śiva]]'') by the means of his irresistible will-force (''Svātantrya'').&lt;ref name="Siva Sutras - Jaideva Singh, p. 9"/&gt; This is an important aspect of the [[Pratyabhijna]] school of ''Kashmir Shaivism''.

''Svātantrya'' is a concept that goes to the root of many spiritual matters in Kashmir Shaivism,&lt;ref&gt;The Mirror of Self-Supremacy or Svatantrya-Darpana&amp;nbsp;– B.N. Pandit, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; like, the divine sovereignty of ''Śiva'' (God),&lt;ref&gt;History of Kashmir Saivism&amp;nbsp;– B.N. Pandit, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; consciousness (''caitanya''), creative power (''vimarśa''), [[mantra|mantric efficiency]] and ''[[Kundalini energy|Kundalini]]''.

==Divine sovereignty==
In its acception of divine sovereignty, ''svātantrya'' is described as an absolute power of action, or, absolute power of freedom.&lt;ref&gt;The Trika Saivism of Kashmir&amp;nbsp;– M.L. Pandit, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; This power arises from the mirror-like ability of the supreme consciousness (''caitanya'') to contain images (''vimarśa'')&lt;ref name="Siva Sutras - Jaideva Singh, p. 9"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Triadic mysticism&amp;nbsp;– P.E. Murphy, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– the whole universe being a mere image shining inside this unique god-consciousness.

''Svātantrya'' has a number of traditional attributes such as: perfect fullness (of the energy of will),&lt;ref name="Vac&amp;nbsp;– Andre Padoux, p. 247"&gt;Vac&amp;nbsp;– Andre Padoux, p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; self-sufficiency,&lt;ref name="J. Singh p. 7"&gt;Pratyabhijnahrdayam&amp;nbsp;– J. Singh, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; autodetermination,&lt;ref name="J. Singh p. 7"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shiva Sutras&amp;nbsp;– Swami Lakshmanjoo, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; the power of doing and undoing&amp;nbsp;– essence of the subject,&lt;ref&gt;Shiva Sutras&amp;nbsp;– Swami Lakshmanjoo, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; supreme creativity,&lt;ref name="Siva Sutras - Jaideva Singh, p. 9"/&gt; sovereignty,&lt;ref name="Siva Sutras - Jaideva Singh, p. 9"/&gt; source of knowledge (''jñāna'') and action (''kriyā'')&lt;ref name="Siva Sutras - Jaideva Singh, p. 9"/&gt; and being beyond contradictions:&lt;ref name="J. Singh p. 122"&gt;Pratyabhijnahrdayam&amp;nbsp;– J. Singh, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; it exists beyond laws of any kind and is the source of all laws in the universe.

==Supreme creative energy==
The Kashmir Shaivism theory of creation affirms that the world was willed into existence by the sovereign force of ''Śiva''. Thus, the world has no external causes outside ''Śiva's Svātantrya''.&lt;ref&gt;Towards Transcendence&amp;nbsp;– M.L. Pandit, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pratyabhijnahrdayam&amp;nbsp;– J. Singh, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Pratyabhijna Philosophy&amp;nbsp;– G.V. Tagare, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; This power creates multiplicity (''māyā'') from the original unity of the absolute,&lt;ref name="J. Singh p. 17"&gt;Pratyabhijnahrdayam&amp;nbsp;– J. Singh, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abhinavaguptas commentary on the Bhagavad Gita&amp;nbsp;– B. Marjanovic, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; and as such, it exists inside and beyond ''māyā''.&lt;ref&gt;Pratyabhijnahrdayam&amp;nbsp;– J. Singh, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; It is the seed of the universe,&lt;ref&gt;Shiva Sutras&amp;nbsp;– Swami Lakshmanjoo, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; the matrix (''mātrkā'') of generative phonemes,&lt;ref&gt;Shiva Sutras&amp;nbsp;– Swami Lakshmanjoo, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; the ultimate creative force.&lt;ref&gt;The Stanzas on Vibration&amp;nbsp;– M.S.G. Dyczkowski, p. 345&lt;/ref&gt;

==In relation to consciousness==
Disclaimer: on this topic there is a certain amount of melding and unification of the seemingly distinct concepts of will, freedom, consciousness, speech and bliss in the speciality texts. This is due to the insufficient ability of common language to describe the mystical states of consciousness.

The ''prakāśa-vimarśa'' theory affirms the world is based on two principles: the self shining conscious light (''[[Prakasa|prakāśa]]'')  and its ability to contain a reflection of itself and of the creation (''vimarśa'').&lt;ref&gt;Doctrine of Divine Recognition&amp;nbsp;– K.C. Pandey, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Swami Lakshmanjoo p. 110"&gt;Shiva Sutras&amp;nbsp;– Swami Lakshmanjoo, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;  To reflect itself is to know absolute bliss (''ānanda'')&amp;nbsp;– thus, free will (''svātantrya''), conscious reflection (''vimarśa'') and bliss (''ānanda'') are three concepts describing the same reality.&lt;ref name="J. Singh p. 7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vac - Andre Padoux, p. 247"&gt;Vac - Andre Padoux, p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; Bliss (''ānanda'') is the internal state of consciousness, its natural state. The same is true of svātantrya: it too is a fundamental quality of the subject.&lt;ref name="J. Singh p. 122"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Towards Transcendence&amp;nbsp;– M.L. Pandit, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pratyabhijnahrdayam&amp;nbsp;– J. Singh, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

Svātantrya is the first stage of creation, an undifferentiated energy, or, looking from bottom up, we could also say that it is the force that unifies all the energies of creation&lt;ref&gt;Shiva Sutras&amp;nbsp;– Swami Lakshmanjoo, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; The first creation of ''svātantrya'' is the energy of will (''icchā śakti''). Then come the energies of knowledge (''jñāna śakti'') and action (''kriyā śakti'') and together with the energy of consciousness (''cit śakti'') and the energy of bliss (''ānanda śakti'') they form the supreme pentad of creation, the so-called "pure creation".&lt;ref&gt;Siva Sutras&amp;nbsp;– Jaideva Singh, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shiva Sutras&amp;nbsp;– Swami Lakshmanjoo, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

Everything related to consciousness is also related to ''svātantrya''. Speech is seen in Kashmir Shaivism as differentiated in four classes : external (''vaikharī''), mental (''madhyamā''), subtle (''paśyanti'') and supreme (''parā''). ''Svātantrya'' is equated to ''pārāvak'', the creative [[logos]] / ''logos spermatikos''.&lt;ref name="J. Singh p. 16"/&gt;

==In relation to mystical practices==
In the mystical practices of Kashmir Shaivism, ''svātantrya'' is both the sovereign will of ''Śiva'', solely deciding the descent of divine grace (''[[śaktipāt]]'') and the will of the adept as he becomes more and more submerged into the divine.

According to Kashmir Shaivism, spiritual realization is more than a state of illumination (defined as ''pure witness'', ''non-dual consciousness'' or ''atma-vyapti'').&lt;ref&gt;Siva Sutras&amp;nbsp;– Jaideva Singh, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; Full spiritual realization means to know bliss (''ānanda'') and to control the energies (''śakti'') and the mantras&lt;ref&gt;Shiva Sutras&amp;nbsp;– Swami Lakshmanjoo, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; (or, the so-called ''śiva-vyāpti''). The root of spiritual efficiency is ''svātantrya'', the operative, dynamic aspect of the absolute.

An adept who reaches spiritual illumination needs to learn how to stabilize his experience. The Kashmir Shaivism scriptures declare that stability is based on the assimilation of the energy of ''svātantrya''.&lt;ref name="Siva Sutras - Jaideva Singh, p. 149"&gt;Siva Sutras&amp;nbsp;– Jaideva Singh, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, while the incipient practitioner aims for the experience of the nondual consciousness, the advanced ones focus on the assimilation of all the energies into non-duality. ''Svātantrya'' being the root of all energies, it becomes automatically the final step of the spiritual practice.&lt;ref name="Siva Sutras - Jaideva Singh, p. 149"/&gt;

The will of such an advanced practitioner becomes more and more efficient as it identifies with the will of ''Śiva''. Yet, his actions are necessarily without base in egoism (without the attributes of good or bad)&lt;ref&gt;Shiva Sutras&amp;nbsp;– Swami Lakshmanjoo, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– and this is an attitude that defines the discipline of [[karma yoga]].

All the spiritual paths (''upāyas''): that of Śiva (''śāmbhavopāya''), that of Śakti (''śāktopāya'') and that of the man (''āṇavopāya'') are subsumed under the umbrella of ''svātantrya'' as it is the sole mediator of divine grace.&lt;ref&gt;Shiva Sutras&amp;nbsp;– Swami Lakshmanjoo, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; The adept who has attained ''svātantrya'' is beyond the need for formal meditation&amp;nbsp;– that is&amp;nbsp;– for him to meditate or to act in everyday life is identical&amp;nbsp;– he does all his actions from a state of perfect unity with ''Śiva'' from now on. This is the culmination of the Kashmiri Shaivite spiritual practice.&lt;ref&gt;Shiva Sutras&amp;nbsp;– Swami Lakshmanjoo, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Such an adept does not exert himself in maintaining this state of consciousness because it is his own nature. From his point of view, everything is made of just forms of consciousness, his own consciousness, also identified with the consciousness of ''Śiva'' at this stage. The energy he possesses is the risen form of [[Kundalini energy|Kundalini]].&lt;ref&gt;The Aphorisms of Siva&amp;nbsp;– M.S.G. Dyczkowski, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; His mantras have spiritual efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;The Aphorisms of Siva&amp;nbsp;– M.S.G. Dyczkowski, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; His heart (''hṛdaya'') is the receptacle of all objects.&lt;ref&gt;Abhinavaguptas commentary on the Bhagavad Gita&amp;nbsp;– B. Marjanovic, p. 305&lt;/ref&gt;

Kashmir Shaivism doctrine affirms that nothing can compel ''Śiva'' to bestow the final spiritual realization&amp;nbsp;– it is solely based on the unconditioned ''svātantrya'', or, from the opposite perspective, there is no obstacle that can separate the disciple from becoming one with ''Śiva'' because he has ''svātantrya'' which is the ultimate power that cannot be impeded by anything.&lt;ref&gt;Shiva Sutras&amp;nbsp;– Swami Lakshmanjoo, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in Kashmir Shaivism there is this paradoxical concept that nothing needs to be done, as the supreme realization can appear without effort, but also, no matter what effort one undergoes, he cannot compel ''Śiva'' to liberate his self (''ātman'').&lt;ref&gt;The Himalayan mysticism&amp;nbsp;– [[R. Nataraj]], p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, this is not an invitation to abandon hard work but a justification for humility.

In a meditation prescribed in [[Vijnana Bhairava|Vijñana Bhairava Tantra]], one is supposed to unite his vital energy (''[[prana|prāṇa]]'') with ''svātantrya'' in the mystical force center that exists 12 finger widths above the head, ''dvadaśānta''.&lt;ref&gt;Vijnana Bhairava&amp;nbsp;– Swami Lakshman Joo, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative names==
''Svātantrya'' has a number of synonyms such as: ''maheśvaraya'' (from maheśvara which means supreme lord),&lt;ref name="J. Singh p. 17"/&gt; or ''aiśvarya'' (similarly, from the word Iśvara which also means Lord).&lt;ref&gt;Pratyabhijnahrdayam&amp;nbsp;– J. Singh, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; It has been personalized as the Goddess (''[[Devi]]''),&lt;ref&gt;Shiva Sutras&amp;nbsp;– Swami Lakshmanjoo, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; the virginal feminine deity ''[[Parvati|Uma]]'' (virginity being a symbol of existence outside the reach of the profane world)&lt;ref&gt;Siva Sutras&amp;nbsp;– Jaideva Singh, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; and the playful goddess ''Kumārī''.&lt;ref&gt;Shiva Sutras&amp;nbsp;– Swami Lakshmanjoo, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; Other scriptures also refer to ''svātantrya'' as the ''Glory of Siva''&lt;ref name="Swami Lakshmanjoo p. 110"/&gt; on account of it being identical to the 'ocean' of uncreated light (''prakāśa'') and cosmic bliss (''ānanda'')&amp;nbsp;– ''cidānanda-Ghana''.

==History==

The business was established in 2006 by Jeff Fairhall and Joe Whinney in the [[Fremont, Seattle|Fremont]] neighborhood of Seattle. The business is located in a [[Fremont Trolley Barn|former brewery building and trolleycar depot]] at 3400 Phinney Avenue.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Jeff Fairhall, the founder of Seattle's Essential Baking Company, invested in the establishment of Theo Chocolate with Joe Whinney.&lt;ref name=richman&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.seattlepi.com/business/article/Jeff-Fairhall-1958-2007-Entrepreneur-pioneered-1250121.php |title=Jeff Fairhall, 1958-2007: Entrepreneur pioneered healthful food to go - seattlepi.com |first=Dan |last=Richman |work=seattlepi.com |date=19 September 2007 |accessdate=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fairhallobit"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2003894838_fairhallobit21m.html |title=Local News &amp;#124; Jeff Fairhall, owner of Essential Baking Co., dies at 49 |first=Susan |last=Gilmore |work=seattletimes.com |date=September 21, 2007 |accessdate=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was in his early 20s, Whinney volunteered with a small conservation foundation in Southern [[Belize]] that was looking at the way that communities cultivated their crops. He developed a passion for the [[Theobroma cacao]] plant and wanted to get into the business while supporting the farmers, and contacted 10 bean processors. One responded. While providing this business with organic materials and customers, Whinney was able to start saving up to found a chocolate business of his own.&lt;ref name=Fair/&gt;

The business struggled to find a good supply of organic cocoa beans and came to a halt in 2002. After finding an interested investor in [[Seattle, Washington]], the decision was made to build the Theo Chocolate factory, named after the Theobroma cacao tree.&lt;ref name= Fair /&gt;

From 2004 to 2006 Fairhall sold all of his other business interests, retaining only Theo Chocolate. He published more than 30 advertisements in ''[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]'' about various religious ideas, revelations, and conspiracy theories. He also mentioned his use of [[Psilocybin mushroom|magic mushrooms]].&lt;ref name=richman/&gt; Fairhall died of brain cancer in 2007.&lt;ref name=richman/&gt;

The '''transcendentals''' ({{lang-la|transcendentalia}}) are the properties of [[being]] that correspond to [[Trichotomy (philosophy)|three]] aspects of the human field of interest and are their ideals; [[science]] (''truth''), the [[arts]] (''beauty'') and [[religion]] (''goodness'').{{cn|date=February 2018}} Philosophical disciplines that study them are [[logic]], [[aesthetics]] and [[ethics]].

==History==
{{See also|Proto-Indo-European religion|Asha|Satya}}

[[Parmenides]] first inquired of the properties co-extensive with being.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diels–Kranz numbering system|DK]] fragment B 8&lt;/ref&gt; [[Socrates]], spoken through [[Plato]], then followed (see ''[[Form of the Good]]'').

[[Aristotle]]'s [[substance theory]] (being a substance belongs to being ''qua'' being) has been interpreted as a theory of transcendentals.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'' 1028b4; Allan Bäck, ''Aristotle's Theory of Abstraction'', Springer, 2014, p. 210: "Since all that is, in any [[Categories (Aristotle)|category]] is in virtue of having some relation to substance..., being a substance belongs to being ''qua'' being. Because of the centrality of substance for something to be, Aristotle says, "what is being is just the question what is substance." [''Metaph''. 1028b4] Given Aristotle’s account of focal meaning, it has turned out that x is a being only if x is a substance. Items in non-substantial categories are beings, secondarily, only given their being in substance. ... [Ι]n ''Metaphysics'' IV, Aristotle offers both transcendental and categorical items as proper subjects for first philosophy."&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle discusses only unity ("One") explicitly because it is the only transcendental intrinsically related to being, whereas truth and goodness relate to rational creatures.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'' X.1–2; Benedict Ashley, ''The Way toward Wisdom: An Interdisciplinary and Intercultural Introduction to Metaphysics'' (University of Notre Dame Press, 2006), p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Middle Ages]], [[Catholic philosopher]]s elaborated the thought that there exist transcendentals (''transcendentalia'') and that they transcended each of the ten Aristotelian [[Categories (Aristotle)|categories]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott MacDonald (ed.), ''Being and Goodness: The Concept of the Good in Metaphysics and Philosophical Theology'', Cornell University Press, 1991, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; A doctrine of the transcendentality of the good was formulated by [[Albert the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/transcendentals-medieval/ Medieval Theories of Transcendentals (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt; His pupil, [[Saint Thomas Aquinas]], posited five transcendentals: ''res, unum, aliquid, bonum, verum''; or "thing", "one", "something", "good", and "true".&lt;ref&gt;''Disputed Questions on Truth'', Q. 1 A. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  Saint Thomas derives the five explicitly as transcendentals,&lt;ref&gt;''De Veritate'', Q. 1 A.1''&lt;/ref&gt; though in some cases he follows the typical list of the transcendentals consisting of the One, the Good, and the True. The transcendentals are [[ontology|ontologically]] one and thus they are convertible: e.g., where there is truth, there is beauty and goodness also.

In [[Christian theology]] the transcendentals are treated in relation to [[theology proper]], the doctrine of [[God]]. The transcendentals, according to Christian doctrine, can be described as the ultimate desires of man. Man ultimately strives for perfection, which takes form through the desire for perfect attainment of the transcendentals. The [[Catholic Church]] teaches that God is Himself truth, goodness, and beauty, as indicated in the ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__PC.HTM ''Catechism of the Catholic Church''] references these three at Section 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Each transcends the limitations of place and time, and is rooted in being. The transcendentals are not contingent upon cultural diversity, religious doctrine, or personal ideologies, but are the objective properties of all that exists.

'''Tyāga''' ([[Sanskrit]]:  [[wikt:त्याग#Sanskrit|त्याग]]) is a [[Sanskrit]] word that means "sacrifice, giving up in generosity, forsaking, resigning" anything of value,&lt;ref&gt;Monier Monier-Williams, [http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/mw/0400/mw__0489.html Tyaga], Sanskrit English Dictionary, Oxford University Press, page 456&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary|author=V.S.Apte|publisher=Digital Dictionaries of South Asia|url=http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/search3advanced?dbname=apte&amp;query=tyaga&amp;matchtype=exact&amp;display=utf8}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as "renunciation" depending on the context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kapil N.

==Hinduism==

Tyāga or abandonment refers to giving up of all anxieties for enjoying the fruits of actions; through practice of this kind of ''tyāga'' infusing [[discipline]] in daily activities the momentary anxiety to enjoy fruits of actions is overcome. It is a [[Subjectivity|subjective]] renunciation of selfishness and desire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Managerial Ethics: Dilemmas in Decision Making|author=Poonam Sharma|publisher=SAGE|page=106|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lsWIy-T-0B4C&amp;pg=PA106&amp;dq=tyaga&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=baYAU8qbE8aAhAeavoCgBw&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=tyaga&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Yajna is Tyāga ''. The [[Vedic]] interpretation of renunciation (''tyāga '') of the fruits of ritual acts including&amp;nbsp;– ''agnistomena svargakāmo yajeta''&amp;nbsp;– "the desire for heaven", which renunciation is to be found expressed in the phrase&amp;nbsp;– ''agnaye idam na mama''&amp;nbsp;– "this is for Agni, not for me"&amp;nbsp;– pronounced by the yajamana at the time of the oblation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rituals and Mantras: Rules without meanings|author=Frits Staal|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=121|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=CKLxjjXqAsQC&amp;pg=PA179&amp;dq=tyaga+rig+veda&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DqkBU47VEtGI7Ab7soCYAw&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=tyaga%20rig%20veda&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tejobindu Upanishad]] belonging to Krishna- yajurveda explains that in  ''Tyāga'' ('renunciation') one abandons the manifestations or objects of the universe through the cognition of [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] that is  ''Sat'' and  ''Cit'' and this is practiced by the wise as the giver of immediate salvation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Thirty Minor Upanishads|author=IslamKatob|publisher=Islamic Books|page=79|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=CvXZ0j1UyAAC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;dq=tyaga+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=A7ABU-3yH4aO7Aa51YDQAg&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=tyaga%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Kaivalya Upanishad portrays the state of man on the way of renunciation (''tyāga'') as having become free of all attachment to the worldly and who, consequently knows and feels himself only as the one divine essence that lives in all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Sixty Upanishads of the Veda|author=Paul Deussen|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=791|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=XYepeIGUY0gC&amp;pg=PA975&amp;dq=tyaga+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=drUBU7SdK4TChAeiuoGoBw&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=tyaga%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tyaga of Bhagavad Gita===

[[Moksha]] consists in securing lasting freedom from the bondage of existence in the form of birth and death and realizing God who is no other than Bliss (Brahman). Chapter VIII of the [[Bhagavad Gita]] deals with [[Sannyasa]] and Tyāga, the Paths of Knowledge and Action that are means to the attainment of moksha. [[Krishna]] tells [[Arjuna]] that even though ''sannyāsa'' is understood as the giving up of all actions motivated by desires, and ''tyāga'' consists in relinquishing the fruit of all actions; that all actions are worth giving up because they contain a measure of evil that acts of sacrifice, charity and penance are not worth shunning, there are three kinds of ''Tyāga''&amp;nbsp;– ''Sattvika'', ''Rajasika'' and ''Tamasika'' (Sloka XVIII.4). Whereas acts of sacrifice, charity and penance, the purifiers of wise men, must be performed without attachment and hope of award, Krishna states - मोहात्तस्य परित्यागस्तामसः (the abandonment of prescribed duty through ignorance) is not advisable, it is the ''Tamasika'' form of  ''tyāga''; if it is owing to कायक्लेशभयात्तयजेत् (abandonment for fear of physical strain) then it is  ''Rajasika'' form; if it is&amp;nbsp;–

:कार्यमित्येव यत्कर्म नियतं क्रियतेऽर्जुन |
:सङंग त्यक्त्वा फलं चैव स त्यागः सात्त्विको मतः| (Sloka XVIII.9)

: "A prescribed duty which is performed simply because it has to be performed, giving up attachment and fruit, that alone has been recognized as the Sattvika form of renunciation. "

Thereafter, Arjuna is told about the marks of a Sattvika-man of renunciation and that since all actions cannot be given up in their entirety by anyone possessing a body, he alone, who abstains from prohibited actions and those that are motivated by desire and performs duties, renounces the fruit of actions is called a man of renunciation; no fruits of actions accrues for him (Sloka XVIII.11-12).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Srimadbhagavadgita Tattvavivecani|author=Jayadayal Goyandaka|publisher=Gita Press, Gorakhpur|pages=659–669|url= http://www.exoticindiaart.com/book/details/srimad-bhagavad-gita-tattvavivecani-english-commentary-IDE961/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the preceding discourses, Krishna had recommended to Arjuna actions which ought to be performed as duty (Ch.III.19); He told him to perform ordained actions (Ch.III.8), to be free from attachment (Ch.III.9,19 &amp; Ch.II.48), and to have no desire for the fruit of action (Ch.II.47); Krishna had recommended  ''Sattvika-tyāga''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Philosophy of the Bhagavad Gita: An Exposition|author=Chhaganlal G. Kaji|publisher=Genesis Publishing|page=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uwUiusoi0qQC&amp;pg=PA558&amp;dq=tyaga&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=baYAU8qbE8aAhAeavoCgBw&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=tyaga&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sannyasa and Tyāga===

[[Sannyasa]] literally means&amp;nbsp;– throwing away, absolute rejection, formal monastic life; in the [[Bhagavad Gita]], it means&amp;nbsp;– mental state of thorough-going renunciation, of uncompromising abandonment of all that is unfit and unworthy, of intense dispassion toward things of the world, both internal and external. Tyāga literally means&amp;nbsp;– abandonment, the turning from all that hinders the realization of the Self; in the [[Bhagavad Gita]], it means&amp;nbsp;– renunciation in the sense of relinquishment of the fruit of action. Sannyāsa is external, even though it is based on internal disposition; Tyāga is completely mental, it is a state of thought and attitude. Arjuna is emphatically told that it is possible to act and accrue no karma whatsoever; it is a matter of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bhagavad Gita: Commentary Full|author=IslamKotob|publisher=Islamic Books|page=248,250|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b387bE4Ok0oC&amp;pg=PA248&amp;dq=tyaga&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=f5gBU4WbLuev7QahtoC4CQ&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=tyaga&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this context, [[Chinmayananda]] remarks that abandonment is the true content of the status of renunciation&amp;nbsp;– ''sannyāsa'' without the  ''tyāga'' spirit is but an empty show; real abandonment is meant for rising to a nobler status of fulfilment, leading on to the ampler fields of expression, to fuller ways of living and to greater experiences of joy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Holy Geeta|author=Swami Chinmayananda|publisher=Chinmaya Mission|page=1127,1138|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eVw_Rff7m7AC&amp;pg=PA1138&amp;dq=tyaga&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=f5gBU4WbLuev7QahtoC4CQ&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=tyaga&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; And, [[Sri Aurobindo|Aurobindo]] explains that&amp;nbsp;– "Sannysa in the standing of the terminology of the sages means the laying aside of desirable actions. In that sense Tyāga, not Sannyasa, is the better way. It is not the desirable actions that must be laid aside, but the desire that gives them that character has to be put away from us... The spiritual transference of all works to the Master and his Shakti is the real sannyāsa in the teachings of the Gita.... The essence of renunciation, the true Tyāga, the true sannyāsa is not any rule of thumb of inaction but a disinterested soul, a selfless mind, the transition from ego to the free impersonal and spiritual nature. "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bhagavad Gita and its Message|author=Aurobindo|publisher=Lotus Press|pages=252–256|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=QnSE5zrNjVUC&amp;pg=PA252&amp;dq=tyaga&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=caEBU5KDGqvA7AaTroHoDw&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=tyaga&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Self-control|Self-discipline]] too becomes a form of  ''Sattvika-tyāga'', during the course of which exercise one has control over negative emotions and behaviours such as anger, greed and pride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bhagavad Gita on Effective Leadership|author=Pujan Roka|publisher=iUniverse|page=139|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PWw-tGKmEYgC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;dq=tyaga&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=baYAU8qbE8aAhAeavoCgBw&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=tyaga&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Bhagavad Gita]] projects action to serve as steps on the path of spiritual ascent, as an effective means to purify the mind through diligently cultivated mental discipline in action; the true fruit of Tyāga is an elevating sense of peace and fulfillment, even if it entails a bit of physical discomfort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Art of Making Man Part 2|author=Chinmayananda|publisher=Chinmaya Mission|page=339|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CSiiLlXehVUC&amp;pg=PA339&amp;dq=tyaga&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9KcAU5yVBs-ihgf9woCYDA&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=tyaga&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jainism==

According to [[Tattvartha Sutra]], an ascetic’s [[dharma]] consists of ten elements i.e. abstract virtues, which are&amp;nbsp;– ''ksama'' ('forebearance'), ''[[mardava]]'' ('humility'), ''arjava'' ('uprightness'), ''sauca'' ('desirelessness'), ''satya'' ('truthfulness'), ''samyama'' ('self-discipline'), ''tapas'' ('self-mortification'), ''tyaga'' ('renunciation'), ''akincanya'' ('poverty') and  ''brahmacharya'' ('celibacy'). [[Hemachandra]] has recognized only two of the ten ''pratyakhyanas'' viz. ''sanketa-pratyakhyana'' and  ''addha-pratyakhyana'', the former, which is of eight types, is symbolic and the devotee refrains from taking food for some time by which renunciation he recalls his mind to his religious duties; the latter, is ritualistic, also connected with abstention from or renouncing food, and has a set methodology to adopt. [[Ahimsa in Jainism|Ahimsa-vrata]] practiced by the  ''Svetambras'' refers to the renunciation of killing. Basically, there are five kinds of  ''tyāgas'' included in the eleven pratimās viz. ''sacitta-tyāga pratimā'', the stage of renouncing uncooked food; ''ārambha-tyāga pratimā'', the stage of abandonment of all professional activity; ''parigraha-tyāga pratimā'', the stage of transferring publicly one’s property to a son or relative; ''anumati-tyāga pratimā'', the stage of leaving the household and refraining from counselling in household matters, and  ''uddista-tyāga pratimā'', the stage of not eating food especially prepared for oneself i.e. the stage of seeking alms like a monk, commonly followed by  '' [[Śvētāmbara|Svetambras]] '', '' [[Digambara]]s '' and  ''Avasyaka-Curni''. [[Nemicandra]] gives a list of eighty-four asatanas which includes  ''sacittanām atayāga'' or failure to remove sentient objects and  ''ajive tyāga'' or failure to remove non-sentient objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jaina Yoga: A Survey of the Mediaeval Sarvakacaras|author=R.Williams|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages=34,69,173,227|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LLKcrIJ6oscC&amp;pg=PA173&amp;dq=tyaga&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=baYAU8qbE8aAhAeavoCgBw&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=tyaga&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''violent crime''' or '''crime of violence''' is a [[crime]] in which an offender or perpetrator uses or threatens to use force upon a victim. This entails both crimes in which the [[violence|violent]] act is the objective, such as murder or rape, as well as crimes in which violence is the means to an end. Violent crimes may, or may not, be committed with weapons. Depending on the jurisdiction, violent crimes may vary from homicide to harassment. Typically, violent criminals includes [[aircraft hijacking|aircraft hijackers]], [[bank robbers]], [[Robbery|muggers]], [[burglars]], [[terrorists]], [[carjackers]], [[rapists]], [[kidnappers]], [[torture]]rs, [[active shooter]]s, [[murderers]], [[gangsters]], [[drug cartels]], and others.

==Violent crime by country==

The comparison of violent [[crime statistics]] between countries is usually problematic, due to the way different countries classify crime.&lt;ref name=eurosb2010/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Segessenmann, Tanya [http://www.justice.govt.nz/pubs/reports/2002/intl-comparisons-crime/section-2.html Section 2 - International Comparisons of Recorded Violent Crime Rates for 2000], Research &amp; Evaluation Unit, Ministry of Justice, Wellington, New Zealand. 11 June 2002 Retrieved 23 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/Compiling-and-comparing-International-Crime-Statistics.html |title=Compiling and Comparing International Crime Statistics |publisher=Unodc.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/Crime_statistics |title=Crime statistics - Statistics Explained |publisher=Epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2013-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Valid comparisons require that similar [[crime|offence]]s between jurisdictions be compared. Often this is not possible, because crime statistics aggregate equivalent offences in such different ways that make it difficult or impossible to obtain a valid comparison. Depending on the jurisdiction, violent crimes may include: [[homicide]], [[murder]], [[assault]], [[manslaughter]], [[sexual assault]], [[rape]], [[robbery]], [[negligence]], [[endangerment]], [[kidnapping]] (abduction), [[extortion]], and [[harassment]]. Different countries also have different systems of recording and reporting crimes.

===Australia===
The first annual national survey of crime victimization in Australia, the Crime Victimisation Survey, was conducted in 2008-09.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/4530.0main+features100022012-13 |title=Crime Victimisation, Australia, 2012-13 |author=Australian Bureau of Statistics |date=2014-02-11 |website=abs.gov.au |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Personal crimes included in the survey are: 
*Physical assault
*Threatened assault (including face-to-face and non face-to-face)
*Robbery (including attempted)
*Sexual assault (including attempted)

In 2009, the Australian Standard Offence Classification (ASOC), which had no single category for violent crime, was replaced by the Australian and New Zealand Standard Offence Classification (ANZSOC). The ANZSOC also has no single category for violent crime, but the first 6 of its divisions involve offenses committed against a person: 
#Homicide and related offences;
#Acts intended to cause injury;
#Sexual assault and related offences;
#Dangerous or negligent acts endangering persons;
#Abduction, harassment and other offences against the person;
#Robbery, extortion and related offences.

===Canada===

Canada conducts an annual measure of crime incidences called the Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p2SV.pl?Function=getSurvey&amp;SDDS=3302 |title=Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR) |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2013-07-24 |website=statcan.gc.ca |publisher=Canada.gc.ca |accessdate=2014-06-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; UCR "Violent ''Criminal Code''" violations include: homicide, attempted murder, sexual assault, assault, robbery, criminal harassment, uttering threats, and other violent violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/legal50a-eng.htm |title=Crimes, by type of violation, and by province and territory |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2013-07-25 |website=statcan.gc.ca |publisher=Canada.gc.ca |accessdate=2014-06-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada also collects information on crime victimization every five years via its General Social Survey on Victimisation (GSS). Among the eight GSS crimes tracked are three violent crimes: sexual assault, robbery, and physical assault.&lt;ref name=CVC2009&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/85-002-x/2010002/article/11340-eng.htm?fpv=2693 |title=Criminal victimization in Canada, 2009 |last1=Perreault |first1=Samuel |last2=Brennan |first2=Shannon |date=2013-05-31 |website=statcan.gc.ca |publisher=Canada.gc.ca |accessdate=2014-06-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===

[[New Zealand]]'s crime statistics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.police.govt.nz/service/statistics/ |title=Official New Zealand Police Statistics |publisher=Police.govt.nz |date= |accessdate=2013-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stats.govt.nz/products-and-services/table-builder/crime-tables/default.htm New Zealand Recorded Crime Tables] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612154656/http://www.stats.govt.nz/products-and-services/table-builder/crime-tables/default.htm |date=June 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has a category for violence that includes [[homicide]]s, [[kidnapping]], [[Kidnapping|abduction]], [[robbery]], [[assault]]s, [[intimidation]], [[coercion|threats]], and group assembly, while all [[sexual offence]]s are shown in a separate category from violence.

===Europe===
Austria, Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, England, Latvia, Netherlands, Portugal, Greece and Sweden count minor violence like slapping another person as assault.&lt;ref name=eurosb2010&gt;[http://www.europeansourcebook.org/ob285_full.pdf European Sourcebook of Crime and Criminal Justice Statistics – 2010], fourth edition, p30.&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the case of Ilias Kasidiaris in 2012. Kasidaris, then spokesperson for Greece's far-right Golden Dawn party, slapped a left-wing female opponent in the face during a live televised debate. He was subsequently wanted by Greek prosecutors for assault and faced an arrest warrant.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18352258 Greek far-right Golden Dawn MP wanted for assault]. BBC.co.uk. June 7, 2012. Retrieved November 15, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

France does not count minor violence like slapping somebody as assault.&lt;ref name=eurosb2010/&gt;

The United Kingdom includes all [[violence]] against the person, [[sexual offence]]s, as violent crime.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Today violent crimes are considered the most heinous whereas historically, according to Simon Dedo, crimes against property were equally important.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dedo |first=Simon |title=When Theft Was Worse Than Murder |url=http://nautil.us/issue/12/feedback/when-theft-was-worse-than-murder |date=2014-04-24 |work=Nautilus |publisher= |accessdate=2014-04-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rates of violent crime in the UK are recorded by the [[British Crime Survey]]. For the 2010/2011 report on crime in England and Wales,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Home Office |url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/science-research-statistics/research-statistics/crime-research/hosb1011 |title=British Crime Survey |publisher=Homeoffice.gov.uk |date=2011-07-14 |accessdate=2013-09-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the statistics show that violent crime continues a general downward trend observed over the last few decades as shown in the graph. "The 2010/11 BCS showed overall violence was down 47 per cent on the level seen at its peak in 1995; representing nearly two million fewer violent offences per year." In 2010/11, 31 people per 1000 interviewed reported being a victim of violent crime in the 12 preceding months. Regarding murder, "increasing levels of homicide (at around 2% to 3% per year) [have been observed] from the 1960s through to the end of the twentieth century". Recently the murder rate has declined, "a fall of 19 per cent in homicides since 2001/02", as measured by The Homicide Index.

===United States===

[[File:Violent Crime in the United States.png|thumb|Violent crime in the United States per the Uniform Crime Report (UCR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucrdatatool.gov/Search/Crime/State/StatebyState.cfm |title=Uniform Crime Reporting Statistics |publisher=Ucrdatatool.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

There are two main crime databases maintained by the [[United States Department of Justice]] (DOJ): the Bureau of Justice Statistics' [[National Crime Victimization Survey]] (NCVS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation's [[Uniform Crime Report]] (UCR). Non-fatal violence is reported in the NCVS, which measures [[rape]] and [[sexual assault]], [[robbery]], and [[Aggravated assault|aggravated]] and simple [[assault]] reported by households surveyed by the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]].&lt;ref name=BJSNCVS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=dcdetail&amp;iid=245 |title=Bureau of Justice Statistics: National Crime Victimization Survey |website=bjs.gov |publisher=Bureau of Justice Statistics |year=2012 |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UCR tracks similar non-fatal violence, plus [[murder]] and non-negligent [[manslaughter]] recorded by law enforcement.&lt;ref name=FBIUCR-Violent&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2012/crime-in-the-u.s.-2012/violent-crime/violent-crime |title=FBI: Violent Crime |website=fbi.gov |publisher=U.S. Department of Justice |year=2012 |accessdate=2014-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are significant methodological and definitional differences between the NCVS and UCR:
*The NCVS includes estimates of both reported and unreported crimes, while the UCR collects data on crimes recorded by the police.
*The UCR includes homicide, arson, and commercial crimes, while the NCVS does not.
*The UCR excludes simple assault (attacks or attempted attacks without a weapon resulting in either no injury or minor injury) and sexual assault, which are in the NCVS.
*The NCVS data are estimates from a nationally representative sample of U.S. households, but the UCR data are based on the actual counts of offenses reported by law enforcement.
*The NCVS excludes crimes against children under 12 years, persons in institutions, and, possibly, highly mobile populations and the homeless; however, victimizations against these persons may be included in the UCR.
Since they use different methodologies and measure overlapping, but not identical, crimes, the data are complementary and not necessarily congruent.&lt;ref name=BJSCStats2012&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv12.pdf |title=Criminal Victimization, 2012 |last1=Truman |first1=Jennifer |last2=Langton |first2=Lynn |last3= |first3= |date=October 2013 |website=bjs.gov |publisher=Bureau of Justice Statistics |accessdate=2014-06-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}}

In October 2013, the [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]] (BJS) reported that violent crime (rape or sexual assault, robbery, aggravated and simple assault) rates for U.S. residents aged 12 and older increased in 2012 for the second consecutive year. The overall rate rose from 22.6 victimizations per 1,000 persons in 2011 to 26.1 in 2012. Most of the increase was in simple assaults.&lt;ref name=BJSCStats2012/&gt;{{rp|1}} From 1993 to 2012, overall violent victimization declined by two-thirds, from a rate of 79.8 per 1,000 to 26.1 per 1,000.&lt;ref name=BJSCStats2012/&gt;{{rp|6}}

In 2011, the UCR violent crime rate had dropped to 386.3 cases per 100,000 persons, compared to 729.6 per 100,000 in 1990.&lt;ref name=Statista2013&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statista.com/statistics/191219/reported-violent-crime-rate-in-the-usa-since-1990/ |title=Reported violent crime rate in the United States from 1990 to 2012 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=February 2013 |website=statista.com |publisher= |accessdate=2013-11-15 }} Using FBI data.&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. homicide data is also available in the [[National Vital Statistics System]] (NVSS).
