{{unreferenced|date=October 2008}}

'''Active duty''' is a full-time occupation as part of a military force, as opposed to [[Military reserve force|reserve duty]]. In the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] the equivalent term is '''active service'''.

==India==
The [[Indian Armed Forces]] are considered to be one of the [[List of countries by size of armed forces|largest active service forces in the world]], with almost 1.42 million Active Standing Army. An additional 2.20 million reserve forces can be activated in a few weeks as per the situation under the order of the [[President of India]] who is the Commander and Chief of the Armed Forces of [[India]]. This does not include the additional 1.40 million troops of the [[Paramilitary forces of India|Paramilitary]] who too are an active force whose full-time responsibility is to guard the sovereignty of the nation from internal and external threats.

==Israel==
In the [[Israel Defense Forces]], there are two types of active duty: regular service ({{lang-he|שרות סדיר}}, ''Sherut Sadir''), and active [[Reserve duty (Israel)|reserve duty]] ({{lang-he|שרות מילואים פעיל}} ''Sherut Milu'im Pa'il'', abbr. ''Shamap''). Regular service refers to either mandatory service ({{lang-he|שרות חובה}}, ''Sherut Hova''), according to the laws of [[Israel]], or [[standing army]] service ({{lang-he|שרות קבע}}, ''Sherut Keva''), which consists of paid [[Non-commissioned officer|NCOs]] and [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]].

Active reserve service refers to the actual time in which reservists are called up. This varies from once every few years to a month every year. During active reserve duty, [[military law]] can be applied to reservists, similarly to regular soldiers.

==Pakistan==
The [[Pakistan Armed Forces]] are one of the largest active service forces in the world, with almost 617,000 full-time personnel, due to the complex and volatile nature of Pakistan's relationship with India and the Kashmir region, and its porous border with Afghanistan. An additional 513,000 part-time reservists (including armed civilians of [[FATA]]) can be activated in a few weeks as per the situation under the order of the [[President of Pakistan]] who is the Commander and Chief of the Armed Forces of [[Pakistan]]. This does not include the additional 427,627 troops of the [[Paramilitary forces of Pakistan|Paramilitary]] who too are an active force whose full-time responsibility is to guard the sovereignty of the nation from internal and external threats.

==United States==
In the [[military of the United States|United States military]], active duty refers to military members who are currently serving on full-time status in their military capacity. Full-time status is not limited to members of the active components of the military services; members of any of the [[United States Armed Forces#Personnel in each service|three components]] (active, [[Reserve components of the United States Armed Forces|reserve]], and the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]]) may be placed into active status. All personnel in the active components are in active status.  Reservists may be placed into active status as units or individuals.  Units may be mobilized in support of operations, such as the reserve units that have been deployed in support of the [[War on Terror|Global War on Terror]] or those called up within the United States to provide [[Defense Support of Civil authorities|support to civil authorities]]. Individuals may be placed in active status as part of the [[Active Guard Reserve]] program, as augmentees to  active or reserve component units, or to attend full-time military training.

'''Antwerp Mannerism''' is the name given to the style of a group of largely anonymous painters active in the Southern Netherlands and principally in Antwerp in the beginning of the 16th century.  The style bore no relation to Renaissance or Italian [[Mannerism]], but the name suggests a peculiarity that was a reaction to the "classic" style of the [[Early Netherlandish painting|earlier Flemish painters]].&lt;ref name="Janson"&gt;{{cite book

==Name==
[[File:Antwerpener Meister 002.jpg|thumb|290px|''Adoration of the Magi'' by Anonymous Antwerp Mannerist]]

The term Antwerp Manierists' was first used in 1915 by [[Max Jakob Friedländer]] in his work ''Die Antwerpener Manieristen von 1520'', in which he made a first attempt to put order in the growing number of works from the Netherlands that were catalogued under the 'name of embarrassment 'pseudo-Herri met de Bles'.&lt;ref name=max&gt;Max J. Friedländer: Die Antwerpener Manieristen von 1520. In: Jahrbuch der königlich preußischen Kunstsammlungen 36, 1915, p. 65–91, p. 65 {{link language|de|German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friedländer used the term Antwerp Mannerism here as synonymous for "Antwerp style".&lt;ref&gt;Kolder Weij, Hermesdorf, Huvenne:.. The painting of the Low Countries, Part 1. Amsterdam University Press, 2006, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; Even though he added the location 'Antwerp' to name the artists and placed them in the year 1520,  Friedländer made it clear that he did not intend to limit the group strictly to Antwerp and the time period to circae 1520, even though he was of the opinion that most of the "pseudo-Bles' works originated from Antwerp and Antwerp workshops.&lt;ref&gt;Max J. Friedländer, 1915, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; Friedländer placed the works attributed to the group in a time period between 1500 and 1530.&lt;ref&gt;Max J. Friedländer, 1915, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the name Antwerp Mannerism the style was not limited to Antwerp. The style also appeared in the north of France and the Northern Netherlands.&lt;ref name=cod&gt;[http://www.codart.nl/exhibitions/details/957/ Codart:ExtravagANT! Antwerpse schilderijen voor de Europese markt 1500-1525] {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
==Artists==
Although attempts have been made to identify the individual artists that were part of this movement, most of the paintings remain attributed to [[anonymous masters]] as the paintings were not signed.  This anonymity has contributed to a lack of knowledge about or popularity of their works.  Only a minority of the works have been classified. The makers of the altarpieces have been given [[notname]]s based on any external knowledge about the works such as an inscription, a previous owner, the place where it was kept or a date found on the work.  Th of Pseudo-Bles, the Master of the Von Groote Adoration, the Master of Amiens, the Antwerp Master of the Adoration and the Master of 1518.  Works that cannot be attributed directly to a named master are attributed to the ''Anonymous Antwerp Mannerist''.
[[File:Meister von Hoogstraeten 003.jpg|thumb|300px|''Virgin and Child'' by the [[Master of Hoogstraeten]]]]
It has been possible to identify some of the artists.&lt;ref name=cod/&gt;  [[Jan de Beer (painter)|Jan de Beer]], the [[Master of 1518]] (possibly [[Jan Mertens the Younger|Jan Mertens]] or [[Jan van Dornicke]]) are some of the identified artists who are regarded as Antwerp Mannerists. The early paintings of [[Jan Gossaert]] and [[Adriaen Isenbrandt]] also show characteristics of the style.  The paintings combine [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] and [[Northern Renaissance]] styles, and incorporate both Flemish and Italian traditions into the same compositions.&lt;ref&gt;
{{ cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia=Winkler Prins encyclopedia| edition=8 | year=1975 | article=Maniëristen, Antwerpse }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
==Themes and style==
The Antwerp Mannerists typically depicted religious themes, which they interpreted generally in a more superficial manner than the Flemish artists of the previous century in favour of a more fluid form and an abundance of meticulously rendered details.&lt;ref name=bex&gt;[http://www.openbaarkunstbezit.be/sites/default/files/tijdschrift/pdf/OKV1965/Meester%20van%20de%20Antwerpse%20Aanbidding%20-%20De%20Aanbidding.pdf "H. Bex-Verschaeren" "Meester van de Antwerpse aanbidding]", in: Openbaar Kunstbezit, 1965 {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also show a preference for a changing palette.  Their compositions are typically shock-full with agitated figures in exotic, extravagant clothes.  The compositions typically include architectural ruins.  The architecture is initially Gothic but later Renaissance motifs become dominant.&lt;ref name=am&gt;'De schilderkunst der Lage Landen: De Middeleeuwen en de zestiende eeuw', Amsterdam University Press, 2006, p. 172-175 {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the panels or triptychs produced by the Antwerp Mannerists depicted scenes of the [[Nativity of Jesus]], usually situated at night, the [[Adoration of the Magi]] and the Crucifixion.&lt;ref name=bex/&gt;  

The theme of the Adoration of the Magi was in particular dear to them as it allowed the artists to give free rein to their preoccupation with ornament and the simulation and imitation of luxury products.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth A. H. Cleland, ''Grand Design: Pieter Coecke van Aelst and Renaissance Tapestry'', Metropolitan Museum of Art, 6 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
The next wave of influence from Italian painting came with [[Romanism (painting)|Romanism]], as seen in the later works of Gossaert.

The '''argument from poor design''', also known as the '''[[Dysteleology|dysteleological]] argument''', is an argument against the [[Existence of God|existence of]] a [[Creator deity|creator]] [[God]], based on the reasoning that an [[Omnipotence|omnipotent]] and  [[Omnibenevolence|omnibenevolent]] God would not create [[organism]]s with the perceived suboptimal designs that can be seen in nature.

The argument is structured as a basic [[modus tollens]]: if "creation" contains many defects, then design is not a plausible theory for the origin of our existence.  It is most commonly used in a weaker way, however:  not with the aim of disproving the existence of God, but rather as a [[reductio ad absurdum]] of the well-known [[Teleological argument|argument from design]], which argues that living things are too well-designed to have originated by chance, so must have been deliberately created by an intelligent God.

Although the phrase "argument from poor design" has seen little use, this type of argument has been advanced many times using words and phrases such as "poor design", "suboptimal design", "unintelligent design" or "[[Dysteleology|dysteology/dysteological]]". The last of these is a term applied by the nineteenth-century biologist [[Ernst Haeckel]] to the implications of organs so rudimentary as to be useless to the life of an organism.&lt;ref name="haeckel"&gt;{{cite book |first=Ernst |last=Haeckel |authorlink=Ernst Haeckel |year=1892 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qdYKAAAAIAAJ |title=The History of Creation |location=Appleton, New York |page=331}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Haeckel, in his book ''The History of Creation'', devoted most of a chapter to the argument, ending with the proposition (perhaps with tongue slightly in cheek) of "a theory of the ''unsuitability of parts'' in organisms, as a counter-hypothesis to the old popular doctrine of the ''suitability of parts''".&lt;ref name="haeckel"/&gt;  The term "incompetent design", a play on "[[intelligent design]]", has been coined by [[Donald Wise]] of the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] to describe aspects of nature that are currently flawed in design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wise |first=Donald |date=2005-07-22 |title="Intelligent" Design versus Evolution |journal=Science |publisher=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]] |volume=309 |issue=5734 |pages=556–557 |doi=10.1126/science.309.5734.556c |pmid=16040688}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional theological responses generally posit that God's creation was perfect but that humanity's misuse of its [[free will]] to rebel against God&lt;!--[?:], and the consequent damage from hostile spiritual forces,--&gt; has resulted in the corruption of good design.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Hahne, [https://books.google.com/books?id=K-Ls4CUEWFAC&amp;lpg=PA211&amp;dq=Creation%20fallen%20due%20to%20sin&amp;pg=PA211#v=onepage&amp;q=Creation%20fallen%20due%20to%20sin&amp;f=false ''The Corruption and Redemption of Creation: Nature in Romans 8, Volume 34'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gregory A. Boyd, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Hj791_BeAF0C&amp;lpg=PA209&amp;dq=Creation%20fallen%20boyd&amp;pg=PA206#v=onepage&amp;q=Creation%20fallen%20boyd&amp;f=false ''God at War: The Bible &amp; Spiritual Conflict'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ed. Charles Taliaferro, Chad Meister, ''The Cambridge Companion to Christian Philosophical Theology'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=KJQyhzY4PucC&amp;lpg=PA160&amp;dq=augustine%20privation%20of%20good%20fallen%20creation&amp;pg=PA160#v=onepage&amp;q=augustine%20privation%20of%20good%20fallen%20creation&amp;f=false page 160]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
[[File:Fitness-landscape-cartoon.png|thumb|right|Natural selection is expected to push fitness to a peak, but that peak often is not the highest.]]

The argument runs that:

# An [[Omnipotence|omnipotent]], [[Omniscience|omniscient]], [[Omnibenevolence|omnibenevolent]] creator God [[Creation myth|would create]] [[organism]]s that have optimal [[design]].
# Organisms have features that are suboptimal.
# Therefore, God either did not create these organisms or is not omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent.

It is sometimes used as a [[reductio ad absurdum]] of the well-known [[Teleological argument|argument from design]], which runs as follows:

# Living things are too well-designed to have originated by chance.
# Therefore, life must have been created by an intelligent creator.
# This creator is God.

"Poor design" is consistent with the predictions of the [[scientific theory]] of [[evolution]] by means of [[natural selection]]. This predicts that features that were evolved for certain uses, are then reused or co-opted for different uses, or abandoned altogether; and that suboptimal state is due to the inability of the [[heredity|hereditary]] mechanism to eliminate the particular vestiges of the evolutionary process.

In [[fitness landscape]] terms, natural selection will always push "up the hill", but a species cannot normally get from a lower peak to a higher peak without first going through a valley.

The argument from poor design is one of the arguments that was used by [[Charles Darwin]];&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Darwin|Darwin, Charles]]. ''[[The Origin of Species]]'', 6th ed., Ch. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; modern proponents have included [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Richard Dawkins]]. They argue that such features can be explained as a consequence of the gradual, cumulative nature of the evolutionary process. [[Theistic evolutionists]] generally reject the argument from design, but do still maintain belief in the existence of God.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===In humans===

====Fatal flaws====
{{more citations needed|date=May 2017}}
[[File:Ectopic.png|250px|thumb|right|[[Regnier de Graaf|Artist's]] representation of an [[ectopic pregnancy]]. Critics cite such common biological occurrences as contradictory to the '[[watchmaker analogy]]'.]]
Several defects in human anatomy can result in death, especially without modern medical care:
* In the human female, a [[zygote|fertilized egg]] can implant into the [[fallopian tube]], [[cervix]] or [[ovary]] rather than the [[uterus]] causing an [[ectopic pregnancy]]. The existence of a cavity between the ovary and the fallopian tube could indicate a flawed design in the female reproductive system. Prior to modern surgery, ectopic pregnancy invariably caused the deaths of both mother and baby. Even in modern times, in almost all cases the pregnancy must be aborted to save the life of the mother.
* In the human female, the [[vagina|birth canal]] passes through the [[human pelvis|pelvis]]. The prenatal skull will deform to a surprising extent. However, if the [[baby]]'s head is significantly larger than the pelvic opening, the baby cannot be born naturally. Prior to the development of modern surgery ([[caesarean section]]), such a complication would lead to the death of the mother, the baby, or both. Other birthing complications such as [[breech birth]] are worsened by this position of the birth canal.
* In the human male, [[testes]] develop initially within the [[abdomen]]. Later during gestation, they migrate through the abdominal wall into the [[scrotum]]. This causes two weak points in the abdominal wall where [[hernia]]s can later form. Prior to modern surgical techniques, complications from hernias, such as intestinal blockage and [[gangrene]], usually resulted in death.&lt;ref name="Jury"&gt;{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Colby |author2=Loren Petrich |year=1993 |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/jury-rigged.html |title=Evidence for Jury-Rigged Design in Nature |publisher=[[Talk.Origins]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/615A4Dvf5?url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/jury-rigged.html |archivedate=2011-08-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The existence of the [[pharynx]], a passage used for both [[ingestion]] and [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]], with the consequent drastic increase in the risk of [[choking]]. 
* The breathing reflex is stimulated not directly by the absence of [[oxygen]] but indirectly by the presence of carbon dioxide.  A result is that, at high altitudes, oxygen deprivation can occur in unadapted individuals who do not consciously increase their breathing rate.
* The human [[Appendix (anatomy)|appendix]] is a [[vestigial organ]] with no known purpose (suggested purposes are either unproven or incidental/non-essential){{citation needed|date=March 2018}} and no deleterious effects come from its removal.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} However [[appendicitis]], an infection of this organ, is a certain death without medical intervention.

====Other flaws====
* Barely used nerves and muscles, such as the [[plantaris muscle]] of the foot,&lt;ref name="selim"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Selim |first=Jocelyn |date=June 2004 |title=Useless Body Parts |journal=Discover |volume=25 |issue=6 |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2004/jun/useless-body-parts |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817155923/http://discovermagazine.com/2004/jun/useless-body-parts |archivedate=2011-08-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that are missing in part of the human population and are routinely harvested as spare parts if needed during operations. Another example is the muscles that move the ears, which some people can learn to control to a degree, but serve no purpose in any case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ernst |last=Haeckel |authorlink=Ernst Haeckel |year=1892 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qdYKAAAAIAAJ |title=The History of Creation |location=Appleton, New York |page=328}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The common malformation of the human spinal column, leading to [[scoliosis]], [[sciatica]] and congenital misalignment of the vertebrae. The [[spinal cord]] cannot ever properly heal if it is damaged, because neurons have become so specialized that they are no longer able to regrow once they reach their mature state. The spinal cord, if broken, will never repair itself and will result in permanent [[paralysis]].&lt;ref&gt;"Nervous System Guide by the National Science Teachers Association."

* Almost all animals and plants synthesize their own [[vitamin C]], but humans cannot because the gene for this enzyme is defective ([[L-gulonolactone oxidase|Pseudogene ΨGULO]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nishikimi M, Yagi K |title=Molecular basis for the deficiency in humans of gulonolactone oxidase, a key enzyme for ascorbic acid biosynthesis |journal=Am.

The gene is also non-functional in other [[primate]]s and in [[guinea pig]]s, but is functional in most other animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ohta Y, Nishikimi M |title=Random nucleotide substitutions in primate nonfunctional gene for L-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase, the missing enzyme in L-ascorbic acid biosynthesis |journal=Biochim.

* The prevalence of [[congenital disease]]s and genetic disorders such as [[Huntington's disease]].
* Crowded [[teeth]] and poor [[Paranasal sinus|sinus]] drainage, as human faces are significantly flatter than those of other [[primates]] and humans share the same tooth set. This results in a number of problems, most notably with [[wisdom teeth]], which can damage neighboring teeth or cause serious infections of the mouth.&lt;ref&gt;"Wisdom Teeth."

* The structure of [[human eye|humans' eye]]s (as well as those of all vertebrates). The [[retina]] is 'inside out'. The nerves and blood vessels lie on the ''surface'' of the retina instead of behind it as is the case in many [[invertebrate]] species. This arrangement forces a number of complex adaptations and gives mammals a [[blind spot (vision)|blind spot]].&lt;ref&gt;Nave, R. "The Retina." of the Human Eye. N.p., n.d.

===Other life===

* In the [[Africa]]n [[locust]], [[nerve]] cells start in the abdomen but connect to the wing. This leads to unnecessary use of materials.&lt;ref name="Jury" /&gt;
* Intricate reproductive devices in [[orchid]]s, apparently constructed from components commonly having different functions in other flowers.
* The use by [[panda]]s of their enlarged [[sesamoid bone#Other animals|radial sesamoid bones]] in a manner similar to how other creatures use [[thumb]]s.&lt;ref name="Jury" /&gt;
* The existence of unnecessary wings in flightless birds, e.g. ostriches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ernst |last=Haeckel |authorlink=Ernst Haeckel |year=1892 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qdYKAAAAIAAJ |title=The History of Creation |location=Appleton, New York |page=326}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The route of the [[recurrent laryngeal nerve]] is such that it travels from the brain to the larynx by looping around the [[aortic arch]]. This same configuration holds true for many animals; in the case of the [[giraffe]], this results in about twenty feet of extra nerve.
* The [[Tetrachromacy|loss of tetrachromatic vision]] by mammals as compared to other tetrapods.
* The enzyme [[RuBisCO]] has been described as a "notoriously inefficient" enzyme,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Spreitzer RJ, Salvucci ME |title=Rubisco: structure, regulatory interactions, and possibilities for a better enzyme |journal=Annu Rev Plant Biol |volume=53 |issue= |pages=449–75 |year=2002 |pmid=12221984 |doi=10.1146/annurev.arplant.53.100301.135233}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it is [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibited]] by oxygen, has a very slow turnover and is not saturated at current levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The enzyme is inhibited as it is unable to distinguish between carbon dioxide and molecular oxygen, with oxygen acting as a [[competitive inhibition|competitive enzyme inhibitor]]. However, RuBisCO remains the key enzyme in [[carbon fixation]], and plants overcome its poor activity by having massive amounts of it inside their cells, making it the most abundant protein on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ellis RJ |title=Biochemistry: Tackling unintelligent design |journal=Nature |volume=463 |issue=7278 |pages=164–5 |date=January 2010 |pmid=20075906 |doi=10.1038/463164a}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The enzyme [[nitrogenase]] actually preferentially binds with [[acetylene]] over di-nitrogen, despite its being the key enzyme used in nitrogen fixation in many [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]].
* Sturdy but heavy bones, suited for non-flight, occurring in animals like bats. Or, on the converse: unstable, light, hollow bones, suited for flight, occurring in birds like penguins and ostriches, which cannot fly.
* Various [[vestigial]] body parts, like the femur and pelvis in whales (evolution says the ancestor of whales lived on land).
* [[Turritopsis dohrnii]] and [[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]] genus have [[biological immortality]], but most animals do not.
* Many species have strong instincts to behave in response to a certain stimulus. Natural selection can leave animals behaving in detrimental ways when they encounter a [[supernormal stimulus]] - like a [[moth]] flying into a flame.
* Plants are green and not black, as [[chlorophyll]] absorbs green light poorly, even though black plants would absorb more light energy.
* [[Whale]]s and [[dolphin]]s breathe air, but live in the water, meaning they must swim to the surface frequently to breathe.
* [[Albatross]]es cannot take off or land properly.

== Criticism ==

===Unproven assumptions===
Several generic philosophical criticisms can be directed towards the first premise of the argument – that a [[Creator deity]] would have designed things 'optimally'.  The argument hinges on an assumption that the human concept of 'optimal design' is the same as that of a theistic god. This is, in effect, the argument for the incomprehensibility of the [[Abrahamic God]] [[Yahweh]] in the [[Book of Job]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said, Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge? Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me. Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? Declare, if thou hast understanding. Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? Or who hath stretched the line upon it? Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? Or who laid the corner stone thereof, when the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?&lt;ref&gt;King James Bible.  Job 38:1&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The [[Book of Job]] goes on to list a number of aspects of the world that seem wonderful or miraculous beyond human understanding. The claim is that, if humans have no understanding of how the wonders of the world were created, they cannot fully understand the things that appear flawed.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Optimal design engineering and trade-offs===
Others argue that the observed suboptimality in one system or another is intentional, as a [[trade-off]] to improve overall optimal design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fazale|first=Rana|title=Responding to a Skeptic|url=http://www.reasons.org/theology/bible-difficulties/RespondingtoaSkeptic|accessdate=2018-07-22|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927013720/http://www.reasons.org/theology/bible-difficulties/RespondingtoaSkeptic|archivedate=2011-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Specific examples===
[[Intelligent design]] proponent [[William Dembski]] questions the first premise of the argument, maintaining a distinction between "intelligent design" and optimal design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dembski |first=William |authorlink=William Dembski |title=Intelligent design: the bridge between science &amp; theology |publisher=InterVarsity Press |year=1999 |isbn=0-8308-2314-X |page=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article written by [[John Woodmorappe]] on the [[Creation Ministries International]] website says that the [[Sesamoid bone|panda's "thumb"]] works well for what the panda uses it for – to strip leaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://creation.com/panda-thumbs-its-nose-at-the-dysteleological-arguments-of-the-atheist-stephen-jay-gould|title=Panda thumbs its nose at the dysteleological arguments of the atheist Stephen Jay Gould - creation.com|author=|date=|website=creation.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20130704051258/http://creation.com/panda-thumbs-its-nose-at-the-dysteleological-arguments-of-the-atheist-stephen-jay-gould|archivedate=2013-07-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the [[veriform appendix|appendix]] has been previously credited with very little function, research has shown that it serves an important role in the fetus and young adults. Endocrine cells appear in the appendix of the human fetus at around the 11th week of development, which produce various biogenic amines and peptide hormones, compounds that assist with various biological control (homeostatic) mechanisms.  In young adults, the appendix has some immune functions.&lt;ref name=SA&gt;{{cite web |first=Loren G. |last=Martin |date=October 21, 1999 |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=what-is-the-function-of-t |title=What is the function of the human appendix? |publisher=[[Scientific American]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009062840/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=what-is-the-function-of-t |archivedate=October 9, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creationist [[Jonathan Sarfati]] and ophthalmologist Peter Gurney have both published articles on the Creation Ministries International website which disagree that the human eye is poorly designed, arguing that alternative arrangements would have further complications and that the human eye actually works very well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://creation.com/is-our-inverted-retina-really-bad-design|title=Is our 'inverted' retina really 'bad design'? - creation.com|author=|date=|website=creation.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20130627193627/http://creation.com/is-our-inverted-retina-really-bad-design|archivedate=2013-06-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://creation.com/mueller-cells-backwardly-wired-retina-v-dawkins|title=Mueller cells backwardly wired retina v Dawkins - creation.com|author=|date=|website=creation.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20130626233057/http://creation.com/mueller-cells-backwardly-wired-retina-v-dawkins|archivedate=2013-06-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responses to criticism==

In addition, the [[plantaris]] muscle does atrophy. Its motor function is so minimal that its long tendon can readily be harvested for reconstruction elsewhere with little functional deficit.

In response to the claim that uses have been found for "junk" DNA, proponents note that the fact that some non-coding DNA has a purpose does not establish that all non-coding DNA has a purpose, and that the human genome does include [[pseudogenes]] that are nonfunctional "junk", with others noting that some sections of DNA can be randomized, cut, or added to with no apparent effect on the organism in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Mark |last=Isaak |year=2004 |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CB/CB130.html |title=Claim CB130 |publisher=Talk.Origins |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060911070043/http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CB/CB130.html |archivedate=2006-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original study that suggested that the ''Makorin1-p1'' served some purpose&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hirotsune | first1 = S | last2 = Yoshida | first2 = N | last3 = Chen | first3 = A | last4 = Garrett | first4 = L | last5 = Sugiyama | first5 = F | last6 = Takahashi | first6 = S | last7 = Yagami | first7 = K | last8 = Wynshaw-Boris | first8 = A | last9 = Yoshiki | first9 = A. | year = 2003 | title = An expressed pseudogene regulates the messenger-RNA stability of its homologous coding gene | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v423/n6935/abs/nature01535.html | journal = Nature | volume = 423 | issue = 6935 | pages = 91–6 | doi = 10.1038/nature01535 | pmid = 12721631 | display-authors = etal | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080425042454/http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v423/n6935/abs/nature01535.html | archivedate = 2008-04-25 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; has been disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gray | first1 = TA | last2 = Wilson | first2 = A | last3 = Fortin | first3 = PJ | last4 = Nicholls | first4 = RD | year = 2006 | title = The putatively functional Mkrn1-p1 pseudogene is neither expressed nor imprinted, nor does it regulate its source gene in trans | url = http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/0602216103v1 | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 103 | issue =  | pages = 12039–12044 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0602216103 | pmid = 16882727 | pmc = 1567693 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071001043736/http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/0602216103v1 | archivedate = 2007-10-01 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the original study is still frequently cited in newer studies and articles on pseudogenes previously thought to be nonfunctional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oe=utf-8&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;lr&amp;cites=16337157008352528383|title=Google Scholar|author=|date=|website=scholar.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As an argument regarding God==
The argument from poor design is sometimes interpreted, by the argumenter or the listener, as an [[argument against the existence of God]], or against characteristics commonly attributed to a [[creator deity]], such as [[omnipotence]], [[omniscience]], or personality. In a weaker form, it is used as an argument for the incompetence of God. The existence of "poor design" (as well as the perceived prodigious "wastefulness" of the evolutionary process) would seem to imply a "poor" designer, or a "blind" designer, or no designer at all. In Gould's words, "If God had designed a beautiful machine to reflect his wisdom and power, surely he would not have used a collection of parts generally fashioned for other purposes. Orchids are not made by an ideal engineer; they are jury-rigged...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_panda%27s-thumb.html |title=The Panda's Peculiar Thumb |work=NATURAL HISTORY |date=November 1978 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928063454/http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_panda's-thumb.html |archivedate=2006-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The apparently suboptimal design of organisms has also been used by [[theistic evolutionists]] to argue in favour of a creator deity who uses [[natural selection]] as a mechanism of his creation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Collins|Collins, Francis S.]] ''The Language of God'' (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster), 2006. p 191. {{ISBN|978-1-4165-4274-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arguers from poor design regard counter-arguments as a [[false dilemma]], imposing that either a creator deity designed life on earth well, or flaws in design indicate the life is not designed. This allows proponents of [[intelligent design]] to [[Cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry pick]] which aspects of life constitute design, leading to the [[unfalsifiability]] of the theory. Christian proponents of intelligent design as evidence of the existence of the [[Abrahamic God]] [[Yahweh]] can claim that good design indicates the creative intelligence of their God, while poor design indicates corruption of the world as a result of [[Alvin Plantinga's free will defense|free will]] that caused the [[Fall (religion)|Fall]] ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 3:16 has [[Yahweh]] saying to [[Eve]] "I will increase your trouble in pregnancy").

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5428">{{citations|date=January 2018}}'''Business mathematics''' is [[mathematics]] used by [[Commerce|commercial]] enterprises to record and manage [[business operations]]. Commercial organizations use mathematics in [[accounting]], [[inventory management]], [[marketing]], sales [[forecasting]], and [[financial analysis]].  

Mathematics typically used in commerce includes [[elementary arithmetic]], elementary [[algebra]], [[statistics]] and [[probability]].  Business management can be done more effectively in some cases by use of more advanced mathematics such as [[calculus]], [[Matrix_(mathematics)#Basic_operations|matrix algebra]] and [[linear programming]].

==High school==
''Business mathematics, '' sometimes called ''commercial math''  or ''consumer math'', is a group of practical subjects used in [[commerce]] and everyday life. In schools, these subjects are often taught to students who are not planning a university education.  In the United States, they are typically offered in [[high schools]] and in schools that grant [[associate's degrees]]; elsewhere they may be included under [[Business studies]].  The emphasis in these courses is on computational skills and their practical application, with practical application being predominant. 

A (U.S.) business math course might include a review of [[elementary arithmetic]], including [[fractions]], [[decimals]], and [[percentages]]. Elementary [[algebra]] is often included as well, in the context of solving practical business problems. The practical applications typically include [[checking accounts]], [[discounts and allowances|price discounts]], [[markup (business)|markups and Markup]], [[payroll]] calculations, [[interest|simple and compound interest]], [[credit (finance)|consumer and business credit]], and [[mortgages]] and [[revenues]].

==University level==
===Undergraduate===
"Business Mathematics" comprises mathematics courses taken at an [[undergraduate]] level by [[Business education#Undergraduate education|business students]]. The two most common here are ''Business Calculus'' and ''[[Business Statistics]]''.  Programs often also cover matrix operations as above, and may include a separate module on [[time value of money|interest calculations]].

These courses are usually focused on problems from the business world, and the syllabus is adjusted correspondingly. Thus for example, whereas in a regular calculus course students would study [[trigonometric functions]], courses here would not typically cover this area. Correspondingly, these courses typically do not go into the same depth as standard courses in the mathematics or science fields.  (Although see [[Bachelor of Science in Business Administration]] and [[Bachelor of Business Science]].) 

Note that [[Bachelor of Economics|economics majors]], especially those planning to pursue  [[Master of Economics|graduate study in the field]], are encouraged to instead take regular calculus, as well as [[linear algebra]] and other advanced math courses, especially [[real analysis]]. Some programs (instead) include a module in "mathematics for economists", providing a bridge between the above "Business Mathematics" courses and [[mathematical economics]] and [[econometrics]].
[[Operations management]] (and [[management accounting]]) may similarly include supplementary coursework in relevant quantitative techniques, generally linear programming as above, as well as other optimization methods.

===Postgraduate===
[[Business_education#Postgraduate_education|At the postgraduate level]], ''generalist'' management and finance programs include quantitative topics which are foundational for the study in question - often exempting students with an appropriate background. These are usually "interest mathematics" and statistics, both at the above level. [[MBA]] programs often also include basic [[operations research]] (linear programming, as above) with the emphasis on practice, and may combine the topics as "quantitative analysis"; [[master of science in finance|MSF programs]] may similarly cover applied [[econometrics]].

More technical [[masters degree|Masters]] in these areas, such as those in [[management science]] and [[Master of Quantitative Finance|quantitative finance]], will entail a deeper, more theoretical study of operations research and econometrics, and extend to further advanced topics such as [[mathematical optimization]] and [[stochastic calculus]]. These programs do not include "Business mathematics" ''per se''.

Where [[mathematical economics]] is not required, [[Master of Economics|graduate economics programs]] often include "quantitative techniques", which covers (applied) [[linear algebra]] and [[multivariate calculus]], and may include the above topics; regardless, econometrics is usually a separate course, and is dealt with in depth.

'''Cultural materialism''' in [[literary theory]] and [[cultural studies]] traces its origin to the work of the [[left-wing]] literary critic [[Raymond Williams]]. Cultural materialism makes analysis based in [[critical theory]], in the tradition of the [[Frankfurt School]]. 

==Overview==
Cultural materialism emerged as a theoretical movement in the early 1980s along with [[new historicism]], an American approach to [[early modern]] literature, with which it shares much common ground. The term was coined by Williams, who used it to describe a theoretical blending of leftist culturalism and [[Marxist]] analysis. Cultural materialists deal with specific historical documents and attempt to analyze and recreate the zeitgeist of a particular moment in history. 

Williams viewed culture as a "productive process", part of the [[means of production]], and cultural materialism often identifies what he called "residual", "emergent" and "oppositional" cultural elements. Following in the tradition of [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Antonio Gramsci]] and others, cultural materialists extend the [[Social class|class]]-based analysis of traditional [[Marxism]] ([[Neo-Marxism]]) by means of an additional focus on the [[marginalized]].

Cultural materialists analyze the processes by which [[hegemony|hegemonic]] forces in society appropriate canonical and historically important texts, such as [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and [[Jane Austen|Austen]], and utilize them in an attempt to validate or inscribe certain values on the cultural [[Imaginary (sociology)|imaginary]]. [[Jonathan Dollimore]] and [[Alan Sinfield]], authors of ''[[Political Shakespeare]]'', have had considerable influence in the development of this movement and their book is considered to be a seminal text. They have identified four defining characteristics of cultural materialism as a theoretical device:
* Historical context
* Close textual analysis
* Political commitment
* Theoretical method

Cultural materialists seek to draw attention to the processes being employed by contemporary power structures, such as the church, the state or the academy, to disseminate [[ideology]]. To do this they explore a text’s historical context and its political implications, and then through close textual analysis note the dominant hegemonic position. They identify possibilities for the rejection and/or subversion of that position. British critic [[Graham Holderness]] defines cultural materialism as a "politicized form of historiography".

Through its insistence on the importance of an engagement with issues of [[gender]], [[Sexual orientation|sexuality]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] and [[Social class|class]], cultural materialism has had a significant impact on the field of literary studies, especially in Britain. Cultural materialists have found the area of Renaissance studies particularly receptive to this type of analysis. Traditional [[Humanism|humanist]] readings often eschewed consideration of the oppressed and marginalized in textual readings, whereas cultural materialists routinely consider such groups in their engagement with literary texts, thus opening new avenues of approach to issues of [[Representation (arts)|representation]] in the field of literary criticism.

'''Entertainment''' is a form of activity that holds the attention and [[Interest (emotion)|interest]] of an [[audience]], or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] (Oxford University Press, 1971, Vol 1 pp.&amp;nbsp;213–14) gives Latin and French origins for the word, including ''inter'' (among) + ''tenir'' (to hold) as derivations, giving translations of "to hold mutually" or "to hold intertwined" and "to engage, keep occupied, the [[attention]] thoughts or time (of a person)". It also provides words like "merry-making", "pleasure", "delight", as well as "to receive as a guest and show hospitality to". It cites a 1490 usage by [[William Caxton]].&lt;/ref&gt; Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. [[Storytelling]], [[music]], [[drama]], [[dance]], and different kinds of [[performance]] exist in all cultures, were supported in [[Court (royal)|royal courts]], developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an [[entertainment industry]] that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a [[banquet]] adapted for two; to any size or type of [[party]], with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.

The experience of being entertained has come to be strongly associated with [[amusement]], so that one common understanding of the idea is [[fun]] and laughter, although many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may be the case in the various forms of [[ceremony]], celebration, [[religious festival]], or [[satire]] for example. Hence, there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving [[insight]] or intellectual growth.

An important aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private [[recreation]] or [[leisure]] activity into entertainment. The audience may have a passive role, as in the case of persons watching a [[Play (theatre)|play]], [[opera]], [[television show]], or [[film]]; or the audience role may be active, as in the case of [[game]]s, where the participant/audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in the case of [[theatre]] or [[concert]]s; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of [[List of traditional children's games|children's games]]. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion for example with [[Magic (illusion)|stage magic]]. Films and [[video game]]s, for example, although they use newer media, continue to [[storytelling|tell stories]], present drama, and play music. [[Festival]]s devoted to [[music festival|music]], [[Film festival|film]], or [[Competitive dance|dance]] allow audiences to be entertained over a number of consecutive days.

Some activities that were once considered entertaining, particularly public punishments, have been removed from the public arena. Others, such as [[fencing]] or [[archery]], once necessary skills for some, have become serious [[sport]]s and even [[professional|professions]] for the participants, at the same time developing into entertainment with wider appeal for bigger audiences. In the same way, other necessary skills, such as [[cooking]], have developed into performances among professionals, staged as global competitions and then broadcast for entertainment. What is entertainment for one group or individual may be regarded as work by another.

The familiar forms of entertainment have the capacity to cross over different media and have demonstrated a seemingly unlimited potential for creative [[remix]]. This has ensured the continuity and longevity of many themes, images, and structures.

== Psychology and philosophy ==
Entertainment can be distinguished from other activities such as [[education]] and [[marketing]] even though they have learned how to use the appeal of entertainment to achieve their different goals. The importance and impact of entertainment is recognised by scholars&lt;ref&gt;For example, the application of psychological models and theories to entertainment is discussed in Part III of {{cite book|last=Bryant|first=Jennings|title=Psychology of Entertainment|year=2006|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc|location=Mahwah, New Jersey|isbn=0-8058-5238-7|pages=367–434|author2=Vorderer, Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sayre&gt;{{cite book|ref=CITEREFSayreKing2010|last=Sayre|first=Shay|title=Entertainment and Society: Influences, Impacts, and Innovations (Google eBook)|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=Oxon, New York|isbn=0-415-99806-9|edition=2nd|author2=King, Cynthia}} p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; and its increasing sophistication has influenced practices in other fields such as [[museology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Conservation, Education, Entertainment?|year=2011|publisher=Channel View Publication|isbn=978-1-84541-164-0|editor=Frost, Warwick}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Museum Revolutions|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|location=Oxon, New York|isbn=0-203-93264-1|authors=Macleod, Suzanne; Watson, Sheila|editor=Knell, Simon J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologists say the function of media entertainment is "the attainment of [[gratification]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zillmann|first=Dolf|title=Media Entertainment –  the psychology of its appeal|year=2000|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc. Taylor &amp; Francis e-library (2009)|location=Mahwah, New Jersey|isbn=0-8058-3324-2|page=vii|author2=Vorderer, Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; No other results or measurable benefit are usually expected from it (except perhaps the final score in a sporting entertainment). This is in contrast to education (which is designed with the purpose of developing understanding or helping people to learn) and marketing (which aims to encourage people to purchase commercial products). However, the distinctions become blurred when education seeks to be more "entertaining" and entertainment or marketing seek to be more "educational". Such mixtures are often known by the [[neologism]]s "[[edutainment]]" or "[[infotainment]]". The psychology of entertainment as well as of learning has been applied to all these fields.&lt;ref&gt;For example, marketers mix commercial messages with non-commercial messages in entertainments on radio, television, films, videos and games. {{cite book|last=Shrum|first=L.J.J.|title=The Psychology of Entertainment Media|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-84872-944-5|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some education-entertainment is a serious attempt to combine the best features of the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Entertainment-Education and Social Change: History, Research, and Practice|year=2008|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=1-4106-0959-6|editors=Singhal, Arvind; Cody, Michael J.; Rogers, Everett; Sabido, Miguel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Digital Games and Learning |year=2011 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |location=London; New York |isbn=978-1-4411-9870-9 |editor1-last=de Freitas |editor1-first=Sara |editor2-last=Maharg |editor2-first=Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people are entertained by others' pain or the idea of their unhappiness ([[schadenfreude]]).

An entertainment might go beyond gratification and produce some insight in its audience.  Entertainment may skillfully consider universal philosophical questions such as: "What is the meaning of life?"; "What does it mean to be human?"; "What is the right thing to do?"; or "How do I know what I know?". Questions such as these drive many narratives and dramas, whether they are presented in the form of a story, film, play, poem, book, dance, comic, or game. Dramatic examples include [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s influential play ''[[Hamlet]]'', whose hero articulates these concerns in [[poetry]]; and films, such as ''[[The Matrix]]'', which explores the nature of knowledge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Irwin|editor-first=William|title=The Matrix and Philosophy|year=2002|publisher=Carus Publishing Company|location=Peru, Illinois|page=196|isbn=0-8126-9502-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was released world-wide.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/releaseinfo?ref_=tt_ql_9 IMDb ''The Matrix'' worldwide release dates]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Novel]]s give great scope for investigating these themes while they entertain their readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Peter|title=Philosophy and the Novel|year=1975|location=Oxford, Clarendon}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a creative work that considers philosophical questions so entertainingly that it has been presented in a very wide range of forms is ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''. Originally a [[radio comedy]], this story became so popular that it has also appeared as a novel, film, television series, stage show, comic, [[audiobook]], [[LP record]], [[adventure game]] and [[online game]], its ideas became popular references (see [[Phrases from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]) and has been translated into many languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Simpson, M.J. |title=The Pocket Essential Hitchhiker's Guide |edition=2nd |publisher=Pocket Essentials |year=2005 |isbn=1-904048-46-3 |page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its themes encompass the [[meaning of life]], as well as "the [[ethics]] of entertainment, [[artificial intelligence]], multiple worlds, God, and [[philosophical method]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Joll|editor-first=Nicholas|title=Philosophy and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|year=2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire; New York|isbn=978-0-230-29112-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "ancient craft of communicating events and experiences, using words, images, sounds and gestures" by telling a story&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gakhar|first=Sonia|title=The influence of storytelling on pre-service students' attitudes and intentions (MSc Thesis)|year=2007|publisher=Iowa State University}}&lt;/ref&gt; is not only the means by which people passed on their cultural values and traditions and history from one generation to another, it has been an important part of most forms of entertainment ever since the earliest times. Stories are still told in the early forms, for example, around a fire while [[camping]], or when listening to the stories of another culture as a [[tourist]]. "The earliest storytelling sequences we possess, now of course, committed to writing, were undoubtedly originally a speaking from mouth to ear and their force as entertainment derived from the very same elements we today enjoy in films and novels."&lt;ref name=Kuhns&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuhns|first=Richard Francis|title=Decameron and the Philosophy of Storytelling: Author as Midwife and Pimp|year=2005|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York; Chichester West Sussex|isbn=0-231-13608-0|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Storytelling is an activity that has evolved and developed "toward variety".&lt;ref name=Kuhns/&gt; Many entertainments, including storytelling but especially music and drama, remain familiar but have developed into a wide variety of form to suit a very wide range of personal preferences and cultural expression. Many types are blended or supported by other forms. For example, drama, stories and banqueting (or dining) are commonly enhanced by music; sport and [[game]]s are incorporated into other activities to increase appeal. Some may have evolved from serious or necessary activities (such as [[running]] and [[jumping]]) into competition and then become entertainment. It is said, for example, that [[pole vault]]ing "may have originated in the Netherlands, where people used long poles to vault over wide canals rather than wear out their clogs walking miles to the nearest bridge. Others maintain that pole vaulting was used in warfare to vault over fortress walls during battle."&lt;ref name=Carlsen&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlsen|first=Spike|title=A Splintered History of Wood|year=2009|publisher=Harper Perennial|location=New York|isbn=978-0-06-137356-5|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; The equipment for such sports has become increasingly sophisticated. Vaulting poles, for example, were originally made from woods such as [[Fraxinus|ash]], [[hickory]] or [[hazel]];  in the 19th century [[bamboo]] was used and in the 21st century poles can be made of [[Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer|carbon fibre]].&lt;ref name=Carlsen/&gt; Other activities, such as [[Stilts|walking on stilts]], are still seen in [[circus]] performances in the 21st century. [[Gladiator|Gladiatorial combats]], also known as "gladiatorial games", popular during Roman times, provide a good example of an activity that is a combination of sport, punishment, and entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title= Gladiators: violence and spectacle in ancient Rome|author = Dunkle, Roger| year= 2008| location = Harlow, England; New York| publisher = Pearson/Longman| isbn = 9781405807395}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title=Medieval Sport: Quest for Survival | author1=Wiseman, Douglas C. | year=1977  | publisher=Distributed by ERIC Clearinghouse Microfiche }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes to what is regarded as entertainment can occur in response to cultural or historical shifts. Hunting wild animals, for example, was introduced into the [[Roman Empire]] from [[Carthage]] and became a popular public entertainment and spectacle, supporting an international trade in wild animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Potter|first=David Stone|title=Life, Death, and Entertainment in the Roman Empire|year=1999|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=0-472-10924-3|page=308|author2=Mattingly, David J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entertainment also evolved into different forms and expressions as a result of social upheavals such as wars and revolutions. During the Chinese [[Cultural Revolution]], for example, [[Revolutionary opera]] was sanctioned by the Communist party and [[World War I]], the [[Great Depression]] and the [[Russian revolution]] all affected entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roshwald|first=Aviel|title=European Culture in the Great War: The Arts, Entertainment and Propaganda, 1914–1918|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-57015-8|author2=Stites, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heinrich|first=Anselm|title=Heinrich, Entertainment, propaganda, education: regional theatre in Germany and Britain between 1918 and 1945|year=2007|publisher=University of Hertfordshire Press|location=Hatfield, England|isbn=978-1-902806-74-7|editor=Meech, Tony}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arthur|first=Max|title=When this bloody war is over: soldiers' songs from the First World War|year=2001|publisher=Piatkus|location=London|isbn=0-7499-2252-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="David Horn, Dave Laing, Paul Oliver, Peter Wicke, Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World Part 1 Media, Industry, Society,"&gt;{{cite book|title=Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World Part 1 Media, Industry, Society|year=2003|publisher=Continuum|isbn=0-8264-6321-5|authors=Laing, Dave; Oliver, Paul; Wicke, Peter|editor=Horn, David}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McReynolds|first=Louise|title=Russia at Play: Leisure Activities at the End of the Tsarist Era|year=2003|publisher=Cornell University|isbn=0-8014-4027-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relatively minor changes to the form and venue of an entertainment continue to come and go as they are affected by the period, fashion, culture, technology, and economics. For example, a story told in dramatic form can be presented in an open-air theatre, a [[music hall]], a [[Movie theater|movie theatre]], a [[Multiplex (movie theater)|multiplex]], or as technological possibilities advanced, via a personal electronic device such as a [[tablet computer]]. Entertainment is provided for mass audiences in purpose-built structures such as a [[Theater (structure)|theatre]], [[auditorium]], or [[stadium]]. One of the most famous venues in the Western world, the [[Colosseum]], "dedicated [[Before common era|AD]]&amp;nbsp;80 with a hundred days of games, held fifty thousand spectators," and in it audiences "enjoyed "blood sport with the trappings of stage shows".{{sfnp|ref=harv|McDonald Walton|2007|p=51}} [[Spectacle]]s, competitions, [[Racing|races]], and sports were once presented in this purpose-built arena as public entertainment. New stadia continue to be built to suit the ever more sophisticated requirements of global audiences.

=== Court entertainment ===

[[File:Ralph Hedley The tournament 1898.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ralph Hedley]] ''The Tournament'' (1898) Children adapting a courtly entertainment]]
Imperial and royal courts have provided training grounds and support for professional entertainers, with different cultures using palaces, castles and forts in different ways. In the [[Maya civilization|Maya city states]], for example, "spectacles often took place in large plazas in front of palaces; the crowds gathered either there or in designated places from which they could watch at a distance."&lt;ref name=Walthall&gt;{{cite book|title=Servants of the Dynasty: Palace Women in World History|year=2008|publisher=University of California Press|location=London|isbn=978-0-520-25443-5|editor=Walthall, Anne|ref=CITEREFWalthall2008}} pp.&amp;nbsp;4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Court entertainments also crossed cultures. For example, the [[Durbar (court)|durbar]] was introduced to India by the [[Mughal emperors|Mughals]], and passed onto the [[British Empire]], which then followed Indian tradition: "institutions, titles, customs, ceremonies by which a [[Maharaja]] or [[Nawab]] were installed&amp;nbsp;... the exchange of official presents&amp;nbsp;... the order of precedence", for example, were "all inherited from&amp;nbsp;... the Emperors of Delhi".&lt;ref name="Indian Princes"&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Charles|authorlink = Charles Allen (writer)|last2 = Dwivedi|first2=Sharada|authorlink2 = Sharada Dwivedi|title=Lives of the Indian Princes|year=1984|publisher=Century Publishing|location=London|isbn=0-7126-0910-5|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Korea, the "court entertainment dance" was "originally performed in the palace for entertainment at court banquets."&lt;ref name="Van Zile"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Van Zile|first=Judy|title=Perspectives on Korean Dance|year=2001|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, Connecticut|isbn=0-8195-6494-X}} p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Court entertainment often moved from being associated with the court to more general use among [[commoner]]s. This was the case with "masked dance-dramas" in Korea, which "originated in conjunction with village [[Shamanism|shaman]] rituals and eventually became largely an entertainment form for commoners".{{sfnp|Van Zile|2001|p=9}} [[Nautch]] dancers in the Mughal Empire performed in Indian courts and palaces. Another evolution, similar to that from courtly entertainment to common practice, was the transition from religious ritual to secular entertainment, such as happened during the [[Goryeo]] dynasty with the Narye festival. Originally "solely religious or ritualistic, a secular component was added at the conclusion".{{sfnp|Van Zile|2001|p=69}} Former courtly entertainments, such as [[jousting]], often also survived in children's games.

In some courts, such as those during the [[Byzantine Empire]], the genders were segregated among the upper classes, so that "at least before the period of the [[Komnenos|Komnenoi]]" (1081–1185) men were separated from women at ceremonies where there was entertainment such as receptions and banquets.&lt;ref name=Garland&gt;{{cite book|last=Garland|first=Lynda|title=Byzantine Women: Varieties of Experience 800–1200|year=2006|publisher=Ashgate Publishing Limited|location=Aldershot, Hampshire|isbn=978-0-7546-5737-8|pages=177–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Court ceremonies, palace banquets and the spectacles associated with them, have been used not only to entertain but also to demonstrate wealth and power. Such events reinforce the relationship between ruler and ruled; between those with power and those without, serving to "dramatise the differences between ordinary families and that of the ruler".{{sfnp|Walthall|2008}} This is the case as much as for traditional courts as it is for contemporary ceremonials, such as the [[Hong Kong handover ceremony]] in 1997, at which an array of entertainments (including a banquet, a parade, fireworks, a festival performance and an art spectacle) were put to the service of highlighting a change in political power. Court entertainments were typically performed for royalty and courtiers as well as "for the pleasure of local and visiting dignitaries".{{sfnp|Van Zile|2001|p=6}} Royal courts, such as the Korean one, also supported traditional dances.{{sfnp|Van Zile|2001|p=6}} In Sudan, musical instruments such as the so-called "slit" or "talking" drums, once "part of the court orchestra of a powerful chief", had multiple purposes: they were used to make music; "speak" at ceremonies; mark community events; send long-distance messages; and call men to hunt or war.&lt;ref name="Slit Drum"&gt;{{cite web|last=McGregor|first=Neil|title=Episode 94: Sudanese Slit Drum (Transcript)|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/about/transcripts/episode94/|work=History of the World in 100 Objects|publisher=BBC Radio 4/British Museum|accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McGregor&gt;{{cite book|last=McGregor|first=Neil|title=A History of the World in 100 objects|year=2010|publisher=Allen Lane|location=London|isbn=978-1-84614-413-4|pages=613–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/FMgugdskR7eaWj_ST2fAeQ British Museum catalogue image of Sudanese slit drum]&lt;/ref&gt;

Courtly entertainments also demonstrate the complex relationship between entertainer and spectator: individuals may be either an entertainer or part of the audience, or they may swap roles even during the course of one entertainment. In the court at the [[Palace of Versailles]], "thousands of courtiers, including men and women who inhabited its apartments, acted as both performers and spectators in daily rituals that reinforced the status hierarchy".{{sfnp|Walthall|2008}}

Like court entertainment, royal occasions such as coronations and weddings provided opportunities to entertain both the [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]] and the people. For example, the splendid 1595 [[Accession Day]] celebrations of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] offered [[tournament]]s and jousting and other events performed "not only before the assembled court, in all their finery, but also before thousands of Londoners eager for a good day's entertainment. Entry for the day's events at the [[Tiltyard]] in [[Palace of Whitehall|Whitehall]] was set at [[History of the English penny (1485–1603)#Elizabeth I|12d]]".&lt;ref name=Bevington&gt;{{cite book|title=The Politics of the Stuart Court Masque|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-59436-7|author=Holbrook, Peter|editor=Bevington, David|pages=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public punishment ===
[[File:Ticket for the execution of Jonathan Wild.jpg|thumb|160px|Ticket for the execution of [[Jonathan Wild]] (1725)]]
Although most forms of entertainment have evolved and continued over time, some once-popular forms are no longer as acceptable.  For example, during earlier centuries in Europe, watching or participating in the punishment of criminals or social outcasts was an accepted and popular form of entertainment. Many forms of [[public humiliation]] also offered local entertainment in the past. Even capital punishment such as [[hanging]] and [[Decapitation|beheading]], offered to the public as a warning, were also regarded partly as entertainment. Capital punishments that lasted longer, such as [[stoning]] and [[Hanged, drawn and quartered|drawing and quartering]], afforded a greater public spectacle. "A hanging was a carnival that diverted not merely the unemployed but the unemployable. Good bourgeois or curious aristocrats who could afford it watched it from a carriage or rented a room."&lt;ref name=Gay/&gt; Public punishment as entertainment lasted until the 19th century by which time "the awesome event of a public hanging aroused the[ir] loathing of writers and philosophers".&lt;ref name=Gay&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Peter Gay|last=Gay|first=Peter|title=Schnitzler's Century – The making of middle-class culture 1815–1914|year=2002|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Co|location=New York; London|isbn=0-393-32363-3|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]] and [[William Makepeace Thackeray|Thackeray]] wrote about a hanging in [[Newgate Prison]] in 1840, and "taught an even wider public that executions are obscene entertainments".&lt;ref name=Gay/&gt;

== Children ==
{{Main article|Play (activity)}}
[[File:Pieter Bruegel d. Ä. 041b.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]] ''[[Children's Games (Bruegel)|Children's Games]]'' (1560)]]

Children's entertainment is centred on [[Play (activity)|play]] and is significant for their growth. Entertainment is also provided to children or taught to them by adults and many activities that appeal to them such as [[puppet]]s, [[clown]]s, [[pantomime]]s and [[cartoon]]s are also enjoyed by adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Brien|first=John|title=Harlequin Britain: Pantomime and Entertainment, 1690–1760|year=2004|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=0-8018-7910-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geipel|first=John|title=The cartoon: a short history of graphic comedy and satire|year=1972|publisher=Newton Abbot: David &amp; Charles|isbn=0-7153-5328-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children have always played games. It is accepted that as well as being entertaining, playing games helps children's development. One of the most famous visual accounts of children's games is a painting by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] called ''[[Children's Games (Bruegel)|Children's Games]]'', painted in 1560. It depicts children playing a range of games that presumably were typical of the time. Many of these games, such as [[Marble (toy)|marbles]], [[hide-and-seek]], blowing [[soap bubble]]s and [[Piggy-back (transportation)|piggyback riding]] continue to be played.

[[File:Israel Rating.jpg|thumb|100px|left|Example of a rating system specifying age appropriateness (Israel)]]
Most forms of entertainment can be or are modified to suit children's needs and interests. During the 20th century, starting with the often criticised but nonetheless important work of [[G. Stanley Hall]], who "promoted the link between the study of development and the 'new' laboratory psychology",&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last1=Thompson |first1=Dennis |last2=Hogan |first2=John D. |last3=Clark |first3=Philip M. |title=Developmental Psychology in Historical Perspective |year=2012 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |location=Malden, Massachusetts; Oxford |isbn=978-1-4051-6747-5 |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and especially with the work of [[Jean Piaget]], who "saw cognitive development as being analogous to biological development",{{sfnp|Thompson|2012|p=114}} it became understood that the [[Developmental psychology|psychological development]] of children occurs in stages and that their capacities differ from adults. Hence, stories and activities, whether in books, film, or video games were developed specifically for child audiences. Countries have responded to the special needs of children and the rise of digital entertainment by developing systems such as [[television content rating systems]], to guide the public and the [[entertainment industry]].

In the 21st century, as with adult products, much entertainment is available for children on the internet for private use. This constitutes a significant change from earlier times. The amount of time expended by children indoors on screen-based entertainment and the "remarkable collapse of children's engagement with nature" has drawn criticism for its negative effects on [[imagination]], adult [[cognition]] and [[Subjective well-being|psychological well-being]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cobb|first=Edith|title=The ecology of imagination in childhood|year=1977|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-231-03870-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Louv|first=Richard|title=[[Last Child in the Woods]]: saving our children from nature-deficit disorder|year= 2005|publisher=Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill|location=Chapel Hill, North Carolina|isbn=1-56512-391-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/nov/19/children-lose-contact-with-nature"&gt;{{cite news|last=Monbiot|first=George|title=If children lose contact with nature they won't fight for it|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/19/children-lose-contact-with-nature|accessdate=29 November 2012|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forms ==

=== Banquets ===
[[Banquet]]s have been a venue for entertainment since ancient times, continuing until the 21st century, when they are still being used for many of their original purposes{{snd}} to impress visitors, especially important ones ('''4''', '''6''', '''9'''); to show hospitality ('''2''', '''4''', '''8'''); as an occasion to showcase supporting entertainments such as music or dancing, or both ('''2''', '''3'''). They were an integral part of court entertainments ('''3''', '''4''') and helped entertainers develop their skills ('''2''', '''3'''). They are also important components of celebrations such as coronations ('''9'''), weddings ('''7'''), [[birthday]]s ('''10''') civic or political achievements ('''5'''), military engagements or victories ('''6''') as well as religious obligations ('''1'''). In modern times, banquets are commercially available, for example, in restaurants ('''10''') and combined with a performance in [[dinner theater|dinner theatres]]. Cooking by professional [[chef]]s has also become a form of entertainment as part of global competitions such as the [[Bocuse d'Or]].

=== Music ===
{{Main article|Music}}
[[File:A full house, seen from the rear of the stage, at the Metropolitan Opera House for a concert by pianist Josef Hofmann, 1 - NARA - 541890.tif|thumb|left|A full house at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York City, waiting for a musical entertainment to begin (1937)]]
Music is a supporting component of many kinds of entertainment and most kinds of performance. For example, it is used to enhance storytelling, it is indispensable in dance ('''1''', '''4''') and opera, and is usually incorporated into dramatic film or theatre productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffiths|first=Paul|title=A concise history of western music|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-521-84294-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Music is also a universal and popular type of entertainment on its own, constituting an entire performance such as when [[concert]]s are given ('''2''', '''4''', '''5''', '''6''', '''7''', '''8''', '''9''' ). Depending on the [[rhythm]], [[Musical instrument|instrument]], performance and style, music is divided into many genres, such as [[classical music|classical]], [[jazz]], [[Folk music|folk]], ('''4''', '''5''', '''8'''), [[rock music|rock]], [[pop music]] ('''6''', '''9''') or traditional ('''1''', '''3'''). Since the 20th century, performed music, once available only to those who could pay for the performers, has been available cheaply to individuals by the entertainment industry, which broadcasts it or pre-records it for sale.

The wide variety of musical performances, whether or not they are artificially [[Amplifier|amplified]] ('''6''', '''7''', '''9''', '''10'''), all provide entertainment irrespective of whether the performance is from [[Solo (music)|soloists]] ('''6'''), [[Choir|choral]] ('''2''') or [[orchestra|orchestral groups]] ('''5''', '''8'''), or [[Musical ensemble|ensemble]] ('''3'''). Live performances use specialised venues, which might be small or large; indoors or outdoors; free or expensive. The audiences have different expectations of the performers as well as of their own role in the performance. For example, some audiences expect to listen silently and are entertained by the excellence of the music, its rendition or its interpretation ('''5''', '''8'''). Other audiences of live performances are entertained by the ambience and the chance to participate ('''7''', '''9'''). Even more listeners are entertained by pre-recorded music and listen privately ('''10''').

The instruments used in musical entertainment are either solely the [[human voice]] ('''2''', '''6''') or solely instrumental ('''1''', '''3''') or some combination of the two ('''4''', '''5''', '''7''', '''8'''). Whether the performance is given by [[Singing|vocalists]] or [[Musician|instrumentalists]], the performers may be soloists or part of a small or large group, in turn entertaining an audience that might be individual ('''10'''), passing by ('''3'''), small ('''1''', '''2''') or large ('''6''', '''7''', '''8''', '''9'''). Singing is generally accompanied by instruments although some forms, notably [[a cappella]] and [[overtone singing]], are unaccompanied. Modern concerts often use various special effects and other theatrics to accompany performances of singing and dancing ('''7''').

=== Games ===
{{Main article|Game}}
Games are played for entertainment—sometimes purely for entertainment, sometimes for achievement or reward as well. They can be played alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs or by professionals. The players may have an audience of non-players, such as when people are entertained by watching a [[World Chess Championship|chess championship]]. On the other hand, players in a game may constitute their own audience as they take their turn to play. Often, part of the entertainment for children playing a game is deciding who is part of their audience and who is a player.

Equipment varies with the game. [[Board game]]s, such as [[Go (game)|Go]], ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'' or [[backgammon]] need a board and markers. One of the oldest known board games is [[Senet]], a game played in Ancient Egypt, enjoyed by the [[pharaoh]] [[Tutankhamun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Botermans|first=Jack|title=The Book of Games: Strategy, Tactics &amp; History|year=2008|publisher=Sterling Pub Co Inc|isbn=1-4027-4221-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Card game]]s, such as [[whist]], [[poker]] and [[Contract bridge|Bridge]] have long been played as evening entertainment among friends. For these games, all that is needed is a deck of [[playing card]]s. Other games, such as [[Bingo (U.S.)|bingo]], played with numerous strangers, have been organised to involve the participation of non-players via [[gambling]]. Many are [[children's game|geared for children]], and can be played outdoors, including [[hopscotch]], [[hide and seek]], or [[Blind man's bluff (game)|Blind man's bluff]]. The [[list of ball games]] is quite extensive. It includes, for example, [[croquet]], [[lawn bowling]] and [[paintball]] as well as many sports using various forms of [[ball]]s. The options cater to a wide range of skill and fitness levels. Physical games can develop agility and competence in [[motor skill]]s. Number games such as [[Sudoku]] and puzzle games like the [[Rubik's cube]] can develop mental prowess.

[[History of video games|Video games]] are played using a controller to create results on a screen. They can also be played online with participants joining in remotely. In the second half of the 20th century and in the 21st century the number of such games increased enormously, providing a wide variety of entertainment to players around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Understanding Digital Games|year=2006|publisher=Sage Publications|location=London; California; New Delhi|isbn=1-4129-0033-6|author=Bryce, Jo|editor=Rutter, Jason}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Newman|first=James|title=Videogames|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=London; New York|isbn=0-203-64290-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Video games are popular in [[East Asia]]n countries such as South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jin|first=Dal Yong|title=Korea's Online Gaming Empire|year=2010|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|isbn=978-0-262-01476-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French poet [[Louise Labé]] (1520/1522–1566) wrote "a profound and timeless insight into reading's innate power".

''The past gives us pleasure and is of more service than the present; but the delight of what we once felt is dimly lost never to return and its memory is as distressing as the events themselves were then delectable&amp;nbsp;... But when we happen to put our thoughts in writing, how easily, later on, does our mind race through an infinity of events, incessantly alive, so that a long time afterwards when we take up those written pages we can return to the same place and to the same disposition in which we once found ourselves.'' &lt;br&gt;quote from and commentary by Fischer (2003)&lt;ref name=Fischer&gt;{{cite book|last=Fischer|first=Steven Roger|title=A history of reading|year=2003|publisher=Reaktion Books|location=London|isbn=1-86189-160-1|ref=harv|page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The young Saint [[Teresa of Ávila]] (1515–1582) read chivalrous novels and wrote about the "rapture" that books provided.

''I became accustomed to reading [novels] and that small fault made me cool my desire and will to do other tasks. I thought nothing of spending many hours a day and night in this vain exercise, hidden from my father. My rapture in this was so great, that unless I had a new book to read, it seemed to me that I could not be happy.'' &lt;br&gt; quoted in Fischer (2003){{sfnp|Fischer|2003|pp=234–35}}
}}

[[Reading (process)|Reading]] has been a source of entertainment for a very long time, especially when other forms, such as performance entertainments, were (or are) either unavailable or too costly. Even when the primary purpose of the writing is to inform or instruct, reading is well known for its capacity to distract from everyday worries. Both stories and information have been passed on through the tradition of [[orality]] and oral traditions survive in the form of [[performance poetry]] for example. However, they have drastically declined. "Once literacy had arrived in strength, there was no return to the oral prerogative."{{sfnp|Fischer|2003|p=215}} The advent of printing, the reduction in costs of books and an increasing literacy all served to enhance the mass appeal of reading. Furthermore, as [[font]]s were standardised and texts became clearer, "reading ceased being a painful process of decipherment and became an act of pure pleasure".{{sfnp|Fischer|2003|p=212}} By the 16th century in Europe, the appeal of reading for entertainment was well established.

Among [[literature]]'s many genres are some designed, in whole or in part, purely for entertainment. [[Limerick (poetry)|Limericks]], for example, use verse in a strict, predictable rhyme and rhythm to create humour and to amuse an audience of listeners or readers. Interactive books such as "[[choose your own adventure]]" can make literary entertainment more participatory.

[[File:Goscinny (scenarist van de strips Asterix en Lucky Luke) (l) en Morris (tekenaar, Bestanddeelnr 924-5894.jpg|thumb|Readers entertained by comic books (1971)]]
[[Comics]] and cartoons are literary genres that use drawings or graphics, usually in combination with text, to convey an entertaining narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chapman|first=James|title=British comics: a cultural history|year=2011|publisher=Reaktion Books|location=London|isbn=978-1-86189-855-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many contemporary comics have elements of [[fantasy]] and are produced by companies that are part of the [[entertainment industry]]. Others have unique authors who offer a more personal, philosophical view of the world and the problems people face. Comics about [[superheroes]] such as [[Superman]] are of the first type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Benton|first=Mike|title=Superhero comics of the Golden Age: the illustrated history|year= 1992|publisher=Taylor Publishing|location=Dallas, Texas|isbn=0-87833-808-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of the second sort include the individual work over 50 years  of [[Charles M. Schulz]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://cartoonician.com/charles-m-schulz-on-cartooning/ "Charles M. Schulz on Cartooning", ''Hogan's Alley'' #1, 1994]&lt;/ref&gt; who produced a popular comic called ''[[Peanuts]]''&lt;ref&gt;Films have been made of the ''Peanuts'' cartoons, including one [[The Peanuts Movie|released in 2015]] to celebrate the 65th anniversary of the comic strip.&lt;/ref&gt; about the relationships among a cast of child characters;&lt;ref&gt;The philosophical and theological implications of Schulz's work were explored in: {{cite book|last=Short|first=Robert L.|title=The Gospel According to Peanuts|year=1965|publisher=John Knox Press|location=Westminster|isbn=0-664-22222-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Michael Leunig]] who entertains by producing whimsical cartoons that also incorporate [[social criticism]]. The Japanese [[Manga]] style differs from the western approach in that it encompasses a wide range of genres and themes for a readership of all ages. [[Caricature]] uses a kind of graphic entertainment for purposes ranging from merely putting a smile on the viewer's face, to raising social awareness, to highlighting the moral characteristics of a person being caricatured.

=== Comedy ===
{{Main article|Comedy}}
[[File:Dictator charlie3.jpg|thumb|Comedian [[Charlie Chaplin]] impersonating [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] for comic effect in the [[satire|satirical]] film ''[[The Great Dictator]]'' (1940)]]
[[Comedy]] is both a [[genre]] of entertainment and a component of it, providing laughter and amusement, whether the comedy is the sole purpose or used as a form of contrast in an otherwise serious piece. It is a valued contributor to many forms of entertainment, including in literature, theatre, opera, film and games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roston|first=Murray|title=The comic mode in English literature: from the Middle Ages to today|year=2011|publisher=Continuum|location=London|isbn=978-1-4411-9588-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grindon|first=Leger|title=The Hollywood romantic comedy: conventions, history, controversies|year=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Malden, Massachusetts|isbn=978-1-4051-8266-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In royal courts, such as in the Byzantine court, and presumably, also in its wealthy households, "[[Mime artist|mimes]] were the focus of orchestrated humour, expected or obliged to make fun of all at court, not even excepting the emperor and members of the imperial family. This highly structured role of [[jester]] consisted of verbal humour, including [[teasing]], jests, [[insult]], ridicule, and [[obscenity]] and [[Nonverbal communication|non-verbal]] humour such as [[slapstick]] and horseplay in the presence of an audience."&lt;ref name=Garland/&gt; In medieval times, all comic types{{snd}} the [[buffoon]], jester, [[hunchback]], [[Dwarfism|dwarf]], jokester, were all "considered to be essentially of one comic type: the fool", who while not necessarily funny, represented "the shortcomings of the individual".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hokenson|first=Jan Walsh|title=The Idea of Comedy: History, Theory, Critique|year=2006|publisher=Rosemont Publishing and Printing Corp|location=Cranbury, New Jersey|isbn=0-8386-4096-6|pages=150–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hornback|first=Robert|title=The English clown tradition from the middle ages to Shakespeare|year=2009|publisher=D.S.

Shakespeare wrote seventeen [[Shakespearean comedy|comedies]] that incorporate many techniques still used by performers and writers of comedy—such as [[joke]]s, [[pun]]s, [[parody]], [[wit]], [[observational humor]], or the unexpected effect of [[irony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gay|first=Penny|title=The Cambridge introduction to Shakespeare's comedies|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge; New York|isbn=978-0-521-85668-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ellis|first=David|title=Shakespeare's practical jokes: an introduction to the comic in his work|year=2007|publisher=Bucknell University Press|location=Lewisburg, Pennsylvania|isbn=0-8387-5680-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[One-liner joke]]s and satire are also used to comedic effect in literature. In [[farce]], the comedy is a primary purpose.

The meaning of the word "comedy" and the audience's expectations of it have changed over time and vary according to culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thorpe|first=Ashley|title=The role of the chou ("clown") in traditional Chinese drama: comedy, criticism, and cosmology on the Chinese stage|year=2007|publisher=Edwin Mellen Press|location=Lewiston, New York|isbn=0-7734-5303-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simple physical comedy such as [[slapstick]] is entertaining to a broad range of people of all ages. However, as cultures become more sophisticated, national nuances appear in the style and references so that what is amusing in one culture may be unintelligible in another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Comedy: A Geographic and Historical Guide|year=2005|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=0-313-32706-8&lt;!-- (set)--&gt;|editor=Charney, Maurice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Performance ===
{{Main|Performance}}
Live performances before an audience constitute a major form of entertainment, especially before the invention of audio and video recording. Performance takes a wide range of forms, including theatre, music and drama. In the 16th and 17th centuries, European royal courts presented [[masque]]s that were complex theatrical entertainments involving dancing, singing and acting. Opera is a similarly demanding performance style that remains popular. It also encompass all three forms, demanding a high level of musical and dramatic skill, collaboration and like the masque, production expertise as well.

[[File:Aida poster colors fixed.jpg|center|thumb|550px|Poster for a 1908 production of [[Verdi]]'s 1871 opera ''[[Aida]]'', performed by the Hippodrome Opera Company of Cleveland, Ohio]]
Audiences generally show their appreciation of an entertaining performance with applause. However, all performers run the risk of failing to hold their audience's attention and thus, failing to entertain. Audience dissatisfaction is often brutally honest and direct.

{{Quotation|"Of course you all ought to know that while singing a good song or, or giving a good recitation&amp;nbsp;... helps to arrest the company's attention&amp;nbsp;... Such at least was the case with me{{snd}} the [[publican]] devised a plan to bring my entertainment to an end abruptly, and the plan was, he told the waiter to throw a wet towel at me, which, of course, the waiter did&amp;nbsp;... and I received the wet towel, full force, in the face, which staggered me&amp;nbsp;... and had the desired effect of putting an end to me giving any more entertainments in the house."

==== Storytelling ====
{{Main|Storytelling}}
Storytelling is an ancient form of entertainment that has influenced almost all other forms. It is "not only entertainment, it is also thinking through human conflicts and contradictions".&lt;ref name=Kuhns/&gt; Hence, although stories may be delivered directly to a small listening audience, they are also presented as entertainment and used as a component of any piece that relies on a narrative, such as film, drama, ballet, and opera. Written stories have been enhanced by illustrations, often to a very high artistic standard, for example, on [[illuminated manuscript]]s and on ancient scrolls such as Japanese ones.&lt;ref name=Watanabe&gt;{{cite book|last=Watanabe|first=Masako|title=Storytelling in Japanese Art|year=2011|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|location=New York|isbn=978-0-300-17590-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stories remain a common way of entertaining a group that is on a journey. Showing how stories are used to pass the time and entertain an audience of travellers, [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] used [[pilgrim]]s in his literary work ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' in the 14th century, as did Wu Cheng'en in the 16th century in ''[[Journey to the West]]''. Even though journeys can now be completed much faster, stories are still told to passengers en route in cars and aeroplanes either orally or delivered by some form of technology.

The power of stories to entertain is evident in one of the most famous ones—[[Scheherazade]]—a story in the [[Iran|Persian]] professional storytelling tradition, of a woman who saves her own life by telling stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yamanaka|first=Yuriko|title=The Arabian nights and orientalism: perspectives from East &amp; West|year=2006|publisher=I.B. Tauris|location=London; New York|author2=Nishio, Tetsuo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burton|first=Sir Richard (1821–1890) (in English)|title=Arabian nights. A plain and literal translation of the Arabian nights' entertainments: now entitled The book of the thousand and one nights |year=1958|publisher=Barker|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Arabian nights in English literature : studies in the reception of The thousand and one nights into British culture|year=1988|publisher=Macmillan|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire|isbn=0-333-36693-X|editor=Caracciolo, Peter L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The connections between the different types of entertainment are shown by the way that stories like this inspire a retelling in another medium, such as music, film or games. For example, composers [[Scheherazade (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Rimsky-Korsakov]], [[Shéhérazade (Ravel)|Ravel]] and [[Karol Szymanowski|Szymanowski]] have each been inspired by the Scheherazade story and turned it into an orchestral work; director [[Pier Paolo Pasolini|Pasolini]] made a [[Arabian Nights (1974 film)|film adaptation]]; and there is an [[The Magic of Scheherazade|innovative video game]] based on the tale. Stories may be told wordlessly, in music, dance or puppetry for example, such as in the Javanese tradition of [[wayang]], in which the performance is accompanied by a [[gamelan]] orchestra or the similarly traditional [[Punch and Judy]] show.

Epic narratives, poems, [[saga]]s and [[allegory|allegories]] from all cultures tell such gripping tales that they have inspired countless other stories in all forms of entertainment. Examples include the Hindu ''[[Ramayana]]'' and ''[[Mahabharata]]''; [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Iliad]]''; the first Arabic novel ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan]]''; the Persian epic ''[[Shahnameh]]''; the [[Sagas of Icelanders]] and the celebrated ''[[The Tale of Genji|Tale of the Genji]]''. Collections of stories, such as ''[[Grimms' Fairy Tales]]'' or those by [[Hans Christian Andersen]], have been similarly influential. Originally published in the early 19th century, this collection of folk stories significantly influence modern popular culture, which subsequently used its themes, images, symbols, and structural elements to create new entertainment forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rankin|first=Walter|title=Grimm pictures: fairy tale archetypes in eight horror and suspense films|year=2007|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|isbn=978-0-7864-3174-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the most powerful and long-lasting stories are the foundation stories, also called [[myth of origin|origin]] or [[creation myth]]s such as the [[Dreamtime]] myths of the [[Aboriginal Australians|Australian aborigines]], the Mesopotamian ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The epic of Gilgamesh: the Babylonian epic poem and other texts in Akkadian and Sumerian (English –  translated from Akkadian and Sumerian by Andrew George)|year=1999|publisher=Allen Lane|location=London|isbn=0-7139-9196-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Hawaiian stories of the origin of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Vivian Laubach|title=Hawaiian Myths of Earth, Sea, and Sky|year=1966|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=0-8248-1171-2|author2=Kahalewai, Marilyn}}&lt;/ref&gt; These too are developed into books, films, music and games in a way that increases their longevity and enhances their entertainment value.

[[Theatre]] performances, typically dramatic or musical, are presented on a stage for an audience and have a history that goes back to [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic times]] when "leading musicians and actors" performed widely at "poetical competitions", for example at "[[Delphi]], [[Delos]], [[Ephesus]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=CITEREFMcDonald_Walton2007|title=The Cambridge companion to Greek and Roman theatre|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge; New York|isbn=0-521-83456-2|editors=McDonald, Marianne and Walton, J. Michael}} p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]] and his teacher [[Plato]] both wrote on the theory and purpose of theatre. Aristotle posed questions such as "What is the function of the arts in shaping character? Should a member of the ruling class merely watch performances or be a participant and perform?

The stage and the spaces set out in front of it for an audience create a theatre. All types of stage are used with all types of seating for the audience, including the impromptu or improvised ('''2''', '''3''', '''6'''); the temporary ('''2'''); the elaborate ('''9'''); or the traditional and permanent ('''5''', '''7'''). They are erected indoors ('''3''', '''5''', '''9''') or outdoors ('''2''', '''4''', '''6'''). The skill of managing, organising and preparing the stage for a performance is known as [[stagecraft]] ('''10'''). The audience's experience of the entertainment is affected by their expectations, the stagecraft, the type of stage, and the type and standard of seating provided.

==== Cinema and film ====
{{Main|Film}}
[[File:Munken kino (kinolerret).jpg|thumb|left|Film audiences are typically seated in comfortable chairs arranged in close rows before a projection screen. Norway (2005)]]

[[Film]]s are a major form of entertainment, although not all films have entertainment as their primary purpose: [[documentary film]], for example, aims to create a record or inform,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wyver|first=John|title=The Moving Image: An International History of Film, Television, and Video|year=1989|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Limited|isbn=0-631-16821-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the two purposes often work together. The medium was a global business from the beginning: "The [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Lumière brothers]] were the first to send cameramen throughout the world, instructing them to film everything which could be of interest for the public."&lt;ref name=Paris&gt;{{cite book|ref=CITEREFParis1999|title=The First World War and popular Cinema|year=1999|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh|isbn=0-8135-2824-0|editor=Paris, Michael}} p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, [[Pathé]] launched and distributed [[Pathé News|newsreels]]&lt;ref name=Paris/&gt; and by [[World War I]], films were meeting an enormous need for mass entertainment. "In the first decade of the [20th] century cinematic programmes combined, at random, fictions and newsfilms."&lt;ref name=Paris/&gt; The Americans first "contrived a way of producing an illusion of motion through successive images," but "the French were able to transform a scientific principle into a commercially lucrative spectacle".{{sfnp|Paris|1999|p=115}} Film therefore became a part of the entertainment industry from its early days. Increasingly sophisticated techniques have been used in the film medium to delight and entertain audiences. [[Animation]], for example, which involves the display of rapid movement in an art work, is one of these techniques that particularly appeals to younger audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cavalier|first=Stephen|title=The world history of animation|year= 2011|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0-520-26112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advent of [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) in the 21st century made it "possible to do spectacle" more cheaply and "on a scale never dreamed of" by [[Cecil B. DeMille]].&lt;ref name=Byrnes&gt;{{cite web|last=Byrnes|first=Paul|title=Pompeii, Noah and Exodus: The sword giveth again|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/pompeii-noah-and-exodus-the-sword-giveth-again-20140327-35jm4.html|work=Film|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1930s to 1950s, movies and radio were the "only mass entertainment" but by the second decade of the 21st century, technological changes, economic decisions, risk aversion and globalisation reduced both the quality and range of films being produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = Losing the plot|last = Byrnes|first = Paul|date = 12 December 2015|work = The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date = |via = |pages = 12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sophisticated [[visual effects]] and CGI techniques, for example, rather than humans, were used not only to create realistic images of people, landscapes and events (both real and [[Fantasy|fantastic]]) but also to animate non-living items such as [[Lego]] normally used as entertainment as a game in physical form.&lt;ref name=Maddox&gt;{{cite web|last=Maddox|first=Garry|title=The Lego Movie: Hit off the old block | url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/the-lego-movie-hit-off-the-old-block-20140327-35jek.html|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creators of ''[[The Lego Movie]]'' "wanted the audience to believe they were looking at actual Lego bricks on a tabletop that were shot with a real camera, not what we actually did, which was create vast environments with digital bricks inside the computer."&lt;ref name=Maddox/&gt; The convergence of computers and film has allowed entertainment to be presented in a new way and the technology has also allowed for those with the personal resources to screen films in a [[home cinema|home theatre]], recreating in a private venue the quality and experience of a public theatre. This is similar to the way that the nobility in earlier times could stage private musical performances or the use of domestic theatres in large homes to perform private plays in earlier centuries.

Films also re-imagine entertainment from other forms, turning stories, books and plays, for example, into new entertainments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rothwell|first=Kenneth S.|title=A History of Shakespeare on Screen: A Century of Film and Television|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge; New York|isbn=0-521-59404-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Story of Film: An Odyssey|The Story of Film]]'', a documentary about the [[history of film]], gives a survey of global achievements and innovations in the medium, as well as changes in the conception of film-making. It demonstrates that while some films, particularly those in the [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] tradition that combines "realism and [[melodrama]]tic romanticism",{{sfnp|Paris|1999|p=17}} are intended as a form of [[escapism]], others require a deeper engagement or more thoughtful response from their audiences. For example, the award winning Senegalese film ''[[Xala]]'' takes government corruption as its theme. [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s film ''[[The Great Dictator]]'' was a brave and innovative parody, also on a political theme. Stories that are thousands of years old, such as [[Noah (2014 film)|''Noah'']], have been re-interpreted in film, applying familiar [[literary devices]] such as allegory and [[personification]] with new techniques such as CGI to explore big themes such as "human folly", good and evil, courage and despair, love, faith, and death{{snd}} themes that have been a main-stay of entertainment across all its forms.&lt;ref name=Byrnes2&gt;{{cite web|last=Byrnes|first=Paul|title=Noah review: Moments of brilliance but can't shake sinking feeling  |url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/noah-review-moments-of-brilliance-but-cant-shake-sinking-feeling-20140327-35jm3.html|work=Review|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in other media, excellence and achievement in films is recognised through a range of awards, including ones from the  American [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]], the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]], the [[Cannes International Film Festival]] in France and the [[Asia Pacific Screen Awards]].

==== Dance ====
{{Main|Dance}}
[[File:Peterborough Snow Ball 2008 silent video.ogg|left|thumb|Dancers creating their own entertainment at a ball. &lt;br&gt; Peterborough (2008) (silent video)]]
The many forms of [[dance]] provide entertainment for all age groups and cultures. Dance can be serious in tone, such as when it is used to express a culture's history or important stories; it may be provocative; or it may put in the service of comedy. Since it combines many forms of entertainment{{snd}} music, movement, storytelling, theatre{{snd}} it provides a good example of the various ways that these forms can be combined to create entertainment for different purposes and audiences.

Dance is "a form of cultural representation" that involves not just dancers, but "[[Choreography (dance)|choreographers]], audience members, [[Patronage|patrons]] and [[impresario]]s&amp;nbsp;... coming from all over the globe and from vastly varied time periods."&lt;ref name="Dils"&gt;{{cite book|ref=CITEREFDilsAlbright2001|title=Moving History/Dancing Cultures: A Dance History Reader|year=2001|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Durham, North Carolina|isbn=0-8195-6412-5|author=Albright, Ann Cooper|editor=Dils, Ann}} p. xviii.&lt;/ref&gt; Whether from Africa, Asia or Europe, dance is constantly negotiating the realms of political, social, spiritual and artistic influence."{{sfnp|Dils|Albright|2001|p=96}} Even though dance traditions may be limited to one cultural group, they all develop. For example, in Africa, there are "[[Dahomey|Dahomean]] dances, [[Hausa people|Hausa]] dances, [[Maasai people|Masai]] dances and so forth."{{sfnp|Dils|Albright|2001|p=34}} [[Ballet]] is an example of a highly developed Western form of dance that moved to the theatres from the French court during the time of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], the dancers becoming professional theatrical performers.&lt;ref name="Clarke"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Clarke|first=Mary|title=The history of dance|year=1981|publisher=Crown Publishers|location=New York|isbn=0-517-54282-X}} p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Some dances, such as the [[quadrille]], a square dance that "emerged during the [[Napoleonic era|Napoleonic years]] in France"{{sfnp|Clarke|1981|p=97}} and other [[country dance]]s&lt;ref name="Wilson2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Thomas|title=An Analysis of Country Dancing|date=1808|publisher=W. Calvert}}&lt;/ref&gt; were once popular at social gatherings like [[Ball (dance)|balls]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fullerton|first=Susannah|title=A Dance with [[Jane Austen]]: How a Novelist and Her Characters Went to the Ball|year=2012|publisher=Pgw|isbn=0-7112-3245-8|author2=Le Faye, Deirdre}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Thomas|title=The Treasures of Terpsichore: or, A Companion for the Ball-Room|date=1816|publisher=Sherwood, Neely and Jones|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; but are now rarely performed. On the other hand, many [[folk dance]]s (such as [[Scottish highland dance|Scottish Highland dancing]] and [[Irish dance|Irish dancing]]), have evolved into competitions, which by adding to their audiences, has increased their entertainment value. "Irish dance theatre, which sometimes features traditional Irish steps and music, has developed into a major dance form with an international reputation."&lt;ref name="Wulff"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wulff|first=Helena|title=Dancing at the Crossroads: Memory and Mobility in Ireland|year=2007|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-1-84545-328-2|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since dance is often "associated with the female body and women's experiences",{{sfnp|Dils|Albright|2001|p=96}} female dancers, who dance to entertain, have in some cases been regarded as distinct from "decent" women because they "use their bodies to make a living instead of hiding them as much as possible".{{sfnp|Dils|Albright|2001|p=142}} Society's attitudes to female dancers depend on the culture, its history and the entertainment industry itself. For example, while some cultures regard any dancing by women as "the most shameful form of entertainment",&lt;ref&gt;van Nieuwkerk, Karin. "Changing Images and Shifting Identities: Female Performers in Egypt" in Dils &amp; Albright (2001). p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; other cultures have established venues such as [[strip clubs]] where deliberately erotic or sexually provocative dances such as [[striptease]] are performed in public by professional women dancers for mostly male audiences.

Various political regimes have sought to control or ban dancing or specific types of dancing, sometimes because of disapproval of the music or clothes associated with it. Nationalism, authoritarianism and racism have played a part in banning dances or dancing. For example, during the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] regime, American dances such as [[Swing (dance)|swing]], regarded as "completely un-German", had "become a public offense and needed to be banned".&lt;ref name="Karina"&gt;{{cite book|last=Karina|first=Lilian|title=Hitler's Dancers: German Modern Dance and the Third Reich|year=1999|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=1-57181-300-4|page=174|edition=English language|others=Translated by Jonathan Steinberg|author2=Kant, Marion}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in Shanghai, China, in the 1930s, "dancing and nightclubs had come to symbolise the excess that plagued Chinese society" and officials wondered if "other forms of entertainment such as [[brothel]]s" should also be banned. Banning had the effect of making "the dance craze" even greater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Field |first=Andrew David |title=Shanghai's Dancing World: Cabaret Culture and Urban Politics, 1919–1954 |year=2010 |publisher=The Chinese University of Hong Kong |location=Sha Tin, Hong Kong |isbn=978-962-996-373-6 |page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ireland, the Public Dance Hall Act of 1935 "banned{{snd}} but did not stop{{snd}} dancing at the crossroads and other popular dance forms such as house and [[barn dance]]s."&lt;ref name="Wulff" /&gt; In the US, various dances were once banned, either because like [[burlesque]], they were suggestive,&lt;ref name="Butters"&gt;{{cite book|last=Butters|first=Gerald R.|title=Banned in Kansas: Motion Picture Censorship, 1915–1966|year=2007|publisher=University of Missouri Press|location=Columbia|isbn=978-0-8262-1749-3|page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; or because, like the [[Twist (dance)|Twist]], they were associated with [[African American]]s.&lt;ref name="Pruter"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pruter|first=Robert|title=Chicago Soul|year=1991|publisher=University of Illinois|isbn=0-252-06259-0|page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; "African American dancers were typically banned from performing in [[minstrel show]]s until after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]."&lt;ref name="Hill"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hill|first=Constance Valis|title=Tap Dancing America: A Cultural History|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-539082-7|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dances can be performed [[Solo (dance)|solo]] ('''1''', '''4'''); in pairs, ('''2''', '''3'''); in groups, ('''5''', '''6''', '''7'''); or by massed performers ('''10'''). They might be improvised ('''4''', '''8''') or highly choreographed ('''1''', '''2''', '''5''', '''10'''); spontaneous for personal entertainment, (such as when children begin dancing for themselves); a private audience, ('''4'''); a paying audience ('''2'''); a world audience ('''10'''); or an audience interested in a particular dance genre ('''3''', '''5'''). They might be a part of a celebration, such as a [[wedding]] or [[New Year]] ('''6''', '''8'''); or a cultural ritual with a specific purpose, such as a dance by [[warrior]]s like a [[haka]] ('''7'''). Some dances, such as traditional dance in '''1''' and ballet in '''2''', need a very high level of skill and training; others, such as the [[can-can]], require a very high level of energy and physical fitness. Entertaining the audience is a normal part of dance but its physicality often also produces joy for the dancers themselves ('''9''').

==== Animals ====
Animals have been used for the purposes of entertainment for millennia. They have been hunted for entertainment (as opposed to hunted for food); displayed while they hunt for prey; watched when they compete with each other; and watched while they perform a trained routine for human amusement. The Romans, for example, were entertained both by competitions involving wild animals and acts performed by trained animals. They watched as "lions and bears danced to the music of pipes and [[cymbal]]s; horses were trained to kneel, bow, dance and prance&amp;nbsp;... acrobats turning handsprings over wild lions and vaulting over wild leopards." There were "violent confrontations with wild beasts" and "performances over time became more brutal and bloodier".&lt;ref name="St Leon"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=St Leon|first=Mark|title=Circus: the Australian story|year=2011|publisher=Melbourne Books|location=Melbourne|isbn=978-1-877096-50-1|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animals that perform trained routines or "acts" for human entertainment include fleas in [[flea circus]]es, dolphins in [[Dolphinarium|dolphinaria]], and monkeys doing tricks for an audience on behalf of the player of a [[street organ]]. Animals kept in [[zoo]]s in ancient times were often kept there for later use in the arena as entertainment or for their entertainment value as exotica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hancocks|first=David|title=A different nature: the paradoxical world of zoos and their uncertain future|year=2001|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0-520-23676-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many contests between animals are now regarded as sports{{snd}} for example, [[horse racing]] is regarded as both a sport and an important source of entertainment. Its economic impact means that it is also considered a global industry, one in which horses are carefully transported around the world to compete in races. In Australia, the horse race run on [[Melbourne Cup]] Day is a public holiday and the public regards the race as an important annual event. Like horse racing, [[camel racing]] requires human riders, while [[greyhound racing]] does not. People find it entertaining to watch animals race competitively, whether they are trained, like horses, camels or dogs, or untrained, like [[Cockroach racing|cockroaches]].

The use of animals for entertainment is often controversial, especially the hunting of wild animals. Some contests between animals, once popular entertainment for the public, have become illegal because of the cruelty involved. Among these are [[blood sport]]s such as [[bear-baiting]], [[dog fighting]] and [[cockfighting]]. Other contests involving animals remain controversial and have both supporters and detractors. For example, the conflict between opponents of pigeon shooting who view it as "a cruel and moronic exercise in marksmanship, and proponents, who view it as entertainment" has been tested in a court of law.&lt;ref name=Bronner&gt;An extensive discussion of the legal and cultural issues can be found in {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Bronner|first=Simon J.|title=Killing Tradition: Inside Hunting and Animal Rights Controversies|year=2008|publisher=The University Press of Kentucky|isbn=978-0-8131-2528-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fox hunting]], which involves the use of horses as well as hounds, and [[bullfighting]], which has a strong theatrical component, are two entertainments that have a long and significant cultural history. They both involve animals and are variously regarded as sport, entertainment or cultural tradition&lt;!--don't use 'either' nor 'and/or' in this sentence; 'variously' is used in conjunction with 'or' to mean they're regarded as one, two or three of these things--&gt;. Among the organisations set up to advocate for the rights of animals are some whose concerns include the use of animals for entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;Examples include: [http://www.league.org.uk/ The League against Cruel Sports, UK]; [http://www.peta.org/ People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), multinational]; and [http://www.sharkonline.org/ Showing Animals Respect and Kindness (SHARK), US].&lt;/ref&gt; However, "in many cases of animal advocacy groups versus organisations accused of animal abuse, both sides have cultural claims."{{sfn|Bronner|2008}}

==== Circus ====
{{Main|Circus}}
[[File:Cirque Soleil Stilt 1.jpg|thumb|Children entertained by a [[stilts|stilt]] walker performing in a circus act]]

A [[circus]], described as "one of the most brazen of entertainment forms",&lt;ref name=Stoddart&gt;{{cite book|last=Stoddart|first=Helen|title=Rings of Desire: Circus History and Representation|year=2000|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester, UK &amp; New York|page=13|isbn=0-7190-5233-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a special type of theatrical performance, involving a variety of physical skills such as [[acrobatics]] and [[juggling]] and sometimes performing animals. Usually thought of as a travelling show performed in a [[wikt:big top|big top]], circus was first performed in permanent venues. [[Philip Astley]] is regarded as the founder of the modern circus in the second half of the 18th century and [[Jules Léotard]] is the French performer credited with developing the art of the [[trapeze]], considered synonymous with circuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Diamond|first=Michael|title=Victorian sensation, or, The spectacular, the shocking, and the scandalous in nineteenth-century Britain|year=2003|publisher=Anthem Press|location=London|isbn=1-84331-076-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Astley brought together performances that were generally familiar in traditional British fairs "at least since the beginning of the 17th century": "tumbling, rope-dancing, juggling, animal tricks and so on".&lt;ref name=Stoddart/&gt; It has been claimed that "there is no direct link between the Roman circus and the circus of modern times.&amp;nbsp;... Between the demise of the Roman 'circus' and the foundation of Astley's Amphitheatre in London some 1300 years later, the nearest thing to a circus ring was the rough circle formed by the curious onlookers who gathered around the itinerant tumbler or juggler on a [[village green]]."{{sfnp|St Leon|2011}}

==== Magic ====
{{Main|Magic (illusion)}}
The form of entertainment known as [[Magic (illusion)|stage magic]] or conjuring and recognisable as performance, is based on traditions and texts of magical rites and dogmas that have been a part of most cultural traditions since ancient times. (References to magic, for example, can be found in the [[Bible]], in [[Hermeticism]], in [[Zoroastrianism]], in the [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] tradition, in [[mysticism]] and in the sources of [[Freemasonry]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lévi|first=Éliphas|title=The History of Magic ''(originally published in 1860 as'' Histoire de la Magie ''English edition, translated by A.E.

Stage magic is performed for an audience in a variety of media and locations: on stage, on television, in the street, and live at parties or events. It is often combined with other forms of entertainment, such as comedy or music and [[showmanship (performing)|showmanship]] is often an essential part of magic performances. Performance magic relies on deception, [[psychological manipulation]], sleight of hand and other forms of trickery to give an audience the illusion that a performer can achieve the impossible. Audiences amazed at the [[stunt performer|stunt performances]] and [[Escapology|escape acts]] of [[Harry Houdini]], for example, regarded him as a [[Magic (illusion)|magician]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title=Houdini: the man who walked through walls  | author1=Gresham, William Lindsay  | year=1959  | publisher=Holt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title=The Great Houdini: magician extraordinary  | author1=Epstein, Beryl| author2=Epstein, Sam  | year=1971  | location = Folkestone| publisher=Bailey Brothers and Swinfen (Reprint.

[[Magician (fantasy)|Fantasy magicians]] have held an important place in literature for centuries, offering entertainment to millions of readers. Famous wizards such as [[Merlin]] in the [[Arthurian legends]] have been written about since the 5th and 6th centuries, while in the 21st century, the young wizard [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] became a global entertainment phenomenon when the book series about him sold about 450 million copies (as at June 2011), making it the [[List of book series|best-selling book series in history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rowling 'makes £5 every second'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7649962.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=27 February 2013|date=3 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harry Potter series to be sold as e-books|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-13889578|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=27 February 2013|date=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Street performance ====
[[File:Didgeridoo street player.jpg|thumb|[[Didgeridoo]] player entertaining passers by in the street]]

Street entertainment, [[street performance]] or "busking" are forms of performance that have been meeting the public's need for entertainment for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=David|title=The buskers: a history of street entertainment|year= 1981|publisher=David &amp; Charles|location=Newton Abbot; North Pomfret, Vermont|isbn=0-7153-8026-5|author2=Greenwood, Ben}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was "an integral aspect of London's life", for example, when the city in the early 19th century was "filled with spectacle and diversion".{{sfnp|Ackroyd|2000|p=346 (caption to plate following text pages)}} [[Minstrel]]s or [[troubadour]]s are part of the tradition. The art and practice of busking is still celebrated at annual busking festivals.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [http://www.coffsharbourbuskers.com/ 2012 Coffs Harbour International Buskers and Comedy Festival].&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three basic forms of contemporary street performance. The first form is the "circle show". It tends to gather a crowd, usually has a distinct beginning and end, and is done in conjunction with [[street theatre]], [[puppeteer]]ing, [[magician (illusion)|magicians]], [[comedian]]s, acrobats, [[juggler]]s and sometimes [[musician]]s. This type has the potential to be the most lucrative for the performer because there are likely to be more donations from larger audiences if they are entertained by the act. Good buskers control the crowd so patrons do not obstruct foot traffic. The second form, the ''walk-by act'', has no distinct beginning or end. Typically, the busker provides an entertaining ambience, often with an unusual instrument, and the audience may not stop to watch or form a crowd. Sometimes a walk-by act spontaneously turns into a circle show. The third form, ''café busking'', is performed mostly in restaurants, pubs, bars and cafés. This type of act occasionally uses [[public transport]] as a venue.

==== Parades ====
{{Main|Parade}}
[[Parade]]s are held for a range of purposes, often more than one. Whether their mood is sombre or festive, being public events that are designed to attract attention and activities that necessarily divert normal traffic, parades have a clear entertainment value to their audiences. [[Cavalcade]]s and the modern variant, the [[motorcade]], are examples of public processions. Some people watching the parade or procession may have made a special effort to attend, while others become part of the audience by happenstance. Whatever their mood or primary purpose, parades attract and entertain people who watch them pass by. Occasionally, a parade takes place in an improvised theatre space (such as the [[Trooping the Colour]] in '''8''') and tickets are sold to the physical audience while the global audience participates via broadcast.

One of the earliest forms of parade were "[[Roman triumph|triumphs]]"{{snd}} grand and sensational displays of foreign treasures and spoils, given by triumphant Roman generals to celebrate their victories. They presented conquered peoples and nations that exalted the prestige of the victor. "In the summer of 46&amp;nbsp;[[Before common era|BCE]] [[Julius Caesar]] chose to celebrate four triumphs held on different days extending for about one month."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gurval|first=Robert Alan|title=Actium and Augustus: The Politics and Emotions of Civil War|year=1995|publisher=University of Michigan|isbn=0-472-10590-6|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe from the Middle Ages to the [[Baroque]] the [[Royal Entry]] celebrated the formal visit of the monarch to the city with a parade through elaborately decorated streets, passing various shows and displays. The annual [[Lord Mayor's Show]] in London is an example of a civic parade that has survived since medieval times.

Many religious festivals (especially those that incorporate [[processions]], such as [[Holy Week procession]]s or the Indian festival of [[Holi]]) have some entertainment appeal in addition to their serious purpose. Sometimes, religious rituals have been adapted or evolved into secular entertainments, or like the [[Festa del Redentore]] in Venice, have managed to grow in popularity while holding both secular and sacred purposes in balance. However, [[pilgrimage]]s, such as the Christian pilgrimage of the [[Way of St. James]], the Muslim [[Hajj]] and the Hindu [[Kumbh Mela]], which may appear to the outsider as an entertaining parade or procession, are not intended as entertainment: they are instead about an individual's spiritual journey. Hence, the relationship between spectator and participant, unlike entertainments proper, is different. The manner in which the Kumbh Mela, for example, "is divorced from its cultural context and repackaged for Western consumption{{snd}} renders the presence of [[Voyeurism|voyeurs]] deeply problematic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maclean|first=Kama|title=Pilgrimage and Power: The Kumbh Mela in Allahabad, 1765–1954|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-533894-2|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parades generally impress and delight often by including unusual, colourful costumes ('''7, 10'''). Sometimes they also commemorate ('''5''', '''8''') or celebrate ('''1''', '''4, 6,''' '''8''', '''9'''). Sometimes they have a serious purpose, such as when the context is military ('''1''', '''2''', '''5'''), when the intention is sometimes to intimidate; or religious, when the audience might participate or have a role to play ('''6''', '''7, 10'''). Even if a parade uses new technology and is some distance away ('''9'''), it is likely to have a strong appeal, draw the attention of onlookers and entertain them.

==== Fireworks ====
{{Main|Fireworks}}
[[File:Medellín-Juegos pirotécnicos bicentenario-11.jpg|thumb|Spectators at Bicentennial [[fireworks]] in Colombia]]

[[Fireworks]] are a part of many public entertainments and have retained an enduring popularity since they became a "crowning feature of elaborate celebrations" in the 17th century. First used in China, classical antiquity and Europe for military purposes, fireworks were most popular in the 18th century and high prices were paid for [[Pyrotechnics|pyrotechnists]], especially the skilled Italian ones, who were summoned to other countries to organise displays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Giacomo Casanova|last=Casanova|first=Giacomo Chevalier de Seingalt|title=History of My Life, Volumes 9–10 Vol 10|year=1997|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, Maryland; London|isbn=0-8018-5666-3|page=333|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelly|first=Jack|title=Gunpowder: Alchemy, Bombards, and Pyrotechnics: The History of the Explosive that Changed the World|year=2005|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=0-465-03722-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fire and water were important aspects of court spectacles because the displays "inspired by means of fire, sudden noise, smoke and general magnificence the sentiments thought fitting for the subject to entertain of his sovereign: awe fear and a vicarious sense of glory in his might. Birthdays, name-days, weddings and anniversaries provided the occasion for celebration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sagarra|first=Eda|title=A Social History of Germany 1648–1914|year=2003|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-0-7658-0982-7|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the most famous courtly uses of fireworks was one used to celebrate the end of the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] and while the fireworks themselves caused a fire,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Christopher Hogwood|last=Hogwood|first=Christopher|title=Handel: Water Music and Music for the Royal Fireworks|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-83636-4|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; the accompanying [[Music for the Royal Fireworks]] written by [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] has been popular ever since. Aside from their contribution to entertainments related to military successes, courtly displays and personal celebrations, fireworks are also used as part of religious ceremony. For example, during the Indian [[Dashavatar]]a Kala of Gomantaka "the temple deity is taken around in a procession with a lot of singing, dancing and display of fireworks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Varadpande|first=Manohar Laxman|title=History of Indian Theatre (vol. 2)|year=1992|publisher=Shakti Malik Abhinav Publications|location=New Delhi|isbn=81-7017-278-0|page=286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "fire, sudden noise and smoke" of fireworks is still a significant part of public celebration and entertainment. For example, fireworks were one of the primary forms of display chosen to celebrate the turn of the [[millennium]] around the world. As the clock struck midnight and 1999 became 2000, firework displays and open-air parties greeted the [[New Year]] as the [[time zone]]s changed over to the next century. Fireworks, carefully planned and choreographed, were let off against the backdrop of many of the world's most famous buildings, including the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]], the [[Giza Necropolis|Pyramids of Giza]] in Egypt, the [[Acropolis]] in Athens, [[Red Square]] in Moscow, [[Vatican City]] in Rome, the [[Brandenburg Gate]] in Berlin, the [[Eiffel Tower]] in Paris, and [[Elizabeth Tower]] in London.

=== Sport ===
{{Main|Sport}}
[[File:Tifosi fiorentina.jpg|thumb|Tifosi fiorentina|Audience engagement from a crowd of Italian sport fans]]
[[File:2010 FIFA World Cup Fans.jpg|thumb|Audience engagement by individual South African fans at the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] ]]

[[Sports|Sporting]] competitions have always provided entertainment for crowds. To distinguish the players from the audience, the latter are often known as spectators. Developments in [[stadium]] and [[auditorium]] design, as well as in recording and broadcast technology, have allowed off-site spectators to watch sport, with the result that the size of the audience has grown ever larger and [[spectator sport]] has become increasingly popular. Two of the most popular sports with global appeal are [[association football]] and [[cricket]]. Their ultimate international competitions, the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] and [[test cricket]], are broadcast around the world. Beyond the very large numbers involved in playing these sports, they are notable for being a major source of entertainment for many millions of non-players worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sport Marketing|year=2007|publisher=Human Kinetics|isbn=978-0-7360-6052-3|authors=Hardy, Stephen; Sutton, William Anthony|editor=Mullin, Bernard James}}&lt;/ref&gt; A comparable multi-stage, long-form sport with global appeal is the [[Tour de France]], unusual in that it takes place outside of special stadia, being run instead in the countryside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Christopher S.|title=The Tour de France: A Cultural History|year=2008|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, Los Angeles; London|isbn=978-0-520-25630-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from sports that have world-wide appeal and competitions, such as the [[Olympic Games]], the entertainment value of a sport depends on the culture and country where people play it. For example, in the United States, [[baseball]] and [[basketball]] games are popular forms of entertainment; in Bhutan, the national sport is archery; in New Zealand, it is [[rugby union]]; in Iran, it is [[freestyle wrestling]]. Japan's unique [[sumo]] wrestling contains ritual elements that derive from its long history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kubota|first=Makoto|title=Sumo|year=1999|publisher=Chronicle Books Llc|isbn=0-8118-2548-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, such as the international running group [[Hash House Harriers]], participants create a blend of sport and entertainment for themselves, largely independent of spectator involvement, where the social component is more important than the competitive.

The evolution of an activity into a sport and then an entertainment is also affected by the local climate and conditions. For example, the modern sport of [[History of surfing|surfing]] is associated with Hawaii and that of [[History of skiing|snow skiing]] probably evolved in Scandinavia. While these sports and the entertainment they offer to spectators have spread around the world, people in the two originating countries remain well known for their prowess. Sometimes the climate offers a chance to adapt another sport such as in the case of [[ice hockey]]—an important entertainment in Canada.

=== Fairs, expositions, shopping ===
{{Main|Fair|World's fair}}
[[Fair]]s and exhibitions have existed since ancient and medieval times, displaying wealth, innovations and objects for trade and offering specific entertainments as well as being places of entertainment in themselves.&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Robert|title=Great Exhibitions: The World Fairs 1851–1937|year=2007|publisher=National Gallery of Victoria|isbn=978-0-7241-0284-6|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether in a medieval market or a small shop, "shopping always offered forms of exhilaration that took one away from the everyday".&lt;ref name=Moss&gt;{{cite book|last=Moss|first=Mark Howard|title=Shopping as an Entertainment Experience|year=2007|publisher=Lexington Books|location=Lanham, Maryland; Plymouth, UK|page=3|isbn=978-0-7391-1680-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the modern world, "merchandising has become entertainment: spinning signs, flashing signs, thumping music&amp;nbsp;... video screens, interactive computer kiosks, day care .. cafés".&lt;ref name=Moss/&gt;

By the 19th century, "expos" that encouraged arts, manufactures and commerce had become international. They were not only hugely popular but affected international ideas. For example, the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|1878 Paris Exposition]] facilitated international cooperation about ideas, innovations and standards. From London 1851 to Paris 1900, "in excess of 200 million visitors had entered the turnstiles in London, Paris, Vienna, Philadelphia, Chicago and a myriad of smaller shows around the world."&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World's Colombian Exposition of 1893|url=http://columbus.gl.iit.edu/|publisher=Chicago Illinois Institute of Technology|accessdate=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[World War II]] "well over 500 million visits have been recorded through world expo turnstiles".&lt;ref name=Boisseau&gt;{{cite book|title=Gendering the Fair: Histories of Women and Gender at World's Fairs|year=2010|publisher=University of Illinois|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-252-03558-6|authors=Rydell, Robert; Boisseau, T.J.; Markwyn, Abigail M.; Rydell, Robert W.|editor=Boisseau, T.J.|page=viii}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a form of spectacle and entertainment, expositions influenced "everything from architecture, to patterns of globalisation, to fundamental matters of human identity"&lt;ref name=Boisseau/&gt; and in the process established the close relationship between "fairs, the rise of department stores and art museums",&lt;ref name=Rydell&gt;{{cite book|last=Rydell|first=Robert W.|title=World of Fairs: The Century-of-Progress Expositions|year=1993|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-73236-3|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the modern world of mass consumption and the entertainment industry.

== Safety ==
Some entertainments, such as at large festivals (whether religious or secular), concerts, clubs, parties and celebrations, involve big crowds. From earliest times, crowds at an entertainment have associated hazards and dangers, especially when combined with the recreational consumption of [[Recreational drug use|intoxicants]] such as alcohol. The Ancient Greeks had [[Dionysian Mysteries]], for example, and the Romans had [[Saturnalia]]. The consequence of excess and crowds can produce breaches of [[Norm (social)|social norms]] of behaviour, sometimes causing injury or even death, such as for example, at the [[Altamont Free Concert]], an outdoor [[rock festival]]. The list of [[Nightclub#Serious incidents|serious incidents at nightclubs]] includes those caused by [[stampede]]; overcrowding; terrorism, such as the [[2002 Bali bombings]] that targeted a nightclub; and especially fire. Investigations, such as that carried out in the US after [[The Station nightclub fire]] often demonstrate that lessons learned "regarding fire safety in nightclubs" from earlier events such as the [[Cocoanut Grove fire]] do "not necessarily result in lasting effective change".&lt;ref name=Tubbs&gt;{{cite book|last=Tubbs|first=Jeffrey|title=Egress Design Solutions: A Guide to Evacuation and Crowd Management Planning|year=2007|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-471-71956-4|page=83|author2=Meacham, Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts to prevent such incidents include appointing special officers, such as the medieval [[Lord of Misrule]] or, in modern times, [[security officers]] who control access; and also ongoing improvement of relevant [[International Organization for Standardization|standards]] such as those for building safety. The [[tourism]] industry now regards safety and security at entertainment venues as an important management task.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title=Tourism, security and safety: from theory to practice | author1=Mansfeld, Yoel  | author2=Pizam, Abraham  | date = 2006 |location = Burlington, Mass.|publisher=Elsevier Butterworth-Heinemann  | isbn=0750678984 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industry ==
Although kings, rulers and powerful people have always been able to pay for entertainment to be provided for them and in many cases have paid for public entertainment, people generally have made their own entertainment or when possible, attended a live performance. Technological developments in the 20th century meant that entertainment could be produced independently of the audience, packaged and sold on a commercial basis by an entertainment industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stein|first=Andi|title=An Introduction to the Entertainment Industry|year=2009|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4331-0341-4|author2=Evans, Beth Bingham}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Key issues in the arts and entertainment industry|publisher=Goodfellow Publishers |location=Woodeaton, Oxford|isbn=1-906884-20-X|editor=Walmsley, Ben}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes referred to as [[show business]], the industry relies on [[business model]]s to produce, market, broadcast or otherwise distribute many of its traditional forms, including performances of all types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sickels|first=Robert C|title=The Business of Entertainment|publisher=Greenwood Publishing (Three Volumes)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The industry became so sophisticated that its economics became a separate area of academic study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vogel|first=Harold L.|title=Entertainment industry economics: a guide for financial analysis|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge; New York|isbn=0-521-87485-8|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[film industry]] is a part of the entertainment industry. Components of it include the [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hollywood News|url=http://www.mid-day.com/entertainment/hollywood|accessdate=28 April 2014|newspaper=Mid Day}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bollywood]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bollywood News|url=http://www.mid-day.com/entertainment/bollywood|publisher=Mid Day|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; film industries, as well as the [[cinema of the United Kingdom]] and all the [[Cinema of Europe|cinemas of Europe]], including [[cinema of France|France]], [[cinema of Germany|Germany]], [[cinema of Spain|Spain]], [[Cinema of Italy|Italy]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Casper|first=Drew|title=Postwar Hollywood, 1946–1962|year=2007|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1-4051-5074-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sex industry]] is another component of the entertainment industry, applying the same forms and media (for example, film, books, dance and other performances) to the development, marketing and sale of sex products on a commercial basis.

[[Amusement park]]s entertain paying guests with [[rides]], such as [[roller coasters]], [[ridable miniature railway]]s, [[water rides]], and [[dark rides]], as well as other events and associated attractions. The parks are built on a large area subdivided into themed areas named "lands". Sometimes the whole amusement park is based on one theme, such as the various [[SeaWorld]] parks that focus on the theme of sea life.

One of the consequences of the development of the entertainment industry has been the creation of new types of [[employment]]. While jobs such as [[writer]], musician and [[composer]] exist as they always have, people doing this work are likely to be employed by a company rather than a patron as they once would have been. New jobs have appeared, such as [[Gaffer (filmmaking)|gaffer]] or [[special effect]]s supervisor in the film industry, and attendants in an amusement park.

Prestigious [[List of prizes, medals, and awards|awards are given by the industry]] for excellence in the various types of entertainment. For example, there are awards for Music, Games (including video games), Comics, Comedy, Theatre, Television, Film, Dance and Magic. Sporting awards are made for the results and skill, rather than for the entertainment value.

== Architecture ==

=== Architecture for entertainment ===
Purpose-built structures as venues for entertainment that accommodate audiences have produced many famous and innovative buildings, among the most recognisable of which are [[Theatre (structure)|theatre structures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Newhouse|first=Victoria|title=Site and sound: the architecture and acoustics of new opera houses and concert halls|year=2012|publisher=Monacelli Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-58093-281-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the ancient Greeks, "the architectural importance of the theatre is a reflection of their importance to the community, made apparent in their monumentality, in the effort put into their design, and in the care put into their detail."&lt;ref name=MacLeod&gt;Green, J.R. "The Theatre of Paphos and the Theatre of Alexandria: Some First Thoughts" in {{cite book |title=The Library of Alexandria |year=2002 |publisher=The American University in Cairo Press |location=Cairo |isbn=977-424-710-8 |editor=MacLeod, Roy}} p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans subsequently developed the stadium in an oval form known as a [[Circus (building)|circus]]. In modern times, some of the grandest buildings for entertainment have brought fame to their cities as well as their designers. The [[Sydney Opera House]], for example, is a [[World Heritage Site]] and [[The O₂ (London)|The O₂]] in London is an entertainment precinct that contains an indoor [[arena]], a music club, a cinema and exhibition space. The [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus]] in Germany is a theatre designed and built for performances of one specific musical composition.

Two of the chief architectural concerns for the design of venues for mass audiences are speed of egress and safety. The speed at which the venue empty is important both for amenity and safety, because large crowds take a long time to disperse from a badly designed venue, which creates a safety risk. The [[Hillsborough disaster]] is an example of how poor aspects of building design can contribute to audience deaths. [[Sightline]]s and [[acoustics]] are also important design considerations in most theatrical venues.

In the 21st century, entertainment venues, especially stadia, are "likely to figure among the leading architectural genres".&lt;ref name=Sheard&gt;{{cite book|last=Sheard|first=Rod|title=Sports Architecture|year=2001|publisher=Spon Press|location=London|isbn=0-419-21220-5|ref=CITEREFSheard2001}} p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; However, they require "a whole new approach" to design, because they need to be "sophisticated entertainment centres, multi-experience venues, capable of being enjoyed in many diverse ways".{{sfnp|Sheard|2001|p=xvi}} Hence, architects now have to design "with two distinct functions in mind, as sports and entertainment centres playing host to live audiences, and as sports and entertainment studios serving the viewing and listening requirements of the remote audience".{{sfnp|Sheard|2001|p=xvi}}

=== Architecture as entertainment ===
[[File:Sleepingbeautycastle50.jpg|[[Sleeping Beauty]]|thumb|left|Inauthentic castle in [[Disneyland]] amusement park]]
Architects who push the boundaries of design or construction sometimes create buildings that are entertaining because they exceed the expectations of the public and the client and are aesthetically outstanding. Buildings such as [[Guggenheim Museum Bilbao]], designed by [[Frank Gehry]], are of this type, becoming a tourist attraction as well as a significant international museum. Other apparently usable buildings are really [[folly|follies]], deliberately constructed for a decorative purpose and never intended to be practical.

On the other hand, sometimes architecture is entertainment, while pretending to be functional. The tourism industry, for example, creates or renovates buildings as "attractions" that have either never been used or can never be used for their ostensible purpose. They are instead re-purposed to entertain visitors often by simulating cultural experiences. Buildings, history and sacred spaces are thus made into commodities for purchase. Such intentional tourist attractions divorce buildings from the past so that "the difference between historical authenticity and contemporary entertainment venues/theme parks becomes hard to define".&lt;ref name=Lasansky&gt;{{cite book|ref=CITEREFLasansky2004|last=Lasansky|first=D.

== Effects of developments in electronic media ==

=== Globalisation ===
By the second half of the 20th century, developments in electronic [[Media (communication)|media]] made possible the delivery of entertainment products to mass audiences across the globe. The technology enabled people to see, hear and participate in all the familiar forms{{snd}} stories, theatre, music, dance{{snd}} wherever they live. The rapid development of entertainment technology was assisted by improvements in [[data storage device]]s such as [[Compact Cassette|cassette tapes]] or [[compact disc]]s, along with increasing [[miniaturisation]]. Computerisation and the development of [[barcodes]] also made ticketing easier, faster and global.

=== Obsolescence ===
In the 1940s, [[radio]] was the electronic medium for family entertainment and information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Garratt|first=G.R.M.|title=The early history of radio: from Faraday to Marconi|year=1994|publisher=Institution of Electrical Engineers, in association with the Science Museum|location=London|isbn=0-85296-845-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Radio reader: essays in the cultural history of radio|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-415-92820-6|editor1=Hilmes, Michele |editor2=Loviglio, Jason }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cox|first=Jim|title=The great radio sitcoms|year=2007|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|isbn=978-0-7864-3146-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, it was [[television]] that was the new medium and it rapidly became global, bringing visual entertainment, first in black and white, then in colour, to the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spigel|first=Lynn|title=Make room for TV: television and the family ideal in postwar America|year=1992|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-76966-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1970s, [[history of video games|games]] could be played electronically, then [[Handheld video game|hand-held]] devices provided mobile entertainment, and by the last decade of the 20th century, via [[online game|networked play]]. In combination with products from the entertainment industry, all the traditional forms of entertainment became available personally. People could not only select an entertainment product such as a piece of music, film or game, they could choose the time and place to use it. The "proliferation of portable media players and the emphasis on the computer as a site for film consumption" together have significantly changed how audiences encounter films.&lt;ref name=Tryon&gt;{{cite book|last=Tryon|first=Chuck|title=Reinventing Cinema: Movies in the Age of Media Convergence|year=2009|publisher=Rutgers University Press|pages=6, 9|isbn=978-0-8135-4546-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most notable consequences of the rise of electronic entertainment has been the rapid [[obsolescence]] of the various recording and storage methods. As an example of speed of change driven by electronic media, over the course of one generation, television as a medium for receiving standardised entertainment products went from unknown, to novel, to ubiquitous and finally to superseded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Television after TV: Essays on a Medium in Transition|year=2004|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0-8223-3383-X|editors=Spigel, Lynn; Olsson, Jan}}&lt;/ref&gt; One estimate was that by 2011 over 30 percent of households in the US would own a [[Wii]] console, "about the same percentage that owned a television in 1953".&lt;ref name=Cogburn&gt;{{cite book|last=Cogburn|first=Jon|title=Philosophy Through Video Games|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-415-98857-8|page=i|author2=Silcox, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some expected that halfway through the second decade of the 21st century, online entertainment would have completely replaced television—which didn't happen. The so-called "[[digital revolution]]" has produced an increasingly transnational marketplace that has caused difficulties for governments, business, industries, and individuals, as they all try to keep up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Doyle|first=Gillian|title=Media Ownership: The Economics and Politics of Convergence and Concentration in the UK and European Media|year=2002|publisher=SAGE|format=Google eBook|isbn=0-7619-6680-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellis|first=John|title=Scheduling: the last creative act in television?|journal=Media Culture Society|date=January 2000|volume=22|series=Bournemouth University/Large Door Productions|issue=1|pages=25–38|doi=10.1177/016344300022001002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For example, in the UK: {{cite web|last=Tryhorn|first=Chris|title=Government thinktank to tackle media convergence issues|url=http://www.dbcde.gov.au/digital_economy/convergence_review|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=22 November 2012|date=21 December 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121121120032/http://www.dbcde.gov.au/digital_economy/convergence_review|archivedate=21 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;And for example, in Australia: {{cite web|title=Convergence Review|url=http://www.dbcde.gov.au/digital_economy/convergence_review|date=30 April 2012|publisher=Australian Government: Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy|accessdate=23 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121121120032/http://www.dbcde.gov.au/digital_economy/convergence_review|archivedate=21 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the sports stadium of the future will increasingly compete with television viewing "...in terms of comfort, safety and the constant flow of audio-visual information and entertainment available."{{sfnp|Sheard|2001|p=49}} Other flow on effects of the shift are likely to include those on public architecture such as hospitals and nursing homes, where television, regarded as an essential entertainment service for patients and residents, will need to be replaced by access to the internet. At the same time, the ongoing need for entertainers as "professional engagers" shows the continuity of traditional entertainment.&lt;ref name=Power&gt;{{cite news|last=Power|first=Julie|title=Laughter and music better than drugs for dementia patients|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/health/laughter-and-music-better-than-drugs-for-dementia-patients-20130802-2r4w9.html|accessdate=3 August 2013|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Convergence ===
By the second decade of the 21st century, [[analogue recording]] was being replaced by [[digital recording]] and all forms of electronic entertainment began to [[technological convergence|converge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dwyer|first=Tim|title=Media Convergence|year=2010|publisher=Open University Press McGraw-Hill Education|location=Maidenhead, Berkshire, England and New York|isbn=978-0-335-22873-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, convergence is challenging standard practices in the film industry: whereas "success or failure used to be determined by the first weekend of its run. Today,&amp;nbsp;... a series of exhibition 'windows', such as DVD, pay-per-view, and fibre-optic video-on-demand are used to maximise profits."{{sfnp|Sayre|King|2010|p=156}} Part of the industry's adjustment is its release of new commercial product directly via video hosting services. Media convergence is said to be more than technological: the convergence is cultural as well.{{sfnp|Sayre|King|2010|pp=22, 30 ''ff''}} It is also "the result of a deliberate effort to protect the interests of business entities, policy institutions and other groups".&lt;ref name=Tryon/&gt; Globalisation and [[cultural imperialism]] are two of the cultural consequences of convergence.{{sfnp|Sayre|King|2010|p=30}} Others include [[fandom]] and interactive storytelling as well as the way that single franchises are distributed through and affect a range of delivery methods.&lt;ref name=Jenkins&gt;{{cite book|last=Jenkins|first=Henry|title=Convergence culture: where old and new media collide|year=2006|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-8147-4281-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "greater diversity in the ways that signals may be received and packaged for the viewer, via terrestrial, satellite or cable television, and of course, via the Internet" also affects entertainment venues, such as sports stadia, which now need to be designed so that both live and remote audiences can interact in increasingly sophisticated ways{{snd}} for example, audiences can "watch highlights, call up statistics", "order tickets and merchandise" and generally "tap into the stadium's resources at any time of the day or night".{{sfnp|Sheard|2001|p=xvi}}

The introduction of television altered the availability, cost, variety and quality of entertainment products for the public and the convergence of online entertainment is having a similar effect. For example, the possibility and popularity of user-generated content, as distinct from commercial product, creates a "networked audience model [that] makes programming obsolete".{{sfnp|Sayre|King|2010|p=536}} Individuals and corporations use [[video hosting service]]s to broadcast content that is equally accepted by the public as legitimate entertainment.

While technology increases demand for entertainment products and offers increased speed of delivery, the forms that make up the content are in themselves, relatively stable. Storytelling, music, theatre, dance and games are recognisably the same as in earlier centuries.

{{Evolutionary biology}}

'''Evolutionary psychology''' is a theoretical approach in the [[social science|social]] and [[natural science]]s that examines psychological structure from a modern [[evolution]]ary perspective. It seeks to identify which human psychological traits are evolved [[adaptation]]s – that is, the functional products of [[natural selection]] or [[sexual selection in human evolution]]. [[Adaptationist]] thinking about physiological mechanisms, such as the heart, lungs, and immune system, is common in [[evolutionary biology]]. Some evolutionary psychologists apply the same thinking to psychology, arguing that the [[modularity of mind]] is similar to that of the body and with different modular adaptations serving different functions. Evolutionary psychologists argue that much of human behavior is the output of [[psychological adaptation]]s that evolved to solve recurrent problems in human ancestral environments.&lt;ref&gt;Confer et al. 2010; Buss, 2005; Durrant &amp; Ellis, 2003; Pinker, 2002; Tooby &amp; Cosmides, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the same evolutionary psychologists also suggest that it is not simply a subdiscipline of psychology but that evolutionary theory can provide a foundational, [[Metatheory|metatheoretical]] framework that integrates the entire field of psychology in the same way evolution has for biology.&lt;ref name=Cosmides/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duntley and Buss 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carmen, R.A., et al. (2013). Evolution Integrated Across All Islands of the Human Behavioral Archipelago: All Psychology as Evolutionary Psychology. EvoS Journal: The Journal of the Evolutionary Studies Consortium, 5, pp. 108–26. {{ISSN|1944-1932}} [http://evostudies.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Carmen_-Vol5Iss1.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolutionary psychologists hold that behaviors or traits that occur universally in all cultures are good candidates for evolutionary adaptations&lt;ref name=Psychology&gt;Schacter et al. 2007, pp. 26–27&lt;/ref&gt; including the abilities to infer others' emotions, discern kin from non-kin, identify and prefer healthier mates, and cooperate with others. They report successful tests of theoretical predictions related to such topics as [[infanticide]], [[intelligence]], [[marriage]] patterns, [[promiscuity]], perception of [[beauty]], [[bride price]], and [[parental investment]].&lt;ref name=social-behavior&gt;"Despite this difficulty, there have been many careful and informative studies of human social behavior from an evolutionary perspective. Infanticide, intelligence, marriage patterns, promiscuity, perception of beauty, bride price, altruism, and the allocation of parental care have all been explored by testing predictions derived from the idea that conscious and unconscious behaviours have evolved to maximize inclusive fitness. The findings have been impressive." "social behaviour, animal." Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica, 2011. Web. 23 January 2011. [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/550897/animal-social-behaviour].&lt;/ref&gt;

The theories and findings of evolutionary psychology have applications in many fields, including economics, environment, health, law, management, [[psychiatry]], politics, and literature.&lt;ref name=Oxford2007&gt;The Oxford Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, Edited by Robin Dunbar and Louise Barret, Oxford University Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, edited by David M. Buss, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Criticism of evolutionary psychology]] involves questions of testability, cognitive and evolutionary assumptions (such as modular functioning of the brain, and large uncertainty about the ancestral environment), importance of non-genetic and non-adaptive explanations, as well as political and ethical issues due to interpretations of research results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rose |first=Hilary |title=Alas, Poor Darwin : Arguments Against Evolutionary Psychology |year=2000 |publisher=Harmony; 1 Amer ed edition (10 October 2000) |isbn=0-609-60513-5 |url=https://www.amazon.com/Alas-Poor-Darwin-Evolutionary-Psychology/dp/0609605135}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520236202|title=The Trouble with Nature: Sex in Science and Popular Culture|last=Lancaster|first=Roger|publisher=University of California Press|year=2003|isbn=9780520236202|location=Berkeley|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==

===Principles===
Evolutionary psychology is an approach that views [[human nature]] as the product of a universal set of evolved psychological adaptations to recurring problems in the ancestral environment. Proponents suggest that it seeks to integrate psychology into the other natural sciences, rooting it in the organizing theory of biology ([[evolutionary theory]]), and thus understanding [[psychology]] as a branch of [[biology]]. Anthropologist [[John Tooby]] and psychologist [[Leda Cosmides]] note:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Evolutionary psychology is the long-forestalled scientific attempt to assemble out of the disjointed, fragmentary, and mutually contradictory human disciplines a single, logically integrated research framework for the psychological, social, and behavioral sciences – a framework
that not only incorporates the evolutionary sciences on a full and equal basis, but that systematically works out all of the revisions in existing belief and research practice that such a synthesis requires.&lt;ref&gt;Tooby &amp; Cosmides 2005, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Just as human [[physiology]] and [[evolutionary physiology]] have worked to identify physical adaptations of the body that represent "human physiological nature," the purpose of evolutionary psychology is to identify evolved emotional and cognitive adaptations that represent "human psychological nature." According to [[Steven Pinker]], it is "not a single theory but a large set of hypotheses" and a term that "has also come to refer to a particular way of applying evolutionary theory to the mind, with an emphasis on adaptation, gene-level selection, and modularity." Evolutionary psychology adopts an understanding of the mind that is based on the [[computational theory of mind]]. It describes mental processes as computational operations, so that, for example, a fear response is described as arising from a neurological computation that inputs the perceptional data, e.g. a visual image of a spider, and outputs the appropriate reaction, e.g. fear of possibly dangerous animals. Under this view, any [[Domain-general learning]] is impossible because of the [[Combinatorial explosion]]. This implies [[Domain-specific learning]]. Evolutionary Psychology specifies the domain as the problems of survival and reproduction. &lt;ref&gt; Buss, David M. "Evolutionary Psychology: The New Science of The Mind" 5th edition. pages 28-29. &lt;/ref&gt; 

While philosophers have generally considered the human mind to include broad faculties, such as reason and lust, evolutionary psychologists describe evolved psychological mechanisms as narrowly focused to deal with specific issues, such as catching cheaters or choosing mates. The discipline views the [[human brain]] as comprising many functional mechanisms,{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} called ''psychological adaptations'' or evolved cognitive mechanisms or ''[[cognitive modules]]'', designed by the process of natural selection. Examples include [[language acquisition|language-acquisition modules]], [[Westermarck effect|incest-avoidance mechanisms]], [[Wason selection task|cheater-detection mechanisms]], intelligence and sex-specific mating preferences, foraging mechanisms, alliance-tracking mechanisms, agent-detection mechanisms, and others. Some mechanisms, termed ''domain-specific'', deal with recurrent adaptive problems over the course of human evolutionary history.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} ''Domain-general'' mechanisms, on the other hand, are proposed to deal with evolutionary novelty.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Evolutionary psychology has roots in [[cognitive psychology]] and evolutionary biology but also draws on [[behavioral ecology]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[genetics]], [[ethology]], [[anthropology]], [[archaeology]], biology, and [[zoology]]. It is closely linked to [[sociobiology]],&lt;ref name=Psychology/&gt; but there are key differences between them including the emphasis on ''domain-specific'' rather than ''domain-general'' mechanisms, the relevance of measures of current [[fitness (biology)|fitness]], the importance of [[mismatch theory]], and psychology rather than behavior. Most of what is now labeled as sociobiological research is now confined to the field of behavioral ecology.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

{{Main article|History of evolutionary psychology}}
Evolutionary psychology has its historical roots in [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of natural selection.&lt;ref name=Psychology /&gt; In ''The Origin of Species'', Darwin predicted that psychology would develop an evolutionary basis:
{{quote|In the distant future I see open fields for far more important researches. Psychology will be based on a new foundation, that of the necessary acquirement of each mental power and capacity by gradation.|{{cite wikisource |first=Charles |last=Darwin |title=The Origin of Species |year=1859 |page=488 |wslink=Page%3AOrigin_of_Species_1859_facsimile.djvu/500}}}}
Two of his later books were devoted to the study of animal emotions and psychology; ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex]]'' in 1871 and ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]'' in 1872. Darwin's work inspired [[William James]]'s functionalist approach to psychology.&lt;ref name=Psychology/&gt; Darwin's theories of evolution, adaptation, and natural selection have provided insight into why brains function the way they do.&lt;ref name=Schacter&gt;{{cite book |last=Schacter |title=Psychology 2nd Ed. |publisher=Worth Publishers |isbn=978-1-4292-3719-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schacter |first=Daniel L. |title=Psychology |year=2011 |publisher=Worth Publishers |location=New York, NY |page=26 |edition=2 |first2=Daniel T. |last2=Gilbert |first3=Daniel M. |last3=Wegner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The content of evolutionary psychology has derived from, on the one hand, the biological sciences (especially [[evolution]]ary theory as it relates to ancient human environments, the study of [[paleoanthropology]] and animal behavior) and, on the other, the human sciences, especially psychology.

Evolutionary biology as an [[academic discipline]] emerged with the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] in the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Sterelny, Kim. 2009. In Ruse, Michael &amp; Travis, Joseph (eds) Wilson, Edward O. (Foreword) Evolution: The First Four Billion Years. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Ma. {{ISBN|978-0-674-03175-3}}. p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s the study of animal behavior (ethology) emerged with the work of the Dutch biologist Nikolaas Tinbergen and the Austrian biologists [[Konrad Lorenz]] and [[Karl von Frisch]].

W.D. Hamilton's (1964) papers on [[inclusive fitness]] and [[Robert Trivers]]'s (1972)&lt;ref name=Trivers1971&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=2822435 |pages=35–57 |last1=Trivers |first1=R. L. |title=The Evolution of Reciprocal Altruism |volume=46 |issue=1 |journal=[[The Quarterly Review of Biology]] |year=1971 |doi=10.1086/406755}}&lt;/ref&gt; theories on [[reciprocity (evolution)|reciprocity]] and parental investment helped to establish evolutionary thinking in psychology and the other social sciences. In 1975, [[E.O. Wilson|Edward O. Wilson]] combined evolutionary theory with studies of animal and social behavior, building on the works of Lorenz and Tinbergen, in his book ''[[Sociobiology: The New Synthesis]]''.

In the 1970s, two major branches developed from ethology. Firstly, the study of animal ''social'' behavior (including humans) generated [[sociobiology]], defined by its pre-eminent proponent Edward O. Wilson in 1975 as "the systematic study of the biological basis of all social behavior"&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Edward O. 1975.[http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog/WILSOR.html ''Sociobiology: The New Synthesis''.] Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Ma. {{ISBN|0-674-00089-7}} p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1978 as "the extension of population biology and evolutionary theory to social organization."&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Edward O. 1978. ''On Human Nature''. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Ma. p. x.&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, there was behavioral ecology which placed less emphasis on ''social'' behavior; it focused on the ecological and evolutionary basis of animal and [[human behavioral ecology|human]] behavior.

In the 1970s and 1980s university departments began to include the term ''evolutionary biology'' in their titles. The modern era of evolutionary psychology was ushered in, in particular, by [[Donald Symons]]' 1979 book ''[[The Evolution of Human Sexuality]]'' and [[Leda Cosmides]] and [[John Tooby]]'s 1992 book ''[[The Adapted Mind]]''.&lt;ref name=Psychology/&gt;

From psychology there are the primary streams of [[developmental psychology|developmental]], [[social psychology|social]] and cognitive psychology. Establishing some measure of the relative influence of genetics and environment on behavior has been at the core of [[Behavioural genetics|behavioral genetics]] and its variants, notably studies at the molecular level that examine the relationship between genes, neurotransmitters and behavior. [[Dual inheritance theory]] (DIT), developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s, has a slightly different perspective by trying to explain how [[human behavior]] is a product of two different and interacting evolutionary processes: [[genetic evolution]] and [[cultural evolution]]. DIT is seen by some as a "middle-ground" between views that emphasize human universals versus those that emphasize cultural variation.&lt;ref&gt;Laland, Kevin N. and Gillian R. Brown. 2002.

==Theoretical foundations==
{{Main article|Theoretical foundations of evolutionary psychology}}
The theories on which evolutionary psychology is based originated with Charles Darwin's work, including his speculations about the evolutionary origins of social instincts in humans. Modern evolutionary psychology, however, is possible only because of advances in evolutionary theory in the 20th century.

Evolutionary psychologists say that natural selection has provided humans with many psychological adaptations, in much the same way that it generated humans' anatomical and physiological adaptations.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-Steven-J-C-2003-pp.25-56&gt;Gaulin and McBurney 2003 pp. 25–56.&lt;/ref&gt; As with adaptations in general, psychological adaptations are said to be specialized for the environment in which an organism evolved, the environment of evolutionary adaptedness.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-Steven-J-C-2003-pp.25-56/&gt;&lt;ref name=Economics-2003&gt;See also "Environment of evolutionary adaptation," a variation of the term used in Economics, e.g., in {{cite journal | last1 = Rubin | first1 = Paul H | year = 2003 | title = Folk economics | journal = Southern Economic Journal | volume = 70 | issue = 1| pages = 157–71 | doi=10.2307/1061637}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual selection provides organisms with adaptations related to mating.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-Steven-J-C-2003-pp.25-56/&gt; For male [[mammal]]s, which have a relatively high maximal potential reproduction rate, sexual selection leads to adaptations that help them compete for females.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-Steven-J-C-2003-pp.25-56/&gt; For female mammals, with a relatively low maximal potential reproduction rate, sexual selection leads to choosiness, which helps females select higher quality mates.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-Steven-J-C-2003-pp.25-56/&gt; Charles Darwin described both natural selection and sexual selection, and he relied on group selection to explain the evolution of [[Altruism|altruistic]] (self-sacrificing) behavior. But group selection was considered a weak explanation, because in any group the less altruistic individuals will be more likely to survive, and the group will become less self-sacrificing as a whole.

In 1964, [[W.D. Hamilton|William D. Hamilton]] proposed [[inclusive fitness]] theory, emphasizing a [[gene-centered view of evolution]]. Hamilton noted that genes can increase the replication of copies of themselves into the next generation by influencing the organism's social traits in such a way that (statistically) results in helping the survival and reproduction of other copies of the same genes (most simply, identical copies in the organism's close relatives). According to [[Hamilton's rule]], self-sacrificing behaviors (and the genes influencing them) can evolve if they typically help the organism's close relatives so much that it more than compensates for the individual animal's sacrifice. Inclusive fitness theory resolved the issue of how altruism can evolve. Other theories also help explain the evolution of altruistic behavior, including [[evolutionary game theory]], [[tit-for-tat]] reciprocity, and generalized reciprocity. These theories help to explain the development of altruistic behavior, and account for hostility toward cheaters (individuals that take advantage of others' altruism).&lt;ref name=moralanimal/&gt;

Several mid-level evolutionary theories inform evolutionary psychology. The [[r/K selection]] theory proposes that some species prosper by having many offspring, while others follow the strategy of having fewer offspring but investing much more in each one. Humans follow the second strategy. Parental investment theory explains how parents invest more or less in individual offspring based on how successful those offspring are likely to be, and thus how much they might improve the parents' inclusive fitness. According to the [[Trivers-Willard hypothesis]], parents in good conditions tend to invest more in sons (who are best able to take advantage of good conditions), while parents in poor conditions tend to invest more in daughters (who are best able to have successful offspring even in poor conditions). According to [[life history theory]], animals evolve life histories to match their environments, determining details such as age at first reproduction and number of offspring. Dual inheritance theory posits that genes and human culture have interacted, with genes affecting the development of culture, and culture, in turn, affecting human evolution on a genetic level (see also the [[Baldwin effect]]).

==Evolved psychological mechanisms==
{{Main article|psychological adaptation|l1=Evolved psychological mechanisms}}
Evolutionary psychology is based on the hypothesis that, just like hearts, lungs, livers, kidneys, and immune systems, cognition has functional structure that has a genetic basis, and therefore has evolved by natural selection. Like other organs and tissues, this functional structure should be universally shared amongst a species, and should solve important problems of survival and [[reproduction]].

Evolutionary psychologists seek to understand psychological mechanisms by understanding the survival and reproductive functions they might have served over the course of evolutionary history.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} These might include abilities to infer others' emotions, discern kin from non-kin, identify and prefer healthier mates, cooperate with others and follow leaders. Consistent with the theory of natural selection, evolutionary psychology sees humans as often in conflict with others, including mates and relatives. For instance, a mother may wish to wean her offspring from breastfeeding earlier than does her infant, which frees up the mother to invest in additional offspring.&lt;ref name=moralanimal/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scilib-biology.narod.ru/MoralAnimal/index_en.html |title=The Moral Animal: Why We Are The Way We Are: The New Science of Evolutionary Psychology |accessdate=15 October 2013 |first=Robert |last=Wright}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary psychology also recognizes the role of kin selection and reciprocity in evolving prosocial traits such as altruism.&lt;ref name=moralanimal/&gt; Like [[chimpanzee]]s and [[bonobo]]s, humans have subtle and flexible social instincts, allowing them to form extended families, lifelong friendships, and political alliances.&lt;ref name=moralanimal/&gt; In studies testing theoretical predictions, evolutionary psychologists have made modest findings on topics such as infanticide, intelligence, marriage patterns, promiscuity, perception of beauty, bride price and parental investment.&lt;ref name=social-behavior/&gt;

===Historical topics===
Proponents of evolutionary psychology in the 1990s made some explorations in historical events, but the response from historical experts was highly negative and there has been little effort to continue that line of research. Historian [[Lynn Hunt]] says that the historians complained that the researchers:
:have read the wrong studies, misinterpreted the results of experiments, or worse yet, turned to neuroscience looking for a universalizing, anti-representational and anti-intentional ontology to bolster their claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hunt | first1 = Lynn | year = 2014 | title = The Self and Its History | url = | journal = American Historical Review | volume = 119 | issue = 5| pages = 1576–86 | doi=10.1093/ahr/119.5.1576}} quote p 1576.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hunt states that, "the few attempts to build up a subfield of psychohistory collapsed under the weight of its presuppositions." She concludes that as of 2014 the "'iron curtain' between historians and psychology...remains standing."&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, "The Self and Its History." p. 1578.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Products of evolution: adaptations, exaptations, byproducts, and random variation===
Not all traits of organisms are evolutionary adaptations. As noted in the table below, traits may also be [[exaptation]]s, byproducts of adaptations (sometimes called "spandrels"), or random variation between individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Buss et al. 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychological adaptations are hypothesized to be innate or relatively easy to learn, and to manifest in cultures worldwide. For example, the ability of toddlers to learn a language with virtually no training is likely to be a psychological adaptation. On the other hand, ancestral humans did not read or write, thus today, learning to read and write require extensive training, and presumably represent byproducts of cognitive processing that use psychological adaptations designed for other functions.&lt;ref&gt;Pinker, Steven. (1994) The Language Instinct&lt;/ref&gt; However, variations in manifest behavior can result from universal mechanisms interacting with different local environments. For example, Caucasians who move from a northern climate to the equator will have darker skin. The mechanisms regulating their pigmentation do not change; rather the input to those mechanisms change, resulting in different output.

One of the tasks of evolutionary psychology is to identify which psychological traits are likely to be adaptations, byproducts or random variation. [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]] suggested that an "adaptation is a special and onerous concept that should only be used where it is really necessary."&lt;ref&gt;George C Williams, ''Adaptation and Natural Selection''. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by Williams and others, adaptations can be identified by their improbable complexity, species universality, and adaptive functionality.

===Obligate and facultative adaptations===
A question that may be asked about an adaptation is whether it is generally obligate (relatively robust in the face of typical environmental variation) or facultative (sensitive to typical environmental variation).&lt;ref name=Buss-D-M-2011&gt;Buss, D. M. (2011). Evolutionary psychology.&lt;/ref&gt; The sweet taste of sugar and the pain of hitting one's knee against concrete are the result of fairly obligate psychological adaptations; typical environmental variability during development does not much affect their operation. By contrast, facultative adaptations are somewhat like "if-then" statements. For example, adult attachment style seems particularly sensitive to early childhood experiences. As adults, the propensity to develop close, trusting bonds with others is dependent on whether early childhood caregivers could be trusted to provide reliable assistance and attention. The adaptation for skin to tan is conditional to exposure to sunlight; this is an example of another facultative adaptation. When a psychological adaptation is facultative, evolutionary psychologists concern themselves with how developmental and environmental inputs influence the expression of the adaptation.

===Cultural universals===
{{main article|Cultural universal}}
Evolutionary psychologists hold that behaviors or traits that occur universally in all cultures are good candidates for evolutionary adaptations.&lt;ref name=Psychology/&gt; Cultural universals include behaviors related to language, cognition, social roles, gender roles, and technology.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald E. Brown|Brown, Donald E.]] (1991) Human Universals. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; Evolved psychological adaptations (such as the ability to learn a language) interact with cultural inputs to produce specific behaviors (e.g., the specific language learned). Basic gender differences, such as greater eagerness for sex among men and greater coyness among women,&lt;ref&gt;Symons, D. (1979). The evolution of human sexuality. Oxford: Oxford University Press. Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt; are explained as sexually dimorphic psychological adaptations that reflect the different reproductive strategies of males and females.&lt;ref name=moralanimal/&gt;&lt;ref name=BS&gt;Pinker 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary psychologists contrast their approach to what they term the "[[standard social science model]]," according to which the mind is a general-purpose cognition device shaped almost entirely by culture.&lt;ref&gt;Barkow et al. 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=instinct&gt;"instinct." Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica, 2011. Web. 18 February 2011. [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/289249/instinct].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environment of evolutionary adaptedness==
{{Main article|Human evolution}}
Evolutionary psychology argues that to properly understand the functions of the brain, one must understand the properties of the environment in which the brain evolved. That environment is often referred to as the "environment of evolutionary adaptedness".&lt;ref name=Economics-2003/&gt;

The idea of an ''environment of evolutionary adaptedness'' was first explored as a part of [[attachment theory]] by [[John Bowlby]].&lt;ref name=Bowlby1969&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowlby |first=John |title=Attachment |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |year=1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the environment to which a particular evolved mechanism is adapted. More specifically, the environment of evolutionary adaptedness is defined as the set of historically recurring selection pressures that formed a given adaptation, as well as those aspects of the environment that were necessary for the proper development and functioning of the adaptation.

Humans, comprising the genus ''[[Homo (genus)|Homo]]'', appeared between 1.5 and 2.5 million years ago, a time that roughly coincides with the start of the [[Pleistocene]] 2.6 million years ago. Because the Pleistocene ended a mere 12,000 years ago, most human adaptations either newly evolved during the Pleistocene, or were maintained by [[stabilizing selection]] during the Pleistocene. Evolutionary psychology therefore proposes that the majority of human psychological mechanisms are adapted to reproductive problems frequently encountered in Pleistocene environments.&lt;ref name=Symons1992&gt;{{cite book |last=Symons |first=Donald |authorlink=Donald Symons |chapter=On the use and misuse of Darwinism in the study of human behavior |title=The Adapted Mind: Evolutionary psychology and the generation of culture |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1992 |pages=137–59 |isbn=0-19-510107-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In broad terms, these problems include those of growth, development, differentiation, maintenance, mating, parenting, and social relationships.

The environment of evolutionary adaptedness is significantly different from modern society.&lt;ref name=EBO-social/&gt; The ancestors of modern humans lived in smaller groups, had more cohesive cultures, and had more stable and rich contexts for identity and meaning.&lt;ref name=EBO-social&gt;"social behaviour, animal." Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica, 2011. Web. 23 January 2011. [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/550897/animal-social-behaviour].&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers look to existing hunter-gatherer societies for clues as to how hunter-gatherers lived in the environment of evolutionary adaptedness.&lt;ref name=moralanimal/&gt; Unfortunately, the few surviving hunter-gatherer societies are different from each other, and they have been pushed out of the best land and into harsh environments, so it is not clear how closely they reflect ancestral culture.&lt;ref name=moralanimal/&gt;

Evolutionary psychologists sometimes look to chimpanzees, bonobos, and other great apes for insight into human ancestral behavior.&lt;ref name=moralanimal&gt;Wright 1995&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christopher Ryan (author)|Christopher Ryan]] and Cacilda Jethá argue that evolutionary psychologists have overemphasized the similarity of humans and chimps, which are more violent, while underestimating the similarity of humans and bonobos, which are more peaceful.{{sfn|Ryan|Jethá|2010}}

===Mismatches===

Since an organism's adaptations were suited to its ancestral environment, a new and different environment can create a mismatch. Because humans are mostly adapted to [[Pleistocene]] environments, psychological mechanisms sometimes exhibit "mismatches" to the modern environment. One example is the fact that although about 10,000 people are killed with guns in the US annually,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr54/nvsr54_10.pdf CDC pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; whereas spiders and snakes kill only a handful, people nonetheless learn to fear spiders and snakes about as easily as they do a pointed gun, and more easily than an unpointed gun, rabbits or flowers.&lt;ref name=Ohman2001&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ohman |first1=A. |last2=Mineka |first2=S. |year=2001 |title=Fears, phobias, and preparedness: Toward an evolved module of fear and fear learning |journal=Psychological Review |volume=108 |issue=3 |pages=483–522 |url=http://instruct.uwo.ca/psychology/371g/Ohman2001.pdf |accessdate=16 June 2008 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.108.3.483 |pmid=11488376}}&lt;/ref&gt; A potential explanation is that spiders and snakes were a threat to human ancestors throughout the Pleistocene, whereas guns (and rabbits and flowers) were not. There is thus a mismatch between humans' evolved fear-learning psychology and the modern environment.&lt;ref name=Pinker1999&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Pinker |first=Steve |title=How the Mind Works |pages=386–89 |year=1999 |publisher=WW Norton}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hagen2006&gt;{{cite journal

This mismatch also shows up in the phenomena of the [[supernormal stimulus]], a stimulus that elicits a response more strongly than the stimulus for which the response evolved. The term was coined by [[Niko Tinbergen]] to refer to non-human animal behavior, but psychologist [[Deirdre Barrett]] said that supernormal stimulation governs the behavior of humans as powerfully as that of other animals. She explained junk food as an exaggerated stimulus to cravings for salt, sugar, and fats,&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, Deirdre. Waistland: The R/Evolutionary Science Behind Our Weight and Fitness Crisis (2007). New York: W.W. Norton. pp. 31–51.&lt;/ref&gt; and she says that television is an exaggeration of social cues of laughter, smiling faces and attention-grabbing action.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, Deirdre.

Norton, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Magazine centerfolds and double cheeseburgers pull instincts intended for an environment of evolutionary adaptedness where breast development was a sign of health, youth and fertility in a prospective mate, and fat was a rare and vital nutrient.&lt;ref name=abcde&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Game theory and human evolution: A critique of some recent interpretations of experimental games

Naturally Selected: The Evolutionary Science of Leadership (2011). New York: Harper Business.&lt;/ref&gt; His argument is that humans are not adapted to work in large, anonymous bureaucratic structures with formal hierarchies. The human mind still responds to personalized, charismatic leadership primarily in the context of informal, egalitarian settings. Hence the dissatisfaction and alienation that many employees experience. Salaries, bonuses and other privileges exploit instincts for relative status, which attract particularly males to senior executive positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Van Vugt |first1=Mark |last2=Ronay |first2=Richard |year=2014 |title=The Evolutionary Psychology of Leadership |url=|journal=Organizational Psychology Review |volume=4 |issue=|pages=74–95 |doi=10.1177/2041386613493635}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research methods==
Evolutionary theory is [[heuristic]] in that it may generate hypotheses that might not be developed from other theoretical approaches. One of the major goals of adaptationist research is to identify which organismic traits are likely to be adaptations, and which are byproducts or random variations. As noted earlier, adaptations are expected to show evidence of complexity, functionality, and species universality, while byproducts or random variation will not. In addition, adaptations are expected to manifest as proximate mechanisms that interact with the environment in either a generally obligate or facultative fashion (see above). Evolutionary psychologists are also interested in identifying these proximate mechanisms (sometimes termed "mental mechanisms" or "psychological adaptations") and what type of information they take as input, how they process that information, and their outputs.&lt;ref name=Buss-D-M-2011/&gt; [[Evolutionary developmental psychology]], or "evo-devo," focuses on how adaptations may be activated at certain developmental times (e.g., losing baby teeth, adolescence, etc.) or how events during the development of an individual may alter life history trajectories.

Evolutionary psychologists use several strategies to develop and test hypotheses about whether a psychological trait is likely to be an evolved adaptation. Buss (2011)&lt;ref&gt;Buss, D.M. (2011). Evolutionary psychology. Chapter 2. Boston: Pearson/A and B.&lt;/ref&gt; notes that these methods include:

:''Cross-cultural Consistency.'' Characteristics that have been demonstrated to be cross cultural [[human universals]] such as smiling, crying, facial expressions are presumed to be evolved psychological adaptations. Several evolutionary psychologists have collected massive datasets from cultures around the world to assess cross-cultural universality.

:''Function to Form (or "problem to solution").'' The fact that males, but not females, risk potential misidentification of genetic offspring (referred to as "paternity insecurity") led evolutionary psychologists to hypothesize that, compared to females, male jealousy would be more focused on sexual, rather than emotional, infidelity.

:''Form to Function (reverse-engineering – or "solution to problem").'' [[Morning sickness]], and associated aversions to certain types of food, during pregnancy seemed to have the characteristics of an evolved adaptation (complexity and universality). [[Margie Profet]] hypothesized that the function was to avoid the ingestion of toxins during early pregnancy that could damage fetus (but which are otherwise likely to be harmless to healthy non-pregnant women).

:''Corresponding Neurological Modules.'' Evolutionary psychology and cognitive neuropsychology are mutually compatible – evolutionary psychology helps to identify psychological adaptations and their ultimate, evolutionary functions, while neuropsychology helps to identify the proximate manifestations of these adaptations.

:''Current evolutionary Adaptiveness.'' In addition to evolutionary models that suggest evolution occurs across large spans of time, recent research has demonstrated that some evolutionary shifts can be fast and dramatic. Consequently, some evolutionary psychologists have focused on the impact of psychological traits in the current environment. Such research can be used to inform estimates of the prevalence of traits over time. Such work has been informative in studying evolutionary psychopathology.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, N.C. (2016). Current Evolutionary Adaptiveness of Psychiatric Disorders: Fertility Rates, Parent-Child Relationship Quality, and Psychiatric Disorders. Journal of Abnormal Psychology&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolutionary psychologists also use various sources of data for testing, including experiments, [[archaeological record]]s, data from hunter-gatherer societies, observational studies, neuroscience data, self-reports and surveys, [[public record]]s, and human products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Main areas of research==
Foundational areas of research in evolutionary psychology can be divided into broad categories of adaptive problems that arise from the theory of evolution itself: survival, mating, parenting, family and kinship, interactions with non-kin, and cultural evolution.

===Survival and individual level psychological adaptations===
Problems of survival are clear targets for the evolution of physical and psychological adaptations. Major problems the ancestors of present-day humans faced included food selection and acquisition; territory selection and physical shelter; and avoiding predators and other environmental threats.&lt;ref name=Buss-D-M-2011b&gt;Buss, D.M. (2011). Evolutionary Psychology: The New Science of the Mind&lt;/ref&gt;

====Consciousness====
{{See also|Consciousness|Animal consciousness}}

Consciousness meets [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George Williams]]' criteria of species universality, complexity,&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite journal |jstor=188711 |pages=648–70 |last1=Nichols |first1=S. |last2=Grantham |first2=T. |title=Adaptive Complexity and Phenomenal Consciousness |volume=67 |issue=4 |journal=Philosophy of Science |year=2000 |doi=10.1086/392859 |url=http://dingo.sbs.arizona.edu/~snichols/Papers/evolcons(final).pdf |access-date=28 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813055023/http://dingo.sbs.arizona.edu/~snichols/Papers/evolcons(final).pdf |archive-date=13 August 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and functionality, and it is a [[Phenotypic trait|trait]] that apparently increases fitness.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman and Herron. ''Evolutionary Analysis.'' 2007. Pearson Education, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his paper "Evolution of consciousness," [[John Eccles (neurophysiologist)|John Eccles]] argues that special anatomical and physical adaptations of the mammalian [[cerebral cortex]] gave rise to consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=2360081 |pages=7320–24 |last1=Eccles |first1=J. C. |title=Evolution of consciousness |volume=89 |issue=16 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |year=1992 |pmid=1502142 |pmc=49701 |doi=10.1073/pnas.89.16.7320|bibcode=1992PNAS...89.7320E }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, others have argued that the recursive circuitry underwriting consciousness is much more primitive, having evolved initially in pre-mammalian species because it improves the capacity for interaction with both social ''and'' natural environments by providing an energy-saving "neutral" gear in an otherwise energy-expensive motor output machine.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, Frederic [http://precedings.nature.com/documents/2444/version/1 "Consciousness as Recursive, Spatiotemporal Self-Location"]&lt;/ref&gt; Once in place, this recursive circuitry may well have provided a basis for the subsequent development of many of the functions that consciousness facilitates in higher organisms, as outlined by Bernard J. Baars.&lt;ref&gt;Baars, Bernard J. ''A Cognitive Theory of Consciousness.'' 1993. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Dawkins suggested that humans evolved consciousness in order to make themselves the subjects of thought.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-5/&gt; Daniel Povinelli suggests that large, tree-climbing apes evolved consciousness to take into account one's own mass when moving safely among tree branches.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-5/&gt; Consistent with this hypothesis, Gordon Gallup found that chimps and orangutans, but not little monkeys or terrestrial gorillas, demonstrated self-awareness in mirror tests.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-5/&gt;

The concept of consciousness can refer to voluntary action, awareness, or wakefulness. However, even voluntary behavior involves unconscious mechanisms. Many cognitive processes take place in the cognitive unconscious, unavailable to conscious awareness. Some behaviors are conscious when learned but then become unconscious, seemingly automatic. Learning, especially implicitly learning a skill, can take place outside of consciousness. For example, plenty of people know how to turn right when they ride a bike, but very few can accurately explain how they actually do so. Evolutionary psychology approaches self-deception as an adaptation that can improve one's results in social exchanges.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-5/&gt;

Sleep may have evolved in humans to conserve energy when activity would be less fruitful or more dangerous, such as at night, and especially during the winter season.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-5&gt;Gaulin and McBurney 2003 p. 101–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sensation and perception====
{{See also|Sensation (psychology)|perception}}

Many experts, such as [[Jerry Fodor]], write that the purpose of perception is knowledge, but evolutionary psychologists hold that its primary purpose is to guide action.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-4/&gt; For example, they say, [[depth perception]] seems to have evolved not to help us know the distances to other objects but rather to help us move around in space.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-4/&gt; Evolutionary psychologists say that animals from fiddler crabs to humans use eyesight for collision avoidance, suggesting that vision is basically for directing action, not providing knowledge.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-4&gt;Gaulin and McBurney 2003 pp. 81–101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Building and maintaining sense organs is metabolically expensive, so these organs evolve only when they improve an organism's fitness.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-4/&gt; More than half the brain is devoted to processing sensory information, and the brain itself consumes roughly one-fourth of one's metabolic resources, so the senses must provide exceptional benefits to fitness.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-4/&gt; Perception accurately mirrors the world; animals get useful, accurate information through their senses.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-4/&gt;

Scientists who study perception and sensation have long understood the human senses as adaptations to their surrounding worlds.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-4/&gt; Depth perception consists of processing over half a dozen visual cues, each of which is based on a regularity of the physical world.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-4/&gt; Vision evolved to respond to the narrow range of electromagnetic energy that is plentiful and that does not pass through objects.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-4/&gt; Sound waves go around corners and interact with obstacles, creating a complex pattern that includes useful information about the sources of and distances to objects.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-4/&gt; Larger animals naturally make lower-pitched sounds as a consequence of their size.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-4/&gt; The range over which an animal hears, on the other hand, is determined by adaptation. Homing pigeons, for example, can hear very low-pitched sound (infrasound) that carries great distances, even though most smaller animals detect higher-pitched sounds.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-4/&gt; Taste and smell respond to chemicals in the environment that are thought to have been significant for fitness in the environment of evolutionary adaptedness.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-4/&gt; For example, salt and sugar were apparently both valuable to the human or pre-human inhabitants of the environment of evolutionary adaptedness, so present day humans have an intrinsic hunger for salty and sweet tastes.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-4/&gt; The sense of touch is actually many senses, including pressure, heat, cold, tickle, and pain.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-4/&gt; Pain, while unpleasant, is adaptive.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-4/&gt; An important adaptation for senses is range shifting, by which the organism becomes temporarily more or less sensitive to sensation.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-4/&gt; For example, one's eyes automatically adjust to dim or bright ambient light.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-4/&gt; Sensory abilities of different organisms often coevolve, as is the case with the hearing of echolocating bats and that of the moths that have evolved to respond to the sounds that the bats make.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-4/&gt;

Evolutionary psychologists contend that perception demonstrates the principle of modularity, with specialized mechanisms handling particular perception tasks.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-4/&gt; For example, people with damage to a particular part of the brain suffer from the specific defect of not being able to recognize faces (prosopagnosia).&lt;ref name=Gaulin-4/&gt; Evolutionary psychology suggests that this indicates a so-called face-reading module.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-4/&gt;

====Learning and facultative adaptations====
In evolutionary psychology, learning is said to be accomplished through evolved capacities, specifically facultative adaptations.&lt;ref name=LearningG8&gt;Gaulin and McBurney 2003 Chapter 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Facultative adaptations express themselves differently depending on input from the environment.&lt;ref name=LearningG8/&gt; Sometimes the input comes during development and helps shape that development.&lt;ref name=LearningG8/&gt; For example, migrating birds learn to orient themselves by the stars during a critical period in their maturation.&lt;ref name=LearningG8/&gt; Evolutionary psychologists believe that humans also learn language along an evolved program, also with critical periods.&lt;ref name=LearningG8/&gt; The input can also come during daily tasks, helping the organism cope with changing environmental conditions.&lt;ref name=LearningG8/&gt; For example, animals evolved Pavlovian conditioning in order to solve problems about causal relationships.&lt;ref name=LearningG8/&gt; Animals accomplish learning tasks most easily when those tasks resemble problems that they faced in their evolutionary past, such as a rat learning where to find food or water.&lt;ref name=LearningG8/&gt; Learning capacities sometimes demonstrate differences between the sexes.&lt;ref name=LearningG8/&gt; In many animal species, for example, males can solve spatial problem faster and more accurately than females, due to the effects of male hormones during development.&lt;ref name=LearningG8/&gt; The same might be true of humans.&lt;ref name=LearningG8/&gt;

====Emotion and motivation====
{{Main article|Evolution of emotion}}
Motivations direct and energize behavior, while emotions provide the affective component to motivation, positive or negative.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-6&gt;Gaulin and McBurney 2003 pp. 121–42.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1970s, [[Paul Ekman]] and colleagues began a line of research which suggests that many emotions are universal.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-6/&gt; He found evidence that humans share at least five basic emotions: fear, sadness, happiness, anger, and disgust.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-6/&gt; Social emotions evidently evolved to motivate social behaviors that were adaptive in the environment of evolutionary adaptedness.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-6/&gt; For example, spite seems to work against the individual but it can establish an individual's reputation as someone to be feared.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-6/&gt; Shame and pride can motivate behaviors that help one maintain one's standing in a community, and self-esteem is one's estimate of one's status.&lt;ref name=moralanimal/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gaulin-6/&gt;
Motivation has a neurobiological basis in the [[reward system]] of the brain. Recently, it has been suggested that reward systems may evolve in such a way that there may be an [[inherent]] or unavoidable [[trade-off]] in the motivational system for activities of short versus long duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Belke | first1 = T.

====Cognition====
Cognition refers to internal representations of the world and internal information processing. From an evolutionary psychology perspective, cognition is not "general purpose," but uses heuristics, or strategies, that generally increase the likelihood of solving problems that the ancestors of present-day humans routinely faced. For example, present day humans are far more likely to solve logic problems that involve detecting cheating (a common problem given humans' social nature) than the same logic problem put in purely abstract terms.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-7&gt;Gaulin and McBurney 2003 Chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the ancestors of present-day humans did not encounter truly random events, present day humans may be cognitively predisposed to incorrectly identify patterns in random sequences. "Gamblers' Fallacy" is one example of this. Gamblers may falsely believe that they have hit a "lucky streak" even when each outcome is actually random and independent of previous trials. Most people believe that if a fair coin has been flipped 9 times and Heads appears each time, that on the tenth flip, there is a greater than 50% chance of getting Tails.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-6/&gt; Humans find it far easier to make diagnoses or predictions using frequency data than when the same information is presented as probabilities or percentages, presumably because the ancestors of present-day humans lived in relatively small tribes (usually with fewer than 150 people) where frequency information was more readily available.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-6/&gt;

====Personality====
Evolutionary psychology is primarily interested in finding commonalities between people, or basic human psychological nature. From an evolutionary perspective, the fact that people have fundamental differences in personality traits initially presents something of a puzzle.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-9&gt;Gaulin and McBurney 2003 Chapter 9.&lt;/ref&gt; (Note: The field of behavioral genetics is concerned with statistically partitioning differences between people into genetic and environmental sources of variance. However, understanding the concept of [[heritability]] can be tricky – heritability refers only to the differences between people, never the degree to which the traits of an individual are due to environmental or genetic factors, since traits are always a complex interweaving of both.)

Personality traits are conceptualized by evolutionary psychologists as due to normal variation around an optimum, due to frequency-dependent selection (behavioral [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphisms]]), or as facultative adaptations. Like variability in height, some personality traits may simply reflect inter-individual variability around a general optimum.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-9/&gt; Or, personality traits may represent different genetically predisposed "behavioral morphs" – alternate behavioral strategies that depend on the frequency of competing behavioral strategies in the population. For example, if most of the population is generally trusting and gullible, the behavioral morph of being a "cheater" (or, in the extreme case, a sociopath) may be advantageous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0140525X00039595 |title=The sociobiology of sociopathy: An integrated evolutionary model |year=2010 |last1=Mealey |first1=Linda |journal=[[Behavioral and Brain Sciences]] |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=523–41}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, like many other psychological adaptations, personality traits may be facultative – sensitive to typical variations in the social environment, especially during early development. For example, later born children are more likely than first borns to be rebellious, less conscientious and more open to new experiences, which may be advantageous to them given their particular niche in family structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sulloway |first=F. |year=1996 |title=Born to rebel. |location=NY |publisher=Pantheon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that shared environmental influences do play a role in personality and are not always of less importance than genetic factors. However, shared environmental influences often decrease to near zero after adolescence but do not completely disappear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bouchard |first=T. J. |year=2004 |title=Genetic influence on human psychological traits. A survey. |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=13 |number=4 |pages=148–51 |accessdate=14 September 2014 |url=http://www.psy.miami.edu/faculty/dmessinger/c_c/rsrcs/rdgs/temperament/boucard.04.curdir.pdf |doi=10.1111/j.0963-7214.2004.00295.x }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Language====
{{See also|Evolutionary linguistics|Evolutionary psychology of language}}

According to [[Steven Pinker]], who builds on the work by [[Noam Chomsky]], the universal human ability to learn to talk between the ages of 1 – 4, basically without training, suggests that language acquisition is a distinctly human psychological adaptation (see, in particular, Pinker's ''[[The Language Instinct]]''). Pinker and [[Paul Bloom (psychologist)|Bloom]] (1990) argue that language as a mental faculty shares many likenesses with the complex organs of the body which suggests that, like these organs, language has evolved as an adaptation, since this is the only known mechanism by which such complex organs can develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pinker |first1=S. |last2=Bloom |first2=P. |year=1990 |title=Natural language and natural selection |journal=[[Behavioral and Brain Sciences]] |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=707–27 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X00081061 |citeseerx=10.1.1.116.4044 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pinker follows Chomsky in arguing that the fact that children can learn any human language with no explicit instruction suggests that language, including most of grammar, is basically innate and that it only needs to be activated by interaction. Chomsky himself does not believe language to have evolved as an adaptation, but suggests that it likely evolved as a byproduct of some other adaptation, a so-called [[Spandrel (biology)|spandrel]]. But Pinker and Bloom argue that the organic nature of language strongly suggests that it has an adaptational origin.&lt;ref&gt;Workman, Lance and Will Reader (2004) Evolutionary psychology: an introduction. Cambridge University Press p. 259&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolutionary psychologists hold that the [[FOXP2]] gene may well be associated with the evolution of human language.&lt;ref name=10WR&gt;Workman, Lance and Will Reader (2008). Evolutionary psychology: an introduction. 2nd Ed. Cambridge University Press. Chapter 10.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, psycholinguist Myrna Gropnik identified a dominant gene that causes language impairment in the [[KE family]] of Britain.&lt;ref name=10WR/&gt; This gene turned out to be a mutation of the FOXP2 gene.&lt;ref name=10WR/&gt; Humans have a unique allele of this gene, which has otherwise been closely conserved through most of mammalian evolutionary history.&lt;ref name=10WR/&gt; This unique allele seems to have first appeared between 100 and 200 thousand years ago, and it is now all but universal in humans.&lt;ref name=10WR/&gt; However, the once-popular idea that FOXP2 is a 'grammar gene' or that it triggered the emergence of language in ''Homo sapiens'' is now widely discredited.&lt;ref&gt;Diller, K. C. and R. L. Cann 2009. Evidence against a genetic-based revolution in language 50,000 years ago. In R. Botha and C. Knight (eds), ''The Cradle of Language.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 135–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently several competing theories about the evolutionary origin of language coexist, none of them having achieved a general consensus.&lt;ref name=W&amp;R-2008:277&gt;Workman &amp; Reader 2008:277 "There are a number of hypotheses suggesting that language evolved to fulfil a social function such as social grooming (to bind large groups together), the making of social contracts (to enable monogamy and male provisioning) and the use of language to impress potential mates. While each of these hypotheses has its merits, each is still highly speculative and requires more evidence from different areas of research (such as linguistics and anthropology)."&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers of language acquisition in primates and humans such as [[Michael Tomasello]] and [[Talmy Givón]], argue that the innatist framework has understated the role of imitation in learning and that it is not at all necessary to posit the existence of an innate grammar module to explain human language acquisition. Tomasello argues that studies of how children and primates actually acquire communicative skills suggests that humans learn complex behavior through experience, so that instead of a module specifically dedicated to language acquisition, language is acquired by the same cognitive mechanisms that are used to acquire all other kinds of socially transmitted behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Workman, Lance and Will Reader (2004) Evolutionary psychology: an introduction. Cambridge University Press p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;

On the issue of whether language is best seen as having evolved as an adaptation or as a spandrel, evolutionary biologist [[W. Tecumseh Fitch]], following [[Stephen J. Gould]], argues that it is unwarranted to assume that every aspect of language is an adaptation, or that language as a whole is an adaptation. He criticizes some strands of evolutionary psychology for suggesting a pan-adaptionist view of evolution, and dismisses Pinker and Bloom's question of whether "Language has evolved as an adaptation" as being misleading. He argues instead that from a biological viewpoint the evolutionary origins of language is best conceptualized as being the probable result of a convergence of many separate adaptations into a complex system.&lt;ref&gt;W. Tecumseh Fitch (2010) The Evolution of Language. Cambridge University Press pp. 65–66&lt;/ref&gt; A similar argument is made by [[Terrence Deacon]] who in ''[[The Symbolic Species]]'' argues that the different features of language have co-evolved with the evolution of the mind and that the ability to use symbolic communication is integrated in all other cognitive processes.&lt;ref&gt;Deacon, Terrence W. (1997) The Symbolic Species: The Co-evolution of Language and the Brain. W.W. Norton &amp; Co&lt;/ref&gt;

If the theory that language could have evolved as a single adaptation is accepted, the question becomes which of its many functions has been the basis of adaptation. Several evolutionary hypotheses have been posited: that language evolved for the purpose of social grooming, that it evolved as a way to show mating potential or that it evolved to form social contracts. Evolutionary psychologists recognize that these theories are all speculative and that much more evidence is required to understand how language might have been selectively adapted.&lt;ref&gt;Workman, Lance and Will Reader (2004) Evolutionary psychology: an introduction. Cambridge University Press p. 277&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mating===
{{main article|Sex differences in psychology}}

Given that sexual reproduction is the means by which genes are propagated into future generations, sexual selection plays a large role in human evolution. Human [[mating]], then, is of interest to evolutionary psychologists who aim to investigate evolved mechanisms to attract and secure mates.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, G.D. Love and Instinct. London: Temple Smith, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; Several lines of research have stemmed from this interest, such as studies of mate selection&lt;ref&gt;Buss 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buss &amp; Barnes 1986&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Li |first1=N.

In 1972 [[Robert Trivers]] published an influential paper&lt;ref&gt;Trivers, R. (1972). Parental investment and sexual selection. In B. Campbell (Ed.), ''Sexual Selection and the Descent of Man''. Chicago: Aldine-Atherton.&lt;/ref&gt; on sex differences that is now referred to as [[Parental investment|parental investment theory]]. The size differences of [[gametes]] ([[anisogamy]]) is the fundamental, defining difference between males (small gametes – sperm) and females (large gametes – ova). Trivers noted that anisogamy typically results in different levels of parental investment between the sexes, with females initially investing more. Trivers proposed that this difference in parental investment leads to the [[sexual selection]] of different [[Human mating strategies|reproductive strategies]] between the sexes and to [[sexual conflict]]. For example, he suggested that the sex that invests less in offspring will generally compete for access to the higher-investing sex to increase their [[inclusive fitness]] (also see [[Bateman's principle]]&lt;ref name="doi10.1038/hdy.1948.21"&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = A. J.| title = Intra-sexual selection in Drosophila| journal = Heredity| last1 = Bateman| volume = 2| issue = Pt. 3| pages = 349–821| year = 1948 | doi = 10.1038/hdy.1948.21| pmid=18103134}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Trivers posited that differential parental investment led to the evolution of sexual dimorphisms in [[mate choice]], intra- and inter- sexual reproductive competition, and [[courtship display]]s. In mammals, including humans, females make a much larger parental investment than males (i.e. [[gestation]] followed by childbirth and [[lactation]]). Parental investment theory is a branch of [[life history theory]].

[[David Buss|Buss]] and [[David P. Schmitt|Schmitt]]'s (1993) ''Sexual Strategies Theory''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buss | first1 = D. M. | last2 = Schmitt | first2 = D. P. | year = 1993 | title = Sexual strategies theory: an evolutionary perspective on human mating | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 100 | issue = 2| page = 204 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.100.2.204}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that, due to differential parental investment, humans have evolved sexually dimorphic adaptations related to "sexual accessibility, fertility assessment, commitment seeking and avoidance, immediate and enduring resource procurement, paternity certainty, assessment of mate value, and parental investment." Their ''Strategic Interference Theory''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Buss |first1=D. M. |year=1989 |title=Conflict between the sexes: strategic interference and the evocation of anger and upset |url=|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=56 |issue=5| pages=735–47 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.56.5.735}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that conflict between the sexes occurs when the preferred reproductive strategies of one sex interfere with those of the other sex, resulting in the activation of emotional responses such as anger or jealousy.

Women are generally more selective when choosing mates, especially under long term mating conditions. However, under some circumstances, short term mating can provide benefits to women as well, such as fertility insurance, trading up to better genes, reducing risk of inbreeding, and insurance protection of her offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/sep/03/anthonybrowne.theobserver|title=Women are promiscuous, naturally|first1=Anthony|last1=Browne|first2=health|last2=editor|date=2 September 2000|publisher=|accessdate=10 August 2016|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to male paternity insecurity, sex differences have been found in the domains of [[sexual jealousy]].&lt;ref&gt;Buss 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buss et al. 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Females generally react more adversely to emotional infidelity and males will react more to sexual infidelity. This particular pattern is predicted because the costs involved in mating for each sex are distinct. Women, on average, should prefer a mate who can offer resources (e.g., financial, commitment), thus, a woman risks losing such resources with a mate who commits emotional infidelity. Men, on the other hand, are never certain of the genetic paternity of their children because they do not bear the offspring themselves ("paternity insecurity"). This suggests that for men sexual infidelity would generally be more aversive than emotional infidelity because investing resources in another man's offspring does not lead to propagation of their own genes.&lt;ref&gt;Kalat, J. W. (2013). Biological Psychology (11th ed.). Cengage Learning. {{ISBN|9781111831004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another interesting line of research is that which examines women's mate preferences across the [[ovulation|ovulatory cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Haselton |first1=M.

Known as the [[ovulatory shift hypothesis]], the theory posits that, during the ovulatory phase of a woman's cycle (approximately days 10–15 of a woman's cycle),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wilcox |first1=A. J. |last2=Dunson |first2=D. B. |last3=Weinberg |first3=C. R. |last4=Trussell |first4=J. |last5=Baird |first5=D.

These putative preferences are predicted to be especially apparent for short-term mating domains because a potential male mate would only be offering genes to a potential offspring. This hypothesis allows researchers to examine whether women select mates who have characteristics that indicate high genetic quality during the high fertility phase of their ovulatory cycles. Indeed, studies have shown that women's preferences vary across the ovulatory cycle. In particular, Haselton and Miller (2006) showed that highly fertile women prefer creative but poor men as short-term mates. Creativity may be a proxy for good genes.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, G. F. (2000b) ''The mating mind: How sexual choice shaped the evolution of human nature''. Anchor Books: New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Research by Gangestad et al. (2004) indicates that highly fertile women prefer men who display social presence and intrasexual competition; these traits may act as cues that would help women predict which men may have, or would be able to acquire, resources.

===Parenting===
{{Main article|Evolutionary psychology of parenting}}

Reproduction is always costly for women, and can also be for men. Individuals are limited in the degree to which they can devote time and resources to producing and raising their young, and such expenditure may also be detrimental to their future condition, survival and further reproductive output.
Parental investment is any parental expenditure (time, energy etc.) that benefits one [[offspring]] at a cost to parents' ability to invest in other components of fitness (Clutton-Brock 1991: 9; Trivers 1972). Components of fitness (Beatty 1992) include the well-being of existing offspring, parents' future [[sexual reproduction|reproduction]], and inclusive fitness through aid to kin ([[W. D. Hamilton|Hamilton]], 1964). Parental investment theory is a branch of life history theory.

Robert Trivers' theory of parental investment predicts that the sex making the largest investment in [[lactation]], nurturing and protecting offspring will be more discriminating in mating and that the sex that invests less in offspring will compete for access to the higher investing sex (see [[Bateman's principle]]).&lt;ref name="doi10.1038/hdy.1948.21"/&gt; Sex differences in parental effort are important in determining the strength of sexual selection.

The benefits of parental investment to the offspring are large and are associated with the effects on condition, growth, survival and ultimately, on reproductive success of the offspring. However, these benefits can come at the cost of parent's ability to reproduce in the future e.g. through the increased risk of injury when defending offspring against predators, the loss of mating opportunities whilst rearing offspring and an increase in the time to the next reproduction. Overall, parents are [[Selection (biology)|selected]] to maximize the difference between the benefits and the costs, and parental care will likely evolve when the benefits exceed the costs.

The [[Cinderella effect]] is an alleged high incidence of stepchildren being physically, emotionally or sexually abused, neglected, murdered, or otherwise mistreated at the hands of their stepparents at significantly higher rates than their genetic counterparts. It takes its name from the fairy tale character Cinderella, who in the story was cruelly mistreated by her stepmother and stepsisters.&lt;ref&gt;Daly, Matin, and Margo I. Wilson. (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Daly and Wilson (1996) noted: "Evolutionary thinking led to the discovery of the most important risk factor for child homicide – the presence of a stepparent. Parental efforts and investments are valuable resources, and selection favors those parental psyches that allocate effort effectively to promote fitness. The adaptive problems that challenge parental decision making include both the accurate identification of one's offspring and the allocation of one's resources among them with sensitivity to their needs and abilities to convert parental investment into fitness increments…. Stepchildren were seldom or never so valuable to one's expected fitness as one's own offspring would be, and those parental psyches that were easily parasitized by just any appealing youngster must always have incurred a selective disadvantage"(Daly &amp; Wilson, 1996, pp.&amp;nbsp;64–65). However, they note that not all stepparents will "want" to abuse their partner's children, or that genetic parenthood is any insurance against abuse. They see step parental care as primarily "mating effort" towards the genetic parent.&lt;ref name=Daly_Wilson_98&gt;Daly &amp; Wilson 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family and kin===
{{see also|Human inclusive fitness|Kin selection}}
Inclusive fitness is the sum of an organism's classical fitness (how many of its own offspring it produces and supports) and the number of equivalents of its own offspring it can add to the population by supporting others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.personalityresearch.org/evolutionary/inclusive.html|title=Evolutionary Psychology – Inclusive Fitness|publisher=|accessdate=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first component is called classical fitness by Hamilton (1964).

From the gene's point of view, evolutionary success ultimately depends on leaving behind the maximum number of copies of itself in the population. Until 1964, it was generally believed that genes only achieved this by causing the individual to leave the maximum number of viable offspring. However, in 1964 W. D. Hamilton proved mathematically that, because close relatives of an organism share some identical genes, a gene can also increase its evolutionary success by promoting the reproduction and survival of these related or otherwise similar individuals. Hamilton concluded that this leads natural selection to favor organisms that would behave in ways that maximize their inclusive fitness. It is also true that natural selection favors behavior that maximizes personal fitness.

Hamilton's rule describes mathematically whether or not a gene for altruistic behavior will spread in a population:
:&lt;math&gt;rb &gt; c \ &lt;/math&gt;
where
* &lt;math&gt;c \ &lt;/math&gt; is the reproductive cost to the altruist,
* &lt;math&gt;b \ &lt;/math&gt; is the reproductive benefit to the recipient of the altruistic behavior, and
* &lt;math&gt;r \ &lt;/math&gt; is the probability, above the population average, of the individuals sharing an altruistic gene – commonly viewed as "degree of relatedness".

The concept serves to explain how natural selection can perpetuate altruism. If there is an "altruism gene" (or complex of genes) that influences an organism's behavior to be helpful and protective of relatives and their offspring, this behavior also increases the proportion of the altruism gene in the population, because relatives are likely to share genes with the altruist due to [[identical by descent|common descent]]. Altruists may also have some way to recognize altruistic behavior in unrelated individuals and be inclined to support them. As Dawkins points out in ''The Selfish Gene'' (Chapter 6) and ''The Extended Phenotype'',&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard, "The Extended Phenotype", Oxford University Press 1982 (Chapter 9)&lt;/ref&gt; this must be distinguished from the [[green-beard effect]].

Although it is generally true that humans tend to be more altruistic toward their kin than toward non-kin, the relevant proximate mechanisms that mediate this cooperation have been debated (see [[kin recognition]]), with some arguing that kin status is determined primarily via social and cultural factors (such as co-residence, maternal association of sibs, etc.),&lt;ref name=W2010&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2010.08.001 |title=Sixteen common misconceptions about the evolution of cooperation in humans |year=2011 |last1=West |first1=Stuart A. |last2=El Mouden |first2=Claire |last3=Gardner |first3=Andy |journal=Evolution and Human Behavior |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=231–62 |url=http://www.zoo.ox.ac.uk/group/west/pdf/WestElMoudenGardner_11.pdf |access-date=25 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812085608/http://www.zoo.ox.ac.uk/group/west/pdf/WestElMoudenGardner_11.pdf |archive-date=12 August 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; while others have argued that kin recognition can also be mediated by biological factors such as facial resemblance and immunogenetic similarity of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC).&lt;ref&gt;Villinger, J., and Waldman, B. (2012). Social discrimination by quantitative assessment of immunogenetic similarity. Published online before print 5 September 2012, {{DOI|10.1098/rspb.2012.1279}} Proc. R. Soc. B&lt;/ref&gt; For a discussion of the interaction of these social and biological kin recognition factors see Lieberman, Tooby, and Cosmides (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Lieberman, D., Tooby, J. &amp; Cosmides, L.

Whatever the proximate mechanisms of kin recognition there is substantial evidence that humans act generally more altruistically to close genetic kin compared to genetic non-kin.&lt;ref name=ReferenceA&gt;Buss, D.M. (2011). Evolutionary Psychology. Monterey: Brooks-Cole.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gaulin-2004&gt;Gaulin &amp; McBurney (2004), Evolutionary Psychology, 2nd Ed. NY: Prentice Hall&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Workman &amp; Reader (2008), Evolutionary Psychology, 2nd Ed. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interactions with non-kin / reciprocity===
Although interactions with non-kin are generally less altruistic compared to those with kin, cooperation can be maintained with non-kin via mutually beneficial reciprocity as was proposed by Robert Trivers.&lt;ref name=Trivers1971/&gt; If there are repeated encounters between the same two players in an evolutionary game in which each of them can choose either to "cooperate" or "defect," then a strategy of mutual cooperation may be favored even if it pays each player, in the short term, to defect when the other cooperates. Direct reciprocity can lead to the evolution of cooperation only if the probability, w, of another encounter between the same two individuals exceeds the cost-to-benefit ratio of the altruistic act:
: w &gt; c/b

Reciprocity can also be indirect if information about previous interactions is shared. Reputation allows evolution of cooperation by indirect reciprocity. Natural selection favors strategies that base the decision to help on the reputation of the recipient: studies show that people who are more helpful are more likely to receive help. The calculations of indirect reciprocity are complicated and only a tiny fraction of this universe has been uncovered, but again a simple rule has emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9634232 |year=1998 |last1=Nowak |first1=MA |last2=Sigmund |first2=K |title=Evolution of indirect reciprocity by image scoring |volume=393 |issue=6685 |pages=573–77 |doi=10.1038/31225 |journal=Nature |authorlink1=Martin Nowak |authorlink2=Karl Sigmund |bibcode=1998Natur.393..573N }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indirect reciprocity can only promote cooperation if the probability, q, of knowing someone’s reputation exceeds the cost-to-benefit ratio of the altruistic act:
: q &gt; c/b

One important problem with this explanation is that individuals may be able to evolve the capacity to obscure their reputation, reducing the probability, q, that it will be known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature04201 |title=Human cooperation: Second-order free-riding problem solved? |last1=Fowler |first1=James H. |journal=Nature |volume=437 |issue=7058 |pages=E8; discussion E8–9 |authorlink1=James H. Fowler|date=22 September 2005 |pmid=16177738|bibcode=2005Natur.437E...8F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trivers argues that friendship and various social emotions evolved in order to manage reciprocity.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-Steven-J-C-2003-pp.323-52&gt;Gaulin, Steven J. C. and Donald H. McBurney. Evolutionary Psychology. Prentice Hall. 2003. {{ISBN|978-0-13-111529-3}}, Chapter 14, pp. 323–52.&lt;/ref&gt; Liking and disliking, he says, evolved to help present day humans' ancestors form coalitions with others who reciprocated and to exclude those who did not reciprocate.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-Steven-J-C-2003-pp.323-52/&gt; Moral indignation may have evolved to prevent one's altruism from being exploited by cheaters, and gratitude may have motivated present day humans' ancestors to reciprocate appropriately after benefiting from others' altruism.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-Steven-J-C-2003-pp.323-52/&gt; Likewise, present day humans feel guilty when they fail to reciprocate.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-Steven-J-C-2003-pp.323-52/&gt; These social motivations match what evolutionary psychologists expect to see in adaptations that evolved to maximize the benefits and minimize the drawbacks of reciprocity.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-Steven-J-C-2003-pp.323-52/&gt;

Evolutionary psychologists say that humans have psychological adaptations that evolved specifically to help us identify nonreciprocators, commonly referred to as "cheaters."&lt;ref name=Gaulin-Steven-J-C-2003-pp.323-52/&gt; In 1993, Robert Frank and his associates found that participants in a prisoner's dilemma scenario were often able to predict whether their partners would "cheat," based on a half-hour of unstructured social interaction.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-Steven-J-C-2003-pp.323-52/&gt; In a 1996 experiment, for example, [[Linda Mealey]] and her colleagues found that people were better at remembering the faces of people when those faces were associated with stories about those individuals cheating (such as embezzling money from a church).&lt;ref name=Gaulin-Steven-J-C-2003-pp.323-52/&gt;

===Strong reciprocity (or "tribal reciprocity")===
{{Main article|Strong reciprocity}}

Humans may have an evolved set of psychological adaptations that predispose them to be more cooperative than otherwise would be expected with members of their tribal [[ingroups and outgroups|in-group]], and, more nasty to members of tribal [[ingroups and outgroups|out groups]]. These adaptations may have been a consequence of tribal warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bowles | first1 = S | year = 2009 | title = Did Warfare among Ancestral Hunter-Gatherer Groups Affect the Evolution of Human Social Behaviors | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/324/5932/1293 | journal = Science | volume = 324 | issue = | pages = 1293–98 | doi=10.1126/science.1168112| bibcode = 2009Sci...324.1293B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans may also have predispositions for "[[Third-party punishment|altruistic punishment]]" – to punish in-group members who violate in-group rules, even when this altruistic behavior cannot be justified in terms of helping those you are related to ([[kin selection]]), cooperating with those who you will interact with again ([[Reciprocity (evolution)#Direct reciprocity|direct reciprocity]]), or cooperating to better your reputation with others ([[Reciprocity (evolution)#Indirect reciprocity|indirect reciprocity]]).&lt;ref name=gintis2000&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gintis | first1 = H. | title = Strong Reciprocity and Human Sociality | doi = 10.1006/jtbi.2000.2111 | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 206 | issue = 2 | pages = 169–79 | year = 2000 | pmid =  10966755| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=henrich2012&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Henrich | first1 = J. | last2 = Chudek | first2 = M. | doi = 10.1017/S0140525X11001397 | title = Understanding the research program | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 35 | pages = 29–30 | year = 2012 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolutionary psychology and culture==
{{Main article|Evolutionary psychology and culture|}}

Though evolutionary psychology has traditionally focused on individual-level behaviors, determined by species-typical psychological adaptations, considerable work has been done on how these adaptations shape and, ultimately govern, culture (Tooby and Cosmides, 1989).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tooby|first1=J.|last2=Cosmides|first2=L.|title=Evolutionary psychology and the generation of culture, part I. Theoretical considerations.|journal=Ethology and Sociobiology|date=1989|volume=10|pages=29–49|doi=10.1016/0162-3095(89)90012-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tooby and Cosmides (1989) argued that the mind consists of many domain-specific psychological adaptations, some of which may constrain what cultural material is learned or taught. As opposed to a domain-general cultural acquisition program, where an individual passively receives culturally-transmitted material from the group, Tooby and Cosmides (1989), among others, argue that: "the psyche evolved to generate adaptive rather than repetitive behavior, and hence critically analyzes the behavior of those surrounding it in highly structured and patterned ways, to be used as a rich (but by no means the only) source of information out of which to construct a 'private culture' or individually tailored adaptive system; in consequence, this system may or may not mirror the behavior of others in any given respect." (Tooby and Cosmides 1989).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

==In psychology sub-fields==

===Developmental psychology===
{{Main article|Evolutionary developmental psychology}}

According to [[Paul Baltes]], the benefits granted by evolutionary selection decrease with age. Natural selection has not eliminated many harmful conditions and nonadaptive characteristics that appear among older adults, such as [[Alzheimer disease]]. If it were a disease that killed 20-year-olds instead of 70-year-olds this may have been a disease that natural selection could have eliminated ages ago. Thus, unaided by evolutionary pressures against nonadaptive conditions, modern humans suffer the aches, pains, and infirmities of aging and as the benefits of evolutionary selection decrease with age, the need for modern technological mediums against non-adaptive conditions increases.&lt;ref&gt;Santrock, W. John (2005). A Topical Approach to Life-Span Development (3rd ed.). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill. p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social psychology===
As humans are a highly social species, there are many adaptive problems associated with navigating the social world (e.g., maintaining allies, managing status hierarchies, interacting with outgroup members, coordinating social activities, collective decision-making). Researchers in the emerging field of evolutionary social psychology have made many discoveries pertaining to topics traditionally studied by social psychologists, including person perception, social cognition, attitudes, altruism, emotions, [[group dynamics]], [[leadership]], motivation, prejudice, intergroup relations, and cross-cultural differences.&lt;ref&gt;Neuberg, S.

When endeavouring to solve a problem humans at an early age show determination while [[chimpanzee]]s have no comparable facial expression.

===Abnormal psychology===
Adaptationist hypotheses regarding the etiology of psychological disorders are often based on analogies between physiological and psychological dysfunctions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=[[Randolph M.

Prominent theorists and [[Evolutionary medicine#Evolutionary psychiatry / Clinical evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychiatrists]] include [[Michael T. McGuire]], [[Anthony Stevens (Jungian analyst)|Anthony Stevens]], and [[Randolph M. Nesse]].

Evolutionary psychologists have suggested that schizophrenia and bipolar disorder may reflect a side-effect of genes with fitness benefits, such as increased creativity.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-11&gt;Gaulin and McBurney 2003 pp. 239–56.&lt;/ref&gt; (Some individuals with bipolar disorder are especially creative during their manic phases and the close relatives of people with schizophrenia have been found to be more likely to have creative professions.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-11/&gt;) A 1994 report by the American Psychiatry Association found that people suffered from schizophrenia at roughly the same rate in Western and non-Western cultures, and in industrialized and pastoral societies, suggesting that schizophrenia is not a disease of civilization nor an arbitrary social invention.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-11/&gt; Sociopathy may represent an evolutionarily stable strategy, by which a small number of people who cheat on social contracts benefit in a society consisting mostly of non-sociopaths.&lt;ref name=Gaulin-Steven-J-C-2003-pp.1-24/&gt; Mild depression may be an adaptive response to withdraw from, and re-evaluate, situations that have led to disadvantageous outcomes (the "analytical rumination hypothesis")&lt;ref name=ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/&gt; (see [[Evolutionary approaches to depression]]).

Some of these speculations have yet to be developed into fully testable hypotheses, and a great deal of research is required to confirm their validity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = O'Connell | first1 = H | year = 2004 | title = Evolutionary theory in psychiatry and psychology | url = | journal = Irish Journal of Psychological Medicine | volume = 21 | issue = 1| pages = 37–37 | doi=10.1017/s0790966700008193}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rose |first1=S. |year=2001 |title=Revisiting evolutionary psychology and psychiatry |url=|journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry |volume=179 |pages=558–59 |doi=10.1192/bjp.179.6.558-b |issue=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antisocial and criminal behavior===
{{Main article|Biosocial criminology#Evolutionary psychology}}
Evolutionary psychology has been applied to explain [[criminal]] or otherwise immoral behavior as being adaptive or related to adaptive behaviors. Males are generally more aggressive than females, who are more selective of their partners because of the far greater effort they have to contribute to pregnancy and child-rearing. Males being more aggressive is hypothesized to stem from the more intense reproductive competition faced by them. Males of low status may be especially vulnerable to being childless. It may have been evolutionary advantageous to engage in highly risky and violently aggressive behavior to increase their status and therefore reproductive success. This may explain why males are generally involved in more crimes, and why low status and being unmarried is associated with criminality. Furthermore, competition over females is argued to have been particularly intensive in late adolescence and young adulthood, which is theorized to explain why crime rates are particularly high during this period.&lt;ref name=AEP&gt;Aurelio José Figueredo, Paul Robert Gladden, Zachary Hohman. The evolutionary psychology of criminal behaviour. In {{Cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = S. C. | editor1-last = Roberts | doi = 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199586073.001.0001 | editor1-first = S. Craig | title = Applied Evolutionary Psychology | year = 2011 | publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 9780199586073 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many conflicts that result in harm and death involve status, reputation, and seemingly trivial insults.&lt;ref name=AEP/&gt; [[Steven Pinker]] in his book ''[[The Blank Slate]]'' argues that in non-state societies without a police it was very important to have a credible [[deterrence theory|deterrence]] against aggression. Therefore, it was important to be perceived as having a credible reputation for retaliation, resulting in humans to develop instincts for [[revenge]] as well as for protecting reputation ("[[honor]]"). Pinker argues that the development of the state and the police have dramatically reduced the level of violence compared to the ancestral environment. Whenever the state breaks down, which can be very locally such as in poor areas of a city, humans again organize in groups for protection and aggression and concepts such as violent revenge and protecting honor again become extremely important.&lt;ref name=AEP/&gt;

Rape is theorized to be a reproductive strategy that facilitates the propagation of the rapist's progency. Such a strategy may be adopted by men who otherwise are unlikely to be appealing to women and therefore cannot form legitimate relationships, or by high status men on socially vulnerable women who are unlikely to retaliate to increase their reproductive success even further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hagen|first1=Edward H.|title=Evolutionary Psychology FAQ|url=http://www.anth.ucsb.edu/projects/human/evpsychfaq.html|website=www.anth.ucsb.edu|accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sociobiological theories of rape]] are highly controversial, as traditional theories typically do not consider rape to be a behavioral adaptation, and objections to this theory are made on ethical, religious, political, as well as scientific grounds.

===Psychology of religion===
{{Main article|Evolutionary psychology of religion}}
Adaptationist perspectives on [[religious belief]] suggest that, like all behavior, religious behaviors are a product of the human brain. As with all other organ functions, [[cognition]]'s functional structure has been argued to have a genetic foundation, and is therefore subject to the effects of natural selection and sexual selection. Like other organs and tissues, this functional structure should be universally shared amongst humans and should have solved important problems of survival and reproduction in ancestral environments. However, evolutionary psychologists remain divided on whether religious belief is more likely a consequence of evolved psychological adaptations,&lt;ref name=Sosis&gt;{{cite journal |year=2003 |title=Signaling, solidarity, and the sacred: the evolution of religious behavior |journal=Evolutionary Anthropology |issue=6 |pages=264–74 |last1=Sosis |first1=R. |first2=C. |last2=Alcorta |doi=10.1002/evan.10120 |volume=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a byproduct of other cognitive adaptations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=2006 |title=Whence collective rituals?

===Coalitional psychology===
Coalitional [[psychology]] is an approach to explain political behaviors between different [[coalitions]] and the [[conditionality]] of these behaviors in evolutionary psychological perspective. This approach assumes that since human beings appeared on the earth, they have evolved to live in groups instead of living as individuals to achieve benefits such as more mating opportunities and increased status.&lt;ref name="Lopez 2011 and all"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lopez | first1 = Anthony C. | last2 = McDermott | first2 = Rose | last3 = Bang Petersen | first3 = Michael | year = 2011| title = States in Mind: Evolution, Coalitional Psychology, and International Politics | url = | journal = International Security | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 61–66 | doi=10.1162/isec_a_00056}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human beings thus naturally think and act in a way that manages and negotiates [[group dynamics]].

Coalitional psychology posits five hypotheses on how these [[psychological adaptation]]s operate:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lopez | first1 = Anthony C. | last2 = McDermott | first2 = Rose | last3 = Bang Petersen | first3 = Michael | year = 2011| title = States in Mind: Evolution, Coalitional Psychology, and International Politics | url = | journal = International Security | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 66–82 | doi=10.1162/isec_a_00056}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Humans represent groups as a special category of individual, unstable and with a short shadow of the future
* [[Political entrepreneurs]] strategically manipulate the coalitional environment, often appealing to emotional devices such as "outrage" to inspire [[collective action]].
* [[Relative gains]] dominate relations with enemies, whereas [[absolute gains]] characterize relations with allies.

* Individuals with children, particularly women, will vary in adopting aggressive foreign policies than those without progeny.

==Reception and criticism==
{{Main article|Criticism of evolutionary psychology}}
Critics of evolutionary psychology accuse it of promoting genetic determinism, panadaptionism (the idea that all behaviors and anatomical features are adaptations), unfalsifiable hypotheses, distal or ultimate explanations of behavior when proximate explanations are superior, and malevolent political or moral ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Kurzban, Robert. [http://human-nature.com/nibbs/02/apd.html Alas poor evolutionary psychology]. The Human Nature Review 2002 Volume 2: 99–109 (14 March ). Retrieved 14 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethical implications===
Critics have argued that evolutionary psychology might be used to justify existing social hierarchies and [[reactionary]] policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rose |first1=Hilary |last2=Rose |first2=Steven |editor1-link=|others=|title=Alas, Poor Darwin: Arguments against Evolutionary Psychology |url=|edition=|year=2000 |publisher=Harmony Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-609-60513-4 |pages=1–13 |chapter=Introduction |chapterurl=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wilson2003&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wilson |first1=David Sloan |last2=Dietrich |first2=Eric |last3=Clark |first3=Anne B. |year=2003 |title=On the inappropriate use of the naturalistic fallacy in evolutionary psychology |journal=Biology and Philosophy |volume=18 |issue=5 |pages=669–81 |publisher= |doi=10.1023/A:1026380825208 |url=http://evolution.binghamton.edu/dswilson/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/DSW14.pdf |accessdate=23 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415084544/http://evolution.binghamton.edu/dswilson/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/DSW14.pdf |archive-date=15 April 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested by critics that evolutionary psychologists' theories and interpretations of empirical data rely heavily on [[Ideology|ideological]] assumptions about race and gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Caporael |first1=Linnda R. |last2=Brewer |first2=Marilynn B. |year=1991 |title=The Quest for Human Nature: Social and Scientific Issues in Evolutionary Psychology |journal=Journal of Social Issues |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=1–9 |publisher=|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1991.tb01819.x |url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to such criticism, evolutionary psychologists often caution against committing the [[naturalistic fallacy]] – the assumption that "what is natural" is necessarily a moral good.&lt;ref name=wilson2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pinker&gt;Pinker, S. (2003). The blank slate. NY: Penguin&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2013}}&lt;ref name=Levy/&gt; However, their caution against committing the naturalistic fallacy has been criticized as means to stifle legitimate ethical discussions.&lt;ref name=wilson2003/&gt;

===Contradictions in models===
Some criticisms of evolutionary psychology point at contradictions between different aspects of adaptive scenarios posited by evolutionary psychology. One example is the evolutionary psychology model of extended social groups selecting for modern human brains, a contradiction being that the synaptic function of modern human brains require high amounts of many specific [[nutrient#Essentiality|essential nutrients]] so that such a transition to higher requirements of the same essential nutrients being shared by all individuals in a population would decrease the possibility of forming large groups due to bottleneck foods with rare essential nutrients capping group sizes. It is mentioned that some insects have societies with different ranks for each individual and that monkeys remain socially functioning after removal of most of the brain as additional arguments against big brains promoting social networking. The model of males as both providers and protectors is criticized for the impossibility of being in two places at once, the male cannot both protect his family at home and be out hunting at the same time. In the case of the claim that a provider male could buy protection service for his family from other males by [[barter]]ing food that he had hunted, critics point at the fact that the most valuable food (the food that contained the rarest essential nutrients) would be different in different ecologies and as such vegetable in some geographical areas and animal in others, making it impossible for hunting styles relying on physical strength or risk taking to be universally of similar value in bartered food and instead making it inevitable that in some parts of Africa, food gathered with no need for major physical strength would be the most valuable to barter for protection. A contradiction between evolutionary psychology's claim of men needing to be more sexually visual than women for fast speed of assessing women's fertility than women needed to be able to assess the male's genes and its claim of male sexual jealousy guarding against infidelity is also pointed at, as it would be pointless for a male to be fast to assess female fertility if he needed to assess the risk of there being a jealous male mate and in that case his chances of defeating him before mating anyway (pointlessness of assessing one necessary condition faster than another necessary condition can possibly be assessed).&lt;ref&gt;WE Frankenhuis Environmental unpredictability, Encyclopedia of Evolutionary Psychological Science, 2016 - Springer&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglas T Kenrick, VIadas Griskevicius, Omar Mahmoud The rational animal: How evolution made us smarter than we think, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standard social science model===
{{Main article|Standard social science model}}
Evolutionary psychology has been entangled in the larger philosophical and social science controversies related to the debate on [[nature versus nurture]]. Evolutionary psychologists typically contrast evolutionary psychology with what they call the standard social science model (SSSM). They characterize the SSSM as the "[[blank slate]]", "[[Factual relativism|relativist]]", "[[Social constructionism|social constructionist]]", and "[[Cultural determinism|cultural determinist]]" perspective that they say dominated the [[social science]]s throughout the 20th century and assumed that the mind was shaped almost entirely by culture.&lt;ref name=Pinker/&gt;

Critics have argued that evolutionary psychologists created a [[False dilemma|false dichotomy]] between their own view and the [[caricature]] of the SSSM.&lt;ref name=Richardson&gt;{{cite book |last1=Richardson |first1=Robert C. |authorlink1=|authorlink2=|editor1-link=|others=|title=Evolutionary Psychology As Maladapted Psychology |url=https://books.google.com/?id=KeqiKNFa3YgC&amp;pg=PA176 |edition=|year=2007 |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-262-18260-7 |page=176 |chapter=|chapterurl=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wallace |first=Brendan |authorlink= |title=Getting Darwin Wrong: Why Evolutionary Psychology Won't Work |url=|accessdate= |year=2010 |publisher=Imprint Academic |location=Exeter |isbn=978-1-84540-207-5 |page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Solomon |first1=Sheldon |authorlink1=|authorlink2=|editor1-first=Mark |editor1-last=Schaller |editor2-first=Christian S |editor2-last=Crandall |title=The Psychological Foundations of Culture |url=|year=2004 |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |location=Mahwah, N.J. |isbn=978-0-8058-3839-8 |page=17 |chapter=Human Awareness of Mortality and the Evolution of Culture |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/?id=TW4cVuyEnFAC&amp;pg=PA17 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics regard the SSSM as a [[rhetorical device]] or a [[straw man]]&lt;ref name=Levy&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Levy |first1=Neil |year=2004 |title=Evolutionary Psychology, Human Universals, and the Standard Social Science Model |journal=[[Biology and Philosophy]] |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=459–72 |publisher=[[Kluwer Academic Publishers]] |doi=10.1023/B:BIPH.0000036111.64561.63 |citeseerx=10.1.1.90.9290 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Richardson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sampson |first1=Geoffrey |authorlink1=Geoffrey Sampson |authorlink2=|editor1-link=|others=|title=The "Language Instinct" Debate: Revised Edition |url=https://books.google.com/?id=N0zJNPuXTZMC&amp;pg=PA134 |edition=|year=2009 |publisher=Continuum |location=London |isbn=978-0-8264-7384-4 |pages=134–45 |chapter=|chapterurl=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and suggest that the scientists whom evolutionary psychologists associate with the SSSM did not believe that the mind was a blank state devoid of any natural predispositions.&lt;ref name=Levy/&gt;

===Reductionism and determinism===
Some critics view evolutionary psychology as a form of genetic [[Reductionism#Reductionism and science|reductionism]] and [[genetic determinism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Maiers |first1=Wolfgang |authorlink1=|authorlink2=|editor1-first=Niamh |editor1-last=Stephenson |editor1-link=|others=|title=Theoretical Psychology: Critical Contributions |url=|edition=|year=2003 |publisher=Captus University Publications |location=Concord, Ont. |isbn=978-1-55322-055-8 |pages=426–35 |chapter=The Bogus Claim of Evolutionary Psychology |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/?id=uA5VIXQmYQUC&amp;pg=PA426 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Plotkin-Henry-p.150&gt;Plotkin, Henry. 2004 Evolutionary thought in Psychology: A Brief History. Blackwell. p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; a common critique being that evolutionary psychology does not address the complexity of individual development and experience and fails to explain the influence of genes on behavior in individual cases.&lt;ref name=instinct/&gt; Evolutionary psychologists respond that they are working within a nature-nurture interactionist framework that acknowledges that many psychological adaptations are facultative (sensitive to environmental variations during individual development). The discipline is generally not focused on proximate analyses of behavior, but rather its focus is on the study of distal/ultimate causality (the evolution of psychological adaptations). The field of behavioral genetics is focused on the study of the proximate influence of genes on behavior.&lt;ref name=AmPs2010/&gt;

===Testability of hypotheses===
{{See also|Just-so story}}

A frequent critique of the discipline is that the hypotheses of evolutionary psychology are frequently arbitrary and difficult or impossible to adequately test, thus questioning its status as an actual scientific discipline, for example because many current traits probably evolved to serve different functions than they do now.&lt;ref name=Psychology/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ryle |first1=Anthony |year=2005 |title=The Relevance of Evolutionary Psychology for Psychotherapy |journal=British Journal of Psychotherapy |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=375–88 |publisher=|doi=10.1111/j.1752-0118.2005.tb00225.x |url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While evolutionary psychology hypotheses are difficult to test, evolutionary psychologists assert that it is not impossible.&lt;ref name=Buss-Haselton-2007-pp.26-7&gt;"Testing ideas about the evolutionary origins of psychological phenomena is indeed a challenging task, but not an impossible one" (Buss et al. 1998; Pinker, 1997b).&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the critique of the scientific base of evolutionary psychology includes a critique of the concept of the Environment of Evolutionary Adaptation. Some critics have argued that researchers know so little about the environment in which ''Homo sapiens'' evolved that explaining specific traits as an adaption to that environment becomes highly speculative.&lt;ref name=Plotkin-Henry-p.149&gt;Plotkin, Henry. 2004 Evolutionary thought in Psychology: A Brief History. Blackwell. p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary psychologists respond that they do know many things about this environment, including the facts that present day humans' ancestors were hunter-gatherers, that they generally lived in small tribes, etc.&lt;ref&gt;The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology (2005), David M. Buss, Chapter 1, pp. 5–67, Conceptual Foundations of Evolutionary Psychology, John Tooby and Leda Cosmides&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modularity of mind===
{{Main article|Modularity of mind}}
Evolutionary psychologists generally presume that, like the body, the mind is made up of many evolved modular adaptations,&lt;ref name=Kurzban-R-2011&gt;{{cite book |last=Kurzban |first=Robert |year=2011 |title=Why Everyone (Else) Is a Hypocrite: Evolution and the Modular Mind |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=NJ |isbn=9780691146744}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there is some disagreement within the discipline regarding the degree of general plasticity, or "generality," of some modules.&lt;ref name=AmPs2010&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Confer | first1 = J.

In contrast, some academics argue that it is unnecessary to posit the existence of highly domain specific modules, and, suggest that the neural anatomy of the brain supports a model based on more domain general faculties and processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Panksepp |first1=Jaak |last2=Panksepp |first2=Jules B. |year=2000 |title=The Seven Sins of Evolutionary Psychology|journal=Evolution and Cognition |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=108–31 |url=http://www.flyfishingdevon.co.uk/salmon/year3/psy364-intro-psychobiology/panksepp_seven_sins.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=15 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Buller |first1=David J. |authorlink1=|last2=Hardcastle |first2=Valerie Gray |authorlink2=|editor1-first=David J. |editor1-last=Buller |editor1-link=|others=|title=Adapting Minds: Evolutionary Psychology And The Persistent Quest For Human Nature |url=|year=2005 |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-262-02579-9 |pages=127–201 |chapter=Modularity |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/?id=dQ5MGDvn8eIC&amp;pg=PA127 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, empirical support for the domain-specific theory stems almost entirely from performance on variations of the [[Wason selection task]] which is extremely limited in scope as it only tests one subtype of deductive reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Davies |first1=Paul Sheldon |last2=Fetzer |first2=James H. |last3=Foster |first3=Thomas R. |year=1995 |title=Logical reasoning and domain specificity |journal=[[Biology and Philosophy]] |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=1–37 |publisher=|doi=10.1007/BF00851985 |url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=O'Brien |first1=David |authorlink1=|last2=Manfrinati |first2=Angela |authorlink2=|editor1-first=Mike |editor1-last=Oaksford |editor1-link=|editor2-last=Chater |editor2-first=Nick |title=Cognition and Conditionals: Probability and Logic in Human Thinking |url=|year=2010 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-923329-8 |pages=39–54 |chapter=The Mental Logic Theory of Conditional Propositions |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/?id=iQSDOqAvXIoC&amp;pg=PA47 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural rather than genetic development of cognitive tools===
[[Cecilia Heyes]] argues that the picture presented by some evolutionary psychology of the human mind as a collection of cognitive instincts - organs of thought shaped by genetic evolution over very long time periods&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cep.ucsb.edu/primer.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cognitionandculture.net"/&gt; - does not fit research results. She posits instead that humans have cognitive gadgets&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cognitive-Gadgets-Cecilia-Heyes/dp/0674980158&lt;/ref&gt; - 'special-purpose organs of thought' built in the course of development through social interaction. These are products of cultural rather than genetic evolution,&lt;ref&gt;https://philosophy.sas.ac.uk/events/chandaria-lecture-series&lt;/ref&gt; and may develop and change much more quickly and flexibly than cognitive instincts.

===Evolutionary psychology defense===
Evolutionary psychologists have addressed many of their critics (see, for example, books by Segerstråle (2000), ''Defenders of the Truth: The Battle for Science in the Sociobiology Debate and Beyond,''&lt;ref&gt;Segerstråle, Ullica Christina Olofsdotter (2000).

Among their rebuttals are that some criticisms are [[Straw man|straw men]], are based on an incorrect nature versus nurture dichotomy, are based on misunderstandings of the discipline, etc.&lt;ref name=AmPs2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Alcock-John-2001/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Segerstråle, Ullica Christina Olofsdotter (2000).

[[File:Fat_composition_in_foods.png|thumb|Composition of fats from various foods, as percentage of their total fat.]]

'''Fat''' is one of the three main [[macronutrients]], along with the other two: [[carbohydrate]] and [[protein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mckinley.illinois.edu/handouts/macronutrients.htm|title = Macronutrients: the Importance of Carbohydrate, Protein, and Fat|date = |accessdate = 20 September 2014|website = McKinley Health Center|publisher = [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fats molecules consist of primarily carbon and hydrogen atoms, thus they are all [[hydrocarbon]] molecules. Examples include [[cholesterol]], [[phospholipids]] and [[triglyceride]]s.

The terms "[[lipid]]", "[[oil]]" and "fat" are often confused. "Lipid" is the general term, though a lipid is not necessarily a [[triglyceride]]. "Oil" normally refers to a lipid with short or [[Unsaturated (hydrocarbon)|unsaturated]] fatty acid chains that is liquid at [[room temperature]], while "fat" (in the strict sense) may specifically refer to lipids that are solids at room temperature – however, "fat" (in the broad sense) may be used in food science as a synonym for lipid. Fats, like other lipids, are generally [[hydrophobic]], and are soluble in organic solvents and insoluble in water.

Fat is an important foodstuff for many forms of life, and fats serve both structural and metabolic functions.  They are a necessary part of the [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]] of most [[heterotroph]]s (including humans) and are the most energy dense, thus the most efficient form of energy storage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat/biomolecules/fat-and-protein-metabolism/v/introduction-to-energy-storage | title = Introduction to Energy Storage | publisher = [[Khan Academy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and do not bind water thus do not increase body mass as much as proteins, especially carbohydrates, both of which bind a lot more water. 

Some fatty acids that are set free by the digestion of fats are called essential because they cannot be synthesized in the body from simpler constituents. There are two [[essential fatty acids]] (EFAs) in human nutrition: [[Alpha-Linolenic acid|alpha-linolenic acid]] (an [[omega-3 fatty acid]]) and [[linoleic acid]] (an [[omega-6 fatty acid]]).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mozaffarian|first=Dariush|last2=Katan|first2=Martijn B.|last3=Ascherio|first3=Alberto|last4=Stampfer|first4=Meir J.|last5=Willett|first5=Walter C.|date=2006-04-13|title=Trans Fatty Acids and Cardiovascular Disease|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=354|issue=15|pages=1601–1613|doi=10.1056/NEJMra054035|issn=0028-4793|pmid=16611951}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="uk" /&gt; Other lipids needed by the body can be synthesized from these and other fats. Fats and other lipids are broken down in the body by enzymes called [[lipase]]s produced in the [[pancreas]].

Fats and oils are categorized according to the number and bonding of the carbon atoms in the aliphatic chain. Fats that are [[saturated fat]]s have no double bonds between the carbons in the chain. [[Unsaturated fat]]s have one or more double bonded carbons in the chain. The nomenclature is based on the non-acid (non-carbonyl) end of the chain. This end is called the omega end or the n-end. Thus [[Alpha-Linolenic acid|alpha-linolenic acid]] is called an [[omega-3 fatty acid]] because the 3rd carbon from that end is the first double bonded carbon in the chain counting from that end. Some oils and fats have multiple double bonds and are therefore called  [[polyunsaturated fats]]. Unsaturated fats can be further divided into [[cis fat]]s, which are the most common in nature, and [[trans fat]]s, which are rare in nature. Unsaturated fats can be altered by reaction with hydrogen effected by a catalyst. This action, called [[hydrogenation]], tends to break all the double bonds and makes a fully saturated fat. To make vegetable shortening, then, liquid ''cis''-unsaturated fats such as vegetable oils are hydrogenated to produce saturated fats, which have more desirable physical properties e.g., they melt at a desirable temperature (30–40&amp;nbsp;°C), and store well, whereas polyunsaturated oils go rancid when they react with oxygen in the air. However, [[trans fat]]s are generated during hydrogenation as contaminants created by an unwanted side reaction on the catalyst during partial hydrogenation.

Saturated fats can stack themselves in a closely packed arrangement, so they can solidify easily and are typically solid at room temperature.  For example, animal fats [[tallow]] and [[lard]] are high in saturated fatty acid content and are solids.  Olive and linseed oils on the other hand are unsaturated and liquid. Fats serve both as energy sources for the body, and as stores for energy in excess of what the body needs immediately. Each gram of fat when burned or metabolized releases about 9 [[Calorie|food calories]] (37 [[Joule|kJ]] = 8.8 [[Calorie|kcal]]).&lt;ref name="uk"&gt;United Kingdom [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1996/1499/contents/made The Food Labelling Regulations 1996] &amp;ndash; [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1996/1499/schedule/7/made Schedule 7: Nutrition labelling]&lt;/ref&gt; Fats are broken down in the healthy body to release their constituents, [[Glycerin|glycerol]] and [[fatty acid]]s.  Glycerol itself can be converted to [[glucose]] by the liver and so become a source of energy.

==Chemical structure==
{{main| Triglyceride}}[[File:Triglyceride Structural Formulae V.1.png|thumb|Example of a natural triglyceride with three different fatty acids. One fatty acid is saturated (&lt;span style="color:blue;"&gt;'''blue'''&lt;/span&gt; highlighted), another contains one [[double bond]] within the carbon chain (&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;'''green'''&lt;/span&gt; highlighted). The third  fatty acid (a polyunsaturated fatty acid, highlighted in &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;'''red'''&lt;/span&gt;) contains three [[double bond]]s within the carbon chain. All carbon-carbon double bonds shown are ''cis'' isomers. ]]
There are many different kinds of fats, but each is a variation on the same chemical structure.  All fats are derivatives of [[fatty acid]]s and [[glycerol]]. Most fats are [[glyceride]]s, particularly [[triglyceride]]s ([[ester|triesters]] of glycerol). One chain of fatty acid is bonded to each of the three -OH groups of the glycerol by the reaction of the carboxyl end of the fatty acid (-COOH) with the alcohol; I.e. three chains per molecule. Water is eliminated and the carbons are linked by an -O- bond through [[Condensation reaction|dehydration synthesis]]. This process is called [[esterification]] and fats are therefore [[ester]]s.  As a simple visual illustration, if the kinks and [[bond angle|angles]] of these chains were straightened out, the molecule would have the shape of a capital letter E.  The fatty acids would each be a horizontal line; the glycerol "backbone" would be the vertical line that joins the horizontal lines. Fats therefore have "ester" [[Chemical bond|bonds]].

The properties of any specific fat molecule depend on the particular fatty acids that constitute it.  Fatty acids form a family of compounds that are composed of increasing numbers of carbon atoms linked into a zig-zag chain (hydrogen atoms to the side). The more carbon atoms there are in any fatty acid, the longer its chain will be.  Long chains are more susceptible to intermolecular forces of attraction (in this case, [[van der Waals forces]]), and so the longer ones melt at a higher temperature ([[melting point]]).

Fatty acid chains may also differ by length, often categorized as short to very long.
* Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic tails of fewer than six carbons (i.e. butyric acid).
* Medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic tails of 6–12 carbons, which can form medium-chain triglycerides.
* Long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic tails of 13 to 21 carbons.
* Very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) are fatty acids with aliphatic tails of 22 or more carbons.
Any of these aliphatic fatty acid chains may be glycerated and the resultant fats may have tails of different lengths from very short [[triformin]] to very long, e.g., cerotic acid, or ''hexacosanoic acid'', a 26-carbon long-chain saturated fatty acid. Long chain fats are exemplified by tallow (lard) whose chains are 17 carbons long. Most fats found in food, whether vegetable or animal, are made up of medium to long-chain fatty acids, usually of equal or nearly equal length. Many cell types can use either glucose or fatty acids for this energy. In particular, heart and skeletal muscle prefer fatty acids. Despite long-standing assertions to the contrary, fatty acids can also be used as a source of fuel for brain cells.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

=== Importance for living organisms ===

Fats are also sources of [[essential fatty acid]]s, an important dietary requirement. They provide energy as noted above. [[Vitamin]]s [[Vitamin A|A]], [[Vitamin D|D]], [[Vitamin E|E]], and [[Vitamin K|K]] are fat-soluble, meaning they can only be digested, absorbed, and transported in conjunction with fats. Fats play a vital role in maintaining healthy [[skin]] and [[hair]], insulating body organs against shock, maintaining body temperature, and promoting healthy cell function. Fat also serves as a useful buffer against a host of diseases. When a particular substance, whether chemical or biotic, reaches unsafe levels in the bloodstream, the body can effectively dilute—or at least maintain equilibrium of—the offending substances by storing it in new fat tissue. This helps to protect vital organs, until such time as the offending substances can be metabolized or removed from the body by such means as [[excretion]], [[urination]], accidental or intentional [[bloodletting]], [[sebum]] excretion, and [[hair]] growth.

==Adipose tissue==
[[File:Fatmouse.jpg|right|thumb|The [[obesity|obese]] [[mouse]] on the left has large stores of adipose tissue. For comparison, a mouse with a normal amount of adipose tissue is shown on the right.]]
{{main|Adipose tissue}}
In animals, [[adipose tissue]], or fatty tissue is the body's means of storing metabolic energy over extended periods of time. [[Adipocyte]]s (fat cells) store fat derived from the diet and from liver [[metabolism]]. Under energy stress these cells may degrade their stored fat to supply fatty acids and also glycerol to the [[circulatory system|circulation]]. These metabolic activities are regulated by several hormones (e.g., [[insulin]], [[glucagon]] and [[epinephrine]]). Adipose tissue also secretes the hormone [[leptin]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/adipose|title=The human proteome in adipose - The Human Protein Atlas|website=www.proteinatlas.org|access-date=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The location of the tissue determines its metabolic profile: [[visceral fat]] is located within the abdominal wall (i.e., beneath the wall of abdominal muscle) whereas "[[subcutaneous fat]]" is located beneath the skin (and includes fat that is located in the abdominal area beneath the skin but ''above'' the abdominal muscle wall).  Visceral fat was recently discovered to be a significant producer of signaling chemicals (i.e., [[hormone]]s), among which several are involved in inflammatory tissue responses. One of these is [[resistin]] which has been linked to obesity, [[insulin resistance]], and Type 2 diabetes. This latter result is currently controversial, and there have been reputable studies supporting all sides on the issue.

==Fatty acids and human health==

Dietary consumption of fatty acids has effects on human health. Studies have found that replacing saturated fats with ''cis'' unsaturated fats in the diet reduces risk of cardiovascular disease. For example, a 2015 systematic review of randomized control trials by the [[Cochrane Library]] concluded: "Lifestyle advice to all those at risk of cardiovascular disease and to lower risk population groups should continue to include permanent reduction of dietary saturated fat and partial replacement by unsaturated fats."&lt;ref&gt;Hooper et al., [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011737/abstract;jsessionid=0DEB4D52F5ECDF485FAD400C5795A535.f02t04 "Reduction in saturated fat intake for cardiovascular disease"],''Cochrane Database Syst Rev''. 2015 Jun 10;'''(6)''':CD011737.&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous studies have also found that consumption of ''trans'' fats increases risk of cardiovascular disease.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="uk" /&gt;  The [[Harvard School of Public Health]] advises that replacing ''trans'' fats and saturated fats with ''cis'' monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats is beneficial for health.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/fats-and-cholesterol/ "Fats and Cholesterol"], ''Harvard School of Public Health''.

'''Female education in STEM''' includes child and adult [[female]] represented in the fields of [[science, technology, engineering, and mathematics]] (STEM ). In 2017, 33% of students in STEM fields were women.

The organization [[UNESCO]] has stated that this gender disparity is due to [[discrimination]], [[Bias|biases]], [[Norm (social)|social norms]] and expectations that influence the quality of [[education]] women receive and the subjects they study.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; UNESCO also believes that having more women in STEM fields is desirable because it would help bring about [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0025/002534/253479e.pdf|title=Cracking the code: Girls' and womens' education in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=978-92-3-100233-5|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender differences in [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] education participation are already visible in [[Early childhood education|early childhood care and education]] in science- and math-related play, and become more pronounced at higher levels of [[education]]. Girls appear to lose interest in STEM subjects with age, particularly between early and late adolescence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This decreased interest affects participation in advanced studies at the secondary level and in [[higher education]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Female students represent 35% of all students enrolled in STEM-related fields of study at this level globally &lt;!-- Needs clear source --&gt;. Differences are also observed by disciplines, with female enrollment lowest in engineering, manufacturing and construction, natural science, mathematics and statistics and ICT{{fix|text=what?}} fields. Significant regional and country differences in female representation in STEM studies can be observed, though, suggesting the presence of contextual factors affecting girls’ and women’s engagement in these fields. Women leave STEM disciplines in disproportionate numbers during their higher education studies, in their transition to the world of work and even in their career cycle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/priority-areas/gender-and-science/improving-%20measurement-of-gender-equality-in-stem/stem-and-gender-advancement-saga/|title=STEM and Gender Advancement (SAGA) {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=PISA 2015 Results (Volume I): Excellence and Equity in Education|last=|first=|publisher=OECD|year=2016|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/timss2015/international-results/advanced/|title=TIMSS ADVANCED 2015 INTERNATIONAL RESULTS REPORT – TIMSS 2015 INTERNATIONAL RESULTS REPORT|website=timssandpirls.bc.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://data.uis.unesco.org/|title=UIS Statistics|last=UIS|website=data.uis.unesco.org|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Engineering Indicators 2014|last=|first=|publisher=National Science Board|year=2014|isbn=|location=Arlington|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Learning achievement in STEM education ===
Data on gender differences in learning achievement present a complex picture, depending on what is measured (subject, knowledge acquisition against knowledge application), the level of education/age of students, and geographic location. Overall, women's participation has been increasing, but significant regional variations exist. For example, where data are available in [[Africa]], [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]], the gender gap is largely in favour of boys in mathematics achievement in secondary education. In contrast, in the Arab States, girls perform better than boys in both subjects in primary and secondary education. As with the data on participation, national and regional variations in data on learning achievement suggest the presence of contextual factors affecting girls’ and women’s engagement in these fields. Girls’ achievement seems to be stronger in science than mathematics and where girls do better than boys, the score differential is up to three times higher than where boys do better.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} girls tend to outperform boys in certain sub-topics such as [[biology]] and [[chemistry]] but do less well in [[physics]] and [[earth science]].

The gender gap has fallen significantly in science in secondary education among [[Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study|TIMSS trend countries]]: 14 out of 17 participating countries had no gender gap in science in 2015, compared to only one in 1995. However, the data is less well known outside of these 17 countries. The gender gap in boys' favour is slightly bigger in mathematics but improvements over time in girls’ favour are also observed in certain countries, despite the important regional variations. Gender differences are observed within mathematic sub-topics with girls outperforming boys in topics such as [[algebra]] and [[geometry]] but doing less well in "number". Girls’ performance is stronger in assessments that measure knowledge acquisition than those measuring knowledge application. Country coverage in terms of data availability is quite limited while data is collected at different frequency and against different variables in the existing studies. There are large gaps in our knowledge of the situation in low- and middle-income countries in [[sub-Saharan Africa]], Central [[Asia]], and South and West Asia, particularly at secondary level.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=International Trends in Mathematics and Science Achievement, Curriculum and Instruction|last=Mullis, I.

== Factors influencing girls' and women's participation and achievement in STEM education ==
[[File:Expectations of a ICT career, by gender (PISA 2015).svg|thumb|upright=2|According to [[Programme for International Student Assessment|PISA]] 2015 results 4.8% of boys and 0.4% of girls expect a ICT career&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Catherine André/VoxEurop/EDJNet |author2=Marzia Bona/OBC Transeuropa/EDJNet |title=The ICT sector is booming.

According to UNESCO, there are multiple and overlapping factors which influence girls' and women's participation, achievement and progression in STEM studies and careers, all of which interact in complex ways, including: 
* '''Individual level:''' biological factors that may influence individuals’ abilities, skills, and [[Behavior|behaviour]] such as brain structure and function, [[Hormone|hormones]], [[genetics]], and cognitive traits like spatial and linguistic skills. It also considers psychological factors, including self-efficacy, interest and motivation.
* '''Family and peer level:''' parental beliefs and expectations, parental [[education]] and socioeconomic status, and other household factors, as well as peer influences.
* '''School level:''' factors within the [[learning environment]], including teachers’ profile, experience, beliefs and expectations, [[Curriculum|curricula]], learning materials and resources, [[Teaching method|teaching strategies]] and student teacher interactions, assessment practices and the overall school environment.
* '''Societal level:''' social and cultural [[norm (social)|norm]]s related to [[gender equality]], and gender stereotypes in the media.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Individual level ===
{{see also|Sex differences in psychology|Sex differences in intelligence}}
The question of whether there are differences in cognitive ability between men and women has long been a topic of debate among researchers and scholars. Some studies have found no differences in the neural mechanism of learning based on sex.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spearman, J. and Watt, H.|first=|date=2013|title=Perception shapes experience: The influence of actual and perceived classroom environment dimensions on girls’  motivations for science|url=|journal=Learning Environment Research|volume=16|pages=217-238|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kolmos, A., Mejlgaard, N., Haase, S. and Holgaard, J.E.|first=|date=2013|title=Motivational factors, gender and engineering in education|url=|journal=European Journal of Engineering Education|volume=38|pages=340-358|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McDaniel, A.|first=|date=2015|title=The role of cultural contexts in explaining cross-national gender gaps in STEM Expectations|url=|journal=European Sociological Review|volume=32|pages=122-133|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Su, R., Rounds, J. and Armstrong, P.I.|first=|date=2009|title=Men and things, women and people: A meta-analysis of sex differences in interests|url=|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=135|pages=859|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loss of interest has been the major reason cited for girls opting out of STEM. However, some have stated that this choice is influenced heavily by the socialization process and stereotyped ideas about gender roles, including stereotypes about gender and STEM. Gender stereotypes that communicate the idea that STEM studies and careers are male domains can negatively affect girls’ interest, engagement and achievement in STEM and discourage them from pursuing STEM careers. Girls who assimilate such stereotypes have lower levels of self-efficacy and confidence in their ability than boys. Self-efficacy affects both STEM education outcomes and aspirations for STEM careers to a considerable extent. Some studies have shown that girls appear to lose interest in STEM subjects with age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Family and peer level ===
Parents, including their beliefs and expectations, play an important role in shaping girls’ attitudes towards, and interest in, STEM studies. Parents with traditional beliefs about gender roles and who treat girls and boys unequally can reinforce stereotypes about gender and ability in STEM. Parents can also have a strong influence on girls' STEM participation and learning achievement through the family values, environment, experiences and encouragement that they provide. Some research finds that parents’ expectations, particularly the mother’s expectations, have more influence on the [[higher education]] and career choices of girls than those of boys&lt;!-- Needs source if referring to "some research" --&gt;. Higher socio-economic status and parental educational qualifications are associated with higher scores in [[mathematics]] and science for both girls and boys. Girls’ science performance appears to be more strongly associated with mothers’ higher educational qualifications, and boys’ with their fathers’. Family members with STEM careers can also influence girls’ STEM engagement. The broader socio-cultural context of the family can also play a role. Factors such as ethnicity, the language used at home, immigrant status and family structure may also have an influence on girls’ participation and performance in STEM. Peers can also impact on girls’ motivation and feeling of belonging in STEM education. Influence of female peers is a significant predictor of girls’ interest and confidence in mathematics and science.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== School level ===
Qualified teachers with specialization in STEM can positively influence girls’ performance and engagement with STEM education and their interest in pursuing STEM careers. Female STEM teachers often have stronger benefits for girls, possibly by acting as role models and by helping to dispel stereotypes about sex-based STEM ability. Teachers’ beliefs, attitudes, behaviours and interactions with students, as well as [[Curriculum|Curricula]] and learning materials, can all play a role as well. Opportunities for real-life experiences with STEM, including hands-on practice, apprenticeships, career counselling and mentoring can expand girls’ understanding of STEM studies and professions and maintain interest. Assessment processes and tools that are gender-biased or include gender [[stereotype]]s may negatively affect girls’ performance in STEM. Girls’ learning outcomes in STEM can also be compromised by psychological factors such as mathematics or test anxiety.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

A 2018 study found that while girls perform better or equal to boys in two out of three countries, in nearly all countries more girls were qualified to college-level{{Clarify|reason=is university level STEM study meant? Native English speaker help needed.|date=March 2018}} study than had enrolled. Researchers found that female enrolment to STEM subjects was relatively lower in countries with a high degree of gender equality – a [[gender-equality paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797617741719|title=The Gender-Equality Paradox in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Education|last=G. Stoet, D. C. Geary|first=|date=14 February 2018|website=SAGE Publishing|access-date=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/02/180214150132.htm|title=Countries with greater gender equality have a lower percentage of female STEM graduates: Findings could help refine education efforts and policies geared toward girls and science, technology, engineering and mathematics|work=ScienceDaily|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Societal level ===
Cultural and [[Norm (social)|social norms]] influence girls’ perceptions about their abilities, role in society and career and life aspirations.The degree of gender equality in wider society influences girls’ participation and performance in STEM. In countries with greater gender equality, girls tend to have more positive attitudes and confidence about mathematics and the gender gap in achievement in the subject is smaller. Targeted measures to promote gender equality, such as gender mainstreaming legislation or policies such as quotas, financial incentives or other, can increase girls’ and women’s participation in STEM education and careers. Gender stereotypes portrayed in the media are internalized by children and [[Adult|adults]] and affect the way they see themselves and others. Media can perpetuate or challenge [[gender stereotypes]] about STEM abilities and careers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Forest History Society''' is an [[United States|American]] non-profit organization dedicated to the preservation of forest and conservation history.&lt;ref name=FHS&gt;"Forest History Society." Echo Project. Center for History and New Media, George Mason University. http://echo.gmu.edu/node/144&lt;/ref&gt; The society was established in 1946 and incorporated in 1955.&lt;ref name=FHS/&gt;

The Forest History Society headquarters in [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]], [[North Carolina]], include the Alvin J. Huss Archives and the [[Carl A. Weyerhaeuser]] Library, which combine to provide a comprehensive compilation of materials related to the topic of forest history. The archives house large collections from several national organizations and companies such as the [[Society of American Foresters]], the [[American Forest and Paper Association]], the [[American Forests|American Forestry Association]], the [[Tree farm#American Tree Farm System|American Tree Farm System]], and the [[Weyerhaeuser|Weyerhaeuser Company]] as well as many other smaller collections of national and international significance.&lt;ref&gt;"Changing Roles of the Forest History Society: New Approaches to Environmental History in North America." ''Methods and Approaches in Forest History''. Agnoletti, Mauro, et al., eds. Wallingford, England: CABI Publishing, 2000, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, the Forest History Society maintains a publication program, publishing the ''Environmental History'' journal, ''Forest History Today'' magazine, an Issues Series, and environmental and conservation-focused monographs; an education program, to build understanding and appreciation of human interaction with the natural world; and a liaison function between scholars, policymakers, and landowners. The Society also works to promote and reward academic scholarship in the fields of forest, conservation, and environmental history.

==History==
In 1946, a small group of historians and forest industry executives came together to form an organization dedicated to preserving the documentary forest heritage of North America. The "Forest Products History Foundation" was founded, and began as a program of the [[Minnesota Historical Society]].

Over the following decade, archival source materials were collected, an oral history interview program was created, and a scholarly quarterly journal began publication. In 1955, under second executive director Elwood Rondeau "Woody" Maunder, the Society incorporated as an independent nonprofit organization under the new name "Forest History Foundation." The name was changed to "Forest History Society" four years later in 1959.

The organization left Minnesota in 1964, moving first to the [[Yale University]] campus in 1964, and then to the [[University of California at Santa Cruz]] in 1969. In 1984 the Society was moved to its current home in Durham, North Carolina, establishing an affiliation with [[Duke University]] and the [[Nicholas School of the Environment and Earth Sciences|Nicholas School of the Environment]].

In 1996, a partnership was formed between the Forest History Society and the [[American Society for Environmental History]]. This relationship helped widen the scope of the Society's mission beyond the boundaries of forest and conservation history to include subjects related to the broader field of environmental history.

==Publications==
The Forest History Society publishes a magazine, ''Forest History Today'', and co-publishes the ''Environmental History'' journal with the [[American Society for Environmental History]]. A regular Issues Series is also published by the Society on environmental topics of contemporary interest such as fire, wetlands, and forests. Featured books representing important scholarship in the fields of forest, conservation, and environmental history are also published. The Society provides further financial, editorial, and research assistance to other authors publishing books in the subject area of environmental history.

In painting, formalism emphasizes [[composition (art)|compositional]] elements such as color, line, shape, texture, and other perceptual aspects rather than the historical and social context. At its extreme, formalism in art history posits that everything necessary to comprehending a work of art is contained within the work of art. The context for the work, including the reason for its creation, the historical background, and the life of the artist, that is, its conceptual aspect is considered to be of secondary importance.

==History==
The historical origin of the modern form of the question of aesthetic formalism is usually dated to [[Immanuel Kant]] and the writing of his third Critique where Kant states: "Every form of the objects of sense is either ''figure'' (''Gestalt'') or ''play'' (''Spiel''). In the latter case it is either play of figures or the mere play of sensations. The charm (''Reiz'') of colors... may be added, but the delineations (''Zeichnung'') in the... composition (''Komposition'')... constitute the proper object of the pure judgment of taste."&lt;ref&gt;Kant. ''Critique of Judgment''. Section 14.8.&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher Donald Crawford has summarized Kant's position stating: "Thus, for Kant, form consists of the spatial... organization of elements: figure, shape, or delineation... In the parts of the ''Critique of Judgment'' in which form is emphasized as the essential aspect of beauty, Kant is consistently a pure formalist."&lt;ref&gt;Donald Crawford, ''Kant's Aesthetic Theory'' (Madison: The University of Wisconsin Press, 1974), p.&amp;nbsp;100.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary definition==
The philosopher Nick Zangwill of Glasgow University has defined formalism in art as referring to those properties "that are determined solely by sensory or physical properties—so long as the physical properties in question are not relations to other things and other times."&lt;ref&gt;Nick Zangwill, ''The Metaphysics of Beauty'' (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2001), p.&amp;nbsp;56, {{ISBN|0801438209}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher and architect Branko Mitrovic has defined formalism in art and architecture as "the doctrine that states that the aesthetic qualities of works of visual art derive from the visual and spatial properties."&lt;ref&gt;Branko Mitrović, ''Philosophy for architects'' (New York: Princeton Architectural Press, [2011]), p.&amp;nbsp;51.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the observation that works of art can in general contain formal properties and nonformal properties, the philosopher Nick Zangwill has delineated three types of formalism as they are encountered at the turn of the 21st century. First, Zangwill identifies ''extreme formalists'' who think "that all works of art are purely formal works—where a work is purely formal if all its aesthetic properties are formal aesthetic properties," then he defines ''anti-formalist'' thinkers as those who "think that no works of art have formal aesthetic properties."&lt;ref name="z84"&gt;Zangwill 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;84.&lt;/ref&gt; The third type which Zangwill identifies as representing the transition of the philosophy of aesthetics into the 21st century is that of ''moderate formalism'', where its principal exponents defend the principle "that all the aesthetic properties of works of art in a select class are formal, and second, that although many works of art outside that class have nonformal aesthetic properties, many of those works also have important formal aesthetic properties that must not be ignored."&lt;ref name="z84"/&gt;

The philosopher Michalle Gal has offered a moderate version of formalism, entitled "Deep Formalism", which is a symbolic formalism based on philosophical aestheticism. The artwork is defined by her as deep form: "a form steeped in content that cannot be extracted from it. Artistic content, since it has no existence or sense apart from the form, cannot actually be referred to, other than speculatively. The content seals the form in an opaque, non-reflective, productive symbol."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://doi.org/10.3726/978-3-0351-0787-6|title=Aestheticism: Deep Formalism and the Emergence of Modernist Aesthetics|last=Gal|first=Michalle|date=2015|publisher=Peter Lang AG|year=|isbn=9783035199925|location=|pages=14|language=en|doi=10.3726/978-3-0351-0787-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here she introduces a broad concept of symbol, an opaque-productive symbol: one that is not transparent to preconceived or pre-determined referents and meanings, but rather produces new ones.

==Uses in art history==
A formal analysis is an academic method in [[art history]] and criticism for [[analysis|analyzing]] works of [[art]]: "In order to perceive style, and understand it, art historians use 'formal analysis'. This means they describe things very carefully. These descriptions, which may include subjective vocabulary, are always accompanied by illustrations, so that there can be no doubt about what exists objectively".&lt;ref&gt;Review by: Clemency Chase Coggins of ''The Uses of Style in Archaeology'' edited by Margaret W. Conkey and Christine A. Hastorf, p.&amp;nbsp;233, ''Journal of Field Archaeology'', Vol. 19, No. 2 (Summer, 1992), pp.&amp;nbsp;232–34, Maney Publishing, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/529988 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6190">The '''Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Optics and Precision Engineering''' (IOF), also referred to as the Fraunhofer IOF, is an institute of the [[Fraunhofer Society|Fraunhofer Society for the Advancement of Applied Research]] (FHG). The institute is based in [[Jena]]. Its activities are attributed to applied [[research and development]] in the branch of [[natural sciences]] in the field of [[optics]] and [[precision engineering]]. The institute was founded in 1992.

== Research and Development ==

Building upon the experience of the Jena region in the field of surface and thin film technologies for optics, the Fraunhofer IOF conducts research and development in the area of optical systems aiming at enhancing the control of light – from its generation and manipulation to its actual use. The combination of competences in the areas of optics and precision engineering is particularly important.

The focuses also result in the department structure:

* Optical layers
* Optical systems, Optical measurement
* Microoptical systems
* Precision Engineering
* see also: [[thin film]] technology, [[surface physics]], [[microstructure]] technology, [[nanotechnology]], microoptics, measurement technology

== CMN-Optics ==

In July 2006, the Fraunhofer IOF opened the Center for Advanced Micro- and Nano-Optics (CMN-Optics). The core of the facility is the SB350-OS [[electron beam lithography]] system. This device, also known as an "electron beam recorder", allows minimal structure sizes in the range of 50 nm with a high accuracy on substrate sizes up to 300 mm. The center is operated jointly with the Institute for Applied Physics (IAP) of the [[Friedrich Schiller University of Jena]]. The facility is also used by the [[IPHT Jena|Institute for Photonic Technologies]] (IPHT), Jena. The facility cost twelve million euros and was financed by the European Union, the Free State of Thuringia and the Fraunhofer Society.

== Cooperations ==

In 2003, the Fraunhofer Society concluded a cooperation agreement with the Friedrich Schiller University of Jena. It is the basis for collaboration between Fraunhofer IOF staff and the staff of the Institute of Applied Physics at the University of Jena. The aim of the cooperation is to provide practical training for the students, to improve the implementation of research results into practice and to share the high-quality equipment and infrastructures of both institutions.

== Infrastructure ==

At the end of 2016, Fraunhofer IOF had 208 employees, most of whom are scientists and technicians.

The operating budget for the Fraunhofer IOF was EUR 22 million in the 2016 financial year. Basic funding covered 12 percent of the institute’s budget, of which 90 percent is financed by federal funds and 10 percent by state funds. Revenues from contract research in the industry brought in approximately 56 percent of the operating budget.

The Fraunhofer IOF has been headed by Andreas Tünnermann since 2003, who is also Director of the Institute of Applied Physics at the Friedrich Schiller University in Jena.&lt;ref name="http://www.iap.uni-jena.de/Institute/People/Director-p-246.html"&gt;[http://www.iap.uni-jena.de/Institute/People/Director-p-246.html Prof. Dr. rer. nat. habil. Andreas Tünnermann] - Official website of Institute of Applied Physics, Jena&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute has excellently equipped laboratories on an area of 2550 m². Included are 860 m² of clean room class 10000 to 10 as well as a mechanics workshop that meets the highest requirements.

In the years 2002 and 2013 expansion facilities were built on the [[Beutenberg Campus]] in Jena.

In 2017 a fiber technology center was inaugurated at Fraunhofer IOF, which includes new special laboratories for the production of active and passive mirco- and nanostructured optical fibers and one of the world's most powerful fiber drawing towers. &lt;ref name="https://www.iof.fraunhofer.de/en/press/pressrelease/2017/25years.html"&gt;[https://www.iof.fraunhofer.de/en/press/pressrelease/2017/25years.html 25th institute anniversary: Fraunhofer IOF opens new fiber technology center in Jena] Fraunhofer IOF (Press Release, July 5, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17010">The topic of gender and emotion is often reduced to attempts to identify the differences between women, men, and the various ways in which they express their emotions. Stereotypes are powerful, and men and women from various cultures have been shown to accept the Western stereotype that women are more emotional than men.&lt;ref name= kring&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kring | first1 = A. M. | last2 = Gordon | first2 = A. H. | year = 1998 | title = Sex differences in emotion: expression, experience, and physiology | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.74.3.686 | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 74 | issue = 3| pages = 686–703 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, women are believed to experience and express discrete emotions such as happiness, fear, disgust, and sadness more than men. 

Many researchers have concluded that the observed emotional differences between men and women primarily stem from socialized [[gender role]]s, rather than biology.  Thus, the range of [[emotional expression]] that certain populations experience is based, in large part, on their culture's expectations for [[femininity]] and [[masculinity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wester | first1 = S. | last2 = Vogel | first2 = D. | last3 = Pressly | first3 = P. | last4 = Heesacker | first4 = M. | year = 2002 | title = Sex Differences in Emotion: A Critical Review of the Literature and Implications for Counseling Psychology | url = | journal = The Counseling Psychologist | volume = 30 | issue = 4| pages = 630–652 | doi=10.1177/00100002030004008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major theories==
Many psychologists reject the notion that men actually experience emotions less frequently than do women.  Instead, researchers have suggested that men exhibit restrictive [[emotionality]]. Restrictive emotionality refers to a tendency to inhibit the expression of certain emotions and an unwillingness to self-disclose intimate feelings.&lt;ref name = jansz /&gt; Men's restrictive emotionality has been shown to influence health, emotional appraisal and overall identity.  Furthermore, tendencies toward restrictive emotionality are correlated with an increased risk of certain anxiety disorders.&lt;ref name = jansz /&gt;
A substantial amount of research has suggested that women do, on average, express emotions more frequently than men.&lt;ref name = kring /&gt; In the Handbook of Emotions, Leslie R. Brody and Judith A. Hall report that This difference in emotional expression starts at a young age, as early as 4 and 6 years old, as girls begin to express more sadness and anxiety than their male counterparts.&lt;ref name = brody /&gt;&lt;ref name = brody&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brody | first1 = L. R. | last2 = Hall | first2 = J. A. | year = 2008 | title = Gender and emotion in context | url = | journal = Handbook of emotions | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 395–408 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brody and Hall (2008) report that women generally smile, laugh, nod and use hand gestures more than men do.&lt;ref name = brody /&gt;  The only known exception to this rule is that men more frequently express anger.  However, all of these effects are not commonly observed until after preschool, suggesting that these differences might be the result of certain [[socialization]] processes.&lt;ref name = jansz&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jansz | first1 = J | year = 2000 | title = [[Masculine]] identity and restrictive emotionality | url = | journal = Gender and emotion: Social psychological perspectives | volume = | issue = | pages = 166–186 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Women are also more accurate expressers of emotion, when "posing deliberately and when observed unobstrusively."&lt;ref name = brody /&gt;  This increased expressiveness in emotional expression is consistent across cultures – women report more intense emotional experiences and more overt emotional expressions across 37 cultures.&lt;ref name =  fischer&gt;Fischer, A. H., &amp; Manstead, A. S. R. (2000). The relation between gender and emotion in different cultures. In A. H. Fischer (Ed.), Gender and emotion: Social psychological perspectives (pp. 71–98). New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
It has been found that men and women more accurately display gender-stereotypic expressions – men more accurately express anger, contempt and happiness, while women were more accurately express fear and happiness.&lt;ref name = brody /&gt;  Other studies have shown that women show higher levels of expression accuracy and judgement of nonverbal emotional cues than men overall.&lt;ref name = brody /&gt; However, these patterns are not consistent across cultures, again suggesting that socialization influences the observed gender differences in emotional expression.&lt;ref name = brody /&gt;  For example, in [[Japan]], research has suggested that women convey anger and contempt better than men do.&lt;ref name = brody /&gt;

==Major empirical findings==
Research has shown that culture and context-specific gender roles have a stronger influence on emotional expression than do biological factors.  "Empirical evidence suggests that girls are socialized to be emotional, nonaggressive, nurturing, and obedient, whereas boys are socialized to be unemotional, aggressive, achievement oriented, and self-reliant. Peers continue this process as children develop and mature in effect constraining how, where, why, and with whom certain emotions are expressed".&lt;ref name = wester/&gt;  One study suggests that people tend to exhibit more intense negative facial expressions in solitary conditions, and smile more when others are present.  In this experiment, men and women did not differ in their anger expression in non-social conditions. However, women were more likely to express their anger in the solitary condition as opposed to the social condition. Men, on the other hand, seemed to be less concerned with appearing positive to others; they showed no difference in their expression of anger based on whether or not others were present.&lt;ref name = derks/&gt;  In another recent study, Coats and Feldman found that women who were more accurate expressors of happiness were judged as more popular, while men who were more accurate expressors of anger were judged as more popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Coats | first1 = E. J. | last2 = Feldman | first2 = R. S. | year = 1996 | title = Gender differences in nonverbal correlates of social status | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 22 | issue = 10| pages = 1014–1022 | doi=10.1177/01461672962210004}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that there are negative consequences for people who are less accurate expressors of gender-stereotypical emotions.

These consequences also extend to judging others' emotions. Studies have shown that there are negative social consequences for children who are deficient at judging gender-stereotypic nonverbal cues – angry nonverbal cues for boys and happy, sad, and fearful nonverbal cues for girls.  Communication of emotion involves both detection and expression of emotions or moods. The ability to detect non-verbal cues leads to successful communication of emotions. In [[computer-mediated communication]] (CMC), the absence of body language and visibility restricts one's ability to correctly recognize other's [[emotion]]s.  For this reason, emoticons are widely used  in online communication to replace non-verbal behaviors that emphasize or clarify one's feelings.  Surprisingly, there is no static gender difference in the use of emoticons.  In some studies, both men and women display an increase in emoticon use in the context of a mixed-gender group chat.  Others show that men use more emoticons when interacting with women, while women show no change when interacting with men.&lt;ref name = derks&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Derks | first1 = Daantje | last2 = Fischer | first2 = Agneta H. | last3 = Bos | first3 = Arjan E.R. | year = 2008 | title = The role of emotion in computer-mediated communication: A review | url = | journal = Computers in Human Behavior | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 766–785 | doi =  10.1016/j.chb.2007.04.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature versus nurture==
{{Main article|Nature versus nurture}}
The social-developmental hypothesis is one of the major arguments for the impact of nurture on emotional expression.  The social-developmental theory explains gender differences in emotion expression through emphasizing "children's active role in their development of gendered behavior" through learning by watching adults or through interactions with their parents and peers (Chaplin &amp; Aldao, 2012).&lt;ref name= chaplin&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chaplin | first1 = T. | last2 = Aldao | first2 = A. | year = 2012 | title = Gender differences in emotion expression in children: A meta-analytic review | url = http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/features/bul-a0030737.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 139 | issue = 4| pages = 735–765 | doi=10.1037/a0030737 | pmid=23231534 | pmc=3597769}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis points to the fact that infants are not born with the same differences in emotional expression and gender differences generally grow more pronounced as children age.  In a 2012 meta-analysis conducted by Tara Chaplin and Amelia Aldao, researchers reviewed gender differences in emotion expression from the infancy period through adolescence in order to determine the impact of development and age on gender differences. Their findings support the notion that social factors in a child's development play a large role in the gender differences that later emerge, as "gender differences were not found in infancy…but they emerged by the toddler/preschool period and in childhood".&lt;ref name= chaplin /&gt; One possible explanation for this developmental difference comes from the child's parents.  In many Western cultures, for example, parents discuss and express a broader range of emotions with their daughters than their sons.&lt;ref name = wester&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wester | first1 = S. | last2 = Vogel | first2 = D. | last3 = Pressly | first3 = P. | last4 = Heesacker | first4 = M. | year = 2002 | title = Sex Differences in Emotion: A Critical Review of the Literature and Implications for Counseling Psychology | url = http://www.sagepub.com/counselingstudy/Journal%20Articles/Wester.pdf | format = PDF | journal = The Counseling Psychologist | volume = 30 | issue = 4| pages = 630–652 | doi=10.1177/00100002030004008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As children grow older, these patterns continue with their peers.

The second major argument in support of social influences on emotion expression involves the idea that a society's gender roles reinforce gender differences.  The social constructionist theory states that children grow up in the context of gender roles that naturally place them in role-specific situations, influencing their emotion expression in that context.  Gender stereotypes in [[heteronormative]] societies enforce expectations for women to suppress anger and contempt, but express other emotions using words and facial expressions.  Simultaneously, these same cultural norms discourage men from verbally expressing emotions, with the exception of anger or contempt (Wester, Pressly, &amp; Heesacker, 2002).&lt;ref name = wester/&gt; As an adaptive feature, regulation of expression of emotion involves the consideration the social demands of any given situation.  Studies have shown that "fewer gender differences in emotion expression may be found when children are with someone they trust and know well than when children are with an unfamiliar person" (Chaplin &amp; Aldao, 2012).&lt;ref name=chaplin /&gt; Generally, people are trained to behave in a "socially acceptable" way around strangers or acquaintances, suggesting that the social context of an environment can shape the levels of emotion expression.

Biological factors also play a role in influencing emotion expression.  One central biological argument is related to cognitive differences between genders. In a 2008 study using functional magnetic reasoning imaging (fMRI) to monitor brain activity in participants, researchers found that men and women differ in neural responses when experiencing negative emotions. "Compared with women, men showed lesser increases in prefrontal regions that are associated with reappraisal, greater decreases in the amygdala, which is associated with emotional responding, and lesser engagement of ventral striatal regions, which are associated with reward processing" (McRae, Ochsner, Mauss, Gabrieli, &amp; Gross, 2008).&lt;ref name="mcrae"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McRae|first1=K.|last2=Ochsner|first2=K. N.|last3=Mauss|first3=I. B.|last4=Gabrieli|first4=J. J.|last5=Gross|first5=J. J.|year=2008|title=Gender differences in emotion regulation: An fMRI study of cognitive reappraisal|url=|journal=Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations|volume=11|issue=2|pages=143–162|doi=10.1177/1368430207088035}}&lt;/ref&gt; The way that male and female brains respond to emotions likely impacts the expression of those emotions.

The biological roots of gender differences interact with the social environment in various ways.  Biological theorists propose that females and males have innate differences that exist at birth, but unfold with age and maturation in response to interactions with their specific environments (Chaplin &amp; Aldao, 2012).&lt;ref name = chaplin/&gt; An important argument for this viewpoint is that "gender differences in emotion expression are the result of a combination of biologically based temperamental predispositions and the socialization of boys and girls to adopt gender-related display rules for emotion expression".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brody | first1 = L | year = 1997 | title = Gender and Emotion: Beyond Stereotypes | url = | journal = Journal of Social Issues | volume = 53 | issue = 2| pages = 369–394 | doi = 10.1111/j.1540-4560.1997.tb02448.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that even infant males display higher levels of activity and arousal than do infant girls as well as a lower ability for language and behavior inhibitory controls, which are biologically-based characteristics.  This "nature" argument interacts with "nurture" in that "parents and other socialization agents may respond to boys in ways that dampen emotional expressiveness…as a way to down-regulate their high emotional arousal and activity levels".&lt;ref name = chaplin/&gt; On the other hand, girls are encouraged to utilize their higher vocabulary and communication skills to verbally express their emotions to parents and other adults, which would also highlight expression differences between genders.

== "Man-box" ==
References to a figurative "man-box", an idea often attributed to [[TED (conference)|TED]] speaker Tony Porter, attempts to describe the societal restrictions on a man's freedom of emotional expression. As Porter describes, this restriction is a primary reason for high rates of violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Porter|first=Tony|title=A call to men|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/tony_porter_a_call_to_men|language=en|accessdate=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through his organization, ''A Call to Men'', Porter and his team organize initiatives and create awareness about what it means to possess "healthy manhood".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.acalltomen.org/about-us/our-vision/|title=Mission/Vision|website=A Call To Men|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 'man-box' is an analogous attempt to shed light on some of the cultural and social barriers we impose on men such as emotional reservedness, lack of physical intimacy with other men, and expectations of aggressive and/or dominant behavior in social environments.

==Controversies==
Emotions are complex and involve different components, such as physiological arousal, expressive behaviors, and conscious experience. While the expressive component of emotion has been widely studied, it remains unclear whether or not men and women differ in other aspects of emotion.  Most researchers agree that women are more emotionally expressive, but not that they experience more emotions than men do.&lt;ref name = kring /&gt; Some studies have shown that women are more likely to produce inauthentic smiles than men do, while others have shown the opposite.  This debate is significant because emotion can be generated by adopting an action that is associated with a particular emotion, such as smiling and speaking softly.&lt;ref name = brody /&gt;

A possible explanation is that both men and women's emotional expressiveness is susceptible to social factors. Men and women may be reinforced by social and cultural standards to express emotions differently, but it is not necessarily true in terms of experiencing emotions. For instance, studies suggest that women often occupy roles that conform to feminine display rules, which require them to amplify their emotional response to impress others.&lt;ref name = derks /&gt;

'''Genetypes''' is a taxonomic concept proposed in 2010 to describe any [[genetic sequence|genetic sequences]] from [[type (biology)|type specimens]].&lt;ref name=Chakrabarty2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chakrabarty|first=Prosanta|title=Genetypes: a concept to help integrate molecular systematics and traditional taxonomy|journal=Zootaxa|year=2010|volume=2632|pages=67–68|url=http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/2010/f/zt02632p068.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Harrisonetal2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harrison|first=I.

F. |title=Correct nomenclature and recommendations for preserving and cataloguing voucher material and genetic sequences|journal=Journal of Fish Biology|date=May 2011|volume=78|issue=5|pages=1283–1290|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8649.2011.02979.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1095-8649.2011.02979.x/full}}&lt;/ref&gt; This nomenclature integrates [[molecular systematics]] and terms used in [[Taxonomy (biology)|biological taxonomy]]. This nomenclature is designed to label, or flag, genetic sequences that were sampled from type specimens. The nomenclature of genetypes proposes that genetic sequences from a [[holotype]] should be referred to as a “hologenetype” (from: '''holo'''type and '''genetype'''), sequences from a topotype will be a “topogenetype,” and so forth. In addition, the genetic marker(s) used should also be incorporated into the nomenclature (e.g., paragenetype ND2).

The genetypes nomenclatural system could be used to flag “gold standard” sequences that due to their direct link to type specimens will be more credible than standard sequences whose species identification may be problematic. Misidentifications plague many sequences on [[GenBank]]{{cn|date=December 2013}} and having some sequences that are linked to type specimens will help locate and manage misidentifications and to create positively identified "gold standard" sequences available for comparison. It is suggested that this nomenclature be used in publications and databases that display or discuss sequences from type specimens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JFB Instruction to Authors |url=http://www.wiley.com/bw/submit.asp?ref=0022-1112 |publisher=Journal of Fish Biology }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Harrisonetal2011/&gt;

'''Guizhou University''' ({{zh|c=贵州大学}};  [[Pinyin]]: Guìzhōu Dàxué), known as '''Guida''' (贵大 Guì Dà, English abbreviation '''GZU'''), is a provincial research university located in suburban [[Guiyang]], capital of [[Guizhou]], [[China]]. Founded in 1902, it is the flagship institution of higher learning in Guizhou province. With over 30,000 students, Guida is one of the largest universities in southwest China.

The university was selected to participate in [[Project 211]], a government initiative which provided significant funding to elevate the research standards and faculty hiring resources of rising universities across China. In 2017, the university was recognized by the [[Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China|Chinese Ministry of Education]] as a [[Double First Class University Plan|Double First Class University]], with Double First Class status in certain disciplines which the government seeks to elevate to "world-class" status.&lt;ref name="Chinese Department of Education"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.moe.gov.cn/srcsite/A22/moe_843/201709/t20170921_314942.html |title=教育部 财政部 国家发展改革委 关于公布世界一流大学和一流学科建设高校及建设 学科名单的通知 (Notice from the Ministry of Education and other national governmental departments announcing the list of double first class universities and disciplines)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The predecessor of the modern Guizhou University was known as the Guizhou Institute of Higher Learning (贵州大学堂), which was founded in 1902. The institute evolved into the Provincial Guizhou University (省立贵州大学), National Guizhou College of Agriculture and Engineering (国立贵州农工学院), and finally National Guizhou University (国立贵州大学).

In 1997, the Guizhou Agricultural College, Guizhou Institute of Arts, and Guizhou Agricultural Cadre-Training School were merged into NGU to form Guizhou University.

In 2004, the Guizhou University of Technology merged into Guizhou University to complete the current Guizhou University. In 2005, the University was invited as a member of [[Project 211]] by the Ministry of Education.

Guizhou University established a sister school relationship with the Presbyterian College in Clinton, South Carolina; the latter offers a Chinese language program for the fifteen American students every year.

== Disciplines==
The university consists of 39 colleges and offers programs of study in 11 academic divisions leading to associate, baccalaureate, master's, and doctoral degrees. These include:
*Agriculture
*Administration 
*Economics
*Education
*Engineering
*History
*Law
*Liberal arts
*Medicine 
*Philosophy
*Sciences

==International cooperation and Peace Corps involvement==
In 1989 Guizhou Agricultural College, then a separate university, began hosting VSO teachers in the Foreign Language Department. The following year, Guizhou University began hosting foreign teachers from the AISH programme in Australia and visiting teacher programmes in both New Zealand and the University of Alabama. Simultaneously, VSO teachers from the UK and the Netherlands were recruited to work in other Guiyang institutes of higher education including the school of fashion and the catering college, both experiencing booms concurrent with Guiyang's emergence from relative obscurity. These teachers taught in both the undergraduate and post-graduate programmes at each institution. 

In 2005, eight years after Gui Nong (Guizhou Agricultural College) was merged with Gui Da (Guizhou University), Guizhou University began hosting [[Peace Corps|United States Peace Corps]] Volunteers. The volunteers teach at both the undergraduate and graduate level in the School of Foreign Languages.

== Campus ==
Guizhou University has nine campuses situated in different locations around the city of Guiyang. The administrative center is located on the North Campus on the [[Huaxi River]], [[Huaxi District]] of Guiyang.

'''''Harry Stottlemeier's Discovery'''''&lt;ref&gt;Lipman, Matthew. ''Harry Stottlemeier's Discovery'' (NJ: IAPC, 1974).&lt;/ref&gt; is a philosophical novel for children by [[Matthew Lipman]]. The novel was Lipman's first, and inaugurated the educational movement known as [[Philosophy for Children]]. It was first published in 1971 and revised in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/harry-stottlemeiers-discovery/oclc/927158010/editions ''Harry Stottlemeier's Discovery''] at [[WorldCat]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The book deals with everyday situations which a group of children encounter. These situations then become the substance for mental engagement and thinking about thinking. Rather than looking for answers, the type of thinking encouraged is about prolonging questioning, and performing self-initiated testing on the events or objects under discussion. There is a focus on how to teach ourselves logic by examining the results of the self-initiated tests. The books deal with substantial democratic issues as well such as "should every child go to school?", "should every person salute the flag?"&lt;ref&gt;Katzner, Louis I.

{{Cosmology|comp/struct}}
The '''ΛCDM''' ('''Lambda cold dark matter''') or '''Lambda-CDM''' model is a [[parametrization]] of the [[Big Bang]] [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] model in which the universe contains a [[cosmological constant]], denoted by [[Lambda]] ([[Greek alphabet|Greek]] '''Λ'''), associated with [[dark energy]], and [[cold dark matter]] (abbreviated '''CDM'''). It is frequently referred to as the '''standard model''' of Big Bang cosmology because it is the simplest model that provides a reasonably good account of the following properties of the cosmos:
* the existence and structure of the [[cosmic microwave background]]
* the [[Observable universe#Large-scale structure|large-scale structure]] in the distribution of galaxies
* the [[abundance of the chemical elements|abundances]] of [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis|hydrogen (including deuterium), helium, and lithium]]
* the accelerating [[metric expansion of space|expansion of the universe]] observed in the light from distant galaxies and [[supernova]]e

The model assumes that [[general relativity]] is the correct theory of gravity on cosmological scales.
It emerged in the late 1990s as a '''concordance cosmology''', after a period of time when disparate observed properties of the universe appeared mutually inconsistent, and there was no consensus on the makeup of the energy density of the universe.

The ΛCDM model can be extended by adding [[cosmological inflation]], [[quintessence (physics)|quintessence]] and other elements that are current areas of speculation and research in cosmology.

Some alternative models challenge the assumptions of the ΛCDM model. Examples of these are [[modified Newtonian dynamics]], modified gravity, theories of large-scale variations in the matter density of the universe, and scale invariance of empty space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maeder|first=Andre|date=2017|title=An Alternative to the ΛCDM Model: The Case of Scale Invariance|url=http://stacks.iop.org/0004-637X/834/i=2/a=194|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|language=en|volume=834|issue=2|pages=194|doi=10.3847/1538-4357/834/2/194|issn=0004-637X|arxiv=1701.03964|bibcode=2017ApJ...834..194M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pavel Kroupa|P.

==Overview==
[[File:Lambda-Cold Dark Matter, Accelerated Expansion of the Universe, Big Bang-Inflation.jpg|thumb|upright=2.4|Lambda-CDM, accelerated expansion of the universe. The time-line in this schematic diagram extends from the Big Bang/inflation era 13.7 Byr ago to the present cosmological time.]]
Most modern cosmological models are based on the [[cosmological principle]], which states that our observational location in the universe is not unusual or special; on a large-enough scale, the universe looks the same in all directions ([[isotropy]]) and from every location ([[homogeneity (physics)|homogeneity]]).&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Liddle. ''An Introduction to Modern Cosmology (2nd ed.).'' London: Wiley, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The model includes an expansion of metric space that is well documented both as the [[red shift]] of prominent spectral absorption or emission lines in the light from distant galaxies and as the time dilation in the light decay of supernova luminosity curves. Both effects are attributed to a [[Doppler shift]] in electromagnetic radiation as it travels across expanding space. Although this expansion increases the distance between objects that are not under shared gravitational influence, it does not increase the size of the objects (e.g. galaxies) in space. It also allows for distant galaxies to recede from each other at speeds greater than the speed of light; local expansion is less than the speed of light, but expansion summed across great distances can collectively exceed the speed of light.

The letter &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; (lambda) represents the [[cosmological constant]], which is currently associated with a vacuum energy or [[dark energy]] in empty space that is used to explain the contemporary accelerating expansion of space against the attractive effects of gravity. A cosmological constant has negative pressure, &lt;math&gt; p = - \rho c^{2} &lt;/math&gt;, which contributes to the [[stress-energy tensor]] that, according to the general theory of relativity, causes accelerating expansion. The fraction of the total energy density of our (flat or almost flat) universe that is dark energy, &lt;math&gt;\Omega_{\Lambda}&lt;/math&gt;, is currently (2015) estimated to be 0.692 ± 0.012, or even 0.6911 ± 0.0062 based on [[Planck satellite]] data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/planck-upholds-standard-cosmology-0210201523/ Camille M. Carlisle, ''Planck Upholds Standard Cosmology'', Sky &amp; Telescope, February 10, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dark matter]] is postulated in order to account for gravitational effects observed in very large-scale structures (the "flat" [[rotation curve]]s of galaxies; the [[gravitational lens]]ing of light by galaxy clusters; and enhanced clustering of galaxies) that cannot be accounted for by the quantity of observed matter. [[Cold dark matter]] is ''non-[[baryon]]ic'', i.e. it consists of matter other than protons and neutrons (and electrons, by convention, although electrons are not baryons); ''cold'', i.e. its velocity is far less than the speed of light at the epoch of radiation-matter equality (thus neutrinos are excluded, being non-baryonic but not cold); ''dissipationless'', i.e. it cannot cool by radiating photons; and ''collisionless'', i.e. the dark matter particles interact with each other and other particles only through gravity and possibly the weak force. The dark matter component is currently (2013) estimated to constitute about 26.8% of the mass-energy density of the universe.

The remaining 4.9% (2013) comprises all ordinary matter observed as atoms, chemical elements, gas and plasma, the stuff of which visible planets, stars and galaxies are made. The great majority of ordinary matter in the universe is unseen, since visible stars and gas inside galaxies and clusters account for less than 10% of the ordinary matter contribution to the mass-energy density of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Also, the energy density includes a very small fraction (~ 0.01%) in cosmic microwave background radiation, and not more than 0.5% in [[relic neutrinos]]. Although very small today, these were much more important in the distant past, dominating the matter at redshift &gt; 3200.

The model includes a single originating event, the "Big Bang", which was not an explosion but the abrupt appearance of expanding [[space-time]] containing radiation at temperatures of around 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; K. This was immediately (within 10&lt;sup&gt;−29&lt;/sup&gt; seconds) followed by an exponential expansion of space by a scale multiplier of 10&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; or more, known as [[cosmic inflation]]. The early universe remained hot (above 10,000 K) for several hundred thousand years, a state that is detectable as a residual [[cosmic microwave background]], or CMB, a very low energy radiation emanating from all parts of the sky. The "Big Bang" scenario, with cosmic inflation and standard particle physics, is the only current cosmological model consistent with the observed continuing expansion of space, the observed distribution of [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis|lighter elements in the universe]] (hydrogen, helium, and lithium), and the spatial texture of minute irregularities ([[Anisotropy|anisotropies]]) in the CMB radiation. Cosmic inflation also addresses the "[[horizon problem]]" in the CMB; indeed, it seems likely that the universe is larger than the observable [[particle horizon]].

The model uses the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]], the [[Friedmann equations]] and the [[Equation of state (cosmology)|cosmological equations of state]] to describe the observable universe from right after the [[Timeline of the Big Bang#Inflationary epoch|inflationary epoch]] to present and future.

== Cosmic expansion history ==
The expansion of the universe is parametrized by a [[dimensionless]] [[scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]] &lt;math&gt;a = a(t)&lt;/math&gt; (with time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; counted from the birth of the universe), defined relative to the present day, so &lt;math&gt;a_0 = a(t_0) = 1 &lt;/math&gt;; the usual convention in cosmology is that subscript 0 denotes present-day values, so &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt; is the current age of the universe. The scale factor is related to the observed [[Redshift#Expansion of space|redshift]]&lt;ref name="Dodelson"/&gt; &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; of the light emitted at time &lt;math&gt;t_\mathrm{em}&lt;/math&gt; by

:&lt;math&gt;{1 \over a(t_\mathrm{em})} = 1 + z.&lt;/math&gt;
The expansion rate is described by the time-dependent [[Hubble parameter]], &lt;math&gt;H(t)&lt;/math&gt;, defined as
:&lt;math&gt;H(t) \equiv \frac{\dot a}{a},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\dot a&lt;/math&gt; is the time-derivative of the scale factor.  The first [[Friedmann equations|Friedmann equation]] gives the expansion rate in terms of the matter+radiation density {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;,}} the [[Curvature of the universe|curvature]] {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;,}} and the [[cosmological constant]] {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt;,}}&lt;ref name="Dodelson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dodelson|first1=Scott|title=Modern cosmology|date=2008|publisher=[[Academic Press]]|location=San Diego, CA [etc.]|isbn=978-0122191411|edition=4. [print.].}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H^2 = \left(\frac{\dot{a}}{a}\right)^2 = \frac{8 \pi G}{3} \rho - \frac{kc^2}{a^2} + \frac{\Lambda c^2}{3}, &lt;/math&gt;

where as usual {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;}} is the speed of light and {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;}} is the [[gravitational constant]]. 
A critical density &lt;math&gt;\rho_\mathrm{crit}&lt;/math&gt; is the present-day density, which gives zero curvature &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, assuming the cosmological constant &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; is zero, regardless of its actual value. Substituting these conditions to the Friedmann equation gives

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_\mathrm{crit} = \frac{3 H_0^2}{8 \pi G} = 1.878\;47(23) \times 10^{-26} \; h^2 \; \text{kg} \; \text{m}^{-3},&lt;/math&gt;{{refn|name=constants|{{cite web|url=http://pdg.lbl.gov/2015/reviews/rpp2014-rev-astrophysical-constants.pdf |title=The Review of Particle Physics. 2.

where &lt;math&gt; h \equiv H_0 / (100 \; \mathrm{km \; s^{-1} \; Mpc^{-1}}) &lt;/math&gt; is the reduced Hubble constant.
If the cosmological constant were actually zero, the critical density would also mark the dividing line between eventual recollapse of the universe to a [[Big Crunch]], or unlimited expansion. For the Lambda-CDM model with a positive cosmological constant (as observed), the universe is predicted to expand forever regardless of whether the total density is slightly above or below the critical density; though other outcomes are possible in extended models where the [[dark energy]] is not constant but actually time-dependent.

It is standard to define the present-day '''density parameter''' &lt;math&gt;\Omega_x&lt;/math&gt; for various species as the dimensionless ratio
:&lt;math&gt;\Omega_x \equiv \frac{\rho_x(t=t_0)}{\rho_\mathrm{crit} } = \frac{8 \pi G\rho_x(t=t_0)}{3 H_0^2}&lt;/math&gt;
where the subscript &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is one of &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; for [[Baryon|baryons]], &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; for [[cold dark matter]], &lt;math&gt;rad&lt;/math&gt; for [[radiation]] ([[Photon|photons]] plus relativistic [[Neutrino|neutrinos]]), and &lt;math&gt;DE&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; for [[dark energy]].

Since the densities of various species scale as different powers of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, e.g. &lt;math&gt;a^{-3}&lt;/math&gt; for matter etc.,
the [[Friedmann equation]] can be conveniently rewritten in terms of the various density parameters as
:&lt;math&gt;H(a) \equiv \frac{\dot{a}}{a} = H_0 \sqrt{ (\Omega_c + \Omega_b) a^{-3} + \Omega_\text{rad} a^{-4} + \Omega_k a^{-2} + \Omega_{DE} a^{-3(1+w)} } &lt;/math&gt;
where w is the [[Equation of state (cosmology)|equation of state]] of dark energy, and assuming negligible neutrino mass (significant neutrino mass requires a more complex equation). The various &lt;math&gt; \Omega &lt;/math&gt; parameters add up to &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; by construction.
In the general case this is integrated by computer to give
the expansion history &lt;math&gt;a(t)&lt;/math&gt; and also observable distance-redshift relations for any chosen values of the cosmological parameters, which can then be compared with observations such as [[supernovae]] and [[baryon acoustic oscillations]].

In the minimal 6-parameter Lambda-CDM model, it is assumed that curvature &lt;math&gt;\Omega_k&lt;/math&gt; is zero and &lt;math&gt; w = -1 &lt;/math&gt;, so this simplifies to
:&lt;math&gt; H(a) = H_0 \sqrt{ \Omega_m a^{-3} + \Omega_\text{rad} a^{-4} + \Omega_\Lambda } &lt;/math&gt;

Observations show that the radiation density is very small today, &lt;math&gt; \Omega_\text{rad} \sim 10^{-4} &lt;/math&gt;; if this term is neglected
the above has an analytic solution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frieman|first1=Joshua A.|last2=Turner|first2=Michael S.|last3=Huterer|first3=Dragan|title=Dark Energy and the Accelerating Universe|journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics|year=2008|volume=46|issue=1|pages=385–432|arxiv=0803.0982|doi=10.1146/annurev.astro.46.060407.145243|bibcode=2008ARA&amp;A..46..385F}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; a(t) = (\Omega_m / \Omega_\Lambda)^{1/3} \, \sinh^{2/3} ( t / t_\Lambda) &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; t_\Lambda \equiv 2 / (3 H_0 \sqrt{\Omega_\Lambda} ) \ ; &lt;/math&gt;
this is fairly accurate for &lt;math&gt;a &gt; 0.01&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;t &gt; 10&lt;/math&gt;million years.
Solving for &lt;math&gt; a(t) = 1 &lt;/math&gt; gives the present age of the universe &lt;math&gt; t_0 &lt;/math&gt; in terms of the other parameters.

It follows that the transition from decelerating to accelerating expansion (the second derivative &lt;math&gt; \ddot{a} &lt;/math&gt; crossing zero) occurred when
:&lt;math&gt; a = ( \Omega_m / 2 \Omega_\Lambda )^{1/3}&lt;/math&gt;

which evaluates to &lt;math&gt;a \sim 0.6&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;z \sim 0.66&lt;/math&gt; for the best-fit parameters estimated from the [[Planck spacecraft]].

==Historical development==
The discovery of the [[Cosmic Microwave Background]] (CMB) in 1964 confirmed a key prediction of the [[Big Bang]] cosmology. From that point on, it was generally accepted that the universe started in a hot, dense state and has been expanding over time. The rate of expansion depends on the types of matter and energy present in the universe, and in particular, whether the total density is above or below the so-called critical density. During the 1970s, most attention focused on pure-baryonic models, but there were serious challenges explaining the formation of galaxies, given the small anisotropies in the CMB (upper limits at that time). In the early 1980s, it was realized that this could be resolved if cold dark matter dominated over the baryons, and the theory of [[cosmic inflation]] motivated models with critical density. During the 1980s, most research focused on cold dark matter with critical density in matter, around 95% CDM and 5% baryons: these showed success at forming galaxies and clusters of galaxies, but problems remained; notably, the model required a Hubble constant lower than preferred by observations, and observations around 1988-1990 showed more large-scale galaxy clustering than predicted. These difficulties sharpened with the discovery of CMB anisotropy by [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]] in 1992, and several modified CDM models, including ΛCDM and mixed cold and hot dark matter, came under active consideration through the mid-1990s. The ΛCDM model then became the leading model following the observations of [[Accelerating universe|accelerating expansion]] in 1998, and was quickly supported by other observations: in 2000, the [[BOOMERanG]] microwave background experiment measured the total (matter–energy) density to be close to 100% of critical, whereas in 2001 the [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey|2dFGRS]] galaxy redshift survey measured the matter density to be near 25%; the large difference between these values supports a positive Λ or [[dark energy]]. Much more precise spacecraft measurements of the microwave background from [[WMAP]] in 2003 – 2010 and [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]] in 2013 - 2015 have continued to support the model and pin down the parameter values, most of which are now constrained below 1 percent uncertainty.

There is currently active research into many aspects of the ΛCDM model, both to refine the parameters and possibly detect deviations. In addition, ΛCDM has no explicit physical theory for the origin or physical nature of dark matter or dark energy; the nearly scale-invariant spectrum of the CMB perturbations, and their image across the celestial sphere, are believed to result from very small thermal and acoustic irregularities at the point of recombination. A large majority of astronomers and astrophysicists support the ΛCDM model or close relatives of it, but [[Mordehai Milgrom|Milgrom]], [[Stacy McGaugh|McGaugh]], and [[Pavel Kroupa|Kroupa]] are leading critics, attacking the dark matter portions of the theory from the perspective of [[galaxy formation]] models and supporting the alternative [[MOND]] theory, which requires a modification of the [[Einstein field equations]] and the [[Friedmann equations]] as seen in proposals such as [[MOG theory]] or [[Tensor–vector–scalar gravity|TeVeS theory]]. Other proposals by theoretical astrophysicists of cosmological alternatives to Einstein's general relativity that attempt to account for dark energy or dark matter include [[f(R) gravity]], [[Scalar–tensor theory|scalar–tensor theories]] such as [[galileon]] theories, [[brane cosmology|brane cosmologies]], the [[DGP model]], and [[massive gravity]] and its extensions such as [[bimetric theory|bimetric gravity]].

==Successes==
In addition to explaining pre-2000 observations,
the model has made a number of successful predictions: notably the existence of the
[[baryon acoustic oscillation]] feature, discovered in 2005 in the predicted location; and the statistics of weak [[gravitational lensing]], first observed in 2000 by several teams. The [[Cosmic microwave background#Polarization|polarization]] of the CMB, discovered in 2002 by DASI&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kovac|first1=J. M.|last2=Leitch|first2=E.

The six free parameters can be well constrained by the TT spectrum alone, and then the TE and EE spectra can be predicted theoretically to few-percent precision with no further adjustments allowed: comparison of theory and observations shows an excellent match.

==Challenges==
Extensive searches for dark matter particles have so far shown no well-agreed detection;
the dark energy may be almost impossible to detect in a laboratory, and its value is [[cosmological constant problem|unnaturally small]] compared to [[vacuum energy|naive theoretical predictions]].

Comparison of the model with observations is very successful on large scales (larger than galaxies, up to the observable horizon), but may have some problems on sub-galaxy scales, possibly predicting [[Dwarf galaxy problem|too many dwarf galaxies]] and too much dark matter in the innermost regions of galaxies. This problem is called the "small scale crisis".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The simple ΛCDM model is based on six [[parameter]]s: physical baryon density parameter; physical dark matter density parameter; the age of the universe; scalar spectral index; curvature fluctuation amplitude; and reionization optical depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The dark side of the cosmology: dark matter and dark energy|author=Spergel, D. N.|journal=Science|volume=347|issue=6226|year=2015|doi=10.1126/science.aaa0980|pmid=25745164|pages=1100–1102|bibcode=2015Sci...347.1100S}}&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with [[Occam's razor]], six is the smallest number of parameters needed to give an acceptable fit to current observations; other possible parameters are fixed at "natural" values, e.g. total density parameter = 1.00, dark energy equation of state = −1. (See below for extended models that allow these to vary.)

The values of these six parameters are mostly not predicted by current theory (though, ideally, they may be related by a future "[[Theory of Everything]]"), except that most versions of [[cosmic inflation]] predict the scalar spectral index should be slightly smaller than 1, consistent with the estimated value 0.96. The parameter values, and uncertainties, are estimated using large computer searches to locate the region of parameter space providing an acceptable match to cosmological observations. From these six parameters, the other model values, such as the [[Hubble's law|Hubble constant]] and the [[dark energy]] density, can be readily calculated.

Commonly, the set of observations fitted includes the [[cosmic microwave background]] anisotropy, the brightness/redshift relation for supernovae, and large-scale galaxy clustering including the [[baryon acoustic oscillation]] feature. Other observations, such as the Hubble constant, the abundance of galaxy clusters, [[weak gravitational lensing]] and globular cluster ages, are generally consistent with these, providing a check of the model, but are less precisely measured at present.

Parameter values listed below are from the Planck Collaboration Cosmological parameters 68% confidence limits for the base ΛCDM model from Planck CMB power spectra, in combination with lensing reconstruction and external data (BAO + JLA + H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name="Planck 2015"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Planck Collaboration | title = Planck 2015 results.

==Missing baryon problem==
{{main article|Missing baryon problem}}
Massimo Persic and Paolo Salucci&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0502178.pdf The baryon content of the universe, M. Persic and P. Salucci, Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, 1992]&lt;/ref&gt; firstly estimated the baryonic density today present in ellipticals, spirals, groups and clusters of galaxies.
They performed an integration of the baryonic mass-to-light ratio over luminosity (in the following &lt;math display="inline"&gt;  M_b/L &lt;/math&gt;), weighted with the luminosity function &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\phi(L)&lt;/math&gt; over the previously mentioned classes of astrophysical objects: 

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_b = \sum \int L\phi(L) \frac{M_b}{L} \, dL.&lt;/math&gt;

The result was:

:&lt;math&gt; \Omega_b=\Omega_*+\Omega_\text{gas}=2.2\times10^{-3}+1.5\times10^{-3}h^{-1.3}\simeq0.003&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; h\simeq0.72 &lt;/math&gt;.

Note that this value is much lower than the prediction of standard cosmic nucleosynthesis &lt;math&gt; \Omega_b\simeq0.048 &lt;/math&gt;, so that stars and gas in galaxies and in galaxy groups and clusters account for less than 10% of the primordially synthesized baryons. This issue is known as the problem of the "missing baryons".

Extended models allow one or more of the "fixed" parameters above to vary, in addition to the basic six; so these models join smoothly to the basic six-parameter model in the limit that the additional parameter(s) approach the default values. For example, possible extensions of the simplest ΛCDM model allow for spatial curvature (&lt;math&gt;\Omega_{tot}&lt;/math&gt; may be different from 1); or [[quintessence (physics)|quintessence]] rather than a [[cosmological constant]] where the [[Equation of state (cosmology)|equation of state]] of dark energy is allowed to differ from −1. Cosmic inflation predicts tensor fluctuations ([[gravitational wave]]s). Their amplitude is parameterized by the tensor-to-scalar ratio (denoted &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;), which is determined by the unknown energy scale of inflation. Other modifications allow [[hot dark matter]] in the form of [[neutrino]]s more massive than the minimal value, or a running spectral index; the latter is generally not favoured by simple cosmic inflation models.

Allowing additional variable parameter(s) will generally ''increase'' the uncertainties in the standard six parameters quoted above, and may also shift the central values slightly. The Table below shows results for each of the possible "6+1" scenarios with one additional variable parameter; this indicates that, as of 2015, there is no convincing evidence that any additional parameter is different from its default value.

Some researchers have suggested that there is a running spectral index, but no statistically significant study has revealed one. Theoretical expectations suggest that the tensor-to-scalar ratio &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; should be between 0 and 0.3, and the latest results are now within those limits.

This is a list of notable [[16-bit]] [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#Regular RGB palettes|RGB]] [[palette (computing)|color palettes]], which were primarily manufactured from 1985 to 1995. Due to mixed-bit architectures, the ''n''-bit distinction is not always a strict categorization.

==Atari==

===ST series===
The [[Atari ST]] series has a [[Digital-to-Analog Converter]] of 3-bits, eight levels per RGB channel, featuring a [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#9-bit RGB|9-bit RGB palette (512 colors)]].
The [[Atari ST#STE|STE]] series has a [[Digital-to-Analog Converter]] of 4-bits, sixteen levels per RGB channel, featuring a [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#12-bit RGB|12-bit RGB palette (4096 colors)]].

Depending on the (proprietary) monitor type attached, it displays one of the 320×200, 16-colors and 640×200, 4-colors modes with the color monitor, or the high resolution 640×400 black and white mode with the [[monochrome monitor]].

==Commodore==

===Amiga OCS===
The Original Chip Set (OCS) of the [[Commodore Amiga]] features a [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#12-bit RGB|12-bit RGB, 4,096-color palette]]. As the Amiga [[Original_Chip_Set#Copper|Copper]] programmable graphics coprocessor is capable of changing color lookup table entries on the fly during display, in practice the number of distinct colors visible on-screen may have exceed static color lookup table sizes documented here.

====5-bit====
The graphic surface is divided in a series of [[Bit-plane|bit planes]], between 1 and 6 for horizontal resolutions of 320 (or up to 384 with overscan), and between 1 and 4 for horizontal resolutions of 640 (or up to 768 with overscan). For either horizontal resolution, the vertical resolution is either 200 (or up to 240 with overscan), or 400 (or up to 480 with overscan) if interlaced, for [[NTSC]]-compatible video modes; or 256 (or up to 288 with overscan), or 512 (or up to 576 with overscan) if interlaced, for [[PAL]]-compatible video modes. The [[CLUT|color lookup table]] has up to 32 entries. So the different indexed color modes are from 1 to 5 bits pixel depth, 2-, 4-, 8-, 16- or 32-color out of 4,096.

|[[Image:Screen color test Amiga 32colors.png]]
|}

====6-bit====
When the sixth bit-plane is used, two extra color modes can be set: [[Extra Half-Brite]] (EHB) and [[Hold-And-Modify]] (HAM).

In the EHB mode, 6-bits pixel points to one of the 32 colors in the palette with their lower 5-bits, and if the 6th bit is on, the bright of the color is halved (hence the name of this mode). So there are a total of 64 visible colors: the user chooses light versions of the first 32 colors and the system already provides their darker versions.

In the HAM mode, the two higher bits of the 6-bits pixels are used as a four state command. Three of the states changes only the red, green or blue component of the pixel respect of the precedent in the scan line, and hold the other two RGB components. The new value for the modified color component is in the four lower bits. The remaining command state forces the pixel value to be one of the 16 first values of the palette, whose indice is in the four lower bits of the pixel. So it is very important to have a well selected palette, or the color will spread easily among consecutive pixels in the scan line of the image. This mode can display all of the 4,096 colors simultaneously.

==Apple==

===Apple IIgs===
[[Apple IIgs]], along with full compatible graphic modes with the [[Apple II]], features a custom Video Graphics Chip (VGC)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.byte.com/art/9610/sec4/art2.htm BYTE.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010202554/http://www.byte.com/art/9610/sec4/art2.htm |date=2008-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which supports a [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#12-bit RGB|12-bit RGB, 4,096-color palette]]. It has an extended set of 320×200 and 640×200 graphic modes, (called Super High-Res modes by Apple) with different (and a bit complex) color modes:
* 320×200 with 16 palettes of 16 selected colors out of 4,096 each. Every single scan line can be assigned to one of the sixteen palettes, so it can have up to 16×16=256 different simultaneous colors (although some common colors like black and white are usually shared among the different palettes, giving fewer than 256 total different colors). The most simple way to use this mode is having a unique 16-color selection for the entire screen and assign it to all scan lines. Here are shown the sample image both using a single shared palette and using all the 16 palettes (in this case, by dividing the image into 16 strips):

:[[Image:Screen color test AppleIIgs 16colors.png]] [[Image:Screen color test AppleIIgs 16x16colors.png]]
* 640×200 with 16 palettes of 8 selected colors out of 4,096 each. Every single scan line can be assigned to one of the sixteen palettes, so it can be have up to 8×16=128 different simultaneous colors (usually less due to shared colors). In a single scan line, even column pixels can have one of the first four colors of the line's assigned palette, and odd column pixels one of the last four colors of the eight. The most simple way to use this mode is having a unique 8-color selection for the entire screen with four duplicate colors (the same to both even and odd pixel columns) and assign it to all scan lines. Here are shown the sample image both with a single shared custom 4-color palette and with a single 8-color palette (black, blue, yellow, white, black again, red, green, white again) to produce 13 dithered-by-hardware colors, ("dark blue" "dark yellow" "gray" "dark red" "magenta" "orange" "light red" "dark green" "cyan" "lime green" "light green" "light blue" and "light yellow") plus pure black and white. The last was the [[Apple GS/OS|Apple IIgs Finder]] default mode and palette.

:[[Image:Screen color test Amiga 4colors.png]] [[Image:Screen color test AppleIIgs 4x2colors.png]]

Also, along with the one of 16 palettes, to each scan line the Apple IIgs VGC is able to assign individual 320 or 640 horizontal resolution independently.

==IBM PC/AT and compatible systems==
:''For the palettes of previous original [[IBM PC]], [[IBM XT]] and [[IBM PCjr]]/[[Tandy 1000]] series hardware displays, please visit [[List of 8-bit computer hardware palettes#IBM PC/XT and compatible systems|IBM PC/XT and compatible systems]] in the [[List of 8-bit computer hardware palettes]] article.''

===EGA===
The [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter]] (EGA) supports all [[List of 8-bit computer hardware palettes#CGA|CGA modes]] and add three more: two 320×200 and 640×200 graphic modes, both with the full CGA 16-color palette (intended to be used with the same "digital RGB" CGA color monitor of 200 scan lines) and an extra 640×350 graphic mode with 16 colors chosen from a [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#6-bit RGB|6-bit RGB (64 colors) palette]] for what IBM then called an "analog RGB" type monitor.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1987"&gt;Richard Wilton, Programmer's Guide to PC &amp; PS/2 VIDEO SYSTEMS, 1987, Microsoft Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''[[analog signal|analog]]'' means here that the RGB signals can have more than the bare two possible levels 0 and 1; (as the so-called —by IBM— "digital RGB" CGA monitor type has) despite of its name, colors are produced digitally, so there exists binary (quantized) steps for every primary RGB signal (two bits, four levels per primary, in this case). Thus, the EGA signal from the computer to this kind of monitor had two wires for each primary red, green and blue. Later, true analog connectors were developed by IBM for the more advanced MCGA and VGA display adapters and monitors, (see the next section) which are unrelated to (and incompatible with) the EGA "analog" monitors.

Some early EGA cards shipped only 64 KiB of video memory, (the nominal was 128KiB, up to a maximum of 256 KiB to allow more screen pages in memory) so the 640×350 graphic mode provides only four colors. This was never a proper mode by itself, and therefore was not popular.

Monochrome "analog" monitors also existed for EGA. The colors are then mapped internally to the correspondent [[Luminance (relative)|luminance]] gray, (the sum of the 30% of the red signal, the 59% of the green and the 11% of the blue) giving a 16-shades from a 64-grayscale palette. "Positive" class monitors inverts the signal, providing that the default EGA colors for text modes (black background and white foreground) displays reversed, (white background and black foreground) as if were a printed document.

===MCGA and VGA===
The [[IBM Multicolor Graphics Adapter|Multicolor Graphics Array]] (MCGA) and [[Video Graphics Array]] (VGA) used a 6-bits per channel, 64 levels [[Digital-to-Analog Converter]] (DAC) to give an [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#18-bit RGB|18-bit RGB palette (262,144 colors)]], from which can be selected any 2, 16, or 256 at a time.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1987"/&gt; They both provided full compatibility with [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]] modes, while VGA included all the [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]] modes as well as the MCGA modes. When connected to analog monochrome monitors, they offered 64 levels of grey. Some of the first [[Portable computer|portable PCs]] featured a flat monochrome [[plasma display]] with a VGA in shades of red.

===8514/A and XGA===

It does not support compatibility with VGA modes, but a VGA card is usually already installed and ''bridged'' to the 8514/A to provide a single output cable for a single monitor which can display any of all VGA and 8514/A possible modes.

The [[XGA|eXtended Graphics Array]] (XGA) supports all 8514/A modes plus an 800×600 [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#16-bit RGB|16-bit RGB]] [[Highcolor]] mode, with 65,536 simultaneous colors on screen.

===Super VGA (SVGA)===
Enhanced clones of the IBM VGA, known as [[Super VGA]], (SVGA) support 256 simultaneous colors in 640×480 and higher pixel resolutions (800×600, 1024×768) in both 16 and 256 picked colors from the VGA [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#18-bit RGB|18-bit RGB palette]], depending on the model and the manufacturer. Also, some SVGA cards support [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#15-bit RGB|15-]] and [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#16-bit RGB|16-bit RGB]] [[Highcolor]] modes, with 32,768 or 65,536 simultaneous colors on screen in 640×480 and higher resolutions. Some later models reach the [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#24-bit RGB|24-bit RGB]] [[True Color|True color]] modes.

In the 1990s, most manufacturers adhered to the [[VESA BIOS Extensions]] (VBE), used for enabling standard support for advanced video modes (at high resolutions and color depths).

They are the direct predecessors, not the IBM 8514/A nor XGA, of actual graphic display PC hardware.

'''''Miguxês''''' ({{IPA-pt|miɡuˈʃes}} or {{IPA-pt|miɣuˈʃeʃ|}}), also known in [[Portugal]] as '''''pita talk''''' or '''''pita script''''' (&lt;small&gt;pronounced &lt;/small&gt;{{IPA-pt|ˈpitɐ|}}), is an [[Internet slang]] of the [[Portuguese language]], commonly used by mostly [[Brazil]]ian teenagers in [[Internet]] and other electronic media, such as messages written in [[cell phone]].

==Brief history==

Its name derives from ''miguxo'', a corruption from ''amiguxo'', turn a term used for ''amiguinho'', or "buddy" in Portuguese. This [[sociolect]] of Vernacular [[Brazilian Portuguese]] brings possible simplifications in the grammatical structures, since the vehicles in which ''miguxês'' is used are nearly universally colloquial, often space-delimited (such as [[SMS message]]s, [[instant messenger]]s or [[social network]]s). It also tends to have "simpler" orthography in comparison to standard Portuguese orthography, which leads to the most strong criticism to it (''miguxês'' without its common alternative spellings is associated with the just normal Internet and/or youth slang).

There are identitarian and orthographic differences between the so-called [[leet]]speak, ''miguxês'', ''tiopês'' and ''internetês'' — Brazilian Portuguese for [[netspeak]], which is by far the one that most closely resembles standard Portuguese —, all common sociolects found in the Portuguese-speaking digital network community, the three latter ones created in it.

Basically, the use of each category depends on the individual choice and the environment in which people are interacting. While in the Internet, in a general manner, there is a handful of a different phenomenon in which users communicate with abbreviations to simplify writing, ''miguxês'' carries with it an effective intention, that is, to express an infantile language in a conversation between friends, or even satirize this style of communication. In certain subcultures in Brazil, especially in the case of what is called '[[emo]]' there, ''miguxês'' is an item of group identification. So it would not be unusual for someone which opposes such subcultures to also develop a distaste for ''miguxês''. Brazilian '[[Emo#Backlash|anti-emo]]' groups usually satirize 'emo' teenagers with use of ''miguxês''.

Together with the cited urban tribes, they started to fell out of the mainstream in the early 2010s, so that they have much lower popularity with the following teen generation that did not see its spreading as a frequent Internet meme.

==Spelling==

Although orthography rules of ''miguxês'' may vary individually, and also in each region and in different [[urban tribe]]s since it is plain broken Portuguese, there are certain characteristics often commonly found as:

* Replacement of ''s'' and ''c'' for ''x'', simulating the [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]] of native Portuguese-speaking children's speech through their language acquisition: ''você'' (Second person singular), ''vocês'' (Second person plural) &gt; ''vuxeh'', ''vuxeix'';
* Omission or replacement of [[diacritics]], notably by replacing an acute accent over a vowel with the letter ''h'' after the vowel as in ''é'' ("is") &gt; ''eh'' (to distinguish it from the word ''e'' meaning "and") or ''será'' ("will be") &gt; ''serah''. Or replacing the [[tilde]] with ''n''/''m'' to indicate nasalization: ''não'' ("no") &gt; ''nawn''/''naum''
* Replacement of ''i'' by ''ee'', influenced by [[English language]] orthography: ''gatinha'' (female kitten, also a slang for pretty girl) &gt; ''gateenha'';
* Replacement of ''o'' and ''e'' by ''u'' and ''i'' respectively, specially in non-tonic syllables: ''quero'' (I want) &gt; ''keru''.
* Replacing the digraph ''qu'' and the letter ''c'' as ''k'' both for brevity and as a form of [[sensational spelling]], and deleting the ''u'' of these environments: ''quem'' (who), ''escreveu'' (wrote) &gt; ''kem'', ''ixkrevew''

==Tiopês==
[[2010s in fashion#Youth fashion|Brazilian indie and scene kids]] use a related Internet sociolect, the ''tiopês'' (from ''tiop'', which is a corruption of Portuguese ''tipo'', or equivalent to English "like, totally", in ''tiopês''), which mainly uses [[ingroup]] [[Internet meme|meme]]s as well purposeful ridiculous-sounding [[Spelling#Misspellings|misspellings]] to add humor or irony to the message and bring group identification, much like [[teh]] of English-derived leetspeak.&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://youpix.com.br/memepedia/a-origem-do-tiopes/ The origin of "tiopês" – memepedia – youPIX, people + pixels] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010130045/http://youpix.com.br/memepedia/a-origem-do-tiopes/ |date=2012-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As it is common for the ''miguxês'', there are detractors of ''tiopês'', although much less numbered and for different reasons (usually, people which are detractors at the same time of different youth subcultures deemed as alienated, including 'emo' teenagers, [[2000–2009 in fashion#Youth fashion|scene kids]] and [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|indie kids]]). ''Tiopês'' is also much less common in the Portuguese-speaking Internet community, and is said to be a phenomenon limited to Brazil.

===Example===
* Tiopês: amiogs, eo tiop a~mo a dercycolpëdya, rsrsrs1!!11! o artigo deels sorb noës indys eh tuod mas asi~m meninës nein toads os saitys de parödjas soa lezgaus tiop augums pormoven ~polëmicas~ conmo precomseiots e eu noa asho iso valiod un boa~m eggzenpel ~master no ingreis AEAEAEAE~ seriä a tau da emceeclopëdia dramatchyca q aepzar do noem noa shorem leëtros pro sel fin11!11!
* Rough colloquial Brazilian Portuguese translation of the ''tiopês'' piece: Gente, eu absolutamente adoro a Desciclopédia, hahahaha, o artigo deles sobre nós indies é tudo, mas tenho algo a dizer a vocês, nem todos os ''sites'' de paródia são legais, alguns deles promovem coisas controversas como preconceitos, e eu não acho esse tipo de coisa válida, um bom exemplo seria uma certa Encyclopedia Dramatica que apesar do nome, não é de se sofrer um drama por seu fim.
* English, literal translation of the Portuguese piece: You guys, I [have to tell that I] absolutely love/adore [[Uncyclopedia]], hahahaha, their [Portuguese] article on us indie kids is awesome, but I have something to say [to you], not every parody site is cool, some of them promote controversial things such as [a number of] prejudices, and I am reticent of [all] this kind of thing, a good example would be a so-called [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] that in spite of its name, would not be worth of a drama because of its end.

'''Non-formal learning''' includes various structured [[learning]] situations which do not either have the level of [[curriculum]], [[syllabus]], [[Educational accreditation|accreditation]] and [[certification]] associated with '[[formal learning]]', but have more structure than that associated with '[[informal learning]]', which typically take place naturally and spontaneously as part of other activities. These form the three styles of learning recognised and supported by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/education/skills-beyond-school/recognitionofnon-formalandinformallearning-home.htm|title=Recognition of Non-formal and Informal Learning - Home|publisher=OECD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of non-formal learning include swimming sessions for toddlers, community-based sports programs, and programs developed by organisations such as the [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts]], the [[Girl Guides]], community or non-credit [[adult education]] courses, sports or fitness programs, professional conference style [[seminar]]s, and continuing professional development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authors=Eaton, Sarah Elaine|title=Formal, Non-Formal and Informal Learning|url=http://www.infed.org/archives/e-texts/eaton_formal_nonformal_informal_learning.htm |date =22 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The learner’s objectives may be to increase skills and knowledge, as well as to experience the emotional rewards associated with increased love for a subject or increased passion for learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quality guide to non-formal and informal learning processes|url=http://www.menon.org/publications/TQM%20Guide%20for%20informal%20learning.pdf|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wT2umMVj|date =2004|archive-date=13 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The debate over the relative value of formal and informal learning has existed for a number of years. Traditionally formal learning takes place in a [[school]] or [[university]] and has a greater value placed upon it than informal learning, such as learning within the workplace. This concept of formal learning being the socio-cultural accepted norm for learning was first challenged by Scribner and Cole&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authors=Scribner, S. and Cole, M.|year=1973|title=Cognitive Consequences of Formal and Informal Education, Science|pages=182, 553–559}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1973, who claimed most things in life are better learnt through informal processes, citing [[language learning]] as an example. Moreover, anthropologists noted that complex learning still takes place within indigenous communities that had no formal educational institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Lave, J. and Wenger, E.|year=1991|title=Situated Learning: Legitimate Peripheral Participation|publisher=Cambridge: Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It’s the acquisition of this knowledge or learning which occurs in everyday life that has not been fully valued or understood. This led to the declaration by the OECD educational ministers of the "[[life-long learning]] for all"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=OCED|title=Lifelong Learning for All|url=http://www.oecdbookshop.org/browse.asp?pid=title-detail&amp;lang=en&amp;ds=&amp;k=5LMQCR2K9XLP|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; strategy in 1996. This includes 23 countries from five continents, who have sought to clarify and validate all forms of learning including formal, non-formal and informal. This has been in conjunction with the [[European Union]] which has also developed policies for life-long learning which focus strongly on the need to identify, assess and certify non-formal and informal learning, particularly in the workplace.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Formal and informal learning==

Although all definitions can be contested (see below) this article shall refer to the [[European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training]] (Cedefop) 2001 communication on 'lifelong learning: formal, non-formal and informal learning' as the guideline for the differing definitions.

'''Formal learning''': learning typically provided by an education or training institution, structured (in terms of learning objectives, learning time or learning support) and leading to certification. Formal learning is intentional from the learner’s perspective. (Cedefop 2001)&lt;ref name="europa1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary of key terms|url=http://www.cedefop.europa.eu/EN/about-cedefop/projects/validation-of-non-formal-and-informal-learning/european-inventory-glossary.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Informal learning''': learning resulting from daily life activities related to work, family or leisure. It is not structured (in terms of learning objectives, learning time or learning support) and typically does not lead to certification. Informal learning may be intentional but in most cases it is not-intentional (or "incidental"/random). (Cedefop 2001)&lt;ref name="europa1"/&gt;

'''Non-formal learning''': see definition above.

==Contested definitions==
If there is no clear distinction between formal and in-formal learning where is the room for non-formal learning. It is a contested issue with numerous definitions given. The following are some the competing theories.

'''''"It is difficult to make a clear distinction between formal and informal learning as there is often a crossover between the two."''''' (McGivney, 1999, p1).&lt;ref&gt;[McGivney, V. (1999) Informal learning in the community: a trigger for change and development (Leicester: NIACE). Cited in ‘Helen Colley, Phil Hodkinson &amp; Janice Malcolm (2002) Non-formal learning: mapping the conceptual terrain. A Consultation Report, Leeds: University of Leeds Lifelong Learning Institute. Also available in the informal education archives: http://www.infed.org/archives/e-texts/colley_informal_learning.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Hodkinson et al. (2003), conclude after a significant literature analysis on the topics of formal, informal, and non-formal learning, that "the terms informal and non-formal appeared interchangeable, each being primarily defined in opposition to the dominant formal education system, and the largely individualist and acquisitional conceptualisations of learning developed in relation to such educational contexts." (Hodkinson et al., 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;314)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hodkinson|first=Phil |author2=Colley, Hellen |author3=Janice Malcolm|title=The Interrelationships Between Informal and Formal Learning|journal=Journal of Workplace Learning|year=2003|volume=15|pages=313–318}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, he states that "It is important not to see informal and formal attributes as somehow separate, waiting to be integrated. This is the dominant view in the literature, and it is mistaken. Thus, the challenge is not to, somehow, combine informal and formal learning, for informal and formal attributes are present and inter-related, whether we will it so or not. The challenge is to recognise and identify them, and understand the implications. For this reason, '''the concept of non-formal learning, at least when seen as a middle state between formal and informal, is redundant'''." (p.&amp;nbsp;314)

''Eraut's&lt;ref&gt;[Eraut, M. (2000) Non-formal learning, implicit learning and tacit knowledge, in F. Coffield (Ed) The Necessity of Informal Learning, Bristol: Policy Press (2000)]&lt;/ref&gt; classification of learning into formal and non-formal'':

This removes informal learning from the equation and states all learning outside of formal learning is non-formal. Eraut equates informal with connotations of dress, language or behaviour that have no relation to learning. Eraut defines formal learning as taking place within a learning framework; within a classroom or learning institution, with a designated teacher or trainer; the award of a qualification or credit; the external specification of outcomes. Any learning that occurs outside of these parameters is non-formal. (Ined 2002)&lt;ref name="infed1"&gt;[Ined:Non-Formal Learning http://www.infed.org/archives/e-texts/colley_informal_learning.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

''The EC (2001) Communication on Lifelong Learning: formal, non-formal and informal learning'':

The EU places non-formal learning in between formal and informal learning (see above). This has learning both in a formal setting with a learning framework and as an organised event but within a qualification. "Non-formal learning: learning that is not provided by an education or training institution and typically does not lead to certification. It is, however, structured (in terms of learning objectives, learning time or learning support). Non-formal learning is intentional from the learner’s perspective." (Cedefop 2001)&lt;ref name="europa1"/&gt;

''Livingstone's&lt;ref&gt;[Livingstone, D.W. (2001) Adults’ Informal Learning: Definitions, Findings, Gaps and Future Research, Toronto: OISE/UT (NALL Working Paper No.21) at http://www.oise.utoronto.ca/depts/sese/csew/nall/res/21adultsifnormallearning.htm,(2001)]&lt;/ref&gt; adults formal and informal education, non-formal and informal learning'':

This focuses on the idea of adult non-formal education. This new mode, ‘informal education’ is when teachers or mentors guide learners without reference to structured learning outcomes. This informal education learning is gaining knowledge without an imposed framework, such as learning new job skills. (Infed, 2002)&lt;ref name="infed1"/&gt;

''Billett&lt;ref&gt;[Billett, S. (2001a) Participation and continuity at work: A critique of current workplace learning discourses, paper given at the conference Context, Power and Perspective: Confronting the Challenges to Improving Attainment in Learning at Work, Sunley Management Centre, University College Northampton, 8 –10 November]&lt;/ref&gt; (2001): there is no such thing as informal learning'':

Billet's definition states there is no such thing as non-formal and informal learning. He states all human activity is learning, and that everything people do involves a process of learning. "all learning takes place within social organisations or communities that have formalised structures." Moreover, he states most learning in life takes place outside of formal education.(Ined 2002)&lt;ref name="infed1"/&gt;

==Validation==

Recently, many [[international organization]]s and [[UNESCO]] Member States have emphasized the importance of learning that takes place outside of formal learning settings. This emphasis has led UNESCO, through its [[UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning|Institute of Lifelong Learning]] (UIL), to adopt international guidelines for the Recognition, Validation and Accreditation of the Outcomes of Non-formal and Informal Learning in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;UIL. 2012. ''Guidelines for the Recognition, Validation and Accreditation of the Outcomes of Non-formal and Informal Learning''. Hamburg, Germany, UIL.&lt;/ref&gt;  The emphasis has also led to an increasing number of policies and programmes in many Member States, and a gradual shift from pilots to large-scale systems such as those in Portugal, France, Australia, Mauritius and South Africa.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002428/242887e.pdf|title=Level-setting and recognition of learning outcomes: The use of level descriptors in the twenty-first century|last=Keevy|first=James|last2=Chakroun|first2=Borhene|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100138-3|location=|pages=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training|Cedefop]] has created European guidelines to provide validation to a broad range of learning experiences, thereby aiding transparency and comparability across its national borders. The broad framework for achieving this certification across both non-formal and informal learning is outlined in the Cedefop European guidelines for validating non-formal and informal learning; Routes from learning to certification.&lt;ref&gt;[European guidelines for validating non-formal and informal learning; Routes from learning to certification. figure 2 p.18. http://www.cedefop.europa.eu/EN/Files/4054_en.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Different countries' approaches==

There are different approaches to validation between OCED and EU countries, with countries adopting different measures. The EU, as noted above, through the Cedefop-released European guidelines for validating non-formal and informal learning in 2009 to standardise validation throughout the EU. Within the OCED countries, the picture is more mixed.

== Flexible schooling or participatory schooling ==

Non-formal education (NFE) is popular on a worldwide scale in both 'western' and 'developing countries'. Non-formal education can form a matrix with formal and non-formal education, as non-formal education can mean any form of systematic learning conducted outside the formal setting. Many courses in relation to non-formal education have been introduced in several universities in western and developing countries.

The UNESCO institute of education conducted a seminar on non-formal [[education in Morocco]]. The association for development of education in Africa (ADEA) launched many programmes in non-formal education in at least 15 countries of Sub-Saharan Africa. In 2001 World Bank conducted an international seminar on basic education in non-formal programmes. In addition to this the World Bank was advised to extend its services to adult and non-formal education.

A report on vocational education, Making Learning Visible: the identification, assessment and recognition of non-formal learning in Europe, defines non-formal learning as semi structured, consisting of planned and explicit approaches to learning introduced into work organisations and elsewhere, not recognised within the formal education and training system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alan Rogers|title=Non-Formal Education: Flexible Schooling or Participatory Education?|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=pQQcOj3Iu1QC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP8&amp;dq=non+formal+education&amp;ots=JpjgCLrr9p&amp;sig=jGiHsF0HZOG3EcyTtcrE5FDewnc#v=onepage&amp;q=non%20formal%20education&amp;f=false|ref=book}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==

Community work, which is particularly widespread in Scotland, fosters people's  commitment to their neighbours and encourages participation in and development of local democratic forms of organisation.

Youth work which focuses on making people more active in the society.

Social work which helps young people in homes to develop ways to deal with complex situations like fostering fruitful relationships between parents and children, bringing different groups of career together, etc...

In France and Italy animation in a particular form is a kind of non-formal education. It uses theatre and acting as means of self-expression with different community groups for children and people with special needs. This type of non-formal education helps in ensuring active participation and teaches people to manage the community in which they live.

Youth and community organisations young people have the opportunity  to discover, analyse and understand values and their implications and build a set of values to guide their lives. They run work camps and meetings, recruit volunteers, administer bank acoounts, give counselling etc. to work toward social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mr Cristian Dumitrescu|title=Non formal education|url=http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/XRef/X2H-Xref-ViewHTML.asp?FileID=8807&amp;lang=en|work=Report|agency=Committee on Culture and Education|date=15 December 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Importance ==

Education plays an important role in  development. Out of school programmes are important to provide adaptable learning opportunities and new skills and knowledge to a large percentage of people who are beyond the reach of formal education. Non-formal education began to gain popularity in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Today, non-formal education is seen as a concept of recurrent and lifelong learning.

Non-formal education is popular among the adults specially the women as it increases women's participation in both private and public activities, i.e. in house hold decision making and as active citizens in the community affairs and national development. These literacy programmes have a dramatic impact on women's self-esteem because they unleash their potential in economic, social, cultural and political spheres.

According to UNESCO (2010), non-formal education helps to ensures equal access to education, eradicate illiteracy among women and improve women's access to vocational training, science, technology and continuing education. It also encourages the development of non-discriminatory education and training. The effectiveness of such literacy and non-formal education programmes are bolstered  by family, community and parental involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Department of Educational Foundations and Management|title=A Critical Assessment of the Role/Importance of Non-Formal Education to Human and National Development in Nigeria: Future Trends|url=http://www.ijsre.com/Vol.,%205_2_-Ololube%20&amp;%20Egbezor.pdf|ref=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages ==

Non-formal education is beneficial in a number of ways. There are activities that encourage young people to choose their own programme and projects that are important because they offer the youth the flexibility and freedom to explore their emerging interests. When the youth can choose the activities in which they can participate, they have opportunities to develop several skills like decision making skills.

Non-formal learning has experiential learning activities that foster the development of skills and knowledge. This helps in building the confidence and abilities among the youth of today. It also helps in development of personal relationships not only among the youth but also among the adults. It helps in developing interpersonal skills among the young people as they learn to interact with peers outside the class and with adults in the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stephen T. Russell|title=The Developmental Benefits of Nonformal Education and Youth Development|issue=The University of California, Davis|url=http://www.ca4h.org/files/1231.pdf|ref=journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disadvantages ==

There are drawbacks to non-formal education which include that non-formal learning is not based on curriculum but based on experience. There is low efficiency in non-formal education.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

== Necessity ==

Formal education system are inadequate to effectively meet the needs of the individual and the society. The need to offer more and better education at all levels, to a growing number of people, particularly in developing countries, the scant success of current formal education systems to meet all such demands, has shown the need to develop alternatives to learning.

The rigid structure of formal schools, mainly because of rules and regulations than concentrating on the real need of the students, offering curriculum that leans away from the individual and from society, far more concerned with performing programmes than reaching useful objectives. This called for non-formal education which starting from the basic need of the students, is concerned with the establishment of strategies that are compatible with reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Claudio Zaki Dib|title=FORMAL, NON-FORMAL AND INFORMAL EDUCATION: CONCEPTS/APPLICABILITY|url=http://www.techne-dib.com.br/downloads/6.pdf|publisher=stitute of Physics University of São Paulo, Brazil|ref=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project assembles digital collections of [[humanities]] resources. It is hosted by the department of [[Classics]]. The project is [[mirror website|mirrored]] by the [[Max Planck Society]] in [[Berlin]], Germany,&lt;ref&gt;[http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/ Berlin Perseus mirror] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127080511/http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/ |date=2010-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://perseus.uchicago.edu/ Chicago Perseus mirror]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The project was founded in 1987 to collect and present materials for the study of [[ancient Greece]]. It has published two [[CD-ROM]]s and established the Perseus Digital Library on the [[World Wide Web]] in 1995. The project has expanded its original scope; current collections cover Greco-Roman classics and the [[English Renaissance]]. Other materials, such as the papers of [[Edwin Bolles]] and the history of Tufts University, have been moved into the [[Tufts Digital Library]].

The editor-in-chief of the project is [[Gregory Crane]], the Tufts Winnick Family Chair in Technology and Entrepreneurship. He has held that position since the founding of the Perseus Project.

In [[continuum mechanics]], a material is said to be under '''plane stress''' if the [[stress (mechanics)|stress vector]] is zero across a particular surface.  When that situation occurs over an entire element of a structure, as is often the case for thin plates, the [[stress analysis]] is considerably simplified, as the stress state can be represented by a [[tensor]] of dimension 2 (representable as a 2 × 2 matrix rather than 3 × 3). &lt;ref name=Meyers/&gt; A related notion, [[plane strain]], is often applicable to very thick members.

Plane stress typically occurs in thin flat plates that are acted upon only by load forces that are parallel to them.  In certain situations, a gently curved thin plate may also be assumed to have plane stress for the purpose of stress analysis. This is the case, for example, of a thin-walled cylinder filled with a fluid under pressure.  In such cases, stress components perpendicular to the plate are negligible compared to those parallel to it.&lt;ref name=Meyers/&gt;

In other situations, however, the bending stress of a thin plate cannot be neglected. One can still simplify the analysis by using a two-dimensional domain, but the plane stress tensor at each point must be complemented with bending terms.

==Mathematical definition==

Mathematically, the stress at some point in the material is a plane stress if one of the three [[principal stress]]es (the [[eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalues]] of the [[Cauchy stress tensor]]) is zero.  That is, there is [[Cartesian coordinate system]] in which the stress tensor has the form  
: &lt;math&gt;\sigma = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_{11} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; \sigma_{22} &amp; 0 \\
0      &amp;     0       &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix} 
\equiv 
\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_{x} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; \sigma_{y} &amp; 0 \\
0      &amp;     0       &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
 
For example, consider a rectangular block of material measuring 10, 40 and 5 [[centimetre|cm]] along the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, that is being stretched in the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; direction and compressed in the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; direction, by pairs of opposite forces with magnitudes 10 [[newton (unit)|N]] and 20 N, respectively, uniformly distributed over the corresponding faces.  The stress tensor inside the block will be

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma = 
\begin{bmatrix}
500\mathrm{ Pa} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; -4000\mathrm{ Pa} &amp; 0 \\
0      &amp;     0       &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, if one chooses the first two coordinate axes arbitrarily but perpendicular to the direction of zero stress, the stress tensor will have the form
: &lt;math&gt;\sigma = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_{11} &amp; \sigma_{12} &amp; 0 \\
\sigma_{21} &amp; \sigma_{22} &amp; 0 \\
0      &amp;     0       &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix} 
\equiv 
\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_{x} &amp; \tau_{xy} &amp; 0 \\
\tau_{yx} &amp; \sigma_{y} &amp; 0 \\
0      &amp;     0       &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
and can therefore be represented by a 2 × 2 matrix,
: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{ij} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_{11} &amp; \sigma_{12} \\
\sigma_{21} &amp; \sigma_{22}
\end{bmatrix} 
\equiv 
\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_{x} &amp; \tau_{xy} \\
\tau_{yx} &amp; \sigma_{y}
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

== Constitutive equations ==
:''See [[Hooke's law#Plane_stress]]''

==Plane stress in curved surfaces ==
In certain cases, the plane stress model can be used in the analysis of gently curved surfaces. For example,
consider a thin-walled cylinder subjected to an axial compressive load uniformly distributed along its rim, and filled with a pressurized fluid.  The internal pressure will generate a reactive [[hoop stress]] on the wall, a normal tensile stress directed perpendicular to the cylinder axis and tangential to its surface.  The cylinder can be conceptually unrolled and analyzed as a flat thin rectangular plate subjected to tensile load in one direction and compressive load in another other direction, both parallel to the  plate.

==Plane strain (strain matrix)==
[[File:Plane strain.svg|600px|right|thumb|Figure 7.2 Plane strain state in a continuum.]]
{{main|Infinitesimal strain theory}}
If one dimension is very large compared to the others, the [[Strain (materials science)|principal strain]] in the direction of the longest dimension is constrained and can be assumed as zero, yielding a plane strain condition (Figure 7.2).  In this case, though all principal stresses are non-zero, the principal stress in the direction of the longest dimension can be disregarded for calculations. Thus, allowing a two dimensional analysis of stresses, e.g. a [[dam]] analyzed at a cross section loaded by the reservoir.

The corresponding strain tensor is:

: &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{ij} = \begin{bmatrix}
\varepsilon_{11} &amp; \varepsilon_{12} &amp; 0 \\
\varepsilon_{21} &amp; \varepsilon_{22} &amp; 0 \\
0      &amp;     0       &amp; \varepsilon_{33}\end{bmatrix}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

in which the non-zero &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{33}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; term arises from the [[Poisson's ratio|Poisson's effect]]. This strain term can be temporarily removed from the stress analysis to leave only the in-plane terms, effectively reducing the analysis to two dimensions.&lt;ref name=Meyers/&gt;

==Stress transformation in plane stress and plane strain==
Consider a point &lt;math&gt;P\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in a continuum under a state of plane stress, or plane strain, with stress components &lt;math&gt;(\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \tau_{xy})\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and all other stress components equal to zero  (Figure 8.1). From static equilibrium of an infinitesimal material element at &lt;math&gt;P\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (Figure 8.2), the normal stress &lt;math&gt;\sigma_\mathrm{n}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and the shear stress &lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{n}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; on any plane perpendicular to the &lt;math&gt;x\,\!&lt;/math&gt;-&lt;math&gt;y\,\!&lt;/math&gt; plane passing through &lt;math&gt;P\,\!&lt;/math&gt; with a unit vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf n\,\!&lt;/math&gt; making an angle of &lt;math&gt;\theta\,\!&lt;/math&gt; with the horizontal, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\cos \theta\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the direction cosine in the &lt;math&gt;x\,\!&lt;/math&gt; direction, is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_\mathrm{n} = \frac{1}{2} ( \sigma_x + \sigma_y ) + \frac{1}{2} ( \sigma_x - \sigma_y )\cos 2\theta + \tau_{xy} \sin 2\theta\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{n} = -\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_x - \sigma_y )\sin 2\theta + \tau_{xy}\cos 2\theta \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

These equations indicate that in a plane stress or plane strain condition, one can determine the stress components at a point on all directions, i.e. as a function of &lt;math&gt;\theta\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, if one knows the stress components &lt;math&gt;(\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \tau_{xy})\,\!&lt;/math&gt; on any two perpendicular directions at that point. It is important to remember that we are considering a unit area of the infinitesimal element in the direction parallel to the &lt;math&gt;y\,\!&lt;/math&gt;-&lt;math&gt;z\,\!&lt;/math&gt; plane.
[[File:Stress transformation 2D.svg|460px|left|thumb|Figure 8.1 - Stress transformation at a point in a continuum under plane stress conditions.]]
[[File:Stress at a plane 2D.svg|200px|none|thumb|Figure 8.2 - Stress components at a plane passing through a point in a continuum under plane stress conditions.]]

The principal directions (Figure 8.3), i.e., orientation of the planes where the shear stress components are zero, can be obtained by making the previous equation for the shear stress &lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{n}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; equal to zero. Thus we have:
:&lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{n} = -\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_x - \sigma_y )\sin 2\theta + \tau_{xy}\cos 2\theta=0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

and we obtain

:&lt;math&gt;\tan 2 \theta_\mathrm{p} = \frac{2 \tau_{xy}}{\sigma_x - \sigma_y}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

This equation defines two values &lt;math&gt;\theta_\mathrm{p}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; which are &lt;math&gt;90^\circ\,\!&lt;/math&gt; apart (Figure 8.3). The same result can be obtained by finding the angle &lt;math&gt;\theta\,\!&lt;/math&gt; which makes the normal stress &lt;math&gt;\sigma_\mathrm{n}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; a maximum, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\frac{d\sigma_\mathrm{n}}{d\theta}=0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The principal stresses &lt;math&gt;\sigma_1\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, or minimum and maximum normal stresses &lt;math&gt;\sigma_\mathrm{max}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_\mathrm{min}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, respectively, can then be obtained by replacing both values of &lt;math&gt;\theta_\mathrm{p}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; into the previous equation for &lt;math&gt;\sigma_\mathrm{n}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. This can be achieved by rearranging the equations for &lt;math&gt;\sigma_\mathrm{n}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{n}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, first transposing the first term in the first equation and squaring both sides of each of the equations then adding them. Thus we have

:&lt;math&gt;
\left[ \sigma_\mathrm{n} - \tfrac{1}{2} ( \sigma_x + \sigma_y )\right]^2 + \tau_\mathrm{n}^2 = \left[\tfrac{1}{2}(\sigma_x - \sigma_y)\right]^2 + \tau_{xy}^2 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
(\sigma_\mathrm{n} - \sigma_\mathrm{avg})^2 + \tau_\mathrm{n}^2 = R^2  \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;R = \sqrt{\left[\tfrac{1}{2}(\sigma_x - \sigma_y)\right]^2 + \tau_{xy}^2} \quad \text{and} \quad \sigma_\mathrm{avg} = \tfrac{1}{2} ( \sigma_x + \sigma_y )\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

which is the equation of a circle of radius &lt;math&gt;R\,\!&lt;/math&gt; centered at a point with coordinates &lt;math&gt;[\sigma_\mathrm{avg}, 0]\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, called [[Mohr's circle]]. But knowing that for the principal stresses the shear stress &lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{n} = 0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, then we obtain from this equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_1 =\sigma_\mathrm{max} = \tfrac{1}{2}(\sigma_x + \sigma_y) + \sqrt{\left[\tfrac{1}{2}(\sigma_x - \sigma_y)\right]^2 + \tau_{xy}^2}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_2 =\sigma_\mathrm{min} = \tfrac{1}{2}(\sigma_x + \sigma_y) - \sqrt{\left[\tfrac{1}{2}(\sigma_x - \sigma_y)\right]^2 + \tau_{xy}^2}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Principal stresses 2D.svg|400px|left|thumb|Figure 8.3 - Transformation of stresses in two dimensions, showing the planes of action of principal stresses, and maximum and minimum shear stresses.]]
{{Clear}}
When &lt;math&gt;\tau_{xy}=0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; the infinitesimal element is oriented in the direction of the principal planes, thus the stresses acting on the rectangular element are principal stresses: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_x = \sigma_1\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_y = \sigma_2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. Then the normal stress &lt;math&gt;\sigma_\mathrm{n}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and shear stress &lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{n}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; as a function of the principal stresses can be determined by making &lt;math&gt;\tau_{xy}=0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. Thus we have

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{n} = -\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_1 - \sigma_2 )\sin 2\theta\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Then the maximum shear stress &lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{max}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; occurs when  &lt;math&gt;\sin 2\theta = 1\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\theta = 45^\circ\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (Figure 8.3):

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{max} = \frac{1}{2}(\sigma_1 - \sigma_2 )\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Then the minimum shear stress &lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{min}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; occurs when  &lt;math&gt;\sin 2\theta = -1\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\theta = 135^\circ\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (Figure 8.3):

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{min} = -\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_1 - \sigma_2 )\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

'''Principled Distance''' is a new model of [[secularism]] given by [[Rajeev Bhargava]]. the separation of government institutions and persons [[Mandate (politics)|mandated]] to represent [[State (polity)|the state]] from [[Religious organization|religious institution]]s and [[Clergy|religious dignitaries]]. [[Rajeev Bhargava|He]] says that [[India]]n secularism did not erect a strict wall of separation, but proposed a 'principled distance' between religion and state.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opendemocracy.net/rajeev-bhargava/states-religious-diversity-and-crisis-of-secularism-0&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, by balancing the claims of individuals and religious communities, it never intended a bludgeoning privatization of religion. In India, secularism means equal treatment of all religions. Religion in India continues to assert its political authority in matters of personal law.&lt;ref&gt;http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/events/rethinking-secularism-refining-the-concepts-of-public-religions-principled-distance-and-the-twin-tolerations?q=Jos%C3%A9%20Casanova&lt;/ref&gt; The western model of secularism is criticized in India for being an outdated concept as Rajeev argued that since Western model was developed when society was more homogeneous but since in the era of globalization, society is becoming more heterogeneous therefore a new concept, suitable for the present situation, is needed. He even argued that since Europe itself is no more homogeneous hence West should also follow the principled distance model which on one hand respects the diversity and at the same time empowers the state to interfere in case of any discrimination in the name of religion.&lt;ref name="Rajeev"&gt;

The [[Haj subsidy]] is a subsidy given to [[Islam in India|Indian Muslim]] [[Hajj]] pilgrims by the Government of India.  The program has its origins in British colonial era. In post-colonial era, the [[Jawaharlal Nehru|Nehru]] government expanded the program in 1959 with the Hajj Act.&lt;ref name=ha1959&gt;[http://indiankanoon.org/doc/102428/ The Haj Committee Act, 1959] Government of India&lt;/ref&gt; The subsidy and taxpayer funded arrangements initially applied to Muslim Indian pilgrims traveling for religious reasons to Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iraq, Iran and Jordan. Since 1973, pilgrims applying through the [[Haj Committee of India]] are offered a concessionary fare on [[Air India]].&lt;ref name=facts&gt;Press Information Bureau, [http://www.indianmuslims.info/book/export/html/14454 "Hajj operation in India 2006"], December 2006.

[[Central Wakf Council, India]]  is an [[India]]n [[statutory body]] established in 1964 by the [[Government of India]] under Wakf Act, 1954 (now a sub section the Wakf Act, 1995) for the purpose of advising it on matters pertaining to working of the State Wakf Boards and proper administration of the [[Wakf]]s in the country. Wakf is a permanent dedication of movable or immovable properties for  religious, pious or charitable purposes as recognized by [[Muslim Law]], given by [[philanthropist]]s.

{{Sex and the law}}

'''Prostitution law''' varies widely from country to country, and between jurisdictions within a country. At one extreme, [[prostitution]] or [[sex trade|sex work]] is legal in some places and regarded as a [[profession]], while at the other extreme, it is a crime [[punishable by death]] in some other places.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uri.edu/artsci/wms/hughes/iran.htm |title=Iran – Facts on Trafficking and Prostitution |publisher=Uri.edu |accessdate=16 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008164248/http://www.uri.edu/artsci/wms/hughes/iran.htm |archivedate=8 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many jurisdictions, prostitution – the commercial exchange of sex for money, goods, service, or some other benefit agreed upon by the transacting parties – is [[Crime|illegal]], while in others it is [[legal]], but surrounding activities, such as soliciting in a public place, operating a [[brothel]], and [[pimping]], may be illegal. In many jurisdictions where prostitution is legal, it is regulated; in others it is unregulated. Where exchange of sex for money is criminalized, it may be the sex worker (most commonly), the client, or both, who are subject to prosecution.

Prostitution has been condemned as a single form of [[human rights]] abuse, and an attack on the dignity and worth of human beings, while other schools of thought state that sex work is a legitimate occupation; whereby a person trades or exchanges sexual acts for money and/or goods. Some believe that women in developing countries are especially vulnerable to [[sexual exploitation]] and [[human trafficking]], while others distinguish this practice from the global sex industry, in which "sex work is done by consenting adults, where the act of selling or buying sexual services is not a violation of human rights."&lt;ref name="Open"&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding Sex Work in an Open Society|url=http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/explainers/understanding-sex-work-open-society|website=Open Society Foundations|publisher=Open Society Foundations|accessdate=4 January 2014|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "sex work" is used interchangeably with "prostitution" in this article, in accordance with the World Health Organisation (WHO 2001; WHO 2005) and the United Nations (UN 2006; UNAIDS 2002).&lt;ref name="Ireland"&gt;{{cite web|title=FAQ |url=http://www.sexworkersallianceireland.org/frequently.html |website=Sex Workers Alliance Ireland |publisher=Sex Workers Alliance Ireland |accessdate=4 January 2014 |year=2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140118201244/http://www.sexworkersallianceireland.org/frequently.html |archivedate=18 January 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
In most countries, sex work is controversial. Members of certain religions oppose prostitution, viewing it as contrary or a threat to their moral codes, while other parties view prostitution as a "necessary evil". Sex worker activists and organizations believe the issue of sex worker human rights is of greatest importance, including those related to freedom of speech, travel, immigration, work, marriage, parenthood, insurance, health insurance, and housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Committee for Prostitutes' Rights: World Charter For Prostitutes' Rights|url=http://www.bayswan.org/ICPRChart.html|website=Prostitutes Education Network|publisher=Prostitutes Education Network|accessdate=4 January 2014|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some feminist organizations are opposed to prostitution, considering it a form of exploitation in which males dominate women, and as a practice that is the result of a patriarchal social order. For example, the [[European Women's Lobby]], which bills itself as the largest umbrella organization of women’s associations in the [[European Union]], has condemned prostitution as "an intolerable form of male violence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womenslobby.eu/spip.php?article472&amp;lang=en |title=European Women's Lobby Européen des femmes : Prostitution in Europe: 60 Years of Reluctance |publisher=Womenslobby.eu |date=1 December 2009|accessdate=16 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2014, the members of the European Parliament voted in a non-binding resolution, (adopted by 343 votes to 139; with 105 abstentions), in favor of the '[[Prostitution_in_Sweden#Current_legal_status|Swedish Model]]' of criminalizing the buying, but not the selling of sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/content/20140221IPR36644/html/Punish-the-client-not-the-prostitute |title=Punish the client, not the prostitute |publisher=Europarl.europa.eu |date= 2014-02-26|accessdate=2015-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the Council of Europe has made a similar recommendation, stating that "While each system presents advantages and disadvantages, policies prohibiting the purchase of sexual services are those that are more likely to have a positive impact on reducing trafficking in human beings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=MENDES BOTA |url=http://www.assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/XRef/Xref-DocDetails-EN.asp?fileid=20559&amp;wrqid=0&amp;wrqref=&amp;ref=1&amp;lang=EN |title=Parliamentary Assembly's Documents |publisher=Assembly.coe.int |date= |accessdate=2015-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womenlobby.org/spip.php?article6548&amp;lang=en |title=The EWL welcomes the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly's resolution on prostitution, trafficking and modern slavery in Europe - European Women's Lobby |publisher=Womenlobby.org |date= |accessdate=2015-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Wolfenden report|Wolfenden Committee Report]] (1957), which informed the debate in the United Kingdom, states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[the function of the [[criminal law]] is] to preserve public order and decency, to protect the citizen from what is injurious or offensive and to provide safeguards against the exploitation and corruption of others,&amp;nbsp;... It is not, in our view, the function of the law to intervene in the private lives of citizens, or to seek to enforce any particular code of behaviour, further than is necessary to carry out the purposes of what we have outlined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.glbtqarchive.com/ssh/wolfenden_report_S.pdf |title= Wolfenden Report |last= Summers |first= Claude J. |date= |website= GLBTQ |publisher= |access-date= 18 November 2017 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Views on what the best legal framework on prostitution should be are often influenced by whether one can view prostitution as morally acceptable or not; indeed [[Save the Children]] wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Save the Children Norway (Nepal) |url=http://www.savethechildren.net/nepal/key_issues/traffdefinition.html |title=Definition of Trafficking - Save the Children Nepal |date=2007-11-20 |accessdate=2015-09-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120150137/http://www.savethechildren.net/nepal/key_issues/traffdefinition.html |archivedate=20 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "The issue however, gets mired in controversy and confusion when prostitution too is considered as a violation of the basic human rights of both adult women and minors, and equal to sexual exploitation per se. From this standpoint then, trafficking and prostitution become conflated with each other."

In December 2012, UNAIDS, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, released the "Prevention and treatment of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections for sex workers in low- and middle- income countries" document that contains the following "Good practice recommendations":

*All countries should work toward decriminalization of sex work and elimination of the unjust application of non-criminal laws and regulations against sex workers.†
*Governments should establish antidiscrimination and other rights-respecting laws to protect against discrimination and violence, and other violations of rights faced by sex workers in order to realize their human rights and reduce their vulnerability to HIV infection and the impact of AIDS. Antidiscrimination laws and regulations should guarantee sex workers’ right to social, health and financial services.
*Health services should be made available, accessible and acceptable to sex workers based on the principles of avoidance of stigma, non-discrimination and the right to health.
*Violence against sex workers is a risk factor for HIV and must be prevented and addressed in partnership with sex workers and sex worker led organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New guidelines to better prevent HIV in sex workers|url=http://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/featurestories/2012/december/20121212sexworkguidance/|website=UNAIDS|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=4 January 2014|date=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal themes==
Legal themes tend to focus on four issues: [[victimization]] (including potential victimhood), ethics and [[morality]], [[freedom of choice|freedom of the individual]], and general benefit or harm to society (including harm arising indirectly from matters connected to prostitution).

===General===

Many people who support legal prostitution argue that prostitution is a consensual sex act between adults and a victimless crime, thus the government should not prohibit this practice.

Many anti-prostitution advocates hold that prostitutes themselves are often victims, arguing that prostitution is a practice which can lead to serious psychological and often physical long-term effects for the prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ruhama.ie/easyedit/files/Ruhama-NextStep-6.pdf |title=Next Step |website=Ruhama |accessdate=15 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410140946/http://www.ruhama.ie/easyedit/files/Ruhama-NextStep-6.pdf |archivedate=10 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prostitutionresearch.com/how_prostitution_works/000012.html |title=Prostitution Research &amp; Education Website |publisher=Prostitutionresearch.com |accessdate=16 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111074300/http://www.prostitutionresearch.com/how_prostitution_works/000012.html |archivedate=11 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/65/3/337#SEC2 |title=Arch Gen Psychiatry – Prevalence and Health Correlates of Prostitution Among Patients Entering Treatment for Substance Use Disorders, March 2008, Burnette et al. 65 (3): 337 |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |volume=65 |issue=3 |pages=337–44 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.65.3.337 |pmid=18316680 |accessdate=16 January 2012|year=2008 |last1=Burnette |first1=Mandi L |last2=Lucas |first2=Emma |last3=Ilgen |first3=Mark |last4=Frayne |first4=Susan M |last5=Mayo |first5=Julia |last6=Weitlauf |first6=Julie C }}&lt;/ref&gt; They may also argue that the act of prostitution is not by definition a fully consensual act, as they say that all prostitutes are "forced" to sell sex, either by somebody else or by the unfortunate circumstances of their lives (such as poverty, lack of opportunity, drug addiction, a history of childhood abuse or neglect, etc.).{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

In 1999, [[Sweden]] became the first country to [[Prostitution_in_Sweden#The_Kvinnofrid_law_.281999.29|make it illegal]] to pay for sex, but not to be a prostitute (the client commits a crime, but not the prostitute).

===Economic and health issues===

It is argued{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} that street prostitution is not victimless as it may damage the reputation and quality of life in the neighbourhood and diminish the value of property. [[Peter De Marneffe]] notes that many prostitutes have not finished school, affecting their ability to be able to have a career that they might have preferred. Therefore, prostitution also affects the application of their talent in other areas of the economy in which they can succeed.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}
Maxwell (2000) and other researcher have found substantial evidence that there is strong co-occurrence between prostitution, drug use, drug selling, and involvement in non-drug crimes, particularly property crime. Because the activity is considered criminal in many jurisdictions, its substantial revenues are not contributing to the tax revenues of the state, and its workers are not routinely screened for sexually transmitted diseases which is dangerous in cultures favouring unprotected sex and leads to significant expenditure in the health services. According to the ''Estimates of the costs of crime in Australia'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aic.gov.au/publications/tandi/ti39.pdf |title=Estimates of the Cost of Crime in Australia |accessdate=15 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051215122421/http://www.aic.gov.au:80/publications/tandi/ti39.pdf |archivedate=15 December 2005 |date=2018-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; there is an "estimated $96 million loss of taxation revenue from undeclared earnings of prostitution".
On top of these physical issues, it is also argued that there are psychological issues that prostitutes face from certain experiences and through the duration or repetition. Some go through experiences that may result "in lasting feelings of worthlessness, shame, and self-hatred".&lt;ref&gt;''Liberalism and Prostitution'' - Peter de Marneffe&lt;/ref&gt; De Marneffe further argues that this may affect the prostitute's ability to perform sexual acts for the purpose of building a trusting intimate relationship, which may be important for their partner. The lack of a healthy relationship can lead to higher divorce rates and can influence unhealthy relationship to their children, influencing their future relationships. Although this is more difficult to control by law, it should be considered when creating policies in protecting prostitutes' psychological health.{{According to whom|date=February 2017}}

Condom use is not always a part of sex work, and if sex work were legalized, this could change. By keeping prostitution illegal, there are no laws to govern how the work is performed. It is a well-known fact{{According to whom|date=February 2017}} that condoms help reduce the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, including AIDS. If prostitution was legalized, one of the laws could be the requirement of the use of condoms. It was reported in 2010 that out of eighty-six countries, only about twenty eight countries reported regular condom use in sex work ("sex workers").{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} If sex work was legalized, the amount of condom use would increase, leading to better protection for both the worker and the client.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Human trafficking===

{{Main|Human trafficking}} {{See also|Forced prostitution}}

The United Nations [[Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/33.htm|publisher=Office of the High Commissioner  for Human Rights|accessdate=10 April 2018 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090721162943/http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/33.htm |archive-date=21 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; favors criminalizing the activities of those seen as exploiting or coercing prostitutes (so-called "pimping" and "procuring" laws), while leaving sex workers free from regulation. The Convention states that "prostitution and the accompanying evil of the traffic in persons for the purpose of prostitution are incompatible with the dignity and worth of the human person".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/trafficpersons.htm |title=Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others |publisher=.ohchr.org |accessdate=16 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508080409/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/trafficpersons.htm |archivedate=8 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sigma Huda]], a UN special reporter on trafficking in persons said: "For the most part, prostitution as actually practiced in the world usually does satisfy the elements of trafficking. It is rare that one finds a case in which the path to prostitution and/or a person’s experience with prostitution does not involve, at the very least, an abuse of power and/or an abuse of vulnerability. Power and vulnerability in this context must be understood to include disparities based on gender, race, ethnicity and poverty. Put simply the road to prostitution and life within “the life” is rarely marked by empowerment or adequate options."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chaste.org.uk/public_documents/CJI_Briefing_Doc_CARE_CHASTE_001.pdf |title=Prostitution and Human Trafficking: Tackling Demand The Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill: A Briefing from CARE |accessdate=19 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305202011/http://www.chaste.org.uk/public_documents/CJI_Briefing_Doc_CARE_CHASTE_001.pdf |archivedate=5 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissuesmagazine.com/july08/july2008_5.php |title=Summer 2008: "It's Not TV, Its Sexploitation" Protest Against Home Box Office by Norma Ramos |publisher=On The Issues Magazine |accessdate=16 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, sex worker activists and organizations distinguish between human trafficking and legitimate sex work, and assert the importance of recognizing that trafficking is not synonymous with sex work. The Sex Workers Alliance Ireland organization explains: "victims of human trafficking may be forced to work in industries such as agriculture, domestic service as well as the sex industry. It is critical to distinguish human trafficking, which is a violation of human rights, from voluntary migration." The Open Society Foundations organization states: "sex work is done by consenting adults, where the act of selling or buying sexual services is not a violation of human rights. In fact, sex workers are natural allies in the fight against trafficking. The UNAIDS Guidance Note on HIV and Sex Work recognizes that sex worker organizations are best positioned to refer people who are victims of trafficking to appropriate services."&lt;ref name="Open" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ireland" /&gt;

According to a 2007 report by the UNODC ([[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]]), the most common destinations for victims of human trafficking are [[Thailand]], Japan, [[Israel]], Belgium, the [[Netherlands]], Germany, [[Italy]], Turkey, and the US.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6497799.stm |work=BBC News | title=UN highlights human trafficking | date=26 March 2007 | accessdate=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major sources of trafficked persons include Thailand, China, [[Nigeria]], Albania, [[Bulgaria]], Belarus, [[Moldova]], and [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

Researchers at Göteborg University released a report in 2010 that argued that prostitution laws affect trafficking flows.&lt;ref&gt;Jakobsson, Niklas and Andreas Kotsadam (2010).

===Legislation models===
NGOs, academics and government departments&lt;ref name="canada"&gt;{{cite web|title=Current Publications: Law, justice and rights: Prostitution:  A Review of Legislation in Selected Countries (PRB 03-29E)|url=https://lop.parl.ca/content/lop/ResearchPublications/prb0329-e.htm#Overview|website=Library of Parliament|accessdate=7 March 2018|language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; often categorise the approach to prostitution laws and approach into 5 models:

====Prohibitionism====
All aspects of prostitution are criminalised. Often the sex trade is seen as a violation of human dignity, moral or religious beliefs.&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt; e.g. [[Russia]]&lt;ref name="coe"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prostitution – which stance to take?|url=http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/XRef/X2H-Xref-ViewHTML.asp?FileID=11596&amp;Lang=EN|website=[[Council of Europe]]|accessdate=7 March 2018|date=9 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Also known as "criminalization".)&lt;ref name="All Women"/&gt;

====Abolitionism==== 
Whilst prostitution itself is legal, 3rd party involvement is generally prohibited. Solicitation is also often prohibited. Whilst this model recognises prostitutes may chose work in the trade, it is morally wrong. Laws are designed to stop prostitution impacting on the public.&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt; e.g. [[England]]&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt;

====Neo-abolitionism====
Neo-abolitionists believe there is no free choice for people entering prostitution, it violates their human rights and that prostitution is the sale and consumption of human bodies. Whilst prostitutes themselves commit no crime, clients and any third party involvement is criminalised.&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt; e.g. [[Sweden]]&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt; (Also called the "[[Prostitution_in_Sweden#Current_legal_status|Swedish model]]" or "Nordic model".)&lt;ref name="catwa"&gt;{{cite web|title=DEMAND CHANGE: UNDERSTANDING THE NORDIC APPROACH TO PROSTITUTION|url=http://www.catwa.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/NORDIC-MODEL-2017-booklet-FINAL-single-page.pdf|website=[[Coalition Against Trafficking in Women]] Australia |accessdate=7 March 2018|date=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lse"&gt;{{cite web|title=The 'Nordic model' of prostitution law is a myth|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2014/01/03/the-nordic-model-of-prostitution-law-is-a-myth/|website=[[London School of Economics]]|accessdate=7 March 2018|date=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legalization==== 
Whilst prostitution is not prohibited, there is legislation to control and regulate it.&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt; The extent and type of control varies from country to country and may be regulated by work permits, licensing or tolerance zones.&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt; e.g. The [[Netherlands]]&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt; (also called "regulationist".)&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt;

====Decriminalization====
{{main|Decriminalizing sex work}}
The decriminalization of sex work is the removal of criminal penalties for sex work.&lt;ref name="All Women"&gt;{{cite web|title=All Women, All Rights: Sex Workers Included |url=http://www.genderhealth.org/files/uploads/change/publications/All_Women_Alll_Rights_Sex_Workers_Included_Report.pdf |publisher=Center for Health and Gender Equity}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most countries, [[sex work]], the consensual provision of sexual services for money or goods,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Overs|first1=Cheryl|title=Sex Workers: Part of the Solution|url=http://www.who.int/hiv/topics/vct/sw_toolkit/115solution.pdf|website=World Health Organization|accessdate=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is criminalized. Removing criminal prosecution for sex workers creates a safer and healthier environment&lt;ref name="Aziza"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ahmed|first=Aziza|title=Feminism, power, and sex work in the context of HIV/Aids: consequences for women's health |url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/jlg/vol341/225-258.pdf |journal=Harvard Journal of Law and Gender|date=1 January 2011|volume=34|issue=1|page=225 |accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and allows them to live with less social exclusion and stigma. e.g. [[New Zealand]]&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt;

==Demographic impact==

===Gender===
Although prostitution is mainly performed by female prostitutes there are also [[Male prostitution|male]], [[transgender]] and [[transvestite]] prostitutes performing straight and/or gay sex work. In [[Vienna]], in April 2007, there were 1,352 female and 21 male prostitutes officially registered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://diestandard.at/2894105|title=Ohne Schutz als "neuer Kick"|trans-title=Without protection as "new Kick"|language=de|newspaper=Der Standard|location=Austria|date=24 May 2007|accessdate=9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of prostitutes who are not registered (and therefore work illegally) is not known. A recent study by [[TAMPEP]], on the prostitute population from Germany, estimated that 93% of prostitutes were female, 3% transgender and 4% male.&lt;ref name=tampep&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.amnestyforwomen.de/_notes/FInal%20Report%20TAMPEP%208%20BRD%202009.pdf |title=Final Report TAMPEP 8, Germany |work=[[TAMPEP]] reports |date=October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110301101214/http://www.amnestyforwomen.de/_notes/FInal%20Report%20TAMPEP%208%20BRD%202009.pdf |archivedate=1 March 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arrest statistics show that in those [[Sovereign state|states]] where buying and selling sex are equally illegal, the tendency is to arrest the service provider and not the customer, even though there are significantly more customers than sellers. Thus, it is a fact that more women than men are arrested, and the true extent of the crime is underreported. James (1982) reports that, in the United States, the arrest ratio of women to men was 3:2, but notes that many of the men arrested were the prostitutes rather than the clients.

===Developed vs. developing countries===
"By 1975, Thailand, with the help of World Bank economists, had instituted a National Plan of Tourist Development, which specifically underwrote the sex industry ... Without directly subsidising prostitution, the Act [the Entertainment Places Act] referred repeatedly to the personal services' sector. According to Thai feminist Sukyana Hantrakul, the law 'was enacted to pave the way for whorehouses to be legalised in the guise of massage parlours, bars, nightclubs, tea houses, etc." See Aarons Sach, "A prostitute at nine," The Times of India Sunday Review, 22 January 1995. With particular reference to children, the United Nations [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] creates specific obligations. Article 34 stipulates that:
:State Parties undertake to protect the child from all forms of sexual exploitation and sexual abuse. For these purposes, State Parties shall, in particular, take all appropriate national, bilateral, and multilateral measures to prevent:
::The inducement or coercion of a child to engage in any unlawful sexual activity.
::The exploitative use of children in prostitution or other unlawful sexual practices.
::The exploitative use of children in pornographic performances and materials.
As of 2000, twenty four countries had enacted legislation criminalising [[child sex tourism]], e.g. in Australia, the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Act 1994 covers a wide range of sexual activities with children under the age of 16 committed overseas. Laws with extraterritorial application are intended to fill the gap when countries are unwilling or unable to take action against known offenders. The rationale is that child-sex offenders should not escape justice simply because they are in a position to return to their home country. There is little research into whether the [[child sex tourism]] legislation has any real deterrent effect on adults determined to have sex with children overseas. It may be that these people are
simply more careful in their activities as a result of the laws. There are three obvious problems:
*the low level of reporting of sexual offences by child victims or their parents;
*the poverty which motivates the decision to survive economically through the provision of sexual services; and
*the criminal justice systems which, in the Third World country may lack transparency, and in the First World country may involve hostile and intrusive cross-examination of child witnesses with no adult witnesses to corroborate their evidence.

==Views of prohibitionists==
{{See also|Feminist views on prostitution|International Abolitionist Federation}}

In most countries where prostitution is illegal, the prohibition of the sex trade is subject to debate and controversy among some people and some organizations, with some voices saying that the fact that prostitution is illegal increases criminal activities and negatively affects the prostitutes.

Those who support prohibition or abolition of prostitution&lt;ref name="Lakeman"&gt;{{cite web | last = Lakeman | first = Lee | title = A feminist definition of abolition | url = http://www.rapereliefshelter.bc.ca/campaigns/abolition-prostitution/abolition-prostitution | date = 2008 | website = rapereliefshelter.bc.ca | publisher = [[Vancouver Rape Relief &amp; Women's Shelter]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that keeping prostitution illegal is the best way to prevent abusive and dangerous activities ([[child prostitution]], [[human trafficking]] etc.). They argue that a system which allows legalized and regulated prostitution  has very negative effects and does not improve the situation of the prostitutes; such legal systems only lead to crime and abuse: many women who work in licensed [[brothels]] are still controlled by outside [[pimps]]; many brothel owners are criminals themselves; the creation of a legal and regulated prostitution industry  only leads to another parallel illegal industry, as many women do not want to register and work legally (since this would rob them of their anonymity) and other women can not be hired by legal brothels because of underlying problems (e.g., [[drug abuse]]); legalizing prostitution  makes it more socially acceptable to buy sex, creating a huge demand for prostitutes (both by local men and by foreigners engaging in [[sex tourism]]) and, as a result, human trafficking and underage prostitution increase in order to satisfy this demand.&lt;ref name=Lakeman /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Farley | first = Melissa | author-link = Melissa Farley | title = Myths and facts about Nevada legal prostitution | url = http://prostitutionresearch.com/2009/02/23/myths-facts-about-nevada-legal-prostitution/ | publisher = [[Prostitution Research and Education (organization)|Prostitution Research]] | date = March 2009 }} [http://awakenreno.org/myths-and-facts-about-nevada-legal-prostitution/ Online.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Jeffreys | first = Sheila | author-link = Sheila Jeffreys | title = The legalisation of prostitution: a failed social experiment | url = http://sisyphe.org/article.php3?id_article=697 | website = Sisyphe.org | publisher = Sisyphe | date = 15 February 2004 |accessdate=16 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Hughes | first = Donna M. | author-link = Donna M.

A five-country survey of 175 men for the International Organisation for Migration found that 75% preferred female prostitutes aged 25 or under, and over 20% preferred those aged 18 or under, although "generally clients did not wish to buy sex from prostitutes they thought to be too young to consent to the sexual encounter."&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Anderson | first1 = Bridget | last2 = O'Connell Davidson | first2 = Julia | title = Is trafficking in human beings demand driven?

Some have argued that an extremely high level of violence is inherent to prostitution; they claim that many prostitutes have been the subject of violence, rape and coercion before entering prostitution including as children,&lt;ref name="Silbert and Pines"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Silbert | first1 = Mimi H. | last2 = Pines | first2 = Ayala M. | author-link1 = Mimi Silbert | title = Entrance into prostitution | journal = [[Youth &amp; Society]] | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 471–500 | doi = 10.1177/0044118X82013004005 | date = June 1982 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Silbert"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Silbert | first1 = Mimi H. | last2 = Pines | first2 = Ayala M. | last3 = Lynch | first3 = Teri | author-link1 = Mimi Silbert | title = Sexual assault of prostitutes: phase one | publisher = Delancey Street Foundation, National Institute of Mental Health | location = Washington D.C. | series = Grant No. RO1-MH-32782-01 | year = 1980 | oclc = 45111118 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that many young women and girls enter prostitution directly from state care in at least England, Norway, Australia and Canada.&lt;ref name="Coy"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Coy | first = Maddy | author-link = Maddy Coy | title = Young women, local authority care and selling sex: findings from research | journal = [[The British Journal of Social Work]] | volume = 38 | issue = 7 | pages = 1408–1424 | doi = 10.1093/bjsw/bcm049 | date = October 2008 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulated prostitution==
In some countries, (or administrative subdivisions within a country), prostitution is ''legal and regulated''. In these jurisdictions, there is a specific law, which explicitly allows the practice of prostitution if certain conditions are met (as opposed to places where prostitution is legal only because there is no law to prohibit it).

In countries where prostitution is regulated, the prostitutes may be registered, they may be hired by a brothel, they may organize trade unions, they may be covered by workers' protection laws, their proceeds may be taxable, they may be required to undergo regular health checks, etc. The degree of regulation, however, varies very much by jurisdiction.

Such approaches are taken with the stance that prostitution is impossible to eliminate, and thus these societies have chosen to regulate it in an attempt to increase [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]] and therefore reduce the more undesirable consequences.  Goals of such regulations include controlling [[sexually transmitted disease]], reducing sexual slavery, controlling where brothels may operate and dissociating prostitution from [[crime syndicate]]s.

In countries where prostitution is legal and regulated, it is usual for the practice to be restricted to particular areas.

In countries where prostitution itself is legal, but associated activities are outlawed, prostitution is generally ''not'' regulated.

===Mandatory health checks===
Not all countries with regulated prostitution require  mandatory health checks (because such checks are seen as too intrusive, a violation of human rights and a discriminatory policy, since the clients don't have to be subjected to them).{{cn|date=December 2017}}

A few jurisdictions, however, require that prostitutes undergo regular health checks for [[sexually transmitted disease]]s.

In [[Nevada]], state law requires that registered brothel prostitutes be checked weekly for several sexually transmitted diseases and monthly for HIV; furthermore, [[condom]]s are mandatory for all [[oral sex]] and [[sexual intercourse]]. Brothel owners may be held liable if customers become infected with HIV after a prostitute has tested positive for the virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.nv.us/nrs/NRS-041.html#NRS041Sec1397 |title=NRS 041.1397 |publisher=Leg.state.nv.us |accessdate=16 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prostitution outside the licensed brothels is illegal throughout the state; all forms of prostitution are illegal in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] (and [[Clark County, Nevada|Clark County]], which contains its metropolitan area), in [[Reno]] (and [[Washoe County, Nevada|Washoe County]]), in [[Carson City, Nevada|Carson City]], and in a few other parts of the state (currently 8 out of [[Nevada]]'s 16 counties have active brothels, see [[Prostitution in Nevada]]).

===Labour laws===

The regulation of prostitution is problematic because standard [[Labor laws|labor regulations]] cannot be applied to prostitution. The typical relation between employer and employee where the employer is in a position of authority over the employee is, in the case of prostitution, viewed by many as contrary to the physical integrity of the prostitute. It is forbidden to order a person to have sex on a given moment at a given place. Many sex operators also do not want to pay [[social security]] contributions, which comes with paid labor. Therefore, many prostitutes, in countries where prostitution is regulated, are officially listed as [[independent contractors]]. Sex operators typically operate as facilitators only and do not interfere with the prostitutes.

===Status of unregulated sex work===
The existence of regulated prostitution generally implies that prostitution is illegal outside of the regulated context. For example, Nevada has laws prohibiting the following: engagement in prostitution outside of licensed brothels, encouragement of others to become prostitutes, and living off the proceeds of a sex worker.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Demands to legalise prostitution as a means to contain exploitation in the sex industry is now gaining support from organisations such as the UN and the Supreme Court of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=K Rajasekharan|title=Legalise prostitution in India to address problems of sex industry|url=http://www.economylead.com/featured-news/legalise-prostitution-india-address-problems-sex-industry-13106|website=EconomyLead.com|publisher=EconomyLead.com|accessdate=30 December 2014|date=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Prostitution by region}}

Below there is a presentation of the legal status of prostitution around the world, as of May 2018

===Prohibitionism===

In these countries prostitution itself (exchanging sex for money) is illegal. The punishment for prostitution varies considerably: in some countries, it can incur the death penalty,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; in other jurisdictions, it is a crime punishable with a prison sentence, while in others it is a lesser administrative offense punishable only with a fine.

===Abolitionism===

In these countries, there is no specific law prohibiting the exchange of sex for money, but in general most forms of [[Procuring (prostitution)|procuring]] (pimping) are illegal. These countries also generally have laws against soliciting in a public place (e.g., a street) or advertising prostitution, making it difficult to engage in prostitution without breaking any law. In countries like [[India]], though prostitution is legal, it is illegal when committed in a [[hotel]].&lt;ref name="indiankanoon.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiankanoon.org/doc/139656816/ |title=Section 7 in The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956 |publisher=Indiankanoon.org |date= |accessdate=2015-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legalization===

In some countries, prostitution is legal and regulated; although activities like pimping and street-walking are generally illegal. The degree of regulation varies by country; for example, not all countries require mandatory health checks because such checks are seen{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} as intrusive, a violation of human rights and discriminatory.

==Enforcement==
The enforcement of the anti-prostitution laws varies from country to country or from region to region. In many places, there can be a discrepancy between the laws which exist on the books and what occurs in practice.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} For example, in [[Thailand]], prostitution is illegal, but in practice, it is tolerated and regulated. Such situations are common in many Asian countries.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

In areas where prostitution or the associated activities are illegal, prostitutes are commonly charged with crimes ranging from minor infractions such as [[loitering]] to more serious crimes like [[tax evasion]]. Their clients can also be charged with [[solicitation]] of prostitution.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13049">During the 1850s and 1860s, engineers carried out a piecemeal raising of the level of central [[Chicago]]. Streets, sidewalks, and buildings were physically raised on hydraulic jacks or [[Jack (device)#House jack|jackscrews]]. The work was funded by private property owners and public funds.

== Background ==

[[File:Ad with typos.jpg|thumb|392px|right|Advertisement in the ''Chicago Daily Tribune'', 1858.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1858_m01_d29 Chicago Daily Tribune, January 29, 1858]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

During the 19th century, the elevation of the Chicago area was not much higher than the shorelines of [[Lake Michigan]], so for many years there was little or no naturally occurring drainage from the city surface. The lack of drainage caused unpleasant living conditions, and standing water harbored pathogens that caused numerous epidemics. Epidemics including [[typhoid fever]] and [[dysentery]] blighted Chicago six years in a row culminating in the 1854 outbreak of [[cholera]] that killed six percent of the city’s population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1854_m07_d12 Chicago Daily Tribune, July 12, 1854]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#putnam_y1856_m06 Putnam’s Monthly Magazine, volume seven. (June 1856), page 610.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emmett Dedmon. Fabulous Chicago. Random House. 1953. Page 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bessie Louise Pierce, As Others See Chicago; Impressions of Visitors. University of Chicago Press. 1933, reprinted 2004. Page 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

The crisis forced the city's engineers and [[aldermen]] to take the drainage problem seriously and after many heated discussions&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1855_m05_d31 Chicago Daily Tribune, May 31, 1855]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1857_m04_d09_entry00 Chicago Daily Tribune, April 9, 1857]&lt;/ref&gt;—and following at least one false start—a solution eventually materialized. In 1856, engineer [[Ellis S. Chesbrough]] drafted a plan for the installation of a citywide sewerage system and submitted it to the Common Council, which adopted the plan. Workers then laid drains, covered and refinished roads and sidewalks with several feet of soil, and raised most buildings to the new grade with hydraulic jacks.

== Earliest raising of a brick building ==

In January 1858, the first [[masonry]] building in Chicago to be thus raised—a four-story, {{convert|70|ft|m|adj=on}} long, 750-ton brick structure situated at the north-east corner of [[Randolph Street (Chicago)|Randolph Street]] and Dearborn Street—was lifted on two hundred [[jackscrew]]s to its new grade, which was {{convert|6|ft|2|in|m}} higher than the old one, “without the slightest injury to the building.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1858_m01_d26 Chicago Daily Tribune, January 26, 1858]&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first of more than fifty comparably large masonry buildings to be raised that year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1859_m01_d01 Chicago Daily Press and Tribune, January 1, 1859]&lt;/ref&gt; The contractor was Bostonian engineer, James Brown, who went on to partner with longtime Chicago engineer James Hollingsworth; Brown and Hollingsworth became the first and, it seems, the busiest building raising partnership in the city. Before the year was out, they were lifting brick buildings more than {{convert|100|ft|m}} long,&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1858_m10_d04 Chicago Daily Press and Tribune, October 4, 1858]&lt;/ref&gt; and the following spring they took the contract to raise a brick block more than twice that length.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1859_m05_d05 The Press and Tribune (Chicago), May 5, 1859]&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Row on Lake Street ==
[[File:Street Raising on Lake Street.jpg|thumb|right|392px|Raising a block of buildings on Lake Street]]

By 1860, confidence was sufficiently high that a consortium of no fewer than six engineers—including Brown, Hollingsworth and [[George Pullman]]—took on one of the most impressive locations in the city and hoisted it up complete and in one go. They lifted half a city block on [[Lake Street (Chicago)|Lake Street]], between [[Clark Street (Chicago)|Clark Street]] and [[LaSalle Street]]; a solid masonry row of shops, offices, printeries, etc., {{convert|320|ft|m}} long, comprising brick and stone buildings, some four stories high, some five, having a footprint taking up almost {{convert|1|acre|m2|spell=in}} of space, and an estimated all in weight including hanging sidewalks of thirty five thousand tons. Businesses operating out of these premises were not closed down for the lifting; as the buildings were being raised, people came, went, shopped and worked in them as if nothing out of the ordinary were happening. In five days the entire assembly was elevated {{convert|4|ft|8|in|m}} in the air by a team consisting of six hundred men using six thousand jackscrews, ready for new [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation]] walls to be built underneath. The spectacle drew crowds of thousands, who were on the final day permitted to walk at the old ground level, among the jacks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1860_m03_d09 The Press and Tribune (Chicago), March 9, 1860]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1860_m03_d26 The Press and Tribune (Chicago), March 26, 1860]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1860_m03_d29 The Press and Tribune (Chicago), March 29, 1860]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1860_m04_d02 The Press and Tribune (Chicago), April 2, 1860]&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Tremont House ==

The following year a team led by Ely, Smith, and Pullman raised the [[Tremont House (Chicago)|Tremont House]] hotel on the south-east corner of Lake Street and Dearborn Street. This building was luxuriously appointed, was of brick construction, was six stories high, and had a footprint taking up over {{convert|1|acre|m2}} of space. Once again business as usual was maintained as this vast hotel parted from the ground it was standing on, and indeed some of the guests staying there at the time—among whose number were several [[Very Important Person|VIP]]s and a [[United States Senate|US Senator]]—were completely oblivious to the feat as the five hundred men operating their five thousand jackscrews worked under covered trenches. One patron was puzzled to note that the front steps leading from the street into the hotel were becoming steeper every day and that when he checked out, the windows were several feet above his head, whereas before they had been at eye level. This huge hotel, which until just the previous year had been the tallest building in Chicago, was in fact raised fully {{convert|6|ft|m}} without a hitch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1861_m01_d22 Chicago Daily Tribune, January 22, 1861]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1861_m01_d24 Chicago Daily Tribune, January 24, 1861]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1861_m02_d12 Chicago Daily Tribune, February 12, 1861]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1861_m02_d25 Chicago Daily Tribune, February 25, 1861]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1861_m02_d26_entry00 Chicago Daily Tribune, February 26, 1861 (01)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1861_m02_d26_entry01 Chicago Daily Tribune, February 26, 1861 (02)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1861_m02_d27 Chicago Daily Tribune, February 27, 1861]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1861_m03_d15 Chicago Daily Tribune, March 15, 1861]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1861_m07_d26 Chicago Daily Tribune, July 26, 1861]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Macrae, The Americans at Home: Pen-and-Ink Sketches of American Men, Manners and Institutions, Volume Two (of two), Edmonston &amp; Douglas, 1870, pages 190-193, and reprinted by Lost Cause Press, Louisville, 1964.[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#macrae_tremont]&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Robbins Building ==

Another notable feat was the raising of the Robbins Building, an [[Cast-iron architecture|iron building]] {{convert|150|ft|m}} long, {{convert|80|ft|m}} wide and five stories high, located at the corner of South Water Street and Wells Street. This was a very heavy building; its ornate iron frame, its twelve-inch (305&amp;nbsp;mm) thick masonry wall filling, and its “floors filled with heavy goods” made for a weight estimated at 27,000 tons, a large load to raise over a relatively small area. Hollingsworth and Coughlin took the contract and in November 1865 lifted not only the building but also the {{convert|230|ft|m}} of stone [[sidewalk]] outside it. The complete mass of iron and masonry was raised {{convert|27.5|in|m}}, “without the slightest crack or damage.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1865_m10_d31 Chicago Tribune, October 31, 1865]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1865_m11_d14 Chicago Tribune, November 14, 1865]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1865_m11_d17 Chicago Tribune, November 17, 1865]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1865_m11_d20 Chicago Tribune, November 20, 1865]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1865_m12_d12 The Times (London), December 12, 1865]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hydraulic raising of the Franklin House ==

There is evidence in primary document sources that at least one building in Chicago, the Franklin House on Franklin Street, was raised [[Hydraulics|hydraulically]] by the engineer John C. Lane,&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1860_m04_d30 The Press and Tribune (Chicago), April 30, 1860]&lt;/ref&gt; of the Lane and Stratton partnership. The team had apparently been using this method of lifting buildings in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] since 1853.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1859_m07_d14 The Press and Tribune (Chicago), July 14, 1859]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relocated buildings ==
[[File:Briggs house.jpg|thumb|right|392px|The Briggs House&amp;mdash;a brick hotel&amp;mdash;raised, probably in 1866.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1866_m02_d07 Chicago Tribune, February 7, 1866]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Many of central Chicago’s hurriedly-erected wooden [[Framing (construction)|frame buildings]] were now considered wholly inappropriate to the burgeoning and increasingly wealthy city. Rather than raise them several feet, proprietors often preferred to [[Structure relocation|relocate]] these old frame buildings, replacing them with new masonry blocks built to the latest grade. Consequently, the practice of putting the old multi-story, intact and furnished wooden buildings—sometimes entire rows of them ''en bloc''—on rollers and moving them to the outskirts of town or to the suburbs was so common as to be considered nothing more than routine traffic. Traveller David Macrae wrote incredulously, “Never a day passed during my stay in the city that I did not meet one or more houses shifting their quarters. One day I met nine. Going out [[Madison Street (Chicago)|Great Madison Street]] in the horse cars we had to stop twice to let houses get across.” As discussed above, business did not suffer; shop owners would keep their shops open, even as people had to climb in through a moving front door.&lt;ref&gt;David Macrae, The Americans at Home: Pen-and-Ink Sketches of American Men, Manners and Institutions, Volume Two (of two), Edmonston &amp; Douglas, 1870, pages 190-193, and reprinted by Lost Cause Press, Louisville, 1964.[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#macrae]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1856_m04_d18 Chicago Daily Tribune, April 18, 1856]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1858_m12_d20 Chicago Daily Press and Tribune, December 20, 1858]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1860_m03_d09_rotten_row Chicago Daily Press and Tribune, March 9, 1860]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1860_m04_d12 The Press and Tribune (Chicago), April 12, 1860]&lt;/ref&gt; Brick buildings also were moved from one location to another, and in 1866, the first of these—a building of two and a half stories—made the short move from Madison Street out to Monroe Street.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sedm1912/csc.html#y1866_m08_d09 Chicago Tribune, August 9, 1866]&lt;/ref&gt; Later, many other brick buildings were rolled much greater distances across Chicago.

In [[English language|English]]-speaking countries, the common verbal response to another person's [[sneeze]] is "[[bless you]]", or, less commonly in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], "Gesundheit", the [[German language|German]] word for health (and the response to sneezing in German-speaking countries).  There are several proposed [[Bless you#Origins and legends|bless-you origins]] for use in the context of sneezing.

In non-English-speaking cultures, words referencing good [[health]] or a long [[life]] are often used instead of "bless you," though some also use references to God.

In some Asian cultures such as Korean and Japanese cultures, the practice of responding to another person's sneeze does not exist.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7580">[[File:Protein Sequence space.png|thumb|600px|[[Protein]] sequence space can be represented as a space with n [[dimensions]], where n is the number of [[amino acid]]s in the protein. Each axis has 20 positions representing the 20 amino acids. There are 400 possible 2 amino acid proteins ([[dipeptide]]) which can be arranged in a 2D grid. the 8000 [[tripeptide]]s can be arranged in a 3D cube. Most proteins are longer than 100 amino acids and so occupy large, multidimensional spaces containing an astronomical number protein sequences.]]

In [[evolutionary biology]], '''sequence space''' is a way of representing all possible sequences (for a [[protein]], [[gene]] or [[genome]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=DePristo|first=Mark A.|author2=Weinreich, Daniel M. |author3=Hartl, Daniel L. |title=Missense meanderings in sequence space: a biophysical view of protein evolution|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|date=2 August 2005|volume=6|issue=9|pages=678–687|doi=10.1038/nrg1672|pmid=16074985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maynard Smith|first1=John|title=Natural Selection and the Concept of a Protein Space|journal=Nature|date=7 February 1970|volume=225|issue=5232|pages=563–564|doi=10.1038/225563a0|pmid=5411867|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v225/n5232/pdf/225563a0.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sequence space has one dimension per [[amino acid]] or [[nucleotide]] in the sequence leading to [[dimension|highly dimensional spaces]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bornberg-Bauer|first=E.|author2=Chan, H. S. |title=Modeling evolutionary landscapes: Mutational stability, topology, and superfunnels in sequence space|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=14 September 1999|volume=96|issue=19|pages=10689–10694|doi=10.1073/pnas.96.19.10689|pmc=17944}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cordes|first=MH|author2=Davidson, AR |author3=Sauer, RT |title=Sequence space, folding and protein design.|journal=Current Opinion in Structural Biology|date=Feb 1996|volume=6|issue=1|pages=3–10|pmid=8696970|doi=10.1016/S0959-440X(96)80088-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most sequences in sequence space have no function, leaving relatively small regions that are populated by naturally occurring genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hermes|first=JD|author2=Blacklow, SC |author3=Knowles, JR |title=Searching sequence space by definably random mutagenesis: improving the catalytic potency of an enzyme.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=Jan 1990|volume=87|issue=2|pages=696–700|pmid=1967829|pmc=53332|doi=10.1073/pnas.87.2.696}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each protein sequence is adjacent to all other sequences that can be reached through a single [[mutation]]. It has been estimated that the whole functional protein sequence space has been explored by life on the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/5/25/953&lt;/ref&gt; Evolution can be visualised as the process of sampling nearby sequences in sequence space and moving to any with improved [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] over the current one. 

==Representation==
A sequence space is usually laid out as a grid. For [[protein]] sequence spaces, each [[amino acid|residue]] in the protein is represented by a [[dimension]] with 20 possible positions along that axis corresponding to the possible amino acids.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Hence there are 400 possible [[dipeptide]]s arranged in a 20x20 space but that expands to 10&lt;sup&gt;130&lt;/sup&gt; for even a small protein of 100 amino acids arranges in a space with 100 dimensions. Although such overwhelming multidimensionality cannot be visualised or represented diagrammatically, it provides a useful abstract model to think about the range of proteins and [[evolution]] from one sequence to another.

These highly multidimensional spaces can be compressed to 2 or 3 dimensions using [[principal component analysis]]. A fitness landscape is simply a sequence space with an extra vertical axis of fitness added for each sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Romero|first=PA|author2=Arnold, FH |title=Exploring protein fitness landscapes by directed evolution.|journal=Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology|date=Dec 2009|volume=10|issue=12|pages=866–76|pmid=19935669|doi=10.1038/nrm2805|pmc=2997618}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functional sequences in sequence space==
Despite the diversity of protein superfamilies, sequence space is extremely sparsely populated by functional proteins. Most random protein sequences have no fold or function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keefe|first=AD|author2=Szostak, JW |title=Functional proteins from a random-sequence library.|journal=Nature|date=Apr 5, 2001|volume=410|issue=6829|pages=715–8|pmid=11287961|doi=10.1038/35070613|pmc=4476321}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[protein superfamily|Enzyme superfamilies]], therefore, exist as tiny clusters of active proteins in a vast empty space of non-functional sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stemmer|first=Willem P. C.|title=Searching Sequence Space|journal=Bio/Technology|date=June 1995|volume=13|issue=6|pages=549–553|doi=10.1038/nbt0695-549}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bornberg-Bauer|first=E|title=How are model protein structures distributed in sequence space?|journal=Biophysical Journal|date=Nov 1997|volume=73|issue=5|pages=2393–403|pmid=9370433|doi=10.1016/S0006-3495(97)78268-7|pmc=1181141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The density of functional proteins in sequence space, and the proximity of different functions to one another is a key determinant in understanding [[evolvability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bornberg-Bauer|first=E|author2=Huylmans, AK |author3=Sikosek, T |title=How do new proteins arise?|journal=Current Opinion in Structural Biology|date=Jun 2010|volume=20|issue=3|pages=390–6|pmid=20347587|doi=10.1016/j.sbi.2010.02.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degree of interpenetration of two [[neutral network (evolution)|neutral networks]] of different [[enzyme activity|activities]] in sequence space will determine how easy it is to evolve from one activity to another. The more overlap between different activities in sequence space, the more [[cryptic variation]] for [[promiscuous activity]] will be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wagner|first=Andreas|title=The origins of evolutionary innovations : a theory of transformative change in living systems|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford [etc.]|isbn=0199692599}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protein sequence space has been compared to the ''[[Library of Babel]]'' a theoretical library containing all possible books that are 410 pages long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arnold|first1=FH|title=The Library of Maynard-Smith: My Search for Meaning in the protein universe|journal=Advances in protein chemistry|date=2000|volume=55|pages=ix-xi|pmid=11050930}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ostermeier|first1=M|title=Beyond cataloging the Library of Babel.|journal=Chemistry &amp; Biology|date=March 2007|volume=14|issue=3|pages=237–8|pmid=17379136|doi=10.1016/j.chembiol.2007.03.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Library of Babel'', finding any book that made sense was impossible due to the sheer number and lack of order. The same would be true of protein sequences if it were not for natural selection, which has selected out only protein sequences that make sense. Additionally, each protein sequences is surrounded by a set of neighbours (point mutants) that are likely have at least some function.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19973">'''Sobhi R. Mahmassani''' ({{lang-ar|صبحي محمصاني}}, January 29, 1909 – September 10, 1986) was a Lebanese legal scholar, practising lawyer, judge, and political figure helped to build the legal and civic foundations of the then-nascent country of Lebanon, and whose writings on Islamic jurisprudence remain authoritative works on this topic for legal scholars and researchers.

== Personal life ==

Mahmassani was born in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]] to Rajab Mahmassani and Aisha Khoja.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} He and his three male and five female siblings pursued higher education.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} In 1940, he married Ismat Abdul Kader Inkidar, with whom he had four sons: Ghaleb (1941), Malek (1944), Maher (1947) and Hani (1956).{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

With the onset of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1975, Mahmassani struggled to maintain his professional activities in Lebanon and overseas as a legal consultant and international arbitrator.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} After 1983 his activities slowed down as he was diagnosed with [[lung cancer]], of which he died in Paris, where he was pursuing medical treatment, on September 10, 1986.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

== Education ==

Mahmassani commenced primary and high school education in Beirut during World War I at the Preparatory School of the Syrian Evangelical College (now known as [[International College, Beirut|International College]]), a preparatory school for the American University of Beirut.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} He graduated from the high school in 1924 with high marks, and was designated valedictorian of his class.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

He pursued legal studies at the law school of [[University of Lyon]] in France from which he graduated with a License en Droit (law degree) followed by a doctorate in law in 1932.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} He joined the school of law of the [[London University]] and obtained bachelors in law degree in English law in 1935. As a result, he was well-versed in both French (Latin) and Anglo-Saxon legal traditions.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

Mahmassani was fluent in Arabic, English and French; he also had a reading knowledge of German.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

== Legal career ==

Mahmassani started his judicial career in 1929, during the [[French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|French Mandate over Lebanon]], as a court clerk while he was still pursuing his higher education.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} He served as judge at progressively higher ranks in various locations of Lebanon until he became counselor at the mixed court of appeals in Beirut (in that period, higher courts were presided by French judges).{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} Following the independence of Lebanon, Mahmassani became president of the civil chamber of the court of appeals and cassation of Beirut, the then highest judicial instance in the country.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

Mahmassani took early retirement from his judicial career toward the end of 1946 to start a professional career as a lawyer.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

In early 1947, Mahmassani founded a law firm in Beirut and became an attorney.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} That career continued until his death in 1986.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} During that period, Mahmassani was appointed to lead a number of international arbitrations, some in highly visible cases.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/20692245?uid=3739560&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21102766952983 Arbitral tribunal: award in dispute between libyan american oil company (LIAMCO) and the government of the libyan arab republic relating to petroleum concessions] ''International Legal Materials'', Vol. 20(1), American Society of International Law, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biicl.org/files/3939_1977_liamco_v_libya.pdf Case summary: Libyan American Oil Company (LIAMCO) v The Libyan Arab Republic], in ''Damages in International Investment Law''. British Institute of International and Comparative Law, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public life and political career ==

The Mahmassani family is noted for its contributions to public life. On May 6, 1916 ([[Martyrs' Day (Lebanon and Syria)|Martyrs' Day]]), Sobhi's first cousins Mohammad and Mahmoud Mahmassani were publicly executed in what is now called [[Martyrs' Square, Beirut]] by [[Djemal Pasha|Jamal Pasha]], the Ottoman [[wāli]] of Greater Syria, because of their nationalist activities.

In 1944, Mahmassani was appointed as member of the Lebanese delegation to the founding of the [[Arab League]] in Alexandria, Egypt, in the capacity of legal advisor.

In 1945, he was appointed as member of the Lebanese delegation to the [[United Nations Conference on International Organization|founding of the United Nations]] in San Francisco, USA, in the capacity of legal advisor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unalebanon.org/UNALebanon/aboutus.html United Nations Association of Lebanon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304105142/http://www.unalebanon.org/UNALebanon/aboutus.html |date=2016-03-04 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; His role was recognized in a 2013 exhibition at the [[American University of Beirut]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://staff.aub.edu.lb/~webmgate/spring05/2.html Signs of Peace], ''Main Gate'', American University of Beirut, Spring 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
Mahmassani contributed to the modernization of Lebanese legislation and the creation of state institutions through his participation in the higher committee appointed for that purpose by President [[Fuad Chehab]] upon his election as President of the Republic in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lebanonwire.com/0805MLN/08052502AGC.asp |title=Profiles of Lebanon's presidents since independence |publisher=Lebanonwire.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120060845/http://lebanonwire.com/0805MLN/08052502AGC.asp |archivedate=2013-01-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[Lebanese general election, 1964]], Mahmassani was elected to a four-year term as member of the Lebanese Parliament representing the capital city Beirut.  He did not seek re-election.

In 1966, he was appointed minister of national economy in the Lebanese government presided by [[Abdallah El-Yafi]], a position he occupied until 1968.

== Academic career ==

In parallel with his professional legal and political careers, Mahmassani had an academic career that spanned from the late 1930s to the late 1970s.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

He joined the faculty of the [[American University of Beirut]] in 1936 and continued until 1964; over which period he taught several courses, namely Roman law, the laws of the Arab countries and Islamic law.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

Around the same time, Mahmassani also joined the faculty of the law school of [[Saint Joseph University]] in Beirut where he taught the comparative legal systems of the Arab countries.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

Mahmassani was a founder of the [[Lebanese University]] and its law school in the early 1960s; he was thus among its first professors teaching Islamic law.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

Mahmassani also joined the faculty of the law school of the [[Beirut Arab University]] when it opened its doors in Beirut.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

Finally, Mahmassani taught law courses at the Military Academy in Lebanon. During a certain period, Mahmassani was lecturing at five universities.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

As part of his academic career, Mahmassani visited a number of countries to give lectures as a visiting professor (such as in the US, the Netherlands, Egypt, Pakistan, Iran, Tunisia) or as participant in international conferences (such as in the US, France, Italy, Egypt, Iraq). In particular, in the summer of 1966, he gave a series of lectures at the [[Hague Academy of International Law]] on International law and relations in Islam.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

He was elected as a Member of the Arab Academies of Damascus, Cairo and Baghdad.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

As a scholar of [[Sharia|Islamic law]], Mahmassani was noted for being open-minded towards other cultures and faiths, and is frequently quoted in discussions of ''Liberal Islam''.&lt;ref&gt;Kurzman, C.

'''Stellar drift''', or the motion of stars, is a necessary result of the [[Special relativity#Lack of an absolute reference frame|lack of an absolute reference frame]] in special relativity.

Nothing in space stands still—more precisely, standing still is meaningless without defining what "still" means. Most [[galaxy|galaxies]] have been moving away ever since the [[Big Bang]], as explained by the [[metric expansion of space]]. Galaxy motion is also influenced by [[galaxy groups and clusters]]. Stars orbit moving galaxies, and they also orbit moving [[star cluster]]s and [[binary star|companion star]]s. Planets orbit their moving stars.

Stellar drift is measured by two components: [[proper motion]] (multiplied by distance) and [[radial velocity]]. Proper motion is a star's motion across the sky, slowly changing the shapes of [[constellation]]s over thousands of years. It can be measured using a telescope to detect small movements over long periods of time. Radial velocity is how fast a star approaches or recedes from us. It is measured using [[redshift]]. Both components are complicated by the Earth's orbit around the Sun, so the motions of stars are described relative to the Sun, not the Earth ([[Star#Kinematics|kinematics of stars]]).

==Background==
Increasing [[urbanization]] has caused problems with increased [[flash flooding]] after sudden rain. As areas of vegetation are replaced by concrete, [[asphalt]], or roofed structures, leading to [[impervious surface]]s, the area loses its ability to absorb rainwater. This rain is instead directed into surface water drainage systems, often overloading them and causing floods.

The idea behind SuDS is to try to replicate the drainage patterns of natural systems by using cost-effective solutions with low [[environmental impact]] to drain away dirty and [[surface water]] run-off through collection, storage, and cleaning before allowing it to be released slowly back into the environment, such as into water courses. This is to counter the effects of conventional drainage systems that often allow for flooding, [[pollution]] of the environment – with the resultant harm to wildlife – and [[groundwater contamination|contamination]] of [[groundwater]] sources used to provide drinking water. The paradigm of SuDS solutions should be that of a system that is easy to manage, requiring little or no energy input (except from environmental sources such as sunlight, etc.), resilient to use, and being environmentally as well as aesthetically attractive. Examples of this type of system are basins (shallow landscape depressions that are dry most of the time when it's not raining), [[rain garden]]s (shallow landscape depressions with shrub or herbaceous planting), [[Swale (landform)|swales]] (shallow normally-dry, wide-based ditches), filter drains (gravel filled trench drain), bioretention basins (shallow depressions with gravel and/or sand filtration layers beneath the growing medium), reed beds and other [[wetland]] habitats that collect, store, and filter dirty water along with providing a habitat for wildlife.

Originally the term SUDS described the UK approach to sustainable urban drainage systems. These developments may not necessarily be in "urban" areas, and thus the "urban" part of SuDS is now usually dropped to reduce confusion. Other countries have similar approaches in place using a different terminology such as '''[[Best management practice for water pollution|best management practice]]''' (BMP) and '''[[Low-impact development (Canada/US)|low-impact development]]''' in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Washington, DC (2006). [http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/stormwater/menuofbmps/index.cfm?action=factsheet_results&amp;view=specific&amp;bmp=124 "Fact Sheet: Low Impact Development and Other Green Design Strategies."] 2006-06-01.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[water-sensitive urban design]] in Australia .

SuDS use the following techniques:
* source control
* [[permeable paving]] such as [[pervious concrete]]
* storm water [[detention basin|detention]]
* storm water [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]]
* [[transpiration|evapo-transpiration]] (e.g. from a [[green roof]])

A common misconception of SuDS is that they reduce flooding on the development site. In fact the SuDS is designed to reduce the impact that the surface water drainage system of one site has on other sites.  For instance, sewer flooding is a problem in many places. Paving or building over land can result in flash flooding. This happens when flows entering a sewer exceed its capacity and it overflows. The SuDS system aims to minimise or eliminate discharges from the site, thus reducing the impact, the idea being that if all development sites incorporated SuDS then urban sewer flooding would be less of a problem. Unlike traditional urban [[stormwater]] drainage systems, SuDS can also help to protect and enhance ground water quality.

==History==
The first sustainable drainage system to utilise a full management train including source control in the UK was [[Oxford services]] designed by Robert Bray Associates, specialist SuDS consultants.&lt;ref&gt;CIRIA [http://www.susdrain.org/case-studies/case_studies/welcome_break_wheatley.html Oxford Motorway Services Case Study]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sustainable redevelopment''' is the [[doctrine]] within which a state, organization, or individual can work to recreate a [[Socio-economic status|socio-economic position]] attained prior to a deconstructive event while upholding sustainable and environmental practices. The doctrine is based on [[economics]] within [[environmentalism]]. Typically, by providing more upfront capital, one can create a system that is less energy intensive, less wasteful, and generally less expensive to maintain in the long run.&lt;ref name="DFD"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/dsd/dsd/dsd_index.shtml |title=Division for Sustainable Development :: About |author=[[United Nations]] |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=6 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By redeveloping sustainably, long term [[energy conservation|energy efficiencies]] can be realized, coupled with highly reduced [[greenhouse gas emissions]].

Within the ideals of [[nation-building]], sustainable redevelopment can take up a greater significance. Post-[[disaster]] countries are in a unique situation to deal with these systems of ideals. Within this context, the idea behind initiating post-trauma sustainable redevelopment is that the underlying [[infrastructure]] is destroyed or damaged, therefore the situation is ideal for realizing the opportunities inherent to the situation.

==Background==
[[Sustainable development]] and [[redevelopment]] are closely linked, and several organizations have been implicitly involved with sustainable development. This type of development, in contrast to redevelopment, is not different other than the application to a specified problem. Sustainable development, is a form of development that coexists with existing forms of development.

While the systems for recreation on a small/local level are not universally widespread, there are several institutions which engage in sustainable development, that can theoretically be carried over to redevelopment. The [[Kyoto Protocol]]'s 12th Article&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/mechanisms/clean_development_mechanism/items/2718.php |title=Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)  |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=6 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  speaks to "flexible mechanisms". These mechanisms allow countries which have ratified the Kyoto Protocol to lower their overall emissions through the most economical means, respective, of course, to that country. Theoretically, these mechanisms could be directed towards post-traumatic redevelopment.

==UN==
The United Nations Division for Sustainable Development "provides [[leadership]] and is an authoritative source of expertise within the United Nations system on sustainable development".&lt;ref name="DFD"/&gt; The Division for Sustainable Development has been essential in the creation of such policies as [[Agenda 21]], and the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation.&lt;ref name="DFD"/&gt;

The [[United Nations]] declares that "Sustainable reconstruction management provides numerous environmental, safety and financial benefits."&lt;ref name="DFD"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12099">[[Image:ESAG office.jpg|thumb|alt=neo-classical house at Eretria|The Swiss School house at Eretria]]
The '''Swiss School of Archaeology in Greece''' ([http://www.esag.swiss ESAG]) ({{lang-fr|École Suisse d'Archéologie en Grèce}}; {{lang-de|Schweizer Archäologische Schule in Griechenland}}; {{lang-it|Scuola Elvetica d'Archeologia in Grecia}}; {{lang-el|Ελβετική Αρχαιολογική Σχολή στην Ελλάδα}}) is one of the [[List of Foreign Archaeological Institutes in Greece|foreign archaeological institutes]] operating in [[Greece]]. 
Since 1964, the Swiss archaeologists have been excavating the remains of the ancient site of [[Eretria]] ([[Euboea]]), a medium-sized city which has extensively contributed to the development and the influence of the Greek civilisation. Hosted in [[Switzerland]] by the [[University of Lausanne]], the Swiss School has its head office in [[Athens]], in an Art Nouveau building at Odos Skaramanga 4B. The school has also offices in a 19th-century neoclassical house in Eretria, Odos Apostoli 15.

== History ==

Swiss archaeologists started to work in [[Euboea]] in April 1964, but the Greek Archaeological Council had already accepted the principle of Swiss participation in the excavation and study of the ruins of [[Eretria]] in 1962. 
Vasilis Petrakos, who was then the epimelete in charge of Eretria, had drawn the attention of the Greek archaeological authorities to the threat to Eretria's ancient remains posed by the development of the small modern town. In fact, no other foreign archaeological team had been involved in studying the site since 1895, when the [[American School of Classical Studies at Athens]] completed its work. 
In 1975, after the end of the rule of the [[Greece|military junta]] (1967–1974), the Swiss Mission requested and received the title, habitual in Greece, of "School of Archaeology". 
The activities of the Swiss School of Archaeology in Greece in Eretria are multiple: they include the exploration of the city's past by the excavation of its ruins, the study of the material discovered, the publication of research, the preservation of archaeological remains in the field and in the Museum, and their development and presentation to the public.

== A few milestones ==
[[Image:Heroon.jpg|thumb|alt=Eretria geometric heroon|The geometric Heroon]]

The forty years of Swiss archaeological excavations in [[Eretria]] (1964–2004) can be divided into three phases. 
The first phase, which extends from the beginning until 1982, is that of the great discoveries: the rich necropolis from the [[Geometric Period]] ([[Heroon]]), the structures predating the temple of [[Apollo]] Daphnephoros uncovered under the foundations of the 6th century BC temple, and the sumptuous dwellings of the [[Classical antiquity|Classical]]-[[Hellenistic Period]], including the [http://www.unil.ch/esag/page20777_en.html House of the Mosaics]. 
The second phase, from 1982 to 1995, is that of consolidation, research on the material excavated, and finally a more moderate extension of the terrain (the West Quarter, the North Gymnasium, the acropolis, the Sacrificial area north of the Sanctuary of Apollo). 
The third phase (1996–2009) is marked by a new spurt of excavation activity with the exploration of a sector located not far from the House of the Mosaics, which led to the discovery of the Industrial Quarter as well as remains going back to the second millennium BC.

== Funding research ==

During the first eighteen years of its existence (1964–1982), the Swiss School of Archaeology in Greece, relied on the [[Swiss National Science Foundation]] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20101101112619/http://www.snf.ch/E/pages/default.aspx SNF)] as the sole source of financial support for its activities. 
Created in 1983, the "Foundation of the Swiss School of Archaeology in Greece" assumed responsibility for high-level administration and for seeking indispensable financial income from various donors: patrons, foundations, industries and companies, Swiss universities, and the Swiss Academy of Human and Social Sciences ([http://www.sagw.ch/sagw.html SAGW)]. 
The [[University of Lausanne]] ([http://www.unil.ch/index.html UNIL)], which has served as the Foundation's headquarters in [[Switzerland]] since 1982, plays a crucial role in its organization. 

== Research and training ==

Thanks to the excavations it has conducted and the research it has organized -from the study of the data gathered in the field to their publication- the Swiss School of Archaeology in Greece provides a valuable framework for cultural exchange: many professors, doctoral candidates, advanced students, and interns from Swiss universities have in fact taken part in the activities of the School and in the study of [[Eretria]]'s past. It is clear that much remains to be discovered. Only a tiny part of ancient Eretria has been excavated, while the materials deposited in the Museum and the documentation of older excavations have not yet yielded all the information they hold. In the years to come, we hope to learn more about the beginnings of the city and about the occupation of the territory, to cite only a few of the research projects underway. 
All the projects are subject to the authorization of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20081220075235/http://www.culture.gr/war/index_en.jsp Greek government's Ministry of Culture], and the provision of advance notice to the Ephorate of Euboean Antiquities, which is also responsible for overseeing the activities.

== Restoration, preservation, and publications ==
[[Image:Theatre3.jpg|thumb|alt=aerial view of the ancient theater at Eretria|The theater]]

The School has conceived, financed and carried out the expansion of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20071025041553/http://www.unil.ch/esag/page27319.html archaeological Museum], as well as the construction of a pavilion to protect and display the mosaics of the [http://www.unil.ch/esag/page20777_en.html House of the Mosaics] (1987–1991). It preserves and maintains the archaeological remains it excavates. It has proposed various projects for the preservation and presentation of the [http://www3.unil.ch/esag/theater/www.easyknow.ch/eretria/files/home.html Theater]. 
The results of its investigations are published annually in the Swiss journal [https://web.archive.org/web/20090331162227/http://www.antikekunst.ch/index.php?lang=en Antike Kunst] and summaries appear in the series [https://web.archive.org/web/20090825141124/http://www.unil.ch/esag/page20444_en.html Eretria, Excavations and Researches] (20 volumes published to date). Eretria has continued to provide numerous subjects for articles, books and university dissertations.

== Archaeology and modern urban development ==

From the outset, the School has taken an interest in the origins of the modern town of [[Eretria]]. In 1974‒75, a team from the [[Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich]] drew up a map showing numerous [http://www.unil.ch/esag/page38793.html 19th-century houses] and proposed that they be preserved. A project was submitted to municipal and governmental authorities, and then presented in two exhibitions, one in Eretria, the other in [[Athens]]. 
The creation of an archaeological zone in the region between the Temple of [[Apollo]] Daphnephoros and the House of the Mosaics, which constituted an important part of the 1975 project, has sporadically inspired interest. 
In 1998, the Swiss School gave a new impulse to studies on modern and contemporary Eretria that led to the publication of a book. 
In terms of specific accomplishments, the School has restored a 19th-century house that belonged to Admiral Nikodimos, one of the heroes of the [[Greek War of Independence]], and also established its headquarters in Eretria.

In the [[common law]] tradition, '''testamentary capacity''' is the [[law|legal]] [[term of art]] used to describe a person's legal and mental ability to make or alter a valid [[will (law)|will]].  This concept has also been called '''sound mind and memory''' or '''disposing mind and memory'''.

==Presumption of capacity==
Adults are [[presumption|presumed]] to have the ability to make a will.  [[Litigation]] about testamentary capacity typically revolves around charges that the [[testator]], by virtue of [[senility]], [[dementia]], [[insanity]], or other unsoundness of mind, lacked the mental capacity to make a will. In essence, the doctrine requires those who would challenge a validly executed will to demonstrate that the testator did not know the consequence of his or her conduct when he or she executed the will. 

Certain people, such as [[minor (law)|minors]], are usually deemed to be conclusively incapable of making a will by the common law; however, minors who serve in the [[military]] are conceded the right to make a will by [[statute]] in many jurisdictions. In [[South Africa]], however, one acquires testamentary capacity at the age of 16 years.

==Requirements==
The requirements for testamentary capacity are minimal. Some courts have held that a person who lacked the [[capacity (law)|capacity]] to make a [[contract]] can nevertheless make a valid will.  While the wording of statutes or judicial rulings will vary from one jurisdiction to another, the test generally requires that the testator was aware of:
# The extent and value of their property.
# The persons who are the natural beneficiaries
# The disposition he is making
# How these elements relate to form an orderly plan of distribution of property.&lt;ref&gt;Jesse Dukeminier &amp; Stanley M. Johanson, ''Wills, Trusts &amp; Estates'', Sixth Edition, Aspen Publishers, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Sound Mind and Memory - What Does this Phrase Mean?" from [http://courts.co.calhoun.mi.us/quest030.htm The Calhoun County, Michigan state government website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916184738/http://courts.co.calhoun.mi.us/quest030.htm |date=2008-09-16 }}.

The legal test implies that a typical claimant in a [[will contest]] is a disgruntled [[heir]] who believes he or she should have received a larger share than they did under the will. Once the challenging party meets the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] that the testator did not possess the capacity, the burden subsequently shifts to the party propounding the will to show by [[clear and convincing evidence]] that the testator did have the requisite capacity.

==Proof of testamentary capacity==
Those who [[Will contest|contest a will]] for lack of testamentary capacity must typically show that the decedent suffered from mental unsoundness that left them unable to remember family members or caused them to hold [[insane delusion]]s about them.&lt;ref&gt;Addington v. Wilson, 5 Blackf. (Ind.) 137, 61 Am.Dec. 81 (Sup. Ct. Ind. 1854)&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Dead Man's Statute]]s sometimes restrict [[evidence (law)|evidence]] which can be admitted concerning transactions with the decedent. &lt;ref name="in1"&gt;Hays v. Harmon, 809 N.E.2d 460 (Ind. Ct. App., 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

The best known or most authoritative text on the common law test for capacity is the judgment of Martin Nourse QC (who was then sitting as a deputy judge of the High Court and later became a Lord Justice of Appeal)in'' Re Beaney'', deceased &lt;ref&gt;[1978] 2 All ER 595, 601, WLR 770.&lt;/ref&gt;
When someone gives away a substantial proportion of their assets, the general rule is that they must have the same degree of capacity as is required for a will.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCOP/2014/15.html[para 43]&lt;/ref&gt;
"The degree or extent of understanding required in respect of any instrument is relative to the particular transaction which it is to effect. In the case of a will the degree required is always high. In the case of a contract, a deed made for consideration or a gift inter vivos, whether by deed or otherwise, the degree required varies with the circumstances of the transaction. Thus, at one extreme, if the subject-matter and value of a gift are trivial in relation to the donor's other assets a low degree of understanding will suffice. But, at the other, if its effect is to dispose of the donor's only asset of value and thus for practical purposes to pre-empt the devolution of his estate under his will or on his intestacy, then the degree of understanding required is as high as that required for a will, and the donor must understand the claims of all potential donees and the extent of the property to be disposed of."

[[Lawyer]]s for people whose testamentary capacity might be called into question often arrange for a will execution to be [[video tape]]d. On video, they ask the testator about his property and about his family, and go over the contents of the testator's will.

Along with resolving an examinee's testamentary capacity, a [[forensic psychiatry|forensic specialist]] observes for signs of undue influence by a concerned party that exploits an emotionally vulnerable individual who might otherwise be cognitively intact. The testamentary capacity matter is most frequently raised posthumously, when an aggrieved heir contests the will entered into probate. For this reason, the [[forensic psychiatrist]] or [[forensic psychologist]] studies the testatrix’ cognition through videotape record of the drafting of the will, or by reviewing email, letters and other records. &lt;ref name="in1" /&gt;

Even when a testator are found to have lacked testamentary capacity due to [[senility]], [[Memory and aging|loss of memory due to the aging process]], [[Mental illness|infirmity]] or [[insanity]], courts will sometimes rule that the testator had a "temporary period of lucidity" or a "lucid moment" at the time of the execution of the testamentary instrument. Such finding will validate a will that would otherwise be denied probate.

A way to forestall a will contest would be to have a self-proving will, in which an [[affidavit]] of the [[witness]]es to the will specifically swear or affirm that the will was prepared under the supervision of an attorney.

===Testamentary capacity in England and Wales===
The presumption of capacity
Where a will is rational, professionally drawn, seemingly regular in form and is made by a person whose capacity is not in doubt, there is a presumption that the will is valid.   This presumption can be rebutted by a challenger to the will showing that there is a real doubt about capacity.   At this point the burden of proving capacity moves to the propounder of the will to then show that there was testamentary capacity at the time the will was executed.&lt;small&gt;[7]&lt;/small&gt; 

Testamentary capacity
Testamentary capacity is the mental capacity required to make a valid will.    The current test comes from the decision in Banks v Goodfellow (1870).&lt;small&gt;[8]&lt;/small&gt;   This case concerned the validity of the will of John Banks.  In modern terms he would most likely be described as a paranoid schizophrenic.  He suffered from delusions that he was being persecuted by devils (they were sometimes visible to him) and also by a deceased local grocer.   His will was challenged on the basis that he was insane and therefore unable to make a will.&lt;small&gt;[9]&lt;/small&gt;   The will was found to be valid after trial by jury, before Brett J, at Cumberland Spring Assizes in 1869.  On appeal, this judgment was confirmed unanimously by a panel of four appeal judges in Queen's Bench.   The will was found to be valid, not influenced by his delusions, and deemed rational, being in favour of his only close relative (who also lived with him).   
In a strong and eloquent judgment, Cockburn CJ set out the following test of the capacity to make a valid will, which still applied in many Anglophone jurisdictions today:
“It is essential to the exercise of such a power that a testator shall understand the nature of the act and its effects; shall understand the extent of the property of which he is disposing; shall be able to comprehend and appreciate the claims to which he ought to give effect; and, with a view to the latter object, that no disorder of the mind shall poison his affections, pervert his sense of right, or prevent the exercise of his natural faculties—that no insane delusion shall influence his will in disposing of his property and bring about a disposal of it which, if the mind had been sound, would not have been made.” &lt;small&gt;[10]&lt;/small&gt;   
This remains the test today, notwithstanding the Mental Capacity Act 2005.&lt;small&gt;[11]&lt;/small&gt;
It is now considered as being composed of four distinct elements and that understanding is required of
[1] the nature of the act of making a will and its effect
[2] the extent of the property that is to be disposed of
[3] the claims of family or friendship to which he ought to give effect
and as a separate element&lt;small&gt;[12]&lt;/small&gt;  
[4] that no disorder of the mind shall poison his affections, pervert his sense of right, or prevent the exercise of his natural faculties—that no insane delusion shall influence his will in disposing of his property and bring about a disposal of it which, if the mind had been sound, would not have been made.
In addition, the original wording, [1], [2] and [3] are all approached as not requiring actual understanding, but instead being capable of understanding .&lt;small&gt;[13]&lt;/small&gt;
As this is a common law test created by judges, it is capable of being modified by judges, as they see fit in the light of modern circumstances.   Modern psychiatric knowledge has allowed the test to be developed by having a further element added and that is for the testator to be capable of exercising his decision-making powers.&lt;small&gt;[14]&lt;/small&gt; 
This test is focussed on the ability of the particular individual and his particular estate.  The outcome is always unique to the particular facts.  Where the circumstances and assets of a testator are simple or straightforward the level of capacity required will be lower than that for the testator with complex circumstances and assets.&lt;small&gt;[15]&lt;/small&gt; 

A court administered test
The test in Banks v Goodfellow has proved to be long lasting as it was not a definition in medical terms, but a plain English definition of what a person should be capable of understanding in order to make a will.  The test is still applied by a court.  A medical opinion, while being potentially valuable evidence, is not determinative of capacity unless accepted as such by the court.&lt;small&gt;[16]&lt;/small&gt;   The evidence of the will draftsman has considerable value to the court,&lt;small&gt;[17]&lt;/small&gt;  if he has carried out his work to an acceptable standard.&lt;small&gt;[18]&lt;/small&gt; 

The test for wills distinguished from other tests of capacity
The test in Banks v Goodfellow is expressly designed for the capability of a person to make a will.   It is not therefore a test that has an application to any other transactions, save one – the capacity to make substantial lifetime gifts.    The leading English decision in this area is Re Beaney (deceased)&lt;small&gt;[19]&lt;/small&gt;  where it was said:
“In the circumstances, it seems to me that the law is this.   The degree or extent of understanding required in respect of any instrument is relative to the particular transaction which it is to effect.&lt;small&gt;[20]&lt;/small&gt;     In the case of a will the degree required is always high.  In the case of a contract, a deed made for consideration or a gift inter vivos, whether by deed or otherwise, the degree required varies with the circumstances of the transaction.   Thus, at one extreme, if the subject matter and value of a gift are trivial in relation to the donor’s other assets a low degree of understanding will suffice.   But, at the other extreme, if its effect is to dispose of the donor’s only asset of value and thus, for practical purposes, to pre-empt the devolution of his estate under his will or on his intestacy, then the degree of understanding required is as high as that required for a will, and the donor understands the claims of all potential donees and the extent of the property to be disposed of.”

The test in a modern context
The increasing longevity of individuals means that there is a greater chance of any person losing the capacity to make a will in their old age as a result of dementia.  Indeed, dementia is the commonest reason for a will to be challenged, although any mental disorder may cause loss of capacity.   This presents a major issue for the will draftsman who is not only required to have a knowledge of the legal test of capacity, but also of what its implications are, in order to record his relevant observations of the testator and form an opinion of his client's capacity.   This, coupled with much greater prominence of negligence claims against will draftsmen,&lt;small&gt;[21]&lt;/small&gt; means that a careful understanding of what the draftsman should be doing becomes vital.

'''Tolerable weekly intake''' (TWI) estimates the amount per unit body weight of a potentially harmful substance or contaminant in food or water that can be ingested over a lifetime without risk of adverse health effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = IUPAC Glossary of Terms Used in Toxicology, 2nd Edition – Terms Starting with T|url = http://sis.nlm.nih.gov/enviro/iupacglossary/glossaryt.html|website = sis.nlm.nih.gov|accessdate = 2015-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Estimation of Seasonal Risk Caused by the Intake of Lead, Mercury and Cadmium through Freshwater Fish Consumption from Urban Water Reservoirs in Arid Areas of Northern Mexico|journal = International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|date = 2015-02-01|issn = 1661-7827|pmc = 4344694|pmid = 25658686|pages = 1803–1816|volume = 12|issue = 2|doi = 10.3390/ijerph120201803|first = Myrna|last = Nevárez|first2 = Luz O.|last2 = Leal|first3 = Myriam|last3 = Moreno}}&lt;/ref&gt; TWI is generally preceded by "provisional" to indicate insufficient data exists, increasing uncertainty.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Background to the ADI/TDI/PTWI|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273230099913351|journal = Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology|date = 1999-10-01|pages = S109-S113|volume = 30|issue = 2|doi = 10.1006/rtph.1999.1335|first = J. L.|last = Herrman|first2 = M.|last2 = Younes}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The term TWI should be reserved for when there is a well-established and internationally accepted tolerance, backed by sound and uncontested data. Although similar in concept to tolerable daily intake (TDI), which is of the same derivation of [[acceptable daily intake]]s (ADIs), TWI accounts for contaminants that do not clear the body quickly and may accumulate within the body over a period of time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  An example is heavy metals such as arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = http://koreascience.or.kr/journal/view.jsp?kj=DSHHBQ&amp;py=2012&amp;vnc=v28n3&amp;sp=143|url = http://koreascience.or.kr/journal/view.jsp?kj=DSHHBQ&amp;py=2012&amp;vnc=v28n3&amp;sp=143|journal = Toxicological Research|pages = 143–149|volume = 28|issue = 3|doi = 10.5487/tr.2012.28.3.143|first = Ji-Ae|last = Kim|first2 = Seung-Ha|last2 = Lee|first3 = Seung-Hyun|last3 = Choi|first4 = Ki-Kyung|last4 = Jung|first5 = Mi-Sun|last5 = Park|first6 = Ji-Yoon|last6 = Jeong|first7 = Myung-Sil|last7 = Hwang|first8 = Hae-Jung|last8 = Yoon|first9 = Dal-Woong|last9 = Choi|pmc = 3834422}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of TWI takes into account daily variations in human consumption patterns.

==Background==
Governments and international organizations such as the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), the Joint FAO/WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues (JMPR), the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and the [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO) generally use the safety factor approach, based on ADI, to determine intake tolerances for substances that exhibit thresholds for toxicity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The Codex Alimentarius Commission, with the help of independent international risk assessment bodies or ad-hoc consultations organized by FAO and WHO, develops and publishes tolerances based on the best available science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CODEX Alimentarius: About Codex|url = http://www.codexalimentarius.org/about-codex/en/|website = www.codexalimentarius.org|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After identifying a substance of concern, researchers and experts then study information the substance's metabolism by humans and animals (as appropriate), the substance's [[toxicokinetics]] and [[toxicodynamics]] (including carry-over of the toxic substance from feed to edible animal tissue/products); and the substance's acute and long term toxicity in order to determine the acceptability and safety of intake levels of the substance.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  In comparison to TWI, the Codex maximum level (ML) for a food is the maximum concentration of that substance recommended by the Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC) to be legally permitted in that commodity.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/agns/pdf/CXS_193e.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Data Sources ==
# The JECFA makes a distinction between acceptable intakes and tolerable intakes. Tolerable is used to demonstrate permissibility, not acceptability.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Substances such as [[food additive]]s, veterinary drugs, and pesticides that can be controlled in the food supply relatively easily are assessed an acceptable daily intake, or ADI.  Other substances considered contaminants are assessed a tolerable daily or weekly intake, TDI or TWI, respectively.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Tolerable intakes, whether daily, weekly, or monthly, should not be confused with [[Reference Daily Intake|reference daily intake]], or RDI.  RDI refers to the amount of a given nutrient individuals should uptake to maintain health.
# When determining TWI, appropriate safety factors are applied to allow for extrapolation of human [[no-observed-adverse-effect level]]s (NOAELs). NOAELs are established by toxicological studies in animals, and the appropriate safety factors are applied so human NOAELs can be extrapolated.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Precision of Estimates of an ADI (or TDI or PTWI)|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273230099913314|journal = Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology|date = 1999-10-01|pages = S87-S93|volume = 30|issue = 2|doi = 10.1006/rtph.1999.1331|first = Gerrit J. A.|last = Speijers}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For additives that have an observed effect, and it is not known whether or not the effect is negative, ADI is based on a no observed effect level, or NOEL.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;   To determine the NOEL, researchers primarily use animals (the species most sensitive to the treatments) and carefully select doses until they determine the highest dose that presents an adverse (toxic, but not deadly) effect not observed in lowest dose.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When adverse effects predominate, the JMPR bases the ADI on the NOAELs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Uncertainty factors&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Guidance values for human exposure limits (EHC 170, 1994)|url = http://www.inchem.org/documents/ehc/ehc/ehc170.htm|website = www.inchem.org|accessdate = 2015-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; are applied to account for intra- and inter-species differences.

==Calculations==

Tolerable intake is usually expressed in micrograms or milligrams per kilogram of body weight.  Intake (exposure) is determined using the following formula:

Exposure = ∑&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;
(consumption)&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; x (concentration)&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; / Body Weight

The '''University of Mount Olive''' is a private liberal arts institution located in [[Mount Olive, North Carolina|Mount Olive]], [[North Carolina]], accredited by the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges]] and is a member of the North Carolina Independent Colleges &amp; Universities. Chartered in 1951, the University is sponsored by the [[Original Free Will Baptist Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moc.edu/about/history|title=History of Mount Olive College|accessdate=2013-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University's roots and educational philosophy can be traced as early as 1897 when Free Will Baptists in [[Pitt County, North Carolina|Pitt County]], North Carolina, citing a growing need for education in the community, led a discourse on education within the church. These efforts ultimately resulted in the founding of the Free Will Baptist Theological Seminary and its successor institution, Eureka College, both in [[Ayden, North Carolina|Ayden]], North Carolina, to educate ministers and provide a liberal arts education to the local constituency. After a catastrophic fire destroyed the administration building in 1931, Eureka College ceased operations, and the Free Will Baptist church’s efforts to fulfill its educational vision were reinvested in the founding of what is today the University of Mount Olive.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Pelt |first=Michael|title=A History of Ayden Seminary and Eureka College |pages=3–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Pelt |first=Michael|title=A History of Ayden Seminary and Eureka College |pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== History ==

===Founding===
[[File:Mount olive college mtallenjc cragmont.jpg|thumb|right|Cragmont Assembly, [[Black Mountain, North Carolina|Black Mountain]], [[North Carolina]], location of the college's campus from 1952-53.]]From its inception as a junior college, the University of Mount Olive has been sponsored by the [[Original Free Will Baptist Convention]]. The institution was chartered in 1951 and opened in 1952 at Cragmont Assembly, the Free Will Baptist summer retreat grounds near [[Black Mountain, North Carolina]], under the direction of the Reverend Lloyd Vernon. The school was originally called Mount Allen Junior College, taking its name from the mountain near Cragmont.

===1953–1970===
In September 1953, the College moved to [[Mount Olive, North Carolina|Mount Olive]], North Carolina, nearer the center of denominational strength in the eastern region of the state. Under the leadership of the Reverend David W. Hansley, Chairman of the Board of Directors, plans were made to develop a junior college offering programs in arts and sciences and in business. The Reverend W. Burkette Raper was elected president in the summer of 1954, and in September the college began its first collegiate year with an enrollment of twenty-two students.
[[File:Mount olive college mtolivefirstbldg.jpg|thumb|left|First campus building in [[Mount Olive, North Carolina]].]]
In 1956, the name "Mount Allen Junior College" was changed to "Mount Olive Junior College". In that same year, plans were launched for an enlarged campus which today consists of 250 acres. In September 1970, the college's name was officially changed to Mount Olive College.

===1971–1990===
In 1977, the [[Original Free Will Baptist Convention]] requested that the Board of Trustees of Mount Olive College work aggressively toward making the college a four-year institution. The 1979 session of the convention endorsed the projected timetable set by the college's Board of Trustees to add the junior year in 1984 and the senior year in 1985.

In 1975, the college began an educational program in [[Goldsboro, North Carolina]] at [[Seymour Johnson Air Force Base]].

In 1986, the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges]] officially accredited Mount Olive College as a four-year institution to award associate and baccalaureate degrees.
[[File:Mount Olive college aerial view 1980s 2012.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view comparisons of the main campus (Top to Bottom: circa 1980, 2012)]]

===1991–2008===
In the fall of 1994, the transfer of all operations to the main campus was complete and the original downtown campus was sold. In addition to the satellite campuses at New Bern and Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, the University expanded operations to reach non-traditional students at four other locations in North Carolina (Wilmington, Research Triangle Park, Washington, and Smithfield).

In January 1995, the Board of Trustees selected J. William Byrd as the third president.  Dr. Byrd assumed the duties of office on January 31 and was inaugurated on September 30.

===2008-Present===

An additional branch campus expansion was opened in Jacksonville, North Carolina in 2009, and academic delivery of some of the University's programs became available online in 2012. 

Mount Olive College officially changed its name to the University of Mount Olive as of January 1, 2014.

==Campus==

'''Earl Warren Throckmorton''' (born 1957)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bios.marquiswhoswho.com/earl_warren_throckmorton/mental_health_counselor/6347950|title=Earl Warren Throckmorton - mental health counselor - Marquis Who's Who Biography|work=marquiswhoswho.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a professor of [[Psychology]]  at [[Grove City College]] in [[Grove City, Pennsylvania|Grove City]], [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gcc.edu/academics/artsandletters/psychology/Pages/Faculty.aspx|title=Faculty|work=gcc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; He developed the [[Sexual Identity Therapy Framework]] and was a creator of the documentary ''I Do Exist'', about people who say they have changed their sexual orientation. He is an example of an evangelical Christian who has changed his view about human sexuality, from traditional to more progressive.

== Education ==
Throckmorton received his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[Psychology]] in June, 1979 from [[Cedarville College]], an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in [[Clinical Psychology]] from [[Central Michigan University]] in May, 1982, and a [[Ph.D.]] in Counselor Education and Community Counseling from [[Ohio University]] in June 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drthrockmorton.com/webvita.pdf drthrockmorton.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sexual Identity and the Bible ==
Throckmorton's work on [[Sexual Identity Therapy]] was endorsed by psychiatrist [[Robert L. Spitzer]].&lt;ref name="New Ground"&gt;{{cite news
 |url = http://wthrockmorton.com/2007/06/18/la-times-article-features-ex-gay-debate-and-sexual-identity-therapy

 |accessdate = 2018-05-09
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of these recommendations is to help patients make their sexual identity conform to their beliefs and values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|publisher=Christian Post Reporter
|date=April 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spitzer later tried to retract his research that endorsed Throckmorton's work by saying "The findings can be considered evidence for what those who have undergone ex-gay therapy say about it, but nothing more."&lt;ref name="My So-Called Ex-Gay Life"&gt;{{cite news

 |first = Gabriel
 |publisher = [[The American Prospect]]
 |date = 2012-04-11
 |accessdate = 2012-06-02
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throckmorton has come out strongly against the [[Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Bill]]. In turn, former endorsers of his work, such as [[Scott Lively]], have denounced him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.boxturtlebulletin.com/2012/08/13/47584|title = Scott Lively: Moral Relativist|author = Rob Tisinai|date = August 13, 2012|publisher = Box Turtle Bulletin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throckmorton has been involved in controversy over the origins and treatment of variations in gender identity. The February 2008 issue of ''[[Christianity Today]]'' carried an article discussing how Throckmorton has advised people who are in agony over being transgender that their desires are not in accord with the Bible.&lt;ref name="Kennedy 2008"&gt;{{cite web |author=Kennedy, John W. |date=February 2008 |title=The transgender moment; Evangelicals hope to respond with both moral authority and biblical compassion to gender identity disorder |work=[[Christianity Today]] |pages=54–58 |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/article_print.html?id=53605}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Even if science does determine differentiation in the brain at birth," Throckmorton says, "even if there are prenatal influences, we can't set aside teachings of the Bible, because of research findings."&lt;ref name="Kennedy 2008"/&gt; Throckmorton subsequently argued that these comments were quoted "out of context". On his blog, he stated that people should consult physicians, specialists, and spiritual advisors in resolving their feelings. If someone decides that sexual reassignment violates faith, then this feeling may guide their decisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wthrockmorton.com/2008/02/14/christianity-today-on-the-transgender-moment/ Christianity Today on “The Transgender Moment” — Warren Throckmorton&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist Jeff Sharlet said that Throckmorton has allowed data and evidence to shape his views "in a way very few people of any ideological or political stripe would."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/evangelical-professor-turned-reparative-therapy-gays-174326663.html|title=The evangelical professor who turned against 'reparative therapy' for gays|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; That article goes on to trace Throckmorton's on-going development of his views on human sexuality and the Bible, which he still believes is divinely inspired. To say it more clearly, Throckmorton has blogged: "After working with LGBT people for two decades, I believe some people are inherently gay."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/warrenthrockmorton/2017/11/15/wishful-thinking-and-nashville-statement/|title=Wishful Thinking, Forced Intimacy, and The Nashville Statement|last=Throckmorton|first=Warren|date=2017-11-15|work=Warren Throckmorton|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Blogging controversies ==
In addition to his writings on sexuality, he has also blogged on various Christian religious organizations involved in controversy, such as:

*[[Mark Driscoll]] and the now-defunct [[Mars Hill Church]] in Seattle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/warrenthrockmorton/category/mars-hill-church/|title=Mars Hill Church|work=Warren Throckmorton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wilfred Cantwell Smith''' {{post-nominals|country=CAN|OC}} (July 21, 1916 &amp;ndash; February 7, 2000) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] professor of [[comparative religion]] who from 1964&amp;ndash;1973 was director of [[Harvard University]]'s [[Center for the Study of World Religions]]. The ''Harvard Gazette'' said he was one of the field's most influential figures of the past century.&lt;ref name="obituary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2001/11.29/27-memorialminute.html|title=Wilfred Cantwell Smith: In Memoriam|work=Harvard University Gazette|accessdate=4 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1962 work ''The Meaning and End of Religion'' he notably and controversially questioned the validity of the concept of [[religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, W.C. (1962) ''The Meaning and End of Religion''. First Fortress Press Edition 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and career ==
Smith was born in [[Toronto]] to parents Victor Arnold Smith and Sarah Cory Cantwell. He was the younger brother of [[Arnold Smith]] and the father of [[Brian Cantwell Smith]].

He received a [[B.A]]. with honours in [[Languages of Asia|oriental languages]] in 1938 from the [[University of Toronto]]. After his thesis was rejected by [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]], supposedly for its [[Marxist]] critique of the [[British Raj]], he and his wife Muriel Mackenzie Struthers spent seven years in Pre-Independence [[India]] (1940–1946), during which he taught [[Indian history|Indian]] and [[Islamic history]] at [[Forman Christian College]] in [[Lahore]].

In 1948 he obtained a [[Ph.D]] in oriental languages at [[Princeton University]], after which he taught at [[McGill University|McGill]], founding in 1952 the university's [[McGill University Institute of Islamic Studies|Institute of Islamic Studies]]. From 1964 to 1973 Smith taught at [[Harvard Divinity School]]. He left Harvard for [[Dalhousie University]] in [[Halifax Urban Area|Halifax, NS]], where he founded the Department of Religion. He was also among the original Editorial Advisors of the scholarly journal ''[[Dionysius (journal)|Dionysius]]''. In 1978 he returned to Harvard. In 1979 he received an honorary doctorate from [[Concordia University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archives.concordia.ca/smith-w|title=Honorary Degree Citation - Wilfred Cantwell Smith* {{!}} Concordia University Archives|website=archives.concordia.ca|access-date=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his retirement from teaching, he was appointed a senior research associate in the Faculty of Divinity at [[University of Trinity College|Trinity College]], University of Toronto, in 1985. He died on February 7, 2000.&lt;ref name="obituary" /&gt;

==Views on religion==
In his best known and most controversial work, Smith contends that the [[concept]] of religion, rather than being a universally valid category as is generally supposed, is a peculiarly [[Europe]]an [[construct (philosophy of science)|construct]] of recent origin.  Religion, he argues, is a static concept that does not adequately address the complexity and flux of religious lives. Instead of the concept of religion, Smith proffers a new conceptual apparatus: the dynamic dialectic between ''cumulative tradition'' (all historically observable rituals, art, music, theologies, etc.) and ''personal faith''. (p.&amp;nbsp;194)

Smith sets out chapter by chapter to demonstrate that none of the founders or followers of the world's major religions had any understanding that they were engaging in a defined system called religion. The major exception to this rule, Cantwell Smith points out, is [[Islam]] which he describes as the most "entity like"' (p.&amp;nbsp;85). In a chapter titled ''The special case of Islam'', Smith points out that the term Islam appears in the [[Qur'an]], making it the only religion not named in opposition to or by another tradition. (p.&amp;nbsp;80). Other than the prophet [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]], only the prophet [[Muhammad]] was conscious of the establishment of a religion.  (p.&amp;nbsp;106). Smith points out that the [[Arabic]] language does not have a word for religion, strictly speaking: he details how the word ''din'', customarily translated as such, differs in significant important respects from the European concept.

The terms for major world religions today, including Hinduism, Buddhism, and Shintoism, did not exist until the 19th century.  Smith suggests that practitioners of any given faith do not historically come to regard what they do as ''religion'' until they have developed a degree of cultural self-regard, causing them to see their collective spiritual practices and beliefs as in some way significantly ''different'' from the ''other''. Religion in the contemporary sense of the word is for Smith the product of both [[identity politics]] and [[apologetics]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"One's own 'religion' may be piety and faith, obedience, worship, and a vision of God. An alien 'religion' is a system of beliefs or rituals, an abstract and impersonal pattern of observables. A dialectic ensues, however. If one's own 'religion' is attacked, by unbelievers who necessarily conceptualize it schematically, or all religion is, by the indifferent, one tends to leap to the defence of what is attacked, so that presently participants of a faith - especially those most involved in argument - are using the term in the same externalist and theoretical sense as their opponents. Religion as a systematic entity, as it emerged in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, is a concept of polemics and apologetics" (p. 43).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By way of an [[etymology|etymological]] study of ''religion'' (''religio'', in [[Latin]]), Smith further contends that the term, which at first and for most of the centuries denoted an attitude towards a relationship between [[God]] and ''man'' (p.&amp;nbsp;26), has through conceptual slippage come to mean a "system of observances or beliefs" (p.&amp;nbsp;29), a historical tradition which has been institutionalized through a process of [[Reification (fallacy)|reification]].  Whereas ''religio'' denoted personal [[piety]], ''religion'' came to refer to an [[abstract entity]] (or [[transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] signifier) which, Smith says, does not exist.

He argues that the term as found in [[Lucretius]] and [[Cicero]] was internalized by the [[Catholic Church]] through [[Lactantius]] and [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]].  During the [[Middle Ages]] it was superseded by the term ''faith'', which Smith favors by contrast. In the [[Renaissance]],  via the Christian [[Platonist]] [[Marsilio Ficino]], ''religio'' becomes popular again, retaining its original emphasis on personal practice, even in [[John Calvin]]'s ''Christianae Religionis Institutio'' (1536). During 17th Century debates between Catholics and [[Protestant]]s, religion begins to refer to an abstract system of beliefs, especially when describing an oppositional structure. Through the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] this concept is further reified, so that by the nineteenth century [[Hegel]] defines religion as ''Begriff'', "a self-subsisting transcendent idea that unfolds itself in dynamic expression in the course of ever-changing history ... something real in itself, a great entity with which man has to reckon, a something that precedes all its historical manifestation" (p.&amp;nbsp;47).

Smith concludes (p.&amp;nbsp;48-9) by arguing that the term religion has now acquired four distinct senses: 
# personal piety (e.g. as meant by the phrase "he is more religious than he was ten years ago");
# an overt system of beliefs, practices and values, related  to a particular community manifesting itself as the ''ideal'' religion that the theologian tries to formulate, but which he knows transcends him (e.g. 'true Christianity');
# an overt system of beliefs, practices and values, related  to a particular community manifesting itself as the ''empirical phenomenon'', historical and sociological (e.g. the Christianity of history);
# a generic summation or universal category, i.e. ''religion in general''.

''The Meaning and End of Religion'' remains Smith's most influential work.
The [[anthropologist]] and writer on religion and [[post-colonial studies]] [[Talal Asad]] has said ''The Meaning and End of Religion'' is a modern classic and a masterpiece.&lt;ref&gt;[[Talal Asad]] (2001) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3176697 ''Reading a Modern Classic: W.

Wireless Andrew is a 2-megabit-per-second wireless local area network connected through access points
to the wired Andrew network, a high-speed Ethernet backbone linking buildings across the Carnegie
Mellon campus.
Wireless Andrew consists of 100 access points covering six buildings on the Carnegie Mellon campus.
The university tested the current setup with over 40 mobile units before allowing general use by
researchers and students in February 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Wireless LAN applications | url=http://www.iet.unipi.it/f.giannetti/documenti/wlan/Data/refer/prosp/application.pdf | accessdate= October 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
