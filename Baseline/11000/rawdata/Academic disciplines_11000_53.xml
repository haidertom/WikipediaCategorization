      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4632">'''Ambient authority''' is a term used in the study of [[access control]] systems.

A subject, such as a computer program, is said to be using
''ambient authority'' if it only needs to specify the names
of the involved object(s) and the operation to be performed on them
in order for a permitted action to succeed.

In this definition,
* a "name" is any way of referring to an object that does not itself include authorising information, and could potentially be used by any subject;
* an action is "permitted" for a subject if there exists ''any'' request that that subject could make that would cause the action to be carried out.

The authority is "ambient" in the sense that it exists in a broadly
visible environment (often, but not necessarily a global environment)
where any subject can request it by name.

For example, suppose a C program opens a file for read access 
by executing the call:

  open("filename", O_RDONLY, 0)

The desired file is designated by its name on the filesystem,
which does not by itself include authorising information, so the program
is exercising ambient authority.

When ambient authority is requested, permissions are granted or denied
based on one or more global properties of the executing program,
such as its ''identity'' or its ''role''.
In such cases,
the management of [[access control]] is handled separately
from explicit communication
to the executing program or [[Process (computing)|process]],
through means such as [[access control list]]s associated with objects
or through [[Role-Based Access Control]] mechanisms.
The executing program has no means to [[reification (computer science)|reify]] the permissions
that it was granted for a specific purpose as [[first-class value]]s.
So, if the program should be able to access an object when acting on
its own behalf but not when acting on behalf of one of its clients (or, on
behalf of one client but not another), it has no way to express
that intention. This inevitably leads to such programs
being subject to the [[Confused deputy problem]].

The term "ambient authority" is used primarily
to contrast with [[capability-based security]] (including [[object-capability model]]s),
in which executing programs receive permissions
as they might receive data, as communicated [[first-class object]] references.
This allows them to determine where the permissions came from,
and thus avoid the [[Confused deputy problem]]. However, since there
are additional requirements for a system to be considered a capability system besides avoiding ambient authority,
"non-ambient authority system" is not just a synonym for "capability system".

Ambient authority
is the dominant form of access control
in computer systems today.
The ''user'' model of access control
as used in Unix and in Windows systems
is an ambient authority model
because programs execute
with the authorities of the ''user'' that started them.
This not only means that executing programs
are inevitably given more permissions
(see [[Principle of least privilege]])
than they need for their task,
but that they are unable to determine
the source or the number and types of permission that they have.
A program executing under an ambient authority access control model
has little option but to designate permissions
and try to exercise them, hoping for the best.
This property requires an excess of permissions
to be granted to users or roles,
in order for programs to execute without error.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23220">'''Androcentrism''' ([[Ancient Greek]], ἀνήρ, "man, male"&lt;ref name="Liddell &amp; Scott"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Liddell | first1 = Henry G. | last2 = Scott | first2 = Robert | last3 = Stuart Jones | first3 = Henry | others = Roderick McKenzie | author-link1 = Edward Liddell | author-link2 = Robert Scott (philologist) | author-link3 = Henry Stuart Jones | title = [[A Greek–English Lexicon]] | publisher = Clarendon Press | location = Oxford | year = 1940 | oclc = 499596825 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the practice, conscious or otherwise, of placing a [[masculine]] point of view at the center of one's [[world view]], culture, and history, thereby culturally marginalizing femininity. The related adjective is ''androcentric'', while the practice of placing the [[feminine]] point of view at the center is ''[[gynocentric]]''.

== Origin of the term ==

The term ''androcentrism'' was introduced as an analytic concept by [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] in a scientific debate. Perkins Gilman described androcentric practices in society and the resulting problems they created in her investigation on ''The Man-Made World; or, Our Androcentric Culture'', published in 1911.&lt;ref name="CPG_1911"&gt;{{cite book | last = Perkins Gilman | first = Charlotte | author-link = Charlotte Perkins Gilman | title = The man-made world: or, Our androcentric culture | publisher = Charlton | location = New York | year = 1911 | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3015/3015-h/3015-h.htm | oclc = 988836210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this androcentrism can be understood as a societal fixation on masculinity whereby all things originate. Under androcentrism, masculinity is normative and all things outside of masculinity are defined as ''[[Other (philosophy)|other]]''. According to Perkins Gilman, masculine patterns of life and masculine mindsets claimed [[Universality (philosophy)|universality]] while female patterns were considered as [[deviance (sociology)|deviance]].&lt;ref name="CPG_1911" /&gt;

== Education ==
In the past boys and men were expected to have better formal education than girls and women. Girls and women were less frequently able to read and write than boys and men were; thus, written material tended to reflect the male point of view.  Well into the second half of the 20th century young men entered university far more frequently than young women.{{cn|date=September 2018}} Some universities such as the [[University of Oxford]] consciously practiced a [[numerus clausus]] and restricted the number of female undergraduates they accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Frances Lannon|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/404111.article|title=Her Oxford|work=Times Higher Education|date=30 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, "educated opinion" risked being androcentric.

== Literature ==

In the majority of societies today, books, magazine articles and book reviews are written predominantly by men and therefore may privilege a male viewpoint. For instance, in 2010 only 37% of the books published by [[Random House]] were written by women, and only 17% of the books reviewed by ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' were written by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Franklin | first = Ruth | title = A Literary Glass Ceiling? Why magazines aren't reviewing more female writers | url = http://www.tnr.com/article/books-and-arts/82930/VIDA-women-writers-magazines-book-reviews | work = [[The New Republic]] | date = February 7, 2011 | access-date = March 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research conducted by VIDA in 2010 found that men wrote the vast majority of articles and book reviews in leading magazines in the United States and the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = VIDA | title = The Count 2010 | url = http://vidaweb.org/the-count-2010 | work = VIDA: Women in Literary Arts | date = May 16, 2011 | access-date = March 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research by Dr. David Anderson and Dr. Mykol Hamilton has documented the under-representation of female characters in 200 top-selling children's books from 2001 and a seven-year sample of [[Caldecott]] award-winning books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = Mykol C. | last2 = Anderson | first2 = David | last3 = Broaddus | first3 = Michelle | last4 = Young | first4 = Kate | title = Gender stereotyping and under-representation of female characters in 200 popular children’s picture books: a twenty-first century update | journal = [[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] | volume = 55 | issue = 11&amp;ndash;12 | pages = 757&amp;ndash;765 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | doi = 10.1007/s11199-006-9128-6 | date = December 2006 | url = https://doi.org/10.1007/s11199-006-9128-6 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were nearly twice as many male main characters as female main characters, and male characters appeared in illustrations 53 percent more than female characters. Most of the plot-lines centered on the male characters and their experiences of life.

== TV and film ==

The vast majority of films are written and directed by men. This may result in an androcentric bias, with most films (and film characters) being created from a male perspective. Of the top 250 grossing films in 2007, 82% had no female writers and only 6% had a female director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lauzen | first = Martha M. | title = The celluloid ceiling report: behind-the-scenes employment of women in the top 250 films of 2007 | url = http://womenintvfilm.sdsu.edu/files/Celluloid%20Ceiling%202007%20Full%20Report.pdf | publisher = Center for the study of women in television and film, [[San Diego State University]] | access-date = 17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 70% of all film reviews published in the USA are written by men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Lauzen | first = Martha M. | title = Thumbs down - representation of women film critics in the top 100 U.S. daily newspapers | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110312222038/http://awfj.org/hot-topic/thumbs-down-representation-of-women-film-critics-in-the-top-100-us-newspapers-a-study-by-dr-martha-lauzen | archive-date = 12 March 2011 | url = http://awfj.org/hot-topic/thumbs-down-representation-of-women-film-critics-in-the-top-100-us-newspapers-a-study-by-dr-martha-lauzen/ | date = 2008 | access-date = 17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, not only do men have more influence than women over the storyline and characters of most films but also they have the most influence when it comes to publicly reviewing them. Because most film reviewers are male, androcentric films (films from a masculine viewpoint) may tend to receive more glowing reviews than female-centric films.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

A 2009 study conducted by the [[Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media|Geena Davis Institute]] analyzed 122 children's films (released between 2006 and 2009) and found both a male bias 'behind the scenes' of the films as well as a male bias in the content of the films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Smith | first1 = Stacy | last2 = Choueiti | first2 = March | title = Gender on screen and behind the camera in family films: an executive summary | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101223180123/http://www.thegeenadavisinstitute.org/downloads/KeyFindings_GenderDisparityFamilyFilms.pdf | archive-date = 23 December 2010 | url = http://www.thegeenadavisinstitute.org/downloads/KeyFindings_GenderDisparityFamilyFilms.pdf | publisher = [[Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media]] |date=23 December 2010 | access-date = 17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of this sample, 93% of directors, 87% of writers, and 80% of producers were male. Therefore, an androcentric (male) perspective was dominant in most of the films. The report argued that the male dominance behind most of the films was connected to a male bias (an androcentric bias) in the content of the films themselves. For instance, the majority (70.8%) of the speaking characters in these films were also male, and female characters were much more likely than male characters to be portrayed as beautiful. The report argued that "cinematic females are valued more than cinematic males for their looks, youthfulness, and sexy demeanor".

== The arts ==

In 1985 a group of female artists from New York, the [[Guerrilla Girls]], began to protest the under-representation of female artists. According to them, male artists and the male viewpoint continued to dominate the visual art world. In a 1989 poster (displayed on NYC buses) titled "Do women have to be naked to get into the Met. Museum?" They reported that less than 5% of the artists in the Modern Art sections of the Met Museum were women, but 85% of the nudes were female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Guerilla Girls poster 1989 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131125204514/http://www.guerrillagirls.com/posters/getnaked.shtml | archive-date = 25 November 2013 | url = http://www.guerrillagirls.com/posters/getnaked.shtml | publisher = [[Guerrilla Girls]] | access-date = 17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 20 years later, women were still under-represented in the art world. In 2007, Jerry Saltz (journalist from the New York Times) criticized the Museum of Modern Art for undervaluing work by female artists. Of the 400 works of art he counted in the Museum of Modern Art, only 14 were by women (3.5%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Saltz | first = Jerry | author-link = Jerry Saltz | title = Where are All the Women?

== Generic male language ==

In literature, the use of masculine language to refer to men, women, intersex, and non-binary may indicate a male or androcentic bias in society where men are seen as the 'norm', and women, intersex, and non-binary are seen as the 'other'. Some examples are forms of address (such as "Hey guys" or "Dear Sirs") and masculine nouns and pronouns (such as 'mankind', 'man' or 'he') to refer to men, women, intersex, and non-binary. Philosophy scholar Jennifer Saul argued that the use of male generic language marginalizes women, intersex, and non-binary in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Paul | first = Jennifer | title = Feminist philosophy of language | url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-language/#1.1 | website = plato.stanford.edu | publisher = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (online) | date = 2004 | access-date = 17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, some writers have started to use more gender-inclusive language (for instance, using the pronouns they/them, and using gender-inclusive words like humankind, person, partner, spouse, businessperson, fire-fighter, chairperson and police-officer).

Many Latin-based languages in the world are also male-centric. For instance, in Spanish the word ''padres'' (plural of 'father') means 'parents', ''abuelos'' (plural of 'grandfather') means 'grandparents', and ''chicos'' means either 'boys' or 'children'. Pluralized nouns are, if describing a mixed-gender group, assigned male word-endings, pronouns, and adjectives.  This dominance of the masculine grammatical form in formation of the plural is a property also of Italian, Portuguese and French.

Many studies have shown that male generic language is not interpreted as truly 'gender-inclusive.'&lt;ref&gt;

Three studies by Mykol Hamilton show that there is not only a male → people bias but also a people → male bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hamilton | first = Mykol C. | title = &lt;nowiki&gt;Masculine bias in the attribution of personhood: people = male, male = people&lt;/nowiki&gt; | journal = [[Psychology of Women Quarterly]] | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 393&amp;ndash;402 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-6402.1991.tb00415.x | date = November 1991 | url = https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-6402.1991.tb00415.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, a masculine bias remains even when people are exposed to only gender neutral language (although the bias is lessened). In two of her studies, half of the participants (after exposure to gender neutral language) had male-biased imagery but the rest of the participants displayed no gender bias at all.  In her third study, only males showed a masculine-bias (after exposure to gender neutral language) — females showed no gender bias. Hamilton asserted that this may be due to the fact that males have grown up being able to think more easily than females of "any person" as generic "he," since "he" applies to them. Further, of the two options for neutral language, neutral language that explicitly names women (e.g., "he or she") reduces androcentrism more effectively than neutral language that makes no mention of gender whatsoever (e.g., "human").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Khosroshahi | first = Fatemeh | title = Penguins don't care, but women do: A social identity analysis of a Whorfian problem | journal = [[Language in Society]] | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 505&amp;ndash;525 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press|Cambridge Journals]] | doi = 10.1017/S0047404500013889 | date = December 1989 | url = https://doi.org/10.1017/S0047404500013889 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bailey | first1 = April H. | last2 = LaFrance | first2 = Marianne | title = Who counts as human?

Feminist anthropologist Sally Slocum argues that there has been a longstanding male bias in anthropological thought as evidenced by terminology used when referring to society, culture and humankind. According to Slocum, "All too often the word 'man' is used in such an ambiguous fashion that it is impossible to decide whether it refers to males or just the human species in general, including both males and females."&lt;ref&gt;Slocum, Sally (2012) [1975], "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Kou0uQAACAAJ Woman the gatherer: male bias in anthropology]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = McGee | editor-first1 = R. Jon | editor-last2 = Warms | editor-first2 = Richard L. | title = Anthropological theory: an introductory history | pages = 399&amp;ndash;407 | publisher = McGraw-Hill | location = New York | isbn = 9780078034886 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Generic male symbols ==

The default images in Western society for 'man' and for 'human being' are usually the same. For example, the 'walking person' light (that indicates when it is safe for pedestrians to cross the road) looks the same as the symbol for 'man' on the door of a male restroom. The typical symbol for 'woman' looks quite different (with long hair and a triangle body to indicate she is wearing a dress).

On the Internet, many avatars are gender-neutral (such as an image of a smiley face). However, when an avatar is human and discernibly gendered, it usually appears to be male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Wade | first = Lisa | title = Default avatars: a collection | url = https://cyberpsychology.eu/article/view/6281/5883 | work = [[University of Minnesota|The Society Pages]] &amp;#124; Sociological Images | publisher = [[University of Minnesota]] | date = 4 May 2009 | access-date = 17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bailey | first1 = April H. | last2 = LaFrance | first2 = Marianne | title = Anonymously male: Social media avatar icons are implicitly male and resistant to change | journal = Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | page = 8 | publisher = [[Masaryk University]] | doi = 10.5817/CP2016-4-8 | date = 2016 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.5817/CP2016-4-8 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; This indicates that the image of a man (but not that of a woman) is considered to be a normative representation of humankind in general.

== Politics and the law ==

In 2008 Rwanda became the first country in the world to have a female-majority parliament (56% of seats).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = McCrummen | first = Stephanie | title = Women run the show in a recovering Rwanda | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/26/AR2008102602197.html | work = [[The Washington Post]] | date = 27 October 2008 | access-date = 17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 2011, Rwanda remains the only country in the world to have a female majority parliament.

==Sports==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2017}}
Sports media channels such as [[ESPN]] and [[Fox Sports (USA)|Fox Sports]], as well as sports magazines like [[Sports Illustrated]], are assumed to appeal to a predominantly male audience. This is reflected by its advertisers who almost exclusively target men. Men are also most likely to stimulate the sporting economy whether the advertising is targeted non-gender specifically. {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}''&lt;!--This statement is not supported by research and data--&gt;analysis.''

The '''Arthur Rylah Institute for Environmental Research''' ('''ARI''') is the [[biodiversity]] [[scientific research|research]] organisation for the [[Government of Victoria (Australia)|government]] of [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]], [[Australia]].  It provides advice on ecologically sustainable land and water management issues and with regard to threatened native flora and fauna.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dse.vic.gov.au/DSE/nrenari.nsf/childdocs/-4FD1424937BDBBBE4A256A4000270FFA?open DSE: About the Arthur Rylah Institute for Environmental Research] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080730235349/http://www.dse.vic.gov.au/DSE/nrenari.nsf/childdocs/-4FD1424937BDBBBE4A256A4000270FFA?open |date=30 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is named after [[Arthur Rylah|Sir Arthur Rylah]], a long-serving Victorian [[politics|politician]] and deputy state premier between 1955 and 1971. 

==History==

Arthur Rylah Institute for Environmental Research (ARI) was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth on 8 April 1970 as part of the Fisheries and Wildlife Division.  The foundation Director was Alfred Dunbavin Butcher who also had an association with Melbourne Zoo and Healesville Sanctuary.  He had a keen interest in art and this attracted a large collection of wildlife art and the commissioning of a large mural at the institute.  
The institute was subsequently incorporated into various Victorian Government Departments since then including the Ministry for Conservation, the Department of Conservation Forests and Lands, the Department of Sustainability and Environment; and is currently (2017) within the Department of Environment Land Water and Planning.

==Publications==
There have been many published reports, journal articles, book sections, books, theses and conference proceedings from the ARI releasing information about scientific research on plants and animals.

'''Asia-Japan Women's Resource Center''' (AJWRC) is a [[non-governmental organisation]] founded in 1994 that advocates [[gender equality]], the end of violence against women, a more just society, and environmentally [[sustainable development]].

AJWRC holds events like empowerment seminars and study groups for women, training and workshops, and they also publish research and conduct outreach campaigns in furtherance of their mission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humantrafficking.org/organizations/141 HumanTrafficking.org organization overview] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130323002845/http://www.humantrafficking.org/organizations/141 |date=March 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The activities serve to raise awareness among Japanese women of global as well as domestic issues. Because [[Japan]] is a leading nation in the Asian economy and international politics, the organisation feels an obligation to encourage Japanese women to take a leading role in advocacy for improved [[human rights]]. Additionally, Japan is the destination for the largest number of cross-border [[human trafficking]] victims in [[Asia]], which AJWRC takes as further impetus for their mission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aworc.org/org/ajwrc/ajwrc.html AWORC member profile]&lt;/ref&gt;

Disparity between genders has been shrinking in most developed countries over the last century, but AJWRC holds that Japan has lagged behind the trend. As examples, women represent a mere 10% of the [[National Diet]], [[Japan]]'s legislative body, and women earn just 60% of the salary of their male counterparts in the workforce.

AJWRC grew out of the Asian Women's Association, which was founded in 1977, when gender inequality was even more severe. It wasn't until 1985 that the Japanese government ratified a [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]],&lt;ref&gt;Yuji Iwasawa. ''International Law, Human Rights, and Japanese Law.'' Page 206.&lt;/ref&gt; and the country received failing marks as late as 1986 in [[Humana]]'s ''World Human Rights Guide''&lt;ref name=Iwasawa234&gt;Yuji Iwasawa. ''International Law, Human Rights, and Japanese Law.'' Page 234.&lt;/ref&gt; regarding the status of women, and is one of the industrialized world's least equal countries in terms of gender gap.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GenderGap_Report_2011.pdf WEF Gender Gap Report]. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The AWA initially focused on protesting the [[sex trade]], but as their influence grew, they expanded their mandate to tackle women's issues more broadly in the country, eventually forming AJWRC as it is today. According to the group's website, they work "to end all forms of violence and discrimination against women, toward democratic Japanese society based on respect for [[human rights]] and gender equality, and toward a fair and sustainable global society."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajwrc.org/eng/modules/pico1/index.php?content_id=1 AJWRC Mission Statement]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="metropolis"&gt;Jessica Ocheltree, [http://metropolis.co.jp/features/global-village/asia-japan-womens-resource-center/ Asia-Japan Women’s Resource Center], Metropolis, 9 Dec 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''avunculate''', sometimes called '''avunculism''' or '''avuncularism''', is any social institution where a special relationship exists between an uncle and his [[Nephew and niece|sisters' children]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=F0aOAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT232&amp;lpg=PT232&amp;dq=Avunculate&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rcsBD8kQCW&amp;sig=jRTzPmnrdU1bZGwGeqtQC_8gYDQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Avunculate&amp;f=false|title=The Routledge Encyclopedia of Social and Cultural Anthropology|last=Barnard|first=Alan|last2=Spencer|first2=Jonathan|date=2009-12-04|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135236403|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This relationship can be formal or informal, depending on the society. Early anthropological research focused on the association between the avunculate and [[Matrilineality|matrilineal]] descent, while later research has expanded to consider the avunculate in general society.

==Definition==
The term ''avunculate'' comes from the Latin ''[[wikt:avunculus|avunculus]],'' the maternal uncle.

The 1989 ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines "avunculate" as follows:
:"Avunculate. The special relationship existing in some societies between a maternal uncle and his sister's son; maternal uncles regarded as a collective body.
::1920 R. H. LOWIE Prim. Soc. v. 81 Ethnologists describe under the heading of avunculate the customs regulating in an altogether special way the relations of a nephew to his maternal uncle. Ibid. vii. 171 The Omaha are patrilineal now, but their having the avunculate proves that they once traced descent through the mother, for on no other hypothesis can such a usage be explained. ... "&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary''. Second Edition 1989. On-line version.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Avunculocal societies==

An avunculocal society is one in which a married couple traditionally lives with the man's mother's eldest brother, which most often occurs in [[matrilineal]] societies. The [[Anthropology|anthropological]] term "avunculocal residence" refers to this convention, which has been identified in about 4% of the world's societies.&lt;ref&gt;Rosman, Abraham and Rubel, Paula G. ''The Tapestry of Culture: An Introduction to Cultural Anthropology''. Mcgraw-Hill College, 1995. ({{ISBN|0-07-053955-3}})&lt;/ref&gt;

This pattern generally occurs when a man obtains his status, his job role, or his privileges from their nearest elder matrilineal male relative. When a woman's son lives near her brother, he is able to more easily learn how he needs to behave in the matrilineal role he has inherited.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

== Cultures with a formal avunculate ==

According to the [[Kazakhstan|Kazakh]] common law, the avunculate nephews could take anything from the relatives of the mother up to three times. In the [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] past a nephew, at a feast at his maternal uncle or grandfather, could take any horse from their herd or any delicacy.&lt;ref name="Zuev"&gt;Yu.Zuev, ''"Early Türks: Sketches of history and ideology"'', Almaty, Daik-Press, 2002, p. 30, {{Listed Invalid ISBN|9985-4-4152-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Southwest United States]], the [[Apache]] tribe practices a form of this, where the uncle is responsible for teaching the children social values and proper behavior while inheritance and ancestry is reckoned through the mother's family alone. Modern day influences have somewhat but not completely erased this tradition.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The [[Chamorros]] of the [[Mariana Islands]]&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, Lawarence J. ''Ancient Chamorro Society''. Bess Press, 1992. ({{ISBN|1-880188-05-8}})&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Taíno people|Taíno]] of [[Turks and Caicos Islands]]&lt;ref&gt;Keegan, William F.  ''[http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/caribarch/middle1999.htm Before Columbus: Caonabo’s Homeland]'', Middle Caicos Earthwatch Report, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; are examples of societies that have practiced avunculocal residence.

== Anthropology research ==

Research on the avunculate in the early 20th century focused on the association between the avunculate and patrilineal/matrilineal societies. [[Franz Boas]] categorized various avunculate arrangements based on the location of residence in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boas|first=Franz|date=1922-01-01|title=The Avunculate among the Vandau|jstor=660075|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=24|issue=1|pages=95–97|doi=10.1525/aa.1922.24.1.02a00150}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henri-Alexandre Junod|Henri Alexandre Juno]] made the claim that the avunculate in the [[Tsonga people|Tsonga]] indicated that society had previously been matrilineal.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ryder|first=J. W.|last2=Blackman|first2=M. B.|date=2016-09-14|title=The Avunculate: A Cross-Cultural Critique of Claude Levi-Strauss|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/106939717000500202|journal=Cross-Cultural Research|language=en|volume=5|issue=2|pages=97–115|doi=10.1177/106939717000500202}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred Radcliffe-Brown]] identified the Tsonga (BaThonga) of [[Mozambique]], the [[Tonga]]ns of the Pacific, and the [[Nama people|Nama]] of Namibia as avunculate societies as early as 1924. He also expanded the concept to incorporate other family relationships.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://radicalanthropologygroup.org/sites/default/files/pdf/class_text_055.pdf|title=Structure and Function in Primitive Society|last=Radcliffe-Brown|first=Alfred|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|year=1952|isbn=|location=London|pages=15–31|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Avunculate marriage==
{{Main|Avunculate marriage}}
In historical (not anthropological) terminology, an [[avunculate marriage]] is the marriage of a man with the daughter of his sister (not explicitly forbidden by the listings in [[Leviticus 18]]). In most cultures with avunculate customs in the sense used by anthropologists, such a marriage would violate incest taboos governing relations between members of the same [[matrilineality|matrilineal lineage]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The '''Besselian elements''' are a set of values used to calculate and predict the local circumstances of [[occultation]]s for an observer on Earth. This method is particularly used for [[solar eclipses]], but is also applied for occultations of [[star]]s or [[planet]]s by the [[Moon]] and [[Astronomical transit|transit]]s of [[Transit of Venus|Venus]] or [[Transit of Mercury|Mercury]]. In addition, for [[lunar eclipse]]s a similar method is used, in which the shadow is cast on the Moon instead of the Earth.&lt;ref name="Seidelmann8.1"&gt;P. Kenneth Seidelmann: ''Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac.'' page 421f, see further reading&lt;/ref&gt;

For solar eclipses, the Besselian elements are used to calculate the path of the [[umbra, penumbra and antumbra|umbra and penumbra]] on the Earth's surface, and hence the circumstances of the eclipse at a specific location. This method was developed in the 1820s by the German mathematician and astronomer, [[Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel]], and later improved by [[William Chauvenet]].

The basic concept is that Besselian elements describe the movement of the shadow cast by the occulting body –&amp;nbsp;for solar eclipses this is the shadow of the Moon&amp;nbsp;– on a specifically chosen plane, called the ''fundamental plane''. This is the geocentric, normal plane of the shadow axis. In other words, it is the plane through the Earth's center that is perpendicular to the line through the centers of the occulting and  the occulted bodies.&lt;ref name="MuckeMeeus1992"&gt;[[Hermann Mucke (astronomer)|Hermann Mucke]], [[Jean Meeus]]: ''Canon of solar eclipses: -2003 to +2526.'' Astronomisches Büro, Wien 1992, Seite XXXIII–LI&lt;/ref&gt; One advantage, among others, of choosing this plane is that the outline of the shadow on it is always a circle, and there is no [[perspective projection distortion|perspective distortion]].

Comparatively few values are needed to accurately describe the movement of the shadow on the fundamental plane. Based on this, the next step is to [[Graphical projection|project]] the shadow cone on to the Earth's surface, taking into account the [[figure of the Earth]], its [[Earth's rotation|rotation]], and the observer's [[latitude]], [[longitude]] and [[elevation]].&lt;ref name="Seidelmann8.32"&gt;P.

'''Bio-inspired robotic locomotion''' is a fairly new subcategory of bio-inspired design. It is about learning concepts from nature and applying them to the design of real-world engineered systems. More specifically, this field is about making robots that are inspired by [[Biology|biological]] systems. [[Biomimicry]] and bio-inspired design are sometimes confused. Biomimicry is copying the nature while bio-inspired design is learning from nature and making a mechanism that is simpler and more effective than the system observed in nature. Biomimicry has led to the development of a different branch of robotics called [[soft robotics]]. The biological systems have been optimized for specific tasks according to their habitat. However, they are multifunctional and are not designed for only one specific functionality. Bio-inspired robotics is about studying biological systems, and look for the mechanisms that may solve a problem in the engineering field. The designer should then try to simplify and enhance that mechanism for the specific task of interest. Bio-inspired [[roboticists]] are usually interested in biosensors (e.g. [[eye]]), bioactuators (e.g. [[muscle]]), or biomaterials (e.g. [[spider silk]]). Most of the robots have some type of locomotion system. Thus, in this article different modes of [[animal locomotion]] and few examples of the corresponding bio-inspired robots are introduced.

==Biolocomotion==
Biolocomotion or animal locomotion is usually categorized as below:

===Locomotion on a surface===
Locomotion on a surface may include [[terrestrial locomotion]] and [[arboreal locomotion]]. We will specifically discuss about [[terrestrial locomotion]] in detail in the next section.

[[Image:Big-eared-townsend-fledermaus.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Big eared townsend bat (''Corynorhinus townsendii'')]]

===Locomotion in a fluid===
Locomotion in a blood stream [[heart failure|swimming]] and [[flying and gliding animals|flying]]. There are many [[Aquatic locomotion|swimming]] and [[flying and gliding animals|flying]] robots designed and built by roboticists.&lt;ref name="flyingbot"&gt;R. Fearing, S. Avadhanula, D. Campolo, M. Sitti, J. Jan, and R. Wood, "A micromechanical flying insect thorax," Neurotechnology for Biomimetic Robots, pp. 469–480, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="swimmingbot"&gt;G. Dudek, M. Jenkin, C.

Ripsman, et al., "A visually guided swimming robot," in IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, IROS, pp. 3604–3609, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="swimmingbot2"&gt;A. Alessi, A. Sudano, D. Accoto, E.

IEEE.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behavioral classification (terrestrial locomotion)==
There are many animal and insects moving on land with or without legs. We will discuss legged and limbless locomotion in this section as well as climbing and jumping. Anchoring the feet is fundamental to locomotion on land. The ability to increase traction is important for slip-free motion on surfaces such as smooth rock faces and ice, and is especially critical for moving uphill. Numerous biological mechanisms exist for providing purchase: claws rely upon friction-based mechanisms; gecko feet upon van der walls forces; and some insect feet upon fluid-mediated adhesive forces.&lt;ref name="animal locomotion"&gt;R. M. Alexander, Principles of animal locomotion. Princeton University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Rhex.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Rhex: a Reliable Hexapedal Robot]]

===Legged locomotion===
Legged robots may have one,&lt;ref name="hoppingrobot"&gt;M. H. Raibert, H. B. Brown, "Experiments in balance with a 2D one-legged hopping machine," ASME Journal of Dynamic Systems, Measurement, and Control, pp75-81, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1leg"&gt;M. Ahmadi and M. Buehler, "Stable control of a simulated one-legged running robot with hip and leg compliance," IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation, vol. 13, no. 1, pp. 96– 104, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1leg_2"&gt;P. Gregorio, M. Ahmadi, and M. Buehler, "Design, control, and energetics of an electrically actuated legged robot," IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B: Cybernetics, vol. 27, no. 4, pp. 626–634, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; two,&lt;ref name="2leg"&gt;R. Niiyama, A. Nagakubo, and Y. Kuniyoshi, "Mowgli: A bipedal jumping and landing robot with an artificial musculoskeletal system," in IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, pp. 2546–2551, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; four,&lt;ref name="4leg"&gt;M. Raibert, K. Blankespoor, G. Nelson, R. Playter, et al., "Bigdog, the rough-terrain quadruped robot," in Proceedings of the 17th World Congress, pp. 10823–10825, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; six,&lt;ref name="Rhex"/&gt;&lt;ref name="isprawl1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="isprawl2"/&gt; or many legs&lt;ref name="manyleg"&gt;S. Wakimoto, K. Suzumori, T. Kanda, et al., "A bio-mimetic amphibious soft cord robot," Transactions of the Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers Part C, vol. 18, no. 2, pp. 471–477, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; depending on the application. One of the main advantages of using legs instead of wheels is moving on uneven environment more effectively. [[Bipedalism|Bipedal]], [[Quadrupedalism|quadrupedal]], and hexapedal locomotion are among the most favorite types of legged locomotion in the field of bio-inspired robotics. [[Rhex]], a Reliable Hexapedal robot&lt;ref name="Rhex"&gt;U. Saranli, M. Buehler, and D. Koditschek, "Rhex: A simple and highly mobile hexapod robot," The International Journal of Robotics Research, vol. 20, no. 7, pp. 616–631, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; and Cheetah&lt;ref name="Cheetah"&gt;Y. Li, B. Li, J. Ruan, and X. Rong, "Research of mammal bionic quadruped robots: A review," in Robotics, IEEE Conference on Automation and Mechatronics, pp. 166–171, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  are the two fastest running robots so far. iSprawl is another hexapedal robot inspired by [[cockroach]] locomotion that has been developed at Stanford University.&lt;ref name="isprawl1"&gt;J. Clark, J. Cham, S. Bailey, E. Froehlich, P. Nahata, M. Cutkosky, et al., "Biomimetic design and fabrication of a hexapedal running robot," in Robotics and Automation, 2001. Proceedings 2001 ICRA. IEEE International Conference on, vol. 4, pp. 3643–3649, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; This robot can run up to 15 body length per second and can achieve speeds of up to 2.3&amp;nbsp;m/s. The original version of this robot was pneumatically driven while the new generation uses a single electric motor for locomotion.&lt;ref name="isprawl2"&gt;S. Kim, J. Clark, and M. Cutkosky, "isprawl: Design and tuning for high-speed autonomous open-loop running," The International Journal of Robotics Research, vol. 25, no. 9, pp. 903– 912, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limbless locomotion===
Terrain involving topography over a range of length scales can be challenging for most organisms and biomimetic robots. Such terrain are easily passed over by limbless organisms such as snakes. Several animals and insects including [[worm]]s, [[snail]]s, [[caterpillar]]s, and [[snake]]s are capable of limbless locomotion. A review of snake-like robots is presented by Hirose et al.&lt;ref name="snakebook"&gt;S. Hirose, P. Cave, and C. Goulden, Biologically inspired robots: snake- like locomotors and manipulators, vol. 64. Oxford University Press Oxford, UK, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; These robots can be categorized as robots with passive or active wheels, robots with active treads, and undulating robots using vertical waves or linear expansions. Most snake-like robots use wheels, which are high in friction when moving side to side but low in friction when rolling forward (and can be prevented from rolling backward). The majority of snake-like robots use either [[Undulatory locomotion|lateral undulation]] or [[rectilinear locomotion]] and have difficulty climbing vertically. Choset has recently developed a modular robot that can mimic several snake gaits, but it cannot perform [[Concertina movement|concertina motion]].&lt;ref name="snakebot1"&gt;R. Hatton and H. Choset, "Generating gaits for snake robots: annealed chain fitting and keyframe wave extraction," Autonomous Robots, vol. 28, no. 3, pp. 271–281, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers at Georgia Tech have recently developed two snake-like robots called Scalybot. The focus of these robots is on the role of snake ventral scales on adjusting the frictional properties in different directions. These robots can actively control their scales to modify their frictional properties and move on a variety of surfaces efficiently.&lt;ref name="scalybot"&gt;H. Marvi, G. Meyers, G. Russell, D. Hu, "Scalybot: a Snake-inspired Robot with Active Frictional Anisotropy," ASME Dynamic Systems and Control Conference, Arlington, VA, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers at CMU have developed both scaled&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/story/snakelike-skin-gives-a-robot-the-power-to-crawl/ SNAKELIKE SKIN GIVES A ROBOT THE POWER TO CRAWL]&lt;/ref&gt; and conventional actuated snake-like robots.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/story/this-robot-snake-means-you-no-harm-really/ THIS ROBOT SNAKE MEANS YOU NO HARM, REALLY]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{further|Snakebot}}

===Climbing===
Climbing is an especially difficult task because mistakes made by the climber may cause the climber to lose its grip and fall. Most robots have been built around a single functionality observed in their biological counterparts. Geckobots&lt;ref name="geckobot"&gt;O. Unver, A. Uneri, A. Aydemir, and M. Sitti, "Geckobot: a gecko inspired climbing robot using elastomer adhesives," in International Conference on Robotics and Automation, pp. 2329–2335, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; typically use van der waals forces that work only on smooth surfaces. Stickybots,&lt;ref name="stickybot1"&gt;S. Kim, M. Spenko, S. Trujillo, B. Heyneman, D. Santos, and M. Cutkosky, "Smooth vertical surface climbing with directional adhesion," IEEE Transactions on Robotics, vol. 24, no. 1, pp. 65–74, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stickybot2"&gt;S. Kim, M. Spenko, S. Trujillo, B. Heyneman, V. Mattoli, and M. Cutkosky, "Whole body adhesion: hierarchical, directional and distributed control of adhesive forces for a climbing robot," in IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, pp. 1268–1273, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stickybot3"&gt;D. Santos, B. Heyneman, S. Kim, N. Esparza, and M. Cutkosky, "Gecko-inspired climbing behaviors on vertical and overhanging surfaces," in IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, pp. 1125–1131, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stickybot4"&gt;A. Asbeck, S. Dastoor, A. Parness, L. Fullerton, N. Esparza, D. Soto, B. Heyneman, and M. Cutkosky, "Climbing rough vertical surfaces with hierarchical directional adhesion," in IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, pp. 2675–2680, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and&lt;ref name="climbing_gait"&gt;S. Trujillo, B. Heyneman, and M. Cutkosky, "Constrained convergent gait regulation for a climbing robot," in IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, pp. 5243–5249, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; use directional dry adhesives that works best on smooth surfaces. Spinybot&lt;ref name="spinybot"&gt;A. Asbeck, S. Kim, M. Cutkosky, W. Provancher, M. Lanzetta, "Scaling hard vertical surfaces with compliant microspine arrays," The International Journal of Robotics Research, Vol.25, No. 12, pp. 1165-1179, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and the RiSE&lt;ref name="rise"&gt;M. Spenko, G. Haynes, J. Saunders, M. Cutkosky, A. Rizzi, D. Koditschek, et al., "Biologically inspired climbing with a hexapedal robot," Journal of Field Robotics, vol. 25, no. 4-5, pp. 223– 242, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; robot are among the insect-like robots that use spines instead. Legged climbing robots have several limitations. They cannot handle large obstacles since they are not flexible and they require a wide space for moving. They usually cannot climb both smooth and rough surfaces or handle vertical to horizontal transitions as well.

===Jumping===
One of the tasks commonly performed by a variety of living organisms is [[jumping]]. [[Bharal]], [[hares]], [[kangaroo]], [[grasshopper]], [[flea]], and [[locust]] are among the best jumping animals. A miniature 7g jumping robot inspired by [[locust]] has been developed at EPFL that can jump up to 138&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref name="jumpingbot"&gt;M. Kovac, M. Fuchs, A. Guignard, J. Zufferey, and D. Floreano, "A miniature 7g jumping robot," in IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, pp. 373–378, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The jump event is induced by releasing the tension of a spring. The highest jumping miniature robot is inspired by the locust, weighs 23 grams with its highest jump to 365 cm is "TAUB" (Tel-Aviv University and Braude College of engineering).&lt;ref name="TAUB"&gt;V. Zaitsev, O. Gvirsman, U. Ben Hanan, A. Weiss, A. Ayali and G. Kosa, "A locust-inspired miniature jumping robot," in Bioinspiration &amp; biomimetics, 10(6), p.066012.&lt;/ref&gt; It uses torsion springs as energy storage and includes a wire and latch mechanism to compress and release the springs. ETH Zurich has reported a soft jumping robot based on the combustion of [[methane]] and [[laughing gas]].&lt;ref name="combustion-driven soft robot"&gt;M. Loepfe, C.M. Schumacher, U.B. Lustenberger, and W.J. Stark, "An Untethered, Jumping Roly-Poly Soft Robot Driven by Combustion," Soft Robotics, Vol. 2, No. 1, pp. 33-41, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The thermal gas expansion inside the soft combustion chamber drastically increases the chamber volume. This causes the 2&amp;nbsp;kg robot to jump up to 20&amp;nbsp;cm. The soft robot inspired by a [[roly-poly toy]] then reorientates itself into an upright position after landing.

==Morphological classification==

===Modular===
[[Image:HONDA ASIMO.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Honda Asimo: A Humanoid robot]]
The modular robots are typically capable of performing several tasks and are specifically useful for search and rescue or exploratory missions. Some of the featured robots in this category include a [[salamander]] inspired robot developed at EPFL that can walk and swim,&lt;ref name="salamander robot"&gt;A. J. Ijspeert, A. Crespi, D. Ryczko and J.-M. Cabelguen, "From swimming to walking with a salamander robot driven by a spinal cord model," Science, vol. 315, num. 5817, p. 1416-1420, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; a [[snake]] inspired robot developed at [[Carnegie-Mellon University]] that has four different modes of terrestrial locomotion,&lt;ref name="snakebot1"/&gt; and a [[cockroach]] inspired robot can run and climb on a variety of complex terrain.&lt;ref name="Rhex"/&gt;

===Humanoid===
Humanoid robots are robots that look human-like or are inspired by the human form. There are many different types of humanoid robots for applications such as personal assistance, reception, work at industries, or companionship. These type of robots are used for research purposes as well and were originally developed to build better orthosis and prosthesis for human beings. Petman is one of the first and most advanced humanoid robots developed at Boston Dynamics. Some of the humanoid robots such as Honda Asimo are over actuated.&lt;ref name="hondahumanoid"&gt;K. Hirer, M. Hirose, Y. Haikawa, and T. Takenaka, "The development of honda humanoid robot," in IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, vol. 2, pp. 1321–1326, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, there are some humanoid robots like the robot developed at Cornell University that do not have any actuators and walk passively descending a shallow slope.&lt;ref name="passivewalking"&gt;S. Collins, M. Wisse, and A. Ruina, "A three-dimensional passive-dynamic walking robot with two legs and knees," The International Journal of Robotics Research, vol. 20, no. 7, pp. 607–615, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Swarming===
[[Collective animal behavior|The collective behavior of animals]] has been of interest to researchers for several years. [[Ant]]s can make structures like rafts to survive on the rivers. [[Fish]] can sense their environment more effectively in large groups. [[Swarm robotics]] is a fairly new field and the goal is to make robots that can work together and transfer the data, make structures as a group, etc.&lt;ref name="swarmrobotic"&gt;E. S ̧ahin, "Swarm robotics: From sources of inspiration to domains of application," Swarm Robotics, pp. 10–20, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soft===

Soft robotics: Biological inspiration, state of the art, and future research. Applied Bionics and Biomechanics, 5(3), 99-117.&lt;/ref&gt; are robots composed entirely of soft materials and moved through pneumatic pressure, similar to an [[octopus]] or [[starfish]]. Such robots are flexible enough to move in very limited spaces (such as in the human body). The first multigait soft robots was developed in 2011&lt;ref name="softrobotic"&gt;R. Shepherd, F. Ilievski, W. Choi, S. Morin, A. Stokes, A. Mazzeo, X. Chen, M. Wang, and G. Whitesides, "Multigait soft robot," Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, vol. 108, no. 51, pp. 20400–20403, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and the first fully integrated, independent soft robot (with soft batteries and control systems) was developed in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Pneumatic Octopus is first soft, solo robot|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-37169109|publisher=BBC|accessdate=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[paraphilia]],&lt;!-- NOTE: The lead starts with "As a paraphilia" to better distinguish the paraphilia aspect from the normal attraction aspect; see Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Lead section#First sentence. --&gt; '''breast fetishism''' (also known as '''mastofact''', '''breast partialism''', or '''mazophilia''')&lt;ref&gt;Hickey, Eric W. (2003). Encyclopaedia of Murder and Violent Crime. Sage Publications Inc. {{ISBN|0-7619-2437-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a highly atypical [[sexual interest]] focused on female [[breast]]s (see [[partialism]]).&lt;ref name="DSM-5"&gt;{{cite book|last=Association|first=American Psychiatric|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders American Psychiatric Association - 5th edition. |year=2013|publisher=[[American Psychiatric Publishing]]|location=Arlington|isbn=978-0890425558|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''breast fetishism'' is also used in the non-paraphilic sense, to refer to cultural attention to female breasts and the [[sexuality]] they represent, with debate existing as to whether the modern widespread fascination with breasts among [[heterosexual]] males in western societies is a [[sexual fetishism|sexual fetish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Latteier|1998|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific explanation==
Scientists have hypothesized that non-[[paraphilic]] sexual attraction to breasts is the result of their function as a [[secondary sex characteristic]]. For instance, [[zoologist]] and [[ethologist]] [[Desmond Morris]] theorizes that cleavage is a sexual signal that imitates the image of the [[Buttock cleavage|cleft between the buttocks]], which according to Morris in ''[[The Naked Ape]]'' is also unique to humans, other primates as a rule having much flatter buttocks.&lt;ref&gt;Desmond Morris. ''Manwatching. A Field Guide to Human Behavior.''. New York: Harry N. Abrams, Inc., 1977. {{ISBN|0-8109-1310-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Evolutionary psychology|Evolutionary psychologists]] theorize that humans' permanently enlarged breasts, in contrast to other [[primate]]s' breasts, which only enlarge during [[ovulation]], allows human females to "solicit [human] male attention and investment even when they are not really fertile".&lt;ref name=Crawford1998 &gt;{{citation |last=Crawford |first=Charles |year=1998 | title=''Handbook of evolutionary psychology : ideas, issues, and applications'' |chapter=How Mate Choice Shaped Human Nature |last2=Krebs|first2=Dennis |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |isbn=9780805816662}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reverence and theorizing shown to breasts also appears in the science of modern civilization. Breast fetishism is claimed to be an example of a contagious thought (or [[meme]]) spreading throughout society, and that breasts are features that have evolved to influence human sexuality rather than serve an exclusive maternal function.&lt;ref&gt;Marsden, Paul. (1999). Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation. [http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/2/2/review4.html ''Review of Thought Contagion: How Belief Spreads through Society''.] Retrieved 2007-10-05.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In clinical literature of the 19th century, the sexual focus on breasts was considered a form of paraphillia, but, in modern times, this attraction is considered normal unless it is highly atypical and is therefore a form of [[partialism]].&lt;ref name="DSM-5"/&gt;

==Alternative opinions==
The term ''breast fetishism'' is also used within [[ethnographic]] and feminist contexts to describe a society with a culture devoted to breasts, usually as sexual objects.&lt;ref name="ggf2003"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Phil. (1989). ''Motivation and Emotion''. Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-01475-1}}, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Feminism|feminists]] have argued that incidences of breast fetishism have been found going back to the [[neolithic]] era, with the goddess shrines of [[Catal Huyuk]] (in modern [[Turkey]]). The archaeological excavations of the town in c. 1960 revealed the walls of the shrine(s) adorned with disembodied pairs of breasts that appeared to have "an existence of their own". [[Elizabeth Gould Davis]] argues that breasts (along with [[phallus]]es) were revered by the women of [[Catal Huyuk]] as instruments of motherhood, but it was after what she describes as a patriarchal revolution – when men had appropriated both phallus worship and "the breast fetish" for themselves – that these organs "acquired the erotic significance with which they are now endowed".&lt;ref&gt;''The First Sex: The Breast Fetish'' (1971) by Davis, Elizabeth Gould. Penguin Books, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors from the United States have made the statement that attraction to the female breast is a sexual fetish, that it is the American fetish-object of choice,&lt;ref&gt;''Pornography and Sexual Representation: A Reference Guide'' (2000) by Slade, Joseph W. Greenwood Publishing Group. {{ISBN|978-0-313-31520-6}}, p. 402.&lt;/ref&gt; and that breast fetishism is predominantly found in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Laura. (2006). ''Beauty Up: Exploring Contemporary Japanese Body Aesthetics''. p. 74. University of California Press. {{ISBN|978-0-520-24509-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Latteier|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, D. E., &amp; Holden, C. P. (1971).

==Cultural and historical background==
[[File:Venus von Willendorf 01.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Upper Paleolithic]] [[Venus figurines]] may have been forms of erotic art, or fertility icons. Shown here is the [[Venus of Willendorf]], 28,000 [[Before Common Era|B.C.E]] – 25,000 B.C.E.]]
There is a widespread fascination with women's breasts, and especially their size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yeung|first1=Peter|title=The female artists reclaiming their bodies|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/22316/1/the-female-artists-reclaiming-their-bodies|website=Dazed|accessdate=20 November 2014|quote=The fetishisation of womens’ bodies and their regular reduction to breasts is something that New York artist Cindy Hinant is acutely aware of}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern female fashions which focus on tight clothing and the display of [[Cleavage (breasts)|cleavage]] have been attributed to the increase in breast fetishism.&lt;ref name="ggf2003"&gt;{{harvnb|Glazier|Flowerday|2003|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people in [[Western culture]], both male and female, consider breasts an important female [[secondary sex characteristic]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/ATLAS_EN/html/secondary_characteristics.html secondary sex characteristics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927075821/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/ATLAS_EN/html/secondary_characteristics.html |date=2011-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an important aspect of [[femininity]], and many women use [[décolletage]] or a low neckline that exposes cleavage as part of their [[physical attractiveness|physical]] and [[sexual attractiveness]].

Display of cleavage with a low neckline is often regarded as a form of feminine [[flirting]] or [[seduction]], as well as [[aesthetic]] or [[erotic]]. Most men derive [[erotic pleasure]] from seeing a woman's breasts,&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Kinsey|Kinsey, Alfred C.]] et al. ''[[Sexual Behavior in the Human Male]]''.  Saunders, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; and some people derive pleasure in their female partner exposing cleavage. When cleavage is enhanced with a push-up bra or exposed by a low neckline it may draw attention.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Ted Eisenberg and Joyce K. Eisenberg, ''The Scoop on Breasts: A Plastic Surgeon Busts the Myths'', Incompra Press, 2012, {{ISBN|9780985724931}}&lt;/ref&gt; During adolescence, some girls become obsessed with [[body image]] including breast size and shape.&lt;ref name=Ashlea&gt;Ashlea Worrel, ''An Examination of Women's Body Image and Sexual Satisfaction'', page 15, ProQuest, 2008, {{ISBN|9780549651444}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[South Africa]], [[Wonderbra]] sponsors a [[National Cleavage Day]] during which women are encouraged to display their cleavage.&lt;ref name=WONDERBRA&gt;[https://archive.is/20070406222144/http://www.wonderbra.co.za/nationalcleavageday.aspx "National Cleavage Day"] on Wonderbra.co.za&lt;/ref&gt;

In Western and some other societies, there are differences of opinion as to how much cleavage exposure is acceptable in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Salmansohn |first=Karen |title=The Power of Cleavage |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/karen-salmansohn/the_power_of_cleavage_b_70260.html  |publisher=The Huffington Post |date=October 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contemporary Western society, the extent to which a woman may expose her breasts depends on social and cultural context. Displaying cleavage or any part of female breast may be considered inappropriate or even prohibited by [[dress code]]s in some settings, such as workplaces, churches, and schools, while in some spaces showing as much cleavage as possible can be permissible or even encouraged. The exposure of [[nipple]]s or [[areolae]] is almost always considered [[toplessness]], considered by some to be [[modesty|immodest]] and in some instances as [[lewd]] or [[indecent exposure|indecent]] behavior.&lt;ref&gt;D. Leder, ''The Body in Medical Thought and Practice'', page 223, Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 1992, {{ISBN|9780792316572}}&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian [[James Laver]] argued that the changing standards of revealing cleavage is more prominent in evening wear than in day wear in the Western world.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Michael ''Fashion classics from Carlyle to Barthes'', page 732, Berg Publishers, 2003, {{ISBN|1-85973-606-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film producers such as [[Russ Meyer]] produced films which featured actresses with large breasts. ''[[Lorna (film)|Lorna]]'' (1964) was the first of his films where the main female part, played by [[Lorna Maitland]], was selected on the basis of breast size. Other large breasted actresses used by Meyer include [[Kitten Natividad]], [[Erica Gavin]], [[Tura Satana]], and [[Uschi Digard]] among many others. The majority of them were naturally large breasted and he occasionally cast women in their first trimesters of pregnancy to enhance their breast size even further.&lt;ref name=russmeyer&gt;{{cite book |last1=Meyer |first1=Russ |others=(Under the pseudonym "Adolph Albion Schwartz") |year=2000 | title=''A Clean Breast: The Life and Loves of Russ Meyer'' (3 volume set) |publisher=Hauck Pub Co |location=El Rio, TX |isbn=0-9621797-2-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author and director [[William Rotsler]] said: "with ''Lorna'' Meyer established the formula that made him rich and famous, the formula of people filmed at top hate, top lust, top heavy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= McDonough, Jimmy|year=2005| title=''Big bosoms and square jaws : the biography of Russ Meyer, king of the sex film'' | publisher=Jonathan Cape | location=London | isbn=0-224-07250-1}}, p.138&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Heckrund4.JPG|thumb|[[Heck cattle]] have been bred to resemble the aurochs in the 1920s. Since they are regarded as not meeting the criteria for "new aurochs", recent efforts such as the [[TaurOs Project]] and [[Uruz Project]] attempt to get considerably closer to the wild aurochs.]]
[[File:Steppentarpan.jpg|thumb|[[Heck horse]] in [[Haselünne]], [[Germany]].]]

'''Breeding back''' is a form of [[artificial selection]] by the deliberate [[selective breeding]] of [[domestication|domestic]] animals, in an attempt to achieve an animal breed with a [[phenotype]] that resembles a [[wildtype]] ancestor, usually one that is [[extinction|extinct]] in its wild form. Breeding back is not to be confused with [[dedomestication]].

It must be kept in mind that a breeding-back breed may be very similar to the extinct wild type in phenotype, ecological niche, and to some extent genetics, but the initial [[gene pool]] of that wild type is lost forever with its [[extinction]]. It is not truly possible for a breeding back attempt to actually recreate an extinct wild type that is the breeding target, as an extinct wild type cannot be resurrected via selective breeding alone. Furthermore, even the outward authenticity of a bred-back type depends on the quality of the stock used as the foundation of the project. As a result, some breeds, like [[Heck cattle]], are at best a vague look-alike of the extinct wildtype [[aurochs]], according to the literature.&lt;ref name="vanVuure"&gt;Cis van Vuure: Retracing the Aurochs – History, Morphology and Ecology of an extinct wild Ox. 2005. {{ISBN|954-642-235-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
[[File:Rebuilding a Species.ogv|thumb|left|[[VOA]] report about the Quagga Project]]
It is the target of breeding back to restore the wild traits that may have been preserved in domestic animals within one breeding lineage. Commonly, not only the phenotype but also the ecological capacity are considered in breeding back projects, because hardy breeding back results are used in certain [[Conservation movement|conservation]] projects. In nature, usually only individuals suited to the natural circumstances can survive and reproduce, while humans select those with additional attractive, docile or productive characteristics. Therefore, selection criteria in nature versus those in domestic conditions are different and domesticated animals often differ significantly in [[phenotype]], behaviour and [[genetics]] from their wild forerunners. It is the target of breeding back to re-create the wild traits that may have been preserved in domestic animals within one breeding lineage.

In many cases, the extinct wild type ancestors of a given species are known only through skeletons and, in some cases, historical descriptions, so their phenotype is not directly accessible. Therefore, there is no certainty of success with a breeding back attempt and the results must be reviewed with caution. In order to test genetic closeness, both [[mitochondrial DNA]] and [[nuclear DNA]] have to be accessible. However, success is possible: humans selected only for superficial characters and as a rule did not change inner mechanisms such as digestion.&lt;ref name="vanVuure"/&gt;  Further, since many domestic animals show a behaviour that is derived from their wild ancestors (such as the herding instinct of [[cattle]] or the social instincts of [[dog]]s), and are fit to survive under natural circumstances, as evidenced by the many [[feral]] populations of many domestic animals, it can be presumed that back-bred animals will function like their wild ancestors.&lt;ref name="vanVuure"/&gt;  For example, food choice should be the same in domestic and wild types. [[Natural selection]] could serve as an additional tool in creating authentic robustness, behaviour and maybe also phenotype. For large herbivores, a sufficient predator population would also be necessary to support such a process, but this predator population is largely not present in today's [[Europe]], where many breeding back projects are conducted.

There is a difference between creating a look-alike breed from domestic animals and creating a look-alike via artificial selection of individuals of a different species or subspecies that may resemble the animal that is targeted. 

For example, the [[Quagga Project]] is trying to breed animals which strongly resemble the original [[Quagga]] of South Africa.  The quagga was a subspecies of the [[plains zebra]] and has no descendants.  Accordingly, the Project is limited to selecting for the physical appearance of the original, as illustrated by twenty three mounted specimens, contemporary paintings and written accounts.    

However, the two most noticeable characteristics of the quagga, fewer stripes and darker pelage, are frequently observed to varying degrees in wild plains zebra populations.  Animals with these characteristic are included in the Quagga Project breeding programme.  

After nearly thirty years of selective breeding, to concentrate these characteristics, recent foals show a marked resemblance to the original.

== Use ==

Bred-back breeds are interesting for [[conservation biology]] since they may fill an ecological gap that has been left due to the extinction of the wildtypes due to hunting by humans. As long as food choice, behaviour, robustness, defence against predators, hunting or foraging instincts and phenotype are the same as in the wild type, it will function like it in the wilderness. Releasing such animals into the wild would fill the previously empty niche and allows a natural dynamic between the species of the ecosystem to re-evolve. However, breeding-back attempts do not always result in an animal that is closer to the wild type than other domestic breeds. For example, Heck cattle bear less resemblance to the aurochs than many Iberian fighting cattle do.&lt;ref name="vanVuure"/&gt;

== Examples==

=== Aurochs ===
Ideas for creating an [[aurochs]]-like animal from domestic cattle have been around since 1835. In the 1920s, [[Heinz Heck|Heinz]] and [[Lutz Heck]] tried to breed a look-alike using central European dairy breeds and southern European cattle. The result, Heck cattle, are hardy, but differ from the aurochs in many respects, although a resemblance in colour and sometimes also horns has been achieved.&lt;ref name="vanVuure"/&gt; From 1996 onwards, Heck cattle have been crossed with primitive Iberian breeds like [[Sayaguesa Cattle]] and Fighting cattle, and the very large Italian breed [[Chianina]] in a number of German reserves in order to enhance the resemblance to the aurochs. The results are called [[Taurus cattle]], which are larger and more long-legged than Heck cattle and have a more aurochs-like horn shape. Another project to achieve a type of cattle that resembles the aurochs is [[TaurOs Project]], using primitive and hardy southern European breeds and also Scottish [[Highland cattle]]. These Tauros cattle are planned to be established in various European natural reserves.

=== European wild horse ===
The Polish [[Konik]] horse is often erroneously considered the result of a breeding-back experiment to "recreate" the [[phenotype]] of the [[Tarpan]], the European [[wild horse]]. The Konik is actually a hardy [[landrace]] breed originating in Poland which was called ''Panje horse'' before agriculturist [[Tadeusz Vetulani]] coined the name "Konik" in the 1920s. Vetulani did start an experiment trying to reconstruct the Tarpan using Koniks, but his stock only had a minor contribution to the modern Konik population.&lt;ref name="DPK"&gt;Tadeusz Jezierski, Zbigniew Jaworski: ''Das Polnische Konik. Die Neue Brehm-Bücherei Bd. 658'', Westarp Wissenschaften, Hohenwarsleben 2008, {{ISBN|3-89432-913-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, during World War II, the Heck brothers crossed Koniks with [[Przewalski's horse]]s and also other ponies like [[Icelandic horse]]s and [[Gotland pony|Gotland ponies]]; the result is now called the [[Heck Horse]]. During the last decades, Heck horses have continuously been crossed with Koniks, so that their phenotype now is nearly indistinguishable, except that the Heck horse has a slenderer build on average.&lt;ref name="Weiden"&gt;Bunzel-Drüke, Finck, Kämmer, Luick, Reisinger, Riecken, Riedl, Scharf &amp; Zimball: ''"Wilde Weiden: Praxisleitfaden für Ganzjahresbeweidung in Naturschutz und Landschaftsentwicklung''&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the Konik-type horses, the [[Exmoor Pony]] that still lives in a [[semi-feral]] state in some parts of Southern England has also been claimed to be closer to the European wild horse as it carries [[pangare]] coloration and has a resemblance to the horses in [[Lascaux]] [[cave paintings]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurowildlife.org/news/wild-horses-for-europe–-which-breed-is-the-best/ ''European Wildlife'']&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wolf ===
[[File:Tamaskan.jpg|thumb|A [[Tamaskan Dog]], bred to visually resemble a wolf.]]
Although the [[wolf]], the wild ancestor of domestic dogs, is not extinct, its phenotype is the target of several developmental breeds including the [[Northern Inuit Dog]] and the [[Tamaskan Dog]]. They are all crossbreeds of [[German Shepherd]]s, [[Alaskan Malamutes]] and [[husky|huskies]], selected for phenotypic wolf characteristics. Therefore, these breeds are breeding-back attempts as well.&lt;ref&gt;C. Gamborg et al: ''[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/whp/ev/2010/00000019/00000001/art00005 De-Domestication: Ethics at the Intersection of Landscape Restoration and Animal Welfare] In: ''Environmental Values'' 2010, 19(1):57-78&lt;/ref&gt;

Although extinct, [[Japanese wolf]] DNA survives in the modern domestic [[Shikoku Inu]]. It is thought that crossing this breed with some subspecies of [[Asian Wolf]] would result in a authentic analogue to fill the ecological niche left by the absence of the apex predator.

The Dire Wolf Project, started in 1988, concerns the [[dire wolf]], an extinct prehistoric wolf, and aims to bring it back by breeding different dog breeds that resemble it.

'''Burra Katha''', also spelled Burrakatha, is an [[oral storytelling]] technique in the [[Katha (storytelling format)|Katha]] tradition, performed in villages of [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Telangana]]. The troupe consists of one main performer and two co-performers. It is a narrative entertainment that consists of prayers, solo drama, dance, songs, poems and jokes. The topic will be either a [[Hindu]] mythological story ([[Jangam|Jangam Katha]]) or a contemporary social issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Burrakatha loses sheen sans patronage| url = http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-01-14/visakhapatnam/36332535_1_artistes-burrakatha-art-form |date=Jan 14, 2013| accessdate = 2013-09-02
| publisher = [[The Times of India]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
Burra - Katha was developed in Guntur district around 1942 with the aim of propagating political ideas among illiterate masses in villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g4U5AAAAIAAJ|title=Vidya Bharathi|last=Lectures|first=Bangalore University Dept of Publications and Extension|date=1977-01-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The communists with the help of Andhra Praja Natya Mandali founded by Mikkilineni Radhakrishna Murthy in Bezawada spread the message to the masses in the Naizam region during the rebellion against Nizam in the 1940s.

==Etymology==
"Burra" is referred to [[Tanpura|tambura]], a musical string instrument with a hollow shell. "Katha" means story.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Burrakatha.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Burrakatha photo from Vepachedu research foundation]] --&gt;
Burra means a skull in [[Telugu language|Telugu]]. The shell resembles a [[human skull]]. It is made of baked clay or dried pumpkin, or of brass and copper. The instrument looks very similar to [[veena]] and the performer can pull and press strings to get music.

==Alternative names==
Burrakatha refers to the art throughout [[Andhra Pradesh]], and there are local names in each region.
* Coastal region: Tamboora or Jangam or Tandanana Katha
* Rayalaseema: Tamboora or Tandana katha or suddulu
* Telangana: Tamboora or Sarada katha

==History==
Burrakatha started as devotional songs of nomadic people and became a popular art form. It is played on radio and TV regularly in [[Andhra Pradesh]]. It is a 20th-century name for the theater show known as [[Jangam]] Katha. The [[jangam|jangams lingayats]] were wandering minstrels who worshiped and sang of [[Shiva|Lord Siva]]. Two performers participated in these plays: the storyteller and his wife. With societal and cultural changes, the secular aspect was incorporated into this form. The modern form has three performers of any gender.

Popular Hindu artists were Pendyala Venkateswarrao, Sunkara Sri Krishna Madhava Rao, Paruchuri Ramakotayya, Sirivisetti Subbarao, Kosuri Punnayya, Govardhana, Kakumanu Subbarao, Davuluru, Chintalal Suryanarayana, Budagajangala mote papaiah, Budagajangala mote kullayappa, Budagajangala mote ramalingam, etc. Women also formed groups, e.g., Moturi Udayam, Chintala Koteswaramma, Mahankali Lakshmi, Sridevi sisters, etc. Popular non-Hindu artists are Abraham Bhagavatar, Manohara Kavi, Khader Khan Sahib, Shaik Nazar etc.

==Modern form==
The main storyteller (kathakudu) narrates the story. He plays tambura and dances to music. He also wears a metal ring called an andelu on his right thumb, holds another ring in his other hand and adds more music by colliding them frequently.  The co-performers plays gummeta (also called dakki or budike), earthen drums with two heads. All three or only the kathakadu wear anklets (also called as gajjelu), which add even more music when they dance.

The right side performer (hasyaka, meaning joker) acts as a joker and cracks satires and jokes. The left side performer (rajakiya, meaning politician) acts as someone who knows worldly ways and talks about politics and social issues. The main performer and co-performers constantly was address each other. The co-performers interrupt the kathakudu with doubts, and they sometimes add emphasis to the main events in the story with short words similar to "Wow!" "Aha!" and "That is it."

Whenever the main performer sings a song, he or she starts with "vinara veera kumara veera gadha vinara" followed by the co-performers singing "tandhana tane tandhana na." It is also called 'tandana katha.'

==Significance==
Burra katha was a pastime event in villages. It is seen even now during [[Navratri|Dussehra]] or [[Sankranti]] festival seasons to describe events in epics like [[Ramayan]] and [[Mahabharat]] and also some of best and moral stories of kings like kambojaraju katha, chinnamma katha, muggurumoratila katha, etc.

It played an effective role in conveying message to people and awakening them during [[Indian Independence Movement]]. Burrakatha was banned in [[Madras]] by the British government and in [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]] kingdom by Nizam government, because it was the medium to enlighten the people of the political situation in political meetings.

==Present==
Burrakatha tellers are called as budagajangalu. Internet and movies play a major role in modern life.
That's why the burrakathas are not being seen and no one is there to develop this and improve the art.
In past these burrakatha tellers were important in the villages; now there is no response for their art.

So these burrakatha tellers left their traditional art and have become beggars or day labourers. Even in these modern times, there are no educated people in this tribe. They don't have caste certificates for developing their tribe.

[[Daroji Eramma]] was a performer of Burra katha from [[Karnataka]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16535">'''The Curriculum Open-Access Resources in Economics Project''' ('''CORE Project''') is an organisation that creates and distributes teaching material for [[economics]] curriculum reform. Its textbook is taught as an introductory course at more than 100 universities. It provides its materials online, at no cost to users. It is registered as a charity&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|title=CORE Economics Education|url=https://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityFramework.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1175143&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0|website=The Charity Commission|accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (CORE Economics Education) in England and Wales.

==Origins==

CORE was conceived in late 2012, by Professors [[Wendy Carlin]] of University college London and [[Samuel Bowles (economist)|Samuel Bowles]] of the Santa Fe Institute, and [[:es:Óscar_Landerretche_Moreno|Oscar Landerretche]], who at that time was Director of the School of Economics and Business of the University of Chile&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ineteconomics.org/research/experts/olanderretche|title=Oscar Landerretche|website=Institute for New Economic Thinking|language=en-us|access-date=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;. At the time, Professor Carlin wrote to colleagues to suggest they collaborate to revise the curriculum, noting that "altering the course of the undergraduate curriculum is like turning around a half a million ton super tanker. But I think that the time may be right for the initiative I am inviting you to join me in proposing."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rajivsethi.blogspot.co.uk/2014/09/the-core-project.html?spref=tw|title=The CORE Project|website=rajivsethi.blogspot.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Global economic crisis of 2008-09|global economic crisis of 2008]], students had formed groups, such as the [[International Student Initiative for Pluralist Economics]] (ISIPE) and [[Rethinking Economics]], to demand improvements to the mainstream economics curriculum. ISIPE, for example, argued that "teaching in economics departments is too narrowly focused and more effort should be made to broaden the curriculum"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Inman|first1=Philip|title=Economics students call for shakeup of the way their subject is taught|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/may/04/economics-students-overhaul-subject-teaching|accessdate=4 May 2018|publisher=The Guardian|date=4 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Professor Carlin has written that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The textbook model is definitely broken. In it, economic actors are amoral and self-interested, [[perfectly competitive]] market prices equate supply to demand implementing “optimal” outcomes, while [[environmental degradation]], [[instability]], and [[Inequality in economics|inequality]] are afterthoughts at best … Yet it continues as the backbone of much undergraduate teaching. However remote from what economists really do and the way we think, this is the “economics” imprinted on the public’s mind."&lt;ref name="CarlinProspect"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carlin|first1=Wendy|title=How a new economics syllabus is preparing students for the real-world economy|url=https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/new-economics-model-teaching-syllabus|publisher=Prospect Magazine|accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Launched in October 2013 at [[HM Treasury]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Rob|title=Institute for New Economic Thinking Launches Project to Reform Undergraduate Syllabus|url=https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/institute-for-new-economic-thinking-launches-project-to-reform-undergraduate-syllabus|website=Institute for New Economic Thinking|accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, CORE said its mission was to address these issues by creating a textbook incorporating contributions from many academics with different points of view that was "humbler, more empirical and more topical".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/f015a3ac-4aed-11e3-ac3d-00144feabdc0|title=‘Dismal science’ seeks fresh thinking after failure in crisis|date=2013-11-11|website=Financial Times|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Carlin wrote that students "are embarrassed when they are no more able to explain the eurozone crisis or persistent unemployment than their fellow students in engineering or archaeology", and that CORE would ensure that "digital technology and interactive teaching methods will introduce students to an [[Empirical research|empirical]] discipline. They will learn to use evidence from history, experiments and other data sources to test competing explanations and policies."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/74cd0b94-4de6-11e3-8fa5-00144feabdc0#axzz2kwVkkxys|title=Economics explains our world – but economics degrees don’t|last=Carlin|first=Wendy|date=17 November 2013|work=Financial Times|access-date=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Course material==

CORE's courses are offered through [[open access]] online [[E-book|ebooks]] published on [http://core-econ.org its web site]. Its ebooks use a [[Creative Commons]] license&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; so that "any user can customize, translate, or improve it for their own use or the use of their students."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===''The Economy''===

''[http://www.core-econ.org/the-economy/ The Economy]'' was designed as the source material for taught courses in the first year of an undergraduate degree, although it has also been used in schools, and for advanced courses in public policy. In 2017, a print version of ''The Economy'' was published by Oxford University Press.&lt;ref name="Economy book" /&gt;

===''Economy, Society and Public Policy (ESPP)''===

In 2018, CORE posted the first units of ''[http://www.core-econ.org/espp/ ESPP]'', an ebook designed to introduce the economics to non-specialists, particularly students from outside economics courses who were taking economics as a minor. Like ''The Economy'', it focuses on topics such as inequality, power, and environmental economics. ESPP is funded by the [[Nuffield Foundation]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/economy-society-and-public-policy-quantitative-economics-course-non-specialists-core-project|title=Economy, Society and Public Policy - new course from coreecon {{!}} Nuffield Foundation|website=www.nuffieldfoundation.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Doing Economics''===

Also in 2018, CORE posted the first beta units of ''[http://www.core-econ.org/doing-economics/ Doing Economics]'', a collection of empirical projects designed to teach [[Quantitative Methods|quantitative methods]] in economics using real-world data, also funded by the Nuffield Foundation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Structure and contributors==

CORE Economics Education is registered as a charity in England and Wales, with a board of trustees.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The day-to-day running of the project is based at [[University College London]].

==Differences from existing economics teaching==

CORE's authors claim that popular textbooks such as ''Principles of Economics'' by [[Greg Mankiw]] are little different in content to the first modern text book, ''[[Economics (textbook)|Economics]]'' by [[Paul Samuelson]], which was published in 1948.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://voxeu.org/article/new-paradigm-introductory-course-economics|title=A new paradigm for the introductory course in economics|last=Bowles|first=Samuel|last2=Carlin|first2=Wendy|date=2017-09-07|website=VoxEU.org|access-date=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;, meaning that these textbooks have ignored many of the innovations in economics since then:&lt;blockquote&gt;"What we teach [students] in our intro classes bears little resemblance to how we do economics ourselves. The great mid-20th century thinkers – [[John Maynard Keynes]], [[Friedrich Hayek]], and [[John Forbes Nash Jr.|John Nash]] – initiated a process that eventually transformed how we now understand the economy, in three ways. Only one of these [Keynes] made it into today's principles course."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;CORE argues that concepts developed in the second half of the 20th century, such as [[asymmetric information]], strategic [[social interactions]] and [[incomplete contracts]] should be given greater prominence in undergraduate teaching. It claims that in most universities these ideas are "mentioned, if at all, at the end of the introductory course, or as special topics."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Critical reception===
''The Economy'' has been received favourably. ''[[The Economist]]'' wrote that "[e]arly results are promising":

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The Economy'' does not dumb down economics; it uses maths readily, keeping students engaged through the topicality of the material. Quite early on, students have lessons in the weirdness in economics—from game theory to power dynamics within firms—that makes the subject fascinating and useful but are skimmed over in most introductory courses.&lt;ref name="CORE Economist"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Economist|first1=The|title=The teaching of economics gets an overdue overhaul|url=https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21729443-students-are-forced-grapple-real-world-very-beginning-their|website=Free Exchange|accessdate=4 May 2018|date=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In [[The New Yorker]], [[John Cassidy (journalist)|John Cassidy]] wrote that "The members of the core team deserve credit for responding to the critics of economics without pandering to them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/a-new-way-to-learn-economics|title=A New Way to Learn Economics|last=Cassidy|first=John|date=2017-09-11|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-05-06|language=en|issn=0028-792X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Times Higher Education Supplement]] called the course "a bold revamp" and wrote that taking CORE in year 1 had improved results in year 2 for students at [[University College London]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;The proportion of students gaining a first in the second-year [[microeconomics]] module rose from 22 per cent in 2014-15 to 32 per cent in 2015-16, while the proportion awarded third-class honours fell from 28 per cent to 11 per cent. ... In [[macroeconomics]], the proportion gaining firsts was unchanged, but the number who attained a 2:1 rose from 21 per cent in 2014-15 to 36 per cent in 2015-16."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/students-thrive-thanks-freakonomics-revamp-economics|title=Students thrive thanks to ‘Freakonomics revamp’ of economics|date=2017-01-05|work=Times Higher Education (THE)|access-date=2018-05-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Criticism of approach===

Some curriculum reform campaigners have criticised CORE for being too narrow and prescriptive, and not acknowledging competing schools of thought. Daniel Lapedus, the [[Rethinking Economics]] welcomed CORE’s "incorporation of a variety of thinkers in their curriculum, as well as their efforts to make economics more real and engaging for economics students ... But real critical [[Pluralism in economics|pluralism]] that reflects the true diversity of real-world perspectives is still a long way off. There is plenty more rethinking yet to be done."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/neweconomics/will-real-rethinkers-please-stand/|title=Will the real rethinkers please stand up? - New thinking for the British economy|website=www.opendemocracy.net|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yuan Yang, one of the founders of [[Rethinking Economics]], told [[Financial Times|The Financial Times]] that: &lt;blockquote&gt;“Core is not a pluralist curriculum ... It presents one paradigm, while students should be able to choose among different schools of thought.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/fc2eb464-d93d-11e4-b907-00144feab7de|title=Students weigh the value of new economics course|last=Guigliano|first=Ferdinando|date=10 April 2015|work=The Financial Times|access-date=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Infobox gene}}
'''Calponin 2''' is a [[protein]] that in humans is encoded by the ''CNN2'' [[gene]].

The ''CNN2'' gene is located at 19p13.3 in the human chromosomal genome,&lt;ref name="pmid8889829"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Masuda H, Tanaka K, Takagi M, Ohgami K, Sakamaki T, Shibata N, Takahashi K | title = Molecular cloning and characterization of human non-smooth muscle calponin | journal = Journal of Biochemistry | volume = 120 | issue = 2 | pages = 415–24 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8889829 | doi = 10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a021428}}&lt;/ref&gt; encoding the protein calponin 2. Calponin 2 is one of the three isoforms of calponin and an actin filament-associated regulatory protein with wide tissue distributions. Human calponin 2 is a 33.7-kDa protein consisting of 309 amino acids with an isoelectric point (pI) of 7.23. Accordingly, it is also known as neutral calponin.

== Evolution ==

[[File:CNN2 wikipage.jpg|thumb|369x369px|'''Figure 1:''' Evolutionary lineage of vertebrate calponin 2 deduced from alignment of amino acid sequences.]]
Calponin isoforms are conserved proteins whereas calponin 2 has diverged from [[calponin 1]] and [[Calponin_3,_acidic|calponin 3]] mainly in the C-terminal variable region. Phylogenetic lineage of calponin 2 showed that calponin 2 is conserved among mammalian species but more diverged among amphibian, reptile and fish species (Fig 1).

== Interaction with other proteins ==

[[File:Calponin interacted proteins wikigene fianl.jpg|thumb|559x559px|
'''Figure 2. Proteins interacting with calponin.''' Calponin binds actin filaments through two actin-binding sites (ABS1 and ABS2), tropomyosin via the N-terminal CH domain, and gelsolin via the region of actin-binding sites. Calponin interacts with microtubules through the region including the actin-binding sites and the repeating motifs and with desmin through the region from N-terminal domain to the end of actin-binding sites. The segment of amino acids 144-182 in calponin interacts with myosin.  In the presence of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, [[calmodulin]] and [[S100 protein|S100]] bind calponin at the region of actin-binding sites and reverse calponin’s inhibition of myosin MgATPase. An N-terminal 22-kDa fragment of calponin interacts with phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol. *The interaction between calponin and [[caldesmon]] is controversial.

== Function ==

=== Cell proliferation ===

Significant amounts of calponin 2 are found in growing smooth muscle tissues such as embryonic stomach and urinary bladder as well as the uterus during early pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Hossain_2003"/&gt; The expression of calponin 2 decreases to lower levels in quiescent adult smooth muscle cells while the expression of calponin 1 is up-regulated.&lt;ref name="Hossain_2003"/&gt; Transfective over-expression of calponin 2 inhibited cell proliferation.&lt;ref name="Hossain_2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hossain_2014"/&gt; A hypothesis is that higher level of calponin 2 is required in fast proliferating cells to maintain the dynamic equilibrium of the actin cytoskeleton.

=== Cell motility ===

Primary fibroblasts and peritoneal macrophages isolated from ''Cnn2'' knockout mice migrate faster than that of wild type control cells.&lt;ref name="Huang_2008"/&gt; Calponin 2 may affect cell migration differently in different cell types and in different biological processes. A study showed that forced expression of calponin 2 in endothelial cells enhanced angiogenic cell migration ''in vivo'' and anti-sense calponin 2 RNA reduced chemotaxis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells in culture.&lt;ref name="Tang_2006"/&gt; A hypothesis is that a proper level of calponin 2 may be required to maintain the physiological motility of different cell types in different biological processes. Calponin 2’s regulation of cell motility is based on inhibition of actin activated myosin motor function, as fibroblasts isolated from ''Cnn2'' knockout mice showed increased cell traction force generated by myosin II motors.

=== Cell adhesion ===

A significant level of calponin 2 is found in human and mouse platelets.&lt;ref name="Hines_2014"/&gt; Platelet adhesion is a critical step in blood coagulation and thrombosis. In a microfluidic flow-based thrombosis assay, the time to initiation of rapid platelet/thrombus accumulation was significantly longer in blood samples from ''Cnn2'' knockout versus wild type mice.&lt;ref name="Hines_2014"/&gt; The effect of calponin 2 on facilitating the velocity of cell adhesion was also shown with prostate cancer cells expression high or low levels of calponin 2.&lt;ref name="Tang_2006"/&gt;

=== Immune cells ===

Significant amounts of calponin 2 are found in blood cells of myeloid lineage. Monocytes derived from ''Cnn2'' gene knockout mice proliferated faster than wild type control cells. Calponin 2-null macrophages migrated faster and exhibit enhanced phagocytosis.&lt;ref name="Huang_2008"/&gt; In global as well as myeloid cell-specific ''Cnn2'' knockout mice, the development of inflammatory arthritis induced by anti-glucose-6-phosphate isomerase serum was significantly attenuated as compared with that in wild type mice . Deletion of calponin 2 in macrophages also significantly attenuated the development of atherosclerosis lesions in apolipoprotein E knockout (''ApoE-/-'') mice&lt;ref name="Liu_2015"/&gt;

== Regulation by mechanical tension ==

=== Gene expression ===

The expression of calponin 2 is significantly increased in cells cultured on hard versus soft gel substrates that produce high or low traction force and cytoskeleton tension.&lt;ref name="Hossain_2005"/&gt; The expression of calponin 2 in NIH/3T3 cells was decreased when cytoskeleton tension was reduced after blebbstatin inhibition of myosin II motors.&lt;ref name="Hossain_2006"/&gt; To demonstrate the ''Cnn2'' promoter-specific regulation, transfective expression of calponin 2 using a cytomegalovirus promoter was independent of the stiffness of culture substrate.&lt;ref name="Hossain_2005"/&gt;

A binding site for transcriptional factor HES-1 (hairy and enhancer of split 1) has been identified in the 5’-upstream region of mouse ''Cnn2'' promoter, responsible for the mechanical regulation.&lt;ref name="Jiang_2014"/&gt;  HES-1 is known to function downstream of the Notch-RBP J signaling pathway,&lt;ref name="pmid9570134"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kageyama R, Ishibashi M, Takebayashi K, Tomita K | title = bHLH transcription factors and mammalian neuronal differentiation | journal = The International Journal of Biochemistry &amp; Cell Biology | volume = 29 | issue = 12 | pages = 1389–99 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9570134 | doi =  10.1016/s1357-2725(97)89968-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been suggested to mediate cellular mechanoregulations.&lt;ref name="pmid15705961"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Morrow D, Sweeney C, Birney YA, Cummins PM, Walls D, Redmond EM, Cahill PA | title = Cyclic strain inhibits Notch receptor signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells in vitro | journal = Circulation Research | volume = 96 | issue = 5 | pages = 567–75 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15705961 | doi = 10.1161/01.RES.0000159182.98874.43 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16943241"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Morrow D, Sweeney C, Birney YA, Guha S, Collins N, Cummins PM, Murphy R, Walls D, Redmond EM, Cahill PA | title = Biomechanical regulation of hedgehog signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells in vitro and in vivo | journal = American Journal of Physiology. Cell Physiology | volume = 292 | issue = 1 | pages = C488–96 | year = 2007 | pmid = 16943241 | doi = 10.1152/ajpcell.00337.2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Deletion or mutation of the HES-1 site abolished the mechanical regulation and resulted in a substrate stiffness independent high level of transcription. Therefore, the regulatory mechanism is a low tension-induced repression. Corresponding to the down-regulation of ''Cnn2'' gene expression, the level of HES-1 increased in cells cultured on soft gel substrate in comparison with that in cells cultured on hard substrates.&lt;ref name="Jiang_2014"/&gt;

=== Degradation ===

Calponin 2 is also regulated by mechanical tension at the protein level. A rapid and selective degradation of calponin 2 occurs in lung tissues after a short period of deflation.&lt;ref name="Hossain_2006"/&gt; This low cytoskeleton tension-induced degradation of calponin 2 in collapsed lung was completely prevented in post mortem mouse lung simply by air inflation to maintain tension applied to the alveolae.&lt;ref name="Hossain_2006"/&gt; The cytoskeleton tension-dependent stability of calponin 2 was further confirmed in monolayer cells cultured on expanded elastic membrane by its rapid degradation after a reduction of the dimension of the cultural substrate to acutely reduce cytoskeleton tension.&lt;ref name="Hossain_2006"/&gt;

[[File:Institut der deutschen Wirtschaft Köln (8533-35).jpg|thumb|Cologne Institute for Economic Research
Headquarters in Cologne, Germany
]]

The '''German Economic Institute''' (German: '''Institut der deutschen Wirtschaft''' Köln e.V.) ('''IW''') is a private economic research institute in Germany, which promotes a liberal economic and social order. The German Economic Institute is based in Cologne, Germany, with additional offices in Berlin, Germany, and Brussels, Belgium. 

The IW compiles analyses on economic and social policy issues. As a think tank, it combines research, consultancy and communication services. The research is based on empirical principles and sound scientific methodology. It stands for a socially responsible free market economy in German for the benefit of society as a whole. The institute’s long term goal is to support a liberal economic and social order in Germany and beyond and to improve understanding of how business and society function and interact..

The institute was founded in 1951 under the auspices of the [[Confederation of German Employers' Associations]] (BDA) and the [[:de:Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie|Federation of German Industries]] (BDI). The German Economic Institute is a registered association (e.V.). Its membership consists of some 110 German business and employers' associations as well as a number of individual companies. Membership fees finance the regular scientific research and advocacy. Additionally, the institute conducts research projects and carries out numerous studies financed by third parties, such as public institutions, foundations and businesses.

==IW Group and Governance Structures==

The German Economic Institute has four subsidiaries which together constitute the IW Group. The Group is composed of the core research department (IW Research), a commercial research consultancy (IW Consult), a publishing house (IW Medien), the German operator of the Junior Achievement Programme (IW Junior) and an academy (IW Akademie).
Through the organization’s decision-making bodies members contribute to the institute’s general orientation without having any specific influence on the contents of conducts research and the subsidiaries’ daily business. The annual general meeting of the executive board of the German Economic Institute elected Arndt Günter Kirchhoff, CEO of KIRCHHOFF Holding GmbH &amp; Co. KG, as its honorary president.

===IW Research===

Prof. Dr. [[Michael Hüther]] is the Director of the German Economic Institute and head of its management board. The management board consists of the Director, his Deputy Dr. Hans-Peter Fröhlich and the Heads of Research Dr. Hubertus Bardt and Dr. Hans-Peter Klös.

The Berlin Office is led by Dr. Knut Bergmann and the  Brussels Office by Sandra Parthie.

The institute’s research department itself is subdivided into eleven research units.

====Research Units====
* '''Labour Market''' - main focus on employment and unemployment, working conditions and personnel policy.
* '''Vocational qualification and specialists''' – Vocational training, further education, securing skilled personnel and international VET/PET research
* '''Vocational Rehabilitation and Inclusion''' - information resources for maximising the potential of workers with disabilities
* '''Education, Migration and Innovation''' – examining how education and migration contribute to securing a skilled workforce.
* '''Financial and Real Estate Markets''' – monitoring and researching the economic significance of the finance and real estate markets
* '''International Economics and Economic Outlook''' – promoting open markets and sensible business regulation at the European and global levels as well as analyzing the business cycle, economic growth and globalisation and provide advice for policymakers and business associations
* '''Public Finance, Social Security Systems, Income and Wealth Distribution''' – investigating the fiscal consequences of public policy and analysing the incentive effects for companies and private households
* '''Structural Change and Competition''' – monitoring corporate activity in a constantly changing market environment 
* '''Wage Policy and Industrial Relations''' – pay and industrial relations issues including policy, corporate codetermination, the process of the wage finding and the roles of the parties involved
* '''Environment, Energy, Infrastructure''' – examining the effects of economic activity on the environment and the effects of environmental and energy policy on business
* '''Behavioral Economics and Business Ethics''' – investigating the influence of institutions such as values, standards, rules and laws on the state, society, business and individuals

====Cross Functional Research Groups====

Additionally to the eleven research units there are two cross functional research groups staffed by researchers working on the following two issues:
* Big Data Analytics 
* Macroeconomic Analysis and Forecast 
* Microdata and Method Development

===IW Consult===

The IW Consult carries out research, development and knowledge-transfer projects in cooperation with companies, employers' associations, government ministries, foundations and other institutions. IW Consult also runs the office of “ecl@ss”, a digital product standard.

===IW Medien===

Institut der deutschen Wirtschaft Köln Medien GmbH (IW Media), the media arm of the German Economic Institute (IW), provides publicity-oriented packaging of economic information.The weekly newsletter, Informationsdienst des Instituts der deutschen Wirtschaft Köln (iwd), carries articles on economics, society, and social policy, as well as analyses and economic data.

===IW Junior===

The Institut der deutschen Wirtschaft Köln JUNIOR gGmbH is the German operator of the Junior Achievement Programme. It gives school students practical insights into the world of commerce based on the concept of ”learning by doing”.

===IW Akademie===

The IW Akademie (IW Academy) conducts seminars in the field of executive education based on its research. The aim is to demonstrate how potential conflicts between the profit motive and personal conscience can be resolved. Additionally, the IW Academy offers a Master’s programme "Behavioral Ethics, Economics and Psychology (M.A.)" in collaboration with the University of Cologne, the Cologne University of Applied Sciences and Bonn-Rhine-Sieg University.

==Brussels Office==

The IW's EU-Office located in Brussels was established in July 2015. The key areas of research expertise regarding the European Union include:
* '''International Economic Order and Economic Outlook'''
** '''EU Policies:'''
*** Impact of regulation on open markets and business 
*** EU Monetary Union (EMU) and the Euro debt crisis, the EU Internal market and the EU cohesion policy
** '''International Economic Policies:''' 
*** Business cycle development, economic growth and globalization
*** International competitiveness of the German economy and the chances and challenges of globalization
*** Global trade agreements and the international monetary system
* '''Monetary Policy and the Economics of the Financial Markets'''
** Regulation of financial markets, creation of a European Banking Union
** Inflation developments and the economic cycle, e.g. correlation of low interest rates and inflation leading to re-allocation between creditors and debtors 
* '''Environment, Energy, Infrastructure'''
** Effects of economic activity on the environment 
** Effects of environmental and energy policies on business
* '''Structural Change, Digitalisation and Competition'''
** Corporate activity in a constantly changing market environment

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12947">This page lists the different DNA sequencing services. 
2 main types can be distinguished:
* [[Whole genome sequencing]] (WGS) services
* [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism]] (SNP) sequencing services

Both allow people to detect the presence of hereditary diseases (and/or other imperfections) in their DNA, and (when WGS) is used, it even allows people to know the specifics of their hereditary diseases (and/or other imperfections). These specifics can be important, as in many cases, it's not a single gene that causes the disease, but rather a combination of genes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.acmg.net/docs/acmg_releases_highly-anticipated_recommendations_on_incidental_findings_in_clinical_exome_and_genome_sequencing.pdf Page 25: several genes often responsible for a same disease]&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the exact gene is not even known, but only the [[Locus (genetics)|approximate location]] where the imperfect [[nucleotides]] are situated is known.

'''Cryochemistry''' is the study of chemical interactions at [[temperature]]s below {{convert|-150|°C|F K}}.{{citation-needed|date=November 2015}} It is derived from the Greek word ''cryos'', meaning 'cold'. It overlaps with many other sciences, including [[chemistry]], [[cryobiology]], [[condensed matter physics]], and even [[astrochemistry]].
 
Cryochemistry has been a topic of interest since [[liquid nitrogen]], which freezes at −210°C, became commonly available.{{when|date=November 2015}} [[Cryogenic]]-temperature chemical interactions are an important mechanism for studying the detailed pathways of chemical reactions by reducing the confusion introduced by thermal fluctuations. Cryochemistry forms the foundation for [[cryobiology]], which uses slowed or stopped biological processes for medical and research purposes.

==Low temperature behaviours==
[[File:2 Helium.png|thumb|When cooled below the [[Lambda point]] ({{convert|2.17|K|C|disp=or}} at 1 [[atmosphere (unit)|atm]]), [[liquid helium]] exhibits properties of [[superfluidity]]]]
As a material cools, the relative motion of its component molecules/atoms decreases - its temperature decreases.  Cooling can continue until all motion ceases, and its [[kinetic energy]], or energy of motion, disappears. This condition is known as [[absolute zero]] and it forms the basis for the [[Kelvin]] [[scale of temperature|temperature scale]], which measures the temperature above absolute zero. Zero degrees Celsius (°C) coincides with 273 Kelvin.

At absolute zero most elements become a solid, but not all behave as predictably as this; for instance, helium becomes a [[liquid helium|highly unusual liquid]]. The chemistry between substances, however, does not disappear, even near absolute zero temperatures, since separated molecules/atom can always combine to lower their total energy. Almost every molecule or element will show different properties at different temperatures; if cold enough, some functions are lost entirely. Cryogenic chemistry can lead to very different results compared with standard chemistry, and new chemical routes to substances may be available at cryogenic temperatures, such as the formation of [[argon fluorohydride]], which is only a stable compound at or below {{convert|17|K|C}}.

==Methods of cooling==
{{see also|Laser cooling}}
One method that used to cool molecules to temperatures near absolute zero is [[laser cooling]]. In the [[Doppler cooling]] process, lasers are used to remove energy from electrons of a given molecule to slow or cool the molecule down. This method has applications in [[quantum mechanics]] and is related to particle traps and the [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]. All of these methods use a "trap" consisting of lasers pointed at opposite equatorial angles on a specific point in space. The wavelengths from the laser beams eventually hit the gaseous atoms and their outer spinning electrons. This clash of wavelengths decreases the kinetic energy state fraction by fraction to slow or cool the molecules down. Laser cooling has also been used to help improve atomic clocks and atom optics.  Ultracold studies are not usually focused on chemical interactions, but rather on fundamental chemical properties.{{citation-needed|date=November 2015}}

Because of the extremely low temperatures, diagnosing the chemical status is a major issue when studying low temperature physics and chemistry.{{clarify|date=November 2015}} The primary techniques in use today are optical - many types of spectroscopy are available, but these require special apparatus with vacuum windows that provide room temperature access to cryogenic processes.
&lt;!--
References in progress:
"Cryocooling" and cold storage is currently a major commercial application of cryochemistry. Materials are preserved when cold because the biological processes of degradation are slowed or stopped.  Cryotreatment of materials is also more and more widely used to alter important material properties such as hardness, or even the sound of musical instruments. Cryochemistry is of crucial importance in advanced chemical rocket propellants.

'''Development economics''' is a branch of [[economics]] which deals with economic aspects of the development process in low income countries. Its focus is not only on methods of promoting [[economic development]], [[economic growth]] and [[structural change]] but also on improving the potential for the mass of the population, for example, through health, education and workplace conditions, whether through public or private channels.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Clive (1987). "development economics," [[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]], v. 1, pp. 818, 825.&lt;/ref&gt;

Development economics involves the creation of theories and methods that aid in the determination of policies and practices and can be implemented at either the domestic or international level.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, H. W. (1981). "Economic Development: A Semantic History," ''Economic Development and Cultural Change'', 29(3), p [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1153704 pp. 457]–66. Chicago: The Chicago University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  This may involve restructuring market incentives or using mathematical methods such as intertemporal [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] for project analysis, or it may involve a mixture of quantitative and qualitative methods.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Clive (1987). "development economics," [[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]], v. 1, p. 825.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories of development economics==

=== Mercantilism and physiocracy ===
[[File:Historic world GDP per capita.svg|thumb|World GDP per capita, from 1400 to 2003&amp;nbsp;CE]]{{Main article|Mercantilism}}
The earliest Western theory of development economics was [[mercantilism]], which developed in the 17th century, paralleling the rise of the [[nation state]]. Earlier theories had given little attention to development. For example, [[scholasticism]], the dominant school of thought during medieval feudalism, emphasized reconciliation with Christian theology and ethics, rather than development. The 16th- and 17th-century [[School of Salamanca]], credited as the earliest modern school of economics, likewise did not address development specifically.

Major European nations in the 17th and 18th century all adopted mercantilist ideals to varying degrees, the influence only ebbing with the 18th-century development of [[physiocrats]] in France and [[classical economics]] in Britain. Mercantilism held that a nation's prosperity depended on its supply of capital, represented by bullion (gold, silver, and trade value) held by the state. It emphasised the maintenance of a high positive trade balance (maximising exports and minimising imports) as a means of accumulating this bullion. To achieve a positive trade balance, protectionist measures such as tariffs and subsidies to home industries were advocated. Mercantilist development theory also advocated [[colonialism]].

Theorists most associated with mercantilism include [[Philipp von Hörnigk]], who in his ''Austria Over All, If She Only Will'' of 1684 gave the only comprehensive statement of mercantilist theory, emphasizing production and an export-led economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Mercantilist ideas continue in the theories of [[economic nationalism]] and [[neomercantilism]].

=== Economic nationalism ===
[[File:Alexander Hamilton.jpg|thumb|[[Alexander Hamilton]], credited as Father of the National System]]
{{Main article|Economic nationalism}}
Following mercantilism was the related theory of [[economic nationalism]], promulgated in the 19th century related to the development and industrialization of the United States and Germany, notably in the policies of the [[American School (economics)|American System]] in America and the [[Zollverein]] (customs union) in Germany. A significant difference from mercantilism was the de-emphasis on colonies, in favor of a focus on domestic production.

The names most associated with 19th-century economic nationalism are the American [[Alexander Hamilton]], the German-American [[Friedrich List]], and the American [[Henry Clay]]. Hamilton's 1791 ''[[Report on Manufactures]],'' his magnum opus, is the founding text of the American System, and drew from the mercantilist economies of Britain under Elizabeth I and France under Colbert. List's 1841 ''Das Nationale System der Politischen Ökonomie'' (translated into English as The National System of Political Economy), which emphasized stages of growth, proved influential in the US and Germany, and nationalist policies were pursued by politician Henry Clay, and later by [[Abraham Lincoln]], under the influence of economist [[Henry Charles Carey]].

Forms of economic nationalism and neomercantilism have also been key in Japan's development in the 19th and 20th centuries, and the more recent development of the [[Four Asian Tigers]] (Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore), and, most significantly, China.

Following [[Brexit]] and the [[United States presidential election, 2016]], some experts have argued a new kind of "self-seeking capitalism" popularly known as [[wikt:Trumponomics|Trumponomics]] could have a considerable impact on cross-border investment flows and long-term capital allocation&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Weltman: [https://www.globalcapital.com/article/b1157nr86h8byh/country-risk-review-2016-populism-is-risky 'Country Risk Review: Populism Is Risky’, Euromoney Global Capital, January 6 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M.

=== Post-WWII theories ===
{{See also|Industrial development|Ragnar Nurkse's balanced growth theory}}

The origins of modern development economics are often traced to the need for, and likely problems with the industrialization of eastern Europe in the aftermath of World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Meier, G.M. and Seers, D. (Eds) (1984). ''Pioneers in Development''. New York: Oxford University Press for the World Bank. [http://hope.dukejournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/19/3/503 Review extract.]&lt;/ref&gt; The key authors are [[Paul Rosenstein-Rodan]],&lt;ref&gt;Rosenstein-Rodan, P. "Problems of Industrialization in Eastern and South Eastern Europe." ''Economic Journal'' 53 (1943).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kurt Mandelbaum]],&lt;ref&gt;Mandelbaum (Martin), K. (1945).

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ragnar Nurkse]],&lt;ref&gt;Nurkse, Ragnar (1953) ''Problems of Capital Formation in Underdeveloped Countries'', Oxford: Basil Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hans Singer|Sir Hans Wolfgang Singer]]. Only after the war did economists turn their concerns towards Asia, Africa and Latin America. At the heart of these studies, by authors such as [[Simon Kuznets]] and [[Arthur Lewis (economist)|W. Arthur Lewis]]&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, W.A. (1954). ''Economic Development with Unlimited Supplies of Labour. The Manchester School'', XXII(2), pp. 139–91.  [ftp://ftp.uic.edu/pub/depts/econ/wpaper/cchis/old%20docs533%20S07/Economic%20Development%20with%20Unlimited%20Supplies%20of%20Labour%20-%20Arthur%20Lewis.pdf Reprint.]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; was an analysis of not only economic growth but also structural transformation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pranab Bardhan|Bardhan, Pranab K.]] and [[Christopher Udry]] (2000) ''Development Microeconomics'', Oxford&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linear-stages-of-growth model===
An early theory of development economics, the linear-stages-of-growth model was first formulated in the 1950s by [[Walt Whitman Rostow|W. W. Rostow]] in ''The Stages of Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto,'' following work of Marx and List.  This theory modifies Marx's stages theory of development and focuses on the accelerated accumulation of capital, through the utilization of both domestic and international savings as a means of spurring investment, as the primary means of promoting economic growth and, thus, development.&lt;ref name="Economic Development" /&gt;  The linear-stages-of-growth model posits that there are a series of five consecutive stages of development which all countries must go through during the process of development.  These stages are "the traditional society, the pre-conditions for take-off, the take-off, the drive to maturity, and the age of high mass-consumption"&lt;ref&gt;Rostow, W.W. "The Five Stages of Growth". ''Development and Underdevelopment: The Political Economy of Global Inequality''. 3rd ed. pp. 123–31. Eds. Seligson, Mitchell and John Passe-Smith.  Boulder, CO: [[Lynne Rienner Publishers]], 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  Simple versions of the [[Harrod–Domar model]] provide a mathematical illustration of the argument that improved capital investment leads to greater economic growth.&lt;ref name="Economic Development" /&gt;

Such theories have been criticized for not recognizing that, while necessary, [[capital accumulation]] is not a sufficient condition for development. That is to say that this early and simplistic theory failed to account for political, social and institutional obstacles to development.  Furthermore, this theory was developed in the early years of the [[Cold War]] and was largely derived from the successes of the [[Marshall Plan]].  This has led to the major criticism that the theory assumes that the conditions found in developing countries are the same as those found in post-WWII Europe.&lt;ref name="Economic Development" /&gt;

===Structural-change theory===

Structural-change theory deals with policies focused on changing the economic structures of developing countries from being composed primarily of subsistence agricultural practices to being a "more modern, more urbanized, and more industrially diverse manufacturing and service economy."  There are two major forms of structural-change theory: W. Lewis' ''two-sector surplus model'', which views agrarian societies as consisting of large amounts of surplus labor which can be utilized to spur the development of an urbanized industrial sector, and Hollis Chenery's ''patterns of development'' approach, which holds that different countries become wealthy via different trajectories.  The ''pattern'' that a particular country will follow, in this framework, depends on its size and resources, and potentially other factors including its current income level and comparative advantages relative to other nations.&lt;ref&gt;Chenery, H.B. (1960). "Patterns of Industrial Growth," [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1812463 ''The American Economic Review'', 50(4), pp. 624–54]. American Economic Association.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chenery, H.B. and Taylor, L. (1968). "Development Patterns: Among Countries and Over Time," [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1926806 ''The Review of Economics and Statistics'', 50(4), pp. 391–416]. Cambridge: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Empirical analysis in this framework studies the "sequential process through which the economic, industrial and institutional structure of an underdeveloped economy is transformed over time to permit new industries to replace traditional agriculture as the engine of economic growth."&lt;ref name="Economic Development" /&gt;

Structural-change approaches to development economics have faced criticism for their emphasis on urban development at the expense of rural development which can lead to a substantial rise in inequality between internal regions of a country.  The two-sector surplus model, which was developed in the 1950s, has been further criticized for its underlying assumption that predominantly agrarian societies suffer from a surplus of labor.  Actual empirical studies have shown that such labor surpluses are only seasonal and drawing such labor to urban areas can result in a collapse of the agricultural sector.  The patterns of development approach has been criticized for lacking a theoretical framework.&lt;ref name="Economic Development" /&gt;{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

===International dependence theory===
International [[dependency theory|dependence theories]] gained prominence in the 1970s as a reaction to the failure of earlier theories to lead to widespread successes in [[international development]].  Unlike earlier theories, international dependence theories have their origins in developing countries and view obstacles to development as being primarily external in nature, rather than internal.  These theories view developing countries as being economically and politically dependent on more powerful, developed countries which have an interest in maintaining their dominant position.  There are three different, major formulations of international dependence theory: [[neocolonial dependence]] theory, the false-paradigm model, and the dualistic-dependence model.
The first formulation of international dependence theory, neocolonial dependence theory, has its origins in [[Marxism]] and views the failure of many developing nations to undergo successful development as being the result of the historical development of the international capitalist system.&lt;ref name="Economic Development" /&gt;

===Neoclassical theory===
First gaining prominence with the rise of several conservative governments in the developed world during the 1980s, neoclassical theories represent a radical shift away from International Dependence Theories.  Neoclassical theories argue that governments should not intervene in the economy; in other words, these theories are claiming that an unobstructed free market is the best means of inducing rapid and successful development.  Competitive [[free markets]] unrestrained by excessive government regulation are seen as being able to naturally ensure that the allocation of resources occurs with the greatest efficiency possible and the economic growth is raised and stabilized.&lt;ref name="Economic Development" /&gt;{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

It is important to note that there are several different approaches within the realm of neoclassical theory, each with subtle, but important, differences in their views regarding the extent to which the market should be left unregulated.  These different takes on neoclassical theory are the ''free market approach'', ''public-choice theory'', and the ''market-friendly approach''.  Of the three, both the free-market approach and public-choice theory contend that the market should be totally free, meaning that any intervention by the government is necessarily bad.  Public-choice theory is arguably the more radical of the two with its view, closely associated with [[libertarianism]], that governments themselves are rarely good and therefore should be as minimal as possible.&lt;ref name="Economic Development" /&gt;

Academic economists have given varied policy advice to governments of developing countries. See for example, [[Economy of Chile]] ([[Arnold Harberger]]), [[Economic history of Taiwan]] ([[Sho-Chieh Tsiang]]). [[Anne Krueger]] noted in 1996 that success and failure of policy recommendations worldwide had not consistently been incorporated into prevailing academic writings on trade and development.&lt;ref name="Economic Development" /&gt;

The market-friendly approach, unlike the other two, is a more recent development and is often associated with the [[World Bank]]. This approach still advocates free markets but recognizes that there are many imperfections in the markets of many developing nations and thus argues that some government intervention is an effective means of fixing such imperfections.&lt;ref name="Economic Development" /&gt;

==Topics of research==
Development economics also includes topics such as [[Debt of developing countries|third world debt]], and the functions of such organisations as the [[International Monetary Fund]] and [[World Bank]].  In fact, the majority of development economists are employed by, do consulting with, or receive funding from institutions like the IMF and the World Bank.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Daniel B. and DiCola, Therese. "[http://www.econjournalwatch.org/pdf/KleinDiColasInvestigatingAugust2004.pdf Institutional Ties of ''Journal of Development Economics'' Authors and Editors]". (August 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;  Many such economists are interested in ways of promoting stable and sustainable growth in poor countries and areas, by promoting domestic self-reliance and education in some of the lowest income countries in the world. Where economic issues merge with social and political ones, it is referred to as [[development studies]].

===Economic development and ethnicity===
A growing body of research has been emerging among development economists since the very late 20th century focusing on interactions between [[Multiculturalism|ethnic diversity]] and economic development, particularly at the level of the [[Nation state|nation-state]]. While most research looks at empirical economics at both the macro and the micro level, this field of study has a particularly heavy sociological approach. The more conservative branch of research focuses on tests for causality in the relationship between different levels of ethnic diversity and economic performance, while a smaller and more radical branch argues for the role of [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal economics]] in enhancing or causing [[ethnic conflict]]. Moreover, comparing these two theoretical approaches brings the issue of [[Endogeneity (economics)|endogeneity]] (endogenicity) into questions. This remains a highly contested and uncertain field of research, as well as politically sensitive, largely due to its possible policy implications.

====The role of ethnicity in economic development====
Much discussion among researchers centers around defining and measuring two key but related variables: '''ethnicity''' and '''diversity'''. It is debated whether [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]] should be defined by culture, language, or religion. While conflicts in [[Rwandan Genocide|Rwanda]] were largely along tribal lines, [[Nigerian Civil War|Nigeria's string of conflicts]] is thought to be – at least to some degree – religiously based.&lt;ref&gt;Salawu, B. "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Muhammad_Kamaldeen_IMAM-TAMIM/publication/235892778_ejss_13_3_02/links/0912f513ea7151f611000000/ejss-13-3-02.pdf Ethno-Religious Conflicts in Nigeria: Casual Analysis and Proposal for New Management Strategies]". ''European Journal of Social Sciences'' 13.3 (2010): 345–53. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Some have proposed that, as the [[Salience (language)|saliency]] of these different ethnic variables tends to vary over time and across geography, research methodologies should vary according to the context.&lt;ref name="Alesina 2005"&gt;Alesina, Alberto and [[Eliana La Ferrara]]. "Ethnic Diversity and Economic Performance". ''Journal of Economic Literature'' 43 (2005): 762–800. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Somalia]] provides an interesting example. Due to the fact that about 85% of its population defined themselves as [[Somali people|Somali]], Somalia was considered to be a rather ethnically-homogeneous nation.&lt;ref name="Alesina 2005"/&gt; However, [[Somali Civil War|civil war]] caused ethnicity (or ethnic affiliation) to be redefined according to [[clan]] groups.&lt;ref name="Alesina 2005"/&gt;

There is also much discussion in academia concerning the creation of an [[Index (economics)|index]] for "ethnic heterogeneity". Several indices have been proposed in order to model ethnic diversity (with regards to conflict). Easterly and Levine have proposed an ethno-linguistic fractionalization index defined as FRAC or ELF defined by:
:&lt;math&gt;1 - \sum_{i=1}^{N} s_i^2,&lt;/math&gt; 
where ''s&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is size of group ''i'' as a percentage of total population.&lt;ref name="Alesina 2005"/&gt; The ELF index is a measure of the probability that two randomly chosen individuals belong to different ethno-linguistic groups.&lt;ref name="Alesina 2005"/&gt; Other researchers have also applied this index to religious rather than ethno-linguistic groups.&lt;ref&gt;Fearon, James D. "Ethnic and Cultural Diversity by Country". ''Journal of Economic Growth'' 8 (2003): 195–222. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Though commonly used, Alesina and La Ferrara point out that the ELF index fails to account for the possibility that fewer large ethnic groups may result in greater inter-ethnic conflict than many small ethnic groups.&lt;ref name="Alesina 2005"/&gt; More recently, researchers such as Montalvo and Reynal-Querol, have put forward the ''Q'' [[Polarization (politics)|polarization]] index as a more appropriate measure of ethnic division.&lt;ref name="Montalvo, Jose G 2005"&gt;Montalvo, Jose G. and Marta Reynal-Querol. "[http://www.econ.upf.edu/~Montalvo/wp/jde_marta_jose.pdf Ethnic Diversity and Economic Development]". Journal of Development Economics 76 (2005): ''293–323''. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on a simplified adaptation of a polarization index developed by Esteban and Ray, the ''Q'' index is defined as 
:&lt;math&gt;Q = 1 - \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left(\frac{\tfrac{1}{2} - s_i}{\tfrac{1}{2}}\right)^2 \times s_i,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''s&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' once again represents the size of group ''i'' as a percentage of total population, and is intended to capture the social distance between existing ethnic groups within an area.&lt;ref name="Montalvo, Jose G 2005"/&gt;

Early researchers, such as Jonathan Pool, considered a concept dating back to the account of the Tower of [[Tower of Babel|Babel]]: that linguistic unity may allow for higher levels of development.&lt;ref name="Pool, Jonathan 1972"&gt;Pool, Jonathan. "[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/95c8/f417dd91510787a4d20ee5c429ffdafabc56.pdf National Development and Language Diversity]". ''Advances in the Sociology of Language'' 2 (1972): 213–30. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; While pointing out obvious oversimplifications and the subjectivity of definitions and data collection, Pool suggested that we had yet to see a robust economy emerge from a nation with a high degree of linguistic diversity.&lt;ref name="Pool, Jonathan 1972"/&gt; In his research Pool used the "size of the largest native-language community as a percentage of the population" as his measure of linguistic diversity.&lt;ref name="Pool, Jonathan 1972"/&gt; Not much later, however, Horowitz pointed out that both highly diverse and highly homogeneous societies exhibit less conflict than those in between.&lt;ref&gt;Horowitz, D.L. ''Ethnic groups in conflict.'' Berkeley: University of California Press, 1985. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Collier and Hoeffler provided evidence that both highly homogenous and highly heterogeneous societies exhibit lower risk of civil war, while societies that are more polarized are at greater risk.&lt;ref name="Collier 1998"&gt;Collier, Paul and Anke Hoeffler. "[https://asso-sherpa.org/sherpa-content/docs/programmes/GDH/Campagne_RC/War.pdf On Economic Causes of Civil War]". ''Oxford Economic Papers'' 50 (1998): 563–73. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; As a matter of fact, their research suggests that a society with only two ethnic groups is about 50% more likely to experience civil war than either of the two extremes.&lt;ref name="Collier 1998"/&gt; Nonetheless, Mauro points out that ethno-linguistic fractionalization is positively correlated with corruption, which in turn is negatively correlated with economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;Mauro, Paolo. "Corruption and Growth". ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'' 110.3 (1995): 681–712. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in a study on economic growth in African countries, Easterly and Levine find that linguistic fractionalization plays a significant role in reducing national income growth and in explaining poor policies.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Montalvo, Jose G. and Marta Reynal-Querol. "[http://www.econ.upf.edu/~Montalvo/wp/jde_marta_jose.pdf Ethnic Diversity and Economic Development]". ''Journal of Development Economics'' 76 (2005): 293–323. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dincer, Oguzhan C. and Fan Wang. "[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/53b8/d0147314c05e56c847a13a28bb9721ad5d8f.pdf Ethnic Diversity and Economic Growth in China]". ''Journal of Economic Policy Reform'' 14.1 (2011): 1–10. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Empirical evidence|empirical research]] in the [[United States|U.S.]], at the [[Municipality|municipal]] level, has revealed that ethnic fractionalization (based on race) may be correlated with poor [[Fiscal policy|fiscal management]] and lower investments in [[public good]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Alesina, Alberto, Reza Baqir and William Easterly. "Public Goods and Ethnic Divisions". ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'' 114.4 (1999): 1243–84. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, more recent research would propose that ethno-linguistic fractionalization is indeed negatively correlated with economic growth while more polarized societies exhibit greater public consumption, lower levels of investment and more frequent civil wars.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

====Economic development and its impact on ethnic conflict====
Increasingly, attention is being drawn to the role of economics in ''spawning'' or ''cultivating'' '''ethnic conflict'''. Critics of earlier development theories, mentioned above, point out that “ethnicity” and ethnic conflict cannot be treated as exogenous variables.&lt;ref name="rrp.sagepub"&gt;Prasch, Robert E. "[http://rrp.sagepub.com/content/44/3/298 Neoliberalism and Ethnic Conflict]". ''Review of Radical Political Economics'' 44.3 (2012): 298–304. Web. Retrieved February 1, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a body of literature which discusses how economic growth and development, particularly in the context of a [[Globalization|globalizing world]] characterized by [[free trade]], appears to be leading to the extinction and homogenization of languages.&lt;ref&gt;De Grauwe, Paul.

Retrieved Feb 1, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Manuel Castells asserts that the "widespread destructuring of organizations, delegitimation of institutions, fading away of major social movements, and ephemeral cultural expressions" which characterize globalization lead to a renewed search for meaning; one that is based on identity rather than on practices.&lt;ref&gt;Castells, Manuel. "The Rise of the Network Society". ''The Information Age: Economy, Society and Culture''. Vol. 1. Malden: Blackwell Publishers Inc., 1996. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Barber and Lewis argue that culturally-based [[Resistance movement|movements of resistance]] have emerged as a reaction to the threat of [[modernization]] (perceived or actual) and [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] development.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Bernard.

On a different note, Chua suggests that ethnic conflict often results from the envy of the majority toward a wealthy minority which has benefited from trade in a neoliberal world.&lt;ref name="rrp.sagepub" /&gt; She argues that conflict is likely to erupt through political manipulation and the vilification of the minority.&lt;ref name="rrp.sagepub" /&gt; Prasch points out that, as economic growth often occurs in tandem with increased [[Economic inequality|inequality]], ethnic or religious organizations may be seen as both assistance and an outlet for the disadvantaged.&lt;ref name="rrp.sagepub" /&gt; However, empirical research by Piazza argues that economics and unequal development have little to do with [[Rebellion|social unrest]] in the form of [[terrorism]].&lt;ref name="Piazza, James A. 2006"&gt;Piazza, James A. "Rooted in Poverty?: Terrorism, Poor Economic Development, and Social Cleavages". ''Terrorism and Political Violence'' 18.1 (2006): 159–77. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, "more diverse societies, in terms of ethnic and religious [[demography]], and political systems with large, complex, multiparty systems were more likely to experience terrorism than were more homogeneous states with few or no parties at the national level".&lt;ref name="Piazza, James A. 2006"/&gt;

====Recovery from conflict (civil war)====
Violent conflict and economic development are deeply intertwined. Paul Collier&lt;ref&gt;Collier, Paul. "[[The Bottom Billion]]." ''The Bottom Billion'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; describes how poor countries are more prone to civil conflict. The conflict lowers incomes catching countries in a "conflict trap." Violent conflict destroys physical capital (equipment and infrastructure), diverts valuable resources to military spending, discourages investment and disrupts exchange.&lt;ref&gt;Collier, Paul "[http://oep.oxfordjournals.org/content/51/1/168.abstract On the consequences of civil war]." ''Oxf. Econ. Pap.'' (1999) 51 (1): 168–83. doi: 10.1093/oep/51.1.168&lt;/ref&gt;

Recovery from civil conflict is very uncertain. Countries that maintain stability can experience a "peace dividend," through the rapid re-accumulation of physical capital (investment flows back to the recovering country because of the high return).&lt;ref&gt;Collier, Paul. "[http://www.csae.ox.ac.uk/workingpapers/pdfs/9508text.pdf Civil War and the Economics of the Peace Dividend]" Working Paper. Centre for the Study of African Economies (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;  However, successful recovery depends on the quality of legal system and the protection of private property.&lt;ref&gt;O'Reilly, Colin [http://www.palgrave-journals.com/ces/journal/v56/n1/full/ces201328a.html "Investment and Institutions in Post Civil War Recovery]". ''Comparative Economic Studies'' 56, 1–24 (March 2014) | doi:10.1057/ces.2013.28&lt;/ref&gt; Investment is more productive in countries with higher quality institutions. Firms that experienced a civil war were more sensitive to the quality of the legal system that firm similar firms that had never been exposed to conflict.&lt;ref&gt;O'Reilly, Colin "[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2484629 Firm Investment Decisions in the Post Conflict Context]" forthcoming ''The Economics of Transition''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Growth indicator controversy==
Per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP per head) is used by many developmental economists as an approximation of general national well-being. However, these measures are criticized as not measuring economic growth well enough, especially in countries where there is much economic activity that is not part of measured financial transactions (such as housekeeping and self-homebuilding), or where funding is not available for accurate measurements to be made publicly available for other economists to use in their studies (including private and institutional fraud, in some countries).

Even though per-capita GDP as measured can make economic well-being appear smaller than it really is in some developing countries, the discrepancy could be still bigger in a developed country where people may perform outside of financial transactions an even higher-value service than housekeeping or homebuilding as gifts or in their own households, such as counseling, [[lifestyle coaching]], a more valuable home décor service, and time management. Even free choice can be considered to add value to lifestyles without necessarily increasing the financial transaction amounts.

More recent theories of Human Development have begun to see beyond purely financial measures of development, for example with measures such as medical care available, education, equality, and political freedom. One measure used is the [[Genuine Progress Indicator]], which relates strongly to theories of [[distributive justice]]. Actual knowledge about what creates growth is largely unproven; however recent advances in [[econometrics]] and more accurate measurements in many countries is creating new knowledge by compensating for the effects of variables to determine probable causes out of merely correlational statistics.

==Recent developments==
{{see also|Fair trade movement}}

The most prominent contemporary development economist is perhaps the [[Nobel laureate]], [[Amartya Sen]].

Recent theories revolve around questions about what variables or inputs correlate or affect economic growth the most: elementary, secondary, or higher education, government policy stability, tariffs and subsidies, fair court systems, available infrastructure, availability of medical care, prenatal care and clean water, ease of entry and exit into trade, and equality of income distribution (for example, as indicated by the [[Gini coefficient]]), and how to advise governments about macroeconomic policies, which include all policies that affect the economy.
Education enables countries to adapt the latest technology and creates an environment for new innovations.

The cause of limited growth and divergence in economic growth lies in the high rate of acceleration of technological change by a small number of developed countries. These countries' acceleration of technology was due to increased incentive structures for mass education which in turn created a framework for the population to create and adapt new innovations and methods. Furthermore, the content of their education was composed of secular schooling that resulted in higher productivity levels and modern economic growth.

Researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] also highlight the importance of using economic growth to improve the human condition, raising people out of poverty and achieving the [[Millennium Development Goals]].&lt;ref name=ODI&gt;Claire Melamed, Kate Higgins and Andy Sumner (2010) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4892&amp;title=millennium-development-goals-equitable-growth-policy-brief Economic growth and the MDGs] [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite research showing almost no relation between growth and the achievement of the goals 2 to 7 and statistics showing that during periods of growth poverty levels in some cases have actually risen (e.g. Uganda grew by 2.5% annually between 2000–2003, yet poverty levels rose by 3.8%), researchers at the ODI suggest growth is necessary, but that it must be equitable.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; This concept of inclusive growth is shared even by key world leaders such as Secretary General [[Ban Ki-moon]], who emphasises that:
:"Sustained and equitable growth based on dynamic structural economic change is necessary for making substantial progress in reducing poverty. It also enables faster progress towards the other Millennium Development Goals. While economic growth is necessary, it is not sufficient for progress on reducing poverty."&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;
Researchers at the ODI thus emphasise the need to ensure [[social protection]] is extended to allow universal access and that active policy measures are introduced to encourage the private sector to create new jobs as the economy grows (as opposed to [[jobless growth]]) and seek to employ people from disadvantaged groups.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20050">'''Radiation dosimetry''' in the fields of [[health physics]] and [[radiation protection]] is the measurement, calculation and assessment of the [[ionizing radiation]] dose absorbed by an object, usually the human body. This applies both internally, due to ingested or inhaled radioactive substances, or externally due to irradiation by sources of radiation.

[[Internal dosimetry]] assessment relies on a variety of monitoring, bio-assay or radiation imaging techniques, whilst external dosimetry is based on measurements with a [[dosimeter]], or inferred from measurements made by other radiological protection instruments.

Dosimetry is used extensively for radiation protection and is routinely applied to monitor occupational radiation workers, where irradiation is expected, or where radiation is unexpected, such as in the aftermath of the [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island]], [[Chernobyl]] or [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima]] radiological release incidents.  The public dose take-up is measured and calculated from a variety of indicators such as ambient measurements of gamma radiation, radioactive particulate monitoring, and the measurement of levels of [[radioactive contamination]].

Other significant areas are medical dosimetry, where the required treatment [[absorbed dose]] and any collateral absorbed dose is monitored, and in environmental dosimetry, such as [[radon]] monitoring in buildings.

==Measuring radiation dose==

===External dose===
There are several ways of measuring absorbed doses from ionizing radiation. People in occupational contact with radioactive substances, or who may be exposed to radiation, routinely carry personal [[dosimeter]]s. These are specifically designed to record and indicate the dose received. Traditionally, these were lockets fastened to the external clothing of the monitored person, which contained photographic film known as [[film badge dosimeter]]s. These have been largely replaced with other devices such as the TLD badge which uses [[Thermoluminescent dosimetry]] or [[optically stimulated luminescence]] (OSL) badges.

A number of electronic devices known as Electronic Personal Dosimeters (EPDs) have come into general use using semiconductor detection and programmable processor technology. These are worn as badges but can give an indication of instantaneous dose rate and an audible and visual alarm if a dose rate or a total integrated dose is exceeded. A good deal of information can be made immediately available to the wearer of the recorded dose and current dose rate via a local display. They can be used as the main stand-alone dosimeter, or as a supplement to such as a TLD badge. These devices are particularly useful for real-time monitoring of dose where a high dose rate is expected which will time-limit the wearer's exposure. 

The [[ICRP]] guidance states that if a personal dosimeter is worn on a position on the body representative of its exposure, assuming whole-body exposure, the value of personal dose equivalent Hp(10) is sufficient to estimate an effective dose value suitable for radiological protection.&lt;ref&gt;ICRP pub 103 para 138&lt;/ref&gt; Such devices are known as "legal dosimeters" if they have been approved for use in recording personnel dose for regulatory purposes. In cases of non-uniform irradiation such personal dosimeters may not be representative of certain specific areas of the body, where additional dosimeters are used in the area of concern.

In certain circumstances, a dose can be inferred from readings taken by fixed instrumentation in an area in which the person concerned has been working. This would generally only be used if personal dosimetry had not been issued, or a personal dosimeter has been damaged or lost. Such calculations would take a pessimistic view of the likely received dose.

===Internal dose===
{{main article|Internal dosimetry}}
[[Internal dosimetry]] is used to evaluate the [[committed dose]] due to the intake of radionuclides into the human body. 


==Medical dosimetry==
{{Main article|Treatment planning}}
Medical dosimetry is the calculation of absorbed dose and optimization of dose delivery in [[radiation therapy]]. It is often performed by a professional health physicist with specialized training in that field. In order to plan the delivery of radiation therapy, the radiation produced by the sources is usually characterized with [[percentage depth dose curve]]s and [[dose profile]]s measured by [[Medical physics|medical physicists]].

In radiation therapy, three-dimensional dose distributions are often evaluated using the dosimetry technique known as [[gel dosimetry]].&lt;ref&gt;C Baldock, Y De Deene, S Doran, G Ibbott, A Jirasek, M Lepage, KB McAuley, M Oldham, LJ Schreiner 2010. Polymer gel dosimetry. Physics in Medicine and Biology 55 (5) R1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental dosimetry==
Environmental Dosimetry is used where it is likely that the environment will generate a significant radiation dose. An example of this is [[radon]] monitoring. Radon is a radioactive gas generated by the decay of uranium, which is present in varying amounts in the earth's crust. Certain geographic areas, due to the underlying geology, continually generate radon which permeates its way to the earth's surface. In some cases the dose can be significant in buildings where the gas can accumulate. A number of specialised dosimetry techniques are used to evaluate the dose that a building's occupants may receive.

==Measures of dose==
{{Main article|sievert}}
[[File:Dose quantities and units.png|thumb|400px|External radiation protection dose quantities in SI units]]
[[File:SI Radiation dose units.png|thumb|400px|Graphic showing relationship of SI radiation dose units]]

To enable consideration of stochastic health risk, calculations are performed to convert the physical quantity absorbed dose into equivalent and effective doses, the details of which depend on the radiation type and biological context. For applications in [[radiation protection]] and dosimetry assessment the [[ICRP|International Committee on Radiation Protection]] (ICRP) and [[International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements]] (ICRU) have published recommendations and data which are used to calculate these.

===Units of measure===
There are a number of different measures of radiation dose, including [[absorbed dose]] (''D'') measured in: 
*[[gray (unit)|grays]] (Gy) energy absorbed per unit of mass ([[Joule|J]]·kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;)
*[[Equivalent dose]] (''H'') measured in [[sievert]]s (Sv)
*[[Effective dose (radiation)|Effective dose]] (''E'') measured in sieverts 
*[[Kerma (physics)|Kerma]] (K) measured in grays 
*[[dose area product]]  (DAP) measured in gray centimeters&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
*dose length product (DLP) measured in gray centimeters 
*[[rad (unit)|rads]] a deprecated unit of absorbed radiation dose, defined as 1 rad = 0.01 Gy = 0.01 J/kg
*[[Roentgen (unit)|Roentgen]] a legacy unit of measurement for the exposure of X-rays

Each measure is often simply described as ‘dose’, which can lead to confusion. Non-[[SI]] units are still used, particularly in the USA, where dose is often reported in rads and dose equivalent in [[Rontgen equivalent man|rems]].  By definition, 1 Gy = 100 rad and 1 Sv = 100 rem.

The fundamental quantity is the absorbed dose (''D''), which is defined as the mean energy imparted [by ionising radiation] (dE) per unit mass (dm) of material (D = dE/dm)&lt;ref name="Measurements 2011"&gt;International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU).Options for Characterizing Energy Deposition. Journal of the ICRU Vol 11 No 2 (2011) Report 86&lt;/ref&gt; The SI unit of absorbed dose is the gray (Gy) defined as one joule per kilogram. Absorbed dose, as a point measurement, is suitable for describing localised (i.e. partial organ) exposures such as tumour dose in radiotherapy. It may be used to estimate stochastic risk provided the amount and type of tissue involved is stated. Localised diagnostic dose levels are typically in the 0-50 mGy range. At a dose of 1 milligray (mGy) of photon radiation, each cell nucleus is crossed by an average of 1 liberated electron track.&lt;ref&gt;Feinendegen LE. The cell dose concept; potential application in radiation protection. 1990 Phys. Med. Biol. 35 597&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equivalent dose===
{{Main article|equivalent dose}}
The absorbed dose required to produce a certain biological effect varies between different types of radiation, such as [[photons]], [[neutrons]] or [[alpha particles]]. This is taken into account by the equivalent dose (H), which is defined as the mean dose to organ T by radiation type R (''D''&lt;sub&gt;T,R&lt;/sub&gt;), multiplied by a weighting factor ''W''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; . This designed to take into account the  [[RBE|biological effectiveness]] (RBE) of the radiation type,&lt;ref name="Measurements 2011"/&gt; For instance, for the same absorbed dose in Gy, alpha particles are 20 times as biologically potent as X or gamma rays. The measure of ‘dose equivalent’ is not organ averaged and now only used for "operational quantities". Equivalent dose is designed for estimation of stochastic risks from radiation exposures. Stochastic effect is defined for radiation dose assessment as the ''probability'' of cancer induction and genetic damage.&lt;ref&gt;The ICRP says "In the low dose range, below about 100 mSv, it is scientifically plausible to assume that the incidence of cancer or heritable effects will rise in direct proportion to an increase in the equivalent dose in the relevant organs and tissues" ICRP publication 103 paragraph 64&lt;/ref&gt;

As dose is averaged over the whole organ; equivalent dose is rarely suitable for evaluation of acute radiation effects or tumour dose in radiotherapy. In the case of estimation of stochastic effects, assuming a [[LNT model|linear dose response]], this averaging out should make no difference as the total energy imparted remains the same.

===Effective dose===
{{Main article|Effective dose (radiation)}}

Effective dose is the central dose quantity for radiological protection used to specify exposure limits to ensure that the occurrence of stochastic health effects is kept below unacceptable levels and that tissue reactions are avoided.&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103, paragraph 112&lt;/ref&gt;

It is difficult to compare the stochastic risk from localised exposures of different parts of the body (e.g. a chest x-ray compared to a CT scan of the head), or to compare exposures of the same body part but with different exposure patterns (e.g. a cardiac CT scan with a cardiac nuclear medicine scan). One way to avoid this problem is to simply average out a localised dose over the whole body. The problem of this approach is that the stochastic risk of cancer induction varies from one tissue to another.

The effective dose ''E'' is designed to account for this variation by the application of specific weighting factors for each tissue (''W''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;). Effective dose provides the equivalent whole body dose that gives the same risk as the localised exposure. It is defined as the sum of equivalent doses to each organ (''H''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;), each multiplied by its respective tissue weighting factor (''W''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;).

Weighting factors are calculated by the International Commission for Radiological Protection (ICRP), based on the risk of cancer induction for each organ and adjusted for associated lethality, quality of life and years of life lost. Organs that are remote from the site of irradiation will only receive a small equivalent dose (mainly due to scattering) and therefore contribute little to the effective dose, even if the weighting factor for that organ is high.

Effective dose is used to estimate stochastic risks for a ‘reference’ person, which is an average of the population. It is not suitable for estimating stochastic risk for individual medical exposures, and is not used to assess acute radiation effects.

==Dose versus source or field strength==
Radiation dose refers to the amount of energy deposited in matter and/or biological effects of radiation, and should not be confused with the unit of radioactive activity ([[becquerel]], Bq) of the source of radiation, or the strength of the radiation field (fluence).  The article on the [[sievert]] gives an overview of dose types and how they are calculated. Exposure to a source of radiation will give a dose which is dependent on many factors, such as the activity, duration of exposure, energy of the radiation emitted, distance from the source and amount of shielding.

===Background radiation===
The worldwide average background dose for a human being is about 3.5 mSv per year [https://web.archive.org/web/20031117124002/http://www.arpansa.gov.au/pubs/baseline/bg_rad.pdf], mostly from [[cosmic radiation]] and natural [[isotope]]s in the earth.  The largest single source of radiation exposure to the general public is naturally occurring [[radon]] gas, which comprises approximately 55% of the annual background dose.  It is estimated that radon is responsible for 10% of lung cancers in the United States.

===Calibration standards for measuring instruments===
Because the human body is approximately 70% water and has an overall density close to 1 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, dose measurement is usually calculated and calibrated as dose to water.

National standards laboratories such as the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK|NPL]] provide calibration factors for ionization chambers and other measurement devices to convert from the instrument's readout to absorbed dose. The standards laboratories operate a Primary Standard, which is normally calibrated by absolute [[calorimetry]], the warming of substances when they absorb energy. A user sends their Secondary Standard to the laboratory, where it is exposed to a known amount of radiation (derived from the Primary Standard) and a factor is issued to convert the instrument's reading to that dose. The user may then use their Secondary Standard to derive calibration factors for other instruments they use, which then become tertiary standards, or field instruments.

The [[National Physical Laboratory, UK|NPL]] in the UK operates a graphite-calorimeter for absolute photon dosimetry.  Graphite is used instead of water as its [[specific heat capacity]] is one-sixth that of water and therefore the temperature rises in graphite are 6 times more than the equivalent in water and measurements are more accurate.  Significant problems exist in insulating the graphite from the laboratory in order to measure the tiny temperature changes.  A lethal dose of radiation to a human is approximately 10–20 Gy.  This is 10-20 joules per kilogram.  A 1&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; piece of graphite weighing 2&amp;nbsp;grams would therefore absorb around 20–40 mJ.  With a specific heat capacity of around 700 J·kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, this equates to a temperature rise of just 20 mK.

Dosimeters in radiotherapy ([[linear particle accelerator]] in external beam therapy) are routinely calibrated using [[ionization chamber]]s&lt;ref&gt;Hill R, Mo Z, Haque M, Baldock C, 2009. An evaluation of ionization chambers for the relative dosimetry of kilovoltage x-ray beams. Medical Physics. 36 3971-3981.&lt;/ref&gt; or diode technology or gel dosimeters.&lt;ref&gt;Baldock C, De Deene Y, Doran S, Ibbott G, Jirasek A, Lepage M, McAuley KB, Oldham M, Schreiner LJ, 2010.

==Radiation exposure monitoring==
Records of legal dosimetry results are usually kept for a set period of time, depending upon the legal requirements of the nation in which they are used.

[[Radiation Exposure Monitoring|Medical radiation exposure monitoring]] is the practice of collecting dose information from radiology equipment and using the data to help identify opportunities to reduce unnecessary dose in medical situations.

The Oxford handbook of religion and ecology. "Hindu Religion and Environmental Well-being." O.P. Dwivedi. Oxford University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Ecospirituality has been critiqued for being an umbrella term for concepts such as [[deep ecology]], [[ecofeminism]], and [[nature religion]].&lt;ref name="Schalkwyk, Annalet 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Bron Raymond. Dark green religion: Nature spirituality and the planetary future. Univ of California Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents may come from a range of faiths including: [[Islam]]; [[Jainism]]; [[Christianity]] ([[Catholicism]], [[Evangelicalism]] and [[Orthodox Christianity]]); [[Judaism]]; [[Buddhism]] and Indigenous traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ritz|first=Janet|title=Thoughts on Eco-Spirituality|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/janet-ritz/thoughts-on-ecospirituali_b_63595.html|accessdate=7 January 2014|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=8 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although many of their practices and beliefs may differ, a central claim is that there is "a spiritual dimension to our present ecological crisis."&lt;ref name=Vaughan2013&gt;{{cite news|last=Vaughan-Lee|first=Llewellyn|title=Eco-spirituality: towards a values-based economic structure|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/eco-spirituality-values-based-economic-structure|accessdate=7 January 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the environmentalist Sister Virginia Jones, "Eco-spirituality is about helping people experience 'the holy' in the natural world and to recognize their relationship as human beings to all creation.&lt;ref name=Bonfiglio /&gt;

Ecospirituality has been influenced by the ideas of [[deep ecology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Aburrow|first=Yvonne|title=Eco-spirituality and theology|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/sermonsfromthemound/2013/01/eco-spirituality-and-theology/|work=Sermons from the Mound|publisher=Pantheos|accessdate=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eco-spirituality|url=http://www.acton.org/public-policy/environmental-stewardship/eco-spirituality|publisher=Acton Institute|accessdate=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is characterized by "recognition of the inherent value of all living beings and the use of this view in shaping environmental policies" &lt;ref&gt;Drengson, Alan. 2012. "Some Thought on the Deep Ecology Movement." Foundation for Deep Ecology. http://www.deepecology.org/deepecology.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly to [[ecopsychology]], it refers to the connections between the science of ecology and the study of psychology.  'Earth-based' spirituality is another term related to ecospirituality; it is associated with pagan religious traditions and the work of prominent ecofeminist, [[Starhawk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Blumberg|first=Antonia|title=Celebrate The Winter Solstice With Los Angeles' Own Eco-Pagans|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/11/starhawk-los-angeles-ritual_n_4390396.html|accessdate=7 January 2014|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecospirituality refers to the intertwining of intuition and bodily awareness pertaining to a relational view between human beings and the planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journals2.scholarsportal.info/pdf/08980101/v18i0003/227_e.xml|publisher = American Holistic Nurses' Association|last = Lincoln|first = Valerie|page = 227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
Ecospirituality finds its history in the relationship between spirituality and the environment. Some scholars say it "flows from an understanding of cosmology or the story of the origin of the universe."  &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Delaney|first1 = Colleen|title = Ecospirituality: The Experience of Environmental Meditation in Patients With Cardiovascular Disease|journal = Holistic Nursing Practice|volume = 23|issue=6|pages = 362}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are multiple origin stories about how the spiritual relationship with people and the environment began. In [[Indigenous American philosophy|Native America philosophy]], there are many unique stories of how spirituality came to be. A common theme in a number of them is the discussion of a Great Spirit that lives within the universe and the earth represents its presence.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Ecospirituality has also sprung from a reaction to the Western world's materialism and consumerism, characterized by ecotheologian [[Thomas Berry]] as a "crisis of cosmology."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Scholars have argued that "the modern perspective is based on science and focused on the human self with everything else being outside, resulting in the demise of the metaphysical world and the disenchantment with the cosmos." &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Therefore, ecospirituality originates as a rebuttal to the emphasis on the material as well as Western separation from the environment, where the environment is regarded as a set of material resources with primarily instrumental value.

== Ecological crisis ==
Ecospirituality became popularized due to a need for a reconceptualization of the human relationship with the environment. Terms such as environmental crisis, ecological crisis, climate change, global warming all refer to an ongoing global issue that needs to be addressed. Generally the ecological crisis is referring to the destruction of the earth’s ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Ecological Crisis|url = http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199680856.001.0001/acref-9780199680856-e-999|doi = 10.1093/acref/9780199680856.001.0001/acref-9780199680856-e-999|last = Mayhew|first = Susan|date = 2015|journal = A Dictionary of Geography|publisher = Oxford Reference}}&lt;/ref&gt; What this encompasses is a highly controversial debate in scientific and political spheres.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is Climate Change?|url = http://www.davidsuzuki.org/issues/climate-change/science/climate-change-basics/climate-change-101-1/|website = David Suzuki Foundation|accessdate = 2015-12-07|date = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Globally we are faced with pollution of our basic needs (air, and water) as well as the depletion of important resources, most notably food resources.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Annette Van Schalkwyk refers to the environmental crisis as “man-made”.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; It is arguably the result of a “mechanistic and capitalistic world view”.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Whether it is man-made, or as some argue, a natural occurrence, humans are not helping. Pollution and depletion of resources play a major role in the ecological crisis.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Bringing religion into the ecological crisis is controversial due to the divide between religion and science. Ecospirituality is prepared to acknowledge science, and work in tandem with religion to frame the environment as a sacred entity in need of protection.

Mary Evelyn Tucker notes the importance of religion and ecology connecting with sustainability. Due to the environmental crisis, perceptions of [[sustainability]] are changing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = World Religions, the Earth Charter, and Sustainability|url = http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/156853508x359930;jsessionid=c0hosllagal8n.x-brill-live-02|journal = Worldviews: Global Religions, Culture, and Ecology|date = 2008-11-01|issn = 1568-5357|pages = 115–128|volume = 12|issue = 2|doi = 10.1163/156853508X359930|first = Mary Evelyn|last = Tucker}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religion and ecology, and the way people experience ecospirituality, could contribute to this changing definition of sustainability.

== Research on ecospirituality ==

Ecospirituality has been studied by academics in order to understand a clearer definition of what individuals label as ecospirituality and the framework in which they create this definition. One study focused on [[Holistic nursing|holistic nurses]], who themselves characterize their profession as having a fundamentally spiritual nature and a sense of the importance of the environment.&lt;ref name="Lincoln, Valerie 2000 p. 227"&gt;Lincoln, Valerie (September 2000).  American Holistic Nurses' Association. p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers performed a phenomenological study where they assessed the nurses' ecospiritual consciousness. For the purpose of their study, they defined ecospiritual consciousness as "accessing a deep awareness of one's ecospiritual relationship."&lt;ref name="Lincoln, Valerie 2000 p. 227"/&gt; They then narrowed down their findings to the five principles of ecospiritual consciousness, which are: tending, dwelling, reverence, connectedness, and sentience.&lt;ref name="Lincoln, Valerie 2000 p. 227"/&gt;
# Tending was defined as "being awake and conscious," with "deep, inner self-reflection."&lt;ref name="Lincoln, Valerie 2000 p. 227"/&gt;
# Dwelling was defined as "a process of being with the seen and the unseen."&lt;ref name="Lincoln, Valerie 2000 p. 227"/&gt;
# Reverence was defined as "rediscovering the mystery present present in all creation and is embodied sense of the sacred," focusing on the earth.&lt;ref name="Lincoln, Valerie 2000 p. 227"/&gt;
# Connectedness was defined as an "organic relationship with the universe." &lt;ref name="Lincoln, Valerie 2000 p. 227"/&gt;
# Sentience was defined as "a sense of knowing."&lt;ref name="Lincoln, Valerie 2000 p. 227"/&gt;
Another study looked at medical effects of ecospirituality by having patients with cardiovascular disease practice "environmental meditation" and log regular journal entries about their experiences.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Delaney, Colleen. "Ecospirituality: The Experience of Environmental Meditation in Patients With Cardiovascular Disease". Holistic Nursing Practice. 23(6): 362.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers started out with the research question of, ''"What is the essence of the experience of ecospirituality meditation in patients with CVD?"'' CVD is an acronym for [[Cardiovascular Disease|cardiovascular disease]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; From analyzing journal entries of participants, researchers abstracted four major themes of ecospirituality meditation: entering a new time zone, environmental reawakening, finding a new rhythm, and the creation of a healing environment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;
# Entering a new time zone was described by researchers as "the expansion of time during meditation."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Delaney, Colleen. "Ecospirituality: The Experience of Environmental Meditation in Patients With Cardiovascular Disease". Holistic Nursing Practice. 23(6): 366.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Environmental Reawakening was described by researchers as "opened participants’ eyes to vistas not previously noticed"&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
# Finding a new rhythm was described by the researchers as "enhanced relationships with their family, friends, coworkers, and even their pets."&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Delaney, Colleen. "Ecospirituality: The Experience of Environmental Meditation in Patients With Cardiovascular Disease". Holistic Nursing Practice. 23(6): 367.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The creation of a healing environment was described by the researchers as "With raised consciousnesses, they became aware of the choices they had regarding what types of intentions and energy that wanted to put out in their environment"&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;
This research was driven by the goal of raising awareness among healthcare professionals about ecospirituality and the medical importance of both self and environmental consciousness. Anecdotal evidence showed a decrease in [[blood pressure]].&lt;ref&gt;Delaney, Colleen. "Ecospirituality: The Experience of Environmental Meditation in Patients With Cardiovascular Disease". Holistic Nursing Practice. 23(6): 368.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the psychological benefits of environmental meditation were the main focus for the researchers.

==Dark Green Religion==

Dark Green Religion is one way in which people, both secular and religious, connect with nature on a spiritual level.  [[Bron Taylor]] defines Dark Green Religion as "religion that considers nature to be sacred, imbued by intrinsic value, and worthy of reverent care" in his book ''Dark Green Religion: Nature Spirituality and the Planetary Future.'' &lt;ref name="Taylor, Bron 2009"&gt;Taylor, Bron. "Dark green religion." Nature Spirituality and the Planetary Future. UC Berkeley (2009). xi.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Nature religion]] is an overarching term of which Dark Green Religion is a part of. A key part of Dark Green Religion is the "depth of its consideration of nature." &lt;ref name="Taylor, Bron 2009"/&gt;
Dark Green Religion differs from Green Religion. Green Religion claims that it is a religious obligation for humans to be environmental stewards, while Dark Green Religion is a movement that simply holds nature as valuable and sacred.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Bron. "Dark green religion." Nature Spirituality and the Planetary Future. UC Berkeley (2009). 10.&lt;/ref&gt;
Spiritual types of Dark Green Religion include [[Spiritual naturalism|Naturalistic]] and [[Supernatural]]istic forms of [[Animism]] and of [[Gaianism]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Taylor, Bron. "Dark green religion." Nature Spirituality and the Planetary Future. UC Berkeley (2009). 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The diverse views within Dark Green Religion are not without the idea that the earth is sacred and worthy of care. The perceptions of Dark Green Religion are global and flexible. Taylor's use of the word 'Dark' gestures toward these negative possibilities. According to Taylor, Dark Green Religion has the possibility to "inspire the emergence of a global, civic, earth religion."&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Bron. "Dark green religion." Nature Spirituality and the Planetary Future. UC Berkeley (2009). x.&lt;/ref&gt; Dark Green, Green and Nature Religions are arguably all a part of ecospirituality. The term ecospirituality is versatile and overarching.

==Ecofeminism and spirituality==
The umbrella term "ecospirituality" covers the feminist theology called [[Ecofeminism]].&lt;ref name="Ecofeminism 2010"&gt;Elizabeth A Johnson on Ecofeminism (Burke Lecture: An Ecological Inquiry – Jesus and the Cosmos) University of California Television, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ecofeminism was first coined by the French writer Françoise D'Eaubonne in her book, ''Le Féminisme ou la Mort'' in order to name the connection between the patriarchal subjugation of women and the destruction of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford, Anne. ''Introducing Feminist Theology''. Marknoll: Orbis Books: 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In it, she argues that women have different ways of seeing and relating to the world than men.&lt;ref name="Annie L. Booth 1999"&gt;Does the Spirit Move You? Environmental Spirituality – Annie L. Booth, Faculty of Natural Resources and Environmental Studies University of Northern British Columbia, Environmental Values Vol. 8, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; These differences can give rise alternative insights on interactions between humans and the natural world when women's perspectives are considered.&lt;ref name="Annie L. Booth 1999"/&gt; The suppression and control of woman and the natural world are connected.&lt;ref name="Annie L.

Booth 1999"/&gt; By understanding the connection between femininity and nature and by exploring feminine ways of seeing and relating, ecofeminism asserts that humans can realize positive ways of interacting with the natural world and with each other.&lt;ref name="Annie L. Booth 1999"/&gt;

=== Ecofeminism and Christianity on the ecological crisis ===
A significant figure in Christian ecofeminism is [[Rosemary Radford Ruether]]. Ruether argues that feminism and ecology share a common vision, even though they use different languages.&lt;ref name="Ruether, Rosemary Radford 1992"&gt;Ruether, Rosemary Radford. ''Gaia and God: An Ecofeminist Theology of Earth Healing.'' San Francisco: HarperCollins, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; In her work, ''Gaia and God: An Ecofeminist Theology of Earth Healing'' Ruether provides three recommendations on ways to move forward with repairing and "healing" the ecological crisis.&lt;ref name="Ruether, Rosemary Radford 1992"/&gt; The first recommendation is that "the ecological crisis needs to be seen not just as a crisis in the health of nonhuman ecosystems, polluted water, contaminated skies, threatened climate change, deforestation, extinction of species, important as all these realities are. Rather one needs to see the interconnections between the impoverishment of the earth and the impoverishment of human groups, even as others are enriching themselves to excess."&lt;ref name="Ruether, Rosemary Radford 1992"/&gt; The second recommendation is that "a healed ecosystem – humans, animals, land, air, and water together – needs to be understood as requiring a new way of life, not just a few adjustments here and there."&lt;ref name="Ruether, Rosemary Radford 1992"/&gt; The third and final recommendation is that the need for a new vision is necessary: "one needs to nurture the emergence of a new planetary vision and communal ethic that can knit together people across religions and cultures. There is rightly much dismay at the role that religions are playing in right-wing politics and even internecine violence today. But we need also to recognize the emergence of new configurations of inter-religious relations."&lt;ref name="Ruether, Rosemary Radford 1992"/&gt;

===Ecofeminism and Christianity in liberation theology ===
According to [[Ivone Gebara]], in Latin America, particularly in Christian Churches in Brazil, it is difficult to be a feminist, but more difficult to be an ecofeminist.&lt;ref name="Gebara, Ivone 2003"&gt;Gebara, Ivone. “Ecofeminism: A Latin American Perspective.” Crosscurrents, Spring 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Gebara explains ecology as one of the "deepest concerns of feminism and ecology as having a deep resonance or a political and anthropolocial consequence from a feminist perspective."&lt;ref name="Gebara, Ivone 2003"/&gt; Gebara believes that it is the task of different groups of Latin American women to "provide a new order of meaning including marginalized people."&lt;ref name="Gebara, Ivone 2003"/&gt; This task is both challenging and political. Gebara says: "We can choose the life of the planet and the respect of all living beings or we choose to die by our own bad decisions."&lt;ref name="Gebara, Ivone 2003"/&gt;

=== Ecospirituality and paganism ===
Paganism is a nature-based religion that exists in a multitude of forms.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Introduction to Pagan Studies|last = Davy|first = Barbara Jane|publisher = |year = 2006|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no official doctrine or sacred text that structures its practice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Due to its lack of structure, many Pagans believe that it should be used as a tool to combat the current ecological crisis because it is flexible and can adapt to the environment's needs.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.thegreenfuse.org/harris/sacredeco.htm|title = Sacred Ecology|date = |accessdate = |website = The Green Fuse|publisher = |last = Collins|first = Harper}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecospirituality advocates contend that an ecology-based religion that focuses on the nurturing and healing of the earth is necessary in modernity.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Sacredness and Sustainability: Searching for a Practical Eco-Spirituality|last = Van Schalkwyk|first = Annalet|date = 2011|journal = Religion and Theology|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; As paganism is already based in nature worship, many believe it would be a useful starting point for ecospirituality.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ecopagan.com/|title = A Pagan Community Statement on the Environment|date = |accessdate = |website = Ecopagan|publisher = |last = Halstead|first = John}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, [[Modern Paganism|neopagan]] revivals have seen the emergence of pagan communities that are more earth-focused. They may build their rituals around advocacy for a sustainable lifestyle and emphasize complete interconnectedness with the earth.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Paganism understands divine figures to exist not as transcendent beings, but as immanent beings in the present realm,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; meaning that their divine figures exist within each of us, and within nature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many pagans believe in ''interconnectedness'' among all living beings, which allows them to foster moments of self-reflection before acting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These pagan ideals coincide with ecospirituality because pagans understand the environment to be part of the divine realm and part of their inner self. Therefore, in their view, harming the environment directly affects their wellbeing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://cicministry.org/scholarly/sch012.htm|title = Neo-paganism and Environmental Ethics|date = 1995|accessdate = |website = Critical Issues Commentary Scholarly|publisher = |last = DeWaay|first = Bob}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pagans have already recognized the importance of incorporating environmental ideologies with their own religious beliefs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.religionandnature.com/ern/sample/Harris--Dragon.pdf|title = Dragon Environmental Network|date = 2005|accessdate = |website = Religion and Nature|publisher = London &amp; New York: Continuum|last = Taylor|first = Bron}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dragon Environmental Network is a pagan community based in the UK. They are committed to practicing "eco-magic" with the intention of recognizing the earth as sacred and divine.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Their four goals are as follows:&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
# Increase general awareness of the sacredness of the Earth.
# Encourage pagans to become involved in conservation work.
# Encourage pagans to become involved in environmental campaigns.
# Develop the principles and practice of magical and spiritual action for the environment.  
Paganism combines religion with environmental activism. Pagans organize protests, campaigns, and petitions with the environment in mind while staying true to their religious beliefs.  [[Bron Taylor]], argues that their core Pagan beliefs greatly improves their environmental activism.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Additionally, the Pagan community has recently released a statement on the ecological crisis.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It explains that Pagans lead lives that foster “harmony with the rhythms of our great Earth" and that they view the Earth as their equal in stating “we are neither above nor separate from the rest of nature”. It states that we are part of a web of life, and are fully interconnected with the biosphere. This connection to all living beings is seen as spiritual and sacred. And in turn it provides a framework that Pagans can use to combine their religious beliefs with environmental activism. It calls for a return to ancient understandings of the earth by listening to ancient wisdom. It asks Pagans to practice their religion in all aspects of their lives in order to give the Earth room to heal. The statement concludes by stating “building a truly sustainable culture means transforming the systems of domination and exploitation that threaten our future into systems of symbiotic partnership that support our ecosystems”.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Ecospirituality and Christianity ===
Most Christian theology has centered on the doctrine of creation.&lt;ref name="Ecofeminism 2010"/&gt; According to [[Elizabeth Johnson (theologian)|Elizabeth Johnson]], in recent years, this has led to growing ecological awareness among Christians.&lt;ref name="Ecofeminism 2010"/&gt; The logic of this stance is rooted in the theological idea that since God created the world freely, it has an intrinsic value and is worthy of our respect and care.&lt;ref name="Ecofeminism 2010"/&gt; In 1990, [[Pope John Paul II]] wrote a letter on ecological issues.&lt;ref name="Ecofeminism 2010"/&gt; He concluded the letter with a discussion of Christian belief and how it should lead to ethical care of the earth.&lt;ref name="Ecofeminism 2010"/&gt; He ended the letter with the principle "respect for life and the dignity of human person must extend also to the rest of creation."&lt;ref name="Ecofeminism 2010"/&gt;

The doctrines of Christ that Christians follow also have the potential for ecological spirituality for they support interpretations that are consistent with ecospirituality.&lt;ref name="Ecofeminism 2010"/&gt; According to Elizabeth Johnson, Jesus' view of the Kingdom of God included earthly wellbeing.&lt;ref name="Ecofeminism 2010"/&gt;  According to [[Thomas Berry]], Christians recognize a need for an Earth Ethic.&lt;ref name="Berry, Thomas 2009"&gt;Berry, Thomas. ''The Christian Future and the Fate of Earth.'' Orbis Books: New York, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, leader of the Greek Orthodox Church, has organized major religion and science symposia on water issues across Europe, the Amazon River and Greenland.&lt;ref name="Berry, Thomas 2009"/&gt; He has issued statements – including a joint statement with John Paul II in 2002 – calling destruction of the environment "ecological sin."&lt;ref name="Berry, Thomas 2009"/&gt;  Bishop Malone, president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops has said: "The Church stands in need of a new symbolic and affective system through which to proclaim the Gospel to the modern world."&lt;ref name="Thomas Berry 1985, page 26"&gt;Thomas Berry, "Christian Cosmology." ''The Christian Future and the Fate of Earth'', 1985, page 26.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ecotheology of the late [[Thomas Berry]], he argues that Christians often fail to realize that both their social and religious wellbeing depend on the wellbeing of Earth.&lt;ref name="Thomas Berry 1985, page 26"/&gt; Earth provides sustenance for physical, imaginative and emotions, and religious wellbeing.&lt;ref name="Thomas Berry 1985, page 26"/&gt; In Thomas Berry's view, the Christian future will depend on the ability of Christians to assume their responsibility for Earth's fate.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Berry, "The Christian Future and the Fate of Earth," ''The Christian Future and the Fate of Earth'', 1989, page 35.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such responsibility-taking can be seen in the founding of an association called "Sisters of Earth," which is made up of nuns and laywomen.&lt;ref name="Thomas Berry 1994, page 78"&gt;Thomas Berry, "Women Religious: Voices of Earth," ''The Christian Future and the Fate of Earth'', 1994, page 78.&lt;/ref&gt; This network of women from diverse religious communities is significant, both for the movement of general concern for the natural world and for the religious life in Christian contexts.&lt;ref name="Thomas Berry 1994, page 78"/&gt;

=== Ecospirituality and Hinduism  ===

Many teachings in [[Hinduism]] are intertwined with the ethics of ecospirituality in their stress on environmental wellbeing. The Hindu text called the ''[[Taittiriya Upanishad|Taittariya Upanishad]]'' refers to creation as offspring of the Supreme Power, ''[[paramatman]]''. Thus, the environment is related to something that is divine and therefore deserves respect.&lt;ref name="Gottlieb, Roger S. 2006"/&gt; Since the late 1980s when the negative effects of mass industrialization were becoming popularized, India instituted administrative policies to deal with environmental conservation. These policies were rooted in the ways that the Hindu religion is tied to the land.&lt;ref name="Gottlieb, Roger S. 2006"/&gt;

In the Hindu text ''Vajur Veda'' (32.10), God is described as being present in all living things, further reinforcing the need to show respect for creation.&lt;ref name="Gottlieb, Roger S. 2006"/&gt; Passages such as this lead some Hindus to become [[vegetarians|vegetarian]] and to affirm a broader type of ecospiritual connection to the Earth. ''[[Vishnu Purana]]'' 3.8.15. states that, "God, Kesava, is pleased with a person who does not harm or destroy other non-speaking creatures or animals." &lt;ref name="Gottlieb, Roger S. 2006"/&gt; This notion is tied in with the Hindu concept of [[Karma in Hinduism|karma]]. Karma means that the pain caused to other living things will come back to you through the process of [[reincarnation]].&lt;ref name="Gottlieb, Roger S. 2006"/&gt;

Ecospirituality can also be seen in the ''Prithivi Sukta'' which is a "Hymn to Mother Earth."&lt;ref name="Gottlieb, Roger S. 2006"/&gt; In this text, the Earth is humanized into a spiritual being to which humans have familial ties. Through ecospirituality, the notion of praising and viewing the Earth in this way brings about its strong connections to Hinduism.

===Ecospirituality and Jainism===

Contemporary [[Jainism|Jaina faith]] is “inherently ecofriendly.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Key Chapple|first1=Christopher|editor1-last=Gottlieb|editor1-first=Roger S.|title=Jainism and Ecology|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-974762-7|pages=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In terms of the ecological crisis, Jains are “quite self-conscious of the ecological implications of their core teachings.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Key Chapple|first1=Christopher|editor1-last=Gottlieb|editor1-first=Roger S.|title=Jainism and Ecology|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-974762-7|pages=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jain teachings center on five vows that lead to reverse the flow of  or release karma. One of these vows is [[ahimsa]] or non-violence. Ahimsa “is said to contain the key to advancement along the spiritual path (sreni). This requires abstaining from harm to any being that possesses more than one sense”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Key Chapple|first1=Christopher|editor1-last=Gottlieb|editor1-first=Roger S.|title=Jainism and Ecology|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-974762-7|pages=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principles of the Jaina tradition are rooted in environmental practices. The Jaina connection to nature is conducive to ecospirituality.

=== Ecospirituality and Islam ===

Some scholars argue that while looking at the scriptural sources of [[Islam]], you can see it is an ecologically orientated religion.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;[[Richard Foltz]], "Islam." in Roger S. Gottlieb, ed., ''The Oxford Handbook of Religion and Ecology''. Oxford University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Looking at textual sources of Islam, the [[shari'a]] preach a number of environmentally focused guidelines to push environmentalism, in particular, "maintenance of preserves, distribution of water, and the development of virgin lands."&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Much of Muslim environmentalism is a result of the [[Quran|Qur'anic]] stress of stewardship which is explained through the Arabic concept ''[[Caliphate|khilafa]]''.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; A quote translated from the ''[[hadith]]'' states, "verily, this world is sweet and appealing, and Allah placed you as vice-regents thereinl he will see what you do."&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Within the Islamic faith, there is a set importance to following the messages set forth in scripture, therefore the environmentalism spoken through them has led to a spirituality around the environment. This spirituality can also be seen with Qur'anic concept of ''[[tawhid]]'', which translates to unity.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Many Muslim environmentalists see this meaning spiritually as "all-inclusive" when in relation to the Earth.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

A majority of Muslim writers draw attention to the environmental crisis as a direct result of social injustice.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;  Many argue that the problem is not that, "humans as a species are destroying the balance of nation, but rather that ''some'' humans are taking more than their share."&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Muslim environmentalists such as [[Fazlun Khalid]], [[Yasin Dutton]], Omar Vadillo, and Hashim Dockrat have drawn a correlation between the capitalist nature of the global economy to being un-Islamic and essentiality leading to ecological crisis.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

The issues of environmental degradation are especially important to Muslims as majority of Muslims live in developing countries where they see the effects of the ecological crisis on a daily basis.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; This has led to conferences discussing Islam and the environment to take place in [[Iran]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] as well as the introduction of environmental nongovernmental organizations.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

=== Ecospirituality and Buddhism ===
[[Buddhism]] has been around for hundreds of years, however with the modern knowledge on topics such as [[global warming]], many Buddhist scholars have looked back at how Buddhist teaching would respond to the environmental crisis and created what is called Green Buddhism.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Gottlieb, Roger S., ed. The Oxford handbook of religion and ecology. "The Greening of Buddhism." Stephanie Kaza. Oxford University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the key players in this introduction was [[Gary Snyder]] who brought to light where Buddhist practice and ecological thinking intertwine.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Green Buddhism made waves in the 1980s when they publicly address the ecological crisis to create awareness and in 1989 when the [[Dalai Lama]] won a [[Nobel Peace Prize|Noble Peace Prize]] for the proposed introduction of [[Tibet]] as an ecological reserve.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Buddhism has been open to working with other world religions to combat the environment crisis seen at an international conference for Buddhist-Christian studies that addressed the environment.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Although Green Buddhism has not commented much on technical issues such as air and water pollution, they use their spirituality to focus heavily on "rich resources for immediate application in [[Ethical eating|food ethics]], [[animal rights]], and [[consumerism]]."&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9718">'''Feature integration theory''' is a theory of [[attention]] developed in 1980 by [[Anne Treisman]] and [[Garry Gelade]] that suggests that when perceiving a stimulus, features are "registered early, automatically, and in parallel, while objects are identified separately" and at a later stage in processing. The theory has been one of the most influential [[cognitive model|psychological model]]s of human visual [[attention]]. 

==Stages==
According to Treisman, the first stage of the feature integration theory is the preattentive stage.  During this stage, different parts of the brain automatically gather information about basic features (colors, shape, movement) that are found in the visual field. The idea that features are automatically separated appears to be counterintuitive; however, we are not aware of this process because it occurs early in perceptual processing, before we become conscious of the object.

The second stage of the feature integration theory is the focused attention stage, where the individual features of an object combine in order to perceive the whole object. In order to combine the individual features of an object, attention is required and selection of that object occurs within a "master map" of locations. The master map of locations contains all of the locations in which features have been detected, with each location in the master map having access to the multiple feature maps. When attention is focused at a particular location on the map, the features currently in that position are attended to and are stored in "object files". If the object is familiar, associations are made between the object and prior knowledge, which results in identification of that object. In support of this stage, researchers often refer to patients suffering from [[Balint's syndrome]]. Due to damage in the parietal lobe, these people are unable to focus attention on individual objects. Given a stimulus that requires combining features, people suffering from Balint's syndrome are unable to focus attention long enough to combine the features, providing support for this stage of the theory. 

[[File:FITstages.png|alt=The stages of feature integration theory|thumb|300px|The stages of feature integration theory]]

Treisman distinguishes between two kinds of visual search tasks, "feature search" and "conjunction search". Feature searches can be performed fast and pre-attentively for targets defined by only one feature, such as color, shape, perceived direction of lighting, movement, or orientation. Features should "pop out" during search and should be able to form [[illusory conjunctions]]. Conversely, conjunction searches occur with the combination of two or more features and are identified serially. Conjunction search is much slower than feature search and requires conscious attention and effort. In multiple experiments, some referenced in this article, Treisman concluded that [[color]], [[Orientation (geometry)|orientation]], and [[intensity (disambiguation)|intensity]] are features for which feature searches may be performed.

As a reaction to the feature integration theory, Wolfe (1994) proposed the Guided Search Model 2.0. According to this model, attention is directed to an object or location through a preattentive process. The preattentive process, as Wolfe explains, directs attention in both a bottom-up and top-down way. Information acquired through both bottom-up and top-down processing is ranked according to priority. The priority ranking ''guides'' visual search and makes the search more efficient. Whether the Guided Search Model 2.0 or the feature integration theory are "correct" theories of visual search is still a hotly debated topic.

==Experiments==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:fourshapesexp.png|thumb|alt=An example of four colored shapes and two black letters.|An example of the stimuli found in Treisman et al. (1982).]] --&gt;In order to test the notion that attention plays a vital role in visual perception, Treisman and Schmidt (1982) designed an experiment to show that features may exist independently of one another early in processing. Participants were shown a picture involving four objects hidden by two black numbers. The display was flashed for one-fifth of a second followed by a random-dot masking field that appeared on screen to eliminate "any residual perception that might remain after the stimuli were turned off".&lt;ref&gt;Cognitive Psychology, E. Bruce Goldstein, P 105&lt;/ref&gt; Participants were to report the black numbers they saw at each location where the shapes had previously been. The results of this experiment verified Treisman and Schmidt's hypothesis. In 18% of trials, participants reported seeing shapes "made up of a combination of features from two different stimuli",&lt;ref&gt;Cognitive Psychology, E. Bruce Goldstein, P 105&lt;/ref&gt; even when the stimuli had great differences; this is often referred to as an [[illusory conjunction]]. Specifically, illusory conjunctions occur in various situations. For example, you may identify a passing person wearing a red shirt and yellow hat and very quickly transform him or her into one wearing a yellow shirt and red hat. The feature integration theory provides explanation for illusory conjunctions; because features exist independently of one another during early processing and are not associated with a specific object, they can easily be incorrectly combined both in laboratory settings, as well as in real life situations.&lt;ref&gt;Treisman, A. Cognitive Psychology 12, 97-136 (1980)&lt;/ref&gt; 

As previously mentioned, Balint's syndrome patients have provided support for the feature integration theory. Particularly, Research participant R.M., a [[Bálint's syndrome]] sufferer who was unable to focus attention on individual objects, experiences illusory conjunctions when presented with simple stimuli such as a "blue O" or a "red T." In 23% of trials, even when able to view the stimulus for as long as 10 seconds, R.M. reported seeing a "red O" or a "blue T".&lt;ref&gt;Friedman-Hill et al., 1995; Robertson et al., 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; This finding is in accordance with feature integration theory's prediction of how one with a lack of focused attention would erroneously combine features.

[[File:treismanshapes.png|thumb|alt=The stimuli resembling a carrot, lake and tire, respectively.|The stimuli resembling a carrot, lake and tire, respectively. Treisman et al.(1986).]]

If people use their prior knowledge or experience to perceive an object, they are less likely to make mistakes, or illusory conjunctions. In order to explain this phenomenon, Treisman and Souther (1986) conducted an experiment in which they presented three shapes to participants where illusory conjunctions could exist. Surprisingly, when she told participants that they were being shown a carrot, lake, and tire (in place of the orange triangle, blue oval, and black circle, respectively), illusory conjunctions did not exist.&lt;ref&gt;Illusory words: The roles of attention and of top–down constraints in conjoining letters to form words.
By Treisman, Anne; Souther, Janet. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, Vol 12(1), Feb 1986, 3-17.&lt;/ref&gt; Treisman maintained that prior-knowledge played an important role in proper perception. Normally, bottom-up processing is used for identifying novel objects; but, once we recall prior knowledge, top-down processing is used. This explains why people are good at identifying familiar objects rather than unfamiliar.

==Reading==
When identifying letters while reading, not only are their shapes picked up but also other features like their colors and surrounding elements. Individual letters are processed serially when spatially conjoined with another letter. The locations of each feature of a letter are not known in advance, even while the letter is in front of the reader. Since the location of the letter's features and/or the location of the letter is unknown, feature interchanges can occur if one is not attentively focused. This is known as [[lateral masking]], which in this case, refers to a difficulty in separating a letter from the background.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Treisman and Garry Gelade (1980).

[[File:Mutand dAguila Joan Castejon Wax on Paper 1982 100x81.jpg|thumb|220px|'Mutant eagle', wax on paper, by Joan Castejon.]]
The Grup d' Elx artists began their training in an precarious artistic scenario. Its activity was a task that built a bridge between modernity and vertebrate and radical vanguard, which for them was inseparable from a social transition out of the [[Francoist]] dictatorship.  In this sense, as the members of El Paso  or [[Dau al set]], the artists of the Grup d' Elx conducted an art in which there are several components that are part of a common denominator: primacy of intense expressiveness, intentional reduction of color to a minimum and, finally, the belief in an artistic poetics of engagement centered on human beings and their social situation. In fact, one of its most representative members, [[Joan Castejón]], was imprisoned for four years.&lt;ref name="Así era entonces."&gt;{{cite news

The group was inspired by the activity of other postwar artistic groups such as [[Dau al Set]] and [[Grup Parpalló]]. Members of Grup d'Elx included [[Joan Castejón]], Albert Agulló, Antoni Coll y Sixto Marco.

The group dissolved in 1973.

'''Hardware interface design''' ('''HID''') is a cross-disciplinary design field that shapes the physical connection between people and technology in order to create new hardware interfaces that transform purely digital processes into analog methods of interaction. It employs a combination of filmmaking tools, software prototyping, and electronics breadboarding.

Through this parallel visualization and development, hardware interface designers are able to shape a cohesive vision alongside business and engineering that more deeply embeds design throughout every stage of the product. The development of hardware interfaces as a field continues to mature as more things connect to the internet.

Hardware interface designers draw upon [[industrial design]], [[interaction design]] and [[electrical engineering]]. Interface elements include [[touchscreens]], knobs, buttons, sliders and switches as well as input sensors such as microphones, cameras, and accelerometers.

== History ==

In the last decade a trend had evolved in the area of human-machine-communication, taking the user experience from haptic, tactile and acoustic interfaces to a more digitally graphical approach. Important tasks that had been assigned to the industrial designers so far, had instead been moved into fields like UI and UX design and usability engineering. The creation of good user interaction was more a question of software than hardware. Things like having to push two buttons on the tape recorder to have them pop back out again and the cradle of some older telephones remain mechanical haptic relicts that have long found their digital nemesis and are waiting to disappear.

However, this excessive use of GUIs in today’s world has led to a worsening impairment of the human cognitive capabilities. Visual interfaces are at the maximum of their upgradability. Even though the resolution of new screens is constantly rising, you can see a change of direction away from the descriptive intuitive design to natural interface strategies, based on learnable habits (Google’s [[Material Design]], Apple’s [[iOS]] flat design, Microsoft’s [[Metro Design Language]]). Several of the more important commands are not shown directly but can be accessed through dragging, holding and swiping across the screen; gestures which have to be learned once but feel very natural afterwards and are easy to remember.

In the area of controlling these systems, there is a need to move away from GUIs and instead find other means of interaction which use the full capabilities of all our senses. Hardware interface design solves this by taking physical forms and objects and connecting them with digital information to have the user control virtual data flow through grasping, moving and manipulating the used physical forms.

If you see the classic industrial hardware interface design as an “analog” method, it finds its digital counterpart in the HID approach. Instead of translating analog methods of control into a virtual form via a GUI, one can see the TUI as an approach to do the exact opposite: transmitting purely digital processes into analog methods of interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Human factors and ergonomics of future Smarthome Appliances|url=http://experimental-platform.tumblr.com/post/132397946935/human-factors-and-ergonomics-of-future-smarthome|publisher=Protonet|accessdate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3489">'''Helmut Winschermann''' (born 22 March 1920) is a German classical oboist, conductor and teacher.  He founded the [[Deutsche Bachsolisten]] (German Bach Soloists) and has been their conductor since 1960.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Deutsche Bachsolisten 1973 on tour of Southern Africa.jpeg|thumb|right|Photo 1973, Bachsolisten orchestra tour Southern Adrica.Dedicated to tour organiser Hans Adler.[http://classicalmusicianstoza.blogspot.ca/2014/06/deutche-bachsolisten-under-helmut.html] ≈]] --&gt;

==Career==
Helmut Winschermann was born in [[Mülheim|Mülheim an der Ruhr]] in 1920.  He became an orchestral oboist with the Municipal Orchestra of [[Oberhausen]] after studying in Essen and Paris.  From 1945 he was principal oboe with the [[hr-Sinfonieorchester|Frankfurt Radio Symphony Orchestra]] including in its period known as the Hessen Radio Symphony Orchestra.&lt;ref name=all&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/helmut-winschermann-mn0000574882/biography AllMusic]; Retrieved 27 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

With the flautist [[Kurt Redel]] and harpsichordist Irmgard Winschermann Lechner, he was a co-founder of the chamber music ensemble Collegium Pro Arte, later called the Collegium Instrumentale Detmold.

In 1956 he was appointed principal chair of the oboe department at the [[Hochschule für Musik Detmold]], having taught there since 1948.&lt;ref name=all/&gt;  His students include [[Hansjörg Schellenberger]], [[Fumiaki Miyamoto]], [[Ingo Goritzki]], Günther Passin and Gernot Schmalfuß.

He recorded the [[Oboe Quartet (Mozart)| Mozart Oboe Quartet in F Major (K.370)]] with the [[Günter Kehr|Kehr]] Trio issued in 1957 on [[Teldec|Telefunken]] LGX 66065 in the UK.

He maintained a touring schedule as a soloist, and frequently collaborated with the [[Cappella Coloniensis]], the Chamber Orchestra of the Saar under [[Karl Ristenpart]], and the [[Stuttgart Chamber Orchestra]] under [[Karl Münchinger]].

Winschermann founded the instrumental ensemble [[Deutsche Bachsolisten]] in 1960, in order to provide [[historically informed performance]]s of the music of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and his baroque contemporaries.  He initially divided his time between playing the oboe and conducting the group, but later focussed on conducting solely.&lt;ref name=all/&gt;  Under his direction they have made a multitude of recordings and toured widely internationally.  They are particularly popular in Japan, having visited there at least 14 times.&lt;ref name=all/&gt; 

In 2010 the group celebrated its 50th anniversary in a concert at the [[Beethovenhalle]] in [[Bonn]], with the 90-year-old Winschermann conducting his own orchestration of Bach's ''[[Goldberg Variations]]''.

==Honours==
In 1992 Helmut Winschermann was made an Honorary Member of the [[Royal Academy of Music]] in London.&lt;ref name=all/&gt;

In 2013 he won the [[Georg Philipp Telemann Prize]] of [[Magdeburg]].

He has twice been awarded the [[Edison Prize]].

== Summary ==
''How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time'' has forty chapters, which are grouped into six parts.

=== Part I. The Problem: We Need to Make Decisions, But We Don't Know How (Chapters 1–6) ===

For ethical advice to be credible, the book says it cannot be perceived as arbitrary.  The book cites [[The Dice Man]] – a man who makes choices based on dice rolls – as an example of advice-following which is arbitrary and so cannot be regarded as ethical.

Chapter three argues intuitions about what we should do can be more useful, but are undermined because our multiple intuitions often lead to contradictory advice (e.g. ‘help a stranger’ or ‘put family first’?).  Philosophers have sought to eliminate these contradictions by locating right and wrong in a single part of the decision-making process: for example, in the actions we take (e.g. [[Kant]]), in our character (e.g. [[Aristotle]], [[virtue ethics]]) or in the consequences of our actions (e.g. [[Utilitarianism]]).

Chapter four explains how ‘do whatever is best’ (utilitarianism) still dominates modern philosophical and economic thinking.

Chapter five cites seven faults with utilitarianism.  These are that it can be self-defeating; that it considers only future events and ignores the past; that it places decision-making authority in questionable hands; that it doesn’t discriminate fairly between people; that it sacrifices individual concerns to the group interest; that it down-grades promises, fairness and truth-telling; and that it doesn’t offer any clear rules.&lt;ref name="iainbking.files.wordpress.com"&gt;[https://iainbking.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/how-to-make-good-decisions-62-point-summary.pdf ''How to Make Good Decisions...'' a 62 point summary (pdf)]&lt;/ref&gt; The chapter also argues that the main argument for utilitarianism is invalid, and ‘empty’.&lt;ref&gt;http://leehopkins.com/counselling/2015/11/12/ethics-condundrum-1/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Part II. The Proof: Finding the Basics of Right and Wrong (Chapters 7–14) ===

Part II starts with a secular revision of [[Pascal’s Wager]],&lt;ref name="24 and Philosophy King"/&gt; arguing “What does it hurt to pursue value and virtue? If there is value, then we have everything to gain, but if there is none, then we haven’t lost anything.” Thus, it rationally makes sense for us to pursue something of value.&lt;ref name="24 and Philosophy King"/&gt;

It says that “people ultimately derive their choices from what they want to do and what other people want to do” &lt;ref&gt;[http://petergreenwell.com/essays/did-angela-do-good-or-bad/ ''Did Angela do Good or Bad?'' Peter Greenwell, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

It then presents four different arguments for deriving a basic principle from which right and wrong can be developed.  These are an adaptation of utilitarianism; an adaptation of [[John Rawls|John Rawls']] theory;&lt;ref name="iainbking.files.wordpress.com"/&gt; an argument from evolutionary theory;&lt;ref&gt;[https://philosophynow.org/issues/100/Moral_Laws_of_the_Jungle ''Moral Laws of the Jungle'', Philosophy Now magazine, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; and a '[[Sherlock Holmes]]' approach.

All four arguments converge on [[empathy]], [[duty|obligation]] and the ‘Help Principle’, which the book argues are kernels of a viable ethical system.&lt;ref name="24 and Philosophy King"/&gt; According to [[Audrey Tang]], King's philosophy advocates: "If spending one unit of your effort could help another person by two units, he detailed in his book, you should help."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/open-source-enlightenment-2015-part-1-audrey-tang ''Open Source Enlightenment'', Audrey Tang, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Part III. The Principle: Refining the Help Principle (Chapters 15–22) ===

Part III defines the Help Principle more carefully, with a section on [[autonomy]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ijbioethics.ir/fa/ManuscriptDetail?mid=5331 International Journal of Bio-Ethics, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; and a critique of the [[Golden Rule#Cannot be a sole guide to action|golden rule]].

It results in an approach to ethics which combines deontology, consequentialism and virtue ethics.  This has been described as quasi-utilitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;D’Souza, J. F. and Adams, C. K. (2016). "On Measuring the Moral Value of Action". ''Frontiers of Philosophy in China''. 11(1), pp. 122–136.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Part IV. The Program: Extending the Principles to Other Problems (Chapters 23–31) ===

Part IV attempts to distinguish white lies from bad lies.&lt;ref name="Watkins"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schokking"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.christopherxjjensen.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/gendels-ross-research-paper.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Contradicting [[Aristotle]], who believed no general rule on lying was possible, 'For he who advocates lying can never be believed or trusted,' and [[St Augustine]], who believed all lies were sinful, the book presents a definition of good lies, and argues why it is credible and superior.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2012/02/05/imp06.asp Sunday Observer (Sri Lanka), February 5th, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethiomedia.com/15store/4259  ''The Conundrum of Illicit Financial Flows'', Teshome Abebe, November 14, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapters 28 and 29 reconcile individual human rights with group interests.  Both individual justice and social justice feature.

=== Part V. Practical Advice: For Real People in the Modern World (Chapters 32–38) ===

Part V deals with situations when information is not certain, and other real world problems which are absent from much academic philosophy.  These problems make [[effective altruism]] impractical and rare.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ispitphilo.wordpress.com/ ''Food for the Mind'', by Blake Hall, May 1, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter 34 argues that the notion of [[integrity]] can only make sense in ethics if it is applied to the consequences people allow to happen rather than to people themselves.

=== Part VI. The Prognosis: How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time (Chapters 39–40) ===

Part VI claims a hybrid system can be internally-consistent and address several problems of the main schools of ethics.&lt;ref name="24 and Philosophy King"/&gt;

Chapter 40 concludes it is impossible to make good decisions all the time because we can never know enough about the world, and the consequences of our actions.  Hence, ethics can never emulate the scientific revolution by offering a simple set of rules for every situation, similar to those derived by Newton.  This is because Newton’s own rules can never be applied perfectly, because we can never know how the world really is.

== About the book ==
It was published on December 1, 2008.&lt;ref name="pw"/&gt;  It became a bestseller within the category of philosophy books in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://issuu.com/bloomsburyacademic/docs/philosophy2013 Philosophy Books, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

The book answers the [[Expressivism#Objections to expressivism|Frege–Geach Problem]], the [[is ought problem|Fact–Value Gap]], and the [[Open Question Argument]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://talks.cam.ac.uk/talk/index/63048 'Moral Philosophy for Elves' (University of Cambridge, United Kingdom)]&lt;/ref&gt; although the given answers have been challenged.&lt;ref name=Crocker /&gt;&lt;ref name="iainbking.files.wordpress.com"/&gt;

'''Institut Mines-Télécom''' is a French public academic institution dedicated to Higher Education and Research for Innovation in the fields of engineering and digital technology, organized as a [[Collegiate University]]. Created in 1996, it was originally known as the "Groupe des écoles des télécommunications", or GET, followed by the "Institut Télécom". The Mines schools, which were placed under the administrative supervision of the Ministry of Industry, joined the Institut in March 2012 when it took on its current name and gained the status of [[Grand établissement]]. it combines high academic and scientific legitimacy with a practical proximity to business and a unique positioning in 3 major transformations of the 21st century: Digital Affairs, Energy and Ecology, and Industry. Its training and research for innovation are rolled out in the Mines and Télécom Graduate Schools. The Institut falls under the administrative aegis of the [[General Council for the Economy, Industry, Energy and Technologies]].

Institut Mines-Télécom is a founding member of the Industry of the Future Alliance and the [[University of Paris-Saclay]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/university/members Members and associates]&lt;/ref&gt; It maintains close relationships with the economic world and has two Carnot Institutes.

Every year around one hundred startup companies leave its incubators.

==History==

In 1996, the [[France Télécom]] monopoly in telecommunications ended. The group of telecommunications schools was established in the form of an [[Établissement public à caractère administratif]] (public establishment of an administrative nature), for the purpose of managing the three schools: the École nationale supérieure des télécommunications; the École nationale supérieure des télécommunications de Bretagne and the Institut national des télécommunications. The group was renamed the "Institut Télécom" in 2008.
On 1 March 2012, it was renamed the "Institut Mines-Télécom" and converted to an [[EPCSCP - Grand Établissement]]. The six Mines schools under the supervision of the [[Ministry for the Economy, Finances and Industry]] joined the Institut by convention.

==Schools==

Institut Mines-Télécom is composed of eight schools ([[Grandes Écoles]]):

* [[IMT Atlantique]] in [[Brest, France|Brest]], [[Rennes]], [[Nantes]], and [[Toulouse]] (ex École nationale supérieure des télécommunications de Bretagne, or ENST Bretagne merged with ex Ecole des Mines de Nantes in 2017),

{{nihongo|'''''Kaikō'''''|海溝||"Ocean Trench"}} was a [[remotely operated underwater vehicle]] (ROV) built by the [[Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology]] (JAMSTEC) for exploration of the [[deep sea]]. ''Kaikō'' was the second of only four vessels ever to reach the bottom of the [[Challenger Deep]], as of 2010. Between 1995 and 2003, this 10.6 ton unmanned [[submersible]] conducted more than 250 dives, collecting 350 biological species (including 180 different bacteria), some of which could prove to be useful in medical and industrial applications.&lt;ref name=Kakuchi&gt;{{cite web

Another ROV, ''Kaikō7000II'', served as the replacement for ''Kaikō'' until 2007. At that time, JAMSTEC researchers began [[sea trial]]s for the permanent replacement ROV, ''[[ABISMO]]'' ('''A'''utomatic '''B'''ottom '''I'''nspection and '''S'''ampling '''Mo'''bile). ''ABISMO'' is currently one of only three ROVs rated to 11,000-meters (the other two being ''[[Nereus (underwater vehicle)|Nereus]]'', built and operated by the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]], and ''[[Deepsea Challenger]]'', piloted by director [[James Cameron]]).

Among the many discoveries of the ''Challenger'' expedition was the identification of the Challenger Deep. This depression, located at the southern end of the [[Mariana Trench]] near the [[Mariana Islands]] group, is the deepest [[surveying|surveyed]] point of the [[World Ocean]]. The ''Challenger'' scientists made the first recordings of its depth on 23 March 1875 at [https://web.archive.org/web/20110310200116/http://www.19thcenturyscience.org/HMSC/HMSC-Reports/1895-Summary/htm/doc878.html station 225]. The reported depth was 4,475 [[fathom]]s (8184 meters) based on two separate soundings.

On 23 January 1960, [[Don Walsh]] and [[Jacques Piccard]] were the first men to descend to the bottom of the Challenger Deep in the [[Trieste (bathyscaphe)|''Trieste'']] [[bathyscaphe]]. Though the initial report claimed the bathyscaphe had attained a depth of 37,800 feet,&lt;ref name=usn1960&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the maximum recorded depth was later calculated to be {{convert|10911|m}}. At this depth, the [[water column]] above exerts a [[barometric pressure]] of {{convert|108.6|MPa|psi}}, over one thousand times the [[atmospheric pressure#Standard atmospheric pressure|standard atmospheric pressure]] at sea level. Even at this great depth and pressure, a small [[flounder]]-like fish was seen moving away from the spotlight of the bathyscaphe.

RV ''Kairei'' ([[:ja:かいれい|かいれい]]) is a deep sea research vessel that served as the support ship for ''Kaikō'', and for its replacement ROV, ''Kaikō7000II''. It now serves as the support ship for ''[[ABISMO]]''. ''Kairei'' uses ''ABISMO'' to conduct surveys and observations of [[oceanic plateau]]s, [[abyssal plain]]s, [[oceanic basin]]s, [[submarine volcano]]es, [[hydrothermal vent]]s, [[oceanic trench]]es and other underwater terrain features to a maximum depth of 11,000 meters. ''Kairei'' also conducts surveys of the structure of deep sub-bottoms with complicated geographical shapes in subduction zones using its on-board multi-channel reflection survey system.&lt;ref name=Kairei&gt;{{cite web

''Kaikō'' reached a maximum depth of 10,911.4 meters at the Challenger Deep on 24 March 1995, during its initial sea trials.&lt;ref name=Kyo1995/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;&lt;ref name=JAMSTEC01/&gt; At that time, the craft collected video and photographs of various [[extremophile|barophilic]] [[benthos]], including [[Tube worm (body plan)|tubeworms]] and [[shrimp]].

In February 1996, ''Kaikō'' returned to Challenger Deep, this time collecting [[sediment]] and [[microorganism]]s from the [[seabed]] at a depth of 10,898 meters. Among the novel organisms identified and collected was ''[[Moritella yayanosii]]''&lt;ref name=Nogi1999&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two species of bacteria appear to be obligately barophilic. The optimal pressure conditions for growth of ''S. benthica'' is 70 [[Pascal (unit)|Megapascals (MPa)]], while ''M. yayanosii'' grows best at 80 MPa; no growth at all was detected at pressures of less than 50 MPa with either strain.&lt;ref name=Kato1998/&gt; Both species appear to contain high levels of [[docosahexaenoic acid]] (DHA) and [[eicosapentaenoic acid]] (EPA), [[omega-3 fatty acid]]s which could prove to be useful in the treatment of [[hypertension]] and even [[cancer]].&lt;ref name=Kakuchi/&gt;

In December 1997, ''Kaikō'' located the wreck of ''[[Tsushima Maru]]'' on the sea floor off the coast of [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]]. ''Tsushima Maru'' was an unmarked [[Japan]]ese passenger/cargo ship that was sunk during [[World War II]] by [[USS Bowfin (SS-287)|USS ''Bowfin'']], a [[United States Navy]] [[submarine]].

In May 1998, ''Kaikō'' returned again to Challenger Deep, this time collecting specimens of ''[[Gammaridea|Hirondellea gigas]]''. ''Hirondellea gigas'' (Birstein and Vinagradov, 1955) is a [[crustacean]] of the [[Uristidae]] [[family (biology)|family]] of [[marine (ocean)|marine]] [[Amphipoda|amphipods]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ITIS |id=94312 |taxon=Hirondellea |accessdate=24 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1999, ''Kaikō'' performed a robotic mechanical operation at a depth of 2,150 meters off the coast of Okinawa near the [[Ryukyu Trench]], connecting measuring equipment with underwater cables on the sea floor. On this mission, another bacterial species, ''[[Shewanella violacea]]'', was discovered at a depth of 5,110 meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Certain compounds found in ''S. violacea'' may have applications in the [[cosmetics]] industry (development of products for lightening of skin tone) and also in the [[semiconductor]] industry (development of chemicals to be used in production of semiconductors).&lt;ref name=Kakuchi/&gt;

In late November 1999, ''Kaikō'' located the wreckage of [[H-II|H-2]] No. 8, a [[National Space Development Agency of Japan|NASDA]] rocket ([[launch vehicle|satellite launch system]]), on the sea floor at a depth of 2,900 meters off the [[Bonin Islands|Ogasawara Islands]]. H-2 flight F8 was conducted on 15 November 1999. The rocket, which was carrying a [[Multi-Functional Transport Satellite]] (MTSAT) payload, self-destructed after experiencing an engine malfunction shortly after it was launched.

In August 2000, ''Kaikō'' discovered hydrothermal vents and their associated [[deep sea communities]] at a depth of 2,450 meters near the [[Central Indian Ridge]]. The Central Indian Ridge is a [[divergent boundary|divergent]] [[Plate tectonics|tectonic plate]] [[Plate boundaries#Types of plate boundaries|boundary]] between the [[African Plate]] and the [[Indo-Australian Plate]] located in the western [[Indian Ocean]].

On 29 May 2003, ''Kaikō'' was lost at sea during [[2003 Pacific typhoon season#Typhoon Chan-hom|Typhoon Chan-Hom]], when a steel secondary cable connecting it to its launcher at the surface broke off the coast of [[Shikoku|Shikoku Island]].&lt;ref name=Ishibashi2008/&gt;

In May 2004, JAMSTEC resumed its research operations, using a converted ROV as its vehicle. The ROV, formerly known as ''UROV 7K'', was rechristened ''Kaikō7000II''. The ''7000'' designation indicates that this vessel is rated for diving to a maximum depth of 7,000 meters.

==Development of ABISMO==
{{Main|ABISMO}}
While the temporary replacement ROV (''Kaikō7000II'') has a remarkable performance record, it is only rated to 7,000 meters and cannot reach the deepest oceanic trenches. For this reason, JAMSTEC engineers began work on a new 11,000-meter class of ROV in April 2005.&lt;ref name=Ishibashi2008&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29241">'''Latin manuscripts of the New Testament''' are handwritten copies of translations from the Greek originals. Translations of the New Testament are called ''versions''. They are important in [[textual criticism]], because sometimes versions provide evidence (called a ''witness'') to an earlier reading of the Greek, i.e. to the text that may have been lost (or preserved only very poorly) in the subsequent Greek tradition. It is also hypothesised that, in some cases, for example, in the case of the [[Codex Bezae]], early Latin manuscripts may have influenced some early Greek manuscripts. Thus, accidentally or deliberately, some Latin readings may have "crossed back over" into the Greek. One possible example of this is the well known [[Comma Johanneum]].

Latin manuscripts are divided into "Old Latin" and [[Vulgate]]. Old Latin manuscripts, also called ''[[Vetus Latina]]'' or ''Itala'', are so called not because they are written in [[Old Latin]] (i.e. Latin prior to 75 BC), but because they are the oldest versions of the New Testament in Latin. From the linguistic point of view, Old Latin New Testament manuscripts may at times use non-standard grammar and vocabulary.

Unlike the Vulgate, the Vetus Latina tradition reflects numerous distinct, similar, and not entirely independent translations of various New Testament texts, extending back to the time of the original Greek autographs.&lt;ref&gt;"There is no such thing as a uniform version of the New Testament in Latin prior to Jerome's Vulgate". Elliott (1997:202).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 382 AD [[Jerome]] began a revision of the existing Vetus Latina into contemporary Latin, corrected against manuscripts in the original Greek and Hebrew. [[List of New Testament Latin manuscripts#Jerome's version|Jerome's version]] is known as the [[Vulgate]].&lt;ref&gt;Metzger, UBS4.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clarification ==
=== Identification ===

The list of Old Latin manuscripts below is based on citations in ''[[Novum Testamentum Graece]]'' (NA27) and ''The Greek New Testament'' ([[United Bible Societies|UBS]]4). Each manuscript is identified first by its [[Scribal abbreviation|siglum]] (the first column, '''s.''', in the table), as given by the [[critical apparatus]] of the editions mentioned. These sigla are related to content, so are not unique. For example, the letter ''t'' refers to Codex Bernensis in the [[gospel]]s, but [[Liber Comicus]] elsewhere. So sigla need disambiguation. In the table below, this is done by providing a full name. Additionally, the standard unique serial number for each manuscript is provided. Taken together sigla, name and number provide unambiguous identification, and some further information regarding the content, history and relationship of manuscripts.

Sigla, names and numbers exist to serve different scholastic purposes. Sigla, in the context of reference to an ''original'' document, provide unique and concise identification of witnesses to the text of that original, suited to minimizing the space taken by citation in a critical apparatus. Names, on the other hand, normally refer to specific handwritten ''volumes'' (often including other text), either as originally bound or in their current form. Names are typically Latin, and can refer to the place of composition ([[Abbey library of Saint Gall|Codex Sangallensis]], "Book from [[Abbey of St. Gall|St. Gall]]") or rediscovery ([[Stonyhurst Gospel]]), the current location (Liber Ardmachanus, "[[Book of Armagh]]"), a famous owner (Codex Bezae, "[[Theodore Beza]]'s Book"), a volume's function (Liber Comicus, "The Lectionary"), or can even refer to physical characteristics of a volume ([[Codex Gigas]], "The Huge Book" or [[Codex Aureus (disambiguation)|Codex Aureus]], "The Gold Book"). The [[Book of Mulling]] is also known as Liber Moliensis after the name of the scribe, as tradition has it.

==== Beuron numbers ====

The [[Beuron Archabbey|Beuron]] Ancient Latin Institute (''Vetus Latina Institut'') has introduced a new numerical system for Old Latin manuscripts, of which there are about 90 altogether. These ''Beuron numbers'' are designed to provide unambiguous identification of witnesses in academic usage, yet they are not used very widely in general literature, as they may cause confusion with the Greek minuscule manuscripts.

Beuron Institute allocated numbers up to 100 to all existing Old Latin manuscripts, depending on what parts of NT they include, and how old their text is. The lowest numbers are allocated to the gospels, and to the most complete manuscripts. For example, Codex Bezae (d) is a witness for the Gospels (Gosp), the [[Book of Acts]] and the [[General epistles]] (Gen), and is allocated number 5.
* Manuscripts 1-49 are witnesses to one or more Gospels.
* Manuscripts 50-74 are witnesses to Acts, General epistles or the [[Book of Revelation]] (Rev).
* Manuscripts 75-89 are witnesses to [[Pauline epistles]] (Paul).
* Manuscripts 91-96 are [[Bible gloss|gloss]]es in Spanish Bibles.

=== Other issues ===

NA27 and UBS4 interact with the Vulgate witness only at the level of critical editions, not at the level of manuscripts themselves. The manuscripts that provide evidence of Jerome's version are identified in the apparatus of ''Biblia Sacra Vulgata'' (the [[Vulgate#Weber-Gryson (Stuttgart) edition|Stuttgart edition of the Vulgate]]).

In practice, citation of manuscript evidence implies any of several methodologies. The ideal, but most costly, method is physical inspection of the manuscript itself; alternatively, published photographs or [[facsimile]] editions may be inspected. This method involves [[Paleography|paleographical]] analysis—interpretation of handwriting, incomplete letters and even reconstruction of [[lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunae]]. More typically, editions of manuscripts are consulted, which have done this paleographical work already. The lists below note the names of the editors of standard editions of the manuscripts listed. As a last resort, sometimes a critical edition of NT, that cites readings of a manuscript in its apparatus, may be offered as authority for the text of the manuscript at these points.

It must also be observed that certain Latin NT manuscripts may present a mixture of Vulgate and Old Latin texts. For example, [[Codex Sangermanensis]] (g&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; ) is Old Latin in Matthew, but Vulgate in the rest of the Gospels. Also, the text of John in Codex Veronensis is believed to be part Old Latin and part Vulgate. Hence, some codices are cited as manuscript witnesses ''both'' to the Vetus Latina and to the Vulgate.

== Old Latin ==

The table below employs the following conventions.
* Dates are estimated to the nearest 50 year increment.
* Content is given to the nearest book (sometimes chapter); verses and lacunae are not listed.
* Editions are those consulted by UBS4; in many cases, better editions are also available.
* Locations are given in [[anglicisation|anglicised]] form, unless linked to sources in other languages.
* Manuscripts will sometimes be referred to as "it" followed by the siglum.

For example, a manual override in [[photography]] refers to the ability for the human photographer to turn off the automatic [[aperture]] sizing, [[automatic focus]]ing, or any other automated system on the camera.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ambitions4.com/Glossary-Pub-View-Topic-Details.asp?GlossaryID=339&amp;strChar=M Manual override] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20060513202632/http://www.ambitions4.com/Glossary-Pub-View-Topic-Details.asp?GlossaryID=339&amp;strChar=M |date=2006-05-13 }}, Ambitions Photography Academy.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some manual overrides can be used to veto an automated system's judgment when the system is in error. An example of this is a [[Printer (computing)|printer's]] ink level detection: in one case, a researcher found that when he overrode the system, up to 38% more pages could be printed at good quality by the printer than the automated system would have allowed.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3035500.stm 'Raw deal' on printer ink], ''[[BBC]]'', 3 July 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Automated systems are becoming increasingly common and integrated into everyday objects such as [[automobile]]s and [[domestic appliance]]s.  This development of [[ubiquitous computing]] raises general issues of policy and law about the need for manual overrides for matters of great importance such as life-threatening situations and major economic decisions.  The loyalty of such autonomous devices then becomes an issue.  If they follow rules installed by the manufacturer or required by law and refuse to cede control in some situations then the owners of the devices may feel disempowered, alienated and lacking true ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.jjbohn.com/papers/langhein_aswemaylive_2002.pdf |title=As we may live – Real-world implications of ubiquitous computing |author1=Marc Langheinrich |author2=Vlad Coroama |author3=Jurgen Bohn |author4=Michael Rohs  |last-author-amp=yes |publisher=Institute of Information Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major incidents==
[[China Airlines Flight 140]] crashed, causing many deaths, due to a misunderstanding about the manual overrides for the [[autopilot]].  The Take-Off/Go Around system had been activated to abort a landing.  It was programmed to ignore manual controls in this situation but the human pilots tried to continue the landing.  The conflicting control signals from the pilots and autopilot then resulted in the aircraft stalling and crashing.  The autopilot for this aircraft type was then reprogrammed so that it would never ignore a manual override.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SG07muS_S2EC |page=151 |year=2004 |title=Taming HAL: designing interfaces beyond 2001 |isbn=978-0-312-29574-5 |author=Asaf Degani}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13209">In [[electrical engineering]], the '''maximum power transfer theorem''' states that, to obtain ''maximum'' external power from a source with a finite [[internal resistance]], the resistance of the load must equal the resistance of the source as viewed from its output terminals. [[Moritz von Jacobi]] published the maximum power (transfer) theorem around 1840; it is also referred to as "'''Jacobi's law'''".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dKVbT-ZmdDwC&amp;pg=PA406 |title=Dynamo-Electric Machinery; A Manual for Students of Electrotechnics |author=Thompson Phillips |publisher=BiblioBazaar, LLC |isbn=978-1-110-35104-6 |date=2009-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[theorem]] results in maximum ''[[Electric power|power]]'' transfer across the circuit, and not maximum ''[[efficiency]]''. If the [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] of the load is made larger than the resistance of the source, then efficiency is higher, since a higher percentage of the source power is transferred to the load, but the ''magnitude'' of the load power is lower since the total circuit resistance goes up.

If the load resistance is smaller than the source resistance, then most of the power ends up being dissipated in the source, and although the total power dissipated is higher, due to a lower total resistance, it turns out that the amount dissipated in the load is reduced.

The theorem states how to choose (so as to maximize power transfer) the load resistance, once the source resistance is given. It is a common misconception to apply the theorem in the opposite scenario.  It does ''not'' say how to choose the source resistance for a given load resistance. In fact, the source resistance that maximizes power transfer is always zero, regardless of the value of the load resistance.

The theorem can be extended to [[alternating current]] circuits that include [[Electrical reactance|reactance]], and states that maximum power transfer occurs when the load [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] is equal to the [[complex conjugate]] of the source impedance.

== Maximizing power transfer versus power efficiency ==
The theorem was originally misunderstood (notably by [[James Prescott Joule|Joule]]) to imply that a system consisting of an electric motor driven by a battery could not be more than 50% efficient since, when the impedances were matched, the power lost as heat in the battery would always be equal to the power delivered to the motor. 

In 1880 this assumption was shown to be false by either [[Thomas Edison|Edison]] or his colleague [[Francis Robbins Upton]], who realized that maximum efficiency was not the same as maximum power transfer.  

To achieve maximum efficiency, the resistance of the source (whether a battery or a [[dynamo]]) could be (or should be) made as close to zero as possible. Using this new understanding, they obtained an efficiency of about 90%, and proved that the [[electric motor]] was a practical alternative to the [[heat engine]].

[[File:Source and load circuit.svg|250px]] [[File:Maximum Power Transfer Graph.svg]]

The condition of maximum power transfer does not result in maximum [[Electrical efficiency|efficiency]]. 

If we define the efficiency {{math|''η''}} as the ratio of power dissipated by the load, ''R{{sub|L}}'', to power developed by the source, ''V{{sub|S}}'', then it is straightforward to calculate from the above circuit diagram that

:&lt;math&gt;\eta = \frac{R_\mathrm{L}}{R_\mathrm{L} + R_\mathrm{S}} = \frac{1}{1 + R_\mathrm{S} / R_\mathrm{L}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Consider three particular cases:

* If &lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{L} = R_\mathrm{S}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\eta = 0.5,&lt;/math&gt;
* If &lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{L} \to \infty&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{S} = 0,&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\eta = 1,&lt;/math&gt;
* If &lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{L} = 0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\eta = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The efficiency is only 50% when maximum power transfer is achieved, but approaches 100% as the load resistance approaches infinity, though the total power level tends towards zero. 

Efficiency also approaches 100% if the source resistance approaches zero, and 0% if the load resistance approaches zero. In the latter case, all the power is consumed inside the source (unless the source also has no resistance), so the power dissipated in a [[short circuit]] is zero.

==Impedance matching==
{{main|impedance matching}}
A related concept is reflectionless [[impedance matching]].  

In [[radio]] frequency [[transmission line]]s, and other [[electronics]], there is often a requirement to match the [[source impedance]] (at the transmitter) to the [[load impedance]] (such as an [[antenna (electronics)|antenna]]) to avoid reflections in the [[transmission line]] that could overload or damage the transmitter.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  for a non-calculus-based proof)
 
[[File:maxpowertheorem.png|left|Circuit diagram]]

In the diagram opposite, power is being transferred from the source, with voltage {{math|''V''}} and fixed [[source resistance]] {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;}}, to a load with resistance {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;}}, resulting in a current {{math|''I''}}.  By [[Ohm's law]], {{math|''I''}} is simply the source voltage divided by the total circuit resistance:

:&lt;math&gt;I = \frac{V}{R_\mathrm{S} + R_\mathrm{L}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The power {{math|''P''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;}} dissipated in the load is the square of the current multiplied by the resistance:

:&lt;math&gt;P_\mathrm{L} = I^2 R_\mathrm{L} = \left(\frac{V}{R_\mathrm{S} + R_\mathrm{L}}\right)^2 R_\mathrm{L} = \frac{V^2}{R_\mathrm{S}^2 / R_\mathrm{L} + 2 R_\mathrm{S} + R_\mathrm{L}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The value of {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;}} for which this expression is a maximum could be calculated by differentiating it, but it is easier to calculate the value of {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;}} for which the denominator

:&lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{S}^2 / R_\mathrm{L} + 2 R_\mathrm{S} + R_\mathrm{L}&lt;/math&gt;

is a minimum.  The result will be the same in either case.  Differentiating the denominator with respect to {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;}}:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d}{d R_\mathrm{L}} \left(R_\mathrm{S}^2 / R_\mathrm{L} + 2R_\mathrm{S} + R_\mathrm{L}\right) = -R_\mathrm{S}^2 / R_\mathrm{L}^2 + 1.&lt;/math&gt;

For a maximum or minimum, the first derivative is zero, so

:&lt;math&gt;
R_\mathrm{S}^2 / R_\mathrm{L}^2 = 1&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{L} = \pm R_\mathrm{S}.&lt;/math&gt;

In practical resistive circuits, {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;}} are both positive, so the positive sign in the above is the correct solution. 

To find out whether this solution is a minimum or a maximum, the denominator expression is differentiated again:

:&lt;math&gt;{{d^2} \over {dR_\mathrm{L}^2}} \left( {R_\mathrm{S}^2 / R_\mathrm{L} + 2 R_\mathrm{S} + R_\mathrm{L}} \right) = {2 R_\mathrm{S}^2} / {R_\mathrm{L}^3}. \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

This is always positive for positive values of &lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{S} \,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{L} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;, showing that the denominator is a minimum, and the power is therefore a maximum, when

:&lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{S} = R_\mathrm{L}. \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:
The above proof assumes fixed source resistance &lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{S} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  When the source resistance can be varied, power transferred to the load can be increased by reducing &lt;math&gt;R_\textrm{S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  For example, a 100 Volt source with an &lt;math&gt;R_\textrm{S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;10~\Omega&lt;/math&gt; will deliver 250 watts of power to a &lt;math&gt;10~\Omega&lt;/math&gt; load; reducing &lt;math&gt;R_\textrm{S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;0~\Omega&lt;/math&gt; increases the power delivered to 1000 watts.

Note that this shows that maximum power transfer can also be interpreted as the load voltage being equal to one-half of the Thevenin voltage equivalent of the source.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.electronics-tutorial.net/dccircuits/maximum-power-transfer-theorem/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==In reactive circuits==
The power transfer theorem also applies when the source and/or load are not purely resistive. 

A refinement of the maximum power theorem says that any reactive components of source and load should be of equal magnitude but opposite sign.  (''See below for a derivation.'')  
* This means that the source and load impedances should be ''[[complex conjugate]]s'' of each other.  
* In the case of purely resistive circuits, the two concepts are identical.  

Physically realizable sources and loads are not usually purely resistive, having some inductive or capacitive components, and so practical applications of this theorem, under the name of complex conjugate impedance matching, do, in fact, exist.

If the source is totally inductive (capacitive), then a totally capacitive (inductive) load, in the absence of resistive losses, would receive 100% of the energy from the source but send it back after a quarter cycle.

The resultant circuit is nothing other than a resonant [[LC circuit]] in which the energy continues to oscillate to and fro.  This oscillation is called [[reactive power]]. 

[[Power factor correction]] (where an inductive reactance is used to "balance out" a capacitive one), is essentially the same  idea as complex conjugate impedance matching although it is done for entirely different reasons.

For a fixed reactive ''source'', the maximum power theorem maximizes the real power (P) delivered to the load by complex conjugate matching the load to the source.

For a fixed reactive ''load'', power factor correction minimizes the [[apparent power]] (S) (and unnecessary current) conducted by the transmission lines, while maintaining the same amount of real power transfer. 

This is done by adding a reactance to the load to balance out the load's own reactance, changing the reactive load impedance into a resistive load impedance.

=== Proof ===

[[File:Source and load boxes.png|left|source and load impedance diagram]]

In this diagram, [[AC power]] is being transferred from the source, with [[phasor (electronics)|phasor]] magnitude voltage &lt;math&gt;|V_\mathrm{S}|&lt;/math&gt; (peak voltage) and fixed [[source impedance]] &lt;math&gt;Z_\mathrm{S}&lt;/math&gt;, to a load with impedance &lt;math&gt;Z_\mathrm{L}&lt;/math&gt;, resulting in a phasor magnitude current &lt;math&gt;|I|&lt;/math&gt;.  &lt;math&gt;|I|&lt;/math&gt; is simply the source voltage divided by the total circuit impedance:

:&lt;math&gt;
|I| = { |V_\mathrm{S}| \over |Z_\mathrm{S} + Z_\mathrm{L}| }.
&lt;/math&gt;

The average power &lt;math&gt;P_\mathrm{L}&lt;/math&gt; dissipated in the load is the square of the current multiplied by the resistive portion (the real part) &lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{L}&lt;/math&gt; of the load impedance:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
P_\mathrm{L} &amp; = I_\mathrm{rms}^2 R_\mathrm{L} = {1 \over 2} |I|^2 R_\mathrm{L} = {1 \over 2} \left( {|V_\mathrm{S}| \over |Z_\mathrm{S} + Z_\mathrm{L}|} \right)^2 R_\mathrm{L} \\
&amp; = {1 \over 2}{ |V_\mathrm{S}|^2 R_\mathrm{L} \over (R_\mathrm{S} + R_\mathrm{L})^2 + (X_\mathrm{S} + X_\mathrm{L})^2},
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the resistance &lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{S}&lt;/math&gt; and reactance &lt;math&gt;X_\mathrm{S}&lt;/math&gt; are the real and imaginary parts of &lt;math&gt;Z_\mathrm{S}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;X_\mathrm{L}&lt;/math&gt; is the imaginary part of &lt;math&gt;Z_\mathrm{L}&lt;/math&gt;.

To determine the values of &lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{L}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X_\mathrm{L}&lt;/math&gt; (since &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{S}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{S}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;X_\mathrm{S}&lt;/math&gt; are fixed) for which this expression is a maximum, we first find, for each fixed positive value of &lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{L}&lt;/math&gt;, the value of the reactive term &lt;math&gt;X_\mathrm{L}&lt;/math&gt; for which the denominator

:&lt;math&gt;
(R_\mathrm{S} + R_\mathrm{L})^2 + (X_\mathrm{S} + X_\mathrm{L})^2 \,
&lt;/math&gt;

is a minimum. Since reactances can be negative, this denominator is easily minimized by making

:&lt;math&gt;
X_\mathrm{L} = -X_\mathrm{S}.\,
&lt;/math&gt;

The power equation is now reduced to:

:&lt;math&gt;
P_\mathrm{L} = {1 \over 2}{{|V_\mathrm{S}|^2 R_\mathrm{L}}\over{(R_\mathrm{S} + R_\mathrm{L})^2}}\,\!
&lt;/math&gt;

and it remains to find the value of &lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{L}&lt;/math&gt; which maximizes this expression. However, this maximization problem has exactly the same form as in the purely resistive case, and the maximizing condition &lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{L} = R_\mathrm{S}&lt;/math&gt; can be found in the same way.

The combination of conditions

*&lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{L} =  R_\mathrm{S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;X_\mathrm{L} = -X_\mathrm{S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

can be concisely written with a [[complex conjugate]] (the *) as:

:&lt;math&gt;Z_\mathrm{L} = Z_\mathrm{S}^*.&lt;/math&gt;

==Alfred A. Tomatis==
The concept of the "Mozart effect" was described by French researcher [[Alfred A. Tomatis|Dr. Alfred A. Tomatis]] in his 1991 book ''Pourquoi Mozart?'' (''Why Mozart?'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~biglars/Mozart.html|title=Mozart on the Brain|first=Lars|last=Sorensen|date=19 November 2008|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used the music of Mozart in his efforts to "retrain" the ear, and believed that listening to the music presented at differing frequencies helped the ear, and promoted healing and the development of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thompson|first1=Billie M.|last2=Andrews|first2=Susan R.|title=An historical commentary on the physiological effects of music: Tomatis, Mozart and neuropsychology|journal=Integrative Physiological and Behavioral Science|volume=35|issue=3|pages=174–188|doi=10.1007/BF02688778|pmid=11286370|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rauscher ''et al.'' 1993 study==
Frances Rauscher, Gordon Shaw, and Catherine Ky (1993) investigated the effect of listening to music by Mozart on [[spatial-temporal reasoning|spatial reasoning]], and the results were published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''. They gave research participants one of three standard tests of abstract spatial reasoning after they had experienced each of three listening conditions: the [[Sonata for Two Pianos in D major (Mozart)|Sonata for Two Pianos in D major, K. 448]]  by Mozart, verbal relaxation instructions, and silence. They found a temporary enhancement of spatial-reasoning, as measured by spatial-reasoning sub tasks of the Stanford-Binet IQ test. Rauscher et al. show that the enhancing effect of the music condition is only temporary: no student had effects extending beyond the 15-minute period in which they were tested. The study makes no statement of an increase in IQ in general (because IQ was never measured).&lt;ref name="Rauscher-Shaw-Ky-1993"/&gt;

==Popularization==
While Rauscher et al. only showed an increase in "spatial intelligence", the results were popularly interpreted as an increase in general IQ. This misconception, and the fact that the music used in the study was by Mozart, had an obvious appeal to those who valued this music; the Mozart effect was thus widely reported. In 1994, ''[[New York Times]]'' music columnist [[Alex Ross (music critic)|Alex Ross]] wrote in a light-hearted article, "researchers [Rauscher and Shaw] have determined that listening to Mozart actually makes you smarter", and presented this as the final piece of evidence that Mozart has dethroned [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] as "the world's greatest composer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ross|first=Alex|title=CLASSICAL VIEW; Listening To Prozac . . . Er, Mozart|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/28/arts/classical-view-listening-to-prozac-er-mozart.html|publisher=New York Times|date=August 28, 1994|accessdate=2012-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; " A 1997 ''[[Boston Globe]]'' article mentioned some of the Rauscher and Shaw results. It described one study in which three- and four-year-olds who were given eight months of private piano lessons scored 30% higher on tests of spatio-temporal reasoning than control groups given computer lessons, singing lessons, and no training. 

The 1997 book by Don Campbell, ''The Mozart Effect: Tapping the Power of Music to Heal the Body, Strengthen the Mind, and Unlock the Creative Spirit'', discusses the theory that listening to [[Mozart]] (especially the piano concertos) may temporarily increase one's [[IQ]] and produce many other beneficial effects on mental function. Campbell recommends playing specially selected classical music to infants, in the expectation that it will benefit their [[neural development|mental development]].

After ''The Mozart Effect'', Campbell wrote a follow-up book, ''The Mozart Effect For Children'', and created related products. Among these are collections of music that he states harness the Mozart effect to enhance "deep rest and rejuvenation", "intelligence and learning", and "creativity and imagination". Campbell defines the term as "an inclusive term signifying the transformational powers of music in health, education, and well-being. It represents the general use of music to reduce stress, depression, or anxiety; induce relaxation or sleep; activate the body; and improve [[memory]] or [[awareness]]. Innovative and experimental uses of music and sound can improve listening disorders, [[dyslexia]], [[ADHD predominantly inattentive|attention deficit disorder]], [[autism]], and other mental and physical disorders and diseases".&lt;ref name="campbell"&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Don |title=The Mozart Effect: Tapping the Power of Music to Heal the Body, Strengthen the Mind, and Unlock the Creative Spirit |year=1997 |isbn=0-380-97418-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These theories are controversial. The relationship of sound and music (both played and listened to) for cognitive function and various physiological metrics has been explored in studies with no definitive results.

==Political impact==
The political impact of the theory was demonstrated on January 13, 1998, when [[Zell Miller]], governor of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], announced that his proposed state budget would include $105,000 a year to provide every child born in Georgia with a tape or CD of classical music. Miller stated "No one questions that listening to music at a very early age affects the spatial-temporal reasoning that underlies math and engineering and even chess." Miller played legislators some of Beethoven's "[[Ode to Joy]]" on a tape recorder and asked "Now, don't you feel smarter already?" Miller asked [[Yoel Levi]], music director of the [[Atlanta Symphony Orchestra|Atlanta Symphony]], to compile a collection of classical pieces that should be included. State representative [[Buddy DeLoach|Homer DeLoach]] said "I asked about the possibility of including some [[Charlie Daniels]] or something like that, but they said they thought the classical music has a greater positive impact. Having never studied those impacts too much, I guess I'll just have to take their word for that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Kevin |last=Sack |title=Georgia's Governor Seeks Musical Start for Babies |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |page=A12 |date=1998-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subsequent research and meta-analyses ==
While some supportive reports have been published,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wilson, T., Brown, T. |title=Reexamination of the effect of Mozart's music on spatial task performance|journal=The Journal of Psychology|volume=131|issue=4|pages=365|doi=10.1080/00223989709603522|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; studies with positive results have tended to be associated with any form of music that has energetic and positive emotional qualities.&lt;ref name="thompson"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Thompson, W.F., Schellenberg, E.G. &amp; Husain, G. |title=Arousal, mood, and the Mozart effect|journal=Psychological Science|volume=12|issue=3|pages=248–51|pmid=11437309|year=2001|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00345}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Husain"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Husain, G., Thompson, W.F. &amp; Schellenberg, E.G. |title=Effects of musical tempo and mode on arousal, mood, and spatial abilities: Re-examination of the "Mozart effect"|journal=Music Perception|volume=20|issue=2|pages=151|doi=10.1525/mp.2002.20.2.151|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the intellectual benefits of enhanced mood and arousal are not restricted to spatial-temporal reasoning, but extend to speed of processing and creative problem solving.&lt;ref name="Ilie"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ilie, G., &amp; Thompson, W.F. |year=2011|title= Experiential and cognitive changes following seven minutes exposure to music and speech|journal= Music Perception|volume= 28|issue=3|pages= 247–264|doi=10.1525/mp.2011.28.3.247}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among children, some studies suggest no effect on IQ or spatial ability,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2002|doi=10.1348/026151002166433|title=Listening to Mozart does not improve children's spatial ability: Final curtains for the Mozart effect|journal=British Journal of Developmental Psychology|volume=20|issue=2|pages=241|last1 = McKelvie|first1 = Pippa|last2=Low|first2=Jason}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas others suggest that the effect can be elicited with energetic popular music that the children enjoy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Schellenberg, E.G., &amp; Hallam, S. |title=Music listening and cognitive abilities in 10 and 11 year olds: The Blur effect|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|volume=1060|pages=202–9|pmid=16597767|year=2005|doi=10.1196/annals.1360.013|url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1507375/1/SchellenbergHallam2006Music202.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The weight of subsequent evidence supports either a null effect, or short-term effects related to increases in mood and arousal, with mixed results published after the initial report in ''Nature''.&lt;ref name="bridgett"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Effects of listening to Mozart and Bach on the performance of a mathematical test|pmid=10939064|last=Bridgett |first=D.J.|author2=Cuevas, J.|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills|volume=90|issue=3 Pt 2|year=2000 |pages=1171–1175|doi=10.2466/pms.2000.90.3c.1171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999  a major challenge was raised to the existence of the Mozart effect by two teams of researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Chabris | first1 = Christopher F.| title = Prelude or requiem for the 'Mozart effect'? | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]]| volume = 400 | issue = 6747 | pages = 826–827| year = 1999 | doi = 10.1038/23608 | pmid =  10476958| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Steele | first1 = K.

Chabris reported a  [[meta-analysis]] demonstrating that "any cognitive enhancement is small and does not reflect any change in IQ or reasoning ability in general, but instead derives entirely from performance on one specific type of cognitive task and has a simple neuropsychological explanation", called "enjoyment arousal". For example, he cites a study that found that "listening either to Mozart or to a passage from a [[Stephen King]] story enhanced subjects' performance in paper folding and cutting (one of the tests frequently employed by Rauscher and Shaw) but only for those who enjoyed what they heard". Steele et. al. found that "listening to Mozart produced a 3-point increase relative to silence in one experiment and a 4-point decrease in the other experiment".&lt;ref name="steele"&gt;{{cite web |last=Steele |first=M |title=Papers by Steele casting doubt on the Mozart effect |publisher=appstate.edu |url=http://www.acs.appstate.edu/~kms/research/Steele.htm |accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another study, the effect was replicated with the original Mozart music, but eliminated when the tempo was slowed down and major chords were replaced by minor chords.&lt;ref name="Husain"/&gt;

Another meta-analysis by Pietschnig, Voracek, and Formann (2010) combined results of 39 studies to answer the question as to whether or not the Mozart Effect exists. They concluded that there is little evidence to support the Mozart effect, as shown by small effect sizes. However, the most striking finding in this meta-analysis is the significantly larger effects published in studies affiliated with Rauscher or Rideout, with effect sizes more than three times higher for published studies affiliated with these founding members of the Mozart Effect. These systematic moderating effects due to lab affiliation call into question the existence of a Mozart Effect. In addition, this study also found strong evidence supporting a confounding [[publication bias]] when effect sizes of samples who listened to Mozart are compared to samples not exposed to a stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pietschnig|first1=Jakob|last2=Voracek|first2=Martin|last3=Formann|first3=Anton K.|title=Mozart effect–Shmozart effect: A meta-analysis|journal=Intelligence|volume=38|issue=3|year=2010|pages=314–323|doi=10.1016/j.intell.2010.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite implementing Rauscher, Shaw, and Ky's (1995)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rauscher|first1=Frances H.|last2=Shaw|first2=Gordon L.|last3=Ky|first3=Katherine N.|title=Listening to Mozart enhances spatial-temporal reasoning: towards a neurophysiological basis|journal=Neuroscience Letters|volume=185|issue=1|year=1995|pages=44–47|pmid=7731551|doi=10.1016/0304-3940(94)11221-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggestions of three key components that must be present to replicate the Mozart Effect, McCutcheon (2000) still failed to reproduce the Mozart Effect in a study with 36 adults. These conditions were: to ensure a task that taps into spatial components of mental imagery; a research design that does not include a pretest to avoid ceiling effects; a musical composition that is complex rather than repetitive and simple. Regardless of listening to classical music, jazz or silence, the study did not yield a significant effect on spatial reasoning performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCutcheon|first1=Lynn E.|title=Another failure to generalize the Mozart effect|journal=Psychological Reports|volume=87|issue=5|year=2000|pages=325–30|pmid=11026433|doi=10.2466/pr0.2000.87.1.325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mozart Effect is likely just an artifact of arousal and heightened mood.&lt;ref name="thompson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JonesWest2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Martin H.|last2=West|first2=Stephen D.|last3=Estell|first3=David B.|title=The Mozart effect: Arousal, preference, and spatial performance.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|volume=S|issue=1|year=2006|pages=26–32|doi=10.1037/1931-3896.S.1.26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Steele2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steele|first1=Kenneth M.|title=Arousal and mood factors in the "Mozart effect"|pmid=11011888|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills|volume=91|issue=1|year=2000|pages=188–190|url=http://www1.appstate.edu/~kms//documents/Arousal.pdf|format=PDF|doi=10.2466/pms.2000.91.1.188}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arousal is the confounding variable that mediates the relationship between spatial ability and music that defines the Mozart Effect.&lt;ref name="JonesWest2006"/&gt; The "neural resonance" theory of Rauscher and colleagues which contends that Mozart's music primes the neural pathways of spatial reasoning has been widely criticized.&lt;ref name="JonesWest2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Steele2000"/&gt;

Government bodies also became involved in analysing the wealth (some 300+ articles as of 2005) of reports. A German report concluded, for instance, that "... passively listening to Mozart — or indeed any other music you enjoy — does not make you smarter. But more studies should be done to find out whether music lessons could raise your child's IQ in the long term".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Alison |last=Abbott |title=Mozart doesn't make you clever |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2007/070413/full/news070409-13.html |publisher=Nature.com |accessdate= 2009-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ralph |last=Schumacher |title=Macht Mozart schlau? |url=http://www.bmbf.de/pub/macht_mozart_schlau.pdf |publisher=Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung |page=183 |accessdate=2009-05-22 |language=German |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726172239/http://www.bmbf.de/pub/macht_mozart_schlau.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular presentations of the "Mozart effect", including Alex Ross's comment that "listening to Mozart actually makes you smarter" and Zell Miller's "don't you feel smarter" query to the Georgia legislature, almost always tie it to "intelligence." Rauscher, one of the original researchers, has disclaimed this idea. In a 1999 reply to an article challenging the effect,&lt;ref name="steele"/&gt; published along with the article, she wrote (emphasis added):
{{quote|Our results on the effects of listening to ''Mozart's Sonata for Two Pianos in D Major K. 448'' on spatial–temporal task performance have generated much interest but several misconceptions, many of which are reflected in attempts to replicate the research. The comments by Chabris and Steele et al. echo the most common of these: that listening to Mozart enhances intelligence. ''We made no such claim.'' The effect is limited to spatial–temporal tasks involving mental imagery and temporal ordering.}}

On efforts like Miller's budget proposal, and the press attention surrounding the effect, Rauscher has said, "I don't think it can hurt. I'm all for exposing children to wonderful cultural experiences. But I do think the money could be better spent on music education programs."&lt;ref name="rauschernyt"&gt;Goode, Erica (1999), [https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/03/science/mozart-for-baby-some-say-maybe-not.html "Mozart For Baby? Some Say, Maybe Not"]. ''The New York Times'', 1999-08-03 p. f1: Rauscher, "the money could be better spent on music education programs."&lt;/ref&gt;

Many scholars in the psychological community now view the claim that playing classical music to children can boost their intelligence to be a "myth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=50 Great Myths of Popular Psychology |isbn=1405131128|author1=Lilienfeld, Scott O. |authorlink1=Scott Lilienfeld |author2=Lynn, Steven Jay |author3=Ruscio, John |author4=Beyerstein, Barry L. |year=2009|publisher=Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Emory University]] psychologist [[Scott Lilienfeld]] ranks Mozart Effect as number six in his book ''[[50 Great Myths of Popular Psychology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=University of Vienna|authorlink1=University of Vienna|title=Mozart's music does not make you smarter, study finds|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/05/100510075415.htm|website=www.sciencedaily.com|accessdate=2 January 2017|date=May 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health benefits===
Music has been evaluated to see if it has other properties. The April 2001 edition of ''[[Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine]]'' assessed the possible health benefits of the music of Mozart.&lt;ref name="epilepsyorg"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epilepsy.org.uk/info/mozart.html |title=The Mozart Effect |publisher=epilepsy.org |accessdate= 2007-08-07|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130109052504/http://epilepsy.org.uk/info/treatment/mozart-effect|archivedate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Jenkins played Sonata K.448 to patients with epilepsy and found a decrease in epileptiform activity. According to the British Epilepsy Organization, research has suggested that apart from Mozart's [[Sonata for Two Pianos in D major (Mozart)|K.448]] and [[Piano Concerto No. 23 (Mozart)|Piano Concerto No. 23 (K. 488)]], only one other piece of music has been found to have a similar effect; a song by the Greek composer [[Yanni]], entitled "Acroyali/Standing in Motion" (version from ''[[Yanni Live at the Acropolis]] performed at the [[Acropolis]]'').&lt;ref name="epilepsyorg"/&gt; It was determined to have the "Mozart effect", by the ''[[Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine]]'' because it was similar to Mozart's K.448 in [[tempo]], structure, melodic and harmonic consonance and predictability.&lt;ref name="epilepsyorg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yanni in Words67"&gt;{{cite book |last=Yanni |author2=Rensin, David |title=Yanni in Words |publisher=[[Miramax Books]] |year=2002 |isbn=1-4013-5194-8|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses of Mozart's music==
While it is clear that exposure to Mozart does not raise IQ, studies of the effects of music have explored as diverse areas as its links to [[seizure]] onset&lt;ref name="epilepsyorg"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hughes|first1=J. R.|last2=Daaboul|first2=Y.|last3=Fino|first3=J. J.|last4=Shaw|first4=G.

J. |doi=10.1080/01616412.1998.11740543}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The original claim continues to influence public life. For instance a German [[sewage treatment]] plant plays Mozart music to break down the waste faster, reports the UK ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]''.  Anton Stucki, chief operator of the [[Treuenbrietzen]] plant was quoted as saying, "We think the secret is in the vibrations of the music, which penetrate everything—including the water, the sewage and the cells."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Connolly|first=Kate|title=Sewage plant plays Mozart to stimulate microbes|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/02/sewage-mozart-germany|accessdate=8 April 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Civics Bureau''' ({{lang-ms|Biro Tata Negara}}), abbreviated '''BTN''', was an [[Government agency|agency]] of the Malaysian previous ruling [[government of Malaysia|government]] under [[Barisan Nasional]] (BN) coalition in the [[Prime Minister's Department]]. It was established in 1974 as the Youth Research Unit (Unit Penyelidikan Belia) under the Youth Ministry, but was renamed and transferred in 1981.

==Allegations of racism==
Although BTN has been the subject of various allegations over the years, in late 2009, it became the subject of greater controversy, when many allegations of racism and political propaganda appeared in quick succession. One BTN alumnus claimed that he was "taught a song with lyrics like 'the land that you walk upon is owned by others'. Lecturers told us the [[Malay people|Malays]] were forced to depend on the [[Chinese Malaysian|Chinese]] for support after 1998 because some Malays had betrayed their own race," in reference to Malays voting against the [[Barisan Nasional]] in [[Malaysian general election, 1999|1999 general election]]. [[Nik Nazmi Nik Ahmad]], another alumnus and assemblyman for Seri Setia in the [[Selangor State Assembly|State Legislative Assembly of Selangor]], claimed that the BTN camp he attended was "racial and political in nature," with trainers telling attendees that Malays require [[affirmative action]] and criticising the opposition [[Parti Islam SeMalaysia]] (PAS) as "deviationist". Amirudin Shari, assemblyman for [[Batu Caves]], claimed that "participants are indoctrinated with propaganda about '[[Ketuanan Melayu]]' and external threats".&lt;ref name="patriotism camps"&gt;{{cite news |title=KL patriotism camps ‘racist and political’ |url =http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/44127-kl-patriotism-camps-racist-and-political |work=The Malaysian Insider |date=21 November 2009 |accessdate=21 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another alumnus claims he was taught that the Chinese were "the Jews of Asia," and part of a [[Conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] to topple the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Asrul Hadi | last=Abdullah Sani | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=‘BTN taught me the Chinese are the Jews of Asia’ | date=27 November 2009 | publisher=The Malaysian Insider | url =http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/44775-btn-taught-me-the-chinese-are-the-jews-of-asia | work = | pages = | accessdate = 27 November 2009 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another alumnus alleged she was "told that the Malays were the most supreme race in the world, we were God's chosen few, that the others were insignificant. We were warned about certain elements in our society and abroad, determined to undermine Malay excellence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Mariam | last=Mokhtar | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=BTN: Divisive, racist, {{Sic|hide=y|politically|-}}motivated | date=5 December 2009 | publisher= | url =http://malaysiakini.com/news/119070 | work =Malaysiakini | pages = | accessdate = 7 December 2009 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 November 2009, Nik Nazmi, Amirudin and five other [[Pakatan Rakyat]] state assemblymen asked the Selangor government to stop requiring students at its universities and colleges to attend BTN courses. After the Selangor government issued a ban prohibiting state employees and students at state institutions from attending BTN programmes, the State Executive Councillor for Education, Dr. Halimah Ali, described the courses as "indoctrination by the Barisan Nasional government" and said, "the courses promote racism and my own children who have attended BTN have been given booklets that encourage hate towards the opposition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Neville |last=Spykerman |title=Selangor moves to stop BTN ‘brainwashing’ | date=26 November 2009 |url=http://themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/44582-selangor-moves-to-stop-btn-brainwashing |work=The Malaysian Insider |accessdate=26 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, BTN deputy director Hamim Husin was reported for referring Chinese as ''Si mata pepet'' (the slant-eyed) and Indians as ''Si botol'' (the drinkers) during a closed-door function of Puteri UMNO (Women youth wing of [[United Malays National Organisation]]) delegates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Su Lyn|first1=Boo|title=Malays must rule the country, says BTN rep|url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/malays-must-rule-the-country-says-btn-rep#sthash.hm9a6NCx.dpbs|accessdate=21 June 2015|publisher=The Malaysian Insider|date=27 September 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526175152/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/malays-must-rule-the-country-says-btn-rep|archivedate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kashuerin|first1=Suresh|title=Kit Siang: Racist BTN should be dissolved|url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2015/06/19/kit-siang-racist-btn-should-be-dissolved/|accessdate=21 June 2015|publisher=Free Malaysia Today|date=19 June 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621211148/http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2015/06/19/kit-siang-racist-btn-should-be-dissolved/|archivedate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2010, Minister in Prime Minister's department [[Mohamed Nazri Abdul Aziz|Nazri Aziz]] reported that the deputy director has been suspended from duty since October 2010 and a warning letter has been issued.

==Response by the Malaysian government==
''The Malaysian Insider'' reported in November 2009 that in response to brewing controversy, the [[Cabinet of Malaysia|Cabinet]] had discussed the need to revamp BTN. Minister in the Prime Minister's Department [[Idris Jala]] arranged a briefing for the Cabinet on the effects of BTN programmes, and the meeting concluded with the Prime Minister reportedly saying, "This must end." In an editorial, the publication said: "''The Malaysian Insider'' understands that there are moves within the administration to dilute the syllabus of BTN courses, as a compromise. But such half-measures are not likely to be enough if Najib is serious about reversing what many Malaysians see as institutionalised racism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Leslie | last=Lau | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Najib’s BTN dilemma | date=28 November 2009 | publisher= | url =http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/44845-pkr-najib-faces-btn-dilemma | work =The Malaysian Insider | pages = | accessdate = 29 November 2009 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former [[Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia|Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Malay titles|Tan Sri]] [[Muhyiddin Yassin]] defended BTN, saying its programmes inculcate nationalism and unity among Malaysians in line with the Prime Minister's [[1Malaysia]] concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=DPM defends BTN courses against racist brainwashing charges  |url=http://themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/44692-muhyiddin-btn-courses-not-political-indoctrination |work=The Malaysian Insider |date=26 November 2009 |accessdate=27 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=BTN Courses Not Political Indoctrination - Muhyiddin  |url=http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v5/newsindex.php?id=458094 |work=BERNAMA |date=26 November 2009 |accessdate=27 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Deputy Minister in the Prime Minister's Department [[Malay titles|Datuk]] [[Ahmad Maslan]] said "knowledge and information ... presented at these courses are based on historical facts and data ... collected from various agencies and ... experts" and are consistent with 1Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Teaching based on historical facts and data'  |url=http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v5/newsindex.php?id=458094 |work=The New Straits Times |date=27 November 2009 |accessdate=27 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahmad, who is also head of the BTN, denied allegations that it was systemically racist: "Out of the 1,000 lectures given, maybe only one minute the lecturer had a slip-up so it is unfair that you portray BTN as racist just for that." Describing typical course contents, he said participants "are taught about the Federal Constitution, the social contract, the position of the Malays in this country and 60 per cent of the population are the bumiputras." Although Minister in the Prime Minister's Department [[Nazri Aziz]] previously told the press that the Cabinet had ordered a revamp of BTN courses to eliminate elements inconsistent with 1Malaysia, Ahmad denied this, saying that Cabinet merely wanted an "upgrade" as opposed to a "revamp".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Syed Jaymal | last=Zahiid | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=More flip-flop as BTN chief speaks out | date=1 December 2009 | publisher= | url =http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/45128-more-flip-flop-as-btn-chief-speaks-out- | work =The Malaysian Insider | pages = | accessdate = 1 December 2009 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Responding, Nazri insisted that "Whatever word you use, upgrade or revamp ... to me, it is a change of module. Datuk Ahmad Masalan is a member of the Cabinet, he can’t dispute my statement." Nazri also criticised the denial of allegations against BTN, saying that opposition members who had previously been in government like Leader of the Opposition [[Anwar Ibrahim]] "know, so what is there to deny?" and said that BTN had been used to promote certain political leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Syed Jaymal | last=Zahiid | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Nazri says no point denying what BTN is | date=1 December 2009 | publisher= | url =http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/45161-nazri-says-no-point-denying-what-btn-is- | work =The Malaysian Insider | pages = | accessdate = 1 December 2009 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mahathir's involvement in BTN==
Former Prime Minister [[Mahathir Mohamad]] defended BTN as meant to inculcate the values of discipline and hard work in public servants and scholars: "What we tried to teach them is that they should have new values, new culture...because the culture and the value-system they have is not conducive to success. If they want to serve the government well, they must accept and practice a certain value system."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Shazwan | last=Mustafa Kamal | coauthors= | authorlink= | title=Dr M says criticisms against BTN an ‘exaggeration’ | date=7 December 2009 | publisher= | url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/45729-dr-m-says-criticisms-against-btn-an-exaggeration- | work=The Malaysian Insider | pages= | accessdate=7 December 2009 | language= | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212223735/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/45729-dr-m-says-criticisms-against-btn-an-exaggeration- | archivedate=12 December 2009 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling party-owned ''[[Utusan Malaysia]]'' newspaper criticised the decision to change the BTN curriculum, claiming Nazri was acting on his own and urging the government not to "bow down" to the opposition.&lt;ref name='nazri dr m'&gt;{{cite news | first=Asrul Hadi | last=Abdullah Sani | coauthors= | authorlink= | title=Nazri calls Dr M a racist for defending BTN | date=7 December 2009 | publisher= | url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/45724-nazri-calls-dr-m-a-racist-for-defending-btn | work=The Malaysian Insider | pages= | accessdate=7 December 2009 | language= | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212223732/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/45724-nazri-calls-dr-m-a-racist-for-defending-btn | archivedate=12 December 2009 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Nazri branded Mahathir's statement "bloody racist," criticising both him and ''Utusan Malaysia'' for denying the allegations against BTN:

{{quote|Don't think that people outside do not know about the syllabus based on patriotism for Malays. ... They all know what the syllabus is all about so who are we to say that it did not happen? You want to lie? You make people laugh. I mean there are people who attended the courses who came out very angry. There were many instances of the use of words like ''ketuanan Melayu''. It is ridiculous... Do they want to say that Malaysia belongs only to the Malays and the government is only a Malay government? Should only the Malays be given the spirit of patriotism? Other races are not patriotic about their country?&lt;ref name='nazri dr m'/&gt;}}

Nazri denied that criticism from Pakatan Rakyat or the Selangor government decision were reasons for the Cabinet decision, saying: "...courses run by BTN using public funds must be used properly and it amounts to millions so if you want to talk about patriotism, patriotism for all, not just the Malays, for all Malaysians. It's not because of the Selangor state government that we changed the syllabus so it's long before that."&lt;ref name='nazri dr m'/&gt; In response, Mahathir accused Nazri of hypocrisy, saying "I must be a racist if Nazri says I am racist. Don't ever say that I am not. He knows everything. He belongs to a party which is racist... which is [[United Malays National Organisation|Umno]]. ... Umno is a party ''perkauman'' [racism] and is meant only for Malays and nobody [else] can join. So he (Nazri) is in a racist party but says he is against racism. So he should resign from the party." Mahathir is a former President of Umno, and was still a member of it and the time of making the statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=You belong to a racist party: Dr M to Nazri | date=8 December 2009 | publisher= | url =http://malaysiakini.com/news/119320 | work =Malaysiakini | pages = | accessdate = 11 December 2009 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Koh Tsu Koon]], another Minister in the Prime Minister's Department, defended Nazri, saying perhaps Mahathir was unaware of the nature of BTN's curriculum: "[R]ecent feedback from participants since last year showed that the BTN course has diverted from its earlier version. Participants, including JPA [Public Services Department] scholars, felt very upset and disheartened."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=G. | last=Manimaran | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Nazri finds another backer in tiff with Dr M | date=8 December 2009 | publisher= | url =http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/45862-nazri-finds-another-backer-in-tiff-with-dr-m | work =The Malaysian Insider | pages = | accessdate = 11 December 2009 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former BTN director and Member of Parliament for [[Sungai Petani]], [[Johari Abdul]] then alleged that Mahathir was responsible for changes in the BTN programme, saying that under Mahathir, BTN courses emphasised propaganda supportive of the ruling party, making claims such as "If the Umno-BN government falls, then ... the Malays would be enslaved in their own country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Syed Jaymal | last=Zahiid | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Dr M transformed BTN to a super-racist agency, says former director | date=8 December 2009 | publisher= | url =http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/45873-dr-m-transformed-btn-to-a-super-racist-agency-says-former-director- | work =The Malaysian Insider | pages = | accessdate = 11 December 2009 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Members of Parliament, such as deputy chair of the Barisan Nasional Backbenchers Club and MP for [[Kinabatangan]], [[Bung Mokhtar Radin]], argued that BTN still served a useful purpose: "I don't see it as racist. It is one of the government agencies that have taught society the characteristics of a great nation and understand the real Malaysia. BTN has also played a role since independence towards strengthening racial harmony in this country. So I really regret the actions by Pakatan state governments to prohibit the activities by BTN because BTN has never had the intention to weaken any party members but it is a platform for the public to gain knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Asrul Hadi | last=Abdullah Sani | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Umno backbenchers maintain BTN is not racist | date=9 December 2009 | publisher= | url =http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/45989-umno-backbenchers-maintain-btn-is-not-racist- | work =The Malaysian Insider | pages = | accessdate = 11 December 2009 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leaked presentation slides ==
From 11 March 2015 until 15 June 2015, BTN had published a series of presentation slides which was available on its official website. One of the presentation slides had claimed [[Malay language|Malay]] [[Small press|independent publishers]] to be "anti-establishment", in which their "movement without supervision from the authorities" will "bring a negative effect on the government" and  giving birth to "new icons of the young generation that spread extreme and free ideas".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The slide had also recommended that government officials ban any books having "explicit and free" content produced by them.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gerakan Indie Di Malaysia (Indie Movement in Malaysia)|url=https://archive.org/details/GerakanIndieDiMalaysia|publisher=Biro Tata Negara|accessdate=23 June 2015|language=Malay}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BTN slaps bull’s-eye on Malay counterculture for anti-establishment bent|url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/btn-slaps-bulls-eye-on-malay-counterculture-for-anti-establishment-bent|accessdate=23 June 2015|agency=Malay Mail online|date=15 June 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623143632/http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/btn-slaps-bulls-eye-on-malay-counterculture-for-anti-establishment-bent|archivedate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has raised ire from the publishers, who had collectively made a media statement demanding a public apology from the agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Malay indie group strikes back at BTN, demands public apology|url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/malay-indie-group-strikes-back-at-btn-demands-public-apology|accessdate=23 June 2015|publisher=The Malay Mail Online|date=20 June 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623144619/http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/malay-indie-group-strikes-back-at-btn-demands-public-apology|archivedate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the incident, BTN decided to take down all the controversial slides from its website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BTN removes slides from website after caught with pants down|url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/btn-removes-slides-from-website-after-caught-with-pants-down|accessdate=23 June 2015|publisher=The Malay Mail Online|date=15 June 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150616175133/http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/btn-removes-slides-from-website-after-caught-with-pants-down|archivedate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while maintaining that the content of the slides were meant for "academic discussion" only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=No hard feelings, BTN boss tells ‘indie’ scene after attack slides leaked|url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/no-hard-feelings-btn-boss-tells-indie-scene-after-attack-slides-leaked|accessdate=23 June 2015|publisher=The Malay Mail Online|date=16 June 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623145631/http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/no-hard-feelings-btn-boss-tells-indie-scene-after-attack-slides-leaked|archivedate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other slides published by the agency included a slide that examined the performance of the [[Barisan Nasional]] (BN) ruling coalition from 1959 to 2014 with racial breakdown of popular votes towards BN and [[Pakatan Rakyat]] (PR) seats and also percentages of Muslim and non-Muslim [[member of parliament]] (MPs) in [[Parliament of Malaysia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Politik Malaysia|url=https://archive.org/details/POLITIKMALAYSIA|publisher=Biro Tata Negara|accessdate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another slide had accused Chinese newspapers of being "fine needles that penetrate the government whilst promoting opposition movements." The national opposition party [[Democratic Action Party]] (DAP) is accused of using several Malay leaders to purportedly "destroy the Malay community". DAP was also accused in the slide of controlling the minds of people from [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]] by invoking the issue of [[Titular Roman Catholic Archbishop of Kuala Lumpur v Menteri Dalam Negeri|the use of the name "Allah" in the context of local Christian presses]], and inciting separation of both states from Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tan|first1=Tarrence|title=BTN is Apartheid 2.0 in M’sia, says DAP|url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2015/06/16/btn-is-apartheid-2-0-in-msia-says-dap/|accessdate=23 June 2015|publisher=Free Malaysia Today|date=16 June 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150618195549/http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2015/06/16/btn-is-apartheid-2-0-in-msia-says-dap/|archivedate=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The slide also claimed that a change in the current government will cause "political instability" in the country, bringing up comparisons with the [[Pol Pot]]'s [[Khmer Rouge rule of Cambodia|Khmer Rouge regime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Perkembangan Cabaran Politik semasa dalam negara (Development of current political challenges in the country)|url=https://archive.org/details/PERKEMBANGANCABARANPOLITIKSEMASADALAMNEGARA|publisher=Biro Tata Negara|accessdate=23 June 2015|language=Malay}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another slide presents a breakdown of a list of the 10 richest men in Malaysia, where most of them are Chinese, and also the situation of Christians "being allowed to build large churches despite only accounting for 9.1% of the total population in Malaysia".

'''Performativity''' is [[language]] which effects change in the world and functions as a form of social action.&lt;ref name=Cavanaugh&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cavanaugh|first1=Jillian R.|title=Performativity|journal=Anthropology|date=10 March 2015|doi=10.1093/OBO/9780199766567-0114|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199766567/obo-9780199766567-0114.xml|accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has multiple applications in diverse fields, such as [[linguistics]], [[philosophy]], [[anthropology]], [[jurisprudence|law]], [[gender studies]], [[performance studies]], and [[economics]].

Performativity was first defined by [[philosopher of language]] [[J. L. Austin|John L. Austin]] as the capacity of speech and communication to act or to consummate an action. Common examples of performative language are making promises, betting, performing a wedding ceremony, an umpire calling a strike, or a judge pronouncing a verdict. Austin differentiated this from constative language, which he defined as descriptive language that can be "evaluated as true or false".&lt;ref name=Cavanaugh/&gt;

Influenced by Austin, philosopher and gender theorist [[Judith Butler]] argued that [[social construction of gender|gender is socially constructed]] through commonplace [[speech act]]s and [[nonverbal communication]] that are performative, in that they serve to define and maintain [[social identity|identities]].&lt;ref name="Butler1990"&gt;{{cite book|last=Butler|first=Judith|title=Gender Trouble|year=1990|publisher=Routledge|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view of performativity reverses the idea that a person's identity is the source of their secondary actions (speech, gestures). Instead, it views actions, behaviors and gestures as both the result of an individual's identity as well as a source that contributes to the formation of one's identity which is continuously being redefined through speech acts and symbolic communication.&lt;ref name=Cavanaugh/&gt; This view was also influenced by philosophers such as [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Louis Althusser]].&lt;ref&gt;Cultural Studies and Discourse Analysis – Barker &amp; Galasinski&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===J. L. Austin===

The term derives from the founding work in [[speech act]] theory by ordinary language philosopher [[J. L. Austin]], who did not use the word "performativity", but did, beginning in the 1950s, give the name [[performative utterances]] to situations where saying something was doing something, rather than simply reporting on or describing reality. The paradigmatic case here is speaking the words "I do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Austin|first=J L|title=How To Do Things With Words|year=1962|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breaking with [[analytic philosophy]], Austin argued in ''[[How to Do Things With Words]]'' that a "performative utterance" cannot be said to be either true or false, as a constative utterance might be. It can only be judged either "happy" or "infelicitous", depending upon whether the conditions required for its success have been met. In this sense, performativity is a function of the [[pragmatics]] of language. Having shown that ''all'' utterances perform actions, even apparently constative ones, Austin famously discarded the distinction between "performative" and "constative" utterances halfway through the lecture series that became the book and replaced it with a three-level framework:

* ''locution'' (the actual words spoken, that which the linguists and linguistic philosophers of the day were mostly interested in analyzing) 
* ''illocutionary force'' (what the speaker is attempting to do ''in'' uttering the locution) 
* ''perlocutionary effect'' (the actual effect the speaker actually has on the interlocutor ''by'' uttering the locution)

For example, if a speech act is an attempt to distract someone, the illocutionary force is the attempt to distract and the perlocutionary effect is the actual distraction caused by the speech act in the interlocutor.

Austin's account of performativity has been subject to extensive discussion in philosophy, literature, and beyond. [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Shoshana Felman]], [[Judith Butler]], and [[Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick]] are among the scholars who have elaborated upon and contested aspects of Austin's account from the vantage point of [[deconstruction]], [[psychoanalysis]], [[feminism]], and [[queer theory]]. Particularly in the work of feminists and queer theorists, performativity has played an important role in discussions of [[social change]] (Oliver 2003).

The concept of performativity has also been used in [[science and technology studies]] and in [[economic sociology]]. [[Andrew Pickering]] has proposed to shift from a "representational idiom" to a "performative idiom" in the study of science. [[Michel Callon]] has proposed to study the performative aspects of [[economics]], i.e. the extent to which economic science plays an important role not only in describing markets and economies, but also in framing them. Karen Barad has argued that science and technology studies deemphasize the performativity of language in order to explore the performativity of matter (Barad 2003).

Other uses of the notion of performativity in the social sciences include the daily behavior (or performance) of individuals based on social norms or habits. Philosopher and feminist theorist [[Judith Butler]] has used the concept of performativity in her analysis of [[gender]] development, as well as in her analysis of political speech. [[Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick]] describes [[Queer theory|queer]] performativity as an ongoing project for transforming the way we may define—and break—boundaries to identity. Through her suggestion that shame is a potentially performative and transformational emotion, Sedgwick has also linked queer performativity to [[affect theory]]. Also innovative in Sedgwick's discussion of the performative is what she calls ''periperformativity'' (2003: 67–91), which is effectively the group contribution to the success or failure of a speech act.

===John Searle's reformulation===
In ''[[A Taxonomy of Illocutionary Acts]]'', [[John Searle]] takes up and reformulates the ideas of his colleague [[J. L. Austin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Expression and meaning : studies in the theory of speech acts|year=1979|publisher=Cambridge University Press|last = Searle|first = John|authorlink=John Searle}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Searle largely supports and agrees with Austin’s theory of speech acts, he has a number of critiques, which he outlines: “In sum, there are (at least) six related difficulties with Austin’s taxonomy; in ascending order of importance: there is a persistent confusion between verbs and acts, not all the verbs are illocutionary verbs, there is too much overlap of the categories, too much heterogeneity within the categories, many of the verbs listed in the categories don't satisfy the definition given for the category and, most important, there is no consistent principle of classification.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Expression and meaning : studies in the theory of speech acts|year=1979|publisher=Cambridge University Press|last = Searle|first = John|authorlink=John Searle|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His last key departure from Austin lies in Searle’s claim that four of his universal ‘acts’ do not need ‘extra-linguistic’ contexts to succeed.&lt;ref name="John1979"&gt;{{cite book|title=Expression and meaning : studies in the theory of speech acts|year=1979|publisher=Cambridge University Press|last = Searle|first = John|authorlink=John Searle|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; As opposed to Austin who thinks all illocutionary acts need extra-linguistic institutions, Searle disregards the necessity of context and replaces it with the “rules of language.”&lt;ref name="John1979" /&gt;

=== Jacques Derrida ===
Philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]] drew on Austin's theory of performative speech act while deconstructing its logocentric and phonocentric premises and reinscribing it within the operations of generalized writing. In contrast to structuralism's focus on linguistic form, Austin had introduced the ''force'' of speech acts, which Derrida aligns with [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche's]] insights on language. 

In "Signature, Event, Context," Derrida focused on Austin's privileging of speech and the accompanying presumptions of the presence of a speaker ("signature") and the bounding of a performative's force by an act or a context. In a passage that would become a touchstone of poststructuralist thought, Derrida stresses the citationality or iterability of any and all signs.&lt;blockquote&gt;Every sign, linguistic or nonlinguistic, spoken or written (in the current sense of this opposition), in a small or large unit, can be ''cited'', put between quotation marks; in doing so it can break with every given context, engendering an infinity of new contexts in a manner which is absolutely illimitable. This does not imply that the mark is valid outside of a context, but on the contrary that there are only contexts without any center or absolute anchorage [''ancrage'']. This citationality, this duplication or duplicity, this iterability of the mark is neither an accident nor an anomaly, it is that (normal/abnormal) without which a mark could not even have a function called "normal." What would a mark be that could not be cited? Or one whose origins would not get lost along the way?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Limited, Inc.|last=Derrida|first=Jacques|publisher=Northwestern University Press|year=1988|isbn=978-0810107885|location=Evanston|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Derrida's stress on the citational dimension of performativity would be taken up by Judith Butler and other theorists. While he addressed the performativity of individual subject formation, Derrida also raised such questions as whether we can mark when the event of the Russian revolution went awry, thus scaling up the field of performativity to historical dimensions. 

=== Judith Butler ===
{{Main|Gender performativity}}

Philosopher and [[feminist]] theorist [[Judith Butler]] offered a new, more [[Continental philosophy|Continental]] (specifically, [[Michel Foucault|Foucauldian]]) reading of the notion of performativity, which has its roots in [[linguistics]] and [[philosophy of language]]. She describes performativity as “that reiterative power of discourse to produce the phenomena that it regulates and constrains.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Bodies that Matter:  On the Discursive Limits of "Sex"|last = Butler|first = Judith|publisher = Routledge|year = 1993|isbn = 9780415903660|location = New York|pages = xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has largely used this concept in her analysis of [[gender]] development.&lt;ref&gt;This idea was first introduced in 1988 in an issue of ''[[Theatre Journal]]'' (Brickell, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept places emphasis on the manners by which identity is passed or brought to life through discourse.  Performative acts are types of authoritative speech. This can only happen and be enforced through the law or norms of the society. These statements, just by speaking them, carry out a certain action and exhibit a certain level of power. Examples of these types of statements are declarations of ownership, baptisms, inaugurations, and legal sentences. Something that is key to performativity is repetition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Halberstam|first=Jack|title=An audio overview of queer theory in English and Turkish by Jack Halberstam|url=https://archive.org/details/HalberstamQueerTheory-AnkaraTurkey|accessdate=29 May 2014|date=2014-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statements are not singular in nature or use and must be used consistently in order to exert power (Hall 2000).

==== Performance theory and gender perspectives ====

Butler sees gender as an act that has been rehearsed, much like a script, and that people, as actors who make a script a reality through repetition, come to perform in the mode of belief. “For Butler, the distinction between the personal and the political or between private and public is itself a fiction designed to support an oppressive status quo: our most personal acts are, in fact, continually being scripted by hegemonic social conventions and ideologies” (Felluga, 2006).  Butler sees gender not as an expression of what one is, rather as something that one does.  Furthermore, she sees it not as a social imposition on a gender neutral body, but rather as a mode of "self-making" through which subjects become socially intelligible.  According to Butler’s theory, homosexuality and heterosexuality are not fixed categories.  A person is merely in a condition of “doing straightness” or “doing queerness” (Lloyd, 1999).

==== Theoretical criticisms ====

There are several criticisms that have been raised against Butler's concept of performativity.  The first is that the theory is individual in nature and does not take other factors into consideration.  These factors include the space within which the performance occurs, the others involved and how they might see or interpret what they witness.  Also, the unplanned effects of the performance act are overlooked and the contingencies are not taken into consideration. (Lloyd, 1999)

Another criticism is that Butler is not clear about the concept of subject.  It has been said that in her writings, sometimes the subject only exists tentatively, sometimes they possess a “real” existence and other times are socially active.  Also, some observe that the theory might be better suited to literary analysis as opposed to social theory. (Brickell, 2005)

Others criticize Butler for taking [[Ethnomethodology|ethnomethodological]] and [[Symbolic interactionism|symbolic interactionist]] sociological analyses of gender and merely reinventing them in the concept of performativity (Dunn 1997; Green 2007).  For example, Green (2007) argues that the work of [[Sue Kessler|Kessler]] and [[Wendy McKenna|McKenna]] (1978) and West and Zimmerman (1987) builds directly from [[Harold Garfinkel|Garfinkel]] (1967) and [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] (1959) to deconstruct gender into moments of attribution and iteration in a continual social process of "doing" [[masculinity]] and [[femininity]] in the [[performative interval]].  These latter works are premised on the notion that gender does not precede but, rather, follows from practice, instantiated in micro-interaction. Butler downgrades gender's constructed nature to fight for oppressed identities.

=== Jean-François Lyotard ===
In ''[[The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge]]'' (1979, English translation 1986), philosopher and cultural theorist [[Jean-François Lyotard]] defined performativity as the defining mode of [[legitimation]] of postmodern knowledge and social bonds, that is, power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge.|last=Lyotard|first=Jean-Francois|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=1986|isbn=978-0816611737|location=Minneapolis|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the legitimation of modern knowledge through such grand narratives as Progress, Revolution, and Liberation, performativity operates by system optimization or the calculation of input and outputs. In a footnote, Lyotard aligns performativity with Austin's concept of performative speech act. Postmodern knowledge must not only report: it must do something and do it efficiently by maximizing input/output ratios.

Lyotard uses [[Ludwig Wittgenstein's philosophy of mathematics|Wittgenstein's]] notion of language games to theorize how performativity governs the articulation, funding, and conduct of contemporary research and education, arguing that at bottom it involves the threat of terror: "be operational (that is commensurable) or disappear" (xxiv). While Lyotard is highly critical of performativity, he notes that it calls on researchers to explain not only the worth of their work but also the worth of that worth. 

Lyotard associated performativity with the rise of digital computers in the post-World War II period. In ''Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945,'' historian [[Tony Judt]] cites Lyotard to argue that the Left has largely abandoned revolutionary politics for human rights advocacy. The widespread adoption of performance reviews, organizational assessments, and learning outcomes by different social institutions worldwide has led social researchers to theorize "audit culture" and "global performativity." 

Against performativity and [[Jürgen Habermas|Jurgen Habermas]]' call for consensus, Lyotard argued for legitimation by ''paralogy'', or the destabilizing, often paradoxical, introduction of difference into language games.

==Other applications==

===Video art===

Theories of performativity have extended across multiple disciplines and discussions. Notably, interdisciplinary theorist [[José Esteban Muñoz]] has related video to theories of performativity. Specifically, Muñoz looks at the 1996 documentary by Susana Aiken and Carlos Aparicio, "The Transformation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Disidentifications: Queers of Color and the Performance of Politics|author = Muñoz|authorlink = José Esteban Muñoz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although historically and theoretically related to performance art, [[video art]] is not an immediate performance; it is mediated, iterative and citational. In this way, video art raises questions of performativity. Additionally, video art frequently puts bodies and display, complicating borders, surfaces, embodiment, and boundaries and so indexing performativity.

=== Finance and economics ===
In economics, the “performativity thesis” is the claim that the assumptions and models used by professionals and popularizers affect the phenomena they purport to describe; bringing the world more into line with theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://kieranhealy.org/files/drafts/performativity.pdf|title = The Performativity of Networks|last = Healy|first = Kieran|date = 2015|journal = European Journal of Sociology|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="doing"&gt;{{cite book|title=Doing Economics|date=2010|publisher=The Open University|location=Milton Keynes|isbn=978 1 8487 34692|page=493}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is debated in ''Do Economists Make Markets'' edited by [[Donald Angus MacKenzie]], Fabian Muniesa and Lucia Siu, and in ''Enacting Dismal Science'' edited by Ivan Boldyrev and Ekaterina Svetlova. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8442.html | title=Do Economists Make Markets?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=http://www.palgrave.com/de/book/9781137492104# | title=Enacting Dismal Science - New Perspectives on the Performativity of Economics &amp;#124; Ivan Boldyrev &amp;#124; Palgrave Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Journalism ===

The German news anchorman [[Hanns Joachim Friedrichs]] once argued that a good journalist should never act in collusion with anything, not even with a good thing. In the evening of November 9, 1989, the evening of the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], however, Friedrichs reportedly broke his own rule when he announced: "The gates of the wall are wide open." („Die Tore in der Mauer stehen weit offen.“) In reality, the gates were still closed. According to a historian, it was this announcement that encouraged thousands of East Berliners to march towards the wall, finally forcing the border guards to open the gates. In the sense of performativity, Friedrichs's words became a reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bild.de/unterhaltung/tv/mauerfall/der-schoenste-fehler-in-40-jahren-tagesthemen-54357108.bild.html | title=Zum Jubiläum - der schönste Fehler in 40 Jahren "Tagesthemen"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/30/AR2009103001846.html | title=Mary Elise Sarotte -- How an accident caused the Berlin Wall to come down| date=November 2009| last1=Sarotte| first1=Mary Elise}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5745">'''Physics First''' is an educational program in the USA, that teaches a basic [[physics]] course in the ninth grade (usually 15-year-olds),&lt;ref&gt;See, for example [http://www.physicsfirstmo.org/ a National Science Foundation-funded project for 80 physics teachers 2009-2014]&lt;/ref&gt; rather than the [[biology]] course which is more standard in public schools. This course relies on the limited math skills that the students have from pre-algebra and algebra I.  With these skills students study a broad subset of the introductory physics canon with an emphasis on topics which can be experienced kinesthetically or without deep mathematical reasoning. Furthermore, teaching physics first is better suited for English Language Learners, who would be overwhelmed by the substantial vocabulary requirements of Biology. 

Physics First began as an organized movement among educators around 1990, and has been slowly catching on throughout the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aapt.org/Resources/policy/physicsfirst.cfm American Association of Physics Teachers, College Park, MD, April 13, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;   The most prominent movement championing Physics First is [[Leon Lederman]]'s ARISE (American Renaissance in Science Education). 

Many proponents of Physics First argue that turning this order around lays the foundations for better understanding of chemistry, which in turn will lead to more comprehension of biology.  Due to the tangible nature of most introductory physics experiments, Physics First also lends itself well to an introduction to inquiry-based science education, where students are encouraged to probe the workings of the world in which they live.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aapt.org/aboutaapt/ennouncer/upload/physicsfirst.pdf Physics First: an informational guide for teachers, school administrators, parents, scientists, and the public --  upload file from the American Association of Physics Teachers]&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of high schools which have implemented "physics first" do so by way of offering two separate classes, at two separate levels: simple physics concepts in 9th grade, followed by more advanced physics courses in 11th or 12th grade.  In schools with this curriculum, nearly all 9th grade students take a "Physical Science", or "Introduction to Physics Concepts" course.  These courses focus on concepts that can be studied with skills from pre-algebra and algebra I.  With these ideas in place, students then can be exposed to ideas with more physics related content in chemistry, and other science electives.  After this, students are then encouraged to take an 11th or 12th grade course in physics, which does use more advanced math, including vectors, geometry, and more involved algebra.

There is a large overlap between the Physics First movement, and the movement towards teaching [[conceptual physics]] - teaching physics in a way that emphasizes a strong understanding of physical principles over problem-solving ability.  Many Physics First programs use the popular textbook "Conceptual Physics" by [[Paul G. Hewitt]].

==Criticism==
American public schools traditionally teach biology in the first year of high school, chemistry in the second, and physics in the third. The belief is that this order is more accessible, largely because biology can be taught with less mathematics, and will do the most toward providing some [[scientific literacy]] for the largest number of students.

In addition, many scientists and educators argue that freshmen do not have an adequate background in mathematics to be able to fully comprehend a complete physics curriculum, and that therefore quality of a physics education is lost. While physics requires knowledge of vectors and some basic [[trigonometry]],  many students in the Physics First program take the course in conjunction with [[geometry]]. They suggest that instead students first take [[biology]] and [[chemistry]] which are less [[mathematics]]-intensive so that by the time they are in their junior year, students will be advanced enough in mathematics with either an [[algebra]] 2 or [[pre-calculus]] education to be able to fully grasp the concepts presented in physics. Some argue this even further, saying that at least calculus should be a prerequisite for physics.

Others point out that, for example, secondary school students will never study the advanced physics that underlies chemistry in the first place.  “[I]nclined planes (frictionless or not) didn't come up in ... high school chemistry class ... and the same can be said for some of the chemistry that really makes sense of biological phenomena.” &lt;ref&gt;[http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2007/07/27/brief-remarks-on-physics-first/ Brief remarks on 'physics first' and high school science.]&lt;/ref&gt;  For physics to be relevant to a chemistry course, students have to develop a truly fundamental understanding of the concepts of energy, force, and matter, beyond the context of specific applications like the inclined plane.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17649">'''Political satire''' is [[satire]] that specializes in gaining entertainment from [[politics]]; it has also been used with [[subversive]] intent where [[Political discourse analysis|political speech]] and dissent are forbidden by a regime, as a method of advancing political arguments where such arguments are expressly forbidden.

Political satire is usually distinguished from political [[protest]] or [[political dissent]], as it does not necessarily carry an agenda nor seek to influence the political process. While occasionally it may, it more commonly aims simply to provide entertainment. By its very nature, it rarely offers a constructive view in itself; when it is used as part of protest or dissent, it tends to simply establish the error of matters rather than provide solutions.

==Origins and genres==
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Ghjkl.JPG|left|thumb|Animated shows like South Park are notorious for political satire]] --&gt;
Satire can be traced back throughout history; wherever organized [[government]], or social categories, has existed, so has satire.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The oldest example that has survived till today is [[Aristophanes]]. In his time satire targeted top politicians, like Cleon,&lt;ref&gt;Stephanos Matthaios, Franco Montanari, Antonios Rengakos [https://books.google.com/books?id=EZuetiBvK-wC&amp;pg=PA207&amp;lpg=PA207 ''Ancient Scholarship and Grammar: Archetypes, Concepts and Contexts''] pp.207-8&lt;/ref&gt; and religion, at the time headed by Zeus. "Satire and derision progressively attacked even the fundamental and most sacred facts of faith," leading to an increased doubt towards religion by the general population.&lt;ref&gt;[[Victor Ehrenberg (historian)|Ehrenberg, Victor]] (1962) [https://books.google.com/books?id=oikOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA263 ''The people of Aristophanes: a sociology of old Attic comedy''] p.263 quotation: {{quotation|The fact that the gods could be brought down to a human or 'far too human' level is certainly rooted in the very nature of Greek religion, and there is no doubt that this attitude contributed to the gradual undermining of the old belief in the gods. [...] To tell immoral and scandalous stories about the gods did not offend average religious feeling; it troubled only advanced spirits like Xenophanes and Pintar [...] and it is clear that people no longer believed either in the story or in Zeus. Satire and derision progressively attacked even the fundamental and most sacred facts of faith, above all faith in the gods' power, and it was from this that doubt began to grow.&lt;br&gt; The power of the gods, whose dignity and stringth were impressively reflected in most of the tragedies, however different the religious attitudes of the tragic poets were, this same power was on the same festival days belittled and questioned by the comic poets who made fun of the gods and represented traditional and sacred forms in a starling manner.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman period, for example, gives us the satirical poems and epigrams of [[Martial]]. [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]] philosophers often engaged in political satire.

Due to lack of political freedom of speech in many ancient civilizations, [[covert satire]] is more usual than overt satire in ancient literatures of [[political liberalism]]. Historically, the [[public opinion]] in the [[Athenian democracy]] was remarkably influenced by the political [[satire]] performed by the [[comic poets]] at the [[Ancient Greek theatre|theatres]].&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, J. (1993) ''Comic Hero versus Political Elite'' pp.307-19 in {{cite book |editor=Sommerstein, A.H. |editor2=S. Halliwell |editor3=J. Henderson |editor4=B. Zimmerman |title=Tragedy, Comedy and the Polis |year=1993 |publisher=Levante Editori |location=Bari}}&lt;/ref&gt; Watching or reading satire has since ancient time been considered one of the best ways to understand a culture and a society.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes I: Clouds, Wasps, Birds'', Peter Meineck (translator) and Ian Storey (Introduction), Hackett Publishing 2000, page X&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emil J. Piscitelli (1993) [http://mysite.verizon.net/thelogos/lect-2.htm ''Before Socrates-Diotima''] ''The Special Case of Aristophanes: Tribal and Civil Justice''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Life of Aristophanes'', pp.42-seq&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 20th and 21st Centuries satire is found in an increasing number of media (in [[cartoon]]s as [[political cartoon]]s with heavy [[caricature]] and exaggeration, and in [[List of political magazines|political magazine]]s) and the parallel exposure of [[political scandal]]s to performances (including [[television]] shows). Examples include musicians such as [[Tom Lehrer]], live performance groups like the [[Capitol Steps]] and the [[Montana Logging and Ballet Co.]], and public television and live performer [[Mark Russell]]. Additional subgenres include such literary classics as ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' and ''[[Animal Farm]]'', and more recently, internet ''[[Ezine]]'' and website sources such as ''[[The Onion]]''.

==19th century==
===France===
One example is [[Maurice Joly]]'s 1864 pamphlet entitled ''[[The Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu]]'' (''Dialogue aux enfers entre Machiavel et Montesquieu''), which attacks the political ambitions of [[Napoleon III]]. It was first published in [[Brussels]] in 1864. The piece used the literary device of a [[dialogue]] between two diabolical plotters in [[Hell]], the historical characters of [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]] and [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]], to cover up a direct, and illegal, attack on Napoleon's rule.  The noble baron Montesquieu made the case for [[liberalism]]; the [[Florence|Florentine]] political writer Machiavelli presented the case for cynical [[despotism]]. In this manner, Joly communicated the secret ways in which liberalism might spawn a despot like Napoleon III. However, [[The Prince#Interpretation of The Prince as political satire|''The Prince'']] itself has also been sometimes understood as political satire.

===Germany===

According to [[George Santayana|Santayana]], Nietzsche was actually "a keen satirist".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophicalsociety.com/Archives/Santayana%27s%20Criticism%20of%20Nietzsche.htm#The%20Superman George Santayana : ''Egotism in German Philosophy''. 1915. chapter 13.]&lt;/ref&gt;
"Nietzsche's satire" was aimed at Lutheranism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1kRbO4M5CB0C&amp;pg=PA109&amp;lpg=PA109&amp;dq=Nietzsche+%22Lutheran+revivalist%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gniaAiHyMW&amp;sig=bx8O9CCvIvECzRJ3MPV81Nr-I2o&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=bFrSSYrzKorItgfV14zxBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result Christa Davis Acampora &amp; Ralph R. Acampora : ''A Nietzchean Bestiary''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2003. p. 109]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In UK media==
The UK has a long tradition of political satire, dating from the early years of English literature. In some readings, a number of [[William Shakespeare]]'s plays can be seen – or at least performed – as satire, including ''[[Richard III]]'' and ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]''. Later examples such as [[Jonathan Swift]]'s ''[[A Modest Proposal]]'' are more outright in their satirical nature.

In modern era, political satire in the [[United Kingdom]] includes pamphlets and newspaper articles, such as ''[[Private Eye]]'', topical television panel shows such as ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'', and television series such as ''[[Yes Minister]]'', ''[[House of Cards (UK TV series)|House of Cards]]'' and ''[[The Thick of It]]'' and ''[[ToryBoy The Movie]]''.

==On American television==
Satire became more visible on American television during the 1960s. Some of the early shows that used political satire include the British and American versions of the program ''[[That Was the Week That Was]]'' (airing on the [[American Broadcasting Company]], or ABC, in the U.S.), [[CBS]]'s ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'', and [[NBC]]'s ''[[Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In]]''. During the months leading up to the 1968 presidential election, [[Richard Nixon]] appeared on ''Laugh-In'' and repeated the program's catch-phrase "Sock it to me."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1wy49i-gQjIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=satire+tv&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=o7CaUfOdKu2j4APYpYCwBg&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAA Jonathan Gray, Jeffrey P. Jones &amp; Ethan Thompson : ''Satire TV: Politics and Comedy in the Post-Network Era''. New York University Press, 2009. p. 22]&lt;/ref&gt; Other forms of satire of the 1960s and early 1970s typically used the sitcom format, such as the show ''[[All in the Family]]''.

When ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' debuted in 1975, the show began to change the way that comedians would depict the president on television. [[Chevy Chase]] opened the fourth episode of the show with his impersonation of a bumbling [[Gerald Ford]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1wy49i-gQjIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=satire+tv&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=o7CaUfOdKu2j4APYpYCwBg&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAA Jeffrey P. Jones, "With All Due Respect: Satirizing Presidents from ''Saturday Night Live'' to ''Lil' Bush''", in Jonathan Gray, Jeffrey P. Jones &amp; Ethan Thompson : ''Satire TV: Politics and Comedy in the Post-Network Era''. New York University Press, 2009. p. 39-41]&lt;/ref&gt; Chase did not change his appearance to look like President Ford, and he portrayed the president by repeatedly falling down on the stage. Some of the other famous presidential impersonations on ''Saturday Night Live'' include [[Dan Aykroyd]]'s [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Jimmy Carter]] caricatures, [[Dana Carvey]] as [[George H. W. Bush]], [[Darrell Hammond]] as [[Bill Clinton]], [[Will Ferrell]] as [[George W. Bush]], and [[Jay Pharoah]] as [[Barack Obama]]. Hammond was the first cast member to impersonate [[Donald Trump]], but now [[Alec Baldwin]] portrays him.

During the 2008 presidential campaign, ''Saturday Night Live'' gained wide attention because former cast member [[Tina Fey]] returned to the show to satirize Republican Vice Presidential candidate [[Sarah Palin]]. In addition to Fey's striking physical resemblance to Palin, the impersonation of the vice presidential candidate was also noteworthy because of Fey's humorous use of some of exactly the same words Palin used in media interviews and campaign speeches as a way to perform political satire.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=b_Kaca5Fp-wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=entertaining+politics&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BryaUZqoKYb_4AOXtoDQBw&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA Jeffrey P. Jones, ''Entertaining Politics: Satiric Television and Political Engagement''. 2nd edition. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2010. p.4]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Saturday Night Live'' also uses political satire throughout its ''[[Weekend Update]]'' sketch. ''Weekend Update'' is a fake news segment on the show that satirizes politics and current events. It has been a part of ''SNL'' since the first episode of the show on October 11, 1975.

''[[The Daily Show]]'' and ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' use stylistic formats that are similar to ''Weekend Update''. On ''The Daily Show'', host [[Jon Stewart]] used footage from news programs to satirize politics and the news media. [[Stephen Colbert]] performed in character on ''The Colbert Report'' as a right-wing news pundit. Both hosts' television programs were broadcast on [[Comedy Central]], while ''The Daily Show'' continues to run featuring [[Trevor Noah|a new host]]. Colbert became the host of ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert|The Late Show]]'', succeeding David Letterman. With their shows, Stewart and Colbert helped increase public and academic discussion of the significance of political satire. ''[[Last Week Tonight with John Oliver]]'' and ''[[The Jim Jefferies Show]]'' are also examples of political commentary.

== Influence in politics ==

=== Contributions ===
According to the findings of the 2004 [[Pew Research Center|Pew Survey]], both younger and older audiences are turning to late-night comedy shows as not only a source of entertainment, but also for an opportunity to gain political awareness.&lt;ref name="Baym"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baym|first1=Geoffrey|title=The Daily Show: Discursive Integration and the Reinvention of Political Journalism|journal=Political Communication|volume=22|pages=259–276|doi=10.1080/10584600591006492|issn=1091-7675}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, Geoffrey Baym suggests that shows that make use of political satire, such as ''[[The Daily Show]]'', should be considered as a form of [[alternative media|alternative journalism]].&lt;ref name="Baym" /&gt; Utilizing satire has shown to be an attractive feature in news programming, drawing in the audiences of less politically engaged demographic cohorts. Moreover, satire news programming can be considered alternative because satire plays an important role in dissecting and critiquing  power.&lt;ref name="Baym" /&gt;

In his article ''The Daily Show: Discursive Integration and the Reinvention of Political Journalism'', Baym detailed how ''[[The Daily Show]]'', then hosted by [[Jon Stewart]], presented news stories. For the satire news show, presenting information in a comprehensive manner was used to give viewers a greater perspective of a situation.&lt;ref name="Baym" /&gt; Often, Stewart studded his segments with additional background information, or reminders of relevant and past details.&lt;ref name="Baym" /&gt; For example, ''[[The Daily Show]]'' displayed the full video of [[George W. Bush|Bush's]] comments regarding [[George Tenet|Tenet's]] resignation in 2004.&lt;ref name="Baym" /&gt; This was a deliberate choice by the show in attempt to give a more sincere representation of the event.&lt;ref name="Baym" /&gt; Moreover, it can be seen as a challenge and critique of what more traditional news shows failed to include.&lt;ref name="Baym" /&gt; In this way, satire news can be seen as more informative than other news sources. Notably, research findings released by [[National Annenberg Election Survey|National Annenberg Election Survey (NAES)]] concede that followers of satire news are more knowledgeable and consume more news than the general population.&lt;ref name="Baym" /&gt;

Meanwhile, Joseph Faina has considered the satire used in news shows as a facilitator in developing a [[Citizen journalism|public journalism]] practice.&lt;ref name="Faina" /&gt; Faina explains in his article that the nature of satire encourages viewers to become politically engaged, and a [[Citizen journalism|civic participant]], in which the humor exercised by hosts elicit responses in viewers.&lt;ref name="Faina" /&gt; However, Faina has acknowledged that this model is somewhat idealistic.&lt;ref name="Faina" /&gt; Nevertheless, Faina argues that the potential still exists.&lt;ref name="Faina" /&gt; Not to mention, with the rise in technology and the growing ubiquity of cellular phones, it can be argued that civic participation is all the more easier to accomplish.&lt;ref name="Fenton"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fenton|first1=Natalie|editor1-last=Allan|editor1-first=Stuart|title=News in the Digital Age|journal=The Routledge Companion to News and Journalism (1|date=October 2009|pages=557–567|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis e-Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Concerns ===
Though satire in news is celebrated as a vehicle toward a more informed public, such view is not universally shared among scholars.&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Young|first1=Dannagal G.|title=Lighten up: How satire will make American politics relevant again|url=http://archives.cjr.org/cover_story/lighten_up.php|website=Columbia Journalism Review|accessdate=April 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have expressed their hesitancy toward the infiltration of lighthearted practices to cover more dire topics like political affair.&lt;ref name="Young" /&gt; Potentially off-color remarks, or vulgar comments made by the likes of [[Stephen Colbert]] of ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]]'', or [[Samantha Bee]], host of ''[[Full Frontal with Samantha Bee]]'', can be used as examples of what critics are concerned over. Here, satire is believed to diminish the gravity of a topic.&lt;ref name="Faina"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Faina|first1=Joseph|title=Public journalism is a joke: The case for Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert|journal=Journalism|date=2012|volume=14|issue=4|pages=541 –555|doi=10.1177/1464884912448899}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baym proposes that as these shows are [[alternative media|alternative]], they have no obligation to "abide by standard practices".&lt;ref name="Baym" /&gt; Unlike traditional news sources, which may be required to adhere to certain agendas, like political affiliation or advertising restrictions, hosts of satire news shows are free and zealous to showcase personal contributions through their mentions of disdain, qualms, and excitement. Critics of satire in news shows thus believe that the showcasing of an overly and openly frustrated host will induce or perpetuate "cynicism in viewers".&lt;ref name="Young" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Faina" /&gt;

'''Rational emotive behavior therapy''' ('''REBT'''), previously called '''rational therapy''' and '''rational emotive therapy''', is an active-directive, [[philosophy|philosophically]] and [[empirical]]ly based [[psychotherapy]], the aim of which is to resolve [[emotion]]al and [[behavior]]al problems and disturbances and to help people to lead happier and more fulfilling lives.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, A. (1994) Reason and Emotion in Psychotherapy:  Comprehensive Method of Treating Human Disturbances : Revised and Updated. New York, NY: Citadel Press&lt;/ref&gt; REBT was created and developed by the [[United States|American]] [[psychotherapist]] and [[psychologist]] [[Albert Ellis]], who was inspired by many of the teachings of [[Asia]]n, [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and modern philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, A. (2004) Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy: It Works for Me—It Can Work for You. Amherst, NY: Prometheus Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McMahon, J., &amp;d Vernon, A. (2010) Albert Ellis: Evolution of a Revolution: Selections from the Writings of Albert Ellis, Ph.D. Fort Lee, NJ: Barricade Books.&lt;/ref&gt; REBT is the first form of [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) and was first expounded by Ellis in the mid-1950s; development continued until his death in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, A. (2007) All Out! An Autobiography. Amherst, NY: Prometheus Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Velten, E. (2010) Under the Influence: Reflections of Albert Ellis in the Work of Others. Tucson, AZ: See Sharp Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Velten, E. &amp; Penn, P. E. REBT for People With Co-occurring Problems: Albert Ellis in the Wilds of Arizona. Sarasota, FL: Professional Resource Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis became synonymous with the highly influential therapy. [[Psychology Today]] noted, "No individual — not even Freud himself — has had a greater impact on modern psychotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, R. (2001). "The Prince of Reason". Psychology Today.&lt;/ref&gt;


==History==
Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) is both a [[psychotherapy|psychotherapeutic]] system of theory and practices and a school of thought established by [[Albert Ellis (psychologist)|Albert Ellis]]. Ellis first presented his ideas at a conference of the American Psychological Association in 1956&lt;ref&gt;[ELLIS, A. Rational Psychotherapy. Paper read at Amer. Psychol. Ass. Chicago, August, 1956. Also J. gen. Psychol., in press]&lt;/ref&gt; then published a seminal article in 1957 entitled "Rational psychotherapy and individual psychology", in which he set the foundation for what he was calling Rational Therapy (RT) and carefully responded to questions from [[Rudolf Dreikurs]] and others about the similarities and differences with [[Alfred Adler]]'s [[Individual psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.all-about-psychology.com/rational-psychotherapy.html Rational Psychotherapy and Individual Psychology.] Ellis, Albert. 1957.  Journal of Individual Psychology 13: 38-44.&lt;/ref&gt; This was around a decade before psychiatrist [[Aaron Beck]] first set forth his "[[cognitive therapy]]", after Ellis had contacted him in the mid 1960s. Ellis' own approach was renamed to ''Rational Emotive Therapy'' in 1959, then to the current term in 1992.

Precursors of certain fundamental aspects of Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy have been identified in ancient philosophical traditions, particularly [[Stoicism]].&lt;ref name="Robertson_2010"&gt;{{Cite book | author=Robertson, D | title=The Philosophy of Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy: Stoicism as Rational and Cognitive Psychotherapy| year=2010| publisher=Karnac| location=London| isbn=978-1-85575-756-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XsOFyJaR5vEC&amp;lpg}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first major book on rational therapy, Ellis wrote that the central principle of his approach, that people are rarely emotionally affected by external events but rather by their thinking about such events, "was originally discovered and stated by the ancient Stoic philosophers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author=Ellis, A. | title=Reason and Emotion in Psychotherapy| year=1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis illustrates this with a quote from the [[Enchiridion of Epictetus|''Enchiridion'']] of [[Epictetus]]: "Men are disturbed not by things, but by the views which they take of them."  Ellis noted that [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] expressed a similar thought in ''[[Hamlet]]'': "There's nothing good or bad but thinking makes it so."&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Albert  (1962) Reason and Emotion in Psychotherapy. p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis also acknowledges early 20th century therapists, particularly [[Paul Charles Dubois]], though he only read his work several years after developing his therapy.&lt;ref name="Robertson_2010"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Theoretical assumptions &lt;!--This section is linked from [[Cognitive therapy]]: do not rename without including an anchor to previous name ([[MOS:HEAD]])--&gt; ==
{{See also|Cognitive therapy#Cognitive model}}
A fundamental premise of REBT is humans do not get emotionally disturbed by unfortunate circumstances, but by how they construct their views of these circumstances through their language, evaluative beliefs, meanings and philosophies about the world, themselves and others.&lt;ref name="ellis1"&gt;Ellis, Albert (2001). Overcoming Destructive Beliefs, Feelings, and Behaviors: New Directions for Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy. [[Prometheus Books]].&lt;/ref&gt; This concept has been attributed as far back as the Roman philosopher [[Epictetus]], who is often cited as utilizing similar ideas in antiquity.&lt;ref name="Robertson_2010"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getselfhelp.co.uk/epictetus.htm|title=Quotes for Therapy|author=|date=|website=www.getselfhelp.co.uk|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In REBT, clients usually learn and begin to apply this premise by learning the ''A-B-C''-''D-E-F'' model of [[psychological]] disturbance and change. The A-B-C model states that it is not an ''A'', ''a''dversity (or ''a''ctivating event) that cause disturbed and dysfunctional emotional and behavioral ''C''s, ''c''onsequences, but also what people ''B'', irrationally ''b''elieve about the ''A'', ''a''dversity. ''A'', ''a''dversity can be an external situation, or a thought, a feeling or other kind of internal event, and it can refer to an event in the past, present, or future.&lt;ref name="dryden1"&gt;Dryden W., &amp; Neenan M. (2003). Essential Rational Emotive Behaviour Therapy. Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

Where the following letters represent the following meanings in this model

A-	The adversity

B-	The developed belief in the person of the A Adversity

C-	The consequences but the consequences of that person's Beliefs ie B

D-	The person's disputes of A B and C. In latter thought.

E-	The effective new philosophy or belief that develops in that person through the occurrence of D in their minds of A and B

F-	The developed feelings of ones self either at point and after point C or at point after point E.


The ''B''s, irrational beliefs that are most important in the ''A-B-C'' model are explicit and implicit philosophical meanings and assumptions about events, personal desires, and preferences. The ''B''s, ''b''eliefs that are most significant are highly evaluative and consist of interrelated and integrated cognitive, emotional and behavioral aspects and dimensions. According to REBT, if a person's evaluative ''B'', ''b''elief about the ''A'', ''a''ctivating event is rigid, absolutistic, fictional and dysfunctional, the ''C'', the emotional and behavioral ''c''onsequence, is likely to be self-defeating and destructive. Alternatively, if a person's belief is preferential, flexible and constructive, the ''C'', the emotional and behavioral ''c''onsequence is likely to be self-helping and constructive.

Through REBT, by understanding the role of their mediating, evaluative and philosophically based illogical, unrealistic and self-defeating meanings, interpretations and assumptions in disturbance, individuals can learn to identify them, then go to ''D'', ''d''isputing and questioning the evidence for them. At ''E, e''ffective new philosophy, they can recognize and reinforce the notion no evidence exists for any psychopathological ''must'', ''ought'' or ''should'' and distinguish them from healthy constructs, and subscribe to more constructive and self-helping philosophies.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Albert. (1994). Reason and Emotion In Psychotherapy, Revised and Updated. Secaucus, NJ: Carol Publishing Group&lt;/ref&gt; This new reasonable perspective leads to ''F'', new ''f''eelings and behaviors appropriate to the ''A'' they are addressing in the exercise.

The REBT framework assumes that humans have both innate rational (meaning self-helping, socially helping, and constructive) and irrational (meaning self-defeating, socially defeating, and unhelpful) tendencies and leanings. REBT claims that people to a large degree consciously and unconsciously construct emotional difficulties such as [[self-blame]], [[self-pity]], clinical anger, hurt, guilt, shame, [[clinical depression|depression]] and [[anxiety]], and behaviors and behavior tendencies like [[procrastination]], compulsiveness, avoidance, [[Substance dependence|addiction]] and [[Social withdrawal|withdrawal]] by the means of their irrational and self-defeating thinking, [[emotion|emoting]] and behaving.&lt;ref name="ellis3"&gt;Ellis, A. (2001). Feeling better, getting better, staying better. Impact Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; REBT is then applied as an [[education]]al process in which the therapist often active-directively teaches the client how to identify irrational and self-defeating beliefs and philosophies which in nature are rigid, extreme, unrealistic, illogical and absolutist, and then to forcefully and actively question and dispute them and replace them with more rational and self-helping ones. By using different cognitive, emotive and behavioral [[Methodology|methods]] and activities, the client, together with help from the therapist and in [[Homework in psychotherapy|homework]] exercises, can gain a more rational, self-helping and constructive rational way of thinking, emoting and behaving. One of the main [[Goal|objective]]s in REBT is to show the client that whenever unpleasant and unfortunate activating events occur in people's lives, they have a [[choice]] of making themselves feel healthily and self-helpingly sorry, disappointed, frustrated, and annoyed, or making themselves feel unhealthily and self-defeatingly horrified, terrified, panicked, depressed, self-hating and self-pitying.&lt;ref name="ellis2"&gt;Ellis, Albert (2003). Early theories and practices of rational emotive behavior theory and how they have been augmented and revised during the last three decades. Journal of Rational-Emotive &amp; Cognitive-Behavior Therapy, 21(3/4)&lt;/ref&gt; By attaining and ingraining a more rational and self-constructive philosophy of themselves, others and the world, people often are more likely to behave and [[emotion|emote]] in more life-serving and adaptive ways.

Albert Ellis&lt;ref name="ellis2"/&gt; posits three major insights of REBT:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Insight 1''' – People seeing and accepting the reality that their emotional disturbances at point C are only partially caused by the activating events or adversities at point A that precede C. Although A contributes to C, and although disturbed Cs (such as feelings of [[panic]] and [[clinical depression|depression]]) are much more likely to follow strong negative As (such as being assaulted or raped), than they are to follow weak As (such as being disliked by a stranger), the main or more direct cores of extreme and dysfunctional emotional disturbances (Cs) are people’s irrational beliefs — the "absolutistic" (inflexible) "musts" and their accompanying inferences and attributions that people strongly believe about the activating event.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Insight 2''' – No matter how, when, and why people acquire self-defeating or irrational beliefs (i.e. beliefs that are the main cause of their dysfunctional emotional-behavioral consequences), if they are disturbed in the present, they tend to keep holding these irrational beliefs and continue upsetting themselves with these thoughts. They do so not because they held them in the past, but because they still actively hold them in the present (often unconsciously), while continuing to reaffirm their beliefs and act as if they are still valid. In their minds and hearts, the troubled people still follow the core "musturbatory" philosophies they adopted or invented long ago, or ones they recently accepted or constructed.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Insight 3''' – No matter how well they have gained insights 1 and 2, insight alone rarely enables people to undo their emotional disturbances. They may feel better when they know, or think they know, how they became disturbed, because insights can feel useful and curative. But it is unlikely that people will actually get better and stay better unless they have and apply insight 3, which is that ''there is usually no way to get better and stay better except by continual work and practice in looking for and finding one’s core irrational beliefs''; actively, energetically, and scientifically disputing them; replacing one’s absolute "musts" (rigid requirements about how things should be) with more flexible ''preferences''; changing one's unhealthy feelings to healthy, self-helping emotions; and firmly acting against one’s dysfunctional [[fears]] and [[compulsive behavior|compulsions]]. Only by a combined cognitive, emotive, and behavioral, as well as a quite persistent and forceful attack on one's serious emotional problems, is one likely to significantly ameliorate or remove them, and keep them removed.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Insight 4 – That in order for point D to occur in ones life often circumstances need to occur or transpire in order for the dispute in ones self and ones own emotions to happen. This way the dispute is reinforced by actions taken by the self if the action is strong enough. However if this is not executed by others with the person in affect not aware of what is going on the situation could become dangerous or life threatening by the person being treated.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Regarding cognitive-affective-behavioral [[cognitive processes|process]]es in mental functioning and dysfunctioning, originator Albert Ellis explains:&lt;ref name="ellis2"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"REBT assumes that human thinking, emotion, and action are not really separate or disparate processes, but that they all significantly overlap and are rarely experienced in a pure state. Much of what we call emotion is nothing more nor less than a certain kind — a biased, prejudiced, or strongly evaluative kind — of thought. But emotions and behaviors significantly influence and affect thinking, just as thinking influences emotions and behaviors. Evaluating is a fundamental characteristic of human [[organisms]] and seems to work in a kind of closed [[Electronic circuit|circuit]] with a [[feedback mechanism]]: First, [[perception]] [[bias]]es response, and then response tends to bias subsequent perception. Also, prior perceptions appear to bias subsequent [[perception]]s, and prior responses appear to bias subsequent responses. What we call feelings almost always have a pronounced evaluating or appraisal element."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

REBT then generally proposes that many of these self-defeating cognitive, emotive and behavioral tendencies are both innately [[biology|biological]] and [[indoctrination|indoctrinated]] early in and during life, and further grow stronger as a person continually revisits, clings and acts on them. Ellis alludes to similarities between REBT and the [[general semantics]] when explaining the role of irrational beliefs in self-defeating tendencies, citing [[Alfred Korzybski]] as a significant modern influence on this thinking.&lt;ref&gt;"REBT particularly follows Korzybski in this respect..." Albert Ellis in ''The Albert Ellis reader: A guide to well-being using rational emotive behavior therapy'', p. 306. [https://books.google.com/books?id=LorJYkPSQOwC&amp;vq Google Books preview] retrieved August 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

REBT differs from other clinical approaches like [[psychoanalysis]] in that it places little emphasis on exploring the past, but instead focuses on changing the current evaluations and philosophical thinking-emoting and behaving in relation to themselves, others and the conditions under which people live.

== Psychological dysfunction ==
One of the main pillars of REBT is that irrational and dysfunctional ways and patterns of thinking, feeling and behaving are contributing to much, though hardly all, human disturbance and emotional and behavioral self-defeatism and social defeatism. REBT generally teaches that when people turn flexible preferences, desires and wishes into grandiose, absolutistic and fatalistic dictates, this tends to contribute to disturbance and upset. These dysfunctional patterns are examples of [[cognitive distortions]].

===Core beliefs that disturb humans===
Albert Ellis has suggested three core beliefs or philosophies that humans tend to disturb themselves through:&lt;ref name="ellis2"/&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| ''"I absolutely MUST, under practically all conditions and at all times, perform well (or outstandingly well) and win the approval (or complete love) of significant others. If I fail in these important—and sacred—respects, that is awful and I am a bad, incompetent, unworthy person, who will probably always fail and deserves to suffer."''
| ''"Other people with whom I relate or associate, absolutely MUST, under practically all conditions and at all times, treat me nicely, considerately and fairly. Otherwise, it is terrible and they are rotten, bad, unworthy people who will always treat me badly and do not deserve a good life and should be severely punished for acting so abominably to me."''
| ''"The conditions under which I live absolutely MUST, at practically all times, be favorable, safe, hassle-free, and quickly and easily enjoyable, and if they are not that way it's awful and horrible and I can't bear it. I can't ever enjoy myself at all. My life is impossible and hardly worth living."''
|-
| Holding this belief when faced with adversity tends to contribute to feelings of [[anxiety]], [[panic]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[Despair (emotion)|despair]], and worthlessness.
| Holding this belief when faced with adversity tends to contribute to feelings of anger, rage, fury, and vindictiveness.
| Holding this belief when faced with adversity tends to contribute to [[frustration]] and discomfort, [[Toleration|intolerance]], self-pity, [[anger]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and to behaviors such as [[procrastination]], [[avoidance coping|avoidance]], addictive behaviors and inaction.
|}

===Rigid demands that humans make===
REBT commonly posits that at the core of irrational beliefs there often are explicit or implicit rigid demands and commands, and that extreme [[derivative]]s like awfulizing, frustration [[Toleration|intolerance]], people [[deprecation]] and over-generalizations are accompanied by these.&lt;ref name="dryden1"/&gt; According to REBT the core dysfunctional philosophies in a person's evaluative emotional and behavioral belief system, are also very likely to contribute to unrealistic, arbitrary and crooked inferences and distortions in thinking. REBT therefore first teaches that when people in an insensible and devout way overuse absolutistic, [[dogma]]tic and rigid "shoulds", "musts", and "oughts", they tend to disturb and upset themselves.

===Over-generalization===
Further REBT generally posits that disturbed evaluations to a large degree occur through over-generalization, wherein people exaggerate and globalize events or traits, usually unwanted events or traits or behavior, out of context, while almost always ignoring the positive events or traits or behaviors. For example, awfulizing is partly [[mind|mental]] [[magnification]] of the importance of an unwanted situation to a [[Disaster|catastrophe]] or [[Horror and terror|horror]], elevating the rating of something from bad to worse than it should be, to beyond totally bad, worse than bad to the intolerable and to a "[[holocaust]]". The same exaggeration and overgeneralizing occurs with human rating, wherein humans come to be arbitrarily and [[axiom]]atically [[definition|defined]] by their [[perceive]]d flaws or misdeeds. Frustration intolerance then occurs when a person perceives something to be too difficult, painful or tedious, and by doing so exaggerates these qualities beyond one's ability to cope with them.

===Secondary disturbances===
Essential to REBT theory is also the concept of secondary disturbances which people sometimes construct on top of their primary disturbance. As Ellis emphasizes:&lt;ref name="ellis2"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"''Because of their self-consciousness and their ability to think about their thinking, they can very easily disturb themselves about their disturbances and can also disturb themselves about their ineffective attempts to overcome their emotional disturbances.''"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Mental wellness ==
As would be expected, REBT argues that [[mind|mental]] wellness and [[mental health]] to a large degree results from an adequate amount of self-helping, flexible, logico-empirical ways of thinking, emoting and behaving.&lt;ref name="ellis3"/&gt; When a perceived undesired and stressful activating event occurs, and the individual is interpreting, evaluating and reacting to the situation rationally and self-helpingly, then the resulting consequence is, according to REBT, likely to be more healthy, constructive and functional. This does not by any means mean that a relatively un-disturbed person never experiences negative feelings, but REBT does hope to keep debilitating and un-healthy emotions and subsequent self-defeating behavior to a minimum. To do this, REBT generally promotes a flexible, un-dogmatic, self-helping and efficient belief system and constructive life philosophy about adversities and human desires and preferences.

REBT clearly acknowledges that people, in addition to disturbing themselves, also are innately [[Constructivism (psychological school)|constructivists]]. Because they largely upset themselves with their beliefs, emotions and behaviors, they can be helped to, in a [[multimodal therapy|multimodal]] manner, dispute and question these and develop a more workable, more self-helping set of constructs.

REBT generally teaches and promotes:
* That the concepts and philosophies of life of unconditional self-acceptance, other-acceptance, and life-acceptance are effective philosophies of life in achieving mental wellness and [[mental health]].
* That human beings are inherently fallible and imperfect and that they are better served by accepting their and other human being's totality and humanity, while at the same time they may not like some of their behaviors and characteristics. That they are better off not measuring their entire self or their "being" and give up the narrow, grandiose and ultimately destructive notion to give themselves any global rating or report card. This is partly because all humans are continually evolving and are far too complex to accurately rate; all humans do both self-defeating / socially defeating and self-helping / socially helping deeds, and have both beneficial and un-beneficial attributes and traits at certain times and in certain conditions. REBT holds that [[idea]]s and feelings about self-worth are largely definitional and are not empirically confirmable or [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]].
* That people had better accept life with its hassles and difficulties not always in accordance with their wants, while trying to change what they can change and live as elegantly as possible with what they cannot change.

==REBT intervention==
As explained, REBT is a therapeutic system of both theory and practice; generally one of the goals of REBT is to help clients see the ways in which they have learned how they often needlessly upset themselves, teach them how to "un-upset" themselves and then how to [[empowerment|empower]] themselves to lead happier and more fulfilling lives.&lt;ref name="ellis1"/&gt; The emphasis in therapy is generally to establish a successful collaborative therapeutic working alliance based on the REBT educational model. Although REBT teaches that the therapist or counsellor is better served by demonstrating unconditional other-acceptance or unconditional positive regard, the therapist is not necessarily always encouraged to build a warm and caring relationship with the client. The tasks of the therapist or counselor include understanding the client’s concerns from his point of reference and work as a facilitator, teacher and encourager.

In traditional REBT, the client together with the therapist, in a structured active-directive manner, often work through a set of target problems and establish a set of therapeutic goals. In these target problems, situational dysfunctional emotions, behaviors and beliefs are [[Psychological assessment|assessed]] in regards to the client's [[Value (personal and cultural)|value]]s and [[goal]]s. After working through these problems, the client learns to generalize insights to other relevant situations. In many cases after going through a client's different target problems, the therapist is interested in examining possible core beliefs and more deep rooted philosophical evaluations and schemas that might account for a wider array of problematic emotions and behaviors.&lt;ref name="dryden1"/&gt; Although REBT much of the time is used as a brief therapy, in deeper and more complex problems, longer therapy is promoted.

In therapy, the first step often is that the client acknowledges the problems, accepts emotional responsibility for these and has willingness and determination to change. This normally requires a considerable amount of insight, but as originator [[Albert Ellis (psychologist)|Albert Ellis]]&lt;ref name="ellis2"/&gt; explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Humans, unlike just about all the other animals on earth, create fairly sophisticated [[languages]] which not only enable them to think about their feeling, their actions, and the results they get from doing and not doing certain things, but they also are able to think about their thinking and even [[metacognition|think about thinking about their thinking]]."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Through the therapeutic process, REBT employs a wide array of forceful and active, meaning [[multimodal therapy|multimodal]] and disputing, [[methodology|methodologies]]. Central through these methods and techniques is the intent to help the client challenge, dispute and question their destructive and self-defeating cognitions, emotions and behaviors. The methods and techniques incorporate cognitive-philosophic, emotive-evocative-dramatic, and behavioral methods for disputation of the client's irrational and self-defeating constructs and helps the client come up with more rational and self-constructive ones. REBT seeks to acknowledge that understanding and insight are not enough; in order for clients to significantly change, they need to pinpoint their irrational and self-defeating [[Philosophy of artificial intelligence|constructs]] and work forcefully and actively at changing them to more functional and self-helping ones.

REBT posits that the client must work hard to get better, and in therapy this normally includes a wide array of homework exercises in day-to-day life assigned by the therapist. The [[assignment (education)|assignment]]s may for example include [[desensitization (psychology)|desensitization]] tasks, i.e., by having the client confront the very thing he or she is afraid of. By doing so, the client is actively acting against the belief that often is contributing significantly to the disturbance.

Another factor contributing to the brevity of REBT is that the therapist seeks to empower the client to help himself through future adversities. REBT only promotes temporary solutions if more fundamental solutions are not found. An ideal successful [[collaboration]] between the REBT therapist and a client results in changes to the client's philosophical way of evaluating himself or herself, others, and his or her life, which will likely yield effective results. The client then moves toward unconditional self-acceptance, other-acceptance and life-acceptance while striving to live a more self-fulfilling and happier life.

== Efficacy ==
REBT and CBT in general have a substantial and strong [[research]] base to verify and support both their psychotherapeutic efficiency and their theoretical underpinnings. A great quantity of scientific empirical studies has proven REBT to be an effective and efficient treatment for many kinds of psychopathology, conditions and problems.&lt;ref name="ellis2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, L. C., &amp; Woods, P. J. (1991). The efficacy of rational-emotive therapy: A quantitative review of the outcome research. Clinical Psychology Review, 11, 357–369.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="feltham"&gt;Colin Feltham (ed) (1997). Which Psychotherapy?: Leading Exponents Explain Their Differences. SAGE, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cooper M. (2008). Essential Research Findings in Counselling and Psychotherapy. Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; A vast amount of outcome and experimental studies support the effectiveness of REBT and CBT.&lt;ref&gt;Philosophy in Psychotherapy: [http://www.intuition.org/txt/ellis.htm Albert Ellis interview by Jeffrey Mishlove]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Psychotherapy.net: [http://www.psychotherapy.net/interview/Albert_Ellis Albert Ellis Behavioral Therapy Interview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225020622/http://www.psychotherapy.net/interview/Albert_Ellis |date=2008-12-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, REBT randomized clinical trials have offered a positive view on the efficacy of REBT.&lt;ref name="david"&gt;David D. et al. (2005). A synopsis of rational-emotive behavior therapy: Fundamental and applied research. Journal of rational-emotive and cognitive-behavior therapy 2005, vol. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

In general REBT is arguably one of the most investigated [[theory|theories]] in the field of psychotherapy and a large amount of clinical experience and a substantial body of modern psychological research have validated and substantiated many of REBTs theoretical assumptions on [[Personality psychology|personality]] and psychotherapy.&lt;ref name="feltham"/&gt;&lt;ref name="david"/&gt;&lt;ref name="abrams"&gt;Ellis A., Abrams M. &amp; Abrams L. (2008). Theories of Personality. Sage Press&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations and critique ==
{{See also|Cognitive behavioral therapy#Criticisms|Psychotherapy#General critiques}}
The clinical research on REBT has been criticized both from within and by others. For instance, originator [[Albert Ellis (psychologist)|Albert Ellis]] has on occasions emphasized the difficulty and complexity of measuring psychotherapeutic effectiveness, because many studies only tend to [[Psychometrics|measure]] whether clients merely feel better after therapy instead of them getting better and staying better.&lt;ref name="ellis3"/&gt; Ellis has also criticized studies for having limited focus primarily to [[cognitive restructuring]] aspects, as opposed to the combination of cognitive, emotive and behavioral aspects of REBT.&lt;ref name="feltham"/&gt; As REBT has been subject to criticisms during its existence, especially in its early years, REBT theorists have a long history of publishing and addressing those concerns. It has also been argued by Ellis and by other clinicians that REBT theory on numerous occasions has been misunderstood and misconstrued both in research and in general.&lt;ref name="david"/&gt;

Some have criticized REBT for being harsh, formulaic and failing to address deep underlying problems.&lt;ref name="abrams"/&gt; REBT theorists have argued in reply that a careful study of REBT shows that it is both philosophically deep, humanistic and individualized collaboratively working on the basis of the client’s point of reference.&lt;ref name="ellis1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="abrams"/&gt; They have further argued that REBT utilizes an integrated and interrelated methodology of cognitive, emotive-experiential and behavioral interventions.&lt;ref name="ellis1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="feltham"/&gt; Others have questioned REBTs view of rationality, both radical constructivists who have claimed that reason and logic are subjective properties and those who believe that reason can be objectively determined.&lt;ref name="abrams"/&gt; REBT theorists have argued in reply that REBT raises objections to clients' irrational choices and conclusions as a working hypothesis and through collaborative efforts demonstrate the irrationality on practical, functional and social consensual grounds.&lt;ref name="ellis2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="abrams"/&gt; In 1998 when asked what the main criticism on REBT was, Albert Ellis replied that it was the claim that it was too rational and not dealing sufficiently enough with emotions. He repudiated the claim by saying that REBT on the contrary emphasizes that thinking, feeling, and behaving are interrelated and integrated, and that it includes a vast amount of both emotional and behavioural methods in addition to cognitive ones.&lt;ref&gt;Ask Dr. Ellis Achieve (1996–2001). Albert Ellis Institute&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellis has himself in very direct terms criticized opposing approaches such as [[psychoanalysis]], [[transpersonal psychology]] and abreactive psychotherapies in addition to on several occasions questioning some of the [[doctrine]]s in certain religious systems, [[spiritualism]] and [[mysticism]]. Many, including REBT practitioners, have warned against [[dogma]]tizing and sanctifying REBT as a supposedly perfect psychological [[panacea]]. Prominent REBTers have promoted the importance of high quality and programmatic research, including originator Ellis, a self-proclaimed "passionate skeptic". He has on many occasions been open to challenges and acknowledged errors and inefficiencies in his approach and concurrently revised his theories and practices.&lt;ref name="ellis2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="abrams"/&gt; In general, with regard to cognitive-behavioral psychotherapies' [[Intervention (counseling)|intervention]]s, others have pointed out that as about 30–40% of people are still unresponsive to interventions, that REBT could be a platform of reinvigorating empirical studies on the effectiveness of the cognitive-behavioral models of psychopathology and human functioning.&lt;ref name="david"/&gt;

REBT has been developed, revised and augmented through the years as understanding and knowledge of psychology and psychotherapy have progressed. This includes its theoretical concepts, practices and methodology. The teaching of scientific thinking, reasonableness and [[Dogma|un-dogmatism]] has been inherent in REBT as an approach, and these ways of thinking are an inextricable part of REBT's [[empiricism|empirical]] and [[skepticism|skeptical]] nature.

==Applications and interfaces==
Applications and interfaces of REBT are used with a broad range of clinical problems in traditional psychotherapeutic settings such as individual-, [[Group psychotherapy|group]]- and [[family therapy]]. It is used as a general treatment for a vast number of different conditions and psychological problems normally associated with [[psychotherapy]].

In addition, REBT is used with non-clinical problems and problems of living through [[counselling]], consultation and coaching settings dealing with problems including relationships, social skills, career changes, [[stress management]], assertiveness training, grief, problems with aging, money, weight control etc.

REBT also has many interfaces and applications through self-help resources, phone and internet counseling, workshops &amp; seminars, workplace and educational programmes, etc. This includes Rational Emotive Education (REE) where REBT is applied in education settings, Rational Effectiveness Training in business and work-settings and [[SMART Recovery]] (Self Management And Recovery Training) in supporting those in addiction recovery, in addition to a wide variety of specialized treatment strategies and applications.

'''Reproducibility''' is the closeness of the agreement between the results of [[measurements]] of the same [[:wikt:measurand|measurand]] carried out with same methodology described in the corresponding scientific evidence (e.g. a publication in a peer-reviewed journal). Reproducibilty can also be applied under changed conditions of measurement for the same [[:wikt:measurand|measurand]] to check, that the results are not an artefact of the measurment procedures.&lt;ref name=GUM&gt;{{Citation

The values obtained from distinct experimental trials are said to be ''commensurate'' if they are obtained according to the same reproducible experimental description and procedure. The basic idea can be seen in [[Aristotle]]'s dictum that there is no scientific knowledge of the [[singleton (mathematics)|individual]], where the word used for ''individual'' in Greek had the connotation of the ''idiosyncratic'', or wholly isolated occurrence. Thus all knowledge, all science, necessarily involves the formation of general concepts and the invocation of their corresponding symbols in language (cf. Turner). Aristotle′s conception about the knowledge of the individual being considered unscientific is due to lack of the field of [[statistics]] in his time, so he could not appeal to statistical averaging by the individual.

A particular experimentally obtained value is said to be reproducible if there is a high degree of agreement between [[measurements]] or observations conducted on [[Replication (statistics)|replicate]] specimens in different locations by different people—that is, if the experimental value is found to have a high [[Accuracy and precision|precision]].&lt;ref name="ASTM E177"&gt;{{Citation|url = http://www.astm.org/Standards/E177.htm|title = Standard Practice for Use of the Terms Precision and Bias in ASTM Test Methods|year = 2014|author = Subcommittee E11.20 on Test Method Evaluation and Quality Control|publisher = ASTM International|id = ASTM E177}}{{Paywall}}
&lt;/ref&gt; However, in science, a very well reproduced result is one that can be confirmed using as many ''different'' experimental setups as possible and as many lines of evidence as possible ([[consilience]]).

==History==
[[File:Boyle air pump.jpg|thumb|right|Boyle's air pump was, in terms of the 17th Century, a complicated and expensive scientific apparatus, making reproducibility of results difficult]]
The first to stress the importance of reproducibility in science was the Irish chemist [[Robert Boyle]], in England in the 17th century. Boyle's [[air pump]] was designed to generate and study [[vacuum]], which at the time was a very controversial concept. Indeed, distinguished philosophers such as [[René Descartes]] and [[Thomas Hobbes]] denied the very possibility of vacuum existence. [[History of science|Historians of science]] e.g. [[Steven Shapin]] and [[Simon Schaffer]], in their 1985 book ''[[Leviathan and the Air-Pump]]'', describe the debate between Boyle and Hobbes, ostensibly over the nature of vacuum, as fundamentally an argument about how useful knowledge should be gained. Boyle, a pioneer of the [[experimental method]], maintained that the foundations of knowledge should be constituted by experimentally produced facts, which can be made believable to a scientific community by their reproducibility. By repeating the same experiment over and over again, Boyle argued, the certainty of fact will emerge.

The air pump, which in the 17th century was a complicated and expensive apparatus to build, also led to one of the first documented disputes over the reproducibility of a particular scientific phenomenon. In the 1660s, the Dutch scientist [[Christiaan Huygens]] built his own air pump in [[Amsterdam]], the first one outside the direct management of Boyle and his assistant at the time [[Robert Hooke]]. Huygens reported an effect he termed "anomalous suspension", in which water appeared to levitate in a glass jar inside his air pump (in fact suspended over an air bubble), but Boyle and Hooke could not replicate this phenomenon in their own pumps. As Shapin and Schaffer describe, “it became clear that unless the phenomenon could be produced in England with one of the two pumps available, then no one in England would accept the claims Huygens had made, or his competence in working the pump”. Huygens was finally invited to England in 1663, and under his personal guidance Hooke was able to replicate anomalous suspension of water. Following this Huygens was elected a Foreign Member of the [[Royal Society]]. However, Shapin and Schaffer also note that “the accomplishment of replication was dependent on contingent acts of judgment. One cannot write down a formula saying when replication was or was not achieved”.&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Shapin]] and [[Simon Schaffer]], ''[[Leviathan and the Air-Pump]]'', Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] [[Karl Popper]] noted briefly in his famous 1934 book ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'' that “non-reproducible single occurrences are of no significance to science”.&lt;ref&gt;This citation is from the 1959 translation to English, [[Karl Popper]], ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'', Routledge, London, 1992, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Statistics|Statistician]] [[Ronald Fisher]] wrote in his 1935 book ''[[The Design of Experiments]]'', which set the foundations for the modern scientific practice of [[hypothesis testing]] and [[statistical significance]], that “we may say that a phenomenon is experimentally demonstrable when we know how to conduct an experiment which will rarely fail to give us statistically significant results”.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald Fisher]], ''[[The Design of Experiments]]'', (1971) [1935](9th ed.), Macmillan, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Such assertions express a common [[dogma]] in modern science that reproducibility is a necessary condition (although not necessarily [[Necessity and sufficiency|sufficient]]) for establishing a scientific fact, and in practice for establishing scientific authority in any field of knowledge. However, as noted above by Shapin and Schaffer, this dogma is not well-formulated quantitatively, such as statistical significance for instance, and therefore it is not explicitly established how many times must a fact be replicated to be considered reproducible.

==Reproducible data==

Reproducibility is one component of the precision of a measurement or test method.  The other component is [[repeatability]] which is the degree of agreement of tests or measurements on replicate specimens by the same observer in the same laboratory.  Both repeatability and reproducibility are usually reported as a [[standard deviation]].  A reproducibility limit is the value below which the difference between two test results obtained under reproducibility conditions may be expected to occur with a probability of approximately 0.95 (95%).&lt;ref name="ASTM E177"/&gt;

Reproducibility is determined from controlled interlaboratory test programs or a [[measurement systems analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;ASTM E691  Standard Practice for Conducting an Interlaboratory Study to Determine the Precision of a Test Method&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ASTM F1469  Standard Guide for Conducting a Repeatability and Reproducibility Study on Test Equipment for Nondestructive Testing&lt;/ref&gt;

Although they are often confused, there is an important distinction between replicates and an independent repetition of an experiment. Replicates are performed within an experiment. They are not and cannot provide independent evidence of reproducibility. Rather they serve as an internal "check" on an experiment and should not be shown as part of the experimental results within a scientific publication. It is the independent repetition of an experiment that serves to underpin its reproducibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vaux | first1 = D.

Psychology has seen a renewal of internal concerns about irreproducible results. Researchers showed in a 2006 study that, of 141 authors of a publication from the American Psychology Association (APA) empirical articles, 103 (73%) did not respond with their data over a 6-month period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wicherts | first1 = J.

Fewer than half of the attempted replications were successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Open Science Collaboration | title = Estimating the reproducibility of Psychological Science | doi = 10.1126/science.aac4716 | journal = Science | volume = 349 | issue = 6251 | pages = aac4716 | year = 2015 | pmid=26315443}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been initiatives to improve reporting and hence reproducibility in the medical literature for many years, which began with the [[Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials|CONSORT]] initiative, which is now part of a wider initiative, the [[EQUATOR Network]]. This group has recently turned its attention to how better reporting might reduce waste in research,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Research Waste/EQUATOR Conference {{!}} Research Waste|url = http://researchwaste.net/research-wasteequator-conference/|website = researchwaste.net|accessdate = 2015-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially biomedical research.

Reproducible research is key to new discoveries in [[pharmacology]]. A Phase I discovery will be followed by Phase II reproductions as a drug develops towards commercial production. In recent decades Phase II success has fallen from 28% to 18%. A 2011 study found that 65% of medical studies were inconsistent when re-tested, and only 6% were completely reproducible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Prinz | first1 = F. | last2 = Schlange | first2 = T. | last3 = Asadullah | first3 = K. | doi = 10.1038/nrd3439-c1 | title = Believe it or not: How much can we rely on published data on potential drug targets? | journal = Nature Reviews Drug Discovery | volume = 10 | issue = 9 | pages = 712 | year = 2011 | pmid =  21892149| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, a study by Begley and Ellis was published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' that reviewed a decade of research. That study found that 47 out of 53 medical research papers focused on cancer research were irreproducible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Begley | first1 = C. G. | last2 = Ellis | first2 = L.

A. Ioannidis]] writes, "While currently there is unilateral emphasis on 'first' discoveries, there should be as much emphasis on replication of discoveries."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/3342867/Is-the-spirit-of-Piltdown-man-alive-and-well.html Is the spirit of Piltdown man alive and well?]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Nature'' study was itself reproduced in the journal ''[[PLOS ONE]]'', which confirmed that a majority of cancer researchers surveyed had been unable to reproduce a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mobley | first1 = A. | last2 = Linder | first2 = S.

In 2016, ''Nature'' conducted a survey of 1,576 researchers who took a brief online questionnaire on reproducibility in research. According to the survey, more than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist's experiments, and more than half have failed to reproduce their own experiments. "Although 52% of those surveyed agree there is a significant 'crisis' of reproducibility, less than 31% think failure to reproduce published results means the result is probably wrong, and most say they still trust the published literature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baker | first1 = Monya | year = | title =  1,500 scientists lift the lid on reproducibility| url = | journal = Nature | volume = 533 | issue = | pages = 452–454 | doi = 10.1038/533452a | bibcode = 2016Natur.533..452B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Noteworthy irreproducible results==
[[Hideyo Noguchi]] became famous for correctly identifying the bacterial agent of [[syphilis]], but also claimed that he could culture this agent in his laboratory. Nobody else has been able to produce this latter result.{{citation needed|reason=Needs to be verifiable, otherwise it is anecdotal. Wild claims need citations. |date=August 2015}}

In March 1989, [[University of Utah]] chemists Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann reported the production of excess heat that could only be explained by a nuclear process ("[[cold fusion]]"). The report was astounding given the simplicity of the equipment: it was essentially an [[electrolysis]] cell containing [[heavy water]] and a [[palladium]] [[cathode]] which rapidly absorbed the [[deuterium]] produced during electrolysis. The news media reported on the experiments widely, and it was a front-page item on many newspapers around the world (see [[science by press conference]]). Over the next several months others tried to replicate the experiment, but were unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Physicists Debunk Claim Of a New Kind of Fusion|newspaper=New York Times|last=Browne|first=Malcolm|url=http://partners.nytimes.com/library/national/science/050399sci-cold-fusion.html|date=3 May 1989|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nikola Tesla]] claimed as early as 1899 to have used a high frequency current to light gas-filled lamps from over {{convert|25|mi|km}} away [[Wireless energy transfer|without using wires]]. In 1904 he built [[Wardenclyffe Tower]] on [[Shoreham, New York|Long Island]] to demonstrate means to send and receive power without connecting wires. The facility was never fully operational and was not completed due to economic problems, so no attempt to reproduce his first result was ever carried out.&lt;ref&gt;Cheney, Margaret (1999), ''Tesla Master of Lightning'', New York: Barnes &amp; Noble Books,  {{ISBN|0-7607-1005-8}}, pp. 107.; "Unable to overcome his financial burdens, he was forced to close the laboratory in 1905."&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples which contrary evidence has refuted the original claim:
* [[Stimulus-triggered acquisition of pluripotency]], revealed to be the result of fraud
* [[GFAJ-1]], a bacterium that could purportedly incorporate [[arsenic biochemistry|arsenic]] into its DNA in place of phosphorus
* [[MMR vaccine controversy]] – a study in ''[[The Lancet]]'' claiming the MMR vaccine caused autism was revealed to be fraudulent
* [[Schön scandal]] – semiconductor "breakthroughs" revealed to be fraudulent
* [[Power posing]] – a [[social psychology]] phenomenon that went viral after being the subject of a very popular [[TED talk]], but was unable to be replicated in dozens of studies&lt;ref name="NYT_2017_Cuddy"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/magazine/when-the-revolution-came-for-amy-cuddy.html |title=When the Revolution Came for Amy Cuddy |first=Susan |last=Dominus |date=October 18, 2017 |work=New York Times Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stochastic processes==
The reproducibility requirement cannot be applied to individual samples of phenomena which have a partially or totally non-deterministic nature.  However, it still applies to the probabilistic description of such phenomena, with error tolerance given by probability theory.

'''Scratching''', sometimes referred to as '''scrubbing''', is a [[DJ]] and [[Turntablism|turntablist]] technique of moving a [[vinyl record]] back and forth on a [[phonograph|turntable]] to produce percussive or rhythmic sounds. A [[crossfader]] on a [[DJ mixer]] may be used to fade between two records simultaneously. 

While scratching is most associated with [[hip hop music]], where it emerged in the mid-1970s, from the 1990s it has been used in some styles of [[rap rock]], [[rap metal]] and [[nu metal]]. Within [[hip hop]] culture, scratching is one of the measures of a DJ's skills. DJs compete in scratching competitions at the [[DMC World DJ Championship]] and IDA (International DJ Association, formerly known as ITF (International [[Turntablism|Turntablist]] Federation). At scratching competitions, DJs can use only scratch-oriented gear (turntables, DJ mixer, digital vinyl systems or vinyl records only). In recorded hip hop songs, scratched [[Hook (music)|"hooks"]] often use portions of other songs.

==History==
===Precursors===
A rudimentary form of turntable manipulation which is related to scratching was developed in the late 1940s radio DJs (music program hosts) or the radio program producers who did their own technical operation as [[audio console]] operators. It was known as back-cueing, and was used to find the [[cue (audio)|very beginning of the start of a song]] (i.e., the cue point) on a vinyl record groove. This was done to permit the operator to back the disc up (rotate the record or the turntable platter itself counter-clockwise) in order to permit the turntable to be switched on, and come up to full speed without ruining the first few bars of music with the "wow" of incorrect, unnaturally slow-speed playing. This permitted the announcer to time her or his remarks and start the turntable a scant moment before she or he actually wanted the music on the record to begin.

Back cueing was a basic skill that all radio production staff needed to learn, and the dynamics of it were unique to the brand of professional turntable in use at a given radio station. The older, larger and heavier turntables needed a 180 degree backward rotation to allow for run up to full speed; some of the newer 1950s models used aluminum platters and cloth-backed rubber mats which required a third of a rotational turn or less to achieve full speed when the song began. All this was done in order to present a music show on air with the least amount of silence ("dead air") between music, the announcer's patter and recorded advertising commercials. The rationale was that any "dead air" on a radio station was likely to prompt a listener to switch stations, so announcers and program directors instructed DJs and announcers to provide a continuous, seamless stream of sound–from music to an announcer to a pre-recorded commercial, to a "jingle" (radio station theme song), and then immediately back to more music.

Back-cueing was a key function in delivering this seamless stream of music. Radio personnel demanded robust equipment and manufacturers developed special tonearms, styli, cartridges and lightweight turntables to meet these demands.

[[File:DJ Grand Wizzard Theodore (right), inventor of vinyl record scratching technique.jpg|thumb|In the early 1970s in the South Bronx, a young teen DJ named "Grand Wizzard Theodore" (right) invented the "DJ scratch" technique. Other DJs, like Grandmaster Flash, took the technique to higher levels.]]

Modern scratching techniques were made possible by the invention of  [[direct-drive turntable]]s, which led to the emergence of [[turntablism]]. Early [[belt-drive turntable]]s were unsuitable for scratching, since they had a slow start-up time, and they were prone to wear-and-tear and breakage,&lt;ref name="medium"&gt;Brian Coleman, [https://medium.com/@briancoleman/the-technics-1200-hammer-of-the-gods-xxl-fall-1998-5b93180a67da The Technics 1200 — Hammer Of The Gods], [[Medium (website)|Medium]]&lt;/ref&gt; as the belt would break from backspinning or scratching.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LApZ8KV7bZAC&amp;pg=PA43 ''The World of DJs and the Turntable Culture'', page 43], [[Hal Leonard Corporation]], 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The first direct-drive turntable was invented by Shuichi Obata, an engineer at [[Panasonic|Matsushita]] (now [[Panasonic]]),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', May 21, 1977, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XCMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT140 page 140]&lt;/ref&gt; based in [[Osaka]], [[Japan]].&lt;ref name="medium"/&gt; It eliminated belts, and instead employed a motor to directly drive a platter on which a vinyl record rests.&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;Trevor Pinch, Karin Bijsterveld, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KuRfLG0IedYC&amp;pg=PA515 ''The Oxford Handbook of Sound Studies'', page 515], [[Oxford University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, Matsushita released it as the [[Technics (brand)|SP-10]],&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt; the first direct-drive turntable on the market,&lt;ref name="reverb"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Record Player Part II: The Rise and Fall|url=https://reverb.com/news/history-of-the-record-player-part-ii-the-rise-and-fall|website=[[Reverb.com]]|accessdate=5 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first in their influential [[Technics (brand)|Technics]] series of turntables.&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt;

In the 1970s, [[hip hop music]]ians and club DJs began to use this specialized turntable equipment to move the record back and forth, creating percussive sounds and effects–"scratching"–to entertain their dance floor audiences. Whereas 1940s-1960s radio DJs had used back-cueing while listening to the sounds through their headphones, without the audience hearing, with scratching, the DJ intentionally lets the audience hear the sounds that are being created by manipulating the record on the turntable, by directing the output from the turntable to a [[sound reinforcement system]] so that the audience can hear the sounds. Scratching was developed by early [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] DJs from [[New York City]] such as [[Grand Wizard Theodore]], who described scratching as, "''nothing'' but the back-cueing that you hear in your ear before you push it [the recorded sound] out to the crowd."&lt;ref&gt;Toop, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; He developed the technique when experimenting with the [[Technics SL-1200]], a direct-drive turntable released by Matsushita in 1972, when he found that the motor would continue to spin at the correct [[revolutions per minute|RPM]] even if the DJ wiggled the record back and forth on the platter. [[Afrika Bambaataa]] made a similar discovery with the SL-1200 in the 1970s. The Technics SL-1200 went on to become the most widely used turntable for the next several decades.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;[https://www.wired.com/2002/05/blackbox/ Six Machines That Changed The Music World], ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', May 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Jamaican-born DJ [[Kool Herc]], who immigrated to New York City, influenced the early development of scratching. Kool Herc developed [[break (music)|break-beat]] [[DJ]]ing, where the breaks of [[funk]] songs&amp;mdash;being the most danceable part, often featuring [[percussion instrument|percussion]]&amp;mdash;were isolated and repeated for the purpose of all-night dance parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p312125/biography|pure_url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was influenced by Jamaican dub music,&lt;ref name="cambridge"&gt;Nicholas Collins, Margaret Schedel, Scott Wilson (2013), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bQeAtG97BmEC&amp;pg=PA105 ''Electronic Music: Cambridge Introductions to Music'', page 105], [[Cambridge University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; and developed his turntable techniques using the Technics SL-1100, released in 1971, due to its strong motor, durability, and fidelity.&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt;

Although previous artists such as writer and poet [[William S. Burroughs]] had experimented with the idea of manipulating a [[reel-to-reel tape]] manually to make sounds, as with his 1950s recording, "Sound Piece"), vinyl scratching as an element of hip hop pioneered the idea of making the sound an integral and rhythmic part of music instead of an uncontrolled noise. Scratching is related to "scrubbing" (in terms of audio editing and production) when the reels of an open [[reel-to-reel]] tape deck (typically 1/4 inch magnetic audio tape) are gently rotated back and forth while the playback head is live and amplified, in order to isolate a specific spot on the tape where an editing "cut" is to be made. In the 2010s, both scratching and scrubbing can be done on [[digital audio workstation]]s (DAWs) which are equipped for these techniques.

[[Christian Marclay]] was one of the earliest musicians to scratch outside hip hop. In the mid-1970s, Marclay used [[gramophone records]] and [[Phonograph|turntables]] as [[musical instrument]]s to create [[sound collage]]s. He developed his turntable sounds independently of [[hip hop music|hip hop]] DJs. Although he is little-known to mainstream audiences, Marclay has been described as "the most influential [[Turntablism|turntable]] figure outside hip hop"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.speech.kth.se/~hansen/turntablemusic.html|title=Kjetil Falkenberg Hansen&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100101235939/http://www.speech.kth.se/~hansen/turntablemusic.html|archivedate=2010-01-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the "unwitting inventor of [[turntablism]]."&lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r318378|pure_url=yes}} allmusic ((( More Encores: Christian Marclay Plays With the Records Of... &gt; Overview )))&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981 [[Grandmaster Flash]] released the song "[[The Adventures of Grandmaster Flash on the Wheels of Steel]]" which is notable for its use of many DJ scratching techniques. It was the first commercial recording produced entirely using turntables. In 1982, [[Malcolm McLaren]] &amp; the [[World's Famous Supreme Team]] released a single "[[Buffalo Gals (Malcolm McLaren song)|Buffalo Gals]]", juxtaposing extensive scratching with calls from [[square dancing]], and, in 1983, the EP, ''D'ya Like Scratchin'?'', which is entirely focused on scratching.  Another 1983 release to prominently feature scratching is [[Herbie Hancock]]'s [[Grammy Award]]-winning single "[[Rockit (song)|Rockit]]". This song was also performed live at the [[1984 Grammy Awards]], and in the documentary film ''[[Scratch (2001 film)|Scratch]]'', the performance is cited by many 1980s-era DJs as their first exposure to scratching. The Street Sounds Electro compilation series which started in 1983 is also notable for early examples of scratching. Also a notable piece was "For A Few Dollars More" by [[Bill Laswell]]-[[Michael Beinhorn]] band [[Material (band)|Material]], released on 12" single in Japan and containing scratch performed by [[Grand Mixer DXT]], another pioneer of scratching.

== Basic techniques ==

===Vinyl recordings===
Most scratches are produced by rotating a [[vinyl record]] on a [[direct drive turntable]] rapidly back and forth with the hand with the stylus ("needle") in the record's groove. This produces the distinctive sound that has come to be one of the most recognizable features of hip hop music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/jan/11/hey-whats-that-sound-turntablism|title=Hey, what's that sound: Turntablism|first=David|last=McNamee|date=11 January 2010|publisher=|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time with excessive scratching, the stylus will cause what is referred to as "record burn" to a vinyl record.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

}}
The basic equipment setup for scratching includes two turntables and a [[DJ mixer]], which is a small [[audio console|mixer]] that has a crossfader and cue buttons to allow the DJ to cue up new music in his/her [[headphones]] without the audience hearing.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}  When scratching, this crossfader is utilized in conjunction with the scratching hand that is manipulating the record platter. The hand manipulating the crossfader is used to cut in and out of the record's sound.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

===Digital vinyl systems===
Using a [[digital vinyl system]] (DVS) consists of playing vinyl discs on turntables whose contents is a timecode signal instead of a real music record.
# The turntables' audio outputs are connected to the audio inputs of a [[computer audio interface]].
# The audio interface digitizes the timecode signal from the turntables and transfers it to the computer's DJ software.
# The DJ software uses this data (e.g., about how fast the platter is spinning) to determine the playback status, speed, scratch sound of the hardware turntables, etc., and it duplicates these effects on the digital audio files or computer tracks the DJ is using.
# By manipulating the turntables' platters, speed controls, and other elements, the DJ thus controls how the computer plays back digitized audio and can therefore produce "scratching" and other [[turntablism]] effects on songs which exist as [[digital audio file]]s or computer tracks.

There is not a single standard of DVS, so that each form of DJ software has its own settings. Some DJ software such as [[Traktor|Traktor Scratch Pro]] or [[Serato Scratch Live]] support only the audio interface sold with their software, requiring multiple interfaces for one computer to run multiple programs.

Some digital vinyl systems software include:
*[[Traktor|Traktor Scratch Pro]]
*[[Cross/CrossDJ|Cross DVS]]
*Virtual DJ Pro
*[[Serato Scratch Live]]
*[[M-Audio]] Torq
*[[Deckadance]]
*[[Xwax]]

===Non-vinyl scratching===
While some turntablists consider the only true scratching media to be the vinyl disc, there are other ways to scratch, as:
*Specialized DJ-[[CD player]]s with jog wheels, allowing the DJ to manipulate a CD as if it were a vinyl record, have become widely available in the 2000s.
*Vinyl emulation software allows a DJ to manipulate the playback of digital music files on a computer via a DJ control surface (generally [[MIDI]] or a [[Human interface device|HID]] controller). [[DJ]]s can scratch, [[Beatmatching|beatmatch]], and perform other [[Turntablism|turntablist]] operations that cannot be done with a conventional keyboard and mouse. DJ software performing computer scratch operations include [[Traktor|Traktor Pro]], [[Mixxx]], [[Serato Scratch Live]] &amp; Itch, Virtual DJ, [[M-Audio]] Torq, [[djay (software)|DJay]], [[Deckadance]], [[Cross/CrossDJ|Cross]].
*DJs have also used magnetic tape, such as [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] or [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel to reel]] to both mix and scratch. Tape DJing is rare, but Ruthless Ramsey &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=088AWsTtTFU|title=DJ Ruthless Ramsey Scratch Tape Decks|first=|last=esponda|date=14 March 2008|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the US, Tj Scratchavite &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XolrZ6Q-4gw|title=TJ Scratchavite - Matthew's Cellar|first=|last=Federico Nardella|date=19 September 2016|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Italy and Mr Tape &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RM9_tQjuo0|title=World Hip Hop Classic - Mr. Tape 1991|first=|last=Yussuf von Deck|date=14 May 2012|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Latvia use exclusively tape formats to perform.

==Sounds==
Sounds that are frequently scratched include but are not limited to drum beats, [[horn stab]]s, spoken word [[Sampling (music)|samples]], and vocals/lyrics from other songs. Any sound recorded to vinyl can be used, and [[Compact disc|CD]] players providing a turntable-like interface allow DJs to scratch not only material that was never released on vinyl, but also field recordings and samples from television and movies that have been burned to [[CD-R]]. Some DJs and anonymous collectors release [[12-inch single]]s called [[battle records]] that include trademark, novel or hard-to-find scratch "fodder" (material). The most recognizable samples used for scratching are the "Ahh" and "Fresh" samples, which originate from the song "[[Change the Beat]]" by [[Fab 5 Freddy]].

There are many scratching techniques, which differ in how the movements of the record are combined with opening and closing the crossfader (or another fader or switch, such as a [[kill switch]], where "open" means that the signal is audible, and "closed" means that the signal is inaudible). This terminology is not unique; the following discussion, however, is consistent with the terminology used by [[DJ QBert]] on his ''Do It Yourself Scratching'' DVD.

===Sophisticated techniques===
* '''Baby scratch''' - The simplest scratch form, it is performed with the scratching hand only, moving the record back and forth in continuous movements while the crossfader is in the open position.
* '''Forward and backward scratch''' - The forward scratch, also referred to as scrubbing, is a baby scratch where the crossfader is closed during the backwards movement of the record.  If the record is let go instead of being pushed forward it is also called "release scratch".  Cutting out the forward part of the record movement instead of the backward part gives a "backward scratch".
*''' [[Tear (scratch)|Tear scratch]]''' - Tear scratches are scratches where the record is moved in a staggered fashion, dividing the forward and backward movement into two or more movements.  This allows creating sounds similar to "flare scratches" without use of the crossfader and it allows for more complex rhythmic patterns.  The term can also refer to a simpler, slower version of the chirp.
* '''Scribble scratch''' - The scribble scratch is by rapidly pushing the record back and forth. The crossfader is not used.
* '''[[Chirp (scratch)|Chirp scratch]]''' -  The chirp scratch involves closing the crossfader just after playing the start of a sound, stopping the record at the same point, then pushing it back while opening the fader to create a "chirping" sound.  When performed using a recording of drums, it can create the illusion of doubled scratching speed, due to the [[Attack-Decay-Sustain-Release|attack]] created by cutting in the crossfader on the backward movement.
* '''Hydrophonic scratch''' - A baby scratch with a "tear scratch" sound produced by the thumb running the opposite direction as the fingers used to scratch. This rubbing of the thumb adds a vibrating effect or reverberation to forward movements on the turntable.
* '''[[Transform (scratch)|Transformer scratch]]''' - with the crossfader closed, the record is moved with the scratching hand while periodically "tapping" the crossfader open and immediately closing it again.
* '''[[Flare (scratch)|Flare scratch]]''' - Begins with the crossfader open, and then the record is moved while briefly closing the fader one or more times to cut the sound out.  This produces a staggering sound which can make a single "flare" sound like a very fast series of "chirps" or "tears."   The number of times the fader is closed ("clicks") during the record's movement is usually used as a prefix to distinguish the variations.  The flare allows a DJ to scratch continuously with less hand fatigue than would result from the transformer.  The flare can be combined with the [[crab (scratch)|crab]] for an extremely rapid continuous series of scratches.
* '''[[Crab (scratch)|Crab scratch]]''' - Consists of moving the record while quickly tapping the crossfader open with each finger of the crossfader hand.  In this way, DJs are able to perform transforms or flares much faster than they could by manipulating the crossfader with the whole hand.  It produces a fading/increasing transforming sound.
* '''Twiddle scratch''' - A crab scratch using only the index and middle fingers.
* '''[[Orbit (scratch)|Orbit scratch]]''' - Describes any scratch, most commonly flares, that are repeated during the forward and backward movement of the record.  "Orbit" is also used as a shorthand for two-click flares.
* '''Tweak scratch''' - Performed while the turntable's motor is not running.  The record platter is set in motion manually, then "tweaked" faster and slower to create a scratch.  This scratch form is best performed with long, sustained sounds.
* '''Euro scratch''' -  A variation of the "flare scratch" in which two faders are used simultaneously with one hand to cut the sound much faster. It can also be performed by using only the up fader and the phono line switch to cut the sound.

==Subculture==
While scratching is becoming more and more popular within pop music, particularly with the crossover success of pop-hip hop tracks in the 2010s, sophisticated scratching and other expert turntablism techniques are still predominantly an underground style developed by the [[DJ]] subculture. The [[Invisibl Skratch Piklz]] from [[San Francisco]] focuses on scratching. In 1994, the group was formed by DJs [[DJ Q-Bert|Q-Bert]], [[DJ Disk|Disk]] &amp; [[DJ Shortkut|Shortkut]] and later [[Mix Master Mike]]. In July 2000, [[San Francisco]]'s [[Yerba Buena Center for the Arts]] held Skratchcon2000, the first DJ Skratch forum that provided “the education and development of skratch music literacy”. In 2001, [[Thud Rumble]] became an independent company that works with DJ artists to produce and distribute scratch records.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

In 2004, ''[[Scratch (magazine)|Scratch Magazine]]'', one of the first publications about hip hop DJs and [[record producer]]s, released its debut issue, following in the footsteps of the lesser-known ''Tablist'' magazine. Pedestrian is a UK arts organisation that runs Urban Music Mentors workshops led by DJs. At these workshops, DJs teach youth how to create beats, use turntables to create mixes, act as an [[MC]] at events, and perform club sets.

==Use outside hip hop==
Scratching has been incorporated into a number of other musical genres, including [[Pop music|pop]], [[rock music|rock]], [[jazz]], some subgenres of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] (notably [[nu metal]]) and some contemporary and avant-garde [[European classical music|classical music]] performances. For recording use, [[sampler (musical instrument)|samplers]] are often used instead of physically scratching a vinyl record.

DJ Product©1969, formerly of the [[rap rock]] band [[Hed PE]], recalled that the [[punk rock]] band [[the Vandals]] was the first rock band he remembered seeing use turntable scratching.&lt;ref name=beatdust&gt;http://www.beatdust.com/graphic-nature/graphic-nature-dj-product-1969-hedpe-self-titled/&lt;/ref&gt; Product©1969 also recalled the early [[rap metal]] band Proper Grounds, which was signed to [[Madonna (singer)|Madonna]]'s [[Maverick Records]], as being another one of the first rock bands to utilize scratching in their music.&lt;ref name=beatdust/&gt;

Guitarist [[Tom Morello]], known for his work with [[Rage Against the Machine]] and [[Audioslave]], has performed [[guitar solo]]s that imitate scratching by using the [[kill switch]] on his guitar. Perhaps the best-known example is "[[Bulls on Parade]]", in which he creates scratch-like rhythmic sounds by rubbing the strings over the pick-ups while using the pickup selector switch as a [[crossfade (audio engineering)|crossfader]].

Since the 1990s, scratching has been used in a variety of popular music genres such as [[nu metal]], exemplified by [[Linkin Park]], [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]] and [[Limp Bizkit]]. It has also been used by artists in pop music (e.g. [[Nelly Furtado]]) and [[alternative rock]] (e.g. [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]]). Scratching is also popular in various [[electronic music]] styles, such as hard-groove [[techno]].

The '''Systems Biology Ontology''' (SBO) is a set of controlled, relational vocabularies of terms commonly used in [[Systems Biology]], and in particular in computational modeling. SBO is part of the [http://www.biomodels.net/ BioModels.net] effort.

==Motivation==

The rise of Systems Biology, seeking to comprehend biological processes as a whole, highlighted the need to not only develop corresponding quantitative models, but also to create standards allowing their exchange and integration. This concern drove the community to design common data format such as [[SBML]] and [[CellML]]. SBML is now largely accepted and used in the field.  However, as important as the definition of a common syntax is, it is also necessary to make clear the semantics of models. SBO is an attempt to provide the means of annotating models with terms that indicate the intended semantics of an important subset of models in common use in computational systems biology.&lt;ref&gt;Le Novère N. BioModels.net, tools and resources to support Computational Systems Biology. Proceedings of the 4th Workshop on Computation of Biochemical Pathways and Genetic Networks (2005), Logos, Berlin, pp. 69-74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Le Novère N., Courtot M., Laibe C. Adding semantics in kinetics models of biochemical pathways. Proceedings of the 2nd International Symposium on experimental standard conditions of enzyme characterizations (2007), 137-153. [http://www.beilstein-institut.de/index.php?id=196 Available online]&lt;/ref&gt; The development of SBO was first discussed  at the 9th SBML Forum Meeting in Heidelberg Oct. 14–15, 2004. During the forum, [[Pedro Pedrosa Mendes|Pedro Mendes]] mentioned that modellers possessed a lot of knowledge that was necessary to understand the model, and more importantly to simulate it,  but this knowledge was not encoded in SBML. [[Nicolas Le Novère]] proposed to create a controlled vocabulary to store the content of Pedro Mendes' mind before he wandered out of the community.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolas Le Novère, personal communication&lt;/ref&gt; The development of the ontology was  announced more officially in a message from Le Novère to Michael Hucka and Andrew Finney on October 19.

==Structure==

SBO is currently made up of seven different vocabularies:
* systems description parameter (catalytic constant, thermodynamic temperature...)
* participant role (substrate, product, catalyst...)
* modelling framework (discrete, continuous...)
* mathematical expression (mass-action rate law, Hill-type rate law...)
* occurring entity representation (biochemical process, molecular or genetic interaction...)
* physical entity representation (transporter, physical compartment, observable...)
* metadata representation (annotation)

==Resources==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:SBO small.jpg|frame|right|The Systems Biology Ontology Browser|{{deletable image-caption|1=Saturday, 25 July 2009}}]] --&gt;
To curate and maintain SBO, a dedicated resource has been developed and the public interface of the SBO browser can be accessed at [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/sbo http://www.ebi.ac.uk/sbo].
A relational database management system ([[MySQL]]) at the back-end is
accessed through a web interface based on [[Java Server Pages]] (JSP) and [[JavaBeans]].  Its
content is encoded in [[UTF-8]], therefore supporting a large set of
characters in the definitions of terms.  Distributed curation is made possible
by using a custom-tailored locking system allowing concurrent access.
This system allows a continuous update of the ontology with immediate
availability and suppress merging problems.

Several exports formats ([http://www.godatabase.org/dev/doc/obo_format_spec.html OBO] flat file, [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/sbo/docs/sboxml_schema.xsd SBO-XML] and [http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-features/ OWL]) are generated daily or on request and can be downloaded from the web interface.

To allow programmatic access to the resource, [[Web Services]] have been implemented based on [http://ws.apache.org/axis/ Apache Axis] for the communication layer and [http://www.castor.org/ Castor] for the validation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Li C, Courtot M, Le Novère N, Laibe C |title=BioModels.net Web Services, a free and integrated toolkit for computational modelling software |journal=Brief. Bioinformatics |volume= 11|issue= 3|pages= 270–7|date=November 2009 |pmid=19939940 |pmc=2913671 |doi=10.1093/bib/bbp056 |url=http://bib.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=19939940}}&lt;/ref&gt; The libraries, full documentation, samples and tutorial are available [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/sbo/SBOWSLib/ws.html online].

The sourceforge project can be accessed at [http://sourceforge.net/projects/sbo/ http://sourceforge.net/projects/sbo/].

==SBO and SBML==

Since [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=71971&amp;package_id=76633 Level 2 Version 2] [[SBML]] provides a mechanism to annotate model components with SBO terms, therefore increasing the semantics of the
model beyond the sole topology of interaction and mathematical expression.  Modelling tools such as SBMLsqueezer use SBO terms too. Simulation tools can check the consistency of a rate law, convert reaction from one modelling framework to another (e.g., continuous to discrete), or distinguish between identical mathematical expressions based on different assumptions (e.g., Henri-Michaelis-Menten Vs. Briggs-Haldane).  Other tools such as [http://www.semanticsbml.org/ semanticSBML]&lt;ref&gt;Krause F, Uhlendorf J., Lubitz T., Schulz M., Klipp E., Liebermeister W. (2010), Annotation and merging of SBML models with semanticSBML, Bioinformatics 26 (3), 421-422&lt;/ref&gt; can use the SBO annotation to integrate individual models into a larger one.  The use of SBO is not restricted to the development of models. Resources providing quantitative experimental information such as [https://web.archive.org/web/20061117195025/http://sabio.villa-bosch.de/SABIORK/ SABIO Reaction Kinetics] will be able to annotate the parameters (what do they mean exactly, how were they calculated) and determine relationships between them.

==SBO and SBGN==

All the graphical symbols used in the [[SBGN]] languages are associated with an SBO term. This permits, for instance, to help generate [[SBGN]] maps from [[SBML]] models.

==SBO and BioPAX==

The Systems Biology Pathway Exchange (SBPAX) allows SBO terms to be added to [[BioPAX|Biological Pathway Exchange (BioPAX)]]. This links BioPAX to information useful for modelling, especially by adding quantitative descriptions described by SBO.

==Organization of SBO development==

SBO is built in collaboration by the [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/compneur Computational Neurobiology Group] (Nicolas Le Novère, [[EMBL]]-[[European Bioinformatics Institute|EBI]], United-Kingdom) and the [[SBML]]Team (Michael Hucka, [[Caltech]], USA).

==Funding for SBO==
SBO has benefited from the funds of the [[European Molecular Biology Laboratory]] and the [[National Institute of General Medical Sciences]].

'''Tachyspory''' is a form of [[Dehiscence (botany)|dehiscence]] where seed is rapidly released from a [[Conifer cone|cone]] or [[fruit]]  upon maturity, as opposed to [[Bradyspory]], the slow release of seed over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pK_xCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA100&amp;lpg=PA100&amp;dq=tachyspory&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Nd4typ5b2b&amp;sig=n_0MHmpcku250gxsqM_tNOjcmCY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi5553d-JjcAhXrwFQKHTtaDh0Q6AEIPjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=tachyspory&amp;f=false|title=Principles of Dispersal in Higher Plants|last=Pijl|first=L. van der|date=2012-12-06|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9783642879258|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a word used in [[botany]] to describe seed dispersal.

'''''The Culture of Disbelief''''' ({{ISBN|0-385-47498-9}}) is a 1994 book by [[Stephen L. Carter]]. In it, he holds that [[religion]] in the United States is trivialized by American [[law]] and [[politics]], and that those with a strong religious faith are forced to bend to meet the viewpoint of a "public faith" which is largely faithless. Carter argues that there is a place for faith in public life, while still adhering to the [[separation of church and state]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4337">A '''top-lit updraft gasifier''' (also known as a '''TLUD''') is a [[micro-kiln]] used to produce charcoal, especially [[biochar]], and heat for cooking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biochar-Producing Stoves to Benefit Climate, Health, and Soil|url=http://www.biochar-international.org/technology/stoves|publisher=International Biochar Initiative|accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A TLUD [[pyrolysis|pyrolyzes]] organic material, including wood or manure, and uses a reburner to eliminate volatile byproducts of pyrolization. The process leaves mostly [[carbon]] as a residue, which can be incorporated into soil to create [[terra preta]].

Dr Thomas B Reed and the Norwegian architect Paal Wendelbo independently developed the working idea of a TLUD gasifier in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of TLUD|url=http://www.drtlud.com/tlud-technology/history/|publisher=Dr TLUD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A TLUD gasifier takes it further from a [[rocket stove]] in more efficient way of smoke-free, highly efficient combustion of the fuel.

== The Technology ==

A TLUD gasifier stove &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BioChar Foundation|url=http://www.biochar-international.org/technology/stoves}}&lt;/ref&gt; is commonly constructed with two concentric cylindrical containers.

The inner cylinder is the fuel pot. The fuel pot has holes in the base. These holes are the primary air inlet. The fuel pot also has holes on the neck, like the skirt, serving as a secondary air inlet.

The outer cylinder has holes near the bottom on the sides. During combustion, air enters these holes, either by natural air draft or forced with a DC fan depending on requirement and construction model.

Any biomass with less than 20% water content can be used as fuel. The user fills the fuel pot up to the neck, just below the secondary air inlet holes. The user ignites the top layer of fuel for the pyrolysis to start. Air then flows in through the primary and secondary air inlets. The primary inlet helps the draft of pyrolysed wood gas flow up.

The secondary air inlet blows hot air by the time it travels around the fuel pot. The secondary inlet above the fuel layer helps burn the wood gas. 

YouTube has many instructional videos, with further explanation on other websites.

The institute was founded by the Estonian government in 1995 and is located in the Southern Estonian town of [[Võru]]. The directors of the institute have been [[Enn Kasak]], [[Kaido Kama]] and [[Külli Eichenbaum]]. The present director of the institute is [[Rainer Kuuba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://news.err.ee/114404/smoke-sauna-tradition-in-vorumaa-added-to-unesco-intangible-cultural-heritage-list||title=Smoke sauna tradition in Võrumaa added to UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage List|access-date=26 February 2018|date=27 November 2014|publisher=eer.ee|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers at the institute include the toponymist [[Evar Saar]] and the lexicographer [[Sulev Iva]].

==Activities==
The institute is engaged in a wide range of activities to meet the challenges facing lesser-spoken languages, including establishing school programs, conducting linguistic and regional research, preserving place-names and their corresponding stories (mostly by [[Evar Saar]]), publishing Võro-language scholarship and school textbooks, and organizing annual language conferences. The aim of these activities is to encourage the Võro people to speak their own language and to preserve their characteristic life-style.

The '''Waterloo Institute for Nanotechnology''' (WIN) is located at the [[University of Waterloo]] and is co-located with the [[Institute for Quantum Computing]] in the [[Mike &amp; Ophelia Lazaridis Quantum-Nano Centre|Mike and Ophelia Lazaridis Quantum-Nano Centre (QNC)]]. WIN is headed by Dr. Sushanta Mitra.

The Waterloo Institute for Nanotechnology comprises 84 faculty from nine different departments in the faculties of Science, Engineering, and Math.

==Major research facilities==
The Quantum-Nano centre is the site of a community laboratory for nano-metrology and nano-fabrication. Construction began on 9 June 2008 and is expected to be completed 21 September 2012. The 160 million dollar, {{convert|284000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility will be the home to a  {{convert|17000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} laboratory.

===Funding===
Capital funding for construction of the QNC was made possible by major gifts and awards from multiple sources including a 101 million dollar donation from Ophelia and [[Mike Lazaridis]] (co-CEO of [[Research in Motion]] and Chancellor of the University of Waterloo). Government funding includes 17.9 million dollars from the [[Canada Foundation for Innovation]] (CFI) which has been matched by the Province of Ontario.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;University of Waterloo Quantum-Nano Fact Sheet&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, an anonymous donor has provided an endowment of 29 million dollars for 3 endowed chairs and 42 Graduate Nanofellowships.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Laboratories===

==Research interests==

=== Nano-engineered materials===
Research in nano-engineered materials includes many departments and Faculties at Waterloo. Researchers in chemistry, [[chemical engineering]], [[mechanical and mechatronics engineering]], and [[electrical and computer engineering]] are collaborating on modeling, design, fabrication, processing, characterization and analysis of nano-scale properties of materials, structures, devices and systems. This development will be further driven by the need to address a critical issue also faced in the integration of nano-scale devices: the interface between nano-structured materials and the macroscopic world.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

====Nano-engineered materials projects====
*Development and characterization of ferromagnetic iron-particles as drug delivery vehicles.

Example applications include: [[scanning probe microscopy]], [[atomic force microscopy]], nano-materials characterization and [[atomic resolution imaging]] with the objective of developing technologies for precision nano-scale assembly and manufacturing.

====Nano-fabrication projects====
*Fundamental and applied research into flexible, transparent electronics; that is, electronics embedded on a mechanically flexible substrate such as plastic, rather than on traditional and brittle ones such as silicon.
*Experimentation in [[electron beam lithography]], to fabricate nanostructures and nanoelectronic devices, and to determine how the arrangement of molecules affects the chemical properties of substances.
*Fundamental studies and development of nanocrystalline thin-film semiconductors, devices and circuits for electronics and spintronics.

===Nano-instrumentation===
Techniques to fabricate new instrumentation to characterize critical parameters such as size, composition, stiffness, surface characteristics, dopant concentration, [[magnetic coercivity]], and other properties of particular interest to the nano scale. Due to their small size, nano-systems are extremely challenging to assemble, and yet precise control of their parameters is often critical to their performance. A related goal is to cause a paradigm shift in classical chemical measurements (in which samples are brought to the lab for analysis) by developing wireless, energy-efficient mobile nano-instruments that allow users to bring the lab to the sample. Examples of "the lab" include nano-instruments of all types and two examples of "the sample" include the environment or a patient. The metrology arm of the new labs will be used to study measurements at the nano-scale, to develop new and unique nano-scale measuring instruments, and to calibrate such instruments. It will also address associated challenges involved in fabricating, integrating and packaging instruments at the nano-scale.

===Nano–biosystems===
Nano–bio is a field that includes both the use of nanotechnology in biological and agrifood systems and use of biological or biomimetic techniques in nanotechnology. Nanobiotechnology shows a tremendous promise of improving the quality of life. For example, nanovehicles might deliver drugs directly to targeted cells, nanomembranes may be used for development of cheap, effective water purification systems, or nanochips that interface neurons with electronics may become common place. NEMS (nano-electromechanical systems) might use sensors and physical controls to stabilize individuals with heart, kidney or liver disease. As nanotechnology researchers strive to create self-assembling devices, they are beginning to exploit natural self-assemblers: proteins, DNA and viruses. Examples also include development of food quality monitoring sensors and microfluidic biosensor components.Nanoscale imaging of biological systems helps to understand the nanoscale structure–function relationship of materials and in evaluating the food quality–function information. Characterization of nanoscale fragments of biomaterials such as DNA, proteins, chromosomes, plant cells, bacteria, starch granules and anti-allergens are extremely important.

====Nano–bio projects====
*[[Lab-on-a-chip]] applications, such as DNA chips and pharmacy-on-a-chip.
*Creation of nano-vehicles that mimic the way viruses interact with specific cells. This will facilitate the [[Targeted drug delivery|delivery of drugs directly to targeted cells]], and could, for instance, eliminate the toxic side-effects of [[chemotherapy]] by directing the therapeutic agents to cancer cells only.
*Development of nanotech methods for therapeutic applications, for example, for replacing faulty DNA or RNA strands with corrected strands.
*Fundamental and applied research into how certain peptides self-assemble into nano-structures, which will increase understanding of certain neurological diseases, and may subsequently lead to novel treatment methods.
*Development of polymeric nanostructures from self-assembly block copolymers for delivery of drugs, proteins and DNA.
*Application of nanotech research into flexible electronics to create low-dose, portable, "wrap-around" x-ray machines.
*Development of nanotechniques for inactivation of [[microbes]]: an efficient and cheap method of food sterilization.
*Creation of "nanowires" based on a chain-link arrangement of [[ferritin]] structures.
*Interfacing [[nanochips]] to [[biomolecule]]s.
*Using micro-arrays for high-throughput screening and developing printable arrays.
*[[Nanomedicine]]
*[[Gene therapy]]
*Polymeric nanostructures
*Implantable nano-enabled devices

A '''xylotheque''' or '''xylothek''' (from the Greek ''xylon'' for "wood" and "theque" meaning "repository") is special form of [[herbarium]] that consists of a collection of authenticated wood specimens.&lt;ref name=CEPH/&gt; It is also known as a  '''xylarium''' (from the Greek ''xylon'' for "wood" and Latin "arium" meaning "separate place"). Traditionally, xylotheque specimens were in the form of book-shaped volumes, each made of a particular kind of wood and holding samples of the different parts of the corresponding plant. While the terms are often used interchangeably, some use ''xylotheque'' to refer to these older collections of wooden 'books' and ''xylarium'' for modern collections in which some or all of the specimens are in simpler shapes, such as blocks or plaques with information engraved on their surfaces.&lt;ref name=CEPH/&gt; Many countries have at least one xylotheque with native [[flora]], and some also house flora from other parts of the world. They are valuable to specialists in forestry, botany, conservation, forensics, art restoration, [[paleontology]], [[archaeology]], and other fields.&lt;ref name=kerala/&gt;

==History==
Xylotheques date back to the later 17th century, when wood specimens began to appear in [[Cabinet of curiosities|cabinets of curiosity]].&lt;ref name=Lovejoy/&gt; Over time, they grew larger and more systematic, with hundreds of individual volumes in a single collection. The oldest extant collection was established in 1823 at the University of Leningrad, and by the middle of the century they had been established in many European countries.&lt;ref name=CEPH/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lovejoy/&gt;&lt;ref name=Queensland/&gt; Australia now houses 12 xylaria holding 11% of the world's wood specimens,&lt;ref name=Queensland/&gt; while the Oxford Forestry Institute's xylarium holds about 13%.&lt;ref name=CEPH/&gt;

In older xylotheques, the wooden volumes were typically made out of the same wood as the specimens inside and sometimes decorated with tree bark and associated lichens and mosses.&lt;ref name=Lovejoy/&gt; Each volume housed seeds, flowers, twigs, and leaves from the corresponding tree or bush, along with a written description hidden in a small compartment set into the inner spine. An alternative form of xylotheque found in Japan and elsewhere featured paintings of the plant parts rather than actual field specimens.&lt;ref name=Lovejoy/&gt;  

Even a modest collection of wood samples has value, as each of its samples has a particular history. Xylotheques provide comparison samples for [[xylotomy]], art historical studies, and scientific studies of the physical and [[mechanics|mechanical]] properties of wood, such as durability and preservation. Xylotheques are also useful for anyone who needs to make a morphological-visual analysis of wood.

The xylotheque with the largest number of samples is the [[Samuel James Record]] Collection in the United States, which holds 98,000 samples. Formerly housed at the Forestry School of [[Yale University]] in New Haven, Connecticut, it was transferred to the U.S. Forest Service's Forest Products Laboratory in 1969.&lt;ref name=CEPH/&gt;&lt;ref name=FPL/&gt; The second largest xylotheque belongs to the [[Royal Museum of Central Africa]] in [[Tervuren]], Belgium, with 57,000 samples.&lt;ref name=CEPH/&gt; The Thünen Institute of Wood Research in [[Hamburg]] has more than 37,000 samples.&lt;ref name=thuenen/&gt;

==In popular culture==
For [[documenta]] 13 in 2012, American artist [[Mark Dion]] created a new hexagonal display chamber for the Schildbach Xylotheque at the Natural History Museum in Kassel, Germany. As part of the project, he created six new volumes made of wood from each of the continents (excluding Antarctica).&lt;ref name=dion/&gt;
