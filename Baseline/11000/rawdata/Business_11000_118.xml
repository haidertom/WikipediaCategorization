[[File:Boeing-777-300 chassis .jpg|thumb|Tires on the wheels of a [[Bogie#Bogie (aircraft)|bogie]] on a [[Boeing 777]]]]

An '''aircraft tire''' or '''tyre''' is designed to withstand extremely heavy loads for short durations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=brc7AAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Aircraft+tires+designed+to+withstand+extremely+heavy+loads+for+short+duration&amp;dq=Aircraft+tires+designed+to+withstand+extremely+heavy+loads+for+short+duration&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiFn_q6y77VAhXCz1QKHUF9DKIQ6AEIQTAF|title=Aerospace safety|last=Force|first=United States Dept of the Air|date=1974|publisher=for sale by the Supt. of Docs., U.S. Govt. Print. Off.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of tires required for aircraft increases with the weight of the aircraft, as the weight of the airplane needs to be distributed more evenly. Aircraft tire tread patterns are designed to facilitate stability in high [[crosswind]] conditions, to channel water away to prevent hydroplaning, and for braking effect.

Aircraft tires also include [[fusible plug]]s (which are assembled on the inside of the wheels), designed to melt at a certain temperature. Tires often overheat if maximum braking is applied during an aborted takeoff or an [[emergency landing]]. The fuses provide a safer failure mode that prevents tire explosions by deflating in a controlled manner, thus minimizing damage to aircraft and objects in the surrounding environment.

==Inflation==

Aircraft tires are usually inflated with [[nitrogen]] to minimize expansion and contraction from extreme changes in ambient temperature and pressure experienced during flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgAD.nsf/0/55850e6389efba3c8625695b006723a3!OpenDocument#_Section1 | title=FAA Airworthiness Directive | accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dry nitrogen expands at the same rate as other dry atmospheric gases (normal air is about 80% nitrogen), but common compressed air sources may contain moisture, which increases the expansion rate with temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://getnitrogen.org/why/| title= Why Nitrogen | accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aircraft tires generally operate at high pressures, up to {{convert|200|psi|bar kPa|lk=on}} for airliners, and even higher for business jets. Tests of airliner aircraft tires have shown that they are able to sustain pressures of maximum {{convert|800|psi|bar kPa}} before bursting. During the tests the tires have to be filled with water, to prevent the test room being blown apart by the energy that would be released by a gas when the tire bursts.

The requirement that an inert gas, such as nitrogen, be used instead of air for inflation of tires on certain transport category airplanes was prompted by at least three cases in which the oxygen in air-filled tires combined with volatile gases given off by a severely overheated tire and exploded upon reaching [[autoignition temperature]]. The use of an inert gas for tire inflation will eliminate the possibility of a tire explosion.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Aviation Administration, Use of Nitrogen or Other Inert Gas for Tire Inflation in Lieu of Air&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacturers==
The aircraft tire manufacturing industry is dominated by a four firm [[oligopoly]] that controls 85% of market share.&lt;ref name=top4&gt;{{cite news|title=Manufacturers work on perfecting aircraft tires|url=http://www.rubbernews.com/article/20130509/NEWS/130509939/manufacturers-work-on-perfecting-aircraft-tires|newspaper=Rubber News|date=May 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The four major manufacturers in aircraft tire manufacturing are the following according to a report by Pelmar Engineering in 2013:&lt;ref name="pelmar"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Peled|first1=Jacob|title=Aircraft Tire Production-New Horizons|url=http://www.slideshare.net/PelmarGroup/jacob-peled-clemson2013-uri|website=SlideShare|publisher=Pelmar Engineering Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] (United States)
* [[Michelin]] (France)
* [[Dunlop Aircraft Tyres]] (United Kingdom)
* [[Bridgestone]] (Japan)

These major firms form an oligopoly that controls approximately 85% of the manufacturing market and account for most of the [[retread|retreads]].&lt;ref name="pelmar"/&gt; Dunlop is the smallest player among the major firms with revenue reported at £40m in a 2015 media report.&lt;ref name="marketshare"&gt;{{cite news|title=Global Aircraft Tire Market 2014-2018|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-aircraft-tire-market-2014-2018-263199651.html|publisher=PRNewswire|date=June 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="revenuedunlop"&gt;{{cite news|title=Dunlop Aircraft Tyres’ niche approach bucks UK trend|url=https://next.ft.com/content/347d3f40-5317-11e5-8642-453585f2cfcd|publisher=Financial Times|date=September 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several other smaller industry players, particularly in China. Among these producers are [[Guilin]]-based Guilin Lanyu Aircraft Tire Development Co., a subsidiary of [[ChemChina]] that was founded in 1980; a [[Yinchuan]], [[Ningxia]] located aircraft tire plant owned by Singapore-based [[Giti Tire]]; and [[Qingdao]], [[Shandong]]-based [[Sentury Tire]], which manufactures tires for the [[Boeing 737]].&lt;ref name=triangle&gt;{{cite news|title=Triangle Group to add aircraft radials to range|url=http://www.rubbernews.com/article/20120517/NEWS/305179996|newspaper=Rubber News|date=May 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guilin&gt;{{cite web|title=Brief Introduction|url=http://www.glnet.edu.cn/LANYU/ly_index.html|publisher=Guilin Lanyu Aircraft Tire Development Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="qingdao"&gt;{{cite news|title=Aircraft tires: Up, up and away!|url=http://www.moderntiredealer.com/article/312174/aircraft-tires-up-up-and-away|agency=Modern Tire Dealer|date=June 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[Weihai]], Shandong-based [[Triangle Group (company)|Triangle Group]] announced in 2012 a collaboration with the [[Harbin Institute of Technology]] for designing and manufacturing aircraft tires.&lt;ref name=triangle&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Former manufacturers===
[[Yokohama Rubber]] had been manufacturing aircraft tires since 1940 but shut down its operations and made no more deliveries after 2009.&lt;ref name=yokohama&gt;{{cite news|title=Yokohama withdraws from aircraft tire business|url=http://www.tiretechnologyinternational.com/news.php?NewsID=11573|newspaper=Tire Technology International}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The company decided to close down the aircraft unit because its sales were low, having revenue of only 800 million JPY or about 8 million USD in the 2008-9 fiscal year, and it assessed the future outlook of the industry as lacking in strong growth.&lt;ref name=yokohama&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2011}}
'''Albian Sands Energy Inc'''. is the operator of the '''Muskeg River Mine''' and '''Jack Pine Mine''', an [[oil sands]] mining project located {{convert|75|km|mi}} north of [[Fort McMurray]], [[Alberta]], Canada. It is a joint venture between [[Shell Canada]] (10%), [[CNRL]] (70%) and [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron Canada]] (20%).  The company's legal headquarters are located in the [[Shell Tower (Calgary)|Shell Tower]] in [[Calgary]], Alberta. Albian Sands got its name from the Albian Boreal Sea which, during the [[Albian]] stage of the [[Cretaceous]] (over 100&amp;nbsp;million years ago), moved over the McMurray sands and deposited a blanket of marine shale on its floor which trapped the hydrocarbons of the McMurray Formation. The oil sands resources of the Muskeg River Mine are a legacy of the Albian Sea.&lt;ref&gt;

At full production, Albian Sands can produce {{convert|340000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}} of crude [[bitumen]], a naturally occurring semi-solid form of crude oil. The mine product, diluted bitumen or ''[[dilbit]]'', is sent to be upgraded at the [[Scotford Upgrader]] in [[Fort Saskatchewan]]. The Muskeg River Mine stands on a Shell Canada lease containing more than {{convert|5|Goilbbl|m3}} of mineable bitumen, of which it is expected to recover {{convert|1650|Moilbbl|m3}} of bitumen over the next 30 years. The Muskeg River Mine, Jack Pine Mine and the Scotford Upgrader together comprise the '''Athabasca Oil Sands Project (AOSP)'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

The '''Association for Women in Communications''' (AWC) is an American [[professional organization]] for women in the [[communications]] industry.&lt;ref name="Burt-2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kopecki-1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sterling-2003" /&gt;

==History==
The Association for Women in Communications began in 1909 as '''Theta Sigma Phi''' ('''ΘΣΦ'''), an honorary society at the [[University of Washington]].&lt;ref name="Burt-2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sterling-2003" /&gt;  It was founded by seven female students at the University of Washington in Seattle who had entered the college's new journalism program, the second of its kind in the country. By 1915, there were Theta Sigma Phi chapters at the universities of Indiana, Wisconsin, Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Oregon and [[Ohio State University]]. Officers from the Washington Chapter still doubled as national officers, and the organization began publishing '''''The Matrix'', a Magazine for Women Journalists'''.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womcom.org/about_us/history.asp |title=AWC is One of the Originals |publisher=Association for Women in Communications |date=|accessdate=March 25, 2014| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140209214956/http://www.womcom.org/about_us/history.asp| archivedate=  February 9, 2014|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918, Theta Sigma Phi held its first convention at the [[University of Kansas]]. A year later, women in Kansas City founded the first alumnae chapter (now known as professional chapters), followed by women in Des Moines and Indianapolis.

[[World War I]] brought more women into newspaper jobs as their male colleagues went to battle. Theta Sigma Phi member [[Alice Rohe]] was a [[United Press]] reporter in Rome; [[Bessie Beatty]] of the ''[[San Francisco Bulletin]]'' and [[Sigrid Schultz]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' reported from Germany as the war ended. But in the postwar economic slump, hostility against "women in men's jobs" ran high. Many editors relegated women to society pages instead of "hard news."

Although women gained the right to vote in 1920, support lagged for other reforms. Ruby Black, who was national president, editor of ''The Matrix'' and the first manager of an employment bureau for members, noted in 1931 that female journalists couldn't get reporting jobs at the same pay as similarly qualified men.

Theta Sigma Phi strengthened as a national network during the 1930s. The association hired a professional director and founded a national office in 1934. It inaugurated the Headliner Awards in 1939 to honor members who had made outstanding contributions to the field. The group gave [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] honorary membership for her efforts to aid female communicators. The First Lady's most notable action was to close her news conferences to male reporters. Mrs. Roosevelt contributed several articles to ''The Matrix''.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

By 1940, Theta Sigma Phi had 39 chapters, and [[World War II]] was expanding opportunities for women. But inequality persisted, and women were regarded as temporary or less-serious workers. At the Theta Sigma Phi convention in 1946, delegates required all chapters to eliminate any race restrictions from their bylaws.

By 1950, the group had grown to 47 campus chapters and 29 alumnae groups as more women began to work.

In 1964, Theta Sigma Phi established its headquarters in [[Austin, Texas]]. Jo Caldwell Meyer retired after serving as executive secretary for 24 years, leaving a legacy of leadership and personal attention to members' needs.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

In 1972, Theta Sigma Phi was renamed to '''Women in Communications, Inc.''' (WICI).&lt;ref name="Burt-2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sterling-2003" /&gt; That year, the organization also voted to admit men into membership.&lt;ref name="Marzolf-1977" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nadler-1987" /&gt;

In 1973, Women in Communications created an awards program (later named the '''Clarion Awards''') to recognize excellence in communications. A new monthly, National Newsletter joined ''The Matrix'' in recording the group's news. WICI joined the national ERA coalition to fight the mounting opposition to the [[Equal Rights Amendment]].

In 1979, WICI united with 11 communications organizations to found the First Amendment Congress, which works to preserve [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womcom.org/about_us/history70.asp |title=The 1970s: New name, new strengths |publisher=The Association for Women in Communications |date= |accessdate=March 25, 2014| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131204153732/http://www.womcom.org/about_us/history70.asp| archivedate= December 4, 2013|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WICI increasingly defended the freedoms of speech and the press. Leaders protested the news blackout during the invasion of Grenada and spoke out to Congress against proposed changes to the Freedom of Information Act. More than 100 chapters organized congressional letter-writing campaigns. WICI joined the National Committee on Pay Equity and awarded Rep. Mary Rose Oakar of Ohio an honorary membership because of her leadership on the issue.

In early 1988, the WICI Board of Directors moved the group's headquarters to Arlington, Va., just outside Washington, DC, to be closer to the seat of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womcom.org/about_us/history80.asp|title=The `80s: A Decade of Growth, Change and Leadership|publisher=Association for Women in Communications |date=| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131203004334/http://www.womcom.org/about_us/history80.asp| archivedate=December 3, 2013 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Membership peaked in the mid-1980s at around 13,000, and by 1995 the organization had around 8,000 members and significant debt.&lt;ref name="Drale-2003" /&gt;

WICI leaders instituted the Rising Star Award in 1990 for outstanding student members. Laura Glad, of [[California State University at Fullerton]], was the first recipient.  WICI delegates voiced support for the [[Civil Rights Act of 1991|Civil Rights Act]], which [[George H. W. Bush|President Bush]] signed in 1991, and the [[Family and Medical Leave Act]], which [[President Clinton]] signed in 1993. The end of the year saw a new partnership emerge between WICI and [[Capital Cities/ABC Inc.]] on its "Stop Sexual Harassment" campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.womcom.org/about_us/history90.asp |title=The 1990s: Embracing the Future |publisher=The Association for Women in Communications |date= |accessdate=March 25, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140423003424/http://www.womcom.org/about_us/history90.asp |archivedate=2014-04-23 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 WICI was dissolved, and the organization was renamed to the ''Association for Women in Communications''.&lt;ref name="Burt-2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kopecki-1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sterling-2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="whw-2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bulkeley-2004" /&gt; At that time, management of the organization was handed to a management firm, and finances stabilized under the new board and organization. The current firm is ASCENT Management in [[Alexandria, Virginia]]. The nonprofit AWC Matrix Foundation was established in 1998 as their educational affiliate.

The mission of the [http://www.matrixfoundation.us/ AWC Matrix Foundation], founded in 1997, is to promote the advancement of women in the communications profession by providing funds for education, research and publications. It carries out its educational and charitable goals in cooperation with the Association for Women in Communications.

Three Matrix Foundation initiatives are:
*Professional Certification Program recognizes excellence in all areas of communications; provides an opportunity to demonstrate communication and management skills and enhance employment/client potential.
*Edith Wortman First Amendment Award honors professional communicators for their efforts relating to First Amendment issues.
*Barbara Erickson Scholarship Fund gives college students an opportunity to meet and mingle with professional communicators by funding attendance at the AWC National Professional Conference.

'''BAMTech Media''' is a technology subsidiary of [[The Walt Disney Company]] located in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |first1=Brooks |last1= BARNES |first2= John |last2=KOBLIN |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/08/business/media/bamtech-disney-streaming.html |title=Disney’s Big Bet on Streaming Relies on Little-Known Tech Company |work=The New York Times |date=2017-10-08 |accessdate=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established in 2015 as a spin-off of [[MLB Advanced Media]]—the [[digital media]] arm of [[Major League Baseball]], focused on providing [[streaming video]] technology, particularly for [[over-the-top content]] (OTT) services. The company's major clients include [[ESPN]] (for its [[WatchESPN]] service), the NHL, [[HBO]] (for its [[HBO Now]] service), the [[PGA Tour]], [[Riot Games]] (for ''[[League of Legends]]'' [[e-sports]]), [[PlayStation Vue]], [[WWE Network]]&lt;ref name="variety-disneymaj"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2014/digital/news/hbo-cto-otto-berkes-resigns-as-network-enlists-mlb-to-build-ott-platform-1201375255/|title=HBO CTO Otto Berkes Resigns After Network Enlists MLB to Build OTT Platform|last=Spangler|first=Todd|date=December 9, 2014|work=Variety|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|access-date=August 9, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[TheBlaze]].

It was majority owned by MLB Advanced Media (which is, in turn, a consortium of MLB's [[List of Major League Baseball principal owners|principal team owners]]), with minority stakes held by the [[National Hockey League]] and other investors. Disney acquired a minority stake in the company in August 2016 for $1 billion, and the following year, announced its intent to increase its stake to a 75% controlling stake for $1.58 billion. The deal was approved by regulators in September 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.fiercecable.com/online-video/disney-gets-ok-from-ftc-for-1-58-billion-bamtech-buy|title=Disney gets OK from FTC for $1.58B BAMTech buy|last=Munson|first=Ben|date=September 20, 2017|newspaper=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|accessdate= September 20, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/washington/feds-ok-disneys-bamtech-buy/168773|title=Feds OK Disney's BAMTech Buy|last=Eggerton|first=John|date=September 20, 2017|newspaper=Variety|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|accessdate= September 20, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the acquisition of BAMTech by Disney, the company began to develop two subscription streaming services aligned with Disney properties: the sports-oriented service [[ESPN+]], and the upcoming entertainment service [[Disney+]].

==History==
===BAMTech Media===
BAMTech was founded in February 2015 through [[MLB Advanced Media]], spinning-out its streaming technology business into a separate company with outside investors. The formation of the company was approved by MLB Advanced Media's board of directors on August 13, 2015.&lt;ref name="Ben Popper"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/4/9090897/mlb-bam-live-streaming-internet-tv-nhl-hbo-now-espn|title=The Change Up: How baseball’s tech team built the future of television|author=Ben Popper|publisher=Vox Media|work=[[The Verge]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the plan, MLB-specific properties (such as MLB.com) would remain under league control.&lt;ref name=verge-mlbamspinoff&gt;{{cite web|title=MLB considers spinning off its powerful streaming business|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/23/8092439/mlb-considers-mlbam-spinoff|website=The Verge|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=August 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2016, [[The Walt Disney Company]] acquired a 1/3 stake in the company for $1 billion, with an option to acquire a majority stake in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ben Rains |url=https://www.sporttechie.com/disney-prepares-to-adapt-to-cord-cutters-with-new-mlbam-deal/ |title=Disney Prepares To Adapt To Cord Cutters With New MLBAM Deal |publisher=Sporttechie.com |date=2016-07-01 |accessdate=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lewin B. Barringer Memorial Trophy''' was established by the will of [[Lewin Barringer]] in 1948. The original rules specified that the trophy would be awarded for the longest distance [[Lift (soaring)|soaring]] flight from any type of launching method other than airplane tow. The trophy would become the permanent property of any pilot who won it three times in succession.&lt;ref name="March/April 1948 Soaring"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Barringer Trophy|journal=Soaring|date=March–April 1948|volume=12|issue=3-4|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Paul Bikle]] was the first pilot to win the Trophy three times in succession.  He subsequently donated the trophy back to the [[Soaring Society of America]] as a perpetual trophy.  In 1957 the SSA Directors, with Bikle's approval, changed the rules to allow for any type of launch method and include any flights, other than those flown at the US National Contest.&lt;ref name="Barringer Trophy Summary"&gt;{{cite web|title=Barringer Trophy Summary|url=http://www.ssa.org/myhome.asp?mbr=7262842059&amp;show=blog&amp;id=812#Performance|publisher=SSA|accessdate=12 July 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110716201938/http://www.ssa.org/myhome.asp?mbr=7262842059&amp;show=blog&amp;id=812| archivedate= 16 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Benetti''' is an [[Italy|Italian]] [[shipbuilding]] and [[boat|Boat building]] company based in [[Viareggio]], [[Livorno]], and [[Fano]], owned by [[Azimut Yachts|Azimut]].

Benetti designs and constructs [[motoryacht]]s, and is one of the leading builders of custom [[superyacht]]s, having won the ''Showboats International'' magazine "shipyard number 1" award six times in a row, the only yard to have done so.&lt;ref name="boatquest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boatquest.com/Benetti/boat_manufacturer.aspx|title=Benetti Yachts|publisher=boatquest.com|accessdate=2008-12-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516085054/http://www.boatquest.com/Benetti/boat_manufacturer.aspx|archivedate=2008-05-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Founded in 1873,&lt;ref name="Genesis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genesisny.net/Yatchs/YHistory.html|title=Benetti|publisher=Genesis Capital Management Group, Ltd.|accessdate=2008-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; when Lorenzo Benetti (1844–1914), bought the Darsena Luca shipyard to found the Benetti shipyard.&lt;ref name="boatquest"/&gt; The yard built commercial vessels,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.onboardonline.com/industry-article-index/shipbuild-and-repair/benetti-a-tradition-of-italian-yachtbuilding/ "Benetti: A Tradition of Italian Yachtbuilding"], ''Onboard Online'', 23 August 2015. Accessed 12 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; including fishing boats and Mediterranean trading ships. On his death in 1914, his sons Gino and Emilio took over, and renamed the yard Fratelli Benetti. They continued using wooden construction, but now built ocean-going ships, and some private yachts. After the death of Gino in 1927, his sons Gusieppe and Virgilio took over his share, while Maurizio and Bertani assisted their father Emilio.

===World War II===
During [[World War II]], the yard built medium-sized [[military]] vessels in steel, but due to highly effective bombing, the production was severely limited. After the war, and with restrictions on Italy on what she could produce militarily, the yard produced the first steel-hulled diesel powered vessel in the locality, the "Raphaelo". In 1954, Fratelli Benetti split its sailing and yacht business (Gino's family),&lt;ref name="boatquest"/&gt; from the commercial ship building business which continues under the name M&amp;B Benetti (Emilio's family). Emilio has a holding in both companies, and chairs both companies.

In 1963, Emilio died and the running of Fratelli Benetti was taken over by Gusieppe and his son Lorenzo. Lorenzo was the driver of the yacht business, moving instantly from wooden to steel construction, and designing three styles of yacht which brought the name Benetti to the world: the Delfino, the Tirreno and the Meditteraneo lines (from 18 to 33 metres). Demand for these vessels outstripped the capabilities of the yard. In 1978, the yard launched the "Viano", a sailing yacht which on corrected times won the [[Admirals Cup]]. In 1979, the yard launches "Nabila" for [[Adnan Khashoggi]], which at 83 metres and 2,465 tonnes was the largest yacht of its time.

===Sale to Azimut===
Lorenzo died in 1980 and the company fell into financial difficulties until 1984, when it was purchased by Paolo Vitelli, the owner of [[Azimut Yachts|Azimut]], who renamed it Benetti Shipyard.&lt;ref name="boatquest"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Genesis"/&gt; In 1988, Benetti built a ship to challenge for the transatlantic [[Blue Riband]] award but its efforts proved unsuccessful. The company is now part of the Azimut I Benetti group, also owner of Fraser Yachts&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fraseryachts.com/en/shipyard/benetti-yachts-for-sale/|title=Benetti yachts for sale {{!}} Benetti boats {{!}} Fraser Yachts|website=www.fraseryachts.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Viareggio]] is the historical shipyard, in 1990 Benetti took over the 47,000sq m Lusben yard to allow the construction of both the [[Azimut Yachts|Azimut]] range up to 100&amp;nbsp;ft, and the composite Benetti range and in 1997 was vastly expanded to {{convert|10000|m2|yd2}} to allow indoor building of yachts up to 70 m. In 2003 was acquired the area of the SEC yard which went bankrupt in the previous years in order to expand the production.

===Fano shipyard===
It was purchased the Siar-Moschino yard in [[Fano]] in 1998, taking the total capacity to {{convert|44000|m2|yd2}}. The yard has a 60 m wharf in the port.

===Livorno shipyard===
[[File:Livorno Benetti shipyard 03 @chesi.JPG|thumb|250px|Benetti Livorno shipyard toward Morosini Marina]]
Azimut-Benetti acquired the [[Cantiere navale fratelli Orlando]] in 2003 when the [[Livorno]] yard was in severe economic difficulties. The old shipyard has been partially demolished to make space for a residential and commercial area named ''Porta a Mare'' (Gate to sea), the part toward the entrance of the harbour was transformed with the construction of six huge sheds were to laid down the yachts. The Morosini slip was dismantled and was erected a [[Marina]] where to berth the yachts built. Benetti Livorno shipyard has a covered area of 30,000 sq m, a production area of 28,000 sq m, an open area of 130,000 sq m and a total area of 190,000 sq m.

==Benetti Models==
[[File:Galkynysh Yacht.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Galkynyş yacht]]]]
''Benetti Tradition'' is model of traditional yachts built by Benetti Yard. With [[fiberglass]] hull sizes up to 99 feet, powered by the [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]] C18 the maximum [[speed]] of Benetti Tradition 99 is 15 knots.

''Benetti Classic'' is a classical yacht, with a style very similar to those of Benetti Tradition but with a larger hull size. With [[fiberglass]] hull sizes up to 143feet, powered by the [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]] C30 with higher power of 1,650&amp;nbsp;hp (each), the maximum [[speed]] of Benetti Classic is 16 knots.

''Benetti Vision'' is a more modern style yacht with large measurements up to 143 feet. The beauty of this [[yacht]] is in the whole atmosphere and nice shape and exterior. Benetti Vision has two main engines of [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]] 3508B, with maximum power of 1,300&amp;nbsp;hp (each). This gives the yacht a maximum speed of 15 knots. This is a slightly less than Benetti Classic series, but with lower fuel consumption. The yacht is very beautiful designed interior with equipment for watersports and fishing.

''Benetti FB'' is the last series. This is the manufacturer's first series of [[luxury yacht|luxury yachts]]. Some of the names of the yachts built by Benetti in the series FB are called Amnesia, I Dinasty, Wind, Alibella and many more. All of these yachts are from the highest level of luxury, comfort and expenses.

In May 2010, Benetti yachts announced ''Benetti imagination'', which is first super yacht from Benetti’s new 47 meter line. Imagination is designed by Stefano Natucci and Francois Zuretti.&lt;ref name="htanna"&gt;{{cite web|title=Benetti launches 47m superyacht 'Imagination’|url=http://www.worldinteriordesignnetwork.com/news/benetti_launches_47m_superyacht_imagination_100528/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603033329/http://www.worldinteriordesignnetwork.com/news/benetti_launches_47m_superyacht_imagination_100528/|archivedate=2010-06-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 the company delivered a "Benetti Vision 145"—their 16th. It had a specification of 390 tons fully loaded.

In 2015, Benetti partnered with [[Henrik Fisker]] to launch new series of 164 ft super yachts called [[Benetti Fisker 50]].

A '''cost-plus contract''', also termed a '''cost reimbursement contract''', is a [[contract]] where a contractor is paid for all of its allowed expenses, ''plus'' additional [[payment]] to allow for a profit.&lt;ref name=CSIS2008&gt;[http://csis.org/files/media/csis/pubs/081016_diig_cost_plus.pdf Cost-Plus Contracts] [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]]&lt;/ref&gt; Cost-reimbursement contracts contrast with [[fixed-price contract]], in which the contractor is paid a negotiated amount regardless of incurred expenses.

== History ==
[[Frank Bunker Gilbreth Sr.|Frank B. Gilbreth]], one of the founders of industrial engineering, used "cost-plus-a-fixed sum" contracts in his building contracting business.&lt;ref name="Lancaster2004"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lancaster |first=Jane |title=Making Time: Lillian Moller Gilbreth, a Life Beyond "Cheaper by the Dozen" |year=2004 |publisher=Northeastern University Press |page=79 |isbn=978-1-55553-612-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described this method in an article in ''Industrial Magazine'' in 1907, comparing it to [[fixed price contract|fixed price]] and [[guaranteed maximum price]] methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gilbreth |first=Frank B. |title=The 'Cost-Plus-a-Fixed-Sum' Contract |journal=Industrial Magazine |year=1907 |volume=6 |pages=31–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cost-plus contracts first came into use by the government in the United States during the World Wars to encourage wartime production by large American companies. According to Martin Kenney, they "allowed what were then small technology firms like [[Hewlett-Packard]] and [[Fairchild Semiconductor]] to charge the [[U.S. Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] for the price of research and development that none could pay on its own. This enabled the firms to create technology products that eventually created entire new markets and economic sectors".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/martin-kenney-warns-that-the-nsa-s-actions-are-undermining-the-american-it-sector-s-global-dominance|title = Silicon Valley’s Spy Problem|last = Kenney|first = Martin|date = 2 July 2014|work = Project Syndicate|accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
There are four general types of cost-reimbursement contracts, all of which pay every allowable, allocatable, and reasonable cost incurred by the contractor, plus a fee or profit which differs by contract type.
*'''Cost plus fixed-fee''' ('''CPFF''') contracts pay a pre-determined fee that was agreed upon at the time of contract formation.
*'''[[Cost-plus-incentive fee]]''' ('''CPIF''') contracts have a larger fee awarded for contracts which meet or exceed performance targets, including any cost savings.&lt;ref name=CSIS2008 /&gt; 
*'''Cost-plus-award fee''' ('''CPAF''') contracts pay a fee based upon the contractor's work performance.  In some contracts, the fee is determined subjectively by an awards fee board whereas in others the fee is based upon objective performance metrics.  An aircraft development contract, for example, may pay award fees if the contractor achieves certain speed, range, or payload capacity goals.
*'''Cost plus percentage of cost''' pay a fee that rises as the contractor's cost rise.  Because this contract type provides no incentive for the contractor to control costs it is rarely utilized. The U.S. [[Federal Acquisition Regulations]] specifically prohibit the use of this type for U.S. Federal Government contracting (FAR Part 16.102).

==Usage==
A cost-reimbursement contract is appropriate when it is desirable to shift some [[risk]] of successful contract performance from the contractor to the buyer.  It is most commonly used when the item purchased cannot be explicitly defined, as in [[research and development]], or in cases where there is not enough data to accurately estimate the final cost.

==Pros and cons==
'''Advantages:'''
* A cost-plus contract is often used when performance, quality or delivery time is a much higher concern than cost, such as in the [[United States space program]].&lt;ref name="Poole" /&gt;
* Final cost may be less than a [[fixed price contract]] because contractors do not have to inflate the price to cover their risk, especially when the ability to estimate costs is low.&lt;ref name="Poole" /&gt;
* Final cost may be less than a fixed price contract when there is little market or price competition.&lt;ref name="Poole" /&gt;
* Allows more oversight and control over the quality of the contractor's work.&lt;ref name="Poole" /&gt;
* Flexible, allowing for changes in specification.&lt;ref name="Poole"&gt;{{cite book  |last = Poole |first = Walter S. | title =Adapting to Flexible Response 1960-1968  |series=History of Acquisition in the Department of Defense | date = 2013  | location = Washington, DC  | publisher = Cambridge University Press  | isbn =  978-0-16-092183-4  |oclc=877851275 |pp=50–52, 76–85 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Disadvantages:'''
* There is limited certainty as to what the final cost will be.&lt;ref name="Poole" /&gt;
* Requires additional oversight and administration to ensure that only permissible costs are paid and that the contractor is exercising adequate overall cost controls.&lt;ref name="Poole" /&gt;

==Recent trends==
Between 1995 and 2001 fixed fee cost-plus contracts constituted the largest subgroup of cost-plus contracting in the U.S. defense sector. Starting in 2002 award-fee cost plus contracts took over the lead from fixed fee cost plus contracts.

The distribution of annual contract values by sector category and award types indicates that cost plus contracts in the past carried the largest importance in research, followed by services and products. In 2004, however, services replaced research as the dominant sector category for cost-plus contracts. For all other contract vehicles combined the relative ranking is reversed to the original cost-plus order, meaning that products lead, followed by service and research.

With cost-plus contracting being primarily designed for research and development, the percentage of cost-plus contracting within a contract is expected to be correlated to the percentage share of research undertaken in any given program. However, several programs, such as the [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II]], [[UGM-133 Trident II]], [[Nimitz-class aircraft carrier|CVN-68]], and the [[Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carrier|CVN-21]] deviate from this pattern by continuing to make extensive usage of cost-plus contracting despite programs progressively moving beyond the research and development state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.csis.org/diig/flashvideo/index.html Defense Industrial Initiatives Group – Cost-plus Contracting Narrated Slide Show] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417074619/http://media.csis.org/diig/flashvideo/index.html |date=2009-04-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''counterparty''' (sometimes '''contraparty''') is a [[Juristic person|legal entity]], [[unincorporated entity]], or collection of entities to which an exposure to [[financial risk]] might exist. The word became widely used in the 1980s, particularly at the time of the [[Basel I]] in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas J. Sargent|Sargent, T. J.]], and Velde, F. R., ''The Big Problem of Small Change'' ([[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]] and [[Oxford]]: [[Princeton University Press]], 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

Well-drafted contracts usually attempt to spell out in explicit detail what each counterparty's rights and obligations are in every conceivable circumstance, though there are limits. There are general provisions for how counterparties are treated under the law, and (at least in [[common law]] legal systems) there are many [[legal precedent]]s that shape the common law.

==Financial services sector==
Within the [[financial services]] sector, the term '''market counterparty''' is used to refer to [[government]]s, [[national bank]]s, national monetary authorities and international monetary organisations such as the [[World Bank Group]] that act as the ultimate guarantor for loans and indemnities. The term may also be applied, in a more general sense, to companies acting in this role.

Also within financial services, counterparty can refer to brokers, [[investment bank]]s, and other securities dealers that serve as the  contracting party when completing [[Over-the-counter (finance)|"over the counter"]] securities transactions.  The term is generally used in this context in relation to "[[counterparty risk]]", which is the risk of monetary loss a firm may be exposed to if the counterparty to an over-the-counter securities trade encounters difficulty meeting its obligations under the terms of the transaction.

==Insurance sector==
Within the [[insurance]] sector, this term is extended to include companies offering or requiring high-level [[Reinsurance#Retrocession|retrocession]] of insurance risk to insurance companies in a role similar to that offered by governments. This term, over time, has become more generally applied to companies offering or requiring retrocession and other forms of [[reinsurance]].

'''Digital mailroom''' is the [[automation]] of incoming mail processes. Using [[document scanning]] and [[document capture]] technologies, companies can [[Digitization|digitise]] incoming mail and automate the classification and distribution of mail within the organization. Both paper and [[electronic mail]] (email) can be managed through the same process allowing companies to standardize their [[internal mail]] distribution procedures and adhere to company [[compliance (regulation)|compliance]] policies.

Many companies still believe that they are legally bound to archive some [[document]]s as paper for a certain time, such as [[accounting]] documents or [[contract]]s. According to a recent survey by [[Association for Information and Image Management|AIIM]], [[Admissible evidence|legal admissibility]] of scanned documents is still seen as an issue in over a quarter of businesses. However, the reality is that these rules only apply to a small minority of documents. Most digitized documents are now legally admissible in a [[court of law]]. The new [[British Standards|British Standard]], BS 10008 "Evidential weight and legal admissibility of electronic information" covers this in detail. The culture of 'avoiding risk at all cost' is what compels companies to print and archive thousands of documents every day.

==Reasons for implementation==

Mail volumes continue to grow exponentially,{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} stimulated by business growth and mobile [[workforce]]s. For example, medium-sized companies now process 100,000 pieces of mail a month and service over 200 departments. In addition, the corporate mailroom, a vital link in the corporate information system, is struggling to keep abreast of this paper flow. Meanwhile, today's organisations demand instant, accurate information; US businesses spend over $500 billion annually turning the information on the documents they receive every day into useful data that they can use to run their business.

The need for corporate [[compliance (regulation)|compliance]] and [[accountability]] has also forced large [[corporation]]s to invest heavily in information backup, storage systems, and compliance solutions. Some corporate mailrooms have benefited from the development of high-speed automation equipment designed for moving physical mail more efficiently through the system. However, the challenges are daunting, considering that most mailrooms are using one-piece-at-a-time visual identification and manual sorting methods.
 
By digitizing the incoming mail process, and indexing the documents on the fly, companies can not only gain control of their mail processes internally (no more [[efficiency]] losses, gaps in [[document control]] and loss of valuable mail), but will have the opportunity to combine electronic mail formats (e-mail, [[fax]]) in the same document processing flow. A digital mailroom designed as a central platform for information allows an organization to bring [[rationality]] to mail processing and significant gains in productivity and [[customer service]].

==Benefits==

===Reducing the decision cycle===
One major benefit of turning all incoming paper mail into images as soon as it is received, is the extent to which it shortens the [[decision cycle]]. Although it might be difficult to quantify exactly what the cost savings are, it seems an obvious advantage. Digital mailrooms allow users to receive immediate notification of a document's arrival at the company. Employees can access images in record time, regardless of where the documents were physically acquired. Files can then be processed very rapidly according to their level of urgency. Just as digital mailrooms facilitate the exchange of company information, they also facilitate the coordination of several people around the same document. The [[decision-making]] process becomes quicker and more accurate.

===Rationalising the circulation of information===
The various technologies at the heart of digital mailrooms help companies rationalise their processes, e.g. it allows companies to reduce costs associated with resending documents between sites.

===Reducing paper costs===
Mailroom costs not only include staff costs involved in the distribution of letters, but also the costs associated with the resending, loss or deterioration of documents. A digital mailroom implementation has a direct effect on all those costs and becomes a key element of [[competitiveness]] for the company. 
Another source of paper costs is the one associated with the physical storage of documents. 
Encouraging employees "to do without paper" will quickly lead to the reduction in the cost of excessive [[printing]] and copying of documents. The aim is obviously not to ban paper from the work environment but rather to set up a new coherent and secure organisation that makes the use of paper superfluous.

===Ensuring data tracking===
Ensuring incoming mail tracking has become a necessity for the majority of companies, with compliance regulation being a major factor. The earlier a document is transformed into an [[image file]], the more reliably it can be tracked throughout its life cycle. Furthermore, a scanned document becomes accessible by all authorised users (as a PDF, TIFF or JPEG file). The file created includes more than simply images; it references one or more documents in the archive database and records all the actions carried out by the people responsible for the file.
The security of the process guarantees the [[wikt:authenticity|authenticity]] and integrity of the document, which aligns with the [[records management]] policy of the company.

===Improving customer service===
The electronic management of incoming mail improves the handling of documents within [[Service-orientation|service oriented]] companies and agencies. It enhances the quality of the service offered to [[customer]]s by allowing staff to instantly access customer files and answer questions immediately. The improvement of customer service is considered to be of fundamental importance by the majority of companies.

==Technologies==

===Document capture===
"Document capture" is the act of scanning paper documents so they can be archived and retrieved in their original image format. It is the most widespread [[imaging technology]] used by companies today.
[[Software]] improvements now make it possible to capture paper documents while importing [[electronic file]]s and to process them together through the same [[production platform]]. Both incoming paper and electronic mail can now be archived together at the same storage location.
Another major change is the ability to scan documents from remote locations and to retrieve them through a [[web interface]]. This is known as distributed capture and provides many cost benefits to companies with multiple [[branch office]]s or remotely located staff.

===Data capture===
Originally, forms processing technologies were only able to extract and validate data from structured documents such as administrative forms.
The improvements in OCR technology now make it possible to automatically extract all data from semi-structured documents (e.g. Invoices) – the technical acronym for this is Intelligent Document Capture (IDC). 
For fully unstructured documents (e.g. legal contracts, customer correspondence, and white mail), it is not yet possible to locate and extract all information. However, technologies have improved enough to identify the document type and automatically extract key information that can be used to index the document and/or route the document to the right department or recipient.

===Document classification===
Software using a graphical approach can analyze and classify mixed batches of structured or semi-structured documents in order to build a library of templates. Using this auto-generated library of templates, the software can then identify and extract data from any scanned document in a single flow.
This image-based classification approach, combined with a full-text analysis of certain documents (based on a keyword search), are the main technologies used today to process semi- or unstructured documents.
These innovative automatic classification technologies reduce the need for pre-sorting documents before the scanning process. As a result, companies receiving high volumes of paper mail can make significant cost reductions every year.

===Workflow===
[[Workflow]] applications enable electronic documents and information to circulate inside the company. They might have to manage very complex processes related to multiple locations due to the globalization of companies. The increasing importance of security is another vital challenge. 
One of the key developments in workflow technologies is around making company processes and workflow processes more consistent in order to avoid organizational changes when implementing these tools. Although company organizations tend to become increasingly complex, these software solutions are becoming simpler in terms of implementation and interfaces.

===Archiving===
Due to the high volume of documents that need to be archived by organizations today, it is critical that the documents can be stored rapidly, securely managed and quickly retrieved through a common user interface.
Documents can usually be archived on a variety of electronic storage media and easily retrieved through a Web interface (thin client).
There are many archiving solutions on the market today, some as a component of an ECM or document management solution and some as a stand-alone system specifically designed for the purpose of high volume, high speed archiving.

===Document and content management===
A document can be an image, a file stored and compressed in a tiff, gif or jpg electronic exchange format, or an MS Office file or a PDF file (Acrobat exchange format).  
Content generally includes all the above combined with any data/information as well as other electronic files such as e-mails and web pages.
Content Management solutions need back-end repositories or databases (e.g. Oracle or MS SQL Server) to store the files and retrieval data.
During the last decade, these software solutions have benefited from the universal XML standard used to index, store and access files to and from any repository.
Relative to the others systems, content management systems manage more complex administrative, access and workflow rules in relation to the quantity of files and file formats it needs to support.

==Evolution of hardware==

The range of hardware available to turn paper documents into digital images has increased considerably in the last 10 years. Although desktop scanners and multi-function devices (MFDs) are now very affordable and well suited to small office or departmental scanning requirements, the need for high speed, high volume document scanners is still evident. The speed, reliability and increased functionality of these high-end scanners can save considerable time and money in the long term.

Today, it is possible to scan documents of different dimensions and formats in the same flow, scan colour documents, sort them physically and read data from them using OCR and barcode technologies during the scanning process. Processing speed has also significantly increased.
This evolution, together with the existence of machines able to completely automate mail processing – opening envelopes, removing staples, scanning, sorting – play a significant role in the development of large volume paper processing such as mail processing.

The next step for companies is to rationalize their mail processing to be as consistent as possible with their organizational structure, e.g. choosing between the implementation of a centralized digital mailroom and the implementation of decentralized mail scanning facilities or a combination of the two.

==Adoption==

According to a survey conducted by AIIM in 2009, centralized in-house scanning and mailroom scanning are set for a considerable growth in take up compared to outsourced scanning and capture. 48% of the survey respondents have a centralized, in-house scanning service, citing better indexing and closer integration with the process as the main benefits.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3671">'''Dirk Dirksen''' (August 25, 1937 – November 20, 2006) was a [[music promoter]] and [[emcee]] of the [[San Francisco]] [[punk rock]] clubs [[Mabuhay Gardens]] and On Broadway in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Dirksen was nicknamed the "Pope of Punk."

Dirksen was born in [[Braunschweig]], Germany and immigrated to the US in 1948. He was a nephew of United States Senator [[Everett Dirksen]].&lt;ref name="moore"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.eroplay.com/dirkseninterview.html |title=Interview with Dirk Dirksen |first=Frank |last=Moore |periodical=eroplay.com |year=1995 |accessdate=2008-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served in the Army, briefly attended [[San Jose State University]], and entered the entertainment business in the late 1950s, hosting a live television show called ''Rocket to Stardom''. He then worked as a tour manager for several 1960s rock and soul acts. In 1974, he began to book acts at the Mabuhay Gardens in San Francisco's [[North Beach, San Francisco|North Beach]], and began booking local punk acts ([[The Sheets]], [[Crime (band)|Crime]], Mary Monday, etc.) along with soon-to-be-famous national and international talent, such as [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]], [[The Ramones]], [[Devo]], [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], and [[Dead Kennedys|The Dead Kennedys]]. From 1979 to 1982, he wrote and directed ''Amapola Presents Show'', a weekly magazine–variety show on KEMO-TV, Channel 20. The show starred Filipina superstar Amapola with co-host Ness Aquino—Mabuhay Gardens' owner. ''Amapola Presents Show'' became Dirk Dirksen's showcase for local punk acts, local Bay Area bands and artists, and a group of Bay Area actors called "The Straight People." Dirksen gained some negative notoriety for allegedly ripping off SoCal punk rock bands Youth Brigade and Social Distortion while on their independent summer 1982 tour, and further taunting them by giving them rolls of pennies, as documented in the documentary [[Another State of Mind (film)|Another State of Mind]].

After leaving the Mabuhay Gardens, he operated the On Broadway nightclub just upstairs from the Mabuhay. When the On Broadway was closed in 1984, Dirksen went into video production with his firm, Dirksen-Molloy Productions, which he owned with his [[domestic partner]] [[Damon Molloy]].&lt;ref name="sfgate"&gt;{{citation |first=Joel |last=Selvin |authorlink=Joel Selvin |url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/11/22/BAGCJMHQ8B1.DTL |title=Dirk Dirksen – 'pope of punk' amused, insulted S.F. crowds |periodical=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=November 22, 2006 |accessdate=2008-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dirksen was also active with the organization [[H.E.A.R.]] (Hearing Education and Awareness for Rockers).

In April 2006, he hosted a Mabuhay reunion event at the Fillmore Auditorium, featuring members of the [[Dead Kennedys]], [[The Mutants (San Francisco)|The Mutants]], [[Flipper (band)|Flipper]], and [[The Contractions]]. Later that year, he died in his sleep of an apparent heart attack at age 69.

On November 12, 2008, an official measure was passed to rename Rowland Street for him.

[[File:Rialto Theater-Tacoma.jpg|thumb|The Rialto Theater, in the heart of downtown Tacoma]]
'''Downtown Tacoma''' is approximately bounded by east-west by A Street and Tacoma Avenue, and north-south by South 7th Street and South 25th Street, in the inner Northeast section of [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]].  The center of downtown is the intersection of 9th and Broadway.  The city [[Christmas tree]] is located here as well.

== Downtown ==
Downtown Tacoma's mid-century downturn was exacerbated by the opening of the Tacoma Mall on May 16, 1968.  Many of the anchor retail stores left the downtown to relocate to the mall.

== Revitalization efforts and progress ==
Following the exodus of retailers to the [[Tacoma Mall]] in the late 1960s, city leadership attempted to make downtown more appealing to shoppers by building two large parking garages and by closing off to traffic two blocks of Broadway Street between South 9th and South 11th Streets.  The Broadway Mall was less successful than hoped and the street was re-opened to traffic during the 1980s.

Later revitalization efforts were centered around the renovation of Union Station in 1990, which became Tacoma's federal courthouse, coupled with the opening of [[University of Washington Tacoma]]. The University of Washington rejected a greenfield site for its new South Puget Sound campus and, instead, decided to restore six historic warehouses in a dilapidated district on the edge of downtown Tacoma. Today, the area is a thriving museum and university district. Retail and restaurants have returned and downtown is undergoing a renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = McMahon|first = E. T.|date = 2000|title = School sprawl.|url =|journal = Planning Commissioners Journal|issue = 39|pages = 16–18|doi =|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The addition of the [[Museum of Glass]], [[Tacoma Art Museum]], and the [[Washington State History Museum]] added much life to the area.

The Tacoma City Council passed the Local Improvement District for St. Helens Street in April 2006 which was designed to improve areas which have been neglected.  The LID is expected to start in 2008.  Also central to the revitalization effort has been the city's adoption of the [[tax exemption]] for new residential units in multifamily dwellings, primarily apartments and condominiums.  Starting in 2002, downtown Tacoma began seeing an increase in the number of residential units being built or renovated downtown.  Buildings such as the Perkins Building, Harmon Lofts, and Cliff Street were renovated for living units.

A new regional [[convention center]], the [[Greater Tacoma Convention and Trade Center]], opened in 2004.

== Historic buildings ==
Downtown Tacoma is well known for historic buildings most built at the end of the 19th century.  The buildings include the Old City Hall Building, Union Station, Elks Temple, Bostwick Building, the Winthrop Hotel and the Pythian Temple, which houses [[Seabury School#Middle school|Seabury Middle School]].  The Mecca Theater is currently being restored.

'''Earl Winfrey Brian, Jr.''' (born 1942) is an American businessman who served as Director of [[California Department of Health Care Services|California's Department of Health Care Services]], and then as Secretary of California's Agency for Health and Welfare under Governor [[Ronald Reagan]]. Following an unsuccessful run for the U. S. Senate in 1974, Brian headed several technology based firms during the 1970s and 80s.  In 1991 however, Infotechnology, the venture capital firm he headed, filed for bankruptcy. Brian was later charged with conspiring to cover up the firm's financial difficulties and sentenced to four years in prison.

==Early career==
Brian graduated from medical school at Duke University and served in the Army Medical Corps in Vietnam.&lt;ref name = "Background"&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0458-3035| last = Peterson| first = Jonathan| title = New Chief of UPI Has a Background in Politics and Information Business| work = Los Angeles Times| accessdate = 2017-05-20| date = 1988-02-22| url = http://articles.latimes.com/print/1988-02-22/business/fi-30117_1_financial-news-network}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Political career in California==
After leaving the service in 1970, he was appointed first as Director of California's [[California Department of Health Care Services|Department of Health Care Services]] (DHCS), then Secretary of Health and Welfare. During his term as secretary, Brian succeeded in implementing a requirement for a $2 co-payment from Medi-Cal recipients for each doctor’s visit,&lt;ref name="Skelton"&gt;{{cite news

but failed in an attempt to curtail medical benefits available under Medi-Cal when the state lost a suit brought by the [[California Medical Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = California Medical Assn. v.

In 1974 Brian resigned his cabinet post and ran for the [[U.S. Senate]] seat held by Senator [[Alan Cranston]] (D&amp;ndash;CA), but lost the Republican primary.&lt;ref name="Background" /&gt;

==Business and expansion==
Brian then turned to business and in 1980 established his own company, Biotech Capital, a venture capital firm that invested in companies developing medical technology.&lt;ref name = "Perry"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Perry| first = Nancy J.| title = To the rescue| work = Fortune article archive| accessdate = 2017-05-20| date = 1988-03-28| url = http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1988/03/28/70351/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Biotech later shifted its focus to news and information services, acquiring interest in the [[Financial News Network]] (FNN) and changing the name Biotech in 1987 to Infotechnology.&lt;ref name = "Perry" /&gt;.  In 1988, the company acquired [[United Press International]], one of the two major American news wire services at the time.&lt;ref name = "Background" /&gt;

==Conspiracy and fraud conviction==
Infotechnology encountered financial difficulties and filed for bankruptcy in 1991, as did FNN and UPI.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Jones| first = Alex S.| title = THE MEDIA BUSINESS; U.P.I.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10103">'''Education policy''' consists of the principles and government policies in the educational sphere as well as the collection of laws and rules that govern the operation of [[education]] systems.

Or simply we can say that An Education Policy is a past or up to date statement or series of statements which explain, recommend or exclude a course of action or actions to be taken to run the system of education. These statements are usually written, but they could be oral. 

Education occurs in many forms for many purposes through many institutions.  Examples include [[early childhood education]], [[kindergarten]] through to 12th grade, two and four year colleges or universities, graduate and professional education, adult education and job training. Therefore, education policy can directly affect the education people engage in at all ages.

Examples of areas subject to debate in education policy, specifically from the field of schools, include school size, class size, school choice, school [[privatization]], tracking, teacher selection, education and certification, teacher pay, teaching methods, curricular content, graduation requirements, school infrastructure investment, and the values that schools are expected to uphold and model.

Issues in education policy also address problems within higher education. The Pell Institute analyzes the barriers experienced by teachers and students within community colleges and universities. These issues involve undocumented students, sex education, and federal grant aides.&lt;ref&gt;American Psychiatric Association. (2000). Practice guidelines for the treatment of patients with eating disorders (2nd ed). Washington, DC: Author.&lt;/ref&gt;

Education policy analysis is the scholarly study of education policy.  It seeks to answer questions about the purpose of education, the objectives (societal and personal) that it is designed to attain, the methods for attaining them and the tools for measuring their success or failure. Research intended to inform education policy is carried out in a wide variety of institutions and in many academic disciplines.  Important researchers are affiliated with departments of [[psychology]], [[economics]], [[sociology]], and [[Developmental psychology|human development]], in addition to schools and departments of education or public policy.  Examples of education policy analysis may be found in such [[academic journal]]s as ''[[Education Policy Analysis Archives]]'' and in university policy centers such as the [[National Education Policy Center]] housed at the University of Colorado Boulder [[University of Colorado Boulder]].

== Education reform in the United States ==

[[Education reform]] is a topic that is in the mainstream currently in the United States.  Over the past 30 years, policy makers have made a steady increase at the state and federal levels of government in their involvement of US schools.  US states spend most of their budgets funding schools, whereas only a small portion of the federal budget is allocated to education.&lt;ref&gt;Coggins, C. (2017). ''How to be heard: 10 lessons teachers need to advocate for their students and profession''. San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt; Although states hold the constitutional right on education policy, the federal government is advancing their role by building on state and local education policies.&lt;ref name="eds.a.ebscohost.com"&gt;{{Cite web|title = EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page|url = http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=4c281704-1acd-4d75-a285-cc3161b5fac8%2540sessionmgr4005&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=4208|website = eds.a.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the state of Texas during the 84th Legislature, there were several education reform bills filed and sponsored by many education reform groups, such as Texans for Education Reform.  Lawmakers want to create more involvement at the local level, and more transparency in our public schools.  These groups are being pressured and opposed by teachers' unions saying that accountability and transparency policies are targeting educators, and that they are trying to hold them responsible for the education system.&lt;ref name="eds.a.ebscohost.com"/&gt;

== Teacher policy ==
Teacher policy is education policy that addresses the preparation, recruitment, and retention of teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/education/themes/strengthening-education-systems/quality-framework/technical-notes/teacher-policies/|title=Teacher policies: Preparation, Recruitment and Retention of Quality Teachers/Educators|last=UNESCO|first=|date=|website=UNESCO|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A teacher policy is guided by the same overall vision and essential characteristics as the wider education policy: it should be strategic, holistic, feasible, sustainable, and context-sensitive. Overall objectives and major challenges to be addressed, the funding to achieve these objectives, the demographic parameters of the learner population and the human resources required to achieve universally accessible quality education should all be addressed in a comprehensive teacher policy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002352/235272e.pdf|title=Teacher policy development guide: summary|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=14, 18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nine key dimensions ===
Nine key dimensions are considered crucial to any comprehensive teacher policy: Teacher Recruitment and Retention, Teacher education (initial and continuing), Deployment, Career Structures/Paths, Teacher Employment and Working Conditions, Teach Reward and Remuneration, Teacher Standards, Teacher Accountability, and School Governance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Teacher Recruitment and Retention ====
An effective education system must have a way to attract and retain outstanding educators. There has been a growing demand for teachers but the supply continues to diminish and many of them leave their profession&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/11/27/why-its-a-big-problem-that-so-many-teachers-quit-and-what-to-do-about-it/|title=Analysis {{!}} Why it’s a big problem that so many teachers quit — and what to do about it|last=Strauss|first=Valerie|date=2017-11-27|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-06-30|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The federal and state governments along with the districts must invest in complete human capital systems. It is the best approach in preparing and retaining committed and capable mentors for the long-term&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://learningpolicyinstitute.org/product/solving-teacher-shortage-brief|title=Solving the Teacher Shortage How to Attract and Retain Excellent Educators|website=Learning Policy Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A reasonable strategy in talent management for the education sector must focus on recruitment, development, and retention of intelligent and efficient teachers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.edweek.org/topschooljobs/k-12_talent_manager/2015/02/balanced_recruitment_retention.html?cmp=SOC-SHR-FB|title=7 Steps for a Balanced Recruitment AND Retention Strategy|last=Douglas|first=Emily|website=Education Week - K-12 Talent Manager|access-date=2018-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==== Teacher Education (Initial and Continuing) ====
Teachers need to go back to school periodically to become better educators&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.goethe.de/en/spr/mag/21047328.html|title=“Continuing education must be in-depth”|work=@GI_weltweit|access-date=2018-06-30|language=en-EN}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Good mentors can become outstanding by going further than textbooks. This is the logic behind continuing education.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5355">'''Enterprise social software''' (also known as or regarded as a major component of [[Enterprise 2.0]]), comprises [[social software]] as used in "[[Business|enterprise]]" (business/[[commerce|commercial]]) contexts.  It includes social and networked modifications to corporate [[intranet]]s and other classic [[software]] platforms used by large companies to organize their [[communication]].  In contrast to traditional [[enterprise software]], which imposes structure prior to use, enterprise social software tends to encourage use prior to providing structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Makkonen | first1 = H. | last2 = Virtanen | first2 = K. | year = 2015 | title = Social capital approach on Enterprise 2.0: a multiple case study | doi = 10.1080/09537325.2015.1061120 | journal = Technology Analysis &amp; Strategic Management| volume =  27| issue = | pages =  1212–1225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carl Frappaolo and Dan Keldsen defined Enterprise 2.0 in a report written for [[Association for Information and Image Management]] (AIIM) as "a [[system]] of [[World Wide Web|web]]-based [[technology|technologies]] that provide rapid and agile collaboration, information sharing, emergence and integration capabilities in the extended enterprise".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

=== Functionality ===

Social software for an enterprise must (according to [[Andrew McAfee]], Associate Professor, [[Harvard Business School]]) have the following functionality to work well {{Harv|McAfee|2006}}:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;McAfee, Andrew, P. "Enterprise 2.0: The Dawn of Emergent Collaboration" (MIT Sloan Management Review), Spring 2006, Vol.47, No.3&lt;/ref&gt;

* Search: allowing users to search for other users or content
* Links: grouping similar users or content together
* Authoring: including blogs and wikis
* Tags: allowing users to [[tag (metadata)|tag]] content
* Extensions: recommendations of users; or content based on profile
* Signals: allowing people to subscribe to users or content with RSS feeds

McAfee recommends installing easy-to-use software which does not impose any rigid structure on users. He envisages an informal [[roll-out]], but on a common platform to enable future collaboration between areas. He also recommends strong and visible [[management|managerial]] support to achieve this.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2007 [[Dion Hinchcliffe]] expanded the list above by adding the following four functions:&lt;ref&gt;*Hinchcliffe, Dion. [http://www.zdnet.com/blog/hinchcliffe/the-state-of-enterprise-2-0/143 "The state of Enterprise 2.0"], ''ZDNET.com'', London, October 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Freeform function: no barriers to authorship (meaning free from a learning curve or from restrictions)
# Network-oriented function, requiring web-addressable content in all cases
# Social function: stressing transparency (to access), diversity (in content and community members) and openness (to structure)
# Emergence function: requiring the provision of approaches that detect and leverage the collective wisdom of the community

[[Enterprise search]] differs from a typical web search in its focus on "use within an organization by employees seeking information held internally, in a variety of formats and locations, including databases, [[document management system]]s, and other [[wikt:repository|repositories]]".&lt;ref&gt;"Enterprise Search: Seek and Ye Might Find", ''Computers in Libraries'', July/August 2008, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism ===

There has been recent criticism that the adaptation of the social paradigm (e.g. openness and altruistic behavior) does not always work well for the enterprise setting, which led some authors to question the proper functioning of enterprise social software.&lt;ref&gt;Wang Y, Greaseley A, Thanassoulis E (2011). Combining ERP Systems with Enterprise 2.0, in P. Powell and R. Martinho (eds.) Enterprise Information Systems, Heidelberg: Springer, pp. 198–207&lt;/ref&gt; The findings from a novel study suggests that free and non-anonymous sharing of trusted information (beyond marketing or product information) is significantly influenced by concerns from business users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mettler T, Winter R |title=Are business users social? A design experiment exploring information sharing in enterprise social systems |journal=Journal of Information Technology  |year=2016 |doi=10.1057/jit.2015.28 |volume=31 |pages=101–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The European Parliament of Enterprises''' (EPE) is an event for European corporations, organized by [[Eurochambres]], the Association of European Chambers of Commerce and Industry, once every two years. The first edition of the event was launched on 14 October 2008 on the occasion of Eurochambres' fiftieth anniversary.

==Concept==
The concept of the European Parliament of Enterprises originated from the consideration, that there is a democratic gap between the [[European institutions]] and the main actors of economic growth, entrepreneurs and that, consequently, European legislators do not sufficiently take into account entrepreneurs' concerns. 
On the other hand, businesses are largely unfamiliar with the role and functioning of the [[European Union]] and the significance that the institutions’ decisions can have on their activities and results.

==Participants==
751 entrepreneurs, or Members of the European Parliament of Enterprises (MEPEs), gather in the symbolic location of the [[Espace Léopold|Hemicycle]] of the [[European Parliament]]. The composition of the EPE reflects the number of Members of the European Parliament per member state.

==Aims and objectives==
The EPE aims to bring businesses and institutions face-to-face for one day so as to enhance mutual understanding. The EPE represents a unique opportunity for businesses to have a direct debate with high European representatives and to provide them with a direct bottom-up feedback on EU policy related issues.

==Votes==
During the EPE, Members of the European Parliament of Enterprises exercise their voting rights on major EU business-related issues.
The results of the votes are presented by Eurochambres to the relevant political interlocutors from all of the EU institutions as "the voice of European businesses”.
The "European Parliament of Enterprises” is organised with the active cooperation of Eurochambres' members, the national associations of [[Chamber of commerce|Chambers of Commerce &amp; Industry]].

The '''Fiduciary Institute of Southern Africa''' (FISA) is a non-profit professional organisation. It represents [[fiduciary]] practitioners and sets high minimum standards for the industry .&lt;ref&gt;Personal Finance databank&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;You magazine, 16 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation and activities==
FISA was formed in 2008, when the Association of Trust Companies in South Africa (ATCSA), which was formed in 1932, was converted to a professional institute with individual membership.  A new constitution was adopted to reflect the change of name and membership. Prior to the change, members were the main [[trust companies]] in South Africa on a corporate membership basis.  After the change, members include employees of trust companies and individuals from the legal, accounting and financial planning professions.

FISA has approximately 700 individual members, who collectively manage assets in excess of R250 billion. They draft tens of thousand [[Wills]] each year and administer around 50 percent of deceased estates reported to the offices of the [http://www.justice.gov.za/master/m_main.htm Master of the High Court] in [[South Africa]].

Activities of FISA members include [[estate planning]], the drafting of Wills], administration of trusts and estates, [[beneficiary fund]]s, tax and financial advice and the management of client funds.

The organization is governed by a 10-person Council; the current Chairperson is Eben Nel. Regional councilors represent the regions of [[Gauteng]], [[Western Cape]], [[Eastern Cape]], [[KwaZulu Natal]], and [[Free State (province)|Free State]]. The intention is to add other regional representation as membership grows. There are also seven special purpose committees comprising experts in the areas of trusts, estates, compliance, tax, education and training, and beneficiary funds.

FISA liaises with the Master's Office and the [[South African Revenue Service]] in order to participate in optimising legal and compliance processes. It engages with the [[National Treasury (South Africa)|South African Treasury]] on issues that affect the industry and the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.golegal.co.za/business/future-taxation-trusts |title=The future taxation of trusts |publisher=Go Legal |date= |accessdate=2014-03-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222100440/http://www.golegal.co.za/business/future-taxation-trusts |archivedate=2014-02-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mercury, 26 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.iol.co.za/business/personal-finance/tax/plan-to-tax-capital-gains-as-income-will-kill-discretionary-trusts-1.1479432#.UvNDUPZ4J34 |title=Plan to tax capital gains as income will kill discretionary trusts - Personal Finance Tax &amp;#124; IOL Business |publisher=IOL.co.za |date=2013-03-03 |accessdate=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
FISA aims to raise awareness and standards of fiduciary practice through education to benefit both practitioners and the public. FISA holds an annual conference at which practitioners and academics in the fiduciary field present and discuss topical issues.&lt;ref&gt;De Rebus, 1 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;InvestSA, 1 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2011 FISA introduced a professional examination, in co-operation with the [[University of the Free State]], which gives successful candidates the designation of Fiduciary Practitioner of South Africa (FPSA®).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investsa.co.za/fisa-ramps-up-fiduciary-profession-2/ |title=FISA ramps up fiduciary profession |publisher=Investsa |date= |accessdate=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.moneymarketing.co.za/fiduciary-profession-sa/ |title=Fiduciary profession in SA |publisher=Money-Marketing |date=2013-08-28 |accessdate=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outreach==
FISA works actively to educate the public about fiduciary issues. It has a public helpdesk on its website which contains a complaints procedure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fidsa.org.za/complaints/ |title=Complaints - FISA |publisher=Fidsa.org.za |date= |accessdate=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and consumer education on executorships,  Wills,  and trusts&lt;. For the benefit of both its members and the public, the institute makes available the latest court decisions on fiduciary matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://fidsa.org.za/court-case-proprietary-rights-foreign-marriage/ |title=Court case: Proprietary rights of a foreign marriage - FISA |publisher=Fidsa.org.za |date=2013-12-04 |accessdate=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization also has an active media campaign through which it educates journalists on fiduciary matters and representatives talk about fiduciary issues on radio and television.

==Affiliations==
FISA has strategic alliances with other professional bodies such as the [[South African Institute of Tax Practitioners]], the Law Society of South Africa and the [[Financial Planning Institute]] with which it signed a memorandum of understanding in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;The Financial Planner, 1 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

GIFT City is India's first operational smart city in the Ahmedabad (Amdavad) metropolitan region&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesstoday.in/sectors/infra/gift-city-gujarat-international-finance-tec-city-jobs-companies-offices/story/268278.html|title=GIFT makes steady progress; witnesses a 'hockey stick growth curve'|website=www.businesstoday.in|accessdate=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and international financial services centre&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/more-gifts-for-gift-city-might-stop-flight-of-capital-to-singapore/articleshow/62744143.cms|title=More gifts for GIFT City may stop flight of capital to Singapore|last=Subramanian|first=N. Sundaresha|date=2018-02-01|work=The Economic Times|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

GIFT is an operational smart city developed in the Ahmedabad &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Developments of Ahmedabad | url=https://www.nationsroot.in/member/ahmedabad-west-mp-dr-kirit-p-solanki}}&lt;/ref&gt; metropolitan region as a greenfield development. The project includes features like a [[district cooling]] system, underground [[utility tunnel]], and [[automated vacuum collection|automated vacuum waste collection]], many of which are being introduced in India for the first time. The city is designed for walkability and includes commercial and residential complexes.

The project is located on the bank of the [[Sabarmati River]] and is around 12&amp;nbsp;km from Ahmedabad's international airport. GIFT is easily accessible from all directions through 4-6 lane State and National Highways. A double corridor metro system is planned to connect GIFT City to the Airport and various parts of Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar.

The idea for GIFT was developed during the [[Vibrant Gujarat Global Investor Summit]] 2007 and is being planned by East China Architectural Design &amp; Research Institute (ECADI), which is responsible for planning much of modern-day [[Shanghai]], and Fairwood Consultants India. GIFT City’s Master Plan is for the {{convert|886|acres|order=flip}} of land area to have approximately ~110 buildings with ~{{convert|62000000|sqft|order=flip}} of built-up area, of which around 67% is commercial, 22% is for residential and 11% is social facilities. Currently ~{{convert|2000000|sqft|order=flip}} of commercial space is operational, and another {{convert|3000000|sqft|order=flip}} is under development. As of now an investment of Rs 10,500 crore has already been committed for GIFT City&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/rs-10500-crore-investment-committed-for-gift-city-ceo/articleshow/62620928.cms|title=Rs 10,500 crore investment committed for GIFT City: CEO|date=1 November 2018|publisher=|accessdate=1 November 2018|via=The Economic Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The city has an integrated development model which has been spread out in three phases. Each phase is designed as integrated sustainable development, for example the first phase itself includes development of office space, residential, school, hotel, club etc.

Currently approximately 200 units/companies are operational with more than 7500&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gift-city-may-see-3-4-foreign-banks-set-up-shop-soon/articleshow/62415881.cms|title=Gift city may see 3-4 foreign banks set up shop soon - Times of India|publisher=|accessdate=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; employed at GIFT City.

==Utilities==
===Electricity===
The 1000MW electricity supply is planned to be 99.999% reliable (about 5.3 minutes of outage per year). GIFT's power grid will be designed by [[ABB Group]] of [[Switzerland]]. All the electricity cables will be underground. 

===Piped gas===
[[Natural gas]] will be distributed to every house and building via pipes, which is cheaper and safer than cylinders.
Gas supply to the city will be made from the existing gas network of GSPL, the state-owned company for gas transmission pipelines.
Piped natural gas is already in distribution in the nearby cities of Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar.

===Air conditioning===
India's first city-level district cooling system is operational at GIFT City. It reduces the operational cost by 30-40% and avoids the capital cost of implementing coolers in each building.

===Solid waste management===
All waste will be automatically sucked through underground pipes at a high speed of {{convert|90|km/h|abbr=on}}, and will be treated through [[plasma gasification]].

==Transportation==
GIFT aims at providing a transportation network that ensures accessibility, easy and fast mobility and few accidental road deaths. This would be achieved by:

1. Using a multimodal mix of transport systems ([[Metro-Link Express for Gandhinagar and Ahmedabad|MRTS]]/[[Light rail|LRTS]]/[[Ahmedabad BRTS|BRTS]], etc.) for both intercity transport (to Ahmedabad, Airport, and Gandhinagar) and intra-city transport.

2. Using a walk-to-work concept as part of urban planning with a nodal split of 10:90 between private and public transport.

3. Use of electric [[personal rapid transit]] systems within the city.

GIFT City will also have its own metro stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-01-10/ahmedabad/36257250_1_gift-city-gujarat-international-finance-tec-city-ramakant-jha |title=India News, Latest Sports, Bollywood, World, Business &amp; Politics News - Times of India |website=Articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Indian Railways]] railway lines pass the city on the east and west sides; the closest stations are in [[Dabhoda]] and [[Naroda]].

==Landmarks==
* [[GIFT Diamond Tower]]
* [[GIFT Gateway Towers]] - will be located in the main avenue of the city. It would have elaborate terrace gardens and a rooftop restaurant. The towers draw inspiration from Buland Darwaza. It will have a total {{convert|7300000|sqft|m2|order=flip}} built up space.
* GIFT Crystal Towers - With a total {{convert|8500000|sqft|m2|order=flip}} built up area, four [[Crystal Towers]] will overlook the [[Sabarmati River]].
* GIFT Convention Centre - Inspired by the structure of [[Salt]] crystals and [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s [[Dandi March]], the convention centre would have an opera and have a seating capacity of 10,000. The centre would have total built up area of {{convert|6500000|sqft|m2|order=flip}}.
* World Trade Centre, GIFT City.

==Current status==

* Term sheet has been executed with anchor investor for development of two building packages
* Formal approval for multi service Special Economic Zone received from Ministry of Commerce, Government of India
* Master Planning and Concept design has been undertaken
* Detailed proposal for external connectivity (by road) has been completed in consultation with Roads &amp; Building Department.

Phase-1 is expected to commence in the later part of this year and would be completed in 3–5 years. Subsequent phases would be implemented thereafter.

Government has completed land acquisition of {{convert|673|acre|ha|order=flip}} of land for this project. Presently land leveling activities are going on just next to the Sabarmati river. Works like four lane road, gutter line, water, I.T. broadband cables and power installations will follow this.

The permissions that are obtained so far include GUDA master plan, central Civil Aviation department’s clearance, environmental clearance, and micro-zoning. The government has taken a decision to allow highest 3.65 FSI in GIFT City. The central government has granted SEZ permission to GIFT City. Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation has granted permission for phase-3 of BRTS as part of transportation facility in BRTS. Gujarat Infrastructure Development Board has granted permission for MRTS.

According to officials close to the development, the process of issuing Rs. 200 crore worth of tenders is in advance stage. While Rs. 7,000 crore budget is needed to create all facilities, the government is likely to pump in Rs. 1,000 crore in next three years.

GUDA has been handed over about {{convert|673|acre|ha|order=flip}} of land for land development. Government has prepared 11 types of study reports including a report on earth quake proof construction. 1&amp;nbsp;km long and 7 meter deep Sant Sarovar is being developed to provide water to proposed GIFT City and its construction.

As part of Phase-I development, around {{convert|8.4|e6sqft|m2|order=flip}} of BUA has already been allotted from the {{convert|13|e6sqft|m2|order=flip}} of BUA (built-up area) available for commercial, residential and social uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vibrantgujarat.com/DisplayNewsUpdate.htm?NewsUpdateId=121 |title=News Update 2015 &amp;#124; VG 2015 &amp;#124; Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit 2017 |website=Vibrantgujarat.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970 he has founded a Hotelkomplex Stella Canarias, located in Jandia on the island Fuerteventura. Stella Canaris was sold in 2000 to the Spanish Hotel Group Dunas. After Dunas declared insolvency Sabet took over the management in 2010. After unpaid bills the Hotel shut down from 2013 to 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fuerteventurazeitung.de/index.php/home/8-nachrichten/2906-haftbefehl-gegen-stella-canaris-gruender-hossein-sabet-wegen-steuerstraftat-#&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981 Sabet bought the Berlin newspaper [[w:de:Der Abend (Deutschland)|''Der Abend'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Eine Schlacht verloren |trans-title=A lost battle |url=http://www.zeit.de/1981/06/Eine-Schlacht-verloren |work=[[Die Zeit]] |date=30 January 1981 |accessdate=21 October 2010 |language=German |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611191704/http://www.zeit.de/1981/06/Eine-Schlacht-verloren |archivedate=11 June 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hossein Sabet was the Architect and owner of the [[Dariush Grand Hotel]]. The Project included a Dolphin Park and Birds Garden in Kish Island. In 2014 Sabet sold the Project to Seyed Abdoulreza Mousavi.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12240">In the fields of [[information technology]] (IT) and [[systems management]], '''IT operations analytics (ITOA)''' is an approach or method to retrieve, analyze, and report data for IT operations. ITOA may apply [[big data analytics]] to large datasets to produce business insights.&lt;ref name="DataJournal"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Time Has Come: Analytics Delivers for IT Operations|url=http://www.datacenterjournal.com/it/time-analytics-delivers-operations/|publisher=Data Center Journal|accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fletcher"&gt;{{citation|last=Fletcher|first=Colin|title=Apply IT Operations Analytics to Broader Datasets for Greater Business Insight|url=http://www.gartner.com/document/2778217|date=June 24, 2014|access-date=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, [[Gartner]] predicted its use might increase revenue or reduce costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IT operations analytics: Changing the IT perspective|url=http://www.information-age.com/technology/data-centre-and-it-infrastructure/123457805/it-operations-analytics-changing-it-perspective#sthash.qCUlOnyW.dpuf|publisher=Information Age|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2017, it predicted that 15% of enterprises will use IT operations analytics technologies.&lt;ref name="Fletcher" /&gt;&lt;!-- so did they? --&gt;

==Definition==
IT operations analytics (ITOA) (also known as advanced operational analytics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Advanced Operations Analytics - What the Data Shows!|url=http://www.apmdigest.com/advanced-operations-analytics-what-the-data-shows|publisher=APM Digest |accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or IT data analytics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quintica offers BMC’s TrueSight
|url=http://it-online.co.za/2014/10/27/quintica-offers-bmcs-truesight/|publisher=IT-Online |accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;)  technologies are primarily used to discover complex patterns in high volumes of often "noisy" IT system availability and performance data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hype Cycle for IT Operations Management, 2013|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/2556718/hype-cycle-it-operations-management|publisher=Gartner|accessdate=23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Forrester Research]] defined IT analytics as "The use of mathematical algorithms and other innovations to extract meaningful information from the sea of raw data collected by management and monitoring technologies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Turn Big Data Inward With IT Analytics|url=https://www.forrester.com/Turn+Big+Data+Inward+With+IT+Analytics/fulltext/-/E-RES75501?objectid=RES75501|publisher=Forrester Research|accessdate=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Operations research]] as a discipline emerged from the [[Second World War]] to improve military efficiency and decision-making on the battlefield.&lt;ref&gt;Kirby, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DWITTpkFPEAC&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;pg=PA117 p. 117] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827004623/https://books.google.com/books?id=DWITTpkFPEAC&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;pg=PA117 |date=27 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, only with the emergence of [[machine learning]] tech in the early 2000s could an [[artificial intelligence|artificially intelligent]] operational analytics platform actually begin to engage in the high-level [[pattern recognition]] that could adequately serve business needs.&lt;ref name="DataJournal" /&gt; A critical catalyst towards ITOA development was the rise of [[Google]], which pioneered a [[predictive analytics]] model that represented the first attempt to read into patterns of human behavior on the [[Internet]]. IT specialists then applied predictive analytics to the IT Industry, coming forward with platforms that can sift through data to generate insights without the need for human intervention.&lt;ref name="DataJournal" /&gt;

Due to the mainstream embrace of [[cloud computing]] and the increasing desire for businesses to adopt more [[Big Data]] practices, the ITOA industry has grown significantly since 2010. A 2016 ExtraHop survey of large and mid-size corporations indicates that 65 percent of the businesses surveyed will seek to integrate their [[data silos]] either this year or the next.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The State of the ITOA Today|url=https://assets.extrahop.com/pdfs/ebooks/State-of-ITOA-ebook.pdf|website=ExtraHop|publisher=ExtraHop|accessdate=June 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current goals of ITOA platforms are to improve the accuracy of their [[Application Performance Management|APM]] services, facilitate better integration with the data, and to enhance their predictive analytics capabilities.

==Applications==
ITOA systems tend to be used by IT operations teams, and [[Gartner]] describes five applications of ITOA systems:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IT Market Clock for IT Operations Management, 2013 |url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/2573216/it-market-clock-it-operations|publisher=Gartner|accessdate=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Root Cause Analysis:'''  The models, structures and pattern descriptions of IT infrastructure or application stack being monitored can help users pinpoint fine-grained and previously unknown root causes of overall system behavior pathologies.
* '''Proactive Control of Service Performance and Availability:''' Predicts future system states and the impact of those states on performance.
* '''Problem Assignment:''' Determines how problems may be resolved or, at least, direct the results of inferences to the most appropriate individuals or communities in the enterprise for problem resolution.
* '''Service Impact Analysis:''' When multiple root causes are known, the  analytics system's output is used to determine and rank the relative impact, so that resources can be devoted to correcting the fault in the most timely and cost-effective way possible.
* '''Complement Best-of-breed Technology:''' The models, structures and pattern descriptions of IT infrastructure or application stack being monitored are used to correct or extend the outputs of other discovery-oriented tools to improve the fidelity of information used in operational tasks (e.g., service dependency maps, application runtime architecture topologies, network topologies).
* '''Real time application behavior learning:''' Learns &amp; correlates the behavior of Application based on user pattern and underlying Infrastructure on various application patterns, create metrics of such correlated patterns and store it for further analysis.
* '''Dynamically Baselines Threshold:''' Learns behavior of Infrastructure on various application user patterns and determines the Optimal behavior of the Infra and technological components, bench marks and baselines the low and high water mark for the specific environments and dynamically changes the bench mark baselines with the changing infra and user patterns without any manual intervention

==Types==
In their ''Data Growth Demands a Single, Architected IT Operations Analytics Platform'', [[Gartner]] Research describes five types of analytics technologies:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Data Growth Demands a Single, Architected IT Operations Analytics Platform|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/2599016/data-growth-demands-single-architected|publisher=Gartner|accessdate=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Log analysis]]
* Unstructured text indexing, search and inference (UTISI)
* Topological analysis (TA)
* Multidimensional database search and analysis (MDSA)
* Complex operations event processing (COEP)
* Statistical pattern discovery and recognition (SPDR)

There are two main aspects of an AIOps platform: [[Machine learning]] and [[big data]]. In order to collect [[Observational study|observational data]] and engagement data that can be found inside a big data platform and requires a shift away from sectionally segregated IT data, a holistic machine learning and [[analytics|analytics strategy]] is implemented against the combined IT data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://devops.com/aiops-second-law-ops/|title=AIOps: Managing the Second Law of IT Ops - DevOps.com|date=22 September 2017|website=devops.com|accessdate=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal is to receive continuous insights which provide [[Continual improvement process|continuous fixes and improvements]] via automation. This is why AIOps can be viewed as [[CI/CD]] for core IT functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://appdevelopermagazine.com/5047/2017/3/13/explaining-what-aiops-is-and-why-it-matters-to-developers/|title=Explaining what AIOps is and why it matters to developers|first=Richard|last=Harris|website=appdevelopermagazine.com|accessdate=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://squadex.com/aiops-101/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Isentia''' is a media intelligence and data technology company headquartered in Sydney Australia, with locations in New Zealand, South-East Asia and Greater China. It has a corporate history dating from 1982. It has offices in [[Melbourne]], [[Canberra]], [[Brisbane]], [[Adelaide]], [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] (Australia), [[Wellington]], [[Auckland]] (New Zealand), [[Kuala Lumpur]] (Malaysia), [[Singapore]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Beijing]] and [[Shanghai]] (China), [[Tokyo]], [[Manila]], [[Bangkok]], [[Jakarta]], [[Ho Chi Minh City]], [[Seoul]] and [[Taipei]].

==Overview==
Formerly known as Sentia Media and before that Media Monitors. The company rebranded to Sentia Media in 2012 and then moved all its companies under one name, Isentia in March 2013. The company became public on 5 June 2014, listing on the [[Australian Securities Exchange]]. Before listing, it was owned by Australian private equity group Quadrant Private Equity since July 2010. Acquisitions since 2010 include: Singapore-based social media and online intelligence evaluation company [[Brandtology]]; Australian social media specialists BuzzNumbers; South East Asia's largest media intelligence company, [[MediaBanc]]; and Beijing company, ChinaClipping. Isentia also owns DIY media tracking service, Slice Media.

== History ==
[[Neville Jeffress]], the owner of a firm that managed the sale and publication of [[classified advertising]], began acquiring clipping services in 1982, including NSW Country Press, Lynch Pidler Pty and the Australian Press Cutting Agency.&lt;ref name=Smh2007-09-14/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheAgeFragile/&gt;
This service operated as Neville Jeffress/Pidler Pty Ltd. from 1982 to 1993 when it purchased and amalgamated Media Monitors Australia, and began operating as Media Monitors. By the time Neville Jeffress/Pidler Pty Ltd changed its name to Media Monitors Australia Pty Ltd in 1993, the company had established itself as one of Australia's largest media monitoring companies. Media Monitors stepped out of Australasia by opening an office in Singapore in 2006. In 2011 Media Monitors Group was purchased by Australian private equity company Quadrant. On 9 February 2012, the company unified its brands under one corporate name, Sentia Media, and in 2013 the company moved under one name across the Asia-Pacific region, Isentia.

===Australian Securities Exchange listing===
In May 2014, Isentia lodged a prospectus in preparation for a listing on the Australian Securities Exchange.&lt;ref name=SmartCompany2014-05-22/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheAge2014-05-05/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheAge2014-06-11/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheAge2014-06-07/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheAge2014-07-01/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheAge2014-08-29/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheAustralian2014-06-05/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheAustralian2013-10-30/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wsj2014-02-19/&gt; Isentia listed on the ASX in June of the same year.

===Acquisitions===
Media Monitors acquired New Zealand's leading monitoring company Media Search in 2004. In January 2006 it acquired CARMA International (Asia Pacific) Pty Limited, the exclusive Asia-Pacific franchise of global media analysis firm, CARMA International, Inc. A new office was opened in Singapore shortly after the acquisition. In June 2006, Media Monitors announced the acquisition of Rehame. Shortly thereafter, Media Monitors acquired the remaining 50% of shares in Sponsorship Information Services (SiS). In February 2007, Media Monitors acquired a significant stake in MediaPeople NZ, an Auckland-based specialist in media targeting.

In 2008, the company acquired SinoFile Information Consulting in Beijing, and Asia Media Monitoring in Malaysia to expand its business in Greater China and South-East Asia. The company also opened its Hong Kong office in the same year.

In June 2012 Sentia Media purchased social media intelligence company BuzzNumbers.

In August 2013 Isentia bought social media agency Two Social, extending the reach of the company in the social media sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mumbrella.com.au/isentia-buys-social-media-agency-two-social-174006|title=iSentia buys social media agency Two Social|work=mUmBRELLA|accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015, Isentia announced its acquisition of content marketing agency King Content.

With the acquisition, China Newswire's CEO Danny Levinson became Isentia's new Regional Director for Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.chinamoneynetwork.com/2017/01/06/australian-media-tech-firm-isentia-makes-china-inroads-via-acquisition |title=Australian Media Tech Firm Isentia Makes China Inroads Via Acquisition |last=Yue |first=Jillian |date=6 January 2017 |work=China Money Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir John Logan Campbell''' (3 November 1817 – 22 June 1912) was a prominent New Zealand [[public figure]]. He was the son of Doctor John Campbell and his wife Catherine and grandson of the [[Campbell baronets#Campbell baronets, of Aberuchil (c. 1668)|3rd baronet]] of Aberuchil and [[Kilbryde Castle]], near [[Dunblane]], Perthshire. He was described by his contemporaries as "the father of [[Auckland]]".

== Early life==
[[File:John Logan Campbell, by Mungo Burton (1799-1882).jpg|thumb|150px|left|John Logan Campbell in the club dress of the Edinburgh Alleion Archers ([[Mungo Burton]], 1838)]]
John Logan Campbell was born in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, on 3 November 1817. He had four sisters but his two elder brothers had died by the time he reached the age of 2, and he became the only surviving son.&lt;ref&gt;R C J Stone, ''Poenamo Revisited'', Godwit 2012 {{ISBN|978 1 86979 798 0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell graduated in medicine from the [[University of Edinburgh Medical School|University of Edinburgh]] in 1839&lt;ref&gt;''List of the graduates in medicine in the University of Edinburgh from MDCCV to MDCCCLXVI'', Edinburgh 1867&lt;/ref&gt; and later that year sailed for the antipodes, [[New South Wales]], as a [[surgeon]] on the emigrant ship ''Palmyra''.&lt;ref name="DNZB Campbell"&gt;{{DNZB|Stone|R. C. J.|1c3|Campbell, John Logan - Biography|31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Migration to New Zealand==
In 1840, he came to New Zealand, arriving first in [[Coromandel, New Zealand|Coromandel]] and thence to the capital of New Zealand, Auckland, which had been founded by [[Governor-General of New Zealand|Governor]] [[William Hobson]]. Campbell and [[William Brown (New Zealand politician)|William Brown]] (a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[lawyer]]) who arrived at the same time, were the first Europeans to settle in the area.

Campbell and Brown built the first house in Auckland (Acacia Cottage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM7735_Acacia_Cottage_Cornwall_Park_Auckland_New_Zealand|title=Acacia Cottage, Cornwall Park.

John Logan Campbell quickly became prominent in Auckland, both in business circles and in public life. He was a director of the [[Bank of New Zealand]], the [[New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency Company]], and the [[NZI|New Zealand Insurance Company]].&lt;ref name="DNZB Campbell" /&gt;

Campbell entered the [[2nd New Zealand Parliament]], representing the electorates of the [[Auckland (New Zealand electorate)|City of Auckland]] 1855–1856 (resigned). He was elected unopposed on 4 August 1860 in the [[Suburbs of Auckland (New Zealand electorate)|Suburbs of Auckland]] electorate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Election for the Suburbs |url= http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=DSC18600807.2.10.4 |accessdate=23 June 2010 |newspaper=Daily Southern Cross |volume=XVII |issue=1319 |date=7 August 1860 |page=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; replacing [[Joseph Hargreaves (politician)|Joseph Hargreaves]].&lt;ref name="NZETC Hargreaves"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cyclopedia of New Zealand : Auckland Provincial District |year=1902 |url=http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-Cyc02Cycl-t1-body1-d1-d10-d15.html |author=Cyclopedia Company Limited |accessdate=23 June 2010 |location=Christchurch |chapter=Mr. Joseph Hargreaves}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell retired at the end of the 2nd Parliament in later in 1860. He was a [[minister without portfolio]] in the government of [[Edward Stafford (politician)|Edward Stafford]] between June and November 1856.

==Middle years==
{{unsourced|section|date=April 2018}}
Campbell was a successful businessman and had entered into a partnership with William Brown in 1840, beginning operations as Auckland's first merchant firm, Brown and Campbell. By 1856 Campbell and Brown decided that their enterprises and properties, now worth £110,000, could be entrusted to a salaried manager, while they lived on the dividends as expatriates.

Brown and his family left early in the year, but Campbell's departure was delayed. Much against his inclinations he became caught up in politics, serving as provincial superintendent, then as a member of the House of Representatives for the City of Auckland, and briefly (June to November 1856) as a member of the colony's first stable, responsible ministry under E. W. Stafford. These 'earthly baubles' he gladly resigned in September. On 20 November 1856 he left the colony, he hoped for good.

While travelling abroad, he married Emma Wilson on 25 February 1858. Apart from an interlude during 1860 and 1861, when he was obliged to go to Auckland to reinvigorate the firm – now called Brown Campbell and Company – and to install a resident partner, the Campbells lived in various parts of Europe until 1871.

On his return early in 1871, Campbell took over full control. Two years later he bought out Brown's partnership share for over £40,000. Becoming a part of the business community again, he became involved with the Bank of New Zealand, the New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency Company, the New Zealand Insurance Company, and related companies. He founded Auckland's first school of art in 1878 and supported it for 11 years.

When depression overwhelmed Auckland in 1885 and the Stock Market collapsed in 1886, there began a desperate struggle for financial survival. Campbell sold several businesses and properties, concentrating his energies on Brown Campbell and Company, a brewery and liquor importer. Campbell retained his properties at One Tree Hill partly because he wanted to create a suitable residence for his family. He envisaged an Italianate mansion similar to [[James Williamson (New Zealand politician)|James Williamson]]'s at Hillsborough, surrounded by an elegant estate. He set about planting trees to create a suitable landscape garden.

His wife, however, had other ideas and the house, Killbryde, was eventually built in [[Parnell, New Zealand|Parnell]], a location much more handy to town. This property is now part of the [[Parnell Rose Gardens]] and [[Dove Myer Robinson Park]]. The house was demolished in 1924. In his later years, Campbell was concerned about the increasing suburban development of Auckland and decided to donate his remaining farmland at One Tree Hill to the city as a public amenity to be called Corinth Park - named after a part of Greece which Campbell had admired on his travels. His planting of groves of olive trees may have been connected to this.

The presentation of the park would probably have taken place after Campbell's death in the form of a bequest had not providence intervened in the form of the Royal Tour of 1901.

[[File:His Worship the Mayor of Auckland (1901), Dr J Logan Campbell.jpg|thumb|''His Worship the [[Mayor of Auckland]], Dr J Logan Campbell''; painted in 1901 by [[Mabel Hill]]]]
In 1901, Doctor John Logan Campbell was approached to be [[Mayor of Auckland]] for the royal visit that year, ([http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/Cyc02Cycl-fig-Cyc02Cycl1015a.html photo in mayoral robes)] as [[David Goldie (politician)|David Goldie]] a temperance advocate did not want to toast the visiting [[George V of the United Kingdom|Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York]] with alcohol.

Rather than incur an election at short notice, it was decided to honour Campbell with the position. Campbell only accepted on the grounds that it was completely honorary and that he wouldn't be involved in any politics. He was elected by the councillors, not the electorate. He resigned from the mayoralty the month after the royal visit. During the royal visit, Logan Campbell donated [[Cornwall Park, Auckland|Cornwall Park]] to the people of New Zealand and named it after the Duke and Duchess.

==Later life==
Campbell was made a [[knight bachelor]] on 14 August 1902,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=27465 |date=15 August 1902|page=5327|supp=}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the honour had been announced in the [[1902 Coronation Honours]] list published on 26 June 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The Coronation Honours |day_of_week=Thursday |date=26 June 1902 |page_number=5 |issue=36804| }}&lt;/ref&gt; He lived long enough to witness the erection of the bronze statue of him in Mayoral Robes at the Manukau Road entrance to Cornwall Park. He died on 22 June 1912, and is buried on the summit of Auckland's [[One Tree Hill, New Zealand|One Tree Hill]], which he had named, in the middle of Cornwall Park. He had always intended that the summit would be the location of a monument to the Maori people and left instructions and funds for its erection in his will and Trust Deeds. The Trustees felt that development of the park as a public facility took immediate priority and so construction of the obelisk did not commence until the late 1930s. This meant the official dedication was delayed as the Maori elders did not wish to formally dedicate it during a time of war. His grave is located in the middle of the flat platform which serves as the forecourt to the monument.

The '''Kangani system''' was a form of labour recruitment and organisation in parts of Southeast Asia under British colonial rule, generally in operation from the early 19th century until the early 20th century, specifically the areas now known as [[Colonial Burma|Myanmar]], [[British Malaya|Malaysia]], and [[British Ceylon|Sri Lanka]]. The system was similar to [[indentured servitude]] and both were in operation during the same period, with the kangani system becoming more popular from late 19th century onward. Under the kangani system, recruitment and management were taken up by people called the ''kangani'' (from the Tamil word for foreman), who directly recruited migrants from India- especially South India in Tamil-majority areas- via networks of friends, family and other contacts, with that same person  then responsible for the supervision of the labourers he recruited. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Amarjit |last=Kaur |title=Southeast Asia: An Historical Encyclopedia from Angor Wat to East Timor |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QKgraWbb7yoC |year=2004 | publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=1576077705 |pages=639, 641}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The leader of these groups of immigrants had considerable control over their affairs and generally forced them to enter debt-bondage relationships by illegally deducting their wages. In smaller groups they might work as labourers themselves in addition to their other responsibilities but in larger groups their role was more one of organisation, supervision and dealing with the landowner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Raj Sekhar |last=Basu |title=Nandanar's Children: The Paraiyans' Tryst with Destiny, Tamil Nadu 1850 - 1956 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4NeGAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA111 |year=2011 |publisher=SAGE |isbn=978-81-321-0679-1 |pages=111, 119}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With certain estimates showing that nearly 1 in 8 Indian labourers in Burma was a kangani, some have argued that stepping into the role of recruiter and supervisor, with its accompanied rise in income and status, was a relatively achievable form of social mobility among the labourers of the plantations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=39lJz_L4MdUC|title=Rising India and Indian communities in East Asia|last=|first=|date=2008|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies|others=Kesavapany, K.,, Mani, A.,, Ramasamy, P.

'''Leo Wainstein''' (4 January 1883 – 13 March 1978) was an [[Ukrainian Jewish]] [[jurist]] and businessman who lived most part of his life in [[Finland]].

Wainstein was born in [[Yalta]] to a Jewish peasant family. He graduated as jurist in [[Odessa University]] in 1910 and worked in the field until 1916, when he got involved into [[wool]] business through his marriage to Regina née Tilling. After the [[October Revolution]] the couple moved to Finland, where Wainstein made a successful career in textile industry. His business started to decline in the 1950s, and after this he changed to hat industry for a few years before his retirement.

Wainstein had [[Italian citizenship]], and he died in Rome on 13 March 1978.

== Early life and career in Russian Empire ==
Wainstein was born in [[Yalta]], [[Russian Empire]] to a Jewish family. His parents were farmer Josef Wainstein and Lia née Rabinowicz. The father died when Waintein was young and faced had difficulties at completing his studies. Eventually, Wainstein completed his upper secondary studies in 1906 and continued in Odessa University, where he graduated as jurist in 1910.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Leo Wainstein"/&gt;

Following to his graduation, Wainstein worked as jurist first in [[Odessa]] and later in Moscow. There he met Regina Trilling, who was a daughter of a [[Polish Jew]] wool trader Elias Trilling. Leo and Regina got married in 1915 and in the following year Leo Wainstein started working for his father-in-law's wool company. Wainstein learned wool business thoroughly and his work took him to the [[Nordic Countries]], UK, [[Belgium]], France, Italy and [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Leo Wainstein"/&gt;

== Wool manufacturing in Finland ==
Wainstein's wool business came to end after the [[October Revolution]] and at late 1918 the couple decided to move to newly independent [[Finland]].

In 1919 Wainstein became owner and manager of wool company Ab Nordiska Ullkompaniet Oy. The Finnish textile industry was in trouble – in addition to the local market, the Finnish companies had sold large share of their production in Russia, and now this market area was closed. Despite of the difficulties, Wainstein developed the business determinedly.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Leo Wainstein"/&gt;

In 1924 Waintein took over Turun Verkatehdas Oy (''[[Turku]] Baize Factory'') from young businessman [[Wilhelm Wahlforss]], who had led the company unsuccessfully. At the time the company employed just 65 people, but Wainstein increased the production capacity of [[worsted yarn]] and woolen fabric by 45%, and the number of [[Spindle (textiles)|spindles]] was increased from 3,400 up to nearly 30,000. Waintein owned a German, [[Berlin]]-based subsidiary Nordische Woll GmbH.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Leo Wainstein"/&gt;

The company did well following the [[Second World War]] and upswing in economy, and the headcount in Turun Verkatehdas reached nearly 2,000 in the turn of the 1950s. Soon after this the situation turned worse: shortly after the company had bought a large stock of wool, the government started wool [[price regulation]]. Consequently, the raw material price dropped and the final products had to be priced accordingly. At the early 1950s the wool price dropped to one third of the previous peak level, and the company fell into trouble.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Leo Wainstein"/&gt;

Wainstein and the main financing bank [[Pohjoismaiden Yhdyspankki]] (PYP) started to seek a way out from the difficult situation. PYP continued funding the Turku baize factory partly because of Wainstein's good relationship to the bank's main director [[Rainer von Fieandt]], and partly because the company collapse would have meant a victory to another local competitor Barker-Littoinen Oy and its financier and [[Kansallis-Osake-Pankki]] (KOP), which was the main competitor of PYP. Waintein realised that the future did not look bright, and moved 51% of the company ownership to a foundation he had founded in 1952. The foundation board members were Wainstein, Fieandt and [[Sakari Tuomioja]], the director of [[Bank of Finland]]. The setup was tactically selected – after this the company was on a stable basis. Wainstein left his position as chairman in 1953 and Fieandt left in 1955. Turun Verkatehdas was merged to Villayhtymä Oy in 1960.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Leo Wainstein"/&gt;

== Hat business ==
Since the 1920s Wainstein had been involved in [[hatmaking]], being a board member of Oy Silfverbergin &amp; Wecksellin Yhdistetyt Hattutehtaat ("Silfverberg's &amp; Wecksell's United Hat Factories Ltd"). After leaving baize manufacturing, Wainstein got involved into [[Kristinestad]] located hat producer Oy M. Kotschack Ab together with his son Michael. Wainstein retired at the end of the 1960s, after which Leo and Regina Wainstein moved to Rome for the rest of their lives; Wainstein had had Italian citizenship since 1919.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Leo Wainstein"/&gt;

== Personal life ==
Wainstein's favourite hobbies were gardening, music and arts. He was great friend of Italy and worked as Italian [[Consul (representative)|consul]] in Helsinki in 1919–1923. During 1949–1968 he was Italian Honorary Consul General. Wainstein contributed trade between the two countries as member of the Finnish–Italian [[Chamber of Commerce]]. Wainstein also took part in the Helsinki Jewish Congregation.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Leo Wainstein"/&gt;

== Leo and Regina Wainstein foundation ==
In 1928 Leo and Regina Wainstein founded foundation ''Leo ja Regina Wainsteinin säätiö'' to celebrate their tenth anniversary in Finland and as a gratitude to their new home country. The foundation had a significant amount of capital and it shared grants and funded a number of pieces of sculpture in Turku, Helsinki and [[Gothenburg]]. The foundation was ended in 2003&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Leo Wainstein"/&gt; after which it became part of the [[Finnish Cultural Foundation]] as Leo and Regina Wainstein Fund.&lt;ref name="SKR: Leo ja Regina Wainsteinin rahasto"/&gt;

'''Liberty Village''' is a neighbourhood in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada.  It is bordered to the north by [[King Street (Toronto)|King Street West]], to the west by [[Dufferin Street]], to the south by the [[Gardiner Expressway]], to the east by Strachan Avenue, and to the northeast by the CP railway tracks.

==History==
In the 1850s, both the [[Toronto, Grey and Bruce Railway]] and the [[Great Western Railway (Ontario)|Great Western Railway]] laid tracks across the community, cutting it off from rest of the city and altering plans to develop the area for residential purposes.  Instead, Liberty Village became home to several institutions, including the [[Toronto Central Prison]], opened in 1873, and the [[Andrew Mercer Reformatory for Women]] (on the site of today’s [[Lamport Stadium]]), opened in 1878 for women convicted of "vagrancy", "incorrigibility", or "sexual precociousness."  Provincial Secretary [[William John Hanna]] forced the closure of Central Prison in 1915, and all its buildings were demolished except for the paint shop and chapel.  "Liberty Street", for which Liberty Village is named, was the first street both male and female convicts would walk once freed.&lt;ref name="Wieditz"&gt;{{cite web | last =  Wieditz | first = Thorben | title = Liberty Village: The Makeover of Toronto’s King and Dufferin Area | publisher = Centre for Urban and Community Studies | date = January 2007 | url = http://www.urbancentre.utoronto.ca/pdfs/researchbulletins/CUCSRB32-WieditzJan07.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area's proximity to the railway tracks led to its growth as an industrial area.  In 1884, [[John Inglis and Company]] opened a factory to manufacture heavy machinery, boilers, and later, electrical appliances.  Inglis' success led to its expansion onto Central Prison lands.  In 1891, Massey-Harris (later [[Massey Ferguson]]) built a factory to produce agricultural implements.  Other companies which established in the late 19th century included Toronto Carpet Manufacturing, St. David’s Wine, and Ontario Wind Engine and Pump.&lt;ref name="Wieditz"/&gt;
[[File:Bombs stored on Liberty Street, looking east from Dufferin Street.jpg|thumb|left|Bombs stored on Liberty Street, looking east from [[Dufferin Street]] during the [[First World War]]. Industry flourished in the area during the early 20th century.]]
Industry continued to flourish during the early 20th century due to the area's excellent railway access and many spur lines, as well as a plentiful labour supply from nearby [[Parkdale, Toronto|Parkdale]].  New companies included [[Brunswick Corporation|Brunswick-Balke-Collender]] (manufacturer of billiard tables and bowling alleys), [[Irwin Toy]], Canada Metal, [[Simmons Bedding Company|Simmons Bedding]], Hinde and Dauch Paper, and Sunbeam Incandescent Lamp (later [[Canadian General Electric]]).&lt;ref name="Wieditz"/&gt;

Many of the factories produced armaments, bombs, and weapons during both world wars, and much of the soil pollution in the area dates from those periods.&lt;ref name="Wieditz"/&gt;

During the late 1970s and early 1980s, manufacturing operations within Liberty Village began to decline due to a shift from rail to road shipping, the need for larger manufacturing facilities, and lower manufacturing costs in suburban or offshore locations.  In 1990, the Toronto Carpet Manufacturing plant on Liberty Street shut down, and the Inglis plant (owned by [[Whirlpool Corporation|Whirlpool]] since 1985) ceased operations in 1991.  The Inglis factory and Massey-Harris factory (with the exception of 947 King St. West) were demolished.&lt;ref name="Wieditz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LVMP"&gt;{{cite web | title = Liberty Village Master Plan | publisher = Liberty Village Business Improvement Area | date = August 2013 | url = https://www.dropbox.com/s/1ean9q4xrianbls/LVMasterPlan_LoRes_August2013.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decreased industrial activity and lower property values caused many Liberty Village buildings to fall into neglect.&lt;ref name="Wieditz"/&gt;

The Liberty Village BIA [[Business improvement district|Business Improvement Area]] was founded in 2001 and represents over 600 member businesses which employ more than 10,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=6ad746aa794fa310VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=8e3032d0b6d1e310VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD|title=Liberty Village BIA|last=|first=|date=|website=City of Toronto - BIA LIstings|publisher=City of Toronto|access-date=July 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Liberty Village - Hanna Ave E.jpg|thumb|Industrial buildings re-purposed for other uses. Along with other areas of Toronto, Liberty Village experienced a wave of [[gentrification]] in the early 21st century.]]
Partly because of this, Liberty Village has experienced phenomenal growth from 2004 to the present in terms of new condos/lofts, office space, a new park, and a multitude of new shops and restaurants.

The ongoing [[gentrification]] of downtown Toronto has been pushing farther outwards from downtown (see [[Queen Street West]], [[Niagara, Toronto|Niagara]], [[Distillery District]]), encouraging rapid development. It has become a trendy neighbourhood for young professionals and artists pushing farther west for less established areas, while still remaining a short walk or [[Toronto streetcar system|streetcar]] ride from the core. Many old factories have been repurposed as lofts while others have become restaurants, gyms, furniture stores and galleries, as this area was primarily a former heavy industrial area.

The industrial building that used to house a paper company and up until 2003, the [[Irwin Toy|Irwin Toy Factory]], was converted into industrial residential lofts and mixed commercial use spaces.  The Toronto Carpet Factory Building on Mowat Avenue and its surrounding campus of industrial structures is an example of 1900s' turn of the century industrial architecture and currently houses a mixture of design, technology, media and marketing companies.  Old storage and factory spaces at Liberty Street and Hanna Avenue were converted into commercial spaces in the 1980s and 1990s, and they comprise Liberty Market. The Market houses design firms and collectives, media, technology and marketing firms, and an eclectic mix of retail stores. Structures from the old Inglis Factory and the former Massey Ferguson Head Office surround the heart of Liberty Village, further testifying to the industrial history of the neighbourhood.

==Community==

In November, 2011 a group of citizens formed the Liberty Village Residents' Association *[https://www.lvra.ca LVRA] as a collective response to ongoing infrastructure issues and with a stated goal of creating social cohesion amongst the more than 25 000 people who call the Liberty Village area home. Within four years 95% of all condominiums in Liberty Village were members and it created six annual events attended by thousands every year. It has a Facebook Group with more than 11 000 members and an 84.1% participation rate, making it the virtual speakers corner and central information distribution source for the area. It exploded the typical model of residents' associations by being proactively business forward and targeting community interaction. It calls itself a "YIMBY" organization and its growth has been exponential. It is a legal not-for-profit run by volunteers and claims to be the "Largest residents' association in North America". It has attracted significant sponsorship to provide connectivity for the community through events, outreach, and collective responses to neighbourhood and infrastructure issues (transit, daycare, safety). Its current major sponsor is a local Liberty Village communications company, *[https://www.beanfield.com/ Beanfield Metroconnect].

The Liberty Village name was introduced as a positive 'brand' by the property owners and developers in the area in conjunction with the City of Toronto. The neighbourhood aims to distinguish itself from [[Parkdale, Toronto|Parkdale]], which now begins west of Dufferin Street. Its location is considered one of its finest assets being a 10-minute walk to the Lakeshore, 15-minute streetcar ride to the financial core and a 20-minute walk from the entertainment/fashion/gallery districts of King St. West.
[[File:CN Tower from Liberty Village (23830099194).jpg|thumb|left|View of East Liberty Street, east of Hanna Avenue. Most new residential developments in Liberty Village are focused along this area.]]
Offices are mostly concentrated in the west end of Liberty Village. New residential developments are currently focused on East Liberty Street, which begins east of Hanna Avenue. Over 20 new restaurants have opened in the past 3 years, providing the residents and workers in the community with many eclectic places to dine and enjoy their developing neighbourhood.

Artscape, a non-profit urban development organization that revitalizes buildings, neighbourhoods, and cities through the arts has a strong presence in Liberty Village, providing mixed live/work spaces for local artists.  Its influence can be seen throughout the neighbourhood and maintains the valued tradition of a neighbourhood that was once dominated by artists searching for affordable living and studio spaces.
[[File:Artscape.jpg|thumb|upright|The head offices of Artscape, a [[non-profit organization|non-profit]] urban development organization, is located in Liberty Village.]]
Liberty Village is known for its successful Art and Design studios, but media, technology and music companies (Live Nation, Universal Music, SOCAN) also have a strong presence in the community.  Many Canadian and US design and technology firms have located to Liberty Village, creating many jobs for the increasing number of citizens that have moved into the growing neighbourhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www1.toronto.ca/City%20Of%20Toronto/Economic%20Development%20&amp;%20Culture/Business%20Pages/Operate%20&amp;%20Grow%20your%20Business/Business%20Improvement%20Areas/BIA_dashboard_PDFs/Liberty_Village_BIA.pdf|title=Liberty Village - Business Improvement Area Statistics|last=Darkwah|first=Kwabena|date=2014|website=City of Toronto BIA Office|publisher=City of Toronto|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opinion on current residential design===
In an academic study of Liberty Village prepared by Thorben Wieditz in 2007, he wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The area’s makeover is supported by newspaper articles that promote the area as an "artsy loft district," a "bohemian enclave," and a "neighbourhood to live, work and play" for people who want to be close to the entertainment district and to the gentrifying Queen Street West area. With the influx of large-scale developers, it is likely that the new developments will obliterate any trace of the "artsy" and "bohemian" residents who once populated the area.&lt;ref name="Wieditz"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Christopher Hume of the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' wrote that "Liberty Village illustrates everything that's wrong with planning in Toronto," and that "civic propaganda would have us believe Liberty Village is a shining example of urban vitality".  Hume described Liberty Village as "one huge parking lot after another", with very little green space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Hume | first = Christopher | title = Liberty Village Highlights Poor Planning | publisher = Toronto Star | date = March 8, 2008 | url = https://www.thestar.com/life/homes/2008/03/08/liberty_village_highlights_poor_planning.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Toronto Life]]'' described Liberty Village as a neighbourhood which has "morphed from an industrial dead zone into an enclave of concrete, glass and brick in just a few years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Condo Showdown: Five Liberty Village Units for Under $550,000 | publisher = Toronto Life | date = June 11, 2013 | url = http://www.torontolife.com/tag/liberty-village/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While preparing the Liberty Village Master Plan (2013), local residents were consulted on their general views and specific issues with the district. The responses were mixed. There were positive opinions expressed about Liberty Village's "sense of community", "youthful...[and] village atmosphere", and "sense of energy and vibrancy that comes from the concentration of creative sector businesses."  Concerns were expressed about traffic congestion, the inadequacy and overcrowding of public transit, and the need to increase the diversity of the type of retail and social activities within Liberty Village.  Also identified was need for improved infrastructure, such as better utilization of Lamport Stadium, and the construction of the proposed Liberty New Street along the south edge of the community.&lt;ref name="LVMP"/&gt;

Liberty Village's desirable location and community has made it a magnet for development and there are currently (2018) 9 additional condominiums under construction adding a new park, bridge connections to Fort York and King St. West, retail, daycare and approximately 4000 condominium units. From 2011 census to 2016 census Liberty Village's density increased 3x.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The GTA's Population is Booming | publisher = The Toronto Star | date = March 2, 2018 | url = https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2018/03/02/the-gtas-population-is-booming-but-not-necessarily-in-the-right-places.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation==
The [[Toronto Transit Commission]] (TTC) operates two of its [[Toronto streetcar system|streetcar routes]] along King Street West: the [[504 King]] and since June 2016, the [[514 Cherry]]. Both routes connect to [[King station|King]] and [[St. Andrew station|St. Andrew]] stations on [[Line 1 Yonge–University|Line 1]] of the [[Toronto subway|subway network]], which the 504 King also serves [[Dundas West station|Dundas West]] and [[Broadview station|Broadview]] stations on [[Line 2 Bloor–Danforth|Line 2]] at its termini. The 514 Cherry runs on Dufferin Street south of King and terminates at the [[Dufferin Gate Loop]]. This route continues eastbound to the [[Distillery Loop]] adjacent to the Distillery Historic District. Subway line 2 can additionally be reached using the 29 Dufferin [[Toronto Transit Commission bus system|bus route]] which travels along Dufferin Street.

At the southern end of Liberty Village there is access to [[Exhibition GO Station]], served by commuter trains on [[GO Transit]]'s [[Lakeshore West line]]. The station is in turn linked to the TTC's [[Exhibition Loop]], served by the [[509 Harbourfront]] and [[511 Bathurst]] streetcar routes.

Since November 2017, a pilot project on King Street has been implemented that has sped up travel times on streetcars along the central section of King Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2017/11/17/king-st-pilot-project-does-what-big-cities-around-the-world-are-doing-micallef.html|title=King St. pilot project does what big cities around the world are doing: Micallef|last=Micallef|first=Shawn|date=2017-11-17|work=The Toronto Star|access-date=2017-12-01|language=en-CA|issn=0319-0781}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===King-Liberty pedestrian bridge===
A pedestrian bridge to connect Liberty Village to neighbouring [[Niagara, Toronto|
Niagara]] was approved in 2011 and construction began in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/liberty-village-king-street-bridge-1.4602748&lt;/ref&gt; The $11.5 million bridge will provide better access to both Liberty Village and Niagara which is currently cut off by the railway corridor with access to King Street either by travelling west to Dufferin Street or east to Strachan Avenue to travel north to King Street West. Both areas were once industrial lands but are now primarily residential.

==In popular culture==
A documentary film on Liberty Village titled ''[[Liberty Village – Somewhere in Heaven]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1768699/ The film "Liberty Village - Somewhere in Heaven" on the Internet Movie Database (IMDb)]&lt;/ref&gt; was produced and directed by David Sloma for Rockin' Films. The film was released in 2006 (before much of the current development was completed) and features interviews with longtime Liberty Village residents [[Corky Laing]] (who provided music for the soundtrack via his band [[Cork (band)|Cork]]), Taffi Rosen photographer/videographer, as well as other artists, business owners and workers in the area. The film was made in part with the support of the [[National Film Board of Canada]]  (NFB) through their Filmmaker Assistance Program.

Similar namesake companies in South Africa and Australia were legally named after the Woolworth company as permitted by the trademark laws of the period, but never had any financial connection to the original F. W. Woolworth Company. The reorganized American company is currently known as [[Foot Locker]].

'''Mario López Valdez''' (born January 18, 1957 in Cubiri de la Loma, Sinaloa), popularly known as Malova, is a Mexican businessman and politician, a member of the [[National Action Party (Mexico)|National Action Party]]. He was a senator of the state of [[Sinaloa]] from 2006 to 2010 and municipal president of [[Ahome Municipality]] from 2002 to 2004. He was the [[Governor of Sinaloa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.portalangop.co.ao/motix/en_us/noticias/internacional/2011/10/47/Gov-drug-plagued-Mexico-state-send-kids-abroad,1ce59f9e-0edd-4c7e-8ce2-01f47fffe3d4.html|title=Gov. of drug-plagued Mexico state send kids abroad|date=November 25, 2011|work=Angola Press|accessdate=2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 2011 to 2016.

==Background==
Mario López Valdez is an accounting graduate of the Technological Institute of Los Mochis (ITLM). In 1984, he founded the MALOVA hardware store chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ferretería MALOVA: Historia|url=http://www.malova.com.mx/pag/Historia.html|website=Ferretería MALOVA|accessdate=1 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150730223939/http://www.malova.com.mx/pag/Historia.html|archivedate=30 July 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
In 2002, López Valdez was elected municipal president of [[Ahome Municipality]], whose capital is [[Los Mochis]]. In 2005 Governor [[Jesús Aguilar Padilla]] appointed him secretary of Planning and Development in the state government. He was elected in 2006 as the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] (PRI) candidate for the Mexican Senate, where he served on the Regional Development and the Environment, Natural Resources and Fisheries, and Agriculture and Water Resources commissions. On March 19, 2010, he resigned his membership of the PRI to run as candidate for governor of Sinaloa for the PAN. He was elected July 4, 2010, defeating PRI candidate [[Jesús Vizcarra Calderón]], a wealthy businessman and Culiacán municipal president who had been linked to local drug traffickers, including [[Ismael Zambada García|Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wilkinson|first1=Tracy|last2=Ellingwood|first2=Ken|title=Suspicions of drug ties don't hurt candidates|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jul/04/world/la-fg-mexico-narco-politics-20100703/2|accessdate=1 September 2014|work=The Los Angeles Times|date=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is also buddies with El Chapo.

As governor, López Valdez has been accused of corruption and links to organized crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Tim|title=On drug lord’s Mexican turf, lines blur among cops, pols, cartel|url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2014/02/27/219597/on-drug-lords-mexican-turf-lines.html#storylink=cpy|accessdate=1 September 2014|work=McClatchy DC News|date=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Valdez Cárdenas|first1=Javier|title=Los ataques al Noroeste, responsabilidad del gobernador: desplegado de accionistas|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2014/04/06/politica/005n1pol|accessdate=1 September 2014|work=La Jornada|date=6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2014, he supported a bill that barred journalists from covering crime and public safety stories. However, López Valdez pledged to repeal the law just a few days after its unanimous passage in the state legislature, following a national outcry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tucker|first1=Duncan|title=Mexican governor backtracks on state censorship after media outcry|url=http://latincorrespondent.com/media/mexican-governor-backtracks-state-censorship-media-outcry/|accessdate=1 September 2014|work=Latin Correspondent|date=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Maryland Association of Certified Public Accountants''' is a statewide [[professional association]] that provides leadership, training, advocacy and resources for its nearly 10,000 certified public accountant-members, who are employed in private practice, industry, government, and education.

As [[Certified Public Accountant|CPA]]s, the MACPA’s members are business and financial professionals who are committed to protecting the public interest. In [[Maryland]], CPAs must pass [[Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination|a rigorous four-part examination]], adhere to strict ethical and professional standards and, beyond college, complete 80 hours of [[continuing education]] every two years to be certified by the state.

The MACPA is governed by a [[board of directors]], managed by a full-time staff, guided by a [[strategic plan]], and constantly striving to serve the needs of Maryland's certified public accountants.

== History ==
The MACPA was founded in 1901, less than a year after [[governor of Maryland|Maryland Governor]] [[John Walter Smith]] signed into law the third bill in the nation that recognized the need for certified public accountants. Recognizing the importance of trustworthy financial information in a [[market economy|market-based economy]], the law established requirements and state licensing for accountants who would meet certain educational, examination and experience standards to ensure the reliability of financial information.

Only certified public accountants are allowed to perform audits, which are often used by banks and other third parties for credit and borrowing purposes.

Max Teichmann became Maryland's first certified public accountant in 1900. Teichmann was a co-founder of the MACPA. Teichmann, considered the father of public accounting in Maryland, lobbied for passage of the certified public accountant law and was recognized as a key figure in the certified public accountant movement. He and a handful of other pioneers established the MACPA on February 12, 1901.

== Advocacy ==
The MACPA is active in state and federal government, monitoring and responding to issues that affect certified public accountants and their clients. The association has been successful in getting important legislation passed and supports legislation through the efforts of committee members and an active, statewide legislative network of members.

Its advocacy efforts are highlighted each year by CPA Day in [[Annapolis]], an annual event in which MACPA members discuss issues of importance in face-to-face meetings with their legislators in the [[Maryland General Assembly]]. An active Legislative Executive Committee monitors events and legislation in Annapolis and [[Washington, D.C.]], develops position papers on important issues and updates members on the status of key legislation.

The MACPA's political action committee educates legislators about matters that are important to the profession and supports like-minded lawmakers. An active "Key Person Program" recruits volunteer certified public accountants who know state legislators personally and can further educate them on key issues.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

== Training ==

{{Empty section|date=July 2014}}

== Member benefits ==
MACPA members receive a variety of publications (both print and electronic).

== Member activities ==
Seven chapters and numerous committees. Members are also active in the association's legislative efforts, various special-interest task forces, and in targeted groups like the Career Awareness Program, which tries to convince more young people to study accounting and enter the profession.

[[File:Olympic Committee 1906.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Nikolaos Thon (2nd from right), with the other members of the Organizing Committee of the [[1906 Intercalated Games]]]]
'''Nikolaos Thon''' ({{lang-el|Νικόλαος Θων}}; 1850–1906) was a [[Greece|Greek]] courtier and businessman.

He was born in Athens to a [[Bavarians|Bavarian]] who had come to Greece with King [[Otto of Greece|Otto]], and his Greek wife Marigo Vogiatzi. The ownership of mines in the [[Cyclades]] helped him amass considerable fortune, and he acquired extensive properties in [[Attica]]. Among the latter are the [[Thon Villa]] in [[Ampelokipoi, Athens|Ampelokipoi]], and the so-called "[[Palataki]]" (Palacette) in [[Haidari]]. 

He also provided the land on which the [[National Theatre of Greece]] was built in 1891, and served as its first director in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.n-t.gr/el/nationaltheatre/history/ | title = Εθνικό Θέατρο: Ιστορικό | publisher = National Theatre of Greece | language = Greek | accessdate = 4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nikolaos Thon also financed the construction of the Chapel of St. George on [[Mount Lycabettus]], was chairman of [[Panellinios G.S.]] and a member of the organizing committee for the [[1906 Intercalated Olympic Games]], and served King [[George I of Greece|George I]] as intendant of the royal estates.

'''Prince Moulay Rachid of Morocco''', also known as '''Prince Moulay Rachid ben al-Hassan''', [[Royal Victorian Order|GCVO]], ({{lang-ar|الأمير مولاي رشيد بن الحسن}}) was born on 20 June 1970 in [[Rabat]] as the youngest male child of the late [[Hassan II of Morocco|King Hassan II]] and his second wife, [[Lalla Latifa|Lalla Latifa Hammou]]. He holds a [[Doctor (title)|doctorate]] in international politics and serves Morocco as a diplomat. He is currently second in the line of succession to the [[Alaouite dynasty|Moroccan throne]].

==Early life and education==
Prince Moulay Rachid is the second son and fifth child of King Hassan II and his wife, [[Lalla Latifa|Lalla Latifa Hammou]]. Prince Moulay Rachid has one older brother, [[Mohammed VI of Morocco|King Mohammed VI]], and three sisters, [[Princess Lalla Meryem of Morocco|Princess Lalla Meryem]], [[Princess Lalla Asma of Morocco|Princess Lalla Asma]] and [[Princess Lalla Hasna of Morocco|Princess Lalla Hasna]].

After primary and secondary studies at the [[Royal College]] in Rabat and obtaining the [[Baccalauréat]] in June 1989, he entered [[Mohammed V University]] in Rabat to start his higher studies in Law. In May 1993, Prince Moulay Rachid obtained his Bachelor of Law (LL.B.) majoring in economic and social law. The same year the Prince received his License to Practice Law – [[Public law|Public Law]]. On 29 June 1995, the Prince completed his graduate studies and received a Master of Law (LL.M.) in Political Science. The [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] question was the subject of his research and the thesis that the Prince presented and supported publicly. In order to complete his training for his postgraduate education, in November 1993, the Prince started an internship with the United Nations in New York. On 18 May 2001, the Prince presented his doctorate thesis on the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] at the [[Université Montesquieu-Bordeaux IV]], which merited a specific mention for the quality of his work. On 21 June 1996, the Prince successfully completed the written and oral tests for his postgraduate education and received a postgraduate Degree in [[International Relations]].

===As heir to the Moroccan throne===
In 1999, after the death of his father and the enthronement of his brother [[Mohammed VI of Morocco|King Mohammed VI]], the prince became [[crown prince]], but in 2003, this position was granted to his newborn nephew [[Moulay Hassan, Crown Prince of Morocco|Moulay Hassan]]. The Prince is now second in line to the throne.

In 1999, a few analysts like Nicolas Beau and Catherine Graciet argued that Moulay Rachid might be better suited for the job of the king than his brother. They expressed their concern that Mohammed VI might not have adequate expertise to deal with militant Islamists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = http://www.editionsladecouverte.fr/liens/ps/d04452_intro.pdf|title = Quand le Maroc sera islamiste|publisher=Editions La Découverte|language = French|ISBN = 978-2-7071-5286-2|author=Nicolas Beau et Catherine Graciet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fouad Mourtada controversy==
On 5 February 2008, [[Fouad Mourtada]] was arrested on suspicion of stealing the identity of Moulay Rachid by creating a fake profile on Facebook as a joke. Although the prince did not seek to press charges, on 23 February, Fouad Mourtada was sentenced to three years in jail and fined 10,000 dirhams (~1,350 USD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7258950.stm|title = Jail for Facebook spoof Moroccan|publisher=BBC News

== Marriage ==
On 15 June 2014, he married Oum Kalthum Boufarès (born 1987).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.royalark.net/Morocco/morocco11.htm|title=MOROCCO11|website=www.royalark.net|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is daughter of Moulay El Mamoun Boufarès, former Minister of Interior, and maternal granddaughter of Lalla Khadija (a cousin of Mohammed V).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hola.com/realeza/2014061671965/boda-moulay-rachid-hermano-rey-mohamed-marruecos/|title=El príncipe Moulay Rachid, hermano de Mohamed VI, se compromete con Oum Keltoum Boufarès|date=2014-06-16|work=HOLA USA|access-date=2018-02-24|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 June 2016 their first child, a son, Moulay Ahmed was born.

==Biography==
Blumkin was born to a [[Jews in Belarus|Jewish]] family&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fau.edu/library/bro55b.htm | title=Jewish Heroes and Heroines in America | accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as Rose Gorelick in [[Schidrin]] near [[Minsk]], [[Belarus]] where her father was a [[rabbi]] and her mother ran a grocery store. When she was twenty, Rose married Isadore Blumkin. Blumkin immigrated to the United States in 1917 and [[Omaha, Nebraska]] in 1919 where she started a used clothing store and then opened the Nebraska Furniture Mart in 1937 originally selling used furniture.&lt;ref name="Snowball"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schroeder|first1=Alice|title=The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life|date=2009|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9781408807323|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NCB3ULgTzhkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn:1408807327&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwijkYStpJPbAhVH1lMKHVnWD8oQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blumkin grew that business to become the largest indoor furniture store in America and eventually sold 90% of the business to Buffett in 1983 for $60 million.&lt;ref name="Snowball" /&gt; Blumkin later opened another store and started competing with Buffett with "Mrs. B's Clearance and Factory Outlet across the street from the Furniture Mart" until Buffett acquired that company as well with a non-competition clause.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Feder|first1=Barnaby J.|title=Rose Blumkin, Retail Queen, Dies at 104|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/13/business/rose-blumkin-retail-queen-dies-at-104.html|accessdate=February 3, 2017|work=The New York Times|date=August 13, 1998|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203022037/http://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/13/business/rose-blumkin-retail-queen-dies-at-104.html|archivedate=February 3, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blumkin continued to be involved in day-to-day operations until shortly before her death at the age of 104.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9934">{{Crystallization}}
'''Shaping processes in crystal growth''' are a collection of techniques for growing bulk [[crystals]] of a defined shape from a melt, usually by constraining the shape of the liquid [[meniscus (liquid)|meniscus]] by means of a mechanical shaper. Crystals are commonly grown as fibers, solid cylinders, hollow cylinders (or tubes), and sheets (or plates). More complex shapes such as tubes with a complex cross section, and domes have also been produced.&lt;ref name="springer"&gt;Dobrovinskaya, Elena R., Leonid A. Lytvynov, and Valerian Pishchik. Sapphire: material, manufacturing, applications. Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2009. {{ISBN|0387856943}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using a shaping process can produce a [[near net shape]] crystal and reduce the manufacturing cost for crystals which are composed of very expensive or difficult to machine materials.

== List of shaping processes ==
* Edge-defined film-fed growth (EFG)
* Horizontal ribbon growth (HRG)
* [[Micro-pulling-down]] (µ-PD)
* Stepanov technique
* [[String ribbon]]

== Edge-defined film-fed growth ==
'''Edge-defined film-fed growth''' or '''EFG''' was developed for [[sapphire#synthetic sapphire|sapphire]] growth in the late 1960s by Harold LaBelle and A. Mlavsky at Tyco Industries.&lt;ref name="RobichaudHarris2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robichaud|first1=Joseph L.|last2=Harris|first2=Daniel C.|last3=Goodman|first3=William A.|title=A century of sapphire crystal growth: origin of the EFG method|volume=7425|year=2009|pages=74250P|issn=0277786X|doi=10.1117/12.824452}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A shaper (also referred to as a die) having dimensions approximately equal to the crystal to be grown rests above the surface of the melt which is contained in a [[crucible]]. [[Capillary action]] feeds liquid material to a slit at the center of the shaper. When a [[seed crystal]] is touched to the liquid film and raised upwards, a [[single crystal]] forms at the [[interface (matter)|interface]] between the solid seed and the liquid film. By continuing to pull the seed upwards, the crystal expands as a liquid film forms between the crystal and the top surface of the shaper. When the film reaches the edges of the shaper, the final crystal shape matches that of the shaper.

The exact dimensions of the crystal will deviate from the dimensions of the shaper because every material has a characteristic '''growth angle''', the angle formed at the triple interface between the solid crystal, liquid film, and the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Duffar"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Duffar|first1=Thierry|editor1-last=Rudolph|editor1-first=Peter|title=Handbook of Crystal Growth Vol. IIB|date=2015|publisher=Elsevier B.V.|pages=758-789|edition=2nd|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-444-63303-3.00019-5|chapter=Capillarity and Shape Stability in Crystal Growth from the Melt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the growth angle, varying the height of the meniscus (i.e. the thickness of the liquid film) will change the dimensions of the crystal. The meniscus height is affected by pulling speed and crystallization rate. The crystallization rate depends on the temperature gradient above the shaper, which is determined by the configuration of the hot-zone of the crystal growth [[vacuum furnace|furnace]], and the [[electric power|power]] applied to the heating elements during growth.  The difference in [[thermal expansion]] coefficients between the shaper material and the crystal material can also cause appreciable size differences between the shaper and the crystal at room temperature for crystals grown at high temperatures.  

The shaper material should be non-reactive with both the melt and growth atmosphere, and should be [[wetting|wet]] by the melt.&lt;ref name="Surek"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Surek|first1=T.|last2=Coriell|first2=S.R.|last3=Chalmers|first3=B.|title=The growth of shaped crystals from the melt|journal=Journal of Crystal Growth|volume=50|issue=1|year=1980|pages=21–32|issn=00220248|doi=10.1016/0022-0248(80)90227-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to grow multiple crystals from a single crucible using the EFG technique, for example by growing many parallel sheets. 

=== Applications ===

'''Sapphire''': EFG is used to grow large plates of [[sapphire]], primarily for use as robust [[infrared]] windows for [[arms industry|defense]] and other applications.

'''Silicon:''' EFG was used in the 2000s by [[Schott AG#Schott Solar|Schott Solar]] to produce [[silicon]] sheets for [[solar photovoltaic]] panels, by pulling a thin-walled (~250-300&amp;nbsp;μm) octagon with faces 12.5&amp;nbsp;cm on a side and diameter about 38&amp;nbsp;cm, about 5-6&amp;nbsp;m long.&lt;ref name="MackintoshSeidl2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mackintosh|first1=B|last2=Seidl|first2=A|last3=Ouellette|first3=M|last4=Bathey|first4=B|last5=Yates|first5=D|last6=Kelejs|first6=J|title=Large silicon crystal hollow-tube growth by the edge-defined film-fed growth (EFG) method|journal=Journal of Crystal Growth|date=25 January 2006|volume=287|issue=2|pages=428-432|doi=10.1016/j.jcrysgro.2005.11.058}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shaper is typically made from [[graphite]].

'''Other oxides''': Many high melting-point oxides have been grown by EFG, among them [[Gallium(III) oxide|Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Lithium niobate|LiNbO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], and Nd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;:(Lu&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Gd&lt;sub&gt;1−x&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ga&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; (Nd:LGGG).&lt;ref name="MuJia2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mu|first1=Wenxiang|last2=Jia|first2=Zhitai|last3=Yin|first3=Yanru|last4=Hu|first4=Qiangqiang|last5=Li|first5=Yang|last6=Tao|first6=Xutang|title=Growth of homogeneous Nd:LGGG single crystal plates by edge-defined film-fed growth method|journal=Journal of Crystal Growth|volume=478|year=2017|pages=17–21|issn=00220248|doi=10.1016/j.jcrysgro.2017.08.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Often an [[iridium]] shaper is used.

== Horizontal ribbon growth ==
'''Horizontal ribbon growth''' or '''HRG''' is a method developed for [[silicon]] by which a thin crystalline sheet is pulled horizontally from the top of a crucible. The melt level must be constantly replenished in order to keep the surface of the melt at the same height as the edge of the crucible from which the sheet is being pulled. By blowing a cooling gas at the surface of the growing sheet, very high growth rates (&gt;400 mm/min) can be achieved. &lt;ref name="Kudo1980"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kudo|first1=B.|title=Improvements in the Horizontal Ribbon Growth technique for single crystal silicon|journal=Journal of Crystal Growth|date=1980|volume=50|issue=1|pages=247-259|doi=10.1016/0022-0248(80)90248-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method relies on the solid crystal floating on the surface of the melt, which works because solid silicon is less dense than liquid silicon.

== Micro-pulling-down ==
:{{main|Micro-pulling-down}}

The '''micro-pulling-down''' or '''µ-PD''' technique uses a small round opening in the bottom of the crucible to pull a crystalline fiber downward. Hundreds of different crystalline materials have been grown by this technique.

A variation called '''pendant drop growth''' or '''PDG''' uses a slot in the bottom of the crucible to produce crystalline sheets in a similar manner.&lt;ref name="Duffar" /&gt;

== Stepanov technique ==
The '''Stepanov technique''' was developed  by A.V. Stepanov in the Soviet Union after 1950.&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt; The method involves pulling a crystal vertically through a shaper located at the surface of the melt. The shaper is not necessarily fed by a capillary channel as in EFG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tatartchenko|first1=Vitali|editor1-last=Dhanaraj|editor1-first=Govindhan|editor2-last=et. al.|title=Springer Handbook of Crystal Growth|date=2010|publisher=Springer|pages=537-541|chapter=Shaped Crystal Growth: TPS Brief History}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shaper material may be [[wetting|wetted]] or non-wetted by the melt, as opposed to EFG where the shaper material is wetted.&lt;ref name="Surek" /&gt; The technique has been used to grow metal, semiconductor, and oxide crystals.

[[Czochralski]] growth using a floating shaper known as a "coracle" was done for some [[III-V semiconductors]] prior to the development of advanced control-systems for diameter control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Winkler|first1=Jan|last2=Neubert|first2=Michael|editor1-last=Rudolph|editor1-first=Peter|title=Handbook of Crystal Growth|date=2015|publisher=Elsevier B.V.|page=1153|edition=2nd|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-444-63303-3.00028-6|chapter=Automation of Crystal Growth from Melt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== String ribbon ==
:{{main|String ribbon}}

The '''string ribbon''' method, also known as '''dendritic web''' or '''edge-supported pulling''', has been used to grow semiconductor sheets including [[indium antimonide]], [[gallium arsenide]], [[germanium]], and silicon.&lt;ref name="SeidenstickerHopkins1980"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seidensticker|first1=R.G.|last2=Hopkins|first2=R.H.|title=Silicon ribbon growth by the dendritic web process|journal=Journal of Crystal Growth|volume=50|issue=1|year=1980|pages=221–235|issn=00220248|doi=10.1016/0022-0248(80)90246-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A seed crystal with the width and thickness matching the sheet to be grown is dipped into the top surface of the melt. Strings of a suitable material are fixed to the vertical edges of the seed and extend down through holes in the bottom of the crucible to a spool. As the seed is raised, string is continuously fed through the melt and a liquid film forms between the seed, the strings, and the melt. The film crystallizes to the seed, forming a sheet or ribbon.

The features of Stride include chat rooms, one-on-one messaging, file sharing, 5 GB of file storage, group voice and video calling, built-in collaboration tools, and up to 25,000 of searchable message history. Premium features include unlimited file storage, users, group chat rooms, file sharing and storage, apps, and history retention. The premium version, priced at $3/user/month, also includes advanced meeting functionality like group screen sharing, remote desktop control, and dial-in/dial-out capabilities. Stride offered integrations with Atlassian's other products as well as other third-party applications listed in the Atlassian Marketplace, such as [[GitHub]], [[Giphy]], Stand-Bot and [[Google Calendar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pricing that scales for your team's needs|publisher=Stride|date=22 August 2017|url=https://www.stride.com/pricing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stride offered additional features beyond messaging to improve efficiency and productivity. It aimed to reduce collaboration noise by introducing a "focus" mode, and eliminates the divisions between text chat, voice meetings, and videoconferencing, by simplifying transitioning between these modes in the same channel.&lt;ref name="forbes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dignan |first=Larry |title=Atlassian launches Stride, aims to curb 'over-collaboration,' noise in team communication |url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/atlassian-launches-stride-aims-to-curb-over-collaboration-noise-in-team-communication/ |website=ZDNet |date=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stéphane Courbit''', (born 28 April 1965) is a French businessman in the sector of media and television.

In 2018, his net worth was estimated to be 800 million euros. He was listed as the 114th richest man in France.&lt;ref&gt;(fr) [https://www.challenges.fr/classements/fortune/stephane-courbit_1963/], ''Challenges''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

=== Beginnings ===
Stéphane Courbit graduated from the [[ISG Business School]] of Paris and the [[University Institutes of Technology]] of [[Valence, Drôme|Valence]].

In 1990, he took part in the talk show, ''[[Ciel, mon mardi !|Ciel, mon mardi!]]''. At the end of the show, he met the host, [[Christophe Dechavanne]], and made him a show proposal. Christophe Dechavanne hired him as an intern at its production company Coyote where Stéphane Courbit became the producer of shows such as ''Combien ça coûte ?'', ''Coucou c'est nous !'' and ''La Première Fois''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.4-traders.com/business-leaders/Stephane-Courbit-118/biography/?iPage=3 Stéphane Courbit], ''4-Traders''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Audiovisual Production ===
In September 1993, he made a brief appearance on [[TF1]] to work on the show ''TV Vision'' produced by Charles Villeneuve.

In the spring of 1994, he collaborated with [[Arthur (TV presenter)]] with whom he created the company CASE productions (''Courbit Arthur Stéphane Essebag''), which would become ASP (''Arthur Stéphane Productions'').

In 1998 and 2001, [[Endemol]] purchased ASP in two sessions and Stéphane Courbit became the president of Endemol France. In April 2001, Endemol France produced [[Loft Story (France)|Loft Story]], a reality television show aired by [[M6 (TV channel)|M6]].

== LOV Group ==

At the end of 2007, Stéphane Courbit left Endemol&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.endemol.com/news/endemol-france-appoints-new-ceo Virginie Calmels appointed CEO Endemol France], ''Endemol website'', 17 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; to create his own [[holding company]], LOV Group, focused on activities related to the entertainment and IT industries.

LOV Group operated in four main businesses so far :

=== Audiovisual production ===
In January 2008, alongside Groupe Arnault, the Agnelli and De Agostini families and AMS Industries, Stéphane Courbit created [[Banijay Group|Banijay Entertainment]], a holding company regrouping a dozen of production companies: Air Productions ([[Nagui]]), Banijay Productions -former ALJ- (Alexia Laroche-Joubert), H20 Productions ([[Cyril Hanouna]]) in France; Cuarzo in Spain; Brainpool in Germany; Nordisk in Norway; Bunim/Murray in the United States; Screentime in Australia. &lt;br /&gt;
Simultaneously in 2007, Courbit invested in Euro Media Group, the European leader in providing audiovisual services that owns the television studios of La Plaine St Denis through Studios de France.&lt;ref&gt;(fr)[http://www.purepeople.com/people/stephane-courbit_p130 Biographie de Stéphane Courbit], ''Pure People''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In July 2015, [[Banijay Group]] and [[Zodiak Media]] announced their merger, giving birth to the world's largest content production and distribution company not controlled by a media group in February 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gruppodeagostini.it/(S(evycbiepmdyz4vyc3zd44nee))/paginaAllegati.aspx?IdAllegato=554&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://variety.com/2015/tv/global/banijay-zodiak-to-merge-to-create-1-billion-production-house-1201549764/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Online gambling ===
At the end of 2007, Stéphane Courbit created Mangas Capital Gaming, renamed BetClic Everest Group, which acquired four companies in the area of Sports Gambling, [[Poker]] and on-line casino : Betclic in 2007, [[Expekt.com|Expekt]] and [[Bet-at-home.com|Bet-at-Home]] in 2009&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/mangas-gaming-owner-of-betclic-announces-the-acquisition-of-everest-gaming-a-leading-european-on-line-poker-platform-79401017.html Mangas Gaming, Owner of Betclic, Announces the Acquisition of Everest Gaming, a Leading European On Line Poker Platform], ''PR Newswire'', 16 December&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy ===

'''Thomas Andrews, Jr.''' (7 February 1873 – 15 April 1912) was a British businessman and [[shipbuilder]]. He was [[managing director]] and head of the drafting department of the shipbuilding company [[Harland and Wolff]] in [[Belfast]], Ireland. As the [[naval architect]] in charge of the plans for the ocean liner {{RMS|Titanic}}, he was travelling on board that vessel during her maiden voyage when the ship hit an iceberg on 14 April 1912. He perished along with more than 1,500 others. His body was never recovered.

==Biography==

===Early life===
[[File:Andrews Family.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Thomas (second from right) with family, circa 1895.]]
Thomas Andrews was born at Ardara House, [[Comber]], [[County Down]], in Ireland, to [[The Right Honourable|The Rt. Hon.]] Thomas Andrews, a member of the [[Privy Council of Ireland]], and Eliza Pirrie. Andrews was a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] of [[Scottish people|Scottish]] descent, and like his brother considered himself British. 
His siblings included [[John Miller Andrews]], the future [[Prime Minister of Northern Ireland]], and [[Sir James Andrews, 1st Baronet|Sir James Andrews]], the future [[Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland]]. Thomas Andrews lived with his family in Ardara, Comber. In 1884, he began attending the [[Royal Belfast Academical Institution]] until 1889 when, at the age of sixteen, he began a premium apprenticeship at [[Harland and Wolff]] where his uncle, the [[William Pirrie, 1st Viscount Pirrie|Viscount Pirrie]], was part owner.
[[File:Andrews Family 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Andrews with wife, Helen Barbour, and daughter, Elizabeth Law Barber Andrews]]

===Harland and Wolff===
At Harland and Wolff, he began with three months in the joiners' shop, followed by a month in the cabinetmakers' and then a further two months working on the ships. The last eighteen months of his five-year [[apprenticeship]] were spent in the drawing office. In 1901, Andrews, after working his way up through the many departments of the company, became the manager of the construction works. That same year, he also became a member of the [[Royal Institution of Naval Architects|Institution of Naval Architects]]. In 1907, Andrews was appointed the managing director and head of the drafting department at Harland and Wolff. During his long years of apprenticeship, study, and work, Andrews had become well liked in the company and amongst the shipyard's employees.

On 24 June 1908, he married Helen Reilly Barbour, daughter of textile industrialist John Doherty Barbour and sister to Rt Hon Sir John [[Milne Barbour]]- known as "Milne". Their daughter, Elizabeth Law-Barbour Andrews (known by her initials, "ELBA"), was born on 27 November 1910. The couple lived at Dunallan, 20 Windsor Avenue, Belfast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/pages/1911/Antrim/Windsor_Ward/Windsor_Avenue/170560/ NationalArchives.ie]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ulsterhistory.co.uk/thomasandrews.htm Ulster History Cycle] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605053725/http://www.ulsterhistory.co.uk/thomasandrews.htm |date=5 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is known that Andrews took Helen to view the RMS ''Titanic'' one night, shortly before Elizabeth was born. After Thomas's death, Helen remarried; she died 22 August 1966 in [[Northern Ireland]] and is buried in the Barbour family mausoleum at Lambeg.

==RMS ''Titanic''==
In 1907, Andrews began to oversee the plans for a new [[Superliner (passenger ship)|superliner]], the {{RMS|Olympic}} for the [[White Star Line]]. The ''Olympic'' and its sister ship the {{RMS|Titanic||2}}, which began construction in 1909, were designed by [[William Pirrie, 1st Viscount Pirrie|William Pirrie]] and general manager [[Alexander Carlisle]] along with Andrews. As he had done for the other ships he had overseen, Andrews familiarised himself with every detail of the ''Olympic'' and ''Titanic'', in order to ensure that they were in optimal working order. Andrews's suggestions that the ship have 46 lifeboats (instead of the 20 it ended up with) as well as a [[double hull]] and watertight bulkheads that went up to B deck, were overruled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.titanicuniverse.com/thomas-andrews/3156 |title=Thomas Andrews – A Talented Designer That Met With A Tragic Fate |publisher=Titanicuniverse.com |date=16 September 2014 |accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{vc|date=September 2017}}

Andrews headed a group of Harland and Wolff workers who went on the [[maiden voyage]]s of the ships built by the company (the guarantee group), to observe ship operations and spot any necessary improvements. The ''Titanic'' was no exception, so Andrews and the rest of his Harland and Wolff group travelled from Belfast to [[Southampton]] on ''Titanic'' for the beginning of her maiden voyage on 10 April 1912. During the voyage, Andrews took notes on various improvements he felt were needed, primarily cosmetic changes to various facilities. However, on 14 April, Andrews remarked to a friend that ''Titanic'' was "as nearly perfect as human brains can make her."

On 14 April at 11:40 PM, the ''Titanic'' struck an [[iceberg]] on the ship's [[Port and starboard|starboard]] side. Andrews had been in his stateroom, planning changes he wanted to make to the ship, and barely noticed the collision. [[Edward Smith (sea captain)|Captain Edward J. Smith]] had Andrews summoned to help examine the damage. Andrews and Captain Smith discussed the damage to the ship shortly after midnight after Andrews had toured the damaged section of the ship and received several reports of the vessel's damage. Andrews determined that the first five of the ship's watertight compartments were rapidly flooding. Andrews knew that if more than four of the ship's forward compartments flooded, it would inevitably sink. He relayed this information to Captain Smith, stating that it was a 'mathematical certainty', and adding that in his opinion, the vessel had only about an hour before it completely sank. He also informed Smith of the severe shortage of lifeboats on board the ship.

As the evacuation of the ''Titanic'' began, Andrews tirelessly searched [[Stateroom#On board a ship|stateroom]]s telling the passengers to put on [[Personal flotation device|lifebelts]] and go up on deck.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvsp|Mark Chirnside|2004|p=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several survivors testify to have met or spotted Andrews several times.
Fully aware of the short time the ship had left and of the lack of [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]] space for all passengers and crew, he continued to urge reluctant people into the lifeboats in the hope of filling them with as many people as possible.

===Death===
[[Image:SmokeRoom.jpg|thumb|left|Andrews was reportedly last seen in the first-class smoking room, although this has been disputed.]]
Andrews was reportedly last seen by John Stewart, a steward on the ship, at approximately 2:10&amp;nbsp;a.m., ten minutes before the Titanic sank into the Atlantic. Andrews was standing alone in the first-class smoking room staring at a painting, ''Plymouth Harbour'', above the fireplace, arms folded over his chest, his lifejacket lying on a nearby table.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1994|p=155}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvsp|Walter Lord|1998|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvsp|Mark Chirnside|2004|p=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting depicted the entrance to [[Plymouth Sound]], which ''Titanic'' had been expected to visit on her return voyage.&lt;ref&gt;The painting is often incorrectly shown on television and in movies as depicting the entrance to [[New York Harbor]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Although this has become one of the most famous legends of the sinking of the ''Titanic'' – published in a 1912 book (''Thomas Andrews: Shipbuilder'' by [[Shan Bullock]]) and thereby perpetuated – Stewart, in fact, left the ship in a lifeboat at approximately 1:40&amp;nbsp;a.m.,&lt;ref name="seaofglass"&gt;''On a Sea of Glass: The Life &amp; Loss of the RMS Titanic'' by Tad Fitch, J. Kent Layton &amp; Bill Wormstedt. Amberley Books, March 2012. pp 321-323&lt;/ref&gt; half an hour before his reputed sighting of Andrews.

There were testimonies of sightings of Andrews after that moment.&lt;ref name="seaofglass" /&gt; It appears that Andrews stayed in the smoking room for some time, then continued assisting with the evacuation.&lt;ref name="seaofglass" /&gt; At around 2:00&amp;nbsp;a.m., he was seen back on the boat deck. The crowd had begun to stir, but there were still women reluctant to leave the ship. To be heard and to draw attention to himself, Andrews waved his arms and announced to them in a loud voice.&lt;ref name=Chap8/&gt; Another reported sighting was of Andrews frantically throwing deck chairs into the ocean for passengers to cling to in the water, though he may have been mistaken for chief baker Charles Joughin, who survived the sinking and reported doing the same thing.&lt;ref name=TIP&gt;[http://www.titanicinquiry.org/BOTInq/BOTInq06Joughin01.php ''British Wreck Commissioner's Inquiry Day 6 – Testimony of Charles Joughin''], ''Titanic Inquiry Project''. Retrieved on 5 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; He then headed towards the bridge, perhaps in search of Captain Smith.&lt;ref name=Chap8&gt;{{en icon}} [http://www.libraryireland.com/Thomas-Andrews-Shipbuilder/Sinking-Titanic.php « ''The sinking of the ''Titanic »], ''Thomas Andrews Shipbuilder''. Consulté le 21 avril 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Andrews was last seen leaving the ship in its final moments. His body was never recovered.

On 19 April 1912, his father received a telegram from his mother's cousin, who had spoken with survivors in New York: "INTERVIEW TITANIC'S OFFICERS. ALL UNANIMOUS THAT ANDREWS HEROIC UNTO DEATH, THINKING ONLY SAFETY OTHERS. EXTEND HEARTFELT SYMPATHY TO ALL."

==Legacy==
[[File:12 July 2012 parade, Belfast 09.JPG|thumb|240px|[[Unionism in Ireland|Unionist]] mural in [[Belfast]] commemorating Thomas Andrews]]
Newspaper accounts of the disaster labelled Andrews a hero. Mary Sloan, a stewardess on the ship, whom Andrews persuaded to enter a lifeboat, later wrote in a letter: "Mr. Andrews met his fate like a true hero, realising the great danger, and gave up his life to save the [[Women and children first|women and children]] of the ''Titanic''. They will find it hard to replace him." A short biography was produced within the year by [[Shan Bullock]] at the request of [[Horace Plunkett|Sir Horace Plunkett]], a member of Parliament, who felt that Andrews' life was worthy of being memorialised.

In his home town, Comber, one of the earliest and most substantial memorials for a single victim of the ''Titanic'' disaster was built. The [[Thomas Andrews Jr. Memorial Hall]] was opened in January 1914. The architects were Young and McKenzie with sculpted work by the artist [[Rosamond Praeger|Sophia Rosamond Praeger]]. The hall is now maintained by the South Eastern Education Board and used by The Andrews Memorial Primary School. An Ulster History Circle blue plaque is located on his house in Windsor Avenue, Belfast.

Today, the [[SS Nomadic (1911)|SS ''Nomadic'']] is the sole surviving ship designed by Andrews.

Asteroid [[245158 Thomasandrews]] was named in his honour in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/asteroid-named-for-titanic-designer-thomas-andrews.html|title=Asteroid Named for Titanic Designer Thomas Andrews|last=Levy|first=David|work=[[Encyclopedia Titanica]]|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7166">In industry, '''total productive maintenance''' ('''TPM''') is a system of maintaining and improving the integrity of production and quality systems through the machines, equipment, processes, and employees that add [[business value]] to an organization 

TPM focuses on keeping all equipment in top working condition to avoid breakdowns and delays in manufacturing processes.

== History==
The term ''total productive maintenance'' is attributed to Nippondenso, a company that created parts for Toyota.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.plant-maintenance.com/articles/tpm_intro.shtml|title = An Introduction tpm in www.plant-maintenance.com|access-date = 2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Seiichi Nakajima]] is regarded as the father of TPM because of his numerous contributions to TPM.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.cetpm.de/downloads/nakajima/index.htm|title = Seiichi Nakajima - The Principles and Practice of TPM|website = www.cetpm.de|access-date = 2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objectives ==
One of the main objectives of TPM is to increase the productivity of a factory and its equipment with a modest investment in maintenance. [[Total quality management]] (TQM) and total productive maintenance (TPM) are considered as the key operational activities of the quality management system. In order for TPM to be effective, the full support of the total workforce is required. This should result in accomplishing the goal of TPM: "Enhance the volume of the production, employee morale and job satisfaction."&lt;ref name="2013-prabhuswamy-et-al"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Prabhuswamy | first1=M | last2=Nagesh | first2=P  | last3=Ravikumar
 | first3=K  | title=Statistical Analysis and Reliability Estimation of Total Productive Maintenance | ssrn=2246601 | journal=IUP Journal of Operations Management | volume= XII | number=1 |date=February 2013 | pages= 7–20 | publisher=[[Social Science Electronic Publishing]] | location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main objective of TPM is to increase the [[Overall equipment effectiveness|Overall Equipment Effectiveness]] (OEE) of plant equipment. TPM addresses the causes for accelerated deterioration while creating the correct environment between operators and equipment to create ownership.

OEE has three factors which are multiplied to give one measure called OEE&lt;br&gt;
'''Performance x Availability x Quality = OEE'''

Each factor has two associated losses making 6 in total, these 6 losses are as follows:

'''Performance''' = (1) running at reduced speed - (2) Minor Stops

'''Availability''' = (3) Breakdowns - (4) Product changeover

'''Quality''' = (5) Startup rejects - (6) Running rejects

The objective finally is to identify then prioritize and eliminate the causes of the losses. This is done by self-managing teams that solve problem. Employing consultants to create this culture is common practice.

=== Principles ===
The eight pillars of TPM&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.seebo.com/total-productive-maintenance/|title=Industry 4.0 &amp; The 8 Pillars of Total Productive Maintenance|last=|first=|date=|work=Seebo|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; are mostly focused on proactive and preventive techniques for improving equipment reliability:

# Autonomous Maintenance
# Focused Improvement
# Planned Maintenance 
# Quality management
# Early/equipment management
# Education and Training 
# Safety Health Environment
# Administrative &amp; office TPM


With the help of these pillars we can increase productivity.
Manufacturing support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leanproduction.com/tpm.html|accessdate=7 March 2015|title=TPM-Total Productive Maintenance at LeanProduction.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implementation ==
Following are the steps involved by the implementation of TPM in an organization:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

- Initial evaluation of TPM level,

- Introductory Education and Propaganda (IEP) for TPM,

- Formation of TPM committee,

- Development of master plan for TPM implementation,

- Stage by stage training to the employees and stakeholders on all eight pillars of TPM,

- Implementation preparation process,

- Establishing the TPM policies and goals and development of a road map for TPM implementation.

According to Nicholas,&lt;ref name=1998-nicholas&gt;{{cite book | last=Nicholas | first=John | year=1998 | title=Competitive manufacturing management | publisher=McGraw-Hill | location=Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt; the steering committee should consist of production managers, maintenance managers, and engineering managers. The committee should formulate TPM policies and strategies and give advice. This committee should be led by a top-level executive. Also a TPM program team must rise, this program team has oversight and coordination of implementation activities. As well, it's lacking some crucial activities, like starting with partial implementation. Choose the first target area as a pilot area, this area will demonstrate the TPM concepts.&lt;ref name=1998-nicholas/&gt; Lessons learned from early target areas/the pilot area can be applied further in the implementation process.

In the UK foundry industry an implementation model was published in several Foundryman magazines by the Institute of British Foundrymen. Journal articles written by Toni Carannante CEng,  offer an implementation model with proven success and remain available from the Institute of Cast Metals Engineers (ICME).

== Difference from TQM ==
[[Total quality management]] and total productive maintenance are often used interchangeably. However, TQM and TPM share a lot of similarities, but are considered as two different approaches in the official literature. TQM attempts to increase the quality of goods, services and concomitant customer satisfaction by raising awareness of quality concerns across the organization.&lt;ref name=2008-wienclaw&gt;{{cite book | last=Wienclaw | first=R | year=2008 | title= Operations &amp; Business Process Management  | publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

TQM is based on five cornerstones: The product, the process that allows the product to be produced, the organization that provides the proper environment needed for the process to work, the leadership that guides the organization, and commitment to excellence throughout the organization.&lt;ref name=1994-creech&gt;{{cite book | last=Creech | first=Bill | year=1994 | title= Five Pillars of TQM: How to Make Total Quality Management Work for You | publisher=E P Dutton }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words, TQM focuses on the quality of the product, while TPM focuses on the equipment used to produce the products. By preventing equipment break-down, improving the quality of the equipment and by standardizing the equipment (results in less variance, so better quality), the quality of the products increases. TQM and TPM can both result in an increase of quality. However, the way of going there is different. TPM can be seen as a way to help achieving the goal of TQM.{{citation needed|date = February 2014}}

'''Wage labour''' (also '''wage labor''' in [[American English]]) is the [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] relationship between a [[Workforce|worker]] and an [[Employment|employer]], where the worker sells his or her labour under a formal or informal [[employment contract]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Steinfeld|2009|p=3}}: "All labor contracts were/are designed legally to bind a worker in one way or another to fulfill the labor obligations the worker has undertaken. That is one of the principal purposes of labor contracts."&lt;/ref&gt; These transactions usually occur in a [[labour market]] where [[wage]]s are market determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Deakin|Wilkinson|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In exchange for the wages paid, the work product generally becomes the [[work for hire|undifferentiated property]] of the employer, except  for special cases such as the vesting of [[intellectual property]] patents in the United States where [[Patent#Ownership|patent rights]] are [[Freelancer|usually]] vested in the employee personally responsible for the invention. A [[wage labourer]] is a person whose primary means of income is from the selling of his or her labour in this way.

== Characteristics ==
In modern mixed economies such as those of the [[OECD]] countries, it is currently the most common form of work arrangement. Although most labour is organised as per this structure, the wage work arrangements of [[CEO]]s, professional employees, and professional contract workers are sometimes conflated with [[working class|class assignments]], so that "wage labour" is considered to apply only to unskilled, semi-skilled or [[manual labour]]. Various studies have shown that employees generally spend 1.5 to 3 hours a day on non-work related activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paulsen|first=Roland|date=2013-12-26|title=Non-work at work: Resistance or what?|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1350508413515541|journal=Organization|language=en|volume=22|issue=3|pages=351–367|doi=10.1177/1350508413515541}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
The most common form of wage labour currently is ordinary direct, or "full-time". This is employment in which a free worker sells his or her labour for an indeterminate time (from a few years to the entire career of the worker), in return for a money-wage or salary and a continuing relationship with the employer which it does not in general offer contractors or other irregular staff. However, wage labour takes many other forms, and explicit as opposed to implicit (i.e. conditioned by local labour and tax law) contracts are not uncommon. Economic history shows a great variety of ways, in which labour is traded and exchanged. The differences show up in the form of:
* Employment status – a worker could be employed full-time, part-time, or on a casual basis. He or she could be employed for example temporarily for a specific project only, or on a permanent basis. Part-time wage labour could combine with part-time [[self-employment]]. The worker could be employed also as an [[apprenticeship|apprentice]].
* Civil (legal) status – the worker could for example be a free citizen, an [[indentured labour]]er, the subject of [[forced labour]] (including some prison or army labour); a worker could be assigned by the political authorities to a task, they could be a [[slavery|semi-slave]] or a [[serfdom|serf]] bound to the land who is hired out part of the time. So the labour might be performed on a more or less voluntary basis, or on a more or less involuntary basis, in which there are many gradations.
* Method of payment ([[remuneration]] or [[Compensation of employees|compensation]]) – The work done could be paid "in cash" (a money-wage) or "in kind" (through receiving goods and/or services), or in the form of "[[Piecework|piece rates]]" where the wage is directly dependent on how much the worker produces. In some cases, the worker might be paid in the form of credit used to buy goods and services, or in the form of [[stock options]] or [[shares]] in an enterprise.
* Method of hiring – the worker might engage in a labour-contract on his or her own initiative, or he or she might hire out their labour as part of a group. But he or she may also hire out their labour via an intermediary (such as an employment agency) to a third party. In this case, he or she is paid by the intermediary, but works for a third party which pays the intermediary. In some cases, labour is [[subcontracting|subcontracted]] several times, with several intermediaries. Another possibility is that the worker is assigned or posted to a job by a political authority, or that an agency hires out a worker to an enterprise ''together'' with [[means of production]].

== Criticisms ==

{{main|Wage slavery}}
Wage labour has long been compared to slavery by socialists.&lt;ref name="English Working Class p. 599"&gt;{{Harvnb|Thompson|1966|p=599}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="English Working Class p. 912"&gt;{{Harvnb|Thompson|1966|p=912}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Geoffrey Ostergaard p. 133"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ostergaard|1997|p=133}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shop Floor p. 37"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lazonick|1990|p=37}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the term "[[Labour economics#Wage slavery|wage slavery]]" is often utilised as a pejorative for wage labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hallgrimsdottir|Benoit|2007}}; {{Harvnb|Roediger|2007a}}.&lt;br&gt;The term is not without its critics, as {{Harvnb|Roediger|2007b|p=247}}, notes: "[T]he challenge to loose connections of wage (or white) slavery to chattel slavery was led by [[Frederick Douglass]] and other Black, often fugitive, abolitionists. Their challenge was mercilessly concrete. Douglass, who tried out speeches in work places before giving them in halls, was far from unable to speak to or hear white workers, but he and [[William Wells Brown]] did challenge metaphors regarding white slavery sharply. They noted, for example, that their escapes from slavery had left job openings and wondered if any white workers wanted to take the jobs."&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, advocates of slavery looked upon the "comparative evils of Slave Society and of Free Society, of slavery to human Masters and slavery to Capital,"&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fitzhugh|1857|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ECdb7EjiBnEC&amp;pg=PR16 xvi]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and proceeded to argue persuasively that wage slavery was actually ''worse'' than [[chattel slavery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Carsel|1940}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Slavery apologists like [[George Fitzhugh]] contended that workers only accepted wage labour with the passage of time, as they became "familiarized and inattentive to the infected social atmosphere they continually inhale[d]."&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"/&gt;

{{quote box|quote=The slave, together with his labour-power, was sold to his owner once for all.... The [wage] labourer, on the other hand, sells his very self, and that by fractions....

According to [[Noam Chomsky]], analysis of the psychological implications of wage slavery goes back to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] era. In his 1791 book ''On the Limits of State Action'', classical [[liberalism|liberal]] thinker [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] explained how "whatever does not spring from a man's free choice, or is only the result of instruction and guidance, does not enter into his very nature; he does not perform it with truly human energies, but merely with mechanical exactness" and so when the labourer works under external control, "we may admire what he does, but we despise what he is."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chomsky|1993|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=DIpW10rWZFAC&amp;pg=PA19 19]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Both the [[Milgram experiment|Milgram]] and [[Stanford experiment]]s have been found useful in the psychological study of wage-based workplace relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Thye|Lawler|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, as per anthropologist [[David Graeber]], the earliest wage labour contracts we know about were in fact contracts for the rental of chattel slaves (usually the owner would receive a share of the money, and the slave, another, with which to maintain his or her living expenses.) Such arrangements, according to Graeber, were quite common in New World slavery as well, whether in the United States or Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Graeber|2004|p=[http://www.eleuthera.it/files/materiali/David_Graeber_Fragments_%20Anarchist_Anthropology.pdf 71]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[C. L. R. James]] argued in ''[[The Black Jacobins]]'' that most of the techniques of human organisation employed on factory workers during the industrial revolution were first developed on slave plantations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Graeber|2007|p=106}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Marxists, labour-as-commodity, which is how they regard wage labour,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Marx|1990|p=1006}}: "[L]abour-power, a commodity sold by the worker himself."&lt;/ref&gt; provides a fundamental point of attack against capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Another one, of course, being the capitalists' theft from workers via [[surplus-value]].&lt;/ref&gt; "It can be persuasively argued," noted one concerned philosopher, "that the conception of the worker's labour as a commodity confirms Marx's stigmatisation of the wage system of private capitalism as 'wage-slavery;' that is, as an instrument of the capitalist's for reducing the worker's condition to that of a slave, if not below it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nelson|1995|p=158}}. This Marxist objection is what motivated Nelson's essay, which argues that labour is not, in fact, a commodity.&lt;/ref&gt; That this objection is fundamental follows immediately from Marx's conclusion that wage labour is the very foundation of capitalism: "Without a ''class dependent on wages'', the moment individuals confront each other as free persons, there can be no production of surplus value; without the production of surplus-value there can be no capitalist production, and hence no capital and no capitalist!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Marx|1990|p=1005}}. Emphasis in the original.&lt;br&gt;See also p.&amp;nbsp;716: "[T]he capitalist produces [and reproduces] the worker as a wage-labourer. This incessant reproduction, this perpetuation of the worker, is the absolutely necessary condition for capitalist production."&lt;/ref&gt;
