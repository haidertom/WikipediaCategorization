'''''Altarpiece of the Holy Sacrament''''' or '''''Triptych of the Last Supper''''' is a 1464&amp;ndash;1468 dated [[triptych]] attributed to [[Dieric Bouts]], now reassembled and held at its location of origin at [[St. Peter's Church, Leuven]].

==Description==
[[File:Dieric Bouts - The Last Supper - WGA03003.jpg|thumb|Central panel]]
The ''[[Last Supper]]'' is the theme of the central panel of the altarpiece, commissioned from Bouts by the [[Leuven Confraternity of the Holy Sacrament]] in 1464. All of the [[orthogonal]]s in this composition display an understanding of [[perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]].&lt;ref&gt;J.M. Collier, Linear perspective in Flemish painting and the Art of Petrus Christus and Dirk Bouts, Diss. University of Michigan 1975, Ann Arbor 1977&lt;/ref&gt; The lines lead to a single vanishing point in the center of the mantelpiece above Christ's head, though outside the room, the small side room has its own vanishing point, and neither it nor the vanishing point of the main room falls on the horizon of the landscape seen through the windows. 

Dieric Bouts was not a native of Leuven. He moved there from [[Haarlem]] and his ''Last Supper'' was the first [[Flemish painting|Flemish]] [[panel painting]] of its kind. In this central panel, Bouts has introduced the idea of a group portrait around a table, a theme known to council members in Haarlem. Christ is depicted larger than life in the role of a priest performing the [[Eucharist in the Catholic Church|consecration of the Eucharistic]] [[Sacramental bread|host]] from the [[Catholic Mass]]. The men around him are shown a half-size smaller, and probably are accurate portraits of prominent members of the confraternity. Bouts was not the only artist traveling between Haarlem and Leuven. While he was working on this triptych, the church was still being built and the architect [[Antoon I Keldermans]] was the same man hired by the Haarlem parish.

File:Cornelis Gerritsz Decker - Bavokerk van de Oude Groenmarkt - FHM OS-66-332.JPG|St. Bavo's in Haarlem seen from the southwest
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Bouts main contribution to Flemish painting was his introduction of everyday details in the main panel such as the houses on the other side of the market square that can be seen through the windows, and the servants dressed in modern clothing beyond the central scene around the table. Although once identified as the artist himself and his two sons, these servants are most likely more portraits of the confraternity's members responsible for commissioning the altarpiece. This painting was copied by [[Aelbrecht Bouts]], who disregarded the architectural elements through the windows, because by that time the church and the town square had changed. Leuven had built a new town hall, for which Dieric also made a large panel as an allegory of justice.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==History==
The work was documented by Leuven archivist Edward van Even in 1870 and lent to his friend James Weale for his [[Exposition des primitifs flamands à Bruges|1902 Exhibition of Flemish Primitives]] in [[Bruges]].&lt;ref&gt;Van Even, Edward, (1) ''Louvain monumental'', 1860, and (2) ''Louvain dans le passé et le présent'',1895  p. 328&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Altarpiece of the Holy Sacrament'' has four additional panels, two on each side. Because these were taken to the museums in Berlin and Munich in the 19th century, the reconstruction of the original altarpiece has been difficult.&lt;ref&gt;(Dutch with French summary) R. Lefève en F. van Molle, '[http://balat.kikirpa.be/doc/pdf/BIB_KIKIRPA_BUL_1960_003_005-019.pdf De oorspronkelijke schikking van de luiken van Bouts' Laatste Avondmaal]', Bulletin Koninklijk Instituut van het Kunstpatrimonium 3 (1960), p. 5-19 in [[BALaT database]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhm.de/datenbank/ccp/dhm_ccp_add.php?seite=6&amp;fld_1=1551 Record 1551] in the German [[Looted Art]] database&lt;/ref&gt; Today it is thought that the panel with Abraham and Melchizedek is above the Passover Feast on the left wing, while the Gathering of the Manna is above Elijiah and the Angel on the right wing. All of these are [[typology (theology)|typological]] precursors to the Last Supper in the central panel.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The church has two paintings by Bouts on display, the ''Last Supper'' (1464-1468) and the ''Martyrdom of St Erasmus'' (1465). The [[Nazi]]s seized ''The Last Supper'' in 1942.&lt;ref name="nazi contraband"&gt;{{cite book

'''Amdo Jampa''' (born 1911 in [[Jainca County|Chentsa]], [[Amdo]], [[Tibet]], died {{date|March 28, 2002}}, [[Lhasa]], [[Tibet Autonomous Region]], [[China]]), also known as '''Jampa Tseten''', was a [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] painter.

== Biography ==
[[File:Die drei großen religiösen Könige.jpg|thumb|''The Three Great Dharma Kings'' by Amdo Jampa, Drepung]]
Amdo Jampa was known for his photo-realistic style. He made famous portraits of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama.&lt;ref name="TIN"&gt;[http://www.tibet.ca/en/newsroom/wtn/archive/old?y=2002&amp;m=5&amp;p=24-2_5 Obituary of the painter Amdo Jampa], TIN, 22 May 2002 / no of pages: 3 {{ISSN|1355-3313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was one of the first Tibetan artists to study at a Chinese art college.&lt;ref name="TIN" /&gt;

He was a student of the Tibetan scholar and artist [[Gendün Chöphel]].&lt;ref name="TIN" /&gt;

As a teenager, he became a monk at [[Drepung Monastery]] and study traditional Tibetan thangka painting. He left Drepung when he accompanied the Dalai Lama to [[Beijing]] in 1954.&lt;ref name="TIN" /&gt;

There, he studied traditional Chinese painting and Western painting techniques under the guidance of the Chinese teacher Li Zhongjin.&lt;ref name="TIN" /&gt;

When he came back in Lhasa in 1956, he was commissioned to paint in the Tagtu Mingyur Podrang new palace recently completed in the [[Norbulingka]]. His murals merged a traditional Tibetan style with a modern one. The innovation he introduced was that his portraits were easily recognisable.&lt;ref name="TIN" /&gt;

The [[Choekyi Gyaltsen, 10th Panchen Lama]], later asked Amdo Jampa a portrait, which he also realised in realist style.&lt;ref name="TIN" /&gt;

Amdo Jampa travelled to India in the 1980s. He performed paintings for religious buildings for the Dalai Lama in [[Dharamshala]].&lt;ref name="TIN" /&gt;

He returned to Lhasa, Tibet. According to Drangchar, a Tibetan magazine, he occupied the official positions of Chairman of the Tibet Fine Arts Association and Chief Research Officer of the Central Executive Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Museum of Cultural Artefacts. He opened an art school in Shol village, before the Potala Palace.&lt;ref name="TIN" /&gt;

Amdo Jampa's paintings spread in Tibet and influenced Tibetan contemporary painting. 
Hence, before 1996 when the Chinese ban on Dalai Lama pictures, many monasteries had such a picture in the style of Amdo Jampa's famous painting of the Dalai Lama.&lt;ref name="TIN" /&gt;

According to Gonkar Gyatso, a Tibetan artist from Lhasa now in the UK, Amdo Jampa is the most important Tibetan modern artist. He was trained in the 1950s at thangka painting and he was the only one to perform original works different from traditional painting and had the support of the [[14th Dalai Lama]] for his creative work. His paintings were partly influenced by painters such as [[Vittore Carpaccio]].&lt;ref name="TIN" /&gt;

For [[Jamyang Norbu]], Amdo Jampa was influenced by Gendun Choephel who travelled in India and knew Indian Buddhist and Hindu art as well as European art, as seen in his nudes and dancers. Like other Tibetan artists, Amdo Jampa did not produce anything during the [[Cultural Revolution]] years.&lt;ref name="TIN" /&gt;

Even at an old age, Amdo Jampa walked every day around Lhasa, performing a ''[[Kora (pilgrimage)|kora]]''. He was survived by his wife, 2 daughters and 2 sons.&lt;ref name="TIN" /&gt;

Polish art has often reflected European trends while maintaining its unique character. The [[Kraków]] school of Historicist painting developed by [[Jan Matejko]] produced monumental portrayals of customs and significant events in Polish history.

Artists of the twentieth-century Avant-Garde represented various schools and trends. The art of [[Tadeusz Makowski]] was influenced by [[Cubism]]; while [[Władysław Strzemiński]] and [[Henryk Stażewski]] worked within the Constructivist idiom. Distinguished contemporary artists include [[Roman Opałka]], [[Wilhelm Sasnal]], Leon Tarasewicz, [[Jerzy Nowosielski]], [[Wojciech Siudmak]], [[Mirosław Bałka]], and [[Katarzyna Kozyra]] and Zbigniew Wąsiel in the younger generation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1187">'''Chromolithe''' ("light from stone") is a [[light art]] that gives the impression that the buildings have been painted with glowing colours. 
Chromolithe installations have been made for cathedrals and churches, historic public buildings, modern art museums, and even banks.

The chromolithe process starts with data collection, using a specially-built photographic chamber, months of meticulous art work on computer screens, and finally re-projecting the image, printed to 24x24 cm photographic plates, back onto the building from a series of custom-built 6000Kva [[Xenon]] projectors, discreetly placed, so as to make the light source appear invisible. 

Some of the cathedrals and intricate sculptured Gothic buildings that have been chromolithed, were originally painted. Thus, work like that of [[Patrice Warrener]]'s can be seen as a restoration of heritage buildings.

[[File:Marriage scarab of Amenhotep III.jpg|250px|thumb|Marriage scarab (Vienna)]]
[[File:Lion hunt scarab of Amenhotep III.jpg|250px|thumb|Lion hunt scarab (Vienna)]]

During the reign of the [[ancient Egypt]]ian pharaoh [[Amenhotep III]] hundreds of so-called memorial [[Scarab artifact|scarab]]s were issued to commemorate the deeds of the pharaoh. Such scarabs were found in several archaeological sites of the Near East, from [[Syria]] to [[Sudan]]. Over two hundred of them are known to exist in museums and collections around the world.

Most of the scarabs are made of [[steatite]] painted blue or green. Their length varies between 4.7 and 11&amp;nbsp;cm, their width between 7 and 8.9&amp;nbsp;cm. Most of them are pierced for threading. On the basis of their inscriptions the scarabs can be divided into five groups (in parentheses the number of scarabs of the type found on several sites):

# "lion hunt scarabs" (123)
# "marriage scarabs" (56)
# "lake scarabs" (11)
# "bull hunt scarabs" (5)
# "Gilukhepa scarabs" (5)

The scarabs are likely to have been made at the same time, in or after the 11th regnal year. The scarab beetle was a symbol of the sun god [[Khepri]], and glazed materials were called ''tjehenet'' ('shining') in Egyptian, so the shining scarabs refer to the king, the dazzling Sun himself.

==Groups==
;Lion hunt
{{main|The lion hunts of Amenhotep III during the first ten years of his reign}}

The lion hunt scarabs emphasise the pharaoh's strength and bravery by recording that Amenhotep killed over a hundred lions (102; 110 on some scarabs) during the first ten years of his reign. These have the shortest inscription (7 lines), their average length is 7,7&amp;nbsp;cm. The lion hunt scarabs vary the most in size; the smallest scarab is 4,7&amp;nbsp;cm long, the largest is more than twice its size with a length of 9,5&amp;nbsp;cm.

;Marriage

The so-called marriage scarabs actually refer not to the marriage itself, and neither do they mention a marriage date. They record the name of Amenhotep's chief queen [[Tiye]] (following that of her husband), along with the names of her parents, as if to explicitly state her non-royal birth: ''the name of her father is [[Yuya]], the name of her mother is [[Thuya]]; she is married to the great king whose southern border is at Karoy and whose northern is Naharin.'' Tiye's importance is shown by defining the boundaries of the empire in terms of her. The length of the inscription on these scarabs is 9-10 lines, the scarabs' average length is 8,5&amp;nbsp;cm.

;Lake

The lake scarabs commemorate the construction of an artificial lake for Queen Tiye in the 11th regnal year. On these, the name and titles of the pharaoh are followed by those of Tiye, the names of her parents, then the description of the lake that was dug in Tiye's town Djaruha. The lake was 3700&amp;times;700 cubits large, and the royal couple was rowed on the lake in the royal barge ''Aten-tjehen.'' The name of the boat means 'Shining Sun-disc', this is the first appearance of this name which later becomes an epithet of the king himself. The lake scarabs vary the most in their texts, but the differences don't affect the meaning of the text itself. The text is 11 lines long, the average length of these scarabs is 8,4&amp;nbsp;cm.

;Bull hunt

The bull hunt scarabs record that in the 2nd regnal year Amenhotep, followed by his soldiers and officials, went to Shetep (possibly the area of Wadi el-Natrun) on his barge Khaemmaat ('Appears in Truth'), charged at wild bulls by his chariot and killed them. On the first day he slayed 56 bulls, four days later he killed 40 of them. The bulls had been previously surrounded with a ditch.

Hunt was not only a favourite pastime for the pharaohs, it also symbolized the ruler's strength and his victory over the forces of chaos, thus it equalled victory on a battlefield. These scarabs also list the titles of the king and mention Tiye.

The bull hunt scarabs have both the greatest length (9,9&amp;nbsp;cm) and the longest text. The only scarab which doesn't have its back carved in the shape of a beetle is among these scarabs. This one has two longitudinal holes for suspension.

;Gilukhepa

The [[Gilukhepa]] scarabs commemorate the arrival of Princess Gilukhepa, daughter of [[Shuttarna II]] of [[Mitanni]] into the pharaoh's harem in the 10th regnal year. She had a retinue of 317 ladies-in-waiting. Tiye is also mentioned on the scarab. The length of the text is 10 lines, the average length of these scarabs is 7,2&amp;nbsp;cm.

==Inscription of a scarab==

'''Concept testing''' (to be distinguished from '''pre-test markets''' and '''test markets''' which may be used at a later stage of product development research)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wind|first1=Yoram|title=NEW-PRODUCT FORECASTING MODELS AND APPLICATIONS|date=1984|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-0-669-04102-6|ref=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the process of using surveys (and sometimes [[qualitative marketing research|qualitative methods]]) to evaluate consumer acceptance of a new product idea prior to the introduction of a product to the [[Market (economics)|market]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schwartz|first1=David|title=Concept Testing: How to Test New Product Ideas Before You Go to Market|date=1987|publisher=American Management Association|isbn=978-0814459058|edition=1st|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is '''important not to confuse''' concept testing with advertising testing, brand testing and packaging testing; as is sometimes done. Concept testing focuses on the basic product idea, without the embellishments and puffery inherent in advertising.

It is important that the instruments (questionnaires) to test the product have a high quality themselves. Otherwise, results from data gathered surveys may be biased by measurement error. That makes the design of the testing procedure more complex. Empirical tests provide insight into the quality of the questionnaire. This can be done by:
* conducting [[cognitive pretesting|cognitive interviewing]]. By asking a faction of potential-respondents about their interpretation of the questions and use of the questionnaire, a researcher can verify the viability of the cognitive interviewing.
* carrying out a small pretest of the questionnaire, using a small subset of target respondents. Results can inform a researcher of errors such as missing questions, or logical and procedural errors.
* estimating the measurement quality of the questions. This can be done for instance using test-retest,&lt;ref&gt;Lord, F. and Novick, M. R.(1968). Statistical theories of mental test scores. Addison – Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt; quasi-simplex,&lt;ref&gt;Heise, D. R.(1969). Separating reliability and stability in test-retest correlation. American Sociological Review, 34, 93-101.&lt;/ref&gt; or mutlitrait-multimethod models.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, F. M. (1984). Construct validity and error components of survey measures: a structural modelling approach. Public Opinion Quarterly, 48, 409-442.&lt;/ref&gt;
* predicting the measurement quality of the question. This can be done using the software Survey Quality Predictor (SQP).&lt;ref&gt;Saris, W. E. and Gallhofer, I. N. (2014). Design, evaluation and analysis of questionnaires for survey research. Second Edition. Hoboken, Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concept testing in the new product development (NPD) process is the concept generation stage. The concept generation stage of concept testing can take on many forms. Sometimes concepts are generated incidentally, as the result of technological advances. At other times concept generation is deliberate: examples include brain-storming sessions, problem detection surveys and qualitative research. While qualitative research can provide insights into the range of reactions consumers may have, it cannot provide an indication of the likely success of the new concept; this is better left to quantitative concept-test surveys.

In the early stages of concept testing, a large field of alternative concepts might exist, requiring concept-screening surveys. Concept-screening surveys provide a quick means to narrow the field of options; however they provide little depth of insight and cannot be compared to a normative database due to interactions between concepts. For greater insight and to reach decisions on whether or not pursue further product development, monadic concept-testing surveys must be conducted.

Frequently concept testing surveys are described as either monadic, sequential monadic or comparative. The terms mainly refer to how the concepts are displayed:

1.) Monadic. The concept is evaluated in isolation.
2.) Sequential monadic. Multiple concepts are evaluated in sequence (often randomized order).
3.) Comparative. Concepts are shown next to each other. 
4.) Proto-monadic. Concepts are first shown in sequence, and then next to each other.

"Monadic testing is the recommended method for most concept testing. Interaction effects and biases are avoided. Results from one test can be compared to results from previous monadic tests. A normative database can be constructed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thomas|first1=Jerry|title=Concept Testing (And The "Uniqueness" Paradox)|url=https://www.decisionanalyst.com/whitepapers/concepttesting/|website=Decision Analyst|publisher=Decision Analyst|accessdate=21 April 2017|ref=2|date=2016-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, each has its specific uses and it depends on the research objectives. The decision as to which method to use is best left to experience research professionals to decide, as there are numerous implications in terms of how the results are interpreted.

==Evaluating concept-test scores==

Traditionally concept-test survey results are compared to 'norms databases'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thomas|first1=Jerry|title=Concept Testing (And The "Uniqueness" Paradox)|url=https://www.decisionanalyst.com/whitepapers/concepttesting/|website=Decision Analyst|publisher=Decision Analyst|accessdate=21 April 2017|ref=2|date=2016-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are databases of previous new-product concept tests. These must be 'monadic' concept tests, to prevent interaction effects. To be fair, it is important that these databases contain 'new' concept test results, not ratings of old products that consumers are already familiar with; since once consumers become familiar with a product the ratings often drop. Comparing new concept ratings to the ratings for an existing product already on the market would result in an invalid comparison, unless special precautions are taken by researchers to reduce or adjust for this effect quantitatively. Additionally, the concept is usually only compared to norms from the same product category, and the same country.

Companies that specialize in this area, tend to have developed their own unique systems, each with its own standards. Keeping to these standards consistently is important to preventing contamination of the results.

Perhaps one of the famous concept-test systems is the Nielsen Bases system, which comes in different versions. Other well-known products include Decision Analyst's 'Concept Check', Acupoll's 'Concept Optimizer', Ipsos Innoquest and GFK. Examples of smaller players include Skuuber and Acentric Express Test.

==Determining the importance of concept attributes as purchase drivers==

The simplest approach to determining attribute importance is to ask direct open-ended questions. Alternatively checklists or ratings of the importance of each product attribute may be used.

However, various debates have existed over whether or not consumers could be trusted to directly indicate the level of importance of each product attribute. As a result, correlation analysis and various forms of multiple regression have often been used for identifying importance - as an alternative to direct questions.

A complementary technique to concept testing, is conjoint analysis (also referred to as discrete choice modelling). Various forms of conjoint analysis and discrete choice modelling exist. While academics stress the differences between the two, in practice there is often little difference. 
These techniques estimate the importance of product attributes indirectly, by creating alternative products according to an experimental design, and then using consumer responses to these alternatives (usually ratings of purchase likelihood or choices made between alternatives) to estimate importance. The results are often expressed in the form of a 'simulator' tool which allows clients to test alternative product configurations and pricing.

'''Volumetric concept testing'''

Volumetric concept testing falls somewhere between traditional concept testing and pre-test market models (simulated test market models are similar but emphasize greater realism) in terms of the level of complexity. The aim is to provide 'approximate' sales volume forecasts for the new concept prior to launch. They incorporate other variables beyond just input from the concept test survey itself, such as the distribution strategy.

Examples of volumetric forecasting methodologies include 'Acupoll Foresight'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ForeSIGHT™ Going-Year Volume Estimates|url=http://www.acupoll.com/volume-forecasts|website=Acupoll|accessdate=21 April 2017|ref=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Decision Analyst's 'Conceptor'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conceptor® Volumetric Forecasting|url=https://www.decisionanalyst.com/analytics/volumetric/|website=Decision Analyst|accessdate=21 April 2017|ref=3|date=2015-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some models (more properly referred to as 'pre-test market models' or 'simulated test markets')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wind|first1=Yoram|title=NEW-PRODUCT FORECASTING MODELS AND APPLICATIONS|date=1984|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-0-669-04102-6|ref=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; gather additional data from a follow-up product testing survey (especially in the case of consumer packaged goods as repeat purchase rates need to be estimated). They may also include advertisement testing component that aims to assess advertising quality. Some such as Decision Analyst, include discrete choice models / conjoint analysis.

[[File:Brush for the lead2.jpg|right|thumb|''A Brush for the Lead'', [[lithograph]] by Currier and Ives, 1867.]]

'''Currier and Ives''' was a successful American [[printmaking]] firm based in New York City from 1835 to 1907  headed first by [[Nathaniel Currier]], and later jointly with his partner [[James Merritt Ives]]. The prolific firm produced prints from paintings by fine artists as black and white [[lithography|lithographs]] that were hand colored. Lithographic prints could be reproduced quickly and purchased inexpensively, and the firm called itself "the Grand Central Depot for Cheap and Popular Prints" and advertised its lithographs as "colored engravings for the people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hfmgv.org/exhibits/collections/Collections/library/special/prints/currier.asp |title=The Henry Ford Collections |publisher=Hfmgv.org |date=2002-12-18 |accessdate=2013-11-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512005153/http://www.hfmgv.org/exhibits/collections/Collections/library/special/prints/currier.asp |archivedate=May 12, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm adopted the name "Currier and Ives" in 1857.

==Currier's early history==
Nathaniel Currier (1813–88) was born in [[Roxbury, Massachusetts]] on March 27, 1813, the second of four children. His parents Nathaniel and Hannah Currier were distant cousins who lived a humble and spartan life. Tragedy struck when Nathaniel was eight years old, when his father unexpectedly died, leaving Nathaniel and his eleven-year-old brother Lorenzo to provide for the family: six-year-old sister Elizabeth and two-year-old brother Charles, as well as their mother.

Nathaniel worked a series of odd jobs to support the family and, at fifteen, he started what became a lifelong career when he apprenticed in the Boston lithography shop of William and John Pendleton.&lt;ref name="Currier"&gt;The Currier and Ives Foundation, "[http://www.currierandives.com The history of Currier &amp; Ives]"&lt;/ref&gt; In 1833 at age twenty, he moved to Philadelphia to do contract work for M.E.D. Brown, a noted engraver and printer.&lt;ref name="Brooke"&gt;Bob Brooke, "[http://www.howmuchisitworth.com/currier-and-ives.html The Enduring Appeal of Currier and Ives Prints]"&lt;/ref&gt; Currier's early lithographs were issued under the name of Stodart &amp; Currier, a result of the partnership that he created in 1834 with a local New York printmaker named Stodart. The two men specialized in "job" printing and made a variety of print products, including music manuscripts. Currier became dissatisfied with the poor economic return of their business venture and ended the partnership in 1835. He set up shop alone, working as "N. Currier, Lithographer" until 1856.

In 1835, he created a lithograph that illustrated a fire sweeping through New York City's business district. The print of the Merchant's Exchange sold thousands of copies in four days. Currier realized that there was a market for current news, so he turned out several more disaster prints and other inexpensive lithographs that illustrated local and national events, such as "''Ruins of the Planter's Hotel, New Orleans, which fell at two O’clock on the Morning of May 15, 1835, burying 50 persons, 40 of whom Escaped with their Lives''{{-"}}.&lt;ref name="Brooke"/&gt; He quickly gained a reputation as an accomplished lithographer.&lt;ref name="6aa162"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/6aa/6aa162.htm |title=Currier and Ives: An American Panorama |publisher=Tfaoi.com |accessdate=2013-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1840, he produced "Awful Conflagration of the [[Steamship Lexington|Steam Boat ''Lexington'']]", which was so successful that he was given a weekly insert in the ''[[The New York Sun (historical)|New York Sun]]''. In this year, Currier's firm began to shift its focus from job printing to independent print publishing.&lt;ref name="Answers"&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/currier-and-ives Biography] at answers.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Currier &amp; Ives first appeared in 1857, when Currier invited the company's bookkeeper and accountant James Merritt Ives (1824–95) to become his partner. Ives was born on March 5, 1824 in New York City, and he married Caroline Clark in 1852. She was the sister-in-law of Nathaniel's brother Charles Currier, and it was Charles who recommended Ives to his brother. Nathaniel Currier soon noticed Ives's dedication to his business, and his artistic knowledge and insight into what the public wanted. The younger man quickly became the general manager of the firm, handling the financial side of the business by modernizing the bookkeeping, reorganizing inventory, and streamlining the print process.&lt;ref name="Answers"/&gt; Ives also helped Currier interview potential artists and craftsmen. He had a flair for gauging popular interests and aided in selecting the images that the firm would publish and expanding the firm's range to include political satire and sentimental scenes, such as sleigh rides in the country and steamboat races. In 1857, Currier made Ives a full partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldprintshop.com/artists/currier-ives-j_m_ives.htm |title=The Old Print Shop |publisher=The Old Print Shop |accessdate=2013-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica Online "[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1345799/Currier-Ives Currier and Ives]"&lt;/ref&gt;

==The firm==
The firm Currier and Ives described itself as "Publishers of Cheap and Popular Prints". At least 7,500 lithographs were published in the firm's 72 years of operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohio.edu/news/99-00/328.html |title=Ohio University News and Information |publisher=Ohio.edu |accessdate=2013-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists produced two to three new images every week for 64 years (1834–1895),&lt;ref name="tfaoi.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/4aa/4aa436.htm |title=tfaoi.com |publisher=tfaoi.com |date=2004-04-21 |accessdate=2013-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; producing more than a million prints by hand-colored [[lithography]]. For the original drawings, Currier &amp; Ives employed or used the work of many celebrated artists of the day including [[James E. Buttersworth]], [[Charles R. Parsons]], [[George Inness]], [[Thomas Nast]], [[C.H. Moore]], and [[Eastman Johnson]].&lt;ref name="tfaoi.com"/&gt; The stars of the firm were [[Arthur Fitzwilliam Tait]], who specialized in sporting scenes; [[Louis Maurer]], who executed genre scenes; [[George Henry Durrie|George H. Durrie]], who supplied winter scenes; and [[Frances Flora Bond Palmer]], who liked to do picturesque panoramas of the American landscape, and who was the first woman in the United States to make her living as a full-time artist.&lt;ref name="Answers"/&gt;

All lithographs were produced on [[lithographic limestone]] printing plates on which the drawing was done by hand. A stone often took over a week to prepare for printing. Each print was pulled by hand. Prints were hand-colored by a dozen or more women, often immigrants from Germany with an art background. They worked in assembly-line fashion, one color to a worker, and who were paid $6 for every 100 colored prints. The favored colors were clear and simple, and the drawing was bold and direct.&lt;ref name="Brooke"/&gt;&lt;ref name="2aa36"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/2aa/2aa36.htm |title=The Long Island Museum of American History and Carriages |publisher=Tfaoi.com |accessdate=2013-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest lithographs were printed in black and then colored by hand. As new techniques were developed, publishers began to produce full-color lithographs that gradually developed softer, more painterly effects. Skilled artist lithographers such as John Cameron, Fanny Palmer, and others became known for their work and signed important pieces. Artists such as A. F. Tait became famous when their paintings were reproduced as lithographs.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/07/nyregion/currier-ives-popular-masters-of-19th-century-lithography.html Currier and Ives: Popular Masters of 19th&lt;!-- immutable title --&gt; Century Lithography]"&lt;/ref&gt;

Currier and Ives was the most prolific and successful company of lithographers in the U.S. Its lithographs represented every phase of American life, and included the themes of hunting, fishing, whaling, city life, rural scenes, historical scenes, [[clipper ship]]s, [[yacht]]s, [[steamship]]s, the [[Mississippi River]], [[Hudson River]] scenes, railroads, politics, comedy, gold mining, winter scenes, commentary on life, portraits, and still lifes.&lt;ref name="2aa36"/&gt; From 1866 on,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philaprintshop.com/currhist.html |title=philaprintshop.com |publisher=philaprintshop.com |accessdate=2013-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; the firm occupied three floors in a building at 33 Spruce Street in New York:

*Hand-operated printing presses occupied the third floor.
*Artists, stone grinders, and lithographers worked on the fourth floor.
*Colorists worked on the fifth floor.

Small works sold for five to twenty cents each, and large works sold for $1 to $3 apiece. The Currier and Ives firm branched out from its central shop in New York City to sell prints via pushcart vendors, peddlers, and book stores. The firm sold retail as well as wholesale, establishing outlets in cities across the country and in London. It also sold work through the mail (prepaid orders only), and internationally through a London office and agents in Europe.&lt;ref name="tfaoi.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EB"/&gt;

The 19th-century Victorian public was receptive to the firm's products, with its interest in current events and sentimental taste. Currier and Ives prints were among the most popular wall hangings of the day.&lt;ref name="2aa36"/&gt; In 1872, the Currier and Ives catalog proudly proclaimed: "our Prints have become a staple article... in great demand in every part of the country... In fact without exception, all that we have published have met with a quick and ready sale."&lt;ref name="Brooke"/&gt;

Currier &amp; Ives prints were among the household decorations considered appropriate for a proper home by [[Catharine Esther Beecher]] and [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]], authors of ''American Woman's Home'' (1869): "The great value of pictures for the home would be, after all, in their sentiment. They should express the sincere ideas and tastes of the household and not the tyrannical dicta of some art critic or neighbor."&lt;ref name="6aa162"/&gt;

Currier died in 1888. Ives remained active in the firm until his death in 1895. Both Currier's and Ives's sons followed their fathers in the business, which was eventually [[liquidation|liquidated]] in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url= http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-CurrierN.html|title= Currier &amp; Ives|work=The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. 2008|accessdate= August 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public demand for lithographs had gradually diminished because of improvements in [[offset printing]] and [[photoengraving]].

==The lithographs==
[[File:The American Fireman by Louis Maurer 1858.jpg|thumb|''The American Fireman'', lithograph by [[Louis Maurer]] for Currier and Ives, 1858.]]
[[File:Charles R. Parsons, "Central-Park, Winter- The Skating Pond".jpg|thumb|''Central-Park Winter. The skating pond'', lithograph by Currier and Ives, 1862.]]

The prints depicted a variety of images of American life, including winter scenes, [[Horse racing|horse-racing]] images, [[portrait]]s of people, and pictures of ships, sporting events, patriotic, and historical events, including ferocious battles of the [[American Civil War]], the building of cities and railroads, and Lincoln's assassination.

The original lithographs shared similar characteristics in inking and paper, and adhered to folio sizes. Sizes of the images were standard (trade cards, very small folios, small folios, medium folios, large folios), and their measurement did not include the title or borders. These sizes are one of the guides for collectors today in determining if the print is an original or not. "Currier used a cotton based, medium to heavy weight paper depending on the folio size for his prints until the late 1860s. From about 1870, Currier &amp; Ives used paper mixed with a small amount of wood pulp." In addition, Currier's inking process resembled a mixture of elongated splotches and dashes of ink with a few spots, a characteristic that modern reproductions would not possess.&lt;ref name="currierprints.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.currierprints.com/Reproductions.htm |title=Currier and Ives Lithographic Value Guides |publisher=Currierprints.com |accessdate=2013-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1907, the firm was liquidated and most of the lithographic stones had the image removed and were sold by the pound, with some stones' final home being as land fill in Central Park. Those few stones that managed to survive intact were of large folio Clipper Ships, small folio Dark Town Comics, a medium folio "Abraham Lincoln" and a small folio "Washington As A Mason".&lt;ref name="currierprints.com"/&gt;

They also made a statue of liberty lithograph that had been remade to cause a lot of uproar. Thomas Worth recreated their image using an African American woman similar to the mammy figure holding a torch.  

Today, original Currier and Ives prints are much sought by collectors, and modern reproductions of them are popular decorations. Especially popular are the winter scenes, which are commonly used for American [[Christmas card]]s.

A '''dedication''' is the expression of friendly connection or thanks by the author towards another person. The dedication has its own place on the ''dedication page'' and is part of the [[Book design#Front matter|front matter]].

==Position and function  of the dedication==
In newer books, the dedication is located on a ''dedication page'' on its own, usually on the [[Recto and verso|recto page]] after the [[Title page|main title page]] inside the [[front matter]]. It can occupy one or multiple lines depending on its importance. It can also be "in a longer version as a dedication letter or dedication preface at the book's beginning".&lt;ref&gt;Ursula Rautenberger (ed.): ''Reclams Sachlexikon des Buches'', p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, the dedication's function is mainly part of the self-portrayal of the author in front of his or her readers.

==History==
[[Image:Orfeo libretto dédicace.jpg|thumb|left|The dedication of ''Orfeo'' by [[Claudio Monteverdi|Monteverdi]], 1609]]
Evidence of dedications is provided back into the [[Classical antiquity]]. Besides the wish to express their gratitude towards a certain person, the authors often had also other reasons to dedicate their work to a particular person. Well into the 18th century, it was not usual for [[publisher]]s to remunerate the authors; authors tended to be paid or remunerated as one element of a [[patron-client relationship]], in which the author-client paid tribute, in the dedication, to his or her patron.  A typical writer dedicated "their book to a high standing personality -- to [[Fürst]]s or [[bishop]]s -- or to a city and tried to gain some money through this practice".&lt;ref name="Hiller2002"&gt;Citation after Helmut Hiller, Stephan Füssel: ''Wörterbuch des Buches''. 6. Auflage. Vittorio Klostermann, Frankfurt am Main, 2002. {{ISBN|3-465-032209}}, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases the petitioner was lucky and received a gift from the patron. In some cases, the writer groveled before the patron and a formal dedication "contained often a very elaborate and submissive affection".&lt;ref name="Hiller2002" /&gt; In some cases not only the authors tried to get some money, but also the printers tried through dedications to cover a part of their costs.

==Themes==
A book dedication can provide a fascinating glimpse into the life and times of the author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barnes|first1=Patricia|title=Tender, Tawdry &amp; Timeless Book Dedications|date=2015|isbn=0989870839|asin=B00VZ2YRM4}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Lord Byron]] (1788–1824) engaged in a famous feud with [[Robert Southey]], who was then England's [[Poet Laureate]]. Byron wrote a mocking 17-verse dedication to his epic poem ''[[Don Juan (Byron)|Don Juan]]'' in which he savagely pilloried Southey as a dull, reactionary "warbler" who had abandoned his political principles for favor and financial reward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barnes|first1=|title=Tender, Tawdry &amp; Timeless Book Dedications|date=2015|isbn=|pages=281–288|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout time, book dedications were used to make political statements or to condemn war and inequality. Author [[Toni Morrison]] dedicated ''[[Beloved (novel)|Beloved]]'', her 1987 [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning novel about a fugitive slave who killed her daughter, to "Sixty Million and more."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barnes|first1=|title=Tender, Tawdry &amp; Timeless Book Dedications|date=2015|isbn=|pages=173|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, book dedications reflect the tastes and mores of society. Whereas many Elizabethan dedications were erudite and witty, some modern authors have abandoned literary pretense, sometimes using profanity to shock or amuse their audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barnes|first1=|title=Tender, Tawdry &amp; Timeless Book Dedications |date=2015|isbn=|pages=13|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Handwritten dedication==

The dedication is not to be confounded with the handwritten dedication of a single copy: the [[presentation copy]].

{{Defn|1={{crossref|selfref=no|See {{gli|level}}.}}}}

{{Term|Area of effect|content=area of effect (AoE)}}
{{Defn|
[[File:Freedroid RPG.jpg|thumb|150px|Screenshot from ''FreedroidRPG'' showing area of effect.]]
A term used in many {{gli|role-playing video game|role-playing}} and [[strategy game|strategy]] games to describe attacks or other effects that affect multiple targets within a specified area. For example, in the role-playing game, ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'', a fireball {{gli|magic|spell}} will deal damage to anyone within a certain radius of where it strikes. In most tactical strategy games [[artillery]] weapons have an area of effect that will damage anyone within a radius of the strike zone.
&lt;p&gt;Area of effect can also refer to spells and abilities that are non-damaging. For example, a powerful healing spell may affect anyone within a certain range of the caster (often only if they are a member of the caster's {{gli|party}}). Some games also have what are referred to as "aura" abilities that will affect anyone in the area around the person with the ability. For example, many strategy games have hero or officer units that can improve the morale and combat performance of friendly units around them. The inclusion of AoE elements in game mechanics can increase the role of strategy, especially in {{gli|turn-based game}}s. The player has to place units wisely to mitigate the possibly devastating effects of a hostile area of effect attack; however, placing units in a dense formation could result in gains that outweigh the increased AoE damage received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Point-blank area of effect (PBAoE) is a less-used term for when the affected region is centered on the character performing the ability, rather than at a location of the player's choosing.&lt;/p&gt;}}

&lt;dt&gt;ARPG&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;!--anchored at action role-playing game--&gt;
{{Defn|1={{crossref|selfref=no|See {{gli|action role-playing game}}.}}}}

{{Term|Artificial intelligence|content=[[artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]] (AI)}}
{{Defn|Algorithms used to generate responsive, adaptive or intelligent game behavior, primarily in {{gli|non-player characters}}.}}  Synonymous with, though distinct from, the computing science concept of 'artificial intelligence'.

{{Term|Assault mode|content=assault mode}}{{Defn|A game mode in which one team tries to attack (or capture) specific areas and the other team tries to defend those points.}}

{{Term|Asset flipping|content=asset flipping}}
{{Defn|The practice of creating a game using 'free' art and audio assets, either from an online marketplace or the default stock of assets included with many [[game engines]]. Asset-flips are often of very poor quality designed to catch onto a currently popular theme or game to turn a quick profit. It mimics the practice of [[flipping]] in real estate markets.}}

{{Term|Asymmetric gameplay|content=asymmetric gameplay}}
{{Defn|Cooperative or competitive multiplayer games in which each player will have a different experience arising from differences in gameplay, controls, or in-game character options that are part of the game. This is in contrast to symmetric gameplay where each player will have the same experience, such as in the game ''[[Pong]]''. Asymmetric gameplay often arises in competitive games where one player's character is far overpowered but outnumbered from other players that are all competing against them, such as in ''[[Pac-Man Vs.]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/features/what-the-hell-is-asymmetric-gameplay|title=What the Hell is Asymmetric Gameplay?|work=[[1UP.com]]|first=Jeremy|last=Parish|date=August 28, 2012|accessdate=February 29, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161128000550/http://www.1up.com/features/what-the-hell-is-asymmetric-gameplay|archivedate=November 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Term|Asynchronous gameplay|content=asynchronous gameplay}}
{{Defn|Competitive multiplayer games where the players do not have to be participating at the same time. Such games are usually turn-based, with each player planning a strategy for the upcoming turn, and then having the game resolve all actions of that turn once each player has submitted their strategies.}}

&lt;p&gt;Originally built into {{gli|arcade game}}s, the main purpose of the attract mode is to entice passers-by to play the game.&lt;ref name="Ruggill"/&gt; It usually displays the game's [[title screen]], the game's story (if it has one), its [[high score]] list, [[sweepstakes]] (on some games) and the message "[[Game Over]]" or "Insert Coin" over or in addition to a computer-controlled demonstration of {{gli|gameplay}}. In [[Atari]] home video games of the 1970s and 1980s, the term ''attract mode'' was sometimes used to denote a simple [[screensaver]] that slowly cycled the display colors to prevent [[phosphor burn-in]] while the game was not being played. Attract modes demonstrating gameplay are common in current home video games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attract mode is not only found in arcade games, but in most coin-operated games like [[pinball machines]], [[Stacker (game)|stacker machines]] and other games. [[Cocktail arcade cabinet|Cocktail arcade]] machines on which the screen flips its orientation for each player's turn in two-player games traditionally have the screen's orientation in player 1's favour for the attract mode.&lt;/p&gt;}}

{{Term|Augmented reality|content=[[Augmented reality]]{{anchor|augmented reality|AR}}}}
{{Defn|Augmented Reality (AR) is an interactive experience of a real-world environment whereby the objects that reside in the real-world are "augmented" by computer-generated perceptual information, sometimes across multiple sensory modalities, including visual, auditory, haptic, somatosensory, and olfactory. The overlaid sensory information can be constructive (i.e. additive to the natural environment) or destructive (i.e. masking of the natural environment) and is seamlessly interwoven with the physical world such that it is perceived as an immersive aspect of the real environment. In this way, augmented reality alters one’s ongoing perception of a real world environment, whereas virtual reality completely replaces the user's real world environment with a simulated one. Augmented reality is related to two largely synonymous terms: mixed reality and computer-mediated reality.}}

{{Defn|Casual gaming is a term used for a form of playing video games where a gamer does not have a long-term commitment to a game and can approach playing the game on an infrequent and spontaneous basis. Casual video games have several distinguishing features. They are often web-based and are usually found on either mobile phones or personal computers. They usually do not have a high learning curve. To achieve this, most casual games have few controls--normally a single button or two that will predominantly control the majority of the game. Casual games usually do not require a significant amount of time to play. They can normally be played in small periods of time. Unlike more "hardcore" games, casual games usually do not require a long time to reach the final stage of the game. Therefore, a casual game often does not contain a save feature.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/c/casual-gaming.htm|title=What is Casual Gaming?|author=|date=|website=computerhope.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Defn|The minimum length of time that the player needs to wait after using an [[Skill (role-playing games)|ability]] before they can use it again. This concept was first introduced by the text {{gli|MUD}} ''[[Avalon (MUD)|Avalon: The Legend Lives]]''.
&lt;p&gt;An analogy can be made to the [[Handloading|reload]] time and [[firing rate]] of weapons. For example, a [[machine gun]] has very fast firing rate, so it has a very low cooldown between shots. Comparatively, a [[shotgun]] has a long cooldown between shots. Cooldown can be used to {{gli|balance}} a weapon such as a [[Gun turret|turret-mounted]] machine gun having infinite ammunition, since it can only sustain continuous fire until reaching a threshold at which the weapon would have to cool down (hence the term) before it could be fired again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In design terms, cooldown can be thought of as an inverted 'casting time' where instead of requiring a wait time before using an ability, cooldown may replace casting time and put the wait after the ability is activated. This creates a new dimension to the balancing act of casting speed versus power: "lower cooldown, faster cast, but weaker strength" versus "higher cooldown, slower cast, but greater strength". This mechanic is integral to such games as ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', where cooldown management is key to higher-level play and various abilities deal with cooldown (for example, cooldown reduction or immediately finishing cooldown on certain abilities). From the technical point of view, cooldown can also be used to assert control over frequency of cast in order to maintain a fluid {{gli|frame rate}} and ping. For example, in the game ''[[Diablo II]]'', cooldown was added in the form of a patch to several graphically and CPU-intensive spells to solve the problem of extreme {{gli|lag}} caused by players spamming (ie: repeatedly casting at {{gli|maxed out}} cast rates) these spells in multiplayer games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moves and attacks in fighting games (like those from the ''[[Street Fighter]]'' series) are measured in animation frames (which may be 1/20th to 1/60th of a second per frame). Each move has a certain number of frames in which it is considered to be "recovering" before another move can be executed, which is similar to cooldown in concept. However, there is no player control over the character during recovery frames, and the character can not perform any movement or attacks until fully recovered. Because the character is vulnerable during recovery, strategic use of skills is necessary to make sure the opponent cannot immediately counter the player-character.&lt;/p&gt;}}

{{Term|Rage quit|content=rage quit{{Anchor|Rage quit}}}}
{{Defn|Rage quitting is the act of quitting a game mid-progress instead of waiting for the game to end. Typically, this is associated with leaving in frustration, such as unpleasant communication with other players, being annoyed, or losing the game. However, the reasons can vary beyond frustration, such as being unable to play due to the way the game has progressed, bad sportsmanship, manipulating game statistics, or having network connection problems. There are also social implications of rage quitting, such as making other players rage quit. Certain games can penalize the player for leaving early.&lt;ref name="Kotaku"&gt;Patricia Hernandez, 6/03/13, Why People Rage Quit Games, [https://kotaku.com/to-rage-quit-or-not-to-rage-quit-that-is-the-question-511072565], Kotaku&lt;/ref&gt; Rage quitting is considered improper and rude, but can also be considered amusing by others when they are not negatively impacted by it themselves. {{crossref|selfref=no|Contrast with {{gli|drop-in, drop-out}}.}}}}

&lt;p&gt;A skill tree is called a "tree" because it uses a tiered system and typically branches out into multiple paths.

Skill trees are a common tool used for in-game {{gli|balance|balancing}} by game designers.

{{Term|Title screen|content=title screen{{Anchor|Title screen}}}}
{{Defn|
[[File:OpenArena 0.8.8 Title Screen.png|thumb|150px|right|''[[OpenArena]]'' title screen]]
The initial screen of a [[computer game|computer]], [[video game|video]], or [[arcade game]] after the credits and logos of the [[video game developer|game developer]] and [[video game publisher|publisher]] are displayed. Early title screens often included all the [[game option]]s available (single player, multiplayer, configuration of controls, etc.) while modern games have opted for the title screen to serve as a [[splash screen]]. This can be attributed to the use of the title screen as a [[loading screen]], in which to cache all the graphical elements of the main menu. Older computer and video games had relatively simple menu screens that often featured [[pre-rendered]] artwork.
&lt;p&gt;In arcade games, the title screen is shown as part of the {{gli|attract mode}} loop, usually after a game demonstration is played. The title screen and [[high score]] list urge potential players to [[insert coin]]s. In console games, especially if the screen is not merged with the main menu, it urges the player to press start. Similarly, in computer games, the message "Hit [[any key]]" is often displayed. Controls that lack an actual "Start" button use a different prompt; the [[Wii]], for example, usually prompts to press the "A" button and the "B" trigger simultaneously, as in ''[[Super Mario Galaxy 2]]'' or ''[[Mario Party 9]]''. [[fangame|Fan-made games]] often parody the style of the title that inspired them.&lt;/p&gt;}}

{{Term|Win quote|content=win quote{{Anchor|win quote}}}}
{{Defn|A phrase spoken by a [[versus fighting game|fighting game]] character after defeating an opponent. In older games, such as ''[[Fatal Fury: King of Fighters|Fatal Fury]]'' and traditionally in {{gli|2D graphics|2D}} fighting games such as ''[[SNK vs. Capcom (series)|Capcom vs. SNK]]'', it is not an actual voice sample but text superimposed on an image of the winning character, occasionally depicted alongside the visibly injured defeated character (''[[Street Fighter II]]'' for example). Win quotes are often little more than trash talk, but they help players to understand and identify with the characters.
&lt;p&gt;In most games, characters have one or more win quotes that they use indiscriminately, but sometimes special win quotes are used in special circumstances. For example, in ''[[The King of Fighters '94]]'', each character has special win quotes against each of the 8 teams; in ''[[Street Fighter Alpha]]'', players can choose one of four win quotes by holding certain button combinations after winning a battle; in ''[[Street Fighter III]]'': Giant Attack, characters sometime use special win quotes if they finish the battle with a certain move; and in ''SNK vs. Capcom: Match of the Millennium'', players can input their own win quotes in edit mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some win quotes have characters break the [[fourth wall]], such as [[Chun-Li]]'s ''[[Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter]]'' win quote in which she suspects the game is set on the easiest difficulty setting; or are [[in-joke]]s referring to other [[video game]]s, like [[Sakura Kasugano|Sakura]]'s ''Street Fighter Alpha 3'' win quote in which she says she prefers "street fighting to sparring in [[Rival Schools|rival schools]]."&lt;/p&gt;}}

Wrapping is also used to make a 2D game world round; for example, in ''[[PacMan]]'' exiting the game screen to the right wraps the player to the same position on the left side of the screen. Similarly, in ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'', exiting the game map to the right wraps the player to the same position on the left side of the map, and exiting the map to the top wraps the player to the bottom of the map.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5269">'''Grupo Santa Helena''', or '''Santa Helena Group''', was the name given by the critic [[Sérgio Milliet]] to the painters that met in the [[wikt:atelier|ateliers]] of [[Francisco Rebolo]] and [[Mario Zanini]] starting in the 1930s. The ateliers belonged to a [[Praça da Sé]] building named ''Palacete Santa Helena''. This building was demolished in 1971, when the [[List of São Paulo metro stations|Sé station]] of [[São Paulo Metro]] was built.

The Santa Helena Group was formed spontaneously, without any conceptual commitment. Most of its members were [[Italian Brazilian|Italian immigrants]], like [[Alfredo Volpi]] and [[Fulvio Pennacchi]]; sons of Italian immigrants, like [[Aldo Bonadei]], [[Alfredo Rizzotti]], Mario Zanini and [[Humberto Rosa (painter)|Humberto Rosa]]; some were [[Spanish people|Spanish immigrants]] like Francisco Rebolo; some [[Portuguese people|Portuguese immigrants]] like [[Manuel Martins (visual artist)|Manuel Martins]].

They all shared a humble origin, and worked as [[artisan]]s or [[proletariat|proletarian]]s. Rebolo, Volpi and Zanini were wall painters. [[Clóvis Graciano]] was a railroad worker. Fulvio Pennacchi was a butcher. Aldo Bonadei worked with [[costume design]] and [[embroidery]]. Rizzotti was an auto mechanic and a [[lathe]] worker. Manoel Martins was a [[goldsmith]]. Rebolo was a football player. Humberto Rosa and Pennacchi taught drawing. Painting was for the weekends or leisure time.

Most of them had courses in the ''[[Liceu de Artes e Ofícios de São Paulo|Liceu de Artes e Ofícios]]'' (or "Arts and Crafts Lyceum", that was one [[Liceo scientifico]]), or the ''Escola Profissional Masculina do Brás'' (or "Men's Professional School of Brás"). However, they reduced what they learned to drawing and painting techniques, not to the academic guiding of formal order, were they aware of that or not.

By this time, some painters associations were created in São Paulo, like the ''Sociedade Pró-Arte Moderna'' (or "Pro-Modern Art Society", aka SPAM) or ''Clube dos Artistas Modernos'' (CAM, or "Modern Artists Club"). They joined the participants of the ''[[Semana de Arte Moderna]]'' (or "Modern Art Week"). These groups were formed by intellectuals and members of the São Paulo elite, which kept a great distance from the Santa Helena members and other proletarian groups, about which they had little or no knowledge.

The group union, that lasted for years, can be explained as a reaction against the enormous prejudice that existed about the poor immigrants, that came not only from the pre-existent Brazilian elite families, but also from immigrants that became wealthy in Brazil. That prejudice was made clear in several criticisms that were directed to the Group's work, particularly when it started to cause a sensation, and to threaten positions already established.

Some Santa Helena artists had already studied art in Europe before arriving in Brazil; for instance Pennacchi, Rizzotti and Bonadei. All others had difficulty learning about the art created there, and could only be taught by teachers in Brazil. Bonadei was a student of [[Pedro Alexandrino]], [[Antonio Rocco (painter)|Antonio Rocco]] and [[Amadeo Scavone]]. Graciano was taught by [[Waldemar da Costa]], and Zanini was a [[Georg Elpons]] student.

The perseverance of the group, in its fight for survival, caused interest and attracted new friends and partners. So, in due time, the place became the meeting point of many other artists.

The Santa Helena Group's major achievement was to reveal some of the most important Brazilian visual artists of the 20th century.

==Exhibitions==

In 1937, an exhibition named ''[[Família Artística Paulista]]'', or "Artistic Family of S&amp;atilde;o Paulo" shown a set of artists, including the ''Grupo Santa Helena'', that could show their work publicly for the first time. From then on, the Grupo became known. They provoked the interest of [[Mário de Andrade]], that identified in them a "S&amp;atilde;o Paulo school of painting".

In 1940, the "Exhibition of French Painters", that presented [[Cézanne]], [[Picasso]], [[Braque]] and [[Juan Gris|Gris]], among others, caused an enormous impact and several components of the group started to redirect his work, what made them more distant of the Grupo's themes or in their formal aspects.

'''''Hadleigh Castle''''' is an oil painting by the English painter [[John Constable]].

John Constable visited [[Hadleigh Castle]] in 1814 and made a drawing of the castle. This he developed into a full-sized oil sketch in  preparation for a finished painting, executed  in 1829 and exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] in the same year. The sketch is currently displayed at the [[Tate Gallery]], [[London]], while the finished painting now hangs in the [[Yale Center for British Art]] at [[New Haven]], [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/research/tateresearch/tatepapers/06spring/duff.htm Constable's Sketch for Hadleigh Castle: A Technical Examination], Duff, Natasha, accessed 27 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Constable's painting, "one of his most monumental works" according to art historians Tammis Groft and Mary Mackay, shows Hadleigh Castle as a decaying man-made structure, succumbing to the elemental power of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Groft and Mackay, p.86.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Helen Lee''' ({{Lang-ko|헬렌 리}}; born circa 1965) is a [[Korean-Canadian]] film director. Born in [[Seoul]], South Korea, she emigrated to Canada at the age of four and grew up in [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]], [[Ontario]]. Interested in film at a young age, she took film studies at the [[University of Toronto]] and, later, [[New York University]]. While in university she was influenced by [[Gender studies|gender]] and minority theories, as reflected in her first film, the [[short film|short]] ''Sally's Beauty Spot'' (1990). While continuing her studies she produced two more films before taking a five-year hiatus to live in Korea beginning in 1995. After her return, she released another short film and her feature film debut, ''[[The Art of Woo]]'' (2001). She continues to produce short films, although at a reduced rate. Lee's films often deal with [[gender]] and racial issues, reflecting the state of East Asians in modern society; a common theme in her work is sexuality, with several films featuring [[Miscegenation|interracial relationships]].

==Early life==
Helen Lee was born in [[Seoul]], South Korea, around 1965, but came to Canada when she was four, a year after her parents.{{sfn|Lee, Biography}}{{sfn|Jew|1991|p=41}} She was raised in [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]], [[Ontario]], having moved there in the mid-1970s.{{sfn|Jew|1991|p=41}}{{sfn|Hoolboom|2008|p=26}} As a child, she became interested in black-and-white films from the [[Golden Age of Hollywood]].{{sfn|Hoolboom|2008|pp=22–23}} She later wrote that the 1960 film ''[[The World of Suzie Wong (film)|The World of Suzie Wong]]'' spoke to her racial identity as an Asian Canadian, an experience she found to have influenced her filmmaking;{{sfn|Shimizu|Lee|2004|p=1391}} excerpts from the film were included in her first short.{{sfn|Shimizu|Lee|2004|p=1399}}

Lee began her tertiary studies at the [[University of Western Ontario]], taking business, before transferring to the [[University of Toronto]];{{sfn|MacDonald 2001, Helen Lee}} there she majored in English literature and film studies.{{sfn|Lee, Biography}} By 1989 she was attending [[New York University]] (NYU), studying under [[Homi K. Bhabha]], [[Faye Ginsburg]], and Mick Taussig,{{sfn|Hoolboom|2008|pp=22–23}} with a scholarship.{{sfn|Lee, Biography}} During this period she was influenced by [[Trinh T. Minh-ha]]'s paradigms on women and ethnicity, as expressed in the 1989 book ''Woman, Native, Other: Writing Postcoloniality and Feminism''; these were later expressed in Lee's first film. She later described Minh-ha as at one point being her "ultimate role model".{{sfn|Shimizu|Lee|2004|p=1395}}

==Early film career==
Lee made ''Sally's Beauty Spot'', a 12-minute-long [[short film]] focusing on a [[melanocytic nevus|mole]] on her sister's right breast, for a film editing class at NYU in 1990. For the film she used a second-hand [[Bolex]] camera and edited it with a [[Steenbeck]] editing suite. She later recalled that she recorded the film while in her pyjamas.{{sfn|Hoolboom|2008|p=24}} The production cost a total of $4,000.{{sfn|Duran|1992|p=4}} Fellow Canadian filmmaker David Weaver described it as sexualizing Sally's body, something that Lee had not intended.{{sfn|Hoolboom|2008|p=24}} The film was first screened at the [[Toronto International Film Festival|Festival of Festivals]] in Toronto.{{sfn|MacDonald 2001, Helen Lee}} After graduation, Lee spent time as a curator at the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] before returning to Canada.{{sfn|MacDonald 2001, Helen Lee}}

In 1992 Lee made the forty-minute long film ''My Niagara'', which featured scenes shot in Japan that were reminiscent of [[home movies]]; the effect was obtained by filming in [[Super 8 mm film|Super 8]] [[Kodachrome]], then transferring it to [[16 mm film]]. Filmed in [[Etobicoke]], Ontario, at the childhood home of co-writer [[Kerri Sakamoto]], the film detailed a young Asian-Canadian woman  living alone with her father after the death of her mother. Scenes were also shot at the [[R. C. Harris Water Treatment Plant]] in [[Toronto]].{{sfn|Hoolboom|2008|pp=26–27}} Fransisca Duran in ''LIFT'' writes that the film, which had a budget of $80,000, had a theme of cultural displacement,{{sfn|Duran|1992|p=4}} and Lee states that ''My Niagara'' was well received.{{sfn|Duran|1992|p=6}} That year she also released the three-minute ''To Sir With Love''.{{sfn|Hoolboom|2008|p=34}}

After ''My Niagara'', Lee took a position as a director observer on the set of [[Atom Egoyan]]'s ''[[Exotica (film)|Exotica]]'', while led her to enrol with the [[Canadian Film Centre]] (CFC).{{sfn|MacDonald 2001, Helen Lee}} Meanwhile, she worked as a [[film critic|film]] and [[music critic]] for ''[[Now (newspaper)|Now]]'' and extensively wrote about films for other publications.{{sfn|Lee, Biography}}{{sfn|Duran|1992|p=3}} She took further studies at the [[Banff Centre for the Arts]] in [[Banff, Alberta]], before returning to the CFC as a director residency.{{sfn|MacDonald 2001, Helen Lee}} She continued to be involved with the American company [[Women Make Movies]], a distributor of feminist media, which she had become involved with while at NYU.{{sfn|Jew|1991|p=42}}

In 1995 Lee released the 26-minute-long ''Prey'', starring [[Adam Beach]] and [[Sandra Oh]];{{sfn|Hoolboom|2008|p=28}} she described the film as a "cross-cultural comedy".{{sfn|Shimizu|Lee|2004|p=1390}} The film, which followed a young Korean woman who falls in love with a drifter, was a collaboration with [[Cameron Bailey]] and dealt with themes of racial differences, immigration, and social class.{{sfn|Hoolboom|2008|p=28}} The Canadian film critic and experimental filmmaker [[Mike Hoolboom]] compared the themes to those of the 1989 [[Hollywood]] film ''[[Do the Right Thing]]'', writing that had [[short films]] been respected it would have been a watershed mark.{{sfn|Hoolboom|2008|p=29}} That year she also released the three-minute ''M. Nourbese Philip''.{{sfn|Hoolboom|2008|p=34}} She then took a five-year hiatus, which she spent in Korea.{{sfn|MacDonald 2001, Helen Lee}}

==Post Korea==
In 2000 Lee released the 22-minute short ''Subrosa'', following a woman's search for her mother in [[Seoul]]. Intended as a prequel for an undeveloped film entitled ''Priceless'', the film was shot in several formats with a fifteen-person crew, hurriedly recording scenes in public locations. It extensively used character-centred shots, leading to what Lee described as an organic understanding of the character. It also featured on-screen [[sexual intercourse]], framed in a [[medium shot]], which Lee intended as a [[Sign (semiotics)|sign]] and not simply a [[sex scene]].{{sfn|Hoolboom|2008|p=30}} Although ''Priceless'', meant as a sequel to ''Subrosa'', went through more than thirty drafts, it was ultimately cancelled{{sfn|Hoolboom|2008|p=32}} despite interest from [[Alliance Atlantis]] and [[Citytv]].{{sfn|MacDonald 2001, Helen Lee}}

Anita Lee, co-producer of ''Priceless'', then suggested that Helen Lee make ''[[The Art of Woo]]'', a [[romantic comedy]] sponsored by the Canadian Film Centre; it was Lee's [[feature film]] debut.{{sfn|Hoolboom|2008|p=32}}{{sfn|Braun 2001, Art of Woo}} Starring Adam Beach and [[Sook Yin Lee]], the film followed a Korean-Canadian art dealer who finds herself interested in a [[First Nations|native]] artist but considers him unworthy as he is poor. Released in 2001,{{sfn|Braun 2001, Art of Woo}} the film was "slashed" by critics.{{sfn|Hoolboom|2008|p=33}} For example, Jonathan Crow, writing for the [[Rovi Corporation]], found the film "less fun and less accomplished than a third grade theater production".{{sfn|Crow, The Art of Woo}} However, its soundtrack&amp;nbsp;– by [[Ron Sexsmith]] and [[Kurt Swinghammer]]&amp;nbsp;– won a [[Genie Awards|Genie Award]] for ''Best Achievement in Music&amp;nbsp;– Original Song''.{{sfn|Crow, The Art of Woo}} That year she also released the three-minute ''Star''.{{sfn|Hoolboom|2008|p=34}}

After ''The Art of Woo'', Lee announced that intended to adapt Kerri Sakamoto's novel ''The Electrical Field'' and a "romantic thriller".{{sfn|Reel.com 2001, Interview}} However, neither film has yet been released.{{sfn|Lee, Filmography}} In 2002 she showed the [[video installation]] ''Cleaving'' at the Werkleitz Biennale in Germany.{{sfn|Shimizu|Lee|2004|p=1396}} She married around 2008,{{sfn|Hoolboom|2008|pp=22–23}} and that same year released the short ''Hers at Last'', about the interactions of two women in Korea.{{sfn|Ciné-Asie 2009, Hers at Last}} The short was premiered at the Seoul International Women's Film Festival as part of an omnibus entitled ''Ten Ten'', in celebration of the festival's tenth anniversary. The omnibus also featured works by fellow directors [[Byun Young-joo]] and Lee Su-yeon.{{sfn|Newsen 2008, Seoul International Women's Film Festival}}

==Themes==
Race, [[gender issues]], and [[racial identity]] often feature in Lee's works.{{sfn|Shimizu|Lee|2004|p=1390}} The main characters, up through ''The Art of Woo'', are Asian women that are "caught up in some cross cultural encounter".{{sfn|Shimizu|Lee|2004|p=1393}} She writes that she attempts to address these issues through her films in non-[[didactic]] ways, such that the "racial melancholia&amp;nbsp;... are like seepages in the more obvious dramatic or comedic content".{{sfn|Shimizu|Lee|2004|p=1393}} She contrasts her films with the 1993 drama ''[[The Joy Luck Club (film)|The Joy Luck Club]]'', which she considers a film with obvious, easily consumable, ethnic content.{{sfn|Shimizu|Lee|2004|p=1394}} She considers the stereotype of Asian women as seductresses, either demure "lotus blossoms" or vociferous "dragon ladies", to be a degenerative one which is "sometimes extremely offensive", but one that has "a cultural memory that demands [the viewer's] attention."{{sfn|Jew|1991|pp=44–47}}

Lee's works often include elements of sexuality in their characterizations. She writes that the main characters of ''My Niagara'' and ''Subrosa'' reach a greater understanding of themselves and their relationships after sexual encounters. She considers sex as "never the culmination or end point", but a [[sign (semiotics)|sign]]ifier for intimacy.{{sfn|Shimizu|Lee|2004|p=1389}} As such, she feels that the more intimate aspects of sex are best conveyed wordlessly, through how it is presented, although she concedes that "talky sex" can be appropriate for romantic comedies.{{sfn|Shimizu|Lee|2004|p=1389}}

'''Heroic realism''' is art used as [[propaganda]]. Examples include the [[Socialist realism]] style associated with [[Communist]] regimes, and sometimes [[Art of the Third Reich|the similar art style]] associated with [[Fascism]].  Its characteristics are [[realism (arts)|realism]] and the depiction of figures as ideal types or symbols, often with explicit rejection of [[modern art|modernism]] in art (as "[[bourgeois]]" or "[[Degenerate Art|degenerate]]").

==Purposes==
Both socialist art and Nazi art were explicitly ordered to be heroic,&lt;ref&gt;Richard Overy, ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia'', p.&amp;nbsp;355 {{ISBN|0-393-02030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were in consequence ideal rather than realistic.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Overy, ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia'', p.&amp;nbsp;356 {{ISBN|0-393-02030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heroic realism designs were used to propagate the revolution in the Soviet Union during [[Lenin]]'s time. Lenin doubted that the illiterate population would understand what abstract visual images were intended to communicate. He also thought that artists, such as [[Constructivism (art)|constructivists]] and [[Productivism (art)|productivists]], may have had a hidden agenda against the government.  Movements such as [[Cubism]] were denounced as bourgeois and criticized for its failure to draw on the heritage of art and for rejecting the beautiful on the grounds that it was "old",&lt;ref&gt;Oleg Sopontsinsky, ''Art in the Soviet Union: Painting, Sculpture, Graphic Arts'', p.&amp;nbsp;6 Aurora Art Publishers, Leningrad, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; whereas [[proletarian culture]] had to draw on what was learned in the prior times.  The artists countered such thinking, however, by saying that the advanced art represented the advanced political ideas.

In literature, [[Maxim Gorky]] urged that one obtained realism by extracting the basic idea from reality, but by adding the potential and desirable to it, one added romantism with deep revolutionary potential.&lt;ref&gt;R. H. Stacy, ''Russian Literary Criticism'' p.&amp;nbsp;188 {{ISBN|0-8156-0108-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
[[File:1988 CPA 6017.jpg|thumb|300px|''Worker and Kolkhoz Woman'']]
[[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] understood the powerful message which could be sent through images to a primarily illiterate population. Once he was in power, posters quickly became the new medium for educating illiterate peasants on daily life—from bathing, to farming, the posters provided visual instruction on almost everything.  In 1931-2, the early emphasis on the "little man" and the anonymous laboring masses gave way to the "hero of labor", derived from the people but set apart by the scale of his deeds.&lt;ref name="overy259"&gt;Richard Overy, ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia'', p.&amp;nbsp;259 {{ISBN|0-393-02030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a consequence, literature filled with "positive heroes" that were sometimes tedious.&lt;ref&gt;R. H. Stacy, ''Russian Literary Criticism'' p.&amp;nbsp;224 {{ISBN|0-8156-0108-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, a new doctrine called [[Socialist realism]] came about. This new movement rejected the "bourgeois influence on art" and replaced it with appreciation for figurative painting, photography and new typography layouts.  Writers were explicitly enjoined to develop "heroization."&lt;ref name="overy259"/&gt;  At the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne|Paris World Fair]], [[Vera Mukhina]]'s ''[[Worker and Kolkhoz Woman]]'' exemplified the ideal [[New Soviet Man]], depicting a man and woman in working clothes, with his hammer and her sickle crossed, in a monumental statue with both striding forward.&lt;ref name="overy260"/&gt;

When [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in Germany in 1933, [[modern art]] was condemned as [[Degenerate art|degenerate]], and largely prohibited. The [[Nazi]]s promoted a style of art based on classical models, intended to nurture nationalism.  Heroic realism was to inculcate values of sacrifice, duty, and devotion.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Marcuse]], ''Negations'', p.&amp;nbsp;29-30 Beacon Press, Boston 1968&lt;/ref&gt;  The heroic man, who was bound to [[blood and soil]], acted rather than thought and sacrificed himself.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Marcuse, ''Negations'', p.&amp;nbsp;2 Beacon Press, Boston 1968&lt;/ref&gt;  This particularly favored the heroic death.&lt;ref&gt;eye magazine: [http://www.eyemagazine.com/feature.php?id=62&amp;fid=270 Designing heroes]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nazi theory explicitly rejected "materialism", and therefore, despite the realistic treatment of images, "realism" was a seldom used term.&lt;ref name="Adam138"&gt;Peter Adam, ''Art of the Third Reich'' p.&amp;nbsp;138 {{ISBN|0-8109-1912-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A painter was to create an ideal picture, for eternity.&lt;ref name="Adam138" /&gt; The images of men, and still more of women, were heavily stereotyped,&lt;ref&gt;Peter Adam, ''Art of the Third Reich'' p.&amp;nbsp;150 {{ISBN|0-8109-1912-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; with physical perfection required for the nude paintings.&lt;ref name="sontag3"&gt;[[Susan Sontag]],"[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1975/feb/06/fascinating-fascism/?page=3 Fascinating Fascism]"&lt;/ref&gt;  In painting, peasants were popular images, reflecting a simple life in harmony with nature.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Adam, ''Art of the Third Reich'' p.&amp;nbsp;132 {{ISBN|0-8109-1912-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Sculpture's monumental possibilities gave it a better expression of Nazi racial theories.&lt;ref name="Adam177"&gt;Peter Adam, ''Art of the Third Reich'' p.&amp;nbsp;177 {{ISBN|0-8109-1912-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most common image was of the nude male, expressing the ideal of the Aryan race.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Adam, ''Art of the Third Reich'' p.&amp;nbsp;178 {{ISBN|0-8109-1912-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Arno Breker]]'s skill at this type made him Hitler's favorite sculptor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlantic-times.com/archive_detail.php?recordID=602 Caroline Fetscher, "Why Mention Arno Breker Today?", ''The Atlantic Times'', August, 2006.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211083704/http://www.atlantic-times.com/archive_detail.php?recordID=602 |date=2012-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nude females were also common, though they tended to be less monumental.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Adam, ''Art of the Third Reich'' p.&amp;nbsp;188 {{ISBN|0-8109-1912-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In both cases, the physical form was to show no imperfections.&lt;ref name="sontag3"/&gt;  At the [[Paris Exposition of 1937]], [[Josef Thorak]]'s ''Comradeship'' stood outside the German pavilion, depicting two enormous nude males, clasping hands and standing defiantly side by side, in a pose of defense and racial camaraderie.&lt;ref name="overy260"&gt;[[Richard Overy]], ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia'', p.&amp;nbsp;260 {{ISBN|0-393-02030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hip-hop theater''' is a form of theater that presents contemporary stories through the use of one or more of the four elements of hip-hop culture—[[b-boying]], [[Graffiti#Modern graffiti|graffiti]] writing, [[rapping|MCing]] (rapping), and [[Turntablism|DJing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast | url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4183762 | title = Will Power, Telling Stories through 'Hip Hop Theatre' | website = [[NPR]] | publisher = The Tavis Smiley Show | host = Tavis Smiley | date = November 23, 2004 | accessdate = October 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mania&gt;{{cite news|last=Hopkins |first=Philip |title=Hip-Hop Takes the Stage |work=Theater Mania |date=June 3, 2003 |url=http://www.theatermania.com/content/news.cfm?int_news_id=3579 |accessdate=November 3, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/628apiFhB?url=http://www.theatermania.com/content/news.cfm?int_news_id=3579 |archivedate=October 2, 2011 |quote='Everyone has a different definition of how hip-hop applies to theater,' says Valentin, who published the hip-hop-culture-focused Stress Magazine before becoming involved as a producer with some of the genre's bigger names. According to Valentin, 'Every show doesn't necessarily have to include the four basic elements of hip-hop: a DJ, graffiti-based visual art, breakdancing, and an MC or rapper.' But he concurs with Forbes about the importance of 'the language on stage, the story, and the vibe,' adding that 'relevance to today's world, urban or otherwise, is a major part' of the hip-hop theater experience. |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other cultural markers of [[hip-hop]] such as [[performance poetry|spoken word]], [[beatboxing]], and [[hip-hop dance]] can be included as well although they are not always present. What is most important is the language of the theatrical piece and the plot's relevance to the world.&lt;ref name=mania/&gt; Danny Hoch, founder of the Hip-Hop Theater Festival, further defines it as such: "Hip-hop theatre must fit into the realm of theatrical performance, and it must be ''by, about and for'' the hip-hop generation, participants in hip-hop culture, or both."&lt;ref name=aesthetic&gt;{{cite web|last=Hoch |first=Danny |title=Towards a Hip-Hop Aesthetic: A Manifesto for the Hip-Hop Arts Movement |url=http://www.dannyhoch.com/pdf/TowardsAHip-HopAesthetic.pdf |date=September 14, 2005 |work=DannyHoch.com |accessdate=November 3, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/628bIFIEM?url=http://www.dannyhoch.com/pdf/TowardsAHip-HopAesthetic.pdf |archivedate=October 2, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hip-hop theater productions appear in a wide range of platforms including single performances, week-long festivals, and traveling [[Theatre#Repertory companies|repertory]] companies. [[Marc Bamuthi Joseph]] is an award-winning [[spoken word]] poet and dancer who has been commissioned several times to create and direct single hip-hop theater works. [[British people|British]] choreographer Jonzi D is the artistic director of the London-based Breakin' Convention, a week long hip-hop theater festival. [[Rennie Harris]], Mourad Merzouki, and Victor Quijada are artistic directors who run hip-hop theater companies in the U.S., France, and Canada respectively. The Rock Steady Crew, Magnificent Force, and the Rhythm Technicians pioneered this theatrical genre which started in the United States.

==History==
Though hip-hop culture has managed to establish itself on film, on television, in fashion, in music, and in the dance industry, it has not gained the same momentum in theater. Stage productions are few in number but growing.&lt;ref name=voice&gt;{{cite news|last=Weber |first=Bruce |title=Hip-Hop's Distinct Voice Is Reshaping Theater |work=The New York Times |date=June 25, 2002 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/25/theater/critic-s-notebook-hip-hop-s-distinct-voice-is-reshaping-theater.html?scp=3&amp;sq=Hip-Hop%27s%20Distinct%20Voice%20Is%20Reshaping%20Theater%22.%20&amp;st=cse |accessdate=October 25, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/628bU1ijR?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/25/theater/critic-s-notebook-hip-hop-s-distinct-voice-is-reshaping-theater.html?scp=3&amp;sq=Hip-Hop%27s%20Distinct%20Voice%20Is%20Reshaping%20Theater%22.%20&amp;st=cse |archivedate=October 2, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first hip-hop stage shows were 1990's [[off Broadway]] [[musical theatre|musical]] ''So!

'''''Il Frontespizio''''' (meaning ''The Frontispiece'' in English) was an [[Italian language|Italian]] art and [[literary magazine]], which had a [[Catholicism in Italy|Catholic]] perspective. The magazine existed between 1929 and 1940.

The '''Ipuwer Papyrus''' (officially Papyrus Leiden I 344&lt;!--REDIRECT--&gt; ''recto'') is an [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[hieratic]] [[papyrus]] made during the [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt]], and now held in the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[Rijksmuseum van Oudheden|National Museum of Antiquities]] in [[Leiden]], [[Netherlands]].{{sfn|Quirke|2014|p=167}} It contains the '''''Admonitions of Ipuwer''''', an incomplete [[Ancient Egyptian literature|literary work]] whose original composition is dated no earlier than the late [[Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt]] (c.1991–1803 BCE).{{sfn|Willems|2010|p=83}}

==Content==
In the poem, Ipuwer – a name typical of the period 1850-1450 BCE – complains that the world has been turned upside-down: a woman who had not a single box now has furniture, a girl who looked at her face in the water now owns a mirror, while the once-rich man is now in rags. He demands that the Lord of All (a title which can be applied both to the king and to the creator sun-god) should destroy his enemies and remember his religious duties. This is followed by a violent description of disorder: there is no longer any respect for the law and even the king's burial inside the [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramid]] has been desecrated. The story continues with the description of better days until it abruptly ends due to the missing final part of the papyrus. It is likely that the poem concluded with a reply of the Lord of All, or prophesying the coming of a powerful king who would restore order.{{sfn|Gardiner|1961|p=109-110}}{{sfn|Grimal|1992|p=138}}{{sfn|Quirke|2014|p=167}}

==Discussion==
The Ipuwer Papyrus has been dated no earlier than the [[Nineteenth Dynasty]], around 1250 BCE{{sfn|Quirke|2014|p=167}}{{sfn|Shaw|2013|p=745}} but it is now agreed that the text itself is much older, and dated back to the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]], though no earlier than the late Twelfth Dynasty.{{sfn|Willems|2010|p=83}}

It was previously thought that the ''Admonitions of Ipuwer'' presents an objective portrait of Egypt in the [[First Intermediate Period]].{{sfn|Gardiner|1961|p=109-110}}{{sfn|Bresciani|1969|p=65}}{{sfn|Grimal|1992|p=138}} In more recent times, it was found that the ''Admonitions'', along with the ''[[Khakheperresenb|Complaints of Khakheperresenb]]'', are most likely works of royal [[propaganda]], both inspired by the earlier ''[[Prophecy of Neferti]]'': the three compositions have in common the theme of a nation that has been plunged into chaos and disarray and the need for an intransigent king who would defeat chaos and restore ''[[maat]]''.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2010|p=174–175}} [[Toby Wilkinson]] suggested that the ''Admonitions'' and ''Khakheperresenb'' may thus have been composed during the reign of [[Senusret III]], a pharaoh well known for his use of propaganda.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2010|p=174–175}} In any case, the ''Admonitions'' is not a reliable account of early Egyptian history, because of the long time interval between its original composition and the writing of the Leiden Papyrus.{{sfn|Quirke|2014|p=167}}{{sfn|Shaw|2013|p=745}}

The ''Admonitions'' is considered the world's earliest known treatise on [[political ethics]], suggesting that a good king is one who controls unjust officials, thus carrying out the will of the gods.{{sfn|Gabriel|2002|p=23}} It is a textual [[lamentation]], close to [[Sumeria]]n city laments and to Egyptian laments for the dead, using the past (the destruction of [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] at the end of the [[Old Kingdom]]) as a gloomy backdrop to an ideal future.{{sfn|Morenz|2003|p=103–111}}

===Ipuwer and the Book of Exodus===
Ipuwer has often been put forward in popular literature as confirmation of the Biblical account, most notably because of its statement that "[[Plagues of Egypt#1. Water_into_blood_(דָם):_Ex._7:14–24|the river is blood]]" and its frequent references to servants running away, but there are also points in which the Ipuwer contradicts the Exodus story as found in the Bible, such as the fact that its Asiatics are arriving in Egypt rather than leaving. The "river is blood" phrase may also refer to the red sediment colouring the Nile during disastrous floods, or may simply be a poetic image of turmoil.{{sfn|Enmarch|2011|p=173–175}} The archeological evidence does not support the story of [[the Exodus]], and most historians no longer consider it relevant to the story of the emergence of Israel.{{sfn|Meyers|2005|p=5–6}}{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=81}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6068">While many [[Islamism|Islamist]] [[Jihadism|jihadists]] view [[Hip hop|hip-hop]] negatively, due to its Western origins, there have also been examples of [[Middle Eastern hip hop|hip-hop songs]] [[Political hip hop|with]] pro-jihadist lyrics, and of jihadists embracing hip-hop and [[gangsta rap|gangsta]] culture as a way of attracting Westerners to join their organizations. The phenomenon is sometimes known as "[[Jihad Cool]]" and includes music, clothing, magazine, videos and other media.

==Notable examples==
German rapper [[Deso Dogg]] later took the names Abu Talha al-Almani&lt;ref name="tahroor"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/08/25/the-strange-role-of-rappers-in-the-islamic-states-jihad/|title=The strange role of rappers in the Islamic State’s jihad|work=[[The Washington Post]]|first=Ishaan |last=Tharoor|date=25 August 2014|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Abou Maleeq, and joined ISIL in 2014.

British-born [[Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary]] rapped under the name L Jinny, is the son of Egyptian militant [[Adel Abdel Bari]], and was reportedly videotaped beheading journalist [[James Foley (journalist)|James Foley]]. Jinny once [[Twitter|Tweeted]] a photo of himself holding a man's severed head, with the words "Chillin' with my [[homie]] or what's left of him."&lt;ref name="dickey" /&gt; These rappers, in turn, have inspired other jihadist activities; one young Kosovar was reportedly inspired by Deso Dogg's lyrics to fire at an American military bus in [[Frankfurt, Germany|Frankfurt]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

[[Douglas McCain]] was an aspiring rapper and basketball player who was killed while fighting for ISIL in 2014. His classmates described him as a "goofball" who "got along with most", while a coworker referred to him as a "normal guy".&lt;ref name="McCain"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/newsgram/articles/2014/08/27/douglas-mcauthur-mccain-basketball-player-rapper-islamic-state-fighter|title=American Killed Fighting for Islamic State|first=Andrew |last=Soergel|date=27 August 2014|accessdate=29 September 2014|work=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISIL, in particular, has used social media in attempts to reach young people, many of whom do not necessarily have any Muslim background at all. Two young British jihadists who travelled to Syria to join ISIL reportedly learned everything they knew about Islam from reading the book ''Islam for Dummies''. As a result, many of recruits are believed not to be motivated by Islam as such, but rather by a combination of anger (either feeling oppressed themselves, or wanting to fight on behalf of the oppressed) and the desire for fame and glory. They end up turning to ISIL and jihadism as an outlet for these feelings.&lt;ref name="dickey" /&gt;

==Analysis==
Anthropologist [[Scott Atran]] argues that the phenomenon results from a search for "sacred values" and what [[Edmund Burke]] called "the sublime"; a "quest for greatness, glory, eternal meaning in an inherently chaotic world".&lt;ref name="dickey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/25/isis-hip-hop-jihadists-and-the-man-who-killed-james-foley.html|title=ISIS, Hip-Hop Jihadists and the Man Who Killed James Foley|first=Christopher|last=Dickey|date=25 August 2014|accessdate=29 September 2014|work=[[The Daily Beast]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amir Khan has cited Douglas McCain as yet another example of this phenomenon, and said that both Islamism and gangsta rap foster a "sense of grievance towards wider society" and "focus on vengeance and fetishize violence as a way of redressing the balance". Khan says that while researching young Islamists in London, he found that they looked to the works of [[50 Cent]] and [[Tupac Shakur]] for inspiration. Khan argues that what sets ISIL apart from other jihadist groups, and makes it far more dangerous as a result, is its ability to harness hip-hop to "bestow on its struggle a counter-culture sense of subversive 'cool' that mainstream political parties and even commercial brands might envy." ISIL's marketing methods and overall strategies are also reminiscent of those used by street gangs.&lt;ref name="khan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/08/al-qaedas-new-front-jihadi-rap-110481_Page2.html#.VAZjoJUg-Uk|title=Al Qaeda’s New Front: Jihadi Rap|first=Amil|last=Kahn|date=31 August 2014|accessdate=29 September 2014|work=[[Politico]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hisham Aidi has written a book, ''Rebel Music: Race, Empire, and the New Muslim Youth Culture'' describing the phenomenon of Islamist hip-hop, but Aidi also mentions that the United States and other Western governments have attempted to use hip-hop and [[Sufi music]] to ''fight'' terrorism by deradicalizing young Muslims.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} One American rapper, [[Abu Mansoor Al-Amriki|Omar Hamaami]], who later joined [[al-Shabaab (militant group)|al-Shabaab]], released a song with the lyrics "Bomb by bomb, blast by blast, only going to bring back the glorious past."&lt;ref name="fp"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/04/29/9_disturbingly_good_jihadi_raps|title=9 Disturbingly Good Jihadi Raps|first=J. Dana|last=Stuster|date=29 April 2013|accessdate=29 September 2014|work=[[Foreign Policy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon of jihadi rap has been around since at least 2004, when the song "[[Dirty Kuffar]]" was released. In 2006, [[Aki Nawaz]] of the group [[Fun-Da-Mental]] released an album with lyrics comparing [[Osama bin Laden]] to [[Che Guevara]] and depicting the [[Statue of Liberty]] as an [[abu Ghraib prison]]er.&lt;ref name="cicero"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ciceromagazine.com/features/is-extremist-hip-hop-helping-isis/|title=Is Extremist Hip Hop Helping ISIS?|first=Hisham |last=Aidi|date=25 August 2014|accessdate=29 September 2014|work=[[Cicero (magazine)|Cicero]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kathy Rae Huffman''' is an American curator, writer, producer, researcher, lecturer and expert for video and media art. Since the early 1980s, Huffman is said to have helped establish video and new media art, online and interactive art, installation and performance art in the visual arts world. She has curated, written about, and coordinated events for numerous international art institutes, consulted and juried for festivals and alternative arts organisations. Huffman not only introduced video and digital computer art to museum exhibitions, she also pioneered tirelessly to bring television channels and video artists together, in order to show video artworks on TV. From the early 1990s until 2014, Huffman was based in Europe, and embraced early net art and interactive online environments, a curatorial practice that continues. In 1997, she co-founded the [[Faces (online community)|Faces]] mailing list and online community for women working with art, gender and technology. Till today, Huffman is working in the USA, in Canada and in Europe.&lt;br&gt;

== Education ==
Huffman received an MFA in Exhibition Design (with distinction) from the School of Fine Art, California State University Long Beach (CSULB) in 1979 under the supervision of Stacy Dukes, with a second major in Radio/Film/Television. She also completed a two-year postgraduate certificate program in Gallery and Museum Studies from CSULB, under the guidance of Constance Glenn, in 1980. She holds a Life Membership Awarded, [[Phi Kappa Phi]] honor society.
As an art student in the 1970s, Huffman supported herself with a part-time job as 'staff artist' for the Long Beach Public Library system - one of the first institutions to acquire portable video equipment. She used the Sony Portapak to document library events. To learn more about video and its potential as a tool for artmaking, she joined the Museum Studies course at CSULB. Huffman met the video artist [[Bill Viola]] in 1976 and began to work in collaboration with him on his ambitious project, the interactive video and sound installation ''Olfaction''. It was presented at the final group exhibition 'Beyond the Artists' Hand' for the Museum Studies course. ''Olfaction'' worked perfectly for the entire exhibition; since then, Huffman has tried to match that level of achievement for every show she curated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.josephinebosma.com/web/node/80] Interview by Josephine Bosma with Kathy Rae Huffman, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, then deputy director at the Long Beach Museum of Art David Ross invited Huffman to complete her 6-month professional internship, the final requirement of the CSULB Museum Studies course. From 1977 till 1979, Huffman was Video Coordinator for the Los Angeles-based non-profit organization "Some Serious Business, Inc" (directed by Nancy Drew, Susan Martin, and Elizabeth Freeman), and she managed numerous video screening events and Southern California cable television series in collaboration with the LBMA, like the artists program 'Made for TV', organized by 'The Kitchen' (New York City){{fact|date=October 2017}}. In 1978, Huffman was assistant curator and exhibition designer for ''Streamline Moderne'', a survey of household objects, vehicles, and graphic design of the 1930s and 40’s. Curator was Stacy Dukes, at the CSULB Art Gallery.  In 1979, Huffman coordinated ''Picturephone Performance'', a live performance by Nam June Paik and numerous invited artists, between Los Angeles and New York.{{fact|date=October 2017}}&lt;br&gt;


== Professional Practice ==

=== Long Beach Museum of Art, 1979 - 1984 ===
Huffman was appointed Chief Curator at the Long Beach Museum of Art in Long Beach, California in late 1979, after she had served one year as the Video Coordinator for curator Nancy Drew. Under her direction, she established '''LBMA Video''' as a regional media art center, with fundraising for a multimedia workshop and broadcast quality post-production facility for artists at a former (and unused) police precinct in Belmont Shore (a hip, young Long Beach community). This media art center included technical services, video editing studios, a videotape and media art library, production equipment for loan, a performance space, exhibition program, and a visiting artist programme. LBMA Video collaborated with the local cable TV station to produce and present artists on TV. Most important, LBMA Video operated an open door policy, and artists from around the world used its facility. Huffman curated and produced several media art installations in the LBMA, for example by [[Gary Hill]], [[Bill Viola]], Eleanor Antin, [[Dara Birnbaum]], [[Laurie Anderson]], [[Ant Farm]]. Exhibitions curated and produced by Huffman (selection):

==== Hole in Space ====
Huffman curated and produced the exhibition ''Hole in Space'' at the LBMA in 1980, a groundbreaking live communication sculpture by Kit Galloway and Sherrie Rabinowitz (K&amp;S). ''Hole in Space'' was the first public video chat, linking large displays on public squares in New York and Los Angeles with a satellite feed. This engineering prototype illustrated K&amp;S's vision of large screen teleconferencing. (But after that event, K&amp;S didn't do large screen teleconferencing again, instead moved to early video streaming via internet.) &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyIJJr6Ldg8]  A Hole in Space LA-NY, 1980 - the mother of all video chats.  30 minutes video documentation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecafe.com/museum/history/ksoverview2.html]  Electronic Cafe: Kit Galloway &amp; Sherrie Rabinowitz - a quarter century of pioneering artistic achievements 1975-2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==== California Video ====
As US Commissioner at the Paris Biennial, and curator of a survey of new video from California, Huffman presented the exhibition ''California Video'' as the American Selection in the [[Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris]], 1980. The exhibition toured (with a catalog) through 1982.

==== The Artist and Television ====
Huffman was West Coast segment producer for this live 3 hour television event: ''The Artist and Television'', initiated by [[Jaime Davidovich]], was a live interactive teleconference that took place in Iowa City, Los Angeles and New York City in October 1982. Artists, curators, critics and performers in all three cities interacted with each other via satellite, conducting interviews and presenting live art and musical performances. The event was broadcast nationwide through the American Television and Communications Corporation and ACSN (The Learning Channel). The issues discussed included video as art medium, and the accessibility of broadcast television for artists. The event was produced as a collaboration of the Long Beach Museum of Art, the University of California (Los Angeles), and the University of Iowa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/artist-and-television/oclc/560771255] ''The Artist and Television'', three videotapes that document this live interactive teleconference from 1982&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most successful projects, where artists could try out live performance from three points for the first time ever: ''Atari is the New Parent'', by John Sturgeon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnsturgeon.net/archivedproject/atari-is-the-new-parent/] John Sturgeon: ''Atari is the New Parent'' - a project in the framework of ''The Artist and Television'', 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Artist and the Computer ====
Curator of the first west coast survey of the use of computers in artmaking, including workshops, demonstrations, lectures and performances at the Long Beach Museum of Art, and collaborating institutions California State University Long Beach, and University of Southern California, January–February 1983. It was a pioneering overview of how computers were utilized in various media (video, sculpture, printmaking, photography, installation, performance and drawing).

==== At Home: Ten Years of Feminist Art in Southern California ====
A retrospective of Womenhouse artists, October 1983. Huffman was event coordinator for the regional Los Angeles county initiative to celebrate the 10 year anniversary of WOMANHOUSE (since 1972) and the founding of the Southern California feminist movement. More than fifty institutions or groups participated in the month-long calendar of event. She also coordinated and co-curated HAUNTED WOMANHOUSE, a feminist performance festival on the Long Beach Museum of Art grounds, and was co-curator, with Lyn Blumenthal, of the video exhibition ''Roles Relationships and Sexuality''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nancybuchanan.net/Resume_2015.pdf] Nancy Buchanan resume&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Shared Realities ====
Executive producer of the Long Beach Museum of Art's cable television series, including interviews, artists videotapes, and special projects. Huffman initiated the statewide conference called ''Shared Realities'', held in Long Beach, aboard the Queen Mary, 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.josephinebosma.com/web/node/80] Interview by Josephine Bosma with Kathy Rae Huffman, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;


=== Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA) Boston / The CAT Fund ===

1984-1991, Huffman was Adjunct Curator at the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston, Massachusetts. The ICA was Boston's premiere educational and exhibition space for contemporary art. As adjunct curator, Huffman contributed exhibition concepts, community projects, and collaborations with local, regional and national media organizations.

Huffman was appointed curator/producer of [[The Contemporary Art Television Fund / The CAT Fund]], a pilot project of the [[Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston]] and WGBH TV’s New Television Workshop, Boston’s public television station, with a mandate to create a context for artists to define television as a medium for their personal expression. Funded initially by the Massachusetts Art Council, The CAT Fund was designed to play an active role in the development of artists' TV internationally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.experimentaltvcenter.org/contemporary-art-television-fund] Experimental TV Center: The Contemporary Art Television Fund&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to Southern California, the east coast seemed to Huffman more theoritical and political. The ICA Boston (directed by David Ross) was a very studious environment. Beside this stronger intellectual inspiration, Huffman had the opportunity to be more involved with artists working with digital processes. She commissioned one of [[Bill Seaman]]'s early interactive computer works and presented exhibitions using digital technology. Artists commissioned for 'The CAT Fund' included (among others): Laurie Anderson, Bill Viola, Tony Oursler, Constance de Jong, Joan Jonas, Dara Birnbaum, Raul Ruiz, Marcel Odenbach, Bill Seaman, Daniel Reeves, Ken Fiengold, Chip Lord, Doug Hall, [[Ilene Segalove]], William Wegman and Michael Smith.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.aec.at/media/archive/1986/182013/File_01874_AEC_FE_1986.pdf] Ars Electronica Center: Kathy Rae Huffman about the Contemporary Art Television Fund, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Arts for Television ====
A major touring exhibition, commissioned by MOCA in Los Angeles. Huffman was co-curator with Dorine Mignot, Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, and Julie Lazar, Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA) Los Angeles, of the first museum survey to examine television as a form and forum for the contemporary arts. Exhibition premiered simultaneously in the Netherlands and USA, 1987, and traveled to more than one dozen institutions in Europe and North America in 1988 and 1989.

==== TIME CODE ====
Huffman was series initiator and US producer of the international television magazine TIME CODE, a non-verbal artists collaboration, co-produced with Channel 4 (UK), RTBF (Belgium), NOS (Netherlands), TVE (Spain) and ZDF (Germany). The series continued until 1990, with various countries coordinating the submissions and international broadcast schedule. Program one, ''Sense of Place'', included TIME SQUARED by Branda Miller, 1987.

==== Deconstruction, Quotation and Subversion: Video from Yugoslavia ====
Huffman was guest curator for this show at Artists' Space, New York City, in 1989. The exhibition was presented at the Artists' Space in New York and the ICA in Boston.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.videodokument.org/cronology.htm] Videodokument - a comprehensive overview of thirty years of video art in Slovenia. Chronology, see 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

==== VGTV - All America Tour ====
Boston Residency for Van Gogh TV and tour coordinator for VGTV presentations in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, Vancouver, Philadelphia, Omaha, and New York City. Tour began with a live 4 hour interactive broadcast event in Boston from Continental Cable Television, January 1991.

=== Freelance Curatorial Projects and Productions 1991-1998 ===

1991 - 1998, Huffman worked as free-lance writer, curator, lecturer, producer and consultant, based in Austria. During this time, Huffman researched new areas of contemporary art, became invested in the internet in the early 1990s, travelled extensively throughout East and Central Europe, lectured at art schools, and presented film and video art program selections at numerous international festivals. She was a regular contributor to the ''Ars Electronica'' festival in Linz, taught at the [[Academy of Fine Arts Vienna]], and lectured at the ''Freie Klasse'', [[University of Applied Arts Vienna]].

==== Women, Myth and Sexuality ====
Curator for the special video program at the EMAF European Media Art Festival, Osnabrück, 1990. Also shown in Boston, Vienna, Ljubljana, and Zagreb in 1991.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emaf.de/files/european_media_art_festival_1990.pdf]  Program of the European Media Art Festival Osnabrück 1990. See pages 91-94&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Collaborative and (online) communication projects ===

==== Siberian Deal ====
In this project, Huffman acted as a net activist and net artist. Siberian Deal, 1995, was a real travel and virtual internet artwork with Eva Wohlgemuth, which examined the value of objects in post-communist society. During their journey through Siberia, Wohlgemuth and Huffman filled their online cyber diary (today we would call it a weblog) with digital images, videos and text. The journey was a challenging adventure, on the physical and on the technical level, while the internet connection broke down regularly. Their audience interacted and accompanied them by email.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heise.de/tp/artikel/4/4828/1.html] Keine Angst vor 0 und 1 - Künstlerinnen erobern das Netz, by Christiane Wettig, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Siberian Deal received the first prize for Interactive Art at the ''VideoFest'' Berlin 1996  (now media art festival [[Transmediale]]). In the same year, it was presented at the ''Next 5 Minutes'' (n5m) conference in Amsterdam. The original travel report isn't online anymore.&lt;ref&gt;Siberian Deal: Snapshots of icf.de/siberian_deal are available at the [[Wayback Machine]]&lt;/ref&gt; The website was featured in numerous festivals and exhibitions, and a text by Paoli Bianchi was included in the Kunstforum International special issue II of the Art of Travel, Spring 1997. The multi-media analysis and review of the trading of objects during travels in Siberia isn't online anymore.&lt;ref&gt;Siberian Deal review: Snapshots of  t0.or.at/~siberian/vrteil.htm  are available at the Internet Archive [[Wayback Machine]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Face Settings ====
The second collaborative internet artwork with Eva Wohlgemuth, 1996-1998: A project of internet communication and of cooking meetings in various international cities between women in remote European regions. Women working in various artistic and scientific disciplines met in Russia, Serbia, Spain (Basque), the United Kingdom (Scotland) and Austria. They were united in a common net strategy regionally, for information exchange, theoretical development, and artistic expression. The project initiated a female-only mailing list of media specialists of more than 100 women from twenty countries.&lt;ref&gt;Face Settings: http://thing.at/face/ isn't online anymore - a few snapshots are at the Internet Archive [[Wayback Machine]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pop~TARTS ====
1996-1997, Huffman was co-author with Margarete Jahrmann (a multi-media artist from Vienna) of a regular column for the Telepolis Magazine of Net Culture, sponsored by Heise Verlag, Hannover, the largest German language publisher of technical journals (IX, CT). As tele-workers, Pop~TARTS developed a palaver type of writing, in a series of informative topics, events, and interactions, in German and English. Texts were built-up jointly, by filtering the enormous data-flow on the internet from a female perspective, and inviting reader participation. Huffman and Jahrmann looked for intersections between theory and practice of websites with a focus on women and communications projects. It started as a multimedia column with a lot of involvement by other women and generated a huge amount of data. After trying out several concepts for its structure, Pop~TARTS became a more straight forward platform for texts on events and certain topics Huffman and Jahrmann chose.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heise.de/tp/] Telepolis, online newspaper by Heise Medien GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Hannover&lt;/ref&gt;

'Face Settings' and 'Pop~TARTS' were projects to build up networks and online communities, mainly among women in the media arts and media theory, and brought together offline and online communication. FACES, established in 1997, resulted after Face Settings as the online forum for women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faces-l.net] FACES online forum for women in media arts and media theory&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

'''Media imperialism''' is a theory based upon an over-[[Market concentration|concentration]] of [[mass media]] from larger nations as a significant variable in negatively affecting smaller nations, in which the national identity of smaller nations is lessened or lost due to media homogeneity inherent in mass media from the larger countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mcs.sagepub.com/content/22/4/415.abstract|title=Media imperialism revisited: some findings from the Asian case|author=Kalyani Chadha, Anandam Kavoori|publisher=Media Culture &amp; Society|accessdate=2011-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and background==
The media imperialism debate started in the early 1970s when developing countries began to criticise the control developed countries held over the media. The site for this conflict was [[UNESCO]] where the New World Information and Communication Order ([[NWICO]]) movement developed. Supported by the MacBride report, "[[MacBride report|Many Voices, One World]]", countries such as [[India]], [[Indonesia]], and [[Egypt]] argued that the large media companies should have limited access to developing countries. This argument was one of the reasons for the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], and [[Singapore]] leaving UNESCO.

In 1977, [[Oliver Boyd-Barrett]]'s "[[Media Formation Model]]" framed media imperialism as the relationship between different national media systems, particularly through [[Balance of power (international relations)|power imbalances]], and the relationship they have to historical political systems. It emphasized the industrial arrangements of media in wealthier nations and the imposition of those arrangements as “models” for foreign markets, with the most powerful producers becoming normative in their financing, structure and in the dissemination (and to some extent, content) of their products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boyd-Barrett|first1=Oliver|title=Media imperialism: towards an international framework for the analysis of media systems|journal=Mass communication and society|date=1977|pages=116–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boyd asserted a typical arrangement in which news agencies, adopted the structures, roles and “task behaviors” of their parent companies who are also providing financial support.

Later during the 1980s and 1990s, as [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] [[media conglomerates]] grow larger and more powerful many believe that it will become increasingly difficult for small, local media outlets to survive. A new type of [[imperialism]] will thus occur, making many nations subsidiary to the media products of some of the most powerful countries or companies. Significant writers and thinkers in this area include [[Ben Bagdikian]], [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Edward S. Herman]], [[Armand Mattelart]] and [[Robert W. McChesney]]. However, critics have responded that in most developing countries the most popular television and radio programs are commonly locally produced. Critics such as [[Anthony Giddens]] highlight the place of regional producers of media (such as Brazil in Latin America); other critics such as [[James Curran (media historian)|James Curran]] suggest that State government subsidies have ensured strong local production. In areas such as audience studies, it has been shown that global programs like [[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]] do not have a global audience who understand the program the same way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Liebes | first1=Tamar | first2=Elihu|last2=Katz|authorlink2=Elihu Katz|title=The export of meaning : cross-cultural readings of Dallas | publisher=Polity Press | publication-place=Cambridge | year=2004|edition=2| isbn=978-0-7456-1295-9 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A media source which ignores and/or censors important issues and events severely damages [[freedom of information]]. Many modern tabloid, twenty-four-hour news channels and other mainstream media sources have increasingly been criticized for not conforming to general standards of [[journalistic integrity]].

Media imperialism is not always an international occurrence. When a small number of companies or corporations controls all the media in a country, this too is a form of media imperialism.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Nations such as Italy and Canada are often accused of possessing an imperial media structure, based on the fact that much of their media is controlled by a small number of owners.

==Canada==
{{main|Media of Canada}}
The media in Canada can be seen as imperial in the sense of [[Concentration of media ownership|concentrated ownership]]. Apart from a relatively small number of [[Community radio|community broadcasters]], media in Canada are primarily owned by a small number of groups, including [[Bell Canada]], the Shaw family (via [[Corus Entertainment]] and [[Shaw Communications]]), [[Rogers Communications]], [[Quebecor Inc.|Quebecor]], and the government-owned [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC/Radio-Canada]]. Each of these companies holds a diverse mix of television, specialty television, and radio operations. Bell, Rogers, Shaw, and Quebecor also engage in the telecommunications industry with their ownership of internet providers, television providers, and mobile carriers, while Rogers is also involved in publishing.

==USA==
{{main|Media of the United States}}
The United States has proved to have quite a significant role in media imperialism.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} For instance, many forms of mass media demonstrate how the United States exerts media power over other countries, especially those lacking in a strong media presence.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} A major cultural influencer in other countries is television.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Osama|first=El-Sherif|date=August 20, 2001|title=Media imperialism in the global era|url=http://libproxy.boisestate.edu/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.libproxy.boisestate.edu/docview/203075150?accountid=9649|journal=Middle East News Online|volume=|pages=|via=ProQuest Central}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically in relation to [[news]] and [[journalism]], America has a strong presence in the international arena. American news networks like [[CNN]] often have large international staffs, and produce specialized regional programming for many nations.

Movies have a distinctly American dominance. For example, [[Hollywood]] is a major producer of films, which tend to be high quality and are released internationally.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/914290275|title=Media essentials : a brief introduction|last=1949-|first=Campbell, Richard,|others=Martin, Christopher R.,, Fabos, Bettina,, Harmsen, Shawn.|isbn=9781457693762|edition=Third|location=Boston|oclc=914290275}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hollywood's dominance is also seen in the term "[[Bollywood]]", describing India's [[Hindi]]-language film industry.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another form of mass media used for media imperialism is music.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Much of today's, and older, American music finds itself popular in other countries. However, in the "[[British Invasion]]" of the 1960s, British music became popular in the United States. Since then, there has not been such a large shift of imperialism. Furthermore, some could argue{{Weasel inline|date=June 2018}} that it wasn't that large of a shift of power, because it was still a dominance of Western influence.

Overall, American media imperialism can be seen as a positive and a negative. Negative views towards it stem from the negative connotation of the word 'imperialism'.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/899205069|title=Media imperialism|last=Oliver,|first=Boyd-Barrett,|isbn=9781446268704|location=London|oclc=899205069}}&lt;/ref&gt; This word is associated with [[Imperialism|political imperialism]], in which a large country creates an empire out of smaller ones. However, media imperialism can be seen as a positive when it is viewed as a way to create a consensus narrative. A consensus narrative is a result of "products that provide us with shared experiences".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By having similar experiences, it opens the gateway for communication and development of relationships. Yet, this can also become a problem when the cultural exchange is not balanced or reciprocated. American culture is being transmitted to other countries, but other cultures may not be{{Weasel inline|date=June 2018}} received in return.

Therefore, this creates an atmosphere of [[cultural imperialism]] where American culture is dominating others and becoming the main one. For example, "...numerous international observers contend that consumers in countries inundated by American-made movies, television, and images have even less control than American consumers."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Attribution needed|reason=Who said this? this needs to be attributed to a specific person|date=December 2017}} Moreover, these forms of mass media channels are not the only ones that have an American feeling to them, the internet also has somewhat of an American appearance.{{Weasel inline|date=June 2018}}

Additionally, media imperialism, in the sense of concentrated ownership, has its own effects within the United States. Many news organizations are owned by a limited number of corporations. One such example is [[Rupert Murdoch]] and his companies' ownership of several notable media outlets, including [[21st Century Fox]] and the [[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other large media corporations consist of [[The Walt Disney Company]] and [[Comcast]]. In 2018, AT&amp;T and Time Warner merged, further concentrating media ownership in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2018/06/12/media/att-time-warner-ruling/index.html|title=Judge approves $85 billion AT&amp;T-Time Warner deal|last=Gold|first=Hadas|date=2018-06-13|work=CNN Media|access-date=2018-06-23|last2=Stelter|first2=Brian|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Italy==
{{main|Media of Italy}}
In Italy, [[Silvio Berlusconi]] operates Italy's top TV stations with the [[Mediaset]] empire, and the public broadcaster [[RAI]] has been subject to political influence.  Media watchdog [[Reporters Without Borders]] has warned of formal political influence in stifling the media.
In April 2013 comedian [[Beppe Grillo]] accelerated the debate within Italy about the independence of media from political interests, releasing poll results showing that out of 95,000 responses 99 percent wanted a public broadcast channel free from political meddling, and 52 percent wanted more investigative journalism about domestic issues.  He wrote in a blog post,  'a part of the Italian population is living in a gigantic [[The Truman Show|Truman show]], and responsibility for this is entirely due to Italian journalists, with the usual few exceptions...RAI has to be reorganized and transformed into a public service following the model of the [[BBC]] without any connection to the parties...'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediapolicy.org|date=April 4, 2013|title=Italy living in Gigantic Truman Show}}{{dead link|date=June 2018|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3533">'''Medium specificity''' is a consideration in [[aesthetics]] and [[art criticism]]. It is most closely associated with [[modernism]], but it predates it.&lt;ref&gt;http://csmt.uchicago.edu/glossary2004/specificity.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Overview==
According to [[Clement Greenberg]], who helped popularize the term, medium specificity holds that "the unique and proper area of competence" for a form of art corresponds with the ability of an artist to manipulate those features that are "unique to the nature" of a particular medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/modernism.html
| title = Modernist Painting
| author = Clement Greenberg
|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060105194921/http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/modernism.html |archivedate = 2006-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in painting, literal flatness and [[Abstract art|abstraction]] are emphasised rather than illusionism and [[figurative art|figuration]].&lt;ref&gt;Vanessa R. Schwartz, Jeannene M. Przyblyski, ''The Nineteenth-Century Visual Culture Reader'', Routledge, 2004, p8. {{ISBN|0-415-30866-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medium specific can be seen to mean that ''"the artwork is constituted by the characteristic qualities of the raw material."'' This would probably include the techniques used to manipulate the materials. ''"Medium-specificity is based on the distinct materiality of artistic media."'' As early as 1776  [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] ''"contends that an artwork, in order to be successful, needs to adhere to the specific stylistic properties of its own medium."''&lt;ref&gt;http://csmt.uchicago.edu/glossary2004/specificity.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the term is used both to describe artistic practices and as a way to analyze [[Visual arts|artwork]].   Critic [[N. Katherine Hayles]], for example, speaks of "media specific analysis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.altx.com/EBR/riposte/rip12/rip12hay.htm

| url = http://www.mala.bc.ca/~soules/animate.htm

Much debate can remain as to what a given medium best lends itself to. 

Art dialogue in the post-modern period has tended to steer away from medium specificity as a particularly relevant principle.&lt;ref&gt;http://csmt.uchicago.edu/glossary2004/specificity.htm Medium Specificity&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4052">'''Monoprinting''' is a form of [[printmaking]] that has lines or images that can only be made once, unlike most printmaking, which allows for multiple originals. There are many techniques of monoprinting. Examples of standard printmaking techniques which can be used to make monoprints include [[lithography]], [[woodcut]], and [[etching]].

== Types ==
A monoprint is a single impression of an image made from a reprintable block. Materials such as metal plates, litho stones or wood blocks are used for etching upon. Rather than printing multiple copies of a single image, only one impression may be produced, either by painting or making a [[collage]] on the block. Etching plates may also be inked in a way that is expressive and unique in the strict sense, in that the image cannot be reproduced exactly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/m/monoprint Definition of monoprinting] Tate Museum online. Retrieved March 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Monoprints may also involve elements that change, where the artist reworks the image in between impressions or after printing so that no two prints are absolutely identical.&lt;ref&gt;[http://washingtonprintmakers.com/resources/techniques/monoprint Photo of monoprinting] Washington Printmakers' Gallery Retrieved March 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Monoprints may include collage, hand-painted additions, and a form of tracing by which thick ink is laid down on a table, paper is placed on top and is then drawn on, transferring the ink onto the paper. Monoprints can also be made by altering the type, color, and pressure of the ink used to create different prints. When you create a monoprint, it is possible to copy work from separate pieces of artwork onto one monoprint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monoprint ink technique|url=https://www.thetbank.com/blog/112-creative-art-project-ideas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monoprints are known as the most painterly method among the printmaking techniques; it is essentially a printed painting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monoprints.com/info/monoprints.html  "What are monoprints and monotypes?"] Monoprints.com Retrieved March 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The characteristic of this method is that no two prints are alike. The beauty of this medium is also in its spontaneity and its combination of printmaking, painting and drawing media.

== Technique ==
Monoprinting and [[monotyping]] are very similar. The difference between monoprinting and monotype printing is that monoprinting has a matrix that can be reused, but not to produce an identical result.  With monotyping there are no permanent marks on the matrix, and at most two impressions (copies) can be obtained. Both involve the transfer of ink from a plate to the paper, canvas, or other surface that will ultimately hold the work of art. In the case of monotyping the plate is a featureless plate. It contains no features that will impart any definition to successive prints. The most common feature would be the etched or engraved line on a metal plate. In the absence of any permanent features on the surface of the plate, all articulation of imagery is dependent on one unique inking, resulting in one unique print. Monoprints, on the other hand, are the results of plates that have permanent features on them. Monoprints can be thought of as variations on a theme, with the theme resulting from some permanent features being found on the plate – lines, textures – that persist from print to print. Variations are confined to those resulting from how the plate is inked prior to each print. The variations are endless, but certain permanent features on the plate will tend to persist from one print to the next.

Monoprinting has been used by many artists, among them [[Georg Baselitz]].  Some [[old master print]]s, like etchings by [[Rembrandt]] with individual manipulation of ink as "surface tone", or hand-painted etchings by [[Degas]] (usually called monotypes) might be classifiable as monoprints, but they are rarely so described.

A '''movement director''' arranges actors' movements in a variety of production settings that include [[theatre]], [[television]], [[film]], [[opera]] and [[animation]]. Movement directors usually work closely with the [[theatre director|director]] and the [[performer]]s, collaborating with the creative team to realise the physical life of a work. They propose a physical language to performers and directors, and devise training methods or teach skills that will help facilitate a specific physical style. The movement director may create, or research and pass on, embodied information about [[etiquette]], [[ethnicities]] (including [[proxemics]], [[gestural]] language, social codes, etc.), a character’s condition (related to medical conditions within their  historical context, and factors such as inebriation, pregnancy, etc.) and personal journey (ageing, etc.), as well as specialist movement (e.g. period dances, dexterity in falling, lifts and [[acrobatics]], animal work, [[Cross-gender acting|cross-gendered performance]]) or chorus work.

Although [[choreography]] is part of a movement directors’ skill-set, this does not mean that every choreographer is also a movement director. There are also important differences between the movement director and the [[fight director]], where although the movement director will engage with the effect of the relevant weapons on posture, movement and emotional state, the [[stage combat|fight choreography]] itself is directed by the specifically qualified fight director. 
Specialist movement consultants may focus on other specific areas (e.g. as in the work on primate movement by the [[puppeteer]] Peter Elliot in ''[[Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes]]'').

==History==

===Movement directors in Britain===

The role described by the title of Movement director today has been in existence since at least the start of the 20th century, although rarely mentioned in programmes or credits. Movement directors often work at a crossover point, shifting between teaching and directing movement for actors, and have also been termed as Movement coach, Theatre choreographer, or Movement support. 
[[Royal National Theatre|The National Theatre]] created the role Head of Movement that was held by Jane Gibson for a period of ten years. [[Glynn MacDonald]] has been the long-standing Master of Movement at [[The Globe Theatre]], underpinning the work of each season and collaborating with visiting movement directors and choreographers. 
2009 saw an important development in the appointment of [[Struan Leslie]] as Head of Movement at the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]]. This was  the only official Head of Movement position within a British theatre company at the time.
Many contemporary Movement directors have established long running relationships with certain companies, with whom they have created a shared body of work and working methodology. These are for example Jane Gibson with [[Cheek by Jowl]], [[Kate Flatt]] and [[Struan Leslie]] with [[Katie Mitchell]] at the National Theatre and [[English National Opera]], and [[Liz Ranken]] with [[Shared Experience]]. 
Other contemporary Movement directors include Michael Ashcroft, [[Peter Darling]], [[Lucy Cullingford]], [[Vanessa Ewan]], [[Lea Hausmann]], Steven Hogget and Scott Graham ([[Frantic Assembly]]), [[Georgina Lamb]], [[Sue Lefton]], [[Ita O'Brien]], [[Liz Ranken]], [[Dennis Sayers]], [[Toby Sedgwick]], [[Ayse Tashkiran]], Sian Williams, Anne Yee, Imogen Knight, Paul Harris, Diane Mitchell, Anna Morrissey, Paul Sadot.

Movement directors today emerge from a rich heritage of movement pedagogues and practitioners. French Director and practitioner [[Jacques Lecoq]], and movement theorist and pedagogue [[Rudolf Laban]] offer important influences. Many of their students and contemporaries became influential teachers of movement and Movement directors in British theatre, often influenced by and interweaving with the lineage of contemporary dance as influenced by Laban, and the heritage of social and cultural dances.
[[Claude Chagrin]], who trained with Jacques Lecoq, was the ‘movement person’ with the National Theatre Company before and while it became permanently resident in Denys Lasdun’s National Theatre Building in 1976.  She was also the first person to be credited for movement, on a production of ''The Royal Hunt of the Sun'' (Dir. Peter Shaffer, 1964).  
[[Michel Saint-Denis]] taught movement in London and was an influential associate director alongside [[Peter Brook]] at the Royal Shakespeare Company from 1962–1966, introducing influences from his work in Paris with his uncle Jacques Copeau.  
Other notable teachers who have shaped British movement work today through a heritage that is passed on from body to body, are [[Trish Arnold]], [[Geraldine Stephenson]], [[Jean Newlove]], [[Litz Pisk]], [[Yat Malmgren]] and [[Belinda Quirey]]. Their work underpins the practice and understanding of contemporary movement practitioners and gives physical life to actors’ performances at Drama Schools and in productions across Britain.

===Contemporary developments===
Movement Directors have sought to be named, in recognition of the existence of their profession, for many decades, and are increasingly gathering recognition. Relevant training for practitioners is now offered through recognized Higher Education degrees focusing on Movement in theatre, such as the MA in Movement studies at The Royal [[Central School of Speech and Drama]], founded by Vanessa Ewan and  Debbie Green in 2004, and now jointly led by Ayse Tashkiran and Vanessa Ewan re titled MA/MFA Movement: Directing and Teaching and the MA in Training Actors Movement, led by [[Wendy Allnutt]] at [[The Guildhall School of Music and Drama]].  Manchester Metropolitan University also offers an MA in Movement Practice for Theatre.  
Movement director and MA/MFA Movement: Directing and Teaching course leader at The Central School of Speech and Drama (CSSD), Ayse Tashkiran, is researching a comprehensive history of movement direction and creating a platform where movement practitioners are able to share their work and facilitate an understanding of their profession by a wider audience.
Industry initiatives to draw out the work of movement directors include the [[Young Vic]] and the [[Royal Shakespeare Company|RSC]] with a variety of workshops, apprenticeships and placements.

==Reception==
The book was received favorably. ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'' magazine reviewer David T. Bazelon said he did not "understand why it has become a bestseller", but all in all "Properly read, it is an occasion for some real understanding of the trial man.  Haphazardly or naively read, it is interesting, instructive, and even exciting."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/my-life-in-court-by-louis-nizer/|title=My Life in Court, by Louis Nizer|last=Bazelon|first=David T.|date=July 1, 1962|website=Commentary Magazine|publisher=|access-date=August 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bazelon challenges praise by [[Max Lerner]] that the work is "one of the great legal autobiographies of our time".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Kirkus reviews gave less praise, calling the book "direct and orderly" and enjoyable by "Trial lawyers, law students, and the general public".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

For the most part, academic and legal reviewers of the autobiography were particularly harsh critics of the book. In ''The Modern Law Review,'' British reviewer C.P. Harvey commented "I cannot help wondering what made Messrs. Heinmann think it would be good business to publish this book in [the United Kingdom]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harvey|first=C. P.|date=January 1, 1963|title=Review of My Life in Court|jstor=1093319|journal=The Modern Law Review|volume=26|issue=2|pages=215–217}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He writes "I pronounce this book to be didactic, long-winded and pretentious" and describes it as an example of "the breadth of the ocean which lies between the English and American legal systems."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the ''[[Osgoode Hall Law Journal]]'', reviewer R. N. Starr described the work as not exactly realistic, and taken to "poetic license".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Starr|first=R. N.|date=April 1963|title=Book Review: My Life in Court, by Louis Nizer|url=http://digitalcommons.osgoode.yorku.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2485&amp;context=ohlj|journal=Osgoode Hall Law Journal|volume=2|issue=4 |access-date=|via=York University Digital Commons}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His review is rather skeptical and mixed; he writes: "For my own part I would have preferred it, had Mr. Nizer put his wide experience to other purposes."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  In the ''Yale Law Review'' Joseph W. Bishop lambasts the piece as demonstrating the decline of legal practice, jury tried cases, and the flaws of the legal profession.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Nonetheless, he describes the book as anything but "dry and indigestable reading" which is usually the case for accounts of legal cases.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Unlike other academic reviewers, ''American Bar Association Journal'' reviewer [[Alfred Schweppe]] praised the book as a "''must'' for every lawyer searching for an answer to success in the courtroom" and the describing the style as "Moving with an easy finished prose".&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Legacy ==
The book has inspired a number of people to become lawyers, including [[Laurie Levenson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/gerry-spence-and-his-fight-against-power/#!|title=Gerry Spence and His Fight Against Power – Los Angeles Review of Books|language=en-US|access-date=August 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nizer's subsequent book ''[[The Jury Returns]]'' follows much the same format and pattern as ''My Life in Court'', attempting to create a similar work and success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meserve|first=Robert W.|date=January 1, 1967|title=Review of THE JURY RETURNS|jstor=25724089|journal=American Bar Association Journal|volume=53|issue=7|pages=648–649}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Naked Maja''' ({{lang-es|La maja desnuda}}) is a [[Philately|philatelic]] name for three [[postage stamp]]s of [[Spain]] of 1930 depicting the ''[[La maja desnuda]]'' painting (1800) by [[Francisco de Goya]] (1746–1828).&lt;ref name="quinta4"/&gt; They are part of a set marking the anniversary of the death of this Spanish artist, and are considered the world's first postage stamp with [[Nude (art)|nudes]].&lt;ref name="scandal"&gt;[http://www.philatelic-postal-club.org/docs/newsletter_apr_2014.pdf "The Nude Maja, Philatelic Scandal"] in ''Newsletter of the International Postal Philatelic Club'', No. 2, April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The complete set includes 32 stamps. 14 of them with denominations between 1 ''[[céntimo]]'' and 5 ''[[Spanish peseta|peseta]]s'' (Scott #386–396 and 400–402), have similar design in different colors—a portrait of Francisco de Goya in his mature years (1826) by [[Vicente López y Portaña]].

The set also included 13 [[airmail stamps]] with [[etching]]s of Goya's ''[[Los caprichos]]'' and ''[[Los disparates]]'' cycles (Scott # C18-30),&lt;ref name="neyhart"&gt;Neyhart, C. [http://www.nwpl.org/documents/may2010.full.pdf "The lesser known Spanish Goya's"] in ''Northwest Philatelic Library Research'', Vol. 6, Issue 12, May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as two other express mail stamps: ordinary (Scott # E7), and air mail (Scott # CE1) stamps overprinted "urgente" ("urgent").

The remaining three highest denominations – dark purple (1 peseta), gray-green (4 pesetas) and red-brown (10 pesetas) (Scott # 397-399) – engraved by [[:es:José Luis López Sánchez-Toda|José Luis López Sánchez-Toda]] reproduce one of the most famous and controversial artist's paintings: ''[[La maja desnuda]]''.

The size of the stamps is 47 × 34&amp;nbsp;mm &lt;!--The Goya portrait ones are 25 × 34 mm--&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filateliatalavera.com/product.aspx?p=24057&amp;t=0&amp;c=12 Filatelia Talavera] 1930. 15 de junio. Quinta de Goya. negro 1705 - 512&lt;/ref&gt; the paper is without watermarks, they have line [[perforation]] 12½. The impression techniques used are [[litography]] (#386-391) and [[chalcography]] (#391-402).&lt;ref name="Oltra2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Guillermo Navarro Oltra|title=Autorretratos del Estado.

== Issue ==
[[File:Espana1930goya2cts.jpg|thumb|upright|{{small|Portrait of Francisco de Goya, 1826 (Scott#387)}}]]
The issue was dedicated to the closure of the [[Ibero-American Exposition of 1929|Ibero-American Exhibition]] in Seville (May 9, 1929 – June 21, 1930) and at the same time to the 100th anniversary of the death of Francisco de Goya.  This is what most [[stamp catalog]]s state, despite the fact that the round anniversary was two years earlier, in 1928,&lt;ref name="stampnews"&gt;Brunstrom, C. [http://issuu.com/dahubbpostal/docs/stampnews_may2011_web "Who was La Maja?"] in ''Stamp News'', May 2011, pp. 64—67.&lt;/ref&gt; and the date is also not the same: the artist died on 16 April, and the set was issued on 15 June.&lt;ref name="quinta3"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1930/06/18/030.html|location=Sevilla|title=Sellos de Goya|page=30|work=[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]]|date=18 June 1930|access-date=1 April 2016|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stamps with naked Maja were privately ordered from the [[London]] printer [[Waterlow and Sons|Waterlow &amp; Sons]],&lt;ref name="quinta4"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1978/08/06/112.html|location=Madrid|title=Goya en los sellos|first1=Luis María|last1=Lorente|page=112|work=[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]]|date=6 August 1978|access-date=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the Spanish governmental mail service ([[Correos]]) recognized this issue as legitimate in exchange for a part of the circulation. The stated purpose of its distribution was to recoup construction costs of the Quinta de Goya (literally "Goya's country house"),&lt;ref name="manta" /&gt; exhibition hall entirely devoted to the works of the Spaniard, where some of his paintings and etchings were placed.&lt;ref name="quinta"&gt;{{cite journal|title=La quinta de Goya (Pabellon Citroen)|first1=José María|last1=Cabeza Méndez|journal=Aparejadores: boletín del Colegio Oficial de Aparejadores y Arquitectos Técnicos de Sevilla|issn=1695-8934|number=40|year=1992|pages=13–16|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="quinta2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/sevilla/abc.sevilla/1988/08/28/030.html|location=Sevilla|title=La Quinta de Goya en la Exposición Iberoamericana|page=30|work=[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]]|last1=Ayza|first1=Román|date=28 August 1988|access-date=1 April 2016|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The set had a nominal value deliberately inflated in comparison to conventional postal rates (it was sold for the equivalent of US$5 at the time). The stamps went on sale on June 15, 1930 and were cancelled by four different types of postmarks. They were valid for the payment of postal services only for three days, until June 17,&lt;ref name="manta"&gt;Manta, V. "[http://www.artonstamps.org/goya.htm The Clothed and The Naked Maja by Goya]". Artonstamps.org, March 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; so they are rare cancelled, and most cancellations are forgeries of a later time, some of them contain an error ("CUINTA GOYA" instead of "QUINTA GOYA").

Information about the circulation sold during the three days vary. According to a New York newspaper, ''The Brooklyn Daily Eagle'' for August 1, 1930, 29,000 stamps of the first issue featuring the nude Maja, of all three denominations, were sold in total.&lt;ref name="brooklyn"&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/58061739/ "Maybe"]. ''The Brooklyn Daily Eagle'', August 1, 1930. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; According to today's versions, 9,800 10-peseta Majas and 231,000 Majas of the other two denominations (1 peseta and 4 pesetas) were issued.&lt;ref name="manta" /&gt;

== Background ==
Having lost the charm of its "[[Spanish Golden Age|Golden Age]]", economic prosperity, global leadership, and [[Spanish American wars of independence|most of its colonial possessions]], Spain in the 18th-19th centuries was experiencing chronic decline. The political and cultural dominance of its northern neighbor, [[France]], especially telling on the Spanish elite, could not but cause aversion and strive for [[Peninsular War|national liberation]] in the society, and intensified search of national identity as a way out of the crisis.

[[Majo|''Majos'' and their girlfriend ''majas'']] were representatives of fringe urban [[lumpenproletariat]] originating from Spanish provinces,&lt;ref name="Thompson2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Thompson|title=Performing Spanishness: History, Cultural Identity and Censorship in the Theatre of José María Rodríguez Méndez|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XdOo_KolKWQC&amp;pg=PA149|year=2007|publisher=Intellect Books|isbn=978-1-84150-134-5|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; and played a catalytic role in the public debate and turned their lower status into a way to express their freedom and rejection of afrancesado ('Frenchified', high society and traditional society of that time in general). Both maja men and women wore daggers at their belts, dressed provocatively and foppishly, deliberately behaved themselves arrogantly, were notable for freedom of manners, and sometimes lived on banditry and looting.&lt;ref name="Esdaile2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles J. Esdaile|others=Santiago Jordán (trans.)|title=La quiebra del liberalismo, 1808-1939|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S-PENp55tJoC&amp;pg=PA22|year=2001|publisher=Grupo Planeta (GBS)|isbn=978-84-8432-182-8|page=22|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strong nationalist overtones turned the image of ''maja'', in fact a prostitute, into a cult of passionate and free Spanish woman.&lt;ref name="ParrondoCremades1988"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Juan Carrete Parrondo|author2=Fernándo Checa Cremades|title=El Grabado en España: . Siglos XV al XVIII|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4KgLAQAAMAAJ|date=1 January 1988|publisher=Espasa-Calpe|language=Spanish|isbn=978-84-239-5273-1|page=720}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nobility reinterpreted items of clothing from slums as an organic part of the Spanish national costume. Embodiment of this trend, ''majismo'', became a favorite subject for Francisco Goya; and his painting ''La Maja Desnuda'' was in this sense a culmination. The artist, however, painted his work for a very small elite audience and hardly imagined that his ''Maja'' in less than a century and a half would be available to the general public in hundred thousands of copies.&lt;ref name="clark"&gt;Clark, W. [http://www.cilam.ucr.edu/diagonal/issues/2005/majismo.html "Spain, the Eternal Maja': Goya, Majismo, and the Reinvention of Spanish National Identity in Granados's Goyescas"] in ''University of California, Journal of the Center for Iberian and Latin American Music'', 25 February 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s–1930s, Spain was once again at a crossroads caused by its painful defeat in the [[Spanish–American War]] of 1898, the deepening economic crisis, and [[Nationalisms and regionalisms of Spain|waves of separatism]] and widespread intellectual discussion about the "[[The two Spains|national identity of Spain]]." This pursuit resulted in a deep national division and, later, in a [[Spanish Civil War|bloody civil war]]. The intellectuals of [[Generation of '98]] needed strong and [[Épater la bourgeoisie|shocking]] symbols, means for daring embodiment of the national idea – and ''majismo'' came in handy.&lt;ref name="Esdaile2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="clark" /&gt; ''La maja desnuda'' postage stamps manifested it with a quite obvious underlying message for the Spanish society.

[[File:Espana1930majavestidaessay.jpg|upright=2.0|thumb|center|[[Essay (philately)|An essay]] of unissued postage stamps ''La maja vestida'']]

In his book, ''El arte de grabar el sello'', published in 1969, engraver of the series, José Sánchez-Toda, reproduced an alternative [[Essay (philately)|stamp essay]] prepared by him for issuance and depicting ''La maja vestida'', just in case if ''Correos'' refused to approve the bolder option. Approval of ''La maja vestida'' would have preserved all symbolism of the issue, though such choice would have been less scandalous. The Spanish governmental mail service, however, went all in.&lt;ref name="toda"&gt;Sanchez-Toda, J. ''El arte de grabar el sello''. Barcelona: Emeuve, 1969, pp. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the fact that postage stamps are officially a 'business card' of the issuing country, one of its official media symbols, and therefore sexual motives in their design are traditionally rare&lt;ref name="cochrane"&gt;Cochrane, K. [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/shortcuts/2014/apr/15/homoerotic-artist-tom-of-finland-official-stamp-approval "Homoerotic artist Tom of Finland gets the official stamp of approval]." ''[[The Guardian]]'', 15 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; (and this is especially true for the first half of the 20th century), depicting naked flesh (both female and male) on postage stamps of that time was, strictly speaking, no news.

Images of [[Ancient Greek sculpture|ancient statues]] or their imitations were quite common elements of design of both [[postage stamp]]s and various [[Revenue stamp|fiscal stamps]], vouchers, [[cheque]]s, [[banknote]]s, and [[Security (finance)|securities]], i. e. any government and corporate securities that needed [[security printing]] against [[Counterfeit money|counterfeiting]] using aesthetically acceptable complication of the design. In addition, the stamps of African [[Colonialism|colonies]] often featured [[Negro|African women]] with naked [[breast]]. It was the ''La Maja Desnuda'', however, that became the world's first case of open image of the body of a worldly woman (not a [[Greek mythology|goddess]]) with [[pubic hair]],&lt;ref name="pukas"&gt;Pukas, A. [http://www.express.co.uk/expressyourself/275973/Duchess-of-Alba-The-Royal-Cougar "Duchess of Alba: The Royal Cougar"]. ''[[The Daily Express]]'', 7 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; thus opening a new popular [[Topical stamp collecting|topic in philately]]: [[Nude (art)|nude]].&lt;ref name="scandal" /&gt;

== Response ==

Appearance in 1930 of the ''Maja Desnuda'' series caused a scandal in [[Roman Catholicism in Spain|conservative catholic Spain]].  The purists made loud public protests,&lt;ref name="scandal" /&gt; denouncing the threat to public [[morality]]. According to them, in particular, such stamps would corrupt innocent children who collected stamps.&lt;ref name="children"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jack Child|title=Miniature Messages: The Semiotics and Politics of Latin American Postage Stamps|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w0DMl-sYT8kC&amp;pg=PR60|year=2009|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0-8223-8927-4|page=60|quote=''Loud protests were heard complaining that the 'naked' stamp [of Goya’s ''The Naked Maja''] would corrupt innocent children who collected stamps.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, stamp dealers were displaying the shocking series in their shop windows.&lt;ref name="chicago"&gt;Conrad, H. [http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1979/09/23/page/194/article/stamps "Gay philately, famed nudes: Collecting's sexual facets"], ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', 23 September 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

Republicans actively used these [[Philatelic fakes and forgeries#Government and propaganda forgeries|stamps for political propaganda]] against corruption of [[Decadent movement|decadent]] aristocracy and its monarchist supporters, which accelerated the change of the [[Social order|social system]]:&lt;ref name="mackay"&gt;[[James A.

Meanwhile, the stamp scandal went beyond the Spain itself.  The [[Universal Postal Union]] started receiving protests (and some of them at the national level, which could result in a post war), but these protests, however, were not satisfied.&lt;ref name="scandal" /&gt; ''Time'', one of the leading US magazines of the time, wrote about a wave of indignation worldwide risen due to the issuance of these stamps. The edition explained:&lt;ref name="neyhart"/&gt;

In 1952, [[Ostende]] police (Belgium) confiscated ''La maja desnuda'' stamps from the shop window of a local [[stamp dealer]] as "immoral.".&lt;ref name="toledo"&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&amp;dat=19521123&amp;id=w_lOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pAAEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5604,4009268&amp;hl=ru "Display Of Stamps Termed 'Immoral'"]. ''Toledo Blade'', November 1952.&lt;/ref&gt; Renown US humorist and columnist for ''[[The New Yorker]]'' [[Frank Sullivan (writer)|Frank Sullivan]] loved to glue them on letters to his friends.&lt;ref name="life"&gt;[https://books.google.ru/books?id=20oEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq=Maja+postage+stamps&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiCzMmhneHJAhWDWywKHXcmA7AQ6AEILzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Maja%20postage%20stamps&amp;f=false "Spanish dukes lose homes but paintings are saved"] in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', Vol. 4, No. 20, 16 May 1938. P. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, postal authorities in various cities of the United States treated the shocking stamps differently: thus, in [[Boston]] in July 1930 they were mutilated in passing through the mails, while at the same time in [[Washington, DC]], according to the press, “they had nothing to do with the stamp designs of other countries.”&lt;ref name="dailyeagle"&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/57395932/ "Stamp nudes create furur among collectors; fear ban"] in ''The Brooklyn Daily Eagle'', 25 July 1930, p.13.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1930, however, the [[U.S. Mail]] has officially banned all mail franked with the ''Majas'' from entering the country. Such mail was barred and apparently returned to senders.&lt;ref name="cochrane" /&gt; However, according to philatelic experts, not a single returned mail is known.&lt;ref name="quesada"&gt;''Eugenio de Quesada'' [http://www.rahf.es/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/La%20leyenda%20de%20la%20maja%20desnuda.pdf La leyenda de "La Maja Desnuda" (Emisión Quinta de Goya, 1930)] in ''Estudios de Afinet'', No. 4, November 2009, pp. 29—41. {{ISBN|978-84-613-5735-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

US authorities made their claims specific in 1958-1959, when a film by [[Henry Koster]] ''[[The Naked Maja]]'' came out co-produced by the USA, Italy and France. For advertising purposes, United Artists Corp. tried then to mail out 2,268 postcards announcing the film and carrying a reproduction of the Goya's painting ''La Maja Desnuda'', but the distribution was halted by the Post Office Department, which held that it violated Sections 1461 and 1463 of Title 18 of the [[United States Code]], forbidding the mailing of "lewd, [[Lascivious behavior|lascivious]] or indecent" matter.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/25/opinion/25iht-oldapril25.html '1959 Goya Work Creates Polemic"] in ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film company's protest stating that the postcards reproduced a painting being publicly displayed in the Prado Museum in Madrid, was, however, rejected. At hearings, the court found that the presence of the ''La Maja Desnuda'' painting in the museum was not a crime, but distribution of such images is "sexy-pandering to a lewd and lascivious interest on the part of the average man."&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; This legal rule is no longer in force in the United States (since 1996).&lt;ref name="timesnewsweekly"&gt;[http://www.timesnewsweekly.com/news/2011-05-05/Editorial "Editorial"] in ''Times Newsweekly'', May 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the scandalous series of 1930 Spanish stamps was immortalized in a novel, ''Hit List'' by [[Lawrence Block]], where the central character Keller described in detail his teenager collector's feelings in relation to its purchase.&lt;ref name="keller"&gt;Block, L. "Hit List", William Morrow, 2000, p. 304. {{ISBN|978-0-06-019833-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In philatelic literature ''La maja desnuda'' of 1930 is considered to be "[t]he best-known sexually related stamp in history, probably."&lt;ref name="chicago" /&gt;

== Subsequent issues ==
In 1958, the Spanish ''La maja desnuda'' stamps were reproduced in the US on one stamp of the 10-stamp set with the most famous paintings of Goya issued for the Day of the Stamp. Another issue, an imperforated block of four stamps with four facsimiles of the 1930 4 pesetas Spanish stamp, albeit in different colors, was issued in the US in 1996.&lt;ref name="manta" /&gt; Both issues, however, were only a private initiative of local philatelic clubs.&lt;ref name="chicago" /&gt;

In addition, Waterlow &amp; Sons reprinted for several times in London all values of the scandalous set from the original printing plates, unloading onto the market circulations ten times exceeding the original circulation, between 1932 and 1969. These [[new print]]s cannot be distinguished from the original stamps, but even so they are still of interest to philatelists.&lt;ref name="manta" /&gt;

All stamps of the set exist in an imperforated form, and as [[line pair]]s and [[Se-tenant (philately)|se-tenant]] stamps without [[Postage stamp separation|perforations]] between the elements, but with external perforation. Some exist in the changed colors (mostly red and blue) as limited edition.&lt;ref name="stampnews" /&gt; It is known that only three imperforates were issued at a price approximately six times higher than normal perforated version in 1930.&lt;ref name="manta" /&gt;

As a result, in 2011 the ''Stamp News'' magazine evaluated three unused La maja desnuda stamps only at $20–30.&lt;ref name="stampnews" /&gt; At the end of 2015, the whole set could be found on the philatelic market for about $50. A complete kit including 'Urgente' overprints (Scott # 386-402, C18-30, CE1, E7) and specimens of all stamps ('muestra' overprints vertically on the left), is altogether valued on specialized philatelic online auctions at $350–400.&lt;ref name="kelleher"&gt;[http://stampauctionnetwork.com/V/v66979.cfm Lot #3961]. — Daniel F. Kelleher Auctions LLC.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the past decades, the ''La Maja Desnuda'' painting by Goya has been repeatedly reproduced by other nations on their postage stamps, including countries with significant religious domination in society: [[Paraguay]], the [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Albania]], etc.&lt;ref name="scandal" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3607">'''Odyssey Works''' is an interdisciplinary performance collective founded by [[Abraham Burickson]] and Matthew Purdon in San Francisco&lt;ref&gt;http://www.radiotania.org/audio.html&lt;/ref&gt; in 2001. The group, composed of artists practicing in various disciplines (writers, composers, designers, actors, performance artists etc.), creates 24hr performances for just one person.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.odysseyworks.org/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The group creates 24-36hr performances for one person audiences. According to the New York Times, "Odyssey Works tends to invite all manner of glancing comparisons: artists like Vito Acconci, Marina Abramović and Aaron Landsman; the interactive [[Punchdrunk]] play “[[Sleep No More (2011 play)|Sleep No More]]”; the notion of relational aesthetics; and the largely European trend of performing theater for one person at a time." &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/arts/design/odyssey-works-makes-art-for-and-about-one-person.html&lt;/ref&gt; The performances, which are site specific and highly participatory,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sfweekly.com/2005-05-18/calendar/artists-without-borders/&lt;/ref&gt; are part of the [[Relational Esthetics|relational aesthetics]] movement in performance and art and find their roots in the [[Situationist International|situationist]] movement of the 1960s and the work of such directors as [[Jerzy Grotowski]] and [[Peter Brook]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jubilat.org/jubilat/archive/20/jubilat_interview/&lt;/ref&gt;

A book about Odyssey Works' ouvre will be published in the Fall of 2016 by [[Princeton Architectural Press]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.papress.com/html/product.details.dna?isbn=9781616895150&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Orchestre symphonique de Québec''' (OSQ; English, Quebec Symphony Orchestra) is a Canadian symphony [[orchestra]] based in [[Quebec City]].  Founded in 1902 as the Société symphonique de Québec, the OSQ is the oldest active Canadian orchestra.  Joseph Vézina was the OSQ's first music director, from 1902 to 1924. In 1942 the orchestra merged with rival orchestra Cercle philharmonique de Québec (founded 1936), at which time it changed its name to the Orchestre Symphonique de Québec.

The orchestra holds an annual competition for young [[Quebec]] musicians awarding monetary prizes as well as the opportunity to perform as a soloist with the orchestra. The orchestra also performs with the Théâtre lyrique du Québec (Théâtre lyrique de Nouvelle-France), the (defunct) Opéra du Québec, the Opéra de Québec, and the Choeur symphonique de Québec.

The most recent Canadian music director of the OSQ was Françoys Bernier from 1966-1968. The most recent music director was [[Yoav Talmi]], from 1998 to 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Arthur Kaptainis | title=There's no shortage of Canadian talent to succeed Talmi as musical director of Quebec City orchestra | url=http://www2.canada.com/montrealgazette/columnists/story.html?id=40a6b362-8608-43d4-a6d4-adeb32b95ce3 | work=Montreal Gazette | date=3 April 2010 | accessdate=2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 2011, the OSQ announced the appointment of Fabien Gabel as its 11th music director, as of the 2012-2013 season, with an initial contract of 4 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.osq.org/media/146994/osq-communiqu__nouveauchef_vfinal.pdf | title=L'Orchestre symphonique de Québec accueille son nouveau directeur musical: Fabien Gabel | publisher=Orchestre Symphonique de Québec | date=1 December 2011 | accessdate=2012-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:US-CopyrightOffice-Seal.svg|thumb|Seal of the United States Copyright Office]]

An [[orphan work]] is a [[copyright]]ed work whose owner is impossible to identify or contact.&lt;ref name=orph-pdf/&gt; This inability to request permission from the copyright owner often means orphan works cannot be used in new works nor digitized, except when [[fair use]] exceptions apply. Until recently, public libraries could not distribute orphaned books without risking being fined up to $150,000 if the owner of the copyright were to come forward.&lt;ref name=varian&gt;{{cite web|last=Varian|first=Hal|title=Copyrights That No One Knows About Don't Help Anyone|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/business/31scene.html|work=New York Times|accessdate=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This problem was addressed in the 2011 case [[Google Book Search Settlement Agreement|''Authors Guild et al. v. Google'']].

==History==
The [[orphan works]] problem arose in the United States from the [[Copyright Act of 1976]], which eliminated the need to register copyrighted works.  Instead, according to {{UnitedStatesCode|17|102}}, all "original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression"&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; are automatically granted copyright protection. This Act made obtaining and maintaining copyright protection substantially easier than the previous [[Copyright Act of 1909]]. It also made unnecessary any central recording system to track and identify copyright-holders, but also made it difficult to find or contact the creator of a copyrighted work if the person or organization was not readily known. Thus, any use of the orphaned work outside of what is permitted as [[fair use]] is potentially a violation of copyright. Potential users of orphaned works are often not willing to take on that risk of copyright violation, so they may individually investigate the copyright status of each work they plan to use.&lt;ref name=varian /&gt;

To some, this scenario is not in the public interest; it limits works that are available to the public. It also discourages the creation of new works that incorporate existing works. Creators who want to use an orphan work are often unwilling to do so for fear that they will have to pay a huge amount of money in damages if the owner ever appears; the risk of additional liability or litigation may be too high. This makes the work of historians, archivists, artists, scholars, and publishers at times more difficult and costly than necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Orphan Works|url=http://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/orphanworks.html|work=Center for the Study of the Public Domain|publisher=Duke University}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The issue arises in Wikipedia, where the copyright owner of a photo that would have illustrated an article may be unknown.

Libraries and archives do have limited privileges to make copies of certain orphan works under section H of {{UnitedStatesCode|17|108}}.

==2006 study by US Copyright Office==
In January 2006, the [[United States Copyright Office]] released a report on orphan works.&lt;ref name=orph-pdf/&gt;  This report was the culmination of a year-long study conducted by the office, based on open forums from the public to collect input.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Keeley|first=Joe|title=Efforts by the U.S. Copyright Office|url=http://www.orphanworks.net/History/History/CopyrightOffice.html|work=OrphanWorks.net|accessdate=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In it, the Copyright Office states that new legislation is desperately needed to address the orphan works problem. The report proposed that if a nonprofit organization such as a library used an orphan work and the copyright owner came forward, then the library would be exempt from huge copyright infringement fines as long as it stopped using the orphan work right away. Commercial uses of an orphan work in which the owner came forward would only be charged a "reasonable compensation"&lt;ref name=orph-pdf&gt;{{cite web|last=United States Copyright Office|date=2006|title=Report on Orphan Works|url=http://www.copyright.gov/orphan/orphan-report.pdf|publisher=Register of Copyrights}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the profits, and use of the work would be allowed to continue.&lt;ref name=chronicle&gt;{{cite web|last=Foster|first=Andrea|title=Copyright Office Sides With Publishers in Proposal for Handling 'Orphan' Works|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Copyright-Office-Sides-With/4407|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education|accessdate=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Office's proposed solution is thought to have favored publishers, and disfavored archivists and scholars.&lt;ref name=chronicle/&gt;

==Orphan works legislation==
Beginning in May 2006, various legislative bills have been introduced in [[United States Congress|Congress]] aimed at addressing the issue of orphan works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Copyright: Orphan Works| publisher = American Library Association | date = August 2006| url = http://www.ala.org/ala/washoff/WOissues/copyrightb/orphanworks/orphanworks.htm#house22may
| accessdate = 2006-11-28 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061125173819/http://www.ala.org/ala/washoff/WOissues/copyrightb/orphanworks/orphanworks.htm#house22may &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016, Congress has not yet passed any legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = United States Copyright Office| url = http://www.copyright.gov/orphan/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the Music Modernization Act established a framework for orphan work sound recordings to be used: the user must submit the orphan work to the [[United States Copyright Office]], at which point any copyright holder will be given 90 days to come forward and object to its use. If no rights holder emerges, or if the user successfully establishes the use is a noncommercial [[fair use]] of the recording, the recording may be used freely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/09/new-music-modernization-act-has-major-fix-older-recordings-will-belong-public|title=The New Music Modernization Act Has a Major Fix: Older Recordings Will Belong to the Public, Orphan Recordings Will Be Heard Again|first=Mitch|last=Stoltz|date=19 September 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attempts to make orphan works available==
The [[University of Michigan]] (UM) is leading the HathiTrust orphan works project,&lt;ref&gt;[http://orphanworks.hathitrust.org/ orphanworks.hathitrust.org]&lt;/ref&gt; an initiative to make orphan works published between 1923 and 1963 on [[HathiTrust]] available to the UM community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HathiTrust Orphan Works Project Grows as University of California, Others Join Up|work=Library Journal|author=David Rapp|url=http://www.libraryjournal.com/lj/community/academiclibraries/891836-419/hathitrust_orphan_works_project_grows.html.csp|accessdate=12 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the project was put on hold as of September 2011 in the wake of a lawsuit filed against HathiTrust, UM, and four other member universities by the Authors Guild, Australian and Canadian authors' organizations, and eight authors to stop them from "reproducing, distributing and/or displaying" copyrighted works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University of Michigan Puts HathiTrust Orphan Works Project on Hold|author=David Rapp|url=http://www.libraryjournal.com/lj/home/892061-264/university_of_michigan_puts_hathitrust.html.csp|work=Library Journal|accessdate=12 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This case was settled in HathiTrust's favor in ''[[Authors Guild, Inc. v. HathiTrust]]'' on January 6, 2015.

The [[Internet Archive]] in October 2017 started making available online some orphan works published between 1923 and 1941 included, forming a collection called the "Sonny Bono memorial" (after [[Sonny Bono]], an entertainer and advocate for perpetual copyright for whom the [[Copyright Term Extension Act]] was named).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2017-10-14|title=Books from 1923 to 1941 Now Liberated! |publisher= Internet Archive Blogs |url= https://blog.archive.org/2017/10/10/books-from-1923-to-1941-now-liberated/ |website= blog.archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The effort is made possible by [[17 U.S.C.]] §108(h) when applied according to some actionable criteria proposed by scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Townsend|last1=Gard|last2=Elizabeth|title=Creating a Last Twenty (L20) Collection: Implementing Section 108(H) in Libraries, Archives and Museums|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3049158|date=2017-10-02|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jazzsoc.jpg|thumb|upright|Logo of the ''Oxford University Jazz Society'']]

The '''Oxford University Jazz Society''', also known as '''JazzSoc''', is the focus of [[jazz]] music at the [[University of Oxford]], England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://ousu.org/organisation/7071/ | title=Oxford University Jazz Society | publisher=[[Oxford University Students' Union]] | accessdate=28 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Formerly known as the '''Oxford University Jazz Club''', the society now provides the main arena for student players to interact musically, whilst also encouraging a non-student contingent.

==History==
The music critic [[Peter Gammond]] (born 1925) was involved with the band that formed the original '''Oxford University Jazz Club'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Peter | last=Gammond | authorlink=Peter Gammond | title=One Man's Music | publisher=Wolfe | date=1971 | page=57 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The conductor, composer, and pianist [[:de:Samuel Hogarth|Samuel Hogarth]] has studied the early history of the Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.samhogarth.net/about/ | title=About | first=Samuel | last=Hogarth | accessdate=28 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, the Club held meetings in St Michael's Hall every Saturday at 8&amp;nbsp;pm.{{fact|date=January 2017}} This consisted of two sessions of live Jazz presented by the Club's musicians, a record interlude, and often a recital by a guest soloist. In 1953, the club started to hold its meetings on alternate Fridays in the Green Room of the Kemp Restaurant where the Club's resident band would perform. The writer and documentary maker Tony Cash played clarinet and saxophone in the Club's band and became its President during the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.seh.ox.ac.uk/about-college/tony-cash | title=Tony Cash | publisher=[[St Edmund Hall, Oxford]] | location=UK | accessdate=28 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, there were two different [[jazz club]]s at the University: the larger ''Oxford University Jazz Club'', which met at the [[Carfax, Oxford|Carfax]] Assembly Rooms and had dancing, and the '''OU Modern Jazz Club''' which met in seated venues at the Wheatsheaf Inn on the [[High Street, Oxford|High Street]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/3632639/The-debates-that-yknow-drive-me-mad.html | title=The debates that, y'know, drive me mad | newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | date=30 November 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; founded by the saxophonist, clarinetist and composer [[Bill Ashton (jazz musician)|Bill Ashton]] (born 1936).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| chapter=Ashton, 'Bill' William Michael Allingham | title=Who's Who of British Jazz | edition=2nd | editor-first=John | editor-last=Chilton | editorlink=John Chilton | publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]] | date=2004 | page=11 | isbn=978-0826423894 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The International Who's Who in Popular Music 2002 | editor-first=Andy | editor-last=Gregory | publisher=[[Psychology Press]] | date=2002 | page=18 | isbn=978-1857431612 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The columnist and bass player [[Miles Kington]], then a [[trombonist]], was a musical organiser of the Modern Jazz Club in Trinity Term 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title=OU Modern Jazz Club Membership Card for Trinity Term 1963 |year=1963 | publisher=Oxford University | location=UK }}&lt;/ref&gt; He refused membership of the Club to Nigel Tully, founder of the ''Dark Blues'' band,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.darkbluesmanagement.com/ | title=Dark Blues Management | accessdate=28 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; because of his love of [[Buddy Holly]]'s music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.countrylife.co.uk/country-pursuits/party-planning-41787 | title=Party Planning | journal=[[Country Life (magazine)|Country Life]] | location=UK | date=7 February 2007 | accessdate=28 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Performers in the Michaelmas Term 1962 included Dickie Hawdon(trumpet), Alan and Jimmy Skidmore, and the Fat John Band.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title=OU Modern Jazz Club Membership Card for Michaelmas Term 1962 |year=1962 | publisher=Oxford University | location=UK }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, the OU Jazz Club started the Big Night, initiated by Marcus Wigan on the OU Jazz Club Committee, and hired the entire [[Johnny Dankworth]] Big Band&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mwigan.com/mrw/OU_UK_and_Au_Community_and_Club_Roles.html | title=Oxford University Jazz Club | work=Community roles | publisher=wigan.com | first=Marcus | last=Wigan | accessdate=28 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for what was a significant financial risk, but in the end turned out to be a successful event.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} The controlled capacity of the Carfax Assembly Rooms was strictly observed, and counters were allocated to check people in and out of the dance and performance hall itself during the evening to maintain these numbers. To the regret of the organisers, with a good profit in a queue extending well back through Carfax, the University [[Proctor]]s arrived and stopped any more tickets being sold... nevertheless, the night was a financial success and became an annual institution for as long as the OU Jazz Club continued.This first Big Night was held on 4 February 1963. Shortly after Marcus Wigan presented a large cheque for the Big Night, [[John Dankworth]] gave a talk to the very different Modern Jazz Club (where Wigan was also on the Committee): the Pat Crumly Quartet, the [[Ronnie Ross]] plus Trio and [[Art Themen]] plus the Pat Crumly Quartet all presented.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title=OU Modern Jazz Club Membership Card for the Hilary Term 1963 |year=1963 | publisher=Oxford University | location=UK }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, the OU Jazz Club organised weekly gigs in the first floor of the former Roebuck public house in [[Market Street, Oxford|Market Street]], central [[Oxford]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Robert | last=Nicholson | title=The Shell Weekend Guide to London and the South-East | publisher=R. Nicholson | date=1979 | page=160 | isbn=978-0905522128 }}&lt;/ref&gt; presenting well-known British jazz musicians such as [[Lol Coxhill]], [[Harry Beckett]], [[Alan Skidmore]], [[Don Rendell]], [[Art Themen]], [[Kenny Wheeler]] and [[Barbara Thompson (musician)|Barbara Thompson]] as well as Oxford-based jazz bands including Pat Crumly's 'Edge' and the [[Oxcentrics]].{{fact|date=January 2017}}

After a period of inactivity in the 1980s, in 1994, the OU Modern Jazz Club was reformed as the Jazz Society and is now colloquially known as "'''JazzSoc'''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.jazzsoc.co.uk/ | title=JazzSoc | publisher=Oxford University | location=UK }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1994 and 1997, it hosted a weekly jam session at Po Na Na on [[St Giles', Oxford|St Giles']]; from 1997 to 2004 the session was once again at the Wheatsheaf pub on the [[High Street, Oxford|High Street]], where the jam session regularly attracted an audience of up to 100 students.

In 2004, JazzSoc returned to its original home at the Roebuck, known until 2006 as the 'Market Tavern' (after then it was transformed into a '[[Wagamama]]' restaurant). From 2006 until 2008, JazzSoc took place at the 'Blue Bar' in the cellar of the Cock and Camel pub on [[George Street, Oxford|George Street]]. This has also since transformed into a restaurant and is now owned by [[Jamie Oliver]]. In 2008, the society briefly held its jams at the Purple Turtle bar, before having no fixed venue for a short period during which the jams were held in various college bars on various days, depending on availability. At the end of 2008 the jam eventually settled at the 'Thirst Lodge', before another change in 2009 to Bar Copa in [[George Street, Oxford|George Street]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.copaofoxford.co.uk/ | title=Bar Copa | location=Oxford, UK }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period the weekly event consisted of a set performed by a house band of student musicians before opening the stage for a jam. However, once a term JazzSoc presented a 'spectacular' featuring an internationally renowned jazz act, playing either with their own band or with a local rhythm section. Past spectaculars featured [[Nigel Hitchcock]], [[Soweto Kinch]], [[Julian Arguelles]], and [[Jim Mullen]].

As of October 2013, the jam ran every Tuesday night at The Mad Hatter.{{fact|date=January 2017}} At this time JazzSoc began to host professional acts several times a term, ending the termly 'spectacular' trend. In addition, student bands hosting the jam began to more often be established student ensembles rather than a house band.

==Events==
JazzSoc runs a weekly jam at The Mad Hatter on [[Iffley Road]], Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://groupspaces.com/jazzsoc/ | title=Oxford University Jazz Society | publisher=groupspaces.com | accessdate=28 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The jam typically opens with a house band set featuring either an up-and-coming jazz ensemble, student or otherwise, or a more widely renowned professional artist. The floor is then opened to everyone and anyone with a desire to jam.

Notable performances have included Escape Hatch (Ivo Neame, Andrea Di Biase, Dave Hamblett), Adam Waldmann (of [[MOBO]] winning [[Kairos 4Tet]], Gareth Lockrane, [[David Newton (pianist)|David Newton]], [[Tina May]], the [[BBC Young Musician of the Year|BBC Young Jazz Musician of the Year]] 2014 winner Alex Bone,{{fact|date=January 2017}} and Nigel Price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| url=http://www.jazzjournal.co.uk/magazine/1106/ | title=Preview: Nigel Price hits the road | first=Bruce | last=Lindsay | journal=[[Jazz Journal]] | location=UK | accessdate=28 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

JazzSoc primarily sends information about its events to its members via its Facebook page "JazzSoc – Oxford University"&lt;ref&gt;{{Facebook|OxfordUniversityJazzSociety}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its mailing list, hosted by the Oxford University IT services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~jazzsoc/ | title=Oxford University Jazz Society | publisher=Oxford University | location=UK | accessdate=28 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Persephone''''' is an [[outdoor sculpture]] by artist [[Armand Toussaint]] created c. 1840. The work sits within the center of a pool in [[Holcomb Gardens]] on the grounds of [[Butler University]] in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], [[United States]]. The sculpture depicts the Greek goddess [[Persephone]]. In 1993 the sculpture was examined by the [[Save Outdoor Sculpture!]] program produced by the [[Smithsonian Institution]].&lt;ref name="SIRIS"/&gt;

''Persephone'' depicts the Greek goddess Persephone standing on a [[limestone]] base in the center of a [[concrete]] octagonal pool. The bronze female figure is draped from the waist down. Her left hand is raised and holds a lit torch of bundled twigs. An inscription on the statue base reads on the left statue base:&lt;ref name="SIRIS"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=1993 | title=Persephone, (sculpture). | work=Save Outdoor Sculpture | publisher=Smithsonian Institution | url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;uri=full=3100001~!314175~!0#focus | accessdate= 4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

:AD TOUSSAINT
:SCULPTEUR

The right side of the base is inscribed:

:GRAUX-MARLY
:FABT DE BRONZES

The front of the base is inscribed just before a 1950 founders mark:
:PERSEPHONE
:IN ANCIENT GREEK MYTHOLO-
:GY, SHE, AS THE DAUGHTER
:OF ZEUS AND DEMETER, WAS
:WORSHIPPED AS THE GODDESS
:OF VEGETATION, RETURNING
:EACH SPRING FROM THE REALM
:OF HADES TO HERALD THE

:WINTER DISAPPEARING TO PASS

:UNDER THE EARTH. THE STATUE
:WAS EXECUTED IN PARIS ABOUT
:1840 BY ARMAND TOUSSAINT,
:1806-1862. A GIFT OF JAMES
:IRVING HOLCOMB&lt;ref name="SIRIS"/&gt;

==Acquisition==

The sculpture was made in France and was originally located at the Swift estate in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. It was purchased by [[J. I. Holcomb]] in 1950&lt;ref name="ORourke"&gt;{{cite web | author=Caitlin O'Rourke | year=2011 | title=Stop and smell the flowers | work=Arts &amp; Entertainment | publisher=The Butler Collegian | url=http://thebutlercollegian.com/2011/09/stop-smell-flowers/ | accessdate=4 November 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402213533/http://thebutlercollegian.com/2011/09/stop-smell-flowers/ | archivedate=2 April 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and installed at the gardens.&lt;ref name="SIRIS"/&gt; 

==Creation==

The piece, made in France, was created primarily crafted by sculptor Armand Toussaint and cast by Graux-Marly. Upon its placement at Holcomb Gardens, the landscapers were J.I. Holcomb and Arthur Lindberg.&lt;ref name="SIRIS"/&gt; 

==Condition==

In 1993 ''Persephone'' was surveyed for the [[Save Outdoor Sculpture!]] survey on behalf of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. The condition of the sculpture, at that time, was described as "treatment needed."&lt;ref name="SIRIS"/&gt; 

==Information==

The sculpture of the Greek goddess is meant to represent Persephone coming back from the underworld every spring to make the flowers and plants bloom.&lt;ref name="ORourke"/&gt; In Fall 2011 a mural in the Johnson Room in Robertson Hall on the Butler campus was created. The 2,120 square-foot mural depicts notable landmarks at Butler, including ''Persephone''.&lt;ref name="Johnson1"&gt;{{cite web | author=Marc Allan | year=2011 | title=The Johnson Room Gets a New Name And A New Look| work=Campus News | publisher=Butler University | url=http://www.butler.edu/absolutenm/templates/?a=3083&amp;z=22 | accessdate= 4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, students dressed the statue in a bra, referencing the infamous "I dreamed I... in my Maidenform bra" campaign.&lt;ref&gt;"Humoresque," ''Maidenform Mirror.'' May-June 1962. Maidenform Collection at the Archives Center, Smithsonian National Museum of American History. Box 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Prince Eugen Medal''' ({{lang-sv|Prins Eugen-medaljen}}), is a [[medal]] conferred by the [[King of Sweden]] for "outstanding artistic achievement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royalcourt.se/royalcourt/monarchy/medals/theprinceeugenmedal.4.396160511584257f2180005002.html |publisher=[[Royal Court of Sweden]] |title=The Prince Eugen Medal |access-date=13 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The medal was established in 1945 by the then King of Sweden, [[Gustaf V]], in connection with the eightieth birthday of his brother [[Prince Eugen, Duke of Närke|Prince Eugen]] who was a noted painter and art collector.

It is awarded every year on 5 November, the [[Name days in Sweden|name day]] of [[Eugen]], and presented to the winners at the Royal Palace in Stockholm.

The '''property master''', often called the '''prop(s) master''', is an [[artistic]] and organizational employee in a [[film]], [[television]] or [[theatrical]] production who is responsible for purchasing, acquiring, manufacturing, properly placing, and/or overseeing any [[Theatrical property|prop]]s needed for a production. The property master also works with other members of the production managing the physical appearance of the [[Stage_(theatre)|stage]] or [[Film_set|set]], for example they might work with the [[script supervisor]] to maintain set [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]]. The property master is on staff during preproduction, develops the stylistic concept of the physical production, then continues on as a member of the physical shooting/production crew.&lt;ref&gt;[https://theatre.barnard.edu/sites/default/files/inline/props_master_0.pdf barnard.edu, Barnard College Department of Theatre, Production Crew Job Descriptions]&lt;/ref&gt; A person responsible for purchasing the props can be called a '''props buyer''' or '''production buyer'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/academy/articles/art20130702112135897 Profile: props buyer – BBC]&lt;/ref&gt;

During preproduction, the props master develops a props breakdown. This is essentially mapping out the logical progression of each prop throughout the story. During shooting, the props master maintains the logical progression by ensuring the props are positioned in their correct logical place for each scene according to the props breakdown. If the logical progression of a prop changes during shooting, the props breakdown is revised to reflect the change.&lt;ref&gt;http://filmtvcareers.about.com/od/basics/p/CP_PropMaster.htm 
Prop Master, By Phil Breman, Film/TV Careers Expert&lt;/ref&gt;

This job description varies somewhat from country to country. In the United States, [[food styling]], weapons and animals are often directly or indirectly within the property master's domain.

The job is a collaboration with the [[Film director|director]], [[production designer]], [[cameraman]], [[set decorator]] and other members of the production to physically express their stylistic and [[aesthetic]] requirements. They maintain their own budget. There are physical aspects of productions that are managed by specialists other than the property master, for example [[costume designer]]s are responsible for the actors' dress, and [[weapons master]]s are responsible for any weapons (firearms, blades, staff-based or otherwise).

In professional theatre, the property master is responsible for the setup and organization of the props.
Property master is directed by the director.

'''''Skittle Players outside an Inn''''' is an oil on oak panel painting by the Dutch artist [[Jan Steen]], probably painted between 1660 and 1663 during his time in [[Haarlem]]. It depicts the playing of a [[Skittles (sport)|skittles]] game, and is now in the [[National Gallery, London]], to which it was bequeathed in 1910 by [[George Salting]].

'''''The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show''''', sometimes called '''''The Burns and Allen Show''''', is a half-hour television series broadcast from 1950 to 1958 on [[CBS]]. It stars [[George Burns]] and [[Gracie Allen]], one of the most enduring acts in entertainment history. [[Burns and Allen]] were headliners in [[vaudeville]] in the 1920s, and radio stars in the 1930s and 1940s. Their situation comedy TV series received [[Emmy Award]] nominations throughout its eight-year run.

==Production==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2015}}
A  half-hour TV series broadcast October 12, 1950&amp;nbsp;– September 22, 1958, on [[CBS]], ''The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show'' was initially staged live and broadcast every other Thursday at 8 pm ET. In fall 1952, it became a weekly series filmed on the West Coast. From March 1953 through September 1958, ''The Burns and Allen Show'' aired Mondays at 8 pm ET.&lt;ref name="Brooks"&gt;Brooks, Tim, and Earle Marsh, ''[[The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows 1946–Present|The Directory to Prime Time Network TV Shows 1946–Present]]''. New York: Ballantine Books, 1988 (fourth edition); {{ISBN|0-345-35610-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|280–281}}

The show was an immediate success.&lt;ref name="NYT GA obit"&gt;"Gracie Allen Dead; Comedianne Was 58". ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 29, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; Six episodes were produced live from the [[Brooks Atkinson Theatre|Mansfield Theatre]] in New York, with the stage set as the Burns's living room. The show relocated to the [[CBS Columbia Square]] facilities in Hollywood beginning with the seventh episode.&lt;ref name="Irvin"&gt;Irvin, Richard, ''George Burns Television Productions: The Series and Pilots, 1950–1981''. [[Jefferson, North Carolina]]: [[McFarland &amp; Company|McFarland &amp; Company Inc., Publishers]], 2014. {{ISBN|9780786494866}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|20–21}}

Ever the businessman, Burns realized it would be more efficient to do the series on film; the half-hour episodes could then be syndicated. From that point on, the show was filmed at General Service Studios without a live audience present; however, each installment was screened before an audience to provide live responses prior to the episodes being broadcast. With 291 episodes, the show had a long network run through 1958 and continued in syndicated reruns for years.

The sets were designed to look like the couple's real-life residence. An establishing shot of the actual house on Maple Drive in [[Beverly Hills, California]], was often used. Although extensively remodeled, that house still exists today—including the study over the garage where George would "escape" from Gracie's illogical logic. Burns lived in the house until his death in 1996, at the age of 100.

One [[running gag]] of the TV show involved a closet full of hats belonging to various visitors to the Burns household, who would slip out the door unnoticed and leave their hats behind rather than face another round with Gracie. The format had George watching all the action (standing outside the [[proscenium]] arch in early live episodes; watching the show on TV in his study towards the end of the series) and breaking the [[4th wall|fourth wall]] by commenting upon it to the viewers. Another running gag was George's weekly "firing" of announcer [[Harry Von Zell]] after he turned up aiding, abetting, or otherwise not stopping the mayhem prompted by Gracie's illogical logic.

[[File:Burns and Allen 1953.JPG|left|thumb|300px|Burns and Allen in 1953]]

During the course of the eight-year run, the TV show had remarkable consistency in its cast and crew.  The episodes were produced and directed by [[Ralph Levy]] (1950–53); [[Fred DeCordova|Frederick de Cordova]], later director of NBC's ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' (1953–56); and [[Rod Amateau]] (1956–58). The original writing staff consisted of Sid Dorfman, Harvey Helm, [[Paul Henning]], and William Burns (George's brother). Later writers included Nate Monaster, Jesse Goldstein, Norman Paul, and Keith Fowler. The associate producer was Al Simon, the director of photography was [[Philip Tannura]], A.S.C., and the editor was Larry Heath. The show's primary sponsor was [[Carnation Evaporated Milk]], later alternating with [[B.F. Goodrich Company|B.F. Goodrich]] (1952–55, 1956–57), and [[General Mills]], for [[Betty Crocker]] (1955–56, 1957–58).

[[Bea Benaderet]] carried over from the ''[[Burns and Allen]]'' radio show, portraying neighbor Blanche Morton, but over the course of the series, four different actors played her husband. The character's first name was "Harry", the same first name as the real-life announcer [[Harry Von Zell]], requiring the writers to craft dialogue that would distinguish the two characters' names. Blanche's husband Harry Morton was first portrayed by [[Hal March]] (October–December 1950), then [[John Brown (actor)|John Brown]] (January–June 1951), and after that, [[Fred Clark]], until 1953 and Larry Keating until 1958. In one episode, "Morton Buys Iron Deer/Gracie Thinks George Needs Glasses", George walks on-stage and freezes the scene just before Harry's entrance and explains that Clark has left the show to perform on [[Broadway show|Broadway]]. He introduces [[Larry Keating]], who enters, and then calls over Bea Benaderet to introduce the two saying, "This is Larry Keating and he is going to be your husband now". The pair greet and chat briefly, complimenting each other on their previous work. George remarks that if they are going to be so nice to each other, no one will believe they are married. Burns then gives a cue, Blanche resumes her position, and the scene continues where it stopped as if nothing had happened. The new Harry enters and Blanche hits him in the head with a catalog for spending $200 to buy an iron deer.

Also appearing in the TV series were Burns and Allen's two children. [[Ronnie Burns (actor)|Ronnie]], adopted in 1935, and Sandra, adopted the year before,&lt;ref&gt;"Burns and Allen Adopt Boy". ''The New York Times'', September 28, 1935.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Life"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a1MEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA87&amp;lpg=PA87&amp;dq=Life+magazine+Gracie+Ends+Act+with+George&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fHFosZcTLQ&amp;sig=D9T8CuTQt_zDADJ0YUpxfX7fIIM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=59ZgVKLABoepyQTM9IKYDw&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Life%20magazine%20Gracie%20Ends%20Act%20with%20George&amp;f=false|title=Gracie Ends Act with George|publisher=''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]''|date=September 22, 1958|pages=88–93|accessdate=2014-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; first appeared in the third-season episode, "Uncle Clyde Comes to Visit" (January 1, 1953), playing themselves. The teenagers are in the Burns living room, threading a [[16&amp;nbsp;mm film|16&amp;nbsp;mm]] projector with that night's episode. In voiceover, George introduces them, and tells the audience that they have been away at school and that is why we have not met them before. Ronnie made a guest appearance on the episode, "Gracie Gives Wedding in Payment of a Favor" (October 18, 1954), playing a character named Jim Goodwin, and was introduced to the audience at the episode's conclusion. Ronnie joined the regular cast October 10, 1955,&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Val, "News of Television", ''The New York Times'', September 25, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; playing himself, but cast as a young drama student who tended to look askance at his parents' comedy style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0122863|title=Ronnie Burns profile|publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=2014-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their daughter, Sandra, declined becoming a regular member of the cast, although she appeared in a few episodes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1567506|title=Sandra Burns profile|publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=2014-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a classmate of Ronnie. In one episode, Ronnie's drama class puts on a vaudeville show to raise funds for the school. Gracie hosts the show while Ronnie and Sandy deliver an impersonation of their famous parents along with one of their classic routines. Since Ronnie played himself, Gracie closed the segment with a wisecrack: "The boy was produced by Burns and Allen."

Starting in the fall of 1955, Burns and Allen often reappeared after the end of the episode, before a curtain decorated with the names and locations of the various theaters where they headlined in their vaudeville days. They would perform one of their signature "double routines", often discussing one of Gracie's fictional relatives (including "Death Valley Allen" the prospector, "Florence Allen" the nurse, "Casey Allen" the railroad man). Burns always ended the show with, "Say goodnight, Gracie", to which Allen simply replied, "Goodnight." She never said, "Goodnight, Gracie", as legend has it. Burns was once asked this question and said it would have been a funny line. Asked why he did not do it, Burns replied, "Incredibly enough, no one ever thought of it."{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

In March 1953, ''The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show'' joined ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' as part of the CBS Monday-night [[primetime]] lineup. As a result, the show entered the top 30 television programs in the [[Nielsen ratings]] ranking at number 20. For the 1954–1955 season, it ranked number 26, and for both the 1955–56 and 1956–57 seasons it was number 28.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

With ''I Love Lucy'' ending its six-year run on CBS in the spring of 1957, the television network wanted to renew the Burns and Allen series, but by this time, Allen had grown tired of performing. Nevertheless, Burns committed both of them for another year, which would be their eighth—and last—on television.&lt;ref name="Gracie Love Story"/&gt;{{Rp|274}}

Allen announced her retirement on February 17, 1958, to be effective at the end of the current season.&lt;ref name="Gracie Love Story"&gt;[[George Burns|Burns, George]], ''Gracie: A Love Story''. New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1988. {{ISBN|0399133844}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|275}}

[[File:Gbgallen.jpg|right|thumb|300px|"It really was her last scene, the last time she appeared on a stage", Burns wrote of the episode filmed June 4, 1958.&lt;ref name="Gracie Love Story"/&gt;{{Rp|279}}]]

Burns and Allen filmed their last show on June 4, 1958.&lt;ref name="LAT GB obit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-03-10/news/mn-45422_1_george-burns |title=George Burns, Comedy's Elder Statesman, Dies |publisher=Oliver, Myrna, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', March 10, 1996 |accessdate=2014-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|3}} The filming was an emotional experience, although nothing was said about it being Allen's last performance. At the wrap party, Allen took a token sip of champagne from a paper cup, hugged her friend and co-star Bea Benaderet, and said "Okay, that's it." After a brief last look around the set, she said, "And thank you very much, everyone."&lt;ref name="Gracie Love Story"/&gt;{{Rp|279–280}}

"She deserved a rest," Burns said when Allen devoted herself to gardening and being a housewife:&lt;blockquote&gt;She had been working all her life, and her lines were the toughest in the world to do. They didn't make sense, so she had to memorize every word. It took a real actress. Every spare moment—in bed, under the hair dryer—had to be spent in learning lines. Do you wonder that she's happy to be rid of it?&lt;ref name="NYT GA obit"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Burns attempted to continue the show with the same supporting cast but without Allen. ''[[The George Burns Show]]'' lasted one season (October 21, 1958&amp;nbsp;– April 14, 1959) on [[NBC]].&lt;ref name="Brooks"/&gt;{{Rp|281}}

Following a mild heart attack in the 1950s,&lt;ref name="Gracie Love Story"/&gt;{{Rp|21}} Allen suffered a series of angina episodes over a number of years.&lt;ref name="Gracie Love Story"/&gt;{{Rp|284, 307}} She had a major heart attack in 1961.&lt;ref name="Gracie Love Story"/&gt;{{Rp|289, 310}} She lived a slower but comfortable retirement for another three years, often appearing in public with her husband, but never performing. Gracie Allen died August 27, 1964,&lt;ref name="NYT GA obit"/&gt; as Burns was underway with his short-lived [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom, ''[[Wendy and Me]]'', with [[Connie Stevens]] and a cast including [[Ron Harper (actor)|Ron Harper]], [[James T. Callahan]], and [[J. Pat O'Malley]]. All the TV shows were produced under the banner of McCadden Productions, a company run by George Burns which he named after the street on which his brother William lived.&lt;ref name="Gracie Love Story"/&gt;{{Rp|293}} McCadden also produced the iconic TV show, ''[[Mister Ed]]''.&lt;ref name="Gracie Love Story"/&gt;{{Rp|294}} The McCadden catalog is owned by [[Sony Pictures Television]].

'''"The Magician’s Tea-Party'''" is a fairytale written by British suffragist and author [[Evelyn Sharp (suffragist)|Evelyn Sharp]] in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, Evelyn. “The Magician’s Tea-Party.” The Project Gutenberg EBook of The Other Side of the Sun. Ebook 40573. The Project Gutenberg, August 2012. Web. https://www.gutenberg.org/files/40573/40573-h/40573-h.htm#  (accessed February 12, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summary ==
The story starts with little [[monarch|King]] Wistful, the eight-year-old king of the Cheerful Isles, or as he renamed them, the Monotonous Isles. The King slips through the gates to go look for something interesting because he finds that his kingdom is the “dullest and ugliest and the most wearisome place in the world.”

The King, now outside, surveys his kingdom, commenting on how stupid his kingdom is, and feeling sorry for himself, then he hears a voice.  The voice is from a little girl singing.  The little girl is singing for the little King Wistful to come and play.

::Sing-song! Don't be long!
::Wistful, Wistful, come and play!
::Sing-song! It's very wrong
::To stay and stay and stay away!
::The world is much too nice a place
::To make you pull so long a face;
::It's full of people being kind,
::And full of flowers for you to find;
::There's heaps of folks for you to tease
::And all the naughtiness you please;
::To sulk is surely waste of time
::When all those trees are yours to climb!
::Ting-a-ring! Make haste, King!
::I've something really nice to say;
::Ting-a-ring! A proper King
::Would not make me sing all day!

When the girl comes into sight the King notices that she has the “brightest brown eyes” that he had ever seen. The little girl introduces herself as Eyebright and when asked where she learned her song, she replies that the [[Magic (paranormal)|magician]] taught her and that she needed to sing it every day until the King came.

The two talk for a time and the King tells Eyebright about how stupid his kingdom is while Eyebright tries to change his mind about it.  Eyebright does not manage to change the little King's mind but does get him to follow her to go to see the Magician. The two children travel to the middle island, through woods and into a boat to get to the Magician’s cave.

The two enter the cave and Eyebright tells the Magician that she brought the King and that he must disenchant the King so that he can see what a wonderful kingdom he has. After shaking hands with the King the Magician invites them to sit with him for tea. The Magician performs some magic for a table and chairs to appear.  The King and Eyebright set the table and the three proceed to have a delightful tea-party.

After tea the children tell the Magician just why they came in the first place.  The Magician tells them that the reason that the King cannot see his kingdom for the wonderful place that it is, was because the wymps threw dust in his eyes as a baby.  The Magician explains why the wymps would do such a thing and tells them where they have to go to try to get the wymps to reverse what they did, Wympland, and how they were to get there.  The Magician then sends the children to Wympland on a flash of lightning.

The King and Eyebright, now in Wympland, look around and find a wymp to talk to.  They to talk with the wymp and the King tells him that the wymps threw dust in his eyes as a child.  The wymp reveals to them that there is only one thing to do; they must exchange eyes, only thing to be done.  The Wymp tells them how to exchange eyes and without hesitation Eyebright switches their eyes.  The King is unhappy about this as he did not want Eyebright to have to see things through his eyes but at this point he has little choice.

The King and Eyebright suddenly appear back home, looking over the kingdom.  The King can now see just how wonderful and beautiful his kingdom is.  Eyebright thought she could only see five round islands in a row, but the King cannot possibly be mistaken so she agrees that it is a beautiful kingdom.  Eyebright then runs off and the King returns home to bed.

The final lines tell of how there is now a Queen as well as a King of the Monotonous Isles.  This Queen always agrees with the King when he tells of how beautiful the kingdom is.  While this may be remarkable it needs to be remembered that “the Queen sees everything with the King's eyes.”&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, Evelyn. “The Magician’s Tea-Party.” The Project Gutenberg EBook of The Other Side of the Sun.

== Author ==

The fairy tale “The Magician’s Tea-Party” was written by Evelyn Sharp as part of a set of fairy tales in her book ''The Other Side of the Sun''.
Evelyn Jane Sharp (1869-1955) was a children’s writer in England.  Evelyn was the ninth of eleven children, and the youngest of four girls.  Her sisters taught her until she was twelve, then she attended a school in London for three years, before attending the College de France in Paris

Evelyn Sharp wrote over twenty books and hundreds of short stories for children.  Her children’s stories are known for treating children as intelligent and creative rather than patronizing and moralistic.  Evelyn also wrote for several newspapers, she was the Manchester Guardians’ first regular women's page writer, she wrote for the Daily Herald for eight years, and wrote for the Daily Chronicle in the 1930s. She became a women’s suffragist in 1906, lecturing and writing towards the goal of women’s suffrage.

Evelyn continued in this manner, writing and various excursions. She then, after claiming she would be expected to settle down into spinsterhood in her autobiography, married her husband, Henry, on January 18, 1933. At this time Evelyn was a sixty-year-old woman and Henry was seventy-five.  The two had eight years together when Henry died in 1941.  Evelyn lived out her remaining years in London, where she died in a nursing home June 17, 1955.&lt;ref&gt;John, Angela V.. “Sharp , Evelyn Jane (1869–1955).” Angela V.

'''Tian-tsui''' (traditional: 點翠, simplified: 点翠, pinyin: diǎncuì, "dotting with kingfishers") is a style of Chinese art featuring [[kingfisher]] feathers. For 2,000 years, the Chinese have been using the iridescent blue feathers of kingfisher birds as an inlay for fine art objects and adornment, from hairpins, headdresses, and fans to panels and screens. While [[Western art]] collectors have focused on other areas of Chinese art including [[porcelain]], [[lacquer]] ware, sculpture, [[cloisonné]], [[silk]] and paintings, kingfisher art is relatively unknown outside of China.

Kingfisher feathers are painstakingly cut and glued onto gilt silver. The effect is like cloisonné, but no enamel was able to rival the electric blue color. Blue is the traditional favorite color in China.

As with most iridescent, electrifying colors in animals such as [[morpho butterfly]] wings, the intense color in bird feathers comes not from pigments in the feather itself, but from the way light is bent and reflected back out, much like a prism breaks white light into its spectrum of rainbow colors. These microscopic structures in feathers are called [[photonic crystals]].

The most expensive, commissioned pieces used a species of kingfisher from [[Cambodia]]. So great was the export to sate Chinese demand, the trade of feathers may have been a major contributor to the wealth of the [[Khmer Empire]], and used to help fund the construction of the magnificent temples near [[Siem Reap]], Cambodia including [[Angkor Wat]]. The finest pieces of kingfisher art were reserved for royalty or high-ranking Chinese government official (called a "[[mandarin (bureaucrat)]]"). The usage of kingfisher feathers resulted in the mass slaughter of many kingfisher species.

Kingfisher art as a high art form came to an end during the [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|Chinese Revolution]] in the 1940s.

[[Toilet paper]] when used with a [[toilet roll holder]] with a horizontal [[axle]] [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to the floor and also parallel to the wall has two possible orientations: the toilet paper may hang ''over'' (in front of) or ''under'' (behind) the roll; if perpendicular to the wall, the two orientations are right-left or near-away. The choice is largely a matter of personal preference, dictated by [[habit (psychology)|habit]]. In surveys of US consumers and of bath and kitchen specialists, 60–70 percent of respondents prefer ''over''.

Some people hold strong opinions on the matter; advice columnist [[Ann Landers]] said that the subject was the most responded to (15,000 letters in 1986) and controversial issue in her column's history. Defenders of either position cite advantages ranging from aesthetics, hospitality, and cleanliness to paper conservation, the ease of detaching individual sheets, and compatibility with setting specifics such as [[recreational vehicle]]s or having pets. Some writers have proposed connections to age, sex, or political philosophy, and survey evidence has shown a correlation with socioeconomic status.&lt;ref&gt;For pros and cons, including RVs and cats, see [[#Arguments|Arguments]]; for celebrities and experts, including Ann Landers, see [[#Noted preferences|Noted preferences]]; for theories, see [[#Themes|Themes]].&lt;/ref&gt;  

Solutions range from compromise, to using separate dispensers or separate bathrooms entirely, or simply ignoring the issue altogether. One man advocates a plan under which his country will standardize on a single forced orientation, and at least one inventor hopes to popularize a new kind of toilet roll holder which swivels from one orientation to the other.&lt;ref&gt;The enthusiast, Bill Jarrett, and the inventor, Curtis Batts, are described in [[#Solutions|Solutions]].&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Motivations for study}}Context and relevance==
In the article "Bathroom Politics: Introducing Students to Sociological Thinking from the Bottom Up",{{sfn|Burns|2003}} [[Eastern Institute of Technology]] [[sociology]] professor Edgar Alan Burns describes some reasons toilet paper politics is worthy of examination. On the first day of Burns' introductory course in sociology, he asks his students, "Which way do you think a roll of toilet paper should hang?"{{sfn|Burns|2003|p=111}} In the following fifty minutes, the students examine why they picked their answers, exploring the [[social construction]] of "rules and practices which they have never consciously thought about before".{{sfn|Burns|2003|p=113}} 

Burns' activity has been adopted by a [[social psychology]] course at the [[University of Notre Dame]], where it is used to illustrate the principles of [[Peter L. Berger|Berger]] and [[Thomas Luckmann|Luckmann]]'s 1966 classic ''[[The Social Construction of Reality]]''.{{sfn|Collett|2008}} 

[[Christopher Peterson (psychologist)|Christopher Peterson]], a professor of psychology at the [[University of Michigan]], classifies the choice of toilet paper orientation under "tastes, preferences, and interests" as opposed to either [[value (personal and cultural)|values]] or "attitudes, traits, norms, and needs". Other personal interests include one's favorite cola or baseball team. Interests are an important part of [[identity (social science)|identity]]; one expects and prefers that different people have different interests, which serves one's "sense of uniqueness". Differences in interests usually lead at most to teasing and gentle chiding. For most people, interests don't cause the serious divisions caused by conflicts of values; a possible exception is what Peterson calls "the 'get a life' folks among us" who elevate interests into moral issues.{{sfn|Peterson|2006|pp=173–175}}

[[Morton Ann Gernsbacher]], a professor of psychology at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], compares the orientation of toilet paper to the orientation of cutlery in a dishwasher, the choice of which drawer in a [[chest of drawers]] to place one's socks, and the order of shampooing one's hair and lathering one's body in the shower. In each choice, there is a prototypical solution chosen by the majority, and it is tempting to offer simplistic explanations of how the minority must be different. She warns that [[neuroimaging]] experiments—which as of 2007 were beginning to probe behaviors from [[mental rotation]] and [[facial expression]]s to grocery shopping and [[tickling]]—must strive to avoid such [[cultural bias]] and [[stereotype]]s.{{sfn|Gernsbacher|2007}}

In his book ''[[Conversational Capital]]'', Bertrand Cesvet gives toilet paper placement as an example of [[ritual]]ized behavior—one of the ways designers and marketers can create a memorable experience around a product that leads to [[word-of-mouth]] momentum. Cesvet's other examples include shaking a box of [[Tic Tac]]s and dissecting [[Oreo]] cookies.{{sfn|Cesvet|Babinski|Alper|2008|p=68}}

Broadcaster [[Jim Bohannon]] has said that such issues are good for [[talk radio]]: "It is an interactive medium, a certain kind of clash, it doesn't have to be a violent clash, but at least a disagreement would certainly be at the top of the list. It has to be something that's of general interest."{{sfn|Voice of America|2004}}

==Arguments for over or under==
[[File:Toilet paper in Hotel Monasterio.jpg|thumb|Folded and sealed toilet paper with cover, [[Hotel Monasterio]] 2009]]
[[File:ToiletPaper Boo WrongWay.jpg|thumb|Paper mounted ''under'' with upside-down images and text]]
The main reasons given by people to explain why they hang their toilet paper a given way are ease of grabbing and habit.{{sfn|Progressive Grocer|2010}} Some particular advantages cited for each orientation include:
* ''Over'' reduces the risk of accidentally brushing the wall or cabinet with one's knuckles, potentially transferring grime and germs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ode|2010}}: "The Kimberly-Clark company cites three advantages for rolling over: perforation control, viewing advantage and wall avoidance."; {{harvnb|Garton|2005}}; {{harvnb|Jarski|Jarski|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Over'' makes it easier to visually locate and to grasp the loose end.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ode|2010}}; {{harvnb|Elliott|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Over'' gives hotels, cruise ships, office buildings, public places and homeowners with guest bathrooms the option [[hotel toilet paper folding|to fold over the last sheet]] to show that the room has been cleaned.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lind|1992}}; "The Grand Princess cruise ship replaces its toilet paper with the leading edge over the front, so that it can be folded as is done in five-star hotels. (Yes, someone really did ask this question.)" {{harv|Carpenter|1999}}; {{harvnb|Rosencrans|1998}}; {{harvnb|Garton|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Over'' is generally the intended direction of viewing for the manufacturer's branding, so patterned toilet paper looks better this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1991b}}; {{harvnb|Garton|2005}}; {{harvnb|Mitchell|Sugar|2005a}}; {{harvnb|Jarski|Jarski|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Under'' provides a tidier appearance, in that the loose end can be more hidden from view.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jarski|Jarski|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Toilet Paper Orientation Re: Brandweek 2009| url=http://plumbersshrewsbury.co.uk/toilet-paper-orientation-brandweek-2009/ |accessdate=2015-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Under'' reduces the risk that a toddler or a house pet, such as a dog or cat, will completely unroll the toilet paper when batting at the roll.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darbo|2007}}; {{harvnb|Garton|2005}}; {{harvnb|O'Connor|2005|p=63}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Under'' in a [[recreational vehicle]] may reduce unrolling during driving.{{sfn|Nerbas|2009}}

Partisans have claimed that each method makes it easier to tear the toilet paper on a [[perforated]] sheet boundary, depending on the direction of pulling and the use of a second hand to stabilize the roll.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ode|2010}}; {{harvnb|Weingarten|2008}}; {{harvnb|Keeran|1993}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (A traveller from the U.S. to China in 1991 noted a different setup: non-perforated paper with a metal cutter above the roll, which obliges the ''over'' direction.){{sfn|Downey|Harrison|1993}}

It is unclear if one orientation is more economical than the other. The ''[[Centralian Advocate]]'' attributes a claim that ''over'' saves on paper usage to [[Planet Green]].{{sfn|McNatt|2010}}

In the academic field of [[evaluation]], [[Michael Scriven]] writes that the question of the correct way to insert toilet paper is a "one-item aptitude test" for measuring one's evaluation skills. These skills include the evaluative attitude, practical logical analysis, empathy, teaching, and being a quick study. To prove one's competence, one may either derive the "one right answer" or prove that the test is or is not culturally biased.{{sfn|Scriven|1991|loc="Evaluation Thesaurus", pp. 151–153, especially p. 153 for the quotations}}

===Survey results===
The question "Do you prefer that your toilet tissue unwinds over or under the spool?" is featured on the cover of Barry Sinrod and Mel Poretz's 1989 book ''The First Really Important Survey of American Habits''. The overall result: 68 percent chose over.{{sfn|Rubin|1989}} Sinrod explained, "To me, the essence of the book is the toilet paper question ... Either people don't care, or they care so much that they practically cause bodily injury to one another."{{sfn|Oldenburg|1989}} Poretz observed, "The toilet-paper question galvanizes people almost like the [[Miller Lite]] tastes-great/less-filling commercial."{{sfn|Mark Wolf Scripps Howard News Service|1990}}

In Bernice Kanner's 1995 book ''Are You Normal?'', 53 percent of survey respondents prefer ''over'', while "a fourth" prefer ''under'' and 8 percent do not know or care.{{sfn|Kanner|1995|pp=56, 120}}

''Sitting Pretty: The History of the Toilet'', a [[travelling exhibition]] that tours Canadian museums, asks visitors to register their preferred roll direction. When the exhibition reached [[Huntsville, Ontario]], in June 2001, 13,000 visitors had taken the survey, with 67 percent preferring ''over''.{{sfn|Ladan|2001}} At the [[Saint Boniface Museum]] in [[Winnipeg]] in February 2005, a voting machine registered 5,831 ''over'' versus 5,679 ''under'', or 51 percent ''over''. Saint Boniface's director noted, "I think there's been some cheating, though."{{sfn|Nestruck|2005}}

[[Georgia-Pacific]] commissioned a survey of Americans' bathroom habits in 1993 to launch its new [[Quilted Northern]] brand, and more surveys followed:&lt;ref&gt;The 1996 report, which may not have contained this question, was the fourth annual report: {{harv|McCarthey|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1993 Practices and Preferences of Toilet Paper Users: 73 percent ''over'' out of 1,200 respondents. The press release claims, "A first-of-its-kind survey has settled, once and for all, the great toilet paper debate."{{sfn|PR Newswire|1993}}
* 1994 Toilet Paper Report: 59 percent ''over'',{{sfn|Ortega|1995}} out of 1,000 respondents; conducted by KRC Research and Consulting{{sfn|Ciancio|1994}}
* 1995 Bathroom Tissue Report: 59 percent ''over'' versus 29 percent ''under'',{{sfn|Ciancio|1995}} out of 1,000 respondents; conducted by KRC Research and Consulting{{sfn|Ortega|1995}}
* 2001 Bathroom Confidential: 63 percent ''over'' out of 1,001 respondents; conducted by Impulse Research{{sfn|Dickson|2001}}
* 2004 Bathroom Confidential: 72 percent ''over''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ebenkamp|2004}}; {{harvnb|Pierson|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, [[American Standard Brands]] conducted a poll of "designers, contractors, dealers, distributors and other bath and kitchen reps"{{sfn|Toronto Star staff and news services|1993}} at the [[Kitchen/Bath Industry Show &amp; Conference]] in [[Atlanta]]. The question: "What is the correct and only way to hang the toilet paper – under or over?"{{sfn|Stark|1993}} ''Over'' won 59 percent of the vote, 1,826 to 1,256.{{sfn|Toronto Star staff and news services|1993}} American Standard spokeswoman Nora Monroe observed, "The bathroom is a territorial place. You'd be surprised how many people have definite opinions on this issue."{{sfn|Clark|1993}} In 2008, American Standard commissioned the 2008 Bathroom Habits Survey, a more traditional format conducted by [[Opinion Research Corporation]] with 1,001 respondents. This time, "three-quarters" answered ''over''.{{sfn|American Standard Press|2008}}

In 1995, a survey by [[Scott Paper Company]]'s "Cottonelle College of Freshness Knowledge" had "most Americans over 50" preferring ''over''.{{sfn|Harden|1995}} In another [[Cottonelle]] survey in 1999, 68 percent of respondents preferred ''over'' to 25 percent ''under''. Columnist Bonnie Henry hypothesizes of the others: "Meanwhile, 7 percent – no doubt bored beyond belief at this point by the inane questioning – had slipped into a deep, irreversible coma."{{sfn|Henry|1999}}

On January 27, 2010, the 100th anniversary of [[Thomas Crapper]]'s death,{{sfn|Progressive Grocer|2010}} Cottonelle launched a "Great Debate" advertising campaign, inviting American consumers to vote their preference at a [[Kimberly-Clark]] website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cottonellerollpoll.com/ CottonelleRollPoll.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The result was announced during the [[82nd Academy Awards]]: 72 percent had voted ''over''.{{sfn|Ode|2010}} In a more traditional preliminary survey of 1,000 Americans, Cottonelle found that "overs" are more likely than "unders" to notice a roll's direction (74 percent), to be annoyed when the direction is incorrect (24 percent), and to have flipped the direction at a friend's home (27 percent).{{sfn|PR Newswire|2010}}

The book does not note the number of respondents in each segment, so it is difficult to say whether any of the deviations are [[statistically significant]], but there does not seem to be a difference between men's and women's preferences. Nonetheless, such a difference has been claimed by other authors, in both directions. The American Standard conference poll concluded: "Many men voted for over, saying it made the paper easier to reach."{{sfn|Clark|1993}} Inventor Curtis Batts arrives at a different conclusion from his personal experience: "Women like it over, and men like it under. I think it bugs women when it touches the wall."{{sfn|Floyd|1999}} Advice columnist Ms Maud of ''[[The Press]]'' asserts that women prefer ''over'' because they are "logical thinkers".{{sfn|Ms Maud|2002}}

A Cottonelle survey indicated that men were more likely than women to notice, and become annoyed with, a toilet roll hung against their preference.{{sfn|Kimberly-Clark|2010}}

A [[popular-culture]] occurrence of a gender theory is found in the ''[[Weekly World News]]'', a [[supermarket tabloid]] that runs outlandish stories for comedic effect. In the 2003 story ''North Korea Shocker!'', the ''WWN'' claimed that North Korean leader [[Kim Jong-il]] was [[Passing (gender)|secretly female]]. As supporting evidence, Kim supposedly watched the [[Home Shopping Network]], is a member of [[Oprah's Book Club]], and "Yells at staffers who leave the toilet seat up and hang toilet paper rolls outward instead of inward."{{sfn|LaForte|2003}}

According to ''W. C. Privy's Original Bathroom Companion, Number 2'', "By more than 4 to 1, older folks prefer to have their toilet paper dispense over the front."{{sfn|Barrett|Mingo|2003|p=400}} The same claim is made by James Buckley's ''The Bathroom Companion'' for people older than 50.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=106}}

====Class and politics====
Sinrod observed of his survey, "60 percent of those who earn $50,000 or more prefer it to be over and 73 percent of those who earn less than $20,000 prefer under".{{sfn|Oldenburg|1989}} On what that proves: "I don't know, but it's sure interesting."{{sfn|Rubin|1989}}

In one [[local election]] in [[Saskatoon, Saskatchewan]], new [[voting machine]]s were given a trial run by asking the question, "Are you in favor of toilet paper in all public washrooms being installed with the loose end coming up and over the front of the roll?" The answer was yes: 768 to 196, or 80 percent ''over''. It was thought to be a question "which carried no political association".{{sfn|Landers|1998}} Yet one teenager's [[science project]] at the Southern Appalachian Science and Engineering Fair, and a favorite of the fair's coordinator, was a survey concluding that [[liberalism|liberals]] roll over while [[conservatism|conservatives]] roll under.{{sfn|Keim|1997}}

===Noted preferences===

Advice columnist [[Ann Landers]] ([[Eppie Lederer]]) was once asked which way toilet paper should hang. She answered ''under'', prompting thousands of letters in protest; she then recommended ''over'', prompting thousands more.{{sfn|Marelius|1987}} She reflected that the 15,000 letters made toilet paper the most controversial issue in her column's 31-year history,{{sfn|Toronto Star|1986}} wondering, "With so many problems in the world, why were thousands of people making an issue of tissue?"{{sfn|Marelius|1987}}

In November 1986, Landers told the [[Canadian Commercial Travellers Association]] that "Fine-quality toilet paper has designs that are right side up" in the ''over'' position.{{sfn|Toronto Star|1986}} In 1996, she explained the issue on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', where 68 percent of the [[studio audience]] favored ''over''; [[Oprah Winfrey|Oprah]] suggested that ''under'' uses more paper.{{sfn|The Oprah Winfrey Show|1996}} In 1998, she wrote that the issue "seems destined to go on forever", insisting, "In spite of the fact that an overwhelming number of people prefer the roll hung so that the paper comes over the top, I still prefer to have the paper hanging close to the wall."{{sfn|Landers|1998}} On the day of her last column in 2002, Landers wrote, "P.S. The toilet paper hangs over the top."{{sfn|Landers|2002}} Her published commentary on the issue has even continued after her death. 2005 saw the premiere of a one-woman play written by [[David Rambo]]: a character study of Ann Landers titled ''The Lady with All the Answers''. Toilet paper comes up once again, and the actress surveys the audience for their opinions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Welsh|2005}}; {{harvnb|Rawson|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his article in ''Teaching Sociology'', Burns writes that the toilet paper hanging exercise is valuable in part because "[the] subject matter is familiar to everybody; everyone is an expert, and everyone has an opinion."{{sfn|Burns|2003|p=116}} Many entertainers, celebrities and businesspeople have publicized their opinion on the topic.

==Social consequences==
Toilet paper orientation is often mentioned as a hurdle for married couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wolf|1999|pp=74–75}}; {{harvnb|Hogan|Hogan|2000|p=200}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The issue may also arise in businesses and public places.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lui|2009}}; {{harvnb|Grant|1991a}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even at the [[Amundsen–Scott Research Station]] at the [[South Pole]], complaints have been raised over which way to install toilet paper. During the six-month-long [[polar night]], a few dozen residents are stuck living together, and while many of the headaches of modern life are far away, food and hygiene are not. Despite the challenges posed by the hostile [[Antarctic climate]], "It is in the more mundane trials of everyday life that personality clashes are revealed."{{sfn|Daily Express|1999|p=39}}

==Solutions==

Some of the proposed solutions to this problem involve more or better technology, while others concentrate on human behavior.

===Mechanical===
The Tilt-A-Roll is a swiveling toilet paper dispenser invented by Curtis Batts in 1996, a [[Dallas]]-native [[industrial engineer]].{{sfn|Floyd|1999}} His patents on the invention, summarize its design as "An adjustable angle coupling secures the yoke to the mounting assembly and permits rotation of the yoke about an axis directed orthogonally through the spindle such that the paper roll can be oriented to unroll paper either from over or from under the roll as desired."&lt;ref&gt;{{patent|US|5588615}} and {{patent|US|5690302}}&lt;/ref&gt; An inventor named Rocky Hutson demonstrated a similar device he called the T.P. Swivel to the producers of the television program ''[[PitchMen]]'' in late 2009. {{sfn|Zayas|2009}}

Another solution is to install two toilet paper dispensers, as is more common in public restrooms and hotels.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Walsh|1999}}; {{harvnb|Marelius|1987}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A reader of the ''[[Annie's Mailbox]]'' column recommends using a holder large enough to fit two rolls, noting that the roll mounted ''over'' is more popular. Another reader sidesteps the issue by foregoing the holder, instead piling five or six rolls in a big wicker basket.{{sfn|Mitchell|Sugar|2005b}} Even using separate bathrooms can help.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arkins|1994}}; {{harvnb|Jarski|Jarski|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other solutions include vertical holders.

===Behavioral===
Toilet paper orientation has been used rhetorically as the ultimate issue that government has no business dictating, in letters to the editor protesting the regulation of [[noise pollution]]{{sfn|Ratzlaff|2009}} and stricter requirements to get a divorce.{{sfn|Wuthrich|2006}} In 2006, protesting [[New Hampshire]]'s [[List of smoking bans in the United States#New Hampshire|ban on smoking]] in restaurants and bars, representative Ralph Boehm ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]&amp;ndash;[[Litchfield, New Hampshire|Litchfield]]) asked "Will we soon be told which direction the toilet paper must hang from the roll?"{{sfn|Saunders|2006}}

David O'Connor's 2005 book ''Henderson's House Rules: The Official Guide to Replacing the Toilet Paper and Other Domestic Topics of Great Dispute'' aims to solve disagreements with a minimum of debate or compromise by offering authoritative, reasonable rules.{{sfn|O'Connor|2005|pp=2–3}} The "House Rule" for toilet paper is ''over and out'', and a full page is dedicated to a diagram of this orientation. But O'Connor writes that "if a female household member has a strong preference for the toilet paper to hang over and in, against the wall, that preference prevails. It is admittedly an odd preference, but women use toilet paper far more often than men—hence the rule."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Connor|2005|pp=63–64}}; {{harvnb|Davis|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48673">'''Unlimited''' is a commissioning programme that celebrates the work of deaf and disabled artists, originally conceived for by [[Arts Council England]] for the London [[2012 Cultural Olympiad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/what-we-do/our-priorities-2011-15/london-2012/unlimited/|website=Arts Council England|accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its inception, the programme represents a multi-million pound investment which to date has commissioned more than 70 pieces of work across theatre, dance, visual art, music, literature, film, poetry and performance art. Several Unlimited-commissioned pieces have gone on to have a global reach, such as [[Sue Austin]]'s ''Creating the Spectacle,'' which has reportedly been seen by more than 150 million people worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.a-n.co.uk/news/digital-rd-fund-5-an-underwater-wheelchair-with-ambitions-to-fly|title=Digital R&amp;D Fund #5: An underwater wheelchair with ambitions to fly - a-n The Artists Information Company|work=a-n The Artists Information Company|access-date=2017-06-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have won critical and industry acclaim within their field, such as Touretteshero's ''Backstage in Biscuit Land'', which earned the company the 2014 Total Theatre Award for Best Emerging Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edfringe.com/media/news/total-theatre-award-winners-announced|title=Total Theatre Award winners announced {{!}} Edinburgh Festival Fringe|work=Edinburgh Festival Fringe|access-date=2017-06-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlimited is currently delivered in partnership between [[Shape Arts]] and [[Artsadmin]] with senior producer Jo Verrent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.disabilityartsinternational.org/artists/profiles/jo-verrent/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2012 the programme was funded by the [[Olympic Lottery Distributor]], and was delivered in partnership between London 2012, Arts Council England, [[Creative Scotland]], [[Arts Council of Wales]], [[Arts Council of Northern Ireland]] and [[British Council|the British Council]]. It was the first time the UK's four arts councils had collaborated with the British Council to commission new work. The British Council supported "five UK international collaborations with artists from seven countries which premiered in: Birmingham, Cambridge, Liverpool, Newcastle and Weymouth prior to a major showcase during the Paralympics"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title = Unlimited|url = https://www.britishcouncil.org/london-2012/culture-heart-games/unlimited|website = British Council|ref = British Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; London-based disability-led arts organisation, [[Shape Arts|Shape]] was contracted to support the 29 commissioned artists through the programme. This programme culminated at the inaugural Unlimited Festival at London's [[Southbank Centre]] in September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Unlimited|date=2012|publisher=London 2012 Festival|pages=89–94|accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Unlimited programme (2014–16) "offers commissions to disabled artists to develop, produce and show ambitious and high quality work, with mentoring support. The programme includes biennial festivals at [[Southbank Centre]] (2014 and 2016) and the opportunity for artists to showcase their work across the country through partnerships with venues and organisations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Unlimited|url=http://weareunlimited.org.uk/about-unlimited/|website=Unlimited|publisher=Shape and ArtsAdmin|accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlimited is currently delivered in partnership by Shape and [[Artsadmin]], with funding from Arts Council England, Creative Scotland, Arts Council of Wales and Spirit of 2012. Key partners include British Council, [[DaDaFest]], Southbank Centre, and Tramway. Since 2012, [http://disabilityarts.online Disability Arts Online] has been the official media partner for the festival, tasked with documenting the work produced in the form of journalism.

Arts Council England have announced £1.8 million funding for a continuation of the Unlimited programme including festivals in 2018 and 2020.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/funding/apply-funding/apply-for-funding/unlimited/|title=Unlimited (III)|website=Arts Council England|accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=‘Woeful’ arts diversity progress prompts call for ‘more power and influence’|url=http://www.disabilitynewsservice.com/woeful-arts-diversity-progress-prompts-call-for-more-power-and-influence/|website=Disability News Service|accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commissions==

The primary purpose of the Unlimited programme is to commission new work by disabled artists and get it seen by as wide an audience as possible. Funding for commissions has so far come in three tranches. The first (Unlimited) which ran from 2010-2012, was a commissioning pot for work around the London 2012 Paralympics, with work being shown around the UK and at the first Unlimited Festival at [[Southbank Centre]]. The second (Unlimited II) covered the years 2013-2016 with work presented at various venues across the UK, culminating at the Unlimited Festivals in 2014 and 2016, again at Southbank Centre and for 2016, also at Glasgow's Tramway. The third (Unlimited III) will cover the period 2017-2020, which will include a greater focus on international collaborations and will encompass works which will be shown at Unlimited Festivals in 2018 and 2020.

===Unlimited (2010-12)===
The works commissioned with the original tranche of funding were:

==Unlimited Festivals==

The Unlimited Festivals are biennial events, the first of which was held in 2012 to coincide with the Paralympic Games. Unlimited Festival 2012 was held at London's Southbank Centre from 30 August - 9 September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unlimited Festival Trailer|url=https://vimeo.com/48391700|website=Arts Council Vimeo Channel|accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Unlimited Festival attracted live audiences of 20,000 people at ticketed and free events and engaged with an estimated 11,000 people through digital media.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In 2013, when the Unlimited commissioning programme was taken on by Shape and Artsadmin, the relationship between the commissioning body and the festival changed; Southbank Centre would take responsibility for the festival, whilst Shape and Artsadmin would administer the commissioning programme. The festival would continue to act as a showcase event for the work commissioned by the programme, but other work by disabled artists would also feature alongside the Unlimited-commissioned work. The Southbank Centre hosted the second Unlimited Festival from 2–9 September 2014. Unlimited 2016 marked the first time that the festival went to a venue other than Southbank Centre. The festival took place at the Southbank Centre from 6–11 September, before Tramway in Glasgow hosted their own version of the festival from 15–25 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unlimited.southbankcentre.co.uk/|title=Home - Southbank Unlimited|last=Centre|first=Southbank|website=unlimited.southbankcentre.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.glasgowlife.org.uk/news/pages/tramway's-unlimited-festival-programme-announced.aspx|title=Tramway's Unlimited Festival programme announced|website=www.glasgowlife.org.uk|language=en-us|access-date=2017-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Arts Council England has committed funding for future festivals in 2018 and 2020.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Unlimited Impact==

Unlimited Impact focuses on developing and inspiring the next generation of young disabled people passionate about making change through the arts; extending Unlimited’s reach by supporting venues across the country to successfully programme ambitious and high quality work by disabled artists; and deepening discussion and debate around work by disabled artists.

Unlimited Impact projects include:

The figurine was discovered in 1930, near the [[Sudost River]] in the province of Briansk in Russia. It is 15 cm high and was carved from mammoth ivory. Remarkably, the figurine depicts a young woman, just like the [[Venus impudique]].&lt;ref&gt;Henri Delporte: ''L’image de la femme dans l’art préhistorique'', Ed. Picard 1979, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;
