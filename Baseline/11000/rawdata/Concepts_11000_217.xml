'''Age of consent reform''' is efforts to change [[age of consent]] laws.  Proposed reforms typically include raising, lowering, or abolishing the age of consent, applying (or not applying) close-in-age exemptions, changing penalties, or changing how cases are examined in court. A related issue is whether or not to apply ages of consent to [[homosexual]] relationships that are different from those applied to [[heterosexual]] relationships.  Organized efforts have ranged from academic discussions to political petitions.

==Initiatives to change the age of consent==
There have been many initiatives to raise the age of consent. [[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian]], a canon lawyer in the 12th century, stated that consent could not take place before 7 years of age. The English government eventually decided on age of 12 for women as their limitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/childhood/A-Ar/Age-of-Consent.html |title=Age of Consent – Encyclopedia of Children and Childhood in History and Society |publisher=Faqs.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the age was about 12 in most countries. Today it is usually set between 15 and 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avert.org/age-of-consent.htm |title=Worldwide Ages of Consent |publisher=Avert.org |date=2011-02-04 |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{main article|Age of consent reform (UK)}}
In 1275, the age of consent in England was set at 12 (Westminster 1 statute), the first time an age of consent had been set in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Robertson, Stephen|title=Age of Consent Laws|url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/cyh/case-studies/230|website=Children and Youth in History|publisher=[[University of Sydney]]|accessdate=3 August 2015|location=[[Sydney]], [[Australia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1875 the [[Offences against the Person Act 1875|Offence Against the Persons Act]] raised it to 13 in Great Britain and Ireland. The [[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885|Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1885]] raised it to 16.&lt;ref name="Odem1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mary E.

According to sociologist Matthew Waites, in the 1970s, a number of grassroots political actions took place in Britain in favor of lowering the age of consent, which he described as based on claims of children's rights, gay liberation, or as a way to avoid unwanted pregnancies or [[sexually transmitted infection]]s.&lt;ref name=waites&gt;{{cite book|author=Matthew Waites|title=The Age of Consent: Young People, Sexuality and Citizenship|url=http://www.palgrave.com/page/detail/the-age-of-consent-matthew-waites/?K=9781403921734|date=15 August 2009|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-23718-6}} ([https://books.google.com/books?id=kLhhPwAACAAJ&amp;dq=he+Age+of+Consent+%E2%80%93+Young+People,+Sexuality+and+Citizenship&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aQNAVc7IG_P9sATxj4DwDw&amp;ved=0CBQQ6AEwAA Google books link])&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1974, the [[Campaign for Homosexual Equality]] suggested a basic age of consent of 16, but 12 "in cases where a defendant could prove the existence of meaningful consent".&lt;ref&gt;Waites, Matthew (2005, op.cit., pp. 132 and 243, Note 6.6)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gay News, no. 46, 9 May 1974, p.3 – 'CHE Report angers reformers'.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1974, the [[Homosexual Law Reform Society|Sexual Law Reform Society]] proposed lowering the age of consent to 14, with the requirement that below the age of 18  the burden of proof that consent for sexual activities between the parties existed would be the responsibility of the older participant.&lt;ref&gt;Waites, Matthew (2005, op.cit., p.132).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, the British political advocacy group [[Liberty (pressure group)|the National Council for Civil Liberties]] (now known as ''Liberty'') published a proposal advocating reducing the age of consent laws to 10 years of age, only when both individuals are younger than 14, with a close-in-age exemption of two years if one of the involved individuals is older than 14 but younger than 16.&lt;ref&gt;Waites, Matthew (2005, p.135-136).

New York/London: Palgrave MacMillan. {{ISBN|978-1-4039-2173-4}}. {{ISBN|1-4039-2173-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The report was signed by [[Harriet Harman]], who later went on to become a prominent figure in government and deputy leader of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and the focus of media attention due to her affiliations with the NCCL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/4949555/Harriet-Harman-under-attack-over-bid-to-water-down-child-pornography-law.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Martin | last=Beckford | title=Harriet Harman under attack over bid to water down child pornography law | date=March 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
Russia in 1998 lowered the age of consent from 16 to 14,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_19123/#p29 | title=25 июня 1998 года N 92-ФЗ}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in 2002 raised the age of consent from 14 back to 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_45408/#p243| title=8 декабря 2003 года N 162-ФЗ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ageofconsent.com/russia.htm |title=Russia – Age of Consent |author=Peter Graff |date=June 28–29, 2002 |publisher=Reuters (via Age of Consent) |accessdate=August 25, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927121103/http://www.ageofconsent.com/russia.htm |archive-date=2011-09-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ageofconsent.com/russia.htm |title=Russia |publisher=Age of Consent |date= |accessdate=2012-03-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927121103/http://www.ageofconsent.com/russia.htm |archive-date=2011-09-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then penalties have also generally increased. Vladimir Putin said that a party advocating lowering the age of consent cannot be legally registered (hence, be a legal party) in Russia.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

===India===
In January 2004, a [[Division bench]] of the [[Kerala]]'s [[Kerala High Court|High Court]] in Southern [[India]] suggested that the age of consent should be raised from 16 to 18 in that state. Justice R. Basant said he considered "illogic(al)" that a legal system in which an age of 18 is used for other purposes – like the Indian Majority Act, the Contract Act, the [[Juvenile Justice Act]], the [[Child Marriage in India|Child Marriage Restraint Act]] and the Representation of People Act – has a different approach in the case of sexual consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asiansexgazette.com/asg/south_asia/southasia03news67.htm |title=Kerala, Raise age-limit for giving consent for sexual intercourse to 18 – South Asia |publisher=Asian Sex Gazette |date=2004-01-21 |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The age of consent in India was raised from 16 to 18 in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-05-23/india/31826039_1_children-from-sexual-offences-sexual-abuse-courts-for-speedy-trial | work=The Times Of India | title=Parliament clears bill against child abuse | date=May 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{main article|Ages of consent in the United States}}
Over the course of American history, the most commonly observed age of consent was 10 years. In 1880, 37 states had an age of consent of 10 years while 10 states kept an age of consent at 12, and Delaware maintained its age of consent at seven years, having lowered it from 10 in 1871.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 15, 1895|title=[[:s:The_New_York_Times/1895/10/15/Purity_Congress_Meets|PURITY CONGRESS MEETS; A Great Gathering for Moral Work in the City of Baltimore.

In the late-19th century, a "[[social purity movement]]" composed of Christian feminist reform groups began advocating a raise in the age of consent to 16, with the goal of raising it ultimately to 18, and by 1920 almost all states had raised their age of consent to 16 or 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://womhist.alexanderstreet.com/teacher/aoc.htm |title=The Campaign to Raise the Age of Consent 1885–1914 |author= |date= |work=Women and Social Movements in the United States, 1600–2000 |accessdate=August 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-1970s, there was widespread sympathy among homosexual activist groups for lowering the age of consent for all sexual activities (partially due to the disparate ages of consent for same-sex and opposite-sex sexual activity),&lt;ref name="Warner2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tom Warner|title=Never Going Back: A History of Queer Activism in Canada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mdo-95q2EYgC&amp;pg=PA124|year=2002|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-0-8020-8460-6|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; with many gay publications freely discussing lowering it for boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Decade of Nightmares: The End of the Sixties and the Making of Eighties America|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=t3RDzkqR_88C|publisher = Oxford University Press, USA|date = 2006-03-15|isbn = 9780198039723|first = Philip Jenkins Distinguished Professor of History and Religious Studies Pennsylvania State|last = University|page = 120}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tensions and antagonisms continued among activist circles until the 1980s; however, since the 1970s, [[gay liberation]]ist groups promoting frontline advocacy against the age of consent were falling into decline.&lt;ref name="Warner2002" /&gt; 

A small number of voices continued into the 2000s among self-declared pedophiles on certain [[internet]] websites and chatrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = On the Web, Pedophiles Extend Their Reach|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/21/technology/21pedo.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2006-08-21|access-date = 2015-10-20|issn = 0362-4331|first = Kurt|last = Eichenwald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two final states legislating their ages of consent into the 15–18 range were Georgia and Hawaii, from 14, raised in 1995 and 2001, respectively.

As of August 1, 2018, the age of consent in each state in the United States was either 16 years of age, 17 years of age, or 18 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Age of Consent across the United States |url = https://www.ageofconsent.net/states|work = AgeOfConsent.net|access-date = 2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alabama====
In 2012, Alabama State Representative Mac McCutcheon sponsored a bill to raise the age of consent from 16 to 18.&lt;ref&gt;http://whnt.com/2012/04/30/lawmaker-pushes-bill-to-raise-age-of-consent-in-alabama/&lt;/ref&gt; As of August 2018, the age of consent in Alabama remains 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = State-by-State Marriage "Age of Consent" Laws|url = https://family.findlaw.com/marriage/state-by-state-marriage-age-of-consent-laws.html|work = FindLaw.com|access-date = 2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hawaii====
In 2001, the legislature in Hawaii voted to raise the age of consent from 14 to 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=e5Az1lGCJwQC |page=1118 }} |title=Far East and Australasia 2003 – Eur |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Georgia====
In June 2005, a bill was proposed before the General Assembly of Georgia (USA) to raise the age of consent from 16 to 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legis.state.ga.us/legis/2005_06/fulltext/hb722.htm |title=hb722.html |publisher=Legis.state.ga.us |date=2005-07-01 |accessdate=2012-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804092842/http://www.legis.state.ga.us/legis/2005_06/fulltext/hb722.htm |archivedate=2009-08-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legis.ga.gov/legis/2005_06/search/hb722.htm |title=Georgia General Assembly – HB 722 |publisher=Legis.ga.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722045004/http://www1.legis.ga.gov/legis/2005_06/search/hb722.htm |archivedate=2012-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill failed, however. 

Georgia was the most notoriously resistant state to raising its age of consent in the early 1900s.  Georgia's age of consent was  10 until 1918, and even then the age of consent was only raised to 14. &lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=KtMRAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA336&amp;lpg=PA336&amp;dq=1918+georgia+age+of+consent&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-35YG3-ON2&amp;sig=5-9-iSWz7tDGkAQo8AqaUc2F_mU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjriceHwd3YAhUlTd8KHTnJDkEQ6AEISTAG#v=onepage&amp;q=1918%20georgia%20age%20of%20consent&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;Even after raising the age of consent in 1918, Georgia was still the only state in the United States to have an age of consent lower than 16. &lt;ref&gt;http://chnm.gmu.edu/cyh/case-studies/230?section=primarysources&amp;source=24&lt;/ref&gt; Georgia's age of consent remained at 14 until 1995, when a bill proposed by senator Steve Langford to make the age of consent 16 passed.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1454&amp;dat=19950207&amp;id=gU5OAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=CRUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2408,2396348&lt;/ref&gt;   

In 2006, following the infamous case of Genarlow Wilson ([[Wilson v. State]]), aggravated child molestation was reduced to a misdemeanor with a maximum of one year in prison if the offender was under 19, the victim was either 14 or 15 years old, and the offender is no more than 48 months older than the victim. (Georgia penal code, 16-6-4). Previously aggravated child molestation (at any age) carried 10–20 years imprisonment regardless of the age difference between the victim and offender.

====Kentucky====
In 2007 in Kentucky Representative JR Gray sponsored legislation in the state legislature that passed making it a felony for a teacher to have sex with a student under the age of 18. He also discussed the possibility of raising the age of consent from 16 to 18 but a bill was not produced for that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2007-11-02-misconduct_N.htm | work=USA Today | first=Robert | last=Tanner | title=States target sexual misconduct in schools | date=November 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Missouri====
In 2008 a bill was proposed in the Missouri legislature to raise the age of consent from 17 to 18. It was sponsored by Representative Stanley Cox.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.joplinglobe.com/local/x212127249/Missouri-House-bill-would-raise-age-of-consent-to-18&lt;/ref&gt;

In South Carolina in 2007 a bill was proposed before the legislature to raise the age of consent from 16 to 18.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wrdw.com/home/headlines/5431721.html&lt;/ref&gt; It did not succeed.

====Wisconsin====
Prior to 1981 Wisconsin had an exception to the law that allowed adults who were guilty of sex with minors 15 or older to use as a defense that the victim understood the nature of the sexual act, but there was a rebuttable presumption in Wisconsin that minors under the age of 18 were not capable of informed consent to sex, but as stated, this could be argued against by the defendant in the court of law if the minor was 15 years of age or older. In 1981 the age of consent was lowered from 18 to 16 in Wisconsin, but at the same time it was made an automatic felony to have sex with anyone under 16, informed consent for a 15-year-old was no longer a defense an adult defendant could use in court. In 1983 the age of consent in Wisconsin was raised from 16 to 18, under the new law sex with a minor 16 or older carried the lesser penalty of a Class A Misdemeanor. A marital exemption was included in the law for an adult who was married to a minor 16 or older, but no close-in-age exception was.&lt;ref&gt;Owzsewski, DJ Statutory Rape in Wisconsin 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
{{Main article|Age of consent reform in Canada}}
In June 2006, the Canadian government proposed a bill to raise the age of consent from 14 to 16 (in 1890, it was raised from 12 to 14), while creating a near-age exemption for sex between 14- to 15-year-olds and partners less than 5 years older, and keeping an existing near-age clause for sex between 12–13 year olds and partners less than 2 years older. The initiative also maintains a temporary exception for already existing marriages of minors 14 and 15 years old to adults, but forbids new marriages like these in the future.&lt;ref name="ctv.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060623/age_consent_faq_060623/20060623/ |title=Age of Consent FAQ |publisher=CTV.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The law took effect 1 May 2008.

===Netherlands===
Between 1990 and 2002, the Netherlands operated what was in effect an age of consent of 12, subject to qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=yit1CY_4BRMC }} |title=Regulating Sex: The politics of Intimacy and Identity |author=Elizabeth Bernstein, Laurie Schaffner |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relevant law, passed in November, 1990, permitted sexual intercourse for young people between 12 and 16, but allowed a challenge by parents based on erosion of parental authority or child exploitation, which would be heard by a Council for the Protection of Children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Evans |first=David T. |year=1993 |title=Sexual Citizenship: The Material Construction of Sexualities |page=208 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=0-415-05799-X |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=no-94x3v74IC&amp;pg=PT208&amp;dq=evans+1993+Sexual+Citizenship:+The+Material+Construction+of+Sexualities&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=puc_VfLwD_XfsATrsoE4&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=netherlands&amp;f=false}} (link is to the 2013 edition)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, the Dutch [[Pacifist Socialist Party]] supported an unsuccessful petition to lower the age of consent to 12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brongersma |first=Edward |year=1988 |chapter=Schutzalter 12 Jahre? – Sex mit Kindern in der niederländischen Gesetzgebung |trans-chapter=Age of Consent 12 years?

===Peru===
The age of consent in [[Peru]] was increased from 14 to 18 in 2006 as elections approached, but in 2007, Peru's new Congress voted to return the age to 14 regardless of gender and/or sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=Peru001 &gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/06/22/world/main2970190.shtml |title=Peru Lowers Age Of Consent To 14 |publisher=CBS News |date=22 June 2007  |accessdate=28 Jan 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after strong public opposition, the law was raised back to 18 on June 27, 2007, by a vote of 74 to zero (22 abstentions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.congreso.gob.pe/Sicr/Prensa/heraldo.nsf/CNnoticiasanteriores/fc34916372aa85c9052573070053ab5a?OpenDocument |title=Pleno Reconsidero Exoneracion de Sedunda Votacion a Proyecto Sobre Libertad Sexual |date=2007-06-27 |publisher=El Heraldo |language=Spanish |trans-title=House Reconsidered and Excluded Second Vote for Project on Sexual Freedom |accessdate=2010-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was returned to 14 in January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tc.gob.pe/jurisprudencia/2013/00008-2012-AI.pdf| title = Demanda de inconstitucionalidad interpuesta por diez mil seiscientos nueve ciudadanos contra el artículo 1° de la Ley N° 28704 que modifica el artículo 173°, inciso 3° del Código Penal, sobre delito de violación sexual contra víctima entre 14 y 18 años de edad | language = Spanish | date = 2013-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
In 1977 while a reform in the French penal code was under discussion in the parliament, a [[French petition against age of consent laws|petition to decriminalize]] all consented relations between adults and [[minor (law)|minor]]s below the age of fifteen was sent to Parliament but did not succeed in changing the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Foucault |first=Michel |authorlink=Michel Foucault |title=Politics, Philosophy, Culture: Interviews and Other Writings 1977–1984 |editor-first=Lawrence D. |editor-last=Krizman |location=New York / London |year=1988 |publisher=Routledge |pages=272–273 |isbn=0-415-90082-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1978 the petition was discussed in a broadcast by radio [[France Culture]] in the program "Dialogues", with the transcript later published under the title [[Sexual Morality and the Law]] in a book by [[Michel Foucault]]. The participants, including Foucault, play-writer/actor [[Jean Danet]] and novelist/gay activist [[Guy Hocquenghem]] had all signed the petition.

===Pedophile advocacy===
Some [[pedophiles]] have called to abolish the age of consent to allow adults to have sex freely with  prepubescent children, arguing they can consent.&lt;ref name=jenkins2006&gt;{{cite book|title=Decade of Nightmares: The End of the Sixties and the Making of Eighties America |first=Philip |last=Jenkins |year=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=120|isbn=0-19-517866-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spiegel"&gt;{{cite book|title=Sexual Abuse of Males: The Sam Model of Theory and Practice |last= Spiegel |first=Josef |year=2003 |pages=5, p9 |publisher=Routledge |isbn= 1-56032-403-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups advocating pedophilia and the abolishment of age of consent laws include [[NAMBLA]] in the United States and [[Vereniging Martijn]] in the Netherlands.

==Close-in-age exemptions==
{{main article|Statutory rape#Romeo and Juliet laws|l1=Romeo and Juliet laws}}
In the United States, many states have adopted close-in-age exemptions. These laws, known as "Romeo and Juliet laws"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What Is a Romeo and Juliet Law|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/criminal-law/what-romeo-and-juliet-law|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=5 September 2017|date=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; provide that a person can legally have consensual sex with a minor provided that he or she is not more than a given number of years older, generally four years or less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Volokh|first1=Eugene|title=Statutory rape laws and ages of consent in the U.S.|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/05/01/statutory-rape-laws-in-the-u-s/|accessdate=5 September 2017|publisher=Washington Post|date=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stateline/&gt; Some Romeo and Juliet laws (such as the law in Michigan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MCL 28.728c.

Romeo and Juliet laws were passed in 2007 in Connecticut and Indiana.&lt;ref name=stateline&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2007/07/16/new-laws-take-romeo-into-account |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151024022131/http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2007/07/16/new-laws-take-romeo-into-account |archivedate=2015-10-24 |dead-url=no |title=New laws take 'Romeo' into account |author=John Gramlich |date=July 16, 2007 |work=Stateline.org |accessdate=August 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Indiana, a change in the law decriminalizes consensual sex between adolescents if they are found by a court to be in a "dating relationship" with an age difference of four years or less&lt;ref name=stateline/&gt; and other states have adopted other reforms. Michigan passed a Romeo and Juliet Law in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uppermichiganssource.com/news/story.aspx?id=608159 |title=Understanding the Romeo &amp; Juliet Law |first1=Noël |last1=McLaren |date=April 20, 2011 |work=Upper Michigan's Source |accessdate=August 18, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006032345/http://www.uppermichiganssource.com/news/story.aspx?id=608159 |archivedate=October 6, 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These reforms have been controversial. In Texas, Governor [[Rick Perry]] vetoed Romeo and Juliet laws that had been passed by the legislature in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Grissom |first1=Brandi |title=Gov.

Limon]] case, Kansas's Romeo and Juliet law was found to be unconstitutional because it excluded same-sex sexual conduct.

Some countries other than the United States also have Romeo and Juliet laws.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3838">'''''An Agenda for Peace: Preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace-keeping''''', more commonly known simply as '''''An Agenda for Peace''''', is a report written for the [[United Nations]] by Secretary-General [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]] in 1992.  In it, Boutros-Ghali responds to a request by the UN [[Security Council]] for an "analysis and recommendations" to strengthen peacemaking and peace-keeping.  The document outlines the way Boutros-Ghali felt the UN should respond to conflict in the post-[[Cold War]] world.

Recognizing the limitations of [[peacekeeping]], especially as such efforts were becoming prevalent in the early 1990s, the UN Security Council convened in 1992 in a first-time meeting of heads of state.  The 15 members finished the conference by issuing a statement calling on then-Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to write a report recommending future reforms.  In their statement, the heads-of-state recognized that, &lt;blockquote&gt;“The absence of war and military conflicts amongst States does not in itself ensure international peace and security.  The non-military sources of instability in the economic, social, [[humanitarianism|humanitarian]] and [[ecological]] fields have become threats to peace and security.  The United Nations membership as a whole, working through the appropriate bodies, needs to give the highest priority to the solution of these matters.”&lt;ref name=intro&gt;UN Department of Public Information, Yearbook of the United Nations 1992, 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Security Council saw what many critics of peacekeeping have suggested, and some recent failures had made obvious: peacekeeping alone, as then practiced, was not enough to ensure lasting peace.
	
Boutros-Ghali submitted his response some months later, in the form of ''An Agenda for Peace''.  In it, he outlined a number of additional processes of preventative diplomacy the international community could use before peacekeeping, or simultaneously.  He also suggested distinct definitions for peacemaking and peacekeeping, and referenced [[Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter]] to justify military involvement without the consent of both parties.&lt;ref&gt;Michael W. Doyle, "Discovering the Limits and Potential of Peacekeeping," 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Previously, these concepts had not been formally addressed by the UN's leadership.  However, ''An Agenda for Peace''’s most significant contribution to the modern understanding of peace is its introduction of the concept of “post-conflict [[peacebuilding]].”  Boutros-Ghali defines “post-conflict peace-building” as “action to identify and support structures which will tend to strengthen and solidify peace in order to avoid a relapse into conflict.”&lt;ref&gt;Boutros Boutros-Ghali, "An Agenda for Peace,” II.21.
&lt;/ref&gt;  
	
The concept of post-conflict peacebuilding has been especially important in the academic discipline of [[peace and conflict studies]].  It has been adopted by a number of scholars to suggest a framework for peace that addresses not only the latent forms of physical violence, but also aspects of a society that are structurally violent, and could lead to a re-emergence of fighting (see the discussion of [[Peace and conflict studies#Conceptions of peace|positive peace]] in the article on [[peace and conflict studies]]).

'''''Augoeides''''' is an obscure term meaning "luminous body" and thought to refer to the [[planets]]. [[Aleister Crowley]] considered the term to refer to the [[Holy Guardian Angel]] of [[The Book of Abramelin|Abramelin]]; the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]] of [[Hinduism]] the [[Daemon (classical mythology)|Daemon]] of the [[ancient Greeks]]. Robert Lomas associates the term with the ''Higher Self'' or soul of the individual&lt;ref&gt;Lomas, Robert. ''The Secret Science of Masonic Initiation''. San Francisco: Weiser, 2010, pp.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Etymology==
It appears that [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] used it and [[Thomas Taylor (neoplatonist)|Thomas Taylor]] commented on it. The term is encountered in the literature of [[Neo-Platonic]] [[theurgy]] and was popularized in the 19th and 20th centuries by the [[Theosophists]], [[Freemasons]], and the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]].

To quote [[Thomas Taylor (neoplatonist)|Thomas Taylor]]'s comment on Porphyry:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We are afterwards sent through ample Elysium, and a few of us possess the joyful plains: till a long period, when the revolving orb of time has perfected its circulation, frees the soul from its concrete stains, and leaves the etherial sense pure, together with the fire (or splendour) of simple ether." For here he evidently conjoins the rational soul, or the etherial sense, with its splendid vehicle, or the fire of simple ether; since it is well known that this vehicle, according to Plato, is rendered by proper purgation 'augoeides', or luciform, and divine. It must here however be observed that souls in these meadows of asphodel, or summit of Pluto's empire, are in a falling state; or in other words through the secret influx of matter begin to desire a terrene situation. And this explains the reason why Hercules in the infernal regions is represented by Homer boasting of his terrene exploits and glorying in his pristine valour; why Achilles laments his situation in these abodes; and souls in general are engaged in pursuits similar to their employment on the earth: for all this is the natural consequence of a propensity to a mortal nature, and a desertion of the regions every way lucid and divine. Let the reader too observe, that, according to the arcana of the Platonic doctrine, the first and truest seat of the soul is in the intelligible world, where she lives entirely divested of body, and enjoys the ultimate felicity of her nature. And this is what Homer divinely insinuates when he says: "after this I saw the Herculean power, or image: but Hercules himself is with the immortal gods, delighting in celestial banquets, and enjoying the beautiful-footed Hebe." Since for the soul to dwell with the gods, entirely separated from its vehicle, is to abide in the intelligible world, and to exercise, as Plotinus expresses it, the more sacred contests of wisdom.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To quote H.P. [[Blavatsky]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The most substantial difference consisted in the location of the immortal or divine spirit of man. While the ancient Neoplatonists held that the Augoeides never descends hypostatically into the living man, but only more or less sheds its radiance on the inner man – the astral soul – the Kabalists of the Middle Ages maintained that the spirit, detaching itself from the ocean of light and spirit, entered into man's soul, where it remained through life imprisoned in the astral capsule. This difference was the result of the belief of [[Christian Kabalists]], more or less, in the dead letter of the allegory of the fall of man.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In referencing of the Hellenic origin of the word, it might be understood to emerge from 'αυγο', meaning 'egg', or 'αυγή', meaning 'dawn', combined of 'είδηση', indicative of 'news' or 'a message', and thus the connection in Aleister Crowley's mind between the 'egg message' and 'the Knowledge &amp; Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel' or 'higher &amp; original (egg) genius' associated of one's human being. Combined of 'είδωλο', an 'idol' or 'reflection', one might see in it Plato's 'luminous being', a 'reflection of the dawn'. Such a direct etymology is, however, admittedly speculative and subject to revision or reconfirmation by another.

{{about|the conservation biology topic|other uses of "BAP"|BAP (disambiguation)}}

A '''biodiversity action plan''' ('''BAP''') is an internationally recognized program addressing [[threatened species]] and [[habitat]]s and is designed to protect and restore biological systems. The original impetus for these plans derives from the 1992 [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD). As of 2009, 191 countries have ratified the CBD, but only a fraction of these have developed substantive BAP documents.

The principal elements of a BAP typically include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Glowka |first=Lyle |author2=Françoise Burhenne-Guilmin |author3=Hugh Synge |author4=Jeffrey A.

[[File:Lightmatter snowleopard.jpg|thumb|left|[[Snow leopard]], Pakistan, an endangered species]]

A fundamental method of engagement to a BAP is thorough documentation regarding individual species, with emphasis upon the population distribution and [[Conservation biology|conservation]] status. This task, while fundamental, is highly daunting, since only an estimated ten percent of the world’s species are believed to have been characterized as of 2006,&lt;ref name="IUCN"&gt;[http://www.iucnredlist.org/info/tables/table1 IUCN Red-list statistics (2006)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630000000/http://www.iucnredlist.org/info/tables/table1 |date=June 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; most of these unknowns being [[fungi]], [[invertebrate]] animals, micro-organisms and plants. For many bird, mammal and reptile species, information is often available in published literature; however, for fungi, invertebrate animals, micro-organisms and many plants, such information may require considerable local data collection. It is also useful to compile time trends of population estimates in order to understand the dynamics of population variability and vulnerability. In some parts of the world complete species inventories are not realistic; for example, in the [[Madagascar dry deciduous forests]], many species are completely undocumented and much of the region has never even been systematically explored by scientists.

A species plan component of a country’s BAP should ideally entail a thorough description of the range, habitat, behaviour, breeding and interaction with other species. Once a determination has been made of conservation status (e.g. [[rare species|rare]], endangered, threatened, vulnerable), a plan can then be created to conserve and restore the species population to target levels. Examples of programmatic protection elements are: habitat restoration; protection of habitat from [[urban development]]; establishment of property ownership; limitations on grazing or other agricultural encroachment into habitat; reduction of [[slash-and-burn]] agricultural practises; outlawing killing or collecting the species; restrictions on pesticide use; and control of other environmental pollution. The plan should also articulate which public and private agencies should implement the protection strategy and indicate budgets available to execute this strategy.

==Habitat plans==
Where a number of threatened species depend upon a specific habitat, it may be appropriate to prepare a habitat protection element of the Biodiversity Action Plan. Examples of such special habitats are: raised acidic bogs of Scotland; [[Waterberg Biosphere]] [[bushveld]] in South Africa; California’s coastal [[wetland]]s; and Sweden’s [[Stora Alvaret]] on the island of [[Öland]]. In this case also, careful inventories of species and also the geographic extent and quality of the habitat must be documented. Then, as with species plans, a program can be created to protect, enhance and/or restore habitat using similar strategies as discussed above under the species plans.

==Specific countries==
Some examples of individual countries which have produced substantive Biodiversity Action Plans follow. In every example the plans concentrate on plants and vertebrate animals, with very little attention to neglected groups such as fungi, invertebrate animals and micro-organisms, even though these are also part of biodiversity. Preparation of a country BAP may cost up to 100 million pounds sterling, with annual maintenance costs roughly ten percent of the initial cost. If plans took into account neglected groups, the cost would be higher. Obviously costs for countries with small geographical area or simplified ecosystems have a much lesser cost. For example, the St. Lucia BAP has been costed in the area of several million pounds sterling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| year=2001| author=Government of St. Lucia| title=National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan of St. Lucia| url=http://www.slubiodiv.org/The_Project/Information/Printed_Materials/NBSAP/nbsap.html| accessdate=2006-08-30 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061105113956/http://www.slubiodiv.org/The_Project/Information/Printed_Materials/NBSAP/nbsap.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
[[File:Daintree Rainforest.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Daintree Rainforest]] in [[Queensland]], Australia]]
Australia has developed a detailed and rigorous Biodiversity Action Plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| year=2011| author=Natural Resource Management Ministerial Council| title=Australia's Biodiversity Conservation Strategy 2010-2030| url=http://www.cbd.int/doc/world/au/au-nbsap-v2-en.pdf| accessdate=2012-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This document estimates that the total number of indigenous species may be 560,000, many of which are endemic. A key element of the BAP is protection of the [[Great Barrier Reef]], which is actually in a much higher state of health than most of the world’s [[reef]]s, Australia having one of the highest percentages of treated [[wastewater]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=September 2005| author=Commonwealth of Australia, Department of the Environment and Heritage| title=Great Barrier Reef Water Quality Protection Plan Annual Report 2004-2005| url=http://www.deh.gov.au/coasts/publications/annual-report/04-05/index.html| accessdate=2006-08-30 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060822025646/http://www.deh.gov.au/coasts/publications/annual-report/04-05/index.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is, however,serious ongoing concerns, particularly in regards to the ongoing negative impact on water quality from land use practices. Also, climate change impact is feared to be significant.

Considerable analysis has been conducted on the [[Sustainable forestry|sustainable]] yield of firewood production, a major threat to [[deforestation]] in most tropical countries. Biological inventory work; assessment of harvesting practices; and computer modeling of the dynamics of treefall, rot and harvest; have been carried out to adduce data on safe harvesting rates. Extensive research has also been conducted on the relation of brush clearance to [[biodiversity]] decline and impact on [[water table]]s;&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Glanznig, ''Native Vegetation Clearance, Habitat Loss and Biodiversity Decline: an overview of recent native vegetation clearance in Australia and its implications for biodiversity'', Biodiversity Series, Paper No. 6, Biodiversity Unit, June 1995&lt;/ref&gt; for example, these effects have been analyzed in the [[Toolibin Lake]] wetlands region.

===New Zealand===
{{See also|Biodiversity of New Zealand}}
New Zealand has ratified the Convention on Biological Diversity and as part of The New Zealand Biodiversity Strategy and Biodiversity Action Plans are implemented on ten separate themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Dept. of Conservation; Ministry for the Environment| isbn = 978-0-478-21919-7| title = The New Zealand Biodiversity Strategy| location = [Wellington, N.Z.]| date = February 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local government and some companies also have their own Biodiversity Action Plan.

===St. Lucia===
The [[St. Lucia]] BAP recognizes impacts of large numbers of tourists to the marine and coastal diversity of the [[Soufrière, Saint Lucia|Soufrière]] area of the country. The BAP specifically acknowledges that the [[carrying capacity]] for human use and [[water pollution]] discharge of sensitive reef areas was exceeded by the year 1990. The plan also addresses conservation of the historic island fishing industry. In 1992, several institutions in conjunction with native fishermen to produce a sustainable management plan for fishery resources, embodied in the Soufrière Marine Management Area.

The St. Lucia BAP features significant involvement from the [[University of the West Indies]]. Specific detailed attention is given to three species of threatened marine turtles, to a variety of vulnerable birds and a number of [[pelagic fish]]es and [[cetacean]]s. In terms of [[habitat conservation]] the plan focusses attention on the biologically productive [[mangrove]] swamps and notes that virtually all mangrove areas had already come under national protection by 1984.&lt;ref&gt;''St. Lucia National Marine Fisheries Act of 1984, Section 10'', (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tanzania===
The Tanzania national BAP addresses issues related to sustainable use of [[Lake Manyara]], an extensive freshwater lake, whose usage by humans accelerated in the period 1950 to 1990. The designation of the [[Lake Manyara Biosphere Reserve]] under [[UNESCO]]'s [[Man and the Biosphere Programme]] in 1981 combines conservation of the lake and surrounding high value forests with sustainable use of the wetlands area and simple agriculture. This BAP has united principal lake users in establishing management targets. The biosphere reserve has induced sustainable management of the wetlands, including monitoring [[groundwater]] and the chemistry of the [[escarpment]] water source.&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lake Manyara|url=http://www.unesco.org/mabdb/br/brdir/directory/biores.asp?mode=all&amp;code=URT+01|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
[[File:Fowlsheughclifftonorthsea.JPG|thumb|[[Fowlsheugh]] cliffs, [[Scotland]], a protected [[seabird]] breeding habitat]]
The [[United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan]] covers not only [[Terrestrial ecoregion|terrestrial]] species associated with lands within the UK, but also marine species and [[Bird migration|migratory]] birds, which spend a limited time in the UK or its offshore waters. The UK plan encompasses "391 Species Action Plans, 45 Habitat Action Plans and 162 Local Biodiversity Action Plans with targeted actions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan| url=http://www.ukbap.org.uk/| author=Joint Nature Conservation Committee, London| year=2006| accessdate=2006-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This plan is noteworthy because of its extensive detail, clarity of endangerment mechanisms, specificity of actions, follow up monitoring program and its inclusion of migrating cetaceans and pelagic birds.

On August 28, 2007, the new Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) [launched in 1997] identified 1,149 species and 65 habitats in the UK that needed conservation and greater protection. The updated list included the [[hedgehog]], [[house sparrow]], [[grass snake]] and the [[garden tiger moth]], while [[otter]]s, [[bottlenose dolphin]]s and [[red squirrel]]s remained in need of habitat protection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6965681.stm BBC NEWS, Hedgehogs join 'protection' list]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, the European Commission adopted a new strategy to halt the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services in the EU by 2020, in line with the commitments made at the 10th meeting of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) held in Nagoya, Japan in 2010. In 2012 the UK BAP was succeeded by the 'UK Post-2010 Biodiversity Framework'.

==== UK BAP website ====
To support the work of the UK BAP, the UK BAP website was created by JNCC in 2001. The website contained information on the BAP process, hosted all relevant documents, and provided news and relevant updates. In March 2011, as part of the UK government’s review of websites, the UK BAP site was ‘closed’, and the core content was migrated into the JNCC website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=UK Biodiversity Action Plan| url=http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/default.aspx?page=5155| author=Joint Nature Conservation Committee, London| year=2012| accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Content from the original UK BAP website has been archived by the [[National Archives (UK)|National Archives]] as snapshots from various dates (for example, UK ''BAP'': copy March 2011;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=UK Biodiversity Action Plan archive copy| url=http://www.ukbap.org.uk/default.aspx| author=National Archives, London| year=2011| accessdate=2012-10-28| deadurl=yes| archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110303145238/http://www.ukbap.org.uk/default.aspx| archivedate=March 3, 2011| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
Twenty-six years prior to the international biodiversity convention, the United States had launched a national program to protect threatened species in the form of the 1966 [[Endangered Species Act]]. The legislation created broad authority for analyzing and listing species of concern, and mandated that Species [[Endangered Species Recovery Plan|Recovery Plan]]s be created. Thus, while the USA is an unratified signer of the accord, arguably it has the longest track record and most comprehensive program of species protection of any country. There are about 7000 listed species (e.g. endangered or threatened), of which about half have approved Recovery Plans. While this number of species seems high compared to other countries, the value is rather indicative of the total number of species characterized, which is extremely large.

===Uzbekistan===
Five major divisions of habitat have been identified in [[Uzbekistan]]’s BAP: Wetlands (including reed habitat and man-made [[marsh]]); desert ecosystems (including sandy, stony and clay); [[steppes]]; [[riparian]] ecosystems; and mountain ecosystems. Over 27,000 species have been inventoried in the country, with a high rate of [[endemism]] for fishes and reptiles. Principal threats to biodiversity are related to human activities associated with overpopulation and generally related to agricultural intensification.&lt;ref&gt;''Biodiversity Conservation National Strategy and Action Plan of Republic of Uzbekistan'', 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Major geographic regions encompassed by the BAP include the [[Aral Sea]] Programme (threatened by long-term drainage and [[salination]], largely for cotton production), the Nuratau Biosphere Reserve, and the Western [[Tien Shan Mountains]] Programme (in conjunction with [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]]).

==Criticism==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}
Some developing countries criticize the emphasis of BAPs, because these plans inherently favour consideration of [[wildlife]] protection above food and industrial production, and in some cases may represent an obstacle to population growth. The plans are costly to produce, a fact which makes it difficult for many smaller countries and poorer countries to comply. In terms of the plans themselves, many countries have adopted pro-forma plans including little research and even less in the way of natural resource management. Almost universally, this has resulted in plans which emphasize plants and vertebrate animals, and which overlook fungi,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Micheli Guide to Fungal Conservation| url=http://www.fungal-conservation.org/micheli.htm| author=International Society for Fungal Conservation| year=2012| accessdate=2012-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; invertebrate animals and micro-organisms. With regard to specific world regions, there is a notable lack of substantive participation by most of the Middle Eastern countries and much of Africa, the latter of which may be impeded by economic considerations of plan preparation. Some governments such as the [[European Union]] have diverted the purpose of a biodiversity action plan, and implemented the convention accord by a set of economic development policies with referencing certain ecosystems' protection.

==Biodiversity planning: a new way of thinking==
The definition of biodiversity under the Convention on Biological Diversity now recognises that biodiversity is a combination of ecosystem structure and function, as much as its components e.g. species, habitats and genetic resources. Article 2 states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''in addressing the boundless complexity of biological diversity, it has become conventional to think in hierarchical terms, from the genetic material within individual cells, building up through individual organisms, populations, species and communities of species, to the biosphere overall...At the same time, in seeking to make management intervention as efficient as possible, it is essential to take an holistic view of biodiversity and address the interactions that species have with each other and their non-living environment, i.e. to work from an ecological perspective.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The World Summit on Sustainable Development endorsed the objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity to ''“achieve by 2010 a significant reduction of the current rate of [[biodiversity loss]] at the global, regional and national level as a contribution to poverty alleviation and to the benefit of life on Earth”.'' To achieve this outcome, biodiversity management will depend on maintaining structure and function.&lt;ref&gt;Noss, R.F. (1990) Indicators for Monitoring Biodiversity: A Hierarchical Approach. Conservation Biology 4 (4) 355–364.&lt;/ref&gt;

Biodiversity is not singularly definable but may be understood via a series of management principles under BAPs, such as:

1. that biodiversity is conserved across all levels and scales – structure, function and composition are conserved at site, regional, state and national scales. 
2. that examples of all ecological communities are adequately managed for conservation.  
3. ecological communities are managed to support and enhance viable populations of animals, fungi, micro-organisms and plants and ecological functions.

Biodiversity and wildlife are not the same thing. The traditional focus on threatened species in BAPs is at odds with the principles of biodiversity management because, by the time species become threatened, the processes that maintain biodiversity are already compromised. Individual species are also regarded as generally poor indicators of biodiversity when it comes to actual planning.&lt;ref&gt;Lindenmayer, D. B., Manning, A. D., Smith, P. L., Possingham, Hugh P., Fischer, J., Oliver, I., McCarthy, M. A., (2002) The Focal-Species Approach and Landscape Restoration: A Conservation Biology 16(2) 338–345&lt;/ref&gt; A species approach to BAPs only serves to identify and at best, apply a patch to existing problems. Increasingly, biodiversity planners are looking through the lens of [[ecosystem services]]. Critics of biodiversity are often confusing the need to protect species (their intrinsic value) with the need to maintain ecosystem processes, which ultimately maintain human society and do not compromise economic development. Hence, a core principle of biodiversity management, that traditional BAPs overlook, is the need to incorporate cultural, social and economic values in the process.

Modern day BAPs use an analysis of [[ecosystem services]], key ecological process drivers, and use species as one of many indicators of change. They would seek to maintain structure and function by addressing habitat connectivity and resilience and may look at communities of species (threatened or otherwise) as one method of monitoring outcomes. Ultimately, species are the litmus test for biodiversity – viable populations of species can only be expected to exist in relatively intact habitats. However, the rationale behind BAPs is to "conserve and restore" biodiversity. One of the fastest developing areas of management is [http://www.bioenergywiki.net/index.php/Biodiversity_Offsets biodiversity offsets]. The principles are in keeping with ecological impact assessment, which in turn depends on good quality BAPs for evaluation. Contemporary principles of biodiversity management, such as those produced by the [http://www.forest-trends.org/biodiversityoffsetprogram/ Business Biodiversity Offsets Program]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://eianzecology.blogspot.com/2009/03/principles-in-biodiversity-offsets.html|title= Principles in Biodiversity Offsets}}&lt;/ref&gt; are now integral to any plans to manage biodiversity, including the development of BAPs.

{{Renewable energy sources}}

'''Bioliquids''' are liquid fuels made from biomass for energy purposes other than transport (i.e. heating and electricity).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.r-e-a.net/document-library/articles/REAYearbook2009FINALVersion.pdf Renewable Energy Association 2009 Handbook]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bioliquids are usually made from virgin or used vegetable and seed oils, like [[Palm oil|palm]] or [[Soybean oil|soya]] oil. These oils are burned in a power station to create heat, which can then be used to warm homes or boil water to make steam. This steam can then be used to drive a turbine to generate electricity.

[[Rudolf Diesel]]'s first public exhibition of the internal combustion engine, that was to later bear his name, ran on [[peanut]] oil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energybulletin.net/node/3986 Sustainable Energy From Vegetable Oil]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bioliquid production and use==
Bioliquids have been used for many years to provide heat for homes on a small scale but now big energy providers are looking at their use on a larger scale.

A controversial plant in [[Bristol]] (UK) was recently given the go ahead despite receiving several hundred complaints.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-12439191 BBC News: Bristol biofuel plant given go-ahead by Eric Pickles]&lt;/ref&gt; The plant will be built and operated by W4B and provide enough power for 25,000 homes.

==Advantages==
Bioliquids have several key advantages over other sources of renewable energy:&lt;ref name="greenwise"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.greenwisebusiness.co.uk/news/bioliquids-do-they-have-a-role-in-renewable-energy-2183.aspx | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120315021204/http://www.greenwisebusiness.co.uk/news/bioliquids-do-they-have-a-role-in-renewable-energy-2183.aspx | dead-url= yes | archive-date= 2012-03-15 | title= Bioliquids: do they have a role in renewable energy? | last= Aylott | first= Matthew | date= March 2011 | work=  | publisher= Green Wise Business | accessdate=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bioliquids have a high energy density
* The technology is well established, having been used for many years
* Can be used on demand, reacting quickly to changes in demand for power
* Can help reduce dependency on foreign oil.
* Reduces the green house gas emissions.

==Disadvantages==
{{Main|Issues relating to biofuels}}

Many of the same problems that affect biofuels also affect bioliquids and there are various social, economic, environmental and technical issues, which have been discussed in the popular media and scientific journals. These include: the effect of moderating [[oil prices]], the "[[food vs fuel]]" debate, [[poverty reduction]] potential, [[carbon emissions]] levels, [[sustainable biofuel]] production, [[deforestation]] and [[soil erosion]], [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]], impact on [[water resources]], as well as energy balance and efficiency.

Bioliquids also have several key problems compared to other sources of renewable energy:&lt;ref&gt;[[National Non-Food Crops Centre]]. [http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/tools/evaluation-of-bioliquid-feedstocks-and-heat-electricity-and-chp-technologies-nnfcc-11-016 Evaluation of Bioliquid Feedstocks &amp; Heat, Elec. &amp; CHP Technologies, NNFCC 11-016]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Price of fuel is very variable, due to competitiveness of feedstock for other uses (e.g. soap)
* Supply chain is still very new
* Governments, such as the EU, remained undecided on bioliquids

'''Birks' law'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Birks|first=J.B.|title=Scintillations from Organic Crystals: Specific Fluorescence and Relative Response to Different Radiations|journal=Proc. Phys. Soc.|year=1951|volume=A64|pages=874|doi=10.1088/0370-1298/64/10/303|bibcode = 1951PPSA...64..874B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Birks|first=J.B.|title=The Theory and Practice of Scintillation Counting|year=1964|publisher=Pergamon|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; (named after British physicist John B. Birks)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lsc-international.org/conf/pfiles/lsc1979_vol_1_011.pdf A Tribute to Professor John B Birks - LSC International Home]&lt;/ref&gt; is an empirical formula for the light yield per path length as a function of the energy loss per path length for a particle traversing a [[scintillator]], and gives a relation that is not linear at high loss rates.

==Overview==
The relation is:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dL}{dx}  = S \frac{\frac{dE}{dx}}{1+k_B\frac{dE}{dx}}.&lt;/math&gt;
where ''L'' is the light yield, ''S'' is the scintillation efficiency, ''dE/dx'' is the energy loss of the particle per path length, and ''k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' is Birks' constant, which depends on the material. ''k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' is 0.126&amp;nbsp;mm/MeV for [[polystyrene]]-based scintillators&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last=Leverington|first=B.L.|title=A 1 mm Scintillating Fibre Tracker Readout by a Multi-anode Photomultiplier |year=1970 |eprint=1106.5649v2 |author2=Anelli| author3=Campana |author4=Rosellini| class=physics.ins-det}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1.26–2.07 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; g/(MeV cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) for [[polyvinyltoluene]]-based scintillators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Torrisi|first1=L.|title=Plastic scintillator investigations for relative dosimetry in proton-therapy|journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section B|date=October 2000|volume=170|issue=3-4|pages=523–530|doi=10.1016/S0168-583X(00)00237-8|bibcode=2000NIMPB.170..523T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birks speculated that the loss of linearity is due to recombination and quenching effects between the excited molecules and the surrounding substrate.  Birks' law has mostly been tested for [[Scintillation (physics)#Scintillation of organic scintillators|organic scintillators]].  Its applicability to inorganic scintillators is debated.  A good discussion can be found in ''Particle Detectors at Accelerators: Organic scintillators''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Kurtis|title=Particle Detectors at Accelerators: Organic scintillators|url=http://pdg.lbl.gov/2011/reviews/rpp2011-rev-particle-detectors-accel.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A compilation of Birks' constant for various materials can be found in ''Semi-empirical calculation of quenching factors for ions in scintillators''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Tretyak| first=V.I.| title=Semi-empirical calculation of quenching factors for ions in scintillators| journal=Astroparticle Physics| year=2010| volume=33| pages=40–53| doi=10.1016/j.astropartphys.2009.11.002|arxiv = 0911.3041 |bibcode = 2010APh....33...40T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Nyibule| first=S.| title=Birks' scaling of the particle light output functions for the EJ 299-33 plastic scintillator| journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A| year=2014|doi=10.1016/j.nima.2014.09.056|bibcode = 2014NIMPA.768..141N| volume=768| pages=141–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A more complete theory of scintillation saturation, that gives Birks' law when only unimolecular de-excitation is included, can be found in a paper by Blanc, Cambou, and De Laford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blanc|first=D. |author2=Cambou, F. |author3=De Lafond, Y.G.|journal=C.

The '''Centre for Investigative Journalism''' ('''CIJ''') is a British Charity providing training to journalists, researchers, producers and students in the practice and methodology of [[investigative journalism]]. Incorporated as a Company Limited by Guarantee in June 2005 and registered as a Charity in March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Accounts/Ends02/0001118602_AC_20121130_E_C.PDF&lt;/ref&gt; Using grants from the Lorana Sullivan Foundation, the CIJ organises annual three-day summer schools, an annual investigative film week and courses in data journalism and investigative techniques. It has provided training to thousands of journalists, researchers and students from over 35 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Renaissance of Investigative Journalism Summer School at the CIJ in London |url=http://www.mediakritiek.be/blog/2009/07/the_renaissance_of_investigative_journalism_summer_school_at_the_cij_in_london.html |publisher=www.mediakritiek.be |accessdate=18 August 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408230205/http://www.mediakritiek.be/blog/2009/07/the_renaissance_of_investigative_journalism_summer_school_at_the_cij_in_london.html |archivedate=8 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CIJ is based at the School of Journalism at [[Goldsmiths, University of London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gold.ac.uk/media-communications/school-of-journalism/|title=School of Journalism|website=Goldsmiths, University of London|accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2014, has held the CIJ summer school each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gold.ac.uk/media-communications/cij/|title=The Centre for Investigative Journalism (CIJ)|website=Goldsmiths, University of London|accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Centre supports and encourages Freedom of Information,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Future of investigative reporting |url=http://www.yrtk.org/2006/article-future-of-investigative-reporting/ |publisher=www.yrtk.org |accessdate=18 August 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009185252/http://www.yrtk.org/2006/article-future-of-investigative-reporting/ |archivedate=9 October 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Computer Assisted Reporting,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Training material for data journalism |url=http://www.tcij.org/training-material/data-journalism |publisher=www.tcij.org |accessdate=18 August 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508130439/http://www.tcij.org/training-material/data-journalism |archivedate=8 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the protection of whistleblowers.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate-uk/2009/05/19/whistleblowers-need-protection/&lt;/ref&gt; The CIJ offers particular assistance to those working in difficult environments where free speech and freedom of the press are under threat and where truthful reporting can be a dangerous occupation.&lt;ref&gt;{{http://www.journalism.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1022&amp;Itemid=5)){{dead link|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CIJ's training programmes are designed to encourage in-depth reporting on injustice, corruption, the integrity and transparency of institutional power and to hold the powerful to account. This work has been supplemented by publication of Logan handbooks on investigative methods and techniques and mentoring journalist youth groups and young filmmakers.

The CIJ’s supporters include reporters from the [[BBC Radio]] and Television, [[Canal Plus]] (Paris), [[CBS 60 Minutes]], [[Channel Four]], ''[[Private Eye]]'', ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' Insight Team,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harry Evans is new Centre for Investigative Journalism patron|url=http://adrianmonck.com/2008/06/harry-evans-is-new-centre-for-investigative-journalism-patron/|publisher=Adrianmonck.com|accessdate=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'', and [[WikiLeaks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CIJ summer school line-up includes speakers from ProPublica, ''The New York Times'' and Wikileaks |url=http://www.journalism.co.uk/2/articles/535132.php |publisher=www.journalism.co.uk |accessdate=18 August 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306203320/https://www.journalism.co.uk/2/articles/535132.php |archivedate=6 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 2007 the CIJ acquired registered charity status&lt;ref&gt;http://beta.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-details/?regid=1118602&amp;subid=0&lt;/ref&gt; and attracted support from a number of foundations including the [[Open Society Foundations|Open Society Institute]], the [[David E. Potter|David and Elaine Potter Foundation]], the [[Ford Foundation]], the [[Roy H. Park|Park Foundation]], the Reva and David Logan Foundation, Democratie en Media, [[Goldsmiths]], [[University of London]], and several smaller private trusts.

In 2009, the CIJ was instrumental in helping to found the [[Bureau for Investigative Journalism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Bureau of Investigative Journalism|url=http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/|publisher=The Bureau of Investigative Journalism|accessdate=18 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; an independent, foundation-supported producer of in-depth reporting in defence of the public interest.

In 2012, the CIJ instituted a programme of active pro bono assistance, counselling and defence to whistleblowers and those who have exposed crimes and wrongdoing in their workplace.

The CIJ recently launched a programme on information security, organising workshops for journalists, researchers and lawyers on encryption, Tor, OTR and other protective technologies. In 2014, the organisation also began a series of conferences which bring together journalists, technologists and hacktivists to forge alliances against [[mass surveillance]] and censorship. These events are titled the CIJ Logan Symposia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1671">In [[mathematics]], and particularly in [[axiomatic set theory]], '''♣&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;''' ('''clubsuit''') is a family of [[Combinatorics|combinatorial principle]]s that are a weaker version of the corresponding [[diamondsuit|◊&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;]]; it was introduced in 1975&lt;!--by A. Ostaszewski, but no article exists for him--&gt;.

== Definition ==

For a given [[cardinal number]] &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; and a [[stationary set]] &lt;math&gt;S \subseteq \kappa&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\clubsuit_{S}&lt;/math&gt; is the statement that there is a [[sequence]] &lt;math&gt;\left\langle A_\delta: \delta \in S\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt; such that

* every ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''δ''&lt;/sub&gt; is a cofinal [[subset]] of ''δ''
* for every [[Ordinal_number#Closed_unbounded_sets_and_classes|unbounded subset]] &lt;math&gt; A \subseteq \kappa&lt;/math&gt;, there is a &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;A_{\delta} \subseteq A&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\clubsuit_{\omega_1}&lt;/math&gt; is usually written as just &lt;math&gt;\clubsuit&lt;/math&gt;.

== ♣ and ◊ ==

It is clear that [[Diamond principle|◊]] ⇒ ♣, and it was shown in 1975 &lt;!-- again by A. Ostaszewski--&gt; that ♣ + [[continuum hypothesis|CH]] ⇒ ◊; however, [[Saharon Shelah]] gave a proof in 1980 that there exists a model of ♣ in which CH does not hold, so ♣ and ◊ are not equivalent (since ◊ ⇒ CH).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10996">'''Death by boiling''' is a method of [[execution (legal)|execution]] in which a person is killed by being immersed in a [[boiling]] liquid. While not as common as other methods of execution, boiling to death has been used in many parts of [[Europe]] and [[Asia]].

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Bhai Dayala Ji being boiled alive by the Muslim Moguls 1675 A.D.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Sikh martyr [[Bhai Dayala]] being boiled alive by the orders of Mughul Emperor [[Aurangzeb]] in November 1675 A.D.]] --&gt;
Executions of this type were often carried out using a large vessel such as a [[cauldron]] or a sealed [[kettle]] that was filled with a liquid such as water, oil, [[tar]], or [[tallow]], and a [[Pulley|hook and pulley]] system.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Abbott, ''Execution blunders'', pages 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical practice==

===Europe===
[[File:Deventer ketel.jpg|thumb|upright|Execution cauldron at [[Deventer]] ([[Netherlands]])]]
In England, the 9th statute passed in 1531 (the 22nd year of the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]]) made boiling alive the prescriptive form of capital punishment for murder committed by [[poison]]ing, which by the same Act was defined as [[High Treason]].&lt;ref&gt;'Anno 22 Henry VIII (1530-31), Chapter 9', in ''The Statutes of the Realm'' Vol. 3: The Statutes of King Henry VIII, (By Command 1817), Reprint (Dawsons of Pall Mall, London 1963), [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pst.000017915533;view=1up;seq=382 p. 326] (Hathi Trust).&lt;/ref&gt; This arose from an incident in which the [[John Fisher|Bishop of Rochester's]] cook, [[Richard Roose]], gave several people poisoned [[porridge]], resulting in two deaths in February 1531.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Kesselring| first = K.J.| date = Sep 2001|title = A Draft of the 1531 'Acte for Poysoning'|jstor = 579196| pages = 894–899 | publisher = The English Historical Review Vol. 116, No. 468}}&lt;/ref&gt; A partial confession having been extracted by torture, the sentence was thus imposed by [[attainder]] and without [[benefit of clergy]].&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Boiling to Death|volume=4|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; A contemporary chronicle reports the following:&lt;ref&gt;(S.H.

{{quote|He roared mighty loud, and divers women who were big with child did feel sick at the sight of what they saw, and were carried away half dead; and other men and women did not seem frightened by the boiling alive, but would prefer to see the headsman at his work.}}
Boiling to death was employed again in 1542 for a woman, Margaret Davy,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} who had also used poison.&lt;ref name=Newlin2000&gt;{{Citation | last = Newlin | first = George | year = 2000 | title = Understanding Great expectations | pages = 136 | isbn = 978-0-313-29940-7 | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = Westport, Conn. | oclc = 41488673 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leslie, Frank, Frank Leslie, and Ellery Sedgwick. 1876.

Scotland has several traditions of persons boiled to death. For example, in 1222, with the consent of [[Jon Haraldsson]], the "Bloody Earl" of [[Orkney]], the bishop of [[Caithness]] [[Adam of Melrose]] and a monk named Surlo, are said to have been boiled to death by angry husbandmen over the bishop's aggressive means of collecting tithes. [[Alexander II of Scotland|Alexander II]] is said to have executed upwards to eighty persons as a punishment for the crime,  and the earl fled his lands.&lt;ref&gt;Pinkerton: "[https://books.google.com/books?id=mFJBAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA158 A General Collection of the Best and Most Interesting Voyages], Volume 3", London 1809, p.158 The same tradition is transmitted in {{Cite book | last =Journal| first =| year =1842| title = The Scottish journal of topography, antiquities, traditions| pages =248| isbn = | publisher = Stevenson and Menzies| location =Edinburgh| oclc =}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Melrose Chronicle]], Adam of Melrose was "burned alive", rather than boiled, and Alexander III executed up to 400.&lt;ref&gt;''Soc.

The nobles are said each to have taken a spoonful of the brew afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=6NE9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA34 The new statistical account of Scotland, Volum 18]", Edinburgh 1838, pp.34-35&lt;/ref&gt;

Boiling as an execution method was also used for [[counterfeiter]]s, [[swindler]]s and [[forger|coin forger]]s during the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Monter|first=E. William |title=A bewitched duchy: Lorraine and its dukes, 1477-1736|publisher=Librairie Droz|year=2007|page=163|ISBN=978-2-600-01165-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[Holy Roman Empire]], for example, being boiled to death in oil is recorded for [[forger|coin forgers]] and extremely grave murderers. In 1392, a man was boiled alive in Nuremberg for having raped and murdered his own mother.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, M.M: "[https://books.google.com/books?id=HS1BAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA102 Kleine Chronik der Reichsstadt Nürnberg: Mit einem Grundrisse], Nuremberg 1847 p.102,&lt;/ref&gt; Coin forgers were boiled to death in 1452 in [[Danzig]]&lt;ref&gt;Krüger, J.G: "[https://books.google.com/books?id=RnMAAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA20 Die beglückte und geschmückte Stadt Lübeck]", 1697, p.20&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1471 in [[Stralsund]].&lt;ref&gt;
Klemptzen, N.von:"[https://books.google.com/books?id=OldFAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA37 Nicolaus Klemzen vom Pommer-lande und dessen fürsten geschlecht-beschreibung]", Stralsund 1771, p.39&lt;/ref&gt; Even as late as in 1687, a man was boiled to death in oil in [[Bremen]] for having been of valuable help to some coin forgers who had escaped justice.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=BnIDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA116 Blätter für literarische Unterhaltung, Volum 1], p.116, review of "Taschenbuch für vaterländische Geschichte", Berlin 1843&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Dutch town of [[Deventer]], the kettle that was used for boiling criminals to death can still be seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetware.com/deventer/weigh-house-nl-ov-dwh.htm|title=10 Top Tourist Attractions in Arnhem &amp; Easy Day Trips - PlanetWare|author=|date=|website=planetware.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===
[[File:Excecution of Goemon Ishikawa.jpg|thumb|upright|Bandit [[Ishikawa Goemon]] was boiled to death for the attempted assassination of warlord [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] in 16th-century Japan.]]
In 16th-century Japan, the semi-legendary Japanese bandit [[Ishikawa Goemon]] was boiled alive in a large iron kettle-shaped bathtub.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pixelmap.ca/gallery2/rumi/japan_2010/IMG_2189.jpg.html Goemonburo - Goemon-style bath] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706193636/http://www.pixelmap.ca/gallery2/rumi/japan_2010/IMG_2189.jpg.html |date=July 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His public execution, which might have included his entire family, was done after he failed to kill warlord [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]].

In 1675, a [[Sikh]] [[martyr]], called [[Bhai Dayala]], was boiled to death in [[Delhi]] after he refused to accept [[Islam]]. He was put into a [[cauldron]] full of cold water which was then heated to boiling point. Sikh scriptures record that Dayala recited the [[Japji]] of [[Guru Nanak]] and the [[Sukhmani]] of [[Guru Arjan]] as he died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singha|first=H. S |title=The encyclopedia of Sikhism|publisher=Hemkunt Press|year=2000|page=56|ISBN=978-81-7010-301-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern times===
The government of [[Uzbekistan]] under [[Islam Karimov]] has been alleged to have boiled suspected terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Uzbekistan: Two Brutal Deaths in Custody|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/08/09/uzbekistan-two-brutal-deaths-custody|accessdate=6 January 2015|publisher=Hrw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2004 document from [[US Department of State]], the following is written:{{quote|During the year, there were no developments or investigations in the following 2002 deaths in custody: Mirzakomil Avazov and Khusnuddin Olimov, members of [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] who were tortured to death in [[Jaslyk Prison]] in [[Karakalpakstan]] resulting in extensive bruises and burns, the latter reportedly caused by immersion in boiling water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2003/27873.htm|title=Uzbekistan|author=|date=|website=state.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}Former ISIS commander Abu Abboud al-Raqqawi referred to ISIS' brutal execution methods, among others, boiling prisoners alive in engine oil:

{{quote|Some people were boiled alive in oil. Engine oil. They burned wood on a fire for an hour before throwing the victim into boiling oil. It's the Tunisians who were responsible for that.[https://www.expressen.se/nyheter/qs/avhoppade-ledaren-talar-ut-om-livet-med-is/]}}

==Depictions in Western culture==
Early reports of [[cannibals]] from islands in the Pacific, such as [[Fiji]] or [[Papua New Guinea]], killing western [[Christian missionaries]] were assumed to involve some form of boiling alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thatsweird.net/news19.shtml|title=Villagers apologize for cannibal ancestors eating missionary: Weird News, Strange But True Stories, Odd Facts, Bizarre|author=|date=|website=www.thatsweird.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; This became a fertile ground for film makers and especially cartoonists, whose clichéd depiction of tourists or missionaries sitting restrained in a large cauldron above a wood fire and surrounded by bone-nosed tribesmen was a staple of popular magazines and film for decades. Examples include the dream sequence in the movie ''[[Bagdad Café]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiefilm.com/cookbook/encyclopedia/ecmB.html|title=Encyclopedia of Cannibal Movies: B|first=Satellite Ground|last=Systems|date=|website=www.indiefilm.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41444">A '''Dyson sphere''' is a hypothetical [[megastructure]] that completely encompasses a [[star]] and captures a large percentage of its power output. The concept is a [[thought experiment]] that attempts to explain how a spacefaring civilization would meet its energy requirements once those requirements exceed what can be generated from the home planet's resources alone. Only a fraction of a star's energy emissions reach the surface of any orbiting planet. Building structures encircling a star would enable a civilization to harvest far more energy.

The first contemporary description of the structure was by [[Olaf Stapledon]] in his science fiction novel ''[[Star Maker]]'' (1937), in which he described "every solar system... surrounded by a gauze of light traps, which focused the escaping solar energy for intelligent use."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tate|first1=Karl|title=Dyson Spheres: How Advanced Alien Civilizations Would Conquer the Galaxy|url=https://www.space.com/24276-dyson-spheres-how-advanced-alien-civilizations-would-conquer-the-galaxy-infographic.html|website=space.com|accessdate=January 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was later popularized by [[Freeman Dyson]] in his 1960 paper "Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of [[Infrared Radiation]]".&lt;ref name="search"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|year= 1960 |url=http://www.islandone.org/LEOBiblio/SETI1.HTM |title=Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infra-Red Radiation|author= [[Freeman Dyson|Freemann J. Dyson]]|pages= 1667–1668 |volume =131 |doi= 10.1126/science.131.3414.1667|pmid=17780673|issue=3414|bibcode = 1960Sci...131.1667D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dyson speculated that such structures would be the logical consequence of the escalating energy needs of a technological civilization and would be a necessity for its long-term survival. He proposed that searching for such structures could lead to the detection of advanced, intelligent [[extraterrestrial life]]. Different types of Dyson spheres and their energy-harvesting ability would correspond to levels of technological advancement on the [[Kardashev scale]].

Since then, other variant designs involving building an artificial structure or series of structures to encompass a star have been proposed in [[exploratory engineering]] or described in [[science fiction]] under the name "Dyson sphere". These later proposals have not been limited to solar-power stations, with many involving [[space habitat|habitation]] or [[industry|industrial]] elements. Most fictional depictions describe a solid [[#Dyson shell|shell of matter]] enclosing a star, which is considered{{By whom|date=July 2018}} the least plausible variant of the idea. In May 2013, at the Starship Century Symposium in San Diego, Dyson repeated his comments that he wished the concept had not been named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://starshipconf.ucsd.edu/|title=STARSHIP CENTURY SYMPOSIUM, MAY 21 - 22, 2013|date=7 July 2013|publisher=|accessdate=31 August 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130707123030/http://starshipconf.ucsd.edu/|archivedate=7 July 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin of concept ==
{{see also|Energy development}}
[[File:Freeman Dyson.jpg|thumb|upright|Freeman Dyson]]
The concept of the Dyson sphere was the result of a [[thought experiment]] by physicist and mathematician [[Freeman Dyson]], when he theorized that all technological civilizations constantly increased their demand for energy. He reasoned that if human civilization expanded energy demands long enough, there would come a time when it demanded the ''total'' energy output of the [[Sun]]. He proposed a system of orbiting structures (which he referred to initially as a ''shell'') designed to intercept and collect all energy produced by the Sun. Dyson's proposal did not detail how such a system would be constructed, but focused only on issues of energy collection, on the basis that such a structure could be distinguished by its unusual emission spectrum in comparison to a star. His 1960 paper "Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infra-Red Radiation", published in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', is credited with being the first to formalize the concept of the Dyson sphere.&lt;ref name="search"/&gt;

However, Dyson was not the first to advance this idea.  He was inspired by the mention of the concept in the 1937 [[science fiction]] novel ''[[Star Maker]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Disturbing the Universe |last=Dyson |first=Freeman |year=1979 |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=0-465-01677-4 |page=211 |quote=Some science fiction writers have wrongly given me the credit of inventing the artificial biosphere. In fact, I took the idea from Olaf Stapledon, one of their own colleagues}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Olaf Stapledon]], and possibly by the works of [[J. D. Bernal]], [[Raymond Z. Gallun]], and [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], who seem to have explored similar concepts in their work.&lt;ref name = dsfaq-as-first-2012-01&gt;{{Cite web

== Feasibility ==
Although such megastructures may be theoretically possible, all plans to build a fixed-in-place Dyson sphere are currently far beyond humanity's engineering capacity. The number of craft required to obtain, transmit, and maintain a complete Dyson sphere far exceeds present-day industrial capabilities. [[George Dvorsky]] has advocated use of [[self-replicating robots]] to overcome this limitation in the relatively near term.&lt;ref name=dvorsky2012&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sentientdevelopments.com/2012/03/how-to-build-dyson-sphere-in-five.html |title=How to build a Dyson sphere in five (relatively) easy steps |last1=Dvorsky |first1=George |date=2012-03-20 |access-date=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have suggested that such habitats could be built around [[white dwarf]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |title=Dyson Spheres around White Dwarfs|eprint=1503.04376|last1=Semiz|first1=İbrahim|last2=Oğur|first2=Salim|class=physics.pop-ph|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even [[Pulsar|pulsars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Osmanov | first1 = Z. | year = 2015| title = On the search for artificial Dyson-like structures around pulsars | arxiv = 1505.05131| journal = Int.

== Variants ==
In fictional accounts, the Dyson-sphere concept is often interpreted as an artificial hollow [[sphere]] of [[matter]] around a star. This perception is based on a literal interpretation of Dyson's original short paper introducing the concept. In response to letters prompted by some papers, Dyson replied, "A solid shell or ring surrounding a star is mechanically impossible. The form of 'biosphere' which I envisaged consists of a loose collection or swarm of objects traveling on independent orbits around the star."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal= [[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume= 132|year= 1960|pages= 250–253|title= Letters and Response, Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infrared Radiation|author= [[Freeman Dyson|F. J. Dyson]], J. Maddox, P. Anderson, E. A. Sloane|doi= 10.1126/science.132.3421.252-a|pmid= 17748945| issue= 3421}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dyson swarm ===
[[File:Dyson Ring.PNG|thumb|A '''Dyson ring'''—the simplest form of the Dyson swarm—to scale. Orbit is 1 [[Astronomical unit|AU]] in radius, collectors are 1.0{{e|7}} km in diameter (10 [[Gigametre|Gm]] or ≈25 times the [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|Earth–Moon distance]]), spaced 3 degrees from center to center around the orbital circle.]]
[[File:Dyson Swarm.png|thumb|A relatively simple arrangement of multiple Dyson rings of the type pictured above, to form a more complex Dyson swarm. Rings' orbital radii are spaced 1.5{{e|7}} km with regard to one another, but average orbital radius is still 1 [[Astronomical unit|AU]]. Rings are rotated 15 degrees relative to one another, around a common axis of rotation.]]

The variant closest to Dyson's original conception is the "Dyson swarm". It consists of a large number of independent constructs (usually [[solar power satellite]]s and [[Space colonization|space habitats]]) orbiting in a dense formation around the star. This construction approach has advantages: components could be sized appropriately, and it can be constructed incrementally.&lt;ref name="canbuild"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/dysonFAQ.html#BUILT| title= Dyson FAQ: Can a Dyson sphere be built using realistic technology? | accessdate=2006-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various forms of [[wireless energy transfer]] could be used to transfer energy between swarm components and a planet.

Disadvantages resulting from the nature of [[Astrodynamics|orbital mechanics]] would make the arrangement of the orbits of the swarm extremely complex. The simplest such arrangement is the ''Dyson ring'', in which all such structures share the same orbit. More-complex patterns with more rings would intercept more of the star's output, but would result in some constructs eclipsing others periodically when their orbits overlap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Tech/Megascale/dyson_page.html|title= Some Sketches of Dyson Spheres|accessdate= 2007-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another potential problem is that the increasing loss of orbital stability when adding more elements increases the probability of orbital perturbations.

As noted [[Dyson sphere#Search for megastructures|below]], such a cloud of collectors would alter the light emitted by the star system. However, the disruption compared to a star's overall natural emitted spectrum would most likely be too small for Earth-based astronomers to observe.&lt;ref name="search"/&gt;

=== Dyson bubble ===
[[File:Dyson Bubble.png|thumb|A '''Dyson bubble''': an arrangement of [[statite]]s around a star, in a non-orbital pattern. As long as a satellite has an unobstructed line-of-sight to its star, it can hover at any point in space near its star. This relatively simple arrangement is only one of an infinite number of possible statite configurations, and is meant as a contrast for a Dyson swarm only. Statites are pictured as the same size as the collectors pictured above, and arranged at a uniform 1 [[Astronomical unit|AU]] distance from the star.
]]

A second type of Dyson sphere is the "Dyson bubble". It would be similar to a Dyson swarm, composed of many independent constructs and likewise could be constructed incrementally.

Unlike the Dyson swarm, the constructs making it up are not in orbit around the star, but would be [[statite]]s—satellites suspended by use of enormous [[light sail]]s using [[radiation pressure]] to counteract the star's pull of gravity. Such constructs would not be in danger of collision or of eclipsing one another; they would be totally stationary with regard to the star, and independent of one another. Because the ratio of [[radiation pressure]] to the force of gravity from a star is constant regardless of the distance (provided the statite has an unobstructed line-of-sight to the surface of its star&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/Numbers/Math/Mathematical_Thinking/sunlight_exerts_pressure.htm| title= Sunlight Exerts Pressure| accessdate=2006-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;), such statites could also vary their distance from their central star.

The practicality of this approach is questionable with modern [[material science]], but cannot yet be ruled out. A 100% reflective statite deployed around the Sun would have an overall [[density]] of 0.78 grams per square meter of sail.&lt;ref name="stable"/&gt; To illustrate the low mass of the required materials, consider that the total mass of a bubble of such material 1 AU in radius would be about 2.17{{e|20}} kg, which is about the same mass as the asteroid [[2 Pallas|Pallas]].&lt;ref name="FAQ enough"/&gt; Another illustration: Regular printing [[paper]] has a density of around 80 g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

Such a material has not yet been produced in the form of a working light sail. The lightest carbon-fiber [[light sail|light-sail]] material currently produced has a density—without payload—of 3 g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, or about four times as heavy as would be needed to construct a solar statite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/technology/carbonsail_000302.html |title=SPACE.com Exclusive: Breakthrough In Solar Sail Technology |first=Greg |last=Clark |publisher=Space.com |year=2000 |accessdate=2006-03-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060114020015/http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/technology/carbonsail_000302.html |archivedate=2006-01-14 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A single sheet of [[graphene]], the two-dimensional form of carbon, has a density of only 0.37&amp;nbsp;mg per square meter,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Mitali | last = Kakran | contribution = Graphene: The New Wonder Material!!! | title = IET present around the world | date = 2011 | url = http://conferences.theiet.org/patw/-documents/mitali-kakran-slides.cfm | format = PDF | accessdate = 2013-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; making such a single sheet of graphene possibly effective as a solar sail. However, as of 2015 graphene has not been fabricated in large sheets, and it has a relatively high rate of radiation absorption, about 2.3% (i.e., still about 97.7% will be transmitted).&lt;ref name="Graphene properties"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.graphene-battery.net/graphene-properties.htm |title=Graphene properties | publisher=www.graphene-battery.net | date=2014-05-29 |accessdate=2014-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite arxiv |eprint=1201.3071|last1=Apell|first1=S. P|title=High optical absorption in graphene|last2=Hanson|first2=G. W|last3=Hägglund|first3=C|class=physics.optics|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   For frequencies in the upper GHz and lower THz range, the absorption rate is as high as 50–100% due to voltage bias and/or doping.&lt;ref name="Graphene properties"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Ultra-light [[carbon nanotube]]s meshed through [[molecular manufacturing]] techniques have densities between 1.3 g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to 1.4 g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. By the time a civilization is ready to use this technology, the [[carbon nanotube]]'s manufacturing might be optimised enough for them to have a density lower than the necessary 0.7 g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and the average sail density with [[rigging]] might be kept to 0.3 g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (a "[[Solar sail#Investigated sail designs|spin stabilized]]" light sail requires minimal additional mass in [[rigging]]). If such a sail could be constructed at this [[areal density]], a [[space habitat]] the size of the [[L5 Society]]'s proposed [[O'Neill cylinder]]—500&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, with room for over 1 million inhabitants, massing 3{{e|6}} [[ton]]s—could be supported by a circular light sail 3,000&amp;nbsp;km in diameter, with a combined sail/habitat mass of 5.4{{e|9}} kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://thespacereview.com/article/317/1| title=The Space Review: The high risk frontier | first=Sam| last=Dinkin| publisher=Thespacereview.com| year=2006| accessdate=2006-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; For comparison, this is just slightly smaller than the diameter of [[Jupiter]]'s moon [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] (although the sail is a flat disc, not a sphere), or the distance between [[San Francisco]] and [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]]. Such a structure would, however, have a mass quite a lot less than many asteroids. Although the construction of such a massive habitable statite would be a gigantic undertaking, and the required material science behind it is early stage, there are other engineering feats and required materials proposed in other Dyson sphere variants.

In theory, if enough satellites were created and deployed around their star, they would compose a non-rigid version of the Dyson shell mentioned below. Such a shell would not suffer from the drawbacks of massive compressive pressure, nor are the mass requirements of such a shell as high as the rigid form. Such a shell would, however, have the same optical and thermal properties as the rigid form, and would be detected by searchers in a similar fashion (see [[#Search for extra-terrestrial intelligence|below]]).

=== Dyson shell ===
[[Image:Dyson Sphere Diagram-en.svg|thumb|A cut-away diagram of an idealized Dyson shell, a variant on Dyson's original concept, with a radius of 1 [[Astronomical unit|AU]]]]
The variant of the Dyson sphere most often [[Dyson spheres in fiction|depicted in fiction]] is the "Dyson shell": a uniform solid shell of matter around the star.&lt;ref name="what"/&gt; Such a structure would completely alter the emissions of the central star, and would intercept 100% of the star's energy output. Such a structure would also provide an immense surface that many envision would be used for habitation, if the surface could be made habitable.

A spherical shell Dyson sphere in the Solar System with a radius of one [[astronomical unit]], so that the interior surface would receive the same amount of sunlight as Earth does per unit [[solid angle]], would have a surface area of approximately {{convert|2.8e17|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}, or about 550 million times the surface area of Earth. This would intercept the full 384.6 [[yotta]][[watt]]s (3.846 × 10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; watts)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/sunfact.html|title=NASA Sun Fact Sheet|accessdate=2011-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Sun's output. Non-shell designs would intercept less, but the shell variant represents the maximum possible energy captured for the Solar System at this point of the Sun's [[stellar evolution|evolution]].&lt;ref name="what"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/dysonFAQ.html#WHAT| title= Dyson FAQ: What is a Dyson Sphere? | accessdate=2007-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is approximately 33 [[10^18|trillion]] times the power consumption of humanity in 1998, which was 12 terawatts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/sustainable/oomm.html|title=Order of Magnitude Morality|accessdate=2007-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several serious theoretical difficulties with the solid shell variant of the Dyson sphere:

Such a shell would have no net gravitational interaction with its englobed star (see [[shell theorem]]), and could drift in relation to the central star. If such movements went uncorrected, they could eventually result in a collision between the sphere and the star—most likely with disastrous results. Such structures would need either some form of propulsion to counteract any drift, or some way to repel the surface of the sphere away from the star.&lt;ref name="stable"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/dysonFAQ.html#STABLE|title=Dyson Sphere FAQ: Is a Dyson sphere stable?|accessdate=2007-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the same reason, such a shell would have no net gravitational interaction with anything else inside it. The contents of any biosphere placed on the inner surface of a Dyson shell would not be attracted to the sphere's surface and would simply fall into the star. It has been proposed that a biosphere could be contained between two concentric spheres, placed on the interior of a rotating sphere (in which case, the force of artificial "gravity" is perpendicular to the axis of rotation, causing all matter placed on the interior of the sphere to pool around the equator, effectively rendering the sphere a [[Niven ring]] for purposes of habitation, but still fully effective as a radiant-energy collector) or placed on the outside of the sphere where it would be held in place by the star's gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Todd|last=Drashner|author2=Steve Bowers |author3=Mike Parisi |author4=M.

If assuming a radius of one [[Astronomical unit|AU]], then the compressive strength of the material forming the sphere would have to be immense to prevent implosion due to the star's gravity. Any arbitrarily selected point on the surface of the sphere can be viewed as being under the pressure of the base of a dome 1 AU in height under the Sun's gravity at that distance. Indeed, it can be viewed as being at the base of an infinite number of arbitrarily selected domes, but because much of the force from any one arbitrary dome is counteracted by those of another, the net force on that point is immense, but finite. No known or theorized material is strong enough to withstand this pressure, and form a rigid, static sphere around a star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/dysonFAQ.html#STRENGTH| title= Dyson FAQ: How strong does a rigid Dyson shell need to be? | accessdate=2006-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed by [[Paul Birch (writer)|Paul Birch]] (in relation to smaller "Supra-Jupiter" constructions around a large planet rather than a star) that it may be possible to support a Dyson shell by dynamic means similar to those used in a [[space fountain]].&lt;ref&gt;Search [https://archive.org/web/web.php WaybackMachine] for the 14th of June 2011 copy of  &lt;nowiki&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paulbirch.net/SupramundanePlanets.zip |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-03-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060627074700/http://www.paulbirch.net/SupramundanePlanets.zip |archivedate=2006-06-27 |df= }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Masses travelling in circular tracks on the inside of the sphere, at velocities significantly greater than orbital velocity, would press outwards on [[magnetic bearing]]s due to [[centrifugal force]]. For a Dyson shell of 1-AU radius around a star with the same mass as the Sun, a mass travelling ten times the orbital velocity (297.9&amp;nbsp;km/s) would support 99 (a=v&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/r) times its own mass in additional shell structure.

Also if assuming a radius of one AU, then there may not be sufficient building material in the Solar System to construct a Dyson shell. [[Anders Sandberg]] estimates that there is 1.82{{e|26}} kg of easily usable building material in the Solar System, enough for a 1-AU shell with a mass of 600&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;—about 8–20&amp;nbsp;cm thick on average, depending on the density of the material. This includes the hard-to-access cores of the gas giants; the inner planets alone provide only 11.79{{e|24}} kg, enough for a 1-AU shell with a mass of just 42&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="FAQ enough"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/dysonFAQ.html#ENOUGH| title= Is there enough matter in the Solar System to build a Dyson shell?| work=Dyson Sphere FAQ| first=Anders| last= Sandberg| accessdate=2006-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shell would be vulnerable to impacts from interstellar bodies, such as [[comet]]s, [[meteoroid]]s, and material in [[interstellar space]] that is currently being deflected by the Sun's [[bow shock]]. The [[heliosphere]], and any protection it theoretically provides, would cease to exist.

=== Other types ===

==== Dyson net ====
Another possibility is the "Dyson net", a web of cables strung about the star that could have power or heat collection units strung between the cables. The Dyson net reduces to a special case of Dyson shell or bubble, however, depending on how the cables are supported against the sun's gravity.

==== Bubbleworld ====
A bubbleworld is an artificial construct that consists of a shell of living space around a sphere of hydrogen gas. The shell contains air, people, houses, furniture, etc. The idea was conceived to answer the question, "What is the largest space colony that can be built?"&lt;ref name = "tuwyau"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/dysonFAQ.html#OTHER| title= Other Dyson Sphere-Like Concepts| work=Dyson Sphere FAQ| first=Anders| last= Sandberg| accessdate=2006-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most of the volume is not habitable and there is no power source.

Theoretically, any [[gas giant]] could be enclosed in a solid shell; at a certain radius the surface gravity would be terrestrial, and energy could be provided by tapping the thermal energy of the planet.&lt;ref name = "tuwyau"/&gt; This concept is explored peripherally in the novel ''[[Accelerando (book)|Accelerando]]'' (and the short story ''Curator'', which is incorporated into the novel as a chapter) by [[Charles Stross]], in which [[Saturn]] is converted into a human-habitable world.

==== Stellar engine ====
[[Stellar engine]]s are a class of hypothetical [[megastructure]]s whose purpose is to extract useful energy from a star, sometimes for specific purposes. For example, [[Matrioshka brain]]s extract energy for purposes of computation; [[Stellar engine#Class A (Shkadov thruster)|Shkadov thrusters]] extract energy for purposes of propulsion. Some of the proposed stellar engine designs are based on the Dyson sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/S/stellar_engine.html|title=Stellar engine|work=The Internet Encyclopedia of Science|accessdate=2007-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[black hole]] could be the power source instead of a star in order to increase the matter-to-energy conversion efficiency. A black hole would also be smaller than a star. This would decrease communication distances that would be important for computer-based societies as those described above.&lt;ref name = "tuwyau"/&gt;

== Search for megastructures ==
In Dyson's original paper, he speculated that sufficiently advanced extraterrestrial civilizations would likely follow a similar power-consumption pattern to that of humans, and would eventually build their own sphere of collectors. Constructing such a system would make such a civilization a Type II [[Kardashev scale|Kardashev civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Nikolai Kardashev|Kardashev, Nikolai]]. "[http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1985IAUS..112..497K On the Inevitability and the Possible Structures of Supercivilizations]", The search for extraterrestrial life: Recent developments; Proceedings of the Symposium, Boston, MA, June 18–21, 1984 (A86-38126 17–88). Dordrecht, D. Reidel Publishing Co., 1985, p. 497–504.&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of such a system of collectors would alter the light emitted from the star system. Collectors would absorb and reradiate energy from the star.&lt;ref name="search"/&gt; The wavelength(s) of radiation emitted by the collectors would be determined by the [[emission spectrum|emission spectra]] of the substances making them up, and the temperature of the collectors. Because it seems most likely that these collectors would be made up of heavy elements not normally found in the emission spectra of their central star—or at least not radiating light at such relatively "low" energies compared to what they would be emitting as energetic free nuclei in the [[stellar atmosphere]]—there would be atypical wavelengths of light for the star's [[spectral type]] in the light spectrum emitted by the star system. If the percentage of the star's output thus filtered or transformed by this absorption and reradiation was significant, it could be detected at interstellar distances.&lt;ref name="search"/&gt;

Given the amount of energy available per square meter at a distance of 1 [[Astronomical unit|AU]] from the [[Sun]], it is possible to calculate that most known substances would be reradiating energy in the [[infrared]] part of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. Thus, a Dyson sphere, constructed by life forms not dissimilar to humans, who dwelled in proximity to a [[Solar analog|Sun-like star]], made with materials similar to those available to humans, would most likely cause an increase in the amount of infrared radiation in the star system's emitted spectrum. Hence, Dyson selected the title "Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infrared Radiation" for his published paper.&lt;ref name="search"/&gt;

[[SETI]] has adopted these assumptions in their search, looking for such "infrared heavy" spectra from [[solar analog]]s. {{As of|2005}} [[Fermilab]] has an ongoing survey for such spectra by analyzing data from the [[IRAS|Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://home.fnal.gov/~carrigan/infrared_astronomy/Fermilab_search.htm| title=Fermilab Dyson Sphere search program| year=2006| accessdate=2006-03-02| first=D.| last=Carrigan| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060306222359/http://home.fnal.gov/~carrigan/Infrared_Astronomy/Fermilab_search.htm| archive-date=2006-03-06| dead-url=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=January 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Shostak |first=Seth |date=Spring 2009 |journal=Engineering &amp; Science |title=When Will We Find the Extraterrestrials? |volume=72 |number=1 |pages=12–21 |issn=0013-7812 |url=http://archive.seti.org/pdfs/Shostak-spring2009-EnS.pdf &lt;!-- permalink to official source with abstract &amp; alternate PDF link: http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechES:72.1.Extraterrestrials --&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415115307/http://archive.seti.org/pdfs/Shostak-spring2009-EnS.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Identifying one of the many infrared sources as a Dyson sphere would require improved techniques for discriminating between a Dyson sphere and natural sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Dyson_sphere|title=''Dyson sphere'' at Scholarpedia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fermilab discovered 17 potential "ambiguous" candidates, of which four have been named "amusing but still questionable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://home.fnal.gov/~carrigan/Infrared_Astronomy/Fermilab_search.htm| title=Fermilab Dyson Sphere search program| year=2012| accessdate=2012-01-15| first=D.| last=Carrigan| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060306222359/http://home.fnal.gov/~carrigan/Infrared_Astronomy/Fermilab_search.htm| archive-date=2006-03-06| dead-url=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=January 2016}} Other searches also resulted in several candidates, which are, however, unconfirmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dick Carrigan |url=http://home.fnal.gov/~carrigan/infrared_astronomy/Other_searches.htm |title=Dyson Sphere Searches |publisher=Home.fnal.gov |date=2010-12-16 |accessdate=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/alien-supercivilizations-absent-from-100-000-nearby-galaxies|title=Alien Supercivilizations Absent from 100,000 Nearby Galaxies|first=Lee|last=Billings|publisher=|accessdate=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="econ2015"&gt;{{Cite web

===Postulated sightings===
On 14 October 2015, the realization of a strange pattern of light from star [[KIC 8462852]], nicknamed "Tabby's Star" after [[Tabetha S. Boyajian]] — the lead researcher who discovered the irregular light fluctuation— captured by the [[Kepler Space Telescope]], raised speculation that a Dyson sphere may have been discovered.&lt;ref name="ATL-20151013"&gt;{{cite web| last1=Andersen| first1=Ross| title=The Most Mysterious Star in Our Galaxy| url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2015/10/the-most-interesting-star-in-our-galaxy/410023/ |date=13 October 2015 |work=[[The Atlantic]]| accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IND-20151015"&gt;{{cite web| last1=Williams| first1=Lee| title=Astronomers may have found giant alien 'megastructures' orbiting star near the Milky Way| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/forget-water-on-mars-astronomers-may-have-just-found-giant-alien-megastructures-orbiting-a-star-near-a6693886.html |date=15 October 2015 |work=[[The Independent]]| accessdate=15 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In February 2016, Boyajian gave a [[TED (Conference)|TED talk]] where she explained the story of how her research on the star quickly took a turn into the mysterious. However, she was skeptical and in the talk she reminded everyone that skepticism is the best policy whenever delving into alien territory. Her exact quote is as follows:

{{quote|Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and it is my job, my responsibility, as an astronomer to remind people that alien hypotheses should always be a last resort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Most Mysterious Star in the Universe |url=https://www.ted.com/talks/tabetha_boyajian_the_most_mysterious_star_in_the_universe |date= February 2016 |work= [[TED (Conference)]] |accessdate=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Wanting to understand the strange light pattern, [[Tabetha S. Boyajian]] put several hypotheses to the test. The first general assumption was an exoplanet [[Transit (astronomy)|transiting]] (eclipsing) its massive star, but the dips in light lasted between 5 and 80 days and were erratically spaced apart, thus ruling out any kind of an orbit for one celestial object.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1509.03622 |last1=Boyajian |first1=T. S |title=Planet Hunters X. KIC 8462852 - Where's the Flux? |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=457 |issue=4 |pages=3988 |last2=LaCourse |first2=D.

A dust cloud was proposed but the star showed no signs of being young so a dust cloud was highly improbable. Lastly, a comet shower was hypothesized. However, as Boyajian pointed out in her TED talk this was also highly improbable. 
"It would take hundreds of comets to reproduce what we're observing. And these are only the comets that happen to pass between us and the star. And so in reality, we're talking thousands to tens of thousands of comets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Most Mysterious Star in the Universe |url=https://www.ted.com/talks/tabetha_boyajian_the_most_mysterious_star_in_the_universe/transcript#t-429568 |date= February 2016 |work= [[TED (Conference)]] |accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So after all the natural explanations turned up weak, her team decided to send off their research to SETI ([[Search for extraterrestrial life]]) to rule out alien structures. After reviewing the research, the [[SETI Institute]] was so intrigued that they decided to study the star themselves and pointed their [[Allen Telescope Array]] (ATA) at the star "with hopes of catching a tell-tale signal that might reveal a technological civilization."&lt;ref name='SETI 2017'&gt;{{cite web|title=What's Up with Tabby's Star? |url=https://www.seti.org/whats-up-with-tabby-star | date=23 May 2017 | work= [[Search for extraterrestrial life]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[SETI Institute]] mentioned that what caught their interest was that "the timing of the present dip (in light) suggests that whatever this material is, it is situated at just the right distance from the star to be in the [[Circumstellar habitable zone|habitable zone]], where we believe life like ours could develop as it has on Earth."&lt;ref name='SETI 2017'/&gt;

Being skeptical as Boyajian was, she finally decided to take SETI's approach and allow herself to have a bit of fun in hypothesizing what the light pattern could have been. In her Ted Talk she joked: "Another idea that's one of my personal favorites is that we had just witnessed an interplanetary space battle and the catastrophic destruction of a planet. Now, I admit that this would produce a lot of dust that we don't observe. But if we're already invoking aliens in this explanation, then who is to say they didn't efficiently clean up all this mess for recycling purposes?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Most Mysterious Star in the Universe| url=https://www.ted.com/talks/tabetha_boyajian_the_most_mysterious_star_in_the_universe/transcript |date= February 2016|work= [[TED (Conference)]] |accessdate=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The search for answers to [[KIC 8462852]] is still ongoing.

On August 25, 2016, a similar phenomenon was reported for another stellar object: [[EPIC 204278916]],&lt;ref name='EPIC'&gt;{{cite journal|title=The peculiar dipping events in the disk-bearing young-stellar object EPIC 204278916|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume=463|issue=2|pages=2265|arxiv=1608.07291|bibcode = 2016MNRAS.463.2265S |doi = 10.1093/mnras/stw2155 |year=2016|last1=Scaringi|first1=S|last2=Manara|first2=C.

Dimmings of up to 65% for 25 consecutive days (out of 79 total observation) were observed. The variability is highly periodic and attributed to stellar rotation.&lt;ref name='EPIC'/&gt; The researchers hypothesize that the irregular dimmings are caused by either a warped inner-disk edge or transiting cometary-like objects in either circular or eccentric orbits.&lt;ref name='EPIC'/&gt;

'''Eggshell and protein membrane separation''' is a [[recycling]] process. Nearly 30% of the [[Egg (food)|eggs]] consumed each year are broken and processed or powdered into foods such as cakes, mixes, mayonnaise, noodles and fast foods.&lt;ref&gt;Sonenklar C: Famous for Egg Waste. Research/ Penn State 1999, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The US food industry generates 150,000 tons of shell waste a year.&lt;ref name="Hecht"&gt;Hecht J: Eggshells break into collagen market. New Scientist 1999, 161:6-6.&lt;/ref&gt;  The disposal methods for waste [[eggshells]] are 26.6% as fertilizer, 21.1% as animal feed ingredients, 26.3% discarded in municipal dumps, and 15.8% used in other ways.&lt;ref name="Fermented"&gt;Daengprok W, Garnjanagoonchorn W, Mine Y: Fermented pork sausage fortified with commercial or hen eggshell calcium lactate. Meat Science 2002, 62:199-204.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many landfills are unwilling to take the waste because the shells and the attached membrane attract vermin.  Together the calcium carbonate eggshell and protein-rich membrane have no value or use.&lt;ref name="Wei"&gt;Wei Z, Li B, Xu C: Application of waste eggshell as low-cost solid catalyst for biodiesel production [electronic resource]. Bioresource Technology 2009, 100:2883-2885.&lt;/ref&gt;  The invention of an eggshell and membrane separator has allowed for the recycling of these two valuable products.

The rich [[calcium carbonate]] shell has been used in the application for [[Hypocalcaemia|calcium deficiency]] therapies in humans and animals.&lt;ref name="Fermented" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daengrok" /&gt;  A single eggshell has a mass of six grams which yields around 2200&amp;nbsp;mg of calcium.&lt;ref name="Vlad"&gt;Vlad: Eggshell membrane separation method.

=== Food industry ===
Recent applications of eggshells in the form of [[calcium lactate]] has been used as a firming agent, a [[flavor enhancer]], a flavoring agent, a [[leavening agent]], a nutrient supplement, a stabilizer, and thickener.&lt;ref name="Fermented" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daengrok" /&gt;  Eggshells are also used in as a calcium supplement in orange juice.&lt;ref name="Hecht" /&gt;

=== Other issues ===
Eggshells have been incorporated into [[fertilizer]]s as a [[soil conditioner]].&lt;ref name="Fermented" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Yoo"&gt;Yoo S, Kokoszka J, Zou P, Hsieh JS: Utilization of calcium carbonate particles from eggshell waste as coating pigments for ink-jet printing paper [electronic resource].

== Methods ==
=== Non-chemical separators ===
Joseph H. MacNeil, Professor of Food Science at [[Penn State University]], developed a machine that uses a delicate multi-bladed knife to scrape the membrane from the surface of shell fragments.&lt;ref&gt;MacNeil JH: Method and apparatus for separating a protein membrane and shell material in waste egg shells. In United States Patent (Foundation TPSR ed., vol. 6,176,376. United States: The Penn State Research Foundation; 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  This invention uses a water-based method to separate the eggshell and [[Membrane protein|protein membrane]]. The two products are processed in two streams to yield mm size particles of dry membrane and mm size particles of dried shell.

Another non-chemical separation technique utilizes steam heat, [[Abrasion (mechanical)|mechanical abrasion]], and a light vacuum to separate the hard eggshell from the protein-containing membranes.&lt;ref name="Adams"&gt;Adams: Egghell membrane separation method.  In US Patent 7,017,277, United States: ESM Technologies, LLC; 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  This invention passes shell fragments obtained from egg-breaking facilities through a series of heated augers.  Once the shell and membrane flakes reach the appropriate moisture content, the vacuum pulls them into a cyclone device.  The cyclonic action further separates the heavier eggshell flakes from the lighter membrane flakes.  This invention has been commercialized and can easily separate multiple metric tons per day, allowing for the production of valuable products including commercial volumes of [[natural eggshell membrane]] or NEM.

Levi New invented a non-chemical and non-thermal separation technique that utilizes airflow to pull egg shells through a venturi.  The material is subjected to pressure waves while passing through the venturi.&lt;ref name="New"&gt;New: Eggshell membrane separation process.  In US Patent 8,448,884 B2, United States; 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  A PulverDryer machine configured with a venturi sized to process egg shell pulverizes the shell component into fine powder and discharges the membrane as an intact dry flake material.  The two components are separated in post processing by a standard shaker screen table, then the membrane is cleaned via one of several standard washing processes, depending on end use.  Up to several tons of egg shell material can be processed per hour.

=== Dissolved air-flotation separation unit ===
The waste eggshells are put into water and then ground to separate the eggshell from the protein membrane.&lt;ref name="Yoo" /&gt;  Then the ground eggshell is placed in a separate vessel where air is injected into the water flow.  The air and water mixture causes the lighter component (protein membrane) to float and the heavier (calcium carbonate eggshells) to sink.  This unit recovers 96% of eggshell membrane and 99% of eggshell calcium carbonate in two hours.&lt;ref name="Yoo" /&gt;

=== Water and acetic acid ===
The inventor of this method is Vladimir Vlad.  The machine uses unseparated eggshells that are placed in a fluid tank, applying [[cavitation]] to separate the eggshell membrane from the eggshell. The fluid tank in this case contains [[distilled water]] and [[acetic acid]] to provide continuous processing. Also this invention has a method for collecting separated eggshells to grind them into an eggshell powder.&lt;ref name="Vlad" /&gt;

'''Environmental assessment'''&lt;section begin=overview /&gt;&lt;!--This paragraph is transcluded to [[Environmental law]] --&gt; ('''EA''') is the assessment of the [[environmental impact|environmental consequences]] (positive and negative) of a plan, policy, program, or actual projects prior to the decision to move forward with the proposed action. In this context, the term "'''environmental impact assessment'''" ('''EIA''') is usually used when applied to actual projects by individuals or companies and the term "[[strategic environmental assessment]]" (SEA) applies to policies, plans and programmes most often proposed by organs of state.&lt;ref&gt;MacKinnon, A.

The purpose of the assessment is to ensure that decision makers consider the environmental impacts when deciding whether or not to proceed with a project. The International Association for Impact Assessment (IAIA) defines an environmental impact assessment as "the process of identifying, predicting, evaluating and mitigating the [[Biophysics|biophysical]], social, and other relevant effects of development proposals prior to major decisions being taken and commitments made".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaia.org/publicdocuments/special-publications/Principles%20of%20IA_web.pdf |title=Principle of Environmental Impact Assessment Best Practice |publisher=International Association for Impact Assessment |date=1999 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507084339/http://www.iaia.org/publicdocuments/special-publications/Principles%20of%20IA_web.pdf |archivedate=2012-05-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; EIAs are unique in that they do not require adherence to a predetermined environmental outcome, but rather they require decision makers to [[environmental full-cost accounting|account for environmental values]] in their decisions and to justify those decisions in light of detailed environmental studies and public comments on the potential environmental impacts.&lt;ref&gt;Holder, J., (2004), Environmental Assessment: The Regulation of Decision Making, Oxford University Press, New York; For a comparative discussion of the elements of various domestic EIA systems, see Christopher Wood Environmental Impact Assessment: A Comparative Review (2 ed, Prentice Hall, Harlow, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Environmental impact assessments commenced in the 1960s, as part of increasing [[environmental awareness]].&lt;ref group=notes&gt;The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]  was established on 2 December 1970, in response to elevated concern about [[environmental pollution]].&lt;/ref&gt; EIAs involved a technical evaluation intended to contribute to more objective decision making. In the United States, environmental impact assessments obtained formal status in 1969, with enactment of the [[National Environmental Policy Act]]. EIAs have been used increasingly around the world. The number of "Environmental Assessments" filed every year "has vastly overtaken the number of more rigorous [[Environmental Impact Statement]]s (EIS)."{{sfn|Clark|Canter|1997|p=199}} An Environmental Assessment is a "mini-EIS designed to provide sufficient information to allow the agency to decide whether the preparation of a full-blown Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is necessary."{{sfn|Rychlak|Case|2010|p=111-120}}{{sfn|Kershner|2011}}
EIA is an activity that is done to find out the impact that would be done before development will occur.

== Methods ==
General and industry specific assessment methods are available including:

* ''Industrial products'' – Product environmental [[life cycle analysis]] (LCA) is used for identifying and measuring the impact of industrial products on the environment. These EIAs consider activities related to extraction of raw materials, ancillary materials, equipment; production, use, disposal and ancillary equipment.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel, S., Tsoulfas, G., Pappis, C., &amp; Rachaniotis, N. (2004) Aggregating and evaluating the results of different Environmental Impact Assessment methods Ecological indicators 4:125–138&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Genetically modified plants'' – Specific methods available to perform EIAs of [[genetically modified organisms]] include GMP-RAM and INOVA.&lt;ref&gt;Hitzschky, K., &amp; Silviera, J. (2009) A proposed impact assessment method for genetically modified plants (As-GMP method) Environmental Impact Assessment review 29: 348–368&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Fuzzy logic]]'' – EIA methods need measurement data to estimate values of impact indicators. However, many of the environment impacts cannot be quantified, e.g. landscape quality, lifestyle quality and social acceptance. Instead information from similar EIAs, expert judgment and community sentiment are employed. Approximate reasoning methods known as fuzzy logic can be used.&lt;ref&gt;Peche, R., &amp; Rodriguez, E., (2009) Environmental impact Assessment procedure: A new approach based on Fuzzy logic Environmental Impact Assessment review 29:275–283&lt;/ref&gt; A fuzzy arithmetic approach has also been proposed&lt;ref&gt;Duarte O. (2000) Técnicas Difusas en la Evaluación de Impacto Ambiental. Ph.D. Thesis, Universidad de Granada&lt;/ref&gt; and implemented using a software tool (TDEIA).&lt;ref&gt;ARAI Research Group, Granada, Spain. [http://arai.ugr.es/eiadifusa/ "Environmental Impact Assessment at University of Granada."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025165732/http://arai.ugr.es/eiadifusa/ |date=2014-10-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Follow-up ==
At the end of the project, an audit evaluates the accuracy of the EIA by comparing actual to predicted impacts. The objective is to make future EIAs more valid and effective. Two primary considerations are:
* ''Scientific'' – to examine the accuracy of predictions and explain errors
* ''Management'' – to assess the success of mitigation in reducing impacts

Audits can be performed either as a rigorous assessment of the [[null hypothesis]] or with a simpler approach comparing what actually occurred against the predictions in the EIA document.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, L., (1998), A Practical Method for Environmental Impact Assessment Audits Environ Impact Assess Rev 18: 59–71&lt;/ref&gt;

After an EIA, the [[Precautionary principle|precautionary]] and [[polluter pays principle]]s may be applied to decide whether to reject, modify or require [[strict liability]] or [[insurance]] coverage to a project, based on predicted harms.

The [[Hydropower Sustainability Assessment Protocol]] is a sector specific method for checking the quality of Environmental and Social assessments and management plans.

== Around the world ==

=== Australia ===

The history of EIA in Australia could be linked to the enactment of the [[National Environmental Policy Act|U.S. National Environment Policy Act]] (NEPA) in 1970, which made the preparation of environmental impact statements a requirement. In Australia, one might say that the EIA procedures were introduced at a State Level prior to that of the Commonwealth (Federal), with a majority of the states having divergent views to the Commonwealth. One of the pioneering states was New South Wales, whose State Pollution Control Commission issued EIA guidelines in 1974. At a Commonwealth (i.e. Federal) level, this was followed by passing of the ''Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974'' (Cth) in 1974. The ''Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999'' (Cth) (EPBC Act) superseded the ''Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974'' (Cth) and is the current central piece for EIA in Australia on a Commonwealth (i.e. Federal) level. An important point to note is that this federal legislation does not override the validity of the States or Territories environmental and development assessments and approvals; rather the EPBC Act runs as a parallel to the State/Territory Systems.&lt;ref name="Elliott"&gt;Elliott, M. &amp; Thomas, I. (2009), "Environment Impact Assessment in Australia: Theory and Practice, 5th Edn, Federation Press, Sydney"&lt;/ref&gt; Overlap between federal and state requirements is addressed via bilateral agreements or one-off accreditation of state processes, as provided for in the EPBC Act.

==== The Commonwealth Level ====

The EPBC Act provides a legal framework to protect and manage nationally and internationally important flora, fauna, ecological communities and heritage places-defined in the EPBC Act as matters of ‘National Environmental Significance’. Following are the nine matters of ‘National Environmental Significance’ to which the EPBC Act applies:&lt;ref name="department" /&gt;

* World Heritage properties;
* National Heritage places;
* Wetlands of international importance (listed under the Ramsar Convention);
* Listed threatened species and ecological communities;
* Migratory species protected under international agreements;
* Commonwealth marine areas;
* the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park;
* Nuclear actions (including uranium mining); and
* Water resources, in relation with coal seam gas development and large coal mining development.

In addition to this, the EPBC Act aims at providing a streamlined national assessment and approval process for activities. These activities could be by the Commonwealth, or its agents, anywhere in the world or activities on Commonwealth land; and activities that are listed as having a ‘significant impact’ on matters of ‘national environment significance'.&lt;ref name="department"&gt;{{citation|publisher=The Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts|location=Australia|title=The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/epbc/|accessdate=9 September 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007230525/http://www.environment.gov.au/epbc/|archivedate=7 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EPBC Act comes into play when a person (a ‘proponent') wants an action (often called a ‘proposal’ or ‘project’) assessed for environmental impacts under the EPBC Act, he or she must refer the project to the Department of the Environment and Energy (Commonwealth). This ‘referral’ is then released to the public, as well as relevant state, territory and Commonwealth ministers, for comment on whether the project is likely to have a significant impact on matters of national environmental significance.&lt;ref name="department" /&gt; The Department of the Environment and Energy assess the process and makes recommendation to the minister or the delegate for the feasibility. The final discretion on the decision remains of the minister, which is not solely based on matters of ‘national environmental significance’ but also the consideration of social and economic impact of the project.&lt;ref name="department" /&gt;

The Australian Government Minister for the Environment and Energy cannot intervene in a proposal if it has no significant impact on one of the eight matters of ‘national environmental significance’ despite the fact that there may be other undesirable environmental impacts.&lt;ref name="department" /&gt; This is primarily due to the division of powers between the States and the Federal government and due to which the Australian Government environment minister cannot overturn a state decision.

There are strict civil and criminal penalties for the breach of EPBC Act. Depending on the kind of breach, civil penalty (maximum) may go up to $550,000 for an individual and $5.5 million for a body corporate, or for criminal penalty (maximum) of seven years imprisonment and/or penalty of $46,200.&lt;ref name="department" /&gt;

==== The State and Territory Level ====

===== Australian Capital Territory (ACT) =====

EIA provisions within Ministerial Authorities in the ACT are found in the Chapters 7 and 8 of the ''Planning and Development Act 2007'' (ACT). EIA in ACT was previously administered with the help of Part 4 of the Land (Planning and Environment) Act 1991 (Land Act) and Territory Plan (plan for land-use).&lt;ref name="Elliott" /&gt;
Note that some EIA may occur in the ACT on Commonwealth land under the EPBC Act (Cth). Further provisions of the ''Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988'' (Cth) may also be applicable particularly to national land and "designated areas".

===== New South Wales (NSW) =====

In New South Wales, the ''Environment Planning and Assessment Act 1979'' (EP&amp;A Act) establishes two pathways for EIA. The first is under Division 5.2 of the EP&amp;A Act, which provides for EIA of 'State Significant Infrastructure' projects (from June 2011, this Part replaced the previous Part 3A, which previously covered EIA of major projects). The second is under Part 4 of the EP&amp;A Act dealing with development assessments for local, regional, and State Significant Developments (other than State Significant Infrastructure).&lt;ref name="Elliott" /&gt;

===== Northern Territory (NT) =====
The EIA process in Northern Territory is chiefly administered under the Environmental Assessment Act (EAA).&lt;ref&gt;The Northern Territory Government, viewed 10 September 2010,&lt;/ref&gt; Although EAA is the primary tool for EIA in Northern Territory, there are further provisions for proposals in the Inquiries Act 1985 (NT).&lt;ref name="Elliott" /&gt;

=====Queensland (QLD)=====
There are four main EIA processes in Queensland.&lt;ref name=Defenders&gt;The Environment Defenders, viewed 10 September 2010, [http://www.edo.org.au/edoqld/edoqld/factsheets/factsheet11%2009.07.pdf EDO factsheet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716023121/http://www.edo.org.au/edoqld/edoqld/factsheets/factsheet11%2009.07.pdf |date=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, under the Integrated Planning Act 1997 (IPA) for development projects other than mining. Secondly, under the Chapter 3 of the ''Environmental Protection Act 1994'' (Qld) (EP Act) for some mining and petroleum activities. Thirdly, under the ''State Development and Public Works Organisation Act 1971'' (Qld) (State Development Act) for ‘significant projects’. Finally, under the ''Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999'' (Cth) for ‘controlled actions’.&lt;ref name="Defenders" /&gt;

'''South Australia (SA)'''

The local governing tool for EIA in South Australia is the ''Development Act 1993'' (SA). There are three levels of assessment possible under the Act in the form of an environment impact statement (EIS), a public environmental report (PER) or a Development Report (DR).&lt;ref name="Elliott" /&gt;

=====Tasmania (TAS)=====
In Tasmania, an integrated system of legislation is used to govern development and approval process, this system is a mixture of the E''nvironmental Management and Pollution Control Act 1994'' (Tas) (EMPC Act), ''Land Use Planning and Approvals Act 1993'' (Tas) (LUPA Act), ''State Policies and Projects Act 1993'' (Tas) (SPPA), and ''Resource Management and Planning Appeals Tribunal Act 1993'' (Tas).&lt;ref name="Elliott" /&gt;

=====Victoria (VIC)=====
The EIA process in Victoria is intertwined with the ''[[Environment Effects Act 1978]]'' (Vic) and the Ministerial Guidelines for Assessment of Environmental Effects (made under the s 10 of the EE Act).&lt;ref&gt;The Law Handbook, viewed 9 September 2010,&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Western Australia (WA)=====
Part 4 of the ''Environmental Protection Act 1986'' (WA) provides the legislative framework for the EIA process in Western Australia.&lt;ref&gt;The Government of Western Australia, viewed 9 September 2010,&lt;/ref&gt; The EPA Act oversees the planning and development proposals and assesses their likely impacts on the environment.

===Canada===
In ''Friends of the Oldman River Society v. Canada (Minister of Transportation)'',{{harv|SCC|1992}} [[Gérard La Forest|La Forest J]] of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] described environmental impact assessment in terms of the proper scope of federal jurisdiction with respect to environments matters,{{quotation|"Environmental impact assessment is, in its simplest form, a planning tool that is now generally regarded as an integral component of sound decision-making."{{sfn|SCC|1992}}}}
[[Gérard La Forest|Supreme Court Justice La Forest]] cited {{harv|Cotton|Emond|1981|245}}, "The basic concepts behind environmental assessment are simply stated: (1) early identification and evaluation of all potential environmental consequences of a proposed undertaking; (2) decision making that both guarantees the adequacy of this process and reconciles, to the greatest extent possible, the proponent’s development desires with environmental protection and preservation."&lt;ref name="Cotton1981"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Cotton |last1=Roger|first2=D. Paul |last2=Emond|title=Environmental Impact Assessment|editor=John Swaigen|series=Environmental Rights in Canada|location=Toronto, Ontario|publisher=Butterworths|year=1981 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

La Forest referred to {{harv|Jeffrey|1989||loc= 1.2,1.4}} and {{harv|Emond|1978|p=5}} who described "...environmental assessments as a planning tool with both an information-gathering and a decision-making component" that provide "...an objective basis for granting or denying approval for a proposed development."&lt;ref name="Jeffrey1989"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jeffery |first=Michael I.|title=Environmental Approvals in Canada|location=Toronto, Ontario|publisher=Butterworths|year=1989 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Emond1978"&gt;{{cite book|last=Emond |first=D. P.|title=Environmental Assessment Law in Canada|location=Toronto, Ontario|publisher=Emond‑Montgomery Ltd.|year=1978 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice La Forest addressed his concerns about the implications of Bill C-45 regarding public navigation rights on lakes and rivers that would contradict previous cases.{{harv|La Forest|1973|178-80}}&lt;ref name="LaForest1973"&gt;{{cite book|last=La Forest, |first=Gérard V.|title=Water Law in Canada|location=Ottawa|publisher=Information Canada|year=1973 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
The Environmental Impact Assessment Law (EIA Law) requires that an environmental impact assessment be completed prior to project construction. However, if a developer completely ignores this requirement and builds a project without submitting an environmental impact statement, the only penalty is that the environmental protection bureau (EPB) may require the developer to do a make-up environmental assessment. If the developer does not complete this make-up assessment within the designated time, only then is the EPB authorized to fine the developer. Even so, the possible fine is capped at a maximum of about US$25,000, a fraction of the overall cost of most major projects. The lack of more stringent enforcement mechanisms has resulted in a significant percentage of projects not completing legally required environmental impact assessments prior to construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Wang| first=Alex| authorlink=| coauthors=| title=Environmental protection in China: the role of law| work=| publisher=| date=2007-02-05| url=http://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/745-Environmental-protection-in-China-the-role-of-law| format=| doi=| accessdate=| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516123917/http://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/745-Environmental-protection-in-China-the-role-of-law| archivedate=2012-05-16| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

China's [[State Environmental Protection Administration]] (SEPA) used the legislation to halt 30 projects in 2004, including three hydro-power plants under the [[Three Gorges]] Project Company. Although one month later (Note as a point of reference, that the typical EIA for a major project in the USA takes one to two years.), most of the 30 halted projects resumed their construction, reportedly having passed the environmental assessment, the fact that these key projects' construction was ever suspended was notable.

A joint investigation by SEPA and the Ministry of Land and Resources in 2004 showed that 30–40% of the mining construction projects went through the procedure of environment impact assessment as required, while in some areas only 6–7% did so. This partly explains why China has witnessed so many mining accidents in recent years.

SEPA alone cannot guarantee the full enforcement of environmental laws and regulations, observed Professor [[Wang Canfa]], director of the centre to help environmental victims at [[China University of Political Science and Law]]. In fact, according to Wang, the rate of China's environmental laws and regulations that are actually enforced is estimated at barely 10%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Egypt ===
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)
EIA is implemented in Egypt under the umbrella of the Ministry of state for environmental affairs. The Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA) is responsible for the EIA services.

In June 1997, the responsibility of Egypt's first full-time Minister of State for Environmental Affairs was assigned as stated in the Presidential Decree no.275/1997. From thereon, the new ministry has focused, in close collaboration with the national and international development partners, on defining environmental policies, setting priorities and implementing initiatives within a context of sustainable development.

According to the Law 4/1994 for the Protection of the Environment, the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA) was restructured with the new mandate to substitute the institution initially established in 1982. At the central level, EEAA represents the executive arm of the Ministry.

The purpose of EIA is to ensure the protection and conservation of the environment and natural resources including human health aspects against uncontrolled development. The long-term objective is to ensure a sustainable economic development that meets present needs without compromising future generations ability to meet their own needs. EIA is an important tool in the integrated environmental management approach.

EIA must be performed for new establishments or projects and for expansions or renovations of existing establishments according to the Law for the Environment.

The directive was amended again in 2003, following EU signature of the 1998 [[Aarhus Convention]], and once more in 2009. The initial Directive of 1985 and its three amendments have been codified in Directive 2011/92/EU of 13 December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2012:026:0001:0021:EN:PDF DIRECTIVE 2011/92/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 13 December 2011 on the assessment of the effects of some public and private projects on the environment] from [http://eur-lex.europa.eu Eur-Lex] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170907140138/http://eur-lex.europa.eu/ |date=2017-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2001, the issue was enlarged to the assessment of plans and programmes by the so-called ''[[Strategic Environmental Assessment|Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA)]] Directive'' (2001/42/EC), which is now in force.&lt;ref name="watson" /&gt;
Under the EU directive, an EIA must provide certain information to comply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001L0042:EN:HTML|title=EUR-Lex – 32001L0042 – EN|author=|date=|website=eur-lex.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are seven key areas that are required:
# Description of the project
#* Description of actual project and site description
#* Break the project down into its key components, i.e. construction, operations, decommissioning
#* For each component list all of the sources of environmental disturbance
#* For each component all the inputs and outputs must be listed, e.g., [[air pollution]], noise, [[hydrology]]
# Alternatives that have been considered
#* Examine alternatives that have been considered
#* Example: in a [[biomass]] power station, will the fuel be sourced locally or nationally?
# Description of the environment
#* List of all aspects of the environment that may be affected by the development
#* Example: populations, [[fauna]], flora, air, soil, water, humans, landscape, cultural heritage
#* This section is best carried out with the help of local experts, e.g. the [[RSPB]] in the UK
# Description of the significant effects on the environment
#* The word significant is crucial here as the definition can vary
#* 'Significant' must be defined
#* The most frequent method used here is use of the [[Leopold matrix]]
#* The matrix is a tool used in the systematic examination of potential interactions
#* Example: in a windfarm development a significant impact may be collisions with birds
# Mitigation
#* This is where EIA is most useful
#* Once section 4 is complete, it is obvious where impacts are greatest
#* Using this information ways to avoid negative impacts should be developed
#* Best working with the developer with this section as they know the project best
#* Using the windfarm example again, construction could be out of bird nesting seasons.  Or removal of hardstanding on a potentially contaminated land site, out of the rainy season.
# Non-technical summary (EIS)
#* The EIA is in the public domain and be used in the decision making process
#* It is important that the information is available to the public
#* This section is a summary that does not include jargon or complicated diagrams
#* It should be understood by the informed lay-person
# Lack of know-how/technical difficulties
#* This section is to advise any areas of weakness in knowledge
#* It can be used to focus areas of future research
#* Some developers see the EIA as a starting block for poor environmental management

====Annexed projects====
All projects are either classified as Annex 1 or Annex 2 projects. Those lying in Annex 1 are large scale developments such as motorways, chemical works, bridges, powerstations etc. These always require an EIA under the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive (85,337,EEC as amended). Annex 2 projects are smaller in scale than those referred to in Annex 1. Member States must determine whether these project shall be made subject to an assessment subject to a set of criteria set out in Annex 3 of codified Directive 2011/92/EU.

====The Netherlands====
EIA was implemented in Dutch legislation on September 1, 1987. The categories of projects that require an EIA are summarised in Dutch legislation, the Wet milieubeheer. The use of thresholds for activities makes sure that EIA is obligatory for those activities that may have considerable impacts on the environment.

For projects and plans that fit these criteria, an EIA report is required. The EIA report defines a.o. the proposed initiative, it makes clear the impact of that initiative on the environment and compares this with the impact of possible alternatives with less a negative impact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs1.eia.nl/cms/engelse_c-d-lijsten.pdf List of criteria for EIA/SEA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724151830/http://docs1.eia.nl/cms/engelse_c-d-lijsten.pdf |date=2011-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===
EIA in Hong Kong, since 1998, is regulated by the ''Environmental Impact Assessment Ordinance 1997''.

The original proposal to construct the [[Lok Ma Chau Spur Line]] overground across the [[Long Valley, Hong Kong|Long Valley]] failed to get through EIA, and the [[Kowloon–Canton Railway Corporation]] had to change its plan and build the railway underground. In April 2011, the EIA of the Hong Kong section of the [[Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge]] was found to have breached the ordinance, and was declared unlawful. The appeal by the government was allowed in September 2011. However, it was estimated that this EIA court case had increased the construction cost of the Hong Kong section of the bridge by HK$6.5 billion in money-of-the-day prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201110/26/P201110260238.htm |title=LCQ1: Judicial review case regarding the Environmental Impact Assessment reports of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge |author= |date=October 26, 2011 |work=Press Releases |publisher=www.info.gov.hk |accessdate=October 27, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119072107/http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201110/26/P201110260238.htm |archivedate=January 19, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Iraq ===
Ministry of Environment of the federal government of Iraq is in charge of issuing Environmental compliance certificate based on an EIA report prepared by professional consultant and thoroughly reviewed by MOE. Any project or activity prior to its establishment or even already existing project has to be approved and obtain such certificate from the MOE. Projects are classified into 3 categories; “A”, “B” and “C”. EIA report is usually obligatory for those projects and activities falling under categories “A” (large-scale) and “B” (small-scale) that may have considerable impacts on environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/env/eia/documents/WG14_MOS3_nov2010/Diagram_EIA_process_in_Iraq.pdf|title=EIA process in Iraq|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831221814/https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/env/eia/documents/WG14_MOS3_nov2010/Diagram_EIA_process_in_Iraq.pdf|archivedate=2017-08-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of “A” category activities such as: dams and reservoirs, forestry production projects, industrial plants, irrigation, drainage and flood control, land clearance and leveling, port and harbor development, river basin development, thermal power and hydro-power development, manufacture, transportation and use of pesticides or other hazardous materials, hazardous waste management and disposal....etc. An example of “B” category activities such as: agro-industries, electrical transmission, renewable energy, rural electrification, tourism, rehabilitation or maintenance of highway or rural roads, rehabilitation or modification of existing industrial facilities...etc. preparation of EIA report is usually exempt for projects falling under category “C” that may have low to no impact on environment, and example of “C” category activities: small fish breeding pond, institutional development, most human resources projects...etc.

The main environmental legislations in Iraq are: Law No.64 for cities and land use (1965), Law No.21 for noise prevention (1966), Law No.25 for system of rivers and other water resources protection (1967), Law No.99 for ionized radiation (1980), Law No.89 for public health (drinking water provision, sanitation and environmental monitoring (1981), Law No.79 for protection and improvement of environment (1986), Environmental criteria for agricultural, industrial and public service projects (1990), Law No.3 for protection and improvement of environment (1997), Law No.2 for water systems protection (2001), Law No.44 for creation of Ministry of Environment instead of the council of protection and improvement of environment (2003), Law No.27 for environmental protection and improvement (2009),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://extwprlegs1.fao.org/docs/pdf/irq100188E.pdf|title=Law No.27 of 2009 for protection and improvement of environment|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901160232/http://extwprlegs1.fao.org/docs/pdf/irq100188E.pdf|archivedate=2017-09-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Law No.4 for protection of ambient air system (2012).

=== India ===
The [[Ministry of Environment and Forests (India)|Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change]] (MoEFCC) of India has been in a great effort in Environmental Impact Assessment in India. The main laws in action are the Water Act(1974), the Indian [[Wildlife Protection Act of 1972|Wildlife (Protection) Act (1972)]], the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act (1981) and the Environment (Protection) Act (1986),Biological Diversity Act(2002).&lt;ref&gt;Shibani Ghosh, [http://www.nujslawreview.org/pdf/articles/2013_3/03shibanighosh.pdf "Demystifying the Environmental Clearance Process in India"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221023322/http://nujslawreview.org/pdf/articles/2013_3/03shibanighosh.pdf |date=2015-02-21 }}, ''NUJS LAW REVIEW'', January 2, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The responsible body for this is the Central Pollution Control Board.
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) studies need a significant amount of primary and secondary environmental data. Primary data are those collected in the field to define the status of the environment (like air quality data, water quality data etc.). Secondary data are those collected over the years that can be used to understand the existing environmental scenario of the study area. The environmental impact assessment (EIA) studies are conducted over a short period of time and therefore the understanding of the environmental trends, based on a few months of primary data, has limitations. Ideally, the primary data must be considered along with the secondary data for complete understanding of the existing environmental status of the area. In many EIA studies, the secondary data needs could be as high as 80% of the total data requirement. EIC is the repository of one stop secondary data source for environmental impact assessment in India.

The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) experience in India indicates that the lack of timely availability of reliable and authentic environmental data has been a major bottle neck in achieving the full benefits of EIA. The environment being a multi-disciplinary subject, a multitude of agencies are involved in collection of environmental data. However, no single organization in India tracks available data from these agencies and makes it available in one place in a form required by environmental impact assessment practitioners. Further, environmental data is not available in enhanced forms that improve the quality of the EIA. This makes it harder and more time-consuming to generate environmental impact assessments and receive timely environmental clearances from regulators. With this background, the Environmental Information Centre (EIC) has been set up to serve as a professionally managed clearing house of environmental information that can be used by MoEF, project proponents, consultants, NGOs and other stakeholders involved in the process of environmental impact assessment in India. EIC caters to the need of creating and disseminating of organized environmental data for various developmental initiatives all over the country.

EIC stores data in GIS format and makes it available to all environmental impact assessment studies and to EIA stakeholders in a cost effective and timely manner. So that we can manage that in different proportions such as remedy measures etc.,

=== Nepal ===
In Nepal, EIA has been integrated in major development projects since the early 1980s. In the planning history of Nepal, the sixth plan (1980–85), for the first time, recognized the need for EIA with the establishment of Environmental Impact Study Project (EISP) under the Department of Soil Conservation in 1982 to develop necessary instruments for integration of EIA in infrastructure
development projects. However, the government of Nepal enunciated environment conservation related
policies in the seventh plan (NPC, 1985–1990). To enforce this policy and make necessary arrangements, a series of guidelines were developed, thereby incorporating the elements of environmental factors right from the project formulation stage of the development plans
and projects and to avoid or minimize adverse effects on the ecological system. In addition, it has also emphasized that EIAs of industry, tourism, water resources, transportation, urbanization, agriculture, forest and other developmental projects be conducted.

In Nepal, the government's Environmental Impact Assessment Guideline of 1993 inspired the enactment of the Environment Protection Act (EPA) of 1997 and the Environment Protection Rules (EPR) of 1997 (EPA and EPR have been enforced since 24 and 26 June 1997 respectively in Nepal) to internalizing the environmental assessment system. The process institutionalized the EIA process in development proposals and enactment, which makes the integration of IEE and EIA legally binding to the prescribed projects. The projects, requiring EIA or IEE, are included in Schedules 1 and 2 of the EPR, 1997
(GoN/MoLJPA 1997).

=== New Zealand ===
In New Zealand, EIA is usually referred to as ''Assessment of Environmental Effects'' (AEE).  The first use of EIA's dates back to a Cabinet minute passed in 1974 called Environmental Protection and Enhancement Procedures. This had no legal force and only related to the activities of government departments. When the [[Resource Management Act 1991|Resource Management Act]] was passed in 1991, an EIA was required as part of a resource consent application. Section 88 of the Act specifies that the AEE must include "such detail as corresponds with the scale and significance of the effects that the activity may have on the environment".  While there is no duty to consult any person when making a resource consent application (Sections 36A and Schedule 4), proof of consultation is almost certain required by local councils when they decide whether or not to publicly notify the consent application under Section 93.

=== Russian Federation ===
As of 2004, the state authority responsible for conducting the State EIA in Russia has been split between two Federal bodies: 1) Federal service for monitoring the use of natural resources – a part of the Russian Ministry for Natural Resources and Environment and 2) Federal Service for Ecological, Technological and Nuclear Control. The two main pieces of environmental legislation in Russia are: The Federal Law ‘On Ecological Expertise, 1995 and the ‘Regulations on Assessment of Impact from Intended Business and Other Activity on Environment in the Russian Federation, 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Environmental Protection, Russia&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Federal Service for monitoring the use of natural resources ====
In 2006, the parliament committee on ecology in conjunction with the Ministry for Natural Resources and Environment, created a working group to prepare a number of amendments to existing legislation to cover such topics as stringent project documentation for building of potentially environmentally damaging objects as well as building of projects on the territory of protected areas.
There has been some success in this area, as evidenced from abandonment of plans to construct a gas pipe-line through the only remaining habitat of the critically endangered Amur leopard in the Russian Far East.

==== Federal Service for Ecological, Technological and Nuclear Control ====
The government's decision to hand over control over several important procedures, including state EIA in the field of all types of energy projects, to the Federal Service for Ecological, Technological and Nuclear Control had caused a major controversy and criticism from environmental groups that blamed the government for giving nuclear power industry control over the state EIA.

Not surprisingly the main problem concerning State EIA in Russia is the clear differentiation of jurisdiction between the two above-mentioned Federal bodies.

=== Sri Lanka ===

The National Environmental Act, 1998 requires environmental impact assessment for large scale projects in sensitive areas. It is enforced by the Central Environmental Authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Central Environmental Authority|title=Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Procedure in Sri Lanka|url=http://www.cea.lk/web/index.php/en/environmental-impact-assessment-eia-procedure-in-sri-lanka|website=Central Environmental Authority|publisher=Central Environmental Authority|accessdate=1 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161103215340/http://www.cea.lk/web/index.php/en/environmental-impact-assessment-eia-procedure-in-sri-lanka|archivedate=3 November 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new law of Ukraine on evaluation of impact on surroundings prescribes the requirements of environmental safety, rational use of national resources, minimizing of harmful impact on surroundings in the process of making managerial decisions about planned activity. The designing of the conclusion of evaluation of impact is a result of its conducting. The key moment of the law on evaluation of impact on surroundings is a substitution of conclusion of state environmental experise on the conclusion of evaluation of impact on surroundings.

=== United States ===
{{Main|National Environmental Policy Act}}
The [[National Environmental Policy Act]] of 1969 (NEPA), enacted in 1970, established a policy of environmental impact assessment for federal agency actions, federally funded activities or federally permitted/licensed activities that in the U. S. is termed "environmental review" or simply "the NEPA process."&lt;ref&gt;United States. National Environmental Policy Act, [http://www.usinfo.org/enus/government/branches/nepaeqia.htm P.L. 91-190] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516090600/http://www.usinfo.org/enus/government/branches/nepaeqia.htm |date=2013-05-16 }}, {{USStat|83|852|1969}}, {{USC|42|4321}} ''et seq.'' Approved January 1, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; The law also created the [[Council on Environmental Quality]], which promulgated regulations to codify the law's requirements.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Council on Environmental Quality. "NEPA and Agency Planning." ''Code of Federal Regulations,'' {{USCFR|40|1501}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[United States environmental law]] an Environmental Assessment (EA) is compiled to determine the need for an ''[[Environmental Impact Statement]]'' (EIS).  Federal or federalized actions expected to subject or be subject to significant environmental impacts will publish a Notice of Intent to Prepare an EIS as soon as significance is known.  Certain actions of [[federal government of the United States|federal]] [[government agency|agencies]] must be preceded by the NEPA process.  Contrary to a widespread misconception, NEPA does not prohibit the federal government or its licensees/permittees from harming the environment, nor does it specify any penalty if an environmental impact assessment turns out to be inaccurate, intentionally or otherwise.  NEPA requires that plausible statements as to the prospective impacts be disclosed in advance. The purpose of NEPA process is to ensure that the decision maker is fully informed of the environmental aspects and consequences prior to making the final decision.

==== Environmental assessment ====
An '''environmental assessment''' (EA) is an environmental analysis prepared pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act to determine whether a federal action would significantly affect the environment and thus require a more detailed ''Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)''. The certified release of an Environmental Assessment results in either a ''Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI)'' or an [[Environmental Impact Statement|EIS]].&lt;ref&gt;Eccleston, Charles H. and J. Peyton Doub (2010). [https://www.amazon.com/Preparing-NEPA-Environmental-Assessments-Professional/dp/1439808821/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1486949351&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=charles+eccleston Preparing NEPA Environmental Assessments: A User’s Guide to Best Professional Practices]. {{ISBN|978-1439808825}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Council on Environmental Quality]] (CEQ), which oversees the administration of NEPA, issued regulations for implementing the NEPA in 1979. Eccleston reports that the NEPA regulations barely mention preparation of EAs. This is because the EA was originally intended to be a simple document used in relatively rare instances where an agency was not sure if the potential significance of an action would be sufficient to trigger preparation of an EIS. But today, because EISs are so much longer and complicated to prepare, federal agencies are going to great effort to avoid preparing EISs by using EAs, even in cases where the use of EAs may be inappropriate. The ratio of EAs that are being issued compared to EISs is about 100 to 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Eccleston |first1=Charles |last2=Doub |first2=J.

Likewise, even the preparation of an accurate EA is viewed today as an onerous burden by many entities responsible for the environmental review of a proposal. Federal agencies have responded by streamlining their regulations that implement NEPA environmental review, by defining categories of projects that by their well understood nature may be safely excluded from review under NEPA, and by drawing up lists of project types that have negligible material impact upon the environment and can thus be exempted.

===== Content =====
The Environmental Assessment is a concise public document prepared by the federal action agency that serves to:
# briefly provide sufficient evidence and analysis for determining whether to prepare an EIS or a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI)
# Demonstrate compliance with the act when no EIS is required
# facilitate the preparation of an EIS when a FONSI cannot be demonstrated

The Environmental Assessment includes a brief discussion of the purpose and need of the proposal and of its alternatives as required by NEPA 102(2)(E), and of the human environmental impacts resulting from and occurring to the proposed actions and alternatives considered practicable, plus a listing of studies conducted and agencies and stakeholders consulted to reach these conclusions.  The action agency must approve an EA before it is made available to the public. The EA is made public through notices of availability by local, state, or regional clearing houses, often triggered by the purchase of a public notice advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation in the proposed activity area.

===== Structure =====
The structure of a generic Environmental Assessment is as follows:
# Summary
# Introduction
#* Background
#* Purpose and Need for Action
#* Proposed Action
#* Decision Framework
#* Public Involvement
#* Issues
# Alternatives, including the Proposed Action
#* Alternatives
#* Mitigation Common to All Alternatives
#* Comparison of Alternatives
# Environmental Consequences
# Consultation and Coordination

===== Procedure =====
The EA becomes a draft public document when notice of it is published, usually in a newspaper of general circulation in the area affected by the proposal. There is a 15-day review period required for an Environmental Assessment (30 days if exceptional circumstances) while the document is made available for public commentary, and a similar time for any objection to improper process. Commenting on the Draft EA is typically done in writing or email, submitted to the lead action agency as published in the notice of availability. An EA does not require a public hearing for verbal comments.  Following the mandated public comment period, the lead action agency responds to any comments, and certifies either a FONSI or a Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare an EIS in its public environmental review record.  The preparation of an EIS then generates a similar but more lengthy, involved and expensive process.

==== Environmental impact statement ====
{{main|Environmental impact statement}}
The adequacy of an environmental impact statement (EIS) can be challenged in [[United States federal courts|federal court]].  Major proposed projects have been blocked because of an agency's failure to prepare an acceptable EIS.  One prominent example was the [[Westway (New York)|Westway]] landfill and highway development in and along the [[Hudson River]] in [[New York, New York|New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elr.info/litigation/vol13/13.20326.htm ''Sierra Club v. United States Army Corps of Engineers,''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040328074514/http://www.elr.info/litigation/vol13/13.20326.htm |date=2004-03-28 }}
701 F.2d 1011, 18 ERC 1748. (2d Cir., 02/25/1983)&lt;/ref&gt; Another prominent case involved the [[Sierra Club]] suing the [[Nevada Department of Transportation]] over its denial of the club's request to issue a supplemental EIS addressing air emissions of [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]] and hazardous [[air pollutants]] in the case of widening [[U.S. Route 95 in Nevada|U.S. Route 95]] through [[Las Vegas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ritter |first=John |title=Lawsuit pits risks and roads |publisher=USA Today |date=2003-06-03 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-03-06-vegas-highway-usat_x.htm |accessdate= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629064153/http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-03-06-vegas-highway-usat_x.htm |archivedate=2011-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The case reached the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]], which led to construction on the highway being halted until the court's final decision. The case was settled prior to the court's final decision.

Several [[State governments of the United States|state governments]] that have adopted "little NEPAs," [[state law]]s imposing EIS requirements for particular state actions. Some of those state laws such as the [[California Environmental Quality Act]] refer to the required environmental impact study as an '''environmental impact report'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sprlaw.com/pdf/spr_little_nepa_ali_aba_0605.pdf |title=Sive,D. &amp; Chertok,M., "Little NEPAs" and Environmental Impact Assessment Procedures |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-01-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004091103/http://www.sprlaw.com/pdf/spr_little_nepa_ali_aba_0605.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This variety of state requirements produces voluminous data not just upon impacts of individual projects, but also in insufficiently researched scientific domains. For example, in a seemingly routine ''Environmental Impact Report'' for the city of [[Monterey, California]], information came to light that led to the official federal endangered species listing of [[Hickman's potentilla]], a rare coastal [[wildflower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rogers|first1=Mark|title=Endangered Flora of California|publisher=lulu.com|ISBN=978-1312862784|page=106|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O17xCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lpg=PA106&amp;dq=C.M.+Hogan,+G.+Deghi,+M.+Papineau+et+al.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZKZSMO9-Y6&amp;sig=gezVDrq4tzoDHNmrQfNjAXjcguw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi7-KmQsMTQAhXP0RoKHRzOBAUQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=C.M.%20Hogan%2C%20G.%20Deghi%2C%20M.%20Papineau%20et%20al.&amp;f=false|accessdate=November 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C.M. Hogan, G. Deghi, M. Papineau et al., ''Environmental Impact Report for the Pebble Beach Properties project by Del Monte Forest'', Earth Metrics Inc. Prepared for the city of Monterey and State of California Clearinghouse (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. [[Federal Register]]: August 2, 1995 (Volume 60, Number 148, Pages 39326-39337)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transboundary application ==
Environmental threats do not respect national borders. International pollution can have detrimental effects on the atmosphere, oceans, rivers, [[aquifer]]s, farmland, the weather and biodiversity. Global climate change is transnational. Specific pollution threats include [[acid rain]], [[radioactive contamination]], [[Space debris|debris in outer space]], [[Stratosphere|stratospheric]] [[ozone depletion]] and toxic [[oil spill]]s. The [[Chernobyl disaster]], precipitated by a [[Nuclear and radiation accidents|nuclear accident]] on April 26, 1986, is a stark reminder of the devastating effects of transboundary nuclear pollution.&lt;ref&gt;Sands, P., (1989), The Environment, Community and International Law, Harvard International Law Lournal, 393, p402&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental protection is inherently a cross-border issue and has led to the creation of transnational regulation via multilateral and bilateral treaties. The [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] (UNCHE or Stockholm Conference) held in [[Stockholm]] in 1972 and the [[Earth Summit|United Nations Conference on the Environment and Development]] (UNCED or Rio Summit, Rio Conference, or Earth Summit) held in [[Rio de Janeiro]] in 1992 were key in the creation of about 1,000 international instruments that include at least some provisions related to the environment and its protection.&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, E., (1999), Understanding Compliance with International Environmental Agreements: The Bakers Dozen Myths, Univ Richmond L.R. 32, 1555&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe|United Nations Economic Commission for Europe's]] [[Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context]] was negotiated to provide an international legal framework for transboundary EIA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unece.org/env/eia/welcome.html |title=Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context (Espoo, 1991) |publisher=Unece.org |date= |accessdate=2013-01-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126142541/http://www.unece.org/env/eia/welcome.html |archivedate=2013-01-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as there is no universal legislature or administration with a comprehensive mandate, most international treaties exist parallel to one another and are further developed without the benefit of consideration being given to potential conflicts with other agreements. There is also the issue of international enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfrum, R., &amp; Matz, N., (2003), Conflicts in International Environmental Law, Max-Planck-Institut für Ausländisches Öffentliches Recht und Völkerrech&lt;/ref&gt;
This has led to duplications and failures, in part due to an inability to enforce agreements. An example is the failure of many international 
fisheries regimes to restrict harvesting practises.&lt;ref&gt;Young, O., (1999), The Effectiveness of International Environmental Regimes, [[MIT Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;
Application shall be achieved by the willing of counties authorities. / Aphro10

== Criticism ==
As per Jay ''et al.'', EIA is used as a decision aiding tool rather than decision making tool. There is growing dissent about them as their influence on decisions is limited. Improved training for practitioners, guidance on bestpractice and continuing research have all been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jay |first1=S. |last2=Jones |first2=C. |last3=Slinn |first3=P. |last4=Wood |first4=C. |year=2007 |title=Environmental Impact Assessment: Retrospect and Prospect |url= |journal=Environmental Impact Assessment Review |publisher=Elsevier |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=289–300 |doi=10.1016/j.eiar.2006.12.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EIAs have been criticized for excessively limiting their scope in space and time. No accepted procedure exists for determining such boundaries. The boundary refers to ‘the spatial and temporal boundary of the proposal’s effects’. This boundary is determined by the applicant and the lead assessor, but in practice, almost all EIAs address only direct and immediate on-site effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lenzen |first1=M. |last2=Murray |first2=S. |last3=Korte |first3=B. |last4=Dey |first4=C. |year=2003 |title=Environmental impact assessment including indirect effects—a case study using input-output analysis |url= |journal=Environmental Impact Assessment Review |publisher=Elsevier |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=263–282 |doi=10.1016/S0195-9255(02)00104-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development causes both direct and indirect effects. Consumption of goods and services, production, use and disposal of building materials and machinery, additional land use for activities of manufacturing and services, mining and refining, etc., all have environmental impacts. The indirect effects of development can be much higher than the direct effects examined by an EIA. Proposals such as [[airports]] or [[shipyards]] cause wide-ranging national and international effects, which should be covered in EIAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shepherd |first1=A. |last2=Ortolano |first2=L. |year=1996 |title=Strategic environmental assessment for sustainable urban development |url= |journal=Environmental Impact Assessment Review |publisher=Elsevier |volume=16 |issue=4–6 |pages=321–335 |doi=10.1016/S0195-9255(96)00071-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadening the scope of EIA can benefit the conservation of threatened species. Instead of concentrating on the project site, some EIAs employed a [[habitat]]-based approach that focused on much broader relationships among humans and the environment. As a result, alternatives that reduce the negative effects to the population of whole species, rather than local subpopulations, can be assessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fernandes |first1=João P. |year=2000 |title=EIA procedure, Landscape ecology and conservation management—Evaluation of alternatives in a highway EIA process |url= |journal=Environmental Impact Assessment Review |publisher=Elsevier |volume=20 |issue=6 |pages=665–680 |doi=10.1016/S0195-9255(00)00060-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thissen and Agusdinata&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thissen |first1=WIH |last2=Agusdinata |first2=DB |year=2008 |title=Handling deep uncertainties in impact assessment|url= |journal=In proceedings of the 28th annual conference of the IAIA May 5–9, 2008, Perth, Australia. |publisher=IAIA |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that little attention is given to the systematic identification and assessment of uncertainties in environmental studies which is critical in situations where uncertainty cannot be easily reduced by doing more research. In line with this, Maier et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Maier  |first1=HR |last2=Ascough  |first2=JC |last3=Wattenbach  |first3=M |last4=Renschler  |first4=CS |last5=Labiosa   |first5=WB |year=2008 |title=Uncertainty in Environmental Decision Making: Issues, Challenges and Future Directions |url= |journal=Publications from USDA-ARS/UNL Faculty. Paper 399.|publisher=USDA-ARS/UNL Faculty |volume= |issue= |pages=|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have concluded on the need to consider uncertainty at all stages of the decision-making process. In such a way decisions can be made with confidence or known uncertainty. These proposals are justified on data that shows that environmental assessments fail to predict accurately the impacts observed. Tenney et al.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tenney   |first1=A |last2=Kværner   |first2=J |last3=Gjerstad   |first3=KI |year=2006 |title=Uncertainty in environmental impact assessment predictions: the need for better communication and more transparency|url= |journal=Impact Assessment and Project Appraisal| publisher=|volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=45–56|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Wood et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wood    |first1=C |last2=, Dipper |first2=B |last3= Jones    |first3=C |year=2000 |title=Auditing the assessments of the environmental impacts of planning projects|url= |journal=Journal of Environmental Planning and Management| publisher=|volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=23–47|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have reported evidence of the intrinsic uncertainty attached to EIAs predictions from a number of case studies worldwide. The gathered evidence consisted of comparisons between predictions in EIAs and the impacts measured during, or following project implementation. In explaining this trend, Tenney et al.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; have highlighted major causes such as project changes, modelling errors, errors in data and assumptions taken and bias introduced by people in the projects analyzed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14585">'''Environmental peacebuilding''' examines and advocates environmental protection and cooperation as a factor in peaceful relations. Peacebuilding is both the theory and practice of identifying the conditions that can lead to a sustainable peace between those who have previously been adversaries, and assisting adversaries to move towards a sustainable peace. In the Middle East, common environmental challenges have been identified as a basis for regional cooperation and peacebuilding.  A small Middle Eastern civil society network reaches across adversarial boundaries to promote and practice environmental cooperation.

==Peacebuilding==

The study of [[peacebuilding]] (a term coined by Galtung, 1975)&lt;ref&gt;Galtung, Johan. 1975.  "Three approaches to peace: peacekeeping, peacemaking and peacebuilding." In Peace, War and Defence - Essays in Peace Research Vol. 2, 282-304. Copenhagen:  Christian Ejlers.&lt;/ref&gt; develops from interest in identifying the conditions that lead beyond a temporary cessation of violence to sustainable processes of conflict management and mutual cooperation between those who have previously been adversaries.  Lederach&lt;ref&gt;Lederach, John Paul.  Building Peace: Sustainable Reconciliation in Divided Societies (Washington, DC: United States Institute of Peace Press) 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; is most commonly cited, and his work has influenced national aid and development agencies, international agencies, and the network of NGOs that have placed peacebuilding on their agendas.  

Beginning with Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali promoting An Agenda for Peace in 1992,&lt;ref&gt;UN Secretary-General. 1992. "An Agenda for peace: preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace-keeping." UN Doc. A/47/277. June 17.&lt;/ref&gt; the United Nations adopted the language of peacebuilding and developed programs based on it.  Initiatives promoting human security and human rights share a similar concern with developing an international system that promotes the underlying conditions for the movement towards a peaceful world.

==Environmental peacebuilding==

Within the field of peacebuilding studies and practice, there is a sub-literature on environmental peacebuilding that examines the role of environmental factors in moving towards a sustainable peace.  At the most basic level, warfare devastates ecosystems and the livelihoods of those who depend on natural resources, and the anarchy of conflict situations leads to the uncontrolled, destructive exploitation of natural resources.  Preventing these impacts allows for an easier movement to a sustainable peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pugh|first=Jeffrey|date=December 2008|title=Challenges and opportunities of human conflict and environmental transformation in Ecuadorian highlands|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/44201034_Challenges_and_opportunities_of_human_conflict_and_environmental_transformation_in_Ecuadorian_highlands|journal=Pirineos|volume=163|pages=63-75|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From a more positive perspective, environmental cooperation can be one of the places where hostile parties can sustain a dialogue, and sustainable development is a prerequisite for a sustainable peace.&lt;ref&gt;Carius, A.

Environment and Peacebuilding in War-torn Societies: Lessons from the UN Environment Programme's Experience with Postconflict Assessment. Global Governance, 15, 4, pp. 185-105.&lt;/ref&gt; note the relationship between environmental peacebuilding projects and studies of environment and conflict.  They observe that environmental challenges may be opportunities for peacebuilding, but they may also harden differences and reinforce conflict.  Environmental challenges are also usually complexly interconnected to economic and governance challenges.  Environmental issues are now routinely acknowledged as aspects of conflicts, and are necessarily part of the movement towards conflict management and the transformation of conflictual relations into peaceful ones.  

The United Nations Environment Programme has placed environmental conflict and cooperation on its agenda,&lt;ref&gt;UNEP. (2004). Understanding Environment, Conflict, and Cooperation.

==Environmental peacebuilding in the Middle East==

The 1991 Madrid Conference, co-sponsored by the United States and the USSR, brought together representatives of the governments of Israel, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan, and a Palestinian delegation within the Jordanian delegation.  The conference established working groups on refugees, regional security, economic development, water, and environment.  The working groups on water and environment, and to some extent the one on economic development as well, had the agenda of bringing environmental cooperation and sustainable development into the formulation of a path to a sustainable 
Middle East peace.    

The subsequent Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organization and the Peace treaty between Jordan and Israel each had sections that envisioned joint committees on water, environmental cooperation and economic development.  When negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority stalled and relations again became strongly adversarial, progress towards cooperation on water, the environment and sustainable development also stalled.  At the formal level there are contacts across adversarial lines between government officials and experts, water infrastructure was kept out of the violence of the Second Intifadah, and there is some degree of cooperation – not widely publicized - on urgent water and environmental concerns.  Cooperative relations between Jordan and Israel have been maintained but progress is limited by the effects of the unresolved Palestinian-Israeli conflict.  

Diplomatic work on environmental peacebuilding in the region has been supplemented by the development of a small network of civil society organizations that promote and practice regional environmental cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;Schoenfeld, Stuart.  2010.  "Environment and Human Security in the Eastern Mediterranean: Regional Environmentalism in the Reframing of Palestinian-Israeli-Jordanian Relations" in P. H. Liotta, David Mouat, Judith Lancaster, Bill Kepner and David Smith, eds. Achieving Environmental Security: Ecosystem Services and Human Welfare. Amsterdam: IOS Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, A. (2008). Regional Water Cooperation and Peacebuilding in the Middle East.  Adelphi Research, Initiative For Peace.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations involved in environmental peacebuilding in the Middle East==
===Israel-Palestine Center for Research and Information===
[[Israel/Palestine_Center_for_Research_and_Information|IPCRI]] opened in 1989 during the first Intifada under joint Israeli and Palestinian directors.  IPCRI established the Water and Environment division in 1992.  A 1993 edited book presented Palestinian and Israeli perspectives on water cooperation.  Three IPCRI workshops held between 1994-6 on "Our Shared Environment" were followed by three volumes of papers from the workshops.  The IPCRI Water and Environment division took the lead in organizing a 2004 Israeli-Palestinian International "Water for Life" Conference, co-chaired by Israeli and Palestinian professors, held in Turkey, where over five days about 130 participants from the region were joined by about 50 international water experts. 

Subsequently, working with Israeli and Palestinian experts, IPCRI undertook a study of the management of the [[trans-boundary river|trans-boundary]] Nahal Alexander / Wadi Zomer basin.  IPCRI is a partner in the "GLOWA Jordan River" study of the impact of climate change on the Jordan basin, and has undertaken, with the support of the Government of Japan, work designed to provide a model for low cost sanitation to a West Bank village.

===EcoPeace / Friends of the Earth Middle East===
[[Friends of the Earth Middle East|EcoPeace / FoEME]] was founded in 1994 as a meeting place for Palestinian, Egyptian, Jordanian and Israeli environmental NGOs and became an affiliate of Friends of the Earth in 1998.  FOEME has a wide range of projects – organized around particular geographic areas (the Jordan River valley, the Dead Sea, the Gulf of Aqaba / Eilat), water (Good Water Neighbors, the Red Sea-Dead Sea Conduit, the mountain aquifer, "water, peace and the environment," water privatization), and environmental policy (sustainable development, climate change, "violent conflicts and the environment," trade and environment, solar power and healthy food).  FoEME has promoted protection rather than development of the Dead Sea and its designation as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, advocated the establishment of a "peace park" along the Jordan River, and vigorously questioned the proposed mega-project to channel water from the Read Sea to the Dead Sea.  

Since 2001 the FoEME Good Water Neighbors project has been working with Israeli, Palestinian and Jordanian communities that are mutually dependent on shared water resources.  Each community is partnered with a neighboring community.  Good Water Neighbors works with local community members on water education, awareness and development.  GWN uses dependence on shared water sources as a basis for dialogue and cooperation between partnered communities.

FoEME has published its own study of environmental peacebuilding,&lt;ref&gt;Harari, N., &amp; Roseman, J. (2008).  Environmental Peacebuilding Theory and Practice: A Case Study of the Good Water Neighbours Project and In Depth Analysis of the Wadi Fukin / Tzur Hadassah Communities. EcoPeace / Friends of the Earth Middle East.&lt;/ref&gt; and circulates a monthly "environmental peacemaking" listserv.

===Arava Institute for Environmental Studies===
The [[Arava Institute for Environmental Studies|institute]] opened in the 1996-7 academic year.  For one or two semesters students from Israel, Jordan, Palestine, Egypt and overseas live and study together on Kibbutz Ketura (in a remote part of the Negev desert south of the West Bank and just across the valley from Jordan) and receive university credit.&lt;ref&gt;Alleson, Ilan and Stuart Schoenfeld.  2007. 	"Environmental Justice and Peacebuilding in the Middle East," Peace Review 19:371-379.&lt;/ref&gt;  Enrolment, which is capped at 45, has varied.  From 1996 to 2010, about 600 students have studied at the institute.  University credit is now received through Ben Gurion University, and the institute co-sponsors a Master's program with Ben Gurion, in which some of its alumni have studied.

The alumni division maintains active Yahoo and Facebook "groups."  Alumni involvement is supplemented by  the Arava Alumni Peace and Environment Network (AAPEN) which held its first meeting in Aqaba in 2005 and has held subsequent meetings and other activities.  The institute has also developed as a research center.  The institute participates in projects as partners with Palestinian and Jordanian researchers and research organizations.  These projects have included developing a center for sustainable agriculture, developing policy options for the Dead Sea, transboundary stream restoration, and a study of health effects from exposure to airborne particles.  These projects involve links to international networks of research funding, and have brought regional conferences to the institute on a regular basis.   The institute has co-sponsored a conference on alternative energy and the supported the development of the solar power oriented Arava Power Corporation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14083">The '''ethics of care''' (alternatively '''care ethics''' or '''EoC''') is a [[normative ethics|normative]] [[ethics|ethical theory]] that holds that moral action centers on interpersonal relationships and care or benevolence as a virtue. EoC is one of a cluster of normative ethical theories that were developed by [[feminists]] in the second half of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;“Care Ethics” Maureen Sander-Staudt,  The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ISSN 2161-0002, http://www.iep.utm.edu/, 22/3/2016.&lt;/ref&gt; While [[consequentialism|consequentialist]] and [[deontology|deontological]] ethical theories emphasize generalizable standards and impartiality, ethics of care emphasize the importance of response to the individual. The distinction between the general and the individual is reflected in their different moral questions: "what is just?" versus "how to respond?".&lt;ref&gt;Gilligan, Carol. "Moral Orientation and Moral Development." The Feminist Philosophy Reader. By Alison Bailey and Chris J. Cuomo. Boston: McGraw-Hill, 2008. N. pag. 469 Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Gilligan criticizes the application of generalized standards as "morally problematic, since it breeds [[moral blindness]] or indifference."&lt;ref&gt;Gilligan, Carol. "Moral Orientation and Moral Development." The Feminist Philosophy Reader. By
on Bailey and Chris J. Cuomo. Boston: McGraw-Hill, 2008. N. pag. 471 Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some beliefs of the theory are basic:
# Persons are understood to have varying degrees of dependence and interdependence on one another. 
# Individuals impacted by the consequences of one's choices deserve consideration in proportion to their vulnerability.
# Details determine how to safeguard and promote the interests of those involved.

==Historical background==
===Carol Gilligan and ''In a Different Voice''===
The founder of Ethics of Care (EoC) was [[Carol Gilligan]], an American ethicist and psychologist. Gilligan was a student of developmental psychologist [[Lawrence Kohlberg]]. Gilligan developed EoC in contrast to her mentor's theory of [[Kohlberg's stages of moral development|stages of moral development]]. She held that measuring progress by Kohlberg's model resulted in boys being found to be more morally mature than girls, and this held for adult men and women as well (although when education is controlled for there are no gender differences).&lt;ref&gt;Walker, L.J. (1991). "Sex differences in moral reasoning.” In W.M. Kurtines and J. L. Gewirtz (eds.) ''Handbook of moral behavior and development'': Vol, 2. Research. Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; Gilligan further argued that Kohlberg's model was not an objective scale of moral development. Gilligan consider it as a masculine perspective on morality, founded on [[justice]] and abstract [[Duty|duties]] or obligations. Dana Ward has stated, in a paper that appears never to have been formally published for critical peer review, that the scale is [[psychometrics|psychometrically]] sound.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Dana (2000). "Still Hearing Voice: The Persistent Myth of Gendered Judgment," Keynote address presented at the VIIIth Biennial conference of the International Society for Justice Research, Rishon LeZion, Israel.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilligan's ''[[In a Different Voice]]'' offered the perspective that men and women have tendencies to view morality in different terms. Her theory claimed women tended to emphasize empathy and compassion over the notions of morality that are privileged in Kohlberg's scale.&lt;ref&gt;Gilligan, Carol. ''In A Different Voice'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press (1982)&lt;/ref&gt; 
Subsequent research suggests that the discrepancy in being oriented towards care-based or justice-based ethical approaches may be based on gender differences, or on differences in actual current life situations of the genders.&lt;ref&gt;Ford and Lowery (1986). "Gender Differences in Moral Reasoning: A Comparison of the Use of Justice and Care Orientations". ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology''. 50(4), 777-783; Rothbart, Hanley and Albert (1986). "Gender Differences in Moral Reasoning." ''Sex Roles''. 15 (11&amp;12), 645-653; and Krebs, D.L., Vermeulen, S.C., Denton, K., and Carpendale, J. I. (1994). "Gender and perspective differences in moral judgment and moral orientation". ''Journal of Moral Education''. 23, 17-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to traditional ethical positions==
Care ethics contrasts with more well-known ethical models, such as [[consequentialism|consequentialist]] theories (e.g. [[utilitarianism]]) and deontological theories (e.g. [[Kantian ethics]]) in that it seeks to incorporate traditionally feminized virtues and values which, proponents of care ethics contend, are absent in such traditional models of ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-ethics/#CarEthTheDifVoi|title=Feminist Ethics|last=Tong|first=Rosemarie|last2=Williams|first2=Nancy|date=May 4, 2009|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=The Metaphysics Research Lab|access-date=January 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Care ethics as feminist ethics==
While some feminists have criticized care-based ethics for reinforcing traditional stereotypes of a "good woman"&lt;ref name=Bartky&gt;{{cite book | last = Bartky | first = Sandra Lee | author-link = Sandra Bartky | title = Femininity and domination: studies in the phenomenology of oppression | pages = 104–105 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 1990 | isbn = 9780415901864 }}&lt;/ref&gt; others have embraced parts of this paradigm under the theoretical concept of care-focused feminism.&lt;ref name="Tong, Rosmarie page 162-165"&gt;Tong, Rosmarie: Feminist Thought: A More Comprehensive Introduction, page 162-165. Westview Press, Charlotte, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Care-focused feminism is a branch of feminist thought, informed primarily by ethics of care as developed by [[Carol Gilligan]] and [[Nel Noddings]].&lt;ref name="Tong, Rosmarie page 162-165"/&gt; This body of theory is critical of how caring is socially engendered, being assigned to women and consequently devalued.  “Care-focused feminists regard women’s capacity for care as a human strength”&lt;ref name="Tong, Rosmarie page 162-165"/&gt; which can and should be taught to and expected of men as well as women.  Noddings proposes that ethical caring has the potential to be a more concrete evaluative model of moral dilemma, than an ethic of justice.&lt;ref&gt;Noddings, Nel: Caring: A Feminine Approach to Ethics and Moral Education, page 3-4. University of California Press, Berkeley, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;  Noddings’ care-focused feminism requires practical application of [[Nel Noddings#Nel Noddings' relational ethics|relational ethics]], predicated on an ethic of care.&lt;ref&gt;Noddings, Nel: Women and Evil, page 222. University of California Press, Berkeley, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethics of care is also a basis for care-focused feminist theorizing on maternal ethics. These theories recognize caring as an ethically relevant issue.&lt;ref&gt;Held, Virginia.  Ethics of Care, page 64. Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Critical of how society engenders caring labor, theorists [[Sara Ruddick]], [[Virginia Held]], and [[Eva Feder Kittay]] suggest caring should be performed and care givers valued in both public and private spheres.&lt;ref&gt;Kittay, Eva Feder:  Love’s Labor: Essays on Women, Equality and Dependency, page 20. Routledge, New York, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;   This proposed paradigm shift in ethics encourages the view that an ethic of caring be the social responsibility of both men and women.

[[Joan Tronto]] argues that the definition of the term "ethic of care" is ambiguous due in part to the lack of a central role it plays in moral theory.&lt;ref name="Tronto"&gt;{{citation | last = Tronto | first = Joan C. | author-link = Joan Tronto | contribution = An ethic of care | editor-last1 = Cudd | editor-first1 = Ann E. | editor-last2 = Andreasen | editor-first2 = Robin O. | editor-link1 = Ann Cudd | title = Feminist theory: a philosophical anthology | pages = 251–263 | publisher = Blackwell Publishing | location = Oxford, UK Malden, Massachusetts | year = 2005 | isbn = 9781405116619 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; She argues that considering moral philosophy is engaged with human goodness, then care would appear to assume a significant role in this type of philosophy.&lt;ref name="Tronto"/&gt; However, this is not the case and Tronto further stresses the association between care and "naturalness". The latter term refers to the socially and culturally constructed gender roles where care is mainly assumed to be the role of the woman.&lt;ref name="Tronto"/&gt; As such, care loses the power to take a central role in moral theory.

Tronto states there are four ethical elements of care:

#'''Attentiveness''' &lt;br/&gt;Attentiveness is crucial to the ethics of care because care requires a recognition of others' needs in order to respond to them.&lt;ref name="Tronto"/&gt; The question which arises is the distinction between ignorance and inattentiveness.&lt;ref name="Tronto"/&gt; Tronto poses this question as such, "But when is ignorance simply ignorance, and when is it inattentiveness"?&lt;ref name="Tronto"/&gt;
#'''Responsibility''' &lt;br/&gt;In order to care, we must take it upon ourselves, thus responsibility.  The problem associated with this second ethical element of responsibility is the question of obligation.  Obligation is often, if not already, tied to pre-established societal and cultural norms and roles.  Tronto makes the effort to differentiate the terms "responsibility" and "obligation" with regards to the ethic of care.  Responsibility is ambiguous, whereas obligation refers to situations where action or reaction is due, such as the case of a legal contract.&lt;ref name="Tronto"/&gt; This ambiguity allows for ebb and flow in and between class structures and gender roles, and to other socially constructed roles that would bind responsibility to those only befitting of those roles.
#'''Competence''' &lt;br/&gt;To provide care also means competency.  One cannot simply acknowledge the need to care, accept the responsibility, but not follow through with enough adequacy - as such action would result in the need of care not being met.&lt;ref name="Tronto"/&gt;
#'''Responsiveness''' &lt;br/&gt;This refers to the "responsiveness of the care receiver to the care".&lt;ref name="Tronto"/&gt; Tronto states, "Responsiveness signals an important moral problem within care: by its nature, care is concerned with conditions of vulnerability and inequality".&lt;ref name="Tronto"/&gt; She further argues responsiveness does not equal reciprocity.&lt;ref name="Tronto"/&gt; Rather, it is another method to understand vulnerability and inequality by understanding what has been expressed by those in the vulnerable position, as opposed to re-imagining oneself in a similar situation.&lt;ref name="Tronto"/&gt;

'''''Evacuate Earth''''' is a [[National Geographic Channel]] documentary that portrays the hypothetical scenario of  humans evacuating the planet Earth before it is destroyed by a rogue [[neutron star]]. The documentary details the technical and social complications of building a [[generation ship]] to save humanity and other Earth organisms by relocating to a planet in another solar system. 

== Premise ==
The documentary proposes a [[thought experiment]] in which a neutron star approaches Earth.  Constant [[meteor storm]]s are the first warning sign, and dramatic sequences depict widespread destruction and the deaths of thousands of people.  Given seventy-five years to prepare, human society radically shifts toward the evacuation of Earth.  The propulsion system for the spacecraft is the first problem to be addressed.  In a dramatic sequence, the world's leading experts debate the benefits and drawbacks of various methods. Conventional rockets are too slow, and antimatter engines are too unstable; they eventually settle on [[nuclear pulse propulsion]], as originally suggested by [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Orion]].  The world's engineers, scientists, and manufacturing workers begun work at a new site dubbed Starship City.  Interviewed experts propose that fatalism may drive some people either to suicide or radicalism and attempts to sabotage the project.  In one dramatic sequence, terrorists strike the facility, though they are destroyed by a hidden minefield.  Brush fire conflicts also escalate, as security forces are focused on either maintaining order or protecting the interstellar project's facilities and personnel.

Who is to be evacuated is another major issue.  Although diversity is respected, any selected individual would have to be genetically hardy and not predisposed toward disease (such as [[schizophrenia]] and [[diabetes]]).  In dramatic sequences, a second ark ship is announced amid controversy, as it is reserved for the world's wealthiest and most powerful families willing to pay for passage.  Simulated newscasts announce delays and setbacks as scientists are lured to the private ark ship.  As the neutron star enters our solar system, Saturn is destroyed, and the Earth experiences calamitous shifts in its seasons and bursts of radiation leading to fatalities and ecological damage.  The private ark ship, equipped with an antimatter engine, explodes when its antimatter containment fails.  Families are potentially broken up as they prepare to board the remaining ark ship, and experts discuss the basic necessities for human life: bacteria, air, water, and food. Bacteria are easily stored, and air is synthesized from water. Food, however, remains a difficult problem, and experts propose that colonists will eat insects and algae, which are easily replenished and space efficient.

The ark ship launches and quickly speeds away, a few days later the neutron star is close enough that its [[tidal force]] begins to deform the [[Earth's core]] and the crust, which causes massive earthquakes and volcanism.  Next, the gravity from the neutron star tears away the surface, causing the crust to shatter and the hot interior of Earth to spill out into the vacuum of space, destroying the Earth, but only the colonists on the ark can witness this event, as the rest of humanity had already been wiped out.  The colonists continue their journey to [[Barnard's Star]]; experts discuss the potential for mutiny and factionalism, ultimately rejecting them as unlikely, as strong family and societal bonds will be emphasized.  The journey is estimated to take approximately eighty-eight years, and the youngest of the original crew survive to see the new planet, which potentially harbors other lifeforms.  Experts conclude that the scenario, though unlikely, is possible and requires preparation from the world's governments.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3308">The '''exhaustion of intellectual property rights''' constitutes one of the limits of [[intellectual property]] (IP) rights. Once a given product has been sold under the authorization of the IP owner, the reselling, rental, lending and other third party commercial uses of IP-protected goods in domestic and international markets is governed by the principle.&lt;ref name=wipo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/sme/en/ip_business/export/international_exhaustion.htm|title=International Exhaustion and Parallel Importation|publisher=WIPO|accessdate=23 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a product covered by an IP right, such as by a [[patent]] right, has been sold by the IP right owner or by others with the consent of the owner, the IP right is said to be exhausted. It can no longer be exercised by the owner.&lt;ref name=wipo/&gt; This limitation is also referred to as the '''exhaustion doctrine''' or '''first sale doctrine'''.&lt;ref name=wipo/&gt; For example, if an inventor obtains a patent on a new kind of umbrella, the inventor (or anyone else to whom he sells his patent) can legally prohibit other companies from making and selling this kind of umbrella, but can not prohibit customers who have bought this umbrella from the patent owner from reselling the umbrella to third parties. There is a "fairly broad consensus" throughout the world "that this applies at least within the context of the domestic market".&lt;ref name=wipo/&gt; This is the concept of "national exhaustion". However, "[t]here is less consensus as to what extent the sale of an IP protected product abroad can exhaust the IP rights over this product in the context of domestic law."&lt;ref name=wipo/&gt; This is the concept of "regional exhaustion" or "international exhaustion". The rules and legal implications of the exhaustion largely differ depending on the country of importation, i.e. the national jurisdiction.&lt;ref name=wipo/&gt;

The legal concept of international exhaustion is much more controversial, and is recognized in some countries but not in others. The importation, in a country that recognizes the concept of international exhaustion, of a product sold in a foreign country with the authorization of the IP right owner cannot be prevented by the IP right owner.&lt;ref&gt;The United States Supreme Court adopted the doctrine of international exhaustion in ''[[Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.]]'' for US copyright law, and in that decision explained the general rationale for the doctrine under [[common law]] principles of property rights.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] (TRIPS), an international agreement administered by the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), does not address the issue of exhaustion of intellectual property rights.&lt;ref&gt;Article 6 TRIPS: "For the purposes of dispute settlement under this Agreement, subject to the provisions of Articles 3 and 4 nothing in this Agreement shall be used to address the issue of the exhaustion of intellectual property rights."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Four discourses''' is a concept developed by French psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]]. He argued that there were four fundamental types of '''discourse'''. He defined four discourses, which he called Master, University, Hysteric and Analyst, and suggested that these relate dynamically to one another&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Neill|first=Calum|date=2013-06-01|title=Breaking the text: An introduction to Lacanian discourse analysis|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0959354312473520|journal=Theory &amp; Psychology|language=en|volume=23|issue=3|pages=334–350|doi=10.1177/0959354312473520|issn=0959-3543}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 
 
*'''Discourse of the University''' – Provision and worship of "objective" knowledge — usually in the unacknowledged service of some external master discourse.
*'''Discourse of the Master''' – Struggle for mastery / domination / penetration.  Based on Hegel's [[master–slave dialectic]]. 
*'''Discourse of the Hysteric''' – Symptoms embodying and revealing resistance to the prevailing master discourse.
*'''Discourse of the Analyst''' – Deliberate subversion of the prevailing master discourse.

Lacan's theory of the four discourses was initially developed in 1969, perhaps in response to the events of social unrest during [[May 1968 in France]], but also through his discovery of what he believed were deficiencies in the orthodox reading of the [[Oedipus complex|Oedipus Complex]]. The Four Discourses theory is presented in his seminar ''L'envers de la psychanalyse'' and in ''Radiophonie'', where he starts using "discourse" as a social bond founded in [[intersubjectivity]].  He uses the term discourse to stress the transindividual nature of language: speech always implies another subject.

==Necessity of Formalising Psychoanalysis==

Prior to the development of the Four Discourses, the primary guideline for clinical psychoanalysis was Freud's Oedipus Complex. In Lacan's Seminar of 1969-70, Lacan argues that the terrifying Oedipal father that Freud invoked was already castrated at the point of intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=stanford encyclopedia of philosophy |website=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/lacan/#sect2.4.1 |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The castration was symbolic rather than physical. In an effort to stem analysts' tendency to project their own[[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)|imaginary]] readings and neurotic fantasies onto psychoanalysis, Lacan worked to formalise psychoanalytic theory with mathematical functions with renewed focus on the semiology of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]. This would ensure only a minimum of teaching is lost when communicated and also provide the conceptual architecture to limit the [[Free association (psychology)|associations]] of the analyst.

==Structure==

Discourse, in the first place, refers to a point where [[Langue and parole|speech and language]] intersect. The four discourses represent the four possible formulations of the symbolic network which social bonds can take and can be expressed as the permutations of a four-term configuration showing the relative positions — the agent, the other, the product and the truth — of four terms, [[the subject]], the [[master signifier]], [[knowledge]] and [[objet petit a]].

The four positions in each discourse are :

Agent = Upper left. This is the speaker of the discourse

Other = Upper right. This is what the discourse is addressed to

Product = Lower right. This is what the discourse has created

Truth = Lower left. This is what the discourse attempted to express

The four variables which occupy these positions are :

S1 = the master signifier

S2 = knowledge (''le savoir'')

$  = the subject (barred)

a  = the [[objet petit a]] or surplus-''jouissance''

S1 refers to "the marked circle of the field of the Other," it is the Master-Signifier. S2 is the "battery of signifiers, already there" at the place where "one wants to determine the status of a discourse as status of statement," that is knowledge (''savoir''). S1 comes into play in a signifying battery conforming the network of knowledge. $ is the subject, marked by the unbroken line (''trait unaire'') which represents it and is different from the living individual who is not the locus of this subject. Add the ''objet petit a'', the object-waste or the loss of the object that occurred when the originary division of the subject took place — the object that is the cause of desire: the ''plus-de-jouir''.

'''Discourse of the Master''':

It is the basic discourse from which the other three derive. The dominant position is occupied by the master signifier, S1, which represents the subject, S, for all other signifiers: S2. In this signifying operation there is a surplus: ''objet a''. All attempts at totalisation are doomed to fail. This discourse masks the division of the subject, it illustrates the structure of the dialectic of the master and the slave. The master, S1, is the agent who puts the slave, S2, to work: the result is a surplus, ''objet a'', that the master struggles to appropriate.

'''Discourse of the University''':

It is caused by an anticlockwise quarter turn of the previous discourse. The dominant position is occupied by knowledge (''savoir''). An attempt to mastery can be traced behind the endeavors to impart neutral knowledge: domination of the other to whom knowledge is transmitted. This hegemony is visible in modernity with science.

'''Discourse of the Hysteric''':

It is effected by a clockwise quarter turn of the discourse of the master. It is not simply "that which is uttered by the hysteric," but a certain kind of articulation in which any subject may be inscribed. The divided subject, $, the symptom, is in the pole position. This discourse points toward knowledge. "The cure involves the structural introduction of the discourse of the hysteric by way of artificial conditions": the analyst hystericizes the analysand's discourse.

'''Discourse of the Analyst''':

It is produced by a quarter turn of the discourse of the hysteric in the same way as Freud develops psychoanalysis by giving an interpretative turn to the discourse of his hysterical patients. The position of the agent — the analyst — is occupied by ''objet a'': the analyst becomes the cause of the analysand's desire. This discourse being the reverse of the discourse of the master, does it make psychoanalysis an essentially subversive practice which undermines attempts at domination and mastery?

==Relevance for cultural studies==

[[Slavoj Žižek]] uses the theory to explain various cultural artefacts, including ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' and ''[[Parsifal]]''.

'''Gratitude''', '''thankfulness''', or '''gratefulness''', from the Latin word ''gratus'' ‘pleasing, thankful’,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/gratitude|title=Definition of Gratitude - Oxford Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a feeling of appreciation felt by and/or similar positive response shown by the recipient of kindness, gifts, help, favors, or other types of generosity, towards the giver of such gifts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/gratitude|title=Definition of Gratitude - Cambridge Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The experience of gratitude has historically been a focus of several world [[religion]]s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Emmons, Robert A., and Cheryl A. Crumpler. "Gratitude as a Human Strength: Appraising the Evidence." Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology 19.1 (2000): 56-69. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been a topic of interest to ancient, medieval and modern philosophers, and continues to engage contemporary philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;Manela, Tony. [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/gratitude/ Gratitude.] In Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, edited by Edward N. Zalta, 2015. [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/gratitude/]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The systematic study of gratitude within psychology only began around the year 2000, possibly because psychology traditionally  focused more on understanding distress than on understanding positive emotions. The study of gratitude within psychology has focused on the understanding of the short term experience of the emotion of gratitude (state gratitude), individual differences in how frequently people feel gratitude ([[trait theory|trait]] gratitude), and the relationship between these two aspects.&lt;ref name="WoodEmotion"&gt;Wood, A. M., Maltby, J., Stewart, N., Linley, P. A., &amp; Joseph, S. (2008). [http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/alex.wood/state%20and%20trait%20gratitude.pdf A social-cognitive model of trait and state levels of gratitude].''Emotion, 8'', 281-290.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCullough, M.

==Comparison with indebtedness==
Gratitude is not the same as ''indebtedness''. While both [[emotions]] occur following help, indebtedness occurs when a person perceives that they are under an obligation to make some repayment of compensation for the aid.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, M. S. (1980). ''A theory of indebtedness''. In K. J. Gergen, M. S. Greenberg &amp; R. H. Wills (Eds.), Social exchange: Advances in theory and research: New York: Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt; The emotions lead to different actions; indebtedness can motivate the recipient of the aid to avoid the person who has helped them, whereas gratitude can motivate the recipient to seek out their benefactor and to improve their relationship with them.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, P. C., Scheer, J., Ovnicek, M., &amp; Kolts, R. (2006). The debt of gratitude: Dissociating gratitude and indebtedness. ''Cognition and Emotion, 20'', 217-241, {{doi|10.1080/02699930500172291}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tsang, J. A. (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a motivator of behavior==
Gratitude may also serve to reinforce future prosocial behavior in benefactors. For example, one experiment found that customers of a jewelry store who were called and thanked showed a subsequent 70% increase in purchases. In comparison, customers who were called and told about a sale showed only a 30% increase in purchases, and customers who were not called at all did not show an increase.&lt;ref&gt;Carey, J. R., Clicque, S. H., Leighton, B. A., &amp; Milton, F. (1976). A test of positive reinforcement of customers. ''Journal of Marketing, 40'', 98-100.&lt;/ref&gt; In another study, regular patrons of a restaurant gave bigger tips when servers wrote "Thank you" on their checks.&lt;ref&gt;Rind, B., &amp; Bordia, P. (1995). Effect of server's "Thank you" and personalization on restaurant tipping. ''Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 25'', 745-751.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious approaches ==
The link between spirituality and gratitude has recently become a popular subject of study. While these two characteristics are certainly not dependent on each other, studies have found that spirituality is capable of enhancing a person’s ability to be grateful and therefore, those who regularly attend religious services or engage in religious activities are more likely to have a greater sense of gratitude in all areas of life.&lt;ref name="McCullough, M.E. 2002"&gt;McCullough, M.E., Emmons, R.A., &amp; Tsang, J. (2002). The grateful disposition: A conceptual and empirical topography. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 83, 112-127&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/labs/emmons/ |title=Highlights from the Research Project of Gratitude and Thankfulness |author1=Emmons, Robert A. |author2=Michael E.

For this reason, it is one of the most common emotions that religions aim to provoke and maintain in followers and is regarded as a universal religious sentiment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Emmons, Robert A., and Teresa T. Kneezel. "Giving Gratitude: Spiritual and Religious Correlates of Gratitude." Journal of Psychology and Christianity 24.2 (2005): 140-48. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewish conceptions===
In Judaism, gratitude is an essential part of the act of worship and a part of every aspect of a worshiper’s life. According to the Hebrew worldview, all things come from God and because of this, gratitude is extremely important to the followers of Judaism. The Hebrew Scriptures are filled with the idea of gratitude. Two examples included in the psalms are "O Lord my God, I will give thanks to you forever," and "I will give thanks to the Lord with my whole heart"  (Ps. 30:12; Ps. 9:1). The Jewish prayers also often incorporate gratitude beginning with the Shema, where the worshiper states that out of gratitude, "You shall love the Eternal, your God, with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your might" (Deut. 6:5). One of the crucial blessings in the central thrice-daily prayer, the "Amidah", is called "Modim" - "We give thanks to You"; this is also the only blessing which is recited by the congregation together with the leader during their repetition of the Amidah. The concluding prayer, the Alenu, also speaks of gratitude by thanking God for the particular destiny of the Jewish people. Along with these prayers, faithful worshipers recite more than one hundred blessings called berachot throughout the day.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; In Judaism there is also a major emphasis on gratitude for acts of human kindness and goodness.

===Christian conceptions ===
[[File:GuadalupeNOLA15Oct07Thanks.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[New Orleans]]: Thank you message in the grotto of [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]] Church; added by those for whom prayer or miracles were granted]]

Gratitude has been said to mold and shape the entire Christian life. [[Martin Luther]] referred to gratitude as "The basic Christian attitude" and today it is still referred to as "the heart of the gospel."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Christians are strongly encouraged to praise and give gratitude to their creator. In Christian gratitude, God is seen as the selfless giver of all good things and because of this, there is a deep sense of gratefulness which enables Christians to share a common bond, shaping all aspects of a follower’s life. Gratitude in Christianity is an acknowledgment of God’s generosity that inspires Christians to shape their own thoughts and actions around such ideals.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Instead of simply a sentimental feeling, Christian gratitude is regarded as a virtue that shapes not only emotions and thoughts but also actions and deeds.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
[[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]] writes in his ''A Treatise Concerning Religious Affections'' that gratitude and thankfulness toward God are among the signs of true religion. Because of this interpretation, modern measures of religious spirituality include assessments of thankfulness and gratitude towards God. Allport (1950) suggested that mature religious intentions come from feelings of profound gratitude and Edwards (1746/1959) claimed that the "affection" of gratitude is one of the most accurate ways of finding the presence of God in a person’s life. In a study done by Samuels and Lester (1985) it was contended that in a small sample of Catholic nuns and priests, out of 50 emotions, love and gratitude were the most experienced emotion towards God.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

In the Orthodox, Catholic and Anglican churches, the most important rite is called the [[Eucharist]]; the name derives from the Greek word eucharistia for thanksgiving.

===Islamic conceptions ===
The Islamic sacred text, The Quran, is filled with the idea of gratitude.  Islam encourages its followers to be grateful and express thanks to God in all circumstances. Islamic teaching emphasizes the idea that those who are grateful will be rewarded with more. A traditional Islamic saying states that, "The first who will be summoned to paradise are those who have praised God in every circumstance"&lt;ref name="WoodPsychologist"&gt;Wood, A. M., Joseph, S., &amp; Linley, P. A. (2007). [http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/alex.wood/gratitude%20psychologist.pdf Gratitude: The parent of all virtues.] ''The Psychologist, 20'', 18-21&lt;/ref&gt; In the Quran it is also stated in Sura 14 that those who are grateful will be given more by God. The prophet Muhammad also said, "Gratitude for the abundance you have received is the best insurance that the abundance will continue."{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}
Many practices of the Islamic faith also encourage gratitude. The Pillar of Islam calling for daily prayer encourages believers to pray to God five times a day in order to thank him for his goodness. The pillar of fasting during the month of Ramadan is for the purpose of putting the believer in a state of gratitude.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

== Individual differences ==
Much of the recent work psychological research into gratitude has focused on the nature of individual difference in gratitude, and the consequences of being a more or less grateful person.&lt;ref name="WoodPsychologist" /&gt; Three [[scale (social sciences)|scales]] have been developed to measure individual differences in gratitude, each of which assesses somewhat different conceptions.&lt;ref name="WoodFactor"&gt;Wood, A. M., Maltby, J., Stewart, N., &amp; Joseph, S. (2008). [http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/alex.wood/Gratitude%20and%20appreciation%20factor%20analysis.pdf Conceptualizing gratitude and appreciation as a unitary personality trait.] ''Personality and Individual Differences, 44'', 619-630.&lt;/ref&gt; The GQ6&lt;ref name="McCullough, M. E. 2002"&gt;McCullough, M. E., Emmons, R. A., &amp; Tsang, J. (2002). The grateful disposition: A conceptual and empirical topography. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 82'', 112-127.&lt;/ref&gt; measures individual differences in how frequently and intensely people feel gratitude. The Appreciation Scale&lt;ref&gt;Adler, M. G., &amp; Fagley, N. S. (2005). Appreciation: Individual differences in finding value and meaning as a unique predictor of subjective well-being.

''[[Social Behavior and Personality]]', 31'', 431-451.&lt;/ref&gt; assesses gratitude towards other people, gratitude towards the world in general, and a lack of resentment for what you do not have. A recent study showed that each of these scales are actually all measuring the same way of approaching life; this suggests that individual differences in gratitude include all of these components.&lt;ref name="WoodFactor" /&gt;

==Empirical findings==

===Association with well-being===
A large body of recent{{when|date=July 2016}} work has suggested that people who are more grateful have higher levels of [[subjective well-being]]. Grateful people are happier, less depressed, less stressed, and more satisfied with their lives and [[social relationship]]s.&lt;ref name="McCullough, M. E. 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WoodSatisfaction"&gt;Wood, A. M., Joseph, S., &amp; Maltby, J. (2008).

Gratitude has been said{{By whom|date=March 2013}} to have one of the strongest links with [[mental health]] of any character trait. Numerous studies suggest that grateful people are more likely to have higher levels of happiness and lower levels of stress and depression.&lt;ref name="WoodPsychologist"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McCullough, M. E. 2004"&gt;McCullough, M. E., Tsang, J., &amp; Emmons, R.A. (2004). Gratitude in Intermediate affective terrain: Links of grateful moods with individual differences and daily emotional experience. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 86, 295-309.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.psypost.org/2015/08/grateful-individuals-tend-to-experience-less-depressive-symptoms-36850|title=Grateful individuals tend to experience less depressive symptoms|website=PsyPost|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many emotions and personality traits are important to well-being, there is evidence that gratitude may be uniquely important. First, a longitudinal study showed that people who were more grateful coped better with a life transition. Specifically, people who were more grateful before the transition were less stressed, less depressed, and more satisfied with their relationships three months later.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, A. M., Maltby, J., Gillett, R., Linley, P. A., &amp; Joseph, S. (2008). [http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/alex.wood/gratitude%20longitudinal.pdf The role of gratitude in the development of social support, stress, and depression: Two longitudinal studies.] ''Journal of Research in Personality, 42'', 854-871.&lt;/ref&gt; Second, two recent studies have suggested that gratitude may have a unique relationship with well-being, and can explain aspects of well-being that other personality traits cannot. Both studies showed that gratitude was able to explain more well-being than the [[Big five personality traits|Big Five]] and 30 of the most commonly studied personality traits.&lt;ref name="WoodSatisfaction" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WoodEudamonic" /&gt;

===Relationship to altruism===
Gratitude has also been shown to improve a person’s altruistic tendencies. One study conducted by David DeSteno and Monica Bartlett (2010) found that gratitude is correlated with economic generosity. In this study, using an economic game, increased gratitude was shown to directly mediate increased monetary giving. From these results, this study shows that grateful people are more likely to sacrifice individual gains for communal profit (DeSteno &amp; Bartlett, 2010).  A study conducted by McCullough, Emmons, &amp; Tsang, (2002) found similar correlations between gratitude and empathy, generosity, and helpfulness.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=20364907|year=2010|author1=Desteno|first1=D|title=Gratitude as moral sentiment: Emotion-guided cooperation in economic exchange|journal=Emotion|volume=10|issue=2|pages=289–93|last2=Bartlett|first2=M.

===Psychological interventions===
Given that gratitude appears to be a strong determinant of people's well-being, several psychological interventions have been developed to increase gratitude.&lt;ref name="WoodPsychologist" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emmons, R. A. &amp; McCullough, M. E. (2003). Counting blessings versus burdens: An experimental investigation of gratitude and subjective well-being in daily life. ''[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]],  84'', 377-389. [http://psy.miami.edu/faculty/mmccullough/Gratitude-Related20Stuff/Emmons_McCullough_2003_JPSP.pdf (electronic copy)]{{dead link|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Watkins and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, P. C., Woodward, K., Stone, T., &amp; Kolts, R. L. (2003). Gratitude and happiness: Development of a measure of gratitude, and relationships with subjective well-being. ''Social Behavior and Personality, 31'', 431-452.&lt;/ref&gt; had participants test a number of different gratitude exercises, such as thinking about a living person for whom they are grateful, writing about someone for whom they are grateful, and writing a letter to deliver to someone for whom they are grateful. Participants in the control condition were asked to describe their living room. Participants who engaged in a gratitude exercise showed increases in their experiences of positive emotion immediately after the exercise, and this effect was strongest for participants who were asked to think about a person for whom they are grateful. Participants who had grateful personalities to begin with showed the greatest benefit from these gratitude exercises. In another study concerning gratitude, participants were randomly assigned to one of six therapeutic intervention conditions designed to improve the participants' overall quality of life (Seligman et al., 2005).&lt;ref&gt;Seligman, M. E. P., Steen, T. A., Park, N.,&amp; Peterson, C. (2005). Positive psychology progress: Empirical validation of interventions. ''American Psychologist'', 60, 410-421.&lt;/ref&gt; Out of these conditions, it was found that the biggest short-term effects came from a "gratitude visit" where participants wrote and delivered a letter of gratitude to someone in their life. This condition showed a rise in happiness scores by 10 percent and a significant fall in depression scores, results which lasted up to one month after the visit. Out of the six conditions, the longest lasting effects were associated with the act of writing "[[gratitude journal]]s" where participants were asked to write down three things they were grateful for every day. These participants’ happiness scores also increased and continued to increase each time they were tested periodically after the experiment. In fact, the greatest benefits were usually found to occur around six months after treatment began. This exercise was so successful that although participants were only asked to continue the journal for a week, many participants continued to keep the journal long after the study was over. Similar results have been found from studies conducted by Emmons and McCullough (2003)&lt;ref name="McCullough, M.E. 2002"/&gt; and Lyubomirsky et. all. (2005). See also [[gratitude journal]].

Recently (2013), the [[Greater Good Science Center]] at the [[University of California|University of California, Berkeley]], has been offering awards for dissertation-level research projects with the greatest potential to advance the science and practice of gratitude.&lt;ref&gt;[http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/expandinggratitude/dissertation_research_awards Greater Good Science Center: Research awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conclusions==
According to [[Cicero]], "Gratitude is not only the greatest of the virtues but the parent of all others." Multiple studies have shown the correlation between gratitude and increased wellbeing not only for the individual but for all people involved.&lt;ref name="McCullough, M. E. 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The positive psychology movement has embraced these studies and in an effort to increase overall well-being, has begun to make an effort to incorporate exercises to increase gratitude into the movement. Although in the past gratitude has been neglected by psychology, in recent years much progress has been made in studying gratitude and its positive effects.

'''Immorality''' is the violation of [[morality|moral]] [[law]]s, [[Norm (social)|norm]]s or standards. Immorality is normally applied to people or actions, or in a broader sense, it can be applied to groups or corporate bodies, beliefs, religions, and works of art.

==Aristotle==
[[Aristotle]] saw many vices as excesses or deficits in relation to some virtue, as cowardice and rashness relate to courage. Some attitudes and actions{{snd}}such as [[envy]], [[murder]], and [[theft]]{{snd}}he saw as [[wrong]] in themselves, with no question of a deficit/excess in relation to the [[Golden mean (philosophy)|mean]].&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Ethics'' (1976) p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion and sexuality==
Immorality is often closely linked with both [[religion and sexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;B. Kirkpatrick ed, ''Roget's Thesaurus'' (1998) pp. 650 and 670&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Weber]] saw rational articulated religions as engaged in a long-term struggle with more physical forms of religious experience linked to dance, intoxication and sexual activity.&lt;ref&gt;Max Weber, ''The Sociology of Religion'' (1971) p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; [[Durkheim]] pointed out how many primitive rites culminated in abandoning the distinction between licit and immoral behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Émile Durkheim, ''The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life'' (1971) p. 383&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Freud]]'s dour conclusion was that "In every age immorality has found no less support in religion than morality has".&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''Civilization, Society and Religion'' (PFL 12) p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual immorality==
{{See also|Paraphilia}}

Coding of sexual behavior has historically been a feature of all human societies, as too; has been the policing of breaches of its [[mores]]{{snd}}sexual immorality{{snd}}by means of formal and [[informal social control]].&lt;ref&gt;F. Dabhoiwala, 'The first sexual revolution', ''The Oxford Historian'' X (2012) p. 426&lt;/ref&gt; Interdictions and [[taboo]]s among primitive societies&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, p. 410&lt;/ref&gt; were arguably no less severe than in traditional agrarian societies.&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''On Sexuality'' (PFL 7) p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter, the degree of control might vary from time to time and region to region, being least in urban settlements;&lt;ref&gt;E. Ladurie, ''Montaillou'' (1980) p. 149 and p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; however, only the last three centuries of intense urbanisation, commercialisation and modernisation have broken with the restrictions of the pre-modern world,&lt;ref&gt;Dabhoiwala, p. 41–3&lt;/ref&gt; in favor of a successor society of fractured and competing sexual codes and subcultures, where sexual expression is integrated into the workings of the commercial world.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Marcuse, ''One-Dimensional Man'' (2002) p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, while the meaning of sexual immorality has been drastically redefined in recent times, arguably the boundaries of what is acceptable remain publicly policed and as highly charged as ever, as the decades-long debates in the US over reproductive rights after ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', or 21st-century [[Internet Watch Foundation and Wikipedia|controversy over child images on Wikipedia]] and Amazon would tend to suggest.&lt;ref&gt;A. Lih, ''The Wikipedia Revolution'' (2010) p. 204–9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modernity==
[[Michel Foucault]] considered that the modern world was unable to put forward a coherent [[morality]]&lt;ref&gt;G, Gutting ed., ''The Cambridge Companion to Foucault'' (2003) p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;{{snd}}an inability underpinned philosophically by [[emotivism]]. Nevertheless, [[modernism]] has often been accompanied by a cult of immorality,&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''Games People Play'' (1966) p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; as for example when [[John Ciardi]] acclaimed [[Naked Lunch]] as "a monumentally moral descent into the hell of narcotic addiction".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in J. Campbell, ''This is the Beat Generation'' (1999) p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;

==Immoral psychoanalysis==
[[Psychoanalysis]] received much early criticism for being the unsavory product of an immoral town{{snd}}Vienna; psychoanalysts for being both unscrupulous and dirty-minded.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''Freud'' (1989) p. 194-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud himself however was of the opinion that "anyone who has succeeded in educating himself to truth about himself is permanently defended against the danger of immorality, even though his standard of morality may differ".&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (PFL 1) p. 485-6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary references==
*When questioned by a proof-reader whether his description of [[Meleager of Gadara|Meleager]] as the immoral poet should be immor''t''al poet, [[T. E. Lawrence]] replied: "Immorality I know. Immortality I cannot judge. As you please: Meleager will not sue us for libel".&lt;ref&gt;T. E. Lawrence, ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom'' (1936) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[De Quincey]] set out an (inverted) hierarchy of immorality in his study [[On Murder Considered as one of the Fine Arts]]: "if once a man indulges himself in murder, very soon he comes to think little of robbing; and from robbing he comes next to drinking and Sabbath-breaking, and from that to procrastination and incivility...this downward path".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas De Quincey, ''On Murder Considered as one of the Fine Arts'' (2004) p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICP has offices in both Bern and Morges (Switzerland). It is accredited ECOSOC &lt;ref name=ECOSOC&gt;[http://csonet.org/content/documents/e2013inf6.pdf Database of NGOs granted with consultative status with ECOSOC]&lt;/ref&gt; and certified EDUQUA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eduqua.ch List of all certified EDUQUA institutions]&lt;/ref&gt; It is active in the following countries: Switzerland, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Morocco, Azerbaijan and Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;KOFF (Swisspeace) Interactive Map and Database on NGOs' regions of action [http://koff.swisspeace.ch/who-is-involved/]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==

The ICP offers mediation services on the one hand, and organizes peace mediation trainings and workshops on the other hand. Hence it is active both in mediation and in the promotion of peacebuilding through education, in Switzerland and abroad.

The ICP holds a Konfliktbüro (conflict office) in Bern. The office proposes mediation services to enterprises, institutions and administrations as well as to individuals. The advanced training Die Kunst der Konfliktbearbeitung (The Art of Conflict Transformation) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iicp.ch/cas ICP's Die Kunst der Konfliktbearbeitung website]&lt;/ref&gt; is recognized by the Swiss Federation for Mediation Associations (SDM-FSM) &lt;ref&gt;Organizations recognized by the Swiss Federation for Mediation Associations [http://www.infomediation.ch/cms/tab_ausbildungslehrgaenge.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and organized in partnership with the University of Basel.

Every summer since 2008, the ICP organizes the International Summer Academy and Forum on Peace Mediation and National Dialogue,&lt;ref&gt;International Academy and Forum on Peace Mediation and National Dialogue website [http://www.iicp.ch/summer-academy]&lt;/ref&gt; which is a mediation and peacebuilding training taking place in Caux (Montreux, Switzerland). This one-week course allows participants to attend classes about peace mediation and to take advantage of the skills and knowledge of international experts in the field. Participants also acquire practical skills through peace mediation simulations. Each year, the focus of the course changes slightly: new topics are introduced and other perspectives presented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iicp.ch/summer-academy/history-overview International Summer Academy and Forum: History Overview]&lt;/ref&gt; Participants in the Summer Academy can also decide to attend the International Peace-builders' Forum,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caux.ch/en/International-Peacebuilders-Forum-IPF The International Peacebuilders Forum]&lt;/ref&gt; which takes place in Caux, usually just before the beginning of the Summer Academy.

The Institute for Conflict Transformation and Peacebuilding is jointly involved with the Universities of Basel, Belgrade, Sarajevo and Zagreb in the creation of a regional Master in Peace Studies in South-East Europe &lt;ref&gt;[http://see-peace.net Regional Master's in Peace Studies]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intellectual humility''' is often described as an [[intellectual virtue]], along with other perceived virtues such as [[open-mindedness]], intellectual courage and integrity, and in contrast to proposed intellectual vices, such as [[pride]] and arrogance. See "Doxastic Definition of Intellectual Humility."

== Importance of intellectual humility ==

There is widespread agreement among philosophers and psychologists that intellectual humility is important and valuable in some way, especially if one is going to engage with deep disagreements in a productive way. However, there is little consensus about the precise nature of intellectual humility. For example, some philosophers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whitcomb|first=Dennis|last2=Battaly|first2=Heather|last3=Baehr|first3=Jason|last4=Howard-Snyder|first4=Daniel|date=2015-08-01|title=Intellectual Humility: Owning Our Limitations|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/phpr.12228/abstract|journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research|language=en|pages=n/a–n/a|doi=10.1111/phpr.12228|issn=1933-1592}}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasise the importance of a disposition to own one’s particular limitations (e.g. the limitations of one’s knowledge and perspective), while others{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} focus on the connection between humility and a low concern for status. Meanwhile, psychologists such as [[Justin L. Barrett|Justin Barrett]] and Peter Hill are working on better understanding the science behind intellectual humility, and on developing accurate measures{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} that can tell us more about how to quantify humility.

 To this we must add that the participation of intellectual humility should not be prescribed, because when it is in a circle in which all the actors know the topic to be addressed, but for their private evidence are closed to the arguments to the contrary, intellectual arrogance (See "Intellectual Arrogance" defined in Section "A Virutous Mean" is unproductive and inappropriate because what is not being sought with this discussion is the exposure of all the evidence in a "game" to sudden death, according to the weight of the evidence that won the discussion; this allows the elimination of "Pilate's washing his hands", of not taking certain evidence as real and proven by mere caprice of evidence left in the deprivation. This leads to asperities within the discussion, but forces to set a clear and concise precedent, which is productive for the human advance within the religious discussions. That is, not to go to the intellectual humility to endure a discussion gives a stratum of understanding that can not continue to overlap business under the table of any kind.{{explain|date=December 2017}} Endowing class and honor also puts the chest for its evidence defended and known true from the beginning.{{explain|date=December 2017}}

== Doxastic definition of intellectual humility ==

Drs. Ian M. Church and Peter L. Samuelson proposed a [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/self-knowledge/ doxastic] &lt;ref&gt;1&lt;/ref&gt; account of intellectual humility. They considered intellectual humility as a virtue, one of valuing one’s own beliefs "as he or she ought.” &lt;ref&gt;2&lt;/ref&gt;

=== A “Virtuous Mean” ===

With this “as he or she ought” as the guiding principle, Church and Samuelson proposed: “Prima facie, humility is the virtuous mean between arrogance, on the one hand, and self depreciation or diffidence on the other." &lt;ref&gt;2&lt;/ref&gt;

People are intellectually arrogant when they erroneously evaluate their intellectual capacity higher than warranted (“smarter than average).&lt;ref&gt;2&lt;/ref&gt;  This results in the intellectually arrogant person being more closed-minded and biased than the intellectually humble person.

People who are intellectually diffident are those who fail “to appropriately recognize or appreciate their intellectual achievements.” &lt;ref&gt;2&lt;/ref&gt; Such a person is less inclined to speak out when he or she encounters wrong information.

=== Advantages to Doxastic Intellectual Humility ===

Drs. Church and Samuelson cite several advantages of this treatment of intellectual humility as a virtue. By adopting such an approach, one is better equipped to counter a natural tendency to overestimate one's strengths, and underestimate one’s weakness, thus countering confirmation bias. 2 Church and Samuelson further propose that by being open to the viewpoint of others, one positions oneself for growth and learning.

The doxastic definition of intellectual humility does not necessarily [missing verb] that one abandon[s] one’s beliefs, only that one [is/be] open to new and alternative viewpoints.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1333">In [[mathematics]], in the field of  [[differential geometry]], an '''Iwasawa manifold''' is a compact quotient of a 3-dimensional complex [[Heisenberg group]] by a [[cocompact]], [[Discrete group|discrete]] subgroup.  An 
Iwasawa manifold is a [[nilmanifold]], of real dimension 6.

Iwasawa manifolds give examples where the first two terms ''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''E''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of the [[Frölicher spectral sequence]] are not isomorphic. 

As a [[complex manifold]], such an Iwasawa manifold is an important example of
a compact complex manifold which does not admit any [[Kähler metric]].

Traditional '''Japanese political values''' are commonly characterized by a strong [[community]] sense and [[Peer group|group]] [[wikt:solidarity|solidarity]] and the importance of personal connections and [[consensus]] building. 

==Clichés and their critique==
Concerning [[Japanese values|values]], [[Politics of Japan|Japanese politics]] are generally described as pragmatic, limited by particularistic loyalties, and based on human relations rather than on [[ideology]] or principles. The quintessential Japanese leader is a network builder rather than the embodiment of [[charisma]] or ideals; more like the crafty and resourceful founder of the Tokugawa [[Shōgun|bakufu]], [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], than the ruthless but heroic [[Oda Nobunaga]]. Such political dynamics are evident, for example, in the workings of the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|LDP]], which has remained the strongest party since 1955 despite their 3-year loss of majority control in the early 1990s.

As clichés go, the success of [[Junichiro Koizumi]] showed that Japan may have just been in waiting for a charismatic, media-savvy politician{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. In the [[Japan general election, 2005|2005 House of Representatives election]], the personal voter relationship concept was challenged for the first time. So called "assassin candidates", with a pro-[[Japan Post|postal]] privatization agenda, were set against the "postal rebels", critics of postal reform, who were cast out of the LDP but still had local ties in their voting districts. Results were mixed, with some districts taken by the "rebels" and some by the "assassins".

Furthermore, the pragmatic, personalistic view of politics cannot explain [[Japanese militarism|Japan's militaristic past]], the political crises of the 1960s, the [[Controversies regarding the role of the Emperor of Japan|controversies surrounding the emperor]], [[Article 9 of the Constitution of Japan|Article 9]], or the unwillingness of many in the [[Social Democratic Party (Japan)|Social Democratic Party of Japan]], despite a huge political cost, to abandon their antiwar and revolutionary commitment in the early 1990s.

It also fails to account for the apparently sincerely held ideological beliefs of the wartime period. The "New Order in Greater East Asia" was legitimized on the basis of universal principles, such as "[[Pan-Asianism]]," "international justice," and "permanent peace," even if the results were quite the opposite. The non-ideological nature of mainstream Japanese politics in the postwar period reflects defeat in war, the failure after 1945 to find a national ideological consensus to replace discredited wartime beliefs, and the commitment of both elite and ordinary Japanese to expanding the economy and raising living standards. As these goals were attained, a complacent, largely apolitical "middle mass society" (a term coined by economist [[Murakami Yasusuke]]) emerged, in which 90 percent of the people in opinion polls consistently classified themselves as "[[middle class]]."

==Community and leadership==
Certain distinctive features of Japanese politics can be identified, although this is not to say that they are unique to Japan. Rather, qualities also found in other political systems, such as the importance of personal connections and consensus building, played an extraordinarily important role in Japanese politics. These features have deep historical roots and reflect values that pervade the society as a whole.

In both the feudal and the modern eras, a major problem for Japanese political leaders has been reconciling the goals of community survival and the welfare and self-respect of individuals in an environment of extreme scarcity. In recent centuries, Japan lacked the natural resources and space to accommodate its population comfortably. With the exception of [[Hokkaidō]] and colonial territories in Asia between 1895 and 1945, there was no "frontier" to absorb excess people. One solution was to ignore the welfare of large sectors of the population ([[peasant]]s and workers) and to use force when they expressed their discontent. Such coercive measures, common during both the [[Edo period|Tokugawa]] and the [[World War II]] periods, largely, although not entirely, disappeared in the postwar "welfare state" (for example, farmers were evicted from their land to construct the New [[Narita International Airport|Tokyo International Airport]] at Narita Sanrizuka in the 1970s after long negotiations had failed). But non-coercive, or mostly non-coercive, methods of securing popular compliance had developed to an extraordinary degree in social and political life.

The most important such method is the promotion of a strong sense of community consciousness and group solidarity. Japanese individuals are often characterized as having a strong sense of self-sacrifice and community dedication (see [[Japanese values]]). Historians and sociologists note that both traditional and modern Japanese communities—the [[Burakumin|buraku]], the [[Han (Japan)|feudal domain]] with its retinue of [[samurai]], the large commercial houses found in [[Edo]] (the future Tokyo), [[Osaka]], and [[Kyoto]] before 1868, and modern corporations and bureaucracies with their cohorts of lifetime employees—have striven to be all-inclusive. Such groups serve a variety of functions for the individual, providing not only income and sustenance but also emotional support and individual identity. Japanese called such community inclusiveness the "octopus-pot way of life" (''takotsubo seikatsu''). Large pots with narrow openings at the top are used by fishermen to capture octopuses, and the term is used to refer to people so wrapped up in their particular social group that they cannot see the world outside its confines.

The "group consciousness" model of Japanese social life, however, has been overstressed at times. A person may often go along with group demands because they serve self-interest in the long run (for example, political contributions may help secure future favors from those in office). Historically, democratic concepts of individual rights and limited government have been deeply appealing because they, too, promise protection of individual autonomy. Despite very different ethical and political traditions, the Japanese people were very receptive to imported liberal ideas both before and after 1945. [[John Stuart Mill]]'s essay [[On Liberty]], for example, was extremely popular during the [[Meiji period|Meiji era]].

Because individual, usually passive, resistance to group demands occurs, Japanese leaders have found the creation of a strong community sense to be a difficult and time-consuming task. Harmony ([[Wa (Japanese)|wa]]), that most prized social value, is not easily attained. One mechanism for achieving wa is the use of [[ritual]]s to develop a psychological sense of group [[Cultural identity|identity]]. Political parties and factions, the offices of national and local governments, businesses, university departments, research groups, alumni associations, and other groups sponsor frequent ceremonies and more informal parties for this purpose. A group's history and identity are carefully constructed through the use of songs and symbols (often resembling, in miniature, the Meiji government's creation of symbols of [[kokutai]] in the late nineteenth century). Often, an organization's founder, especially if deceased, is regarded as something of a [[Confucianism|Confucian]] sage or a [[Shinto]] [[kami]] (deity). Group members, however, may find that pervasive ritualism allows them to "go through the motions" (such as the chanting of banzai! ([[ten thousand years]]!) at the end of political rallies, without having to make a deeper commitment to the group.

A second mechanism to promote community solidarity is the building of hierarchical relationships. In this practice, the influence of premodern ethics is readily apparent. In what anthropologist [[Nakane Chie]] calls Japan's "vertical society," human relationships are defined in terms of inequality, and people relate to each other as superiors and inferiors along a minutely differentiated gradient of social status, not only within bureaucratic organizations, where it might be expected, but also in academic, artistic, and, especially, political worlds.

Hierarchy expresses itself along two dimensions: first, an internal community differentiation of rank by seniority, education, and occupational status; and second, the distinction between "[[insider]]s" and "outsiders," between members and nonmembers of the community, along with the ranking of whole groups or communities along a vertical continuum. Although internal hierarchy can cause [[Social alienation|alienation]] as inferiors chafe under the [[authority]] of their superiors, the external kind of [[hierarchy]] tends to strengthen group cohesion as individual members work to improve their group's relative ranking. The Japanese nation as a whole has been viewed as a single group by its people in relation to other nations. Intense [[nationalism]] has frequently been a manifestation of group members' desire to "catch up and overtake" the advanced ("superior") nations of the West, while the rights of non-Western nations, like [[China]] or [[Korea]], often viewed as "inferior," have been ignored.

Like group consciousness, however, the theme of hierarchy has been overstressed. Contemporary Japanese politics show a strong consciousness of equality, and even traditional communities, such as rural villages, were often egalitarian rather than hierarchical. [[Citizen and consumer movements in Japan|Citizens' movements]] of the 1960s and 1970s differed from older political organizations in their commitment to promoting intragroup democracy. In addressing the nation, Emperor [[Akihito]] used colloquial Japanese terms that stressed equality, rather than the formal, hierarchy-laden language of his predecessors.

Two mechanisms for lessening the hierarchy-generated tensions are the [[seniority]] principle and early retirement. As men or women grow older, gaining seniority within an organization, they acquire authority and higher status. The seniority principle is reinforced by the traditional reluctance to place younger persons in positions of authority over older ones. The institution of early retirement (top-ranked businesspeople and bureaucrats commonly retired at age fifty-five or sixty) helps to the keep the promotion of others smooth and predictable. The system also helps to enable talented individuals to succeed to the most responsible positions and prevents a small group of older persons (what the Japanese call "one-man leaders") from monopolizing leadership positions and imposing increasingly outmoded ideas on the organization. Elite retirees, however, often continue to wield influence as advisers and usually pursue second careers in organizations affiliated with the one from which they retired. (see [[Elderly people in Japan]])

The circulation of elites that results from the seniority and early retirement principles ensures that everyone within the upper ranks of the hierarchy has a turn at occupying a high-status position, such as a cabinet post in the national government. This principle, in turn, enables people to reward their followers. There has been, for example, a regular turnover of [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|LDP]] leaders. No individual has served as party president (and prime minister) longer than [[Sato Eisaku]], the incumbent between 1964 and 1972. The average tenure of party presidents / prime ministers between 1964 and 1987 was slightly more than three years. Frequent cabinet reshuffling meant that the average tenure of other cabinet ministers in the same period was a little less than a year. Japan has not been beset with leaders in their seventies and eighties unwilling to give up their powerful positions.

Another mechanism reducing intragroup tensions is the strong personal, rather than legalistic or ideological, ties between superior and subordinate. These ties are typically characterized in terms of fictive familial relationships, analogous to the bonds between parents and children (the ''[[oyabun]]-kobun [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]]''). The ideal leader is viewed as a paternalistic one, with a warm and personal concern for the welfare of his followers. For followers, loyalty is both morally prescribed and emotionally sustained by the system. In the political world, oyabun-kobun relationships are pervasive despite the formal commitment to universalistic, democratic values. At the same time, younger people find such relationships less appealing than their elders. The so-called ''[[shinjinrui]]'' (new human beings), born in the affluent 1960s and 1970s, were often criticized by older Japanese for being self-absorbed, egoistic, and "cool." The younger generation is inclined to view with disdain the emotional expression of paternalistic ties, such as in the 1989 television broadcasts of former Prime Minister [[Tanaka Kakuei]]'s supporters weeping profusely over his political retirement.

==Consensus Building==
The community is often demanding, but it is also fragile, because social ties are sustained not only through legal norms and common self-interest but also through the affective [[patron]]-client relationship. Open conflict poses a danger to the survival of this sort of community, and thus policy making requires elaborate consultation and consensus building, usually involving all the parties concerned in order to maintain [[Wa (Japanese culture)|wa]] (和), the notion of harmony within a group. According to political scientist [[Lewis Austin]], "everyone must be consulted informally, everyone must be heard, but not in such a way that the hearing of different opinions develops into opposition. The leader and his assistants `harmonize opinion'... in advance, using go-betweens to avert the confrontation of opposing forces." After a preliminary agreement among all has been reached, a formal meeting is held in which the agreed-upon policy will be proposed and adopted.

This process is called [[nemawashi]] (root trimming or binding), evoking the image of a gardener preparing a tree or shrub for transplanting, that is, a change in policy. Austin points out that a common Japanese verb meaning "to decide" (''matomeru'') literally means to gather or bring together. Decisions are "the sum of the contributions of all." Although consensus building is, for leaders, a time-consuming and emotionally exhausting process, it is necessary not only to promote group goals but also to respect and protect individual autonomy. In fact, the process represents reconciliation of the two. In the political system as a whole, most groups play some role in the ''nemawashi'' process. Exceptions are those groups or individuals, such as Koreans or other minority groups, who are viewed as outsiders.

Political leaders have to maintain solidarity and harmony within a single group and also secure the cooperation of different groups who are often in bitter conflict. ''Takotsubo seikatsu'' can promote destructive sectionalism. During World War II, rivalry between the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Imperial Army]] and the [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Imperial Navy]] was so intense that it was nearly impossible to coordinate their strategic operations. In the postwar political system, prime ministers have often been unable to persuade different ministries, all self-sufficient and intensely jealous "kingdoms," to go along with reforms in such areas as [[trade liberalization]]. Observers such as journalist [[Karel van Wolferen]], have concluded that Japan's political system is empty at the center, lacking real leadership or a locus of responsibility: "Statecraft in Japan is quite different from that in the rest of Asia, Europe, and the Americas. For centuries it has entailed the preservation of a careful balance of semiautonomous groups that share power… These semiautonomous components, each endowed with great discretionary powers, are not represented in one central ruling body." This view is probably exaggerated. Leadership in other countries, including the [[United States]], has been paralyzed from time to time by powerful interest groups, and some policies in Japan requiring decisive leadership, such as the creation of [[Social welfare in Japan|social welfare]] and energy conservation policies in the 1970s and the privatization of [[Japanese public corporations|state enterprises]] in the 1980s, have been reasonably successful.

'''Joseph Samuel Nathaniel Tross''' (April 2, 1889 – March 30, 1971) was an evangelist and civil rights leader. He was born in Berbice, [[British Guiana]], which is located in [[South America]], on April 2, 1889. He attended [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] and later moved to Canada in 1913. During [[World War I]] Tross moved to the [[United States]] and attended [[Harvard University]]. He earned a Ph.D. in religion at the [[University of Pittsburgh]]. In 1918 Tross married Geneva Hopkins. The couple eventually settled in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] where Tross continued his career as a pastor at several AME  and [[African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church|AME Zion]] churches in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://socialarchive.iath.virginia.edu/ark:/99166/w6k65ns7|title=Tross, J. S. Nathaniel (Joseph Samuel Nathaniel), 1889-1971.|website=socialarchive.iath.virginia.edu|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934 Tross wrote ''This Thing Called Religion''. A copy of his book is in the rare book collection of J Murrey Atkins Library.

Tross had many jobs. In 1940 he was president of the Community Crusaders, appearing before the Charlotte City Council to lobby for street lights in black neighborhoods. During World War II he was president of the Charlotte Rationing Board. After the war he lobbied for the employment of African Americans as police officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://beta.worldcat.org/archivegrid/collection/data/841574207|title=ArchiveGrid : Joseph Samuel Nathaniel Tross Collection, 1927-1971.|website=beta.worldcat.org|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1945 Tross began a weekly radio broadcast on WBT where he often discussed the idea of interracial goodwill in the community. He was the editor of ''[[The Charlotte Post]]'' an African American newspaper beginning in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rending the Veil|last=Bungarner-Davis|first=Marianne|publisher=UNC Charlotte|year=1971|isbn=|location=J Murrey Atkins Library|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960 Tross gained his American citizenship. As a result, he ran for a seat on the Charlotte School Board in 1994, 1966 and 1967, although he never won. In 1965 Tross met [[Lyndon B. Johnson|President Lyndon B Johnson]] at the [[White House]] and advised Johnson not to acknowledge protesters sitting in at the White House because speaking would tarnish the dignity of the office of president. This advice created a split in the civil rights movement and created tension between Tross and [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indigenous Civil Rights Movement|last=Griffin|first=Wille|publisher=UNC Charlotte|year=1972|isbn=|location=J Murrey Atkins Library|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YekTCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA154&amp;lpg=PA154&amp;dq=joseph+samuel+nathaniel+tross&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UYr-wNFnFY&amp;sig=jfmzwtLQs3UE6LObahOCK41yaZo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjx3Z7tu63QAhUq7IMKHVirBgEQ6AEIOTAH#v=onepage&amp;q=joseph%20samuel%20nathaniel%20tross&amp;f=false|title=Daddy Grace: A Celebrity Preacher and His House of Prayer|last=Dallam|first=Marie W.|date=2009-04-01|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=9780814720370|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 30, 1971, Tross died from a stroke at the age of 82.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4168">The '''matheme''' (from {{lang-el|μάθημα}} "lesson") is a concept introduced in the work of the 20th century [[France|French]] [[psychoanalyst]] [[Jacques Lacan]]. The term matheme 'occurred for the first time in the lecture Lacan delivered on November 4, 1971...Between 1972 and 1973 he gave several definitions of it, passing from the use of the singular to the use of the plural and back again'.&lt;ref&gt;Ėlisabeth Roudinesco, ''Jacques Lacan'' (1997) p. 360&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

'Lacan saw his "matheme" as something that would ensure the integral transmission of his teachings...proof against the "noise" or interference inherent in any process of communication'.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Macey]], "Introduction", Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (1994) p. xxxii&lt;/ref&gt;

They are [[formula]]e, designed as [[symbol]]ic [[knowledge representation|representations]] of his [[idea]]s and analyses. They were intended to introduce some degree of technical rigour in philosophical and psychological writing, replacing the often hard-to-understand verbal descriptions with formulae resembling those used in the [[hard science]]s, and as an easy way to hold, remember, and rehearse some of the core ideas of both [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] and Lacan. For example: "$&lt;&gt;a" is the matheme for fantasy in the Lacanian sense, in which "$"  refers to the subject as split into conscious and unconscious (hence the matheme is a barred S), "[[Objet petit a|a]]" stands for the object-cause of desire, and "&lt;&gt;" stands for the relationship between the two.

A more complex set of mathemes are Lacan's 'formulae of sexuation,' which he popularized in the March 13, 1973 session of his ''[[Seminars of Jacques Lacan|Seminar XX]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Seminar of Jacques Lacan: On Feminine Sexuality, The Limits of Love and Knowledge, Book XX, Encore, 1972–1973|last = Lacan|first = Jacques|publisher = W. W. Norton &amp; Company|year = 1998|isbn = 978-0393319163|location = New York|pages = 78–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Composed of two pairs of propositions written in a unique logico-mathematical shorthand inspired by [[Gottlob Frege]], one pair was dubbed 'masculine' and the other 'feminine.' These formulae Lacan originally constructed from [[Term logic|Aristotelian logic]] over the course of an entire year of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.swingtradesystems.com/lacan/lacan-and-aristotle.html|title = The Aristotelian Roots of Lacan's Formulas of Sexuation|last =|first =|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Matheme", for Lacan, was not simply the imitation of science by philosophy, but the ideal of a perfect means for the integral transmission of knowledge.  Natural language, with its constant "metonymic slide", fails here, where mathematics succeeds.  Contemporary philosopher [[Alain Badiou]] identifies "matheme" with the scientific procedure.

==Criticism==

Though sometimes disparaged as a case of "[[physics envy]]" or accused of introducing false rigor into a discipline that is more literary theory than hard science, there is also something of a sense of humor in Lacan's formulas: of one 'sigla which I have introduced in the form of an algorithm', Lacan himself has declared that 'it is created to allow for a hundred and one different readings, a multiplicity that is admissible as long as the spoken remains caught in its algebra'.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Écrits:  A Selection'' (London 1997) p. 313&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Serge Leclaire]], who is one of the most respected and distinguished of all French analysts, remarked in 1975, for example, that whilst the mathemes might have a certain pedagogic utility, they were basically no more than "graffiti"'.&lt;ref&gt;Macey, p. xxxii&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Missionary kids''' (or '''MKs''') are the children of [[missionary]] parents, and thus born and/or raised abroad (that is, on the "mission-field"). They form a subset of [[third culture kids]] (TCKs). The term is more specifically applied when these children return to their "home" or passport country (the country of their citizenship), and often experience various difficulties identifying with fellow citizens and integrating "back" into their "home" culture. The resulting feeling is described as "reverse [[culture shock]]".

There is some confusion between the terms MK and TCK. According to the definition developed by [[Ruth Hill Useem]], TCKs are people who have spent a significant part of their developmental years outside their parents' culture.&lt;ref&gt;''Third Culture Kids'', pp. 21–23&lt;/ref&gt; TCK is a broad term that encompasses all children who have grown up abroad (i.e. military kids, diplomats' kids, immigrants). Missionary kids are just one of the many categories of kids who qualify as TCKs. Therefore, while all MKs are TCKs, not all TCKs are MKs.

In the past MKs usually were thought of{{by whom|date=September 2014}} only as American or European, but there is {{as of | 2014 | lc = on}} a growing number of MKs from other countries, especially Protestant Christian MKs from [[South Korea]]&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.intervarsity.org/ism/article/346 Increase of non-Western missionaries] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060529025134/http://www.intervarsity.org/ism/article/346 |date=2006-05-29 }}&amp;nbsp;— by InterVarsity Christian Fellowship/USA. (accessed 2007-04-04).
&lt;/ref&gt; and from [[Latin America]]. Generally, this term applies to [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Christians]];{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}; however, it can be applied to any [[Religious denomination|denomination]] of a religion.

==Definition==

===Life overseas===
While MKs often identify more with the culture or country where they were raised (and this could be multiple cities, countries, or continents) than with where their parents were raised, they are not fully at home in any one culture. [[David C. Pollock]] and Van Reken attribute this feeling of displacement, or rootlessness, to a lack of emotional connection to their home culture (where they "should" feel connected).&lt;ref&gt;''Third Culture Kids'', pp. 123&lt;/ref&gt; Many MKs find it difficult to answer questions about where they are from or where home is as they may feel more of an emotional connection to their host culture than to their "home" culture. However, at the same time many MKs are completely aware that they can never fully fit into their host culture. This is especially obvious to MKs growing up in countries where they look different from the local population. Pollock and Van Reken developed the PolVan Cultural Identity Model to explain cultural identity in relationship to the surrounding culture. The Model names four categories into which a person can fall based on how they look and think compared to the culture around them:&lt;ref&gt;''Third Culture Kids'' pp. 54–56&lt;/ref&gt;
;Foreigner : look ''different'', think ''different''
;Adopted : look ''different'', think ''alike''
;Hidden Immigrant : look ''alike'', think ''different''
;Mirror : look ''alike'', think ''alike''

When MKs first transition to their new or "host" culture, they are in the foreigner category. As they continue the transition and begin to acclimate and feel at home in their host culture, MKs move into the adopted category, often to the point where MKs feel more at home in the host culture than in their passport culture. At this point, the host culture becomes the MK's home culture. Upon returning to their passport culture, MKs often find themselves in the hidden immigrant category. Because they look like their peers, their extended family remembers how they were prior to their international move and expect them to hold similar views and to act as a typical citizen of that passport country would act. However, as hidden immigrants, MKs look like their family and friends, but more often than not hold many differing views and opinions. Additionally, MKs may not be aware of many of the pop culture influences within their passport country, yet are aware of world and regional issues, which most citizens of their passport country are unaware of. This cultural disconnect can cause awkwardness when they return to their passport country.&lt;ref&gt;*Klemens &amp; Bikos, p. 721&lt;/ref&gt;

Children in the MKs' passport countries often find it difficult to relate to missionary children, and vice versa. While MKs may find the lives of their peers in their passport countries to be boring, sometimes creating challenging social situations, passport country kids may be intimidated by MKs' experience abroad. Cultural miscommunications are common and interesting. While MKs often find it difficult to relate to people from their home culture or target culture, they get along with other MKs very well, even those who are missionaries to (or from) a completely different country. It is the commonality of differences that draws MKs together.

MKs tend to be open-minded and tolerant of many diverse cultures. They often feel more at home in culturally rich environments and can be "homesick" for their foreign home. Their knowledge of a country and its culture typically exceeds language fluency. Upon returning to their passport country, MKs possess unique skills that can be helpful to academics and governments. Because of their international experience, they often have a much broader worldview than their peers. This broader worldview can also lead to mixed emotions about their passport country and its foreign policies.

===Return to passport country===
Children who immigrate to the United States have similar experience to MKs when it comes to learning a new culture and making cross-cultural transitions. But according to Pollack and Van Reken, what truly distinguishes MKs from children who immigrate to the United States or other countries is "the full expectation that after living for a significant period of their developmental years outside their passport culture, there will  come the day when TCKs make a permanent return to that country and culture."&lt;ref&gt;''Third Culture Kids'' p 225&lt;/ref&gt; MKs return to their passport country for many reasons, including the beginning of their college education, a shift in their parents' career, and even evacuation in more extreme cases. Extended family and friends's excitement at MKs' return does not usually carry over to the MK. The events surrounding an MK's return may be traumatic (such as in the event of an evacuation due to political unrest), but even under normal circumstances MKs' return to their country of citizenship is a cause of stress and grief. Anxiety and depressions are the two emotions most commonly associated with cross-cultural transitions, caused by a sense of vulnerability and loss of control.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Headley, et al. p 187&lt;/ref&gt;

To help MKs cope with the transition back to the United States, many colleges, particularly Christian colleges, have chapters of a student organization called "Mu Kappa International".&lt;ref&gt;[http://mukappa.org Mu Kappa International website]&lt;/ref&gt; Mu Kappa aims to help MKs and other TCKs with the transition to American culture and college life. Mu Kappa was founded in 1985 at [[Taylor University]], and has since spread to more than forty other American colleges and universities.

Another frequently used method of helping MKs cope with transitioning from their foreign home to their passport culture is through transition seminars. These seminars typically take place during the summer before an MK's freshman year of college and teach MKs the basics of everyday life in America, including putting gas in a car, opening a bank account, grocery shopping, and many other every day tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Headley, et al. p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, these seminar can help MKs understand how to deal with the grief of permanently transitioning back to their passport country in a healthy way, and how to manage the stress of a new environment and reverse culture shock.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14268">'''Model order reduction (MOR)''' is a technique for reducing the [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]] of [[mathematical model]]s in [[numerical simulation]]s. As such it is closely related to the concept of [[metamodeling]] with applications in all areas of [[mathematical model]]ling.

== Overview ==
Many modern [[mathematical model]]s of real-life processes pose challenges when used in [[numerical simulation]]s, due to complexity and large size (dimension). '''Model order reduction''' aims to lower the computational complexity of such problems, for example, in simulations of large-scale [[dynamical system]]s and [[control system]]s. By a reduction of the model's associated [[state space]] dimension or [[degrees of freedom]], an approximation to the original model is computed which is commonly referred to as a reduced order model.

Reduced order models are useful in settings where it is often unfeasible to perform [[numerical simulation]]s using the complete full order model.  This can be due to limitations in [[computational resource]]s or the requirements of the simulations setting, for instance [[Real-time computing|real-time simulation]] settings or many-query settings in which a large number of simulations needs to be performed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lassila |first1=Toni |last2=Manzoni |first2=Andrea |last3=Quarteroni |first3=Alfio |last4=Rozza |first4=Gianluigi |title=Model Order Reduction in Fluid Dynamics: Challenges and Perspectives |journal=Reduced Order Methods for Modeling and Computational Reduction |date=2014 |pages=235–273 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-02090-7_9 |url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-02090-7_9 |publisher=Springer International Publishing |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rozza|first=G.|last2=Huynh|first2=D.

== Methods ==

Model order reduction techniques used most commonly nowadays can be broadly classified into 4 classes:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Silva|first=João M.

The simplified physics approach can be described to be analogous to the traditional [[Mathematical model]]ling approach, in which a less complex description of a system is constructed based on assumptions and simplifications using physical insight or otherwise derived information. However, this approach is not often the topic of discussion in the context of model order reduction as it is a general method in science, engineering and mathematics and is not the subject of the current article.

The remaining listed methods fall into the category of projection-based reduction. Projection-based reduction relies on the  projection of either the model equations or the solution onto a basis of reduced dimensionality compared to the original solution space. Methods that also fall into this class but are perhaps less commonly found are:

== Applications ==

Model order reduction finds application within all fields involving mathematical modelling and many reviews exist for the topics of [[electronics]], [[Fluid mechanics|fluid-]] and [[structural mechanics]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=PGD /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://ebooks.cambridge.org/ref/id/CBO9780511622700|title=Turbulence, Coherent Structures, Dynamical Systems and Symmetry|last=Holmes|first=Philip|last2=Lumley|first2=John L.|last3=Berkooz|first3=Gal|date=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511622700|location=Cambridge|language=en|doi=10.1017/cbo9780511622700}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Fluid mechanics===

Current Problems in fluid mechanics involve large [[dynamical system]]s representing many effects on many different scales. [[Computational fluid dynamics]] studies often involve models solving the navier-stokes with a number of [[degrees of freedom]] in the order of magnitude upwards of &lt;math&gt;10^6&lt;/math&gt;. The first usage of model order reduction techniques dates back to the work of Lumley in 1967&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lumley |first1=J.L. |title=The Structure of Inhomogeneous Turbulence," In: A. M. Yaglom and V. I. Tatarski, Eds., Atmospheric Turbulence and Wave Propagation |date=1967 |publisher=Nauka |location=Moscow}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it was used to gain insight into the mechanisms and intensity of [[turbulence]] and [[Coherent turbulent structure|large coherent structure]]s present in fluid flow problems. Model order reduction also finds modern applications in [[Aeronautics]] to model the flow over the body of aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walton|first=S.|last2=Hassan|first2=O.|last3=Morgan|first3=K.|date=2013|title=Reduced order modelling for unsteady fluid flow using proper orthogonal decomposition and radial basis functions|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0307904X13002771|journal=Applied Mathematical Modelling|volume=37|issue=20-21|pages=8930–8945|doi=10.1016/j.apm.2013.04.025|issn=0307-904X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example can be found in Lieu et al&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lieu|first=T.|last2=Farhat|first2=C.|last3=Lesoinne|first3=M.|date=2006|title=Reduced-order fluid/structure modeling of a complete aircraft configuration|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0045782505005153|journal=Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering|volume=195|issue=41-43|pages=5730–5742|doi=10.1016/j.cma.2005.08.026|issn=0045-7825|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the full order model of an [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F16]] fighter-aircraft with over 2.1 million degrees of freedom, was reduced to a model of just 90 degrees of freedom.

&lt;!-- FAIR USE of NikeGrindLogo.png: low resolution copy of the grind program logo --&gt;

'''Nike Grind''' is part of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]'s Reuse-A-Shoe program that was started in 1993. The purpose of the program is to eliminate waste and close the loop on Nike's [[Product life-cycle management (marketing)#Product life cycle (PLC)|product lifecycle]] by collecting post-consumer, non-metal-containing athletic shoes of any brand. This includes Nike shoes that are returned due to material or workmanship defects.

==Recycling Process==
Once collected, the sneakers are ground up and separated into three distinct types of material: [[rubber]] from the outsole, foam from the midsole and fabric from the shoe's upper. Nike and its partners (Atlas Track &amp; Tennis, Playtop, Training Ground, Everlast and [[Rebound Ace]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Partners | work=Let Me Play | url= http://www.letmeplay.com/reuseashoe/grind/partners}}&lt;/ref&gt; take the granulated rubber and create [[soccer]], [[American football|football]], [[baseball]] fields, [[weight room]] flooring and running tracks. The first synthetic turf soccer field installed with Nike Grind rubber was Douglas Park in Chicago. That surface was donated by Nike and the U.S. Soccer Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csrwire.com/News/3151.html |title=Gold Medal Soccer Stars Mia Hamm &amp; Briana Scurry Help NikeGO and The U.S. Soccer Foundation Dedicate Chicago Soccer Field|work=Corporate Social Responsibility News|accessdate=2004-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Nike uses the granulated foam from the shoes for synthetic [[basketball]] courts, [[tennis]] courts and playground surfacing tiles. The granulated fabric from the shoe uppers becomes the padding under hardwood basketball floors.

These programs are located in [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Japan]], [[United Kingdom]], and [[United States]].

==Processing==

There are two Nike Grind processing plants, one located in the United States and the other in Belgium. The American facility uses a "slice and grind" technique, where each shoe is cut into three slices that contain the main materials. These slices are fed through grinders and purified to become the different types of material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Nike Partnership: A Perfect Fit For ECORE | work=ECORE International | url=http://www.ecoreintl.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Belgian facility grinds the shoes whole, and passes the resulting material through a series of separators for the same three groups of material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Nike Kicks Off Shoe Recycling Program | work=Sportswear International | url= http://www.sportswearnet.com/marketnews/pages/show.prl?params=&amp;id=530&amp;currPage=16&amp;ori=find }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8954">'''Normalization''' refers to social processes through which ideas and actions come to be seen as '[[normality (behavior)|normal]]' and become taken-for-granted or 'natural' in everyday life. In [[sociological theory]], normalization appears in two forms.
First, the concept of normalization is found in the work of [[Michel Foucault]], especially ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'', in the context of his account of disciplinary power.  As Foucault used the term, normalization involved the construction of an idealized norm of conduct &amp;ndash; for example, the way a proper soldier ideally should stand, march, present arms, and so on, as defined in minute detail &amp;ndash; and then rewarding or punishing individuals for respectively conforming to or deviating from this ideal.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel, 1990. ''The History of Sexuality, Volume I: An Introduction''. Robert Hurley, trans. New York: Vintage.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Mary Louise, 2004. "The Trouble with Normal: Postwar Youth and the Making of Heterosexuality". In Michelle Webber and Kate Bezanson, eds., ''Rethinking Society in the 21st Century: Critical Readings in Sociology''.  Canadian Scholars' Press Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; In Foucault's account, normalization was one of an ensemble of tactics for exerting the maximum [[social control]] with the minimum expenditure of force, which Foucault calls "disciplinary power".  Disciplinary power emerged over the course of the 19th century, came to be used extensively in military barracks, hospitals, asylums, schools, factories, offices, and so on, and hence became a crucial aspect of [[social structure]] in modern societies.

Second, [[normalization process theory]]&lt;ref&gt;May C, Mair FS, Finch T, MacFarlane A, Dowrick C, Treweek S, et al. Development of a theory of implementation and integration: Normalization Process Theory. Implementation Science. 2009;4 art 29&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Middle range theory (sociology)|middle-range theory]] used mainly in [[medical sociology]] and [[Science, technology and society|science and technology studies]] to provide a framework for understanding the social processes by which new ways of thinking, working and organizing become routinely incorporated in everyday work. Normalization process theory has its roots in empirical studies of [[technological innovation]] in healthcare, and especially in the evaluation of complex [[Health intervention|interventions]].

There are different behavioral attitudes humans accept as normal, such as grief for a loved one, avoiding danger, and not participating in [[cannibalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=What's Normal?: Reconciling Biology and Culture|last=Horwitz|first=Allan|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=197|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influences of behavior ==
The world is constantly changing and many things can change the situation an individual is in. Many [[Social influence|influences]] such as past experiences, environment, mental strength, physical strength, people, and the media can affect a person's behavior.  A person can decide to let certain things influence them. This will determine if the person is able to make a decision rationally or not. Some people fail to see the effects of their actions after letting influences affect their actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://behaviorandmotivation.com/2011/08/21/sources-of-influence-your-life/|title=9 Sources of Influence in Your Life|last=Milford|first=Scott|date=2011-08-21|website=Behavior and Motivation|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mood and emotions ===
People can greatly be affected by their [[Mood (psychology)|mood]]. One's judgement and [[emotional well-being]] is influenced by one's mood. A negative mood can cause someone to be unproductive and it will show in the person's performance. Positive moods can make a person be more active and productive.  If the person is well emotion-wise, they are full of energy and are able to stay positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Boundless|date=2016-05-26|title=How Emotion and Mood Influence Behavior|url=https://www.boundless.com/management/textbooks/boundless-management-textbook/organizational-behavior-5/drivers-of-behavior-44/how-emotion-and-mood-influence-behavior-233-7047/|work=Boundless}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Child development ===
Children are known for developing behaviors based on family, friends and media influences. A child may not know what they were doing is right or wrong. They must be able to learn from experiences if their actions are right or wrong. It is the parent's job to teach the child whether it is socially accepted or not. As the child develops from a child to a young adult, most of their influence will come from their friends. It will become harder for parents to tell how the child behaves as the child grows older.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oureverydaylife.com/normal-child-behavior-development-2386.html|title=Normal Child Behavior &amp; Development|work=Our Everyday Life|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Role models ===
Young adults and teenagers are heavily affected by looking up to [[role model]]s. Young adults are influenced to act, talk, dress and behave similarly to their role models. This can either be a positive or negative for the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reference.com/science/factors-affect-human-behavior-3512986d01e403d4#|title=What are the factors that affect human behavior?|work=Reference|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Looking up to a role model can have positive effects, as may influence young adults to strive for success and it brings the best out of the person to do well. Positive role models are people able to overcome obstacles, inspire others, and achievements of success. However, negative role models may model bad behaviors like bullying, drug usage, and cheating, which may lead to failure rather than success. Young adults may learn to avoid problems rather than solve them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rootsofaction.com/role-models-youth-strategies-success/|title=How Role Models Influence Youth Strategies for Success|date=2014-01-14|newspaper=Roots of Action|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problems with blindly copying a role model is that people start to lose a sense of identity.

== Types of normal behavior ==

=== Grief ===
[[Grief]] is the deep sorrow usually caused by someone's death. It has now become a normal human reaction to a loss of a loved one. It is not uncommon for someone to be in sadness. Many have to deal with [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] with grief.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.griefrecoverymethod.com/blog/2013/06/best-grief-definition-you-will-find|title=The Best Grief Definition You Will Find|last=Friedman|first=Russell|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Body markings ===
Body markings such as [[tattoo]]s and [[piercing]]s were once considered unaccepted, many people today use body markings as a form of expression.

=== Homosexuality ===
During the 1900s [[homosexuality]] was not accepted as a normal behavior and people attracted to the same gender were considered different and were heavily discriminated against. Over the years, it has now been accepted in places such as the United States, Canada and other places around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.norc.org/NewsEventsPublications/PressReleases/Pages/american-acceptance-of-homosexuality-gss-report.aspx|title=Americans Move Dramatically Toward Acceptance of Homosexuality {{!}} NORC.org|website=www.norc.org|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Laughter ===
Laughter signals acceptance and trust in a group. This is often why laughter is contagious, and explains why people are unlikely to laugh alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://listverse.com/2013/07/11/10-human-actions-with-biological-explanations-2/|title=10 Common Human Behaviors Explained With Science|date=2013-07-11|website=Listverse|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of abnormal behavior ==
[[Abnormal behavior]] is broken up to two types: atypical and maladaptive. Atypical behavior is not necessarily harmful, but maladaptive behavior could potentially be harmful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite work|url=https://www.reference.com/world-view/different-types-abnormal-behaviour-778d1d5311f4dd6f#|title=What are the different types of abnormal behaviour?|work=Reference|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oscar Eugene Learnard''' (November 14, 1832 &amp;ndash; November 6, 1911) was a campaigner for [[Free-Stater (Kansas)|Free State Kansas]], a Republican organizer, a colonel in the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]], a railroad official, a two-term [[Kansas Senate|Kansas State Senator]], and a school administrator.&lt;ref name=papers&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kshs.org/index.php?url=dart/units/view/40415|title=Oscar E. Learnard papers - State Archives - Kansas Historical Society|website=www.kshs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Learnard was born in [[Fairfax, Vermont]] on November 14, 1832, the son of Stephen Tracy and Polly (Dee) Learnard, and was educated at [[Bakersfield Academy]] before entering [[Norwich University]] in 1852.&lt;ref name="Ellis1911"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Arba Ellis|title=Norwich University, 1819-1911|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=148pAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA559|year=1911|publisher=Capital city Press|page=559}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later studied at [[Albany Law School]], and was admitted to the bar in 1855.&lt;ref name="Ellis1911" /&gt; He moved to Ohio in the summer of 1855. During the winter of 1855–1856, he moved to [[Lawrence, Kansas]] and joined the effort to have Kansas admitted as a free state.&lt;ref name=papers /&gt;&lt;ref name="Armitage2010" /&gt;

==Career and military service==
In 1857, Learnard helped set out the town of [[Burlington, Kansas]] and built the first mill, the first business building, and a structure used as a school and church.&lt;ref name=papers/&gt; He served as a member of the council of the first free state legislature from 1857 to 1859. Learnard was judge of the 5th Judicial Circuit after the state government was established.&lt;ref name=papers /&gt; He supported the [[Free-Stater (Kansas)|Free State Movemeent]], opposing slavery,&lt;ref name="Ellis1911"/&gt; and was a local organizer for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Standard History of Kansas and Kansans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HHJHAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1248|year=1919|publisher=Lewis Publishing Company|page=1248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Learnard resigned his judgeship at the beginning of the Civil War. He enrolled as a lieutenant colonel in the [[1st Regiment Kansas Volunteer Infantry|1st Kansas regiment]] and served until he resigned his commission in 1863. He participated in [[Price's Raid]] of Kansas, the [[Battle of Little Blue River]], and at [[Westport, Missouri]] in 1864.&lt;ref name=papers/&gt;

After the war, he served in the state senate from 1868 to 1871.&lt;ref name="Ellis1911"/&gt; He worked for the [[Kansas City, Memphis and Birmingham Railroad|Kansas City, Fort Scott &amp; Memphis Railroad Company]] as a tax commissioner and special attorney for a quarter of a century.&lt;ref name=papers /&gt; Learnard became proprietor of the local daily and weekly newspaper, the ''Lawrence Journal'', which he ran beginning in 1884.&lt;ref name=papers /&gt;&lt;ref name="Armitage2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KSHS newspapers"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kansas State Historical Society|title=List by Counties of Newspapers and Periodicals Published in Kansas, March 1q, 1884|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wo1TAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA9|year=1887|publisher=Kansas Publishing|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Learnard was said to have operated the paper until it was owned by the Journal company, in or before&lt;ref name=papers /&gt; 1911.&lt;ref name="Armitage2010"/&gt; William Elsey Connelley states in the ''History of Kansas Newspapers'' that the  ''Lawrence Journal'' weekly edition operated from 1886 until 1909 and the daily edition was published until 1911, when it was consolidated with other papers into the ''Lawrence Daily Journal-World''.&lt;ref name="Connelley"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Elsey Connelley|title=History of Kansas newspapers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ijmNBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA180|date=December 7, 2017|publisher=William Elsey Connelley|pages=180, 181|id=GGKEY:HFSDUARLER4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Learnard was the editor of the paper, which was owned by the Lawrence Journal Company.&lt;ref name="KSHS newspapers" /&gt;}} Land that he had owned was used  in 1889 to establish a [[American Indian boarding schools|native American school]] called the Haskill Institute, where he was superintendent for a year.&lt;ref name=papers /&gt;&lt;ref name="Armitage2010"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8054">'''Peace Brigades International''' (PBI) is a [[non-governmental organization]] founded in 1981 which "protects [[human rights]] and promotes non-violent transformation of conflicts". It primarily does this by sending international volunteers to areas of conflict, who then provide protective, non-violent accompaniment to members of human rights organizations, unions, peasant groups and others that are threatened by political violence. PBI also facilitates other peace-building initiatives within conflict countries. They are a “nonpartisan” organization that does not interfere with the affairs of those they accompany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peacebrigades.org/fileadmin/user_files/international/files/annual_reviews/Annual_Review_2014_-_English_.pdf Peace Brigades International: Annual Review 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, in 2015, PBI has field projects in [[Colombia]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[Indonesia]], [[Kenya]], [[Mexico]] and [[Nepal]].

==History==
Inspired by the work of [[Shanti Sena]] in India, Peace Brigades International was founded in 1981 by a group of nonviolence activists, including [[Narayan Desai]], [[George Willoughby (activist)|George Willoughby]], [[Charles Coates Walker|Charles Walker]], [[Raymond Magee]], [[Jamie Diaz]] and [[Murray Thomson]]. In 1983, during the [[Nicaraguan Revolution|Contra war]], PBI sent a short-term peace team to [[Jalapa, Nueva Segovia|Jalapa]], [[Nicaragua]] positioning themselves between warring factions. This project was continued and expanded by [[Witness for Peace]]. The first long term PBI project was started that same year in [[Guatemala]] (1983–1999, re-initiated in 2003), followed by [[El Salvador]] (1987–1992), [[Sri Lanka]] (1989–1998), North America (1992–1999, in Canada and the USA), [[Colombia]] (since 1994), the Balkans (1994–2001, joint with other organizations), [[Haiti]] (1995–2000), [[Mexico]] (since 1998), [[Indonesia]] (1999–2011, and since 2015), [[Nepal]] (2005-2014), [[Kenya]] (since 2013) and [[Honduras]] (since 2013).&lt;ref name="PBI-History"&gt;{{cite web|title=PBI's History|url=http://www.peacebrigades.org/about-pbi/pbi-history/?L=3 |website=Peace Brigades International|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, PBI volunteers escorted [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner [[Rigoberta Menchú]] on her first visit back to Guatemala from exile.
Other individuals that PBI has protected include [[Amílcar Méndez Urízar|Amílcar Méndez]], [[Nineth Montenegro]] and [[Frank LaRue]] in Guatemala;&lt;ref&gt;Mahony, L. and Eguren, L.E., 1997. Unarmed Bodyguards: International Accompaniment for the Protection of Human Rights, West Hartford, Conn: Kumarian Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mario Calixto]] and [[Claudia Julieta Duque]] in Colombia.

The international protective accompaniment work that PBI developed and pioneered, has inspired similar work by many other organizations, including [[Witness for Peace]], the [[Christian Peacemaker Teams]], the [[Muslim Peacemaker Teams]], [[Nonviolent Peaceforce]], [[Protection International]], the [[International Peace Observers Network]] and the [[Meta Peace Team]].

==Organization==
PBI is a team-based organization that uses [[consensus decision making]]. It is non-hierarchical in structure. There are three different aspects to the overall PBI structure, which are the Country Groups, the Field Projects, and the International Level (which consists of the PBI General Assembly, the International Council (IC), and the International Operations Council (IOC)). An international meeting is held every three years, that is attended by members from across the organization, to analyze and modify the direction of each country's program.

==Volunteers==
PBI attracts volunteers from diverse backgrounds for its work in the field projects. Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bangladesh, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Holland, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States — among many other countries — have all been represented among PBI's volunteer pool. Potential volunteers must be strongly committed to non-violence, and all applicants must attend in-depth training where they learn the philosophy of non-violence, non-violent strategies, and team dynamics. All volunteers must be fluent in Spanish for the Mexican, Guatemalan and Colombian projects, and all volunteers for the Nepalese program must be fluent in English and have a basic understanding of Nepali. An applicant may not be a citizen of the country they desire to work in, and must be able to make a minimum commitment of one year.

Apart from getting involved in the field projects, there is also the possibility for individuals to be able to volunteer in PBI’s country groups.

== Awards ==
Peace Brigades International has received a number of awards for its work, including 
the [[Memorial Per la Pau "Josep Vidal I Llecha"]] (1989),
the [[Friedrich Siegmund-Schultze | Friedrich Siegmund-Schultze Förderpreis]] (1995, PBI-Germany),
the [[Memorial de la Paz y la Solidaridad Entre los Pueblos]] (1995),
the [[Pfeffer Peace Prize|International Pfeffer Peace Prize]] (1996)
the [[Aachener International Peace Prize]] (1999),
the [[Medalla Comemorativa de la Paz]] (1999),
the [[Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders]] (2001, Colombia project),
and the [[Jaime Brunet Prize]] (2011).&lt;ref name="PBI-History"/&gt;

There are a number of '''formats''' used in various levels of competition in [[sport]]s and [[game]]s to determine an overall champion. Some of the most common are the ''single elimination'', the ''best-of-'' series, the ''total points series'' more commonly known as ''on aggregate'', and the ''[[round-robin tournament]]''.

==Single elimination==
{{Main article|Single-elimination tournament}}
{{see also|Shaughnessy playoff system}}
A '''[[Single-elimination tournament|Single elimination]]''' ("knockout") playoff pits the participants in one-game matches, with the loser being dropped from the competition. Single elimination tournaments are much more common in individual sports like [[tennis]]. In most tennis tournaments, the players are [[Seed (sports)|seeded]] against each other, and the winner of each match continues to the next round, all the way to the final.

Of the [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|big four American sports leagues]], only the [[National Football League]] uses this system for all rounds of its postseason. This works for the NFL because its regular seasons are much shorter (16 games) than those in the other sports (from 82 to 162 games), and the difference in quality between teams is believed to be more quickly discernible. The rigors of individual games, held only once per week, also preclude the possibility of longer playoff series. Since the 1990 season six teams are seeded from each conference, with the top two getting a first-round "bye". The remaining teams pair off, with the higher-seeded team hosting. The winners of those games then play the higher-seeded teams that received byes in elimination playoffs, and then the winners of those matches face each in another in elimination playoffs to determine who will represent each conference in the [[Super Bowl]]. The winner of that game wins the championship.

Until the late 1960s, the only regular post-season fixtures in U.S. professional football were the league Championship Games. Divisional playoffs were only held in the event of a tie in the division standings. Divisional playoffs as a regularly scheduled event were not introduced in the NFL and rival [[American Football League]] until the seasons immediately preceding the [[AFL-NFL merger]] in 1970.

Like the NFL, the [[Canadian Football League]] also uses one game playoffs, and has used them almost exclusively since the 1973 season. In the CFL, six teams qualify for the playoffs, divided into two divisional brackets of three teams each. The second place teams in each division host the Division Semi-Final, while the division winners each receive a bye to the Division Final. The Division Final winners play in the [[Grey Cup]]. Unlike the NFL, divisional playoffs have been a regular fixture in professional Canadian football since the 1930s. The main rationale for their introduction was that Canadian football clubs were (and, to a considerable extent, still are) more heavily dependent on a steady stream of gate receipts compared to their NFL counterparts, largely due to their playing in relatively small markets and smaller stadiums compared to NFL teams. A more inclusive playoff structure was therefore seen as necessary to ensure as many games as possible up to the end of the season were "meaningful" so as to encourage fans to attend games.

The only exception to a strict single-elimination format since the early 1970s was in 1986 when the league amended its playoff format to allow a fourth place team in one division to qualify in place of a third place team with a worse record. That year, when only two [[Canadian Football League East Division|East Division]] teams qualified compared to four [[Canadian Football League West Division|Western]] teams, the rules mandated the two Eastern teams play a two-game total points series over two weekends while the four Western teams played a single elimination playoff over the same time frame. The CFL eventually amended this format into the present "crossover rule" so as to allow a qualifying fourth place team to compete as the third place team in the other divisional bracket, thereby preserving the first place byes. Prior to 1973, the CFL used two game and three game playoffs in its divisional rounds, as discussed below.

Beginning in 2012, [[Major League Baseball]] expanded its playoffs from 8 teams to 10, adding a second wild card in each league. The wild card teams now play a one-game playoff to determine which club advances to the best-of-five division series to meet the team with the best overall record in that particular league.

In both the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|men's]] and [[NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship|women's]] [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[college basketball]] tournaments, 64 teams are seeded into four brackets of 16 teams each. (From 2011, the men's tournament will feature a "First Four", with the four lowest-ranked conference champions and the four lowest-seeded at-large teams playing single games to enter the 64-team draw.) The #1 team plays the #16 team in each bracket, the #2 plays the #15, and so on. Theoretically, if a higher-ranked team always beats a lower-ranked team, the second game will be arranged #1 vs. #8, #2 vs. #7, etc.; the third will be arranged #1 vs. #4, #2 vs. #3; the fourth will be arranged #1 vs. #2. If for instance #9 beats #8 in the first game, the #9 will simply take the theoretical spot of #8 and play #1. Winners advance through each round, changing cities after every two rounds. The [[Final Four]] teams, one from each bracket, play each other in the last weekend, with the winner of the final two being awarded the championship.

National [[association football]] competitions usually don't have playoffs, but when employed, use single-elimination formats to determine finalists and winners. The [[Major League Soccer]] [[MLS Cup Playoffs|playoffs]] use such a format; since [[2012 Major League Soccer season|2012]], the first round in each conference and the championship final, known as the [[MLS Cup]], are conducted as single games, while the conference semifinals and conference finals are two-legged matches determined on total goals scored. [[Liga MX]] in [[Mexico]], which splits its season into [[Apertura and Clausura|two phases]], uses playoffs known as the ''Liguilla'' to determine the champions of each phase. Unlike the MLS system, all ''Liguilla'' matches are two-legged ties. [[Australia]]'s [[A-League]] introduced a six-team knockout playoff, known locally as a "finals series", in the [[2012–13 A-League|2012–13 season]]. Unlike the MLS playoffs or Liga MX ''Liguilla'', the A-League finals series uses one-off matches throughout, culminating in the [[A-League Grand Final]]. This format is a departure from norms in football codes in Australia; previously, the A-League used a [[#Top six system|hybrid elimination system]] that allowed top teams in the regular season to lose one finals match but still win the tournament. The [[FIFA World Cup]] tournament also uses knockout rounds after a group stage of 32 teams divided into 8 groups of 4 determines who advances to them.

Some knockout tournaments may also include a [[third place playoff]], a single match to decide which competitor or team will be credited with finishing third and fourth place. The teams that compete in such third place games are usually the two losing semifinalists in a particular tournament. Although these semifinalists are still in effect "eliminated" from contending for the championship, they either may be competing for a [[bronze medal]] like some tournaments in the [[Olympic Games]] or basically just to salvage some pride in a consolation match, like in the [[FIFA World Cup]] or [[Rugby World Cup]].

When a playoff of this type involves the top four teams, it is sometimes known as the [[Shaughnessy playoff system]], after [[Frank Shaughnessy]], who first developed it for the [[International League]] of [[Minor League Baseball|minor league baseball]]. Variations of the Shaughnessy system also exist, such as in the promotion playoffs held by [[League 1 (rugby league)|League 1]] of British rugby league. The League 1 playoff does not involve the top four teams; the team that tops the table after the Super 8s phase (which follows a single round-robin phase involving all league teams) is crowned champion and  receives automatic promotion to the second-tier [[Championship (rugby league)|Championship]], while the next four teams contest a knockout playoff for the second promotion place. A nearly identical format, with the only difference being that the knockout stage followed a full home-and-away league season, was used by the second level of France's rugby union system, [[Rugby Pro D2|Pro D2]], through the 2016–17 season. Since then, Pro D2 uses a six-team playoff with the winner earning automatic promotion to the [[Top 14]] and the runner-up entering a playoff with the 13th-place team in Top 14 for the final place in the next season's Top 14.

==Stepladder==
The "stepladder", named so as the bracket resembles a [[step ladder]] is a variation of the single-elimination tournament; instead of, in a 16-team tournament, the #1 seed facing the #16 seed in the first round, the bracket is constructed as to give the higher seeded teams [[bye (sports)|bye]]s, where the #1 seed has bye up to the third round, playing the winner of game between the #8 seed the #9 vs. #16 winner. This setup is seldom used best-of-''x'' series as this may yield long waiting times for the teams afforded the bye, while the teams that played in the earlier rounds would be spent when they reach the latter rounds.

The  [[Big East Men's Basketball Tournament]] used this format in a 16-team, 5-round format. The [[PBA Tour]] uses the 4-player, 3-round format (sometimes a 5-player, 4 round format). The [[UAAP Basketball Championship|University Athletic Association of the Philippines Basketball Championship]] uses this format (4-teams, 3-rounds) only if there's an undefeated team, otherwise it uses a single-elimination format.

While [[Nippon Professional Baseball]]'s [[Climax Series]] has been called a "stepladder" playoff with only three participating teams (2 rounds), it functions mostly as a single-elimination tournament with 3 teams, and is structurally the same with a 6-team, 3-round playoff.  The [[KBO League]]'s [[KBO Korean Series|Korean Series]], on the other hand, is considered a stepladder system - the teams that finish third and fourth place play a best-of-3 series (with the third place team automatically a 1-0 series lead), whose winner then plays the second-place team in a best-of-5, whose winner in turn plays the first-place team in a best-of-7 for the title.

[[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]] has their playoffs done this way: the 5-8 and 6-7 seeds play in the first round. The top two seeds get double byes and the next two seeds 1st-round byes. The first two rounds are single-elimination; all others are best-of-5.

[[League of Legends]] competition often uses the stepladder system. The [[League of Legends Pro League]] uses a double stepladder for its playoffs, giving the first seeds of the Western and Eastern Conferences a bye to the semifinals, the second seeds a bye to the quarterfinals, and the third seeds a one-game advantage against the fourth seeds in the first round. The [[League of Legends Pro League]], [[League of Legends Championship Series]], and [[League of Legends Master Series]] also use a stepladder bracket (in this case referred to as "The Gauntlet") to determine each league's third representative at the [[League of Legends World Championship]].

==Double elimination==
{{Main article|Double-elimination tournament}}
A ''[[double elimination]]'' format is used in most NCAA and high school [[baseball]] and [[softball]] tournaments in the United States. Starting in [[2010 Little League World Series|2010]], the [[Little League World Series]] in baseball also adopted this format. Teams are eliminated from contention after incurring two losses in each round of play.

The format changes depending on the number of teams per bracket, but most major [[college baseball|collegiate baseball]] conferences with the format send only the top eight teams, or a mix of top teams plus the winners of a single elimination qualifier tournament, to their conference tournament.

The NCAA baseball and softball tournaments have used the format since its inception for regional and [[College World Series]] play.

In the current NCAA tournament format for four teams, the #1 seed plays the #4 seed ("Game 1"), and the #2 seed plays the #3 seed ("Game 2") on the first day of regional tournaments, and the first and second days of the College World Series (where the second bracket games are known as "Game 3" and "Game 4", respectively).

On the second day or series (third and fourth days at the College World Series), the losers play in the morning to determine who is eliminated ("Game 3" in regional, "Games 5" and "Game 7" in College World Series play), and who advances to the third game of the day. The winners ("Game 4" in regional, "Game 6" and "Game 8" in College World Series) play to determine who advances to the final on the third day.

In NCAA regional games, the loser of this game plays the winner of the morning game that evening ("Game 5") to determine who plays in the final.

In College World Series play, because the bracket teams play on alternating days, these games ("Game 9" and "Game 10") are played on the fifth day.

In NCAA regional games, the third day will feature the regional championship ("Game 6"). If the winner of Game 4 defeats the winner of Game 5, the winner advances to the Super Regional. Until the 2005 tournament, if the winner of Game 5 defeats the winner of Game 4, the two teams would meet again in Game 7 thirty minutes later to determine which team advances to the Super Regional.

However, with a concern that some teams were playing four games in two days, the NCAA made a rule change in 2005 to equalize the disadvantage of the winner of Game 5 by stating should the winner of Game 5 win Game 6, Game 7 would be played on a fourth day.

In the College World Series, on the sixth day, the winner of Game 9 plays the winner of Game 7 ("Game 11"), and the winner of Game 10 plays the winner of Game 8 ("Game 12"). If the winner in Game 7 wins Game 11, and/or the winner of Game 8 wins Game 12, such winners advance to the best-of-three final. If the winner of Game 9 defeats the winner of Game 7, and/or the winner of Game 10 defeats the winner of Game 8 the two teams would play again on the seventh day in Games 13 and 14, respectively, if they are needed, to determine who advances to the final.

Starting with the 2010 edition, the Little League World Series adopted a new format that involves four double-elimination brackets. In 2010, the U.S. and International divisions were split into two four-team pools, with each pool conducting a double-elimination tournament to determine its winner. After the end of double-elimination play, the U.S. pool winners play one another in single games, as do the International pool winners, with the losers playing a third-place game and the winners playing a championship game. This was altered in 2011 so that all eight US team and all eight international teams played in one large bracket each, with each bracket's winner playing each other for the championship and each bracket's runner-up playing each other for third-place.  In another new feature, all teams are guaranteed at least three games; the first team eliminated from each pool plays a "crossover game" that matches an eliminated U.S. team with an eliminated International team.

Many [[esports]], most notably [[Counter-Strike]] and [[StarCraft]], use a double-elimination bracket to determine the top two teams in a four team group. In this usage, the format is referred to as "GSL", after the [[Global StarCraft II League]]. [[Dota 2]] competitions often use a GSL or round robin group stage to seed teams into a double-elimination bracket. [[Super Smash Bros.]] tournaments, as well as other [[fighting game]] competitions, typically use an open double-elimination bracket with no preceding group stage or qualifiers.

==Hybrid elimination systems==
{{further|McIntyre System}}
Some playoff systems combine the features of single- and double-elimination tournaments. In these systems, one or more higher-ranked teams have an opportunity to skip a round of the playoffs by winning their first match. Even if they lose that match, they can still advance to the championship final. Lower-ranked teams receive no such break.

These are variations of systems developed by Australian lawyer [[Kenneth McIntyre|Ken McIntyre]] for the Victorian Football League (VFL), the historic predecessor to today's [[Australian Football League]] (AFL), starting in 1931.

===Page–McIntyre system===
{{main article|Page playoff system}}
This system, also bearing the name of its promoter Percy Page, is a four-team playoff first developed for [[Australian rules football]]. It has been used in many competitions in that sport and in [[rugby league]], but is most prominent in [[softball]] and [[curling]] (which use the name "Page playoff system"). The [[Indian Premier League]] in [[Twenty20]] [[cricket]] uses this system as well.

In this system, the first round (sometimes called the "quarterfinals") matches #1 against #2 and #3 against #4. The winner of the 1–2 match advances directly to the final. The next round, known as the semifinal, pits the loser of the 1–2 match against the winner of the 3–4 match.

====Example====
As used in the [[2006 Tim Hortons Brier]], Canada's national men's curling championship:

{{PagePlayoffBracket | RD1=

| RD3-score1=7
| RD3-seed2=2
| RD3-team2='''{{flag|Quebec|size=30px}}'''
| RD3-score2='''8'''
}}

===Top five system===
{{main article|Top five play-offs}}
McIntyre's first modification was an expansion to five teams. In this format, the first round matches #2 v #3 and #4 v #5, with the #1 seed receiving a bye into the second round. The 4–5 match is played to eliminate one team, while the 2–3 match is played to determine which match they will play in the second round.

In the second round, the loser of the 2–3 match plays the winner of the 4–5 match, while the winner of the 2–3 match plays the #1 seed. From this point forward, the tournament is identical to the Page playoff system.

While no major league uses this system today, it has been used in the past by the VFL and several rugby league competitions, most notably the short-lived [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] of Australia and the present-day European [[Super League]]. Many lower-level leagues in both Australian rules and rugby league still use the system.

====Example====
As used in the [[2006 Bartercard Cup]], the championship of New Zealand rugby league:

===Top six system===
{{main article|Top six play-offs}}
{{see also|McIntyre System#First McIntyre final six system|McIntyre System#Second McIntyre final six system|l1=First McIntyre final six system|l2=Second McIntyre final six system}}
McIntyre next developed two slightly different systems for six-team playoffs. In each system, the #1 and #2 seeds played to determine the specific semifinal match in which they would compete, while the other four teams played knockout matches in the first week to eliminate two teams and determine the other two semifinal participants. The semifinal in which the winner of the 1–2 match competes directly determines one place in the championship final (often called a "Grand Final", especially in Australia). The other semifinal is an elimination match, with the winner advancing into a "Preliminary Final" to determine the other Grand Final place.

This system was further tweaked into the top-six system used by the [[Championship (rugby league)|Championship]] and [[League 1 (rugby league)|League 1]] of European rugby league until being abandoned from the 2015 season forward. A slightly modified version of this system was used in the [[A-League]] of Australian soccer starting in [[2009–10 A-League|2010]] before a pure knockout format was adopted beginning in [[2012–13 A-League|2013]].

In the modern top-six system, the first round consists of knockout matches involving #3 vs #6 and #4 vs #5, with the #1 and #2 teams receiving a bye into the next round. After those matches, the format is identical to the Page playoff system.

The A-League's former system had the top two teams participating in a two-legged match instead of the single-elimination matches that the other four teams faced. It did not affect the teams' eventual playoff paths.

===Top eight system===
{{main article|McIntyre Final Eight System|AFL final eight system|Super League play-offs}}
McIntyre's final development expanded the concept to an eight-team playoff. This expansion meant that no team received a "second chance" after the first week of the playoffs.

====McIntyre Final Eight====
The original McIntyre Final Eight system is notable in that it uses the regular-season league table to eliminate two teams in the first week of the playoffs. The procedure is:

;Week 1
* 1st Qualifying Final: 4th seed vs 5th seed
* 2nd Qualifying Final: 3rd seed vs 6th seed
* 3rd Qualifying Final: 2nd seed vs 7th seed
* 4th Qualifying Final: 1st seed vs 8th seed

The fates of the teams in this round depend on whether they won or lost their Qualifying Final, and on their regular-season position. The four winners and the two losers that finished highest on the regular-season table advance to later rounds, with the two other losers eliminated.

;Week 2
* 1st Semi-final:&lt;ref name="semi-final"&gt;Under finals systems traditionally used in Australian sport, the term "semi-final" has different usage from that in a traditional knockout tournament. The two games played immediately before the Grand Final, which would be known as semi-finals in a knockout tournament, are called "preliminary finals". The semi-finals refer to the two games preceding the preliminary finals. This terminology was used by the AFL under the McIntyre System from 1931 until 1993, and continues to this day in the AFL and most other Australian leagues. The main exception is the A-League, which adopted a pure knockout finals series in 2013 and uses "semi-final" for the games immediately preceding its Grand Final.&lt;/ref&gt; 4th highest-ranked winner vs 2nd highest-ranked loser
* 2nd Semi-final: 3rd highest-ranked winner vs 1st highest-ranked loser

The two losing teams are eliminated, and the two winning teams progress to Week 3.

;Week 3
* 1st Preliminary Final: Highest-seeded Qualifying Final winner vs winner of 1st Semi-final
* 2nd Preliminary Final: Second-highest-seeded Qualifying Final winner vs winner of 2nd Semi-final

The two losing teams are eliminated, and the two winning teams progress to the Grand Final.

;Week 4
* Grand Final: winner of 1st Preliminary Final vs winner of 2nd Preliminary Final

Due to perceived weaknesses of this system, the AFL adopted a modified top-eight playoff in [[2000 AFL season|2000]]. The [[National Rugby League]] (NRL), Australia's top rugby league competition (also with [[New Zealand Warriors|a team]] in New Zealand), used this system from 1999 through 2011, after which it changed to the AFL system.

====AFL system====
The current AFL finals system breaks up the eight participants into four groups of two teams, ranked by their league position after regular-season play. Each group receives an advantage over the teams directly below it on the league table. These advantages are the so-called "double-chance", where a loss in the first week will not eliminate a team from the finals, and home ground finals. Note, however, that "home" designations are often irrelevant if a finals match involves two teams from the same state. 
The finals format operates as follows:
;Week 1
* 1st Qualifying Final: 1st seed hosts 4th seed
* 2nd Qualifying Final: 2nd seed hosts 3rd seed
* 1st Elimination Final: 5th seed hosts 8th seed
* 2nd Elimination Final: 6th seed hosts 7th seed

The top four teams play the two Qualifying Finals.  The winners get a bye through to Week 3 of the tournament to play home Preliminary Finals, while the losers play home Semi-Finals in Week 2.  The bottom four teams play the two Elimination Finals, where the winners advance to Week 2 away games and the losers' seasons are over.

;Week 2
* 1st Semi-final:&lt;ref name="semi-final"/&gt; Loser of 1st QF hosts winner of 1st EF
* 2nd Semi-final: Loser of 2nd QF hosts winner of 2nd EF

;Week 3
* 1st Preliminary Final:&lt;ref name="semi-final"/&gt; Winner of 1st QF hosts winner of 2nd SF
* 2nd Preliminary Final: Winner of 2nd QF hosts winner of 1st SF

;Week 4
* [[AFL Grand Final]]: Winners of the two Preliminary Finals meet at the MCG.

The specific advantages gained by finishing in higher positions on the league table are as follows:

'''First and second''' — These teams receive the double-chance, and play their first two finals matches at home—their Qualifying Final, and then either a Semi-final (should they lose the QF) or Preliminary Final (should they win the QF). They must win two finals matches to reach the Grand Final.

'''Third and fourth''' — Like the top two teams, they receive the double-chance, and must win two finals matches to reach the Grand Final. However, they only get to play one finals match at home—a Semi-final if they lose their QF, or Preliminary Final if they win the QF.

'''Fifth and sixth''' — These teams do not receive a double-chance. They must win three matches to reach the Grand Final—an Elimination Final, Semi-final, and Preliminary Final. They do get to host their EF.

'''Seventh and eighth''' — These teams receive neither a double-chance nor a home finals match, and must also win three finals matches to reach the Grand Final.

The [[National Rugby League]] and [[Victorian Football League]] operate the same finals system.

====Super League system====
From [[Super League XIV|2009]] through to [[Super League XIX|2014]], the Super League used a top-eight playoff system. The expansion to an eight-team bracket coincided with the league's expansion from 12 to 14 teams. Like the AFL system, the Super League system eliminated two teams in each week leading up to the Grand Final. However, it had a number of differences from the AFL system, most notably the feature known as "Club Call" (explained below).&lt;ref name=BBC1&gt;{{cite web | title = Super League play-offs overhauled| publisher = BBC | date = 2008-11-30 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_league/7757687.stm | accessdate = 2012-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in the AFL, the participants were ranked by league position in the regular season. Unlike in the AFL, the team receiving home advantage in each match leading up to the Grand Final was guaranteed the right to host the match at a ground of its choosing, either its regular home stadium or (rarely) a larger nearby alternative.

;Week 1
* Qualifying Play-Offs:
** 1st vs 4th
** 2nd vs 3rd
The winners of these matches advanced directly to Week 3, in which they received home advantage. The higher-seeded winner received Club Call immediately after Week 2. The losers had another chance in Week 2, when they were at home to the winners of the Week 1 Elimination Play-Offs.
* Elimination Play-Offs
** 5th v 8th
** 6th v 7th
The winners of these matches advanced to Week 2, with the losers being eliminated.

;Week 2
* Preliminary Semi-Final 1: Highest-seeded QPO loser (1, 2, or 3) vs lowest-seeded EPO winner (6, 7, or 8)
* Preliminary Semi-Final 2: Lowest-seeded QPO loser (2, 3, or 4) vs highest-seeded EPO winner (5, 6, or 7)
The winners of these matches advanced to Week 3 and Club Call, with the losers being eliminated.

;Club Call
Club Call, a unique feature of the Super League system, took place on the second weekend of the playoffs, shortly after the winners of the two PSFs were known. The highest-seeded winning club from Week 1 was required to choose which of the two PSF winners they would play in Week 3.

;Week 3
* Qualifying Semi-Final 1: Highest-seeded QPO Winner v Club Call selected PSF winner
* Qualifying Semi-Final 2: Second-seeded QPO Winner v Club Call non-selected PSF winner
The winners advanced to the Grand Final the following week.

;Week 4
* [[Super League Grand Final]] at [[Old Trafford]], [[Manchester]]

[[Super League XX]] in 2015 introduced a radical change to the league system, under which the 24 clubs in Super League and the second-tier [[Championship (rugby league)|Championship]] are split into three groups of eight after each club has played 22 matches. The top eight clubs in Super League at that point will enter a new play-off structure, beginning with a single round-robin mini-league followed by a Shaughnessy play-off involving the top four teams.

=={{anchor|Best-of}}&lt;!-- [[Best-of series]] redirects here--&gt;Best-of formats==
The "best-of" formats refers to a head-to-head competition where the two competitors compete to first win the majority of the games allotted to win the "series". If a competitor wins a majority of the games, the remaining games may be discarded. This is a modification of the single-elimination tournament to allow more matches to be held. Moreover, if it can be said that if one competitor has a higher probability of winning a single game (and game results are [[i.i.d.]]), the likelihood that this competitor wins the series increases when more games are played. For example, if team A has a seventy percent chance of defeating team B in a single game, its probability of winning a best-of-three series against B is 78.4 percent, and its probability of winning a best-of-seven series is about 87.4 percent.
===Best-of-three playoff===
{{Redirect|Best of three|the Coney Hatch compilation album|Best of Three}}
A '''best-of-three playoff''' is a head-to-head competition between two teams in which one team must win two games to win the series. Two is chosen as it would constitute a majority of the games played; if one team wins both of the first two games, the third game is not played.

Often, when a best-of-series tied with each team having won an even number of games, the bracket is said to be a "best-of-(number of games left)." This is because for all practical purposes the teams are starting over. If a best-of-7 series is deadlocked at 2-2, the bracket is then referred to as a "best-of-3", since the reality is that the first team to win 2 games advances.

In [[tennis]], matches are usually decided with a best-of-3-sets format. Some major tournaments are played in a best-of-5-sets format, most notably the [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] men's singles and doubles. Also, the 35 and over Gentlemen's Invitation Doubles and the 35 and over Ladies' Invitation Doubles of the [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] are both round-robin tournaments.

====In North American competitions====

The first use of the best-of-three playoff was in [[Major League Baseball]]; the [[National League]] authorised such a [[pennant playoff|playoff]] to be held if two teams ended the season in a tie for first place; the [[American League]] used a single game in this situation. Since {{Mlby|1969}} both leagues have used only a one-game playoff for all playoff positions which are tied if only one team can advance to the playoffs. Since {{Mlby|1995}}, a tie-breaker based on season performance can be used only to seed teams.

Both the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] and [[National Hockey League|NHL]] once used best-of-three playoffs (often referred to as "mini-series"), but today neither league does: Pro basketball first adopted the best-of-three playoff for first-round play starting with its inception as the Basketball Association of America in [[1946–47 BAA season|1946]] (changing its name to the NBA three years later) and retaining it through the [[1959–60 NBA season|1959–60]] season; the league resumed its use of the best-of-three first-round series in [[1974–75 NBA season|1974–75]], but abolished it again in [[1983–84 NBA season|1983–84]] when the number of teams qualifying for its postseason tournament was increased to 16 (ten teams had qualified during the first two years of the aforementioned period, this number being expanded to twelve in [[1976–77 NBA season|1976–77]]; in both instances some of the highest-ranking teams did not participate in the best-of-three round, drawing byes and automatically advancing to the second round, which was best-of-seven, as were all subsequent rounds).

In [[ice hockey]], the best-of-three format was one of two possible types of series that could be held to determine the winner of the [[Stanley Cup]] (the other being a two-legged playoff series), and it was used in lower rounds in the [[National Hockey League]] up until the [[Original Six]] era. The best-of-three series in the modern era was first used in the first-round of the Stanley Cup playoffs beginning with the [[1974–75 NHL season|1974–75]] season; at that time, the number of NHL playoff teams had been increased to twelve from the previous eight. The format which then took effect called for the first three finishers in each of the league's four divisions to enter the postseason, but the first-place teams drew byes and did not play any best-of-three series; the postseason then proceeded as the NBA's did, with the second and all later rounds being best-of-seven. This remained the case until the [[1979–80 NHL season|1979–80]] season, when the NHL expanded its playoff field to 16 after absorbing four teams from the defunct [[World Hockey Association]] in a semi-merger, whereupon the byes were abolished and all 16 qualifying teams participated in the first round, which was lengthened to best-of-five. In both the NBA and NHL, the team with the higher finish during the regular season played the first and (if necessary) the third games of the series at home, with the lower-ranked team hosting the second game.

The [[World Cup of Hockey]], organized by the NHL, used a best-of-three format in the final round in [[1996 World Cup of Hockey|1996]] and [[2016 World Cup of Hockey|2016]], as did the [[Canada Cup]]. 

Until 2009, the [[WNBA]] forced the team with the higher record to travel to the lower seed's home court for game 1, then played the final game(s) at home. Because of this perceived inequity, in [[2010 WNBA season|2010]], the league switched to a more traditional 1-1-1 format, where the higher seed would play the first and (if needed) third games at home. Also, in [[2005 WNBA season|2005]], the league switched the [[WNBA Finals]] to a best-of-five playoff format. By [[2016 WNBA season|2016]] the league semifinals matched this format.

NCAA Division I baseball uses the best-of-three format in the second round and the final round of its 64-team championship tournament. Starting in 1999, when the tournament expanded from 48 teams (eight regionals of six teams each) to 64 teams (sixteen regionals of four teams each), the NCAA introduced the "super regional", in which the 16 regional winners play in 8 best-of-three series, with the 8 series winners advancing to the [[College World Series]]. If a regional winner is also a national seed (top eight seeds of the 64 first-round teams), it is guaranteed to host the super regional; if no national seed makes a particular super regional, the NCAA puts hosting rights up for bidding between the competing schools. In 2003, the College World Series changed from a one-game final to a best-of-three series.

From approximately the founding of the [[Western Interprovincial Football Union]] in 1936 until the early 1970s, multi-game playoffs series were a regular fixture of professional [[Canadian football]] playoffs. Over the years, both the WIFU (later the [[Canadian Football League West Division|Western Football Conference]]) and the [[Interprovincial Rugby Football Union]] (later the [[Canadian Football League East Division|Eastern Football Conference]]) used a combination of best-of-three series, three game total points series and two game total points series to determine both conference final participants and conference champions. The [[Grey Cup]] itself has always consisted of a single game.

The last best-of-three playoff series in what by then had evolved into a [[Canadian Football League]] consisting of two autonomous conferences was the 1971 Western Conference Final. Since 1972, the West has used one game playoffs. The Eastern Conference (which by that time had abolished the best-of-three format in favour of two game total points series) adopted one game playoffs for the 1973 season.

The [[National Football League]] has always used one-game playoffs.

====Competitions held outside North America====
The [[Euroleague]], the primary [[Europe]]-wide club competition in basketball, introduced a quarterfinal round for the [[Euroleague 2004-05|2004–05 season]] which originally employed a best-of-three format; starting with the [[Euroleague 2008–09|2008–09 season]], the quarterfinal round became best-of-five. This is the only point in the Euroleague where a playoff series is used; all earlier rounds are conducted in a league format, and the quarterfinal winners advance to the Final Four, where all games are one-off knockout matches.

In the [[FIBA Oceania Championship]], the best-of-three series is used if only both [[Australia men's national basketball team|Australia]] and [[New Zealand national basketball team|New Zealand]] play in the tournament. If a team wins the first two games, the last game may still be played. If other teams participate, a regular round-robin or multi-stage tournament is used. In [[FIBA Oceania Championship 2009|2009]], a [[two-legged tie]] was used, but it was reverted to a best-of-3 series in [[2011 FIBA Oceania Championship|2011]].

The best-of-3 playoff system was also used in the Brazilian Football League for the 1998 and 1999 seasons quarterfinals, semifinals and finals. The Brazilian model was unique in that extra time was not used (meaning matches could end in a draw) therefore, this system had a few modifications. If no team could win two games, the team with most victories would qualify. If the two teams had one victory, the team with the best [[goal difference]] would qualify. If the goal difference was the same, the team with the best regular season campaign would qualify. An interesting fact is that during the 1998 season, all the rounds were decided in three games.

=====Twice to beat advantage=====
In a modification of the best-of-3 format, the leagues in the [[Philippines]] awards a ''twice to beat advantage'' to the top seeds; in this case, the team with the twice to beat advantage needs to be beaten twice by its opponent, while it only has to win once, in a ''de facto'' 1–0 lead in a best-of-3 series. First applied in the semifinals of the scholastic [[UAAP Basketball Championship]], it has been adopted by the other scholastic competitions. The professional [[Philippine Basketball Association]] has adopted the format in the early rounds of its playoffs.

An amendment to the rules in 2008 gave the undefeated team of the season in the UAAP (the team that won all elimination round games) a [[bye (sport)|bye]] up to the finals possessing an automatic 1–0 lead in a best-of-5 series, or the ''thrice to beat advantage''. This has since been adopted by the [[NCAA (Philippines)|NCAA]] in 2009 and abolished in 2016, when the undefeated team has a final berth, but played in a common best-of-three format

===Best-of-five playoff===
A '''best-of-five playoff''' is a competition between two teams head-to-head which must win three games to win the series. Three is chosen as it would constitute a majority of games played; whoever has won three games before all five games have been played, all other games are omitted.

At present, only one [[United States|American]] men's professional sports body - [[Major League Baseball]] - makes use of the best-of-five playoff, doing so in its second round, known as the [[Division Series]]. At one time, however, the [[League Championship Series]] was best-of-five, from its birth with both leagues' realignment into two divisions in {{Mlby|1969}}, and continuing until this round was lengthened to best-of-seven in {{Mlby|1985}}. (This change would have immediate ramifications: In the American League, in each of the first two years where the LCS used the best-of-seven format, the [[Kansas City Royals]] in [[1985 American League Championship Series|1985]] and the [[Boston Red Sox]] in [[1986 American League Championship Series|1986]] fell behind 3-1 - which previously would have eliminated them - before coming back to win the series.) When the [[wild card (sports)|wild card]] was first used in {{Mlby|1995}} (it was created for the {{Mlby|1994}} season, but that year's entire postseason was canceled due to [[1994 baseball strike|a players' strike]]), the best-of-five format was authorized for the new Division Series, in which eight teams participated.

During the time that the League Championship Series was best-of-five, a "2-3" format was used, with one team hosting the first two games, the other the last three (these respective roles alternating between the Eastern and Western Division champions regardless of which one finished with the better regular-season record). This procedure was repeated at first when the best-of-five Division Series was added in 1995 (except that two of each league's now three division winners hosted three games and the wild card could never do so), but starting in {{Mlby|1998}} the home-field advantage was awarded to the two division winners in each league that had the best records; also in 1998, the "2-2-1" format was instituted, the team with the home-field advantage being given the first, second and fifth games at home instead of the third, fourth and fifth. For the 2012 postseason, the Division Series reverted to "2-3". With the addition of a second Wild Card team and subsequent [[Major League Baseball Wild Card Game|Wild Card Game]], a decision not made until well after the season schedule had been created, this was done to minimize the disruption of the schedule by giving the Division Series one off day instead of two. With the Wild Card playoff now established and schedules adjusted accordingly, the "2-2-1" format was restored since 2013.

The [[National Basketball Association]] and [[National Hockey League]] both formerly used best-of-five series, the NBA in its second round prior to the {{Nbay|1957}} season, and in the first round from {{Nbay|1960}} through {{Nbay|1966}}, and again from {{Nbay|1983}} until lengthening it to best-of-seven starting in {{Nbay|2002}}, and the NHL for its first-round series beginning with the {{NHL Year|1979|80}} season and lasting until that league increased its first round to best-of-seven in {{NHL Year|1986|87}}. Unlike in baseball, in both NBA and NHL best-of-five series the higher regular-season finisher always hosted the first, second, and (if necessary) fifth games.

As of [[2005 WNBA season|2005]], the [[Women's National Basketball Association]] now uses a best-of-five format for its [[WNBA Finals|championship]] series. The league semifinals matched this format starting in [[2016 WNBA season|2016]].

Historically, most European domestic basketball leagues have used a best-of-five format in their championship series. The main long-standing exceptions are the [[Israeli Basketball Super League|Israeli]] and [[LNB Pro A|French]] leagues, which have historically used one-off finals; the [[Liga ABA|Adriatic League]] (former Yugoslavia), which has changed from a one-off final to a best-of-three final back to a one-off final in recent years; and the [[Lietuvos Krepšinio Lyga|Lithuanian]], [[Dominet Bank Ekstraliga|Polish]] and [[Turkish Basketball League|Turkish]] leagues, which use a best-of-seven format. [[Serie A (basketball)|Italy]] has gone to a best-of-seven final effective with its [[Lega Basket Serie A 2008–09|2008–09 season]]. The [[Euroleague Basketball|Euroleague]] quarterfinal round expanded to best-of-five from best-of-three starting in the 2008-09 season. France changed its final from a one-off match to a best-of-5 series in [[2012–13 LNB Pro A season|2012–13]].

[[The Ashes]], a [[cricket]] series played between [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] and [[England cricket team|England]] is a five-match series. All games are held, and the team with the most wins the trophy. If the series is tied, the team holding the trophy keeps until the next series. Most [[test cricket]] matches are played under this format; others extend up to seven matches. Test cricket is typically hosted by one team throughout the entire series. While series such as this have five matches, it's not exactly "best-of-five", as [[Result (cricket)|draws, and other results]], are possible.

===Best-of-seven playoff===
A '''best-of-seven playoff''' is a competition between two teams head-to-head which must win four games to win the series. Four is chosen as it would constitute a majority of games played; whoever has won four games before all seven games have been played, all other games are omitted.

It is not necessary for the four games to be [[consecutive]]ly won. Draws are not permitted, even in sports where they usually would be - play continues until there is a clear winner (except in [[Nippon Professional Baseball|Japanese professional baseball]], where a standard (12-inning) draw is permitted at the [[Climax Series|stepladder league playoff]] (higher seed wins if series tied after the five or seven game series ends), and a 12-inning draw is permitted in the [[Japan Series]] in all but the eighth game, played only if the series is tied, 3-3-1, after seven games). This ensures that a series will never require more than seven games to conclude. Before the advent of lighting in ballparks ballgames often ended tied because it was too dark to play, a much less common way of ending a ballgame is going past the curfews.{{Clarify|date=August 2010}} Tied games can result in series lasting eight games, which has happened, as in the [[1912 World Series]] and the 1986 Japan Series. This format is currently used in the [[National Basketball Association]] and the [[National Hockey League]] for all their playoff series. [[Major League Baseball]] uses this format only for the [[League Championship Series]] since 1985 and the [[World Series]] from 1905 to 1918 and since 1922, using the "2-3-2" format, with two games at the home stadium of one team, the next three games (the fifth, if necessary) at the home stadium of the other team, and the final two games (if necessary) at the home stadium of the first. (The first round [[Wild Card Game]] is a single game; the second round [[Division Series]] use a five-game series format.)

The [[National Hockey League]] uses this format for its league championship [[Stanley Cup]] playoffs,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=529012 Sample use in NHL press release] Published 12 May 2010. Accessed 26 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; but uses the "2-2-1-1-1" format, alternating the first two games at the home-ice team's home rink, the next two at the second team, and then alternating venues for the fifth, sixth and seventh games (if necessary).

The [[National Basketball Association]] has this format, too, with "2-2-1-1-1" for all playoff rounds, and also the [[NBA Finals|Finals]]; originally the championship round was "2-2-1-1-1" as well (except 1971, 1975, 1978-1979), but was changed to "2-3-2" from 1985-2013 to cut down on travel expenses, as the league's "[[Eastern Conference (NBA)|East]]-[[Western Conference (NBA)|West]]" divisional alignment means the two teams are usually separated by great distances - indeed, the cities represented in the Finals' [[Celtics–Lakers rivalry|most frequent matchup]], [[Los Angeles Lakers|Los Angeles]] and [[Boston Celtics|Boston]], are almost 3,000 miles apart.

The "2-3-2" format, the "2-2-1-1-1" format, and the "1-1-1-1-1-1-1" format are situated such that if a team "sweeps" the series (wins 4-0), it will win two games at home, and two games away. They are also set up such that the team with [[home advantage]] for the series plays at home for the first game and the seventh game if necessary. As previously stated, the "2-3-2" format reduces travel between the two venues, but it then gives the team "without" home advantage three consecutive home games. The "1-1-1-1-1-1-1" format is mainly used in the postseason tournaments of the [[Liiga]] in Finland and the [[Swedish Hockey League]].

The [[American Hockey League|AHL]] and the [[ECHL]] do not use a set playoff format for their league championship playoff tournaments due to scheduling conflicts. For example, in the [[2016 Calder Cup playoffs]], due to scheduling conflicts in both arenas, the Pacific Division finals between the [[Ontario Reign (AHL)|Ontario Reign]] and the [[San Diego Gulls]] used the "1-1-1-1-1-1-1" playoff format, with Ontario hosting the first, third, fifth, and seventh game.&lt;ref&gt;http://lakingsinsider.com/2016/04/30/ontario-san-diego-schedule-a-brutal-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-format/&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted earlier, the [[Chinese Basketball Association|Chinese]], [[Lega Basket Serie A|Italian]], [[Lietuvos krepšinio lyga|Lithuanian]], [[Polish Basketball League|Polish]] and [[Turkish Basketball League|Turkish]] basketball leagues use a best-of-seven format in their championship series. The Turkish playoff has one unique feature. If one team in the championship series (or, for that matter, in ''any'' playoff series) defeated its final opponent in both of their regular-season games, the winning team is granted a 1-0 lead in the series, and the series starts with Game 2. The [[Philippine Basketball Association|Philippine Basketball Association (PBA)]], aside from using the best-of-7 series in its finals series, has also used it on most its semifinals since 2005.

Occasionally, WWE uses this format in some of their matches, like the feud between [[Chris Benoit]] and [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]] in 2005, for the [[WWE United States Championship]], or [[Antonio Cesaro|Cesaro]]'s rivalry against [[Sheamus]], with their first match at August pay-per-view [[SummerSlam (2016)|Summerslam 2016]].

===Best-of-nine playoff===
A '''best-of-nine playoff''' pits two teams head-to-head which must win five games to win the series. Five is chosen as it would constitute a majority of the games played. Whoever has won five games before all nine games have been played, all other games are omitted.

In [[Major League Baseball]], the [[World Series]] was conducted as a best-of-nine playoff in its first year of existence in [[1903 World Series|1903]], then again for three years beginning in [[1919 World Series|1919]], the year of the "[[Black Sox scandal]]."

The [[Western Hockey League]] used the best-of-nine playoff series for the Western Division playoffs from the 1983-84 season through the 1990-91 season because of the unequal division alignment of the league at this time.  The Eastern division had eight teams: six of which qualified for the playoffs. The Western division only had six teams: four of which made the playoffs.  Because of this, Eastern division had 3 rounds of playoffs (two teams receive a first round bye), while the Western division only had two rounds of playoffs.  The east played a best-of-five, best-of-seven, best-of-seven format for the three rounds while both rounds in the Western division playoffs were best-of-nine.  This was used so that both divisions would finish their playoffs at approximately the same time.  The WHL Championship Series was a best-of-seven.  These best-of-nine series went the full nine games on two occasions, with [[Portland Winterhawks|Portland]] defeating [[New Westminster Bruins|New Westminster]] in 1984 and [[Spokane Chiefs|Spokane]] in 1986.

The [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League]] used the best-of-nine playoff series for the 1986 playoffs.

===Higher number of games===
In [[snooker]], a player must win a certain number of frames to win a [[Snooker rules#A snooker match|match]], often nine (best-of-17) or more. Again, if one player wins nine frames before all 17 are played, the rest are omitted. The [[Snooker World Championship|world championship]] final is currently decided in a best-of-35 match.

In [[9-ball]], a player must win a certain number of racks to win a match. In the [[WPA World Nine-ball Championship]], nine racks are needed to win in the early stages, ten to eleven in the latter stages, and 17 in the final. As with snooker, if one player wins nine frames before all 17 are played, the rest are omitted.

==Total points series (aggregate)==
{{further|Two-legged tie}}
Various playoff formats, including [[two-legged tie]]s and '''total points series''' pair off participants in a number of games (often two), with the winner being determined by '''aggregate score''': the winner being the one who scores the most points/goals etc. over the series of games. Two-legged ties are common in [[association football]], and were used in [[NHL]] playoff series until 1937. It currently used in North America in the [[MLS Cup Playoffs]]. 

In [[2004 NASCAR Nextel Cup Series|2004]], [[NASCAR]] adopted a total points playoff of a different stripe, creating a "[[NASCAR playoffs|Chase for the Cup]]" that allowed a golf-style cut of the high ten or 400 points of the leader, whichever is greater, to compete for the championship in the last ten races. The Chase format has changed several times since its creation:
* In the [[2007 NASCAR Nextel Cup Series|2007 season]], the Chase was expanded to include the top 12 drivers after 26 races. The points of the drivers in the cut are elevated far beyond those of the pack. From [[2007 Chase for the NEXTEL Cup|2007]] to [[2010 Chase for the Sprint Cup|2010]], each Chase driver received 5,000 points, with a 10-point bonus for each race won prior to the Chase.
* Starting in [[2011 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series|2011]], the points system and Chase qualification criteria were significantly changed. Through the [[2013 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series|2013 season]], the top 10 drivers after 26 races automatically qualified for the Chase, joined by the two drivers with the most race wins among those ranked between 11th and 20th in points after 26 races. Reflecting a major change to the points system, in which the race winner can now earn a maximum of 48 points as opposed to 195 in the former system, driver points were reset to a base of 2,000. After the reset, automatic qualifiers received 3 bonus points for each race win, while the wild card qualifiers did not receive a bonus for wins. In the 2013 season, a 13th driver ([[Jeff Gordon]]) was added to the Chase following [[2013 Federated Auto Parts 400#The Singapore Sling and Team Orders Controversy|a major scandal]] in the [[2013 Federated Auto Parts 400|final pre-Chase race]] in which two teams were found to have extensively manipulated the race results in the final laps. 
* The [[2014 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series|2014 season]] introduced a radically different format, although the basic points system remains identical to that in the 2011–2013 period. Under the current system, the Monster Energy field, now officially called the "Monster Energy Grid", consists of 16 drivers. These drivers are chosen primarily on the basis of race wins during the first 26 races, provided that said drivers are in the top 30 in series points and have attempted to qualify for each race (barring injuries). The points leader is assured of a place on the Grid, but only if he does not have a race win. Any remaining spots on the Grid are filled in order of driver points. The format from this point is radically different—the Chase is now divided into four rounds, with three races in each of the first three rounds and a one-race finale.
** As in the 2011–2013 format, initial driver points are reset to 2,000 with a 3-point bonus for each win. All 16 Grid drivers compete to remain in the Chase for the first three Chase races, known as the "Challenger Round". After these races, the four lowest-placed drivers on the Grid are eliminated; they retain their points from the previous races and accumulate points in the remaining races based on the regular-season scoring system (this also applies to drivers eliminated at later stages). The winner of each of the first three races automatically advances to the next round of the Chase.
** The next round, the "Contender Round", starts with 12 drivers, each with 3,000 points but with no win bonus. As in the Challenger Round, the winner of each race in this round advances to the next round. As in the previous round, the four drivers with the lowest points total after this round are eliminated.
** The third round, the "Eliminator Round", starts with eight drivers, each with 4,000 points, again with no win bonus. As in the previous rounds, the winner of each race in this round advances to the next round. Again, the four drivers with the lowest points total after this round are eliminated.
** The last race of the season starts with four drivers still in contention for the championship; each starts the race with 5,000 points. The highest finisher of the four becomes Monster Energy Cup champion.

Regardless of the exact format, the driver in the Chase group with the most points after the final ten races wins the [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series|Monster Energy Cup]].

In [[2005 PGA Tour|November 2005]], the [[PGA Tour]] announced that a similar total points playoff would be used to lead up to the [[PGA Championship]], starting in [[2007 PGA Tour|2007]]. The player with the most points at the end of the year would take home the [[FedEx Cup]].

Prior to the 1986 Playoffs, the Canadian Hockey League (especially the Ontario Hockey League) used the point series, to determine, which team would advance. In those situation, where the higher seeded host in odd number of game (game #1, 3, 5, 7), while the other team host the even number (game #2, 4, 6, 8). There would be no overtime, except for the deciding game, because a tie in the last game, of the series would not declare a series winner, so should that happens, there would be a sudden-death overtime, with the winner getting 2 points, and the losing team get nothing.

The game shows ''[[Jeopardy!]]'', ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'', and ''[[The Challengers (game show)|The Challengers]]'' have used two-game series in the final rounds of most of the tournaments that they held during their history. Each game is played separately (i.e., money from day one cannot be wagered on day two), and the money is added together to determine the winner. The only exception to this was in the [[Jeopardy! Ultimate Tournament of Champions|''Jeopardy!'' Ultimate Tournament of Champions]], when the two semifinal matches were both two-game series, and the final was a three-game series. If any ties remain, [[sudden death (sports)|sudden death]] was played to determine the champion.

==Round robin==
{{Main article|Round-robin tournament}}
In a '''round-robin tournament''', all playoff contenders play each other an equal number of times, usually once or twice (often called a "double round-robin"). This is a common format for [[association football]]. In the [[FIFA World Cup]], teams are organized into eight pools of four teams, playing each other once and ranked by points earned through wins (3 points) and draws (1 point). The top two teams advance out of each pool to the knockout phase where the top team from each pool face a second-placed team from a different pool.

Continental club football tournaments have included round robin formats, such as the [[Copa Libertadores]] from the 1966 season, [[UEFA Champions League]] from the 1992/93 season, [[UEFA Cup]] from 2004/05, and the [[AFC Champions League|Asian]] and [[CAF Champions League|African]] Champions Leagues. Teams are seeded such that strongest teams should not meet until the end. In the UEFA Champions League, 32 teams are divided into eight groups of four. The group winners and runners-up advance to a two-game, total goals round, the eight third-placed teams move into the UEFA Cup third round, and the eight fourth-placed teams are eliminated.

In [[basketball]], the [[Basketball at the Summer Olympics|Olympics]] also uses a round robin of the same nature, going to single elimination after the first round. The Euroleague has two double round-robin phases. The first is a "Regular Season" in which the 24 teams are divided into four groups of six (as of the 2008-09 season). The four top teams in each group advance to a "Top 16" phase in which the teams are divided into four groups of four each. The top two teams from each Top 16 group are then paired in four best-of-five quarterfinal series, with the winners advancing to the single-elimination Final Four.

Round-robin tournaments are also used in [[rugby union]], [[curling]], and many amateur or lower-division basketball, football, and hockey tournaments.

In 1992, the [[Little League World Series]] in youth baseball went to a round-robin tournament in the first round instead of single-elimination. In 2001, the tournament expanded to 16 teams and stayed with a round-robin for the first round, but cross-bracketed single elimination for the second round before the two winners of those games advanced to the region final. Little League used this format through 2009.

In [[Major League Baseball]], the term "round robin" was used with regard to the possibility of a 3-way tie for the [[1964 in baseball|National League pennant in 1964]].  The [[Philadelphia Phillies]] had had a 6½ game lead with 12 games left in their regular schedule, but then lost 10 games in a row, so that the season went into its last day with 3 teams still having a chance for the NL pennant.  As it turns out, the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] defeated the [[New York Mets]] on that day to take the NL pennant with no playoff; the reverse of that outcome would have left the Cardinals, the Phillies, and the [[Cincinnati Reds]] in a 3-way tie.

==Associated concepts==
As discussed above, leagues also offer innovations in order to give advantage to teams that performed better in the regular season, such as reseeding and home advantage.

===Reseeding===
In tournaments where participants are seeded, in order to ensure that the strongest remaining team faces the weakest team, the participants are "reseeded" at each round; the tournament bracket is not fixed, where potential matchups can be readily determined up to the final. For example, in a regular 8-team bracket, the teams that will meet at the second round will be the winner of the #1 vs. #8 going up against the winner of #4 and #5, and the winner of #2 and #7 going up against the winner of #3 and #6. If the #5 and the #7 teams won in the first round, the second round matchups will be #1 vs. #7 and #3 vs. #5, instead of #1 vs. #5 and #3 vs. #7.

The only notable tournaments that employ this rule are the NFL Playoffs, [[WNBA Playoffs]] and the MLS Cup Playoffs. The Stanley Cup Playoffs had used that rule from 1994-2013. Note that reseeding does not come into play if there are only 2 rounds of competition.

====Example====
As it was used in the [[1994 Stanley Cup playoffs]] (scores in the bracket shown indicate the number of games won in each seven-game series):
{{1994 Stanley Cup playoffs}}

===Home advantage===
In team sports, the "[[home advantage|hometown advantage]]" refers to the phenomenon when certain teams (usually the higher-seeded teams) are afforded more games that can be played at their home arena/stadium than their opponent's. This is predominant in the best-of series where there are more games played in a team's arena/stadium than the other, and in single-elimination tournaments where the single game is disputed in a team's stadium. In a best-of series, a team can "lose" their home advantage if the visiting team wins the first game. Home advantage can be regained or lost in the course of the series.

As discussed above, a team can clinch the "home advantage" in a variety of ways:
*Clinching the higher seed (MLB, NHL and NFL)
*Winning more games than the opponent, but not necessarily clinching the higher seed (NBA)

In best-of series, the order of arenas/stadiums in which the games are played at also affects the home advantage. In the NBA and the NHL, all rounds are done in a 2-2-1-1-1 format, that is, the team with home advantage plays games 1-2, 5 and 7 (latter two games if needed). This ensures that the team with home advantage never trails assuming every game is won by the home team. From [[1985 NBA Finals|1985]] to [[2013 NBA Finals|2013]] the NBA Finals had utilised the 2-3-2 format (the team with the home court advantage plays games 1-2 and 6-7 in their home court), which can theoretically allow the team with the home court advantage to trail in the series (although that will require the team with the home court advantage to lose the middle three games, which has only happened thrice).

In NHL's Stanley Cup Finals, NBA Finals, and MLB's World Series, the teams with the higher regular season record receives the home advantage. The NFL's Super Bowl is held at a predetermined site regardless of which teams reach the game, which usually means there is no home advantage but it is still possible for the host city's team to play in the Super Bowl. Until 2016, In MLB's World Series, the team that came from the league that won the All-Star Game is awarded with the home field advantage.

In [[two-legged tie]]s such as the [[UEFA Champions League]], although it is said that the two teams play an equal number of games in their home stadium, the team playing the second game in their home stadium has a distinct advantage,{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} such as the resolution of ties will be at their stadium.

In games done on neutral venues, a team may still be afforded the privileges of the "home team" such as selecting which side to play first or choosing the side of the coin in coin flips. In most instances, this privilege is determined either by a drawing of lots (UEFA Champions League) or by rotation among the groupings of the different teams (NFL).

In the [[Nippon Professional Baseball]]'s postseason games (excluding [[Japan Series]]) since 2004, the team having a better position in regular position will be hosting all the games. In addition, since 2008, the League Champion will have a 1-win advantage in the 2nd stage of Climax Series (best-of-7 which actually played for 6 games).

[[File:SimpleDiagramPyrolysis.png|alt=Simplified Pyrolysis chemistry on burning wood|thumb|400x400px|Simplified depiction of pyrolysis chemistry]]
'''Pyrolysis''' is the [[thermal]] [[Chemical decomposition|decomposition]] of materials at elevated temperatures in an inert atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://goldbook.iupac.org/html/P/P04961.html |title=Compendium of Chemical Terminology |accessdate=2018-01-10 |year=2009 |page=1824 |publisher=[[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involves the change of [[chemical composition]] and is irreversible. The word is coined from the [[Greek language|Greek]]-derived [[morpheme|element]]s ''pyro'' "fire" and ''[[lysis]]'' "separating".

Pyrolysis is most commonly used to the treatment of [[organic compound|organic]] materials. It is one of the processes involved in [[charring]] wood.&lt;ref name=inno&gt;[http://virtual.vtt.fi/virtual/innofirewood/stateoftheart/database/burning/burning.html ''Burning of wood''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209095142/http://virtual.vtt.fi/virtual/innofirewood/stateoftheart/database/burning/burning.html |date=2010-02-09 }}, InnoFireWood's website. Accessed on 2010-02-06.&lt;/ref&gt;  In general, pyrolysis of organic substances produces volatile products and leaves a solid residue enriched in carbon, [[char]]. Extreme pyrolysis, which leaves mostly [[carbon]] as the residue, is called [[carbonization]].

The process is used heavily in the [[chemical industry]], for example, to produce [[ethylene]], many forms of [[carbon]], and other chemicals from petroleum, coal, and even wood, to produce [[coke (fuel)|coke]] from [[coal]].  Aspirational applications of pyrolysis would convert [[biomass]] into [[syngas]] and [[biochar]],  waste plastics back into usable oil, or waste into safely disposable substances.

==Process terminology and mechanism==
Special cases of pyrolysis include [[dry distillation]], [[destructive distillation]], [[cracking (chemistry)|cracking]], and [[thermal depolymerization]].  It generally involves the breaking of chemical bonds in molecules to give smaller molecules; but may also leave residues with larger molecular mass.  The phenomenon involves exceeding the [[decomposition temperature]] of the material.

Pyrolysis differs from other processes like [[combustion]] and [[hydrolysis]] in that it usually does not involve the addition of other reagents such as [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, in combustion) or water (in hydrolysis).&lt;ref&gt;Cory A. Kramer, Reza Loloee, Indrek S. Wichman and Ruby N. Ghosh, 2009, [http://proceedings.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=1638571 Time Resolved Measurements of Pyrolysis Products From Thermoplastic Poly-Methyl-Methacrylate (PMMA)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106220719/http://proceedings.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=1638571 |date=2014-11-06 }} ''ASME 2009 International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition''&lt;/ref&gt;  In practice, it is often not practical to achieve completely O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;- or water-free conditions, especially as pyrolysis is often conducted on complex mixtures.  The term has also been applied to the decomposition of organic material in the presence of [[superheated water]] or steam ([[hydrous pyrolysis]]), for example, in the [[Cracking (chemistry)|steam cracking]] of oil. Pyrolysis has been assumed to take place during [[catagenesis (geology)|catagenesis]], the conversion of [[kerogen|buried organic matter]] to [[fossil fuels]]. 

Conversely, the starting material may be heated in a [[vacuum]] to decrease the [[boiling point]] of the byproducts and avoid adverse chemical reactions. An example is the process of [[flash vacuum pyrolysis]] used in [[organic synthesis]].

Volatile pyrolysis byproducts can be [[Chemical analysis|analyzed]] through separation by [[gas chromatography]] and identification by [[mass spectrometry]], a process known as [[pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry|Py-GC-MS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Goodacre, R.; Kell, D. B.|title=Pyrolysis mass spectrometry and its applications in biotechnology|journal=Curr. Opin. Biotechnol.|year=1996|volume=7||pages= 20-28|doi=10.1016/S0958-1669(96)80090-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Peacock, P. M.; McEwen, C. N.|title=Mass Spectrometry of Synthetic Polymers. Anal. Chem.|year=2006|volume=78|pages=3957-3964|doi=10.1021/ac0606249}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pyrolysis is also used in [[carbon-14 dating]].

== Occurrence and uses ==
===Ethylene===
Pyrolysis is used to produce [[ethylene]], the chemical compound produced on the largest scale industrially (&gt;110 million tons/year in 2005).  In this process, hydrocarbons from petroleum are heated to around 600 °C in the presence of steam, i.e. [[steam cracking]].  The resulting ethylene is used to make antifreeze ([[ethylene glycol]]), PVC (via [[vinyl chloride]]), and many polymers, such as polyethylene and polystyrene.&lt;ref name=UllmannEthylene&gt;{{cite book |first1=Heinz |last1=Zimmermann |first2=Roland |last2=Walz |chapter=Ethylene |title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |publisher=Wiley-VCH |location=Weinheim |year=2008 |doi=10.1002/14356007.a10_045.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coke, carbon, charcoals, and chars ===
Carbon and carbon-rich materials have desirable properties but are nonvolatile, even at high temperatures.  Consequently, pyrolysis is used to produce many kinds of carbon; these can be used for fuel, as reagents in steelmaking (coke), and as structural materials.

High temperature pyrolysis is used on an industrial scale to convert [[coal]] into [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] for [[metallurgy]], especially [[steelmaking]].  Volatile products are often useful, including [[benzene]] and [[pyridine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|authors=Ludwig Briesemeister, Andreas Geißler, Stefan Halama, Stephan Herrmann, Ulrich Kleinhans, Markus Steibel, Markus Ulbrich, Alan W. Scaroni, M. Rashid Khan, Semih Eser, Ljubisa R. Radovic|title=Coal Pyrolysis|encyclopedia=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|year=2002|publisher=Wiley-VCH|place=Weinheim| doi=10.1002/14356007.a07_245.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coke can also be produced from the solid residue left from petroleum refining.
[[File:CoalPyrolysisProducts.png|thumb|290px|Typical organic products obtained by pyrolysis of coal (X = CH, N).]]
The coke-making or "coking" process consists of heating the material in "coking ovens" to very high temperatures (up to {{convert|900|C|F|disp=or|sigfig=2}}) so that those molecules are broken down into lighter volatile substances, which leave the vessel, and a porous but hard residue that is mostly carbon and inorganic ash. The amount of volatiles varies with the source material, but is typically 25–30% of it by weight.

The original [[xylem|vascular structure]] of the wood and the pores created by escaping gases combine to produce a light and porous material. By starting with a dense wood-like material, such as [[nutshell]]s or [[peach]] [[endocarp|stone]]s, one obtains a form of charcoal with particularly fine pores (and hence a much larger pore surface area), called [[activated carbon]], which is used as an [[adsorption|adsorbent]] for a wide range of chemical substances.

[[Biochar]] is the residue of incomplete organic pyrolysis, e.g., from cooking fires.  They are a key component of the [[terra preta]] soils associated with ancient [[indigenous peoples of Brazil|indigenous]] communities of the [[Amazon basin]].&lt;ref name="lehmann1"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Terra preta is much sought by local farmers for its superior fertility and capacity to promote and retain an enhanced suite of beneficial microbiota than the typical red soil of the region.  Efforts are underway to recreate these soils through [[biochar]], the solid residue of pyrolysis of various materials, mostly organic waste.

[[Carbon fiber]]s are filaments of carbon that can be used to make very strong yarns and textiles. Carbon fiber items are often produced by spinning and weaving the desired item from fibers of a suitable [[polymer]], and then pyrolyzing the material at a high temperature (from {{convert|1500|-|3000|°C|F|disp=or|sigfig=3}}).  The first carbon fibers were made from [[rayon]], but [[polyacrylonitrile]] has become the most common starting material.  For their first workable [[electric lamp]]s, [[Joseph Wilson Swan]] and [[Thomas Edison]] used carbon filaments made by pyrolysis of [[cotton]] yarns and [[bamboo]] splinters, respectively.

Pyrolysis is the reaction used to coat a preformed substrate with a layer of [[pyrolytic carbon]]. This is typically done in a fluidized bed reactor heated to {{convert|1000|-|2000|°C|F|disp=or|sigfig=3}}. Pyrolytic carbon coatings are used in many applications, including [[artificial heart valve]]s.&lt;ref name="ratner"&gt;Ratner, Buddy D. (2004). Pyrolytic carbon.

Other sources of [[organic matter]] as feedstock for pyrolysis include greenwaste, sawdust, waste wood, nut shells, straw, cotton trash, rice hulls. Animal waste including poultry litter, dairy manure, and potentially other manures are also under evaluation. Some industrial byproducts are also suitable feedstock including paper sludge and distillers grain.&lt;ref name=bestEnergiesBestPyrol&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;  Higher efficiency is sometimes achieved by '''flash pyrolysis''', in which finely divided feedstock is quickly heated to between {{convert|350|and|500|°C|F|sigfig=2}} for less than two seconds. 

The low quality of oils produced through pyrolysis can be improved by physical and chemical processes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ramirez|first1=Jerome|last2=Brown|first2=Richard|last3=Rainey|first3=Thomas|title=A Review of Hydrothermal Liquefaction Bio-Crude Properties and Prospects for Upgrading to Transportation Fuels|journal=Energies|date=1 July 2015|volume=8|pages=6765–6794|doi=10.3390/en8076765}}&lt;/ref&gt; which might drive up production costs, but may make sense economically as circumstances change.

&lt;/ref&gt;  Fuel bio-oil can also be produced by [[hydrous pyrolysis]].

=== Semiconductors ===
The process of [[metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy]] (MOCVD) entails pyrolysis of volatile organometallic compounds to give semiconductors, hard coatings, and other applicable materials.  The reactions entail thermal degradation of precursors, with deposition of the inorganic component and release of the hydrocarbons as gaseous waste. Since it is an atom-by-atom deposition, these atoms organize themselves into crystals to form the bulk semiconductor. Silicon chips are produced by the pyrolysis of silane:
:SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  →  Si  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
[[Gallium arsenide]], another semiconductor, forms upon co-pyrolysis of [[trimethylgallium]] and [[arsine]].
[[Image:MOCVDprocess.jpg|thumb|300 px|Illustration of the MOCVD process, which entails pyrolysis of volatile ]]

=== Recycling===
{{See also|Thermal Depolymerisation}}
Pyrolysis can also be used to treat plastic waste.  The main advantage is the reduction in volume of the waste.  In principle, pyrolysis will regenerate the monomers (precursors) to the polymers that are treated, but in practice the process is neither a clean nor an economically competitive source of monomers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first1=Walter |last1=Kaminsky |title=Plastics, Recycling |encyclopedia=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |publisher=Wiley-VCH |location=Weinheim |year=2000 |doi=10.1002/14356007.a21_057}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N.J.

=== Thermal cleaning ===
{{See also|Thermal cleaning}}
Pyrolysis is also used for ''thermal cleaning'', an industrial application to remove [[Organic chemistry|organic]] substances such as [[polymer]]s, [[plastic]]s and [[coating]]s from parts, products or production components like [[Plastics extrusion|extruder screws]], [[Spinneret (polymers)|spinnerets]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fiberjournal.com/back-issues/ |title=Effective Spinneret Cleaning |author=Heffungs, Udo |date=June 2010 |publisher=Fiber Journal |access-date=19 April 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630015337/http://www.fiberjournal.com/back-issues/ |archivedate=30 June 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[static mixer]]s.

==Fine chemical synthesis==
Pyrolysis is used in the production of chemical compounds, mainly, but not only, in the research laboratory.  

The area of boron-hydride clusters started with the study of the pyrolysis of [[diborane]] (B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) at ca. 200 °C.  Products include the clusters  [[pentaborane]] and [[decaborane]].  These pyrolyses involve not only cracking (to give H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), but also re[[condensation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd}} gives Greenwood, Norman N.; Earnshaw, Alan (1997).

==History==
Pyrolysis has been used for turning wood into [[charcoal]] since ancient times. Many important chemical substances, such as [[phosphorus]] and [[sulfuric acid]], were first obtained by this process. In their embalming process, the ancient Egyptians used methanol, which they obtained from the pyrolysis of wood.  The dry distillation of wood remained the major source of methanol into the early 20th Century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |authors=E. Fiedler, G. Grossmann, D. B. Kersebohm, G.

'''Qadariyah''' (or '''Qadariya''') is an originally derogatory term designating early Islamic theologians who asserted that humans possess free will, whose exercise makes them responsible for their actions, justifying divine punishment and absolving God of responsibility for evil in the world.&lt;ref name=Qadariyyah&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Qadariyyah|editor=John L. Esposito|encyclopedia=The Oxford Dictionary of Islam|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2014|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195125580.001.0001/acref-9780195125580-e-1901|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. van Ess. Encyclopedia of Islam, 2nd ed, Brill. "Ķadariyya", vol.4, p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of their doctrines were later adopted by the [[Mu'tazili]]s and rejected by the [[Ash'ari]]s.&lt;ref name=Qadariyyah/&gt;

Qadariya was one of the first philosophical schools in Islam.&lt;ref&gt;History of Syria including Lebanon and Palestine, by Philip K. Hitti, pg. 499&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest document associated with the movement is the ''Risala'' by [[Hasan al-Basri]], which was composed between 75/694 and 80/699, though debates about free will in Islam probably predate this text.&lt;ref&gt;J. van Ess. Encyclopedia of Islam, 2nd ed, Brill. "Ķadariyya", vol.4, p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Sunni sources, the Qadariyah were censured by [[Muhammad]] himself by being compared to [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]], who likewise deny [[predestination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The vision of Islam|date=1994|publisher=Paragon House|isbn=9781557785169|page=258|author=Sachiko Murata, [[William Chittick]]|edition=illustrated|chapter=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is reported in [[Sunan Abu Dawood]]: 
Narrated [[Abdullah ibn Umar]]: The Prophet said, "The Qadariyyah are the [[Magi|Magians]] of this community. If they are ill, do not pay a sick visit to them, and if they die, do not attend their funerals."&lt;ref&gt;[[Sunan Abu Dawood]]: Model Behavior of the Prophet (Kitab Al-Sunnah): Book 40: Hadith 4674.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''right to privacy''' is an element of various legal traditions to restrain [[governmental]] and private actions that threaten the [[privacy]] of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.privacilla.org/business/privacytorts.html The Privacy Torts]" (December 19, 2000).

Since the [[global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|global surveillance disclosures]] of 2013, initiated by ex-[[NSA]] employee [[Edward Snowden]], the inalienable human right to privacy has been a subject of international debate. In combating worldwide terrorism, government agencies, such as the [[NSA]], [[CIA]], [[R&amp;AW]] and [[GCHQ]], have engaged in [[mass surveillance|mass]], [[global surveillance]].

There is now a question as whether the right to privacy act can co-exist with the [[surveillance state|current capabilities]] of [[intelligence agency|intelligence agencies]] to access and analyse virtually in every detail of an individual's life. A major question is that whether or not the right to privacy needs to be forfeited as part of the [[social contract]] to bolster defense against supposed terrorist threats.

Private sector actors could also threaten the right to privacy. Increasingly, questions have arisen about the use of [[Personally identifiable information|personal data]] for targeted advertising, sharing data with external parties and reusing personal data within [[big data]] by large technology giants, such as  [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]],  [[Apple Inc.|Apple]],  [[Facebook]],  [[Google]], and [[Yahoo]]. These concerns have been strengthened by scandals, revealing that the [[Psychographics|psychographic]] company [[Cambridge Analytica]] was using personal data, illegitimately obtained through Facebook, to manipulate and influence large groups of people, including during the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 US Presidential elections]].

==Background==
State of consideration of constitutional laws and acts formed by sectors and sections

Privacy uses the theory of [[natural rights]], and generally responds to new information and communication technologies. In the United States, an article in the December 15, 1890 issue of the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'', written by attorney [[Samuel D. Warren]] and future U.S. Supreme Court Justice, [[Louis Brandeis]], entitled "[[The Right to Privacy (article)|The Right to Privacy]]", is often cited as the first explicit declaration of a U.S. right to privacy. Warren and Brandeis wrote that privacy is the "right to be let alone", and focused on protecting individuals.  This approach was a response to recent technological developments of the time, such as photography, and sensationalist journalism, also known as "[[yellow journalism]]".&lt;ref name=Brandeis&gt;Warren and Brandeis, [http://www.law.louisville.edu/library/collections/brandeis/node/225 "The Right to Privacy"], 4 ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'' 193 (1890)&lt;/ref&gt;

Privacy rights are inherently intertwined with information technology. In his widely cited [[dissenting opinion]] in ''[[Olmstead v. United States]]'' (1928), Brandeis relied on thoughts he developed in his 1890 article ''The Right to Privacy''. But in his dissent, he now changed the focus whereby he urged making personal privacy matters more relevant to [[constitutional law]], going so far as saying "the government [was] identified...as a potential privacy invader." He writes, "Discovery and invention have made it possible for the Government, by means far more effective than stretching upon the rack, to obtain disclosure in court of what is whispered in the closet." At that time, telephones were often community assets, with shared party lines and the potentially nosey human operators. By the time of [[Katz v. United States|Katz]], in 1967, telephones had become personal devices with lines not shared across homes and switching was electro-mechanical. In the 1970s, new computing and recording technologies began to raise concerns about privacy, resulting in the [[FTC Fair Information Practice|Fair Information Practice Principles]].

===Definitions===
In recent years there has been only few attempts to clearly and precisely define the "right to privacy". In 2005, students of the [[Haifa Center for Law &amp; Technology]] asserted that in fact the right to privacy "should not be defined as a separate legal right" at all. By their reasoning, existing laws relating to privacy in general should be sufficient.&lt;ref name=Haifa&gt;Yael Onn, et al., [https://books.google.com/books?id=yeVRrrJw-zAC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=right+to+privacy+tel+aviv&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=T0IhTaWhEI-msQOizMWZCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=right%20to%20privacy%20tel%20aviv&amp;f=false ''Privacy in the Digital Environment''],  Haifa Center of Law &amp; Technology, (2005) pp. 1–12&lt;/ref&gt; Other experts, such as [[William Prosser (academic)|William Prosser]], have attempted, but failed, to find a "common ground" between the leading kinds of privacy cases in the court system, at least to formulate a definition.&lt;ref name=Haifa/&gt; One law school treatise from Israel, however, on the subject of "privacy in the digital environment," suggests that the "right to privacy should be seen as an independent right that deserves legal protection in itself." It has therefore proposed a working definition for a "right to privacy":

&lt;blockquote&gt;The right to privacy is our right to keep a domain around us, which includes all those things that are part of us, such as our body, home, property, thoughts, feelings, secrets and identity. The right to privacy gives us the ability to choose which parts in this domain can be accessed by others, and to control the extent, manner and timing of the use of those parts we choose to disclose.&lt;ref name=Haifa/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===An individual right===
[[Alan Westin]] believes that new technologies alter the balance between privacy and disclosure, and that privacy rights may limit government surveillance to protect democratic processes. Westin defines privacy as "the claim of individuals, groups, or institutions to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent information about them is communicated to others". Westin describes four states of privacy: solitude, intimacy, anonymity, reserve.  These states must balance participation against norms:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Each individual is continually engaged in a personal adjustment process in which he balances the desire for privacy with the desire for disclosure and communication of himself to others, in light of the environmental conditions and social norms set by the society in which he lives.
:— Alan Westin, ''Privacy and Freedom'', 1968&lt;ref&gt;Westin, A. (1968). ''Privacy and Freedom'' (Fifth ed.). New York.: Atheneum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Under liberal democratic systems, privacy creates a space separate from political life, and allows personal autonomy, while ensuring democratic [[Freedom of association|freedoms of association]] and [[Freedom of speech|expression]].

David Flaherty believes networked computer databases pose threats to privacy.  He develops 'data protection' as an aspect of privacy, which involves "the collection, use, and dissemination of personal information".  This concept forms the foundation for fair information practices used by governments globally.  Flaherty forwards an idea of privacy as information control, "[i]ndividuals want to be left alone and to exercise some control over how information about them is used".&lt;ref&gt;Flaherty, D. (1989).

[[Marc Rotenberg]] has described the modern right to privacy as Fair Information Practices: "the rights and responsibilities associated with the collection and use of personal information." Rotenberg emphasizes that the allocation of rights are to the data subject and the responsibilities are assigned to the data collectors because of the transfer of the data and the asymmetry of information concerning data practices.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, A. &amp; Rotenberg, M. (2016). Privacy Law and Society. West Academic.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Posner]] and [[Lawrence Lessig]] focus on the economic aspects of personal information control.  Posner criticizes privacy for concealing information, which reduces market efficiency.  For Posner, employment is selling oneself in the labour market, which he believes is like selling a product. Any 'defect' in the 'product' that is not reported is fraud.&lt;ref&gt;Posner, R. A. (1981). The economics of privacy. [[The American Economic Review]], 71(2), 405–409.&lt;/ref&gt; For Lessig, privacy breaches online can be regulated through code and law.  Lessig claims "the protection of privacy would be stronger if people conceived of the right as a property right", and that "individuals should be able to control information about themselves".&lt;ref&gt;Lessig, L. (2006). Code: Version 2.0. New York, U.S.: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;  Economic approaches to privacy make communal conceptions of privacy difficult to maintain.

===A collective value and a human right===
There have been attempts to reframe privacy as a fundamental [[Human rights|human right]], whose social value is an essential component in the functioning of democratic societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Deborah|title=Ethical theory and business.|year=2009|publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|isbn=0136126022|pages=428–442|edition=8th|authorlink=Privacy|editors=Beauchamp, Bowie, Arnold}}&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Amitai Etzioni]] suggests a [[Communitarianism|communitarian]] approach to privacy.  This requires a shared moral culture for establishing social order.&lt;ref&gt;Etzioni, A. (2006). Communitarianism. In B. S. Turner (Ed.), The Cambridge Dictionary of Sociology (pp. 81–83). Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Etzioni believes that "[p]rivacy is merely one good among many others",&lt;ref&gt;Etzioni, A. (2007). "Are new technologies the enemy of privacy?" ''Knowledge, Technology &amp; Policy'', 20, 115–119.&lt;/ref&gt; and that technological effects depend on community accountability and oversight.  He claims that privacy laws only increase government surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;Etzioni, A. (2000). A communitarian perspective on privacy. Connecticut Law Review, 32(3), 897–905.&lt;/ref&gt;

Priscilla Regan believes that individual concepts of privacy have failed philosophically and in policy.  She supports a social value of privacy with three dimensions: shared perceptions, public values, and [[Collectivism|collective]] components.  Shared ideas about privacy allows freedom of conscience and diversity in thought.  Public values guarantee democratic participation, including freedoms of speech and association, and limits government power.  Collective elements describe privacy as collective good that cannot be divided.  Regan's goal is to strengthen privacy claims in policy making: "if we did recognize the collective or public-good value of privacy, as well as the common and public value of privacy, those advocating privacy protections would have a stronger basis upon which to argue for its protection".&lt;ref&gt;Regan, P. M. (1995). Legislating privacy: Technology, social values, and public policy. Chapel Hill, U.S.: The University of North Carolina Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leslie Regan Shade argues that the human right to privacy is necessary for meaningful democratic participation, and ensures human dignity and autonomy.  Privacy depends on norms for how information is distributed, and if this is appropriate. Violations of privacy depend on context.  The human right to privacy has precedent in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights. Shade believes that privacy must be approached from a people-centered perspective, and not through the marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;Shade, L. R. (2008). Reconsidering the right to privacy in Canada. Bulletin of Science, Technology &amp; Society, 28(1), 80–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Universal Declaration of Human Rights ===
A right to privacy is explicitly stated under Article 12 of the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Privacy laws in different countries ==

=== United States ===
{{main article| Privacy laws of the United States}}
Although the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] does not explicitly include the right to privacy, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] has found that the Constitution implicitly grants a right to privacy against governmental intrusion from the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], [[Third Amendment to the United States Constitution|Third Amendment]], [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]], and the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Hao. ''Protecting Privacy in China: A Research on China's Privacy Standards and the Possibility of Establishing the Right to Privacy and the Information Privacy Protection Legislation in Modern China''. Heidelberg: Springer, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This right to privacy has been the justification for decisions involving a wide range of [[civil liberties]] cases, including ''[[Pierce v. Society of Sisters]]'', which invalidated a successful 1922 [[Oregon]] [[initiative]] requiring compulsory [[state school|public education]], ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'', where a right to privacy was first established explicitly, ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', which struck down a [[Texas]] abortion law and thus restricted state powers to enforce laws against [[abortion]], and ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'', which struck down a Texas [[sodomy law]] and thus eliminated state powers to enforce laws against [[sodomy]].

The 1890 Warren and Brandeis article "The Right To Privacy" is often cited as the first implicit declaration of a U.S. right to privacy.&lt;ref name=Brandeis/&gt;  This right is frequently debated. [[Strict constructionism|Strict constructionists]]{{who|date=August 2013}} argue that  such right exists (or at least that the Supreme Court has more jurisdiction to protect such a right), while some civil libertarians{{who|date=August 2013}} argue that the right invalidates many types of currently allowed acts not to be [[surveillance]] ([[telephone tapping|wiretaps]], public cameras [[film industry]], etc.).

Most states of the United States {{who|date=January 2014}}also grant a right to privacy and recognize four [[tort]]s based on that right:
#Intrusion upon seclusion or solitude, or into private affairs;
#[[Public disclosure]] of embarrassing private facts;
#[[Publicity]] which places a person in a false light in the public eye; and
#[[Personality rights|Appropriation]] of name or likeness.

The four privacy torts above were introduced by [[William Lloyd Prosser|William Prosser]] in his ''California Law Review'' article titled "Privacy" in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=M.|first=Richards, Neil|last2=J.|first2=Solove, Daniel|date=2010|title=Prosser's Privacy Law: A Mixed Legacy|url=https://doi.org/10.15779/Z38541P|journal=California Law Review|language=en|volume=98|issue=6|doi=10.15779/z38541p}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that these torts, along with the "Right to Privacy"  article by Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis form the basis for modern U.S. privacy legislation.

Right to privacy and social media content laws have been considered and enacted in several states, such as California’s “online erasure” law protecting minors from leaving a digital trail. However, the United States is still far behind that of European Union countries in protecting privacy online. For example, the “right to be forgotten” ruling by the EU Court of Justice protects both adults and minors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zurbriggen|first1=Eileen L.|last2=Hagai|first2=Ella Ben|last3=Leon|first3=Gabrielle|title=Negotiating privacy and intimacy on social media: Review and recommendations.|journal=Translational Issues in Psychological Science|volume=2|issue=3|pages=248–260|doi=10.1037/tps0000078|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/tps0000078|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== India ===
A nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court headed by Chief Justice [[Jagdish Singh Khehar|JS Khehar]], ruled on August 24, 2017 that the Right to Privacy is a fundamental right for Indian citizens under the Constitution of India (mostly under Article 21 and additionally under Part III rights). Thus no legislation passed by the government can unduly violate it. Specifically, the court adopted the three-pronged test required for encroachment of any Article 21 right – legality-i.e. through an existing law; necessity, in terms of a legitimate state objective and proportionality, that ensures a rational nexus between the object of the invasion and the means adopted to achieve that object. This clarification was crucial to prevent the dilution of the right in the future on the whims and fancies of the government in power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thewire.in/170988/right-to-privacy-supreme-court-2/|title=For the Many and the Few: What a Fundamental Right to Privacy Means for India - The Wire|author=|date=|website=The Wire|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ruling by the Supreme Court paved the way for decriminalisation of homosexuality in India on 6 September 2018, thus legalising same-sex sexual intercourse between two consenting adults in private.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thequint.com/india/2017/08/24/supreme-court-verdict-right-to-privacy|title=Too Lazy to Read Right to Privacy Ruling?

The new data sharing policy of Whatsapp with Facebook after Facebook acquired Whatsapp in 2014 has been challenged in the Supreme Court.

== Journalism ==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
It is often claimed, particularly by those in the eye of the [[mass media|media]], that their right to privacy is violated when information about their private lives is reported in the press.  The point of view of the press, however, is that the general public have a right to know personal information about those with status as a [[public figure]].  This distinction is encoded in most legal traditions as an element of [[freedom of speech]].

==Mass surveillance and privacy==
{{further information|Global surveillance|Edward Snowden|Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)}}

Governmental organizations such as the NSA, CIA, and GCHQ amongst others conduct [[mass surveillance]] throughout [[Global surveillance|the world]]. Programs such as [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]], [[MYSTIC (surveillance program)|MYSTIC]], and other operations conducted by [[NATO]]-member states are capable of collecting a vast quantity of metadata, internet history, and even actual recordings of phone calls from various countries. The existence of programs is justified by their conductors in terms of supposed benefits for defense and law enforcement, however this is also in conflict with the right to privacy established under various treaties, constitutions, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The argument in favor of privacy has therefore come under a larger opposition to [[intelligence agency|intelligence operations]] carried out for political purposes, and has become a contentious issue since it undermines the perceived need of nations to spy on the general population in order to maintain their power structures.

==Support==
* The right to privacy is alluded to in the Fourth Amendment to the US Constitution, which states, "The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects,{{efn|Effects are items of property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Denniston|first1=Lyle|title=Argument preview: Police and cellphone privacy|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2014/04/argument-preview-police-and-cellphone-privacy/|publisher=SCOTUSblog|accessdate=July 1, 2014|date=April 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/bill_of_rights_transcript.html|title=America's Founding Documents|author=|date=30 October 2015|website=archives.gov|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The logical extension of the amendment to digital properties would make sense since if the internet had existed when it was written, digital documents would have been considered more important than the literal "papers" mentioned in the text.
* Privacy helps to avoid unwanted and potentially intrusive interference in an individual's personal affairs.
* Privacy is one of the rights that were absent in the society in [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''. Without privacy, there would be nothing to stop a [[Big Brother (1984 character)|Big Brother]]-like entity from taking control of every aspect of life.

==Opposition==
* In 1999, during a launch event for the [[Jini]] technology, [[Scott McNealy]], the chief executive officer of [[Sun Microsystems]], said that privacy issues were "a [[red herring]]" and then stated "You have zero privacy anyway. Get over it."&lt;ref&gt;Sprenger, Polly. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20170206072011/https://archive.wired.com/politics/law/news/1999/01/17538 Sun on Privacy: 'Get Over It']". ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''. January 26, 1999. Retrieved on Feb 6, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[nothing to hide argument]] states that government [[data mining]] and surveillance programs do not threaten privacy unless they uncover some illegal activities and those committing such activities do not have the right to keep them private. One who supports this argument may state, "I've got nothing to hide" thus, not opposing data mining and surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;Mordini, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=rncAXAFD1jcC&amp;pg=PA252&amp;dq=privacy+%22nothing+to+hide%22+argument#v=onepage&amp;q=privacy%20%22nothing%20to%20hide%22%20argument&amp;f=false 252].&lt;/ref&gt;
* In wake of the Snowden scandal, governments have claimed that there is an existential terrorist threat that overrides the so-called right to privacy.

The measures of the '''old Romanian system''' varied greatly not only between the three [[Romania|Romanian states]] ([[Wallachia]], [[Moldavia]], [[Transylvania]]), but sometimes also inside the same country. The origin of some of the measures are the Latin (such as [[Jugerum|''iug&amp;#259;r'']] unit), Slavic (such as ''vadră'' unit), Greek (such as ''dram'' unit) and Turkish (such as ''palmac'' unit) systems.

This system is no longer in wide use since the adoption of the metric system in 1864, however some rural communities still use a small subset of these units.

==Length==
* ''Palmă'' (palm) -  1/8 of a ''stânjen''
* ''Stânjen'' -  2 m (approximately)
* ''Palmac'' -  3.48&amp;nbsp;cm (Moldavia)
* ''Poştă'' -  8&amp;ndash;20&amp;nbsp;km (depending on the country)
* ''Pas mic'' (small step) -  4 ''palme'' (Wallachia) (palme is the plural noun for palmă)
* ''Pas mare'' (large step) -  6 ''palme'' (Wallachia; Moldavia)
* ''Lat de palmă'' (palm width) -  1/2 ''palmă''
* ''Cot'' (cubit) -  664&amp;nbsp;mm (Moldavia); 637&amp;nbsp;mm (Wallachia)
* ''Funie'' (rope) -  20&amp;ndash;120 m (depending on the place)
* ''Leghe'' (league) -  4.444&amp;nbsp;km; 
* ''Deget'' (finger) -  the width of a finger
* ''Prăjină'' -  3 ''stânjeni'' (stânjeni is the plural noun for stânjen)
* ''Verstă'' -  1067 m (3,500&amp;nbsp;ft)
* ''Picior'' (foot) -  1/6 of a ''stânjen''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3797">The '''Roy model''' is one of the earliest works in economics on [[Self-selection (labor economics)|self-selection]] due to [[A.D. Roy]]. The basic model considers two types of workers that choose occupation in one of two sectors. 

==Original model==
Roy's original paper deals with workers selecting into fishing and hunting professions, where there is no uncertainty about the amount of goods (fish or rabbits) that will be caught in a given period, but fishing is more costly as it requires more skill. The central question that Roy tries to answer in the original paper is whether the best hunters will hunt and the best fishermen will fish. While the discussion is non-mathematical, it is observed that choices will depend on the distribution of skills, the correlation between these skills in the population, and the technology available to use these skills.&lt;ref&gt;Roy, A. (1951): Some Thoughts on the Distribution of Earnings. Oxford Economic Papers 3(2), pp. 135-146.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further developments==
[[George Borjas]] was the first to formalize the model of Roy in a mathematical sense and apply it to self-selection in [[immigration]]. Specifically, assume source country 0 and destination country 1, with log earnings in a country ''i'' given by ''w&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;= a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; + e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', where ''e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;∼N(0, &lt;math&gt;s_i^2&lt;/math&gt; )''. Additionally, assume there is a cost ''C'' associated with migrating from country 0 to country 1 and workers know all parameters and their own realization of e&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and e&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Borjas then uses the implications of the Roy model to infer something about what wages for immigrants in country 1 would have been had they stayed in country 0 and what wages for non-immigrants in country 0 would have been had they migrated. The third, and final, element needed for this is the correlation between the wages in the two countries, ''ρ''. A worker will choose to immigrate if ''a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; - a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; - C + e&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; - e&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 0'' which will happen with probability 
''1 - Φ ( v )'' where ''v'' is &lt;math&gt; \frac {(a_{1} - a_{0}-{C})}{s_{v}} &lt;/math&gt; , ''s&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the standard deviation of ''e&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; – e&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', and  ''Φ'' is the standard normal cdf.&lt;ref&gt;	Borjas, G. J. (1987): Self-Selection and the Earnings of Immigrants. American Economic Review 77(4), pp. 531-553.&lt;/ref&gt;  This leads to the famous central result that the expected wage for immigrants depends on the selection mechanism, as shown in equation (1), where ''ϕ'' is the standard normal pdf and, like before, ''Φ'' is the standard normal cdf.

''E[w&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' |''Immigrate''] = a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; +ρs&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;  (\frac {\phi ({v})}{1-\phi ({v}) })	&lt;/math&gt;											(1)

While Borjas was the first to mathematically formalize the Roy model, it has guided thinking in other fields of research as well. A famous example by [[James Heckman]] and [[Bo Honoré]] who study [[labor market participation]] using the Roy model, where the choice equation leads to the [[Heckman correction]] procedure.&lt;ref&gt;	Heckman, J. J., Honoré, B. E. (1990): The Empirical Content of the Roy Model. Econometrica 58(5), pp. 1121-1149.&lt;/ref&gt;  More generally, Heckman and Vytlacil propose the Roy model as an alternative to the LATE framework proposed by Angrist and Imbens.&lt;ref&gt;	Heckman, J. J., Vytlacil, E. (2007): Econometric evaluation of social programs, part I: Causal models, structural models and econometric policy evaluation. Handbook of Econometrics, Vol. 6, ed. by J. J. Heckman, and E. E. Leamer. North Holland.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;	Imbens, G. W., Angrist, J. D. (1994): Identification and Estimation of Local Average Treatment Effects.

==Male adaptations==

===Harassment/aggression===

Harassment is a technique used by males of many species to force females to submit to mating.&lt;ref name="seven"&gt;Muller, M. N., Kahlenberg, S. M., Emery Thompson, M. &amp; Wrangham, R. W. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2141672/ Male coercion and the costs of promiscuous mating for female chimpanzees]. Proceedings: Biological Sciences 274, 1009–14 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; It has been observed in numerous species, including mammals, birds, insects and fish.&lt;ref name=four /&gt; Aggression and harassment have been documented in the males of [[Guppy|guppies]] (''Poecilia reticulata''),&lt;ref name=two /&gt; [[bottlenose dolphin]]s (''Tursiops aduncus''), [[boto]]s (''Inia geoffrensis''), [[dusky dolphin]]s (''Lagenorhynchus obscurus''), [[Hector's dolphin]]s (''Cephalorhynchus hectori''), [[grizzly bear]]s, [[polar bear]]s, and ungulates.&lt;ref name="eight"&gt;Fury, C. A., Ruckstuhl, K. E. &amp; Harrison, P. L. [http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0052987 Spatial and social sexual segregation patterns in indo-pacific bottlenose dolphins (''Tursiops aduncus'')]. PLoS ONE 8, e52987 (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; It is also seen in [[Chinook salmon]] (''Oncorhynchus tshawytscha''),&lt;ref name=four /&gt; red-spotted newts (''[[Notophthalmus]] viridescens''), and seed-eating true bugs (''[[Lygaeidae|Neacoryphus]]'' spp.).&lt;ref name="nine"&gt;Valero, A., Macías Garcia, C. &amp; Magurran, A. E. [http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/4/2/149.full Heterospecific harassment of native endangered fishes by invasive guppies in Mexico]. Biology letters 4, 149–52 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it is prevalent in [[spider monkey]]s,&lt;ref name="twenty eight" /&gt; wild [[Barbary macaque]]s (''Macaca sylvanus'') and many other primates.&lt;ref name="ten"&gt;McFarland, R. &amp; Majolo, B. [http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0026893 Grooming coercion and the post-conflict trading of social services in wild Barbary macaque] s. PLoS ONE 6, e26893 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

In basically all major primate taxa, aggression is used by the dominant males when herding females and keeping them away from other males.&lt;ref name="twenty eight" /&gt; In [[hamadryas baboon]]s, the males often bite the females’ necks and threaten them.&lt;ref name="eleven"&gt;Nitsch, F., Stueckle, S., Stahl, D. &amp; Zinner, D. [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10329-011-0258-2 Copulation patterns in captive hamadryas baboons: a quantitative analysis]. Primates; journal of primatology 52, 373–83 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Wild chimpanzees can charge at females, shake branches, hit, slap, kick, pound, drag, and bite them. Orangutans are among the most forceful of mammals. [[Bornean orangutan]]s (''Pongo pygmaeus'') exhibited aggression in almost 90 percent of their copulations, including when the females were not resisting.&lt;ref name="twelve"&gt;Knott, C. D., Emery Thompson, M., Stumpf, R. M. &amp; McIntyre, M. H. [http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/277/1678/105.full Female reproductive strategies in orangutans, evidence for female choice and counterstrategies to infanticide in a species with frequent sexual coercion]. Proceedings: Biological Sciences 277, 105–13 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; A possible explanation for aggressive behaviors in primates is that it is a way for males to train females to be afraid of them and be more likely to surrender to future sexual advances.&lt;ref name="twenty eight" /&gt;

===Intimidation===

Males may also use more indirect techniques to mate with females, such as [[intimidation]]. While most female water striders ([[Gerridae]]) have their genitalia exposed, females of the water strider species ''[[Gerris gracilicornis]]'' have evolved a shield over their genitals. As a result, males cannot physically coerce females because mating is difficult unless the female exposes her genitalia. Therefore, males intimidate females into mating by attracting predators; they tap on the water’s surface and create ripples that catch the attention of predatory fish. From there, it is in the best interest of the female to mate, and as quickly as possible, to avoid being eaten by predators. Typical mating positions of water striders have the females on the bottom, closer to predators, so the risk of predation is much higher for them. Females succumb to copulation to get males to cease signaling to predators.&lt;ref name="thirteen"&gt;Han, C. S. &amp; Jablonski, P. G. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2964456/ Male water striders attract predators to intimidate females into copulation]. Nature Communications 1, 52 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

Another indirect form of sexual coercion occurs in red-sided garter snakes, ''[[Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis]]''. When males "court" females, they line their bodies up to the females' and produce caudocephalic waves, which are a series of muscle contractions that travel through their bodies from tail to head. The exact reason for this behavior is unknown, but some studies show that it relates to stress. Females have nonrespiratory air sacs containing anoxic air, and the waving pushes this air into her lungs. The resulting stress causes her cloaca to open, and aids the male in inserting his [[hemipenis]]. The stronger and more frequent the caudocephalic waves and the closer the male’s cloaca to the female’s, the more likely the male is to mate successfully.&lt;ref name="fourteen"&gt;Shine, R., Langkilde, T. &amp; Mason, R. T. [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Richard_Shine/publication/222434765_Courtship_tactics_in_garter_snakes_How_do_a_male's_morphology_and_behaviour_influence_his_mating_success/links/0fcfd4fc46ad6dfdfc000000.pdf Courtship tactics in garter snakes: how do a male’s morphology and behaviour influence his mating success?] Animal Behaviour 67, 477–483 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grasping and grappling{{anchor|Grasping.2FGrappling}}===
{{see also|Sexual conflict#Grasping}}
Males of certain species have evolved mating behaviors in which they forcefully attempt to mate with and inseminate females, often employing grasping techniques. These male grasping devices exist to increase the duration of copulation and restrict females from mating with other males. They are in some ways a form of [[mate guarding]]. While some males have evolved different types of modifications to aid in grasping, others just grab females and attempt to force copulation.

One type of grasping modification is [[Sexual conflict#Spiky genitals|spiny male genitalia]]. In [[seed beetle]]s (Coleoptera: Bruchidae), males possess sclerotized spines on their genitalia. These spines are used during copulation to help overcome female resistance and penetrate into their copulatory duct. In addition to aiding penetration, these spines promote the passage of seminal fluids, and act as an anchor to keep the female from fleeing. Furthermore, spiny genitals can injure the females and make them less likely to remate.&lt;ref name=six /&gt; [[Sepsidae]] fly males have modifications on their forelegs to help them grasp onto female wing bases. These modifications include cuticular outgrowths, indentations, and bristles, and males use them to secure themselves onto females after jumping on them. Once the males grab on, a struggle ensues akin to a [[rodeo]], where males try to hold on while females violently shake them off.&lt;ref name=five /&gt;

Another type of modification is found in male diving beetles (of the family Dytiscidae), who are equipped with suction cup structures on their front legs. They use these to grab passing females and attach to their dorsal surfaces. To get the females to submit, males shake the females violently and keep them submerged underwater (diving beetles cannot go long without atmospheric oxygen). Unable to get air, female diving beetles submit to the male’s advances in order to avoid drowning (and they lose the energy to resist). Once the males attach, copulation can occur.&lt;ref name="fifteen"&gt;Bergsten, J. &amp; Miller, K. B. [http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0000522 Phylogeny of diving beetles reveals a coevolutionary arms race between the sexes]. PLoS ONE 2, e522 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

Male waterfowl have developed another modification; while most male birds have no external genitalia, male waterfowl (Aves: [[Anatidae]]) have a phallus (length {{convert|1.5|-|4.0|cm|in|disp=x| [|]}}). Most birds mate with the males balancing on top of the females and touching cloacas in a “cloacal kiss”; this makes forceful insemination very difficult. The phallus that male waterfowl have evolved everts out of their bodies (in a clockwise coil) and aids in inseminating females without their cooperation.&lt;ref name="sixteen"&gt;Brennan, P. L. R. et al. [http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0000418 Coevolution of male and female genital morphology in waterfowl]. PLoS ONE 2, e418 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

Another such technique is having a "lock-like" mechanism, found in ''[[Drosophila montana]]'', dogs, wolves, and pigs. Towards the end of copulation, females struggle to try to dislodge the males, whose genital organs take much longer to deflate than females do; the locking (most commonly known in [[canid]]s as a "tie") allows the males to copulate for as long as they need to until they are finished. In dogs, the male has [[bulbus glandis|a knot in his penis]] that gets engorged with blood and ties the female, locking them together during copulation, until the act is complete. Male dogs have evolved this mechanism during mating in order to prevent other males from penetration whilst they are and the use of the tie enables them to be more likely to inseminate the female and produce a healthy litter of pups. Breaking this "tie" can be physically harmful to both females and males.&lt;ref name="seventeen"&gt;Mazzi, D., Kesäniemi, J., Hoikkala, A. &amp; Klappert, K. [https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2148-9-132 Sexual conflict over the duration of copulation in Drosophila montana: why is longer better?] BMC Evolutionary Biology 9, 132 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Males of many species simply grab the females and force a mating. Coercive mating is very common in water striders ([[Gerridae]]) because in most of the species, the female genitalia are often exposed and easily accessible to males.&lt;ref name=one /&gt; Without any courtship behavior, males initiate by forcefully trying to mount the females. Carrying the males on their backs is energetically costly to females, so they try to resist and throw off the males. The males fight back even harder and use their forelegs to tightly grasp the female’s thorax and keep them from escaping.&lt;ref name="eighteen"&gt;Han, C. S., Jablonski, P. G., Kim, B. &amp; Park, F. C. [https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2148-10-359 Size-assortative mating and sexual size dimorphism are predictable from simple mechanics of mate-grasping behavior]. BMC Evolutionary Biology 10, 359 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; The males then forcefully insert their genitalia into the female vulvar opening.&lt;ref name=one /&gt; In the newt species ''[[Notophthalmus viridescens]]'', males carry out a courtship behavior called [[amplexus]]. It consists of males capturing females that do not want to mate with them and using their hind limbs to grasp the females by their pectoral regions.&lt;ref name=three /&gt;

Male guppies (''[[Poecilia reticulata]]'') have been observed to forcefully copulate with females by trying to insert their [[gonopodium]] (male sex organ) into female’s genital pores, whether or not they are accepting.&lt;ref name=four /&gt; Sometimes, male guppies also try to forcefully mate with ''[[Skiffia bilineata]]'' (goodeid) females, which resemble guppy females and tend to share the same habitat, even when guppy females are available. A possible explanation for this is the deeper genital cavity of ''S. bilineata'', which stimulates the males more than when mating with guppy females.&lt;ref name=nine /&gt;

Males of some species are able to immobilize females and force copulation. In pigs and boars, males grab females and maneuver the pelvis to lift the vaginal opening and facilitate copulation. The stimulation following intromission causes the female to be immobilized. The male can then freely continue copulation without worrying about the female escaping.&lt;ref name="nineteen"&gt;Zehr, J. L. NIH Public Access. 41, 101–112 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Immobilization of the female also occurs in [[muscovy duck]]s.

Grasping and/or grappling mating situations have also been documented in ''[[Calopteryx haemorrhoidalis]] haemorrhoidalis'' ([[Odonata]]),&lt;ref name="twenty"&gt;Rivera, a C. &amp; Andrés, J. a [https://academic.oup.com/jinsectscience/article/2/1/14/863639 Male coercion and convenience polyandry in a calopterygid damselfly].

===Infanticide===
{{Main|Infanticide (zoology)}}
In some mammal species, mostly nonhuman primates,{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} it is common for males to commit infanticide to mate with females. This happens often in species that live in groups, such as Old and New World monkeys, apes, prosimians, and hamadryas baboons.&lt;ref name="twenty three"/&gt; There is usually a single breeding male in a group, and when an outside male aggressively takes over, he kills off all of the young offspring. The males kill infants that are not their own to assert their strength and position, and mate with the females.&lt;ref name="twenty eight" /&gt;  Sometimes, multiple males will invade a troop and gang up on females, killing their offspring and subsequently mating with them. This occurs in [[spider monkey]]s, red-backed [[squirrel monkey]]s, chimpanzees, and [[red howler (disambiguation)|red howler]]s.&lt;ref name="twenty eight" /&gt;

===Secretions===

In the newt species ''[[Notophthalmus viridescens]]'', the males rub off hormonal secretions onto the skin of the females they are courting. These hormones have been shown to make the female more receptive to mating with the male. When the male deposits the secretions, he detaches from the female and releases a spermatophore (containing spermatozoa). It is then the female’s decision to either accept it and pick it up or reject it by running away; these hormones make her more likely to accept it.&lt;ref name=three /&gt;

===Coercive faithfulness===

====Post-copulatory guarding====

Another form of coercion is male mate guarding, used to keep females from mating with other males, and often involves aggression.&lt;ref name=seven /&gt; Guarding allows the males to assure their paternity. A classic example occurs in diving beetles, family Dytiscidae. After copulation, males continue to guard females for up to six hours. They hold them underwater, occasionally tilting them up for air.&lt;ref name=fifteen /&gt;  Guarding also occurs in water striders where, once males complete their sperm transfer, they often remain on top of the females. This guarding duration varies, lasting from several minutes to several weeks. The purpose of such long guarding periods is for the males to see the females lay their eggs and be assured that the offspring are theirs.&lt;ref name=eighteen /&gt;  This behavior also occurs in hamadryas baboons (''Papio hamadryas''), where the leader males practice intensive mate guarding.&lt;ref name="twenty three" /&gt;  In ''Drosophila'' Montana, studies have shown that following mate guarding, the chances of a female mating with or being inseminated by another male were greatly diminished. This shows that the mate guarding tactic can be very effective.&lt;ref name=seventeen /&gt;

====Secretions/ejaculations====

Males of some species use bodily fluids, such as seminal fluid from their ejaculate, to aid in the coercion of females. Seminal fluid in males of Drosophila melanogaster may contain chemicals that increase the amount of time it takes for females to remate, decrease the length of successive matings, or keep her from remating at all. The less a female mates with other males after copulation with a male, the more likely it is for him to ensure his paternity. These chemicals may also serve to increase the female’s reproductive success, but at the cost of decreased longevity and immune response.&lt;ref name=seventeen /&gt;

In many species, seminal fluid can be used as a sort of mating plug. Males of these species transfer their sperm at the beginning of copulation and use the rest of copulation to transfer substances that help build up the mating plugs. These plugs are effective in ensuring that the female does not mate with any other males and that the male’s paternity is secured.&lt;ref name=seventeen /&gt;

==Costs to females==

===Direct===

A major direct cost of sexual coercion is physical injury.&lt;ref name=four /&gt; Male seed beetles (Coleoptera: Bruchidae) have sclerotized spine on their genitalia, which penetrate the female and leave melanized scars. Females can be physically injured from just one mating, and the more a female mates, the more scarring forms in the copulatory duct.&lt;ref name=six /&gt; In guppies, the male’s gonopodium can cause damage when forcefully inserted, causing cloacal damage to the females.&lt;ref name=nine /&gt; In fowl, females can be physically injured during forceful copulations. Also, semen transferred from the males can contain pathogens and fecal matter, which can lead to disease and decrease female fitness.&lt;ref name="twenty one" /&gt; In elephant seals, physical injury happens very often. In fact, mating leads to 1 in every 1,000 female elephant seals getting killed.&lt;ref name=nineteen /&gt; Other species in which the females (and/or their offspring) are injured or even killed include lions, rodents, farm cats, crabeater seals, elephant seals, sea lions,&lt;ref name="twenty eight" /&gt; wild Trinidadian guppies (''Poecilia reticulata''),&lt;ref name=eight /&gt; red-sided garter snakes (''Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis''),&lt;ref name=fourteen /&gt; and newts (''N. viridescens'').&lt;ref name=three /&gt;

Another cost is the excess energy and time expenditure that comes with mating. For example, female water striders, Gerridae,&lt;ref name=eighteen /&gt;  and marine snails of the genus ''Littorina'' 24 have to carry the males on their backs while they mate. First of all, this is a great loss of energy.&lt;ref name=eighteen /&gt; Second, both the male and the female are at a much greater risk of predation in this position.&lt;ref name=four /&gt; Furthermore, the time spent mating interferes with the time that could have been spent foraging&lt;ref name=four /&gt;  and feeding.&lt;ref name="twenty five"&gt;Darden, S. K., James, R., Ramnarine, I. W. &amp; Croft, D. P. [http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2009/04/20/rspb.2009.0087.full Social implications of the battle of the sexes: sexual harassment disrupts female sociality and social recognition]. Proceedings: Biological Sciences 276, 2651–6 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, sexual coercion can lower body condition and immunity in ways other than physical damage. Harassment can lead to stress, which can result in weight loss, decreased immune function and energy stores, and less feeding, which has been seen in red-spotted newts.&lt;ref name=three /&gt; Furthermore, when females are constantly moving around to avoid violent males, they are not able to form female social ties (for example, [[Grévy's zebra]]/Equus grevyi).&lt;ref name="twenty five" /&gt; This also happens in species where herding males sometimes do not permit females to join their family in different groups, like in hamadryas baboons.&lt;ref name="twenty eight" /&gt;

===Indirect===

Indirect costs are those that affect females in the future. One such cost happens because sexual coercion does not allow females to choose the males they want to mate with, which are usually males that are higher quality, compatible, and/or have good genes that will increase their offspring’s survival and fitness. Coercion decreases this choice and can lead to their offspring having lower genetic quality. Studies of the rose bitterling (Rhodeus ocellatus), have shown that offspring of females with mate choice had higher survival rates than offspring of females that did not.&lt;ref name=four /&gt; Another ultimate cost comes from when males commit infanticide to obtain mating access. This loss of offspring leads to a decrease in fitness of females.&lt;ref name="twenty eight" /&gt;

==Female counter-adaptations==

===Anatomical protection===

As a response to sexual coercion and the costs that females face, one of their counter-adaptations is the evolution of anatomical protection.&lt;ref name=one /&gt; Females of some species, such as the water striders, developed morphological shields to protect their genitalia from males that want to forcefully copulate.&lt;ref name=thirteen /&gt; Some Gerridae females have also evolved abdominal spines and altered the shapes of their abdomens to make them less accessible to males.&lt;ref name=one /&gt;

Waterfowl males of the family Aves: Anatidae [[Bird penis|have evolved a phallus]] to aid in coercion. This phallus everts out of the male body (when it’s time to mate) in a counter-clockwise coil. As a response, females have developed vaginal structures called dead end sacs and clockwise coils to protect themselves from forceful intromission.&lt;ref name=sixteen /&gt; Waterfowl females have evolved these “convoluted vaginal morphologies” to make it harder for males to insert themselves without the female’s consent.&lt;ref name="twenty six"&gt;Brennan, P. L. R., Clark, C. J. &amp; Prum, R. O. [http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2009/12/18/rspb.2009.2139.full.html Explosive eversion and functional morphology of the duck penis supports sexual conflict in waterfowl genitalia]. Proceedings: Biological Sciences 277, 1309–14 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Male avoidance/habitat change===

Another female tactic to counter coercion is to try to avoid males that may cause them harm. To do this, females often change their habitats to get away from aggressive males, as is seen in wild Trinidadian guppies (''[[Poecilia reticulata]]'').&lt;ref name=eight /&gt; Female bottlenose dolphins behave in similar ways by moving into shallow waters where there are not too many males.&lt;ref name=eight /&gt; Other species that practice mate avoidance are ''[[Calopteryx haemorrhoidalis]]'', a species of damselfly, who often try to hide from large groups of males to avoid harassment.&lt;ref name=twenty /&gt;

Females of the marine intertidal periwinkle species (genus ''[[Littorina]]'') have another way to avoid males. Males usually recognize female snails by cues in their mucous trails. However, females try to mask their gender by altering these cues.&lt;ref name="twenty four"&gt;Johannesson, K., Saltin, S. H., Duranovic, I., Havenhand, J. N. &amp; Jonsson, P. R. [http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0012005 Indiscriminate males: mating behaviour of a marine snail compromised by a sexual conflict?] PLoS ONE 5, e12005 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; In damselflies, females also try to mask their gender by mimicking male colors, which make them less attractive to males.&lt;ref name="twenty four" /&gt;

===Protection/alliances===

An effective female strategy is the employment of protection and alliances. Some females, such as wild Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulate) associate themselves with protective males who come to their rescue.&lt;ref name="twenty seven"&gt;Darden, S. K. &amp; Croft, D. P. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2610095/ Male harassment drives females to alter habitat use and leads to segregation of the sexes]. Biology letters 4, 449–51 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; This also occurs in hamadryas, savanna, and olive baboons, where males and females form friendships where the female gets male protection.&lt;ref name="twenty three" /&gt; In [[northern elephant seal]]s, the females give loud cries when mounted by undesirable or subordinate males, which attract dominant males to help. A similar phenomenon occurs in elephants, bighorn sheep, and fallow deer, where the females stay close to dominant males for protection.&lt;ref name="twenty eight" /&gt;

Females can also form alliances with other females for protection against aggressive males.&lt;ref name="twenty eight" /&gt; In African vervet monkeys, related females often form groups and “gang up” on males. Females of high rank create networks of female alliances; together, they fight away persistent suitors.&lt;ref name="twenty eight" /&gt;

===Resistance/fighting back===

Resisting males and fighting back are important tactics some species use to counter male coercion. Many females try to vigorously shake off males to dislodge them and flee; this is seen in females sepsid flies&lt;ref name=five /&gt;  and diving beetles.&lt;ref name=fifteen /&gt; Sepsids also try to bend their abdomen in such a way that males cannot copulate forcefully.&lt;ref name=five /&gt; Females are especially likely to fight back when they are protecting their offspring. This is seen in mountain gorillas, red howlers, and grey langur females, where males are often infanticidal.&lt;ref name="twenty eight" /&gt;

Female resistance has rarely been found to be effective. Male mammals and birds are usually larger than females, and the sheer size and strength difference makes this very difficult.&lt;ref name="twenty eight" /&gt; However, it has been observed in some species, such as squirrel monkeys, patas monkeys, vervets, and captive chimpanzees, that females can “gang up” on males when they are being aggressive. They will even try to protect a female in distress. Females have even been observed to kill immigrant males in wild red colobus monkeys.&lt;ref name="twenty eight" /&gt;

===Acceptance/submission===

Sometimes, females choose not to struggle and simply acquiesce to forceful matings. This can happen when they decide that the cost of resisting would be greater than the cost of mating.&lt;ref name=twenty /&gt; They use submission to avoid further harassment or aggression, which could end in death or injury.&lt;ref name="twenty five" /&gt; This is often seen in primate species, such as chimpanzees and hamadryas baboons.&lt;ref name="twenty eight" /&gt;

==Female benefits==

Some possible benefits of sexual coercion for females have been hypothesized.

===Proximate===

A possible proximate benefit for females is that sometimes after a male mates with a female, he becomes her mate. Then, he would defend and protect her.&lt;ref name=twenty /&gt; This is seen in many primate species.&lt;ref name="twenty eight" /&gt;

===Ultimate===

A possible benefit of sexual coercion that would come out in the long run is the “good genes” hypothesis.&lt;ref name=fifteen /&gt; If males can overcome a female’s resistance, then they must possess good genes that would increase the survival, mating success, and ultimately the fitness of her offspring. The hypothesis is that females can use the sexual coercion process to assess the quality of a male.&lt;ref name=one /&gt;

==Consequences==

===Coevolutionary arms race===

Sexual coercion often leads to an intersexual coevolutionary arms race. This consists of females evolving adaptations to male advances and males evolving counter-adaptations as a response.&lt;ref name=two /&gt; Males persist in violent behavior, which favors the evolution of female resistance to defend themselves.&lt;ref name=one /&gt;&lt;ref name=six /&gt; In organisms where males have genitalia harmful to females, such as in certain insects, females tend to evolve thicker, less sensitive copulatory tracts.&lt;ref name=six /&gt; Also, they may evolve shield over their genital openings to prevent intromission.&lt;ref name=thirteen /&gt; Females of some species of water striders have evolved protection from forceful insemination, such as abdominal spines and downward-bent abdomens to make it harder for males to mate. In response, however, males have counter evolved, also changing the shape of their abdomens to those that would facilitate forceful mating.&lt;ref name=one /&gt;

The male waterfowl (Aves: Anatidae) evolution of a phallus to forcefully copulate with females has led to counteradaptations in females in the form of vaginal structures called dead end sacs and clockwise coils. These structures make it harder for males to achieve intromission. The clockwise coils are significant because the male phallus everts out of their body in a counter-clockwise spiral; therefore, a clockwise vaginal structure would impede forceful copulation. Studies have shown that the longer a male’s phallus is, the more elaborate the vaginal structures were.&lt;ref name=sixteen /&gt;

===Speciation===

Speciation has been observed to be a possible consequence of sexual coercion. In diving beetle species family [[Dytiscidae]], an intersexual arms race occurs between males and females. Males have evolved suction cup structures on their forelegs to help grasp females; females have counter-evolved setose dorsal furrows to impede forceful copulation. This continuous evolution (in both the forward and reverse directions) has led to the recent speciation of ''A. japonicus'' and ''A. kishii'', where females of ''A. kishii'' have lost their dorsal furrows while those of ''A. japonicus'' have not.&lt;ref name=fifteen /&gt;

===Sexual dimorphism===

Sexual coercion can lead to sexual dimorphisms, in which males and females have significant morphological differences. For example, in some species, larger males are more successful in forcefully mating/insemination, leading to a higher fitness.&lt;ref name=two /&gt; In [[common garter snake|red-sided garter snake]]s, ''Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis'', it has been shown that heavier-bodied males were better courters and their size gave them an advantage over smaller bodied snakes.&lt;ref name=fourteen /&gt; This helps lead to an evolution of sexual dimorphism, with males larger than females.&lt;ref name=two /&gt; In other species, males that are smaller than females have higher fitness. Basically, many sex-specific morphological adaptations (for example, in Dytiscidae diving beetles, females have setose dorsal furrows that males do not and males have suction cups on their forelegs that females do not&lt;ref name=fifteen /&gt;) are sexual dimorphisms caused by sexual coercion.

==Psychology==
In "The Art of Roughhousing," Anthony DeBenedet and Larry Cohen argue that "wild play" between a child and a parent can foster "joy, love and a deeper connection"; among the actions they suggest is for the parent to be silly and pretend to fall over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-08-17/health/sc-health-0817-child-health-roughhous20110817_1_light-touch-physical-fitness-freeze |title=The benefits of horseplay - Chicago Tribune |publisher=Articles.chicagotribune.com |date=2011-08-17 |accessdate=2013-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Christianson from New York’s Big Apple Circus "became so interested in the healing qualities of physical comedy that he quit his job"..."to teach [[jester]]s, clowns and [[comedian]]s how to connect with hospital patients through his Clown Care Unit."&lt;ref name="alexthejester1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alexthejester.com/html/historyPopup.html |title=Brief History of the Jester |publisher=Alexthejester.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; A doctor named [[Patch Adams]] "...leads a merry band of mirth makers on trips around the world to locations of crisis or suffering in order to serve up some levity and healing."&lt;ref name="alexthejester1"/&gt;


In the US and Mexico, the US practical joke group Improv Everywhere has created an 'international celebration of silliness' by asking commuters to board the New York and Mexico City subways without trousers on a specific day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/jan/14/no-pants-subway-day-video |title=No Pants Subway Ride celebrates silliness - video &amp;#124; World news &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date= 2013-01-14|accessdate=2013-07-06 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the circus==

[[File:Clown chili peppers.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|A clown with "happy face" painting]]
In the [[circus]], one of the roles that [[clown]]s play is engaging in silliness. When clowning is taught, the different components of silliness include "funny ways of speaking to make people laugh," making "silly face[s] and sound[s]," engaging in "funny ways of moving, and play[ing] with extreme emotions such as "pretending to laugh and cry." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jimdalling.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=50:clown-activities-structured-silliness&amp;catid=18:teachers-resources&amp;Itemid=59 |title=Jim Dalling |publisher=Jimdalling.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, the [[Northern Arts and Cultural Centre]] held a Children's Festival of Silliness in January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naccnt.ca/events/421/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130706012355/http://www.naccnt.ca/events/421/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-07-06 |title=Northern Arts and Cultural Centre: NACC 1st Annual Children's Festival of Silliness! |publisher=Naccnt.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''supersoldier''' (or '''super soldier''') is a concept [[soldier]], often fictional, capable of operating beyond normal human limits or abilities. 

==Overview==
Supersoldiers are common in [[science fiction]] literature, films and video games. In 2012, [[DARPA]] was reported to be developing an externally powered [[Sarcos#Powered exoskeleton|XOS exoskeleton]] design for greatly increased strength and endurance.&lt;ref name="Daily Mail"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2187276/U-S-Army-Soldiers-able-run-Olympic-speed-wont-need-food-sleep-gene-technology.html | title=Army of the future | publisher=The Daily Mail online | date=12 August 2012 | accessdate=4 August 2013 | author=Damien Gayle | deadurl=bot: unknown | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130804180543/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2187276/U-S-Army-Soldiers-able-run-Olympic-speed-wont-need-food-sleep-gene-technology.html | archivedate=4 August 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fictional supersoldiers are usually heavily [[Human enhancement|augmented]], either through [[eugenics]], [[genetic engineering]], [[cybernetics|cybernetic]] implants, [[medication|drugs]], [[brainwashing]], [[Psychological trauma|traumatic]] events, an extreme training regimen or other scientific and [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] means. Occasionally, some instances also use [[paranormal]] methods, such as [[black magic]] or technology and science of [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] origin. In entertainment, the creators of such programs are viewed often as [[mad scientist]]s or stern [[military personnel]] depending on the emphasis, as their programs would typically go past [[ethics|ethical]] boundaries in the pursuit of science or military might.

==Cyborg soldier==
Some fictional supersoldiers can also be categorized as [[cyborg|cyborgs]] or [[cybernetic]] [[organism|organisms]] because of augmentations that are intended to enhance human capabilities or to exceed physical human restrictions.&lt;ref name = Footnote&gt;{{cite web|url=http://footnote1.com/robots-soldiers-cyborgs-the-future-of-warfare/ | title = The Cyborgization of Human Soldiers | publisher = Footnote1 | date =24 October 2013 | accessdate = 1 May 2015 | author = Armin Krishnan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''[[The Men Who Stare at Goats]]'' (2004), Welsh journalist [[Jon Ronson]] documented how the U.S. military repeatedly tried and failed to train soldiers in the use of parascientific combat techniques during the Cold War,&lt;ref name="Adams"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2004/nov/21/politics | title=Acting the giddy goat. | publisher=Guardian News | work=Book review | date=21 November 2004 | accessdate=5 August 2013 | author=Tim Adams | quote=''The Men Who Stare at Goats'' by Jon Ronson, Picador, pp.240.}}&lt;/ref&gt; experimenting with New Age tactics and [[psychic]] phenomena such as remote viewing, astral projections, "death touch" and mind reading against various Soviet targets.  The book inspired also a [[The Men Who Stare at Goats (film)|war comedy of the same name]] (2009) directed by [[Grant Heslov]], starring [[George Clooney]].&lt;ref name="Heussner"&gt;{{cite web|last=Heussner|first=Ki Mae|title=Psychic Spies: Any Truth in 'Men Who Stare at Goats?'|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/psychic-spies-truth-men-stare-goats/story?id=9032019#.UeHh31V7P2E|publisher=ABCnews.com|accessdate=13 July 2013|date=Nov 9, 2009|quote={{cite book|last=Ronson|first=Jon|authorlink1=Jon Ronson|work=The Men Who Stare at Goats|year=2009|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=978-1439181775}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5340">[[File:Symboles soudure V.svg|thumb|right|The symbolic representation of a V weld of chamfered plates in a technical drawing]]
The '''symbols and conventions used in [[welding]] documentation''' are specified in national and international standards such as [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 2553 ''Welded, brazed and soldered joints -- Symbolic representation on drawings'' and ISO 4063 ''Welding and allied processes -- Nomenclature of processes and reference numbers''. The US standard symbols are outlined by the [[American National Standards Institute]] and the [[American Welding Society]] and are noted as "ANSI/AWS".&lt;ref name=greg&gt;{{cite book|author1=E. N. Gregory|author2=Ann A. Armstrong|title=Welding symbols on drawings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X9cxdD6GfdIC&amp;pg=PR7|accessdate=10 October 2011|date=20 April 2005|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8493-3591-4|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due in part to the growth of the oil industry, this symbol set was used during the 1990s in about 50% of the world's welding operations.&lt;ref name=greg/&gt; An ISO committee sought to establish a global standard during this decade.&lt;ref name=greg/&gt;

In [[engineering drawing]]s, each weld is conventionally identified by an arrow which points to the joint to be welded.  The arrow is annotated with letters, numbers and symbols which indicate the exact specification of the weld. In complex applications, such as those involving [[alloy]]s other than [[Carbon steel|mild steel]], more information may be called for than can comfortably be indicated using the symbols alone.&lt;ref name=greg/&gt; Annotations are used in these cases.&lt;ref name=greg/&gt;

==Component elements==
[[File:Elements of a welding symbol.PNG|thumb|right|350px|The location of the elements of a welding symbol when following US conventions.]]
In the US, the component elements of the weld specification are:&lt;ref name=TC9237&gt;{{citation |title=Welding Theory and Application |publisher=Department of the Army |date=7 May 1993 |number=Training Circular 9-237 |url=https://armypubs.us.army.mil/doctrine/DR_pubs/dr_aa/pdf/tc9_237.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The reference line - the body of the arrow which is the baseline for the specification.
# The arrow tip which goes at an angle to the reference line, pointing to the joint to be welded.
# The tail which goes at the other end of the reference line.
# The basic welding symbol which goes on the reference line to indicate the shape of the weld such as a fillet or plug.  The symbol is placed on the arrow side or other side of the line to indicate which side of the joint the weld goes.
# The dimensions and other numbers such as the length of the weld or number of spot welds go above and below the reference line.
# Supplementary symbols go at the junction of the reference line and the arrow tip.  One  such symbol is a circle to indicate an all-around weld, which goes on every side of the joint.
# Finish symbols go above the reference line to indicate the surface contour or finish of the weld such as flush, convex or concave.
# Letters indicating the welding process are placed at the tail end, such as AHW for [[atomic hydrogen welding]].  Further examples include:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10943">'''Systemic development''' is a process of thinking about development which uses a [[systems thinking]] approach to create a solution to a social, environmental, and economic stress which the world is suffering from.

== Overview ==
[[File:Sustainable development.svg|thumb|Development can be a combination of multiple disciplines. Sustainable development focuses on a balance of environmental, economic, and social.]]
The core approach of systemic development is a process for thinking holistically while addressing complex issues and progressing towards a mutual goal with high participation rates.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The process encompasses comprehension of current activities and future needs from a holistic perspective. For success, it is essential that the process moves from an integrated assessment to a sustainable assessment. The perspective must consider the many facets of the current and proposed development including the economic, social, environmental, political and ecological aspects. The idea behind a systemic development approach can be applied to many disciplines, similar to [[sustainable development]]. Systemic development is practice rather than [[sustainability]], which is an end state.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
[[Systems theory|General Systems Theory]] (GST) laid the foundation to systemic thinking. [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy|Ludwig Von Bertalanffy]] was known as the founder of the original principles of GST.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Cruz, Ivonne, Andri Stahel, and Manfred Max-Neef. "Towards a Systemic Development Approach: Building on the Human-Scale Development Paradigm." ''Ecological Economics'' 68.7 (2009): 2021-030. ''Elsevier''. Web. 20 Apr. 2017. &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2009.02.004&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to 1968, when GST was introduced in Bertalanffy’s book, ''General System Theory: Foundations, Development, Applications'', the traditional approach to development used linear thinking or cause-and-effect thinking. GST was influenced by many different types of theories such as “Chaos theory, complexity theory, catastrophe theory, cybernetics, fuzzy set theory, and learning matrices” &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spruill|first=Nina|last2=Kenney|first2=Con|last3=Kaplan|first3=Laura|date=2001-03-01|title=Community Development and Systems Thinking: Theory and Practice|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ncr.90110/abstract|journal=National Civic Review|language=en|volume=90|issue=1|pages=105–116|doi=10.1002/ncr.90110|issn=1542-7811}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1990, [[Peter Senge]], author of ''[[The Fifth Discipline]]'', wove systemic thinking approach into development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Concepts ==
The integration of ontology, methodology, epistemology, and axiology has formed an outline for GST. Together, these concepts and philosophies contribute to the theory of systemic development.&lt;ref&gt;Sedlacko, Michal, Andre Martinuzzi, Inge RÃ¸pke, Nuno Videira, and Paula Antunes. "Participatory Systems Mapping for Sustainable Consumption: Discussion of a Method Promoting Systemic Insights." ''Ecological Economics'' 106 (2014): 33-43. ''Elsevier''. Web. 05 Mar. 2017. &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0921800914002043/1-s2.0-S0921800914002043-main.pdf?_tid=9d75173e-4500-11e7-b416-00000aacb361&amp;acdnat=1496125640_f44c0f82766115a9b6be398ef056d52f&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ontological ===
[[Ontology]] is the most basic fundamental tool. In a systemic development approach, the first step is to define the boundaries, thresholds, and stakeholders.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Sala, Serenella, Biagio Ciuffo, and Peter Nijkamp. "A Systemic Framework for Sustainability Assessment." ''Ecological Economics'' 119 (2015): 314-25. ''Elsevier''. Web. 05 Mar. 2017. &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0921800915003821/1-s2.0-S0921800915003821-main.pdf?_tid=24da3502-4500-11e7-951c-00000aacb35d&amp;acdnat=1496125438_401becd0b4afcc87524ef4bc3b8de9af&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  Understanding what is, is crucial to understand the layers of complexity of the development needs.

=== Methodological ===
[[Methodology]] in systemic development must consider all variables, values, and sustainability principles, and aim to ensure that no elements have been neglected. It is important to ensure completeness, comprehensiveness, and transparency of the assessment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Mutual feedback and interactions between stakeholders should be modeled and assessed using carefully designed specific methodologies.

=== Epistemological ===
[[Epistemology]] stresses how dialogue and communication by the stakeholders are the key tools to systemic development. This is when the verification and confirmation of the facets of the development process are discovered. Insight from each stakeholder is important to enhance and broaden the perspective of all involved. It is essential to take these viewpoints into consideration because they influence the process, the trends, the drivers of change, and the interactions between the parts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is during this phase that learning is accomplished.

=== Axiological ===
Axiologology emphasizes the ethical and aesthetic responsibility during the development process. It is important because the solution manifested by the systemic development process needs to represent the values of the represented stakeholders.

==Framework ==
=== Holistic Thinking ===
To successfully achieve development through a [[systems approach]], holistic thinking is necessary. A holistic approach to a system thinks about each variable, the space between the variables and what defines the variable. “It’s the sum of the interaction of its parts”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In this process each individual must learn from each other to understand the whole system in a [[multidimensional]] way to find a solution. To think about development with a systemic lens, one needs to be able to see the whole instead of parts and understand the relationship between the parts, the way the parts move, what drives the behavior of the parts, what influences the flow or direction, and to understand why there are no more or no fewer parts.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Flander, Katleen De, and Jeb Brugmann. "Pressure-Point Strategy: Leverages for Urban Systemic Transformation." ''Sustainability'' 9.1 (2017): 99. ''Sustainability''. Web. 15 May 2017. &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/9/1/99&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The many factors that make up the whole can be a complex system.

=== Stakeholders ===
Including many diverse stakeholders helps each individual to grow their own perspective, gain an understanding of others and to increase their creativity. Systemic involvement must strive for a [[Transdisciplinarity|transdisciplinary]] approach instead of a [[Multidisciplinary approach|multidisciplinary]] or [[interdisciplinary]] approach to achieve successful development.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Transdisciplinary allows for the integration of methodologies and epistemologies through collaboration of the different stakeholders. Including more perspectives in the loop will increase the chance of a successful solution.

=== Communication and Learning ===
The foundation of systemic development, systems thinking, when applied, creates knowledge which leads to expanded knowledge, which leads to success.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Dialog is an essential tool for sharing knowledge and translating it into action. Communication can provide feedback and insight about “system, culture, practices, and artifacts and about the objectives and values of the project sponsor, client, and other stakeholders.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Learning happens during the dialog process as each stakeholder comes to observe other stakeholder’s values and ideas about what successful development would encompass.

''The Fifth Element'', by Peter Senge, emphasizes the importance of learning to improve lives using systems thinking. Individuals who acquire information, knowledge, and skills from other stakeholders and the environment tend to experience a change in their own lives and livelihood.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; They themselves then become the agents of change by sharing their knowledge with others.&lt;ref&gt;Work Bank. Knowledge for Development. New York: Oxford University Press, 1999, p, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Complex loop ===
A feedback loop, closed loop, or systems complex model is a tool to help cope with complexity&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and understand the system as a whole. The tool will help to visualize the direction, velocity, delay time, long term and short term effects, and to help see the dynamic process. Feedback is necessary to learn about each other, including objectives and values of stakeholders and officials. A systemic approach to development is change oriented. The approach must encourage humans to communicate through interpersonal interactions, address the values of each stakeholder, and take part in developing and understanding the complex loop.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Goals ==
[[File:Systems_thinking_about_the_society.svg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Systems_thinking_about_the_society.svg|thumb|Parts, society, needs, means, individuals, and bigger picture are pieces of the puzzle that must be accounted for to make systemic development successful.]]
Systemic development is based on the principle that one must understand the complexity of the whole system to develop a solution. This can be accomplished by learning different elements in the system and applying them to their existing knowledge. We must learn about the past suggested solutions, the balance of the system, influx of the system, the challenges within the system, the best timing for each element, learning about uncertainty of cause-and-effect, the best leverage points in the system, the system does not work unless every piece is functioning at its prime, and there is no one individual at fault if everyone is working together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/314017669|title=Systemic development : local solutions in a global environment|last=1944-|first=Sheffield, Jim,|last2=Emergence.|first2=Institute for the Study of Coherence and|last3=N.Z.)|first3=ANZSYS Conference (13th : 2007 : Auckland,|date=2009|publisher=Isce Publishing|isbn=9780981703275|oclc=314017669}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of systemic development is to have community participants shift from being reactors to viewing themselves “as active participants in shaping their reality [to move] from reacting to the present to creating the future”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The non-linear processes must coincide, be fluid and strive to benefit all parties involved.

'''Technoself studies''', commonly referred to as '''TSS''', is an emerging, [[interdisciplinarity]]  domain of scholarly research dealing with all aspects of [[human]] [[identity (social science)|identity]] in a technological society&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"&gt;Luppicini pp. 1–25&lt;/ref&gt; focusing on the changing nature of relationships between the human and technology. As new and constantly changing experiences of human identity emerge due to constant technological change, technoself studies seeks to map and analyze these mutually influential developments with a focus on identity, rather than technical developments. Therefore, the self is a key concept of TSS. The term "technoself", advanced by Luppicini (2013), broadly denotes evolving human identity as a result of the adoption of new technology, while avoiding ideological or philosophical biases inherent in other related terms including [[#Cyborg|cyborg]], [[#Posthuman|posthuman]], [[#Transhuman|transhuman]], techno-human,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/techno-human-condition | title=The Techno-Human Condition | publisher=MIT Press | author2=Daniel Sarewitz | author1=Braden R. Allenby}}&lt;/ref&gt; beman (also known as bio-electric human), [[#Digital identity and virtual life|digital identity]], [[#Real and virtual identities|avatar]], and [[#Homotechnicus|homotechnicus]] though Luppicini acknowledges that these categories "capture important aspects of human identity".&lt;ref&gt;Luppicini p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Technoself is further elaborated and explored in Luppicini's "''Handbook of Research on Technoself: Identity in a Technological Environment''".

==History and contextual framing==

Technoself evolved from early groundwork in identity studies, [[philosophy of mind]], and [[cognitive science]].&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt; [[René Descartes]] is often credited as one of the first identity theorists of [[Modernity]] to question the material world and the certainty of knowledge from the self. Despite heavy criticism, the question he posed regarding the necessary relation between the mind and body is still considered a prevalent theme in contemporary discussions of identity and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dixon, D.|year=1990|title=Man after man: An anthropology of the future}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another major development in identity studies came from early [[social psychology]], [[sociology]] and [[psychoanalysis]]. Beginning with [[Freud]], the psychoanalytic tradition shed some light on the dynamics of identity and personality development. [[Goffman|Erving Goffman]] expanded the inquiry of identity with his [[Dramaturgy (sociology)|dramaturgical theory]], which emphasized the centrality of the social realm and the notion of self-presentation to identity. Later, [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]] further expanded the area of inquiry by contemplating how technologies could facilitate the emergence of new ways of relating to oneself.&lt;ref name="Abbas, Y. 2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abbas|first1=Y.|last2=Dervin|first2=F.|year=2009|title=Digital Technologies of the Self|location=Newcastle|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most entrenched area of technoself studies is revolved around [[ontological]] considerations and conceptualizations of technoself.&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt; The effort to identify the essence of human being is frequent in philosophical circles and is entrenched within emerging theoretical scholarship on technoself.&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt; DeGrazia's (2005) examination  on identify/numerical identity to shed light on the ethics of human enhancement. According to DeGrazia, human identity is divided into two parts: 1) numerical identity (concerns the continuity of an individual as the same object over time or across procedure), and 2) narrative identity (concerns the changes in self-perception experienced by an individual over time).&lt;ref name="DeGrazia, D. 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = DeGrazia | first1 = D | year = 2005 | title = Enhancement technologies and human identity | url = | journal = Journal of Medicine &amp; Philosophy | volume = 30 | issue = 3| pages = 261–283 | doi=10.1080/03605310590960166}}&lt;/ref&gt; By dividing human identity into two parts, DeGrazia is facilitating a discussion on the ethics of human enhancements.&lt;ref name="DeGrazia, D. 2005"/&gt; Meanwhile, Croon Fors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:144413/FULLTEXT01.pdf|title=Being-with Information Technology: Critical explorations beyond use and design|author=Anna Croon Fors|isbn=9173051179|publisher=Department of Informatics, Umeå University|location= Umeå, Sweden}}&lt;/ref&gt;(2012) research on the entanglement of the self and digitalization have helped frame ontological considerations related to the conceptualization of technoself studies.&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt; Furthermore, the changing nature of identity is a common theme within technoself studies.&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt; As a result, this has given way for scholars to analyze questions such as: How are advances in sensing technologies, biometrics, and genetics changing the way we define and recognize identity? How are technologies changing the way people define themselves and present themselves in society? These types of questions are being heavily analyzed as the conceptualization of identity is changing rapidly.

Central to the understanding of the development of technoself studies as a field of research is the idea that human identity is shaped by the adoption of new technologies and the relationship between humans and technology. Advancements in digital technology have recently forced researchers to consider the conception of the [[self]] in relation to the increasing reliance of society on the use of technologies (such as cellphones, tablets, and [[social media]]) in daily tasks in peoples' personal and professional lives.&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt; New technologies, particularly [[computer-mediated communication]] tools, have raised questions related to identity in relationship to privacy issues, virtual identity boundaries, [[Internet fraud|online fraud]], citizen surveillance, etc. These issues come as our perspective on technology shifts from one of functionality to one of interaction. According to John Lester, in the future, "we won't simply enjoy using our tools, we will come to care for them".&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Turkle/&gt;

The noeme is a term coined in 2011 by biogerontologist [[Marios Kyriazis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biologicalimmortality.blogspot.co.uk/2011_03_01_archive.html|title=Evolutionary Replicators in the Global Brain|date=March 7, 2011|work=Human Indefinite Lifespans}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it denotes a "combination of a distinct physical brain function and that of an outsourced virtual one".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Klemm WR|title=Making a Scientific Case for Conscious Agency and Free Will|publisher=Elsevier|year=2016|page=68|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MTiOCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA68&amp;lpg=PA68&amp;dq=noeme+kyriazis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XUhVnAeio4&amp;sig=dZzl1CPJQyA4oRbAPF1A9Faha0o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjborH9jKLMAhVEIcAKHcqqAl4Q6AEIKjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=noeme%20kyriazis&amp;f=false|isbn=9780128052891}}&lt;/ref&gt; A noeme is the intellectual "networked presence" of an individual within the [[global brain]], a meaningful synergy between each individual human, their social interactions and artificial agents, globally connected to other noemes through digital communications technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 4319389 | pmid=25705180 | doi=10.3389/fnsys.2015.00007 | volume=9 | title=Systems neuroscience in focus: from the human brain to the global brain? | year=2015 | journal=Front Syst Neurosci | pages=7 | last1 = Kyriazis | first1 = M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kyriazis further clarifies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kyriazis | first1 = M | year = 2015 | title = Technological integration and hyperconnectivity: Tools for promoting extreme human lifespans | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cplx.21626/abstract | journal = Complexity | volume = 20 | issue = 6| pages = 15–24 | doi=10.1002/cplx.21626| arxiv = 1402.6910 | bibcode = 2015Cmplx..20f..15K }}&lt;/ref&gt; that: ''"...The noeme is structurally coupled with its medium, i.e. the computer/internet. It continuously generates its own organisation and specifies its operation and content. As a self-organising system it adjusts to external influences and reinvents itself in order to adapt to its environment i.e. it reproduces (self-replicates) horizontally in a process that can be termed 'noemic reproduction'. This digital intellectual manifestation of a person, if successful, will lead to others copying it, thus noemes are replicating... A noeme is not just a collection of single ideas or solitary intellectual achievements. It is the total sum of all individual cognitive efforts and active information-sharing accomplishments of a person, the intellectual standing of a person within the [[Global brain]].''

===Cyborg===

A [[cyborg]] (cybernetic organism) is a term referring to individuals with "both biological and artificial parts." Cyborgs are known as being half-human, half machine organisms, due to the fact that they are always connected with technology. This term, which was coined in 1960 by [[Manfred Clynes]], refers to and acknowledges those beings whose abilities have been enhanced due to the presence and advancement of technology. The notion of cyborg has played a part in breaking down boundaries between humans and non-humans living within a technologically advanced society. For example, those who have installed pacemakers, hearing aids, artificial body parts, cochlear implants as well as other technologies that may aid in enhancing an organisms abilities and capacities to perform, either physically or mentally.&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt;
[[Hugh Herr]], an American rock climber, engineer, and biophysicist, has successfully invented the next generation of cyborg (bionic limbs and robotic prosthetics).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Strickland, E.|date=May 27, 2014|title=We Will End Disability by Becoming Cyborgs|accessdate=November 5, 2014|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/biomedical/bionics/we-will-end-disability-by-becoming-cyborgs}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the head of the Media Lab's Biomechatronics group in MIT, he shared his experience and presented the team achievement first time in a [[TED (conference)|TED]] talk show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDsNZJTWw0w | title=The new bionics that let us run, climb and dance | accessdate=May 15, 2016 | people=Hugh Herr |via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transhuman===
[[Transhuman]] is a concept that emerged as a result of the transhumanist movement which is centred around the notion of improving the abilities of human beings mainly through both 'scientific and technical means.' Unlike the posthuman concept, the notion of transhuman is based on human augmentation but does not commit itself to positing a new separate species.&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt; The philosophy of [[transhumanism]] was developed in the 1990s by British philosopher [[Max More]] who articulated the principles of transhumanism as a futurist philosophy. However, the transhuman philosophy has also been subject to scrutiny by prominent scholars such as [[Francis Fukuyama]].

===Posthuman===

[[Posthuman]] is a concept that aims towards signifying and characterizing a fresh and enhanced type of being. This organism is highly representative of a being that embraces drastic capabilities that exceed current human capabilities that are presently defining human beings. This posthuman state of identity has mainly resulted from the advancement of technological presence. According to Luppicini, posthuman capabilities "suggest a new type of being over and above human. This compromises the neutrality needed for a clear conception of human identity in the face of human-technological integration." This concept aims towards enabling a brighter future concerned with gaining a better perception of the world through various viewpoints.&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt;

===Homotechnicus===

Homo technicus is a term "first coined by Galvin in 2003 to help refine the definition of human beings to more accurately reflect the evolving condition of human beings intertwined within advancing technological society".&lt;ref name="Technoself 2013"&gt;"Handbook of Research on Technoself: Identity in a Technological Society", ''Information Science Reference'' (2013), by Rocci Luppicini.&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to the notion that human beings are technological by nature and evolve simultaneously with technology. Galvin states in his article titled "On Technoethics", "mankind cannot do away with the technical dimension, going even to the
point of considering this part of its constitution: mankind is technical by nature. Technology is not an
addition to man but is, in fact, one of the ways in which mankind distinguishes itself from animals."&lt;ref name="Galvan"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Galván, José María|date=December 2003|title=On Technoethics|url=http://bib26.pusc.it/teo/p_galvan/technotehics%20ieee%20tradotto.pdf|journal=IEEE Robotics and Automation Magazine|volume=10|issue=4|pages=58–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luppicini builds upon the concept of homo technicus in his book ''Handbook of Research on Technoself: Identity in a Technological Society''. Luppicini feels that the notion of homo technicus contributes to the conception of humans as technoselves in two ways. First it helps to solidify the idea of technology as being a key component in defining humans and society and secondly it demonstrates the importance of technology as a human creation that aligns with human values.&lt;ref name="Technoself 2013"/&gt; He further goes onto explain that human interactions with the material world around them helps to create meaning and this unique way of creating meaning has affected how humans have evolved as a species.

Note: the term homo technicus was coined earlier than 2003.  For instance, it was used by Russell E. Willis in his 1990 PhD dissertation for Emory University: Toward a Theological Ethics of Technology: An analysis in Dialogue with Jacques Ellul, James Gustafson, and the Philosophy of Technology.  It was later used by Willis in "Complex Responsibility in an Age of Technology," in Living Responsibly in Community, ed. Fredrick E. Glennon, et al. (University Press of America, 1997): 251ff.  In both publications homo technicus is offered as a model for the responsible self in an age of pervasive technology.

===Avatar===
[[Avatar (computing)|Avatars]] represent the individual, the individual's alter ego, or character(s) within virtual environments controlled by a human user. Avatars provide a unique opportunity to experiment with one's identity construction within virtual worlds (Turkle, 1995) and to do so with others". Examples of avatars can include personas in online games or virtual life simulations such as Second Life.

===Technohuman===
A new hybrid form of creature that results from an intertwinement between human and machine.

===Technosapien===
A techno-sapien would be a slang term for a human being who is familiar and comfortable with technology. Someone who has the latest gadgets and electronic machinery would be techno-sapien.

===Digital identity===
[[Digital identity]] is the data that uniquely describes a person or a thing and contains information about the subject's relationships. The social identity that an internet user establishes through digital identities in cyberspace is referred to as online identity.

==Key areas and issues==
The areas of focus in TSS are: philosophical inquiry and theoretical framing, [[digital identity]] and [[virtual life]], [[human enhancement]] [[Technology|technologies]], and their regulation.&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt; These areas of study have been influenced by extensive research, and input from an editorial advisory and review board over the course of several years.&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt;

===Digital identity and virtual life===
Digital identity and virtual life looks at how individuals explore, develop and represent their identities in online, virtual, or mediated environments. Research on virtual life and digital identities is concerned not only with how individuals relate to their own mediated identities, but also with how they relate to those of others. With the current popularity of [[social networking service]] sites, it is no surprise that TSS scholars have also begun studying the effects that such constant and mediated social connections have on identity. Topics that fall under this category have included [[intellectual disability]], [[gender identity]], and [[mass media]] in sport.

Critical areas of research include: how individuals treat the identity of others in an online space; how people use media to develop and project their identity; and how digital representation can alter life meaning and identity (Luppicini, 2013). Such research examines the advantages and disadvantages of online life and digital identity construction.&lt;ref name=LuppicicniP15P16&gt;Luppicini, pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt;

Areas of digital identity and virtual life have become quite popular, e.g. online avatars. Scholars are now focused on the role avatars play in identity exploration, priming behaviours, and self-presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dunn | first1 = R. | last2 = Guadagno | first2 = R. | year = 2012 | title = My avatar and me - Gender and personality predictors of avatar-self discrepancy | url = | journal = Computers in Human Behavior | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 97–106 | doi=10.1016/j.chb.2011.08.015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research looks at the use of [[communication]] technologies by immigrant individuals as part of a digital [[diaspora]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Elias | first1 = N. | last2 = Lemish | first2 = D. | year = 2009 | title = Spinning the web of identity: Internet's roles in immigrant adolescents' search of identity | url = | journal = New Media and Society | volume = 11 | issue = 4| pages = 533–551 | doi=10.1177/1461444809102959}}&lt;/ref&gt; These scholars examine a trend in which diasporic immigrants who feel disconnected from their cultural identities have turned to digital technologies as a way to reconnect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Papacharissi, Z.|year=2011|title=A networked self: Identity, community, and culture on social networking sites|location=New York, NY|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "technoself" is often used interchangeably with "virtual self". In this case, technoself is used to refer to a virtual manifestation of one's self.  The ability to project one's self into a virtual world allows users to control their appearance and personality. Users are able to customize their virtual identity and craft a persona to their liking. The malleability of online identities allows users to not only create their own virtual self, but also to continually change and mold their online selves in ways impossible to do with their real identities. Users can edit and change their virtual selves' appearance and behavior to control other users' perception of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seung-A|first=Annie Jin|title=The virtual malleable self and the virtual identity discrepancy model: Investigative frameworks for virtual possible selves and others in avatar-based identity construction and social interaction|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|date=November 2012|volume=28|issue=6|page=2161|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2012.06.022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability to create and change your identity in this way, is due to anonymity. [[Anonymity]] is a paramount and dynamic feature of virtual social interaction within the online [[public sphere]]. As individuals are not required to reveal their real identity, they are able to explore new and undiscovered aspects of themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yee | first1 = N | year = 2009 | title = The Proteus Effect: Implications of Transformed Digital Self-Representation on Online and Offline Behavior | url = | journal = Communication Research | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 285–312 | doi=10.1177/0093650208330254}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this expansion of the self, anonymous individuals may try on various identities which break traditional social norms, without fear of retribution or judgment. This contributes to the creation of 'super-selves', through which individuals may amplify aspects of their projected identities in order to form an ideal expression of the self.&lt;ref name="Abbas, Y. 2009"/&gt; The fact that the vast majority of virtual encounters are anonymous in nature allows a 'strangers on a train' phenomenon to
take place. Through invented and unknown personae, individuals are able to engage in self-disclosure, transvestism, and fantasies. However, this freedom may not be absolute, as there are many risks in participating in an online community, including identity theft and the potential linkage between anonymous and manifest identities.&lt;ref name=Turkle/&gt; Anonymity also may have legal ramifications, making it difficult for law enforcement to maintain control over online communities. Tracking down online law-breakers is difficult when their identity is unknown. Anonymity also frees individuals so that they are able to behave in socially undesirable and harmful ways, which can result in forms of hate speech and cruel online behaviour. Lastly, anonymity also diminishes the integrity of information, and as a result, diminished the overall trust of online environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Johnson|first1=D.|last2=Miller|first2=K.|year=1998|title=Anonymity, Pseudonymity, or Inescapable Identity on the Net|conference=Ethics and Social Impact: Privacy Issue|volume=28|issue=2|doi= 10.1145/276755.276774 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many online users choose to attempt anonymity through the use of avatars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Avatar|year=2012|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/avatar?s=t|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users associate themselves with avatars as digital representatives within a duplicated and simulated [[virtual community]]. The user's body is essentially plugged in within the avatar world, thereby creating the illusion of infinite "space" behind the computer screen. As a result, they provide the opportunity for users to manipulate their worlds and the spaces and objects with which they interact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Davis, K.|year=2011|title=Tensions of identity in a networked era: Young people's perspectives on the risks and rewards of online self-expression|journal=New Media &amp; Society|volume=14|issue=4|pages=634–651|doi=10.1177/1461444811422430}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participation in online communities has resulted in the creation of a virtual economy based on the semantic value of digital products.&lt;ref name="Chen, Y. 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chen | first1 = Y. | last2 = Huang | first2 = S. | last3 = Shang | first3 = R. | year = 2012 | title = A private versus a public space: Anonymity and buying decorative symbolic goods for avatars in a virtual world | doi = 10.1016/j.chb.2012.06.030 | journal = Computers in Human Behavior | volume = 28 | issue = 6| pages = 2227–2235 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of online consumerism is centered on the creation of avatars as extensions of the self. The purchase of symbolic goods for these avatars relates to the emotional and social value that the user holds for these items. These products may indicate roles or personality traits of players within a community and consist primarily of task oriented and nonfunctional items.&lt;ref name="Chen, Y. 2012"/&gt;

Luppicini argues that the rise of online life creates serious questions on the advantages and disadvantages of [[Online community|online communities]] along with the challenges to online identity construction (Turkle, 1999). He notes the negative influence of the impersonality of virtual communities on offline interaction and the consequence of [[Internet addiction disorder|Internet addiction]]. [[Sherry Turkle]] states: "We discovered the network – the world of connectivity – to be uniquely suited to the overworked and overscheduled life it makes possible. And now we look to the network to defend us against loneliness even as we want it to control the intensity of our connections".&lt;ref&gt;Luppicini, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

===Privacy and surveillance of the technoself===
{{See also|Surveillance#Psychological/social effects}}
[[Computer networking]] and smart technologies such as [[radio frequency identification]] (RFID), [[geographical information systems]] (GIS), and [[global positioning systems]] (GPS) are providing new tools and techniques for monitoring individuals and their behavior.&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt; The rise in these types of technologies has raised concerns over the invasion of privacy, and the misuse of information.&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt;  That is because the networked identity of technoselves can be exploited by third parties who may want to gain access and control over personal information.&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt; Moreover, the implications of the sophisticated technologies for identifying and tracking&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sscqueens.org/sites/default/files/2005_03_Loctech.pdf | title=Location Technologies: Mobility, Surveillance and Privacy | publisher=Surveillance Studies Centre | date=March 2005 | accessdate=May 15, 2016 |author1=David Lyon |author2=Stephen Marmura |author3=Pasha Peroff }}&lt;/ref&gt; people, the storage of this data, and the governmental use of surveillance   to track suspicious types of people are significant issues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sscqueens.org/ | accessdate=May 15, 2016 |title=Surveillance Studies Centre }}&lt;/ref&gt; in privacy/[[surveillance]] and TSS.&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt; The availability of related technologies (e.g. [[EyeTap]], [[Memoto]]) to individuals (as opposed to governments or commercial interests) has also led to the phenomenon dubbed [[sousveillance]], whereby individuals track or record authorities' activities either online or in real environments.

Leading scholars in the study of surveillance include [[David Lyon (sociologist)|David Lyon]] and Mark Andrejevic.  In addition to contributing to the advent of [[citizen journalism]], the proliferation of sousveillance technologies has suggested a number of legal/regulatory, ethical, and social implications for democratic and consumer rights. A dramatic illustration of these concerns comes from University of Toronto Professor [[Steve Mann]], a privacy rights advocate and pioneering engineer of such technologies. After being allegedly assaulted&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://wearcam.org/mcdonalds/eyetap_blogspot_mcdonalds.pdf | title=Physical assault by McDonald's for wearing Digital Eye Glass | work=wearcam.org | date=July 16, 2012 | accessdate=May 15, 2016 | first=Steve | last=Mann | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DGSr4dBe?url=http://wearcam.org/mcdonalds/eyetap_blogspot_mcdonalds.pdf | archivedate=2012-12-29 | deadurl=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in a French McDonald's restaurant for wearing an augmented-reality digital eye glass device, Mann was, ironically, allegedly denied access&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://wearcam.org/mcdonalds/Unanswered_letter_to_McDonalds_Head_of_Customer_Services.pdf | title=Unanswered letter to McDonalds' Head of Customer Services | work=wearcam.org | date=August 17, 2012 | accessdate=May 15, 2016 | first=Steve | last=Mann | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DGXfTquv?url=http://wearcam.org/mcdonalds/Unanswered_letter_to_McDonalds_Head_of_Customer_Services.pdf | archivedate=2012-12-29 | deadurl=no | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to McDonald's own surveillance camera footage.

===Human enhancement technology===

[[Human enhancement]] technology (HET) is the study of tools that would better and improve a human being's way of life.&lt;ref name=LuppiciniP15&gt;Luppicini, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; It seeks to advance and progress what humans already do within their normal lives. However, customarily it seeks to aid any illnesses and weaknesses in the body.  Popular topics within this new area of study include, [[sex reassignment surgery]], mood enhancers, [[genomics]], and [[neuroenhancement]].&lt;ref name=LuppiciniP15/&gt; Enhancement within the workplace is a new topic of discussion, while the workplace should be adapting to the various types of human impairment, it seems that improving the workers is of more concern to corporations.&lt;ref&gt;Human enhancement. (2012). ''Psychologist'', 25(12), 875-875.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the use of [[cyborg]] prosthetics one can assemble themselves in their own vision, any disfigurement or handicap can possibly disappear.&lt;ref name="Hogle, L. F. 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hogle | first1 = L. F. | year = 2005 | title = Enhancement technologies and the body | url = | journal = Annual Review of Anthropology | volume = 34 | issue = 1| pages = 695–716 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.anthro.33.070203.144020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the evolution of cyborg prosthetics a human is able to physically grasp things more easily, allowing more of the population to engage in whatever they choose.  A large aspect of this technology stems from the ability to determine who may and may not benefit, as well as how  access to these new technologies should be controlled.

Human bodies can now not only be improved upon through natural means, but through the effects of technology.&lt;ref name="Hogle, L. F. 2005"/&gt; This new form of enhancement is connected with what humans perceive of themselves, and as to how their own identity is created.  A human operates based on their abilities; these capabilities are the factors and characteristics that create a personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = DeGrazia | first1 = D | year = 2005 | title = Enhancement technologies and human identity 1 | url = | journal = Journal of Medicine &amp; Philosophy | volume = 30 | issue = 3| pages = 261–283 | doi = 10.1080/03605310590960166 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The augmentation of these aptitudes leads to a new human, who has a renewed sense of who they are. The term 'free to be me' is closely related to this new form of enhancement, wherein technological enhancements can be either cosmetic or reconstructive.&lt;ref name="Hogle, L. F. 2005"/&gt;  Through the incorporation of medicine and technology "...[[cosmetic surgery]] then becomes a technology through which the body is normalized and homogenized as much as enhanced".&lt;ref name="Hogle, L. F. 2005"/&gt; A proper example relating to human enhancement and cyborgs could be the recently convicted [[Oscar Pistorius]]. In past years, [[Pistorius]] fought with the International Olympic Committee to have a place in the hurdles events of the 2012 Olympics in London. The controversy surrounding Pistorius extended to his artificial legs, and how they compared to the natural human anatomy; did Pistorius have an unfair advantage over his competitors? The ruling was left up to a scientific analysis of his legs and running stride which ultimately lead to his participation in the Olympic Games. Therefore, we've come to a time where decisions, and thus human panels, need to determine what is human, what is natural, and what is artificial.

Rights and privacy issues over human enhancement technology has given rise to challenging topics within technoself studies.&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt; For example, the consideration of ethical policies and guidelines in the deployment of HET is an emerging topic within TSS.&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt; Further, the question of access to HET, and where we draw the line between necessary therapeutic technologies, and frivolous human enhancement are being raised in TSS.&lt;ref name="Lupp 1-25"/&gt; Therefore, the emerging topic regarding the rights and privacy over HET is of great interest within TSS. Popular HET's topics in recent research academia include: Sex (re assignment) (Diamond &amp; Sigmundson, 1997; Zucker, 2002), mood enhancers (Rabin, 2006), cognitive enhancers (Walker, 2008), genomics (Zwart, 2009), and [[neuroenhancement]] (Northoff,1996). A second line of inquiry explores social, legal, and ethical aspects of human enhancement and possible threats to human dignity that could arise from the implementation of human enhancements
(Bostrom, 2005).

Some critiques engage a discussion between the development of HET and the socio-economic environment. [[Francis Fukuyama]], an American political scientist concerns about the future of HET might cause the extension of contradiction between the rich and poor within comparatively rich, industrialized nations because HET is likely to be a luxury product.&lt;ref&gt;Society for Computers &amp; Law. (n.d.). Retrieved November 5, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; At the moment, HET seems to be hard to be mainstream in public health services due to the price, which creates a deeper distinctions among those who can afford the technology and those who will remain disabled.

===Transhumanism===

[[Transhuman]] thought focuses on beliefs held that the fundamental transformation of the human condition will be through the development of various technology, which will eventually eliminate human aging and will enhance human capacities, both physical and mental.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Moravec, Hans|year=1998|title=When will computer hardware match the human brain?|journal=Journal of Evolution and Technology|volume=1|accessdate=2006-06-23|url=http://www.ee.sc.edu/classes/Fall11/elct762/Class_Notes/Moravec.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Believers in this theory think that the future of human development will see a new intelligent species that will be enhanced by the technological advances. They use these technological advances to approach various issues regarding the human experience, like morality and health issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Moreno, Jonathan D.|year=2006|title=Mind Wars: Brain Research and National Defense|publisher=Dana Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; They see this convergence happening through the support of current technologies and the vision of technology in the future; using these advances to eventually make humans more than human, enhanced through this technology. Their central argument is that humans need to be able to choose whether or not this technology is used by them or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Clark, Amanda C. R.|date=March 12, 2010|title=Transhumanism and Posthumanism: Lifting Man Up or Pulling Him Down?|website=Ignatius Insight|accessdate=2012-05-18|url=http://www.ignatiusinsight.com/features2010/aclark_tranhumanism_mar2010.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This theory expands on the notion of technoself, as [[transhumanism]] poses what to many who hold these beliefs is the natural evolution of the human condition. Many look to the history of technological advancements as proof that these future advancements are possible, at least in theory.

===Real and virtual identities===

[[Avatar (computing)|Avatar]]s are a visual representation of a user in an online environment. This representation may be an accurate physical representation of the user, or may be completely different. This online representation may affect the offline self. Pena and his colleagues explored a phenomenon known as the "[[Proteus effect]]" wherein "avatars can prime negative attitudes and cognition in desktop virtual settings".&lt;ref name="Pena et al"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Peña | first1 = J. | last2 = Hancock | first2 = J. | last3 = Merola | first3 = N. | year = 2009 | title = The priming effects of avatars in virtual settings | url = | journal = Communication Research | volume = 36 | issue = 6| pages = 838–856 | doi = 10.1177/0093650209346802 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They conducted a study that demonstrated how the appearance and affiliations of an individual's online avatar can alter the individual's offscreen personality and attitudes. Pena's group used virtual group discussions to gauge the aggressiveness of individuals using avatars wearing black cloaks versus their control group counterparts wearing white and found more aggressive intentions and attitudes in the black cloak group.

Similar results were found in a second study that used Thematic Apperception Test studies to determine the differences between values and attitudes of a control group and a group using a [[Ku Klux Klan|Ku Klux Klan (KKK)]]-associated avatar. Individuals using the KKK-associated avatars were less affiliative and displayed more negative thoughts than the control group. Further support for Pena et al.'s work can be found in other studies that yielded similar results: "Yee and Bailenson found that, in an immersive 3D environment, participants using avatars with more attractive faces walked closer and disclosed more information when compared to those using avatars with less attractive faces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yee | first1 = N. | last2 = Bailenson | first2 = J. | last3 = Ducheneaut | first3 = N. | year = 2009 | title = The proteus effect | url = | journal = Communication Research | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 285–312 | doi = 10.1177/0093650208330254 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition...participants using taller avatars tended to negotiate more forcefully in comparison to those using shorter avatars."&lt;ref name="Pena et al" /&gt; A growing body of evidence supports how our online personas can affect our offline self; altering our attitudes and values.

===Online anonymity and presentation of the self===

[[Anonymous post|Online anonymity]] is commonly described using the phrase "[[On the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog]]". Online anonymity allows users to present different versions of themselves in online environments. Unconstrained by physical limitations, users are free to choose and construct their virtual form(s) and identities. Virtual spaces which foster such freedom and anonymity therefore allow  users to depart from the expectations, norms, and behaviours of their daily lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hardey | first1 = M | year = 2002 | title = Life Beyond the Screen: embodiment and identity through the internet | journal = The Editorial Board of Sociological Review | volume = 50 | issue = | pages = 570–585 |doi=10.1111/1467-954X.00399|url=http://www.jimelwood.net/students/grips/man_group_comm/hardey_2000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be said that this unlimited freedom of anonymous expression allows for the transfer of real world suppressed emotions to the online domain. However, if one continually chooses to express their true self anonymously online as opposed to in the real world via face to face interaction, which realm would be more 'real'? As extreme as this scenario may seem, one could say the suppression of norms and natural expression would deem the physical self the avatar, and the online avatar the true self.

A user's [[online identity]] is a social identity that represents the user in the online environment, allowing a user a high level of control over their identity in a way that differs from the offline world. Turkle found that the level of control over creating an online identity also extends to the intensity of connections made in such virtual spaces, as users may engage and disengage at will.&lt;ref name=Turkle&gt;{{cite book|last1=Turkle|first1=Sherry|title=Alone Together: why we expect more from technology and less from each other|date=2011|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=9780465031467}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dervin and Abbas note that Turkle, in her early work was "one of the first to show how anonymity 'provides ample room for individuals to express unexplored parts of themselves' more easily than in face-to-face interaction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abbas|first1=Y.|last2=Dervin|first2=F.|year=2009|title=Digital Technologies of the Self|contribution=Introduction|url=http://www.c-s-p.org/flyers/978-1-4438-1419-5-sample.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806074020/http://www.c-s-p.org/flyers/978-1-4438-1419-5-sample.pdf|archivedate=August 6, 2013|deadurl=yes|location=Newcastle|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within this notion of being free in online anonymity, technoself studies also looks at what the element of hiding does to us.  Turkle suggests that, "our networked life allows us to hide from each other, even as we are tethered to each other".&lt;ref name=Turkle/&gt; Technoself studies explores what these profiles do to the human unconscious.  While people are "exposing" themselves, they question their level of exposure and sharing compared to extent in what they are truly hiding in reality.
Furthermore, when creating online profiles, people risk others' perceptions of the information shared and if they receive the messages that the sender intended. Without verbal communication misperceptions, messages can alter identity or personal development.

Avatars can be an important element of the online presentation of the user. In many cases, "avatars in blogging were created to accurately reflect their owners' physical appearance, lifestyle and preferences. By contrast, participants in the dating and gaming treatments accentuated certain aspects of their avatar to reflect the tone and perceived expectations of the context".&lt;ref name="Vasalou &amp; Joinson"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vasalou | first1 = A. | last2 = Joinson | first2 = A. N. | year = 2009 | title = Me, myself and I: The role of interactional context on self-presentation through avatars | url = | journal = Computers in Human Behavior | volume = 25 | issue = 2| pages = 510–520 | doi = 10.1016/j.chb.2008.11.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, individuals often emphasize or downplay certain characteristics depending upon the context of their online interactions. These inconsistencies tend to be trivial, however. For instance, men tend to mildly exaggerate their height, while women often underestimate their weight. This is typically not an attempt to mislead others but to be as honest as possible while still presenting themselves in the best light.

According to Vasalou &amp; Joinson, although various online forums may present people with the opportunity to create (an) alternate persona(s), they typically choose to create an avatar or represent themselves in a way that is consistent with reality: "In having equal access to everyday artifacts and fantasy options, participants were inclined to draw on existing self-views rather than grasping the opportunity to explore other personas". Furthermore, Vasalou and Joinson also claim that, in the context of online communication, high self-awareness (as demonstrated by an avatar largely consistent with an individual's offline persona), contributes to a higher rate of interpersonal communication.&lt;ref name="Vasalou &amp; Joinson" /&gt;

One consequence of online anonymity and creating false identities is the ability to "catfish". [[Catfishing]] is a recent internet phenomenon, of manipulating, deceiving and luring people into relationships, through creating an online fictional persona. In many cases these deceptions are used to create romantic or intimate affairs. Since the affair happens entirely through technology, one is able to hide their true identity and carry on the relationship through their made up character. The majority of these incidences happen through social media sites, such as [[Facebook]], and internet dating sites where people are already looking for love, and therefore can be easily manipulated by peoples personas and deceptions.

==New directions and opportunities in research==

===Personalized robots and social integration of artificial creatures===
{{See also|Ubiquitous robot|Cloud robotics|Domestic robot}}
New directions and opportunities in technoself research involving personalized robots and social integration of artificial creatures is becoming an increasing reality. Considering the work of pioneering computer scientists and robotics experts such a Rodney Brooks and Hiroshi Ishiguro, human interaction with personal and social robots reached mainstream audiences beginning with the popularization of robotic dolls and pets for children.&lt;ref name=LuppP17&gt;Luppicini, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;  Research by [[Sherry Turkle]] examines many of the effects of these social robots on children, middle and elderly. There are also robots for adults aimed at therapeutic (technotherapy), personal, and social applications ([[Paro (robot)|Paro]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cute Baby Seal Robot - PARO Theraputic Robot #DigInfo|date= August 11, 2010|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJq5PQZHU-I&amp;feature=related}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phobot]], [[Roxxxy]], etc.).&lt;ref name=LuppP17/&gt; These types of therapeutic robots are used in nursing homes and hospitals, with the purpose of creating an environment where one can nurture and communicate with an animal. This allows people in a lonely or isolated environment the ability to have something to care for and interact with that is also able to respond and interact back. This has shown to provide happiness and a larger sense of purpose for the individuals, even if for a short period of time.  With personalized robots and the social integration of artificial intelligence, technoself is developing in children through relationships with robotic pets and related robotic technologies based on animals, objects, or people ([[Tamagotchi]], [[Furby]], [[AIBO]], etc.).&lt;ref name=LuppP17/&gt;  Current areas of interest in this topic are reported in [[Melson]] (2012), which provide helpful insights into children's views about robot pets, children's relationship with robotic pets and, conceptualizations of self-identity within child-robot relationships.&lt;ref name=LuppP17/&gt; Other research is focusing more on personalized robots for adults. If the trend towards the personalization of robots and social integration of artificial creatures continues, it is expected that this research will become more prevalent.&lt;ref name=LuppP17/&gt; David Levy, the artificial intelligence researcher in [[University of Maastricht]] contains the forecast of robot and human relationship in his thesis, "Intimate Relationships with Artificial Partners".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/web/Sitewide/Pers/LoveAndSexWithRobots1.htm|title=Love and Sex with Robots|date=October 8, 2007|publisher=University of Maastricht}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his interview Forecast: Sex and Marriage with Robots by 2050 with ''[[LiveScience]]'', Levy says :"My forecast is that around 2050, the state of Massachusetts will be the first jurisdiction to legalize marriages with robots".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/1951-forecast-sex-marriage-robots-2050.html|title=Forecast: Sex and Marriage with Robots by 2050|work=LiveScience|date=October 12, 2007|author=Charles Q. Choi}}&lt;/ref&gt; are real life experience suggesting that humans can develop an psychological level relationship with artificial subjects, even if the subject itself is not in any physical shape. [[Judith Newman]] wrote an article on ''[[New York Times]]'' about the relationship between the [[Siri]] system and her 13-year-old son who has [[autism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/19/fashion/how-apples-siri-became-one-autistic-boys-bff.html?_r=0|title=To Siri, With Love|date=October 17, 2014|first=Judith|last=Newman|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newman says his son develops a close relationship with the system and learning to show affection to it even though he knows Siri is not 'real'. Newman suggest that Siri could be a potential companion to those children who have a hard time to communicate with people. Duggan (2016) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Duggan|first1 = G.B.|title = Applying psychology to understand relationships with technology: from ELIZA to interactive healthcare |journal = Behaviour and Information Technology|date = 2016|volume = 35|pages = 536–547|doi=10.1080/0144929X.2016.1141320}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes how users already form relationships with technology that share many of the features of relationships between humans. These relationships have important implications for the future of healthcare as interactive technology increasingly replaces roles traditionally filled by humans.

===Human enhancement regulation and governance===
{{See also|:Category:Regulation of technologies}}
Human enhancement regulation, governance, and legal concerns has become another growing concern for the opportunity of TSS research. According to Saner and Geelen (2012), there is one framework to guide technoself governance which distinguishes six different approaches to which emerging technologies may affect human identity:
# physical alteration of existing human beings
# changes to how existing human bodies are perceived
# the creation of novel humanoid bodies
# physical alteration of existing human environments
# changes to the way humans perceive existing human environments
# creation of novel human environments.&lt;ref name=LuppP17/&gt;

Luppicini posits that this sort of model could "prove invaluable for guiding future decision making directed at the framing of HET regulation debates, as well as leveraging strategic planning and decision making concerning HET adaption standards."&lt;ref name=LuppP17/&gt; [[Technoethics]] relates to the ethical considerations concerning technology in society.Human enhancement improves aspects of human function and may temporarily or permanently overcome the limitations of the human body through natural or artificial means. The consequences of such technological alterations implies ethical questions such as the unfair physical and mental categorization of certain individuals. Therefore, further consideration will need to be associated with ethical questions surrounding the evolution of technology. With growing trends of artificial intelligence and technological devices, such as [[Google Glass]], stricter regulation will be necessary. Furthermore, [[Elon Musk]] recently stated that "We need to be careful with AI (artificial intelligence). Potentially more dangerous than nukes",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/elon-musk-artificial-intelligence-may-be-more-dangerous-than-nukes/|title=Elon Musk: Artificial intelligence may be "more dangerous than nukes"|date=August 4, 2014|work=CBS News|first=Eliene|last=Augenbraun}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that there may be need to worry about the evolution of technology, and specifically how humans employ it to their benefit.

The '''United Nations Evaluation Group''' (UNEG) is a platform for the different [[United Nations]] (UN) evaluation offices to discuss evaluation issues and to share evaluation knowledge. It suggests norms and standards for all evaluation offices in the UN and delivers thematic reports concerning [[monitoring and evaluation]]. It has 45 members and 3 observers listed below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uneval.org/about |title=Introduction |publisher=Uneval.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
UNEG was created in January 1984 with the name ‘Inter-Agency Working Group on Evaluation’ (IAWG). It was part of the UN consultative group on programme questions (CCPOQ). It is a group of heads of UN evaluation offices which meet to discuss system wide evaluation issues. Its genesis owes much to the work of the Joint Inspection Unit (JIU) in particular Inspector Earl Sohm, JIU/REP/85/10 and JIU/REP/85/11.

Much of its initial work was on designing, testing and introducing an M&amp;E system for UN operational activities in particular technical assistance projects. This was done by 1986. Most of UN operational activities were then funded by the UN Development Programme (UNDP) which provided the secretariat and the leadership for the Group. 

Policy and Strategy evaluation were paid insufficient attention initially. {An evaluation of the IAWG in the year 2000 pointed out that it needed to return to its proactive function with specific deliverables that could be used by the UN evaluation system in their work. The recommendations of the report highlighted the need for structured interaction among UNEG members, annual work planning, work groups to move the agenda forward and developing a website to enhance knowledge sharing. In 2003, the IAWG changed its name to the United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uneval.org/about |title=Introduction |publisher=Uneval.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
The mission on UNEG is to promote and support the independence, credibility and usefulness of the evaluation units in the UN system. According to its Strategy 2014-2019,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uneval.org/document/detail/1459 |title=Detail of UNEG Strategy 2014-2019 |publisher=Uneval.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNEG's work is focused on four strategic objectives:

1) Evaluation functions and products of UN entities meet the UNEG Norms and Standards for evaluation;

2) UN entities and partners use evaluation in support of accountability and programme learning;

3) Evaluation informs UN system-wide initiatives and emerging demands; and

4) UNEG benefits from and contributes to an enhanced global evaluation profession.

==Membership==
UNEG currently has 46 members and 3 observers. Membership reserved for the units responsible for evaluation in the UN system, including the specialized agencies, funds, programmes and affiliated organizations. These units should have, or aspire to have, the required professional knowledge, experience and responsibility for evaluation as defined by the updated UNEG Norms and Standards for Evaluation (2016).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5365">In [[mathematics]], '''Vopěnka's principle''' is a [[large cardinal]] axiom. 
The intuition behind the axiom is that the set-theoretical universe is so large that in every [[proper class]], some members are similar to others, with this similarity formalized through [[elementary embedding]]s.

Vopěnka's principle was first introduced by [[Petr Vopěnka]] and independently considered by [[H. Jerome Keisler]], and was written up by {{harvtxt|Solovay|Reinhardt|Kanamori|1978}}.
According to {{harvtxt|Pudlák|2013|loc=p. 204}}, Vopěnka's principle was originally intended as a joke: Vopěnka was apparently unenthusiastic about large cardinals and introduced his principle as a bogus large cardinal property, planning to show later that it was not consistent. However, before publishing his inconsistency proof he found a flaw in it.

==Definition==

Vopěnka's principle asserts that for every [[proper class]] of [[binary relation]]s (each with set-sized domain), there is one [[elementary embedding|elementarily embeddable]] into another. This cannot be stated as a single sentence of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]] as it involves a quantification over classes.  A cardinal κ is called a '''Vopěnka cardinal''' if it is [[inaccessible cardinal|inaccessible]] and Vopěnka's principle holds in the rank ''V''&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;/sub&gt; (allowing arbitrary ''S'' ⊂ ''V''&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;/sub&gt; as "classes").
&lt;ref name="Kan"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kanamori|first1=Akihiro||author-link=Akihiro Kanamori|title=The higher infinite: large cardinals in set theory from their beginnings|date=2003|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin [u.a.]|isbn=9783540003847|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many equivalent formulations are possible.
For example, Vopěnka's principle is equivalent to each of the following statements. 
* For every proper class of [[Directed graph|simple directed graphs]], there are two members of the class with a homomorphism between them.&lt;ref name="AdR"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosicky|first1=Jiří Adámek ; Jiří|title=Locally presentable and accessible categories|date=1994|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge [u.a.]|isbn=0521422612|edition=Digital print. 2004.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* For any [[Signature (logic)|signature]] ''Σ'' and any proper class of ''Σ''-structures, there are two members of the class with an elementary embedding between them.&lt;ref name="Kan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AdR" /&gt;
* For every predicate ''P'' and proper class ''S'' of [[ordinal number|ordinals]], there is a non-trivial elementary embedding ''j'':(''V''&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;/sub&gt;, ∈, ''P'') → (V&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;, ∈, ''P'') for some κ and λ in ''S''.&lt;ref name="Kan" /&gt;
* The [[Category (mathematics)|category]] of ordinals cannot be fully embedded in the category of graphs.&lt;ref name="AdR" /&gt;
* Every subfunctor of an [[Accessible category|accessible functor]] is accessible.&lt;ref name="AdR" /&gt;
* (In a definable classes setting) For every natural number ''n'', there exists a [[Extendible cardinal#Variants and relation to other cardinals|''C&lt;sup&gt;(n)&lt;/sup&gt;''-extendible cardinal]].&lt;ref name="Bag"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bagaria|first1=Joan|title=''C&lt;sup&gt;(n)&lt;/sup&gt;''-cardinals|journal=Archive for Mathematical Logic|date=23 December 2011|volume=51|issue=3–4|pages=213–240|doi=10.1007/s00153-011-0261-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strength==

Even when restricted to predicates and proper classes definable in first order set theory, the principle implies existence of Σ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; correct [[extendible cardinal]]s for every ''n''.

If κ is an [[huge cardinal|almost huge cardinal]], then a strong form of Vopěnka's principle holds in ''V''&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;/sub&gt;:

:There is a  κ-complete [[ultrafilter]] ''U'' such that for every {''R''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;: ''i''&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;κ} where each ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is a binary relation and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''V''&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;/sub&gt;, there is ''S''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''U'' and a non-trivial elementary embedding ''j'': ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; → ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt; for every ''a''&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''b'' in ''S''.
