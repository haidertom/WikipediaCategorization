'''''19th-Century Music''''' is a [[United States|U.S.]] triannual music journal published by [[University of California Press]], in [[Berkeley, California]], and established in 1977. Dealing with musical life in Europe and the Americas during the era of the "long century" (ca. 1780-1920), the journal embraces a wide variety of issues encompassing aesthetics, [[hermeneutics]], theory, analysis, performance practice, gender, sexuality, reception, and historiography.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5915">{{short description|machine learning model type}}An '''associative classifier''' (AC) is a kind of [[supervised learning]] model that uses [[association rules]] to assign a target value. The term associative classification was coined by [[Bing Liu]] et al.,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Bing|last2=Hsu|first2=Wynne|last3=Ma|first3=Yiming|date=1998|title=Integrating Classification and Association Rule Mining|pages=80––86|citeseerx=10.1.1.48.8380}}&lt;/ref&gt;, in which the authors defined a model made of rules "whose right-hand side are restricted to the classification class attribute".

== Model ==
The model generated by an AC and used to label new records consists of [[association rules]], where the consequent corresponds to the class label. As such, they can also be seen as a list of "if-then" clauses: if the record matches some criteria (expressed in the left side of the rule, also called antecedent), it is then labeled accordingly to the class on the right side of the rule (or consequent).

Most ACs read the list of rules in order, and apply the first matching rule to label the new record.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thabtah|first=Fadi|date=2007|title=A review of associative classification mining|journal=The Knowledge Engineering Review|volume=22|issue=1|pages=37|doi=10.1017/s0269888907001026|issn=0269-8889}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Metrics ==
The rules of an AC inherit some of the metrics of association rules, like the support or the confidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Recent Advances in Data Mining of Enterprise Data: Algorithms and Applications|last=Liao|first=T Warren|last2=Triantaphyllou|first2=Evangelos|date=2008|publisher=WORLD SCIENTIFIC|isbn=9789812779854|series=Series on Computers and Operations Research|doi=10.1142/6689}}&lt;/ref&gt; , metrics can be used to order or filter the rules in the model&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~frans/KDD/Software/CBA/cba.html|title=CBA homepage|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to evaluate their quality.

== Implementations ==
The first proposal of a classification model made of association rules was CBA,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; although other authors had previously proposed the mining of association rules for classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ali|first=Kamal|last2=Manganaris|first2=Stefanos|last3=Srikant|first3=Ramakrishnan|date=1997-08-14|title=Partial classification using association rules|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3001392.3001412|publisher=AAAI Press|pages=115–118|series=KDD'97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors have since then proposed multiple changes to the initial model, like the addition of a redundant rule pruning phase&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wenmin Li|last2=Jiawei Han|last3=Jian Pei|title=CMAR: accurate and efficient classification based on multiple class-association rules|journal=Proceedings 2001 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining|pages=369–376|publisher=IEEE Comput.

'''Cantlop Bridge''' is a single span cast-iron road bridge over the [[Cound Brook]], located to the north of [[Cantlop]] in the parish of [[Berrington, Shropshire|Berrington]], [[Shropshire]]. It was constructed in 1818 to a design possibly by [[Thomas Telford]], having at least been approved by him,&lt;ref name=EH &gt;{{cite web
  |url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/cantlop-bridge/ |title=English heritage Website: Cantlop Bridge |accessdate=29 August 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and replaced an unsuccessful cast iron coach bridge constructed in 1812.&lt;ref name=EHD /&gt; The design of the bridge was innovative for the period, using a light-weight design of cast-iron lattice ribs to support the road deck in a single span, and appears to be a scaled-down version of a Thomas Telford bridge at [[Meole Brace]], Shropshire. The bridge is the only surviving Telford-approved cast-iron bridge in Shropshire,&lt;ref name=EH /&gt; and is a Grade II* listed building and scheduled monument. It originally carried the [[turnpike road]] from Shrewsbury to [[Acton Burnell]].

==History and Description==
Thomas Telford worked as the County Surveyor of Shropshire between 1787 to 1834, and the bridge is reported to have once held a cast iron plate above the centre of the arch inscribed with ''"Thomas Telford Esqr - Engineer - 1818"'', which is apparently visible in historic photographs, but has not been in place since at least 1985.&lt;ref name=EHD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=70128&amp;sort=4&amp;search=all&amp;criteria=cantlop&amp;rational=q&amp;recordsperpage=10 |title=English Heritage Pastscape website |accessdate=29 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009014139/http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=70128&amp;sort=4&amp;search=all&amp;criteria=cantlop&amp;rational=q&amp;recordsperpage=10 |archivedate=9 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bridge design incorporates dressed red and grey sandstone [[abutment]]s with [[ashlar]] dressings, these are slightly curved and ramped, with chamfered ashlar quoins, string courses, and moulded cornices.&lt;ref name=EHD /&gt; The structural cast-iron consists of a single segmental span with four arched lattice ribs, braced by five transverse cast-ironmembers. The road deck is formed from cast-iron metal deck plates, tarmacked over, and now finished with gravel. The original parapets have at some point been replaced with painted cast-iron railings with dograils, dogbars and shaped end balusters.&lt;ref name=EHD /&gt;

===Present-day===
The bridge today remains as a monument only, being closed to vehicular traffic. It was bypassed by a more modern adjacent concrete bridge built in the 1970s. It is in the care of [[English Heritage]] and is freely accessible to pedestrians. A layby exists for visitors to park and there is an information board.

CSWRI is departmentalised into six divisions, each attending to a specific set of activities.

===Division of Animal Genetics and Breeding===
Division of Animal Genetics and Breeding was started in 1966 under the name ''Sheep Genetic Section'' with a mandate to conduct research on improvement of indigenous breeds of sheep for wool and meat. It was renamed as Division of Animal Genetics and Breeding in 1975. Animal Genetics and Breeding  Division carried out pioneer work in the field of crossbreeding for improving the production of mutton, carpet wool, apparel wool and pelt.  Various crosses like Avikalin, Bharat Merino, Avimaans, Indian Karakul, Awassi X Malpura and Avivastra were developed at this division. Research was also carried out with indigenous goats (Marwari, Sirohi and Kutchi) to evolve milk and meat producing goats. The biochemical polymorphic studies were undertaken to study the inheritance of various blood constituents and to determine the possible association of these biochemical parameters with economic traits. Cytogenetic studies were initiated in 1982. In 1997, Garole, a prolific microsheep of West Bengal was introduced for increasing prolificacy of Malpura sheep. Marker Assisted Selection (MAS) for prolificacy has been practically used in the routine breeding programme. In 2008, Patanwadi inheritance was introduced into prolificacy project to improve the milk yield and mothering ability. Three breed prolific cross was produced in 2009 and strengthening of prolific flock is in progress.  Recently study on understanding the genetic basis of immune response variability in sheep has been initiated.   Stalwarts like Dr. M V Krishna Rao, Dr. O N Singh, Dr. R M Acharya,  Dr. R Nagercenkar,  Dr. A L  Chaudhary, Dr. R N Singh,  Dr. C L Arora, Dr. S D J Bohra,  Dr. B U Khan,  Dr. V K Singh  and  Dr. A L Arora  had  shaped the development  and progress of this division. At present Dr. Arun Kumar is head of the division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cswri.res.in/divisions_animal_genetics_breeding.asp | title=Division of Animal Genetics and Breeding | publisher=ICAR - Central Sheep and Wool Research Institute | accessdate=5 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PC Cell, [[Network Project on Sheep Improvement]] (ICAR-NWPSI)===

[[Network Project on Sheep Improvement]] (NWPSI) was initiated on to undertake survey, evaluation and improvement of indigenous sheep breeds under native environment. Different breeds of sheep are being improved through selection and inter-se mating for wool and mutton production. The mandate of NWPSI is genetic evaluation and improvement of indigenous sheep by selection. Presently, there are six ongoing centres of NWPSI including four farm based units and two field based units located at difference parts of the country.
Coordination Cell:  Project Coordinator Cell, NWPSI, ICAR-CSWRI, Avikanagar

Cooperating Units:

A.  Farm based Cooperating units

1.ARC (CSWRI), Bikaner - Marwari sheep for Carpet Wool

2.CIRG, Makhdoom - Muzaffarnagri sheep for Dual purpose

3.MPKV, Rahuri - Deccani sheep for Dual purpose

4.SVVU, Palamner - Nellore sheep for Mutton

B.  Field based Cooperating units

1.TANUVAS, Kattupakkam - Madras Red sheep for Mutton

2.ARC (CSWRI), Bikaner- Magra Sheep for Carpet wool

The objectives of NWPSI is Genetic improvement of indigenous sheep breeds by selection. The technical programme aims at improvement of indigenous sheep breeds under farm conditions wherein the male lambs are first ranked using selection index. Index incorporates body weight and wool yield at six months of age. Each field-based unit has four centres including a ram-rearing centre, covering a sheep population of about 1500 sheep per centre. The superior male lambs are selected from the farmers’ flocks on the basis of GFY1 and 6-month body weigh in Magra sheep and on six-month body weight basis in Madras Red sheep. Male lambs are initially identified at 3 month of age and are finally selected after first shearing. Selected male lambs from improver flocks are supplied for breeding to base flocks.

Breeding rams of high breeding value are produced from farm based unit every year for germplasm distribution. During the XI plan period about 900 improved breeding rams/ram lambs from five Farm Based Units were sold to different farmers/ State Govt/ NGOs for breed improvement programme and about 700 breeding rams / ram lambs were distributed in three Field Based Units for improvement of farmers flock. The Sheep Improvement Programmes will continue and efforts will be made to bring overall improvement in sheep productivity through distribution of superior germplasm and adoption of improved scientific management practices.

[[File:Macrobius, universe with the earth in the centre.jpg|thumb|300x300px|The Universe with the earth in the centre according to Macrobius (''Diagram in folio 25 recto'').]]
'''Commentary on Cicero's Dream of Scipio''' (in [[Latin]] ''Commentarii in Somnium Scipionis'') is a philosophical treatise of [[Macrobius]] based on the [[Somnium Scipionis|famous dream]] narrated in ''[[De re publica|On the republic]]'' of [[Cicero]] (Chapter VI, 9-29), in which [[Scipio Africanus|Scipion the African]] the Old appears  to his adoptive grandson, [[Scipio Aemilianus|Scipion Emiliano]], and reveals him his future destination and the one of his country, explains the rewards that await to the [[Virtue|virtuous]] man in another life, describes the universe and the place of the Earth and the man inside the universe. Macrobius, his author, does not offer an exhaustive comment of the text ''ciceroniano'', but it exposes a series of ''theories on the dreams'' from [[Neoplatonism|neoplatónic]] background, on ''the mystic properties of the numbers'', on ''the nature of the'' ''[[soul]]'', on [[astronomy]] and on [[Music]]. Macrobius quotes a lot of authorities, but is little likely that have read them all or at least the majority. [[Plotinus|Plotino]] and [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porfirio]] are his main sources and quotes frequently to [[Virgil]] with ornamental purpose. Nevertheless, the work incorporates ideas of the [[neoplatonism]], that are not conserved  in a direct form in any another place. The style is quite uneven, since Macrobius copies or translates his sources without unifying the style.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2361">'''Conceptual architecture''' is a form of architecture that utilizes [[conceptualism]], characterized by an introduction of ideas or concepts from outside of architecture often as a means of expanding the discipline of architecture. This produces an essentially different kind of building than one produced by the widely held 'architect as a master-builder' model, in which craft and construction are the guiding principles. The finished building as product is less important in conceptual architecture, than the ideas guiding them, ideas represented primarily by texts, diagrams, or art installations. Architects that work in this vein are [[Diller and Scofidio|Diller + Scofidio]], [[Bernard Tschumi]], [[Peter Eisenman]] and [[Rem Koolhaas]].

Conceptual architecture was studied in the essay, ''Notes on Conceptual Architecture: Towards a Definition'' by [[Peter Eisenman]] in 1970, and again by the Harvard Design Magazine in Fall of 2003 and Winter 2004, by a series of articles under the heading ''Architecture as Conceptual Art''. But the understanding of design as a construction of a concept was understood by many [[modern architecture|modernist architects]] as well. To quote [[Louis Kahn]] on [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]:

:''It doesn't work, it doesn't have to work. Wright had the shape conceived long before he knew what was going into it. I claim that is where architecture starts, with the concept.''&lt;ref&gt;
Louis Kahn quote from Frampton, Kenneth. ''Modern Architecture, a critical history.'' page 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Constructivism (philosophy of education)|Constructivism]]''' has been considered as a dominant paradigm, or research programme,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Imre |last=Lakatos |chapter=Falsification and the methodology of scientific research programmes |editor1-first=Imre |editor1-last=Lakatos |editor2-first=Alan |editor2-last=Musgrave |title=Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge |volume=4 |series=Proceedings of the International Colloquium in the Philosophy of Science, London, 1965 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vutfm5n6LKYC&amp;pg=PA91 |date=2 September 1970 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-09623-2 |pages=91–196}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the field of '''[[science education]]'''. The term constructivism is widely used in many fields, and not always with quite the same intention. This entry offers an account of how constructivism is most commonly understood in science education.

==Description==
Science Education is now an established field within Education, and worldwide has its own journals, conferences, university departments and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Peter J. |last=Fensham |title=The Evolution of Science Education as a Field of Research: Defining an Identity |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZE9WVALhQTAC |year=2004 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-4020-1468-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although a diverse field, a major influence on its development was research considered to be undertaken from a constructivist perspective on learning, and supporting approaches to teaching that themselves became labelled constructivist. Thus, this constructivism was largely of a psychological flavour, often drawing on the work of [[Jean Piaget]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jean |last=Piaget |title=The Child's Conception Of the World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RWZIOL0NDLwC |year=2007 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn=978-0-7425-5951-6 |edition=2nd |origyear=1929}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jean |last=Piaget |title=The Principles of Genetic Epistemology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rr-avb4T8ksC |year=1997 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-16890-8 |origyear=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Ausubel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ausubel, D.P. |title=Educational Psychology: A cognitive view |publisher=Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston |location=New York |year=1968 |isbn=978-0030696404 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert M. Gagné]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gagné, R.M. |title=The Conditions of Learning |publisher=Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston |year=1970 |isbn=978-0039100698 |edition=2nd }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jerome Bruner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jerome S. |last=Bruner |title=The Process of Education |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Iaq5R8vPujAC |year=1977 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-71001-6 |edition=2nd |origyear=1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; One influential group of science education researchers were also heavily influenced by [[George Kelly (psychologist)]]'s [[Personal Construct Theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=George |last=Kelly |title=A Theory of Personality: The Psychology of Personality Constructs |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sp5iH1deNNEC |year=1963 |publisher=W.W. Norton |isbn=978-0-393-00152-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of [[Lev Vygotsky]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=L. Lev Semenovich |last=Vygotskiĭ |title=Thought and Language |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bkz7stcdbKgC |year=1986 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-72010-6 |origyear=1934}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=L. Lev Semenovich |last=Vygotskiĭ |title=Mind in Society: The Development of Higher Psychological Processes |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RxjjUefze_oC |year=1978 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-57629-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; (since being championed in the West by [[Jerome Bruner]]) has also been increasingly influential.

These workers from psychology informed the first generation of science education researchers. Active research groups developed in centres like the [[University of Waikato]] (Aotearoa/New Zealand), [[University of Leeds]] (UK) and [[University of Surrey]] (UK), with a strong interest in students' ideas in science (formed before, or during instruction) as these were recognised as being highly influential on future learning, and so whether canonical scientific would be learnt. This work, sometimes labelled the 'alternative conceptions movement' was motivated by a series of influential publications on children's ideas in science and their implications for learning (and so for how teaching should be planned to take them into account). Whilst a range of influential papers could be cited it has been suggested that a number of seminar contributions &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Driver, R. |author2=Easley, J. |title=Pupils and paradigms: a review of literature related to concept development in adolescent science students |journal=Studies in Science Education |volume=5 |pages=61–84 |year=1978 |doi=10.1080/03057267808559857 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Driver, R. |author2=Erickson, G. |title=Theories-in-action: some theoretical and empirical issues in the study of students' conceptual frameworks in science |journal=Studies in Science Education |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=37–60 |year=1983 |doi=10.1080/03057268308559904 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gilbert, J.K. |author2=Watts, D.M. |title=Concepts, misconceptions and alternative conceptions: changing perspectives in science education |journal=Studies in Science Education |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=61–98 |year=1983 |doi=10.1080/03057268308559905 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gilbert, J.K. |author2=Osborne, R.J. |author3=Fensham, P.J. |title=Children's science and its consequences for teaching |journal=Science Education |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=623–633 |year=1982 |doi=10.1002/sce.3730660412 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Osborne, R.J. |author2=Wittrock, M.C. |title=Learning Science: a generative process |journal=Science Education |volume=67 |issue=4 |pages=489–508 |year=1983 |doi=10.1002/sce.3730670406 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in effect set out the commitments, or 'hard core' of a constructivist research programme into the learning and teaching of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Taber, K.S. |title=Beyond Constructivism: the Progressive Research Programme into Learning Science |journal=Studies in Science Education |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=125–184 |year=2006 |doi=10.1080/03057260608560222 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Taber09&gt;{{cite book |first=Keith S. |last=Taber |title=Progressing Science Education: Constructing the Scientific Research Programme Into the Contingent Nature of Learning Science |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=96tslSL3UfwC |year=2009 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-90-481-2431-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perspective was also the focus of a number of books aimed at the science education community - researchers and teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Driver, R. |title=The Pupil as Scientist? |publisher=Open University Press |location=Milton Keynes |year=1983 |isbn=978-0335101788 |oclc=10585522 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Driver, R. |author2=Guesne, E. |author3=Tiberghien, A. |title=Children's Ideas in Science |publisher=Open University Press |location=Milton Keynes |year=1985 |isbn=978-0335150403 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Paul J. |last1=Black |first2=Arthur M. |last2=Lucas |title=Children's Informal Ideas in Science |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IlxS0fBb5woC |year=1993 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-00539-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These papers presented learning as process of personal sense making, and an iterative matter such that what is learnt was channelled by existing knowledge and understanding (whether canonical or alternative), and teaching as needing to take learners' existing ideas into account in teaching. The research programme soon amounted to thousands of studies on aspects of students' (of different ages and educational levels, from different countries) thinking and learning in science topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Duit, R. |title=Bibliography—STCSE (Students' and Teachers' Conceptions and Science Education) |year=2009 |publisher=Kiel:IPN—Leibniz Institute for Science Education |url=http://www.ipn.uni-kiel.de/aktuell/stcse/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
There have been a wide range of criticisms of constructivist work in science, including strong criticism from philosophical perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Matthews, M.R. |title=Discontent With Constructivism |journal=Studies in Science Education |volume=24 |pages=165–172 |year=1994 |doi=10.1080/03057269408560045 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Scerri, E.R. |title=Philosophical confusion in chemical education research |journal=Journal of Chemical Education |volume=80 |issue=5 |pages=468–474 |year=2003 |doi=10.1021/ed080p468 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such criticisms have done little to stem the influence of the perspective, perhaps because they tend not to refer to the core tenets of constructivism as an approach based on learning theory and research from cognitive science.&lt;ref name=Taber09/&gt;

==Alternative conceptions and conceptual frameworks in science education==
Learners' ideas in science have been variously labelled as [https://camtools.cam.ac.uk/wiki/eclipse/Alternative%20conception.html alternative conceptions], alternative conceptual frameworks, preconceptions, [[scientific misconceptions]], naive theories etc. Although some scholars have attempted to distinguish between these terms, there is no consensual usage and often these terms are in effect synonymous.&lt;ref name=Taber09/&gt; It has been found that some alternative conceptions are very common, although others appear quite idiosyncratic. Some seem to be readily overcome in teaching, but others have proved to be tenacious and to offer a challenge to effective instruction. Sometimes it is considered important to distinguish fully developed conceptions (i.e., explicit ways of understanding aspects of the natural work that are readily verbalised) from more 'primitive' features of cognition acting at a tacit level, such as the so-called phenomenology primitives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=diSessa, A.A. |title=Towards an epistemology of physics |journal=Cognition and Instruction |volume=10 |issue=2–3 |pages=105–225 |year=1993 |doi=10.1080/07370008.1985.9649008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 'knowledge-in-pieces' perspective suggests the latter act as resources for new learning which have potential to support the development of either alternative or canonical knowledge according to how teachers proceed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Smith, J.P. |author2=diSessa, A.A. |author3=Roschelle, J. |title=Misconceptions reconceived: a constructivist analysis of knowledge in transition |journal=The Journal of the Learning Sciences |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=115–163 |year=1993 |doi=10.1207/s15327809jls0302_1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas alternative conceptions (or misconceptions) tend to be seen as learning impediments to be overcome. What research has shown is the prevalence among learners at all levels of alternative ways to thinking about just about all [https://camtools.cam.ac.uk/wiki/eclipse/Science%20Topics.html science topics], and a key feature of guidance to teachers is to elicit students' ideas as part of the teaching process. The success of constructivism is that this is now largely taken-for-granted in science teaching and has become part of standard teaching guidance in many contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Key Stage 3 National Strategy. (2002). Framework for teaching science: years 7, 8 and 9. London: Department for Education and Skills.&lt;/ref&gt; Previously there was a strong focus on the abstract nature of concepts to be learnt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Shayer, M. |author2=Adey, P. |title=Towards a Science of Science Teaching: Cognitive development and curriculum demand |publisher=Heinemann Educational Books |location=Oxford |year=1981 |isbn=978-0435578251 |oclc=7759952 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but little awareness that often the teacher was not seeking to replace ignorance with knowledge, but rather to modify and develop learners existing thinking which was often at odds with the target knowledge set out in the curriculum.

===Constructivist science teaching===
Constructivism is seen as an educational theory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Taber, K.S. |chapter=Constructivism as educational theory: Contingency in learning, and optimally guided instruction |chapterurl=https://camtools.cam.ac.uk/wiki/eclipse/Constructivism.html |editor=J. Hassaskhah |title=Educational Theory |publisher=Nova |year=2011 |isbn=9781613245804 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; and a key perspective to inform pedagogy. There are many books informing teachers and others about constructivist research findings and ideas, and giving guidance on how to teach science form a constructivist perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Peter J. |last1=Fensham |first2=Richard T. |last2=White |first3= |title=The Content of Science: A Constructivist Approach to Its Teaching and Learning |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cg6dlitxLm0C |year=1994 |publisher=Falmer Press |isbn=978-0-7507-0221-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Joel J. |editor1-last=Mintzes |editor2-first=James H. |editor2-last=Wandersee |editor3-first=Joseph D. |editor3-last=Novak |title=Teaching Science for Understanding: A Human Constructivist View |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2zXcrHWhnDwC |year=2005 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-08-087924-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Kenneth G. |last=Tobin |title=The Practice of Constructivism in Science Education |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=47LuS0m9heEC |date=12 November 2012 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-136-48974-7 |origyear=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=K.S. |last=Taber |title=Chemical Misconceptions: Prevention, Diagnosis, and Cure : Classroom Resources |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U_P0V8vIBhUC |year=2002 |publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry |isbn=978-0-85404-381-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''CÐ''&amp;nbsp;100, the 100th cosmological decade, lasts from 10&lt;sup&gt;100&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;101&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after Time Zero.  CÐ&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; is Time Zero.

The [[epoch (astronomy)|epoch]] ''CÐ''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;43.2683 was 10&lt;sup&gt;(&amp;minus;43.2683)&lt;/sup&gt; seconds, which represents the [[Planck time]] since the [[big bang]] (Time Zero).  There were an infinite number of cosmological decades between the Big Bang and the Planck epoch (or any other point in time).  The current epoch, ''CÐ''&amp;nbsp;17.6389, is 10&lt;sup&gt;(17.6389)&lt;/sup&gt; seconds, or 13.799(21) billion years, since the Big Bang.&lt;ref name="Planck 2015"&gt; {{cite journal

==As expressed in log (years per Ðecade)==
The cosmological decade can be expressed in log years per decade. In this definition, the 100th cosmological decade lasts from 10&lt;sup&gt;100&lt;/sup&gt; years to 10&lt;sup&gt;101&lt;/sup&gt; years after Time Zero.  To convert to this format, simply divide by seconds per year; or in logarithmic terms, subtract 7.4991116 from the values listed above. Thus when CÐ is expressed in log( years/Ð ), the Planck time could also be expressed as 10&lt;sup&gt;(&amp;minus;43.2683&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;7.4991116)&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;years = 10&lt;sup&gt;(&amp;minus;50.7674)&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;years.

In this definition, the current epoch is CÐ (17.6355&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;7.4991116), or CÐ&amp;nbsp;10.1364. As before, there have been 60.9 cosmological decades between the Planck epoch and the current epoch.

In their view, the history of the universe can be segmented into five eras:
{| class="wikitable"
! Age !! Ðecades !! Process
|-
|Primordial || &amp;minus;50 to +5 || [[Timeline of the Big Bang|from the Planck time until universe becomes transparent to radiation]]
|-

'''David S. Muir''' (born 4 January 1971) is a [[Scotland|Scottish]] marketing and [[political communications]] professional. He was Director of Political Strategy for [[British prime minister]] [[Gordon Brown]] between 2008 and 2010.

==Biography==
Muir was born in Falkirk and attended his local comprehensive [[Falkirk High School]]. In 1988 attended the [[University of Glasgow]]. In 1992 he graduated with a MA Hons 1st Class in Politics and Economics. He also won the Alistair Reid Prize for Politics for the outstanding study of politics and an ESU Scholarship to work with the US politician [[Byron Dorgan]]. He later graduated from [[London Business School]] with a [[Master of Business Administration]].

==Career==
In 1992 Muir joined the advertising agency [[Ogilvy &amp; Mather]], becoming New Business Director until taking a leave of absence to complete his MBA in 1999. In 2001 he returned to Ogilvy where he focussed on expanding the group through organic growth and acquisitions. In 2003 he wrote with Jon Miller ''The Business of Brands'', looking at how businesses could nurture and value their brands.

In 2005 he moved over to [[WPP plc|WPP]] to take over "The Channel" from Mandy Pooler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Tylee |url=http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/news/233834/Muir-takes-Channel/?DCMP=ILC-SEARCH |title=Muir takes over at The Channel - advertising news - Campaign |publisher=Campaignlive.co.uk |date=2005-01-28 |accessdate=2011-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; There he helped develop WPP's research tool Brandz where he developed the BrandZ Top 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.brandrepublic.com/blogs/ritson_on_brand/archive/2006/03/08/millward-brown-optimors-valuation-of-brands.aspx |title=Millward Brown Optimor's Valuation of Brands - Ritson on Brand - Blogs - Brand Republic |publisher=Community.brandrepublic.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at The Channel he also developed Sportz&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wpp.com/wpp/press/press/default.htm?guid={1ea68e94-3aec-45c4-b8f8-a4dc6928d17e} |title=sports specialist companies launch global sports brands study: SportZ |publisher=WPP |date=2003-03-11 |accessdate=2011-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; which allows global brands to evaluate sponsorship opportunities.

===Downing Street===
In 2008 Muir left WPP to become the British prime minister, [[Gordon Brown]]'s, Director of Political Strategy, replacing [[Spencer Livermore]] who had left&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/536926/team-brown-strengthens.thtml |title=Team Brown strengthens |publisher=The Spectator |date= |accessdate=2011-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Downing Street Muir was the Prime Ministers leading political adviser after Stephen Carter left. He along with Kirsty McNeill developed Brown's "No time for a novice speech" at the 2008 Labour Party Conference which was "warmly received".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7630567.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; UK Politics &amp;#124; No time for a novice, says Brown |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-09-23 |accessdate=2011-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4813281.ece ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513035509/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4813281.ece |date=13 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muir worked closely with [[Peter Mandelson]] and [[Philip Gould]] on the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]'s [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]] campaign. He was the lead negotiator of the historic British TV Election Debates and was an early proponent of them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wayback.vefsafn.is/wayback/20100418101319/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/election_2010/article7018474.ece ]&lt;/ref&gt;

He is believed to have argued for a hard edged attack on the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] and their threat to middle income earners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Patrick Wintour, political editor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/jul/15/peter-mandelson-memoirs-brown-economy |title=Peter Mandelson on Brown: 'We were in a pit of debt. And we kept on digging' &amp;#124; Politics |publisher=The Guardian |date= 15 July 2010|accessdate=2011-05-26 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular he pushed for the campaign to focus on the threat the Conservative's posed to child tax credits. It is also believed that he supported Gordon Brown's decision not to serve a full term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Patrick Wintour, political editor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/may/18/gordon-brown-ed-balls-resignation |title=Gordon Brown tried to announce resignation before election &amp;#124; Politics |publisher=The Guardian |date= 18 May 2010|accessdate=2011-05-26 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign denied the Conservatives an overall majority and Muir was part of small team that spent the next five days in discussions with the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]. Muir left Downing Street when Gordon Brown resigned in May 2010.

'''Dramatic structure''' is the structure of a [[drama]]tic work such as a [[Play (theater)|play]] or [[film]]. Many scholars have analyzed dramatic structure, beginning with [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (c. 335 BCE). This article looks at Aristotle's analysis of the Greek tragedy and on [[Gustav Freytag]]'s analysis of [[Theater of ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] and [[Shakespeare's plays|Shakespearean]] drama.

==History==
In his ''Poetics'', the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] philosopher Aristotle put forth the idea the play should imitate a single whole action. "A whole is what has a beginning and middle and end" (1450b27).&lt;ref name="fall2"&gt;Perseus Digital Library (2006). [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Aristot.+Poet.+1450b Aristotle, ''Poetics'']&lt;/ref&gt; He split the play into two parts: complication and unravelling.

The [[Roman Empire|Roman]] drama critic [[Horace]] advocated a 5-act structure in his [[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]: "Neue minor neu sit quinto productior actu fabula" (lines 189–190) ("A play should not be shorter or longer than five acts").

The fourth-century Roman grammarian [[Aelius Donatus]] defined the play as a three part structure, the [[protasis]], [[epitasis]], and [[Catastrophe (drama)|catastrophe]]).

In 1863, around the time that playwrights like [[Henrik Ibsen]] were abandoning the 5-act structure and experimenting with 3 and 4-act plays, the [[Germany|German]] playwright and novelist Gustav Freytag wrote ''Die Technik des Dramas'', a definitive study of the 5-act dramatic structure, in which he laid out what has come to be known as Freytag's pyramid.&lt;ref name="fall3"&gt;University of South Carolina (2006). [http://home.earthlink.net/~mr.kilgore/102/handouts/bigpicture_what.htm The Big Picture] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023073242/http://home.earthlink.net/~mr.kilgore/102/handouts/bigpicture_what.htm |date=October 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Freytag's pyramid, the plot of a story consists of five parts: [[Exposition (literary technique)|exposition]] (originally called introduction), [[rising action]] (rise), [[Climax (narrative)|climax]], [[falling action]] (return or fall), and [[dénouement]]/&lt;wbr&gt;[[wikt:resolution|resolution]]/&lt;wbr&gt;[[revelation]]/&lt;wbr&gt;[[catastrophe (drama)|catastrophe]].&lt;ref name="fall4"&gt;University of Illinois: Department of English (2006). [http://www.english.uiuc.edu/lit_resources/english%20102/miscellaneous/freytag.htm Freytag’s Triangle] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716152819/http://www.english.uiuc.edu/lit_resources/english%20102/miscellaneous/freytag.htm |date=July 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aristotle's analysis==
Many structural principles still in use by modern storytellers were explained by Aristotle in his ''Poetics''. In the part that we still have, he mostly analyzed the tragedy. A part analyzing the comedy is believed to have existed but is now lost.

Aristotle stated that the tragedy should imitate a whole action, which means that the events follow each other by probability or necessity, and that the causal chain has a beginning and an end.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1974/1974-h/1974-h.htm#link2H_4_0009 "Poetics", Project Gutenberg, Section VII]&lt;/ref&gt; There is a knot, a central problem that the protagonist must face. The play has two parts:  complication and unravelling.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1974/1974-h/1974-h.htm#link2H_4_0020 "Poetics", Project Gutenberg, Section  XVIII]&lt;/ref&gt; During complication, the protagonist finds trouble as the knot is revealed or tied; during unraveling, the knot is resolved.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1974/1974-h/1974-h.htm#link2H_4_0020 "Poetics", Project Gutenberg, Section XVIII ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two types of [[Scene (drama)|scenes]] are of special interest:  the reversal, which throws the action in a new direction, and the recognition, meaning the protagonist has an important revelation.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1974/1974-h/1974-h.htm#link2H_4_0008 "Poetics", Project Gutenberg, Section VI]&lt;/ref&gt;  Reversals should happen as a necessary and probable cause of what happened before, which implies that turning points needs to be properly set up.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1974/1974-h/1974-h.htm#link2H_4_0013 "Poetics", Project Gutenberg, Section  XI]&lt;/ref&gt;

Complications should arise from a flaw in the protagonist. In the tragedy, this flaw will be his undoing.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1974/1974-h/1974-h.htm#link2H_4_0015 "Poetics", Project Gutenberg, Section  XIII]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freytag's analysis&lt;!--'Dramatic arc' redirects here--&gt;==
[[File:Freytags pyramid.svg|thumb|250px|"Freytag's pyramid", symbolizing his theory of dramatic structure]]
According to Freytag, a drama is divided into five parts, or acts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freytag|first=Gustav|title=Die Technik des Dramas|year=1863|url=http://www.matoni.de/technik/tec_inh.htm|accessdate=2009-01-20|language=German|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116004731/http://www.matoni.de/technik/tec_inh.htm|archivedate=2009-01-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which some refer to as a '''{{visible anchor|dramatic arc}}'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;: exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and dénouement. Freytag's Pyramid can help writers organize their thoughts and ideas when describing the main problem of the drama, the rising action, the climax and the falling action.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Freytag's analysis of dramatic structure is based on five-act plays, it can be applied (sometimes in a modified manner) to short stories and novels as well, making dramatic structure a [[literary element]]. Nonetheless, the pyramid is not always easy to use, especially in modern plays such as [[Alfred Uhry]]'s ''[[Driving Miss Daisy (play)|Driving Miss Daisy]]'' and  [[Arthur Miller]]'s ''[[The Crucible]]'', which is actually divided into 25 scenes without concrete acts.

===Exposition===
{{main article|Exposition (narrative)}}

The exposition is the portion of a story that introduces important background information to the audience; for example, information about the setting, events occurring before the main plot, characters' back stories, etc. Exposition can be conveyed through dialogues, flashbacks, characters' thoughts, background details, in-universe media, or the narrator telling a back-story.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|pp=115-121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rising action===
In the rising action, a series of events build toward the point of greatest interest. The rising action of a story is the series of events that begin immediately after the exposition (introduction) of the story and builds up to the climax. These events are generally the most important parts of the story since the entire plot depends on them to set up the climax and ultimately the satisfactory resolution of the story itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|pp=125-128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climax===
{{main article|Climax (narrative)}}

The climax is the turning point, which changes the protagonist's fate. If the story is a comedy and things were going badly for the protagonist, the plot will begin to unfold in his or her favor, often requiring  the protagonist to draw on hidden inner strengths.  If the story is a tragedy, the opposite state of affairs will ensue, with things going from good to bad for the protagonist, often revealing the protagonist's hidden weaknesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|pp=128-130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Falling action===
During the falling action, the conflict between the [[protagonist]] and the [[antagonist]] unravels, with the protagonist winning or losing against the antagonist. The falling action may contain a moment of final suspense, in which the final outcome of the conflict is in doubt.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|pp=133-135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dénouement&lt;!--'Dénouement' redirects here--&gt;===
{{see also|Detective dénouement }}
The '''''dénouement'''''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; ({{IPAc-en|UK|d|eɪ|ˈ|n|uː|m|ɒ̃|,_|d|ɪ|-}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˌ|d|eɪ|n|uː|ˈ|m|ɒ̃}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/denouement?q=D%C3%A9nouement "dénouement"]. ''[[Cambridge Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|denumɑ̃|lang}}) comprises events from the end of the falling action to the actual ending scene of the drama or narrative. [[Conflict (narrative)|Conflict]]s are resolved, creating normality for the characters and a sense of [[catharsis]], or release of tension and anxiety, for the reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|pp=137-140}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Etymology|Etymologically]], the French word ''dénouement'' is derived from the word ''dénouer'', "to untie", from ''nodus'', Latin for "knot." It is the unraveling or untying of the complexities of a [[Plot (narrative)|plot]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The comedy ends with a ''dénouement'' (a conclusion), in which the protagonist is better off than at the story's outset. The tragedy ends with a catastrophe, in which the protagonist is worse off than at the beginning of the narrative. Exemplary of a comic ''dénouement'' is the final scene of [[Shakespeare]]’s comedy ''[[As You Like It]]'', in which couples marry, an evildoer repents, two disguised characters are revealed for all to see, and a ruler is restored to power. In Shakespeare's tragedies, the ''dénouement'' is usually the death of one or more characters.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==Criticism==

Freytag's analysis was intended to apply to ancient Greek and Shakespearean drama, not modern.

Contemporary dramas increasingly use the fall to increase the relative height of the climax and dramatic impact ([[melodrama]]). The protagonist reaches up but falls and succumbs to doubts, fears, and limitations. The negative climax occurs when the protagonist has an epiphany and encounters the greatest fear possible or loses something important, giving the protagonist the courage to take on another obstacle. This confrontation becomes the classic climax.&lt;ref name="modern"&gt;Teruaki Georges Sumioka: The Grammar of Entertainment Film 2005, {{ISBN|978-4-8459-0574-4}}; [http://www.hi-ho.ne.jp/sumioka-info/resouce/resouce.html lectures at Johannes-Gutenberg-University in German]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ethnocynology''', is a [[neologism]] coined by [[anthropologist]] [[Bryan Cummins]] in his book ''First Nations, First Dogs: Canadian Aboriginal Ethnocynology'' (2002).  It refers to the study of [[dog]]s within their cultural contexts.  The term is not in general use.  

Cummins states that the domestic dog, despite being found in virtually all human [[society|societies]], has been ignored by anthropologists. This, he says, is because the dog is neither fully of "[[culture]]" (being essentially a domesticated [[wolf]]), nor of "nature", by virtue of that same [[domestication]] and having been molded into over 400 [[breed]]s. Nonetheless, Cummins leans towards the view that, being domestic animals, they are more "of culture" than "of nature", and culture is the domain of the anthropologist. Furthermore, different human societies have shaped the dog into precisely whatever roles people might have for the dog. Therefore, the domestic dog is worthy of anthropological attention; hence ethnocynology.

The '''exosporium''' is the outer surface layer of mature [[spores]]. In plant spores it is also referred to as the [[exine]]. Some [[bacteria]] also produce [[endospores]] with an exosporium, of which the most commonly studied are ''[[Bacillus]]'' species, particularly ''[[Bacillus cereus]]'' and the [[anthrax]]-causing bacterium ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]''. The exosporium is the portion of the spore that interacts with the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] or [[host (biology)|host organism]], and may contain spore [[antigen]]s.&lt;ref name="redmond"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Redmond|first1=C.|title=Identification of proteins in the exosporium of Bacillus anthracis|journal=Microbiology|date=2004|volume=150|issue=2|pages=355–363|doi=10.1099/mic.0.26681-0|url=http://mic.sgmjournals.org/content/150/2/355.long}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exosporium proteins, such as Cot protein, are also discovered related to strains of B. anthracis and B.cereus. This Cot protein share similar sequences with other spore coat proteins, and their putative determinants are believed to include bxpC, lunA, exsA, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stewart|first1=George C.|title=The exosporium layer of bacterial spores: a connection to the environment and the infected host|journal=Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev.|date=December 1, 2015|volume=79|issue=4|page=437&lt;!--|pages=457--&gt;|doi=10.1128/MMBR.00050-15|pmc=4651027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Bacillus anthraces, [[salt]] and [[detergent]] washing of exosporium fragments can identify [[protein]]s that are likely to represent structural or integral exosporium proteins. Seven proteins have been identified in washed exosporium: [[alanine racemase]], [[inosine]] [[hydrolase]], ExsF, CotY, ExsY, CotB, and a novel protein, ExsK. CotY, ExsY and CotB are [[homology (biology)|homologues]] of [[Bacillus subtilis]] outer spore coat proteins, but ExsF and ExsK are specific to B. anthracis and other members of the [[Bacillus cereus]] group.&lt;ref name="redmond" /&gt;

The protein ywdL has been identified in ''B. cereus'' as important for exosporium formation. In the absence of the ywdL gene, a fragile and easily damaged exosporium is formed, which can be damaged by mechanical disruption such as [[freeze-thaw]] cycles. However, ywdL is not required to maintain the internal organization of the exosporium. ΔywdL spores have abnormal [[germination]] properties, such as the inability to respond to standard chemical means of inducing germination by treatment with [[Dipicolinic acid|calcium dipicolinate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Terry|first1=Cassandra|last2=Shepherd|first2=Andrew|last3=Radford|first3=David S.|last4=Moir|first4=Anne|last5=Bullough|first5=Per A.|title=YwdL in Bacillus cereus: Its Role in Germination and Exosporium Structure|journal=PLoS ONE|date=2011|volume=6|issue=8|pages=e23801|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0023801|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0023801|pmid=21887322|pmc=3161080}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14873">'''Forensic limnology''' is a sub-field of [[forensic botany]], which examines the presence of [[diatoms]] in crime scene samples and victims. Different methods are used to collect this data but all identify the ratios of different diatom colonies present in samples and match those samples with locations at the crime scene.&lt;ref name=Coyle /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dommelen /&gt;&lt;ref name=Horton /&gt;

==Use of diatoms==
Diatoms are diverse [[microscopic algae]] with [[silica cell walls]] that have different characteristics such as color, shape, and size. There are 8,000 known species of diatoms (without taking into account the variety of subspecies that have specialized within their specific environments). Diatoms do not have specialized nutrient and water conducting tissues, which affects their dispersion throughout ecosystems.&lt;ref name=Siver&gt;{{cite journal|last=Siver|first=P. A. |author2=Lord  W. D. |author3=McCarthy, D. J.|title=Forensic Limnology: The Use of Freshwater Algal Community Ecology to Link Suspects to an Aquatic Crime Scene in Southern New England|journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences |date=May 1994|volume=39|issue=3|pages=847–853}}&lt;/ref&gt; These microscopic organisms mainly inhabit freshwater environments because of their inability to survive with the cleaning agents present in domestic water sources.&lt;ref name=Coyle&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coyle|first=Heather Miller|author2=Carll Ladd |author3=Timothy Palmbach |author4=Henry C. Lee |title=The Green Revolution: Botanical Contributions to Forensics and Drug Enforcement|journal=Croatian Medical Journal|year=2001|issue=2001|pages=340–345}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits of Diatoms==
Diatoms are identifiable based on each species unique silica cell walls and vary depending on their environment. Because they have determinant properties diatoms create [[flora]] profiles for scientists. When these microscopic algae die, their [[frustules]] (silica cell walls) becomes a part of the water sediment. The presence of the frustules enables scientists to compare the cell walls of the deceased organisms with the living diatoms to determine characteristics of their environment. In early spring and the fall the ratio of living diatoms to dead diatoms is high, whereas, in summer and winter the amount of dead diatoms out populates the living.&lt;ref name=Coyle /&gt; Based on this known information diatoms can verify the time of year samples were taken. Different types of diatoms can also determine the properties of a samples ecosystem. For example, the higher ratio of periphytic (type of platonic diatom), the higher the vegetation concentration and shallower the water, but the higher the ratio of scaled chrysophytes a sample means the environment of that organism contains more open water.&lt;ref name=Siver /&gt; Forensic scientists can create differentiated markers on environments in the area they are collecting data based on the diatoms population growth rate, which is affected by pollutants in their water sources because the simple tissues of diatoms make them sensitive environmental changes.&lt;ref name=Rohn&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rohn|first=Edward J.|author2=Peter D. Frade|title=The role of Diatoms in medico-legal investigations II: a case for the development and testing of new modalities applicable to the diatom test for drowning|journal=Forensic Examiner|date=22 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bijaya&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bijaya|first=Kumar Padhi|author2=Jnanendra Rath |author3=Pratap Kumar Padhy |title=Diatoms for assessing the ecological condition of inland freshwater bodies|journal=World Review of Science|year=2010|volume=7|issue=4|pages=352|doi=10.1504/WRSTSD.2010.032743|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/05/100504095111.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The reason diatoms are a common tool to match water environments is because of the variability of their populations are predictable and constant, the organisms can be identified by using the [[light microscope]], and their silica cell walls allow for preservation.&lt;ref name=Dommelen /&gt;

==Disadvantages of Diatoms==
Out of the 771 cases in 2001, only 28% were fresh water drowning. Living diatoms do not inhabit domestic water sources, which limits the situations that diatoms can be used to create [[flora]] profiles or time of death estimations.&lt;ref name=Coyle /&gt; Diatoms can only tell when or where evidence was found in some situations and not the time of death if there is no body fluid sample available to be collected. If a body is placed in freshwater [[post mortem]] then diatoms cannot be used to evaluate time of death. Without the inhalation of water and some circulation present in the victim, the diatoms will not be able to enter the [[alveolar system]] and blood stream making it difficult to extract a reliable sample. Another issue with the use of diatoms in order to provide evidential support is that diatoms can also be found on clothes, in food and drink, or air. In a study conducted by Spitz and Schneider in 1964, 500 cubic meters of air was filtered for three days in April and there was between 662 and 1564 individual diatoms present on the [[filtrate]].&lt;ref name=Singh&gt;{{cite web|last=Singh|first=Rajvinder|title=M.K. Thakar|work=EXTRACTION METHODS OF DIATOMS|publisher=Department of Forensic science, Punjabi University|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because the body can preserve these microscopic algae, the presence of diatoms may not only be on a victim or suspect through their relation to a crime scene, which affects the reliability of the results collected from a scene. Diatoms can also be destroyed based on the biological make up of the body it encounters, this could affect the results in a criminal investigation.&lt;ref name=Horton&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horton|first=Benjamin P.|title=Diatoms and Forensic Science|journal=Paleontological Society Papers|date=27 October 2007|pages=14–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diatom testing==
In order to use diatom testing there are some guidelines that scientists must follow. To get a more accurate result there has to be at least 20 diatoms in a 100 microliter sample. When dealing with testing on a human body having 5 complete diatoms from more than 2 different organs will also give a positive diagnosis.&lt;ref name=Dommelen /&gt;  Samples are taken from bone marrow, lung, spleen, liver, kidney, brain tissue, or from the area where the crime was discovered or occurred.&lt;ref name=Rohn /&gt;

==Body Test==
When a body has been drowned diatoms go into the lungs and then are circulated to other internal organs through the individuals circulation.&lt;ref name=Coyle /&gt;  A forensic scientist will extract 100&amp;nbsp;g of either a tissue sample or [[bone marrow]] from a [[femur]] still attached to the victim. There are many different methods of extracting diatoms but the most commonly used method is [[acid digestion]]. This method is acknowledged worldwide, less expensive, and takes less time to get results.&lt;ref name=Singh /&gt;  Scientists boil the sample and then add 50&amp;nbsp;ml of nitric acid solution. The color of the mixture will turn from yellow to transparent.  After 48 hours when the sample has reached room temperature it is [[centrifuged]], which allows the organic matter to completely [[oxidize]], and the [[Granular material|pellet]] is extracted, mixed with [[distilled water]], and examined on a slide.&lt;ref name=Coyle /&gt;  The ratios of the different specimen of diatoms are counted, which allows scientists to match the area where the victim entered the water.&lt;ref name=Siver /&gt;

==Testing a Sample==
Materials taken from victims, suspects, or the crime scene can also be tested to match locations of where the samples derived. Environmental products, such as mud, are placed in a test tube with a sulfuric acid and potassium dichromate solution for 24 hours. After centrifuging the tube, it is then placed in a boiling water bath for an hour. After the pellet is extracted it is mixed with distilled water and mounted on a slide with Hyrax. When diatom testing on an organic sample scientists use [[phase contrast microscopy]]. While observing the diatoms are tallied and organized based on their different species. The ratio of specific specimen of diatoms in the water will have a similar ratio to the sample that is taken from the site where the diatoms were transferred. Scientists use this to match materials and people to specific locations at a crime scene. An example of when this test was used was in Connecticut, July 1991. Two boys were fishing along a river when they were bound, beaten with a baseball bat, and attempted drowning by other three teenage boys. The boys escaped to go report the attack. Forensic scientists took the clothes of the victims and the clothes of the suspects that the boys had identified. At the [[College of Connecticut]] the samples taken from the clothing and crime scene underwent diatom testing and then analyzed. The observation of the samples showed that the ratios of algae populations from each sample were about 80% similar.&lt;ref name=Siver /&gt; The transfer function approach also was applied to this case and three specific species of Eunotia were considered unique to the crime scene. All three species were found in both the victim and suspect’s clothes. The results were then used to get confessions from the suspects.&lt;ref name=Horton /&gt;

==Time of death estimation==
When using diatom testing, scientists observe the amount of diatoms present on the organism and may be able to estimate a generalized time of death. If there are less than 20 different species of colonizing diatoms, then the organism's death could have been within the previous 7 to 12 days, but, if there are more than 50 different colonies of diatoms then it is determined that death possibly occurred several weeks ago. Certain [[taxa]] of diatoms narrow the time frame to more exact dates. For example, Ankistrodesmus algae is a type of diatom that does not start to colonize on an organism till 30 days after its death. This taxon is also referred to as "late colonizers".&lt;ref name=Dommelen&gt;{{cite web|last=Dommelen|first=Jennifer Van|title=Limnology|url=http://myweb.dal.ca/jvandomm/forensicbotany/limnology.html|work=Forensic Botany|publisher=Dalhousie University|accessdate=29 September 2012|date=17 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques and methods==

{{Empty section|date=January 2014}}

==Extraction methods==
When using the  ‘’’acid digestion method’’’ scientists add [[sulfuric acid]] to the sample, let sit for 48 hours, centrifuge, mix with distilled water, and mount on slide for examination.  Because this method has the least amount of steps, it gives scientists faster and less expensive results.
The ‘’’Soluene-350 method’’’ is used only for freshwater samples. The sample is mixed with [[formalin]], rinsed and centrifuged 3 times with distilled water. Then the [[Granular material|pelletis]] removed from the test tube and added with 8ml of [[Soluene-350]], incubated at 50 degrees Celsius for 2 hours, centrifuged again, and finally mounted on a slide.&lt;ref name=Singh /&gt; 
The ‘’’Enzymatic method’’’ is used for tissue samples and because of the use of [[enzyme]] chemicals it is considered an environmentally safe method and has a smaller percentage of damaging the diatoms collected than that of the acid digestion method.&lt;ref name=Dommelen /&gt;  Concentrated [[nitric acid]] and [[Proteinase-K]], or [[peroxide]], are added to the sample for 12 hours, centrifuged twice, rinsed with distilled water, and then mounted on a slide with [[Naphrax]]. Using this form of extraction, observers  can use a [[light microscope]] when examining the results.
The ‘’’Membrane Filter method’’’ is used when there is a presence of either damaged diatoms in the sample (result of pollutants) or [[inorganic materials]]. The blood of the victim is taken and filtered through [[Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate]] and [[nitrocellulose]] membranes with decreasing pore sizes. The membranes are then dried and filtered with distilled water. After being dried the pieces of membrane that filtered the blood are examined for diatoms and [[pollen grains]].
‘’’Colloidal Silica Gradient Centrifugation method’’’ can be used with liver and lung samples. The tissue collected is added to [[saline solution|saline]] solution, centrifuged at a temperature of 12 degrees Celsius, and then added to distilled water to then be mounted on a slide and observed. 
‘’’Dry Ash method’’’ can only be applied to a [[bone marrow]] sample. Five grams of marrow is taken from a victim to be placed in a [[nitric acid]] solution and then bunt in a furnace allowing the release of diatoms to then be analyzed.&lt;ref name=Singh /&gt;

==Transfer function approach==
In order to determine the reliability of a conclusion, scientists use the transfer function approach. The sample taken from a crime scene is matched with a location at a crime scene based on the ratio of diatom species present. Because diatoms can also be in the air and transferred to people through contact, breathing, eating, and drinking forensic scientists want to establish a base line or [[percent of error]]. Samples are taken off of clothing and objects of suspects and around the area of the crime scene and then tested to see the ratio of diatom colonies present before the alleged incident occurred. Specific species of diatoms will be only common to the sample taken from the crime scene. If the person or object was at the crime scene then the presence of that specific taxa should be on the sample taken from the suspects or material. After calculating the ratio scientists then cross-examine the similarities. If there are diatom colonies present at both the scene and in the sample that are different from base line samples then it concludes the information viable.&lt;ref name=Horton /&gt;

==Diatom database==
In 2006, scientists began creating a diatom database. It is the 'fingerprint system' for diatoms. The computer recognizes different diatom species based on shape and color characteristics. The tallying of colonies present in a sample, as well as the preferences of [[flora]] for diatom colonies are in the system so that scientists can access the information. But, as of 2012 the database is not complete and not used in courts.&lt;ref name=Rohn /&gt;

==Legal application==
As of 2012, a small percentage of forensic limnology is used as evidence in courts. The presence of diatoms in air, food, drink, and close contact is not variable enough to be supportive evidence in determining locations of events. Even so, an investigation requires the use of forensic limnology in order to estimate time of death, location of drowning, and the determining of suspect. If the results of forensic limnology are not used in prosecution, the results are used to understand the crime.&lt;ref name=Rohn /&gt;

'''Gender democracy''' is a [[normative]] idea related to [[gender mainstreaming]]. Its aim is to achieve democratic conditions between men and women within society as a whole, as well as specifically within companies, bureaucracies, and other organizations. Among other things, this is realized by means of [[gender training]]s that raise awareness of existing inequalities and develop methods to [[democratization|democratize]] relations between genders. The term gender democracy was first coined and developed by German [[sociology|sociologist]] Halina Bedkowski.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linksnet.de/de/artikel/18582 Jenseits von EMMA. Oder: Wie werden das Wissen und die Diskussionen des Feminismus], ''UTOPIE kreativ.'' No. 158, Dezember 2003, pp. 1144–1146.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oi9aL8iX8NoC&amp;lpg=PA228&amp;ots=vm6Apettti&amp;dq=halina%20bendkowski&amp;pg=PA228#v=onepage&amp;q=halina%20bendkowski&amp;f=false Jeffrey J. Anderson, Eric Langenbacher, From the Bonn to the Berlin Republic] {{ISBN|978-0-85745-221-4}} - see p. 228 (footnote 23)&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the term ==

[[File:GuentherZ 2012-06-05 0068 Wien06 Johanna-Dohnal-Platz Strassentafel enthuellt.jpg|thumb|Street sign marking Vienna's Johanna-Dohnal-Platz. In 1993, the term "Geschlechterdemokratie" (gender democracy) appeared on the title of a publication edited by Johanna Dohnal - a first]]
According to Halina Bendkowski she developed the term and concept of gender democracy in the early 1990s during a "research trip to the US, which had been commissioned by Austria's Minister for Women, [[Johanna Dohal]], with the aim of identifying innovative projects against domestic violence."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linksnet.de/de/artikel/18582 Jenseits von EMMA. Oder: Wie werden das Wissen und die Diskussionen des Feminismus], ''UTOPIE kreativ.'' No. 158, Dezember 2003, pp. 1144–1146. The original German quotation reads: "...im Auftrag der österreichischen Frauenministerin Johanna Dohnal in den USA nach innovativen Projekten gegen häusliche Gewalt recherchierte"&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, in 1993, the term appeared on the title of a publication edited by the [[Austrian Federal Ministry of Education and Women's Affairs]], "Test the West: Geschlechterdemokratie und Gewalt" (Test the West: Gender Democracy and Violence).&lt;ref&gt;Test the West: Geschlechterdemokratie und Gewalt (vol. 1 of "Gewalt gegen Frauen, Frauen gegen Gewalt"), ed. by Johanna Dohnal, Bundesministerin für Frauenangelegenheiten, Wien 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

The pioneers of gender democracy refused to provide a fixed and static definition of the term. Bedkowski stated: "As soon as a term has been defined in a dictionary and recycled by other theorists, it will have lost most of its vitality. It is true, terms are alive - and this is especially true for terms that have been developed in the course of actual political conflicts."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linksnet.de/de/artikel/18582 Jenseits von EMMA. Oder: Wie werden das Wissen und die Diskussionen des Feminismus], ''UTOPIE kreativ.'' No. 158, Dezember 2003, pp. 1144–1146. The original German quotation reads: "Sobald Begriffe lexikalisch erfasst und theorierecycelt sind, haben sie ihr vitales Leben schon meist hinter sich. Ja, auch Begriffe leben, besonders die, die für und in politischen Realauseinandersetzungen gewonnen worden sind."&lt;/ref&gt; Gunda Werner, who in 1999 outlined the basic tenets of gender democracy for the [[Heinrich Böll Foundation]], explained: "Gender democracy has no ready-made theoretical or practical precepts. It is an exploratory movement in search of new outlooks and models."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwi-boell.de/sites/default/files/uploads/2014/04/zehn_thesen_von_gunda_werner_zu_geschlechterdemokratie_1999.pdf Gunda Werner: Geschlechterdemokratie 2000. Zehn Thesen zur Diskussion], PDF, October 1999The original German quotation reads: "Die Geschlechterdemokratie hat weder fertige praktische noch theoretische Konzepte. Sie ist eine Suchbewegung nach neuen Orientierungen und Modellen."&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, some of the fundamentals of gender democracy can be defined:

* Gender democracy is a normative precept, that is, an absolute moral and ethical [[axiom|postulate]].
* Gender democracy posits that the principles of democracy should not be limited to the sphere of politics but equally apply to the workplace and to personal life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwi-boell.de/en/2012/01/10/gender-democracy-goal-and-organisational-principle Gender democracy as a goal and an organisational principle], Gunda Werner Institute, January 2012. See the following statement: "Gender democracy must be realised on all levels of society: on a political, social and organisational level as well as on the level of everyday interactions. On a social and personal level this also means leaving behind structural patterns of hegemonic masculinity which continue to shape career paths and hierarchies in many companies and institutions."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Goals and methods ==

Gender democracy aims to achieve the equal participation of women and men in politics, the corporate world, and in all parts of society by reforming and abolishing undemocratic structures and all forms of power that are based on oppression and violence. This approach is based on a broad definition of democracy - one that demands equal rights and opportunities for people in all their diversity. As there is a large number of [[gender identity|gender identities]], gender democracy rejects the male // female [[dichotomy]], arguing instead that each human being - female, male, or otherwise - must have the right and the ability to self-determine their lifestyles, type of relationships in ways that go beyond stereotypical notions and any type of [[essentialism]] about men and women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwi-boell.de/en/2012/01/10/gender-democracy-goal-and-organisational-principle Gender democracy as a goal and an organisational principle], Gunda Werner Institute, January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender democracy investigates and questions structures and contents of democratic systems that were developed by men in order to transform them in ways that provide for gender equality. A key tool for implementing gender democracy are the so-called "gender traings" that aim to question traditional gender roles, analyze the social framework, and develop methods that provide for greater gender equality within organizations.

== Gender democracy within organizations ==

The following are some examples for organizations that have made gender democracy part of their institutional structures:

* The statutes of the [[Heinrich Böll Foundation]] define gender democracy as a "joint task"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.boell.de/de/1989/index-309.html Satzung der Heinrich-Böll-Stiftung] § 2(3) states: "Ein besonderes Anliegen ist ihr die Verwirklichung von Geschlechterdemokratie als ein von Abhängigkeit und Dominanz freies Verhältnis der Geschlechter. Diese Gemeinschaftsaufgabe ist sowohl für die interne Zusammenarbeit als auch für die öffentliche Tätigkeit aller Bereiche ein maßgebliches Leitbild." ('A prime objective is to make gender democracy a reality, that is, relations between the genders that are free of dependency and dominance. This joint task guides all aspects of our organizational development as well as our public activities.')&lt;/ref&gt;
* The German trade union [[ver.di]] has defined the "realization of gender democracy" as one of its aims.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.verdi.de/++file++5073a207deb5011af9001810/download/ver.di-Satzung.pdf Satzung ver.di - Vereinte Dienstleistungsgewerkschaft] PDF, September 2015. § 5.3(f) states: "Zur Erreichung dieser Ziele dienen insbesondere: Verwirklichung der Geschlechterdemokratie und der gleichberechtigten Teilhabe von Frauen und Männern in Betrieb, Wirtschaft, Gesellschaft und Politik, auch unter Anwendung des Gender Mainstreaming." ('To achieve these aims, gender democracy and the equitable participation of women and men in the workplace, the business world, society, and politics has to be put into practice, including through the use of gender mainstreaming.'&lt;/ref&gt;
* The statutes of the German political party [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] contain a paragraph titled "gender democracy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.die-linke.de/partei/dokumente/bundessatzung-der-partei-die-linke/2-die-basis-der-partei/10-geschlechterdemokratie/ Bundessatzung der Partei Die Linke. § 10 Geschlechterdemokratie]&lt;/ref&gt;

The online encyclopedia [[Wikipedia]] has, since the late 2000s, served as a popular source for health information for both laypersons and, in many cases, health care practitioners. Health-related articles on Wikipedia are popularly accessed as [[search engine result page|results]] from [[search engines]], which frequently deliver links to Wikipedia articles.&lt;ref name="laurent"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Laurent | first1 = M.

The [[English-language Wikipedia]] was estimated in 2014 to hold around 25,000 articles on health-related topics.&lt;ref name="around half"&gt;{{cite web |title=Around half of Wikipedia's medical editors are experts |url=https://blog.wikimedia.org/2014/12/05/around-half-of-wikipedias-medical-editors-are-experts/ |work=Wikimedia Blog |first=Nusa |last=Faric |date=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Across Wikipedia encyclopedias in all languages there were 155,000 health articles using 950,000 citations to sources and which collectively received 4.8 billion pageviews in 2013.&lt;ref name="HeilmanWest2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heilman|first1=James M|last2=West|first2=Andrew G|title=Wikipedia and Medicine: Quantifying Readership, Editors, and the Significance of Natural Language|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|volume=17|issue=3|year=2015|pages=e62|issn=1438-8871|doi=10.2196/jmir.4069|pmid=25739399|pmc=4376174}}&lt;/ref&gt; This amount of traffic makes Wikipedia one of the most consulted health resources in the world, or perhaps the most consulted resource.&lt;ref name="HeilmanWest2015"/&gt;

==Amount of health content==
As of the end of 2013, the English Wikipedia had 29,072 medical articles, while across all language versions of Wikipedia, there were 155,805 medical articles.&lt;ref name="HeilmanWest2015"/&gt; As of March 2017, the English Wikipedia had 30,000 medical articles, while there were 164,000 medical articles in other languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shafee |first1=Thomas |last2=Masukume |first2=Gwinyai |last3=Kipersztok |first3=Lisa |last4=Das |first4=Diptanshu |last5=Häggström |first5=Mikael |last6=Heilman |first6=James |date=November 2017 |title=Evolution of Wikipedia's medical content: past, present and future |url=http://jech.bmj.com/content/71/11/1122 |journal=Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health |volume=71 |issue=11 |pages=1122–1129 |doi=10.1136/jech-2016-208601|pmid=28847845 |pmc=5847101 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, there were about 6,000 anatomy articles on the English Wikipedia;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ledger |first1=Thomas Stephen |date=September 2017 |title=Introduction to anatomy on Wikipedia |journal=Journal of Anatomy |volume=231 |issue=3 |pages=430–432 |doi=10.1111/joa.12640|pmid=28703298 }}&lt;/ref&gt; these are not classified as "medical articles" in Wikipedia's categorization scheme and thus are not included in the 30,000 figure above.&lt;ref name="HeilmanWest2015"/&gt;

==Academic studies==

===Accuracy and usefulness===
A 2007 study examined a sample of Wikipedia pages about the most frequently performed surgical procedures in the United States, and found that 85.7% of them were appropriate for patients and that these articles had "a remarkably high level of internal validity".&lt;ref name=jacs&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Devgan|first1=Lara|last2=Powe|first2=Neil|last3=Blakey|first3=Brittony|last4=Makary|first4=Martin|title=Wiki-Surgery?

A 2008 study reported that drug information on Wikipedia "has a more narrow scope, is less complete, and has more errors of omission" than did such information on the traditionally edited online database [[Medscape Drug Reference]].&lt;ref name="clauson"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clauson|first1=K. A|last2=Polen|first2=H. H|last3=Boulos|first3=M. N K.|last4=Dzenowagis|first4=J.

A 2011 assessment of 50 medical articles on Wikipedia found that 56% of the references cited on these pages could be considered reputable, and that each entry contained 29 reputable sources on average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haigh|first1=CA|title=Wikipedia as an evidence source for nursing and healthcare students.|journal=Nurse Education Today|date=February 2011|volume=31|issue=2|pages=135–9|doi=10.1016/j.nedt.2010.05.004|pmid=20646799}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 study examined Wikipedia pages about five [[statin]]s, and concluded that these pages did not contain incorrect or misleading information, but that they were often missing information about drug interactions and contraindications to use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kupferberg|first1=N|last2=Protus|first2=BM|title=Accuracy and completeness of drug information in Wikipedia: an assessment.|journal=Journal of the Medical Library Association : JMLA|date=October 2011|volume=99|issue=4|pages=310–3|pmid=22022226|doi=10.3163/1536-5050.99.4.010|pmc=3193353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another 2011 study examining Wikipedia articles on the 20 most widely prescribed drugs found that seven of these articles did not have any references, and concluded that "Wikipedia does not provide consistently accurate, complete, and referenced medication information."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lavsa|first1=Stacey M.|last2=Corman|first2=Shelby L.|last3=Culley|first3=Colleen M.|last4=Pummer|first4=Tara L.|title=Reliability of Wikipedia as a medication information source for pharmacy students|journal=Currents in Pharmacy Teaching and Learning|date=April 2011|volume=3|issue=2|pages=154–158|doi=10.1016/j.cptl.2011.01.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 scoping review published in the ''[[Journal of Medical Internet Research]]'' summarized the existing evidence about the use of wikis, Wikipedia and other collaborative writing applications in health care and found that the available research publications were observational reports rather than the primary research studies which would be necessary to begin drawing conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Wikis and Collaborative Writing Applications in Health Care: A Scoping Review|url = http://www.jmir.org/2013/10/e210/|journal = [[Journal of Medical Internet Research]]|date = 8 October 2013|pmc = 3929050|pmid = 24103318|volume = 15|issue = 10|doi = 10.2196/jmir.2787|first = Patrick M|last = Archambault|first2 = Tom H van de|last2 = Belt|first3 = Francisco J Grajales|last3 = III|first4 = Marjan J|last4 = Faber|first5 = Craig E|last5 = Kuziemsky|first6 = Susie|last6 = Gagnon|first7 = Andrea|last7 = Bilodeau|first8 = Simon|last8 = Rioux|first9 = Willianne LDM|last9 = Nelen|page = e210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 study comparing the coverage of the [[MMR vaccine controversy|autism-vaccine controversy]] on several websites found that Wikipedia's articles were broadly pro-vaccine.

A 2014 study found that Wikipedia's article on [[Parkinson's disease]] had a [[Flesch–Kincaid readability tests#Flesch reading ease|Flesch reading ease]] score of 30.31, meaning that it was difficult to read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brigo|first1=F|last2=Erro|first2=R|title=The readability of the English Wikipedia article on Parkinson's disease|journal=Neurological Sciences|volume=36|issue=6|pages=1045–6|date=18 January 2015|pmid=25596713|doi=10.1007/s10072-015-2077-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===General public===

A 2015 study compared the popularity of Wikipedia's articles on ten of the most common neurological disorders over a 90-day period from April 2014 to July 2014; it found that there was no relationship between the incidence or prevalence of a neurological disorder and the number of page views it received. For example, Wikipedia's article on [[multiple sclerosis]] was far more popular than its articles on more common disorders like [[migraine]], [[epilepsy]], or [[stroke]]. The authors theorized that this might be due to the increasing prevalence of [[MRI scans]], which has led to an increase in incidental findings of [[white matter lesion]]s. Although most of these lesions have nothing to do with multiple sclerosis, they may lead patients, relatives, and even physicians to perform Internet searches on "multiple sclerosis", which may lead them to the Wikipedia article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brigo |first1=Francesco  |last2=Igwe |first2=Stanley C. |last3=Nardone |first3=Raffaele |last4=Lochner |first4=Piergiorgio |last5=Tezzon |first5=Freudiano |last6=Otte |first6=Willem M. |date=2015 |title=Wikipedia and neurological disorders |url=https://www.jocn-journal.com/article/S0967-5868(15)00099-5/fulltext |journal=Journal of Clinical Neuroscience |volume=22 |issue=7 |pages=1170–1172 |doi=10.1016/j.jocn.2015.02.006|pmid=25890773  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical students===
Wikipedia's health information has been described as "transforming how our next doctors learn medicine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/columns/2013/11/18/wikipedia-role-medical-education-brings-awesome-promise-and-few-risks/iasrC5cWfCPhWkF9R0mZ4L/story.html |title=Wikipedia's role in medical education brings awesome promise — and a few risks |first=Nathaniel P. |last=Morris |work=bostonglobe.com |date=18 November 2013 |accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various commentators in health education have said that Wikipedia is popular among medical students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Teunis|first1=Teun|title=The Wikipedia Guide to Medicine Could the Online Encyclopaedia Provide the Basis for a New Medical School Curriculum?|journal=Student BMJ|date=March 2013|volume=21|pages=16–17|doi=10.1136/sbmj.f1091|url=http://student.bmj.com/student/view-article.html?id=sbmj.f1091|doi-broken-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 study done at a single medical school showed that 97% of students used Wikipedia to study medicine, with the most common reasons being ease of access and ease of understanding. There was no relationship between a student's year in medical school and his or her use of Wikipedia, but students further along in medical school were less likely to use Wikipedia as their first resource, only resource, or most common resource; they were also more likely to perceive Wikipedia as unreliable.&lt;ref name="AllahwalaNadkarni2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allahwala|first1=Usaid K.|last2=Nadkarni|first2=Aniket|last3=Sebaratnam|first3=Deshan F.|title=Wikipedia use amongst medical students – New insights into the digital revolution|journal=Medical Teacher|volume=35|issue=4|year=2013|pages=337|issn=0142-159X|doi=10.3109/0142159X.2012.737064|pmid=23137251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[UCSF School of Medicine]] began to offer fourth-year medical students a month-long elective centered around improving Wikipedia's health-related articles. Between 2013 and 2015, 43 students took part in the course and chose a single health-related article to work on. A study of their contributions by UCSF faculty found that the students expanded their articles, added higher-quality sources, removed lower-quality sources, and improved readability. The study's authors argued that medical schools should encourage students to contribute to Wikipedia, both to improve the quality of its content and to enable students to become better health care educators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Azzam |first1=A |last2=Bresler |first2=D |last3=Leon |first3=A |last4=Maggio |first4=L |last5=Whitaker |first5=E |last6=Heilman |first6=J |last7=Orlowitz |first7=J |last8=Swisher |first8=V |last9=Rasberry |first9=L |last10=Otoide |first10=K |last11=Trotter |first11=F |last12=Ross |first12=W |last13=McCue |first13=JD |title=Why Medical Schools Should Embrace Wikipedia: Final-Year Medical Student Contributions to Wikipedia Articles for Academic Credit at One School. |journal=Academic Medicine |date=February 2017 |volume=92 |issue=2 |pages=194–200 |doi=10.1097/ACM.0000000000001381 |pmid=27627633 |pmc=5265689}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 study of five European medical schools found that students who used Wikipedia for general information were more likely to use it to look up medical information. 16% of students used Wikipedia often for general information, 60% sometimes, and 24% rarely. 12% of students used Wikipedia often for medical information, 55% sometimes, and 33% rarely. Almost all of the students (97%) found inaccurate information on Wikipedia at least once, but less than 20% of them corrected it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Herbert |first1=Verena G. |last2=Frings |first2=Andreas |last3=Rehatschek |first3=Herwig |last4=Richard |first4=Gilbert |last5=Leithner |first5=Andreas |date=2015 |title=Wikipedia – challenges and new horizons in enhancing medical education |journal=BMC Medical Education |volume=15 |issue=32 |pages= 32|doi=10.1186/s12909-015-0309-2|pmid=25879421 |pmc=4384304 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 study of online resource use by first-year medical students at [[Melbourne Medical School]] found that they used the school's online learning platform most often (daily) and used Google and Wikipedia slightly less often (approximately daily). The students considered the learning platform to be most useful, followed by Google and Wikipedia, which they considered slightly less useful than the learning platform but significantly more useful than Facebook or [[Google Scholar]]. They also considered the learning platform to be the most reliable and considered Google and Wikipedia to be significantly less reliable, although they frequently used both websites as a starting point for finding information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Judd |first1=Terry |last2=Elliott |first2=Kristine |date=2017 |title=Selection and Use of Online Learning Resources by First-Year Medical Students: Cross-Sectional Study |url=http://mededu.jmir.org/2017/2/e17/ |journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research I |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=e17 |doi=10.2196/mededu.7382|pmid=28970187 |pmc=5643842 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 study of resources used by medical students during their general surgery [[Clinical clerkship|clerkship]] at the [[University of Florida College of Medicine]] found that review books were the most commonly used type of study resource, followed by the Internet. Wikipedia was the third-most commonly used resource and the most commonly used Internet resource. The study found no correlation between the type of resource used and students' performance on the NBME surgery subject exam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Taylor |first1=Janice A. |last2=Shaw |first2=Christiana M. |last3=Tan |first3=Sanda A. |last4=Falcone |first4=John L. |date=2017 |title=Are the kids alright?

===Residents===
A 2009 study of Internet use by 35 [[junior doctors]] in the United Kingdom found that 80% of them used Google and 70% of them used Wikipedia to look up medical information at least once a week, while only 30% used [[PubMed]]. Google and Wikipedia were primarily used for background reading, while PubMed and other "best evidence" websites were used to answer specific questions for clinical decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hughes |first1=Benjamin |last2=Joshi |first2=Indra |last3=Lemonde |first3=Hugh |last4=Wareham |first4=Jonathan |date=October 2009 |title=Junior physician's use of Web 2.0 for information seeking and medical education: A qualitative study |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386505609000756?via%3Dihub |journal=International Journal of Medical Informatics |volume=78 |issue=10 |pages=645–655 |doi=10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2009.04.008|pmid=19501017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 survey of psychiatry residents at [[Harvard Medical School]] found that they used online resources twice as often as they used printed resources. The three most commonly used resources were UpToDate, [[PubMed]], and Wikipedia. UpToDate was the most used resource and was considered to be the most trustworthy, while PubMed was the second most used resource and was highly rated as a source of personal learning. Wikipedia was the third most used resource and received the highest ranking for ease of use; however, it was considered the least trustworthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Torous |first1=John |last2=Franzen |first2=Jamie |last3=O’Connor |first3=Ryan |last4=Mathew |first4=Ian |last5=Keshavan |first5=Matcher |last6=Kitts |first6=Robert |last7=Boland |first7=Robert |date=2015 |title=Psychiatry Residents' Use of Educational Websites: A Pilot Survey Study |journal=Academic Psychiatry |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=630–633 |doi=10.1007/s40596-015-0335-8|pmid=26077007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physicians and other health professionals===
A 2014 study of 259 health professionals in Spain found that while 53% of them used the [[Spanish Wikipedia]] to look up medical information during work, only 3% of them considered it reliable and only 16% recommended it to their patients. Only 16% had ever edited a Wikipedia article; the most common reasons for not doing were that they did not consider themselves an expert (51%), they preferred to blog or publish peer-reviewed articles (21%), and they were concerned that someone would undo any contributions they made (17%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Santillán |first1=Azucena |last2=Máñez |first2=Miguel Ángel |last3=Meijome |first3=Xose Manuel |date=2014 |title=Uso de Wikipedia por los profesionales de la salud |trans-title=Use of Wikipedia by health professionals |url=http://www.gacetasanitaria.org/es/uso-wikipedia-por-los-profesionales/articulo/S0213911114001964/ |language=Spanish |journal=Gaceta Sanitaria |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=522 |doi=10.1016/j.gaceta.2014.04.014|pmid=25087118 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic citations===
Wikipedia has been inappropriately cited as an authoritative source in many health science journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bould|first=M. D.|author2=Hladkowicz, E. S. |author3=Pigford, A.-A.

===Impact on psychological tests===
In 2009 a doctor and Wikipedia editor, [[James Heilman]], incorporated [[public domain]] images of the [[Rorschach test]] into Wikipedia.&lt;ref name="rorschach"&gt;

==Nature of contributors==
A 2014 interview study found that around half of the editors of health-related content on the English-language Wikipedia are health care professionals, while the other half includes some medical students.&lt;ref name="around half" /&gt; An author of this study wrote that this provides "reassurance about the reliability of the website".&lt;ref name="around half" /&gt; The study also found that the "core editor community", who actively monitor and edit most health-related articles on the English-language Wikipedia, numbered around 300 people.&lt;ref name="FaričPotts2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farič|first1=Nuša|last2=Potts|first2=Henry WW|title=Motivations for Contributing to Health-Related Articles on Wikipedia: An Interview Study|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|volume=16|issue=12|year=2014|pages=e260|issn=1438-8871|doi=10.2196/jmir.3569|pmid=25498308|pmc=4275502}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that people who contribute on these topics do so for a variety of reasons, including a desire to better learn the subjects themselves, and a sense of both responsibility and enjoyment in improving others' access to health information.&lt;ref name="FaričPotts2014"/&gt;

A 2016 study found that Wikipedia editors who contributed to articles on [[designer drug]]s were most likely to also contribute to articles on illegal drugs and pharmaceutical drugs, implying that they have a background in pharmacology. They were also more likely to contribute to articles on neurological disorders, psychiatric disorders, other diseases, and cell biology; they were least likely to edit articles about popular culture topics or history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dijkstra |first1=Louis J. |last2=Krieg |first2=Lisa J. |date=2016 |title=From MDMA to Lady Gaga: Expertise and contribution behavior of editing communities on Wikipedia |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050916326801 |journal=Procedia Computer Science |volume=1 |pages=96–106 |doi=10.1016/j.procs.2016.11.013|bibcode=2010ProCS...1.1119G |arxiv=1005.5384 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traffic statistics in health monitoring==
Just as [[Google Flu Trends]] was able to correlate searches for flu to local [[outbreaks]] of [[flu]], page views of Wikipedia articles on flu-related topics have been found to increase in populations experiencing the spread of flu,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McIver|first=David J.|author2=Brownstein, John S. |author3=Salathé, Marcel |title=Wikipedia Usage Estimates Prevalence of Influenza-Like Illness in the United States in Near Real-Time|journal=[[PLoS Computational Biology]]|date=17 April 2014|volume=10|issue=4|pages=e1003581|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003581|pmid=24743682 |pmc=3990502|bibcode=2014PLSCB..10E3581M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.technologyreview.com/view/532246/how-wikipedia-data-is-revolutionizing-flu-forecasting/ |title=How Wikipedia Data Is Revolutionizing Flu Forecasting |author=none listed |work=[[MIT Technology Review]] |date=3 November 2014 |accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of other diseases such as [[dengue fever]] and [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Generous|first1=Nicholas|last2=Fairchild|first2=Geoffrey|last3=Deshpande|first3=Alina|last4=Del Valle|first4=Sara Y.|last5=Priedhorsky|first5=Reid|last6=Salathé|first6=Marcel|title=Global Disease Monitoring and Forecasting with Wikipedia|journal=PLoS Computational Biology|date=13 November 2014|volume=10|issue=11|pages=e1003892|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003892|pmid=25392913|pmc=4231164|bibcode=2014PLSCB..10E3892G|arxiv=1405.3612}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-30021644 | title=Wikipedia 'foresees virus outbreaks' | newspaper=BBC News | date=13 November 2014 | accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects to improve health information on Wikipedia==
In 2009 the [[National Institutes of Health]] attempted a pilot project for integrating health information into Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Heterosexism''' is a system of [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], [[bias]], and [[discrimination]] in favor of opposite-sex [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and relationships.&lt;ref name="JungSmith"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jung|first=Patricia Beattie|author2=Smith, Ralph F.|title=Heterosexism: An Ethical Challenge|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=1993|isbn=0-7914-1696-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It can include the presumption that other people are [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] or that opposite-sex attractions and relationships are the only [[Norm (social)|norm]]&lt;ref name="Cramer2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Elizabeth Cramer|title=Addressing Homophobia and Heterosexism on College Campuses|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dqAAAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1|date=5 March 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-82328-5|page=2|quote=The definition for heterosexism that I used for authors in the collection is: The expectation that all persons should be or are heterosexual.

Although heterosexism is defined in the online editions of the ''[[American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'' and the ''[[Webster's Dictionary|Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary]]'' as anti-gay [[discrimination]] or prejudice "by heterosexual people"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/heterosexism|title=Yahoo|publisher=|accessdate=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "by heterosexuals",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/heterosexism|title=Definition of HETEROSEXISM|publisher=|accessdate=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively, people of any [[sexual orientation]] can hold such attitudes and bias, and can form a part of [[internalized homophobia|internalised hatred]] of one's sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ego.thechicagoschool.edu/s/843/images/editor_documents/heterosexism.doc |title=Heterosexism and Internalized Heterosexism |author=Kira Weidner |accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heterosexism as discrimination ranks [[gay]] men, [[lesbian]]s, [[bisexual]]s and other sexual minorities as [[second-class citizen]]s with regard to various legal and [[civil rights]], economic opportunities, and [[social equality]] in many of the world's jurisdictions and societies. Heterosexism is often related to [[homophobia]].

== Background ==
While the ''[[Webster's Dictionary|Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary]]'' notes first use of the term heterosexism as having occurred in 1972, the term was first published in 1971 by [[gay rights activist]], [[Craig Rodwell]].&lt;ref&gt;Rodwell, Craig. ' 'The Tarnished Golden Rule' ' pg. 5, QQ Magazine, Queen's Quarterly Publishing, New York. (January/February 1971 issue, Vol. 3, No. 1) Retrieved July 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology and usage===
Similar terms include "heterocentrism" and "heterosexualism".&lt;ref&gt;Corsini, Raymond J. (1992). ''The Dictionary of Psychology''. {{ISBN|1-58391-328-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the well-established term ''heterosexism'' is often explained as a [[Neologism|coinage]] modeled on ''[[sexism]]'', the derivation of its meaning points more to (1.) ''heterosex(ual)'' + ''-ism'' than (2.) ''hetero-'' + ''sexism''. In fact, the word ''heterosexualism'' has been used as an equivalent to sexism and racism.&lt;ref name="psychology.ucdavis.edu"/&gt;

Given this lack of [[Transparency (linguistic)#Descriptive|semantic transparency]], researchers, outreach workers, [[critical theorists]] and [[LGBT]] activists have proposed and use terms such as ''institutionalized homophobia'', ''state(-sponsored) homophobia'',&lt;ref&gt;International Lesbian and Gay Association. [http://www.ilga.org/news_results.asp?LanguageID=1&amp;FileID=1058&amp;FileCategory=10&amp;ZoneID=7 "State-sponsored Homophobia"]&lt;/ref&gt; ''sexual prejudice'', ''anti-gay [[bigotry]]'', ''[[straight privilege]]'', ''[[La pensée straight|The Straight Mind]]'' (a collection of essays by French writer [[Monique Wittig]]), ''heterosexual bias'', ''[[compulsory heterosexuality]]''&lt;ref&gt;LGBTQ on-line encyclopedia of gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and queer culture&lt;/ref&gt; or the much lesser known terms ''heterocentrism'', ''[[homonegativity]]'', and from [[gender theory]] and [[queer theory]], ''[[heteronormativity]]''. However, not all of these descriptors are synonymous to ''heterosexism''.

===Contrast to homophobia===

''[[Homophobia]]'', a form of heterosexism, refers both to "unreasoning fear of or [[antipathy]] towards homosexuals and homosexuality"&lt;ref name=dictionary.com&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/homophobia|title=Dictionary.com|accessdate=2008-01-29|year=2008|publisher=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to "behavior based on such a feeling".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/homophobia |title=homophobia - Dictionary definition and pronunciation - Yahoo! Education |publisher=Education.yahoo.com |accessdate=2014-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204061410/http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/homophobia |archivedate=2013-12-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Heterosexism'', however, more broadly denotes the "system of ideological thought that makes heterosexuality the sole norm to follow for sexual practices".&lt;ref name="granddictionnaire.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.granddictionnaire.com/ficheOqlf.aspx?Id_Fiche=8373795#eng |title=Accueil |publisher=Granddictionnaire.com |date=2013-05-13 |accessdate=2014-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a bias favoring heterosexuals and heterosexuality, heterosexism has been described as being "encoded into and characteristic of the major social, cultural, and economic institutions of our society"&lt;ref&gt;Dines, Gail (2002). ''Gender, Race, and Class in Media: A Text-Reader''. {{ISBN|0-7619-2261-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and stems from the [[essentialist]] cultural notion that [[maleness]]-[[masculinity]] and femaleness-[[femininity]] are complementary.

Researcher, author, and psychology professor Gregory M. Herek states that "[Heterosexism] operates through a dual process of invisibility and attack. Homosexuality usually remains culturally invisible; when people who engage in homosexual behavior or who are identified as homosexual become visible, they are subject to attack by society."&lt;ref name="psychology.ucdavis.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/HTML/prej_defn.html |author= Gregory M. Herek

"Inside the Minds of People Who Hate Gays" Retrieved May 29, 2008: https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/assault/roots/franklin.html&lt;/ref&gt; She continues by saying that "assaults on homosexuals and other individuals who deviate from [[Gender role|sex role]] norms are viewed as a learned form of [[social control]] of deviance rather than a defensive response to personal threat."&lt;ref name="Franklin"/&gt;

===Parallels and intersections===
{{Rquote|right|Using the term heterosexism highlights the parallels between antigay sentiment and other forms of prejudice, such as [[racism]], [[antisemitism]], and [[sexism]].  |[[Gregory M. Herek]], researcher, author, and professor of psychology at [[University of California at Davis|UC Davis]].|&lt;ref name="psychology.ucdavis.edu"/&gt;}}

It has been argued that the concept of heterosexism is similar to the concept of [[racism]] in that both ideas promote privilege for dominant groups within a given society. For example, borrowing from the racial concept of [[white privilege]], the concept of [[heterosexual privilege]]&lt;ref name="genderknot149"&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Allan J.|title=The Gender Knot|publisher=Temple University Press|location=Philadelphia|year=1997|page=149|isbn=1-56639-519-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been applied to benefits of (presumed) heterosexuality within society that heterosexuals take for granted. The analogy is that just as racism against non-white people places white people as superior to [[Person of color|people of color]], heterosexism places heterosexual people or relationships as superior to [[non-heterosexual]] ones. In trying to rebut this premise, some commentators point to differences&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.bet.com/news/youthvote/4-reasons-why-gay-is-not-the-new-black/4|title=Celebrities|publisher=|accessdate=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; between the categories of race and sexual orientation, claiming they are too complex to support any generalizations.  For example, "[[Diversity training|trainer on diversity]]" and consultant Jamie Washington has commented, although heterosexism and racism are "woven from the same fabric" they are "not the same thing".&lt;ref&gt;[http://susquehanna.edu/crusader/article.cfm?IssueID=59&amp;SectionID=1&amp;ArticleID=2573 Issues of race and sexuality discussed, Susquehanna Crusader Online, accessed Aug 29, 2009 ]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some American Conservative leaders such as [http://www.laprogressive.com/author/rev.-irene-monroe/ Rev. Irene Monroe] comment that those who suggest or state "gay is the new black", as in a cover story of ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.advocate.com/exclusive_detail_ektid65744.asp Gay is the New Black, accessed Aug 30, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; exploit [[black people]]'s suffering and experiences to legitimize their own.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irenemonroe.com/2008/12/16/gay-is-not-the-new-black/ Gay is NOT the new Black, accessed Aug 29, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, a study presented at the [[British Psychological Society]]'s Division of Occupational Psychology 2009 Conference shows that heterosexist prejudice is more pervasive than racism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bps.org.uk/media-centre/press-releases/releases$/division-of-occupational-psychology/prejudice-study-finds-gay-is-the-new-black.cfm Prejudice study finds gay is the new black, accessed Sept 3, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Heterosexism can also [[Intersectionality|intersect]] with racism by further emphasizing differences among arbitrary groups of people.&lt;ref name="tatum22"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tatum|first=Beverly|title=Why are all the Black kids sitting together in the cafeteria?|publisher=Basic Books|year=1997|pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, heterosexism can compound the effects of racism by:
* promoting injustices towards a person already facing injustices because of their race
* establishing [[social hierarchies]] that allow one group more privilege than other groups.

Likewise, racism can allow LGBT people to be subjected to additional discrimination or violence if they belong to or are considered a part of a socially devalued racial category.&lt;ref&gt;(2008) Heterosexism and Homophobia. Encyclopedia of Race and Racism, 2, 1–4. Retrieved March 31, 2008 from Gale Virtual Reference Library: http://find.galegroup.com/ips/start.do?prodId=IPS.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the privileges afforded to people falling into the categories of white people and (perceived) heterosexuals include, but are not limited to, social acceptance, prestige, freedom from negative [[stereotypes]], and the comfort of being within the [[Norm (sociology)|norm]] and thereby not being [[marginalized]] or viewed as different.&lt;ref&gt;Simoni, J. M. &amp; Walters, K. L. (2001). Heterosexual Identity and Heterosexism: Recognizing Privilege to Reduce Prejudice. Journal of Homosexuality, 1(1), 157–173.

== As a set of beliefs and attitudes ==
{{See also|Religion and homosexuality|Homosexuality and psychology|Sexual orientation and medicine (disambiguation)|Social attitudes toward homosexuality}}

=== Individual and group level ===
Heterosexism as a set of beliefs and attitudes relies on a core [[wikt:tenet|tenet]] according to which [[heteronormativity|homosexuality and bisexuality do not normally exist]] and, as such, constitute [[mental disorder|mental illnesses]] or [[deviance (sociology)|deviant behaviors]].&lt;ref name="genderknot17"&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Allan J.|title=The Gender Knot|publisher=Temple University Press|location=Philadelphia|year=1997|page=17|isbn=1-56639-519-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a heterosexist ideology or [[mindset]], the concept of [[sexual orientation]] is rejected or deemed irrelevant. A set of more nuanced heterosexist views, which some may consider faith, [[dogma]], [[Moral absolutism|universal truths]], natural law, [[Appeal to authority|appeals to authority]], or popular beliefs, but others consider to be [[conventional wisdom]] or [[sociobiology|sociobiological]] knowledge can include, among others, the following:

[[File:Save Our Children From Homosexuality Brochure.jpg|thumb|upright|Brochure used by [[Save Our Children]] in 1977]]
* Non-heterosexual persons should keep their sexual orientations private (i.e., they should remain "[[closeted]]").&lt;ref name="JungSmith" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;15&lt;/sup&gt;
* The attitude that gay men aren't [[machismo|"real" men]] or lesbians aren't "real" women because of the socially pervasive view that heterosexual attractions or activities are the "norm" and therefore superior.&lt;ref name="genderknot149" /&gt;
* "God created [[Adam and Eve]], not [[Adam and Steve]] (or Madame and Eve)" and similar essentialist cultural notions that maleness-masculinity and femaleness-femininity are complementary;
* Homosexuality being wrong, ungodly, and against nature, it is therefore a [[sin]], [[evil]] or subhuman.&lt;ref name="JungSmith" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;18&lt;/sup&gt;
* Views identical or akin to [[Anita Bryant]]'s statement during her [[Save Our Children]] campaign in the U.S. (''See campaign brochure image at right''):
:"As a mother, I know that homosexuals cannot biologically reproduce children; therefore, they must [[Homosexual recruitment|recruit]] our children."
* Because of their lifestyle, homosexuals do not have families with children, so they undermine the survival of the human race ([[natalism]]).
* Homosexuality is an affectional or [[mental disorder]] or simply a social ill, therefore, it can be cured or stamped out. If it is not eradicated, it will lead to [[Social solidarity|social disintegration]] and [[societal collapse]].
* Homosexuals can be converted to heterosexuality.&lt;ref name="JungSmith" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;109&lt;/sup&gt;

In an attempt to bring awareness to people who exhibit heterosexist views but are possibly not aware of it, Mark Rochlin constructed a set of questions in 1977 which are questions that non-heterosexual people are often exposed to, but not heterosexuals, such as "''What do you think caused your sexuality?''" This heterosexuality questionnaire is often distributed around college campuses to bring awareness of heterosexist sexual prejudice against LGBT persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinkpractice.co.uk/quaire.htm|title=The Pink Practice - Heterosexuality Questionnaire|publisher=|accessdate=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutional level===
As well as comprising attitudes held by an individual or a social group, heterosexism can also exist as the expression of attitudes within an institution. As a result, schools, hospitals, and correctional facilities can act as a showcase for heterosexist attitudes in various ways. First, schools may implement these attitudes and ideas through unequal and inconsistent disciplinary actions. One such example is meting out harsher punishment to a same-sex couple violating the school ground rules while allowing a heterosexual couple to pass with an easier and more subtle disciplinary action for an equal or identical violation. Also, hospitals may limit patient visiting only to immediate family, i.e., relatives, and exclude same sex partners.&lt;ref&gt;Heterosexism and Homophobia. Encyclopedia of Race and Racism, 2, 1–4. Retrieved March 31, 2008 from Gale Virtual Reference Library: http://find.galegroup.com/ips/start.do?prodId=IPS.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heterosexism affects the family in several ways. For example, in many countries around the world, same-sex marriage is not allowed, so non-heterosexual persons must remain unmarried or enter into heterosexual marriage.&lt;ref name="TFDASJ" /&gt; Many countries also deny rights and benefits to same-sex couples, including custodial and adoption rights for children, Social Security benefits, and automatic durable power of attorney and hospital spousal rights.&lt;ref name="TFDASJ"&gt;{{cite book|last=Adams|first=Maurianne |author2=Bell, Lee Anne |author3=Griffin, Pat|title=Teaching for Diversity and Social Justice|publisher=Routledge|year=2007|edition=2|chapter=Appendix 9H|isbn=0-415-95200-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research and measurements ==

===Measurements===

Psychologists have aimed to measure heterosexism using various methods. One particular method involves the use of a [[Likert scale]].  However, since heterosexism is perceived as something that is unseen it is difficult to determine if someone is heterosexist based on a [[Self-report study|self-report method.]] Researchers, thus, have constructed implicit measurements of heterosexism. An example of this would be an [[Implicit Association Test]]. A popular implicit association test measuring heterosexism that is open to the public is a virtual laboratory called [https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/ Project Implicit].

One limitation present in research on heterosexism is that there often isn’t a distinction between homophobia and heterosexism. Individuals are more likely to be aware of homophobic tendencies rather than heterosexist views, thus, researchers often measure homophobia instead of heterosexism.&lt;ref&gt;Herek, G. M. (2000). The psychology of sexual prejudice. Current Directions in Psychological Science, 9(1): 19-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===

Research on heterosexism has focused on variables that may affect views of heterosexism. For instance, in a study by psychologist, [[Gregory M. Herek]], it was found that there was a gender difference between heterosexual attitudes toward lesbians and gay men.&lt;ref name="Herek, G. M. 1988"&gt;Herek, G. M. (1988). Heterosexual's attitudes toward lesbians and gay men: Correlates and gender differences. Journal of Sex Research. 25(4): 451-477.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the study reveals that heterosexual individuals all seem to have some heterosexist tendency, however, heterosexual males have a greater tendency than heterosexual females to exhibit negative attitudes towards non-heterosexual individuals (this includes gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals). Another notable finding of Herek's study was that heterosexual males showed a greater tendency to demonstrate hostility towards gay men rather than lesbians.&lt;ref name="Herek, G. M. 1988"/&gt; Other factors that Herek acknowledges to contribute to heterosexism include individual differences, religiosity, conforming to social norms, [[right-wing authoritarianism]], customs and beliefs regarding cultural tradition, and personal experience with non-heterosexual individuals.&lt;ref name="Herek, G. M. 1988"/&gt; Research has also recognized the effects of level of education on views of heterosexism.&lt;ref name="Wright L. W. 1999"&gt;Wright L. W., Jr., Adams, H. E., &amp; Bernat, J. (1999). Development and validation of the Homophobia scale. Journal of Psychopathology and Behavioral Assessment, 21(4): 337-347.&lt;/ref&gt; Wright et al. revealed that higher levels of education, or having more years of education, is related to less homophobic tendencies.&lt;ref name="Wright L. W. 1999"/&gt;

===Implicit or hidden===
This form of heterosexism operates through invisibility, under-representation, and [[wikt:erasure|erasure]]. It includes:
* Lack or under-representation of homosexual or bisexual people in advertising to the general public;
* Censorship of homosexual or bisexual characters, themes, and issues in works of art, literature, entertainment; ''see also [[Postcards from Buster#Controversial episodes|"Sugar Time" episode of Postcards from Buster]]''
* Exclusion of historical and political figures’ and celebrities’ homosexuality or bisexuality; their portrayal as heterosexuals;
* Complete avoidance of mentioning these people and their positive contributions particularly in news media;
* In the context of sex education or professional advice, referring only to opposite-sex partners when discussing female or male [[sexual attraction]] and activity;
* Silence on issues affecting homosexual and bisexual people at school or work or absence of their discussion in a positive light;
* Implementation and use of [[content-control software]] (censorware) to filter out information and websites that focus on homosexuality or bisexuality;
* [[Postal censorship]] and border control or customs seizure of publications deemed obscene solely on the basis of them containing material related to homosexuality even when they contain no erotic or pornographic material; ''see also [[Little Sister's Book and Art Emporium]]''
* Work environments that tacitly require gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals not to reveal their sexual orientation via discussion of their relationship status while heterosexuals can discuss their relationships and [[marital status]] freely;
* At public libraries or bookstores: rejection, removal or destruction of [[Homosexuality in children's literature|books]] (e.g. ''[[Jenny lives with Eric and Martin]]''), films, and posters with homosexual themes;
* Refusal to include families headed by [[Same-sex parenting|same-sex parents]] at school events or to represent such family diversity in school curricula; ''see also [[anti-bias curriculum]]'';
* Coercive or forced [[sex reassignment surgery]] on gay men, lesbian women, and bisexuals – an issue addressed in [[Tanaz Eshaghian]]'s 2008 documentary, ''[[Be Like Others]]''. ''See also: [[LGBT rights in Iran]]''

== Effects ==

Heterosexism causes a range of effects on people of any sexual orientation. However, the main effects of heterosexism are marginalization, and anti-LGBT violence and abuse.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

=== Marginalization ===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}

The main effect of heterosexism is the [[marginalization]] of gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals within society. Heterosexism has led to [[Social stigma|stigmatization]] and persecution of not only these people but also those of other [[sexual diversity]] such as transgender, and transsexual people. Along with [[homophobia]], [[lesbophobia]], and [[internalized homophobia]], heterosexism continues to be a significant social reality that compels people to conceal their homosexual or bisexual orientation, or metaphorically, to remain in [[Closeted|the closet]] in an effort to [[Passing (sexual orientation)|pass]] for heterosexual.

Marginalization also occurs when marriage rights are heterosexist. More specifically, when marriage rights are exclusive to opposite-sex couples, all same-sex couples, be they gay, lesbian, straight or mixed, are prevented from enjoying marriage’s corresponding legal privileges, especially those regarding property rights, health benefits, and child custody. Moreover, such limitation prevents same-sex couples from receiving the inherent social respect of marriage and its cultural symbolism.

=== Anti-LGBT violence and abuse ===

Yolanda Dreyer, professor of practical theology at [[University of Pretoria]], has claimed that "Heterosexism leads to prejudice, discrimination, harassment, and [[Violence against LGBT people|violence]].  It is driven by fear and hatred (Dreyer 5)."&lt;ref&gt;Dreyer, Yolanda. "Hegemony and the Internalisation of Homophobia Caused by Heteronormativity." Department of Practical Theology. 2007. University of Pretoria.5 May 2008 [www.up.ac.za/dspace/bitstream/2263/2741/1/Dreyer_Hegemony(2007).pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Along the same lines, forensic psychologist Karen Franklin explains violence caused by heterosexism toward both men and women, regardless of their sexual orientations:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]hrough heterosexism, any male who refuses to accept the dominant culture's assignment of appropriate masculine behavior is labeled early on as a "[[Sissy#Pejorative|sissy]]" or "[[Fag (slang)|fag]]" and then subjected to [[bullying]]. Similarly, any woman who opposes male dominance and control can be labeled a lesbian and attacked. The potential of being ostracized as homosexual, regardless of actual sexual attractions and behaviors, puts pressure on all people to conform to a narrow standard of appropriate gender behavior, thereby maintaining and reinforcing our society's hierarchical gender structure.&lt;ref name="Franklin"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another form of heterosexist violence as [[social control]] that most often targets lesbian women is [[corrective rape]]: a [[gang rape]] of a lesbian to "cure" her of her same-sex attractions. A notorious example from South Africa is the corrective rape and murder of [[Eudy Simelane]], [[LGBT social movements|LGBT-rights]] activist and member of the [[South Africa women's national football team|women's national football team]].&lt;ref name="guardian120309"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/12/eudy-simelane-corrective-rape-south-africa|title=Raped and killed for being a lesbian: South Africa ignores 'corrective' attacks|last=Kelly|first=Annie|date=12 March 2009|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2009-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a Frontline article titled Inside the Mind of People Who Hate Gays, bias-related violence against homosexuals is believed to be widespread in the United States, with perpetrators typically described by victims as young men in groups who assault targets of convenience. Victims accounts suggest that assailants possess tremendous rage and hatred; indeed, documentation of horrific levels of brutality has led gay activists to characterize the violence as political terrorism aimed at all gay men and lesbians. Other motives for antigay violence suggested in the literature include male bonding, proving heterosexuality, and purging secret homosexual desires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Roots Of Homophobia - Inside The Mind Of People Who Hate Gays {{!}} Assault On Gay America {{!}} FRONTLINE {{!}} PBS|url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/assault/roots/franklin.html|website = www.pbs.org|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On singing duo [[Romanovsky and Phillips]]' album ''Be Political, Not Polite'', the song "When Heterosexism Strikes" discusses possible actions in response to example cases of heterosexism. ([http://www.romanovskyandphillips.com/politicallyrics.htm#hetero lyrics])

According to an article in the Howard Journal of Communications, some LGBT individuals have responded to heterosexism through direct confrontation and communication, or through the removal of self from the hostile environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Camara|first = Sakile K.|date = December 2012|title = Heterosexism in Context: Qualitative Interaction Effects of Co-Cultural Responses|url =|journal = Howard Journal of Communications|doi =|pmid =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In functional-[[cognitive linguistics]], as well as in [[semiotics]], '''iconicity''' is the conceived [[wikt:similarity|similarity]] or [[analogy]] between the form of a [[Sign (semiotics)|sign]] (linguistic or otherwise) and its [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]], as opposed to [[arbitrariness]].

Iconic principles:
*Quantity principle: conceptual complexity corresponds to formal complexity
*Proximity principle: conceptual distance tends to match with linguistic distance
*Sequential order principle: the sequential order of events described is mirrored in the speech chain

==Quantity principle==
The use of quantity of phonetic material to iconically mark increased quality or quantity can be noted in the lengthening of words to indicate a greater degree, such as "{{not a typo|looong}}". It is also common to use [[reduplication]] to iconically mark increase, as [[Edward Sapir]] is quoted, “The process is generally employed, with self-evident symbolism, to indicate such concepts as distribution, plurality, repetition, customary activity, increase of size, added intensity, continuance” (1921:79). This has been confirmed by the comparative studies of Key (1965) and Moravcsik (1978).&lt;ref&gt;Moravcsik (1978)&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen, for example, in [[Amharic language|Amharic]], where ''{{lang|am|täsäbbärä}}'' means "it was broken" and ''{{lang|am|täsäbb'''ab'''ärä}}'' means that "it was shattered".

Iconic coding principles may be [[natural]] tendencies in language and are also part of our [[cognition|cognitive]] and [[biology|biological]] make-up. Whether iconicity is a part of language is an open debate in linguistics. For instance, [[Haspelmath]] has argued against iconicity, claiming that most iconic phenomena can be explained by frequency biases: since simpler meanings tend to be more frequent in the language use they tend to lose phonological material.

[[Onomatopoeia]] (and [[mimesis]] more broadly) may be seen as a kind of iconicity, though even onomatopoeic sounds have a large degree of arbitrariness.

==The evolution of language==
[[Derek Bickerton]] has posited that iconic signs, both verbal and gestural, were crucial in the evolution of human language. [[Animal communication]] systems, Bickerton has argued, are largely composed of [[Indexicality|indexical]] (and, occasionally, iconic) signs, whereas in human language, "most words are symbolic, and&amp;nbsp;... without symbolic words we couldn’t have language". The distinction Bickerton draws between these categories is one of [[Displacement (linguistics)|displacement]], with the indexical signs of animal communication systems having no capacity for displacement, and the symbolic signs of human language requiring it. Iconic signs, however, "may or may not have it depending on how they’re used&amp;nbsp;... iconicity, therefore, is the most probable road that our ancestors took into language".

Using a [[Niche construction|niche-construction]] view of human evolution, Bickerton has hypothesized that human ancestors used iconic signs as recruitment signals in the scavenging of dead [[megafauna]]. This process "would have created new words and deployed old words in new contexts, further weakening the uncoupling of words from situations, from current occurrence—even from fitness", and thus allowing for the creation of symbolic language.&lt;ref name="Bickerton (2009)"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bickerton |first=Derek |title=Adam's Tongue: How Humans Made Language, How Language Made Humans |year=2009 |publisher=Hill &amp; Wang |location=New York, NY |isbn=9780809022816 |pages=52–53, 218–222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Symbolic Species]]'', [[Terrence Deacon]] argues that the emanation of symbolic capacities unique to language was a critical factor in the evolution of the human brain, and that these symbolic capacities are vital to differentiating animal from human forms of communication, processes of learning, and brain anatomy. "The doorway into this virtual world was opened to us alone by the evolution of language, because language is not merely a mode of communication, it is also the outward expression of an unusual mode of thought—symbolic representation."&lt;ref name="Deacon (1997)"&gt;{{cite book |last=Deacon |first=Terrence |title=The Symbolic Species: The Co-Evolution of Language and the Human Brain |year=1997 |publisher=Allen Lane the Penguin Press |isbn=978-0-393-03838-5 |chapter=1 |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calls and gestures==
Iconic calls and gestures mimic the forms of the things they stand for (such as outlining shapes or moving your hands back and forth multiple times to show repetition.) Iconic calls and gestures are not formally considered [[language]], or language-like communication in that they do not contrast or possess arbitrary characteristics. Noises that imitate sounds of the surrounding environment ([[ideophone]]s) are also iconic. Though humans possess a repertoire of iconic calls and gestures, other [[mammal]]s produce few iconic signals. Despite this, a few captive [[chimpanzee]]s have shown the beginning stages of iconicity. Burling ''et al.'' states: "Chimpanzees in the wild do not point, and rarely do so in captivity, however there is a documented case of one named [[Kanzi]], described by Savage-Rumbaugh et al., who could indicate direction of travel by "extending his hand". Another chimpanzee, Viki (Hayes and Nissen 1971:107) made motions of kneading or ironing when she wanted to knead dough or iron napkins. [[Waggle dance|Bee dances]] are another example of iconicity in [[animal communication|animal communication systems]].&lt;ref name="Burling1993"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Burling |first=Robbins |title=Primate Calls, Human Language, and Nonverbal Communication {{bracket|and Comments and Reply}} |journal=Current Anthropology |publisher=University of Chicago Press |date=February 1993 |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=30–31 |jstor=2743729 |doi=10.1086/204132 |registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sign languages==
Iconicity is often argued to play a large role in the production and perception of [[gesture]]. Proposed ways in which iconicity is achieved is through [http://jeroenarendsen.nl/2007/04/hands-that-act-embody-model-and-draw/ Hands that Act, Embody, Model, and Draw]. In sign languages iconicity was often argued to be largely confined to sign formation (comparable to [[onomatopoeia]]). Some proponents believe that iconicity does not play an actual role in perception and production of signs once they have undergone phonological reduction and become part of the conventionalized vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;Frishburg (1975).&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, as sign language researchers gain confidence (and the fear of losing linguistic status subsidies), the possible role of iconicity is being evaluated again. Current research on sign language phonology acknowledges that certain aspects are semantically motivated. Further, the ability to modify sign meaning through phonological changes to signs is gaining attention. The ability to work creatively with sign language in this way has been associated with accomplished, or native signers.

Iconicity is expressed in the grammatical structure of [[sign languages]] called classifiers. These are used to give descriptive information about a subject or verb. In [[American Sign language]] (ASL) a grammatical marker denoting “intensity” is characterized by a movement pattern with two parts: an initial pause, followed by a quick completion. When this pattern is added to the adjective GOOD the resulting meaning is VERY-GOOD.&lt;ref&gt;Wilcox (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The ASL marker for "intensity" is iconic in that the intended meaning (building of pressure, a sudden release) is matched by the articulatory form (a pause, a quick completion).

Like in vocal languages, developmental trends in ASL shy away from iconicity in favor of arbitrariness. These changes "contribute toward symmetry, fluidity, locational displacement and assimilation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Frishberg |first=Nancy |title=Arbitrariness and Iconicity: Historical Change in American Sign Language |journal=Language |date=September 1975 |volume=51 |issue=3 |pages=696–719 |doi=10.2307/412894 |jstor=412894 |registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the sign WE used to contain the sign for each individual being described by the WE. So the signer would sign ME + YOU&lt;small&gt;1&lt;/small&gt; + YOU&lt;small&gt;2&lt;/small&gt; + YOU &lt;small&gt;n&lt;/small&gt; + ME. Now the sign has turned into a smooth symbolic sign where the signer makes two touches on the chest, one on each side, with a sweep of the wrist in between.

==Poetry==
Iconicity often occurs within poetry through the use of onomatopoeia, which may be called auditory iconicity. Sometimes, though, the form of the poem resembles or enacts the poem's content, and in this case, a visual iconicity is present. One poet well known for his visual poems, and therefore visual iconicity, is [[E. E. Cummings]]. A subset of visual iconicity involves a spatial iconicity. For instance, in Cummings's grasshopper poem ("r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r") the word "arriving" begins on the far right of the poem with the "a", the "r" is near the middle of the poem, and the rest of the word is on the left of the poem. The reader must travel a great distance across the poem, therefore, in order to "arrive". The spatial dimension, then, can relate to a temporal dimension. In the poems "The Fish" and "The Moose" by Elizabeth Bishop, temporal iconicity is at work. The amount of time it takes to read "The Fish" coincides with the length of time a fish could live outside of water; likewise, the duration of the long bus ride in "The Moose" coincides with the poem's long first sentence as well as the twenty-some stanzas it takes before the passengers on the bus (and the reader) actually encounters the moose.

==Folk etymology==
Iconicity occurs in rejective [[phono-semantic matching]]. "Consider Lithuanian [[Ashkenazic Hebrew]] רע דם ''ra dom'' (cf. [[Yiddish]] ''ra dam''), lit. 'of bad blood' (from [[Hebrew]] רע דם ''ra` dam'' 'of bad blood'). This is a toponymic rejective phono-semantic matching of [[Polish language|Polish]] ''[[Radom]]'', the name of a town in Poland (approximately {{convert|100|km}} south of [[Warsaw]]), or of its [[Yiddish]] adaptation ''ródem'' (see [[Uriel Weinreich]] 1955: 609, [[Paul N. Wexler|Paul Wexler]] 1991: 42). Thus, if a pogrom had occurred in Radom, it would surely have been rationalized by ''ra dam'' ‘of bad blood’. Obviously, providing such an [[folk etymology|etymythological]] explanation for the pogrom was regarded by some Jews as a mere play on words. However, others might have conceived of ''ra dam'' as having deep intrinsic truth, which might have been religiously and homiletically based. One should not forget that at that time it was a common belief that all languages were God-created and that Hebrew was the divine ''Ursprache''."&lt;ref name="See p 2006 pp. 237-258"&gt;See p. 246 of [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil‘ad]] (2006), "'[[folk etymology|Etymythological]] [[Othering]]' and the Power of 'Lexical Engineering' in Judaism, Islam and Christianity. A Socio-Philo(sopho)logical Perspective", ''Explorations in the Sociology of Language and Religion'', edited by [[Tope Omoniyi]] and [[Joshua A. Fishman]], Amsterdam: John Benjamins, pp. 237–258.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language acquisition==
It has been suggested that iconicity can be used in the teaching of languages. There are two ways this has been suggested. The first being “Horizontal-Iconicity” and the second being vowel magnitude relationships. Horizontal-Iconicity is the phenomenon of opposition of meaning and spelling. For example, in [[Egypt]]ian mer, which means right hand and rem, which means left hand. Because people are more likely to remember things they have more [[Mnemonic]] tags for, it is suggested that it may be helpful to point these things out in the teaching of language.&lt;ref name="Croft 1978"&gt;Croft (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vowel magnitude==
Vowel magnitude relationships suggest that, the larger the object, the more likely its name has open vowels such as {{IPAslink|ɒ}}, {{IPAslink|eɪ}}, and {{IPAslink|æ}}; the smaller the object, the more likely its name has closed vowel sounds such as {{IPAslink|iː}}, {{IPAslink|ʊ}}, and {{IPAc-en|j|uː}}. Open vowel sounds are also more likely to be associated with round shapes and dark or gloomy moods, where closed vowel sounds are more likely to be associated with pointed shapes and happy moods.&lt;ref name="Croft 1978"/&gt;

A test run by [[Edward Sapir|Sapir]] asked subjects to differentiate between two different sized tables using invented word pairs such as "mal" and "mil". He discovered a word containing {{IPA|[a]}} was at four times more likely to be judged as larger if paired with a word containing {{IPA|[i]}}. Nuckolls states: "Newman discovered that&amp;nbsp;... as the tongue recedes in articulating vowels from the front to the back of the mouth, and as acoustic frequencies become lower, the vowels are judged to be larger and darker". Bentley and Varron (1933) ran tests asking subjects to differentiate between vowel sounds without providing them, beforehand, contrasting attributes (such as bright and dark.) They found only moderate success rates that decreased when vowel sounds were closer in tone. However, they still found that {{IPA|[a]}} sounds were judged larger or lower than {{IPA|[i]}} sounds.&lt;ref name="Nuckolls 1999 230, 231, 246"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nuckolls |first=Janis B. |title=The Case for Sound Symbolism |journal=Annual Review of Anthropology |year=1999 |volume=28 |pages=230–231, 246 |doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.28.1.225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], examples from degree adjectives, such as long, longer, longest, show that the most extreme degree of length is iconically represented by the word with the greatest number of [[phoneme]]s. [[Roman Jakobson|Jakobson]] cites examples of word order mimicking the natural order of ideas. In fact, iconicity is now widely acknowledged to be a significant factor at many levels of linguistic structure.&lt;ref name="Nuckolls 1999 230, 231, 246"/&gt;

==Digital media==
Over a seven-year span, [[Marc Davis (academic)|Marc Davis]], Brian Williams, and Golan Levin have managed to develop their own iconic visual language. The creation of their program called [[Media Streams]] was derived from a need and a desire to have a universal language when creating videos. Media accessibility is becoming easier to obtain by the day, and with this growth new development in the field is bound to happen.

Media production was once limited to an elite group of individuals who spent a large portion of their time taking courses and specializing in the art. Now with the technological advancements and internet use of today, much of the skill can be learned out of your own home. As Marc Davis would say, just as the [[printing press]] was given to the users via [[Desktop Publishing]], media production can now, also, be given to these same users. [[Streaming media]] is vastly growing and the manipulation and reconstruction of this hot trend is more than needed and necessary to keep the diversity coming.

From 1991 to 1997, Marc Davis and his colleagues worked out of the Machine Understanding Group of the MIT Laboratory and the [[Interval Research Corporation]] to create their media streams program.

Media Streams "{{bracket|i}}s a system for annotating, retrieving, repurposing, and automatically assembling digital video". (Davis; Media Streams) The system uses a stream based, semantic representation of video content with an [[iconic visual language]] interface of hierarchically structured and searchable primitives.

The goal of this system is to address the problems of annotation convergence and human-computer communication. Developing the iconic visual language was necessary to assist the computational reading and writing of representational consensual interpretations of video content in a standardized way. Illiterate, diverse languages and the like will all be able to work with this system due to its [[universal language]].

'''Lake Erie College''' is a [[Private university|private]] [[liberal arts college]] founded in 1856 and located in [[Painesville, Ohio|Painesville]], [[Ohio]], United States, approximately {{convert|30|mi|km}} east of [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]]. A former female seminary, the college converted to a coeducational institution in 1985. As of the 2015–2016 [[Academic term|academic year]], the enrollment was approximately 1,250 [[undergraduate]], College Credit Plus, post-baccalaureate and [[graduate student]]s.

In addition to 63 programs of study for undergraduate students, Lake Erie offers master's programs in education and physician assistant studies, as well as the [[International Assembly for Collegiate Business Education|IACBE]]-accredited Parker Master of Business Administration program, first founded in 1981.

==Campus==
Lake Erie College is approximately {{convert|30|mi}} east of [[downtown Cleveland]] in downtown Painesville.  Students under the age of 22 whose official residence is outside a {{convert|50|mi|km|adj=on}} radius of the campus are required to live on campus during the academic year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lec.edu/studentctr/living.php Lake Erie College - Student Life&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070801205250/http://www.lec.edu/studentctr/living.php |date=2007-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Lake Erie Female Seminary ===
Founded as the Lake Erie Female Seminary in 1856, the institution toppled the belief that women were not capable of significant intellectual improvement. The only single-sex institution of higher education for women in the Western Reserve, it took after its sister seminary, [[Mount Holyoke Seminary|Mount Holyoke]].

The seminary was relocated in Painesville after Willoughby Seminary, founded in 1847, burned to the ground. Its founders include prominent local citizens Timothy Rockwell, general store owner Silas Trumbull Ladd, Judge William Lee Perkins, Mayor and Judge Aaron Wilcox, Charles Austin Avery and Judge Reuben Hitchcock, a president of the [[Cleveland and Mahoning Valley Railroad|Cleveland and Mahoning Railroad]] and cousin of [[Edward Hitchcock]].

Scholarship was not a chief concern at the Seminary for many years, however. Educating future mothers through domestic work, physical education and etiquette ranked among the Seminary's chief aims. For a tuition of $160, seminarians trained as teachers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/29442846|title=Dancing on the table : a history of Lake Erie College|last=Geissman.|first=Gross, Margaret|date=1993|publisher=Celo Valley Books|year=|isbn=0923687289|location=Burnsville, N.C.|pages=8–9|oclc=29442846}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 40 years, the seminary raised standards, finally delivering a college degree. It took on the official name of Lake Erie College in 1908 when a charter was passed.

=== Expansion ===
The Arts took up a home in the halls of Lake Erie. Helen Rockwell Morley Memorial Music Building, opened in 1927, still shines – its classic Greek design, Corinthian pillars, seating for more than 1,000, and four-manual [[Ernest M. Skinner|E.M. Skinner]] organ with 5,000 pipes.

The Civil Aeronautics Authority approved Lake Erie for a civilian pilot program in 1939, several years after Amelia Earhart visited the campus to speak to its Aviators Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ninety-nines.org/99-news-magazine.htm|title=Resources {{!}} 99 NEWS Magazine (The Ninety-Nines, Inc.)|last=Inc.|first=The Ninety-Nines,|work=The Ninety-Nines, Inc.|access-date=2017-10-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s, President Dr. Helen D. Bragdon, a Harvard alumna, moved the College from more Victorian ideals toward an active, responsible citizenry.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Her successor, Dr. Paul Weaver, initiated a required general studies lecture series to demonstrate the interconnectivity of fields of study, three 10 week terms, and the establishment of study centers in many European cities. 

In 1954, Lake Erie College became the first institution of higher education in the United States to require a term abroad for its students.

In 1967, Lake Erie added a School of Equine Studies to its equestrian riding program developed by Laddie Andahazy, an influential horseman who founded the [http://chagrinhunterjumperclassic.org/facts/ Cleveland Grand Prix].

A special exhibit of Modern art signaled the opening of Royce Hall for the Fine and Performing Arts in 1970. Prints, sculpture, graphics and more by celebrated artists such as Dali, dekooning, Magritte, Miro and Picasso were on display. [[Buckminster Fuller|R. Buckminster Fuller]] spoke at the facility's ground-breaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/29442846|title=Dancing on the table : a history of Lake Erie College|last=Geissman.|first=Gross, Margaret|date=1993|publisher=Celo Valley Books|year=|isbn=0923687289|location=Burnsville, N.C.|pages=56–57|oclc=29442846}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, Lake Erie College became coeducational, merging Garfield Senior College with Lake Erie College for Women, and men were admitted officially as students.

== Academic Programs ==
Lake Erie College houses five academic schools: the School of Business, the School of Arts and Humanities, the School of Natural Sciences and Mathematics, the School of Education and Professional Studies, and the School of Equine Studies. Each maintains its own majors, minors, and programs under the direction of its respective dean. All students complete a general curriculum, called CORE, as a foundation to courses required by their major field(s) of study.

=== School of Business ===
The IACBE-accredited School of Business offers its students ten undergraduate majors and six minors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lec.edu/school-of-business|title=School of Business {{!}} Lake Erie College|website=www.lec.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Center for Entrepreneurship ====
Lake Erie College is a member of the [http://eecohio.com/ Entrepreneurship Education Consortium] (EEC), and its programming integrates entrepreneurship concepts and collaborative retreats and competitions, such as ideaLabs and Entrepreneurship Immersion Week, into traditional academic studies. Its Center for Entrepreneurship consists of business faculty and a resident entrepreneur.

=== School of Arts, Humanities &amp; Social Sciences ===
The School of Arts and Humanities offers its students 13 undergraduate majors and 16 minors. Some popular majors include criminal justice, psychology, communication and English. Minors such as gender, sexuality &amp; women's studies as well as comedy studies fall outside the scope of major fields of study. While most major fields lead to a Bachelor of Arts degree, a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree is also offered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lec.edu/school-of-ahs|title=The School of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences {{!}} Lake Erie College|website=www.lec.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''Mathematical Magick''''' (complete title: ''Mathematical Magick, or, The wonders that may by performed by mechanichal geometry: in two books, concerning mechanical powers [and] motions. Being one of the most easie, pleasant, useful (and yet most neglected) part of Mathematicks. Not before treated of in this language''.) is a [[treatise]] by the [[Anglican ministry|English clergyman]], [[Natural philosophy|natural philosopher]], [[polymath]] and author [[John Wilkins]] (1614 – 1672). It was first published in 1648 in London,&lt;ref&gt;''by I.W.M.A., London, printed by M.F. for Sa: Gellibrand at the brasen Serpent in Pauls Church-yard. 1648.'' Quoted in [https://books.google.com/books?id=Lc38yWFv3p8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=John+Wilkins&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kpw7T46XO8P0sgb1s63dBg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=John%20Wilkins&amp;f=false Asbach-Schnitker, Brigitte: John Wilkins, Mercury ... Bibliography, 7.3 The Works of John Wilkins, n° 24]&lt;/ref&gt; another edition was printed in 1680&lt;ref&gt;''By J. Wilkins, late Ld BP of Chester. London: Printed for Edw.Gellibrand at the Golden Ball in St. Pauls Church-yard. 1680'', 295 pages. A reproduction of the original in the British Library is made available by [[EEBO]] – Early English Books Online (with limited access); further editions were published in 1691 and 1707. There are reprints titled ''Mathematical Magic Or the Wonders That May Be Performed by Mechanical Geometry (1691)''; Kessinger Publishing, 2003 and 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and further editions were published in 1691 and 1707.

==Abstract==
Wilkins dedicated his work to ''His Highness the Prince Elector Palatine'' ([[Charles I Louis, Elector Palatine|Charles I Louis]]). It is divided into two books, one headed ''Archimedes'', ''because he was the chiefest in discovering of Mechanical powers'', the other was called ''Daedalus'' because he ''was one of the first and most famous amongst the Ancients for his skill in making Automata.''&lt;ref&gt;Wilkins in his foreword&lt;/ref&gt; Wilkins sets out and explains the principles of mechanics in the first book and gives an outlook in the second book on future technical developments like flying which he anticipates as certain if only sufficient exercise, research and development would be directed to these topics. The treatise is an example of his general intention to disseminate scientific knowledge and method and of his attempts to persuade his readers to pursue further scientific studies.&lt;ref&gt;J. Shapiro, Barbara (1969).''John Wilkins 1614–1672'', p.30. University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== First book ==
In the 20 chapters of the first book, traditional mechanical devices are discussed such as the [[Weighing scale|balance]], the [[lever]], the [[wheel]] or [[pulley]] and the [[block and tackle]], the [[wedge (mechanical device)|wedge]], and the [[screw (simple machine)|screw]]. The powers acting on them are compared to those acting in the human body. The book deals with the phrase attributed to [[Archimedes]] saying ''that if he did but know where to stand and fasten his instrument, he could move the world'' and shows the effect of a series of gear transmissions one linked to the other. It shows the importance of various speeds and the theoretical possibility to increase speed beyond the speed of the earth at the [[equator]]. Finally, [[siege engines]] like [[catapult]]s are compared with the cost and effect of then modern guns.

== Second book ==

=== Various devices ===
In the 15 chapters of the second book, various devices are examined which move independently of human interference like clocks and watches, water mills and wind mills. Wilkins explains devices being driven by the motion of air in a chimney or by pressurized air. A [[land yacht]] is proposed driven by two sails on  two masts, and a wagon powered by a [[vertical axis wind turbine]]. A number of independently moving small artificial figures representing men and animals are described.  The possibilities are considered to improve the type of [[submarine]] designed and built by [[Cornelis Drebbel]]. The tales about various flying devices are related and doubts as to their truth are dissipated. Wilkins explains that it should be possible for a man, too, to fly by himself&lt;ref&gt;''Mathematical Magick'', p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; if a frame were built where the person could sit and if this frame was sufficiently pushed in the air.

=== The art of flying ===
In chapter VII, Wilkins discusses various methods how a man could fly, namely by the help of spirits and good or evil angels (as related on various occasions in the Bible), by the help of fowls, by wings fastend immediately to the body or by a flying chariot. The whole of this chapter (and of the following one) concern the possibilities of flying. In a single preliminary phrase, Wilkins refers to previous reports about attempts to fly: 
{{quote|Tis related of a certain English Monk called Elmerus [probably [[Eilmer of Malmesbury]]], about the Confessors time, that he did by such wings fly from a Tower above a furlong; and so another from Saint Marks steeple in Venice; another at Norinberge; and Busbequius speaks of a Turk in Constantinople, who attempted something this way. Mt. Burton mentioning this quotation, doth believe that some new-fangled wit ('tis his Cynical phrase) will some time or other find out this art. Though the truth is, most of these Artists did unfortunately miscarry by falling down and breaking their arms or legs, yet that may be imputed to their want of experience ...|p. 204|}}
Wilkins continues by saying that sufficient practise should enable a man to fly. The most probable way, however, would be by a ''flying chariot, which may be so contrived as to carry a man within it...''&lt;ref&gt;''Mathematical Magick'', p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; and be equipped with some sort of engine, or else be big enough to carry several persons each of them successively labouring to cause the chariot to fly. Wilkins uses the next chapter to dissipate any doubts there may be as to the possibility of such a flying chariot, but of course a number of particular items would have to be developed and tested.

=== Perpetual motion and perpetual lamps ===
In Chapters IX to XV, extensive discussions and deliberations are set out why a perpetual motion should be feasible, why the stories about lamps burning for hundreds of years were true and how such lamps could be made and perpetual motions created.

[[File:DSC04629 Istanbul - Sehzade camii - Foto G. Dall'Orto 29-5-2006.jpg|thumb|The later plain type hanging in [[Istanbul]]]]

'''Mosque lamps''' of [[enamelled glass]], often with [[gilding]], survive in considerable numbers from the [[Islamic art]] of the [[Middle Ages]], especially the 13th and 14th centuries, with [[Cairo]] in Egypt and [[Aleppo]] and [[Damascus]] in Syria the most important centres of production.&lt;ref&gt;Jones &amp; Mitchell, 134&lt;/ref&gt;  They are [[oil lamp]]s, usually with a large round bulbous body rising to a narrower waist, above which the top section is flared.  There is usually a foot so they can be placed on a surface, but they were normally used suspended by chains that went through a number of loops on the outside of the body.  They were used to light mosques and other buildings in mosque complexes, in large spaces in groups hanging from a circular metal frame.  The circular frames continue to be used in many mosques today, but with plain or frosted glass lamps for electric lighting.

==Manufacture==
The techniques used are typical of contemporary [[Islamic glass]], with the enamel decoration applied to a pre-fired plain body, and the whole then fired for a second time. 
The coloured decoration may include [[Qur'anic]] verses, especially the first part of the ''[[Ayat an-Nur]]'' or "Verse of Light" (24:35, see below), inscriptions and heraldic emblems recording the donor, as well as purely decorative motifs.&lt;ref&gt;Jones &amp; Mitchell, 134; [http://www.wallacecollection.org/whatson/treasure/38 A mid-14th-century Islamic glass mosque lamp from Cairo (XXVB94)] [[Wallace Collection]]&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 15th century production of all types of fine glass was in steep decline, a sign of which is that in 1569 the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Grand Vizier]] [[Sokullu Mehmed Pacha]] ordered 600 plain lamps of [[Venetian glass]], perhaps to be decorated elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O821/mosque-lamp/ Victoria and Albert Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ottomans]] also made lamps of similar form in [[Iznik pottery]], and [[Shah Abbas I]] of Persia gave plain silver lamps to hang by the tomb of [[Safi-ad-din Ardabili|Shaykh Safi]] at [[Ardabil]]; [[Persian miniature]]s show other examples from the 16th century in gold or brass and silver.  Such opaque materials were much less effective as lighting, but the purpose of the lamp was symbolic as well as practical, related to the "Verse of Light".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/m/ottoman_mosque_lamp.aspx Lamp for the Ottoman restoration of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem], British Museum; Canby, 85, 180; Perry&lt;/ref&gt;  Mosque lamps are often shown in profile at the head of a [[prayer rug]] for the same reason.&lt;ref&gt;Perry&lt;/ref&gt;  The decoration of the lamps often includes either the name or the symbol from [[Islamic heraldry]] of the donor, who usually gave a group of lamps.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Jones &amp; Mitchell, 143-144&lt;/ref&gt;  Other types of lighting in mosques were large metal lamp stands, like very wide candlesticks, which were also used in secular buildings.  These could be very intricately decorated.&lt;ref&gt;Canby, 85&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later types==
[[File:Amman BW 33.JPG|thumb|Modern electric lighting in [[Amman]]]]
The elaborate decorated types were mostly succeeded by plain glass oil lamps with a simple rim at the top, by which they were attached to (typically) a circular metal bar. Often these hang in tiers. Mosques today typically retain the hanging circular fittings, but use electric lights and glass shades of various sorts, not essentially different from other glass [[lampshade]]s used in lighting other buildings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12533">{{About|an American analog television standard for sound multiplex|the secondary audio feed on television in general|Sound multiplex in broadcasting}}
'''Multichannel television sound''', better known as '''MTS''' (often still as '''BTSC''', for the [[Broadcast Television Systems Committee]] that created it), is the method of [[encoder|encoding]] three additional [[channel (communications)|channels]] of [[Sound|audio]] into an [[analog television|analog]] [[NTSC]]-format [[Sound|audio]] [[carrier wave|carrier]].

== History ==
Multichannel Television Sound was adopted by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] as the [[United States|U.S.]] [[standardization|standard]] for [[stereophonic sound|stereo]] [[television]] [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] in 1984. Initial work on design and testing of a stereophonic audio system began in 1975 when Telesonics approached [[Chicago]] public television station [[WTTW]]. WTTW was producing a music show titled ''[[Soundstage (TV program)|Soundstage]]'' at that time, and was [[simulcast]]ing the stereo audio mix on local [[Frequency modulation|FM]] stations. Telesonics and WTTW formed a working relationship and began developing the system which was similar to FM stereo modulation.  Twelve WTTW studio and transmitter engineers added the needed broadcast experience to the relationship.  The Telesonics system was tested and refined using the WTTW transmitter facilities on the [[Willis Tower|Sears Tower]]. In 1979, WTTW had installed a stereo [[Thomson Grass Valley|Grass Valley]] master control switcher, and had added a second audio channel to the [[Microwave radio relay|microwave]] STL (Studio Transmitter Link). By that time, WTTW engineers had further developed stereo audio on [[videotape recorder]]s in their plant, using split audio track heads manufactured to their specifications, outboard record electronics, and [[Dolby noise-reduction system|Dolby noise reduction]] that allowed ''Soundstage'' to be recorded and electronically edited. In addition, an [[Ampex]] MM1100, 24-track audio recorder was also used for music production and mixing. [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] member stations who wished to deliver ''Soundstage'' in stereo were provided with a four-track (left, right, vertical drive, and [[time code]]) audio tape that could be synced with the video machines in those cities.

During the FCC approval process, several manufacturers applied to the FCC for consideration.  Most notably the [[Electronic Industries Alliance]] (EIA) and Japanese EIA asked to be included in order to represent their members in the testing and specification phases of the approval process. WTTW engineers helped set standards for [[frequency response]], separation, and other uses of the spectrum. They also provided program source material used for the testing and maintained the broadcast chain. A [[3M]] 24-track audio recorder was used to allow the selection of 12 different stereo programs for testing. The [[Panasonic Corporation|Matsushita]] Quasar TV manufacturing plant and laboratory, just west of Chicago, was used as the source for all testing of the competing systems. Following the testing, several questions were raised about the validity of some of the tests, and a second round of testing began.

WTTW installed a Broadcast Electronics prototype stereo modulator in October 1983, and began full-time broadcasting in stereo at that time using the Telesonics system prior to FCC rule-making on the BTSC system. Following EIA and FCC recommendations, the BE modulator was modified to meet BTSC specifications, and by August 1984 was in full-time use on WTTW.

Sporadic network transmission of stereo audio began on NBC on July 26, 1984, with ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'', although at the time only the network's New York City flagship station, [[WNBC]], had stereo broadcast capability;&lt;ref&gt;Peter W. Kaplan, "TV Notes", ''New York Times'', July 28, 1984, sec. 1, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; regular stereo transmission of NBC programs began during early 1985. ABC and CBS followed suit in 1986 and 1987, respectively. [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] was the last network to join around 1990, with the four networks having their entire prime-time schedules in stereo by late 1994 ([[The WB]] and [[UPN]] launched the following season with their entire line-ups in stereo). One of the first television receiving systems to include BTSC capability was the [[RCA Dimensia]], released in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cedmagic.com/museum/dimensia/fkc2600-1.html RCA Dimensia FKC2600E and FKC2601T Monitors]. Cedmagic.com. Retrieved on 2014-05-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s and also in the 2000s, the networks would display the disclaimer "In stereo (where available)" at the beginning of stereo programming.

== Adopted in ==
It has also been adopted by
* [[United States]] for [[NTSC]]
* [[Canada]] for [[NTSC]]
* [[Mexico]] for [[NTSC]]
* [[Chile]] for [[NTSC]]
* [[Brazil]] for [[PAL-M]]
* [[Taiwan]] for [[NTSC]] (historic, switched to DVB-T)
* [[Argentina]] for PAL-N
* [[Philippines]] for [[NTSC]]

== How MTS works ==
The first channel is the stereo ''difference'' (left minus right), used to add [[stereophonic]] sound to the existing [[Monaural|monophonic]] (the left plus right stereo ''sum'') audio track.

In other words, the normal mono television audio consists of L+R information. A second signal (MTS) rides on top of this mono carrier wave. This MTS signal consists of L ''minus'' R.
* When the two audio channels are added together, or summed (L+R plus L-R), the left channel is derived.
* When the second audio channel is subtracted from the first by a phase reversal (L+R minus L-R), the right channel is derived.

== MTS real world performance ==
* In ideal circumstances MTS Stereo is about 1.5 db better in performance than standard VHF FM stereo.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}
* Usually with MTS, as with VHF FM stereo, a certain amount of crosstalk is encountered, limiting stereo separation.

The stereo information is [[DBX (noise reduction)|dbx]]-[[Code|encode]]d to increase the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (at low levels), to aid in [[Audio noise reduction|noise reduction]].

Typical S/N (signal to noise) is better than -50 dB.

The original specifications called for a brick wall elliptical filter in each of the audio channels prior to encoding.  The cutoff frequency of this filter was 15 kHz to prevent any horizontal sync crosstalk from being encoded.  Manufacturers of modulators, however, used lower cutoff frequencies as they saw fit.  Typically, they chose 14 kHz although some used filters as low as 12.5 kHz.  The elliptical filter was chosen for having the greatest bandwidth with the lowest phase distortion at the cutoff frequency.  The filter used during EIA testing had a characteristic that was -60dB at 15.5kHz.  As transformer audio coupling was common at that time, the lower frequency limit was set to 50 Hz although modulators without transformer inputs were flat down to at least 20Hz.

Typical separation was better than 35 dB.  However, level matching was essential to achieve this specification.  Left and Right audio levels needed to be matched within less than 0.1 dB to achieve the separation stated.

Maintaining the phase stability of the horizontal sync is essential to good audio in the decode process.  During transmission, the phase of the horizontal sync could vary with picture and chroma levels.  ICPM (Incidental Carrier Phase Modulation), a measure of transmitted phase stability, needs to be less than 4.5% for best audio sub channel decoding.  This was more of a problem with UHF transmitters of the day.  Multi-cavity klystron amplifiers of that time typically had an ICPM above 7%.

== MTS licensing ==
Because of the use of dbx [[companding]], every TV device that decoded MTS originally required the payment of [[royalties]], first to [[dbx, Inc.]], then to [[THAT Corporation]] which was spun off from dbx in 1989 and acquired its MTS patents in 1994; however, those patents expired worldwide in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thatcorp.com/dbxtv-time.html dbx-TV Timeline (THAT Corporation)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009222002/http://www.thatcorp.com/dbxtv-time.html |date=2008-10-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though THAT now owns some patents related to digital implementations of MTS, a letter from THAT to the [[National Telecommunications and Information Administration]] in 2007 confirms that no license is required from THAT for all analog and some digital implementations of MTS.&lt;ref name="THAT-NTIA_Letter"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071029182109/http://www.thatcorp.com/NTIA-letter-2.html Letter to NTIA, August 21, 2007 (THAT Corporation)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== How MTS audio channels are used ==
The [[second audio program]] (SAP) also is part of the standard, providing another [[language]], a [[video description]] service like [[Descriptive Video Service|DVS]], or a completely separate service like a [[campus radio]] station or [[weatheradio]].  This sub-carrier is at 5x horizontal sync and is also dBx encoded.

A third PRO (professional) channel is provided for internal use by the station, and may handle audio or data. The PRO channel is normally used with [[electronic news gathering]] during [[news]] [[Broadcasting|broadcast]]s to talk to the remote location (such as a [[reporter]] on-location), which can then talk back through the [[remote pickup unit|remote link]] to the [[TV station]]. Specialized [[Receiver (radio)|receivers]] for the PRO channel are generally only sold to broadcast professionals. This sub-carrier is at 6.5x horizontal sync.

MTS signals are indicated to the television receiver by adding a 15.734&amp;nbsp;kHz [[pilot tone]] to the signal.
The MTS pilot is locked or derived from the horizontal sync signal used to lock the video display.  Variations in phase or frequency of the horizontal sync are therefore transferred to the audio.  UHF transmitters in use in 1984 generally had significant phase errors introduced in this signal making the transmission of stereo audio on UHF stations of that time nearly impossible.  Later refinements in UHF transmitters minimized these effects and allowed stereo transmission for those stations.

Most FM broadcast receivers are capable of receiving the audio portion of NTSC Channel 6 at 87.75&amp;nbsp;MHz, but only in [[monaural]]. Because the pilot tone frequency at 15.734&amp;nbsp;kHz is different from that of the ordinary FM band (19&amp;nbsp;kHz), such radios cannot decode MTS.

== MTS and the DTV transition in the United States ==
As a component of the NTSC standard, MTS is no longer being used in U.S. full-power television broadcasting after the June 12, 2009 [[DTV transition in the United States]]. It remains in use in [[LPTV]] and in analogue [[cable television]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} All [[coupon-eligible converter box]]es (CECBs) are required to output [[Stereophonic sound|stereo sound]] via [[RCA connector]]s, but MTS is merely optional for the [[RF modulator]] that every CECB contains. NTIA has stated that MTS was made optional for cost reasons;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thatcorp.com/datashts/Kneuer_letter_8-2-07.pdf NTIA Letter to THAT Corporation, August 2, 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720084528/http://www.thatcorp.com/datashts/Kneuer_letter_8-2-07.pdf |date=July 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; this may have been due to a belief that MTS still required royalty payments to THAT Corporation, which is no longer true except for some digital implementations.&lt;ref name="THAT-NTIA_Letter" /&gt;

THAT has created consumer pages on the DTV transition and how it affects MTS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thatcorp.com/dbxTV-DTV-transition.html dbx-TV and the Digital TV Transition (THAT Corporation)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015130126/http://www.thatcorp.com/dbxTV-DTV-transition.html |date=2008-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The site describes the situation by stating that most consumers with CECBs will end up with [[monaural]] TV sound, since RF-only connections are common and MTS is optional (and rare) for CECBs.

The '''National Energy Education Development Project''' is dedicated to promoting an energy conscious and educated society by creating effective networks of students, educators, business, government and community leaders to design and deliver objective, multi-sided energy education programs. 
The NEED Project's educator network includes over 65,000 classrooms nationwide who use NEED's annually up-dated curriculum materials.

==The NEED Project Beginnings==
Started in 1980, launched by a Congressional resolution spearheaded by Gerard Katz, a New York state physics teacher, the '''National Energy Education Development Project''' ('''NEED''') is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit education association dedicated to promoting a realistic understanding of the scientific, economic, and environmental impacts of energy so that students and teachers can make educated decisions.

On March 20, 1980, President Jimmy Carter signed Proclamation 4738, entitled "National Energy Education Day: By the President of the United States, A Proclamation."
The proclamation read, in part:

{{quote|There are only two ways that we can reduce the imports of oil from foreign countries. One is to increase production of American energy of all kinds—and we have been blessed with tremendous reserves compared to other nations—and the other is to conserve the energy supplies that we have from all sources. We have made some progress. It has not yet been adequate, but it's been steady. We've more than reduced imports by a million barrels a day—and we expect to make even greater progress this year—since I've been in office, in 1977.

One of the major opportunities that has not yet been explored is to educate our young people—who can be just as effective, perhaps even more so, than many adults—in the facts about energy, what the opportunities are for conservation, and how they themselves can help. In homes, on the job, in transportation—there is a tremendous opportunity not only for young people to learn but also to educate their parents about the facts concerning how we can solve our energy problem through conservation.

A recent analysis has shown that there is an abysmal lack of information within the public school system among the students about basic facts concerning energy. And this designation of a national day for energy education is a very worthwhile commitment because of the facts that I've just described...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=33165 |title=Jimmy Carter: National Energy Education Day Remarks on Signing Proclamation 4738 |publisher=The American Presidency Project |date=20 March 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==The NEED mission==
The mission of the NEED Project is to promote an energy conscious and educated society by creating effective networks of students, educators, business, government and community leaders to design and deliver objective, multi-sided energy education programs.

The NEED program includes innovative curriculum materials, professional development, evaluation tools, and recognition. NEED teaches the scientific concepts of energy and provides objective information about conventional and emerging energy sources— their use and impact on the environment, economy, and society. The program also educates students about energy efficiency and conservation while providing tools to help educators, energy managers, and consumers use energy wisely.

The NEED mission, goals, and governance are described on the program's website and include links to the organization's annual report and financial statement. [http://www.need.org/mission.php NEED Project Mission]

==NEED's curriculum==
Experts agree students learn best by doing. NEED materials are inquiry based and incorporate the "Kids Teaching Kids" philosophy. NEED makes teaching and learning about energy exciting while developing students' leadership and critical thinking skills.

NEED materials are available for all grade levels from kindergarten through high school. With NEED's extensive curriculum, educators can design classroom programs that spark the interest of their students and meet course objectives. NEED materials are designed to meet and correlate to the National Science Education Content Standards, as well as many state standards. Educators who use NEED materials report that their students score better on end-of-grade testing, are more actively engaged in learning, and develop leadership skills as members of the community.

To ensure that teachers and students are working with accurate information, NEED materials are updated on a regular basis, using the latest data from the U.S. [[Energy Information Administration]], as well as from a wide range of energy industry partners. NEED works with educators and students to improve existing materials and develop new ones to meet national and state curriculum requirements. In a special partnership with the [[Energy Information Administration]], NEED helps make energy information and data available to students via the EIA Kid's Page website. In 2006, the Kid's Page was one of the most popular EIA products—averaging over 350,000 user sessions per month.
NEED welcomes partners who vitalize the NEED network with new curriculum materials and new schools. A partnership with [[Pacific Gas and Electric Company]] expanded the PG&amp;E Solar Schools program to over 600 teachers in the PG&amp;E service area. Schools receive NEED Solar Kits, Science of Energy Kits, teacher training and the opportunity to apply for photovoltaic (solar) installations and classroom grants.

NEED continues to grow at the national and the local level thanks to the support of committed sponsors and partners. Companies and organizations of all types and sizes work with NEED to invest in the future of energy and energy education. NEED sponsors and partners recognize the value of educating tomorrow's workforce for careers in energy. Each partnership is unique. Each partnership considers an energy literate public a pathway to overcoming the energy challenges of the future.

The NEED curriculum is divided into eight steps; each builds on the others to form a comprehensive energy unit that encourages even the youngest students to understand how energy is involved in everything that happens in the world.

NEED offers over 130+ curriculum guides available for free PDF download at the [http://www.need.org/curriculum NEED Store]

==Training and professional development==
Teachers are the key to the success of the NEED program. NEED teachers in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and four U.S. territories reach more than four million students each year in their local schools, and many more through outreach programs. Providing teachers with innovative training programs and opportunities to increase their own energy knowledge is a major objective of the NEED program.

Training is offered at local, state, regional and national levels. During the school year, NEED coordinators, lead teachers, and student leaders facilitate workshops for teachers, students, parents, and community members that may range from a few hours to several days. At these workshops, attendees receive an introduction to the NEED curriculum. Additional training for special topics like solar, hydrogen, wind, energy on public lands, or energy management is available in many areas of the NEED network. NEED specializes in creating a first-class training experience, which is consistently scored by participants as one of the best professional development experiences available.

In the summer, the National Energy Conferences for Educators give teachers and energy professionals the opportunity to meet other educators from across the country, design and develop NEED units for their classrooms, increase their energy knowledge, and earn graduate credit. They participate in NEED activities and field trips to energy sites such as nuclear power plants, coalmines, offshore oil production facilities, solar energy facilities, hydroelectric dams, and energy efficiency projects.

NEED sponsors and partners provide sponsorship for teachers, and they participate as speakers and field trip guides. Some NEED states also sponsor summer energy camps for kids, spring break day camps, and overnight energy weekends. Many NEED schools work with scout troops and community youth groups to help them gain energy-related merit badges and community service hours.

NEED Energy Workshop Opportunities are listed on the NEED Calendar here: [http://www.need.org/calendar.php NEED Calendar]

==The NEED network==
The long-term success of NEED depends on the support of its network. The educators, students, directors, coordinators, sponsors, and community partners who support the program say that working with NEED is one of the most rewarding things about their jobs. The board of Directors facilitates the implementation of NEED's strategic plan for expansion and helps support NEED's goal of providing an energy education program to every interested school in America. Board members volunteer their time and talents to make sure that NEED has a strong foundation and that the programs and materials reach the greatest number of people each year. Each member of the Board provides funding for the development of NEED programs.

State programs are a vital component of NEED's mission. State coordinators and NEED lead teachers, partners, and sponsors provide day-to-day guidance to local programs, conduct regional and local training programs, design and distribute materials, support teachers, and help develop new NEED programs and activities. These state programs make NEED work at the local level—helping connect the state education standards to NEED programs and materials.
NEED stays connected to its network via its newsletters— Energy Exchange and Career Currents—and a variety of resources and opportunities available on NEED's website, www.need.org, and many outreach events each year. Energy Exchange provides teachers, students, and sponsors with information and activities about energy and exciting new technologies and discoveries. NEED's new newsletter, Career Currents, exposes students to the diversity of energy careers. Both newsletters are distributed bimonthly, and all issues are available on www.need.org.

With a new look this year, www.need.org gives teachers a resource for curriculum publications and activity guides, a place to discuss their NEED programs, and links to a variety of supplemental resources. The website also provides students with methods for choosing science fair experiments, fact sheets for research projects, activities to reinforce knowledge, and resources on the nation's leading energy sources, electricity, and conservation. NEED also partners with the [[Energy Information Administration]] on their [http://www.eia.doe.gov/kids/ EIA Kid’s Page], the premier site for kids to find reliable, up-to-date energy information and loads of fun energy activities.

Since its inception in 1980, NEED has grown from a one-day celebration of energy awareness to a national organization dedicated o introducing energy into the curriculum at every grade level. This growth would be impossible without the continued support of NEED's sponsors and partners at the national, state, and local level ho provide funding, time, energy, and technical assistance. NEED sponsors and partners believe in the importance of a comprehensive energy education program that helps teachers and students understand energy and its impacts on their world.

==Current NEED Energy Education Programs==
'''The Pacific Gas and Electric Company Solar Schools Program:'''

Begun in 2004, the PG&amp;E Solar Schools Program has installed over 100 solar photovoltaic electrical systems in K-12 public schools throughout its service area.
The program also funds free NEED energy education workshops and Bright Ideas grants of up to $10,000 for innovative educational projects.

'''Energizing Student Potential (ESP Program):'''

The Exelon Foundation, ComEd, Nicor Gas, Peoples Gas, North Shore Gas, and BP America, in partnership with the National Energy Education Development (NEED) Project, launched Energizing Student Potential, a STEM-focused energy program for grades 5 - 8 in their respective customer regions in Illinois and Indiana in the 2015-2016 school year. In 2016-2017, Energizing Student Potential launched in Washington, D.C. for District of Columbia Public Schools with support from Exelon Foundation and Pepco. Working with librarians and media specialists, the program welcomed 22 schools in January 2017. This program brings together standards-based curriculum for use in the classroom or in afterschool programs in public and private schools and the resources of the region's largest energy companies. The program will help schools meet Next Generation Science Standards and more. Energizing Student Potential is designed to help educators bring energy into the classroom and to provide all the tools and resources necessary for students and teachers to learn together, explore energy together, and teach their local communities about energy.

Approximately 120&amp;ndash;150 [[Neolithic Europe|Neolithic]] [[earthwork (archaeology)|earthworks]] [[enclosure (archaeology)|enclosures]] are known in [[Central Europe]].
They are called '''''Kreisgrabenanlagen'''''  ("circular ditched enclosures") in German, or alternatively as '''roundels''' (or "rondels"; German ''Rondelle''; sometimes also "rondeloid", since many are not even approximately circular). They are mostly confined to the [[Elbe]] and [[Danube]] basins, in  modern-day [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], as well as the adjacent parts of [[Hungary]] and [[Poland]],  in a stretch of [[Central Europe]]an land some 800&amp;nbsp;km (500&amp;nbsp;mi) across.&lt;ref&gt;map in Daim and Neubauer 2005, p. 14; reprinted in Plath 2011, p. 24. Main distribution is between the [[Danube Bend]] and the middle [[Elbe]], say between Budapest and Brunswick (800 km). Including outliers, the area is somewhat larger, encompassing most of [[Central Europe]], stretching over some 1100 km from the [[Danube-Drava National Park|Danube-Drava]] confluence to the lower Rhine (Ruhr area).&lt;/ref&gt;
They date to the first half of the 5th millennium  BC; they are  associated with the late [[Linear Pottery culture]] and its local successors, the [[Stroke-ornamented ware culture|Stroke-ornamented ware (Middle Danubian)]] and  [[Lengyel culture|Lengyel (Moravian Painted Ware)]]  cultures.  The best known and oldest of these Circular Enclosures is the [[Goseck circle]], constructed c. 4900 BC.

Only a few examples approximate a circular form; the majority are only very approximately circular or elliptic. One example at Meisternthal is an exact ellipse with identifiable focal points.
The distribution of these structures seems to suggest a spread from the middle Danube (southern Slovakia and western Hungary) towards the west ([[Lower Austria]], [[Lower Bavaria]]) along the Danube and to the northwest ([[Moravia]], [[Bohemia]], [[Saxony-Anhalt]]) following the [[Elbe]]. 
They precede the comparable circular [[henge|earthwork]] or [[Timber circle|timber]] enclosures known from [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]], constructed much later during c. 3000 to 1000 BC (late Neolithic to Bronze Age).
But, by contrast to the long lifetime of the "Megalithic" culture, the time window during which the  
neolithic ''Roundels'' were in use is surprisingly narrow, lasting only for about 200&amp;ndash;300 years (roughly 49th to 47th centuries BC).&lt;ref&gt;Holger Dambeck, [http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/natur/aelteste-hochkultur-europas-wirbel-um-angebliche-archaeologie-sensation-a-360246.html Wirbel um angebliche Archäologie-Sensation], ''Spiegel Online'',  13 June 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest roundel to be described was the one at Krpy ([[Kropáčova Vrutice]]), Bohemia,  by [[:cs:Jan Nepomuk Woldřich|Woldřich]] 1886, but it was only with systematic aerial survey in the 1980s and the 1990s that their ubiquity in the region became apparent. 
Three types have been distinguished:
*two semicircular ditches forming a circle and separated by causeways at opposing entrances.
* multiple circuits of ditches interrupted with entrances at cardinal or  astronomically-oriented points and also having an internal single or double timber [[palisade]]. 
* a single [[ring ditch]].

The structures are mostly interpreted as having served a [[Neolithic religion|cultic purpose]].
Most of them are aligned and seem to have served the function of a [[calendar]]  (''Kalenderbau''), in the context of [[archaeoastronomy]] sometimes dubbed "observatory", with openings aligned with the points sunrise and/or sunset at the [[solstice]]s. This is the case with the "gates" or openings of the roundels of  Quenstedt, Goseck and Quedlinburg. 
The observational determination of the time of solstice would not have served a practical (agricultural) purpose, but could have been used to maintain a [[lunisolar calendar]] (i.e. knowledge of the date of solstice allows an accurate handling of [[intercalary month]]s).&lt;ref&gt;Ralf Schwarz, ''Kreisgrabenanlagen der Stichbandkeramikkultur in Sachsen-Anhalt'', Neolithic Circular Enclosures in Europe, International Workshop in Goseck (Saxony-Anhalt, Germany) 7.-9. Mai 2004  ([http://www.praehist.uni-halle.de/workshop.pdf abstract]).

In 1995, professor [[Massimo Grattarola]] of the [[Biophysics]] and Electrical Engineering Department (DIBE) at the [[University of Genoa]], in [[Genoa]], [[Italy]], created an undergraduate and graduate program named '''neurobioengineering''' (also referred to as '''neuroengineering''').&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Marco Bove, In Memoriam Website for Dr. M. Grattarola, University of Genova, Italy - https://web.archive.org/web/20020714024312/http://www.bio.dibe.unige.it/people/Grattarola/grattarola.htm
&lt;/ref&gt; The program was designed to amalgamate [[anthropomorphic robot]]ics, [[artificial intelligence]], [[bioelectronics]],&lt;ref name="MOSFETs 1998"&gt;Bioelectronics - MOSFETs, Biosensors and Neurons - M.

Neurobioengineering deals with the study and application of bio-compatible neuro-prosthetic implants, neural sensors and interfaces with the nervous system.

The goal of that branch is to develop a bio-artificial brain of cultured neurons capable of replicating human behaviour in an artificial robotic system. The European Union F.E.T. funded the neurobioengineering department to pursue this ambitious project.&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Physics, Journal of Neural Engineering Vol 5, Issue 4. http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/1741-2552/2/4/E01/jne5_4_e01.pdf?request-id=6f3a87c4-a31f-486e-b2b0-3756a52e060c&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The neurobioengineering program spawned numerous journal publications by the departmental scientific pioneers (Dr. Marco Bove, Dr. Sergio Martinoia, Dr. Renato Zaccaria, and many others) and a university course textbook [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0070031746  Bioelectronics, MOSFETS, Biosensors and Neurons] &lt;ref name="MOSFETs 1998"/&gt; published by Massimo Grattarola. Members of the department were collaborating with researchers throughout the [[European Union]], [[Japan]] and [[North America]]. Students from throughout the [[European Union]] and [[Canada]] enrolled in the program.

==Comparable international efforts==
At the time (1995), a small number of universities offered specialized bioelectronics and/or implantable neuro-prostheses-related research (but no specialized undergraduate programs) internationally for example: [[University of Utah]], [[MIT]], [[UCSF]] ([[United States]]); [[McGill University]] ([[Canada]]), among others.

In 2003, following professor Grattarola's death, the University of Genova announced Europe's first neurobioengineering conference in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;Abstract Paper Neuroengineering School http://www.neuroinf.org/lists/comp-neuro/2003/0037.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; The First European School on Neuroengineering 'Massimo Grattarola' was also founded in 2004, with the goal of establishing a long-term formal educational program to foster future pioneers in neurobioengineering.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unige.it&lt;/ref&gt;

In a state of transition, the neurobioengineering department renamed itself the neuroengineering and bio-nanotechnology group in 2005. By 2008, the core researchers of the original department had formalized the educational process into a formal long-term program at the University of Genova named School of Neuroengineering, fulfilling Massimo Grattarola's original ambitions, offering degrees in Humanoid Technologies.&lt;ref&gt;# ^ Neuroengineering School http://www.neuro-it.net/pipermail/general/2003-April/000018.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The current and former neurobioengineering (or neuroengineering) students continue his research interests throughout Europe and North America, some of whom have established related businesses, or hold positions of authority in neuroscience/biomedical institutions worldwide.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9442">'''Orchid hunting''' is the search for [[Orchidaceae|orchid plants]] in the wild. The orchid plants are usually being acquired for the commercial market, where there was, and still is, significant demand for these unusual flowering plants.

==The Victorian era==
[[File:Swainson William 1789-1855.jpg|'''William John Swainson''', British [[ornithologist]] precursor of orchid hunting.|200px|thumb]] 
[[File:Ophrys speculum - Bot. Reg. 5 pl.370 (1819).jpg|Illustration of [[Ophrys|Ophrys speculum]] probably painted by William Swainson|200px|thumb]]

In 1818, [[William John Swainson]] was collecting plants in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. He sent a box of tropical plants he had acquired to London. As a packing material he used [[Orchidaceae|orchids]], which he believed were [[parasitic plants]]. Surprisingly, one of the orchids bloomed on arrival, and Londoners were astonished by the unusual shape and colors of the flower. That single flower triggered "orchid fever", which resulted in many deaths in pursuit of the plants.&lt;ref name="Orchid Discovery"/&gt; However, there is some evidence that this conventional story about using specimens of ''[[Cattleya labiata]]'' as packing material is just a myth - Swainson actually saw exceptionally showy flowers of this orchid and understood its real value. And upon arrival to Barnet orchids were provided with proper care&lt;ref&gt;[http://chadwickorchids.com/largeflowering A. A. Chadwick.  Large-Flowered Cattleya Species]&lt;/ref&gt;

About half of the orchid plants sent to Europe did not survive the trip. The demand grew, the plants became more and more expensive, and the profession of orchid hunter was created. Orchid hunters faced tropical diseases, wild animals and poisonous snakes, floods, native indigenous nations , and often fierce competition from each other.&lt;ref name="Orchid Discovery"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The orchid thief"/&gt;   

In 1901, eight orchid hunters went to look for rare orchids in the [[Philippines]]. One of the hunters was eaten by a tiger, another had oil spilled on him and was burned alive, and five others vanished completely. The man who survived the ordeal collected 7,000 orchid specimens.&lt;ref name="Twelve Portraits of the Dracula Orchid"/&gt;

Another group of orchid hunters in [[Papua New Guinea]] were captured and held hostage. Two members of the party were beheaded before Indonesian troops came to their rescue.&lt;ref name="NOVA"/&gt;
[[Colombia]] is said to be one of the best places to hunt for orchids, but it also used to be one of the hardest places to survive the hunt. William Arnold drowned in the fast and wild [[Orinoco River]] while on a collecting expedition; [[David Bowman (botanist)|David Bowman]] died from [[dysentery]]; and [[yellow fever]] killed Gustavo Wallis in the [[Andean mountains]].&lt;ref name="The orchid thief"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Twelve Portraits of the Dracula Orchid"/&gt;

Albert Millican was both a painter and orchid hunter. He knew that hunting for the orchids was a dangerous business. He wrote about his expedition's supplies:   
{{cquote|I provided myself with a stock of knives, cutlasses, revolvers, rifle&lt;ref name="TRAVELS AND ADVENTURES OF AN ORCHID HUNTER IN COLOMBIA"/&gt;}}

The competition between the hunters was intense. William Arnold got into a confrontation with another orchid hunter which almost ended up in a [[duel]]. When Arnold wrote about this to his employer, he was ordered to follow the other man, collect the same specimens he did, and try to urinate on the other man's collection in order to kill his orchids. No matter how homesick and lonely the orchid hunters were, they never made friends with their rivals.&lt;ref name="Twelve Portraits of the Dracula Orchid"/&gt;  

[[Wilhelm Micholitz]] was one of the best orchid  hunters. Once the boat he was on caught fire; the orchids he had collected perished, but Micholitz survived. He cabled the news to his employer Sander, and was ordered to return and to recollect, despite the fact that the rainy season made the collection of orchids all but impossible. One entry in Micholitz's diary was made in [[Bogota]]:
{{cquote|I do not know what I would not give to be back in the well-ordered British or Dutch Colonies in the East, to be able to do work in peace and comparative comfort.&lt;ref name="Wilhelm Micholitz "/&gt;}}

It was not surprising that Micholitz dreamed about peace after witnessing a horrific fight between locals in [[Papua New Guinea]]. The fight left many wounded and dead, three of whom were also beheaded, and one was missing his hands, feet and penis. Those locals were supposed to be helping Micholitz with his orchid search, but after the fight they refused to continue.&lt;ref name="The orchid thief"/&gt;   
    
Orchid hunters who survived their ordeals came home with incredible stories. They claimed that [[cannibals]] on the [[Solomon Islands]] tortured their human sacrifices with the most beautiful blooming orchids placed around them so that the victims were able to see the color of the flowers growing richer from their own blood. Fosterman, who was hunting for orchids in [[Brazil]], described his adventure in the "village of the demon flowers". He claimed that the orchids his party found there were the most beautiful he had ever seen, but he said that the flowers had a very bad smell, an odor that literally was strong enough to kill people. His men circled this village and saw abundant orchids everywhere, but because the smell was so deadly, the flowers were simply impossible to reach, like a lovely [[mirage]].&lt;ref name="The Orchid review"/&gt;

From 15 February to 16 March 2003, [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]] ran their ninth orchid festival with a theme: "In Search of Paradise". The exhibit included letters, diaries and paintings on the theme of "daring tales of Victorian exploration" and orchid hunting.&lt;ref name="In Search of Paradise "/&gt;

==Modern orchid hunting==
Modern orchid hunting is not without its dangers. [[Tom Hart Dyke]], a plant hunter who follows the tradition of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian]] orchid hunters, was held in 2000 by kidnappers thought to be [[FARC]] guerillas in the [[Darien Gap]] between [[Panama]] and [[Colombia]], while hunting for rare [[orchid]]s, a plant for which he has a particular passion. He and his travel companion, Paul Winder, were held captive for nine months, and threatened with death. Hart Dyke kept his morale up by creating a design for a garden containing plants collected on his trips, laid out in the shape of a world map, the plants being positioned according to the respective continents of their origin.&lt;ref name="Tom Hart Dyke"/&gt;

==== Subfields, by linguistic structures studied ====
Sub-fields of structure-focused linguistics include:

* [[Phonetics]] – study of the physical properties of speech (or signed) production and perception
* [[Phonology]] – study of sounds (or signs) as discrete, abstract elements in the speaker's mind that distinguish meaning
* [[Morphology (linguistics)|Morphology]] – study of internal structures of words and how they can be modified
* [[Syntax]] – study of how words combine to form grammatical [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s
* [[Semantics]] – study of the meaning of words ([[lexical semantics]]) and fixed word combinations ([[phraseology]]), and how these combine to form the [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]s of sentences
* [[Pragmatics]] – study of how [[utterance]]s are used in [[speech acts|communicative acts]] – and the role played by context and nonlinguistic knowledge in the transmission of meaning
* [[Discourse analysis]] – analysis of language use in [[Text (literary theory)|texts]] (spoken, written, or signed)
* [[Linguistic typology]] – comparative study of the similarities and differences between language structures in the world's languages.

==== Subfields, by nonlinguistic factors studied ====
* [[Applied linguistics]] – study of language-related issues applied in everyday life, notably language policies, planning, and education. ([[Constructed language]] fits under Applied linguistics.)
* [[Biolinguistics]] – study of natural as well as human-taught communication systems in animals, compared to human language.
* [[Clinical linguistics]] – application of linguistic theory to the field of [[Speech-Language Pathology]].
* [[Computational linguistics]] – study of linguistic issues in a way that is 'computationally responsible', i.e., taking careful note of computational consideration of algorithmic specification and computational complexity, so that the linguistic theories devised can be shown to exhibit certain desirable computational properties implementations.
* [[Developmental linguistics]] – study of the development of linguistic ability in individuals, particularly [[Language acquisition|the acquisition of language]] in childhood.
* [[Evolutionary linguistics]] – study of the origin and subsequent development of language by the human species.
* [[Historical linguistics]] – study of language change over time. Also called diachronic linguistics.
* [[Language geography]] – study of the geographical distribution of languages and linguistic features.
* [[Neurolinguistics]] – study of the structures in the human brain that underlie grammar and communication.
* [[Psycholinguistics]] – study of the cognitive processes and representations underlying language use.
* [[Sociolinguistics]] – study of variation in language and its relationship with social factors.
* [[Stylistics (linguistics)|Stylistics]] – study of linguistic factors that place a discourse in context.

'''Pandemonia''' is a character and persona created as [[conceptual art]] by an anonymous London-based artist that has appeared in the art and fashion world since 2009.&lt;ref name="Stylist"&gt;{{cite web|title=Meet Pandemonia|url=http://www.stylist.co.uk/fashion/londonfashionweek/meet-pandemonia |work=[[Stylist (magazine)|Stylist]] |accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clad in a latex full-head mask with stylized hair and latex dresses,&lt;ref name="Stylist"/&gt; Pandemonia is seven feet tall and was described by Katia Ganfield of ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' as "[[Roy Lichtenstein]]'s blonde caricatures ... brought to life as a 7 ft [[Jeff Koons]] inflatable".&lt;ref name="Vice"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pandemonia|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/pandemonia-roy-lichtenstein-inflatable-seven-foot-tall- |work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] |first=Katia |last=Ganfield |date=28 August 2011 |accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is often accompanied by an inflatable white dog named Snowy.&lt;ref name="Stylist"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vice"/&gt;

Pandemonia told ''[[Stylist (magazine)|Stylist]]'':
{{Quote|Back in 2008 the newspapers were full of celebrities. I was drawn towards creating art that documented our time. It seemed evident to me that the best way to parody this world would be to create my very own celebrity. I created a truly artificial one, in the spirit of consumerist values. Slim, tall, glossy, forever young and, of course, famous.&lt;ref name="Stylist"/&gt;}}

Initially a "[[gate crashing|crasher]]" at fashion and social events, Pandemonia eventually became a [[London Fashion Week]] VIP guest.&lt;ref name="Stylist"/&gt;

Pandemonia is a critical reflection and, as such, an intervention upon ideas of celebrity and femininity.  She is a pointed manifestation of how these ideas intersect with mass media, social media, and the marketability of desire. The art of Pandemonia herself is that of a constructed figure placed in the landscape of media, fashion and art events that has instigated the media response by feeding back to the media its own language, imagery and ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Focus On: Pandemonia (Interview) |url=http://www.vogue.it/people-are-talking-about/focus-on/2012/03/pandemonia |work=[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue Italia]] |date=12 March 2012 |first=Susanna |last=Cappellaro |accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=When I pop up in celebrity circles I can see the mechanism of fame from both the inside and outside. Just as celebrities presented their image to the public, I present the celebrities my image. At least I know I'm acting out celebrity. My dog, Snowy, breaks the ice. People relate to him. Funny how people relate to an inflatable dog, isn't it?|author=Pandemonia |source=&lt;ref name="Vice"/&gt;}}

The growth of Pandemonia's celebrity is one of the themes in her art, which also explores archetypes of pop myth and reality.&lt;ref name="Vice" /&gt;

Pandemonia’s art is not only cross-media (sculpture, digital art, photography, and performance), but also cross-generational as she ties the earliest moments of [[Pop Art]] to the most current worlds of celebrity, fashion and contemporary art, creating an arc and evolution which continues its ongoing exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oddamagazine.com/|title=ODDA Magazine Home Page|website=oddamagazine.com|access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Pandemonia was chosen by [[Camper (company)|Camper]] as the protagonist and muse for its Kobarah shoe style, and has been featured in stores and billboards in several major cities including Paris, London, New York, and Tokyo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Camper Celebrates Kobarah Shoe During Milan’s Salone Del Mobile|url=http://footwearnews.com/2016/fashion/designers/camper-kobarah-shoe-event-milan-salone-del-mobile-211601/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Permeable paver demonstration.jpg|thumb|300px|Permeable paving demonstration]]
[[File:Santarem carfree.JPG|thumb|right|[[Sett (paving)|Stone]] paving in [[Santarém, Portugal]]]]
'''Permeable paving''' is a method of paving vehicle and pedestrian pathways that allows for infiltration of fluids.  In pavement design the base is the top portion of the roadway that pedestrians or vehicles come into contact with.  The media used for the base of permeable paving may be porous, to allow for fluids to flow through it, or nonporous media that are spaced so that fluid may flow in between the gaps. In addition to reducing [[surface runoff]], permeable paving can trap suspended solids therefore filtering pollutants from stormwater.&lt;ref&gt;Interlocking Concrete Pavement Institute, http://www.icpi.org/sustainable&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include roads, paths, and [[parking lot]]s that are subject to light vehicular traffic, such as [[cycle-path]]s, service or emergency access lanes, road and airport shoulders, and residential [[sidewalks]] and driveways.

Although some porous paving materials appear nearly indistinguishable from nonporous materials, their environmental effects are qualitatively different.  Whether it is [[pervious concrete]], porous [[asphalt]], [[Paving stone (flooring)|paving stones]] or concrete or plastic-based pavers, all these permeable paving systems allow [[stormwater]] to percolate and infiltrate the surface areas, bypassing the traditionally [[impervious surface|impervious]] materials to the soil below. The goal is to control stormwater at the source, reduce runoff and improve water quality by filtering pollutants in the substrata layers.

== Description and applications ==
Permeable solutions can be based on: porous asphalt and concrete surfaces, concrete pavers (permeable interlocking concrete paving systems – PICP), or polymer-based grass pavers, grids and geocells. Porous pavements and concrete pavers (actually the voids in-between them) enable stormwater to drain through a stone base layer for on-site infiltration and filtering. Polymer based grass grid or cellular paver systems provide load bearing reinforcement for unpaved surfaces of gravel or turf.

Grass pavers, plastic turf reinforcing grids (PTRG), and geocells ([[cellular confinement systems]]) are honeycombed 3D grid-cellular systems, made of thin-walled [[HDPE]] plastic or other polymer alloys. These provide grass reinforcement, ground stabilization and gravel retention. The 3D structure reinforces infill and transfers vertical loads from the surface, distributing them over a wider area. Selection of the type of cellular grid depends to an extent on the surface material, traffic and loads. The cellular grids are installed on a prepared base layer of open-graded stone (higher void spacing) or engineered stone (stronger). The surface layer may be compacted gravel or topsoil seeded with grass and fertilizer. In addition to load support, the cellular grid reduces compaction of the soil to maintain permeability, while the roots improve permeability due to their root channels.&lt;ref&gt;Stormwater Management, http://www.epa.gov/oaintrnt/stormwater/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In new suburban growth, porous pavements protect [[drainage basin|watersheds]] by delaying and filtering the surge flow. In existing built-up areas and towns, redevelopment and reconstruction are opportunities to implement stormwater water management practices. Permeable paving is an important component in [[Low-impact development (Canada/US)|Low Impact Development]] (LID), a process for [[land development]] in the United States that attempts to minimize impacts on [[water quality]] and the similar concept of [[sustainable drainage system]]s (SuDS) in the United Kingdom.

The [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]] capacity of the native soil is a key design consideration for determining the depth of base rock for stormwater storage or for whether an underdrain system is needed.

== Advantages ==

=== Managing runoff ===

Permeable paving surfaces have been demonstrated as effective in managing [[surface runoff|runoff]] from [[Impervious Surfaces|paved surfaces]].&lt;ref&gt;Brattebo, B. O., and D. B. Booth. 2003. [http://depts.washington.edu/cwws/Research/Reports/permeableparking.pdf "Long-Term Stormwater Quantity and Quality Performance of Permeable Pavement Systems."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070327123757/http://depts.washington.edu/cwws/Research/Reports/permeableparking.pdf |date=2007-03-27 }} ''[[Water Research]].'' 37: 4369–4376. {{DOI|10.1016/S0043-1354(03)00410-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Washington, D.C. [http://www.epa.gov/owow/NPS/pavements.pdf "Field Evaluation of Permeable Pavements for Stormwater Management, Olympia, Washington."] Fact Sheet. October 2000. Document No. EPA-841-B-00-005B.&lt;/ref&gt; Large volumes of [[urban runoff]] causes serious [[erosion]] and [[silt]]ation in [[surface water]] bodies. Permeable pavers provide a solid ground surface, strong enough to take heavy loads, like large vehicles, while at the same time they allow water to filter through the surface and reach the underlying soils, mimicking natural ground absorption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chesapeakeecologycenter.org/?page_id=78|title=Permeable Pavers|website=www.chesapeakeecologycenter.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can reduce downstream flooding and stream bank erosion, and maintain base flows in rivers to keep ecosystems self-sustaining. Permeable pavers also combat erosion that occurs when grass is dry or dead, by replacing grassed areas in suburban and residential environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.belgard.com/knowledge_center/planning_materials/permeable_pavers|title=Permeable Pavers|last=Belgard|access-date=2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controlling pollutants ===
Permeable paving surfaces keep the [[water pollution|pollutants]] in place in the soil or other material underlying the roadway, and allow water seepage to [[groundwater recharge]] while preventing the stream erosion problems. They capture the [[heavy metals]] that fall on them, preventing them from washing downstream and accumulating inadvertently in the environment. In the void spaces, naturally occurring [[micro-organisms]] digest car oils, leaving little but [[carbon dioxide]] and water. Rainwater infiltration is usually less than that of an impervious pavement with a separate stormwater management facility somewhere downstream. {{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}.in areas where infiltration is not possible due to unsuitable soil conditions permeable pavements are used in the attenuation mode where water is retained in the pavement and slowly released to surface water systems between storm events.

=== Trees ===
Permeable pavements may give urban trees the rooting space they need to grow to full size. A "structural-soil" pavement base combines structural [[construction aggregate|aggregate]] with soil; a porous surface admits vital air and water to the rooting zone. This integrates healthy ecology and thriving cities, with the living tree canopy above, the city's traffic on the ground, and living tree roots below. The benefits of permeables on urban tree growth have not been conclusively demonstrated and many researchers have observed tree growth is not increased if construction practices compact materials before permeable pavements are installed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Volder|first=A|author2=Watson, Viswanathan|title=Potential use of pervious concrete for maintaining existing mature trees during and after urban development|journal=Urban For. Urban Gree.|year=2009|volume=8|issue=4|pages=249–256|doi=10.1016/j.ufug.2009.08.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morgenroth|first=J|author2=Visser|title=Aboveground growth response of Platanus orientalis to porous pavements|journal=Arboriculture &amp; Urban Forestry|year=2011|volume=37|issue=1|pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disadvantages ==

=== Runoff Volumes ===
Permeable pavements are designed to replace Effective Impervious Areas (EIAs), not to manage stormwater from other impervious surfaces on site. Use of this technique must be part of an overall on site management system for stormwater, and is not a replacement for other techniques.

During large storm event, the water table below the porous pavement can rise to a higher level, preventing the precipitation from being absorbed into the ground. Some additional water is stored in the open graded / crushed drain rock base, and remains until the subgrade can absorb the water. For clay-based soils, or other low to 'non'-draining soils, it is important to increase the depth of the crushed drain rock base to allow additional capacity for the water as it waits to be infiltrated.

The best way to prevent this problem is to understand the soil infiltration rate, and design the pavement and base depths to meet the volume of water. Or, allow for adequate rain water run off at the pavement design stage.

=== Pollutant load ===
Runoff across some land uses may become contaminated, where pollutant concentrations exceed those typically found in stormwater. These "hot spots" include commercial [[Plant nursery|plant nurseries]], [[recycling]] facilities, [[Filling station|fueling stations]], industrial storage, [[marina]]s, some outdoor [[Loading dock|loading facilities]], public works yards, hazardous materials generators (if containers are exposed to rainfall), vehicle service and maintenance areas, and vehicle and equipment washing and steam cleaning facilities. Since porous pavement is an infiltration practice, it should not be applied at stormwater hot spots due to the potential for groundwater contamination. All contaminated runoff should be prevented from entering municipal storm drain systems by using [[Best management practice for water pollution|best management practices]] (BMPs) for the specific industry or activity.&lt;ref&gt;Capital Regional District. Victoria, BC. [http://www.crd.bc.ca/watersheds/regulations.htm "Regulating Stormwater Discharges."] Accessed 2010-03-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Weight and traffic volumes ===
Reference sources differ on whether low or medium traffic volumes and weights are appropriate for porous pavements. For example, around truck loading docks and areas of high commercial traffic, porous pavement is sometimes cited as being inappropriate. However, given the variability of products available, the growing number of existing installations in North America and targeted research by both manufacturers and user agencies, the range of accepted applications seems to be expanding. Some concrete paver companies have developed products specifically for industrial applications. Working examples exist at fire halls, busy retail complex parking lots, and on public and private roads, including intersections in parts of North America with quite severe winter conditions.

=== Siting ===
Permeable pavements may not be appropriate when land surrounding or draining into the pavement exceeds a 20 percent slope, where pavement is down slope from buildings or where foundations have piped drainage at their footers. The key is to ensure that drainage from other parts of a site is intercepted and dealt with separately rather than being directed onto permeable surfaces.

=== Climate ===
Cold climates may present special challenges. Road salt contains chlorides that could migrate through the porous pavement into groundwater. Snow plow blades could catch block edges and damage surfaces. Sand cannot be used for snow and ice control on porous surfaces because it will plug the pores and reduce permeability.  Although there are design modifications to reduce the risks, infiltrating runoff may freeze below the pavement, causing frost heave. Another issue is spalling damage. Spalling damage exclusively occurs on porous concrete pavement from salt application during the winter season. Thus porous paving is suggested for warmer climates. However, other materials have proven to be effective, even lowering winter maintenance costs by preserving salt in the pavement itself. This also reduces the amount of storm water runoff that is contaminated with salt chlorides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://stormwater.wef.org/2012/01/porous-pavement-performance-in-cold-climates/|title=Porous Pavement Performance in Cold Climates - The Stormwater Report|date=2012-01-05|work=The Stormwater Report|access-date=2018-03-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Porous pavement designed to reduce frost heave and spalling damage has been used successfully in Norway. Furthermore, experience suggests that preventative measures with rapid drainage below porous surfaces be taken in order to increase the rate of snow melt above ground.

=== Cost ===
Some estimates put the cost of permeable paving at two to three times that of conventional asphalt paving. Using permeable paving, however, can reduce the cost of providing larger or more stormwater BMPs on site, and these savings should be factored into any cost analysis. In addition, the off-site environmental impact costs of not reducing on-site stormwater volumes and pollution have historically been ignored or assigned to other groups (local government parks, public works and environmental restoration budgets, fisheries losses, etc.) The City of [[Olympia, Washington]] is studying the use of pervious concrete quite closely and finding that new stormwater regulations are making it a viable alternative to storm water.

=== Longevity and maintenance ===
Some permeable pavements require frequent maintenance because grit or gravel can block the open pores. This is commonly done by industrial vacuums that suck up all the sediment. If maintenance is not carried out on a regular basis, the porous pavements can begin to function more like impervious surfaces. With more advanced paving systems the levels of maintenance needed can be greatly decreased, [[#Bound recycled glass porous pavement|elastomerically bound glass pavements]] requires less maintenance than regular concrete paving as the glass bound pavement has 50% more void space.

Plastic grid systems, if selected and installed correctly, are becoming more and more popular with local government maintenance personnel owing to the reduction in maintenance efforts: reduced gravel migration and weed suppression in public park settings.

Some permeable paving products are prone to damage from misuse, such as drivers who tear up patches of plastic &amp; gravel grid systems by "joy riding" on remote parking lots at night. The damage is not difficult to repair but can look unsightly in the meantime. Grass pavers require supplemental watering in the first year to establish the vegetation, otherwise they may need to be re-seeded. Regional climate also means that most grass applications will go dormant during the dry season. While brown vegetation is only a matter of aesthetics, it can influence public support for this type of permeable paving.

Traditional permeable concrete paving bricks tend to lose their color in relatively short time which can be costly to replace or clean and is mainly due to the problem of [[efflorescence]].

=== Efflorescence ===
{{Main|Efflorescence}}
Efflorescence is a hardened [[crystalline]] deposit of [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]], principally [[calcium carbonate]]s, which migrate from the center of concrete or masonry materials to the surface, where they form insoluble deposits that harden on the surface.  Efflorescence usually appears white, gray or black depending on the region.

Over time, efflorescence begins to degrade the overall appearance of masonry/concrete and may cause the surfaces to become slippery when exposed to moisture. If left unchecked, this efflorescence will harden whereby the calcium/lime deposits begin to affect the integrity of the cementitious surface by slowly eroding away the cement paste and aggregate.  In some cases it will also discolor stained or coated surfaces.

Efflorescence forms more quickly in areas that are exposed to excessive amounts of moisture, such as near pool decks, spas, and fountains or where irrigation runoff is present.  The affected regions become very slick when wet. This can be of serious concern especially as a public safety issue to individuals, principals and property owners by exposing them to possible injury and increased general liability claims.

Efflorescence remover chemicals can be used to remove calcium/lime build-up without damaging the integrity of the paving surface.

== Types of Permeable Pavement ==
Installation of porous pavements is no more difficult than that of dense pavements, but has different specifications and procedures which must be strictly adhered to. Nine different families of porous paving materials present distinctive advantages and disadvantages for specific applications. Here are examples:

=== Pervious concrete ===
{{main|Pervious concrete}}
Pervious concrete is widely available, can bear frequent traffic, and is universally accessible. Pervious concrete quality depends on the installer's knowledge and experience.&lt;ref name="Pervious Concrete"&gt;EPA. ''National Menu of Stormwater Best Management Practices.'' 2009-09-10. [http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/stormwater/menuofbmps/index.cfm?action=browse&amp;Rbutton=detail&amp;bmp=137&amp;minmeasure=5 "Pervious Concrete Pavement."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100622224413/http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/stormwater/menuofbmps/index.cfm?action=browse&amp;Rbutton=detail&amp;bmp=137&amp;minmeasure=5 |date=2010-06-22 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plastic Grids ===
Plastic grids allow for a 100% porous system using structural grid systems for containing and stabilizing either gravel or turf. These grids come in a variety of shapes and sizes depending on use; from pathways to commercial parking lots. These systems have been used readily in Europe for over a decade, but are gaining popularity in North America due to requirements by government for many projects to meet [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] environmental building standards. Plastic grid system are also  popular with homeowners due to their lower cost to install, ease of installation, and versatility. The ideal design for this type of grid system is a closed cell system, which prevents gravel/sand/turf from migrating laterally.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} It is also known as Grass pavers / Turf Pavers in India.&lt;ref name="Plastic Grids"&gt;[http://www.grasspavers.in "Grass Pavers"] / [http://www.turfpavers.in "Turf Pavers"]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Porous asphalt ===
'''Porous asphalt''' is produced and placed using the same methods as conventional [[asphalt concrete]]; it differs in that fine (small) aggregates are omitted from the asphalt mixture. The remaining large, single-sized  aggregate particles leave open voids that give the material its porosity and permeability. To ensure pavement strength, fiber may be added to the mix or a polymer-modified asphalt binder may be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hansen | first1 = Kent | title = IS-131: Porous Asphalt Pavements for Stormwater Management | publisher = National Asphalt Pavement Association | year = 2008 | location = Lanham, Maryland | pages = 16 | accessdate = 2013-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, porous asphalt pavements are designed with a subsurface reservoir that holds water that passes through the pavement, allowing it to evaporate and/or percolate slowly into the surround soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://porouspavement.net | title = Porous Asphalt | accessdate = 2013-01-15 | author = National Asphalt Pavement Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''National Menu of Stormwater Best Management Practices.'' 2009-09-10. {{cite web|title=Porous Asphalt Pavement|url=http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/stormwater/menuofbmps/index.cfm?action=browse&amp;Rbutton=detail&amp;bmp=135&amp;minmeasure=5|work=Porous Asphalt Pavement|publisher=EPA|accessdate=18 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927041118/http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/stormwater/menuofbmps/index.cfm?action=browse&amp;Rbutton=detail&amp;bmp=135&amp;minmeasure=5|archivedate=27 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Open-graded friction courses'' (OGFC) are a porous asphalt surface course used on highways to improve driving safety by removing water from the surface. Unlike a full-depth porous asphalt pavement, OGFCs do not drain water to the base of a pavement. Instead, they allow water to infiltrate the top 3/4 to 1.5 inch of the pavement and then drain out to the side of the roadway. This can improve the friction characteristics of the road and reducing road spray.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Caltrans | authorlink1 = California Department of Transportation | title = Open Graded Friction Course Usage Guide | date = 8 Feb 2006 | year = 2008 | location = Sacramento, California | url = http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/esc/Translab/ofpm/pdf/FrictionCourseGuide.pdf | accessdate = 2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Single-sized aggregate ===
'''Single-sized aggregate''' without any binder, e.g. loose gravel, stone-chippings, is another alternative. Although it can only be safely used in walkways and very low-speed, low-traffic settings, e.g. car-parks and drives, its potential cumulative area is great.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

=== Porous turf ===
[[Image:Rasenpflasterstein 1.jpg|thumb|Grass pavement]]

'''Permeable clay brick pavements''' are fired clay brick units with open, permeable spaces between the units. Clay pavers provide a durable surface that allows stormwater runoff to permeate through the joints.

=== Resin bound paving ===
{{Main|Resin bound paving}}
'''Resin bound paving''' is a mixture of resin binder and aggregate.  Clear resin is used to fully coat each aggregate particle before laying.  Enough resin is used to allow each aggregate particle to adhere to one another and to the base yet leave voids for water to permeate through.  Resin bound paving provides a strong and durable surface that is suitable for pedestrian and vehicular traffic in applications such as pathways, driveways, car parks and access roads.

== Definition of policy networks ==

Although the number of definitions is almost as large as the number of approaches of analysis, [[R. A. W. Rhodes|Rhodes]]&lt;ref name="rhodes2008" /&gt;{{rp|426}} aims to offer a minimally exclusive starting point: "Policy networks are sets of formal institutional and informal linkages between governmental and other actors structured around shared if endlessly negotiated beliefs and interests in public policy making and implementation."

== Possible typologies of policy networks ==

As Thatcher&lt;ref name="thatcher1998" /&gt;{{rp|391}} notes, policy network approaches initially aimed to model specific forms of state-interest group relations, without giving exhaustive typologies.

=== Policy communities vs. Issue networks ===

The most widely used paradigm of the 1970s and 1980s only analyzed two specific types of policy networks: policy communities and issue networks. Justifications of the usage of these concepts were deduced from empirical case studies.&lt;ref name="thatcher1998"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Thatcher | first = Mark | title = The development of policy network analyses: from modest origins to overarching frameworks | journal = [[Journal of Theoretical Politics]] | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages = 389–416 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0951692898010004002 | date = October 1998 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0951692898010004002 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Policy Communities in which you refer to relatively slowly changing networks defining the context of policy-making in specific policy segments. The network links are generally perceived as the relational ties between bureaucrats, politicians and interest groups. The main characteristic of policy communities – compared to issue networks – is that the boundaries of the networks are more stable and more clearly defined. This concept was studied in the context of policy-making in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="thatcher1998"/&gt;

In contrast, [[issue networks]] – a concept established in literature about United States government - refer to a looser system, where a relatively large number of stakeholders are involved. Non-government actors in these networks usually include not only interest group representatives but also professional or academic experts.  An important characteristic of issue network is that membership is constantly changing, interdependence is often asymmetric and – compared to policy communities – it is harder to identify dominant actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Heclo | first = Hugh | contribution = Issue networks and the executive establishment | editor-last = King | editor-first = Anthony | title = The new American political system | pages = 87–124 | publisher = American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research | location = Washington | year = 1978 | isbn = 9780844733159 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other possible typologies ===

New typological approaches appeared in the early 1990s and late 1980s with the aim of grouping policy networks into a system of mutually exclusive and commonly exhaustive categories.&lt;ref name="thatcher1998"/&gt; One possible logic of typology is based on the degree of integration, membership size and distribution of resources in the network.  This categorization – perhaps most importantly represented by R. A. W. Rhodes – allows the combination of policy communities and issue networks with categories like professional network, intragovernmental network and producer network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Marsh | first1 = David | last2 = Rhodes | first2 = R.A.W. | author-link2 = R. A. W. Rhodes | title = Policy networks in British government | publisher = Clarendon Press Oxford University Press | location = Oxford Oxford New York | year = 1992 | isbn = 9780198278528 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other approaches identify categories based on distinct patterns of state-interest group relations. Patterns include corporatism and pluralism, [[Iron triangle (US politics)|iron triangles]], subgovernment and [[clientelism]] while the differentiation is based on membership, stability and sectorality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jordan | first1 = Grant | last2 = Schubert | first2 = Klaus | title = A preliminary ordering of policy network labels | journal = [[European Journal of Political Research]] | volume = 21 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 7–27 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1475-6765.1992.tb00286.x | date = February 1992 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1475-6765.1992.tb00286.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Roles of policy network analysis ==

As the field of policy network analysis grew since the late 20th century, scholars developed competing descriptive, theoretical and prescriptive accounts. Each type gives different specific content for the term policy network and uses different research methodologies.&lt;ref name=rhodes2008/&gt;

=== Descriptive usage ===

For several authors, policy networks describe specific forms of government policy-making. The three most important forms are interest intermediation, interorganizational analysis, and governance.&lt;ref name=rhodes2008/&gt;

==== Interest intermediation ====

An approach developed from the literature on US pluralism, policy networks are often analyzed in order to identify the most important actors influencing governmental decision-making. From this perspective, a network-based assessment is useful to describe power positions, the structure of [[oligopoly]] in political markets, and the institutions of interest negotiation.&lt;ref name=rhodes2008/&gt;

==== Interorganizational analysis ====

Another branch of descriptive literature, which emerged from the study of European politics, aims to understand the interdependency in decision-making between formal political institutions and the corresponding organizational structures. This viewpoint emphasizes the importance of overlapping organizational responsibilities and the distribution of power in shaping specific policy outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rhodes | first = R.A.W. | author-link = R. A. W. Rhodes | title = Control and power in central-local government relations | publisher = Ashgate | location = Aldershot, Hants, England Brookfield, Vermont | edition = revised | year = 1999 | isbn = 9781840147780 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Governance ====

A third direction of descriptive scholarship is to describe general patterns of policy-making – the formal institutions of power-sharing between government, independent state bodies and the representatives of employer and labor interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Nielsen | first1 = Klaus | last2 = Pedersen | first2 = Ove K. | title = The negotiated economy: ideal and history | journal = [[Scandinavian Political Studies]] | volume = 11 | issue = 2 | page = 101 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9477.1988.tb00361.x | date = June 1998 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9477.1988.tb00361.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://tidsskrift.dk/index.php/scandinavian_political_studies/article/view/12990/24777 Text.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hall | first1 = Peter A. | last2 = Soskice | first2 = David W. | title = Varieties of capitalism : the institutional foundations of comparative advantage | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford England New York | year = 2001 | isbn = 9780199247752 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theoretical usage ===

The two most important theoretical approaches aiming to understand and explain actor's behavior in policy networks are the following: power dependence and rational choice.&lt;ref name=rhodes2008/&gt;

==== Power dependence ====

In power dependence models, policy networks are understood as mechanism of exchanging resources between organizations in the networks. The dynamic of exchange is determined by the comparative value of resources (f.e. legal, political or financial in nature) and individual capacities to deploy them in order create better bargaining positions and achieve higher degrees of autonomy.&lt;ref name=rhodes2008/&gt;

==== Rational Choice ====

In policy network analysis, theorists complement standard rational choice arguments with the insights of [[new institutionalism]]. This "actor-centered institutionalism" is used to describe policy networks as structural arrangements between relatively stable sets of public and private players. Rational choice theorists identify [[Node (networking)|links]] between network actors as channels to exchange multiple goods (f.e. knowledge, resources and information).&lt;ref name=rhodes2008/&gt;

=== Prescriptive usage ===

The prescriptive literature on policy networks focuses on the phenomenon's role in constraining or enabling certain governmental action. From this viewpoint, networks are seen as central elements of the realm of policy-making at least partially defining the desirability of status quo – thus a possible target of reform initiatives.&lt;ref name=rhodes2008/&gt; The three most common network management approaches are the following: instrumental (a focus on altering dependency relation), institutional (a focus on rules, incentives and culture) and interactive (a focus on communication and negotiation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Kickert | first1 = Walter J.M. | last2 = Klijn | first2 = Erik-Hans | last3 = Koppenjan | first3 = Joop F.M. | author-link1 = Walter Kickert | title = Managing complex networks strategies for the public sector | publisher = Sage | location = London Thousand Oaks, California | year = 1997 | isbn = 9781446217658 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== New directions and debates ==

As Rhodes&lt;ref name=rhodes2008/&gt; points out, there is a long-lasting debate in the field about general theories predicting the emergence of specific networks and corresponding policy outcomes depending on specific conditions. No theories have succeeded in achieving this level of generality yet and some scholars doubt they ever will. Other debates are focusing on describing and theorizing change in policy networks. While some political scientists state that this might not be possible,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Richardson | first = Jeremy | title = Government, interest groups and policy change | journal = [[Political Studies (journal)|Political Studies]] | volume = 48 | issue = 5 | pages = 1006–1025 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/1467-9248.00292 | date = December 2000 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1467-9248.00292 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; other scholars have made efforts towards the understanding of policy network dynamics. One example is the advocacy coalition framework, which aims to analyze the effect of commonly represented beliefs (in coalitions) on policy outcomes.&lt;ref name=rhodes2008/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Nedergaard | first = Peter | author-link = Peter Nedergaard | title = The reform of the 2003 Common Agricultural Policy: an advocacy coalition explanation | journal = Policy Studies | volume = 29 | issue = 2 | pages = 179–195 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/01442870802033464 | date = June 2008 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01442870802033464 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Postgraduate Training in Education (disambiguation)}}
The '''Postgraduate Diploma in Education''' ('''PGDE'''), also known as a '''Graduate Diploma of Education''' ('''GradDipEd'''), is a one-year postgraduate course in several countries including [[Australia]], [[Ghana]], [[New Zealand]], [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Scotland]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Singapore]] and [[Zimbabwe]] for existing [[bachelor's degree]] holders leading to become a qualified teacher.

The [[professional certification|qualification]] is normally taught at a [[university]] or other [[higher education]] institution, though much of the course time is spent on placements in local schools. For example, in the Hong Kong programmes, most schools will have lesson time for about 20 weeks, and another 14 weeks (usually taken in 6 weeks for the first semester and 8 weeks for the second semester) for placements.

In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the former ''Higher Diploma in Education'' (H.Dip.Ed.) was renamed as the PGDE from 2007 onwards.

The [[Postgraduate Certificate in Education]] (PGCE) is the equivalent of the PGDE in [[England]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]] and historically in [[Scotland]]. Some universities, for instance [[Durham University]] award PGDE on successful completion of 120 University Credit Units (UCU) of a Master of Arts Education course (i.e., completing two years). The PGCE is awarded after 60UCUs.

She has spoken at conferences, student forums, businesses, and churches around the United States, and advocates using [[debit card]]s instead of [[credit card]]s as a way to control spending, and to never spend beyond one's means, which "requires a discipline and a mindset that often goes against the grain of our instantly gratified society," she said in an interview in the ''[[Kansas City Star]]''.&lt;ref name=twsKCStar/&gt;

The '''recursive join''' is an operation used in [[relational databases]], also sometimes called a "fixed-point join". It is a compound operation that involves repeating the [[join (SQL)|join]] operation, typically accumulating more records each time, until a repetition makes no change to the results (as compared to the results of the previous iteration).

For example, if a database of family relationships is to be searched, and the record for each person has "mother" and "father" fields, a recursive join would be one way to retrieve all of a person's known ancestors: first the person's direct parents' records would be retrieved, then the parents' information would be used to retrieve the grandparents' records, and so on until no new records are being found.

In this example, as in many real cases, the repetition involves only a single database table, and so is more specifically a "recursive self-join".

Recursive joins can be very time-consuming unless optimized through indexing, the addition of extra key fields, or other techniques.

Recursive joins are highly characteristic of hierarchical data, and therefore become a serious issue with [[XML]] data. In XML, operations such as determining whether one element contains another are extremely common, and the recursive join is perhaps the most obvious way to implement them when the XML data is stored in a relational database.

The standard way to define recursive joins in the [[SQL:1999]] standard is by way of recursive [[common table expressions]]. Database management systems that support recursive CTEs include [[Microsoft SQL Server]], [[Oracle Database|Oracle]], [[PostgreSQL]] and others.

[[File:Actroid-DER 01.jpg|right|thumb|200px|An [[Actroid]] manufactured by Kokoro Company Ltd.]]
'''Robot fetishism''' (also '''ASFR''' or '''technosexuality'''&lt;ref name="asfr"&gt;"ASFR", documentary short by filmmaker Allison de Fren, 2004 [http://www.ifilm.com/ifilmdetail/2408202 (streaming video)]&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Sexual fetishism|fetishistic]] attraction to [[humanoid robot]]s; also to people acting like robots or people dressed in robot costumes. A less common fantasy involves transformation into a robot. In these ways it is similar to [[agalmatophilia]], which involves attraction to or transformation into [[statue]]s or [[mannequin]]s.&lt;ref name="asfr" /&gt;

Robot fetishism can be viewed as a form of erotic [[anthropomorphism]].&lt;ref name="asfr" /&gt; When transformation or roleplaying is involved it can be thought of as a form of [[erotic objectification]].&lt;ref name="asfr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="metro"&gt;"Let's mech love", by Lisa Scott, [[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|''Metro daily paper'']], 7 February 2007 [http://www.metro.co.uk/metrosexual/article.html?in_article_id=36440 (web page)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==ASFR==
By its enthusiasts, robot fetishism is more commonly referred to by the initials "ASFR". This initialism stems from the now-defunct [[Usenet]] [[newsgroup]] ''alt.sex.fetish.robots''. Many devotees of this fetish refer to themselves as [[technosexual]],&lt;ref name="metro" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bizarre"&gt;"Acting Like a Sex Machine", by Kate Hodges, [[Bizarre (magazine)|''Bizarre Magazine'']], October 2004&lt;/ref&gt; or as "ASFRians".&lt;ref name="asfr" /&gt; ASFR can be divided into two distinct but sometimes overlapping types of fantasies.&lt;ref name="metro" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bizarre" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ddiss"&gt;"Deviant Desires: Incredibly Strange Sex", by [[Katharine Gates]], Juno Books (October 1999), {{ISBN|1-890451-03-7}} [http://www.deviantdesires.com/map/robots.html (web page)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of these is simply a desire to have a ready-made [[android (robot)|android]] partner. This partner can be desired for sex, companionship, or any combination of the two. The main distinguishing feature of this fantasy is that the android is a completely artificial construct, often manufactured solely to fulfil the wishes of its owner. This type of fantasy or situation is referred to as "built".&lt;ref name="asfr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bizarre" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sextv"&gt;"Remote Control: Romancing the Robot" (clip only), ''[[SexTV]]'' documentary episode featuring interviews with members of the ASFR community [https://web.archive.org/web/20060716141605/http://www.sextelevision.net/videoplayer/?segmentID=401&amp;n=1 (streaming video)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The second type of fantasy prevalent within ASFR is referred to as "transformation". This involves a human who has been either willingly or unwillingly turned into an android. That person can be either oneself or one's partner, or both. It is usually the process of transformation (through whatever means it is achieved) that is the focus of this fantasy.&lt;ref name="asfr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bizarre" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sextv" /&gt;

Many people in the ASFR community prefer either one or the other.&lt;ref name="metro" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bizarre" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sextv" /&gt; In some cases this preference is very strong, and people can be as equally repelled by one type as they are attracted to the other. In other cases, there is as much appreciation for built as there is for transformation.&lt;ref name="ddiss" /&gt; A recent informal survey of ASFR community members found that two thirds prefer built while the remainder prefer transformation or some combination of both.&lt;ref name="fc"&gt;"Transformation vs. Built Poll", Fembot Central Message Board, Sept. 26, 2006 [http://www.fembotcentral.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=4722&amp;sid=6bf74fe352be20c70f2cbfca9f3e49fc (web page)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nova BanzaiBaby01.jpg|left|thumb|200px|An example of ASFR art.]]
The aspects of this fetish that are most appreciated by members of the ASFR community are greatly varied. For some, things like robotic appearance, motion, or sound are important for arousal.&lt;ref name="metro" /&gt; For others, these are not, and a completely lifelike android that appears to be human is desired.&lt;ref name="ddiss" /&gt; This holds true for other aspects, such as [[sentience]] or [[self-awareness]]. The ability of the android to remove parts of its skin or other bodily appendages in order to reveal its circuitry is quite pleasing to some, but distasteful to others.&lt;ref name="ddiss" /&gt; There is a further divide between those who prefer an android to appear human-like and those who would prefer a more mechanical looking robot, i.e. with a metallic surface.

As realistic androids and humanoid robots do not currently exist in a form readily available to the consumer,&lt;ref name="metro" /&gt; this fetish can only be acted upon in a limited number of ways. Primarily this is done through fantasy, involving either [[Masturbation|self stimulation]] or [[sexual roleplaying]] with a partner.&lt;ref name="ddiss" /&gt; ASFR art is therefore important to aid in the reinforcement of imagination.&lt;ref name="asfr" /&gt;

Art with ASFR content includes but is not limited to [[science fiction]] movies, music videos,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOKPuO-XLF4 Electrosexual Fetish (ASFR) Video Directed by Mashyno]&lt;/ref&gt; television shows, novels, short stories, illustrations, [[Digital image editing|manipulated photographs]], songs and even television commercials.&lt;ref name="exotic"&gt;"Wrong Turns Down The Sex-Info-Highway 5.07", by Martine Duplessis, ''Exotic Magazine'', 1996 [http://www.xmag.com/archives/5-07-jan98/sexhiway.html (web page)]&lt;/ref&gt; Such works are sought after by technosexuals since economically viable androids are not yet available. Realistic [[sex doll]]s such as the [[RealDoll]] may provide a way to explore this fetish with existing technology. Recent developments in robotics and [[artificial intelligence]], such as those seen in the [[Actroid]] or [[EveR-1]] may lead to the production of more advanced synthetic partners.&lt;ref name="asfr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="metro" /&gt;

It is also worth noting that some ASFRians do not wish to use synthetic partners at all, and instead would prefer human partners to participate in forms of fantasy play.&lt;ref name="ddiss" /&gt;

==Controversy==
{{Main|Hashima_Island#World_Heritage_Site_approval_controversy}}
The inclusion of some of these properties as UNESCO Heritage sites faced concerns and objections from Korea, due to the fact that conscripted Korean civilians and Chinese prisoners-of-war were forced to work under harsh conditions at seven of these sites during Japan's [[World War II]] mobilization policies. Recent academic research has questioned the Japanese government's compliance with UNESCO regulations and requirements with respect to the Hashima site.&lt;ref&gt;https://apjjf.org/2018/01/Palmer.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sultanganj Buddha''' is a [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]]-[[Pala Empire|Pala]] transitional period sculpture, the largest substantially complete copper Buddha figure known from the time. The statue is dated by archaeologists to between 500 and 700 AD. It is 2.3 m high and 1 m wide and weighs over 500&amp;nbsp;kg. It was found in the [[North India]]n town of [[Sultanganj]], [[Bhagalpur district]], [[Bihar]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/birmingham/content/articles/2006/05/10/sultanganj_buddha_feature.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; in 1861 during the construction  of the [[East Indian Railway]].&lt;ref name="Wingfield"&gt;Wingfield, Christopher (2010) Touching the Buddha: Encounters with a charismatic object. In Museum Materialities: Objects, Engagements, Interpretations, ed. Sandra H. Dudley, Routledge: London &amp; New York, pp.53-70. http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415492188/&lt;/ref&gt; It is now held by [[Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery]], [[Birmingham]], [[England]].

==Description==
The Sultanganj Buddha was cast in pure, unrefined copper by the ''cire perdue'', or [[list-wax casting|lost wax]], technique. It stands with his right hand raised in ''[[abhayamudra]]'' (a gesture of reassurance or protection), and his left hand is held downwards with palm outwards, said to indicate granting a favour. The end of the monastic robe is held between the thumb and forefinger of this hand in the manner that is still practised by [[Theravada|Theravadin]] monks.

==Discovery and later history==

[[File:Sultanganj Buddha.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Stone statue of Buddha from Sultanganj in the [[British Museum]] Lotus petals inscribed with "[[Ye Dharma Hetu]]" mantra]]
E. B. Harris, the railway engineer who discovered the Buddha during excavations that he carried out on ancient remains near the Sultanganj station that he was constructing, published a detailed account of his work, complete with a site plan and photographs. He describes finding the right foot of the Buddha ten feet under the surface, beneath a floor he considered to have been used to conceal the statue after it had been toppled from its former place.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, E. B. (1864) Description of Buddhist Remains Discovered at Sooltangunge, London: privately published.&lt;/ref&gt; Harris sent the statue to Birmingham, the cost of its transport to England being paid by Samuel Thornton, a Birmingham manufacturer of ironmongery. Thornton, himself a former mayor of Birmingham, offered it to the [[Birmingham City Council|Borough Council]] for their proposed Art Museum in 1864. In Birmingham, a town that boasted a thousand trades, the Art Museum was intended to be an exemplar and inspiration for local metalworkers and other artisans.

Over the years, it has been shown in a number of prominent locations throughout [[Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery]] (BMAG) and remains an indispensable display item. It was the foundation donation to the collections and is BMAG's most treasured possession.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bmagic.org.uk/objects/1885A1116&lt;/ref&gt; Harris's report shows him with the Buddha and a number of smaller finds. They included two much smaller standing Buddhas in stone: one is now in the [[British Museum]] and the other in the [[Asian Art Museum of San Francisco]]. A stone Buddha head, also from Sultanganj, is now in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], London.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=5098&amp;partId=1&amp;place=39987&amp;plaA=39987-2-11&amp;page=1 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://searchcollection.asianart.org/view/objects/asitem/id/19594 Asian Art Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O64237/head-of-the-buddha-sculpture-unknown/ Victoria and Albert Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current location==
From 1998 to 2015, the Buddha was the centrepiece of a gallery at Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery dedicated to displaying a number of Buddhas and related artefacts, and Birmingham Museum held an annual 'Buddha Day', when West Midlands-based Buddhist groups from a range of traditions would bless the statue.

During 2015, Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery worked with representatives of a number of faith groups from the city on the creation of a new 'Faith Gallery', and the Sultanganj Buddha was moved from its previous location. It is now displayed in a new gallery that tells the story of the range of faiths that are practiced in Birmingham.

The object has been detected by numerous [[astronomical survey]]s, so has numerous [[astronomical naming conventions#Catalogues|valid source designations]]. The most commonly used, TXS&amp;nbsp;0506+056, comes from its inclusion in the Texas Survey of radio sources (standard abbreviation TXS) and its approximate [[equatorial coordinates]] in the [[equinox (celestial coordinates)|B1950 equinox]] used by that survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Details on Acronym: TXS |url=http://cds.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/Dic-Simbad?/15636609 |website=Dictionary of Nomenclature of Celestial Objects |publisher=[[Centre de Données astronomiques de Strasbourg]] |accessdate=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1996AJ....111.1945D|doi=10.1086/117932|title=The Texas Survey of Radio Sources Covering -35.5 degrees &lt; declination &lt; 71.5 degrees at 365 MHz|journal=The Astronomical Journal|volume=111|pages=1945|year=1996|last1=Douglas|first1=James N|last2=Bash|first2=Frank N|last3=Bozyan|first3=F.

==Neutrino emission==
On September 22, 2017, the [[IceCube Neutrino Observatory]] detected a high energy [[muon neutrino]], dubbed '''IceCube-170922A'''.&lt;ref name = "IceCube2018a"/&gt; The neutrino carried an energy of ~290 [[Teraelectronvolt|tera–electronvolts]] (TeV); for comparison, the [[Large Hadron Collider]] can generate a maximum energy of 13&amp;nbsp;TeV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Webb |first1=Jonathan |title=LHC smashes collision energy record |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-32809636 |accessdate=21 July 2018 |work=BBC News |date=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within one minute of the neutrino detection, IceCube sent an automated alert to astronomers around the world with coordinates to search for a possible source.&lt;ref name = "IceCube2018a"/&gt;

A search of this region in the sky, 1.33 degrees across, yielded only one likely source: TXS&amp;nbsp;0506+056, a previously-known blazar, which was found to be in a flaring state of high [[gamma ray]] emission.&lt;ref name = "IceCube2018a"/&gt;&lt;ref name=padovani2018/&gt; It was subsequently observed at other wavelengths of light across the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], including radio, infrared, optical, X-rays and gamma-rays.&lt;ref name = "IceCube2018a"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Finkbeiner|first=Ann|date=2018-04-17|title=Messengers from the Sky|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-new-era-of-multimessenger-astronomy/|journal=Scientific American|language=en|volume=318|issue=5|pages=36–41|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0518-36|pmid=29672499|issn=0036-8733|archive-url=https://www.amon.psu.edu/files/2018/04/ScientificAmerican-0518-36-1gikqgt.pdf|archive-date=2018|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The detection of both neutrinos and light from the same object was an early example of [[multi-messenger astronomy]].&lt;ref name="Castelvecchi2018"/&gt;

A search of archived neutrino data from IceCube found evidence for an earlier flare of lower-energy neutrinos in 2014-2015 (a form of [[precovery]]), which supports identification of the blazar as a source of neutrinos.&lt;ref name=IceCube2018b/&gt; An independent analysis found no gamma-ray flare during this earlier period of neutrino emission, but supported its association with the blazar.&lt;ref name=padovani2018/&gt; The neutrinos emitted by TXS&amp;nbsp;0506+056 are six [[orders of magnitude]] higher in energy than those from any previously-identified [[Neutrino astronomy|astrophysical neutrino]] source.&lt;ref name=padovani2018/&gt;

The observations of high energy neutrinos and gamma-rays from this source imply that it is also a source of [[cosmic rays]], because all three should be produced by the same physical processes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to particle and astroparticle physics (multimessenger astronomy and its particle physics foundations)|first1=Alessandro |last1=De Angelis |first2=Mario |last2=Pimenta |year=2018|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-78181-5|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-78181-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; though no cosmic rays from TXS&amp;nbsp;0506+056 have been directly observed.&lt;ref name="Castelvecchi2018"/&gt; In the blazar, a charged [[pion]] was produced by the interaction of a high-energy proton or nucleus (i.e. a cosmic ray) with the radiation field or with matter.&lt;ref name = "IceCube2018a"/&gt; The pion then decayed into a [[lepton]] and the neutrino. The neutrino interacts only weakly with matter, so it escaped the blazar.&lt;ref name = "IceCube2018a"/&gt; Upon reaching Earth, the neutrino interacted with the Antarctic ice to produce a [[muon]], which was observed by the [[Cherenkov radiation]] it generated as it moved through the IceCube detector.&lt;ref name = "IceCube2018a"/&gt;

'''''Grand traité d’instrumentation et d’orchestration modernes''''', abbreviated in [[English language|English]] as the '''''Treatise on Instrumentation''''' (sometimes '''''Treatise on Orchestration''''') is a technical study of [[Western culture|Western]] [[musical instrument]]s, written by [[Hector Berlioz]]. It was first published in 1844 after being serialised in many parts prior to this date and had a chapter added by Berlioz on [[conducting]] in 1855.

In 1904, [[Richard Strauss]] was asked to update the text to include some modern instruments and included musical examples from Wagner, and in 1905 the updated ''Treatise'' with a new preface by Strauss was published in German.&lt;ref&gt;''Instrumentationslehre'', Hector Berlioz and Richard Strauss, CF Peters, Edition Peters 3120, Leipzig 1905&lt;/ref&gt; The 1905 edition was translated into English in 1948.&lt;ref name="its" /&gt;

The book discusses the various technical aspects of instruments, such as chromatic [[Range (music)|range]], [[Timbre|tone quality]], and limitations. An explanation of the role of particular instruments within the [[orchestra]] is also provided. The book also provides orchestral excerpts from [[classical music|classical]] [[Sheet music|scores]] to give examples of techniques discussed. These examples are sometimes of works by Berlioz himself, while [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], and [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]] are also frequently cited.&lt;ref name="its" /&gt;

Many composers studied the work closely, such as [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]], [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]], [[Richard Strauss|R. Strauss]], and [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]].

The '''United Nations University Institute for Sustainability and Peace''' (UNU-ISP) is an institute of the [[United Nations University|United Nations University (UNU)]], a think tank for the [[United Nations]] system which provides a bridge between the UN and the international academic and policy-making communities. UNU-ISP is based at UNU headquarters in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]], with an Operating Unit located in [[Germany]] (UNU-ISP SCYCLE).

UNU-ISP seeks to achieve and promote a better understanding of three of the most pressing issues on the UN agenda: global change, peace and security, and development. With an innovative approach to sustainability, the work of the institute bridges these cross-cutting themes through research, educational and collaborative initiatives with the aim of solving current problems and anticipating future challenges.

== Overview ==
As an institute of the United Nations University, UNU-ISP is bound by the UNU Charter,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://unu.edu/administration/charter |title=UNU Charter }}&lt;/ref&gt; and guidelines set out by the UNU Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.unu.edu/council/ |title=UNU Council }}&lt;/ref&gt;
UNU-ISP works in collaboration with other UNU institutes and programmes, as well as through collaborative relationships with the global academic and policy-making communities.
Within the context of sustainability and peace, UNU-ISP:
* Conducts research; undertakes education, training and capacity development; and facilitates the dissemination of scientific knowledge and information to the United Nations and its agencies, to scholars and to the public.
* Provides opportunities for postgraduate students and professionals to obtain a wider understanding of relevant issues.
* Integrates the natural sciences, social sciences and humanities into a transdisciplinary approach that contributes to the development and strengthening of policy frameworks and management actions at all levels.
UNU-ISP offers a [[Postgraduate education|postgraduate]] programme, the Master of Science in Sustainability, Development, and Peace. This two-year programme addresses pressing global issues through an innovative interdisciplinary approach that integrates the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities.

== History ==

UNU-ISP became operational on 1 January 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://update.unuhq.info/2009/01/18/unu-launches-new-research-and-educational-institute-in-tokyo/  |title=UNU launches new academic institute in Tokyo : A newsletter of the United Nations University }}&lt;/ref&gt; to give an institutional identity and profile to the integrated academic activities of two former UNU programmes: the Environment and Sustainable Development Programme, and the Peace and Governance Programme. The institute combines the strengths in natural sciences, social sciences and the humanities of these two former programmes, and creates trans-disciplinary synergies that can more effectively address pressing global problems of human survival, development and welfare.

== Research ==
In line with the UNU Charter, the research of UNU-ISP addresses "global problems of human survival, development and welfare that are the concern of the United Nations and its agencies". UNU-ISP applies innovative, holistic approaches to identify sustainable solutions to such problems, cross-fertilizing natural science and social science methodologies through teams working on institute-wide, cross-cutting themes.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}
The institute conducts policy-relevant research into the following three thematic areas, while integrating overarching elements such as ecological security, human rights, gender, and governance:

=== Global Change &amp; Sustainability ===
The global change and sustainability focus of UNU-ISP seeks to clarify our understanding of sustainable development and the interaction among its constituent components – environment, society and economy.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

=== Peace &amp; Security ===
UNU-ISP develops research addressing threats to peace such as violent conflicts, human rights abuses, organized crime, the spread of diseases, the proliferation of weapons and terrorism.

=== International Cooperation &amp; Development ===
UNU-ISP develops research addressing underdevelopment; underrepresentation in decision-making; economic and social inequalities both within and between states; and insufficient access to resources, healthcare, education, science and technology.

== Postgraduate Programmes ==

=== Master of Science (M.Sc.) in Sustainability, Development, and Peace ===
{{Advert|date=June 2011}}
UNU-ISP offers this Master of Science (M.Sc.) degree, intended for recent graduates, professionals and practitioners interested in the unique opportunity of studying at a global university within the framework of the United Nations.

The programme addresses pressing global issues of sustainability, climate change, development, peacebuilding and human rights through an innovative interdisciplinary approach that integrates the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities. It provides students with the knowledge and skills to make important contributions towards solving global issues, whether through employment by UN agencies, other international organizations, governments, civil society, or the private sector.

A practically oriented, user-focused programme of the highest academic quality,{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} it offers opportunities to gain practical experience through internships or field research with a UN agency or other international organization. The programme builds on UNU’s strong record in training and capacity development, and utilizes the extensive network of scholars and academic institutions participating in UNU research.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

== Capacity Development ==

UNU-ISP has a strong commitment to capacity development, with a particular focus on enhancing the capacity of individuals and institutions in developing countries.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

=== UNU International Courses ===
Every year UNU-ISP organizes the regular session of its six-week UNU International Courses (UNU-IC) at UNU headquarters in Tokyo, Japan. The UNU-IC programme is designed for postgraduate students and young professionals (with a college or university degree) in various occupations in Japan and abroad who wish to pursue careers in international fields in public-service or private organizations, including the United Nations, multinational corporations and non-governmental organizations as well as national foreign service organizations. The courses are designed to provide analyses of global issues from both theoretical and empirical perspectives.

=== Global Seminar Series ===
The aim of the UNU Global Seminars is to enhance awareness about contemporary global issues and the role of the United Nations in addressing those issues. Students and young professionals are given the opportunity to interact with distinguished scholars and practitioners from Japan and abroad, and to explore a specific issue in depth through lectures and group discussions. These sessions are open to university students, graduate students and young professionals.

'''''Vägmärken''''' ('''''Markings''''', or more literally '''''Waymarks'''''), published in 1963, is the only book by former [[UN secretary general]], [[Dag Hammarskjöld]]. The journal was discovered after his death, with a covering letter to his literary executor, "a sort of White Book concerning my negotiations with myself - and with God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Dag Hammarskjöld - Biographical | url = https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1961/hammarskjold-bio.html

== Personal significance ==
[[File:Dag-hammarskjold 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dag Hammarskjöld]], author of ''Markings'']]A collection of his diary reflections, the book starts in 1925, when he was 20 years old, and ends at his death in 1961. The typewritten manuscript was found in the bedside table of his New York apartment after Hammarskjöld's death in the Congo.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; As van Dusen writes: "His last night had been spent in the residency of Sture Linner ([[:sv:Sture Linner|sv]]), head of the [[Congo Crisis|United Nations mission to the Congo]]. He left there the copy of the German original of [[Ich und Du]] (I and Thou) presented to him by [[Martin Buber]] and the first dozen pages of his translation into Swedish...Beside the bed was the cherished copy of [[Thomas a Kempis]]' ''[[The Imitation of Christ]]'' which was always on the table of his [[New York City]] apartment next to his bed where the manuscript of ''Markings'' was found."&lt;ref&gt;Henry P Van Dusen. Dag Hammarskjöld. ''A Biographical Interpretation of Markings'' Faber and Faber London 1967 p 169&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the entries in ''Markings'' describe Hammarskjöld's struggles to view his professional duty as a spiritual responsibility. The entry on June 11, 1961, for example, reads: "Summoned/To carry it,/Aloned/To assay it,/Chosen/To suffer it,/And free/To deny it,/I saw/For one moment/The sail/In the sun-storm,/Far off/On a wave-crest,/Alone,/Bearing from land./For one moment/I saw."&lt;ref&gt;Dag Hammarskjöld. ''Markings'' Leif Sjöberg and WH Auden (trans) [[Faber and Faber]] London 1964 p175&lt;/ref&gt;

Hammarskjöld died in a plane crash in [[Zambia]], near midnight, on September 17–18, 1961. The last entry of ''Markings'' is dated 24 August 1961: "Is it a new country/In another world of reality/Than Day's?/Or did I live there/Before Day was?/ I awoke/To an ordinary morning with grey light/Reflected from the street,/But still remembered/The dark-blue night/Above the tree line,/The open moor in moonlight,/The crest in shadow,/Remembered other dreams/Of the same mountain country:/Twice I stood on its summits,/I stayed by its remotest lake,/And followed the river/Towards its source./The seasons have changed/And the light/And the weather/And the hour./But it is the same land./And I begin to know the map/And to get my bearings."&lt;ref&gt;Dag Hammarskjöld. ''Markings'' Leif Sjöberg and WH Auden (trans) Faber and Faber London 1964 p 181&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spiritual significance ==
''Markings'' was described by the late theologian Henry P. Van Dusen as "the noblest self-disclosure of spiritual struggle and triumph, perhaps the greatest testament of personal faith written ... in the heat of professional life and amidst the most exacting responsibilities for [[world peace]] and order."&lt;ref&gt;Henry P Van Dusen. Dag Hammarskjöld. ''A Biographical Interpretation of Markings'' Faber and Faber London 1967 p 5&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that "among the approximately six hundred 'Road Marks' staked down along the "Way' of Dag Hammarskjöld's pilgrimage, almost exactly a hundred are concerned in greater or lesser measure with God."&lt;ref&gt;Henry P Van Dusen. Dag Hammarskjöld. ''A Biographical Interpretation of Markings'' Faber and Faber London 1967 p200&lt;/ref&gt;

Hammarskjöld writes, for example, "We are not permitted to choose the frame of our destiny. But what we put into it is ours. He who wills adventure will experience it—according to the measure of his courage. He who wills sacrifice will be sacrificed—according to the measure of his purity of heart." &lt;ref&gt;Dag Hammarskjöld. ''Markings'' Leif Sjöberg and WH Auden (trans) Faber and Faber London 1964 p 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

The entry of 4 August 1959 reads: "To have humility is to experience reality, not ''in relation to ourselves'', but in its sacred independence. It is to see, judge, and act from the point of rest in ourselves. Then, how much disappears, and all that remains falls into place. In the point of rest at the centre of our being, we encounter a world where all things are at rest in the same way. Then a tree becomes a mystery, a cloud, a revelation, each man a cosmos of whose riches we can only catch glimpses. The life of simplicity is simple, but it opens to us a book in which we never get beyond the first syllable."&lt;ref&gt;Dag Hammarskjöld. ''Markings'' Leif Sjöberg and WH Auden (trans) Faber and Faber London 1964 p 148&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literary significance ==
''Markings'' is characterised by Hammarskjöld's intermingling of prose and [[haiku]] poetry in a manner exemplified by the 17th-century Japanese poet [[Matsuo Bashō|Basho]] in his ''[[Narrow Roads to the Deep North]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Dag Hammarskjöld. ''Markings'' Leif Sjöberg and WH Auden (trans) Faber and Faber London 1964 p149&lt;/ref&gt; Representative examples include:

The Easter-lily's dew-wet calyx.&lt;br /&gt;
Drops pausing&lt;br /&gt;
Between earth and sky.&lt;ref&gt;Dag Hammarskjöld. ''Markings'' Leif Sjöberg and WH Auden (trans) Faber and Faber London 1964 p150&lt;/ref&gt;

They laid the blame on him.&lt;br /&gt;
He didn't know what it was,&lt;br /&gt;
But he confessed it.&lt;ref&gt;Dag Hammarskjöld. ''Markings'' Leif Sjöberg and WH Auden (trans) Faber and Faber London 1964 p 152&lt;/ref&gt;

Trees quiver in the wind,&lt;br /&gt;
Sailing on a sea of mist&lt;br /&gt;
Out of earshot.&lt;ref&gt;Dag Hammarskjöld. ''Markings'' Leif Sjöberg and WH Auden (trans) Faber and Faber London 1964 p 157&lt;/ref&gt;

In his foreword to ''Markings'', the English poet [[W. H. Auden]] states: "''Markings'', however, was not intended to be read simply as a work of literature. It is also an historical document of the first importance as an account—and I cannot myself recall another—of the attempt by a professional man of action to unite in one life the ''Via Activa'' and the ''Via Contemplativa''." &lt;ref&gt;WH Auden Foreword to Dag Hammarskjöld. ''Markings'' Leif Sjöberg and WH Auden (trans) Faber and Faber London 1964 p 23&lt;/ref&gt; Auden quotes Hammarskjöld as stating "In our age, the road to holiness necessarily passes through the world of action."&lt;ref&gt;WH Auden Foreword to Dag Hammarskjöld. ''Markings'' Leif Sjöberg and WH Auden (trans) Faber and Faber London 1964 p 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

This article is about the role played by '''women in the military in the Americas''', particularly in the [[History of women in the United States|United States]] and [[History of women in Canada|Canada]] from the First World War to modern times.

==Brazil==

The first participation of a woman in combat occurred in 1823. Maria Quitéria de Jesus fought for the maintenance of the independence of Brazil, and is considered the first woman to enlist in a military unit.
However, it was not until 1943, during World War II, that women officially entered the Brazilian Army. They included 73 nurses, 67 of them registered nurses and six air transport specialists. They served in four different hospitals in the US Army.  All volunteered for the mission and were the first women to join the active service of the Brazilian armed forces. After the war, as well as the rest of the FEB, the nurses, most have been awarded, they won the official patent and licensed the active military service.

In 1992, the School of Army Administration (Salvador - BA) enrolled the first group of 49 women, by conducting tender. And in 1996, Maria Quitéria de Jesus, the Paladina of Independence, was recognized in the army ranks, as Patron of Table Complementary Brazilian Army officers. The Army established the Military Female Volunteer for Medical, Dental, Pharmaceutical, Veterinary and top-level Nurses (MFDV) in 1996. At that time, they entered the first class of 290 female volunteers to provide military service in healthcare. This merger took place in all twelve military regions of the country. 

In 1997 the Military Institute of Engineering—IME (Rio de Janeiro—RJ) enrolled the first group of 10 women students to be included in Table Military Engineers (QEM). In the same year the School of the Army Health—Essex (Rio de Janeiro RJ) enrolled and graduated the first group of medical officers, dentists, pharmaceutical, veterinary and top-level nurses in the framework of the Army Health.

In 1998, the Army established the Stage Technical Service for higher education professionals than healthcare. At that time, he entered the first class of 519 women lawyers, administrators of businesses, accountants, teachers, computer analysts, engineers, architects, journalists, and other areas of human and exact sciences, serving the needs of Official Temporary Technical (OTT) of Institution. In 2001 the Army Health School allowed the enrollment of women to participate in the public tender for the filling of vacancies in the Health Sergeant Course, which started to operate in 2002.

==Canada==

[[File:CWAC mechanic, 1944.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Private Lowry, [[Canadian Women's Army Corps|CWAC]], tightening up the springs on the front of her vehicle, Chelsea &amp; Cricklewood Garage, England, 7 July 1944.]]

During the First World War, over 2,300 women served overseas in the Canadian Army Medical Corps. Canadian women were also organized into possible uniformed home guard units, undertaking military training in [[paramilitary]] groups. During the Second World War, 5,000 women of the Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps again served overseas, however they were not permitted to serve on combat warships or in combat teams. The Canadian Army Women's Corps was created during the Second World War, as was the Royal Canadian Air Force (Women's Division). As well, 45,000 women served as support staff in every theatre of the conflict, driving heavy equipment, rigging parachutes, and performing clerical work, telephone operation, laundry duties and cooking. Some 5,000 women performed similar occupations during Canada’s part in the [[Korean War]] of 1950–1953.

In 1965 the Canadian government decided to allow a maximum of 1,500 women to serve directly in all three branches of its armed forces, and the former "women's services" were disbanded. In 1970 the government created a set of rules for the armed forces designed to encourage equal opportunities. These included the standardization of enlistment criteria, equal pay and pensions, and allowing women to enroll in all aspects of the Canadian armed forces and making it possible for women to reach any rank. In 1974 the first woman, Major Wendy Clay, earned her pilot's wings in the newly integrated [[Canadian Forces]], and four years later the first woman qualified for the Canadian skydiving demonstration team, the Skyhawks.

Between 1979 and 1985 the role of women expanded further, with military colleges allowing women to enroll. 1981 saw the first female navigator and helicopter pilot, and in 1982 laws were passed ending all discrimination in employment, and combat related roles in the Canadian armed forces were opened for women, with no restrictions in place, with the exception of the submarine service. In 1986 further laws were created to the same effect. The following years saw Canada’s first female infantry soldier, first female gunner, and a female [[Brigadier-General]].

In 1990 the Ministers Advisory Board on Women in the Canadian Forces was created, and in 1994 Wendy Clay was promoted to [[Major-General]]. In 2000 Major [[Micky Colton]] became the first female to log 5,000 flying hours in a [[C-130 Hercules]]. Women were permitted to serve on board Canadian submarines in 2002 with the acquisition of the [[Upholder/Victoria-class submarine|''Victoria''-class submarine]]. Master Seaman Colleen Beattie became the first female submariner in 2003.

Canadian women have also become clearance divers, and commanded large infantry units and Canadian warships.

On May 17, 2006 [[Captain (Canadian army and air force)|Captain]] [[Nichola Goddard]] became the first Canadian woman killed in combat during operations in [[Afghanistan]].

==United States==
[[File:080930-110605 - SGT Lisa Morales awaits turn.jpg|thumb|Two female U.S. Army soldiers in September 2008.]]
One of the first American woman soldiers was [[Deborah Sampson]] of [[Massachusetts]]. She enlisted as a [[Continental Army]] soldier under the name of "Robert Shurtliff". She served for three years in the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] and was wounded twice; she cut a musket ball out of her own thigh so no doctor would find out she was a woman. Finally, at the end of the hostilities her secret was discovered—even so, [[George Washington]] gave her an [[honorable discharge]]. She later lectured on her experiences and became a champion of [[women's rights]]. Another female soldier in the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] was  [[Anna Maria Lane]] of [[Virginia]], who enlisted with her husband in 1776 and fought in several battles, including the [[Battle of Germantown]]. &lt;ref&gt;T [https://books.google.com/books?id=drE50WEN1WUC&amp;q=Anna+Maria+Lane#v=snippet&amp;q=Anna%20Maria%20Lane&amp;f=false endrich, Lisa Frank, An Encyclopedia of American Women at War: From the Home Front to the Battlefields, Volume 1 ABC-CLIO, 2013, p 350-51]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Treadway, Sandra Gioia. “Anna Maria Lane: An Uncommon Soldier of the American Revolution.” Virginia Cavalcade 37, no. 3 (1988): 134–143.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[American Civil War]], about 250 women have been found to have enlisted, counting both sides, and specialists believe that the total is higher.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.mtsu.edu/tps/Women_and_the_Civil_War.pdf Women and the Civil War], Middle Tennessee State U and Library of Congress.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DeAnne Blanton. [https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/1993/spring/women-in-the-civil-war-1.html Women Soldiers of the Civil War]. ''Prologue Magazine'' 25:1, Spring 1993&lt;/ref&gt; It was not generally a crime to for a woman to enlist, but it was considered improper and women only signed up claiming to be men.  For example, [[Sarah Rosetta Wakeman]] enlisted under the alias of Private Lyons Wakeman. She served in the 153rd Regiment, New York State Volunteers. Her complete letters describing her experiences as a female soldier in the Union Army are reproduced in the book, ''An Uncommon Soldier: The Civil War Letters of Sarah Rosetta Wakeman, alias Pvt. Lyons Wakeman, 153rd Regiment, New York State Volunteers, 1862–1864''.&lt;ref&gt;Wakeman, Sarah Rosetta, and Lauren M. Cook. 1994. An uncommon soldier the Civil War letters of Sarah Rosetta Wakeman, alias Private Lyons Wakeman, 153rd Regiment, New York State Volunteers. Pasadena, Md: The Minerva Center.&lt;/ref&gt;

A letter written by Annie Oakley to President [[William McKinley]] on April 5, 1898 may represent the earliest documentary proof of a political move towards recognizing a woman's right to serve in the United States military. [[Annie Oakley]], sharpshooter and star in the [[Buffalo Bill]] Show, wrote a letter to President William McKinley on April 5, 1898 "offering the government the services of a company of 50 'lady sharpshooters' who would provide their own arms and ammunition should war break out with Spain."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/research/recover/example-02.html Letter to President William McKinley from Annie Oakley]. The [[National Archives and Records Administration]] (NARA). Retrieved January 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Oakley's offer was not accepted for the [[Spanish–American War]].

In World War I, the first American women enlisted into the regular armed forces were 13,000 women admitted into active duty in the Navy and Marines and a much smaller number admitted into the Coast Guard. The Yeoman (F) recruits and women Marines primarily served in clerical positions. They received the same benefits and responsibilities as men, including identical pay (US$28.75 per month), and were treated as veterans after the war. These women were quickly demobilized when hostilities ceased, and aside from the Nurse Corps the soldiery became once again exclusively male.

[[Women's Army Corps|The Woman's Army Auxiliary Corps]] was established in the United States in 1942. However, political pressures stalled attempts to create more roles for women in the American Armed Forces. Women saw combat during [[World War II]], first as nurses in the [[Pearl Harbor]] attacks on December 7, 1941. The [[WAVES|Woman's Naval Reserve]] and [[United States Marine Corps Women's Reserve|Marine Corps Women’s Reserve]] were also created during this conflict. In July 1943 a bill was signed removing 'auxiliary' from the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps, making it an official part of the regular army. In 1944 WACs arrived in the Pacific and landed in Normandy on [[D-Day]]. During the war, 67 Army nurses and 16 [[United States Navy Nurse Corps|Navy nurses]] were captured and spent three years as Japanese prisoners of war. There were 350,000 American women who served during World War Two and 16 were killed in action; in total, they gained over 1,500 medals, citations and commendations.

[[Virginia Hall]], serving with the Office of Strategic Services, received the second-highest US combat award, the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]], for action behind enemy lines in France. Hall, who had one artificial leg, landed clandestinely in occupied territory aboard a British [[Motor Torpedo Boat]].

After World War Two, demobilization led to the vast majority of serving women being returned to civilian life. Law 625, [[Women's Armed Services Integration Act|The Women's Armed Services Act]] of 1948, was signed by [[Harry S. Truman|President Truman]], allowing women to serve in the armed forces in fully integrated units during peace time, with only the WAC remaining a separate female unit. During the [[Korean War]] of 1950–1953 many women served in the [[Mobile Army Surgical Hospital]]s, with women serving in Korea numbering 120,000 during the conflict.
[[File:A1C Gonzalez, 377th SFS - Kirtland AFB.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Airman 1st Class, Ashley Gonzalez of the United States Air force.]]
Records regarding American women serving in the [[Vietnam War]] are vague. However, it is recorded that 600 women served in the country as part of the Air Force, along with 500 members of the WAC, and over 6,000 medical personnel and support staff.

The [[Ordnance Corps (United States Army)|Ordnance Corps]] began accepting female missile technicians in 1974,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redstone.army.mil/history/women_chron/chron1970s.html |title=The Women of Redstone Arsenal |publisher=United States Army |accessdate=2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and female crewmembers and officers were accepted into [[Field Artillery Branch (United States)|Field Artillery]] missile units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Busse |first=Charlane |date=July 1978 |title=First women join Pershing training |journal=[[Field Artillery (magazine)|Field Artillery Journal]] |publisher=[[United States Army Field Artillery School]] |page=40 |url=http://sill-www.army.mil/famag/1978/JUL_AUG_1978/JUL_AUG_1978_PAGES_40_43.pdf |accessdate=2009-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=November 1978 |title=The Journal interviews: 1LT Elizabeth A.

In 1974, the first six women aviators earned their wings as [[United States Navy|Navy]] pilots: [[Jane Skiles O'Dea]], [[Barbara Allen Rainey]], [[Rosemary Bryant Mariner]], [[Judith Neuffer|Judith Ann Neuffer]], Ana Marie Fuqua, and Joellen Drag Oslund. The Congressionally mandated prohibition on women in combat places limitations on the pilots' advancement,&lt;ref&gt;https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&amp;dat=19840823&amp;id=kdgTAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=iwYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6981,4703933|Ocala Star-Banner August 23, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; but at least two retired as captains.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.history.navy.mil/nan/backissues/1990s/1997/mj97/ppp.pdf|Naval Aviation News, May–June 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

America’s involvement in [[Grenada]] in 1983 saw over 200 women serving; however, none of these took part in direct combat. Some women, such as Lt Col [[Eileen Collins]] or Lt Celeste Hayes, flew transport aircraft carrying wounded or assault teams, however they were not deemed to have been in direct combat. Several hundred women took part in operations in [[Panama]] in 1989, in non-combat roles.

On December 20, 1989, Capt Linda L. Bray, 29, became the first woman to command American soldiers in battle, during the [[United States invasion of Panama|invasion of Panama]]. She was assigned to lead a force of 30 men and women MPs to capture a kennel holding guard dogs that was defended by elements of the Panamanian Defense force. From a command center about a half-mile from the kennel she ordered her troops to fire warning shots. The Panamanians returned fire until threatened by artillery attack, fleeing into nearby woods. Bray advanced to the kennel to try to stop them, using the cover of a ditch to reach the building. No enemy dead were found, but a cache of weapons was recovered.

The 1991 [[Gulf War]] brought greater media attention to the role of women in the American armed forces. A senior woman pilot at the time, Colonel Kelly Hamilton, commented that "[t]he conflict was an awakening for the people in the US. They suddenly realised there were a lot of women in the military." Over 40,000 women served in almost every role the armed forces had to offer. They were not permitted to participate in deliberate ground engagements. Many came under fire, however, and there are many reports of women engaging enemy forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://userpages.aug.com/captbarb/femvetsds.html Operations Desert Shield/Desert Storm: Women Were There!]&lt;/ref&gt; One example is that of the USS Mount HOOD, AE-29, Pacific Fleet ammunitions carrier in Battle Group Bravo. The Mt. Hood's sister ship, which was all male, was grounded after hitting a mine. The Mt. Hood, regardless of having at least 32 women on board, the first women to board that class of vessel in the USN, filled in. The women aboard the USS Mt. Hood, AE-29, may be the enlisted Navy's very first CONGRESSIONALLY RECOGNIZED females ordered to combat in a Congressionally declared war. That is not to say that they were the first females in combat because, as above illustrates, women have fought the front lines, whether they were afforded official Congressional recognition for their service or not. At any rate, this small ship tackled her duties and from the women leaders aboard came the first African-American female Admiral in the history of the United States Navy, Admiral and second in command of the United States Navy as Vice Chief of Naval Operations: Admiral Michelle Howard.&lt;ref&gt;MM3 Dorothy D. Meindok, Esq./ USS Mount Hood AE-29 sailor&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[File:C-130 - First all female crew.jpg|right|thumb|From 2005, the first all female [[C-130 Hercules]] crew to serve a combat mission for the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Johnson |first=Michael G. |date=2005-09-27 |url=http://www.defendamerica.mil/articles/sep2005/a092705wm3.html |title=First All-female Crew Flies Combat Mission |work=DefendAmerica.mil |publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]] |accessdate=2006-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Today, women can serve on American combat ships, including in command roles, and on submarines.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/29/us-navy-submarines-women US navy lifts ban on women submariners (''The Guardian'' (UK), 29 April 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; They are not permitted to participate in special forces programs such as [[Navy SEALs]]. Women enlisted soldiers are barred from serving in Infantry, Special Forces, however female enlisted members and officers can hold staff positions in every branch of the Army except infantry and armor. Women can however serve on the staffs of infantry and armor units at Division level and above, and be members of Special Operations Forces. Women can fly military aircraft and make up 2% of all pilots in the U.S. military. Although Army regulations ban women from infantry assignments, some females are detailed to accompany male infantry units to handle searches of Iraqi women.

[[File:JessicaLynch02.jpeg|left|thumb|[[Jessica Lynch]] after being rescued in 2003]]
The case ''[[United States v. Virginia]]'', in which the Supreme Court ordered that the Virginia Military Institute allow women to register as cadets, gave women soldiers a weapon against laws which (quoting J. Ruth Bader Ginsburg) “[deny] to women, simply because they are women, full citizenship stature—equal opportunity to aspire, achieve, participate in and contribute to society.”

During [[Battle of Nasiriyah]] in 2003, American soldiers [[Shoshana Johnson]], the first African-American and first Hispanic female prisoner of war, and [[Jessica Lynch]] were captured while serving in Iraq. In the same action, [[Lori Piestewa]], a U.S. soldier, died after driving her Humvee through enemy fire in an attempt to escape an ambush, earning a Purple Heart. She had just rescued Jessica Lynch, whose vehicle had crashed.

Also in 2003, Major [[Kim Campbell (pilot)|Kim Campbell]] was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] for landing her combat damaged [[A-10 Thunderbolt II]] with no hydraulic control and only one functional engine after being struck by hostile fire over [[Baghdad]].

In a recent scandal, U.S Army Reservists [[Lynndie England]] and [[Sabrina Harman]] were convicted by [[court martial]] of [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|cruelty and maltreatment of prisoners]] at [[Abu Ghraib prison]].

[[File:Leigh Ann Hester medal.jpg|thumb|upright|SGT [[Leigh Ann Hester]], awarded the [[Silver Star]] for direct combat]]
SGT Leigh Ann Hester became the first woman to receive the Silver Star, the third-highest US decoration for valor, for direct participation in combat. Female medical personnel had been awarded the same medal, but not for actual combat. She was a team leader of [[Raven 42]], a [[Military Police]] squad that broke up an ambush roughly three to four times its strength. Specialist Ashley Pullen received the [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]]. The squad leader, SSG Timothy Nein, had originally received the Silver Star, but his award was later upgraded to the Distinguished Service Cross. SGT Jason Mike, the unit's medic, also received the Silver Star.

He immigrated to [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate for Palestine]] in 1945.&lt;ref name="Blum1987"&gt;{{cite book|author=Yehuda Zvi Blum|title=For Zion's sake|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tlCHQ6LU988C&amp;pg=PA252|accessdate=24 December 2010|date=30 November 1987|publisher=Associated University Presse|isbn=978-0-8453-4809-3|pages=252–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blum earned his law degree from the [[University of London]].

==Law career==
Blum joined the faculty of [[Hebrew University]] in 1965 and until retiring in 2001 occupied the [[Hersch Lauterpacht]] Chair in [[International Law]] there.  He has served as a senior research scholar at the [[University of Michigan]], and visiting professor in the law schools of the [[University of Texas]], [[New York University]], [[Tulane University]], the [[USC Gould School of Law]], and others. In 1968 he served as a [[UNESCO]] Fellow at the [[University of Sydney]] in [[Australia]]. He has written several books and published many scholarly articles on international legal problems in law journals in English, Hebrew and German.

As the Ambassador to the United Nations, Blum was often critical of it, saying that the UN "fans the flames of the Middle East conflict."  ''The New York Times'' quoted him as saying that "The essence of the [[Arab-Israeli conflict|Middle East conflict]] has always been and remains the persistent enmity of [[Arab states]] towards the Jewish national renaissance."&lt;ref name="NYT-Fans"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/04/world/israeli-says-un-fans-the-flames-of-middle-east-conflict.html |title=Israeli says UN fans the flames of Middle East conflict |accessdate=2010-12-24 |publisher=New York Times |author=Richard Bernstein |date=October 1983}} "For decades now, Arab leaders have obstinately maintained that the whole region from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the [[Persian Gulf]] must be exclusively Arab, he said."&lt;/ref&gt;
As UN envoy, he made headlines for "scolding" a group of 133 American Jewish law students protesting Israel's invasion of [[Lebanon]]  and protesting [[Israeli settlement|Jewish settlements]] in [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]].  He questioned the factual, as well as the moral position, of the students' view, saying that they "have not given the slightest indication of their willingness to bear any personal consequences of their patronizing and fortuitous advice."  &lt;ref name="NYT-students"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/10/world/israeli-envoy-at-un-scolds-133-us-jewish-law-students.html |title=Israeli envoy at UN Scolds 133 Jewish Law Students |accessdate=2010-12-24 |publisher=New York Times |date=May 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Yeungdae Shinmun'' (campus vernacular newspaper) was first published in January 1968, by merging the Daegu and Chunggu College’s newspapers which were first published in June and December, respectively, in the year of 1954. The campus newspaper is currently published weekly during the academic term, and carries university [[news]], [[information]] on new development in learning here and abroad, scholarly [[Article (publishing)|articles]], and [[creative writing]]s by the faculty and students.

''The Yeungnam Observer'' had published a four-page [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] [[English language|English]] monthly since 1969. Then it changed its format from a [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] to a magazine since 1994. It was originally named The Yeungnam [[Chronicle]], however in 1982 the monthly was renamed ''The Yeungnam Observer''. The papers, both in [[Korean language|Korean]] and [[English language|English]], are edited by students under the supervision of faculty members.

* [[University]] Broadcasting System
Like many other large universities, Yeungnam University has its own [[radio]] broadcasting station. University Broadcasting System(UBS) was established in 1965 and has provided music, news and other features on academic affairs, both on and off campus.

===Alumni Association===
The Yeungnam University [[Alumni Association]] was organized in 1969, February 16. At present there are more than 27 branch offices throughout the country, including [[Seoul]], [[Busan]], [[Masan]], [[Changwon]], [[Gyeongsan]], and [[Jeju island]]; and some branches in foreign soil making a list of [[New York City]], [[Chicago]], [[Washington D.C.]], [[Atlanta]] (the USA), [[Vancouver]], [[Toronto]] ([[Canada]]), and [[Indonesia]] and [[England]]. The YUAA can be catalogued even according to the alumni's colleges, majors, and their work places. The YUAA Office Hall was purchased in 1972 at Daemyung-Dong, [[Daegu]], which was the first among all college alumni associations in [[Korea]] to be used only for the purpose of alumni services. The YUAA built a New Office Hall on the building site of 462-pyung at Shinchun-Dong, [[Daegu]], in February 1995, of the size of 5-story building including the basement. In September 1996 it became to own an Annex of 4-story building with the basement that made the YUAA Office Hall own the real estate larger than any other alumni association in [[Korea]] might have.
