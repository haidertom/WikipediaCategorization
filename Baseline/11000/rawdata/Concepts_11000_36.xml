      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15336">The '''ARC3 (Administrator-Researcher Campus Climate Collaborative) Survey''' is a campus climate survey developed to assess perpetration and victimization of sexual misconduct on college campuses in the [[United States]]. In addition to measuring rates of sexual assault on campus, the survey also gathers data on those who are engaging in sexual assault.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://news.gsu.edu/2015/08/31/georgia-state-partners-create-climate-survey-to-aid-in-preventing-campus-sexual-assaults/|title = Climate Survey to Aid in Preventing Campus Sexual Assaults|last = Craig|first = Jeremy|date = 31 August 2015|work = Georgia State University News|access-date = 28 September 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed by a group of sexual assault researchers and student affairs professionals in response to the [[White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault]].&lt;ref name="arc3site"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://campusclimate.gsu.edu/|title=Home - ARC3|work=ARC3|accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The survey is free for college campuses to use.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The study has been used to assess both graduate and undergraduate students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.news-medical.net/news/20150825/UO-survey-on-sexual-victimization-issues-highlights-need-to-increase-awareness-of-available-services.aspx|title = UO Survey On Sexual Victimization Issues Highlights Need to Increase Awareness of Available Services|last = |first = |date = 25 August 2015|work = Medical News|access-date = 28 September 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
College sexual assault is common. Estimates of the number of women assaulted on college campuses have shown that some 15 to 20 percent of college women report rape or attempted rape during their college career, and that over 50 percent report experiencing some form of unwanted sexual contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kirkpatrick | first1 = C. | last2 = Kanin | first2 = E.

Students in the United States may apply [[Title IX]] of the Education Amendments of 1972 in order to successfully sue universities for "indifference to known situations of harassment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/title-ix-and-sexual-assault|title = Title IX And Sexual Assault|date = |accessdate = 28 September 2015|website = ACLU|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Title IX is used to support initiatives to prevent sexual assault on college campuses in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.naspa.org/rpi/posts/campus-climate-surveys-and-public-policy|title = Campus Climate Surveys and Public Policy|date = 6 July 2015|accessdate = 28 September 2015|website = NASPA|publisher = |last = Mastrodicasa|first = Jeanna}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of various federal investigations, many universities turned to surveys and apps that were often expensive, spending "six figures on a product that promised to address the problem."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/professor-group-fighting-campus-rape_55e5120de4b0aec9f35459d9|title = A Supergroup Of Academics Is Trying To Stop People Who Profit From Campus Rape|last = Kingkade|first = Tyler|date = 1 September 2015|work = Huffington Post|access-date = 28 September 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===White House Initiative "It's On Us"===

With the increase of attention on college sexual misconduct, the White House presented on September 19, 2014 the launch of the "It's On Us" Campaign. President [[Barack Obama]] and Vice President [[Joe Biden]] introduced the campaign by describing the importance of ending sexual assault on college campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/09/19/president-obama-launches-its-us-campaign-end-sexual-assault-campus|title=President Obama Launches the "It's On Us" Campaign to End Sexual Assault on Campus|work=whitehouse.gov|accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "It's On Us" Campaign is leading a pledge to "not be a bystander to the problem [of sexual assault], but to be a part of the solution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itsonus.org/|title=Its On Us|work=Its On Us|accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign emphasizes the idea that everyone is responsible for taking a stand in ending sexual violence.

The ARC3 Survey was developed in response to the White House initiative in hopes to better evaluate data about sexual misconduct on college campuses.

The ARC3 survey was also created in order to ensure that there was no profit motive behind the campus surveys, many of which have been very expensive for colleges to purchase and implement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.bustle.com/articles/109133-jennifer-freyd-and-the-administrator-researcher-campus-climate-consortium-are-helping-schools-reduce-rape-for-free|title = Jennifer Freyd and The Administrator Researcher Campus Climate Consortium Are Helping Schools Reduce Rape For Free, Because Nobody Should Have To Pay For Prevention|last = Weiss|first = Suzannah|date = 8 September 2015|work = Bustle|access-date = 28 September 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jennifer Freyd]], a researcher at the [[University of Oregon]], has been instrumental in spear-heading the ARC3 survey initiative.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Collaborators==

This survey is the result of ongoing efforts by student and legal affairs professionals, campus advocates, students, campus law enforcement, and sexual assault and harassment researchers, groups of whom met in Atlanta, Georgia in October 2014 for the Georgia State University Forum on Campus Sexual Assault and in February 2015 in Madison, Wisconsin for the Madison Summit on Campus Climate and Sexual Misconduct. The collaborators who collectively designed the survey and their titles and institutions are listed below:&lt;ref&gt;http://dynamic.uoregon.edu/scientists/ARC3info.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Guiding principles==

According to the ARC3 Survey website hosted by [[Georgia State University]] the ARC3 Survey was created with the following principles in mind:&lt;ref name="arc3site"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; 
*'''Inclusiveness, mutual respect, and collaboration'''
** Where the voices of researchers, college and university administrators, and students will all be heard.
*'''Engaging in an iterative and transparent drafting process'''
**The authors invite and encourage peer review and revision of the survey.
**Administrators should give support, feedback and consultation to researchers so that the survey will be as useful and relevant as possible.
**Scientists in turn should consider the feedback in developing a survey that meets institutional needs.
*'''Ensuring independence and integrity in research'''
**Guided by the ethics of science and recognizing and taking steps to remove the influence of bias.
**A commitment to use of the best scientific evidence as the foundation of the survey.
**There is a scientific knowledge base and a transparent scientific process must guide this work if the research is to have integrity and accuracy.
**Peer reviewed studies are the basis for determining survey content.
*'''Equal focus on surveying victimization and perpetration'''
**Meaningful prevention rests on identifying the reasons sexual misconduct is perpetrated and the environments that foster it. Data that are focused on both victimization and perpetration creates a scientific foundation for administrative work.
*'''The adoption of a civil rights approach grounded in Title IX'''
**Our work focuses on the range of acts that constitute student on student incidents an institution must respond to and process under guidelines of Title IX, the Violence Against Women Act, the Clery Law and other applicable local, state, and federal law and guidelines.
*'''Framing our efforts with the principles of The Belmont Report'''
**Respect for persons: Ensure that students are informed and participate voluntarily.
**Beneficence: Participation in a campus climate survey is an educational opportunity and an intervention.
*'''Justice'''
**As stated in the Belmont report, address “Who ought to receive the benefits of research and bear its burdens?”
*'''A sensitivity to the unique issues faced by various diverse populations and higher education institutional types'''
**Addressing the intersectionality of identities and the multiple contextual factors affecting risk.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Survey components==

The ARC3 Survey takes approximately 30 minutes to complete and has a module-based structure which makes it flexible to campus needs and legislative mandates moving forward, while maintaining validity of measurement.&lt;ref name="arc3site"/&gt; The following is a list of module topics obtained from the ARC3 Website:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11205">'''Adiaphoron''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|d|ɪ|ˈ|æ|f|ə|r|ɒ|n}}, {{IPAc-en|æ|d|i|ˈ|æ|f|ə|r|ɒ|n}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=adiaphoron | encyclopedia=Oxford Dictionaries | url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/adiaphoron | access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Adiaphoron | encyclopedia=Merriam-Webster.com | url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/adiaphoron | access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; plural: '''adiaphora''' from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ἀδιάφορα, the negation of διάφορα - Latin [[differentia]] - meaning "not differentiable").

In [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynicism]] "adiaphora" represents indifference to the vicissitudes of life.

In [[Pyrrhonism]], "adiaphora" indicates things which cannot be logically differentiated. Unlike in Stoicism, the term has no specific connection to morality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pyrrho/|title=Pyrrho|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Stoicism]] "adiaphora" indicates actions that [[morality]] neither mandates nor forbids. In the context of Stoicism "adiaphora" is usually translated as "indifferents."

In [[Christianity]], "adiaphora" are matters not regarded as essential to [[Faith in Christianity|faith]], but nevertheless as permissible for Christians or allowed in church. What is specifically considered adiaphora depends on the specific [[Christian theology|theology]] in view.

==Cynicism==
The Cynics cultivate adiaphora, by which they meant indifference to the vicissitudes of life, through ascetic practices which help one become free from influences – such as wealth, fame, and power – that have no value in Nature. Examples include Diogenes' practice of living in a tub and walking barefoot in winter.

==Pyrrhonism==
{{See also|Non-essentialism}}
[[Pyrrho]] claimed that all ''pragmata'' (matters, affairs, questions, topics) are ''adiaphora'' (not differentiable, not clearly definable, negating Aristotle's use of "diaphora"), ''astathmēta'' (unstable, unbalanced, unmeasurable), and ''anepikrita'' (unjudgeable, undecidable). Therefore, neither our senses nor our beliefs and theories are able to identify truth or falsehood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pyrrho/#AriPas|title=Pyrrho|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stoicism==
The Stoics distinguish all the objects of human pursuit into three classes: good, bad, and adiaphora (indifferent). [[Virtue]], [[wisdom]], [[justice]], [[Temperance movement|temperance]], and the like, are denominated [[good and evil|good; their opposites were bad]]. Besides these there are many other objects of pursuit such as [[wealth]], [[celebrity|fame]], etc. of themselves neither good nor bad. These are thought therefore in ethics to occupy neutral territory, and are denominated "adiaphora". This distinction amounts practically to an exclusion of the adiaphora from the field of morals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The New American Cyclopaedia | year = 1859 | page = 124}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity==

===Lutheranism===
{{see also|Law and Gospel|Antinomianism#Lutheranism}}
The issue of what constituted ''adiaphora'' became a major dispute during the [[Protestant Reformation]]. In 1548, two years after the death of [[Martin Luther]], the [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Charles V]] tried to unite Catholics and Protestants in his realm with a law called the [[Augsburg Interim]]. This law was rejected by [[Philipp Melanchthon]], on the account that it did not ensure [[justification by faith]] as a fundamental doctrine.  Later he was persuaded to accept a compromise known as the [[Leipzig Interim]], deciding that doctrinal differences not related to justification by faith were ''adiaphora'' or matters of indifference. Melanchthon's compromise was vehemently opposed by [[Matthias Flacius]] and his followers in Magdeburg, who went to the opposite extreme by claiming that adiaphora cease to be adiaphora in a case of scandal and confession. By 1576 both extremes were rejected by the majority of [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]] led by [[Martin Chemnitz]] and the formulators of the Formula of Concord.

In 1577, the [[Formula of Concord]] was crafted to settle the question of the nature of genuine ''adiaphora'', which it defined as church rites that are "...neither commanded nor forbidden in the Word of God."&lt;ref name="cycl_Luth"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Adiaphora  | publisher = Concordia Publishing House | work = Christian Cyclopedia | date = 2000 | accessdate = 2018-05-09 | url = http://cyclopedia.lcms.org/display.asp?t1=a&amp;word=ADIAPHORA |editor-first1=Erwin L.|editor-last1=Lueker|editor-first2=Luther|editor-last2=Poellot|editor-first3=Paul|editor-last3=Jackson }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Concord added believers should not yield even in matters of ''adiaphora'' when these are being forced upon them by the "enemies of God's Word".&lt;ref name="book_TheS"&gt;{{Cite web | work = The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord | title = X. Church Rites, Commonly Called Adiaphora | accessdate = 2018-05-09 | url = http://bookofconcord.org/sd-adiaphora.php?setSidebar=min }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lutheran [[Augsburg Confession]] states that the true unity of the Church it is enough to agree concerning the doctrine of the Gospel and the administration of the Sacraments. Nor is it necessary that human traditions, that is, rites or ceremonies, instituted by men, should be everywhere alike.

===Puritanism===
{{Original research|date=September 2007}}

The [[Westminster Confession of Faith]], a confession of faith written by the [[Puritan]]s, which after the [[English Civil War]] was rejected by the [[Anglicans]], distinguishes between elements or acts of [[worship]] (worship proper) and the circumstances of worship. The elements of worship must be limited to what has positive warrant in Scripture, a doctrine known as the [[regulative principle of worship]]. In this framework, the elements of worship have included praise (the words and manner of music), prayer, preaching and teaching from the Bible, the taking of vows, and the two sacraments of baptism and the Lord's Supper, while the circumstances of worship have included the building and its necessary furniture and the time of day for worship.

The circumstances of worship are considered adiaphora, although they must be done for edification and to promote peace and order (compare {{bibleverse|1|Cor.|14:26–33}}; {{bibleverse ||Rom.|14:19}}).  According to the Westminster Confession 20.2,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://reformed.org/documents/wcf_with_proofs/ch_XX.html | publisher = Reformed | title = Westminster Confession of Faith with proofs | chapter = XX}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the conscience is left free in general belief and behavior within the realm of whatever is not "contrary to the Word." However, specifically concerning worship and religious faith, the conscience is free from whatever is "besides" Scripture; that is, it is free to worship and believe only according to whatever has positive warrant in Scripture.

[[Presbyterian]]s who have subscribed to the Westminster Confession, for instance, sometimes considered the questions of [[musical instruments]] and of the singing of [[hymn]]s (as opposed to [[exclusive psalmody]]) not drawn directly from the Bible as related to the elements of worship, not optional circumstances, and for this reason they rejected musical instruments and hymns because they believed they were neither commanded by scripture nor deduced by good and necessary consequence from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Schwertley | first = Brian | url = http://reformedonline.com/view/reformedonline/sola.htm | title = Sola Scripture and the Regulative Principles of Worship | journal = Reformed online}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Schwertley | first = Brian | url = http://reformedonline.com/view/reformedonline/music.htm | title = Musical Instruments in the Public Worship of God | journal = Reformed online}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Schwertley | first = Brian | url = http://reformedonline.com/view/reformedonline/psalm.htm | title = Exclusive Psalmody: A Biblical Defense | journal = Reformed online}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Adherence to such a position is rare among modern Presbyterians, however.

The Puritan position on worship is thus in line with the common saying regarding adiaphora: "[[In necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas|In necessary things, unity; in doubtful things, liberty; in all things, charity]]".

===Latitudinarianism in Anglicanism===
[[Latitudinarianism]] was initially a pejorative term applied to a group of 17th-century English theologians who believed in conforming to official [[Church of England]] practices but who felt that matters of [[doctrine]], [[liturgical]] practice, and [[ecclesiastical]] organization were of relatively little importance. Good examples of the latitudinarian philosophy were found among the [[Cambridge Platonists]]. The latitudinarian Anglicans of the seventeenth century built on [[Richard Hooker (theologian)|Richard Hooker]]'s position, in ''[[Of the Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity]]'', that God cares about the moral state of the individual soul and that such things as church leadership are "things indifferent". However, they took the position far beyond Hooker's own and extended it to doctrinal matters.

The '''adversarial system''' or '''adversary system''' is a legal system used in the [[common law]] countries where two advocates represent their parties' case or position before an impartial person or group of people, usually a [[jury]] or [[judge]], who attempt to determine the truth and pass judgment accordingly.&lt;ref name="Hale"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hale|first=Sandra Beatriz|title= The Discourse of Court Interpreting: Discourse Practices of the Law, the Witness and the Interpreter |publisher=John Benjamins|date=July 2004|page=31|isbn=978-1-58811-517-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HVwg_sQ5a5UC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=%22adversarial+system%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Richards"&gt;{{cite book|last=Richards|first=Edward P. |author2=Katharine C.

The adversarial system is the two-sided structure under which [[Criminal procedure|criminal trial]] courts operate that puts the prosecution against the defense.

==History==
Some writers trace the process to the medieval mode of [[trial by combat]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.proquest.com/ |title=Maintaining the adversarial system: The practice of allowing jurors to question witnesses during trial |author=Kirsten DeBarba |year=2002 |work= |page=55 no. 5 (October 1): 1521–1548 |publisher=Vanderbilt Law Review |accessdate=August 15, 2007 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070815103709/http://www.proquest.com/| archivedate= 15 August 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anne Strick, ''Injustice for All'' (New York: [[G. P. Putnam's Sons]], 1977): 21.&lt;/ref&gt; in which some litigants, notably women, were allowed a champion to represent them. The use of the [[jury]] in the common law system seems to have fostered the adversarial system and provides the opportunity for both sides to argue their point of view.

==Basic features==
As an accused is not compelled to give evidence in a [[crime|criminal]] adversarial proceeding, they may not be questioned by a prosecutor or judge unless they choose to do so. However, should they decide to testify, they are subject to [[cross-examination]] and could be found guilty of [[perjury]]. As the election to maintain an accused person's [[right to silence]] prevents any examination or cross-examination of that person's position, it follows that the decision of counsel as to what evidence will be called is a crucial tactic in any case in the adversarial system and hence it might be said that it is a lawyer's manipulation of the truth. Certainly, it requires the skills of counsel on both sides to be fairly equally pitted and subjected to an impartial judge.

By contrast, while [[defendant]]s in most civil law systems can be compelled to give a statement, this statement is not subject to cross-examination by the prosecutor and not given under oath. This allows the defendant to explain his side of the case without being subject to cross-examination by a skilled opposition. However, this is mainly because it is not the prosecutor but the judges who question the defendant. The concept of "cross"-examination is entirely due to adversarial structure of the common law.

Judges in an adversarial system are impartial in ensuring the fair play of [[due process]], or [[fundamental justice]]. Such judges decide, often when called upon by counsel rather than of their own motion, what [[evidence (law)|evidence]] is to be admitted when there is a dispute; though in some common law jurisdictions judges play more of a role in deciding what evidence to admit into the record or reject. At worst, abusing [[judicial discretion]] would actually pave the way to a biased decision, rendering obsolete the judicial process in question&amp;mdash;[[rule of law]] being illicitly subordinated by [[rule of man]] under such discriminating circumstances.

The [[rules of evidence]] are also developed based upon the system of objections of adversaries and on what basis it may tend to prejudice the [[trier of fact]] which may be the judge or the jury. In a way the rules of evidence can function to give a judge limited inquisitorial powers as the judge may exclude evidence he/she believes is not trustworthy or irrelevant to the legal issue at hand.

All evidence must be relevant and not [[hearsay]] evidence.

Peter Murphy in his ''Practical Guide to Evidence'' recounts an instructive example. A frustrated judge in an English (adversarial) court finally asked a barrister after witnesses had produced conflicting accounts, 'Am I never to hear the truth?' 'No, my lord, merely the evidence', replied counsel.

The name "adversarial system" may be misleading in that it implies it is only within this type of system in which there are opposing prosecution and defense. This is not the case, and both modern adversarial and inquisitorial systems have the powers of the state separated between a prosecutor and the judge and allow the defendant the right to counsel. Indeed, the [[European Convention on Human Rights|European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms]] in Article 6 requires these features in the legal systems of its signatory states.

The [[right to counsel]] in criminal trials was initially not accepted in some adversarial systems. It was believed that the facts should speak for themselves, and that lawyers would just blur the matters. As a consequence, it was only in 1836 that England gave suspects of felonies the formal right to have legal counsel (the [[Prisoners' Counsel Act 1836]]), although in practice English courts routinely allowed defendants to be represented by counsel from the mid-18th century. During the second half of the 18th century advocates like [[William Garrow|Sir William Garrow]] and [[Thomas Erskine, 1st Baron Erskine]] helped usher in the adversarial court system used in most common law countries today. In the United States, however, personally retained counsel have had a right to appear in all federal criminal cases since the adoption of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] and in state cases at least since the end of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], although nearly all provided this right in their state constitutions or laws much earlier. Appointment of counsel for indigent defendants was nearly universal in federal felony cases, though it varied considerably in state cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt6frag7_user.html#amdt6_hd36 |title=CRS/LII Annotated Constitution Sixth Amendment |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 1963 that the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] declared that legal counsel must be provided at the expense of the state for indigent felony defendants, under the federal Sixth Amendment, in state courts. See ''[[Gideon v. Wainwright]]'', {{ussc|372|335|1963}}.

One of the most significant differences between the adversarial system and the inquisitorial system occurs when a criminal defendant admits to the crime. In an adversarial system, there is no more controversy and the case proceeds to sentencing; though in many jurisdictions the defendant must have [[allocution]] of her or his crime; an obviously false confession will not be accepted even in common law courts. By contrast, in an inquisitorial system, the fact that the defendant has confessed is merely one more fact that is entered into evidence, and a confession by the defendant does not remove the requirement that the prosecution present a full case. This allows for [[plea bargain]]ing in adversarial systems in a way that is difficult or impossible in inquisitional system, and many felony cases in the United States are handled without trial through such plea bargains.

In some adversarial legislative systems, the court is permitted to make [[inference]]s on an accused's failure to face [[cross-examination]] or to answer a particular question. This obviously limits the usefulness of silence as a tactic by the defense. In England the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 allowed such inferences to be made for the first time in England and Wales (it was already possible in Scotland under the [[rule of criminative circumstances]]). This change was disparaged by critics as an end to the 'right to silence', though in fact an accused still has the right to remain silent and cannot be compelled to take the stand. The criticism reflects the idea that if the accused can be inferred to be guilty by exercising their right to silence, it no longer confers the protection intended by such a right. In the United States, the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] has been interpreted to prohibit a jury from drawing a negative inference based on the defendant's invocation of his right not to testify, and the jury must be so instructed if the defendant requests.

Lord Devlin in ''The Judge'' said: "It can also be argued that two prejudiced searchers starting from opposite ends of the field will between them be less likely to miss anything than the impartial searcher starting at the middle."&lt;ref&gt;P Devlin, ''The Judge'' (Oxford University Press, 1970) 60-1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparisons with the inquisitorial approach==
There are many differences in the way cases are reviewed. It is questionable that the results would be different if cases were conducted under the differing approaches; in fact no statistics exist that can show whether or not these systems would come to the same results. However, these approaches are often a matter of national pride and there are opinions amongst jurists about the merits of the differing approaches and their drawbacks as well.

Proponents of the adversarial system often argue that the system is more fair and less prone to abuse than the inquisitional approach, because it allows less room for the state to be biased against the defendant. It also allows most private litigants to settle their disputes in an amicable manner through discovery and pre-trial settlements in which non-contested facts are agreed upon and not dealt with during the trial process.

In addition, adversarial procedure defenders argue that the inquisitorial court systems are overly institutionalized and removed from the average citizen. The common law trial lawyer has ample opportunity to uncover the truth in the courtroom. Most cases that go to trial are carefully prepared through a discovery process that aids in the review of evidence and testimony before it is presented to judge or jury. The lawyers involved have a very good idea of the scope of agreement and disagreement of the issues to present at trial which develops much in the same way as the role of investigative judges.

Proponents of inquisitorial justice dispute these points. They point out that many cases in adversarial systems, and most cases in the United States, are actually resolved by [[plea bargain]] or [[Settlement (litigation)|settlement]]. Plea bargain as a system does not exist in an inquisitorial system. Many legal cases in adversarial systems, and most in the United States, do not go to trial, which may lead to injustice when the defendant has an unskilled or overworked attorney, which is likely to be the case when the defendant is poor. In addition, proponents of inquisitorial systems argue that the plea bargain system causes the participants in the system to act in perverse ways, in that it encourages prosecutors to bring charges far in excess of what is warranted and defendants to plead guilty even when they believe that they are not.

'''Anthony Giddens, Baron Giddens''' (born 18 January 1938) is a British [[sociology|sociologist]] who is known for his [[theory of structuration]] and his [[holism|holistic]] view of modern societies. He is considered to be one of the most prominent modern sociologists, the author of at least 34 books, published in at least 29 languages, issuing on average more than one book every year. In 2007, Giddens was listed as the fifth most-referenced author of books in the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;Gill, J. (2009) [http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=405925&amp;encCode=184949851BC54459875JTBS737226611 Giddens trumps Marx but French thinkers triumph], ''Times Higher Education'', 26 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Times Higher Education [http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=405956 Most cited authors of books in the humanities, 2007], ''Times Higher Education'', 26 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Four notable stages can be identified in his academic life. The first one involved outlining a new vision of what sociology is, presenting a theoretical and methodological understanding of that field, based on a critical reinterpretation of the classics. His major publications of that era include ''Capitalism and Modern Social Theory'' (1971) and ''The Class Structure of the Advanced Societies'' (1973). In the second stage Giddens developed the [[theory of structuration]], an analysis of [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] and [[social structure|structure]], in which primacy is granted to neither. His works of that period, such as ''New Rules of Sociological Method'' (1976), ''Central Problems in Social Theory'' (1979) and ''The Constitution of Society'' (1984), brought him international fame on the sociological arena. The third stage of Giddens's academic work was concerned with [[modernity]], [[globalisation]] and politics, especially the impact of modernity on social and personal life. This stage is reflected by his critique of [[postmodernity]], and discussions of a new "[[utopia]]n-realist"&lt;ref name="Halpin"&gt;[[David Halpin]], ''Hope and Education: The Role of the Utopian Imagination'', Routledge, 2003, {{ISBN|0-415-23368-2}}, [https://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;vid=ISBN0415233682&amp;id=a5LV72_y5UcC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;dq=Giddens+utopia&amp;sig=2wrCrkanl_s1OzdWvtHJKzL9ddo Google Print p.63]&lt;/ref&gt; [[third way (centrism)|third way]] in politics, visible in the ''Consequences of Modernity'' (1990), ''Modernity and Self-Identity'' (1991), ''The Transformation of Intimacy'' (1992), ''Beyond Left and Right'' (1994) and ''The Third Way: The Renewal of Social Democracy'' (1998). Giddens' ambition was both to recast social theory and to re-examine our understanding of the development and trajectory of modernity.

In the most recent stage, Giddens has turned his attention to a more concrete range of problems relevant to the evolution of world society – environmental issues, focussing especially upon debates about climate change, analysed in successive editions of his book, ''The Politics of Climate Change'' (2009); the role and nature of the European Union in ''Turbulent and Mighty Continent: What Future for Europe?'' (2014); and, in a series of lectures and speeches, the nature and consequences of the digital revolution. 

Giddens served as [[London School of Economics#Director|Director]] of the [[London School of Economics]] 1997–2003, where he is now Emeritus Professor at the Department of Sociology. He is a Life Fellow of [[King’s College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unisa.edu.au/Media-Centre/Releases/2016-Media-releases/UniSA-honours-influential-social-theorist-Professor-Lord-Anthony-Giddens/#.Vw-njXodZ1g|title=UniSA honours influential social theorist Professor Lord Anthony Giddens |work=unisa.edu.au|accessdate=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Giddens was born and raised in [[Edmonton, London]], and grew up in a lower-middle-class family, son of a clerk with [[London Passenger Transport Board|London Transport]]; he attended [[Minchenden School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title =The Lecturer: Anthony Giddens | work =The Reith Lectures | publisher =BBC | year =1999 | url =http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/reith1999/lecturer.shtml | accessdate =24 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first member of his family to go to university. Giddens received his undergraduate academic degree (in joint sociology and psychology) at the [[University of Hull]] in 1959, followed by a master's degree at the [[London School of Economics]]. He later gained a PhD at [[King's College, Cambridge]]. In 1961, he started working at the [[University of Leicester]] where he taught [[social psychology]]. At Leicester — considered to be one of the seedbeds of British sociology — he met [[Norbert Elias]] and began to work on his own theoretical position. In 1969, he was appointed to a position at the [[University of Cambridge]], where he later helped create the Social and Political Sciences Committee (SPS — now [[Faculty of Human, Social, and Political Science, University of Cambridge|HSPS]]).

Giddens worked for many years at Cambridge as a fellow of [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College]] and was eventually promoted to a full professorship in 1987. He is cofounder of [[Polity (publisher)|Polity Press]] (1985). From 1997 to 2003, he was director of the [[London School of Economics]] and a member of the Advisory Council of the [[Institute for Public Policy Research]]. He was also an adviser to [[Tony Blair]]; it was Giddens' "[[third way (centrism)|third way]]" political approach that has been Tony Blair's guiding political idea. He has been a vocal participant in British political debates, supporting the centre-left [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] with media appearances and articles (many of which are published in the ''[[New Statesman]]''). He was given a [[life peerage]] in June 2004, as '''Baron Giddens''', of [[Southgate, London|Southgate]] in the [[London Borough of Enfield]]&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=57334 |date=22 June 2004 |page=7753}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sits in the [[House of Lords]] for [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]. He is a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] and the [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amacad.org/multimedia/pdfs/publications/bookofmembers/ChapterG.pdf|title=Members of the American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences: 1780–20 |work=amacad.org|accessdate=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ln.edu.hk/f/upload/20057/Prof%20Giddens_Eng.pdf|title=Citation of Professor Anthony Giddens by Professor Wei Xiangdong |work=ln.edu.hk|accessdate=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giddens also holds over 15 honorary degrees from various universities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/sociology/whoswho/academic/Giddens.aspx|title=Professor Lord Tony Giddens |work=lse.ac.uk|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; including recently honorary degrees from [[Jagiellonian University]] (2014), the [[University of South Australia]] (2016), [[Goldsmiths, University of London]] (2016) and [[Lingnan University (Hong Kong)]] (2017).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scienceinpoland.pap.pl/en/news/news,405102,prof-anthony-giddens-received-honorary-doctorate-from-the-jagiellonian-university.html|title=Prof. Anthony Giddens received honorary doctorate from the Jagiellonian University |work=Science and Scholarship in Poland|accessdate=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unisa.edu.au/Media-Centre/Releases/2016-Media-releases/UniSA-honours-influential-social-theorist-Professor-Lord-Anthony-Giddens/#.Vw-njXodZ1g|title=UniSA honours influential social theorist Professor Lord Anthony Giddens |work=unisa.edu.au|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gold.ac.uk/honorands/lord-anthony-giddens/|title=Lord Anthony Giddens |work=gold.ac.uk|accessdate=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.www.ln.edu.hk/lingnan-touch/71/lingnan-university-confers-honorary-doctorates-upon-four-distinguished-individuals|title=Lingnan University confers honorary doctorates upon four distinguished individuals |work=ln.edu.hk|accessdate=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Giddens, the author of over 34 books and 200 articles, essays and reviews, has contributed and written about most notable developments in the area of social sciences, with the exception of [[research design]] and methods. He has written commentaries on most leading schools and figures and has used most [[sociological paradigm]]s in both [[microsociology|micro]] and [[macrosociology]]. His writings range from abstract, metatheoretical problems to very direct and 'down-to-earth' textbooks for students. His textbook, ''Sociology'', first published in 1988, is currently in its eighth edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.polity.co.uk/book.asp?ref=9780745696683|title=Book - Anthony Giddens, Philip W. Sutton - Sociology, 8th Edition|work=polity.co.uk|accessdate=19 September 2016}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, he is also known for his interdisciplinary approach: he has commented not only on the developments in sociology, but also in [[anthropology]], [[archaeology]], [[psychology]], philosophy, history, [[linguistics]], [[economics]], social work and most recently, [[political science]]. In view of his knowledge and works, one may view much of his life's work as a form of 'grand [[wikt:Synthesis|synthesis]]' of sociological theory.

===The nature of sociology===
Before 1976, most of Giddens' writings offered critical commentary on a wide range of writers, schools and traditions. Giddens took a stance against the then-dominant [[structural functionalism]] (represented by [[Talcott Parsons]]), as well as criticising [[evolutionism]] and [[historical materialism]]. In ''Capitalism and Modern Social Theory'' (1971), he examined the work of Weber, [[Émile Durkheim|Durkheim]] and [[Karl Marx|Marx]], arguing that despite their different approaches each was concerned with the link between [[capitalism]] and [[Social relation|social life]]. Giddens emphasised the [[social constructs]] of [[power (sociology)|power]], modernity and institutions, defining sociology as: {{cquote|"the study of social institutions brought into being by the industrial transformation of the past two or three centuries."}}

In ''New Rules of Sociological Method'' (1976) (the title of which alludes to Durkheim's ''Rules of the Sociological Method'' of 1895), Giddens attempted to explain 'how sociology should be done' and addressed a long-standing divide between those theorists who prioritise '[[macrosociology|macro level]]' studies of social life — looking at the 'big picture' of society — and those who emphasise the '[[microsociology|micro level]]' — what everyday life means to individuals. In ''New Rules...'' he noted that the functionalist approach, invented by Durkheim, treated society as a reality unto itself, not reducible to individuals. He rejected Durkheim's [[sociological positivism]] [[paradigm]], which attempted to predict how societies operate, ignoring the meanings as understood by individuals.&lt;ref name="Gauntlett online"&gt;[http://www.theory.org.uk/giddens.htm Resources at Theory.org.uk], site by [[David Gauntlett]], last accessed on 19 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Giddens noted:
{{cquote|"Society only has form, and that form only has effects on people, insofar as structure is produced and reproduced in what people do".&lt;ref name="Gauntlett"/&gt;}}

He contrasted Durkheim with Weber's approach — [[interpretative sociology]] — focused on understanding [[Human agency|agency]] and motives of individuals. Giddens is closer to Weber than Durkheim, but in his analysis he rejects both of those approaches, stating that while society is not a [[collective reality]], nor should the individual be treated as the central unit of analysis.&lt;ref name="Gauntlett online"/&gt;

Rather he uses the logic of [[hermeneutic]] tradition (from interpretative sociology) to argue for the importance of agency in sociological theory, claiming that human social actors are always to some degree knowledgeable about what they are doing. Social order is therefore a result of some pre-planned social actions, not automatic evolutionary response. Sociologists, unlike [[natural science|natural scientists]], have to interpret a social world which is already interpreted by the actors that inhabit it. According to Giddens there is a "[[Duality of structure]]" by which social practice, which is the principal unit of investigation, has both a structural and an agency-component.  The structural environment constrains individual behaviour, but also makes it possible. He also noted the existence of a specific form of a [[social cycle]]: once sociological concepts are formed, they filter back into everyday world and change the way people think. Because social actors are reflexive and monitor the ongoing flow of activities and structural conditions, they adapt their actions to their evolving understandings. As a result, social scientific knowledge of society will actually change human activities. Giddens calls this two-tiered, interpretive and dialectical relationship between social scientific knowledge and human practices the "[[double hermeneutic]]".

Giddens also stressed the importance of power, which is means to ends, and hence is directly involved in the actions of every person. Power, the transformative capacity of people to change the social and material world, is closely shaped by knowledge and [[space-time]].&lt;ref name="The Nation-State and Violence"&gt;Anthony Giddens, The Nation-State and Violence, University of California Press, 1987, {{ISBN|0-520-06039-3}}, p.7 [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0520060393&amp;id=wJu1Z4cTdsIC&amp;num=10&amp;pg=PA7&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;dq=power+%22transformative+capacity%22+inauthor:Giddens&amp;sig=Ue-G1rz7s5AZkc18Sabrs0Q8VLA Google Print]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Sociology is not about a 'pre-given' universe of objects, the universe is being constituted — or produced by — the active doings of subjects.
* The production and reproduction of society thus has to be treated as a skilled performance on the part of its members.
* The realm of human agency is bounded. Individuals produce society, but they do so as historically located actors, and not under conditions of their own choosing.
* Structures must be conceptualised not only as constraints upon human agency, but also as enablers.
* Processes of structuration involve an interplay of meanings, norms and power.
* The sociological observer cannot make social life available as 'phenomenon' for observation independently of drawing upon his knowledge of it as a resource whereby he constitutes it as a 'topic for investigation'.
* Immersion in a form of life is the necessary and only means whereby an observer is able to generate such characterisations.
* Sociological concepts thus obey a double hermeneutic.
* In sum, the primary tasks of sociological analysis are the following: (1) The hermeneutic explication and mediation of divergent forms of life within descriptive [[metalanguage]]s of social science; (2) Explication of the production and reproduction of society as the accomplished outcome of human agency.

===Structuration===
{{details|Theory of structuration}}

Giddens' [[theory of structuration]] explores the question of whether it is individuals or social forces that shape our social reality. He eschews extreme positions, arguing that although people are not entirely free to choose their own actions, and their knowledge is limited, they nonetheless are the agency which reproduces the social structure and leads to social change. His ideas find an echo in the philosophy of the modernist poet [[Wallace Stevens]] who suggests that we live in the tension between the shapes we take as the world acts upon us, and the ideas of order that our imagination imposes upon the world. Giddens writes that the connection between structure and action is a fundamental element of social theory, [[structure and agency]] are a duality that cannot be conceived of apart from one another and his main argument is contained in his expression "[[duality of structure]]". At a basic level, this means that people make society, but are at the same time constrained by it. Action and structure cannot be analysed separately, as structures are created, maintained and changed through actions, while actions are given meaningful form only through the background of the structure: the line of causality runs in both directions making it impossible to determine what is changing what. In Giddens own words (from ''New rules...'') :

{{Cquote|"social structures are both constituted by human agency, and yet at the same time are the very medium of this constitution."&lt;ref name="Blackwell"/&gt;}}

In this regard he defines structures as consisting of rules and resources involving human action: the rules constrain the actions, the resources make it possible. He also differentiates between systems and structures. Systems display structural properties but are not structures themselves. He notes in his article ''Functionalism: après la lutte'' (1976) that:

{{cquote|"To examine the structuration of a [[social system]] is to examine the modes whereby that system, through the application of generative rules and resources is produced and reproduced in [[social interaction]]."&lt;ref name="Blackwell"/&gt;}}

This process of structures (re)producing systems is called structuration. Systems here mean to Giddens "the situated activities of human agents"&lt;ref name="Blackwell"&gt;{{citation | last1 = Bryant | first1 = Christopher G.

Structures are then "...sets of rules and resources that individual actors draw upon in the practices that reproduce social systems’"&lt;ref&gt;[[John D. Bone]], ''The Social Map &amp; The Problem of Order: A Re-evaluation of ’Homo Sociologicus’'', Theory &amp; Science (2005), ISSN 1527-5558, [http://theoryandscience.icaap.org/content/vol6.1/bone.html online]&lt;/ref&gt; (''Politics, Sociology and Social Theory'') and "systems of generative rules and sets, implicated in the articulation of social systems"&lt;ref name="Blackwell"/&gt; (''The Constitution of Society.''), existing virtually "out of time and out of space"&lt;ref name="Blackwell"/&gt; (''New rules....''). Structuration therefore means that relations that took shape in the structure, can exist "out of time and place": in other words, independent of the context in which they are created. An example is the relationship between a teacher and a student: when they come across each other in another context, say on the street, the hierarchy between them is still preserved.

Structure can act as a constraint on action, but it also enables action by providing common frames of meaning. Consider the example of language: structure of language is represented by the rules of [[syntax]] that rule out certain combinations of words.&lt;ref name="Gauntlett online"/&gt; But the structure also provides rules that allow new actions to occur, enabling us to create new, meaningful [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentences]].&lt;ref name="Gauntlett online"/&gt; Structures should not be conceived as "simply placing constrains upon human agency, but as enabling."&lt;ref name="Mestrovic"/&gt; (''New rules....'') Giddens suggests that structures (traditions, institutions, moral codes, and other sets of expectations — established ways of doing things) are generally quite stable, but can be changed, especially through the [[unintended consequence]]s of action, when people start to ignore them, replace them, or reproduce them differently.

Thus, actors (agents) employ the social rules appropriate to their culture, ones that they have learned through socialisation and experience. These rules together with the resources at their disposal are used in social interactions. Rules and resources employed in this manner are not [[deterministic]], but are applied reflexively by knowledgeable actors, albeit that actors’ awareness may be limited to the specifics of their activities at any given time. Thus, the outcome of action is not totally predictable.

===Connections between micro and macro===
Structuration is very useful in synthesising [[microsociology|micro]] and [[macrosociology|macro]] issues. On a micro scale, one of individuals' internal sense of self and [[Identity (social science)|identity]], consider the example of a [[family]]: we are increasingly free to choose our own mates and how to relate with them, which creates new opportunities but also more work, as the relationship becomes a reflexive project that has to be interpreted and maintained. Yet this micro-level change cannot be explained only by looking at the individual level as people did not spontaneously change their minds about how to live; neither can we assume they were directed to do so by social institutions and the state.

On a macro scale, one of the [[Sovereign state|state]] and social organisations like [[multinational corporation|multinational]] capitalist corporations, consider the example of globalization, which offers vast new opportunities for investment and development, but crises — like the [[Asian financial crisis]] — can affect the entire world, spreading far outside the local setting in which they first developed, and last but not least directly influences individuals. A serious explanation of such issues must lie somewhere within the network of macro and micro forces. These levels should not be treated as unconnected; in fact they have significant relation to one another.&lt;ref name="Gauntlett online"/&gt;

To illustrate this relationship, Giddens discusses changing attitudes towards marriage in developed countries.&lt;ref name="Giddens, Anthony 1999"&gt;Giddens, Anthony (1999), ''Runaway World: How Globalization is Reshaping Our Lives.'' London: Profile.&lt;/ref&gt; He claims that any effort to explain this phenomenon solely in terms of micro or macro level causes will result in a [[circular cause and consequence]]. Social relationships and visible sexuality (micro-level change) are related to the decline of religion and the rise of [[rationality]] (macro-level change), but also with changes in the laws relating to marriage and sexuality (macro), change caused by different practices and changing attitudes on the level of everyday lives (micro). Practices and attitudes in turn can be affected by social movements (for example, [[women's liberation]] and [[egalitarianism]]), a macro-scale phenomena; but the movements usually grow out of everyday life grievances — a micro-scale phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Gauntlett online"/&gt;

All of this is increasingly tied in with mass media, one of our main providers of information. The media do not merely reflect the social world but also actively shape it, being central to modern reflexivity.&lt;ref name="Gauntlett online"/&gt; [[David Gauntlett]] writes in ''Media, Gender and Identity'' that:
{{Cquote|"The importance of the media in propagating many modern lifestyles should be obvious. [...] The range of [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]]s — or lifestyle ideals — offered by the media may be limited, but at the same time it is usually broader than those we would expect to just 'bump into' in everyday life. So the media in modernity offers possibilities and celebrates diversity, but also offers narrow interpretations of certain roles or lifestyles — depending where you look."&lt;ref name="Gauntlett online"/&gt;}}

Another example explored by Giddens is the emergence of romantic love, which Giddens (''The Transformation of Intimacy'') links with the rise of the 'narrative of the self' type of self-identity: "Romantic love introduced the idea of a narrative into an individual's life."&lt;ref name="Shumway"&gt;[[David R. Shumway]], ''Modern Love: Romance, Intimacy, and the Marriage Crisis'', NYU Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0-8147-9831-4}}, [https://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;vid=ISBN0814798314&amp;id=KdVa73vN1BgC&amp;dq=Romantic+love+introduced+the+idea+of+a+narrative+into+an+individual%27s+life Google Print]&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[history of sex]] clearly demonstrates that passion and sex are not modern phenomena, the discourse of romantic love is said to have developed from the late 18th century. [[Romanticism]], the 18th and 19th century European macro-level cultural movement is responsible for the emergence of the novel — a relatively early form of mass media. The growing literacy and popularity of novels fed back into the mainstream lifestyle and the romance novel proliferated the stories of ideal romantic life narratives on a micro-level, giving the romantic love an important and recognized role in the marriage-type relationship.

Consider also the transformation of intimacy. Giddens asserts that intimate social relationships have become '[[democratization|democratised]]', so that the bond between partners – even within a marriage – has little to do with external laws, regulations or social expectations, but is based on the internal understanding between two people – a [[Trust (sociology)|trusting]] bond based on emotional communication. Where such a bond ceases to exist, modern society is generally happy for the relationship to be dissolved. Thus we have 'a democracy of the emotions in everyday life' (''Runaway World'', 1999).&lt;ref name="Gauntlett"&gt;[[David Gauntlett]], [http://www.theoryhead.com/gender/ ''Media Gender and Identity''], Routledge, 2002. {{ISBN|0-415-18960-8}}. About Giddens' work on modernity and self-identity. [https://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;vid=ISBN0415189594&amp;id=Vhc60-bJGQsC&amp;dq=Society+only+has+form,+and+that+form+only+has+effects+on+people,+in+so+far+as+structure+is+produced+and+reproduced+in+what+people+do Google Print]&lt;/ref&gt;

A democracy of the emotions – the democratising of everyday life – is of course an ideal, more or less approximated to in the diverse contexts of everyday life. There are many societies, cultures and contexts in which it remains far from reality - where sexual oppression is an everyday phenomenon. In ''The Transformation of Intimacy'' Giddens introduces the notion of ‘plastic [[sexuality]]’ – sexuality freed from an intrinsic connection with reproduction, and hence open to innovation and experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, Anthony (1992). ''The Transformation of Intimacy''. Polity Press. {{ISBN|0745612393}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author =Hawkes, Gail | title =Plastic Sexuality | publisher =Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology | url =http://www.sociologyencyclopedia.com/subscriber/tocnode.html?id=g9781405124331_chunk_g978140512433122_ss1-23 | accessdate =4 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; What was once open only to elites becomes generalised with the advent of mass contraception: sexuality and identity become far more fluid than in the past. These changes are part and parcel of wider transformations affecting the self and self-identity. 

Inevitably, Giddens concludes that all [[social change]] stems from a mixture of micro- and macro-level forces.

===Self-identity===
Giddens says that in the post-traditional order, self-identity is reflexive. It is not a quality of a moment, but an account of a person's life. Giddens writes that
{{cquote|"A person's identity is not to be found in behaviour, nor — important though this is — in the reactions of others, but in the capacity to keep a particular narrative going. The individual's biography, if she is to maintain regular interaction with others in the day-to-day world, cannot be wholly fictive. It must continually integrate events which occur in the external world, and sort them into the ongoing 'story' about the self."&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, Anthony (1991). ''Modernity and self-identity. Self and society in the late modern age''. Polity Press, p. 54, {{ISBN|9780745609324}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

More than ever before we have access to information that allows us to reflect on the causes and consequences of our actions. At the same time we are faced with dangers related to unintended consequences of our actions and by our reliance on the knowledge of experts. We create, maintain and revise a set of biographical narratives, social roles and [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyles]] – the story of who we are, and how we came to be where we are now. We are increasingly free to choose what we want to do and who we want to be (although Giddens contends that wealth gives access to more options). But increased choice can be both liberating and troubling. Liberating in the sense of increasing the likelihood of one's self-fulfilment, and troubling in form of increased emotional stress and time needed to analyse the available choices and minimise risk of which we are increasingly aware (what Giddens sums up as "manufacturing uncertainty"). While in earlier, traditional societies we would be provided with that narrative and social role, in the post-traditional society we are usually forced to create one ourselves. As Giddens puts it:
{{Cquote|"What to do? How to act? Who to be? These are focal questions for everyone living in circumstances of late modernity — and ones which, on some level or another, all of us answer, either discursively or through day-to-day social behaviour."&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, Anthony (1991). ''Modernity and self-identity. Self and society in the late modern age''. Polity Press, p. 70, {{ISBN|9780745609324}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Modernity===
Giddens' recent work has been concerned with the question of what is characteristic about social institutions in various points of history. Giddens agrees that there are very specific changes that mark our current era, but argues that it is not a "post-modern era", but just a "radicalised modernity era"&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, A. (2013). The consequences of modernity. John Wiley &amp; Sons. {{ISBN|9780804718912}}&lt;/ref&gt; (similar to [[Zygmunt Bauman]]'s concept of [[liquid modernity]]), produced by the extension of the same social forces that shaped the previous age. Giddens nonetheless differentiates between pre-modern, modern and late (high) modern societies and doesn't dispute that important changes have occurred but takes a neutral stance towards those changes, saying that it offers both unprecedented opportunities and unparalleled dangers. He also stresses that we haven't really gone beyond modernity. It's just a developed, [[detraditionalise]]d, radicalised, 'late' modernity. Thus the phenomena that some have called 'postmodern' are to Giddens nothing more than the most extreme instances of a developed modernity.&lt;ref name="Gauntlett online"/&gt; Along with [[Ulrich Beck]] and [[Scott Lash]], he endorses the term [[reflexive modernization|reflexive modernisation]] as a more accurate description of the processes associated with the second modernity, since it opposes itself (in its earlier version) instead of opposing traditionalism, endangering the very institutions it created (such as the national state, the political parties or the nuclear family).

Giddens concentrates on a contrast between traditional (pre-modern) culture and post-traditional (modern) culture. In traditional societies, individual actions need not be extensively thought about, because available choices are already determined (by the customs, traditions, etc.).&lt;ref name="Gauntlett online"/&gt; In contrast, in post-traditional society people (actors, agents) are much less concerned with the precedents set by earlier generations, and they have more choices, due to flexibility of law and [[public opinion]].&lt;ref name="Gauntlett online"/&gt; This however means that individual actions now require more analysis and thought before they are taken. Society is more [[Reflexivity (social theory)|reflexive]] and aware, something Giddens is fascinated with, illustrating it with examples ranging from state governance to intimate relationships.&lt;ref name="Gauntlett online"/&gt; Giddens examines three realms in particular: the experience of identity, connections of intimacy and political institutions.&lt;ref name="Gauntlett online"/&gt;

The most defining property of modernity, according to Giddens, is that we are disembedded from time and space. In pre-modern societies, space was the area in which one moved, time was the experience one had while moving. In modern societies, however, the social space is no longer confined by the boundaries set by the space in which one moves. One can now imagine what other spaces look like, even if he has never been there. In this regard, Giddens talks about virtual space and virtual time. Another distinctive property of modernity lies in the field of knowledge.

In pre-modern societies, it was the elders who possessed the knowledge: they were definable in time and space. In modern societies we must rely on expert systems&lt;!-- this should not be linked; the 'expert systems' article has a different meaning than Giddens and others --&gt;. These are not present in time and space, but we must trust them. Even if we trust them, we know that something could go wrong: there's always a risk we have to take. Also the technologies which we use, and which transform constraints into means, hold risks. Consequently, there is always a heightened sense of uncertainty in contemporary societies. It is also in this regard that Giddens uses the image of a 'juggernaut': modernity is said to be like an unsteerable juggernaut travelling through space.

Humanity tries to steer it, but as long as the modern institutions, with all their uncertainty, endure, we will never be able to influence its course. The uncertainty can however be managed, by 'reembedding' the expert-systems into the structures which we are accustomed to.

Another characteristic is enhanced reflexivity, both at the level of individuals and at the level of institutions. The latter requires an explanation: in modern institutions there is always a component which studies the institutions themselves for the purpose of enhancing its effectiveness. This enhanced reflexivity was enabled as language became increasingly abstract with the transition from pre-modern to modern societies, becoming institutionalised into universities. It is also in this regard that Giddens talks about "double hermeneutica": every action has two interpretations. One is from the actor himself, the other of the investigator who tries to give meaning to the action he is observing. The actor who performs the action, however, can get to know the interpretation of the investigator, and therefore change his own interpretation, or his further line of action.

This is the reason that positive science, according to Giddens,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} is never possible in the social sciences: every time an investigator tries to identify causal sequences of action, the actors can change their further line of action. The problem is, however, that conflicting viewpoints in social science result in a disinterest of the people. For example, when scientists don't agree about the greenhouse-effect, people will withdraw from that arena, and deny that there is a problem. Therefore, the more the sciences expand, the more uncertainty there is in the modern society. In this regard, the juggernaut gets even more steerless.

{{Quotation|While emancipatory politics is a politics of life chances, life politics is a politics of lifestyle. Life politics is the politics of a reflexively mobilised order — the system of late modernity — which, on an individual and collective level, has radically altered the existential parameters of social activity. It is a politics of self-actualisation in a reflexively ordered environment, where that reflexivity links self and body to systems of global scope ... Life politics concerns political issues which flow from processes of self-actualisation in post-traditional contexts, where globalising influences intrude deeply into the reflexive project of the self, and conversely where processes of self-realisation influence global strategies.|Anthony Giddens ''Modernity and self-identity. Self and society in the late modern age'' 1991|&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, Anthony (1991). ''Modernity and self-identity. Self and society in the late modern age''. Polity Press, p. 214, {{ISBN|9780745609324}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''A Contemporary Critique of Historical Materialism'', Giddens concludes&lt;ref name="Blackwell"/&gt; that:
# There exists no necessary overall mechanism of social change, no universal motor of history such as class conflict;
# There are no universal stages, or periodisation, of social development, these being ruled out by intersocietal systems and "time-space edges" (the ever-presence of [[exogenous]] variables), as well as by human agency and the inherent "[[Historicity (philosophy)|historicity]]" of societies;
# Societies do not have needs other than those of individuals, so notions such as adaptation cannot properly be applied to them;
# Pre-capitalist societies are class-divided, but only with capitalism are there class societies in which there is [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] class conflict, the separation of the political and economic spheres, property freely alienable as capital, and "free" labour and [[labour market]]s;
# While class conflict is integral to capitalist society, there is no [[teleology]] that guarantees the emergence of the working class as the universal class and no [[ontology]] that justifies denial of the multiple bases of modern society represented by capitalism, [[industrialism]], [[bureaucratisation]], [[surveillance]] and [[industrialisation]] of warfare;
# Sociology, as a subject pre-eminently with modernity, addresses a [[Reflexivity (social theory)|reflexive]] reality.

===The Third Way===
In the age of late and [[reflexive modernity]] and [[post scarcity]] economy, the political science is being transformed. Giddens notes that there is a possibility that "life politics" (the politics of [[self-actualisation]]) may become more visible than "emancipatory politics" (the politics of inequality); that new social movements may lead to more social change than political parties; and that the reflexive project of the self and changes in gender and sexual relations may lead the way, via the "democratisation of democracy", to a new era of [[Jürgen Habermas|Habermasian]] "dialogic democracy" in which differences are settled, and practices ordered, through discourse rather than violence or the commands of authority.&lt;ref name="Blackwell"/&gt;

Giddens, relying on his past familiar themes of reflexivity and system integration, which places people into new relations of trust and dependency with each other and their governments, argues that the political concepts of 'left' and 'right' are now breaking down, as a result of many factors, most centrally the absence of a clear alternative to capitalism and the eclipse of political opportunities based on the social class in favour of those based on lifestyle choices.

Giddens moves away from explaining how things are to the more demanding attempt of advocacy about how they ought to be. In ''Beyond Left and Right'' (1994) Giddens criticises [[market socialism]] and constructs a six-point framework for a reconstituted [[Radicalization|radical politics]]:&lt;ref name="Blackwell"/&gt;
# repair damaged [[Solidarity (sociology)|solidarities]]
# recognise the centrality of life politics
# accept that active trust implies generative politics
# embrace dialogic democracy
# rethink the welfare state
# confront violence

''The Third Way'' (1998) provides the framework within which the 'third way' - which Giddens also terms the '[[Radical center (politics)|radical centre]]'&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, Anthony (1998).  ''The Third Way: The Renewal of Social Democracy''.  Polity Press, pp. 44–46.  {{ISBN|9780745622668}}&lt;/ref&gt; - is justified.  In addition, ''The Third Way'' supplies a broad range of policy proposals aimed at what Giddens calls the 'progressive centre-left' in British politics.  According to Giddens:
{{cquote|"the overall aim of third way politics should be to help citizens pilot their way through the major revolutions of our time: globalisation, transformations in personal life and our relationship to nature".&lt;ref name="Blackwell"/&gt;}}

Giddens remains fairly optimistic about the future of humanity:
{{cquote|"There is no single agent, group or movement that, as [[Karl Marx|Marx]]'s [[proletariat]] was supposed to do, can carry the hopes of humanity, but there are many points of political engagement which offer good cause for optimism".&lt;ref name="Blackwell"/&gt; (''Beyond Left and Right'')}}
Giddens discards the possibility of a single, comprehensive, all-connecting [[ideology]] or political programme. Instead he advocates going after the 'small pictures', ones people can directly affect at their home, workplace or local community. This, to Giddens, is a difference between pointless [[utopianism]] and useful [[utopian realism]],&lt;ref name="Halpin"/&gt; which he defines as envisaging "alternative futures whose very propagation might help them be realised".&lt;ref name="Blackwell"/&gt; (''The Consequences of Modernity''). By 'utopian' he means that this is something new and extraordinary, and by 'realistic' he stresses that this idea is rooted in the existing social processes and can be viewed as their simple extrapolation. Such a future has at its centre a more socialised, [[demilitarization|demilitarised]] and planetary-caring global world order variously articulated within green, women's and peace movements, and within the wider democratic movement.&lt;ref name="Blackwell"/&gt;

The [[Third Way]] was not just a work of abstract theory, but influenced a range of left of centre political parties across the world –  in Europe, the US, Latin America and Australasia.&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, Anthony (2001). ''The Global Third Way Debate''.  Polity Press.  {{ISBN|0745627412}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although close to New Labour in the UK, Giddens dissociated himself from many of the interpretations of the third way made in the sphere of day-to-day politics. For him it was not a succumbing to neoliberalism or the dominance of markets.&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, Anthony (2000). ''The Third Way and its Critics''.  Polity Press. p. 32. {{ISBN|0745624502}}&lt;/ref&gt; The point was to get beyond both free market fundamentalism and traditional top down socialism – to make the values of the centre-left count in a globalising world. He argued that ‘the regulation of financial markets is the single most pressing issue in the world economy’ and that ‘global commitment to free trade depends upon effective regulation rather than dispenses with the need for it’.&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, Anthony (1998). ''The Third Way; A Renewal of Social Democracy''.  Polity Press. pp. 148-149. {{ISBN|0745622666}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Giddens delivered the BBC Reith Lectures on the subject of ‘Runaway World’, subsequently published as a book of that title.&lt;ref name="Giddens, Anthony 1999"/&gt; The aim was to introduce the concept and implications of globalisation to a lay audience. He was the first Reith Lecturer to deliver the lectures in different places around the world;&lt;ref name="The Lectures: Runaway World"&gt;{{Cite web | title =The Lectures: Runaway World | work =The Reith Lectures | publisher =BBC | year =1999 | url =http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/reith1999/ | accessdate =13 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first to respond directly to e-mails that came in while he was speaking. The lectures were delivered in London, Washington, New Delhi and Hong Kong and responded to by local audiences. Giddens received the Asturias Prize for the social sciences in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title =Anthony Giddens; Prince of Asturias Award for Social Sciences 2002 | publisher =Prince of Asturias Foundation | url =http://www.fpa.es/en/prince-of-asturias-awards/awards/2002-anthony-giddens.html?texto=trayectoria&amp;especifica=0 | accessdate =13 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The award has been labelled ‘the Spanish Nobel Prize’, but stretches well beyond the sphere of science.

[[File:Anthony Giddens and Chelsea Clinton, 2001.jpg|thumb|left|Giddens and [[Chelsea Clinton]] at the LSE in 2001]]
On two visits to Libya in 2006 and 2007, organised by the Boston-based consultancy firm [[Monitor Group]], Giddens met with [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]]. Giddens has declined to comment on the financial compensation he received.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/mar/04/lse-libya-anthony-giddens-gaddafi | location=London | work=The Guardian | first1=Rajeev | last1=Syal | first2=Jeevan | last2=Vasagar | title=Anthony Giddens' trip to see Gaddafi vetted by Libyan intelligence chief | date=5 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Guardian reported in March 2011, that Libya's government engaged [[Monitor Group]] as advisor on matters of public relations. [[Monitor Group]] allegedly received 2 million pounds in return for undertaking a "cleansing campaign" to improve Libya's image.  In a letter to [[Abdullah Senussi]], a high-ranking Libyan official in July 2006, Monitor Group reported that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We will create a network map to identify significant figures engaged or interested in Libya today ... We will identify and encourage journalists, academics and contemporary thinkers who will have interest in publishing papers and articles on Libya ... We are delighted that after a number of conversations, Lord Giddens has now accepted our invitation to visit Libya in July.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Giddens' first visit to Libya resulted in articles in the ''[[New Statesman]]'', ''[[El País]]'' and ''[[La Repubblica]]'',&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"/&gt; where he argued that the country had been dramatically transformed. In the ''New Statesman'' he wrote: "Gaddafi's 'conversion' may have been driven partly by the wish to escape sanctions, but I get the strong sense it is authentic and there is a lot of motive power behind it. Saif Gaddafi is a driving force behind the rehabilitation and potential modernisation of Libya. Gaddafi Sr, however, is authorising these processes."&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"/&gt;  During the second visit, Monitor Group organised a panel of "three thinkers" – Giddens, Gaddafi, and [[Benjamin Barber]], author of ''[[Jihad vs. McWorld]]'' – chaired by Sir [[David Frost]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://motherjones.com/politics/2011/03/libya-qaddafi-monitor-group|title=From Libya With Love|work=Mother Jones|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Giddens remarked of his meetings with Gaddafi, "You usually get about half an hour with a political leader," he recalls. "My conversation lasts for more than three. Gaddafi is relaxed and clearly enjoys intellectual conversation. He likes the term 'third way’ because his own political philosophy is a version of this idea. He makes many intelligent and perceptive points. I leave enlivened and encouraged."

==Theory of 'reflexivity'==
Giddens introduces 'reflexivity' and in information societies information gathering is considered as a routinised process for the greater protection of the nation. Information gathering is known as the concept of 'individuation.'  Individuality comes as a result of individuation as people are given more 'informed choices.'  The more information the government has about a person, the more entitlements are given to the citizens.  The process of information gathering helps government to identify 'enemies-of-the-state,' singling out individuals that are suspected of plotting activities against the state.  The advent of technology has brought national security to a completely new level.  Historically, the military relied on armed force to deal with threats.  With the development of ICT, biometric scans, language translation, real time programs and other related intelligent programs have made the identification of terrorist activities much easier compared to the past. The analysing of algorithm patterns in biometric databases have given government new leads.  Data about citizens can be collected through identification and credential verification companies.  Hence, surveillance and ICT goes hand-in-hand with information gathering.  In other words, the collection of information is necessary as 'stringent safeguards' for the protection of the nation, preventing it from imminent attacks.

===Living in a high opportunity, high risk society===

Giddens has vigorously pursued the theme of globalization in recent years. He sees the growing interdependence of world society as driven not only by the increasing integration of the world economy, but above all by massive advances in communications.&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, Anthony (2006). ''Sociology'' (fifth edition). Cambridge: Polity, pp. 583-633. {{ISBN|0393925536}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  As he has noted, when he delivered the BBC Reith Lectures,&lt;ref name="The Lectures: Runaway World"/&gt; just before the turn of the century, the Internet was in its infancy. Now it has expanded in a wholly unprecedented way - linking people and organizations across the world on an everyday level, but also intruding deeply into everyday life. Billions of people have access to it and the numbers are growing every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title =The World in 2013: ICT Fact and Figures | url =http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Documents/facts/ICTFactsFigures2013-e.pdf | accessdate =15 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An increasingly interconnected and wired-up world offers many advantages and benefits. Yet it carries new risks too, some themselves of global proportions. In the 21st century work opportunity and risk combine as never before. Giddens refers to the emergence on a global level of a ‘high opportunity, high risk society’.&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, Anthony (2014). ''Turbulent and Mighty Continent: What Future for Europe?''. Cambridge: Polity, p. 14. {{ISBN|0745680968}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Both on the level of opportunity and risk we are in terrain human beings have never explored before. We don’t know in advance what the balance is likely to be, because many of the opportunities and risks are quite new – we can’t draw on past history to assess them.

[[Climate change]] is one of those new risks. No other civilization before the advent of modern [[industrialism]] was able to intervene into nature to even a fraction of the extent to which we do on an everyday basis.

Climate change was referred to in several of Giddens’s books from the mid-1990s onwards, but was not discussed at length until the publication of his work ''The Politics of Climate Change'' in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, Anthony (2009). ''The Politics of Climate Change''. Cambridge: Polity. {{ISBN|0745646921}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Climate change, Giddens says, constitutes a fundamental threat to the future of industrial civilisation as it spreads across the globe. Given that is the case, he asks, why are countries around the world doing so little to counter its advance? Many reasons are involved, but the prime one is the historical novelty of humanly induced climate change itself. No previous civilisation intervened into nature on a level remotely similar to that which we do on an everyday level today. We have no previous experience of dealing with such an issue and especially one of such global scope, or of the dangers it poses. Those dangers hence appear as abstract, and located at some indefinite point in the future. ‘Giddens’s paradox’ consists of the following theorem. We are likely put off responding adequately to climate change until major catastrophes unequivocally connected to it occur; but by then by definition it will be too late. For we have no way of reversing the build-up of greenhouses gases that is driving the transformation of the world’s climate. Some such gases will be in the atmosphere for centuries.

In his latest work, Giddens has returned to the subject of the [[European Union]], discussed in 2007 in his book ''Europe in the Global Age''&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, Anthony (2007). ''Europe in the Global Age''. Cambridge: Polity. {{ISBN|978-0-7456-4011-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  and in a diversity of articles. In ''Turbulent and Mighty Continent: What Future for Europe?''&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, Anthony (2014). ''Turbulent and Mighty Continent: What Future for Europe?''. Polity Press. {{ISBN|0745680968}}&lt;/ref&gt; he discusses the likely future of the EU in the wake of the world financial crisis. Giddens writes as a committed pro-European, but accepts that fundamental reforms must be made if the EU is to avoid stagnation or worse. The coming of the euro introduced economic federalism among the eurozone countries and therefore to the EU as a whole. Some version of political federalism must follow, even if limited in nature. Reforms must confer qualities absent from much of the EU’s history but now required for its future – flexible and quick-acting leadership, coupled to the greater democratic involvement of citizens. However, he also emphasised that ‘The Union could still founder, even disintegrate, the result of a chain reaction of circumstances that member states were unable to control’.&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, Anthony (2014). ''Turbulent and Mighty Continent: What Future for Europe?''. Polity Press. {{ISBN|0745680968}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2014 ''Turbulent and Mighty Continent'' was awarded the [[European Book Prize]], awarded by a selection jury featuring members from many different countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title =European Book Prize for former Director Lord Anthony Giddens | publisher =[[London School of Economics and Political Science]] | url =http://www.lse.ac.uk/newsAndMedia/aroundLSE/archives/2014/AnthonyGiddensBookAward.aspx | accessdate =4 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, while continuing to pursue some of the core themes of his earlier works, Giddens has become preoccupied with the impact of the [[digital revolution]] (DR) on world society and on everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title =Anthony Giddens opens the Academic Year 2015/16 at the Hertie School  | url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrfDMOxRk7k | accessdate =19 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That revolution, he argues, must not be identified solely with the advent of the internet, extraordinary though that is. Rather the DR is a massive wave of change washing across the world, driven by the interrelation between the internet, robotics and supercomputers. It is huge algorithmic power – available to the billions of people who already possess [[smartphones]] – that connects the other two. 

Giddens sees the pace and global scope of the DR as unprecedented in human history – and we are probably only in its early stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url =https://medium.com/rsa-journal/reality-bytes-b4f7b046edfd#.emg0fu22r | accessdate =19 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many see the DR as primarily producing endless diversity and as acting to dissolve pre-existing institutions and modes of life. Giddens emphasises that from its beginnings it has been bound up with power and large-scale structures too. It is deeply bound up with American global power and has physical form, depending as it does upon global satellite systems and systems, underground cables and concentrations of supercomputers. GPS has its origins in super-power rivalry between the US and what was then the Soviet Union. The digital universe is also funded by mass advertising and expresses the dominance of large corporations in the world economy. 

The DR forms an important part of Giddens’s recent preoccupation with the emergence of the high opportunity, high risk society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title =High opportunity, high risk society! Interview with Anthony Giddens  | publisher =sociology.org | url =http://www.sociology.org/high-opportunit-high-risk-interview-with-anthony-giddens/ | accessdate =19 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the advent of the DR promises fundamental advances in core areas of medicine. New threats and problems abound, both in our everyday lives and in the larger institutions of our societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title =Anthony Giddens opens the Academic Year 2015/16 at the Hertie School  | url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrfDMOxRk7k | accessdate =19 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists can communicate with one-another in a direct way across the world. The overlap of supercomputers and genetics means that genetic structures can be decoded instantaneously, promising huge advances in conquering major diseases. Medical practice is likely to be transformed through remote monitoring and other digital innovations. Yet the overlap of the DR with criminality, violence and war is pervasive and dangerous. Military drones are just one example of the continuing involvement of the DR with war.

Emerging developments in AI (artificial intelligence) look likely to propel these changes into a new phase of social transformation, whose outlines at present remain hazy, but which look certain to be quite profound. Supercomputers are becoming more and more powerful in terms of their capacity to handle immense amounts of data, while quantum computers, with even greater processing capacity, loom on the horizon. At the same time, deep learning – artificial neural networks capable of innovative thinking – is fast advancing. A world-wide debate is going on about how far AI can match, or even surpass, human intellectual capabilities. AI and geopolitics, Giddens says, are converging all over again, 'as the circle of change comes back to its point of origin.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title =A Magna Carta for the digital age | publisher =[[Washington Post]] | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/theworldpost/wp/2018/05/02/artificial-intelligence/| accessdate =27 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia has weaponised fake news as a means of weakening the US and other Western democracies. In the meantime, China is pouring resources into the further development of AI and currently possesses the world’s most advanced supercomputer. 

Giddens was a member of the House of Lords Select Committee on AI which reported in April 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/lords-select/ai-committee/membership/ |title=Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence membership |work=parliament.uk|accessdate=27 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee put forward a variety of suggested reforms, to apply not only in the UK but also potentially much more widely. These should take place within a common ethical framework, to guide intervention on the part of government and of the digital corporations themselves. The power of the digital mega-corporations must be curtailed and subjected to democratic governance, challenging and problematic though such an endeavour is. AI should be developed for the common good. It should follow principles of transparency and fairness and never be allocated the autonomous capability to harm human actors. The major nations and transnational agencies should work towards ensuring that such principles are incorporated into their own codes and practices and applied on a transnational level. The worry, however, is that an 'AI arms race' will develop as countries jostle to take the lead both in AI generally and in its application to weaponry of diverse sorts. In a much-publicised speech given in 2017, Vladimir Putin observed of advances in AI that 'whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title =AI in the UK: ready, willing and able? | publisher =parliament.uk | url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201719/ldselect/ldai/100/100.pdf | accessdate =27 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If there is a jostling for advantage among the major powers, concerns of ethics and safety may fall by the wayside in the scramble for advantage, adding to the stresses and strains already visible in the international order. 

==Honours==
He was given a life peerage in June 2004, as Baron Giddens, of Southgate in the London Borough of Enfield and sits in the House of Lords for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].

{{Mahayana Buddhism}}
The '''Bodhisattva Precepts''' ({{CJKV|t=菩薩戒|p=Púsà Jiè}}, [[Japanese language|Japanese]]: ''bosatsukai'') are a set of moral codes used in [[Mahayana]] Buddhism to advance a practitioner along the path to becoming a [[Bodhisattva]]. Traditionally, monastics observed the basic moral code in Buddhism, the [[Prātimokṣa]] (such as that of the [[Dharmaguptaka]]), but in the Mahayana tradition, monks may observe the Bodhisattva Precepts as well.

==Sets of Precepts==

===''Brahmajala Sutra''===
The ''[[Brahmajala Sutra (Mahayana)|Brahmajala Sutra]]'', translated by [[Kumārajīva]] (c. 400 CE), has a list of ten major and forty-eight minor Bodhisattva vows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|editor1-last=Buswell|editor1-first=Robert Jr|editor2-last=Lopez|editor2-first=Donald S. Jr.|editor1-link=Robert Buswell Jr.|editor2-link=Donald S. Lopez Jr.|title=Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism (bodhisattvaśīla)|date=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=9780691157863|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bodhisattva Precepts may be often called the "Brahma Net Precepts" ({{zh|c=梵網戒|p=Fànwǎng Jiè}}), particularly in Buddhist scholarship, although other sets of bodhisattva precepts may be found in other texts as well. Typically, in East Asian Mahayana traditions, only the ten major precepts are considered the bodhisattva precepts. According to the sutra, the ten major bodhisattva precepts are in summary:&lt;ref name="Thanh 2000"&gt;{{cite web|last=Thanh |first=Minh |title=The Brahma Net Sutra |year=2000 |url=http://www.ymba.org/bns/bnstext.htm#m1 |publisher=New York: Sutra Translation Committee of the United States and Canada |accessdate=10 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611151922/http://www.ymba.org/bns/bnstext.htm#m1 |archivedate=June 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Not to kill or encourage others to kill.
# Not to steal or encourage others to steal.
# Not to engage in licentious acts or encourage others to do so. A monk is expected to abstain from sexual conduct entirely.
# Not to use false words and speech, or encourage others to do so.
# Not to trade or sell alcoholic beverages or encourage others to do so.
# Not to broadcast the misdeeds or faults of the Buddhist assembly, nor encourage others to do so.
# Not to praise oneself and speak ill of others, or encourage others to do so.
# Not to be stingy, or encourage others to do so.
# Not to harbor anger or encourage others to be angry.
# Not to speak ill of the Buddha, the Dharma or the Sangha (lit. the Triple Jewel)) or encourage others to do so.

Breaking any of these precepts is described as a major offense in the sutra. A fuller description is as follows:&lt;ref name="Thanh 2000"/&gt;
{{quote|
# A disciple of the Buddha shall not himself kill, encourage others to kill, kill by expedient means, praise killing, rejoice at witnessing killing, or kill through incantation or deviant mantras. He must not create the causes, conditions, methods, or karma of killing, and shall not intentionally kill any living creature. As a Buddha's disciple, he ought to nurture a mind of compassion and filial piety, always devising expedient means to rescue and protect all beings. If instead, he fails to restrain himself and kills sentient beings without mercy, he commits a Parajika (major) offense. 
# A disciple of the Buddha must not himself steal or encourage others to steal, steal by expedient means, steal by means of incantation or deviant mantras. He should not create the causes, conditions, methods, or karma of stealing. No valuables or possessions, even those belonging to ghosts and spirits or thieves and robbers, be they as small as a needle or blade of grass, may be stolen. As a Buddha's disciple, he ought to have a mind of mercy, compassion, and filial piety -- always helping people earn merits and achieve happiness. If instead, he steals the possessions of others, he commits a Parajika offense. 
# A disciple of the Buddha must not engage in licentious acts or encourage others to do so. [As a monk] he should not have sexual relations with any female -- be she a human, animal, deity or spirit -- nor create the causes, conditions, methods, or karma of such misconduct. Indeed, he must not engage in improper sexual conduct with anyone. A Buddha's disciple ought to have a mind of filial piety -- rescuing all sentient beings and instructing them in the Dharma of purity and chastity. If instead, he lacks compassion and encourages others to engage in sexual relations promiscuously, including with animals and even their mothers, daughters, sisters, or other close relatives, he commits a Parajika offense. 
# A disciple of the Buddha must not himself use false words and speech, or encourage others to lie or lie by expedient means. He should not involve himself in the causes, conditions, methods, or karma of lying, saying that he has seen what he has not seen or vice versa, or lying implicitly through physical or mental means.  As a Buddha's disciple, he ought to maintain Right Speech and Right Views always, and lead all others to maintain them as well. If instead, he causes wrong speech, wrong views or evil karma in others, he commits a Parajika offense. 
# A disciple of the Buddha must not trade in alcoholic beverages or encourage others to do so. He should not create the causes, conditions, methods, or karma of selling any intoxicant whatsoever, for intoxicants are the causes and conditions of all kinds of offenses. As a Buddha's disciple, he ought to help all sentient beings achieve clear wisdom. If instead, he causes them to have upside-down, topsy-turvy thinking, he commits a Parajika offense. 
# A disciple of the Buddha must not himself broadcast the misdeeds or infractions of Bodhisattva-clerics or Bodhisattva-laypersons, or of [ordinary] monks and nuns -- nor encourage others to do so. He must not create the causes, conditions, methods, or karma of discussing the offenses of the assembly. As a Buddha's disciple, whenever he hears evil persons, externalists or followers of the Two Vehicles speak of practices contrary to the Dharma or contrary to the precepts within the Buddhist community, he should instruct them with a compassionate mind and lead them to develop wholesome faith in the Mahayana. If instead, he discusses the faults and misdeeds that occur within the assembly, he commits a Parajika offense. 
# A disciple of the Buddha shall not praise himself and speak ill of others, or encourage others to do so. He must not create the causes, conditions, methods, or karma of praising himself and disparaging others. As a disciple of the Buddha, he should be willing to stand in for all sentient beings and endure humiliation and slander -- accepting blame and letting sentient beings have all the glory. If instead, he displays his own virtues and conceals the good points of others, thus causing them to suffer slander, he commits a Parajika offense. 
# A disciple of the Buddha must not be stingy or encourage others to be stingy. He should not create the causes, conditions, methods, or karma of stinginess. As a Bodhisattva, whenever a destitute person comes for help, he should give that person what he needs. If instead, out of anger and resentment, he denies all assistance -- refusing to help with even a penny, a needle, a blade of grass, even a single sentence or verse or a phrase of Dharma, but instead scolds and abuses that person -- he commits a Parajika offense. 
# A disciple of the Buddha shall not harbor anger or encourage others to be angry. He should not create the causes, conditions, methods, or karma of anger. As a disciple of the Buddha, he ought to be compassionate and filial, helping all sentient beings develop the good roots of non-contention. If instead, he insults and abuses sentient beings, or even transformation beings [such as deities and spirits], with harsh words, hitting them with his fists or feet, or attacking them with a knife or club -- or harbors grudges even when the victim confesses his mistakes and humbly seeks forgiveness in a soft, conciliatory voice -- the disciple commits a Parajika offense. 
# A Buddha's disciple shall not himself speak ill of the Triple Jewel or encourage others to do so. He must not create the causes, conditions, methods or karma of slander. If a disciple hears but a single word of slander against the Buddha from externalists or evil beings, he experiences a pain similar to that of three hundred spears piercing his heart. How then could he possibly slander the Triple Jewel himself? Hence, if a disciple lacks faith and filial piety towards the Triple Jewel, and even assists evil persons or those of aberrant views to slander the Triple Jewel, he commits a Parajika offense.}}

===''Bodhisattvabhumi''===
[[Asanga]] (circa 300 AD) delineated 18 major vows and forty-six minor vows in the "Bodhisattvabhumi" section of the ''[[Yogacarabhumi-sastra|Yogācārabhūmi Śāstra]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gyatso 1995, pp.13&amp;ndash;34&lt;/ref&gt; These Bodhisattva vows are still used in all four major traditions of [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. The eighteen major vows (as actions to be abandoned) are as follows:
# Praising oneself or belittling others due to attachment to receiving material offerings, praise and respect.
# Not giving material aid or (due to miserliness) not teaching the Dharma to those who are suffering and without a protector.
# Not listening to others' apologies or striking others.
# Abandoning the Mahayana by saying that Mahayana texts are not the words of Buddha or teaching what appears to be the Dharma but is not. 
# Taking things belonging to the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[Dharma]] or [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]].
# Abandoning the holy Dharma by saying that texts which teach the three vehicles are not the Buddha's word.
# With anger depriving ordained ones of their robes, beating and imprisoning them or causing them to lose their ordination even if they have impure morality, for example, by saying that being ordained is useless.
# Committing any of the five extremely negative actions: (1) killing one's mother, (2) killing one's father, (3) killing an [[arhat]], (4) intentionally drawing blood from a Buddha or (5) causing schism in the Sangha community by supporting and spreading sectarian views.
# Holding distorted views (which are contrary to the teaching of Buddha, such as denying the existence of the Three Jewels or the law of cause and effect etc.)
# Destroying towns, villages, cities or large areas by means such as fire, bombs, pollution or black magic.
# Teaching emptiness to those whose minds are unprepared.
# Causing those who have entered the Mahayana to turn away from working for the full enlightenment of Buddhahood and encouraging them to work merely for their own liberation from suffering.
# Causing others to abandon their [[Prātimokṣa]] vows.
# Belittling the [[Śrāvakayāna]] or [[Pratyekabuddhayāna]] (by holding and causing others to hold the view that these vehicles do not abandon attachment and other delusions).
# Falsely stating that oneself has realised profound [[Śūnyatā|emptiness]] and that if others meditate as one has, they will realize emptiness and become as great and as highly realized as oneself.
# Taking gifts from others who were encouraged to give you things originally intended as offerings to the Three Jewels. Not giving things to the Three Jewels that others have given you to give to them, or accepting property stolen from the Three Jewels.
# Causing those engaged in calm-abiding meditation to give it up by giving their belongings to those who are merely reciting texts or making bad disciplinary rules which cause a spiritual community not to be harmonious.
# Abandoning either of the two types of [[bodhicitta]] (aspiring and engaging).

According to [[Atiśa]], the Prātimokṣa vows are the basis for the Bodhisattva vows. Without keeping one of the different sets of Prātimokṣa vows (in one of the existing Vinaya schools), there can be no Bodhisattva vow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Great Kagyu Masters: The Golden Lineage Treasury |last=Gyaltsen |first=Konchog |year=1990 |publisher=Snow Lion Publications |location=Ithaca |isbn=9780937938881 | oclc=22210145 |pages=154&amp;ndash;86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Sixteen Bodhisattva Precepts in Sōtō Zen===

In the [[Sōtō]] school of [[Zen]], the founder [[Dōgen]] established a somewhat expanded version of the Bodhisattva Precepts for use by both priests and lay followers, based on both Brahma Net Sutra and other sources.  Many various translations exist, the following is used by [[John Daido Loori]], [[rōshi]] at the [[Zen Mountain Monastery]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mro.org/mro.html Mountains and Rivers Order of Zen Buddhism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821220000/http://www.mro.org/mro.html |date=August 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Three Treasures ====
*Taking refuge in the Buddha
*Taking refuge in the Dharma
*Taking refuge in the Sangha

The Three Treasures are universally known in Buddhism as the Three Refuges or [[Three Jewels]].

==== The Three Pure Precepts ====
*Do not create Evil
*Practice Good
*Actualize Good For Others

These are also known as the ''Three Root Precepts'', and are mentioned in the [[Brahmajala Sutra (Mahayana)|Brahma Net Sutra]] as well.

==== The Ten Grave Precepts ====
*Respect life – Do not kill
*Be giving – Do not steal
*Honor the body – Do not misuse sexuality
*Manifest truth – Do not lie
*Proceed clearly – Do not cloud the mind
*See the perfection – Do not speak of others' errors and faults
*Realize self and others as one – Do not elevate the self and blame others
*Give generously – Do not be withholding
*Actualize harmony – Do not be angry
*Experience the intimacy of things – Do not defile the Three Treasures

==Traditional uses==

===Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese traditions===
The Chinese [[Chan Buddhism|Chan]] monk, [[Yin Shun]], wrote of the Bodhisattva Precepts, "To cultivate [[bodhicitta|bodhi mind]] means to accept the bodhisattva precepts and practice the ten good deeds."&lt;ref name="yin-shun"&gt;{{cite book | last = Shih | first = Yin-Shun | title = The Way to Buddhahood | 
publisher = Wisdom Publications | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-86171-133-5 | page=329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, the acceptance of and ordination of the Bodhisattva Precepts varies greatly depending on the school of Mahayana Buddhism. In [[East Asian Buddhism]], a fully ordained monk or nun ordains under the traditional [[prātimokṣa]] precepts first according to the [[vinaya]] of the [[Dharmaguptaka]]. In the Chinese tradition, this is called the ''Four Part Vinaya'' ({{zh|c=四分律|p=Sìfēnlǜ}}). Then as a supplement, the same disciple would undertake the Bodhisattva Precepts as well.

Monks and nuns are not considered "ordained" by the Bodhisattva Precepts, but rather by the "Four Part Vinaya", while the Bodhisattva Precepts served to strengthen the Mahayana ideals.&lt;ref name="Ford"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ford|first=James L.|title=Jokei and Buddhist Devotion in Early Medieval Japan|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=0-19-518814-4|pages=131, 132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the Bodhisattva Precepts are given to lay disciples to strengthen their devotion to Buddhism as well.&lt;ref name="Ford" /&gt; Such disciples often take the basic [[Five Precepts]] and then the Bodhisattva precepts as a supplement.

===Japanese traditions===
In [[Buddhism in Japan]], the "Four-Part Vinaya" was deemphasized with the rise of [[Saichō]] and the [[Tendai]] sect&lt;ref name="Ford" /&gt; and a new monastic community was set up exclusively using the ''Brahmajala Sutra''{{'}}s Bodhisattva Precepts. All Vinaya ordinations at the time were given at [[Tōdai-ji]] in [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] and Saichō had wanted to both undermine the power of the Nara Buddhist community and to establish a "purely Mahayana lineage",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Abe | first = Ryuichi | title = The Weaving of Mantra: Kukai and the Construction of Esoteric Buddhist Discourse | publisher = Columbia University Press | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-231-11286-6 | pages=40–44, 50–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; and made a request to the Emperor to Later Buddhist sects, which was granted 7 days after his death in 822.

Later Buddhist sects in Japan, including the [[Sōtō|Sōtō school of Zen]], [[Jōdo-shū]] and [[Shingon Buddhism]], adopted a similar approach to their monastic communities and exclusive use of the Bodhisattva Precepts. By this time in Japan, the Vinaya lineage had all but died out and Japan's remote location made it difficult to reestablish though limited efforts by [[Jōkei (monk)|Jōkei]] and the [[Shingon Risshu]] revived it for a time. This was further enforced during the [[Meiji period]], when the {{nihongo|Nikujiku Saitai Law|肉食妻帯||}} of 1872 decriminalized clerical marriage and meat-eating.&lt;ref&gt;Horii, Mitsutoshi (2006).

== Activities ==

=== Alternative Energy Summit ===

The Alliance organizes an Alternative Energy Summit annually to discuss energy and climate policy issues.

In a April 2016 media report over the future of [[RWE]], an Alliance expert stated that the power company had become completely unprofitable after failing to adapt to the [[Energiewende in Germany|German Energiewende]].&lt;ref name="muenten-etal-2016"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Berlin Climate Talks ===

Since November 2015, the Alliance has organized the Berlin Climate Talks.  The format is now four per year, each with a different theme.  The launch event was devoted to civil society proposals for a more climate-friendly aviation concept for Germany.

=== Anti-Coal Campaign ===

Started in 2008, the most important campaign for the Alliance is the Anti-Coal Campaign.  The campaign coordinates and supports civil society activities to prevent new coal power plants from being built in Germany.  Coal is more carbon intensive than other fossil fuels, so that even the most advanced lignite-fired power plant discharges twice as much {{co2}} as a gas-fired power plant.  Coal power plants have a lifetime of 40–50 years and create high {{co2}} emissions throughout their lives.  Without a coal phase-out, the Alliance questions whether the German government can meet its future {{co2}} emissions targets.

Following a [[Greenpeace]] protest against [[lignite]] mining in the [[Lusatia|Lausitz]] in September 2013, a petition of 112,157 signatures in support was handed to the Lausitz authorities.  Daniela Setton, an energy policy speaker from the Alliance, commented that it was the most successful collection of signatures against a new German opencast mine ever.&lt;ref name="deutschlandradio-2013"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014 the Alliance co-authored and co-published a report on the top 30 most polluting coal-fired power plants in Europe and called for their decommissioning.&lt;ref name="gutmann-etal-2014"&gt;

In July 2016, the Alliance, together with [[Bund für Umwelt und Naturschutz Deutschland|BUND]], the [[Heinrich Böll Foundation]], and the [[Rosa Luxemburg Stiftung|Rosa Luxemburg Foundation]] released a report on the aftermath of [[lignite]] mining in Germany.&lt;ref name="iass-2016"&gt;

=== Global Climate Day of Action ===

For the annual Global Climate Day of Action, the Alliance organizes nationwide demonstrations for the general public, to protest at the lack of environmental awareness in politics and the economy and to encourage climate protection measures.

Alliance spokesperson Katharina Reuter, in an interview with [[Deutschlandfunk]] in December 2011, criticized the exit by [[Canada]] from the [[Kyoto Protocol]].&lt;ref name="geers-2011"&gt;

{{about|the emotion}}
{{Emotion}}
'''Confidence''' has a common meaning of a certainty about handling something, such as work, family, social events, or relationships.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stajkovic|first=Alex|date=2006|title=Development of a Core Confidence-Higher Order Construct|url=|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|volume=91|number=6|pages=1208-1224|via=|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.91.6.1208|pmid=17100479}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have ascribed confidence as a state of being certain either that a hypothesis or prediction is correct or that a chosen course of action is the best or most effective. Confidence comes from a latin word fidere' which means "to trust"; therefore, having a '''[[self-confidence]]''' is having trust in one's self. '''Arrogance''' or '''[[hubris]]''' in this comparison is having unmerited confidence&amp;nbsp;– believing something or someone is capable or correct when they are not. '''Overconfidence''' or '''presumptuousness''' is excessive belief in someone (or something) succeeding, without any regard for failure. Confidence can be a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]] as those without it may fail or not try because they lack it and those with it may succeed because they have it rather than because of an innate ability.

== Extent ==
Taken to an extreme, over-confidence can cause problems as evidenced by the famous author Matthew Syed and mentioned here in this reference in regard to sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Syed|first1=Matthew|title=Mourinho damned by his god complex|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/sport/columnists/matthewsyed/article4642066.ece|accessdate=18 December 2015|publisher=The Times|date=16 December 2015|location=London|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motivation theories have suggested that successful performance hinges on both skill and will.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Managerial attitudes and performance|last=Porter, L. W., &amp; Lawler, E.|first=|publisher=Dorsey|year=1968|isbn=|location=Homework, IL|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, even a motivated and skilled individual can fail to perform if he or she does not have a personal certainty belief that s/he can handle what it takes or what needs to be done.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Alex Stajkovic|Stajkovic]] (2006) argues that all three&amp;nbsp;– skill, will, and confidence&amp;nbsp;– are needed for action to unfold.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The opposite of confidence is doubt. 

==Core confidence==
{{Main|Self-confidence}}
Confidence sits at the core of four other manifestations:  Hope, Efficacy, Optimism and Resilience. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stajkovic|first=Alexander D.|last2=Lee|first2=Dongseop|last3=Greenwald|first3=Jessica M.|last4=Raffiee|first4=Joseph|date=May 2015|title=The role of trait core confidence higher-order construct in self-regulation of performance and attitudes: Evidence from four studies|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.obhdp.2015.02.001|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|volume=128|pages=29–48|doi=10.1016/j.obhdp.2015.02.001|issn=0749-5978}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Wisconsin School of Business at the University of Wisconsin-Madison|title=What is Confidence?: Faculty Research from the Wisconsin School of Business|date=2015-07-08|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOU0BbHnQgU|access-date=2018-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Core confidence impacts hope by allowing one to figure out what needs to be done and how to do it. It affects self-efficacy as one gains the belief that specific tasks can be completed, gives one a positive outlook (optimism), and increases the belief that one can overcome obstacles (resilience). &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;Confidence enables the potential that is already present (skill and motivation) to unfold.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Self-confidence does not necessarily imply "self-belief" or a belief in one's ability to succeed. For instance, one may be inept at a particular sport or activity, but remain "confident" in one's demeanor, simply because one does not place a great deal of emphasis on the outcome of the activity. When one does not dwell on negative consequences one can be more "self-confident" because one is worrying far less about failure or the disapproval of others following potential failure. One is then more likely to focus on the actual situation which means that enjoyment and success in that situation is also more probable. Belief in one's abilities to perform an activity comes through successful experience and may add to, or consolidate, a general sense of self-confidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stajkovic|first=Alexander D.|last2=Luthans|first2=Fred|date=1998|title=Social cognitive theory and self-efficacy: Goin beyond traditional motivational and behavioral approaches|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0090261698900067|journal=Organizational Dynamics|volume=26|issue=4|pages=62–74|doi=10.1016/s0090-2616(98)90006-7|issn=0090-2616|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research by Stajkovic and colleagues revealed that confidence was a significant factor in academic performance, sales performance, satisfaction with life and job satisfaction.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Studies have also found a link between high levels of confidence and wages. Seemingly, those who self-report they were confident earlier in schooling earned better wages and were promoted more quickly over the life course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afr.com/p/national/work_space/lifelong_confidence_rewarded_in_gSNmV78QAuqjmT8Ksy3QSJ |title=Lifelong confidence rewarded in bigger pay packets |work=The Australian Financial Review |date=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Core confidence may also be linked to work satisfaction and plays a role in self-regulation.  If there is doubt that a change can be made in response to feedback, it is unlikely the change will occur. However, if core confidence is high, the change is more likely to occur. If a person lacks core confidence, they are not likely to initiate the change needed. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Those who have high core confidence are more likely to set and achieve high performance goals. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Lack of self-confidence==
Low confidence makes it less likely that a person will initiate action and more likely that a person will disengage because they doubt they can handle what needs to be done.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Even with skill and motivation, without confidence, goals are not likely to be met. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In certain fields of medical practice patients experience lack of self-confidence during the recovery period. This is commonly referred to as DSF or "defectum sui fiducia" from the Latin etymology of lack of self-confidence. For example, this can be the case after stroke whereby the patient refrains from using the weaker lower limb due to fear of it not being strong to hold their weight whilst standing or walking.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Possible explanation==
{{Original research|section|date=October 2018}}
It is suggested that the confidence bias can be explained by a noisy conversion of objective evidence (observation) into subjective estimates (judgment), whereas noise is defined as the mixing of memories during the storing (observing/learning) and retrieval process (remembering/judgment).&lt;ref name="HilbertPsychBull"&gt;Martin Hilbert (2012) ''[http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2011-27261-001 "Toward a synthesis of cognitive biases: How noisy information processing can bias human decision making"]''. Psychological Bulletin, 138(2), 211–237; free access to the study here: martinhilbert.net/HilbertPsychBull.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[information-theoretic]] logic behind this explanation is very similar to the mechanism that can also lead to the [[conservatism bias]], and holds that we mix true and false evidence during storage and retrieval of evidence to and from our memories. The confidence bias results because as judges we "look inside our own memory" (evaluate our confidence) and find evidence that is more extreme than when we retrieve evidence for our judgements (which are conservative due to mixing of extreme values during retrieval). This explanation is very simple and straightforward, but nevertheless sufficient mechanism to generate both, overconfidence (in situations where judges are very sure) and underconfidence (in cases when judges openly state to lack the required knowledge).

{{Disability}}
'''Disability hate crime''' is a form of [[hate crime]] arising from the hostility of the perpetrator towards the [[disability]], or perceived disability, of the victim, or because of their perceived connection to disability. It is often viewed politically as a logical extreme of [[ableism]] (sometimes known in the UK by the disputed word "disablism"), carried through into criminal acts against the person. This phenomenon can take many forms, from [[verbal abuse]] and [[intimidation|intimidatory behaviour]] to [[vandalism]], [[assault]], or even [[murder]]. Disability hate crimes may take the form of one-off incidents, or may represent systematic abuse which continues over periods of weeks, months or even years.

Disability hate crime may occur between strangers who have never met, between acquaintances or within the family. The two key requirements for an act to be called a "disability hate crime" are that it is motivated in part or whole by prejudice against someone because of disability; and second, that the act is actually a crime.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Sherry (2010) "Disability Hate Crimes: Does Anyone Really Hate Disabled People?" Ashgate, London&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recognition==
[[Ken Macdonald|Sir Ken Macdonald, QC]], the then [[Director of Public Prosecutions (England and Wales)|Director of Public Prosecutions for England and Wales]] stated in a speech to the [[Bar Council]] in October 2008 that "I am on record as saying that it is my sense that disability hate crime is very widespread. I have said that it is my view that at the lower end of the spectrum there is a vast amount not being picked up. I have also expressed the view that the more serious disability hate crimes are not always being prosecuted as they should be. This is a scar on the conscience of criminal justice. And all bodies and all institutions involved in the delivery of justice, including my own, share the responsibility." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/d_to_g/disability_hate_crime_/#a16|title=Error 404 (page not found): The Crown Prosecution Service|publisher=|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal status==
In the [[United States of America|United States]], the ''[[Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act]]'' of 2009 expanded the [[Hate crimes in the United States#Federal prosecution of hate crimes|1969 United States federal hate-crime law]] to include crimes motivated by a victim's actual or perceived disability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/10/28/obama-signs-billion-defense-policy/ Obama Signs Defense Policy Bill That Includes 'Hate Crime' Legislation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030123045/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/10/28/obama-signs-billion-defense-policy/ |date=2009-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], disability hate crime is regarded as an aggravating factor under Section 146 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]], allowing a heavier tariff to be used in sentencing than the crime might draw without the hate elements. Section 146 states that the sentencing provisions apply if:
:(a) that, at the time of committing the offence, or immediately before or after doing so, the offender demonstrated towards the victim of the offence hostility based on—
::(i) the sexual orientation (or presumed sexual orientation) of the victim, or
::(ii) a disability (or presumed disability) of the victim, or
:(b) that the offence is motivated (wholly or partly)—
::(i) by hostility towards persons who are of a particular sexual orientation, or
::(ii) by hostility towards persons who have a disability or a particular disability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/ukpga_20030044_en_14#pt12-ch1-pb1-l1g145 Sections 145 and 146 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003].&lt;/ref&gt;

The test in Section 146 is deliberately one for evidence of 'hostility' rather than 'hatred' as the seriousness of the offence was considered to justify the application of a less-strict test.

== Crime recording ==
The historical failure of police forces, prosecutors and some social care organizations to treat disability hate crime as a serious issue, an echo of previous failures over other forms of hate crime, particularly racial and [[Violence against LGBT  people|LGBT-focused hate crimes]], has led to chronic under-reporting. This under-reporting is both pre-emptive, through a widespread belief within the disabled community that they will not be treated seriously by law enforcement, and post-facto, where police forces investigate the crime as non hate-based and record it as such.

The UK [[Crown Prosecution Service]]'s Annual Hate Crime Report,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/publications/prosecution/disability.html|title=The CPS : Disability hate crime|publisher=|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that 11,624 cases of racial or religious hate crime were prosecuted in England and Wales in 2009 with 10,690 leading to successful convictions. By contrast only 363 prosecutions and 299 convictions were for disability hate crimes.

The UK charity [[Scope (charity)|Scope]] has conducted research into the prevalence and experience of disability hate crime, summarizing their findings and those of other disability groups in the report ''Getting Away With Murder'' &lt;ref&gt;http://www.scope.org.uk/About-Us/Research-and-Policy/Publication-directory/Getting-away-with-murder&lt;/ref&gt;  Katharine Quarmby, who wrote the report and was the first British journalist to investigate disability hate crime, has also written a book on the matter.&lt;ref name=Quarmby&gt;Quarmby, Katharine. "Scapegoat: Why we are failing disabled people." ''Portobello'', 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Perceived vulnerability ==
The treatment of disability hate crimes has been affected by the perception of disabled people as inherently [[vulnerability|vulnerable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-09-16/young-victim-blaming-at-its-very-worst/5745346|title=Disability and murder: victim blaming at its very worst|work=ABC News|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a multi-faceted issue. Unfounded application of the 'vulnerable' label to a disabled person is considered a form of infantilization, a type of ableism in which disabled people are regarded as childlike, rather than as functioning adults.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} 

Perceptions of [[social vulnerability|vulnerability]] can also lead to the perception that the victim is partially or entirely responsible for the crime. For example, a disabled person may be perceived as having been at fault due to being alone after dark, i.e. engaged in risky behaviour. This pattern of [[victim blaming]] has also appeared in the prosecution of rape and other sexual crimes.

On the other hand, it has been suggested that the vulnerability of victims is a key factor in all crimes. It has been applied to wide variety of scenarios, including people working at night or handling large amounts of money.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Sherry (2010) Disability Hate Crimes: Does anyone really hate disabled people? Ashgate, London&lt;/ref&gt;

The Crown Prosecution Service has issued guidance to its prosecutors reminding them that 'vulnerable' should only be used as a description of a person within the precise legal meaning of the term - for instance, as defined in section 16 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/d_to_g/disability_hate_crime_ Guidance on the distinction between vulnerability and hostility in the context of crimes committed against disabled people&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37885">'''Emotion perception''' refers to the capacities and abilities of recognizing and identifying [[emotion]]s in others, in addition to [[biology|biological]] and [[physiology|physiological]] processes involved.  Emotions are typically viewed as having three components: subjective experience, physical changes, and [[cognition|cognitive]] appraisal; emotion [[perception]] is the ability to make accurate decisions about another's subjective experience by interpreting their physical changes through sensory systems responsible for converting these observed changes into mental representations. The ability to perceive emotion is believed to be both innate and subject to environmental influence and is also a critical component in social interactions. How emotion is experienced and interpreted depends on how it is perceived. Likewise, how emotion is perceived is dependent on past experiences and interpretations. Emotion can be accurately perceived in humans. Emotions can be perceived visually, audibly, through smell and also through bodily sensations and this process is believed to be different from the perception of non-emotional material.

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Modes of perception==
Emotions can be perceived through visual, auditory, olfactory, and physiological sensory processes. Nonverbal actions can provide social partners with information about subjective and emotional states.  This nonverbal information is believed to hold special importance and sensory systems and certain brain regions are suspected to specialize in decoding emotional information for rapid and efficient processing.

=== Visual ===

{{Main|Visual system}}
The [[visual system]] is the primary mode of [[perception]] for the way people receive emotional information.  People use emotional cues displayed by social partners to make decisions regarding their [[affect (psychology)|affective state]]. Emotional cues can be in the form of [[facial expression]]s, which are actually a combination of many distinct muscle groups within the face, or [[human positions|bodily postures]] (alone or in relation to others), or found through the interpretation of a situation or environment known to have particular emotional properties (i.e., a [[funeral]], a [[wedding]], a [[war|war zone]], a scary alley, etc.). While the visual system is the means by which emotional information is gathered, it is the cognitive interpretation and evaluation of this information that assigns it emotional value, garners the appropriate [[cognition|cognitive]] resources, and then initiates a physiological response. This process is by no means exclusive to visual perception and in fact may overlap considerably with other modes of perception, suggesting an emotional sensory system comprising multiple perceptual processes all of which are processed through similar channels.

==== Facial perception ====

{{Main|Face perception}}
A great deal of research conducted on emotion perception revolves around how people perceive emotion in others' facial expressions. Whether the emotion contained in someone's face is classified categorically or along dimensions of [[valence (psychology)|valence]] and [[arousal]], the face provides reliable cues to one's subjective emotional state. As efficient as humans are in identifying and recognizing emotion in another's face, accuracy goes down considerably for most emotions, with the exception of happiness, when facial features are inverted (i.e., mouth placed above eyes and nose), suggesting that a primary means of facial perception includes the identification of [[Three-dimensional space|spatial]] features that resemble a prototypical face, such that two eyes are placed above a nose which is above a mouth; any other formation of features does not immediately constitute a face and requires extra spatial manipulation to identify such features as resembling a face.

===== Discrete versus dimensional views =====

{{Main|Emotion classification}}
Research on the classification of perceived emotions has centered around the debate between two fundamentally distinct viewpoints.  One side of the debate posits that emotions are separate and discrete entities whereas the other side suggests that emotions can be classified as values on the dimensions of valence (positive versus negative) and arousal (calm/soothing versus exciting/agitating). [[Psychologist]] [[Paul Ekman]] supported the discrete emotion perspective with his groundbreaking work comparing emotion perception and expression between literate and preliterate cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Ekman, P. (1993). Facial expression of emotion. American Psychologist, 48, 384–392.&lt;/ref&gt; Ekman concluded that the ability to produce and perceive emotions is universal and innate and that emotions manifest categorically as basic emotions ([[anger]], [[disgust]], [[fear]], [[happiness]], [[sadness]], [[contempt]], [[surprise (emotion)|surprise]], and possibly [[contempt]]). The alternative dimensional view garnered support from psychologist James Russell, who is best known for his contributions toward the circumplex of emotion. Russell described emotions as [[construct (philosophy of science)|construct]]s which lie on the dimensions of valence and arousal and it is the combination of these values which delineate emotion.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, J.A. (1980). A circumplex model of affect. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 39, 1161–1178.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist [[Robert Plutchik]] sought to reconcile these views and proposed that certain emotions be considered "primary emotions" which are grouped either positively or negatively and can then be combined to form more complex emotions, sometimes considered "secondary emotions", such as [[remorse]], [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[submission]], and [[anticipation (emotion)|anticipation]].  Plutchik created the "wheel of emotions" to outline his theory.&lt;ref&gt;Plutchik, R. (2002). Nature of emotions. American Scientist, 89, 349.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Culture =====

[[Culture]] plays a significant role in emotion perception, most notably in facial perception. Although the features of the face convey important information, the upper (eyes/brow) and lower (mouth/nose) regions of the face have distinct qualities that can provide both consistent and conflicting information. As values, [[etiquette]], and quality of social interactions vary across cultures, facial perception is believed to be moderated accordingly. In western cultures, where overt emotion is ubiquitous, emotional information is primarily obtained from viewing the features of the mouth, which is the most expressive part of the face. However, in eastern cultures, where overt emotional expression is less common and therefore the mouth plays a lesser role in emotional expression, emotional information is more often obtained from viewing the upper region of the face, primarily the eyes.&lt;ref&gt;Yuki, M., Maddux, W. W., &amp; Masuda, T. (2007). Are the windows to the soul the same in the East and West? Cultural differences in using the eyes and mouth as cues to recognize emotions in Japan and the United States. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 43(2), 303–311. doi:10.1016/j.jesp.2006.02.004&lt;/ref&gt; These cultural differences suggest a strong environmental and learned component in emotion expression and emotion perception.

===== Context =====

Although facial expressions convey key emotional information, context also plays an important role in both providing additional emotional information and modulating what emotion is actually perceived in a facial expression. Contexts come in three categories: stimulus-based context, in which a face is physically presented with other sensory input that has informational value; perceiver-based context, in which processes within the brain or body of a perceiver can shape emotion perception; and cultural contexts that affect either the encoding or the understanding of facial actions.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, L. F., [[Batja Mesquita|Mesquita, B.]], &amp; Gendron, M. (2011). Context in Emotion Perception. Current Directions in Psychological Science, 20(5), 286–290. doi:10.1177/0963721411422522.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Auditory ===

{{Main|Auditory system}}
The auditory system can provide important emotional information about the environment. [[Human voice|Voices]], screams, murmurs, and [[music]] can convey emotional information. Emotional interpretations of sounds tend to be quite consistent. Traditionally, emotion perception in the voice has been determined through research studies analyzing, via [[prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] parameters such as [[pitch (music)|pitch]] and [[Time|duration]], the way in which a speaker expresses an emotion, known as [[encoding]]. Alternatively, a listener who attempts to identify a particular emotion as intended by a speaker can [[wikt:decoding|decode]] emotion. More sophisticated methods include manipulating or [[synthesizer|synthesizing]] important prosodic parameters in speech signal (e.g., pitch, duration, loudness, voice quality) in both natural and simulated affective speech.&lt;ref&gt;Cummings, K.E., &amp; Clements, M.A. (1995). Analysis of the glottal excitation of emotionally styled and stressed speech. Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 98, 88± 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Pitch and duration tend to contribute more to emotional recognition than loudness.&lt;ref&gt;Frick, R.W. (1985). Communicating emotion: the role of prosodic features. Psychological Bulletin, 97, 412± 429.&lt;/ref&gt; Music has long been known to have emotional qualities and is a popular strategy in emotion regulation. When asked to rate emotions present in classical music, music professionals could identify all six basic emotions with happiness and sadness the most represented, and in decreasing order of importance, anger, fear, surprise, and disgust.&lt;ref&gt;Kallinen, K. (2005). Emotional ratings of music excerpts in the Western art music repertoire and their self-organization in the Kohonen Neural Network. Psychology of Music, 33(4), 373–393.&lt;/ref&gt; The emotions of happiness, sadness, fear, and peacefulness can be perceived in a short length of exposure, as little as 9–16 seconds&lt;ref&gt;Vieillard, S., Peretz, I., Gosselin, N., Khalfa, S., Gagnon, L., &amp; Bouchard, B. (2008). Happy, sad, scary and peaceful musical excerpts for research on emotions.

Perception of six basic emotions in music. Psychology of Music, 39(4), 503–517. doi:10.1177/0305735610378183.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Olfactory ===

{{Main|Olfactory system}}
Aromas and scents also influence mood, for example through aromatherapy,&lt;ref&gt;Herz, R. S. (2009). Aromatherapy Facts and Fictions: A Scientific Analysis of Olfactory Effects on Mood, Physiology and Behavior. International Journal of Neuroscience, 119(2), 263–290. doi:10.1080/00207450802333953&lt;/ref&gt; and humans can extract emotional information from scents just as they can from facial expressions and emotional music. Odors may be able to exert their effects through learning and conscious perception, such that responses typically associated with particular odors are learned through association with their matched emotional experiences. In-depth research has documented that emotion elicited by odors, both pleasant and unpleasant, affects the same physiological correlates of emotion seen with other sensory mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;Alaoui-Ismaili, O., Robin, O., Rada, H., Dittmar, A., &amp; Vernet-Maury, E. (1997). Basic emotions evoked by odorants: Comparison between autonomic responses and self-evaluation. Physiology &amp; Behavior, 62, 713–720.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Somatic ===

Theories on emotion have focused on perception, subjective experience, and appraisal. Predominant theories of emotion and emotion perception include what type of emotion is perceived, how emotion is perceived [[Somatic marker hypothesis|somatic]]ally, and at what stage of an event emotion is perceived and translated into subjective, physical experience.

==== James-Lange theory ====

{{Main|James–Lange theory}}
Following the influence of [[René Descartes]] and his ideas regarding the split between body and mind, in 1884 [[William James]] proposed the theory that it is not that the human body acts in response to our emotional state, as common sense might suggest, but rather, we interpret our emotions on the basis of our already present bodily state. In the words of James, "we feel sad because we cry, angry because we strike, afraid because we tremble, and neither we cry, strike, nor tremble because we are sorry, angry, or fearful, as the case may be."  James believed it was particular and distinct physical patterns that map onto specific experienced emotions. Contemporaneously, psychologist [[Carl Lange (psychologist)|Carl Lange]] arrived at the same conclusion about the experience of emotions. Thus, the idea that felt emotion is the result of perceiving specific patterns of bodily responses is called the James-Lange theory of emotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cannon|first=Walter B.|title=The James-Lange theory of emotion: A critical examination and an alternative theory.|journal=The American Journal of Psychology|year=1927|volume=39|pages=106–124|doi=10.2307/1415404}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In support of the James-Lange theory of emotion, [[Silvan Tomkins]] proposed the facial feedback hypothesis in 1963; he suggested that facial expressions actually trigger the experience of emotions and not the other way around. This theory was tested in 1974 by James Laird in an experiment where Laird asked participants to hold a pencil either between their teeth (artificially producing a smile) or between their upper lip and their nose (artificially producing a frown) and then rate cartoons. Laird found that these cartoons were rated as being funnier by those participants holding a pencil in between their teeth. In addition, [[Paul Ekman]] recorded extensive physiological data while participants posed his basic emotional facial expressions and found that heart rate raised for sadness, fear, and anger yet did not change at al for happiness, surprise, or disgust, and skin temperature raised when participants posed anger but not other emotions. While contemporary psychologists still agree with the James-Lange theory of emotion, human subjective emotion is complex and physical reactions or antecedents do not fully explain the subjective emotional experience.

==== Cannon-Bard theory of emotion ====

{{Main|Cannon-Bard theory}}
[[Walter Bradford Cannon]] and his doctoral student Philip Bard agreed that physiological responses played a crucial role in emotions, but did not believe that physiological responses alone could explain [[subjectivity|subjective]] emotional experiences. They argued that physiological responses were too slow relative to the relatively rapid and intense subjective awareness of emotion and that often these emotions are similar and imperceptible to people at such a short timescale. Cannon proposed that the mind and body operate independently in the experience of emotions such that differing brain regions (cortex versus subcortex) process information from an emotion-producing stimulus independently and simultaneously resulting in both an emotional and a physical response. This is best illustrated by imagining an encounter with a grizzly bear; you would simultaneously experience fear, begin to sweat, experience an elevated heart rate, and attempt to run. All of these things would happen at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cannon|first=Walter B.|title=Organization for Physiological Homeostasis|journal=Physiological Reviews|year=1929|volume=9|issue=3|pages=399–421}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Two-factor theory ====

{{Main|Two-factor theory of emotion}}
[[Stanley Schachter]] and his doctoral student Jerome Singer formulated their theory of emotion based on evidence that without an actual emotion-producing stimulus, people are unable to attribute specific emotions to their bodily states. They believed that there must be a cognitive component to emotion perception beyond that of just physical changes and subjective feelings. Schachter and Singer suggested that when someone encounters such an emotion-producing stimulus, they would immediately recognize their bodily symptoms (sweating and elevated heart rate in the case of the grizzly bear) as the emotion fear. Their theory was devised as a result of a study in which participants were injected with either a stimulant (adrenaline) that causes elevated heart rate, sweaty palms and shaking, or a placebo. Participants were then either told what the effects of the drug were or were told nothing, and were then placed in a room with a person they did not know who, according to the research plan, would either play with a hula hoop and make paper airplanes (euphoric condition) or ask the participant intimate, personal questions (angry condition). What they found was that participants who knew what the effects of the drug were attributed their physical state to the effects of the drug; however, those who had no knowledge of the drug they received attributed their physical state to the situation with the other person in the room. These results led to the conclusion that physiological reactions contributed to emotional experience by facilitating a focused cognitive appraisal of a given physiologically arousing event and that this appraisal was what defined the subjective emotional experience. Emotions were thus a result of a two-stage process: first, physiological arousal in a response to an evoking stimulus, and second, cognitive elaboration of the context in which the stimulus occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Schachter, S., &amp; Singer, J. (1962). Cognitive, Social, and Physiological Determinants of Emotional State. Psychological Review, 69, pp. 379–399&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neural bases==
Emotion perception is primarily a cognitive process driven by particular brain systems believed to specialize in identifying emotional information and subsequently allocating appropriate cognitive resources to prepare the body to respond. The relationship between various regions is still unclear, but a few key regions have been implicated in particular aspects of emotion perception and processing including areas suspected of being involved in the processing of faces and emotional information.

=== Fusiform face area ===

{{Main|Fusiform face area}}
The fusiform face area, part of the [[fusiform gyrus]] is an area some believe to specialize in the identification and processing of human faces, although others suspect it is responsible for distinguishing between well known objects such as cars and animals{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}. [[Neuroimaging]] studies have found activation in this area in response to participants viewing images of prototypical faces, but not scrambled or inverted faces, suggesting that this region is specialized for processing human faces but not other material. This area has been an area of increasing debate and while some psychologists may approach the fusiform face area in a simplistic manner, in that it specializes in the processing of human faces, more likely this area is implicated in the visual processing of many objects, particularly those familiar and prevalent in the environment. Impairments in the ability to recognize subtle differences in faces would greatly inhibit emotion perception and processing and have significant implications involving social interactions and appropriate biological responses to emotional information.

=== HPA axis ===

{{Main|Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis}}
The [[hypothalamus|hypothalamic]]-[[pituitary gland|pituitary]]-[[adrenal gland|adrenal]] [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis|(HPA) axis]] plays a role in emotion perception through its [[mediation]] of the physiological [[stress response]]. This occurs through the release of hypothalamic [[corticotropin-releasing hormone|corticotropin-releasing factor]], also known as corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), from nerve terminals in the [[median eminence]] arising in the [[paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus|paraventricular nucleus]], which stimulates [[adrenocorticotropic hormone|adrenocorticotropin]] release from the [[anterior pituitary]] that in turn induces the release of [[cortisol]] from the adrenal cortex. This progressive process culminating in the release of [[glucocorticoid]]s to environmental stimuli is believed to be initiated by the amygdala, which evaluates the emotional significance of observed phenomena. Released glucocorticoids provide negative feedback on the system and also the [[hippocampus]], which in turn regulates the shutting off of this biological stress response. It is through this response that information is encoded as emotional and bodily response is initiated, making the HPA axis an important component in emotion perception.

=== Amygdala ===

{{Main|Amygdala}}
The [[amygdala]] appears to have a specific role in attention to emotional stimuli.&lt;ref name="Davis M 2001"&gt;Davis M, Whalen PJ (2001): The amygdala: Vigilance and emotion. Molecular Psychiatry 6:3–34.&lt;/ref&gt;  The amygdala is a small, almond-shaped region within the anterior part of the temporal lobe. Several studies of non-human primates and of patients with amygdala lesions, in addition to studies employing functional neuroimaging techniques, have demonstrated the importance of the amygdala in face and eye-gaze identification.&lt;ref name="Davis M 2001"/&gt; Other studies have emphasized the importance of the amygdala for the identification of emotional expressions displayed by others, in particular threat-related emotions such as fear, but also sadness and happiness. In addition, the amygdala is involved in the response to non-facial displays of emotion, including unpleasant auditory, olfactory and gustatory stimuli, and in memory for emotional information.&lt;ref&gt;Calder AJ, Lawrence AD, Young AW (2001): Neuropsychology of fear and loathing. Nature Reviews Neuroscience, 2, 352–363.&lt;/ref&gt; The amygdala receives information from both the thalamus and the cortex; information from the thalamus is rough in detail and the amygdala receives this very quickly, while information from the cortex is much more detailed but is received more slowly.&lt;ref&gt;LeDoux, J. E. (1995). Emotion: Clues from the brain. Annual Review of Psychology, 46(1), 209–235.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the amygdala's role in attention modulation toward emotion-specific stimuli may occur via projections from the central nucleus of the amygdala to cholinergic neurons, which lower cortical neuronal activation thresholds and potentiate cortical information processing.&lt;ref&gt;Whalen PJ (1998): Fear, vigilance, and ambiguity: Initial neuro-imaging studies of the human amygdala. Current Directions in Psychological Science 7:177–188.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disordered emotion perception==
There is great individual difference in emotion perception and certain groups of people display abnormal processes. Some disorders are in part classified by maladaptive and abnormal emotion perception while others, such as mood disorders, exhibit mood-congruent emotional processing. Whether abnormal processing leads to the exacerbation of certain disorders or is the result of these disorders is yet unclear, however, difficulties or deficits in emotion perception are common among various disorders.

Research investigating face and emotion perception in autistic individuals is inconclusive. Past research has found atypical, piecemeal face-processing strategies among autistic individuals&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, G., Webb, S. J., &amp; McPartland, J. (2005). Understanding the nature of face processing impairment in autism: insights from behavioral and electrophysiological studies. Developmental Neuropsychology, 27(3), 403–424.&lt;/ref&gt; and a better memory for lower versus upper regions of the face and increased abilities to identify partly obscured faces.&lt;ref&gt;Tantam, D., Monoghan, L., Nicholson, H., &amp; Stirling, J.

Recognition of faces: An approach to the study of autism. Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry and Allied Disciplines, 19, 255–268.&lt;/ref&gt; Autistic individuals tend to display deficits in social motivation and experience that may decrease overall experience with faces and this in turn may lead to abnormal cortical specialization for faces and decreased processing efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, G., Carver, L., Meltzoff, A., Panagiotides, H., McPartland, J., &amp; Webb, S. (2002). Neural correlates of face and object recognition in young children with autism spectrum disorder, developmental delay, and typical development. Child Development, 73, 700–717.&lt;/ref&gt; However, these results have not been adequately replicated and meta-analyses have found little to no differential face processing between typically-developing and autistic individuals although autistic people reliably display worse face memory and eye perception which could mediate face and possibly emotion perception.&lt;ref&gt;Weigelt, S., Koldewyn, K., &amp; Kanwisher, N. (2012). Face identity recognition in autism spectrum disorders: A review of behavioral studies. Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews, 36(3), 1060–1084. doi:10.1016/j.neubiorev.2011.12.008&lt;/ref&gt;
Individuals with [[schizophrenia]] also have difficulties with all types of facial emotion expression perception,&lt;ref&gt;Kohler, C. G., Walker, J. B., Martin, E. A., Healey, K. M., &amp; Moberg, P. J. (2010). Facial Emotion Perception in Schizophrenia: A Meta-analytic Review.

Emotion Perception in Schizophrenia: Context Matters. Emotion Review, 4(2), 182–186. doi:10.1177/1754073911430140&lt;/ref&gt; and indeed, facial perception more generally.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, S. L., &amp; Neale, J. M. (1993). Emotion perception in schizophrenia: Specific deficit or further evidence of generalized poor performance?

C., et al (2001) Neural mechanisms of anhedonia in schizophrenia. JAMA, 286, 427^435.&lt;/ref&gt; all of which may contribute to impaired psychosocial functioning.

In patients with [[major depressive disorder]], studies have demonstrated either generalized or specific impairments in the identification of emotional facial expressions, or a bias towards the identification of expressions as sad.&lt;ref&gt;Gur, R. C., Erwin, R. J., Gur, R. E., et al (1992) Facial emotion discrimination. II: Behavioral findings in depression. Psychiatric Research, 42, 241^251.&lt;/ref&gt; Neuro-pathological and structural neuroimaging studies in patients with major depressive disorder have indicated abnormalities within the subgenual anterior cingulate gyrus and volume reductions within the hippocampus, ventral striatal regions and amygdala.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, M. L. (2003). Understanding the neurobiology of emotion perception: implications for psychiatry. The British Journal of Psychiatry, 182(3), 190–192. doi:10.1192/bjp.02.185&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[anxiety]] has been commonly associated with individuals being able to perceive threat when in fact none is present,&lt;ref&gt;Richards, A., French, C. C., Calder, A. J., Webb, B., Fox, R., &amp; Young, A. W. (2002). Anxiety-related bias in the classification of emotionally ambiguous facial expressions. Emotion, 2, 273–287.&lt;/ref&gt; and orient more quickly to threatening cues than other cues.&lt;ref&gt;Bar-Haim, Y., Lamy, D., Pergamin, L., Bakermans-Kranenburg, M. J., &amp; van IJzendoorn, M. H.

Automatic activation and strategic avoidance of threat-relevant information in social phobia. Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 107, 285–290.&lt;/ref&gt; As a form of anxiety, [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)]] has also been linked with abnormal attention toward threatening information, in particular, threatening stimuli which relates to the personally relevant [[Psychological trauma|trauma]], making such a bias in that context appropriate, but out of context, maladaptive.&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, T. C., Blanchard, E. B., &amp; Neill, W. T. (2000). Information processing and PTSD: A review of the empirical literature. Clinical Psychology Review, 28(8), 1041–1065.&lt;/ref&gt; Such processing of emotion can alter an individuals' ability to accurately assess others' emotions as well. Mothers with violence-related PTSD have been noted to show decreased medial prefrontal cortical activation in response to seeing their own and unfamiliar toddlers in helpless or distressed states of mind that is also associated with maternal PTSD symptom severity, self-reported parenting stress, and difficulty in identifying emotions and which, in turn, impacts sensitive caregiving.&lt;ref&gt;Moser DA, Aue T, Suardi F,  Manini A, Sancho Rossignol A, Cordero MI, Merminod G, Ansermet F, Rusconi Serpa S, Favez N, Schechter DS.

Lederhendler (Eds.), Roots of mental illness in children (pp. 102-111). New York: Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt; while other research has found abused children to demonstrate an attentional avoidance of angry faces.&lt;ref name="Pine, D. S. 2005"/&gt; 
It is believed to be adaptive to attend to angry emotion as this may be a precursor to danger and harm and quick identification of even mild anger cues can facilitate the ability for a child to escape the situation,&lt;ref name="Pollak, S. D. 2003 pp. 102-111"/&gt; however, such biases are considered maladaptive when anger is over-identified in inappropriate contexts and this may result in the development of psychopathology.

==Research methods==
Researchers employ several methods designed to examine biases toward emotional stimuli to determine the salience of particular emotional stimuli, population differences in emotion perception, and also attentional biases toward or away from emotional stimuli. Tasks commonly utilized include the [[Stroop effect|modified Stroop task]], the [[Dot-probe paradigm|dot probe task]], [[Visual search|visual search tasks]], and [[Visual search|spatial cuing tasks]]. 
The Stroop task, or modified Stroop task, displays different types of words (e.g., threatening and neutral) in varying colors. The participant is then asked to identify the color of the word while ignoring the actual semantic content. Increased response time to indicate the color of threat words relative to neutral words suggests an attentional bias toward such threat.&lt;ref&gt;Stroop, J. R. (1935). Studies of interference in serial verbal reactions. Journal of Experimental Psychology, 18, 643−662 (Reprinted in 1992 in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 121, 15–23).&lt;/ref&gt; The Stroop task, however, has some interpretational difficulties&lt;ref&gt;Algom, D., Chajut, E., &amp; Lev, S. (2004). A rational look at the emotional Stroop paradigm: A generic slowdown, not a Stroop effect. Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 133, 323−338.&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to the lack of allowance for the measurement of spatial attention allocation.&lt;ref name="MacLeod1986"&gt;MacLeod, C., Mathews, A., &amp; Tata, P. (1986). Attentional bias in the emotional disorders. Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 95, 15−20.&lt;/ref&gt; To address some of the limitations of the Stroop task, the dot probe task displays two words or pictures on a computer screen (either one at the top or left and the other on the bottom or right, respectively) and after a brief stimuli presentation, often less than 1000ms, a probe appears in the location of one of the two stimuli and participants are asked to press a button indicating the location of the probe. Different response times between target (e.g., threat) and neutral stimuli infer attentional biases to the target information with shorter response times for when the probe is in the place of the target stimuli indicating an attention bias for that type of information.&lt;ref name="MacLeod1986"/&gt; In another task that examines spatial attentional allocation, the visual search task asks participants to detect a target stimulus embedded in a matrix of distractors (e.g., an angry face among several neutral or other emotional faces or vice versa). Faster detection times to find emotional stimuli among neutral stimuli or slower detection times to find neutral stimuli among emotional distractors infer an attentional bias for such stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;Öhman, A., Flykt, A., &amp; Esteves, F. (2001). Emotion drives attention: Detecting the snake in the grass. Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 130, 466−478.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rinck, M., Becker, E. S., Kellermann, J., &amp; Roth, W. T. (2003). Selective attention in anxiety: Distraction and enhancement in visual search. Depression and Anxiety, 18, 18−28.&lt;/ref&gt; The spatial cuing task asks participants to focus on a point located between two rectangles at which point a cue is presented, either in the form of one of the rectangles lighting up or some emotional stimuli appearing within one of the rectangles and this cue either directs attention toward or away from the actual location of the target stimuli. Participants then press a button indicating the location of the target stimuli with faster response times indicating an attention bias toward such stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, E., Russo, R., Bowles, R., &amp; Dutton, K. (2001). Do threatening stimuli draw or hold visual attention in subclinical anxiety? Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 130, 681−700.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Posner, M. I. (1980).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2718">In [[mathematics]], an '''exponentially closed field''' is an [[ordered field]] of &lt;math&gt;F\,&lt;/math&gt; which has an order preserving [[isomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;E\,&lt;/math&gt; of the additive group of  &lt;math&gt;F\,&lt;/math&gt; onto the multiplicative group of positive elements of &lt;math&gt;F\,&lt;/math&gt; such that 
&lt;math&gt;1+1/n&lt;E(1)&lt;n\,&lt;/math&gt; for some natural number &lt;math&gt;n\,&lt;/math&gt;.

Isomorphism &lt;math&gt;E\,&lt;/math&gt; is called an exponential function in &lt;math&gt;F\,&lt;/math&gt;.

==Examples==
* The canonical example for an exponentially closed field is the ordered field of real numbers; here &lt;math&gt;E\,&lt;/math&gt; can be any function &lt;math&gt; a^x\,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;1&lt; a\in F&lt;/math&gt;. 

==Properties==
* Every exponentially closed field &lt;math&gt;F\,&lt;/math&gt; is ''root-closed'', i.e., every positive element of &lt;math&gt;F\,&lt;/math&gt; has an &lt;math&gt;n\,&lt;/math&gt;-th root for all positive integer &lt;math&gt;n\,&lt;/math&gt; (or in other words the  multiplicative group of positive elements of &lt;math&gt;F\,&lt;/math&gt; is [[Divisible group|divisible]]). This is so because &lt;math&gt;E\left(\frac{1}{n}E^{-1}(a)\right)^n=E(E^{-1}(a))=a&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;a&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. 
* Consequently, every exponentially closed field is an [[Euclidean field]]. 
* Consequently, every exponentially closed field is an ordered [[Pythagorean field]].
* Not every [[real-closed field]] is an exponentially closed field, e.g., the field of real [[algebraic number]]s is not exponentially closed.  This is so because &lt;math&gt;E\,&lt;/math&gt; has to be &lt;math&gt;E(x)=a^x\,&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt; 1&lt;a\in F\,&lt;/math&gt; in every exponentially closed subfield &lt;math&gt;F\,&lt;/math&gt; of the real numbers; and &lt;math&gt;E(\sqrt{2})=a^\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; is not algebraic if  &lt;math&gt; 1&lt;a\,&lt;/math&gt; is algebraic by [[Gelfond–Schneider theorem]].
* Consequently, the class of exponentially closed fields is not an [[elementary class]] since the field of real numbers and the field of  real algebraic numbers are [[elementarily equivalent]] structures. 
* The class of exponentially closed fields is a [[pseudoelementary class]]. This is so since a field &lt;math&gt;F\,&lt;/math&gt; is  exponentially closed iff there is a surjective function &lt;math&gt;E_2:F\rightarrow F^+&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;E_2(x+y)=E_2(x)E_2(y)\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_2(1)=2&lt;/math&gt;; and these properties of &lt;math&gt;E_2\,&lt;/math&gt; are axiomatizable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10277">In [[evolutionary biology]], the '''flying primate hypothesis''' posits that [[megabat]]s, a subgroup of [[Chiroptera]] (also known as [[Pteropus|flying fox]]es), form an evolutionary [[sister group]] of [[primate]]s. The [[hypothesis]] began with [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1758, and was again advanced by J.D. Smith in 1980.&lt;ref name="pmid18367343"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pettigrew JD, Maseko BC, Manger PR |title=Primate-like retinotectal decussation in an echolocating megabat, ''Rousettus aegyptiacus'' |journal=Neuroscience |volume=153 |issue=1 |pages=226–31 |date=April 2008 |pmid=18367343 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroscience.2008.02.019 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Smith JD (1980) Chiropteran phylogenetics: introduction.

This was followed up by a longer study published in 1989,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pettigrew JD, Jamieson BG, Robson SK, Hall LS, McAnally KI, Cooper HM |year=1989 |title=Phylogenetic relations between microbats, megabats and primates (Mammalia: Chiroptera and Primates) |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences |volume=325 |pages=489–559 |doi=10.1098/rstb.1989.0102|issue=1229}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which this was supported by the analysis of many other [[brain]] and body characteristics. Pettigrew suggested that flying foxes, [[colugo]]s, and primates were all descendants of the same group of early [[arboreal]] mammals. The megabat flight and the colugo [[Gliding flight|gliding]] could be both seen as locomotory adaptations to a life high above the ground.

The flying primate hypothesis met resistance from many zoologists. Its biggest challenges were not centered on the argument that megabats and primates are evolutionarily related, which reflects earlier ideas (such as the grouping of primates, [[tree shrew]]s, colugos, and [[bat]]s under the same [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] group, the [[Superorder]] [[Archonta]]). Rather, many biologists resisted the implication that megabats and [[microbat]]s (or [[animal echolocation#Bats|echolocating]] bats) formed distinct branches of mammalian [[evolution]], with flight having [[convergent evolution|evolved twice]]. This implication was borne out of the fact that microbats do not resemble primates in any of the neural characteristics studied by Pettigrew, instead resembling primitive mammals such as [[Insectivora]] in these respects. The advanced brain characters demonstrated in ''Pteropus'' could not, therefore, be generalized to imply that all bats are similar to primates.

More recently, the flying primate hypothesis was rejected when scientists compared the DNA of bats to that of primates. These genetic studies support the [[monophyly]] of bats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1073/pnas.111551998 |date=May 2001 |author1=Springer, Ms |author2=Teeling, Ec |author3=Madsen, O |author4=Stanhope, Mj |author5=De, Jong, Ww | title=Integrated fossil and molecular data reconstruct bat echolocation | volume=98 | issue=11 | pages=6241–6 | pmid=11353869 | pmc=33452 | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11353869 | format=Free full text}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Primitive Early Eocene bat from Wyoming and the evolution of flight and echolocation | doi=10.1038/nature06549 | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v451/n7180/abs/nature06549.html | accessdate=2008-07-03 | date=2008-02-14 | work=Nature | volume=451 | issue=7180 | pages=818–821}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1126/science.1105113 |date=January 2005 |author1=Teeling, Ec |author2=Springer, Ms |author3=Madsen, O |author4=Bates, P |author5=O'Brien, Sj |author6=Murphy, Wj | title=A molecular phylogeny for bats illuminates biogeography and the fossil record | volume=307 | issue=5709 | pages=580–4 | pmid=15681385 | journal=Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=September 2005 |author1=Eick, Gn |author2=Jacobs, Ds |author3=Matthee, Ca | title=A nuclear DNA phylogenetic perspective on the evolution of echolocation and historical biogeography of extant bats (chiroptera) | volume=22 | issue=9 | pages=1869–86 | pmid=15930153 | journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution | url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15930153 | format=Free full text | doi=10.1093/molbev/msi180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neurological studies==
Soon after Pettigrew's study, work on another genus of megabat (''[[Rousettus]]'') disputed the existence of an advanced pattern of connections between the [[retina]] and the [[superior colliculus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Thiele A, Vogelsang M, Hoffmann KP |year=1991 |title=Pattern of retinotectal projection in the megachiropteran bat ''Rousettus aegyptiacus'' |journal= Journal of Comparative Neurology |doi=10.1002/cne.903140404 |volume=314 |pages=671–683 | pmid=1816270 | issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this conclusion was later criticised on methodological grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rosa MG, Schmid LM |year=1994 |title=Topography and extent of visual-field representation in the superior colliculus of the megachiropteran Pteropus |journal=Visual Neuroscience |volume=11 |issue=6 |pages=1037–1057 | doi=10.1017/S0952523800006878 | pmid=7841115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later studies have sought further evidence of unique characteristics linking the megabat and primate brains. These studies have had limited success in identifying unique links between megabats and present-day primates, instead concluding that the megabat brain has characteristics that may resemble those likely to have existed in primitive primate brains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ichida JM, Rosa MG, Casagrande VA |year=2000 |title=Does the visual system of the flying fox resemble that of primates?

==Biochemical studies==
The implication that bats are [[diphyletic]] has been fiercely disputed by many zoologists, not only based on the unlikelihood that [[wing]]s would have evolved twice in mammals, but also on biochemical studies of molecular evolution, which indicate that bats are [[monophyletic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mindell DP, Dick CW, Baker RJ |year=1991 |title=Phylogenetic relationships among megabats, microbats, and primates |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA |volume=88 |issue=22 |pages=10322–10326 |doi=10.1073/pnas.88.22.10322 | pmid = 1658803 | pmc = 52920}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Stanhope MJ, Czelusniak J, Si JS, Nickerson J, Goodman M |year=1992 | title=A molecular perspective on mammalian evolution from the gene encoding interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein, with convincing evidence for bat monophyly |journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=148–60| doi=10.1016/1055-7903(92)90026-D | pmid=1342928}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other studies have disputed the validity of these conclusions. In particular, it has been argued that [[phylogenies]] based solely on DNA data can be subject to an artifact named the "base-compositional bias" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hutcheon JM, Kirsch JA, Pettigrew JD | year=1998 |title=Base-compositional biases and the bat problem.

A '''frame story''' (also known as a '''frame tale''' or '''frame narrative''') is a [[literary technique]] that sometimes serves as a companion piece to a [[story within a story]], whereby an introductory or main narrative is presented, at least in part, for the purpose of setting the stage either for a more emphasized second narrative or for a set of shorter stories. The frame story leads readers from a first story into another, smaller one (or several ones) within it. The frame story may also be used to allow readers to understand a part of the story, then jump to another part that can now be understood. This is not however, to be mixed up with a narrative structure or character personality change.

== Origins ==
Some of the earliest known frame stories are those from ancient Egypt, including one found in the [[Papyrus Westcar]], the ''[[Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor]]'', and ''[[The Eloquent Peasant]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=312|editor=[[John Clute]] and [[John Grant (author)|John Grant]]|title=[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]|year=1999|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9780312198695}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Orality and Literacy in the Demotic Tales|page=27-32, 211-212|last1=Jay|first1=Jacqueline E.|publisher=Brill|year=2016|isbn=9789004323070}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other early examples are from [[Indian literature]], including the [[Indian epic poetry|Sanskrit epics]] ''[[Mahabharata]]'', ''[[Ramayana]]'', ''[[Panchatantra]]'', [[Syntipas]]'s ''[[Seven Wise Masters|The Seven Wise Masters]]'', and the [[fable]] collections ''[[Hitopadesha]]'' and ''[[Baital Pachisi|Vikram and The Vampire]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Michael E. J. Witzel |first=Michael E. J. |last=Witzel |chapter=On the origin of the literary device of the 'Frame Story' in Old Indian literature |title=Hinduismus und Buddhismus, Festschrift für U. Schneider |editor-first=H. |editor-last=Falk |location=Freiburg |year=1987 |pages=380–414 |isbn=3-925270-01-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This form gradually spread west through the centuries and became popular, giving rise to such classic frame tale collections as the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' (''Arabian Nights''), ''[[The Decameron]]'', and ''[[Canterbury Tales]]''.  This format had flexibility in that various narrators could retain the stories they liked or understood, while dropping ones they didn't and adding new ones they heard from other places.  This occurred particularly with ''One Thousand and One Nights'', where different versions over the centuries have included different stories.

The use of a frame story in which a single narrative is set in the context of the telling of a story is also a technique with a long history, dating back at least to the beginning section of the ''[[Odyssey]]'', in which the narrator [[Odysseus]] tells of his wandering in the court of King [[Alcinous]].

== A set of stories ==

This [[literary device]] acts as a convenient [[conceit]] for the organization of a set of smaller narratives, which are either of the devising of the author or taken from a previous stock of popular tales, slightly altered by the author for the purpose of the longer narrative. Sometimes a story within the main narrative can be used to sum up or encapsulate some aspect of the framing story, in which case it is referred to in literary criticism by the French term ''[[mise en abyme]]''.

A typical example of a frame story is ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', in which the character [[Shahrazad]] narrates a set of [[fairy tale]]s to the Sultan [[List of One Thousand and One Nights characters#Shahryār|Shahriyar]] over many nights. Many of Shahrazad's tales are also frame stories, such as ''[[Sindbad the Sailor|Tale of Sindbad the Seaman and Sindbad the Landsman]]'', a collection of adventures related by Sindbad the Seaman to Sindbad the Landsman.

Extensive use of this device is found in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'', where the stories nest several deep, to allow the inclusion of many different tales in one work. [[Emily Brontë]]'s ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'' uses this literary device to tell the story of Heathcliff and Catherine, along with the subplots. Her sister [[Anne Brontë|Anne]] also uses this device in her [[epistolary novel]] ''[[The Tenant of Wildfell Hall]]''. The main heroine's diary is framed by the narrator's story and letters.

[[Mary Shelley]]'s novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'' is another good example of a book with multiple framed narratives. In the book, Robert Walton writes letters to his sister describing the story told to him by [[Victor Frankenstein]]; Frankenstein's story contains the creature's story; the [[Frankenstein's monster|creature's]] story even briefly contains the story of a family among whom it had been living.

Frame stories have also appeared in other media, such as [[comic book]]s. [[Neil Gaiman]]'s comic book series ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'' featured a story arc called ''Worlds End'' which consisted of frame stories, and sometimes even featured stories within stories within stories.

Frame stories are often organized as a gathering of people in one place for the exchange of stories. Each character tells his or her tale, and the frame tale progresses in that manner. Historically famous frame stories include [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'', about a group of pilgrims who tell stories on their journey to Canterbury; and [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]]'s ''[[The Decameron|Decameron]]'' about a group of young aristocrats escaping the Black Death in the countryside and spending the time telling stories.

[[File:QuidorRipVanWinkle.jpg|thumb|180px|right|''The Return of [[Rip Van Winkle]]'', painting by [[John Quidor]], 1849]]
Sometimes only one storyteller exists, and in this case there might be different levels of distance between the reader and author. In this mode, the frame tale can become more fuzzy. In [[Washington Irving]]'s ''Sketch Book'', which contains "[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]" and "[[Rip Van Winkle]]" among others, the conceit is that the author of the book is not Irving, but a certain gentleman named Crayon. Here the frame includes the world of the imagined Crayon, his stories, and the possible{{clarify|date=June 2016}} reader who is assumed to play along and "know" who Crayon is.

[[Donald Westlake]]'s short story "No Story" is a parody of frame stories, in which a series of narrators start to tell stories, each of which contains a narrator who starts to tell a story, culminating in a narrator who announces that there will be no story. Essentially, it is a frame story without a story to be framed.

== Single story ==

When there is a single story, the frame story is used for other purposes&amp;nbsp;– chiefly to position the reader's attitude toward the tale.  One common one is to draw attention to the [[Unreliable narrator|narrator's unreliability]].  By explicitly making the narrator a character within the frame story, the writer distances him or herself from the narrator; she or he may also characterize the narrator to cast doubt on the narrator's truthfulness. In [[P. G. Wodehouse]]'s stories of [[Mr Mulliner]],  Mulliner is made a [[Fly fishing|fly fisherman]] in order to cast doubt on the outrageous stories he tells.  The movie ''[[Amadeus (film)|Amadeus]]'' is framed as a story an old [[Antonio Salieri]] tells to a young priest, because the movie is based more on stories Salieri told about [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] than on historical fact. 

Another use is a form of [[procatalepsis]], where the writer puts the readers' possible reactions to the story in the characters listening to it.  In  ''[[The Princess Bride]]'' the frame of a grandfather reading the story to his reluctant grandson puts the cynical reaction a viewer might have to the romantic fairytale into the story in the grandson's persona, and helps defuse it.  This is the use when the frame tells a story that lacks a strong [[narrative hook]] in its opening; the narrator can engage the reader's interest by telling the story to answer the curiosity of his listeners, or by warning them that the story began in an ordinary seeming way, but they must follow it to understand later actions, thereby identifying the reader's wondering whether the story is worth reading to the listeners'. Such an approach was used by Edith Wharton in her novella [[Ethan Frome]], in which a nameless narrator hears from many characters in the town of Starkfield about the main character Ethan's story.

A specialized form of the frame is a [[dream vision]], where the narrator claims to have gone to sleep, dreamed the events of the story, and then awoken to tell the tale.  In medieval Europe, this was a common device, used to indicate that the events included are fictional; [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] used it in ''[[The Book of the Duchess]]'', ''[[The House of Fame]]'', ''[[Parlement of Foules]]'', and ''[[The Legend of Good Women]]'' (the last also containing a multi-story frame story within the dream).  In modern usage, it is sometimes used in works of [[fantasy]] as a means toward [[suspension of disbelief]] about the marvels depicted in the story.  [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], in his essay "[[On Fairy-Stories]]" complained of such devices as unwillingness to treat the genre seriously.  [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''Alice'' stories (''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' and ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'') includes such a frame, but unlike most usages, the stories themselves use dream-like logic and sequences; most dream frames frame stories that appear exactly as if occurring in real life. The writer [[John Bunyan]] used a dream device in the Christian allegory [[Pilgrim's Progress]] and its sequel, explaining that they were dreams he had while he was in prison and felt God wanted him to write down. This worked because it made what might have been seen as a fantasy something more realistic and meaningful to others who believed as he did.

Still, even when the story proceeds realistically, the dream frame casts doubt on the events.  In the book, ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'', the events really occur; the dream frame added for [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|the movie]] detracts from the validity of the fantasy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Steven Swann |last=Jones |title=The Fairy Tale: The Magic Mirror of Imagination |publisher=Twayne Publishers |location=New York |year=1995 |isbn=0-8057-0950-9 |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=qkfYAAAAMAAJ |pages=94 }} |page=94 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use ==
As with all [[conceit|literary conceits]], the frame tale has many variations, some clearly within the confines of the conceit, some on the border, and some pushing the boundaries of understanding.  The main goal of a frame tale is as a conceit which can adequately collect otherwise disparate tales. It has been mostly replaced, in modern literature, by the short story collection or anthology absent of any authorial conceit and other rhetorical devices.

To be a frame narrative, the story must act primarily as an occasion for the telling of other stories.  If the framing narrative has primary or equal interest, then it is not usually a frame narrative.  For example, [[Odysseus]] narrates much of the ''[[Odyssey]]'' to the [[Scheria|Phaeacians]], but, even though this recollection forms a great part of the poem, the events after and before the interpolated recollection are of greater interest than the memory.

Another notable example that plays with frame narrative is the 1994 film ''[[Forrest Gump]]''.  Most of the film is narrated by Forrest to various companions on the park bench.  However, in the last fifth or so of the film, Forrest gets up and leaves the bench, and we follow him as he meets with Jenny and her son.  This final segment suddenly has no narrator unlike the rest of the film that came before it, but is instead told through Forrest and Jenny's dialogues.

This approach is also demonstrated in the 2008 film ''[[Slumdog Millionaire]]'' (adapted from the 2005 novel ''[[Q &amp; A (novel)|Q &amp; A]]''), about a poor street kid Jamal coming close to winning ''[[Kaun Banega Crorepati]]'' (the [[India]]n version of ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'') and then being suspected of cheating. Most of the story is narrated at a police station by Jamal, who narrates how he knew the answers to the questions as the show is played back on video. The show itself then serves as another [[framing device]], as Jamal sees [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] of his past as each question is asked. The last portion of the film then unfolds without any narrator.

[[Joseph Conrad]]'s ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' demonstrates a narrator telling a story, while the protagonist is quoted so as to give the framed appearance that he is telling the story. The narrator provides the transition to the one speaking the story.

A famous literary example is Emily Brontë's ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'', whereby we learn events through a visitor to the house of the title, who in turn has been told these events by the housekeeper of the Linton family. None of the main characters ever directly narrates.

Another example is [[David Mitchell (author)|David Mitchell's]] 2004 novel [[Cloud Atlas (novel)|Cloud Atlas]], which is a frame story inside a frame story inside a frame story – and so on.  There are six stories in all, each framed inside the other, forming a [[chiastic structure]] to a [[Catharsis|semi-cathartic]] tale spanning centuries of narrative.

Frame stories are found in many [[role-playing video game]]s, such as the early ''[[Dragon Quest IV]]'', released in 1990. This literary device can also be sparingly used to achieve secondary ends. For instance, the ''[[Shining Force]]'' series of role playing games use narrators within frame stories to implement things like starting, saving and exiting the game without breaking the [[fourth wall]] entirely, or rather by constructing a second fourth wall to shield the player from having to suspend his/her disbelief as much. A similar approach was used in the [[open world]] video game ''[[Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven]]'', where the game's missions are presented as a series of flashbacks narrated by Tommy Angelo, as he confesses his involvement with an [[American Mafia]] family. Another example of frame stories in video games is the game [[Catherine (video game)|Catherine]]. Catherine's first scene is a frame story.

In the game ''[[Bastion (video game)|Bastion]]'', the Kid's actions are narrated by one of the other characters, Rucks, as he tells the Kid's story to another character while the Kid is in the final area. Because Rucks never learns about the Kid's actions explicitly, the narration is mostly anecdotal and primarily serves to fill in background information about each level; however, it also serves to keep the fourth wall intact, as player deaths are portrayed as jokes on the narrator's part. After the player's actions catch up to the story, the narration switches to a more speculative tone, as Rucks no longer knows what the player is doing.

Another example is ''[[Persona 5]]'', which begins ''[[in medias res]]'' and is largely framed around Sae Niijima's interrogation of the protagonist, henceforth referred to by his [[code name]] "Joker" since the character's proper name is player-defined. During the story, Niijima introduces the audience to antagonists the Phantom Thieves have targeted, and whenever a Confidant besides Niijima (who cuts a deal with Joker during the interrogation) or the Velvet Room residents is unlocked, she will press Joker for information on accomplices and skills. Whenever a new party member is introduced, Niijima will press Joker on how he knew them, reacting with horror at the point in the game when her younger sister Makoto becomes a Phantom Thief. Should the player fail to complete a Palace by its deadline, the resulting [[game over]] is framed as a [[truth serum]] [[Drug overdose|overdose]] Joker is suffering from preventing him from recalling events correctly and a mysterious man - heavily implied and later confirmed to be a traitor to the Phantom Thieves - murdering him in cold blood while Niijima leaves to allow him to recover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=[[Persona 5]]|developer=[[Atlus]] |publisher=[[Atlus]], [[Deep Silver]] |date= April 4, 2017|platform= [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation 4]]|level = Police Station|quote = '''Sae Niijima''': ...Is that the entirety of your testimony? *sigh* Do you have no intention of saying anything more? Or is the overdose affecting your memory...? In any case, it seems it'd be a waste of time to speak to you any longer. It's unfortunate. ''[Soon after Niijima has left, a mysterious man holds Joker at gunpoint]''/'''Mysterious Man''': ...Allow me to enlighten you. That trivial righteousness that you've paraded around...? This is how such idiocy ends. ''[shoots Joker in the head, killing him instantly]'' ...Farewell.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, a more minor memory problem caused by the truth serum overdose is used to avoid revealing the traitor's identity too early. The device is dropped once the in-game calendar reaches the day of the interrogation, as the prologue leads into the interrogation and the main conflict is still far from resolved by this date.

== Compared to reprise ==
{{See also|Reprise}}

In musical [[sonata form]] or [[rondo]], a theme occurs at the beginning and end of the work, or returns periodically. This could most simply be a recurrence or restatement of a melody or song. For example, the [[The Beatles|Beatles]] song "[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (song)|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]" works as a framing device for their [[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band|album of the same name]], appearing at the beginning and end of the album. Other albums with similar devices include Paul McCartney &amp; [[Wings (band)|Wings]]' ''[[Band on the Run]]'', the recurring heartbeats in [[Pink Floyd]]'s album ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]''   and ''[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album)|Wish You Were Here]]'' ("[[Shine On You Crazy Diamond]]"), [[Supertramp]]'s ''[[Crime of the Century (album)|Crime of the Century]]'' (the harmonica riff at the beginning of "School" is reprised at the end of the title track), and [[Spirit (band)|Spirit]]'s ''[[Twelve Dreams of Dr. Sardonicus]]'' ("You have the world at your fingertips/No one can make it better than you"). Another is Junior Senior's 'D-D-D-Don't Stop The Beat' album which ends with a reprise of the first notes from the opening track. The closing track of [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]]' ''[[Selling England by the Pound]]'' is a reprise of the opening track "[[Dancing with the Moonlit Knight]]."

A reprise may be expressed in narrative: at the beginning and the end of the movie ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'', [[Clint Eastwood]]'s character shoots the noose to save his partner from hanging.

At the beginning of the 1992 movie ''[[Far and Away]]'', the father "dies" and then returns to life briefly. The same thing happens in ''[[Vanilla Sky]]'' where Tom Cruise's character "dies" and then comes back to life.

Framing devices may also take the form of a recurrent element that appears at the beginning and the end of the narrative. For example, a story may begin with a character visiting a park under one set of circumstances, then returning at the end to the same park under a different set of circumstances, having undergone a change that allows him or her to see the park in a new light.
 
A framing device might also simply be a defining image of the narrative or art that is used at the beginning and end of the work. 

An example of this is in the film ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'' which begins and ends with the characters running along a beach, accompanied at both times by the movie’s famous theme music. This scene, although chronologically occurring in the middle of the film and unimportant to the straightforward plot, serves to convey a defining emotion and tone that sets the context for the main story.

The terms '''genital modification''' and '''genital mutilation''' can refer to permanent or temporary changes to [[human sex organs]]. Some forms of genital alteration are performed on adults with their informed consent at their own behest, usually for aesthetic reasons or to enhance stimulation. However, other forms are performed on people who do not give informed consent, including infants or children. Any of these procedures may be considered modifications or mutilations in different cultural contexts and by different groups of people.

== Reasons ==
=== Body modification ===
{{main|Body modification}}
Many types of genital modification are performed at the behest of the individual, for personal, sexual, aesthetic or cultural reasons. [[Penile subincision]], or splitting of the underside of the penis, is widespread in the traditional cultures of [[Indigenous Australian]]s. This procedure has taken root in Western [[body modification]] culture, the [[modern primitive]]s. [[Meatotomy]] is a form that involves splitting of the [[glans penis]] alone, while bisection is a more extreme form that splits the penis entirely in half.

[[Genital piercing]]s and [[genital tattooing]] may be performed for aesthetic reasons, but piercings have the benefit of increasing [[sexual pleasure]] for the pierced individual or their [[sex partner]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Neluis T., Armstrong M.

Similarly, [[Pearling (body modification)|Pearling]] involves surgical insertion of small, inert spheres under the skin along the shaft of the penis for the purpose of providing sexual stimulation to the walls of the vagina. Similar to tattooing, [[scarification|genital scarification]] is primarily done for aesthetic reasons by adding cosmetic scars to the skin. The genital decoration by scars is an ancient tradition in many cultures, both for men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Angulo J. C., García-Díez M., Martínez M. | year = 2011 | title = Phallic decoration in paleolithic art: genital scarification, piercing and tattoos | url = | journal = The Journal of Urology | volume = 186 | issue = 6| pages = 2498–2503 | doi=10.1016/j.juro.2011.07.077}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hanabira]]-style (Jap. for [[petal]]) is a special form of scarification originating in Japan, it involves the decoration of the [[mons pubis]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.stylight.de/Magazine/Lifestyle/Scarification/ Schnittiger Trend?

[[Clitoris enlargement]] may be achieved temporarily through the use of a [[clitoral pump]], or it may be achieved permanently through the [[Testosterone (medication)|application or injection of testosterone]]. [[Penis enlargement]] is a term for various techniques used to attempt to increase the size of the penis, though the safety and efficacy of these techniques are debated.

===Voluntary sex reassignment===
{{main|Sex reassignment surgery}}
People who are [[transgender]] or [[intersex]] may undergo [[sex reassignment surgery]] in order to modify their bodies to match their [[gender identity]]. Not all transgender people elect to have these surgeries, but those who do usually see an improvement in their sexual lives as well as their mental and emotional well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cuypere G. |author2=T'Sjoen G. |author3=Beerten R. |author4=Selvaggi G. |author5=Sutter P. |author6=Hoebeke P. |author7=Monstrey S. |author8=Vansteenwegen A. |author9=Rubens R. |year=2005 | title = Sexual and physical health after sex reassignment surgery |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 34 | issue = 6| pages = 679–690 | doi = 10.1007/s10508-005-7926-5 | pmid=16362252}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the surgical procedures are [[breast augmentation]] and [[vaginoplasty]] (creation of a vagina) for [[trans women]] and [[mastectomy]] (breast removal), [[metoidioplasty]] (elongation of the clitoris), and [[phalloplasty]] (creation of a penis) for [[trans men]]. Trans women may also benefit from [[hair removal]] and [[facial feminization surgery]], while some trans men may have [[liposuction]] to remove fat deposits around their hips and thighs.

[[Hijra (South Asia)|Hijra]], a [[third gender]] found in the [[Indian subcontinent]], may opt to undergo [[castration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Serena |last=Nanda |title=Neither Man nor Woman: the Hijras of India |year=1999 |publisher=Wadsworth Publishing |place=Belmont, CA |edition=2nd |isbn=9780534509033 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Involuntary sex assignment===
{{Main|Sex assignment|Intersex surgery}}
[[Intersex]] children and children with ambiguous genitalia may be subjected to surgeries to "normalize" the appearance of their genitalia. These surgeries are usually performed for cosmetic benefit rather than for therapeutic reasons. Most surgeries involving children with ambiguous genitalia are sexually damaging and may render them [[infertile]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isna.org/node/97 ISNA's Amicus Brief on Intersex Genital Surgery] [[Intersex Society of North America|The Intersex Society of North America]], Dated February 7, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in cases involving male children with [[micropenis]], doctors may recommend the child be reassigned as female.&lt;ref&gt;Karen S Vogt, MD, Michael J Bourgeois, MD, Arlan L Rosenbloom, MD, Mary L Windle, PharmD, George.

In some cases, a child's gender may be reassigned due to [[genital injury]]. There have been at least seven cases of healthy male infants being reassigned as female due to [[circumcision]] damaging their penises beyond repair,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gearhart JP, Rock JA | year = 1989 | title = Total ablation of the penis after circumcision with electrocautery: a method of management and long-term followup | doi = 10.1016/s0022-5347(17)38893-6 | journal = J Urol | volume = 142 | issue = 3| pages = 799–801 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"David Reimer, 38, Subject of the John/Joan Case" [[New York Times|The New York Times]], New York, USA, Published May 12, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Family Is Awarded $850,000 For Circumcision Accident" [[New York Times|The New York Times]], New York, USA, Published November 2, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Seabrook. $22.8 million in botched circumcision.

In India, [[Andhra Pradesh]] a 75 year old surgeon working at the kurnool government hospital in kadappa named as naganna was arrested by the [[Crime Investigation Department (India)|CB-CID]] for conducting forced sex change surgeries on kidnapped victims for nearly a decade by using a nationwide network of [[hijras]], [[transgenders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=End of the line for sex-change doctor {{!}} Latest News &amp; Updates at Daily News &amp; Analysis|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/bangalore/report-end-of-the-line-for-sex-change-doctor-1246202|work=dna|date=8 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CB-CID instructs probe into begging rackets - Times of India|url=https://m.timesofindia.com/city/chennai/CB-CID-instructs-probe-into-begging-rackets/articleshow/4376912.cms|work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CBCID to seek custody of Kadapa doctor|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/CBCID-to-seek-custody-of-Kadapa-doctor/article16611389.ece|work=The Hindu|date=8 April 2009|language=en-IN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As treatment===
If the genitals become diseased, as in the case of cancer, sometimes the diseased areas are surgically removed. Females may undergo [[vaginectomy]] or [[vulvectomy]] (to the vagina and vulva, respectively), while males may undergo [[penectomy]] or [[orchiectomy]] (removal of the penis and testicles, respectively). [[Reconstructive surgery]] may be performed to restore what was lost, often with techniques similar to those used in [[sex reassignment surgery]].

During [[childbirth]], an [[episiotomy]] (cutting part of the tissue between the vagina and the anus) is sometimes performed to increase the amount of space through which the baby may emerge. Advocates of [[natural childbirth]] and [[unassisted birth]] state that this intervention is often performed without medical necessity, with significant damage to the person giving birth.

[[Hymenotomy]] is the surgical perforation of an [[imperforate hymen]]. It may be performed to allow [[menstruation]] to occur. An adult individual may opt for increasing the size of her hymenal opening, or removal of the hymen altogether, to facilitate [[sexual penetration]] of her vagina.

The world's first penis reduction surgery was performed in 2015, on a 17-year-old boy who had an [[Football (ball)#American and Canadian football|American football]]-shaped penis as a result of recurrent [[priapism]].&lt;ref name="penisreduction"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidkroll/2015/02/18/penis-reduction-surgery-grow-up/#7c6365c42fce|title=Penis Reduction Surgery Is No Laughing Matter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-inflicted===
{{main|Skoptic syndrome|Self-mutilation}}
A person may engage in self-inflicted genital injury or mutilation such as [[castration]], [[penectomy]], or [[clitoridectomy]]. The motivation behind such actions vary widely; it may be done due to [[skoptic syndrome]], personal crisis related to [[gender identity]], [[mental illness]], [[self-mutilation]], [[body dysmorphia]], or social reasons.

{{Main|Female genital mutilation}}
[[Female genital mutilation]] (FGM), also known as female genital cutting (FGC), female circumcision, or female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C), refers to "all procedures involving partial or total removal of the external [[human female genitalia|female genitalia]] or other surgery of the female [[sex organ|genital organs]] whether for cultural, religious or other non-therapeutic reasons."&lt;ref&gt;Definition of the [[World Health Organization]]&lt;/ref&gt; It is not the same as the procedures used in [[Sex reassignment surgery|gender reassignment surgery]] or the [[genital modification]] of [[intersex]] persons. It is practised in several parts of the world, but the practice is concentrated more heavily in Africa, parts of the Middle East, and some other parts of Asia. Over 125 million women and girls have experienced FGM in the 29 countries in which it is concentrated.&lt;ref name=125million&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/media/files/FGCM_Lo_res.pdf UNICEF 2013], p.&amp;nbsp;22: "More than 125 million girls and women alive today have been cut in the 29 countries in Africa and the Middle East where FGM/C is concentrated.&lt;p&gt;

In the past several decades, efforts have been made by global health organizations, such as the WHO, to end the practice. FGM is condemned by international human rights instruments. The [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence|Istanbul Convention]] prohibits FGM (Article 38).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/rms/090000168008482e|title=Full list|website=Treaty Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; FGM is also considered a form a [[violence against women]] by the [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] which was adopted by the [[United Nations]] in 1993; according to which: ''Article Two: Violence against women shall be understood to encompass, but not be limited to, the following: (a) Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family, including [...] '''female genital mutilation''' [...]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un-documents.net/a48r104.htm|title=A/RES/48/104 - Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women - UN Documents: Gathering a body of global agreements|author=United Nations General Assembly|website=www.un-documents.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because of its importance in traditional life, it continues to be practised in many societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=nthWORD Magazine |url=http://www.nthword.com/issue5/Interview_Liz_Canner_Orgasm_Inc.php |title=nthWORD Magazine Interview with Liz Canner, filmmaker of Orgasm, Inc |publisher=Nthword.com |accessdate=2010-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100714011000/http://www.nthword.com/issue5/Interview_Liz_Canner_Orgasm_Inc.php |archivedate=2010-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hymenorrhaphy===
[[Hymenorrhaphy]] refers to the practice of thickening the hymen, or, in some cases, implanting a capsule of red liquid within the newly created vaginal tissue. This new hymen is created to cause physical resistance, blood, or the appearance of blood, at the time that the individual's new husband inserts his penis into her vagina. This is done in cultures where a high value is placed on female [[virginity]] at the time of marriage. In these cultures, a woman may be punished, perhaps violently, if the community leaders deem that she was not virginal at the time of [[consummate|consummation]] of her marriage.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Individuals who are victims of [[rape]], who were virginal at the time of their rape, may elect for hymenorrhaphy.

===Labia stretching===
[[Labia stretching]] is the act of elongating the ''[[labia minora]]'' through manual manipulation (pulling) or physical equipment (such as weights).&lt;ref name=Rwanda&gt;[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/97388.php], "Rwandan Women View The Elongation Of Their Labia As Positive", retrieved on 2008-06-18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=enlargement&gt;[http://www.sexylabia.com/labia-enlargement1.htm], "Enlarging Your Labia", retrieved on 2008-06-22&lt;/ref&gt; It is a familial [[cultural practice]] in Rwanda,&lt;ref name=Rwanda/&gt; common in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]],&lt;ref name=who&gt;[http://www.who.int/reproductive-health/hrp/progress/67.pdf], "Sexual health--a new focus for WHO", page 6, retrieved on 2008-06-19&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[body modification]] practice elsewhere.&lt;ref name=enlargement/&gt; It is performed for sexual enhancement of both partners, aesthetics, symmetry and gratification.&lt;ref name=Rwanda/&gt;&lt;ref name=enlargement/&gt;

===Labiaplasty and vaginoplasty===
[[File:Nach der Entfernung der inneren Schamlippen 1.jpg|thumb|Vulva with ''labia minora'' surgically removed]]

[[Cosmetic surgery]] of female genitalia, known as ''elective genitoplasty'', has become pejoratively known as ''″designer vagina″''. In May 2007, an article published in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' strongly criticised this craze, citing its popularity being rooted in commercial and media influences.&lt;ref name="bb"&gt;{{cite news | last=Bourke |first=Emily | title = Designer vagina craze worries doctors| publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation| date = 2009-11-12| url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/11/12/2741446.htm?site=local| accessdate = 2007-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bmj"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Liao | first = Lih Mei|author2=Sarah M Creighton| title = Requests for cosmetic genitoplasty: how should healthcare providers respond?| journal = BMJ| volume = 334| issue = 7603 | pages = 1090–1092| publisher = [[British Medical Journal]]| date = 2007-05-26| url = http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/extract/334/7603/1090| doi = 10.1136/bmj.39206.422269.BE| accessdate = 2007-05-29| pmid = 17525451 | pmc = 1877941}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar concerns have been expressed in Australia.&lt;ref name="bb"/&gt;

Some women undergo [[vaginoplasty]] or [[labiaplasty]] procedures to alter the shape of their [[vulva]]s to meet personal or societal [[aesthetic]] standards.&lt;ref name="The Perfect Vagina Documentary"&gt;[http://documentarystorm.com/sexuality/the-perfect-vagina/ The Perfect Vagina Documentary] Retrieved {{Nowrap|13 February 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The surgery itself is controversial, and critics refer to the procedures as "designer vagina".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Green Fiona | year = 2005 | title = From clitoridectomies to 'designer vaginas': The medical construction of heteronormative female bodies and sexuality through female genital cutting | url = | journal = Sexualities, Evolution &amp; Gender | volume = 7 | issue = 2| pages = 153–187 | doi=10.1080/14616660500200223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Essen B, Johnsdotter S | year = 2004 | title = Female Genital Mutilation in the West: Traditional Circumcision versus Genital Cosmetic Surgery | url = | journal = Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand | volume = 83 | issue = | pages = 611–613 | doi=10.1111/j.0001-6349.2004.00590.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Braun Virginia | year = 2005 | title = In search of (better) sexual pleasure: female genital 'cosmetic' surgery | url = | journal = Sexualities | volume = 8 | issue = 4| pages = 407–424 | doi=10.1177/1363460705056625}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the article Designer Vaginas by Simone Weil Davis, she talks about the modification of woman's vagina and the outside influences women are pressured with, which can cause them to feel shame towards their [[labia minora]]. She states that the media, such as pornography, creates an unhealthy view of what a "good looking vagina" is and how women feel that their privates are inferior and are therefore pressured to act upon that mindset. These insecurities are forced upon women by their partners and other women as well.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Simone Weil. "Designer Vaginas." Women's Voices, Feminist Visions. Ed. Susan Shaw and Janet Lee. New York: McGraw Hill (2012): 270-77.&lt;/ref&gt; Also leading to a surge of these types of procedures is increased interest in non-surgical genital alterations, such as Brazilian waxing, that make the vagina more visible to judgment. The incentive to participate in labia- and vaginoplasty may also come about in an effort to manage women's physical attributes and their sexual behavior, treating their vagina as something needing to be managed or controlled and ultimately deemed "acceptable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rodrigues Sara | year = 2012 | title = From Vaginal Exception to Exceptional Vagina: The Biopolitics of Female Genital Cosmetic Surgery | doi = 10.1177/1363460712454073 | journal = Sexualities | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 778–94 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clitoral hood reduction ===
[[File:Clitoral hood reduction in adult caucasian female.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Clitoral hood reduction]]]]
[[Clitoral hood reduction]] is a form of hoodplasty. When performed with the consent of the adult individual, it can be considered an [[Elective surgery|elective]] [[plastic surgery]] procedure for reducing the size and the area of the [[clitoral hood]] (prepuce) in order to further expose the [[clitoral glans]] of the [[clitoris]]; the therapeutic goal is thought to improve the sexual functioning of the woman, and the aesthetic appeal of her [[vulva]]. The reduction of the clitoral prepuce tissues usually is a sub-ordinate surgery within a [[labiaplasty]] procedure for reducing the [[labia minora]]; and occasionally within a [[vaginoplasty]] procedure. When these procedures are performed on individuals without their consent, they are considered a form of [[female genital mutilation]].

==Males==
{{category see also|Male genital modification}}

===Castration===
{{Main|Castration}}
Castration in the genital modification and mutilation context is the removal of the [[testicles]]. Sometimes the term (meaning "cutting") is also used to refer to penis removal, but that is less common. Castration has been performed in many cultures throughout history, but is now rare. In the 21st century, castration has been reported among slave boys in South Asia. In addition the Czech Republic performs surgical castration on some male sex offenders. It should not be confused with [[chemical castration]].

===Hemi-castration===
The removal of one testicle (sometimes referred to as ''unilateral castration'') is usually done in the modern world only for medical reasons.&lt;!-- I'm pretty sure Ford and Beech refer to an initiation right which includes this --&gt;

===Circumcision===
{{Main|Circumcision|Circumcision controversies|Forced circumcision}}
[[File:Adult circumcision before and after.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Penis before and after circumcision]]
[[File:Global Map of Male Circumcision Prevalence by Country.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Male [[Prevalence of circumcision|circumcision prevalence]] (not [[Rate (mathematics)|rate]]) by country according to the [[World Health Organization]]'s 2007 review of the global trends and determinants of prevalence, safety, and acceptability of circumcision.&lt;ref name="WHO-GTPDSA"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2007/9789241596169_eng.pdf| title = Male circumcision: Global trends and determinants of prevalence, safety and acceptability| accessdate = 2009-03-04| year = 2007| publisher = [[World Health Organization]]|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Circumcision]] is the surgical removal of part or all of the [[foreskin]] from the penis. It is usually performed for [[religious male circumcision|religious]], cultural or medical reasons and leaves some or all of the glans permanently exposed. [[Jews]] and many [[Americans]] typically have their infants circumcised during the [[neonatal]] period, while [[Filipinos]], most Muslims and African tribes such as the [[Maasai people|Maasai]] and [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] circumcise in teenage years or childhood as an initiation into adulthood.

In modern medicine, circumcision may be used as treatment for severe [[phimosis]] or recurrent [[balanitis]]. Advocacy is often centered on [[preventive medicine]], while opposition is often centered on [[human rights]] (particularly the [[bodily integrity]] of the infant when circumcision is performed in the neonatal period) and the potentially harmful side effects of the procedure.&lt;ref name="Svoboda2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Svoboda|first=J.

The [[World Health Organization]] estimates that one-third of the world's men are circumcised;the majority of circumcised male population is located in [[Muslim countries]] and in the [[United States]], although there are various explanations for why the infant circumcision rate in the US is different from comparable countries.&lt;ref name="WHO-GTPDSA"/&gt;  

In 2012 the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] stated that health benefits of non-therapeutic circumcision aren't great enough to recommend it for every newborn, and that the benefits outweigh the risks, so that the procedure may be done for families who choose it.&lt;ref name="AAP2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blank |first1=Susan |last2=Brady |first2=Michael |last3=Buerk |first3=Ellen |last4=Waldemar |first4=Carlo |last5=Diekema |first5=Douglas |last6=Freedman |first6=Andrew |last7=Maxwell |first7=Lynne |last8=Wegner |first8=Steven |date=31 August 2012 |title=Circumcision Policy Statement |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/130/3/585..info |journal=Pediatrics |volume=130 |issue=3 |pages= |publisher=[[American Academy of Pediatrics]] |doi=10.1542/peds.2012-1989 |issn=1098-4275 |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreskin restoration===
{{Main|Foreskin restoration}}
Foreskin restoration is the partial recreation of the [[foreskin]] after its removal by [[circumcision]]. Surgical restoration involves grafting skin taken from the [[scrotum]] onto a portion of the penile shaft. Nonsurgical methods involve [[tissue expansion]] by stretching the penile skin forward over the [[glans penis]] with the aid of [[tension (physics)|tension]]. Nonsurgical restoration is the preferred method as it is less costly and typically yields better results than surgical restoration. A foreskin restoration device may be of help to men pursuing nonsurgical foreskin restoration. While restoration cannot recreate the nerves or tissues lost to circumcision, it can recreate the appearance and some of the function of a natural foreskin.

===Infibulation===
{{Main|Infibulation}}
[[File:Anacreon infibulated.jpg|thumb|The Greek poet [[Anacreon]] (582 BCE – 485 BCE), showing [[kynodesme|''kynodesmē'']]]]
Infibulation literally means to close with a clasp or a pin. The word is used to include [[Surgical suture|suturing]] of the foreskin over the [[glans penis|head of the penis]].

Infibulation is seen in rock art in Southern Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Rock Art Research in Southern Africa 2000–2004|author=Jean-Loïc Le Quellec}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The hunter and his art: A survey of rock art in Southern Africa|author=Jalmar and Ione Rudner|publisher=C. Struick|location=Cape Town|date=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Greek infibulation consisted of piercing the foreskin and applying a gold, silver or bronze ring (''annulus''), a metal clasp (''fibula'') or pin. This was done for aesthetic reasons. The Greeks also used a nonsurgical form of infibulation by wearing a [[kynodesme]].&lt;ref name="Hodges"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Hodges| first = Frederick M.| year = 2001| title = The Ideal Prepuce in Ancient Greece and Rome: Male Genital Aesthetics and Their Relation to Lipodermos, Circumcision, Foreskin Restoration, and the Kynodesme| journal = [[Bulletin of the History of Medicine|The Bulletin of the History of Medicine]]| volume = 75| issue = Fall 2001| pages = 375–405| publisher = [[Johns Hopkins University Press]]| url = http://www.cirp.org/library/history/hodges2/| format = PDF| accessdate = 2018-02-06| doi = 10.1353/bhm.2001.0119| pmid=11568485}} Hodges draws a strong distinction between the kynodesme and infibulation "Tethering the ''akroposthion'' with the ''kynodesme'' is frequently confused with preputial infibulation, which had different objectives and was achieved by surgically piercing the prepuce and using the holes so created for the insertion of a metal clasp (fibula) in order to fasten the prepuce shut."&lt;/ref&gt; Infibulation in Romano-Greek culture is attested as early as Aulus Cornelius Celcus (25 BC-50 AD) and as late as [[Oribasisus]] (325-405 AD).&lt;ref name=" Schultheiss"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=D. Schultheiss |author2=J.J. Mattelaer |author3=F.M. Hodges |date=2003|title=Preputial infibulation: from ancient medicine to modern genital piercing|journal=BJU International|volume=92|issue=7|pages=758–763|doi=10.1046/j.1464-410X.2003.04490.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Victorian era, both in the UK and in the United States, routine infibulation was second only to circumcision in the "war on masturbation" and was used in orphanages and mental institutions, supported by leading physicians.&lt;ref name="Schultheiss" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Darby"&gt;The masturbation taboo and the rise of routine male circumcision: A review of the historiography RRJL Darby - Journal of Social History, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, male infibulation may be performed for personal preferences or as part of [[BDSM]].

===Emasculation===
{{Main|Emasculation}}

Also known as ''total castration'' or ''nullification'', [[emasculation]] is the combination of castration and penectomy.

Due to the high risk of death from bleeding and infection, it was often considered a punishment equivalent to a [[death sentence]]. It was part of the eunuch-making of the [[Chinese court]], and it was widespread in the [[Arab slave trade]]. A castrated slave was worth more, and this offset the losses from death.&lt;ref name="Gordon 1989"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Murray Gordon|title=Slavery in the Arab World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5l81hwFPvzYC|date=1989|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-941533-30-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nullo (body modification)|Nullification]] or "nullo" is the term used by the modern body modification community.

In modern day [[South Asia]], some members of [[Hijra (South Asia)|Hijra]] communities reportedly undergo emasculation. It is called ''nirwaan'' and seen as a [[rite of passage]].&lt;ref&gt;Nanda, S. "Hijras: An Alternative Sex and Gender Role in India (in Herdt, G. (1996) Third Sex, Third Gender: Beyond Sexual Dimorphism in Culture and History. Zone Books.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pearling===
[[File:Ampallang.jpg|thumb|[[Pearling (body modification)|Pearling]]]]
{{Main|Pearling (body modification)}}
Pearling or genital beading is a form of body modification, the practice of permanently inserting small beads made of various materials beneath the skin of the genitals—of the labia, or of the shaft or foreskin of the penis. As well as being an aesthetic practice, this is usually intended to enhance the sexual pleasure of partners during vaginal or anal intercourse.

===Penectomy===
{{Main|Penectomy|Penis removal}}
[[File:partial penectomy.jpg|thumb|left|Male genital area after partial [[penectomy]]]]
Penectomy involves the partial or total amputation of [[human penis|penis]]. Sometimes, the removal of the entire penis was done in conjunction with [[castration]], or incorrectly referred to as castration. Removing the penis was often performed on [[eunuchs]] and high ranking men who would frequently be in contact with women, such as those belonging to a [[harem]]. The [[Hijra (South Asia)|Hijra]] of India may remove their penis as an expression of their [[gender identity]]. In the medical field, removal of the penis may be performed for reasons of [[gangrene]] or [[cancer]]. Penis removal may occur through unintentional genital injury.

In the [[ulwaluko]] circumcision ceremony, which is performed by spear, accidental penectomy is a serious risk.&lt;ref&gt;Rijken, D.J. (2014). [http://www.ulwaluko.co.za/Problems.html Description of the problems accompanying the ritual of Ulwaluko]. Ulwaluko.co.za. Retrieved 2014-03-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Penis removal]] for purposes of assault or revenge is overwhelmingly a female-on-male crime, particularly in [[Thailand]]. [[John and Lorena Bobbitt|Lorena Bobbit]] infamously removed her husband's penis in 1993. In some circumstances it may be possible to reattach the penis.

===Penile subincision===
{{Main|Penile subincision}}
Penile subincision is a form of genital modification involves a [[urethrotomy]] and vertically slitting the underside of the penis from the [[Urinary meatus|meatus]] towards to the base. It is performed by people of many cultures, such as the [[Indigenous Australians]], the [[Arrernte people|Arrente]], the [[Luritja]], the [[Samburu people|Samburu]], the [[Samoans]], and the [[Native Hawaiians]]. It may also be performed for personal preference. Penile subincision may leave a man with an increased risk of [[sexually transmitted diseases]], issues with fertility (due to lack of control over what direction the sperm goes after [[ejaculation]]), and may require a man to sit down while [[urination|urinating]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wiki.bme.com/index.php?title=Meatotomy|title=Meatotomy - BME Encyclopedia|website=wiki.bme.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the surgery is not performed in a hospital or by a licensed medical professional, complications such as infection, [[exsanguination]], or permanent damage are major concerns.

=== Penile superincision ===
{{Main|Dorsal slit}}

A dorsal slit (also known as superincision) is an incision made along the upper length of the foreskin with the intention to expose the [[glans penis]] without removing skin or tissue.

The practice appears to have occurred in Ancient Egypt, though not commonly: 
{{Block quote|A few examples of [[Old Kingdom]] [...] statuary present some adult males — usually priests, functionaries, or low-status workers98—as having undergone a vertical slit on the dorsal aspect of the prepuce, although no flesh has been removed.&lt;ref name="Hodges"/&gt;}}

It may be performed as a part of traditional customs, such as those in the [[Pacific Islands]] and the [[Philippines]]. In the medical field, it may be performed for as an alternative to [[circumcision]] when circumcision is undesired or impractical. It remains a rare surgery and practice overall.

A '''gift basket''', or '''fruit basket''' is typically a [[gift]] delivered to the recipient at their home or workplace. A variety of gift baskets exist: some contain [[fruit]]; while others might contain dry or canned foods such as [[tea]], [[Cracker (food)|crackers]] and [[jam]]; or the basket might include a combination of fruit and dried good items.

{{refimprove section|date=November 2008}}
A '''fruit bouquet''' is a fruit arrangement in the form of [[Flower bouquet|bouquet]]. The fruit is cut in the shape of [[flowers]] and leaves, and is arranged in the container with the help of sticks. A complete arrangement looks like a bouquet of flowers. Typically, a fruit bouquet is delivered to the recipient at their home or workplace.

Often these bouquets will be made to suit the recipients' needs, such as [[diabetic]], [[vegan]], [[vegetarian]], [[gluten intolerance]] or wheat intolerance. Common fruit bouquet items include [[apple]]s, [[Globe artichoke|artichoke]]s, [[avocado]]s, [[banana]]s, [[cheese]]s, [[grape]]s, [[lychee]]s, [[mango]]es, [[Orange (fruit)|orange]]s, [[papaya]]s, [[pineapple]]s, [[pomegranate]]s, [[Strawberry|strawberries]], and [[Chocolate]]s.

The '''Habeas Corpus Act 1679'''  is an [[Act of Parliament]] in England (31 Cha. 2 c. 2) during the reign of [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]].&lt;ref name="BHO001"&gt;{{cite web |title=Charles II, 1679: An Act for the better secureing the Liberty of the Subject and for Prevention of Imprisonments beyond the Seas. |work=Statutes of the Realm: volume 5: 1628–80 (1819)| pages=935–938 |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=47484. |accessdate=6 March 2007 |publisher=British History Online }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was passed by what became known as the [[Habeas Corpus Parliament]] to define and strengthen the ancient prerogative writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'', which required a court to examine the lawfulness of a prisoner's detention and thus prevent unlawful or arbitrary imprisonment.&lt;ref name="BBC20050309" /&gt;

==Earlier and subsequent history==
The Act is often wrongly described as the origin of the writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]''. But the writ of ''habeas corpus'' had existed in various forms in England for at least five centuries before and is thought to have originated in the 12th Century [[Assize of Clarendon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/medieval/assizecl.asp |title= Assize of Clarendon, 1166 |publisher=The Avalon Project |accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was guaranteed, but not created, by [[Magna Carta#Clauses still in force|Magna Carta in 1215]], whose article 39 reads: "No freeman shall be taken or imprisoned or disseised or exiled or in any way destroyed, nor will we go upon him nor will we send upon him except upon the lawful judgement of his peers or the law of the land."&lt;ref name="BBC20050309"&gt;{{cite news |title=A brief history of habeas corpus |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4329839.stm |accessdate=25 October 2014 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=9 March 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act of 1679 followed an earlier [[Habeas Corpus Act 1640|Habeas Corpus Act]] of [[List of Acts of the Parliament of England, 1603–41#1640 (16 Chas. 1)|1640]], which established that the command of the King or the [[Privy Council of England|Privy Council]] was no answer to a petition of ''habeas corpus''. Further Habeas Corpus Acts were passed by the British Parliament in 1803, 1804, [[Habeas Corpus Act 1816|1816]], and 1862, but it is the Act of 1679 which is remembered as one of the most important statutes in English constitutional history. Though amended, it remains on the statute book to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/aep/Cha2/31/2/contents |title=Habeas Corpus Act 1679 |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
In criminal matters other than treason and felonies, the act gave prisoners or third parties acting on their behalf the right to challenge their detention by demanding from the [[Lord Chancellor]], [[Judiciary of England and Wales|Justices of the King's Bench]], and the [[Exchequer of Pleas|Barons of the Exchequer]] of the jurisdiction a judicial review of their imprisonment. The act laid out certain temporal and geographical conditions under which prisoners had to be brought before the courts. Jailors were forbidden to move prisoners from one prison to another or out of the country to evade the writ. In case of disobedience jailers would be punished with severe fines which had to be paid to the prisoner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Acevedo|first1=John Filipe|editor1-last=Miller|editor1-first=Wilbur R.|title=The Social History of Crime and Punishment in America: An Encyclopedia|date=212|publisher=SAGE Publications Ltd.|location=London, United Kingdom|page=729}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Documentary History of Human Rights| editor=Jon. E. Lewis. |place=New York |publisher= Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers|year=2003 |page=267|quote=Habeas Corpus Act (1679). In 1660, the Stuarts re-ascended the throne of England. Old tendencies towards Catholicism and absolutism proved little diminished, however, and a prudently watchful parliament determined to pass an Act enshrining Habeas Corpus. This was an ancient English right that, if a man was imprisoned by a local lord, his friends could request the king to issue a writ commanding the man who "have the body" (''Habeas Corpus'') of the prisoner to bring the prisoner before a magistrate for a proper trial. Under a tyrannous king, such as Charles I, the process could be wilfully ignored. In 1679, Parliament passed the ''Habeas Corpus'' Act against future abuse. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The following are the main provisions: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whereas great delays have been used by sheriffs... to whose custody any of the king’s subjects have been committed for criminal or supposed criminal matters... by other shifts to avoid their yielding obedience to [writs of ''Habeas Corpus''], contrary to their duty and the known laws of the land, whereby many of the king's subjects have been... long detained in prison in such cases where by law they are bailable... &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; II For the prevention whereof and the more speedy relief of all persons imprisoned for any such criminal or supposed criminal matters; be it enacted by the king's most excellent Majesty, by and with the consent of the lords... that whensoever any person or persons shall bring any ''habeas corpus'' directed to any sheriff... that the said officer... shall within three days... bring or cause to be brung the body of the party so committed... before the lord chancellor... unless the commitment of the said party by in any place beyond the distance of twenty miles from the place or places where such court of person is or shall be residing, and if beyond the distance of twenty miles and not above one hundred miles then within the space of ten days of such delivery and not longer...  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; V And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that if any officer or officers... shall neglect or refuse to make the returns aforesaid... [he]shall for the first offence forfeit to the prisoner or party grieved the sum of one hundred pounds...  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; VI ... be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, that no person or persons, which shall be delivered or set at large upon any ''habeas corpus'', shall at any time hereafter again be imprisoned or committed for the same offence ... other than by the legal order and process of such [appropriate] court... &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; X Provided also, and be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that it shall and may be lawful to and for any prisoner and prisoners as aforesaid to move and obtain his or their ''habeas corpus'' as well out of the high court of chancery or court of exchequer as out of the court of king's bench or common pleas...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parliamentary history==
The Act came about because [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury|the Earl of Shaftesbury]] encouraged his friends in the Commons to introduce the Bill where it passed and was then sent up to the House of Lords. Shaftesbury was the leading [[Exclusion Bill|Exclusionist]]—those who wanted to exclude Charles II's brother [[James II of England|James, Duke of York]] from the succession—and the Bill was a part of that struggle as they believed James would rule arbitrarily. The Lords decided to add many [[wrecking amendment]]s to the Bill in an attempt to kill it; the Commons had no choice but to pass the Bill with the Lords' amendments because they learned that the King would soon end the current [[parliamentary session]].

The Bill went back and forth between the [[List of Parliaments of England#Parliaments of Charles II|two Houses]], and then the Lords voted on whether to set up a conference on the Bill. If this motion was defeated the Bill would stay in the Commons and therefore have no chance of being passed. Each side—those voting for and against—appointed a [[Teller (elections)|teller]] who stood on each side of the door through which those Lords who had voted "aye" re-entered the House (the "nays" remained seated). One teller would count them aloud whilst the other teller listened and kept watch to know if the other teller was telling the truth. Shaftesbury's faction had voted for the motion, so they went out and re-entered the House. [[Gilbert Burnet]], one of Shaftesbury's friends, recorded what then happened:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Lord Grey and Lord Norris were named to be the tellers: Lord Norris, being a man subject to vapours, was not at all times attentive to what he was doing: so, a very fat lord coming in, Lord Grey counted him as ''ten'', as a jest at first: but seeing Lord Norris had not observed it, he went on with this misreckoning of ten: so it was reported that they that were for the Bill were in the majority, though indeed it went for the other side: and by this means the Bill passed.&lt;ref name="Powell"&gt;Quoted in J. E. Powell, ''Great Parliamentary Occasions'' 1966: The Queen Anne Press. p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[clerk (position)|clerk]] recorded in the minutes of the Lords that the "ayes" had fifty-seven and the "nays" had fifty-five, a total of 112, but the same minutes also state that only 107 Lords had attended that sitting.&lt;ref name="Powell"/&gt;

The King arrived shortly thereafter and gave [[Royal Assent]] before proroguing Parliament. The Act is now stored in the [[Parliamentary Archives]].

He is considered a leading mind in creative concept development, strategy-building and decision management in the United States and Japan.
 
A self-proclaimed "creative visual thinker" and "diagram-lover", Hamaguchi uses visual models to bring what he calls "[[simplexity]]" and "structured chaos" to the process of brainstorming, helping businesses generate creative ideas and strategies in various industries &amp; businesses.

==Education==
Hamaguchi holds a B.S. in Chemical Engineering from [[Kyoto University]], [[Kyoto]], [[Japan]]

==Professional==
Hamaguchi is acknowledged for the [[BET theory]] of TiO2 ([[titanium dioxide]],) an energy production photocatalyst called the Honda-Fujishima effect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6TFN-3YCN376-8H&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=9962f1e45ebe45b9817d39023cf88d57 Titanium(IV) oxide photocatalyst of ultra-high activity&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamaguchi started his business career with [[Panasonic Corporation]] (former [[Matsushita Electric Works]], Ltd.) in Japan. In 1993, he became one of their first corporate [[decision analysts]], supporting board members and executives with strategic decision making. In 1994, he created the concept of the [[Intranet]] and developed Japan's first corporate [[Intranet]] with [[Toru Takasuka]].

From 1998 to 2001, he served as a strategist at Ziba Design, Inc. in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]] and led award winning projects, including IDEA ([[International Design Excellence Awards]]) gold awarded projects.

While at Ziba, he created the concept of the world's first [[USB flash drive]]. IBM first marketed the drives in North America in 2000, with its product the "DiskOnKey" (manufactured by the Israeli company [[M-Systems]]). In 2002, he helped the start-up of MDRM, an Israeli company developing technology for [[digital rights management]] through [[flash memory]] cards. ([[SanDisk]] acquired MDRM in December 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://investor.sandisk.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=86495&amp;p=irol-newsArticle_Print&amp;ID=658477&amp;highlight= SanDisk Acquires MDRM]&lt;/ref&gt;)

In 2001, Hamaguchi returned to [[Panasonic Electric Works]], Ltd. During his time there he was Director of the New Business Planning Group in Japan and Executive Vice President of Panasonic Electric Works Laboratory of America, Inc. in the U.S.A.

In 2006 he founded [[LUNARR]] Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portlandonfire.com/hideshihamaguchi/ Hideshi Hamaguchi | Portland On Fire&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; with his business partner [[Toru Takasuka]] in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], Oregon, U.S.A.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/portland/stories/2007/10/01/smallb1.html Tracking progress - Portland Business Journal:&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He was COO of [[LUNARR]], Inc.

In 2009 he returned to Ziba Design as Director of Strategy.

In 2012 he became a juror of the [[Red Dot]] Design Award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.red-dot.org/jury2012.html?cHash=878d60c4069b7a8e85cb667839e26bb7&amp;detail=4671]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.red-dot.org/4806.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamaguchi has developed his own theory and methodology (Model Based Approach) for creative concept and strategy building through his experiences in various industries, businesses and technologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.picmet.org/newsletter/tmn.asp?news_ID=314&amp;NL_code=18 Portland International Engineering and Technology Management Center&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Howard W. Dixon''' (August 4, 1915 – July 30, 2007) was a civil rights [[Lawyer|attorney]] in [[Miami]] between 1955 and 1997. During that time, he was considered an activist for the rights of poor people and minorities. He served as General Counsel for the [[NAACP]] in the ‘50s, was a founding Board Member of the [[Florida Civil Liberties Union]]. He was the founding executive director of Legal Service of Greater Miami, a program that grew out of President [[Lyndon Johnson]]’s 1964 War on Poverty. He served as Executive Director from 1966 to 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Ovalle, David. "Enduring legacy of civil rights." Miami Herald. August 8, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; After his retirement as a General Master for the Florida Court System in 1987, he served as a full-time volunteer for the Legal Aid Society of Greater Miami, earning him the John Minor Wisdom Public Service and Professionalism Award for Pro Bono Service by the American Bar Association in 1995.

As Executive Director for Legal Services of Greater Miami, led several U.S. Supreme Court victories, including Agrersinger vs. Hamlin and Fuentes vs. Shevin in 1972. The cases allowed for people to have counsel and hearings in specific situations. In 1990, Dixon was awarded the Florida Supreme Court’s highest honor, the Tobias Simon Pro Bono Award.&lt;ref&gt;Elinor J. Brecher. "Activist for the rights of poor people." Miami Herald. August 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, as an attorney for the Florida Civil Liberties Union, Dixon defended the [[Freedom Riders]] in [[Tallahassee, Florida]]. He established legal precedence in the case regarding emergency appeals from the State to the Federal courts.

'''''I Am a Strange Loop''''' is a 2007 book by [[Douglas Hofstadter]], examining in depth the concept of a ''[[strange loop]]'' to explain the sense of "I". The concept of a ''strange loop'' was originally developed in his 1979 book ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]''.

{{quote|In the end, we are self-perceiving, self-inventing, locked-in mirages that are little miracles of self-reference.|Douglas Hofstadter| ''I Am a Strange Loop'' p.363}}

Hofstadter had previously expressed disappointment with how ''Gödel, Escher, Bach,'' which won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] in 1980 for general nonfiction, was received.  In the preface to its 20th-anniversary edition, Hofstadter laments that the book was perceived as a hodgepodge of neat things with no central theme. He states: "GEB is a very personal attempt to say how it is that animate beings can come out of inanimate matter. What is a self, and how can a self come out of stuff that is as selfless as a stone or a puddle?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Hofstadter seeks to remedy this problem in ''I Am a Strange Loop'' by focusing and expounding on the central message of ''Gödel, Escher, Bach''. He demonstrates how the properties of [[self-referential]] systems, demonstrated most famously in [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]], can be used to describe the unique properties of [[mind]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tal.forum2.org/hofstadter_interview An Interview with Douglas R.

As an exploration of the sense of "I", Hofstadter explores his own life, and those to whom he has been close.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=a-new-journey-into-hofsta A New Journey into Hofstadter's Mind] - book review by George Johnson in ''[[Scientific American]]'', March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite web

'''Identity formation''', also known as '''individuation''', is the development of the distinct personality of an [[individual]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Individuation|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/individuation|accessdate=11 October 2012|author=The Free Dictionary|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; regarded as a persisting [[entity]] (known as [[personal continuity]]) in a particular stage of life in which individual characteristics are possessed and by which a person is recognized or known (such as the establishment of a [[reputation]]). This process defines individuals to others and [[Self (psychology)|themselves]]. Pieces of the person's actual identity include a sense of continuity, a sense of [[uniqueness]] from others, and a sense of [[need for affiliation|affiliation]]. Identity formation leads to a number of issues of [[personal identity]] and an [[Identity (social science)|identity]] where the individual has some sort of comprehension of themselves as a discrete and separate entity. This may be through [[individuation]] whereby the undifferentiated individual tends to become unique, or undergoes stages through which differentiated facets of a person's life tend toward becoming a more indivisible whole.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Identity is often described as finite and consisting of separate and distinct parts (family, cultural, personal, professional, etc.), yet according to Parker J. Palmer, it is an ever-evolving core within where our genetics (biology), culture, loved ones, those we cared for, people who have harmed us and people we have harmed, the deeds done (good and ill) to self and others, experiences lived, and choices made come together to form who we are at this moment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Palmer|first=P. J.|title=The heart of a teacher: Identity and integrity in teaching|year=2008|url=http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/events/afc99/articles/heartof.pdf|accessdate=October 1, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105062059/http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/events/afc99/articles/heartof.pdf|archivedate=January 5, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==
Many theories of development have aspects of identity formation included in them. Two theories stand out in regards to this topic{{Why?|date=August 2017}}: [[Erik Erikson]]'s theory of psychosocial development (specifically the "identity versus role confusion" stage of his theory) and [[James Marcia]]'s identity status theory.

===Erikson===
Erikson's belief is that throughout each person's lifetime, they experience different crises or conflicts. Each of the conflicts arises at a certain point in life and must be successfully resolved for progression to the next of the eight stages. The particular stage relevant to identity formation takes place during adolescence, called "Identity versus Role Confusion."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Identity: Youth and Crisis|last = Erikson|first = Erik H.|publisher = Norton|year = 1968|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Identity versus Role Confusion" stage consists of adolescents trying to figure out who they are in order to form a basic identity that they will build on throughout their life, especially concerning social and occupational identities. They face the complexities of determining one's own identity. Erikson said this crisis is resolved with identity achievement, the point at which an individual has extensively considered various goals and values, accepting some and rejecting others, and understands who they are as a unique person.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Invitation to the Life Span, Second Edition|last = Berger|first = Kathleen Stassen|publisher = Worth Publishers|year = 2014|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once an adolescent has attained identity achievement, they are ready to enter the next stage of Erikson's theory "Intimacy versus Isolation" where they will form strong friendships and a sense of companionship with others. If the "Identity versus Role Confusion" crisis is not solved, an adolescent will face confusion about future plans, particularly their roles in adulthood. Failure to form one's own identity leads to failure to form a shared identity with others, which could lead to instability in many areas as an adult. The identity formation stage of Erik Erikson's theory of psychosocial development is a crucial stage in life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Marcia===
James Marcia created a structural [[interview]] designed to classify adolescents into one of four statuses of identity. The identity statuses are used to describe and pinpoint the progression of an adolescent's identity formation process. In James Marcia's theory, the operational definition of identity is whether an individual has explored various alternatives and made firm commitments to: an [[Job (role)|occupation]], [[religion]], [[sexual orientation]] and a set of [[political]] values.

The four identity statuses in James Marcia's theory are:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Development and validation of egoidentity status|last = Marcia|first = James E.|date = 1966|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|accessdate = |doi = 10.1037/h0023281 |pmid = 5939604|volume=3 |pages=551–558}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Identity Diffusion'' (also known as'' Role Confusion''): This is the opposite of identity achievement. The individual has not yet resolved their identity crisis, failing to commit to any goals or values and establish future life direction. In adolescents, this stage is characterized by disorganized thinking, procrastination, and avoidance of issues and action.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
# ''Identity Foreclosure'': This occurs when teenagers accept traditional values and cultural norms, rather than determining their own values. In other words, the person conforms to an identity without exploration as to what really suits them best. For instance, teenagers might follow the values and roles of their parents or cultural norms. They might also foreclose on a negative identity, the direct opposite of their parent's values or cultural norms.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
# ''Identity Moratorium'': This postpones identity achievement by providing temporary shelter. This status provides opportunities for exploration, either in breadth or in depth. Examples of moratoria common in American society include college or the military.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
# ''Identity Achievement'': This status is attained when the person has solved the identity issues by making commitments to goals, beliefs and values after extensive exploration of different areas.

==Self-concept==
[[Self-concept]] or self-identity is the sum of a being's knowledge and understanding of their self. The self-concept is different from [[self-consciousness]], which is an awareness of one's self. Components of the self-concept include physical, psychological, and social attributes, which can be influenced by the individual's attitudes, habits, beliefs and ideas. These components and attributes can not be condensed to the general concepts of [[self-image]] and [[self-esteem]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} as different types of identity coming together in one person. These types of identity can be broken down into the following.

===Cultural identity===
{{Main|Cultural identity}}

Cultural identity is the (feeling of) identity of a group or culture, or of an individual as far as they are influenced by their belonging to a group or culture. Cultural identity is similar to and has overlaps with, but is not synonymous with, [[identity politics]]. There are modern questions of culture that are transferred into questions of identity. Historical culture also influences individual identity, and as with modern cultural identity, individuals may pick and choose aspects of cultural identity, while rejecting or disowning other associated ideas.

=== Professional identity ===
[[Professional identification|Professional identity]] is the identification with a [[profession]], exhibited by an aligning of [[role]]s, [[Professional responsibility|responsibilities]], [[Value (ethics)|values]], and [[ethical standards]] as accepted by the profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goltz|first=Heather Honoré|last2=Smith|first2=Matthew Lee|date=2014-11-01|title=Forming and Developing Your Professional Identity Easy as PI|url=http://hpp.sagepub.com/content/15/6/785|journal=Health Promotion Practice|language=en|volume=15|issue=6|pages=785–789|doi=10.1177/1524839914541279|issn=1524-8399|pmid=25015568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnic and national identity===
An [[ethnic identity]] is the identification with a certain [[ethnicity]], usually on the basis of a presumed common genealogy or ancestry. Recognition by others as a distinct ethnic group is often a contributing factor to developing this bond of identification. Ethnic groups are also often united by common cultural, behavioral, linguistic, ritualistic, or religious traits.

Processes that result in the emergence of such identification are summarised as ethnogenesis. Various cultural studies and social theory investigate the question of cultural and ethnic identities. Cultural identity remarks upon: place, gender, race, history, nationality, sexual orientation, religious beliefs and ethnicity.

[[National identity]] is an ethical and philosophical concept whereby all humans are divided into groups called nations. Members of a "nation" share a common identity, and usually a common origin, in the sense of ancestry, parentage or descent.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

===Religious identity===
A [[religious identity]] is the set of beliefs and practices generally held by an individual, involving adherence to codified beliefs and rituals and study of ancestral or cultural traditions, writings, history, and mythology, as well as faith and mystic experience. The term "religious identity" refers to the personal practices related to communal faith and to rituals and communication stemming from such conviction.  This identity formation begins with association in the parents' religious contacts, and individuation requires that the person chooses to the same—or different—religious identity than that of their parents.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

===Gender identity===
In sociology, [[gender identity]] describes the gender with which a person identifies (i.e., whether one perceives oneself to be a man, a woman, outside of the gender binary, etc.), but can also be used to refer to the gender that other people attribute to the individual on the basis of what they know from gender role indications (social behavior, clothing, hair style, etc.). Gender identity may be affected by a variety of social structures, including the person's ethnic group, employment status, religion or irreligion, and family.

===Disability identity===
Disability identity refers to the particular disabilities with which an individual identifies. This may be something as obvious as a paraplegic person identifying as such, or something less prominent such as an Deaf person regarding themselves as part of a local, national, or global community of Deaf People Culture.

Disability identity is almost always determined by the particular disabilities that an individual is born with, however it may change later in life if an individual later becomes disabled or when an individual later discovers a previously overlooked disability (particularly applicable to mental disorders), and in some rare cases it may be influenced by exposure to disabled people as with [[BIID]].

==Interpersonal identity development==
[[Interpersonal relationship|Social relation]] can refer to a multitude of social interactions, regulated by social norms, between two or more people, with each having a social position and performing a social role. In sociological hierarchy, [[social relation]] is more advanced than behavior, action, social behavior, social action, social contact and social interaction. Social relations form the basis of concepts such as social organization, social structure, social movement and social system.

Interpersonal identity development is composed of three elements: 
* Categorisation: Labeling others (and ourselves) into categories. (Tajfel &amp; Turner,1986) 
* Identification: Associating others with certain [[Group (sociology)|groups]].
* Comparison: Comparing groups.
Interpersonal identity development allows an individual to question and examine various personality elements, such as ideas, beliefs, and behaviors. The actions or thoughts of others create social influences that change an individual. Examples of social influence can be seen in socialisation and peer pressure. This is the effect of other people on a person's behavior, thinking about one's Self, and subsequent acceptance or rejection of how other people attempt to influence the individual.  Interpersonal identity development occurs during exploratory self-analysis and self-evaluation, ending at various times with the establishment of an easy-to-understand and consolidative sense of self or identity.

===Interaction===
{{main|Hegelian dialectic}}

During the interpersonal identity development an exchange of propositions and counter-propositions occurs, resulting in a qualitative transformation of the individual in the direction of the interaction.  The aim of the interpersonal identity development is to try to resolve the undifferentiated facets of an individual. The individual's existence is undifferentiated but this, upon examination, is found to be indistinguishable from others. Given this, and with other admissions, the individual is led to a contradiction between self and others, thus forcing the withdrawal of the undifferentiated self as a truth. In resolution of this incongruence, the person integrates or rejects the encountered elements.  This process results in a new identity. During each of these exchanges which human beings encounter as they go through life, the person must resolve the exchange and then face future exchanges. The exchanges are recurring, since the changing world constantly presents exchanges between individuals and thus allows individuals to redefine themselves.

===Collective identity===
The term [[collective identity]] is a sense of belonging to a group (the collective) that is so strong that a person who identifies with the group will dedicate their life to the group over individual identity: they will defend the views of the group and assume risks for the group, sometimes as great as loss of life. The cohesiveness of the collective goes beyond community, as the collective suffers the pain of grief from the loss of a member.

===Social support===
Individuals gain a [[social identity]] and [[group identity]] by their affiliation. This is from membership in various groups. These groups include, among various categories,: 
{{Colbegin|colwidth=25em}}
* [[family]] 
* [[ethnic]] 
* [[education]] and [[Job (role)|occupational]] status&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hurd | first1 = E | year = 2010 | title = Confessions of Belonging: My Emotional Journey as a Medical Translator | url = | journal = Qualitative Inquiry | volume = 16 | issue = 10| pages = 783–791 | doi = 10.1177/1077800410383117 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[friendship]] 
* [[dating]]
* [[religion]]
{{colend}}

===Family===
One of the most important affiliations is that  of their family, whether they be biological, extended or even adoptive families.  Each has their own influence on identity through the interaction that takes place between the family members and with the individual person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grotevant | first1 = H. D. | year = 1997 | title = Family processes, identity development, and behavioral outcomes for adopted adolescents | url = | journal = Journal of Adolescent Research | volume = 12 | issue = 1| pages = 139–161 | doi=10.1177/0743554897121008}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Information regarding possible identities of possible selves comes from various contexts that surround adolescents and temporal commitments are tested and practiced in interaction with others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goossens | first1 = L | year = 2008 | title = Dynamics of perceived parenting and identity formation in late adolescence | url = | journal = Journal of Adolescence | volume = 31 | issue = 2| pages = 165–184 | doi = 10.1016/j.adolescence.2007.04.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers and theorists basically state that an individual's identity(more specifically an adolescent's identity) is influenced by the people around them and the environment in which they live. Also if a family does not have integration this seems to help create identity diffusion (this is one of [[James Marcia]]'s 4 identity statuses, meaning that an individual has not made commitments and does not try to make commitments.&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, L. (2008). Adolescence. Boston: McGraw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;)  This is true for both males and females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Willemsen | first1 =  | last2 = Waterman | first2 = K. | year = 1991 | title = EGO IDENTITY STATUS AND FAMILY ENVIRONMENT: A CORRELATIONAL STUDY | url = | journal = Psychological Reports | volume = 69 | issue = | pages = 1203–1212 | doi = 10.2466/pr0.1991.69.3f.1203 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These concepts prove that a family has influence on an individual no matter if the influence be good or bad.

===Peer relationships===
The purpose of this study was to analyze the influence of same-sex friendships in the development of one's identity. This study involved the use of 24 same-sex college student friendship triads, consisting of 12 males and 12 females, with a total of 72 participants. Each triad was required to have known each other for a minimum of six months. A qualitative method was chosen, as it is the most appropriate in assessing development of identity. Semi-structured group interviewers took place, where the students were asked to reflect on stories and experiences with relationship problems. The results showed 5 common responses when assessing these relationship problems. The responses involved joking about the relationship problems, providing support, offering advice, relating others' experiences to their own similar experiences, and providing encouragement. The results concluded that adolescents are actively constructing their identities through common themes of conversation between same-sex friendships, in this case, involving relationship issues. The common themes of conversation that close peers seem to engage in, help to further their identity formation in life.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Elizabeth M. &amp; Korobov, Neill. (2011). Interpersonal Identity Formation in Conversations with Close
Friends About Dating Relationships. "Journal of Adolescence".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences on identity==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}
There is an abundant amount of influences on identity formation. Some of which have already been touched on in other sections of this article. Among the many influences, four influences stand out to be especially important. Those include: [[cognitive]] influences, [[School|scholastic]] influences, [[sociocultural]] influences and [[parenting]] influences.

===Cognitive influences===
Cognitive development influences identity formation. When adolescents are able to think abstractly and reason logically they have an easier time exploring and contemplating possible identities. When an adolescent has advanced cognitive development and maturity they tend to resolve identity issues more so than age mates that are less cognitively developed. When identity issues are solved quicker and better, there is more time and effort put into developing that identity. Having a solid identity earlier is a preferred situation and is one of the first steps in forming the desired life and goals of the individual.

===Scholastic influences===
Adolescents that have a post-secondary education tend to make more concrete goals and stable occupational commitments. So going to college or university can influence identity formation in a productive way. Of course, the opposite can also be true, where identity influences education and academics. The two can influence each other, ultimately forming identity in the process. Education's effect on identity can be beneficial for the individual's identity; the individual will be getting educated on different approaches and paths to take in the process of identity formation. Ultimately scholastics are important for our brains as well as our identities.

===Sociocultural influences===
Sociocultural influences are those of a broader social and historical context. For example, in the past, adolescents would likely just adopt the job, religious beliefs, etc. that was expected of them or that were the same as their parents. In a society like today's, adolescents have more resources to explore identity choices as well as more options for commitments. This influence is becoming less significant due to the growing acceptance of identity options that were once less accepted. Also, more of the identity options from the past are becoming unrecognized and less popular today. The changing sociocultural situation is forcing individuals to develop a unique identity based on their own aspirations. Sociocultural influences are playing a different role identity formation now than they have in the past. However, it still affects identity, just in a different way.

===Parenting influences===
The type of relationship that adolescents have with their parents has a significant role in identity formation. For example, when there is a solid and positive relationship between parent and adolescent they are more likely to feel freedom in exploring identity options for themselves. A study found that for boys and girls, identity formation is positively influenced by parental involvement specifically in the areas of: support, social monitoring and school monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;Sartor, Carolyn E. &amp; Youniss, James. (2002). The relationship between positive parental involvement and identity achievement during adolescence. ''Adolescence, 37, 221-234''.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, when the relationship is not as close and the adolescent fears rejection from the parent, they are more likely to feel less confident in forming a separate identity from their parent(s).{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} These are just examples; of course there are other outcomes possible in adolescent identity formation when examining the parenting as well as the parent-child relationship.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

=== Cyber-socializing and the Internet ===
{{See also|Online identity|Cyberpsychology|Sociology of the Internet}}
The internet is becoming an extension of the expressive dimension of the youth condition. There, youth talk about their lives and concerns, design the content that they make available to others and assess others reactions to it in the form of optimized and electronically mediated social approval. When connected, youth speak of their daily routines and lives. With each post, [[image]] or [[video]] they [[upload]], they have the possibility of asking themselves who they are and to try out profiles differing from those they assume in the ‘real’ world. They thus negotiate their identity and create senses of belonging, putting the acceptance and censure of others to the test, an essential mark of the process of identity construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002475/247577E.pdf|title=Youth and changing realities: Rethinking secondary education in Latin America|last=López|first=Néstor|last2=Opertti|first2=Renato|last3=Vargas Tamez|first3=Carlos|publisher=UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=978-92-31 00204-5|location=|pages=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In business ==
In business, a professional identity is the "persona" of a professional which is designed to accord with and facilitate the attainment of business objectives. A professional identity comes into being when there is a philosophy which is manifest in a distinct corporate culture - the corporate personality. A business professional is a person in a profession with certain types of skills that sometimes requires formal training or education.

The [[career development]] of an individual focuses on how individuals manage their careers within and between organisations and how organisations structure the career progress of their members, and can be tied into succession planning within some organizations.

Within the business realm and many careers is the role of management. Management tasks enhance leadership, by creating an environment where all team members know and assume responsibility for their roles. Employees' self-concept and affiliation are often aligned with their roles in the organization.

''Training'' is a form of identity setting, since it has not only effects on knowledge, but also affects the team member's self-concept. Knowledge, on the other hand, of the position introduces a new path of less effort to the trainee, which prolong the effects of training and promote a stronger self-concept. Other forms of identity setting in an Organization include ''Business Cards'', ''Specific Benefits by Role'', and ''Task Forwarding''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Salvador, José]] (2009). MBA CookBook.&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''intrusive thought''' is an unwelcome involuntary thought, image, or unpleasant idea that may become an [[Fixation (psychology)|obsession]], is upsetting or distressing, and can feel difficult to manage or eliminate.&lt;ref name=OCDAction&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.ocdaction.org.uk/ocdaction/index.asp?id=433 |title= Intrusive thoughts |publisher= [[OCD Action]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928162343/http://www.ocdaction.org.uk/ocdaction/index.asp?id=433 |archivedate= September 28, 2007| accessdate= December 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; When such thoughts are associated with [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] (OCD), [[clinical depression|depression]], [[body dysmorphic disorder]] (BDD), and sometimes [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), the thoughts may become paralyzing, [[anxiety]]-provoking, or persistent.  Intrusive thoughts may also be associated with [[episodic memory]], unwanted worries or memories from OCD,&lt;ref name="Baer5860"&gt;Baer (2001), pp. 58–60&lt;/ref&gt; [[posttraumatic stress disorder]], other [[anxiety disorder]]s, [[eating disorder]]s, or [[psychosis]].&lt;ref name=BrewinIntrusiveImages&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brewin CR, Gregory JD, Lipton M, Burgess N |title=Intrusive images in psychological disorders: characteristics, neural mechanisms, and treatment implications |journal=Psychol Rev |volume=117 |issue=1 |pages=210–32 |date=January 2010 |pmid=20063969 |pmc=2834572 |doi=10.1037/a0018113}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intrusive thoughts, urges, and images are of inappropriate things at inappropriate times, and generally have [[aggression|aggressive]], [[Human sexuality|sexual]], or blasphemous themes.&lt;ref name="Baerxiv"&gt;Baer (2001), p. xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
===General===
Many people experience the type of bad or unwanted thoughts that people with more troubling intrusive thoughts have, but most people can dismiss these thoughts.&lt;ref name=OCDAction/&gt;  For most people, intrusive thoughts are a "fleeting annoyance".&lt;ref name="Baer5"&gt;Baer (2001), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist [[Stanley Rachman]] presented a questionnaire to healthy college students and found that virtually all said they had these thoughts from time to time, including thoughts of sexual violence, sexual punishment, "unnatural" sex acts, painful sexual practices, blasphemous or obscene images, thoughts of harming elderly people or someone close to them, violence against animals or towards children, and impulsive or abusive outbursts or utterances.&lt;ref name="BaerRachman"&gt;As reported in Baer (2001), p. 7: {{cite journal |vauthors=Rachman S, de Silva P |title=Abnormal and normal obsessions |journal=Behav Res Ther |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=233–48 |year=1978 |pmid=718588 | doi = 10.1016/0005-7967(78)90022-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such bad thoughts are universal among humans, and have "almost certainly always been a part of the human condition".&lt;ref&gt;Baer (2001), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

When intrusive thoughts occur with [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] (OCD), patients are less able to ignore the unpleasant thoughts and may pay undue attention to them, causing the thoughts to become more frequent and distressing.&lt;ref name=OCDAction/&gt;  The thoughts may become obsessions which are paralyzing, severe, and constantly present, and can range from thoughts of violence or sex to religious blasphemy.&lt;ref name="Baer5"/&gt;  Distinguishing them from normal intrusive thoughts experienced by many people, the intrusive thoughts associated with OCD may be anxiety provoking, irrepressible, and persistent.&lt;ref name=Colino&gt;Colino, Stacey. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/06/AR2006030601145.html "Scary Thoughts: It's Normal for New Parents to Worry Their Baby May Face Harm. For Some Women, Though, Such Fears Become Overwhelming".] ''[[The Washington Post]]'' (March 7, 2006).  Retrieved on December 30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

How people react to intrusive thoughts may determine whether these thoughts will become severe, turn into obsessions, or require treatment.  Intrusive thoughts can occur with or without compulsions. Carrying out the compulsion reduces the anxiety, but makes the urge to perform the compulsion stronger each time it recurs, reinforcing the intrusive thoughts.&lt;ref name=OCDAction/&gt;  According to Lee Baer, [[thought suppression|suppressing the thoughts]] only makes them stronger, and recognizing that bad thoughts do not signify that one is truly evil is one of the steps to overcoming them.&lt;ref&gt;Baer (2001), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;  There is evidence of the benefit of acceptance as an alternative to suppression of intrusive thoughts.  A study showed that those instructed to suppress intrusive thoughts experienced more distress after suppression, while patients instructed to accept the bad thoughts experienced decreased discomfort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Marcks BA, Woods DW |title=A comparison of thought suppression to an acceptance-based technique in the management of personal intrusive thoughts: a controlled evaluation |journal=Behav Res Ther |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=433–45 |date=April 2005 |pmid=15701355 |doi=10.1016/j.brat.2004.03.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These results may be related to underlying [[cognition|cognitive processes]] involved in OCD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tolin DF, Abramowitz JS, Przeworski A, Foa EB |title=Thought suppression in obsessive-compulsive disorder |journal=Behav Res Ther |volume=40 |issue=11 |pages=1255–74 |date=November 2002 |pmid=12384322|doi= 10.1016/S0005-7967(01)00095-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, accepting the thoughts can be more difficult for persons with OCD.  In the 19th century, OCD was known as "the doubting sickness";&lt;ref name="PenzelGay"&gt;Penzel, Fred. [http://www.homestead.com/westsuffolkpsych/am_i_gay.html "How Do I Know I'm Not Really Gay?"]  Retrieved on January 1, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; the "pathological doubt" that accompanies OCD can make it harder for a person with OCD to distinguish "normal" intrusive thoughts as experienced by most people, causing them to "suffer in silence, feeling too embarrassed or worried that they will be thought crazy".&lt;ref name="PenzelSin"&gt;Penzel, Fred.  [http://www.homestead.com/westsuffolkpsych/Sin.html "Let He Who Is Without Sin": OCD and Religion.] Retrieved on January 1, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The possibility that most patients suffering from intrusive thoughts will ever act on those thoughts is low. Patients who are experiencing intense [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[anxiety]], [[shame]], and upset over these thoughts are different from those who actually act on them.  The history of violent crime is dominated by those who feel no guilt or [[remorse]]; the very fact that someone is tormented by intrusive thoughts and has never acted on them before is an excellent predictor that they will not act upon the thoughts.  Patients who are not troubled or shamed by their thoughts, do not find them distasteful, or who have actually taken action, might need to have more serious conditions such as [[psychosis]] or potentially criminal behaviors ruled out.&lt;ref&gt;Baer (2001), pp. 37–38&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Lee Baer, a patient should be concerned that intrusive thoughts are dangerous if the person does not feel upset by the thoughts, or rather finds them pleasurable; has ever acted on violent or sexual thoughts or urges; hears voices or sees things that others do not see; or feels uncontrollable irresistible anger.&lt;ref&gt;Baer (2001), pp. 43–44&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aggressive thoughts===
Intrusive thoughts may involve violent obsessions about hurting others or themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Baer (2001), pp. 33, 78&lt;/ref&gt; They can be related to [[primarily obsessional obsessive compulsive disorder]]. These thoughts can include harming a child; jumping from a bridge, mountain, or the top of a tall building; urges to jump in front of a train or automobile; and urges to push another in front of a train or automobile.&lt;ref name="Baerxiv"/&gt;  Rachman's survey of healthy college students found that virtually all of them had intrusive thoughts from time to time, including:&lt;ref name="BaerRachman"/&gt;
* causing harm to elderly people
* imagining or wishing harm upon someone close to oneself
* impulses to violently attack, hit, harm or kill a person, small child, or animal
* impulses to shout at or abuse someone, or attack and violently punish someone, or say something rude, inappropriate, nasty, or violent to someone.
These thoughts are part of being human, and need not ruin quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;Baer (2001), p. xv&lt;/ref&gt;  Treatment is available when the thoughts are associated with OCD and become persistent, severe, or distressing.

A variant of aggressive intrusive thoughts is '''''L'appel du vide''''', or '''the call of the void'''. Sufferers of ''L'appel du vide'' generally describe the condition as manifesting in certain situations, normally as a wish or brief desire to jump from a high location.

===Sexual thoughts===
[[sexual obsessions|Sexual obsession]] involve intrusive thoughts or images of "kissing, touching, fondling, [[oral sex]], [[anal sex]], [[sexual intercourse|intercourse]], and [[rape]]" with "strangers, acquaintances, parents, children, family members, friends, coworkers, animals and religious figures", involving "[[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] or [[homosexuality|homosexual]] content" with persons of any age.&lt;ref name="Osgood"/&gt;

Like other unwanted intrusive thoughts or images, everyone has some inappropriate sexual thoughts at times, but people with OCD may attach significance to the unwanted sexual thoughts, generating anxiety and distress.  The doubt that accompanies OCD leads to uncertainty regarding whether one might act on the intrusive thoughts, resulting in self-criticism or loathing.&lt;ref name="Osgood"/&gt;

One of the more common sexual intrusive thoughts occurs when an obsessive person doubts his or her sexual identity.  As in the case of most sexual obsessions, sufferers may feel shame and live in isolation, finding it hard to discuss their fears, doubts, and concerns about their sexual identity.&lt;ref name="PenzelGay"/&gt;

A person experiencing sexual intrusive thoughts may feel shame, "embarrassment, guilt, distress, torment, fear of acting on the thought or perceived impulse, and doubt about whether they have already acted in such a way."  Depression may be a result of the self-loathing that can occur, depending on how much the OCD interferes with daily functioning or causes distress.&lt;ref name="Osgood"/&gt;  Their concern over these thoughts may cause them to scrutinize their bodies to determine if the thoughts result in feelings of arousal.  However, focusing attention of any part of the body can result in feelings in that part of the body, hence doing so may decrease confidence and increase fear about acting on the urges.  Part of treatment of sexual intrusive thoughts involves therapy to help sufferers accept intrusive thoughts and stop trying to reassure themselves by checking their bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Baer (2001), p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; This arousal in the part of the body is due to conditioned physiological responses in the brain, which do not respond to the subject of the sexual intrusive thought but rather to the fact that a sexual thought is occurring at all and thus engage an automatic response (research indicates that the correlation between what the genitalia regard as "sexually relevant" and what the brain regards as "sexually appealing" only correlates 50% of the time in men and 10% of the time in women&lt;ref&gt;Nagoski, E., Come as you are: The surprising new science that will transform your sex life, 2015, Simon and Schuster, pp.193-205&lt;/ref&gt;). This means that an arousal response does not necessarily indicate that the person desires what they are thinking about. However, rational thinking processes attempt to explain this reaction and OCD causes people to attribute false meaning and importance to these physiological reactions in an attempt to make sense of them.&lt;ref&gt;Osgood-Hynes, Deborah. [http://www.raminader.com/PDFs%20Uploaded/OCD%20-%20Thinking%20Bad%20Thoughts.pdf "Thinking Bad Thoughts"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115230001/http://raminader.com/PDFs%20Uploaded/OCD%20-%20Thinking%20Bad%20Thoughts.pdf |date=2011-11-15 }} MGH McLean Institute, Belmont MA.&lt;/ref&gt; Sufferers can also experience heightened anxiety caused by "forbidden" images or simply discussing the matter which can then also cause physiological arousal, such as sweating, increased heart rate and some degree of tumescence or lubrication. This is often misinterpreted by the sufferer as an indication of desire or intent, when it is in fact not.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce, Simone &amp; Ching, Terence &amp; Williams, Monnica. (2017).

Archives of Sexual Behavior. 47. 1-14. 10.1007/s10508-017-1031-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious thoughts===
{{see also|Scrupulosity}}
[[Blasphemy|Blasphemous]] thoughts are a common component of OCD, documented throughout history; notable religious figures such as [[Martin Luther]] and [[Ignatius of Loyola]] were known to be tormented by intrusive, blasphemous or religious thoughts and urges.&lt;ref name="Baer106"&gt;Baer (2001), p.106&lt;/ref&gt;  Martin Luther had urges to curse God and Jesus, and was obsessed with images of "the Devil's behind."&lt;ref name="Baer106"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erickson, Erik H.  ''Young Man Luther: A Study in Psychoanalysis and History''.  New York: W.W. Norton, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;  St. Ignatius had numerous obsessions, including the fear of stepping on pieces of straw forming a cross, fearing that it showed disrespect to Christ.&lt;ref name="Baer106"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ciarrocchi, Joseph W.  "Religion, Scrupulosity, and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder," in Michael A. Jenike, Lee Baer, and William A. MInichiello, eds., ''Obsessive-Compulsive Disorders:  Practical Management'', 3rd ed.  St. Louis: Mosby, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  A study of 50 patients with a primary diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder found that 40% had religious and blasphemous thoughts and doubts—a higher, but not statistically significantly different number than the 38% who had the obsessional thoughts related to dirt and contamination more commonly associated with OCD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shooka A, al-Haddad MK, Raees A |title=OCD in Bahrain: a phenomenological profile |journal=Int J Soc Psychiatry |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=147–54 |year=1998 |pmid=9675634 |doi= 10.1177/002076409804400207}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One study suggests that content of intrusive thoughts may vary depending on culture, and that blasphemous thoughts may be more common in men than in women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ghassemzadeh H, Mojtabai R, Khamseh A, Ebrahimkhani N, Issazadegan AA, Saif-Nobakht Z |title=Symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder in a sample of Iranian patients |journal=Int J Soc Psychiatry |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=20–8 |date=March 2002 |pmid=12008904 |doi= 10.1177/002076402128783055 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Fred Penzel, a New York psychologist, some common religious obsessions and intrusive thoughts are:&lt;ref name="PenzelSin"/&gt;
* sexual thoughts about God, saints, and religious figures
* bad thoughts or images during prayer or meditation
* thoughts of being [[demonic possession|possessed]]
* fears of sinning or breaking a religious law or performing a ritual incorrectly
* fears of omitting prayers or reciting them incorrectly
* repetitive and intrusive blasphemous thoughts
* urges or impulses to say blasphemous words or commit blasphemous acts during religious services.

Suffering can be greater and treatment complicated when intrusive thoughts involve religious implications;&lt;ref name="Baer106"/&gt; patients may believe the thoughts are inspired by Satan,&lt;ref&gt;Baer (2001), p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; and may fear  punishment from God or have magnified shame because they perceive themselves as sinful.&lt;ref&gt;Baer (2001), p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;  Symptoms can be more distressing for sufferers with strong religious convictions or beliefs.&lt;ref name="PenzelSin"/&gt;

Baer believes that blasphemous thoughts are more common in [[Catholicism|Catholics]] and [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[Protestantism|Protestants]] than in other religions, whereas [[Muslim]]s tend to comply with the laws and rituals of their faith, and performing the rituals perfectly.&lt;ref&gt;Baer (2001), pp. 111–112&lt;/ref&gt;  He hypothesizes that this is because what is considered inappropriate varies among cultures and religions, and intrusive thoughts torment their sufferers with whatever is considered most inappropriate in the surrounding culture.&lt;ref&gt;Baer (2001), p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

==Associated conditions==
Intrusive thoughts are associated with OCD or [[obsessive-compulsive personality disorder]],&lt;ref&gt;Baer (2001), p. 40, 57&lt;/ref&gt; but may also occur with other conditions&lt;ref name=BrewinIntrusiveImages/&gt; such as [[post-traumatic stress disorder]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Michael T, Halligan SL, Clark DM, Ehlers A |title=Rumination in posttraumatic stress disorder |journal=Depress Anxiety |volume=24 |issue=5 |pages=307–17 |year=2007 |pmid=17041914 |doi=10.1002/da.20228 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[clinical depression]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Christopher G, MacDonald J |title=The impact of clinical depression on working memory |journal=Cogn Neuropsychiatry |volume=10 |issue=5 |pages=379–99 |date=November 2005 |pmid=16571468 |doi=10.1080/13546800444000128}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[postpartum depression]],&lt;ref name=Colino/&gt; and [[anxiety]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Antoni MH, Wimberly SR, Lechner SC, etal |title=Reduction of cancer-specific thought intrusions and anxiety symptoms with a stress management intervention among women undergoing treatment for breast cancer |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=163 |issue=10 |pages=1791–7 |date=October 2006 |pmid=17012691 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.163.10.1791}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Compas BE, Beckjord E, Agocha B, etal |title=Measurement of coping and stress responses in women with breast cancer |journal=Psychooncology |volume=15 |issue=12 |pages=1038–54 |date=December 2006 |pmid=17009343 |doi=10.1002/pon.999}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of these conditions&lt;ref&gt;Baer also mentions [[Tourette syndrome]] (TS), but notes that it is the combination of [[comorbid]] OCD—when present—and [[tic]]s that accounts for the intrusive, obsessive thoughts.  People with tic-related OCD (OCD plus tics) are more likely to have violent or sexual obsessions. {{cite journal  |vauthors=Leckman JF, Grice DE, Barr LC, etal |title=Tic-related vs. non-tic-related obsessive compulsive disorder |journal=Anxiety |volume=1 |issue=5 |pages=208–15 |year=1994 |pmid=9160576}}&lt;/ref&gt; is almost always present in people whose intrusive thoughts reach a clinical level of severity.&lt;ref&gt;Baer (2001), p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;  A large study published in 2005 found that aggressive, sexual, and religious obsessions were broadly associated with [[comorbid]] [[anxiety disorder]]s and depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Hasler G, LaSalle-Ricci VH, Ronquillo JG, etal |title=Obsessive-compulsive disorder symptom dimensions show specific relationships to psychiatric comorbidity |journal=Psychiatry Res |volume=135 |issue=2 |pages=121–32 |date=June 2005 |pmid=15893825 |doi=10.1016/j.psychres.2005.03.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The intrusive thoughts that occur in a [[schizophrenia|schizophrenic episode]] differ from the obsessional thoughts that occur with OCD or depression in that the intrusive thoughts of schizophrenics are false or [[delusion]]al beliefs (i.e. held by the schizophrenic individual to be real and not doubted, as is typically the case with intrusive thoughts) .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Waters FA, Badcock JC, Michie PT, Maybery MT |title=Auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia: intrusive thoughts and forgotten memories |journal=Cogn Neuropsychiatry |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=65–83 |date=January 2006 |pmid=16537234 |doi=10.1080/13546800444000191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-traumatic stress disorder===
The key difference between OCD and [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) is that the intrusive thoughts of PTSD sufferers are of traumatic events that actually happened to them, whereas OCD sufferers have thoughts of imagined catastrophes.  PTSD patients with intrusive thoughts have to sort out violent, sexual, or blasphemous thoughts from memories of traumatic experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Baer (2001), pp. 62–64&lt;/ref&gt;  When patients with intrusive thoughts do not respond to treatment, physicians may suspect past physical, emotional, or sexual abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Baer (2001), p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

===Depression===
People who are clinically depressed may experience intrusive thoughts more intensely, and view them as evidence that they are worthless or sinful people.  The [[Suicidal ideation|suicidal thoughts]] that are common in depression must be distinguished from intrusive thoughts, because suicidal thoughts—unlike harmless sexual, aggressive, or religious thoughts—can be dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;Baer (2001), pp. 51–53&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postpartum depression and OCD===
Unwanted thoughts by mothers about harming  infants are common in [[postpartum depression]].&lt;ref&gt;Baer (2001), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;  A 1999 study of 65 women with postpartum major depression by Katherine Wisner ''et al.'' found the most frequent aggressive thought for women with postpartum depression was causing harm to their newborn infants.&lt;ref name=Wisner&gt;As reported in Baer (2001), pp. 20–23, 139–40: {{cite journal |vauthors=Wisner KL, Peindl KS, Gigliotti T, Hanusa BH |title=Obsessions and compulsions in women with postpartum depression |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=176–80 |date=March 1999 |pmid=10192593 |doi= 10.4088/JCP.v60n0305}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A study of 85 new parents found that 89% experienced intrusive images, for example, of the baby suffocating, having an accident, being harmed, or being kidnapped.&lt;ref name=Colino/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Abramowitz JS, Khandker M, Nelson CA, Deacon BJ, Rygwall R |title=The role of cognitive factors in the pathogenesis of obsessive-compulsive symptoms: a prospective study |journal=Behav Res Ther |volume=44 |issue=9 |pages=1361–74 |date=September 2006 |pmid=16352291 |doi=10.1016/j.brat.2005.09.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some women may develop symptoms of OCD during pregnancy or the postpartum period.&lt;ref name=Colino/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Arnold LM |title=A Case Series of Women With Postpartum-Onset Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder |journal=Prim Care Companion J Clin Psychiatry |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=103–108 |date=August 1999 |pmid=15014682 |pmc=181073 |doi= 10.4088/PCC.v01n0402}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postpartum OCD occurs mainly in women who may already have OCD, perhaps in a mild or undiagnosed form.  Postpartum depression and OCD may be [[comorbid]] (often occurring together). And though physicians may focus more on the depressive symptoms, one study found that obsessive thoughts did accompany postpartum depression in 57% of new mothers.&lt;ref name=Colino/&gt;

Wisner found common obsessions about harming babies in mothers experiencing postpartum depression include images of the baby lying dead in a casket or being eaten by sharks; stabbing the baby; throwing the baby down the stairs; or drowning or burning the baby (as by submerging it in the bathtub in the former case or throwing it in the fire or putting it in the microwave in the latter).&lt;ref name=Wisner/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baer (2001), p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;  Baer estimates that up to 200,000 new mothers with postpartum depression each year may develop these obsessional thoughts about their babies;&lt;ref&gt;Baer (2001), p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; and because they may be reluctant to share these thoughts with a physician or family member, or suffer in silence and fear they are "crazy", their depression can worsen.&lt;ref&gt;Baer (2001), p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

Intrusive fears of harming immediate children can last longer than the postpartum period.  A study of 100 clinically depressed women found that 41% had obsessive fears that they might harm their child, and some were afraid to care for their children.  Among non-depressed mothers, the study found 7% had thoughts of harming their child&lt;ref&gt;As reported in Baer (2001), p. 51:  {{cite journal |vauthors=Jennings KD, Ross S, Popper S, Elmore M |title=Thoughts of harming infants in depressed and nondepressed mothers |journal=J Affect Disord |volume=54 |issue=1–2 |pages=21–8 |date=July 1999 |pmid=10403143 |doi= 10.1016/S0165-0327(98)00185-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;—a rate that yields an additional 280,000 non-depressed mothers in the United States with intrusive thoughts about harming their children.&lt;ref&gt;Baer (2001), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Treatment for intrusive thoughts is similar to treatment for OCD.  [[Exposure therapy|Exposure and response prevention therapy]]—also referred to as habituation or [[Systematic desensitization|desensitization]]—is useful in treating intrusive thoughts.&lt;ref name="Osgood"/&gt;  Mild cases can also be treated with [[cognitive behavioral therapy]], which helps patients identify and manage the unwanted thoughts.&lt;ref name=Colino/&gt;

===Exposure therapy===
Exposure therapy is the treatment of choice for intrusive thoughts.&lt;ref name="Baer91"&gt;Baer (2001), p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; According to Deborah Osgood-Hynes, Psy.D. Director of Psychological Services and Training at the MGH/McLean OCD Institute, "In order to reduce a fear, you have to face a fear. This is true of all types of anxiety and fear reactions, not just OCD." Because it is uncomfortable to experience bad thoughts and urges, shame, doubt or fear, the initial reaction is usually to do something to make the feelings diminish.  By engaging in a ritual or compulsion to diminish the anxiety or bad feeling, the action is strengthened via a process called negative reinforcement—the mind learns that the way to avoid the bad feeling is by engaging in a ritual or compulsions.  When OCD becomes severe, this leads to more interference in life and continues the frequency and severity of the thoughts the person sought to avoid.&lt;ref name="Osgood"/&gt;

Exposure therapy (or exposure and response prevention) is the practice of staying in an anxiety-provoking or feared situation until the distress or anxiety diminishes.  The goal is to reduce the fear reaction, learning to not react to the bad thoughts.  This is the most effective way to reduce the frequency and severity of the intrusive thoughts.&lt;ref name="Osgood"/&gt;  The goal is to be able to "expose yourself to the thing that most triggers your fear or discomfort for one to two hours at a time, without leaving the situation, or doing anything else to distract or comfort you."&lt;ref&gt;Baer (2001), p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;  Exposure therapy will not completely eliminate intrusive thoughts—everyone has bad thoughts—but most patients find that it can decrease their thoughts sufficiently that intrusive thoughts no longer interfere with their lives.&lt;ref&gt;Baer (2001), p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cognitive behavioral therapy===
[[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) is a newer therapy than exposure therapy, available for those unable or unwilling to undergo exposure therapy.&lt;ref name="Baer91"/&gt;  Cognitive therapy has been shown to be useful in reducing intrusive thoughts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Deblinger E, Stauffer LB, Steer RA |title=Comparative efficacies of supportive and cognitive behavioral group therapies for young children who have been sexually abused and their nonoffending mothers |journal=Child Maltreat |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=332–43 |date=November 2001 |pmid=11675816 |doi= 10.1177/1077559501006004006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sousa MB, Isolan LR, Oliveira RR, Manfro GG, Cordioli AV |title=A randomized clinical trial of cognitive-behavioral group therapy and sertraline in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=67 |issue=7 |pages=1133–9 |date=July 2006 |pmid=16889458 |doi= 10.4088/JCP.v67n0717}}&lt;/ref&gt; but developing a conceptualization of the obsessions and compulsions with the patient is important.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Purdon C |title=Cognitive-behavioral treatment of repugnant obsessions |journal=J Clin Psychol |volume=60 |issue=11 |pages=1169–80 |date=November 2004 |pmid=15389619 |doi=10.1002/jclp.20081 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medication===
[[Antidepressant]]s or [[antipsychotic]] medications may be used for more severe cases if intrusive thoughts do not respond to cognitive behavioral or exposure therapy alone.&lt;ref name=Colino/&gt;&lt;ref name="Baer113114"&gt;Baer (2001), pp. 113–114&lt;/ref&gt;  Whether the cause of intrusive thoughts is OCD, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder, the [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]] (SSRI) drugs (a class of antidepressants) are the most commonly prescribed.&lt;ref name="Baer113114"/&gt;  Intrusive thoughts may occur in persons with [[Tourette syndrome]] (TS) who also have OCD; the obsessions in TS-related OCD are thought to respond to SSRI drugs as well.&lt;ref&gt;Baer (2001), p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

Antidepressants which have been shown to be effective in treating OCD include [[fluvoxamine]] (trade name&lt;ref&gt;Medication trade names may differ between countries. In general, this article uses North American trade names.&lt;/ref&gt; Luvox), [[fluoxetine]] (Prozac), [[sertraline]] (Zoloft), [[paroxetine]] (Paxil), [[citalopram]] (Celexa), and [[clomipramine]] (Anafranil).&lt;ref&gt;Baer (2001), p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;  Although SSRIs are known to be effective for OCD in general, there have been fewer studies on their effectiveness for intrusive thoughts.&lt;ref name="Baer115"&gt;Baer (2001), p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;  A retrospective chart review of patients with sexual symptoms treated with SSRIs showed the greatest improvement was in those with intrusive sexual obsessions typical of OCD.&lt;ref&gt;As reported in Baer (2001), p. 115:  {{cite journal  |vauthors=Stein DJ, Hollander E, Anthony DT, etal |title=Serotonergic medications for sexual obsessions, sexual addictions, and paraphilias |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=53 |issue=8 |pages=267–71 |date=August 1992 |pmid=1386848}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A study of ten patients with religious or blasphemous obsessions found that most patients responded to treatment with fluoxetine or clomipramine.&lt;ref&gt;As reported in Baer (2001), p. 115:  {{cite journal  |vauthors=Fallon BA, Liebowitz MR, Hollander E, etal |title=The pharmacotherapy of moral or religious scrupulosity |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=51 |issue=12 |pages=517–21 |date=December 1990 |pmid=2258366}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Women with postpartum depression often have anxiety as well, and may need lower starting doses of SSRIs; they may not respond fully to the medication, and may benefit from adding cognitive behavioral or response prevention therapy.&lt;ref&gt;Baer (2001), p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

Patients with intense intrusive thoughts that do not respond to SSRIs or other antidepressants may be prescribed [[Typical antipsychotics|typical]] and [[Atypical antipsychotic|atypical]] [[Antipsychotic|neuroleptics]] including [[risperidone]] (trade name Risperdal), [[ziprasidone]] (Geodon), [[haloperidol]] (Haldol), and [[pimozide]] (Orap).&lt;ref&gt;Baer (2001), p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies suggest that therapeutic doses of [[inositol]] may be useful in the treatment of obsessive thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Albert U, Bergesio C, Pessina E, Maina G, Bogetto F |title=Management of treatment resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder.

==Epidemiology==
A 2007 study found that 78% of a clinical sample of OCD patients had intrusive images.&lt;ref name=BrewinIntrusiveImages/&gt; Most people who suffer from intrusive thoughts have not identified themselves as having OCD, because they may not have what they believe to be classic symptoms of OCD, such as handwashing. Yet, [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] studies suggest that intrusive thoughts are the most common kind of OCD worldwide; if people in the United States with intrusive thoughts gathered, they would form the fourth-largest city in the US, following [[New York City]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;Baer (2001), p. xvii&lt;/ref&gt;

The prevalence of OCD in every culture studied is at least 2% of the population, and the majority of those have obsessions, or bad thoughts, only; this results in a conservative estimate of more than 2 million sufferers in the United States alone (as of 2000).&lt;ref&gt;Baer (2001), pp. 36–37&lt;/ref&gt;  One author estimates that one in 50 adults have OCD and about 10–20% of these have sexual obsessions.&lt;ref name="Osgood"&gt;{{cite web |author= Osgood-Hynes, Deborah |url= http://www.ocfoundation.org/UserFiles/File/Thinking%20Bad%20Thoughts.pdf |title= Thinking Bad Thoughts |format= PDF |work= MGH/McLean OCD Institute, Belmont, MA |publisher= OCD Foundation, Milford, CT |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625161358/http://www.ocfoundation.org/UserFiles/File/Thinking%20Bad%20Thoughts.pdf |archivedate= June 25, 2008 |accessdate= December 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A recent study found that 25% of 293 patients with a primary diagnosis of OCD had a history of sexual obsessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Grant JE, Pinto A, Gunnip M, Mancebo MC, Eisen JL, Rasmussen SA |title=Sexual obsessions and clinical correlates in adults with obsessive-compulsive disorder |journal=Compr Psychiatry |volume=47 |issue=5 |pages=325–9 |year=2006 |pmid=16905392 |doi=10.1016/j.comppsych.2006.01.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Kanban board''' is one of the tools that can be used to implement [[Kanban (development)|Kanban]] to manage work at the personal or organizational level.

Kanban boards show how work moves from left to right, with each column representing a stage of the overall process, or to be more precise the system that is visualized by the board. The team pulls cards from one column to another to the right to show progress, and to coordinate their efforts with others.

Kanban boards can be used in [[knowledge work]] or for manufacturing process.&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Gross, Kenneth R. McInnis: Kanban Made Simple—Demystifying and Applying Toyota's Legendary Manufacturing Process. Amacom, USA 2003, p. 50. {{ISBN|0-8144-0763-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

At its simplest, boards are usually divided into "waiting", "work in progress" and "completed work". Complex Kanban boards can be created that visualise the flow of work across a whole [[value stream mapping|value stream map]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theagiledirector.com/content/setting-your-initial-wip-limits|title=On Setting Your Initial WIP Limits |publisher=The Agile Director |date=2014-12-07 |accessdate=2015-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''lantern clock''' is a type of antique weight-driven [[wall]] [[clock]], shaped like a [[lantern]].  They were the first type of clock widely used in private homes.&lt;ref name="Milham"&gt;{{cite book

|pages=89–94

== Origin of the name ==

There are two theories of the origin of the name "lantern clock". One is that it refers to brass, the main metal of which English lantern clocks are made. Clocks were first made on the continent, at first of iron with iron wheels, and then later with brass wheels. Later still, in France, Belgium and The Netherlands, clocks began to be made from brass.&lt;ref&gt;Robey, J.A., "Iron Crossings and Brass Rims", The Horological Journal, British Horological Institute, Newark, England,July 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Brass alloys were then called [[latten]], and it seems likely that brass clocks would have been called "latten clocks" (or "latten horloge" or "latten uhr" in the native languages) to distinguish them from iron clocks, and that "lantern" could be an English interpretation or corruption of latten. The other is that the name derived from the shape; the clock resembles a rectangular lantern of that period, and like a lantern was hung on the wall.

In inventories of deceased clockmakers, lantern clocks are usually referred to as "house clocks", "chamber clocks" or simply "clocks", since in 17th century England they were almost the only type of domestic clocks that existed. It was only after a century had passed, when other types of domestic clocks began to be used in British houses, that more descriptive names for it appeared.  Other names used for lantern clocks are "bedpost", "birdcage" or "Cromwellian" clocks. "Sheep's head clock" was a nickname term for a type of lantern clock that had an extremely large chapter ring covering almost the entire front.

== Origin of lantern clocks ==

The English lantern clock is closely related to lantern clocks that can be found on the European continent. A group of craftsmen from the Low Lands (Flanders) and France, of which some were clockmakers, had established themselves in London at the end of the 16th century. At the same time the middle classes in towns and cities of England began to prosper and the need arose for domestic clocks. Until that time clocks in English houses were confined to the nobility; ordinary people were dependent on sundials, or the tower clocks of local churches.

[[Image:Vallin.jpg|thumb|Clock that was signed 'N. Vallin 1598' Picture of a replica in the Dutch Museum 'Van Speelklok tot Pierement' in Utrecht. The original clock is displayed in the British Museum in London.]]

It is generally accepted that the first lantern clocks in England were made by Frauncoy Nowe and Nicholas Vallin, two Huguenots who had fled from the Low Lands.

== Style characteristics ==

Lantern clocks were made almost entirely of [[brass]], whereas most earlier clocks had been constructed from iron and wood. Typical lantern clocks comprised a [[Square (geometry)|square]] case on ball or [[urn]] feet, a large [[Circle|circular]] dial (with a chapter ring extending beyond the width of the case on early examples), a single hour hand, and a large [[bell (instrument)|bell]] and [[finial]]. The clocks usually had ornate pierced [[fretwork]] on top of the frame.

The main style characteristics of English lantern clocks are similar to its Continental relatives: a wall clock with square bottom and top plates surmounted by a large bell, four corner pillars, a series of vertical plates positioned behind each other and a 30-hour movement with one or more weights.  At the start of the 17th century, the style gradually evolved to a standard to which all clockmakers more or less complied. The guild supervised the clockmakers, who were compelled to work within a prescribed method. Suppliers to the clockmakers' trade contributed to this general style as well. For example, the brass founders supplied stylistically identical clock posts to several clockmakers. In contrast to the Dutch variants, such as stool clocks, English lantern clocks were entirely made of metal (brass and steel).

Lantern clocks were originally weight-driven: usually one weight for time keeping and a second for striking. A few later lantern-style clocks were constructed with spring mechanisms, and many surviving examples of the original weight-driven type have been converted to spring or pendulum mechanisms.

== Guild system ==

In only a few decades the lantern clock became very popular in London, and from there its popularity spread to the entire country. This is evident from the large number of lantern clocks that still exist. Dozens of [[clockmakers]] produced great numbers of these clocks in the city of London during the 17th century. This huge productivity was the result of the high demand for this popular clock in combination with an effective [[guild]] system. In 1631 King Charles I granted a charter for a clockmaker guild in London: the [[Worshipful Company of Clockmakers]], which exists to this day. Many of the well-known clockmakers from that era were freemen of this guild. Many small companies were established in Lothbury in London that functioned as suppliers for the clockmakers. A clockmaker could benefit from the services of brass founders who supplied cast brass clock parts, dial plates, finials, pillars, frets etc., or employ engravers who would carry out the engraving of the dial plates and frets. The guild assured the quality of the products that left the clockmakers' workshops. Before a clockmaker could become a freeman, able to set up his own shop, he had to spend 7 years as an apprentice learning the trade.  This ensured independent clockmakers a plentiful supply of apprentices, who were also cheap labourers who helped to attain this high productivity.

[[Image:gravure01.jpg|thumb|Example of a tulip engraving on the dial of a lantern clock]]

== Influence of the Renaissance ==

Style characteristics were copied from prints that were available for craftsmen. Under the influence of the Renaissance, prints with motives and patterns from the Classical antiquity found their way to the workshops. They served as examples for the clock pillars that were inspired by columns from Greek temples. During the 17th century the tulip became very popular to an extent of a real tulip mania. Prints with pictures of tulips were a rewarding subject for the adornment of the dial plates of lantern clocks. In the early 17th century, lantern clocks got their characteristic shape, which hardly changed during the 17th and halfway through the next century as a result of all this.

[[Image:Bracket clock movement.png|thumb|Bracket clock movement with anchor escapement and count wheel striking.]]

== Clock parts ==

The London Clockmakers equipped their lantern clocks with four pillars inspired by classical columns. Attached to these pillars are classical vase-shaped finials and well-shaped feet. To those finials a bell strap is attached that spreads from four corners and holds a bell. To hide the hammer and the clock movement from the spectator three frets are attached to the finials. The front fret is pierced and engraved whereas the two side frets are pierced but usually left blank. The front of the clock case consists of an engraved dial plate on which a circular dial ring is attached. Almost all lantern clocks originally had just one clock hand to indicate the hours. A standard lantern clock strikes the hours on a large bell and is often equipped with an alarm that rings the same bell. Two doors provide access to the movement and are hinged at the sides of the clock. One or more weights are hanging from ropes or chains at the bottom of the clock.

[[Image:lanternclock.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Lantern clock by [[Langley Bradley]], London, c. 1700. Converted to clockwork mechanism, hence missing its weights.]]

== Obsolescence ==

Lantern clocks were produced in vast numbers during the decades before the pioneering invention of the pendulum by the Dutch scientist [[Christiaan Huygens]] in 1656. Before this invention, lantern clocks used a [[balance wheel]] lacking a [[balance spring]] for their timekeeping element, which limited their accuracy to perhaps 15 minutes per day.           Shortly after Huygens' invention, the bob pendulum was introduced in England, and most English clockmakers adopted the new system quickly.  The pendulum increased the accuracy of clocks so greatly that many existing clocks were converted, with pendulums being added at the back.  Measuring time became much more accurate, but most clockmakers kept building lantern clocks without minute hands: this maybe just a matter of tradition. The result was that clockmakers started to develop other types of domestic clocks. Longcase clocks with 8-day movements made lantern clocks obsolete, and gradually lantern clocks disappeared from the London interiors in the first decades of the 18th century. In rural areas lantern clocks were produced until the beginning of the 19th century, and in those years they were also exported to countries like Turkey, and supplied with oriental numbers on their dials. In the Victorian era there was a revival of interest in antique lantern clocks. Unfortunately this also meant that many clocks of renowned makers were stripped of their movements, which were replaced by 'modern' winding movements. Nowadays unmodified original lantern clocks are very rare.

'''Lobbying''', '''persuasion''', or '''interest representation''' is the act of attempting to influence the actions, policies, or decisions of officials in their daily life, most often [[legislator]]s or members of [[regulatory agency|regulatory agencies]]. Lobbying is done by many types of people, associations and organized groups, including individuals in the [[private sector]], [[corporation]]s, fellow legislators or government officials, or [[advocacy group]]s (interest groups). Lobbyists may be among a legislator's constituencies, meaning a voter or bloc of voters within their [[electoral district]]; they may engage in lobbying as a business. Professional lobbyists are people whose business is trying to influence legislation, regulation, or other government decisions, actions, or policies on behalf of a group or individual who hires them. Individuals and [[nonprofit organization]]s can also lobby as an act of volunteering or as a small part of their normal job. Governments often define and regulate organized group lobbying that has become influential.

The ethics and morals involved with lobbying are complicated. Lobbying can, at times, be spoken of with [[contempt]], when the implication is that people with inordinate socioeconomic power are corrupting the [[law]] in order to serve their own interests. When people who have a duty to act on behalf of others, such as elected officials with a duty to serve their constituents' interests or more broadly the public good, can benefit by shaping the law to serve the interests of some private parties, a [[conflict of interest]] exists.  Many critiques of lobbying point to the potential for conflicts of interest to lead to agent misdirection or the intentional failure of an agent with a duty to serve an employer, client, or constituent to perform those duties.  The failure of government officials to serve the public interest as a consequence of lobbying by special interests who provide benefits to the official is an example of agent misdirection.&lt;ref&gt;Arab Lobby in the United States Handbook, 2015 edition, published by the Global Investment Center, USA ({{ISBN|1-4387-0226-4}})&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
In a report carried by the [[BBC]], an [[OED]] [[lexicographer]] has shown that "lobbying" finds its roots in the gathering of [[Members of parliament#United Kingdom|Members of Parliament]] and [[peerage|peers]] in the hallways ("lobbies") of the [[UK]] [[Houses of Parliament]] before and after parliamentary debates where members of the public can meet their representatives.&lt;ref name=BBC-Lobby&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/82529.stm |title=BBC Definition of lobbying |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-10-01 |accessdate=2013-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One story held that the term originated at the [[Willard InterContinental Washington|Willard Hotel]] in Washington, DC, where it was supposedly used by [[Ulysses S. Grant|President Ulysses S. Grant]] to describe the political advocates who frequented the hotel's lobby to access Grant—who was often there in the evenings to enjoy a cigar and brandy—and would then try to buy the president drinks in an attempt to influence his political decisions.&lt;ref name="NPR - A Lobbyist by Any Other Name"&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5167187 NPR - A Lobbyist by Any Other Name?] - NPR discussion of Ulysses Grant and origins of the term lobbyist.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the term may have gained more widespread currency in Washington, D.C. by virtue of this practice during the [[Grant Administration]], the [[OED English|OED]] cites numerous documented uses of the word well before Grant's presidency, including use in Pennsylvania as early as 1808.&lt;ref name="NPR - A Lobbyist by Any Other Name"/&gt;

The term "lobbying" also appeared in print as early as 1820:&lt;ref&gt;Deanna Gelak (previous president of the American League of Lobbyists) mentioned this in her book ''Lobbying and Advocacy: Winning Strategies, Resources, Recommendations, Ethics and Ongoing Compliance for Lobbyists and Washington Advocates'', TheCapitol.Net, 2008, LobbyingAndAdvocacy.com&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lobby groups]] may concentrate their efforts on the legislatures, where laws are created, but may also use the judicial branch to advance their causes. The [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]], for example, filed suits in state and federal courts in the 1950s to challenge segregation laws. Their efforts resulted in the Supreme Court declaring such laws unconstitutional.

Lobbyists may use a legal device known as ''[[amicus curiae]]'' (literally: "friend of the court") briefs to try to influence court cases. Briefs are written documents filed with a court, typically by parties to a lawsuit. ''Amici curiae'' briefs are briefs filed by people or groups who are not parties to a suit. These briefs are entered into the court records, and give additional background on the matter being decided upon. Advocacy groups use these briefs both to share their expertise and to promote their positions.

The [[lobbying industry]] is affected by the [[Revolving door (politics) |revolving door]] concept, a movement of personnel between roles as legislators and regulators and roles in the [[industry (disambiguation) | industries]] affected by legislation and regulation, as the main asset for a lobbyist is contacts with and influence on government officials.{{cn|date=November 2018}} This climate is attractive for ex-government officials.{{cn|date=November 2018}} It can also mean substantial monetary rewards for lobbying [[firm]]s, and government projects and contracts worth in the hundreds of millions for those they represent.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;Timothy J. Burger, [http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1160453,00.html "The Lobbying Game: Why the Revolving Door Won't Close"] ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' (February 16, 2006).

 | quote = The royal court was home to the king and therefore was an important arena for policy issues and decisions. [...] we find isolated examples of lobbyists for particular interests. An example of such a figure was Sir John Hay, who spent frequent intervals at court during [the reigns of James VI/I and Charles I] when he acted as agent for the Scottish Royal Burghs.

==Lobbying by country==

===Australia===
Over the past twenty years, lobbying in [[Australia]] has grown from a small industry of a few hundred employees to a multi-billion dollar per year industry. What was once the preserve of big multinational companies and at a more local level, property developers, for example [[Urban Taskforce Australia]], has morphed into an industry that would employ more than [[10,000]] people and represent every facet of human endeavour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fitzgerald|first=Julian|title=Lobbying In Australia: You Can’t Expect Anything to Change If You Don’t Speak Up|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Public lobbyist registers====
A register of federal lobbyists is kept by the [[Australian Government]] and is accessible to the public via its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://lobbyists.pmc.gov.au/who_register.cfm|title = Who is on the register?|date = |accessdate = 2015-04-15|website = Department of the Prime Minister &amp; Cabinet|publisher = Australian Government}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar registers for State government lobbyists were introduced between 2007 and 2009 around Australia. Since April 2007 in Western Australia, only lobbyists listed on the state's register are allowed to contact a government representative for the purpose of lobbying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.lobbyists.wa.gov.au/Pages/About.aspx|title = About the Register|date = 2011-07-20|accessdate = 2015-04-15|website = Public Sector Commission - Register of Lobbyists|publisher = Government of Western Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar rules have applied in Tasmania since 1 September 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Register of Lobbyists : Register of Lobbyists|url = http://lobbyists.dpac.tas.gov.au/|website = lobbyists.dpac.tas.gov.au|accessdate = 2015-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[South Australia]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] since 1 December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.dpc.sa.gov.au/south-australian-lobbyist-code-conduct-and-register|title = South Australian Lobbyist Code of Conduct and Public Register|date = |accessdate = 2015-04-15|website = Department of Premier &amp; Cabinet|publisher = Government of South Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.lobbyistsregister.vic.gov.au/lobbyistsregister/index.cfm?event=faq|title = Questions and answers for Victorian Register of Lobbyists|date = 2014-06-20|accessdate = |website = Victorian Public Sector Commissioner - Register of Lobbyists|publisher = State Government of Victoria}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===
[[File:Topics european lobbying.jpg|thumb|[[Wikimania 2009]], results of the discussion about possible contents of European lobbying]]

The first step to towards specialized regulation of lobbying in the European Union was a Written Question tabled by Alman Metten, in 1989. In 1991, Marc Galle, Chairman of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, was appointed to submit proposals for a Code of conduct and a register of lobbyists. Today lobbying in the European Union is an integral and important part of decision-making in the EU. From year to year lobbying regulation in the EU is constantly improving and the number of lobbyists are increases&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nesterovych|first=Volodymyr|date=2015|title=EU standards for the regulation of lobbying|url=https://www.academia.edu/37339449/EU_standards_for_the_regulation_of_lobbying|journal=Prawa Człowieka|volume=nr 18|pages=98, 106|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. According to Austrian [[Member of the European Parliament]] ("MEP") [[Hans-Peter Martin]], the value of lobby invitations and offers each individual MEP receives can reach up to €10,000 per week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[New Europe (newspaper)|New European]] |date=April 25, 2011 |url=http://www.neurope.eu/article/taming-brussels-lobby |title=Taming Brussels lobby}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 there were around [[15,000]] lobbyists (consultants, lawyers, associations, corporations, NGOs etc.) in [[Brussels]] seeking to influence the EU’s legislation. Some [[2,600]] special interest groups had a permanent office in Brussels. Their distribution was roughly as follows: European trade federations (32%), consultants (20%), companies (13%), NGOs (11%), national associations (10%), regional representations (6%), international organizations (5%) and [[think tank]]s (1%), (Lehmann, 2003, pp iii).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/civil_society/interest_groups/docs/workingdocparl.pdf |format=PDF |title= Lobbying in the European Union: current rules and practices |first=Wilhelm |last=Lehman |year= 2003 |accessdate=September 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apertacontrada.it/2013/02/21/form-of-government-and-lobbies-in-uk-and-ue-a-comparative-perspective/  |first= Pier Luigi |last=Petrillo |authorlink=Pier Luigi Petrillo |title=Form of government and lobbying UK and UE, a comparative perspective |date=March 2013 |publisher=Apertacontrada.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, lobby organisations sometimes hire former EU employees (a phenomenon known as the revolving door) who possess inside knowledge of the EU institutions and policy process &lt;ref name="transparency.eu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://transparency.eu/access-all-areas/|title=Transparency International EU (2017) Access All Areas: when EU politicians become lobbyists.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report by [[Transparency International]] EU published in January 2017 analysed the career paths of former EU officials and found that 30% of Members of the [[European Parliament]] who left politics went to work for organisations on the EU lobby register after their mandate and approximately one third of Commissioners serving under Barroso took jobs in the private sector after their mandate, including for [[Uber]], [[ArcelorMittal]], [[Goldman Sachs]] and [[Bank of America Merrill Lynch]]. These potential conflicts of interest could be avoided if a stronger ethics framework would be established at the EU level, including an independent ethics body and longer cooling-off periods for MEPs.&lt;ref name="transparency.eu"/&gt;

In the wake of the [[Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal]] in Washington D.C. and the massive impact this had on the lobbying scene in the [[United States]], the rules for lobbying in the EU—which until now consist of only a non-binding code of conduct-—may also be tightened.&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/documents/comm/green_papers/pdf/com2006_194_en.pdf Green Paper on European Transparency Initiative] [[European Commission]], 2006.  Retrieved September 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

====France====

There is currently no regulation at all for lobbying activities in France. There is no regulated access to the French institutions and no register specific to France, but there is one for the [[European Union]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/news/justice/091028_fr.htm |title=Pleins feux sur les lobbies dans l'UE (28 October 2009) |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date=2009-10-28 |accessdate=2013-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; where French lobbyists can register themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pseudo * |url=http://www.dsmw.org/lobbying.html |title=Le lobbying passe aussi par le web (12 March 2012) |publisher=Dsmw.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the internal rule of the National Assembly (art. 23 and 79) forbids members of Parliament to be linked with a particular interest. Also, there is no rule at all for consultation of interest groups by the Parliament and the Government. Nevertheless, a recent parliamentary initiative (motion for a resolution) has been launched by several MPs so as to establish a register for representatives of interest groups and lobbyists who intend to lobby the MPs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/18/10/38944365.pdf French National Assembly : Motion for a Resolution on Lobbying (21 November 2006)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325060849/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/18/10/38944365.pdf |date=March 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Italy ====
A 2016 study finds evidence of significant indirect lobbying of Berlusconi through business proxies.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Market-Based Lobbying: Evidence from Advertising Spending in Italy †|url = http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20150042|journal = American Economic Journal: Applied Economics|pages = 224–256|volume = 8|issue = 1|doi = 10.1257/app.20150042|first = Stefano|last = DellaVigna|first2 = Ruben|last2 = Durante|first3 = Brian|last3 = Knight|first4 = Eliana La|last4 = Ferrara}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors document a significant pro-Mediaset (the mass media company founded and controlled by Berlusconi) bias in the allocation of advertising spending during Berlusconi's political tenure, in particular for companies operating in more regulated sectors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===United States===
{{Main|Lobbying in the United States}}
[[File:K Street NW at 19th Street.jpg|thumb|[[K Street (Washington, D.C.)|K Street NW at 19th Street]] in [[Washington D.C.]], part of downtown Washington's maze of high-powered "[[K Street (Washington, D.C.)|K Street lobbyist]]" and [[law firms|law firm]] office buildings.]]

Lobbying in the United States describes paid activity in which special interests hire professional advocates to argue for specific legislation in decision-making bodies such as the [[United States Congress]]. Lobbying in the United States could be seen to originate from Amendment I of the Constitution of the United States, which states: Congress shall make no law…abridging the right of the people peaceably…to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. Some lobbyists are now using social media to reduce the cost of traditional campaigns, and to more precisely target public officials with political messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2016/07/13/government-lobbyists-social-media/|title=Government Lobbyists Are More Nimble Than Ever|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of published studies showed lobbying expenditure is correlated with great financial returns.  For example, a 2011 study of the 50 firms that spent the most on lobbying relative to their assets compared their financial performance against that of the [[S&amp;P 500]] in the stock market concluded that spending on lobbying was a "spectacular investment" yielding "blistering" returns comparable to a high-flying [[hedge fund]], even despite the financial downturn of the past few years.&lt;ref name=twsM23&gt;{{cite news |author= Brad Plumer |title= The outsized returns from lobbying |work= [[The Washington Post]] |quote= ...Hiring a top-flight lobbyist looks like a spectacular investment ... |date= October 10, 2011 |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/the-outsized-returns-from-lobbying/2011/10/10/gIQADSNEaL_blog.html |accessdate= 2012-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 [[meta-analysis]] of previous research findings found a positive correlation between corporate political activity and firm performance.&lt;ref name=tws2NovZ111&gt;{{cite news |author1=Lux, Sean |author2=Crook, T.

Mazza, &amp; Susan Scholz. (8 April 2009). "[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1375082 Measuring Rates of Return for Lobbying Expenditures: An Empirical Case Study of Tax Breaks for Multinational Corporations]" Retrieved 7 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Major American corporations spent $345 million lobbying for just three pro-immigration bills between 2006 and 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://churchandstate.org.uk/2016/02/how-did-opening-borders-to-mass-immigration-become-a-left-wing-idea/|title=How did opening borders to mass immigration become a 'Left-wing' idea?|date=11 February 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign-funded lobbying efforts include those of [[Israel lobby in the United States|Israel]], [[Saudi Arabia lobby in the United States|Saudi Arabia]], [[Turkish lobby in the United States|Turkey]], [[Egypt lobby in the United States|Egypt]], [[Pakistani lobby in the United States|Pakistan]], and [[China Lobby|China]] lobbies. In 2010 alone, foreign governments spent approximately $460 million on lobbying members of Congress and government officials.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.rollcall.com/news/Lobbying_by_Foreign_Countries_Decreases-208745-1.html Lobbying by Foreign Countries Decreases]". ''[[Roll Call]]''. September 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other countries===
Other countries where lobbying is regulated in parliamentary bills include:
*'''Canada''': Canada maintains a Registry of Lobbyists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ocl-cal.gc.ca/eic/site/lobbyist-lobbyiste1.nsf/eng/h_nx00269.html |title=Lobbying Act, Regulations and Code of Conduct |date=September 10, 2010 |work= |publisher=Office of the Commissioner of Lobbying of Canada |accessdate=January 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Politics of Israel#Interest groups|'''Israel''']] (1994)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.knesset.gov.il/lexicon/eng/lobby_eng.htm |title=Lobbies in the Knesset |publisher=Knesset.gov.il |date=1997-04-01 |accessdate=2013-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''India''': In [[India]], where there is no law regulating the process, lobbying had traditionally been a tool for industry bodies (like FICCI) and other pressure groups to engage with the government ahead of the national budget. One reason being that lobbying activities were repeatedly identified in the context of corruption cases. For example, in 2010 , leaked audio transcripts of Nira Radia. Not only private companies but even Indian government has been paying a fee every year since 2005 to a US firm to lobby;{{citation need|date=August 2018}} for ex. to the Indo-US civilian nuclear deal. In India, there are no laws that defined the scope of lobbying, who could undertake it, or the extent of disclosure necessary. Companies are not mandated to disclose their activities and lobbyists are neither authorized nor encouraged to reveal the names of clients or public officials they have contacted. The distinction between Lobbying and bribery still remains unclear. In 2012, Walmart revealed it had spent $25 million since 2008 on lobbying to "enhance market access for investment in India." This disclosure came weeks after the Indian government made a controversial decision to permit FDI in the country's multi-brand retail sector.

*Ukraine: In 2009, a special working group of the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine developed a draft law "On Lobbying". However, this bill was not introduced into the Parliament of Ukraine&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nesterovych|first=Volodymyr|date=2010|title=Legalization, accreditation, control and supervisory activity concerning lobbyists and lobbying organizations: prospects for Ukraine|url=http://vlz.in.ua/uploads/File/pdf/St/2010-і/2010-1s/Nesterovich.pdf|journal=Power.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1452">'''LoopCo''' is an economic model created in the mid-1990s as a proposal to the [[Federal Communications Commission]] and the US Congress for the healthy development of competition in the local and long distance industries in the US. While there was widespread support among competitors in the industry, it was not implemented. Instead the Telecom Act of 1996 was implemented in a form that resulted in the reduction of telecommunications competition in the local loop. The original proposal was designed and named by Roy Morris, an adjunct professor at Capitol College, and with  US ONE Communications, one of the early entrants in the local telephone business, which also was one of the first to exit that business. The fundamental economic principles were developed based on earlier research and publications of Jerry Duvall, a prominent economist at the Federal Communications Commission.

In [[microeconomics]], '''marginal profit''' is the difference between the [[marginal revenue]] and the [[marginal cost]]. Under the [[Profit maximization#Marginal cost-marginal revenue method|marginal approach to profit maximization]], to maximize profits, a firm should continue to produce a good or service up to the point where marginal profit is zero.

The most simple formula of Marginal profit is: Marginal revenue - Marginal cost. The derivate of the profit f(x) is in fact MP. In other words: p(x)=R(x)-C(x).</text>

'''Mars orbit rendezvous''' ('''MOR''') is a space travel concept where two spacecraft meet up and/or dock in Mars orbit.&lt;ref name="portree2001"/&gt; For example, one vehicle takes off from Mars, such as a Martian ascent stage, and does a rendezvous in Mars orbit with another spacecraft.&lt;ref name="portree2001"/&gt; Applied to a [[Mars sample return]] or [[manned mission to Mars]], it allows much less weight to be sent to the surface and back into orbit, because the fuel needed to travel back to Earth is not landed on the planet.&lt;ref name="portree2001"&gt;

Available as [https://history.nasa.gov/monograph21/humans_to_Mars.htm NASA SP-2001-4521].&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been proposed for unmanned [[Mars sample return]] plans.&lt;ref name=sd2000701&gt;

In one mission proposal, MOR was planned for a Mars Descent-Ascent Vehicle (DAV) and Mars Transit Habitat, where a crew would transfer to the DAV after traveling to Mars on the habitat.&lt;ref name=price&gt;[http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/41431/1/09-3642.pdf Hoppy Price - Austere Human Missions to Mars (2009) - JPL]&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed the Mars DAV to be launched separately from the transit habitat, and without any crew.&lt;ref name=price/&gt;

MOR is analogous to [[Lunar orbit rendezvous]] (LOR) used on the United States [[NASA]] [[Apollo program]] missions to Earth's moon during 1969 to 1972, as opposed to [[Earth orbit rendezvous]] (EOR) or [[Direct ascent]].&lt;ref name="portree2001"/&gt;

A related concept is a Mars flyby rendezvous, where spacecraft do not enter orbit but rendezvous near the planet.&lt;ref name="portree2001flyby"&gt;{{cite book|pages=15-16|chapter=Chapter 3: EMPIRE and After|first=David S.

&lt;!--
Another variation is that the ascent stage comes from one of the [[Mars moons]], in the case of an expedition to [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] or [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}--&gt;&lt;!-- is there a reliable secondary source for these two assertions? --&gt;

Mars orbit rendezvous was utilized in [[Austere Human Missions to Mars]], a tweak of DRA 5.0.

'''Mars to Stay''' missions propose [[astronauts]] sent to [[Mars]] for the first time should intend to stay. Unused emergency return vehicles would be recycled into [[Colonization of Mars|settlement]] construction as soon as the habitability of Mars becomes evident to the initial pioneers. Mars to Stay missions are advocated both to reduce cost and to ensure permanent [[Colonization of Mars|settlement of Mars]]. Among many notable Mars to Stay advocates, former [[Apollo program|Apollo]] [[astronaut]] [[Buzz Aldrin]] has been particularly outspoken, suggesting in numerous forums "Forget the Moon, Let’s Head to Mars!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/80beats/2009/06/26/buzz-aldrin-speaks-out-forget-the-moon-lets-head-to-mars/ |title=Buzz Aldrin Speaks Out: Forget the Moon, Let’s Head to Mars |first=Eliza |last=Strickland |date=26 June 2006 |work=Discover Magazine: 80beats blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in June 2013, Aldrin promoted a manned mission "to homestead Mars and become a two-planet species".&lt;ref name="NYT-20130613"&gt;{{cite news |last=Aldrin |first=Buzz |title=The Call of Mars|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/14/opinion/global/buzz-aldrin-the-call-of-mars.html |date=June 13, 2013 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=June 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2015, Aldrin, in association with the [[Florida Institute of Technology]], presented a "master plan", for NASA consideration, for astronauts, with a "tour of duty of ten years", to colonize Mars before the year 2040.&lt;ref name="AP-20150827"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dunn |first=Marcia |title=Buzz Aldrin joins university, forming 'master plan' for Mars |url=http://apnews.excite.com/article/20150827/us-sci-buzz-aldrin-c7bc5ba293.html |date=August 27, 2015 |work=[[AP News]] |accessdate=August 30, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mars Underground, Mars Homestead Foundation, [[Mars One]], and Mars Artists Community advocacy groups and business organizations have also adopted Mars to Stay policy initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKvQPrHneVY "Mars Underground" (Five Part Series)], YouTube&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest formal outline of a Mars to Stay mission architecture was given at the Case for Mars VI Workshop in 1996, during a presentation by George Herbert titled "One Way to Mars".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spot.colorado.edu/~marscase/cfm/abs.html |title="One Way to Mars," The Case for Mars VI Workshop, 1996. |accessdate=2010-01-11 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000831021330/http://spot.colorado.edu/~marscase/cfm/abs.html |archivedate=August 31, 2000 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposals==

===Arguments for settlement missions===
Since returning the astronauts from the surface of Mars is one of the most difficult parts of a Mars mission, the idea of a one-way trip to Mars has been proposed several times. Space activist Bruce Mackenzie, for example, proposed a one-way trip to Mars in a presentation "One Way to Mars – a Permanent Settlement on the First Mission" at the 1998 [[International Space Development Conference]],&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Mackenzie, "One Way to Mars – a Permanent Settlement on the First Mission," presented at the 1998 International Space Development Conference, May 21–25, Milwaukee WI; [http://archivist.nss.org/Public/ISDC/ISDC1999_Houston/ConferenceMisc-DaleAmonPapers/ISDC99-Abstracts_CD/AIAA%20Abstracts/One%20Way%20to%20Mars.pdf Abstract] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113111102/http://archivist.nss.org/Public/ISDC/ISDC1999_Houston/ConferenceMisc-DaleAmonPapers/ISDC99-Abstracts_CD/AIAA%20Abstracts/One%20Way%20to%20Mars.pdf |date=2013-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that since the mission could be done with less difficulty and expense if the astronauts were not required to return to [[Earth]], the first mission to Mars should be a settlement, not a visit.

[[Paul Davies]], writing in the ''[[New York Times]]'' in 2004, made similar arguments.&lt;ref name= "davies" /&gt; Under Davies' plan, an initial colony of four astronauts equipped with a small [[nuclear reactor]] and a couple of [[Mars rover|rover vehicles]] would make their own [[oxygen]], [[greenhouse|grow food]], and even initiate building projects [[In-situ resource utilization|using local raw materials]]. Supplemented by food shipments, medical supplies, and replacement gadgets from Earth, the colony would be indefinitely sustained.

=== Original Aldrin plan ===
Under Mars to Stay mission architectures, the first humans to travel to Mars would typically be in six-member teams. After this initial landing, subsequent missions would raise the number of persons on Mars to 30, thereby beginning a Martian settlement. Since the Martian surface offers all the natural resources and elements necessary to sustain a robust, mature, industrialized human settlement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must |last=Zubrin |first=Robert |authorlink = Robert Zubrin|date=June 28, 2011 |publisher=Free Press |isbn=145160811X |quote=In contrast to the comparative desert of the Earth's moon, Mars possesses veritable oceans of water frozen into its soil as permafrost, as well as vast quantities of carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen, all in forms readily accessible to those inventive enough to use them. These four elements are not only the basis of food and water, but of plastics, wood, paper, clothing – and most importantly – rocket fuel. Additionally, Mars has experienced the same sorts of volcanic and hydrologic processes that produced a multitude of mineral ores on Earth. Virtually every element of significant interest is known to exist on the Red Planet. |page=Preface XXV, see also 210, 213, 217, 221, 236}}&lt;/ref&gt;—unlike, for example the [[Moon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Entering Space: Creating a Spacefaring Civilization |last=Zubrin |first=Robert |authorlink = Robert Zubrin|date=August 7, 2000 |publisher= Tarcher |isbn= 1585420360 |quote=Mars has a tremendous advantage compared to the Moon and asteroids, because unlike these other destinations the Red Planet contains all the necessary elements to support both life and technological civilization, making self-sufficiency possible in food and all basic, bulk, and simple manufactured goods. |page=107, see also 81, 82, 101, 155}}&lt;/ref&gt;—a permanent Martian settlement is thought to be the most effective way to ensure that humanity becomes a space-faring, multi-planet species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must |last=Zubrin |first=Robert |authorlink = Robert Zubrin|date=June 28, 2011 |publisher=Free Press |isbn=145160811X |quote=Mars is not just a destination for explorers or an object of scientific inquiry, it is a world compared to which all other known extraterrestrial bodies are utterly bleak poverty zones. On Mars the resources exist that could allow travelers to grow food, make plastics and metals, and generate large quantities of power. There is no element in large-scale use by human society today that cannot be found in adequate quantities on Mars, and its environmental conditions, in terms of radiation, sunlight availability, and day-night temperature swings, are all well within limits acceptable to different states of human settlement on its surface. |page=187 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the use of [[digital fabricator]]s and [[in vitro fertilisation]] it is assumed a permanent human settlement on Mars can grow organically from an original thirty to forty pioneers.&lt;ref name="physorg"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Mars to Stay mission following Aldrin's proposal would enlist astronauts in the following timeline:

* Age 30: an offer to help settle Mars is extended to select pioneers
* Age 30–35: training and social conditioning for long-duration isolation and time-delay communications
* Age 35: launch three married couples to Mars; followed in subsequent years by a dozen or more couples
* Age 35–65: development of sheltered [[underground living]] spaces; [[artificial insemination]] ensures [[genetic diversity]]
* Age 65: an offer to return to Earth or retire on Mars is given to first-generation settlers

As Aldrin has said, "who knows what advances will have taken place. The first generation can retire there, or maybe we can bring them back."&lt;ref name="physorg" /&gt;

=== "To Boldly Go: A One-Way Human Mission to Mars" ===
An article by Dirk Schulze-Makuch ([[Washington State University]]) and [[Paul Davies]] ([[Arizona State University]]) from the book ''The Human Mission to Mars: Colonizing the Red Planet''&lt;ref name=ToBoldlyGo /&gt; highlights their mission plans as:
* No [[Colonization of the Moon|base on the Moon]] is needed. Given the broad variety of resources available on Mars, the long-term survival of Martian settlers is much more feasible than Lunar settlers.
* Since Mars affords neither an [[Ozone layer|ozone shield]] nor [[Magnetosphere|magnetospheric]] protection, [[robots]] would prepare a basic modular base inside near-surface [[lava tubes]] and [[ice caves]] for the human settlers.
* A volunteer signing up for a one-way mission to Mars would do so with the full understanding that they will not return to Earth; [[Mars exploration]] would proceed for a long time on the basis of outbound journeys only.
* The first human contingent would consist of a crew of four, ideally (if budget permits) distributed between two two-man spacecraft for mission redundancy.
* Over time humans on Mars will increase with follow-up missions. Several subsurface [[biosphere]]s would be created until there were 150+ individuals in a viable [[gene pool]]. [[Genetic engineering]] would further contribute to the health and [[longevity]] of settlers.

The astronauts would be sent supplies from Earth regularly. This proposal was picked up for discussion in a number of public sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Steven | last = Hoffer | title = NASA Planning One-Way Manned Mission to Mars | date = October 27, 2010 | url = http://www.aolnews.com/surge-desk/article/nasa-hopes-to-send-astronauts-on-one-way-mission-to-mars/19692279 | work = AOL News | accessdate = 2010-10-31 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101031001355/http://www.aolnews.com/surge-desk/article/nasa-hopes-to-send-astronauts-on-one-way-mission-to-mars/19692279 | archivedate = October 31, 2010 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mars One===
{{main|Mars One}}

A proposal for a one-way human settlement mission to Mars was put forward in 2012 by the [[Mars One]], a [[private spaceflight]] project led by [[Dutch people|Dutch]] entrepreneur [[Bas Lansdorp]] to establish a permanent [[Colonization of Mars|human colony on Mars]].&lt;ref name=dj20120601&gt;

The proposal is to send a [[communication satellite]] and path finder lander to the planet by 2018 and, after several stages, land four humans on Mars for permanent settlement in 2027.&lt;ref name=satellite&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2405162,00.asp| author=Adario Strange| title=Dutch Group Planning for Mars Settlement by 2023 |work=PC Mag |date=1 June 2012| accessdate=6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strive to Stay: Emergency Return Only ===
In response to feedback following the EarthLight Institute's "Mars Colony 2030" project at [[Newspace|NewSpace 2012]] and the announcement of [[Mars One]], Eric Machmer proposed [[conjunction-class mission]]s be planned with a bias to stay (if low gravity, radiation, and other factors present no pressing health issues),&lt;ref name="WIRED-20140212"&gt;{{cite web |last=Fong, MD |first=Kevin |title=The Strange, Deadly Effects Mars Would Have on Your Body |url=https://www.wired.com/opinion/2014/02/happens-body-mars/ |date=12 February 2014 |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |accessdate=12 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacevidcast.com/2012/07/28/newspace-2012-the-earthlight-institute-presents-mars-colony-2030/ "NewSpace 2012: The EarthLight Institute Presents: Mars Colony 2030"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130103022417/http://www.spacevidcast.com/2012/07/28/newspace-2012-the-earthlight-institute-presents-mars-colony-2030/ |date=2013-01-03 }}, [[Spacevidcast]]&lt;/ref&gt; so that, if at the end of each 550-day period during a conjunction-class [[launch window]] no adverse health effects were observed, settlers would continue research and construction through another 550-day period. In the meantime, additional crews and supplies would continue to arrive, starting their own 550-day evaluation periods. Health tests would be repeated during subsequent 550-day periods until the viability of human life on Mars was proven. Once settlers determine that humans can live on Mars without negative health effects, emergency return vehicles would be recycled into permanent research bases.

==Initial and permanent settlement==
Initial explorers leave equipment in orbit and at landing zones scattered considerable distances from the main settlement. Subsequent missions therefore are assumed to become easier and safer to undertake, with the likelihood of back-up equipment being present if accidents in transit or landing occur.

Large subsurface, pressurized habitats would be the first step toward human settlement; as Dr. [[Robert Zubrin]] suggests in the first chapter of his book ''[[Mars Direct]]'', these structures can be built as Roman-style [[Atrium (architecture)|atria]] in mountainsides or underground with easily produced Martian brick. During and after this initial phase of habitat construction, hard-plastic [[radiation]] and abrasion-resistant [[geodesic domes]] could be deployed on the surface for eventual habitation and crop growth. Nascent industry would begin using indigenous resources: the manufacture of [[plastics]], [[ceramic]]s and [[glass]] could be easily achieved.

The longer-term work of [[Terraforming of Mars|terraforming Mars]] requires an initial phase of [[global warming]] to release [[atmosphere]] from the Martian [[regolith]] and to create a [[Water cycle|water-cycle]]. Three methods of global warming are described by Zubrin, who suggests they are best deployed in tandem: [[Space mirror (geoengineering)|orbital mirrors]] to heat the surface; factories on the ground to pump [[halocarbons]] into the atmosphere; and the seeding of [[bacteria]] that can [[Metabolism|metabolize]] water, [[nitrogen]] and [[carbon]] to produce [[ammonia]] and [[methane]] (these gases would aid in [[global warming]]). While the work of terraforming Mars is on-going, robust settlement of Mars would continue.

Zubrin, in his 1996 book (revised 2011) ''[[The Case for Mars]]'', acknowledges any Martian colony will be partially Earth-dependent for centuries. However, Zubrin suggests Mars may be profitable for two reasons. First, it may contain concentrated supplies of [[metals]] equal to or of greater value than [[silver]], which have not been subjected to millennia of human scavenging; it is suggested such ores may be sold on Earth for profit. Secondly, the concentration of [[deuterium]]—an extremely expensive but essential fuel for the as-yet non-existent [[nuclear fusion]] power industry—is five times greater on Mars. Humans emigrating to Mars, under this paradigm, are presumed to have an industry; it is assumed the planet will be a magnet for settlers as wage costs will be high. Because of the labor shortage on Mars and its subsequent high pay-scale, Martian civilization and the value placed upon each individual's productivity is proposed as a future engine of both technological and social advancement.

In the fifth chapter of "Mars Direct", Zubrin addresses the idea that [[radiation]] and [[zero-gravity]] are unduly hazardous. He claims [[cancer]] rates ''do'' increase for astronauts who have spent extensive time in space, but only marginally. Similarly, while zero-gravity presents challenges, near total recovery of [[musculature]] and [[immune system]] vitality is presumed by all Mars to Stay mission plans once settlers are on the Martian surface. Several experiments, such as the [[Mars Gravity Biosatellite]], have been proposed to test this hypothetical assumption, but until humans have lived in Martian gravity conditions (38% of Earth's), human long-term viability in such low gravity will remain only a working assumption. [[Back-contamination]]—humans acquiring and spreading hypothetical Martian [[viruses]]—is described as "just plain nuts", because there are no host organisms on Mars for disease organisms to have evolved.

In the same chapter, Zubrin rejects suggestions the [[Moon]] should be used as waypoint to Mars or as a preliminary training area. "It is ultimately much easier to journey to Mars from low Earth orbit than from the Moon and using the latter as a staging point is a pointless diversion of resources." While the Moon may superficially appear a good place to perfect Mars exploration and habitation techniques, the two bodies are radically different. The Moon has no [[atmosphere]], no analogous [[geology]] and a much greater temperature range and rotational period of illumination. It is argued [[Antarctica]], [[deserts]] of Earth, and precisely controlled chilled [[vacuum chamber]]s on easily accessible NASA centers on Earth provide much better training grounds at lesser cost.

"Should the United States space program send a mission to Mars, those astronauts should be prepared to stay there," said Lunar astronaut Buzz Aldrin during an interview on "Mars to Stay" initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The time and expense required to send astronauts to Mars, argues Aldrin, "warrants more than a brief sojourn, so those who are on board should think of themselves as pioneers. Like the [[Pilgrim Fathers|Pilgrims]] who came to the [[New World]] or the families who headed to the [[Wild West]], they should not plan on coming back home." The Moon is a shorter trip of two or three days, but according to Mars advocates it offers virtually no potential for independent settlements. Studies have found that Mars, on the other hand, has vast [[Water on Mars|reserves of frozen water]], all of the basic elements, and more closely mimics both gravitational (roughly {{frac|1|3}} of Earth's while the moon is {{frac|1|6}}) and illumination conditions on Earth. "It is easier to subsist, to provide the support needed for people there than on the Moon." In an interview with reporters, Aldrin said Mars offers greater potential than Earth's satellite as a place for habitation:

{{quote|If we are going to put a few people down there and ensure their appropriate safety, would you then go through all that trouble and then bring them back immediately, after a year, a year and a half? ... They need to go there more with the [[Psychological and sociological issues affecting space travel|psychology]] of knowing that you are a pioneering settler and you don't look forward to go back home again after a couple of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A comprehensive statement of a rationale for "Mars to Stay" was laid out by Dr. Aldrin in a May 2009 [[Popular Mechanics]] article, as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The agency's current Vision for [[Space Exploration]] will waste decades and hundreds of billions of dollars trying to reach the Moon by 2020—a glorified rehash of what we did 40 years ago. Instead of a steppingstone to Mars, [[NASA]]'s current lunar plan is a detour. It will derail our Mars effort, siphoning off money and engineering talent for the next two decades. If we aspire to a long-term human presence on Mars—and I believe that should be our overarching goal for the foreseeable future—we must drastically change our focus. Our purely exploratory efforts should aim higher than a place we've already set foot on six times. In recent years my philosophy on colonizing Mars has evolved. I now believe that human visitors to the Red Planet should commit to staying there permanently. One-way tickets to Mars will make the missions technically easier and less expensive and get us there sooner. More importantly, they will ensure that our Martian outpost steadily grows as more homesteaders arrive. Instead of explorers, one-way Mars travelers will be 21st-century pilgrims, pioneering a new way of life. It will take a special kind of person. Instead of the traditional pilot/scientist/engineer, Martian homesteaders will be selected more for their personalities—flexible, inventive and determined in the face of unpredictability. In short, survivors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Image:Mars to Stay Traitors Return to Earth.png|thumb|200px|Mars Artists design, August 2009.]]

In October 2009, Eric Berger of the Houston Chronicle wrote of "Mars to Stay" as perhaps the only program that can revitalize the United States' space program:

&lt;blockquote&gt;What if NASA could land astronauts on Mars in a decade, for not ridiculously more money than the $10 billion the agency spends annually on human spaceflight? It's possible ... relieving NASA of the need to send fuel and rocketry to blast humans off the Martian surface, which has slightly more than twice the gravity of the moon, would actually reduce costs by about a factor of 10, by some estimates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Hard Science Fiction]] writer [[Mike Brotherton]] has found "Mars to Stay" appealing for both economic and safety reasons, but more emphatically, as a fulfillment of the ultimate mandate by which "our manned space program is sold, at least philosophically and long-term, as a step to colonizing other worlds". Two-thirds of the respondents to a poll on his website expressed interest in a one-way ticket to Mars "if mission parameters are well-defined" (not suicidal).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In June 2010, Buzz Aldrin gave an interview to [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] in which he restated "Mars to Stay":

&lt;blockquote&gt;Did the Pilgrims on the [[Mayflower]] sit around [[Plymouth Rock]] waiting for a return trip? They came here to settle. And that's what we should be doing on Mars. When you go to Mars, you need to have made the decision that you're there permanently. The more people we have there, the more it can become a sustaining environment. Except for very rare exceptions, the people who go to Mars shouldn't be coming back. Once you get on the surface, you're there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

An article by Dirk Schulze-Makuch ([[Washington State University]]) and [[Paul Davies]] ([[Arizona State University]]) from the book ''The Human Mission to Mars: Colonizing the Red Planet''&lt;ref name=ToBoldlyGo &gt;{{cite journal | title = To Boldly Go: A One-Way Human Mission to Mars | date = October–November 2010 | url = http://journalofcosmology.com/Mars108.html | work = Journal of Cosmology}}&lt;/ref&gt; summarizes their rationale for Mars to Stay:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Mars to stay] would {{sic|obviate|hide=y| the need}} for years of rehabilitation for returning astronauts, which would not be an issue if the astronauts were to remain in the low-gravity environment of Mars. We envision that Mars exploration would begin and proceed for a long time on the basis of outbound journeys only.&lt;ref name=ToBoldlyGo /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In November 2010, [[Keith Olbermann]] started an interview with [[Derrick Pitts]], Planetarium Director at the [[Franklin Institute]] in [[Philadelphia]], by quoting from the Dirk Schulze-Makuch and [[Paul Davies]] article, saying, "The Astronauts would go to Mars with the intention of staying for the rest of their lives, as trailblazers of a permanent human Mars colony." In response to Olbermann's statement that "the authors claim a one-way ticket to Mars is no more outlandish than a one-way ticket to America was in 1620", Pitts defends Mars to Stay initiatives by saying "they begin to open the doors in a way that haven't been opened before".&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=ouryjB6elT0|title=Keith Olbermann With Derrick Pitts: Why Mars Needs People – 11/16/10}} {{dead link|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a January 2011 interview, [[X Prize]] founder [[Peter Diamandis]] expressed his preference for Mars to Stay research settlements:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Privately funded missions are the only way to go to Mars with humans because I think the best way to go is on "one-way" colonization flights and no government will likely sanction such a risk. The timing for this could well be within the next 20 years. It will fall within the hands of a small group of tech billionaires who view such missions as the way to leave their mark on humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

== New York Times op-eds ==
"Mars to Stay" has been explicitly proposed by two [[op-ed]] pieces in the ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name= "davies"/&gt;&lt;ref name="krauss"/&gt;

Following a similar line of argument to Buzz Aldrin, [[Lawrence Krauss]] asks in an [[op-ed]], "Why are we so interested in bringing the Mars astronauts home again?".&lt;ref name="krauss"&gt;{{Cite news
 |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/01/opinion/01krauss.html

}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the idea of sending astronauts aloft never to return may be jarring upon first hearing, the rationale for one-way exploration and settlement trips has both historical and practical roots. For example, colonists and pilgrims seldom set off to the New World without the expectation of a return trip. As Lawrence Krauss writes, "To boldly go where no one has gone before does not require coming home again."

&lt;blockquote&gt;If it sounds unrealistic to suggest that astronauts would be willing to leave home never to return ... consider the results of several informal surveys I and several colleagues have conducted recently. One of my peers in [[Arizona]] recently accompanied a group of scientists and engineers from the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] on a geological survey. He asked how many would be willing to go on a one-way mission into space. Every member of the group raised their hand.&lt;ref name="krauss" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Additional immediate and pragmatic reasons to consider one-way human space exploration missions are explored by Krauss. Since much of the cost of a voyage to Mars will be spent on returning to Earth, if the fuel for the return is carried on board, this greatly increases the mission mass requirement – that in turn requires even more fuel. According to Krauss, "Human space travel is so expensive and so dangerous ... we are going to need novel, even extreme solutions if we really want to expand the range of human civilization beyond our own planet." Delivering food and supplies to pioneers via unmanned spacecraft is less expensive than designing an immediate return trip.

In an earlier 2004 op-ed for the ''New York Times'', [[Paul Davies]] says motivation for the less expensive, permanent "one-way to stay option" arises from a theme common in "Mars to Stay" advocacy: "Mars is one of the few accessible places beyond Earth that could have sustained life [...&amp;nbsp;and] alone among our sister planets, it is able to support a permanent human presence."&lt;ref name= "davies"/&gt;

{{quote|Why is going to Mars so expensive? ... It takes a lot of fuel to blast off Mars and get back home. If the propellant has to be transported there from Earth, costs of a launching soar.

Without some radical improvements in technology, the prospects for sending astronauts on a round-trip to Mars any time soon are slim, whatever the presidential rhetoric. What's more, the president's suggestion of using the Moon as a base — a place to assemble equipment and produce fuel for a Mars mission less expensively — has the potential to turn into a costly sideshow. There is, however, an obvious way to slash the costs and bring Mars within reach of early manned exploration. The answer lies with a one-way mission.&lt;ref name= "davies"&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Davies argues that since "some people gleefully dice with death in the name of sport or adventure [and since] dangerous occupations that reduce life expectancy through exposure to hazardous conditions or substances are commonplace", we ought to not find the risks involved in a Mars to Stay architecture unusual. "A century ago, explorers set out to trek across Antarctica in the full knowledge that they could die in the process, and that even if they succeeded their health&lt;ref name="WIRED-20140212" /&gt; might be irreversibly harmed. Yet governments and scientific societies were willing sponsors of these enterprises." Davies then asks, "Why should it be different today?"&lt;ref name= "davies"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6557">In [[philosophical]] [[ontology]], '''ontic''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ὄν}}, genitive {{lang|grc|ὄντος}}: "of that which is") is physical, real, or factual existence.&lt;br&gt;

==Overview==
"Ontic" describes what is there, as opposed to the nature or properties of that being. To illustrate:

*[[Roger Bacon]], observing that all languages are built upon a common grammar, stated that they share a foundation of ontically anchored linguistic structures.
*[[Martin Heidegger]] posited the concept of ''Sorge'', or caring, as the fundamental concept of the [[intentionality|intentional being]], and presupposed an ontological significance that distinguishes [[ontology|ontological]] being from mere "thinghood" of an ontic being. He uses the [[German language|German]] word "[[Dasein]]" for a being that is capable of ontology, that is, [[recursivity|recursively]] comprehending [[property (philosophy)|properties]] of the very fact of its own Being. For Heidegger, "ontical" signifies concrete, specific realities, whereas "ontological" signifies deeper underlying structures of reality. Ontological objects or subjects have an ontical dimension, but they also include aspects of being like self-awareness, evolutionary vestiges, future potentialities, and networks of relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ontico-Ontological Distinction|url=http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405106795_chunk_g978140510679516_ss1-33|publisher=Blackwell Reference|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Duffy|first1=Michael|title=The Ontological and the Ontic|url=http://mikejohnduff.blogspot.com/2007/08/ontological.html|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Nicolai Hartmann]] distinguishes among ontology, ontics, and metaphysics: (i) ontology concerns the categorical analysis of entities by means of the knowledge categories able to classify them, (ii) ontics refers to a pre-categorical and pre-objectual connection which is best expressed in the relation to transcendent acts, and (iii) metaphysics is that part of ontics or that part of ontology which concerns the residue of being that cannot be rationalized further according to categories.

== Philosophy of science ==
[[Harald Atmanspacher]] writes extensively about the philosophy of science, especially as it relates to [[Chaos theory]], [[determinism]], [[Causality|causation]], and [[stochastic process|stochasticity]]. He explains that "''ontic'' states describe all properties of a physical system exhaustively. ('Exhaustive' in this context means that an ''ontic'' state is 'precisely the way it is,' without any reference to [[epistemic]] knowledge or ignorance.)"{{ref|autonumber}}

In an earlier paper, Atmanspacher portrays the difference between an [[epistemic]] perspective of a [[system]], and an ontic perspective:

:Philosophical [[discourse]] traditionally distinguishes between [[ontology]] and [[epistemology]] and generally enforces this distinction by keeping the two subject areas separated. However, the relationship between the two areas is of central importance to [[physics]] and [[philosophy of physics]]. For instance, many [[measurement]]-related problems force us to consider both our [[knowledge]] of the [[Classical mechanics|states]] and [[observables]] of a [[system]] ([[epistemic perspective]]) and its states and observables, independent of such knowledge (ontic perspective). This applies to [[quantum|quantum systems]] in particular.{{ref|autonumber}}

== Critical realism ==
{{noref-section|date=August 2018}}
The [[United Kingdom|British]] [[philosopher]] [[Roy Bhaskar]], who is closely associated with the philosophical [[Cultural movement|movement]] of [[Critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]] writes:
:"I differentiate the 'ontic' ('ontical' etc.) from the 'ontological'. I employ the former to refer to

:# whatever pertains to being generally, rather than some distinctively philosophical (or scientific) theory of it (ontology), so that in this sense, that of the '''ontic&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''', we can speak of the ontic presuppositions of a work of art, a [[joke]] or a strike as much as a [[epistemology|theory of knowledge]]; and, within this [[rubric]], to
:# the [[intransitive]] [[object (philosophy)|object]]s of some specific, [[historically determinate]], [[scientific investigation]] (or set of such investigations), the '''ontic&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

:"The ontic&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is always specified, and only identified, by its relation, as the intransitive object(s) of some or other (denumerable set of) particular transitive process(es) of enquiry. It is cognitive process-, and level-specific; whereas the ontological (like the ontic&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) is not."{{ref|autonumber}}

[[Ruth Groff]] offers this expansion of Bhaskar's note above:
:"'ontic&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;' is an abstract way of denoting the [[object-domain]] of a particular [[scientific]] area, field, or inquiry. E.g.: [[molecules]] feature in the ontic&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of chemistry. He's just saying that the scientific undertaking ITSELF is not one of the objects of said, most narrowly construed, immediate object-domain. So [[chemistry]] itself is not part of the ontic&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of chemistry."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8293">'''Oppressors–oppressed distinction''' or '''dominant-dominated opposition''' is a political concept. One of the first theorists to use it was [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], who wrote in his 1802 ''The German Constitution'': "The Catholics had been in the position of oppressors, and the Protestants of the oppressed".&lt;ref&gt;Translated by H B Nisbet for Cambridge University Press. Original quote: {{quotation|Die Katholiken hatten die Stellung von Unterdrückern, die Protestanten die der Unterdrückten}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Marx]] made the concept very influential, and it is often considered a fundamental element of [[Marxist analysis]].&lt;ref name="Kauppi96p61"&gt;Kauppi (1996) p.61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Derrida94p55"&gt;Derrida (1994), ch.2 Conjurying--Marxism p.55&lt;/ref&gt; Some have judged it simplistic.&lt;ref name="Derrida94p55"/&gt; Many authors have adapted it to other contexts, including [[Friedrich Engels]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[Simone Weil]], [[Paulo Freire]] and others. It has been used in a variety of contexts, including discussions of the [[bourgeoisie]] and [[proletariat]], [[imperialism]], and [[self-determination]].&lt;ref name="Halabi04"&gt;Halabi (2004) pp.59, 74-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gordon (1991) p.145&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imperialism and self-determination ==
The theory of oppressor and oppressed nations has been part of Lenin's thought on imperialism, self-determination and criticisms of Social Democrats.&lt;ref name="Lenin 1927"&gt;Lenin (1927)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=March 2011}}

{{quote|"That is why the focal point in the Social-Democratic programme must be that division of nations into oppressor and oppressed which forms the essence of imperialism, and is deceitfully evaded by the social-chauvinists and Kautsky. This division is not significant from the angle of bourgeois pacifism or the philistine Utopia of peaceful competition among independent nations under capitalism, but it is most significant from the angle of the revolutionary struggle against imperialism"|Lenin, V.I, "The Revolutionary Proletariat and the Right of Nations to Self-Determination", ''Lenin Miscellany VI''&lt;ref name="Lenin 1927"/&gt;}}

==Criticism==

The political philosopher [[Kenneth Minogue]] provides a criticism of the oppressors-oppressed distinction in his work ''The Pure Theory of Ideology''. In the book's introduction, Minogue resumes the problem of the dialectical concept of oppression:

{{quote|"Have I really been in a battle?" wondered Stendhal's hero after many hours blundering around the field of Waterloo, and many people today share a similar perplexity. Like Stendhal's hero, they eat and drink and sustain the business of life, but the meaning of it all depends upon their conviction of contributing to the liberation of workers, women, the colonized, or other varieties of the oppressed. Like Fabrizio del Dongo, they find a regiment and tag along—the Hussars against Patriarchy, the Dragoon Guards of the Proletariat, and so on. Quite where the real battle lies is hotly disputed, but its significance is agreed to be a final end to oppression.
For these are people who believe that the term "oppression" is not merely a useful component of our rhetoric of grievances, but reveals the systematic character of how we live. As a typical formulation has it, plucked at random from a vast literature, "So long as some groups in society dominate others, the problem of conflict between persons and groups will remain." Or again: "Only a planet freed from class division and imperial exploitation, in which liberty and equality were common international realities, could be a peaceful environment for the human race." The lived texture of an ideological life, then, is to be found in the endeavors of millions to improve the world. There can be no doubt that this experience has been central to the last century and more.
My concern, however, is not with this lived experience but with what I identify as its central idea. The idea is so abstract that it is less a doctrine than a machine for generating doctrines, and its simplest formulation is that all evils are caused by an oppressive system. One of its more important corollaries is that truth is a weapon. This is the pure theory of ideology, and my aim is to explore its logical and rhetorical character.

[...]
My aim has been to present a critical map of the terrain, where "critical" means an attention to incoherence, tension, and contradiction, an attention, that is to say, to what I take to be the real connections of ideas. Here again, there is an ideological defense in depth, symbolized by the daring foray in which the very epithet "critical" has been appropriated as an ideological shibboleth and domesticated to mean any enquiry into social reality which, by probing the things technically called "contradictions," reveals it as an oppressive structure. The ideologist thus becomes critical ex officio. Those of us striving to join this desirable regiment by our own exertions thus find that we are rejected on the ground that to criticize those already known to be critical is to serve the interests of the status quo. The critic of criticism must be an apologist. Criticism, yoked to a fixed set of conclusions, turns into an orthodoxy.
My argument, then, is an exploration of the hypothesis that there is a pure theory of ideology, and while from one point of view it is a critique, from another it is a do-it-yourself ideology kit. It begins with some suggestions about how ideology was generated from eighteenth-century social theory. The long central section is an attempt to characterize ideologies as forms of understanding. The last section develops the view that, although ideology must take on political trappings in order to transform the world, its real character is entirely antithetical to the practice of politics. Ideology is to reality, I suggest, as (in Tolstoy's opinion) the reports of battles are to the concrete experience of individuals in the field. In ideological moods, we think we see in social and political life those clear lines from the history books depicting the battle order of the antagonists in massed array. They have neat, clear names like bourgeois and proletarian, colonialist and national, city-dweller and producer, in a word, oppressor and oppressed. The actual reality, however, is messy. Things change all the time, and it becomes impossible to keep any clear and distinct identities in focus. Confronting the arguments of ideology, we are forced to transform the Stendhalian question: Is it really a battle that we are in?

'''Paul Martin Laurence Weston''' (born 1965) is a British [[Far-right politics|far-right]] politician&lt;ref name=tele&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/10792895/Election-candidate-arrested-over-Churchill-speech.html|title=Election candidate arrested over Churchill speech|author=Martin Evans|date=28 April 2014|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a member of the [[Pegida UK]] leadership team. An activist and blogger, Weston joined the [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP) in 2010 and stood as a Parliamentary candidate for [[Cities of London and Westminster (UK Parliament constituency)|Cities of London and Westminster]].  In 2011, Weston left UKIP and joined the now-defunct [[British Freedom Party]] with members of the [[English Defence League]] (EDL) and former members of the [[British National Party]] (BNP).&lt;ref name=ind111125&gt;{{cite news|title=English Defence League prepares to storm local elections |newspaper= [[The Independent]] |date= 25 November 2011 | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/english-defence-league-prepares-to-storm-local-elections-6267740.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the chairman of [[Liberty GB]] before the party was dissolved in December 2017, recommending its members to join [[For Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://libertygb.org.uk/news/closure-liberty-gb|title=The Closure of Liberty GB - Liberty GB|website=libertygb.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Liberty GB, he was a candidate for [[South East England (European Parliament constituency)|South East England]] in the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (United Kingdom)|2014 European election]]&lt;ref name=profile&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul Weston | publisher=Liberty GB | url=http://www.libertygb.org.uk/content/paul-weston}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for [[Luton South (UK Parliament constituency)|Luton South]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]]. He obtained 158 votes (0.4%).&lt;ref name=BBC15&gt;''BBC News Election 2015'': [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/E14000801 Luton South]. Accessed 12 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

He married a Romanian after meeting her in [[Romania]].&lt;ref name=tele/&gt;&lt;ref name=p100505&gt;{{cite news|title= Interview with Paul Weston | date=5 May 2010 | url=http://www.politics.co.uk/comment-analysis/2010/5/5/interview-paul-weston|author=Marina Kim|website=politics.co.uk|publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the President of the English branch of the [[International Free Press Society]] founded in 2009.&lt;ref name="Hope Not Hate Profile: Paul Weston"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hopenothate.org.uk/counter-jihad/country/UK#id-135|title=UK has biggest audience for online jihadist propaganda in Europe |date=20 September 2017|publisher=HOPE not hate|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First partisan forays==
When interviewed in 2010 as a member of UKIP, Weston described himself as a "natural Conservative" and described immigration as the "[[ethnic cleansing]] of the [[English people|English]]".&lt;ref name= p100505/&gt; At the time Weston was standing as the UKIP candidate for [[Cities of London and Westminster (UK Parliament constituency)|Cities of London and Westminster]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|UK general election of 2010]]. With a 1.8% share of the vote Weston finished in fifth place. The Conservative candidate, [[Mark Field]], won the seat with 19,264 votes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/constituency/b11.stm "Cities of London and Westminster 2010 election results"], ''BBC News''&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after leaving UKIP, in 2011 Weston became the chairman of the [[British Freedom Party]] (BFP) the same year after he had been asked to do so by the activists who had broken away from the BNP in October 2010 to found a new party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hopenothate.org.uk/counter-jihad/country/UK#id-106|title=UK has biggest audience for online jihadist propaganda in Europe – HOPE not hate|date=20 September 2017|publisher=|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, Weston has attended and addressed numerous gatherings and rallies for such groups as [[Bloc Identitaire]] in France, [[Freedom (German political party)|Die Freiheit]] in Germany and the [[Jewish Defence League]] in Canada.&lt;ref name="Hope Not Hate Profile: Paul Weston"/&gt; As chairman of the BFP, Weston attended an international conference of [[Counterjihad|counter-jihadists]] in September 2011. Yet in an interview, Weston cited a poll conducted by ''[[Searchlight (magazine)|Searchlight]]'', which had found that 48% of the British public would support an [[Opposition to immigration|anti-immigrant party]], so long as the party did not take on explicitly [[fascist symbolism|fascist regalia]] and was non-violent, as evidence for an electoral basis for the BFP.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/feb/27/support-poll-support-far-right "Searchlight poll finds huge support for far right 'if they gave up violence'"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 26 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; This was in the midst of a crisis within the BNP and Weston held meetings with [[Andrew Brons]], an [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]], and longstanding figure on the far-right, who was vying for the leadership of the party. Ultimately, Weston left the BFP saying, "I joined the British Freedom Party in late 2011, but became disillusioned with the direction it was taking, over which I had little control."&lt;ref name=profile/&gt;

In November 2012, the BFP officially announced that it had agreed to enter into a formal political alliance with the [[English Defence League]]. In October 2012, the party failed to hand-in its annual registration form and pay the fee of £25 and, in December of the same year, was deregistered by the [[Electoral Commission]]. The deregistration was statutory rather than voluntary.&lt;ref name=truth&gt;Sonia Gable, [http://www.searchlightmagazine.com/blogs/searchlight-blog/british-freedom-party-deregistration-the-truth-%E2%80%93-exclusive "British Freedom Party deregistration: the truth"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231134443/http://www.searchlightmagazine.com/blogs/searchlight-blog/british-freedom-party-deregistration-the-truth-%E2%80%93-exclusive |date=31 December 2012 }}, ''Searchlight''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i.imgur.com/WS9hx.png|title=Extract from Register of Political Parties|publisher=|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Searchlight'' speculated that Weston let the party's registration lapse because [[Jim Dowson]] of [[Britain First]] had initiated legal action against the BFP for [[defamation]] over claims made against Britain First's leadership on the BFP website.&lt;ref name=truth/&gt;

==Liberty GB==
{{main article|Liberty GB}}
Early on, the group was criticised as "old fascist rubbish" in an article by Sonia Gable published in ''Searchlight''.&lt;ref name="Sonia Gable"&gt;{{cite web |newspaper=[[Searchlight (magazine)|Searchlight]] |author=Sonia Gable |title=Liberty it isn't |date=12 March 2013 |url=http://www.searchlightmagazine.com/blogs/searchlight-blog/liberty-it-isn%E2%80%99t |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503134607/http://www.searchlightmagazine.com/blogs/searchlight-blog/liberty-it-isn%E2%80%99t |archivedate=3 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gable ranked the group alongside the [[British Democratic Party (2013)|British Democratic Party]], [[Britain First]] and the [[National Front (UK)|National Front]].&lt;ref name="Sonia Gable"/&gt; Weston responded and accused his critics at ''Searchlight'' of being "a [[Communist front (epithet)|communist front operation]] disguised as an [[anti-fascist]] organisation". Weston has characterized himself as an "Islamo-realist" and is against Muslim people being able to hold [[public office]] in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=smaller&gt;{{cite news |publisher=BBC News |date=9 April 2015 |title=Election 2015 smaller parties: Liberty GB |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-32236889 |accessdate=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has made a video in which he says "I am a racist".&lt;ref name=smaller/&gt; In an interview, the [[BBC]]'s [[Andrew Neil]] brought up the subject of this video and asked him, "Do you regard yourself as a racist?" Weston responded, "No I don't, no." Weston explained that he was indignant about the gang rape that [[Rotherham child sexual exploitation scandal|took place in Rotherham]] [[Rochdale sex trafficking gang|and Rochdale]] and the fact that people sometimes fear being labeled racist. He then said, "If you watch the entire video, it is actually making the point that you cannot be quiet about what's going on because you're afraid of one word. It is better to speak out and be honest."&lt;ref name=smaller/&gt;

The other Liberty GB candidates in the [[South East England (European Parliament constituency)|South East England]] 2014 election were Enza Ferreri and [[Jack Buckby]]. In 2012, Buckby founded the "National Culturists" while at university in [[Liverpool]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/jack-buckby-is-proud-to-be-britains-next-nick-griffin "Jack Buckby is proud to be Britain's next Nick Griffin"], ''Vice''&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Buckby was a member of the BNP and received support from [[Nick Griffin]] after he and his group were prevented from advertising themselves at the freshers' fair by [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist demonstrators]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://liverpool.tab.co.uk/2012/10/01/controversial-society-meets-violent-resistance-at-freshers-fair/ "'Nazi Society' Hounded off Campus"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503230338/http://liverpool.tab.co.uk/2012/10/01/controversial-society-meets-violent-resistance-at-freshers-fair/ |date=3 May 2014 }}, ''Liverpool Tab''&lt;/ref&gt; Buckby was later invited to speak at the [[Alliance of European National Movements]] and introduced by Griffin.

At the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]], Weston contested [[Luton South (UK Parliament constituency)|Luton South]] for Liberty GB and polled 158 votes (0.4%).&lt;ref name="BBC15"/&gt;

===Arrest===
[[File:WinGuild30Je6-4864.jpg|thumb|Steps of Winchester Guildhall on which Weston was arrested.]]
On 26 April 2014, Weston was arrested on the steps of the [[Winchester]] Guildhall for failing to comply with a dispersal notice issued under section 27 of the [[Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006]] as he was reading out a passage from [[Winston Churchill]]'s 1899 book ''[[The River War]]'' that is critical of Islam. He had been reported to the police by a member of the public after they had asked him if he had permission to give the speech and he replied that he did not. At the police station Weston was then rearrested for a racially aggravated offence under section 4 of the [[Public Order Act 1986]], compounded with a [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]] section 31 [[Fear or provocation of violence|racially aggravated public order offence]], and was bailed to return to Winchester Police on 24 May.&lt;ref name=tele/&gt;

===Aftermath of arrest===
In the days after, the story was picked up by news outlets. In ''The Telegraph'', [[Daniel Hannan]], an MEP for [[South East England (European Parliament constituency)|South East England]], whom Weston was running against at the time, asked: "Why should it fall to me to defend him? Where are the lion-hearted liberals who are so quick to denounce political arrests in distant dictatorships? I realise that 'political arrest' is a strong phrase, but it's hard to think of any other way to describe a candidate for public office being taken into police custody because of objections to the content of his pitch."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Hannan, [https://web.archive.org/web/20140701051722/http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/danielhannan/100269400/britain-has-just-witnessed-a-political-arrest-where-is-the-liberal-outrage/ "Britain has just witnessed a political arrest. Where is the liberal outrage?"], ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', 29 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hampshire Police and Crime Commissioner]] [[Simon Hayes (police commissioner)|Simon Hayes]] responded to the media coverage on the Hampshire Police and Crime Commission website:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It has been wrongly suggested that Mr Weston was arrested for reciting passages written by Winston Churchill. I understand he was not welcome outside the Winchester Guildhall, the Police were called and he was asked to move on. I also understand that he was not prepared to move on and was arrested for this reason.

Members of the public are of course at liberty to debate issues of importance to them in private or public spaces. However, there must be a level of decorum and decency.

Hampshire Constabulary has an obligation to ensure action is taken if decency or safety is put at risk and, if there is any reason to suspect they have intervened unnecessary {{sic}}, this will be investigated.

As far as I am aware, this is not so in this case. With the local and European elections coming up, it is important to register that there is a great deal of politically motivated spin going on at the moment which it {{sic}} is having a significant impact on local policing – both in terms of vital frontline rescourse {{sic}} and reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Response to the Arrest of Paul Weston |author=Hampshire Police Commissioner Simon Hayes |url=http://www.hampshire-pcc.gov.uk/Your-Commissioner/Commissioners-point-of-view/Response-to-the-arrest-of-Paul-Weston.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503133051/http://www.hampshire-pcc.gov.uk/Your-Commissioner/Commissioners-point-of-view/Response-to-the-arrest-of-Paul-Weston.aspx |archivedate=3 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Simple Periodic Table Chart-en.svg|thumb|upright=2]]

The '''periodic table''', or '''periodic table of elements''', is a tabular arrangement of the [[chemical element]]s, ordered by their [[atomic number]], [[electron configuration]], and recurring [[Chemical property|chemical properties]], whose structure shows ''[[periodic trends]]''. Generally, within one row (period) the elements are [[metal]]s to the left, and [[non-metals]] to the right, with the elements having similar chemical behaviours placed in the same column. Table rows are commonly called [[Periodic table period|periods]] and columns are called [[Group (periodic table)|groups]]. Six groups have accepted names as well as assigned numbers: for example, group 17 elements are the [[halogen]]s; and group 18 are the [[noble gas]]es. Also displayed are four simple rectangular areas or [[block (periodic table)|blocks]] associated with the filling of different [[atomic orbital]]s.

The organization of the periodic table can be used to derive relationships between the various element properties, but also the predicted chemical properties and behaviours of undiscovered or newly synthesized elements. Russian chemist [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] was the first to publish a recognizable periodic table in 1869, developed mainly to illustrate periodic trends of the then-known elements. He also predicted some properties of [[Dmitri Mendeleev's predicted elements|unidentified elements]] that were expected to fill gaps within the table. Most of his forecasts proved to be correct. Mendeleev's idea has been slowly expanded and refined with [[element discovery|the discovery or synthesis of further new elements]] and the development of new theoretical models to explain chemical behaviour. The modern periodic table now provides a useful framework for analyzing [[chemical reactions]], and continues to be widely used in [[chemistry]], [[nuclear physics]] and other sciences.

All the elements from atomic numbers 1 ([[hydrogen]]) through 118 ([[oganesson]]) have been either discovered or synthesized, completing the first seven rows of the periodic table.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-35220823|title=Chemistry: Four elements added to periodic table|newspaper=BBC News|date=January 4, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104125144/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-35220823|archivedate=4 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Nicholas|last=St. Fleur|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/01/science/periodic-table-new-elements.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fscience&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=science&amp;region=rank&amp;module=package&amp;version=highlights&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=sectionfront|title=Four New Names Officially Added to the Periodic Table of Elements|work=New York Times|date=December 1, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170814221055/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/01/science/periodic-table-new-elements.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fscience&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=science&amp;region=rank&amp;module=package&amp;version=highlights&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=sectionfront|archivedate=14 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first 98 elements exist in nature, although some are found only in trace amounts and others were synthesized in laboratories before being found in nature.{{#tag:ref|The elements discovered initially by synthesis and later in nature are technetium (Z=43), promethium (61), astatine (85), neptunium (93), plutonium (94), americium (95), curium (96), berkelium (97) and californium (98).|group=n}} Elements 99 to 118 have only been synthesized in laboratories or nuclear reactors.&lt;ref name="emsley"&gt;{{cite book|last=Emsley|first=J.|title=Nature's Building Blocks: An A-Z Guide to the Elements|edition=New|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-19-960563-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The synthesis of elements having higher atomic numbers is currently being pursued: these elements would begin an [[extended periodic table|eighth row]], and theoretical work has been done to suggest possible candidates for this extension.

==Overview==
{{for|a more detailed periodic table|Periodic table (large cells)}}
{{Periodic table}}

Each chemical element has a unique atomic number (''Z'') representing the number of protons in its nucleus.{{#tag:ref|An [[neutronium|element zero]] (i.e. a substance composed purely of neutrons), is included in a few alternate presentations, for example, in the [[Chemical Galaxy]].|group=n}} Most elements have differing numbers of [[neutron]]s among different atoms, with these variants being referred to as [[isotope]]s. For example, carbon has three naturally occurring isotopes: all of its atoms have six protons and most have six neutrons as well, but about one per cent have seven neutrons, and a very small fraction have eight neutrons. Isotopes are never separated in the periodic table; they are always grouped together under a single element. Elements with no stable isotopes have the atomic masses of their most stable isotopes, where such masses are shown, listed in parentheses.&lt;ref name="Greenwood"&gt;Greenwood &amp; Earnshaw, pp. 24–27&lt;/ref&gt;

In the standard periodic table, the elements are listed in order of increasing atomic number ''Z'' (the number of [[proton]]s in the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] of an atom). A new row ([[Period (periodic table)|''period'']]) is started when a new [[electron shell]] has its first electron. Columns ([[Group (periodic table)|''groups'']]) are determined by the [[electron configuration]] of the atom; elements with the same number of electrons in a particular subshell fall into the same columns (e.g. [[oxygen]] and [[selenium]] are in the same column because they both have four electrons in the outermost p-subshell). Elements with similar chemical properties generally fall into the same group in the periodic table, although in the f-block, and to some respect in the d-block, the elements in the same period tend to have similar properties, as well. Thus, it is relatively easy to predict the chemical properties of an element if one knows the properties of the elements around it.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Asof|2016}}, the periodic table has 118 confirmed elements, from element 1 (hydrogen) to 118 (oganesson). Elements 113, 115, 117 and 118, the most recent discoveries, were officially confirmed by the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) in December 2015. Their proposed names, nihonium (Nh), moscovium (Mc), tennessine (Ts) and oganesson (Og) respectively, were announced by the IUPAC in June 2016 and made official in November 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/08/health/periodic-table-new-elements-names/index.html|title=New elements on the periodic table are named|last=CNN|first=Ashley Strickland|website=CNN|access-date=2016-06-11|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610215843/http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/08/health/periodic-table-new-elements-names/index.html|archivedate=10 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iupac.org/discovery-and-assignment-of-elements-with-atomic-numbers-113-115-117-and-118/|title=Discovery and assignment of elements with atomic numbers 113, 115, 117 and 118|publisher=[[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]]|date=2015-12-30|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160613223413/http://iupac.org/discovery-and-assignment-of-elements-with-atomic-numbers-113-115-117-and-118/|archivedate=13 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/06/09/481410462/hello-nihonium-scientists-name-4-new-elements-on-the-periodic-table|title=Hello, Nihonium.

The first 94 elements occur naturally; the remaining 24, americium to oganesson (95–118), occur only when synthesized in laboratories. Of the 94 naturally occurring elements, 83 are [[primordial element|primordial]] and 11 occur only in decay chains of primordial elements.&lt;ref name="emsley"/&gt; No element heavier than einsteinium (element 99) has ever been observed in macroscopic quantities in its pure form, nor has astatine (element 85); francium (element 87) has been only photographed in the form of light emitted from microscopic quantities (300,000 atoms).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Chemistry of the Actinide and Transactinide Elements| editor1-last = Morss| editor1-first=L.

==Grouping methods==

===Groups===
{{Main|Group (periodic table)}}
A ''group'' or ''family'' is a vertical column in the periodic table. Groups usually have more significant periodic trends than periods and blocks, explained below. Modern quantum mechanical theories of atomic structure explain group trends by proposing that elements within the same group generally have the same electron configurations in their [[valence shell]].&lt;ref&gt;Scerri 2007, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, elements in the same group tend to have a shared chemistry and exhibit a clear trend in properties with increasing atomic number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Messler|first=R. W.|title=The essence of materials for engineers|year=2010|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers|location=Sudbury, MA|isbn=978-0-7637-7833-0|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some parts of the periodic table, such as the d-block and the f-block, horizontal similarities can be as important as, or more pronounced than, vertical similarities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bagnall|first=K. W.|year=1967|contribution=Recent advances in actinide and lanthanide chemistry|title=Advances in chemistry, Lanthanide/Actinide chemistry|volume=71|pages=1–12|publisher=American Chemical Society|doi=10.1021/ba-1967-0071|editor1-first=P.

C., Jr.|last2=Selbin|first2=J.|title=Theoretical inorganic chemistry|year=1969|publisher=Nostrand-Rienhold Book Corporation|edition=2nd|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7637-7833-0|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Holman|first1=J.|last2=Hill|first2=G.

Under an international naming convention, the groups are numbered numerically from 1 to 18 from the leftmost column (the alkali metals) to the rightmost column (the noble gases).&lt;ref name="IUPAC"&gt;{{cite book |title=Nomenclature of Inorganic Chemistry: IUPAC Recommendations 2005|last1=Connelly |first1=N.

In America, the roman numerals were followed by either an "A" if the group was in the [[s-block|s-]] or [[p-block]], or a "B" if the group was in the [[d-block]]. The roman numerals used correspond to the last digit of today's naming convention (e.g. the [[group 4 element]]s were group IVB, and the [[group 14 element]]s were group IVA). In Europe, the lettering was similar, except that "A" was used if the group was before [[group 10 elements|group 10]], and "B" was used for groups including and after group 10. In addition, groups 8, 9 and 10 used to be treated as one triple-sized group, known collectively in both notations as group VIII. In 1988, the new IUPAC naming system was put into use, and the old group names were deprecated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fluck |first1=E. |year=1988 |title=New Notations in the Periodic Table |journal=[[Pure and Applied Chemistry|Pure Appl. Chem.]] |volume=60 |pages=431–436 |doi=10.1351/pac198860030431 |url=http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1988/pdf/6003x0431.pdf |accessdate=24 March 2012 |issue=3 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325152951/http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/1988/pdf/6003x0431.pdf |archivedate=25 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these groups have been given [[Collective names of groups of like elements|trivial (unsystematic) names]], as seen in the table below, although some are rarely used. Groups 3–10 have no trivial names and are referred to simply by their group numbers or by the name of the first member of their group (such as "the scandium group" for [[Group 3 element|group 3]]),&lt;ref name="IUPAC" /&gt; since they display fewer similarities and/or vertical trends.

Elements in the same group tend to show patterns in [[atomic radius]], [[ionization energy]], and [[electronegativity]]. From top to bottom in a group, the atomic radii of the elements increase. Since there are more filled energy levels, valence electrons are found farther from the nucleus. From the top, each successive element has a lower ionization energy because it is easier to remove an electron since the atoms are less tightly bound. Similarly, a group has a top-to-bottom decrease in electronegativity due to an increasing distance between valence electrons and the nucleus.&lt;ref name="For Dummies"&gt;Moore, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; There are exceptions to these trends: for example, in [[group 11 element|group 11]], electronegativity increases farther down the group.&lt;ref name="Greenwood30"/&gt;

{{Periodic table (group names)}}

===Periods===
{{Main|Period (periodic table)}}
A ''period'' is a horizontal row in the periodic table. Although groups generally have more significant periodic trends, there are regions where horizontal trends are more significant than vertical group trends, such as the f-block, where the [[lanthanide]]s and [[actinide]]s form two substantial horizontal series of elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Stoker|first=S. H.|title=General, organic, and biological chemistry|year=2007|page=68|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=New York|isbn=978-0-618-73063-6|oclc=52445586}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elements in the same period show trends in atomic radius, ionization energy, [[electron affinity]], and electronegativity. Moving left to right across a period, atomic radius usually decreases. This occurs because each successive element has an added proton and electron, which causes the electron to be drawn closer to the nucleus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mascetta |first=J. |title=Chemistry The Easy Way |year=2003|publisher=Hauppauge |location=New York |isbn=978-0-7641-1978-1 |oclc=52047235|edition=4th |page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decrease in atomic radius also causes the ionization energy to increase when moving from left to right across a period. The more tightly bound an element is, the more energy is required to remove an electron. Electronegativity increases in the same manner as ionization energy because of the pull exerted on the electrons by the nucleus.&lt;ref name="For Dummies"/&gt; Electron affinity also shows a slight trend across a period. Metals (left side of a period) generally have a lower electron affinity than nonmetals (right side of a period), with the exception of the noble gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kotz |first1=J. |last2=Treichel |first2=P.|last3=Townsend |first3=John |title=Chemistry and Chemical Reactivity, Volume 2|edition=7th |year=2009|publisher=Thomson Brooks/Cole |location=Belmont |isbn=978-0-495-38712-1 |oclc=220756597 |page=324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blocks===
{{Main|Block (periodic table)}}
[[File:Periodic table blocks spdf (32 column).svg|thumb|upright=1.6|Left to right: s-, f-, d-, p-block in the periodic table]]
Specific regions of the periodic table can be referred to as ''blocks'' in recognition of the sequence in which the electron shells of the elements are filled. Each block is named according to the subshell in which the "last" electron notionally resides.&lt;ref name="Gray12"/&gt;{{#tag:ref|There is an inconsistency and some irregularities in this convention. Thus, helium is shown in the p-block but is actually an s-block element, and (for example) the d-subshell in the d-block is actually filled by the time group 11 is reached, rather than group 12.|group=n}} The [[s-block]] comprises the first two groups (alkali metals and alkaline earth metals) as well as hydrogen and helium. The [[p-block]] comprises the last six groups, which are groups 13 to 18 in IUPAC group numbering (3A&amp;nbsp;to 8A in American group numbering) and contains, among other elements, all of the [[metalloid]]s. The [[d-block]] comprises groups 3 to 12 (or&amp;nbsp;3B to 2B in American group numbering) and contains all of the [[transition metals]]. The [[f-block]], often offset below the rest of the periodic table, has no group numbers and comprises lanthanides and actinides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first=C. |title=d- and f-block chemistry |year=2002 |publisher=J. Wiley &amp; Sons |location=New York |isbn=978-0-471-22476-1|oclc=300468713 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metals, metalloids and nonmetals===
[[File:Periodic table (metals–metalloids–nonmetals, 32 columns).png|upright=1.36|right|thumb
|{{legend inline|1={{element color|metals}}|2=Metals|border=none}}, {{legend inline|1={{element color|metalloids}}|2=metalloids|border=none}}, {{legend inline|1={{element color|nonmetals}}|2=nonmetals|border=none}}, and {{nowrap|{{legend inline|1={{element color|unknown chemical properties}}|2=elements with unknown chemical properties|border=none}}}} in the periodic table. Sources disagree on the classification of some of these elements.]]
According to their shared physical and chemical properties, the elements can be classified into the major categories of [[metal]]s, [[metalloid]]s and [[nonmetal]]s. Metals are generally shiny, highly conducting solids that form alloys with one another and salt-like ionic compounds with nonmetals (other than [[noble gas]]es). A majority of nonmetals are coloured or colourless insulating gases; nonmetals that form compounds with other nonmetals feature [[covalent bond]]ing. In between metals and nonmetals are metalloids, which have intermediate or mixed properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Silberberg|first=M. S.|title=Chemistry: The molecular nature of matter and change|year=2006|page=536|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|edition=4th|isbn=978-0-07-111658-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metal and nonmetals can be further classified into subcategories that show a gradation from metallic to non-metallic properties, when going left to right in the rows. The metals may be subdivided into the highly reactive alkali metals, through the less reactive alkaline earth metals, lanthanides and actinides, via the archetypal transition metals, and ending in the physically and chemically weak post-transition metals. Nonmetals may be simply subdivided into the [[Nonmetal#Polyatomic nonmetals|polyatomic nonmetals]], being nearer to the metalloids and show some incipient metallic character; the essentially nonmetallic [[Nonmetal#Diatomic nonmetals|diatomic nonmetals]], nonmetallic and the almost completely inert, monatomic noble gases. Specialized groupings such as [[refractory metals]] and [[noble metals]], are examples of subsets of transition metals, also known&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Manson|first1=S. S.|last2=Halford|first2=G. R.|title=Fatigue and durability of structural materials|year=2006|page=376|publisher=ASM International|location=Materials Park, Ohio|isbn=978-0-87170-825-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and occasionally denoted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bullinger|first=H-J.|title=Technology guide: Principles, applications, trends|year=2009|page=8|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-540-88545-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Placing elements into categories and subcategories based just on shared properties is imperfect. There is a large disparity of properties within each category with notable overlaps at the boundaries, as is the case with most classification schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones|first=B. W.|title=Pluto: Sentinel of the outer solar system|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-19436-5|pages=169–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beryllium, for example, is classified as an alkaline earth metal although its [[amphoterism|amphoteric]] chemistry and tendency to mostly form covalent compounds are both attributes of a chemically weak or post-transition metal. [[Radon]] is classified as a nonmetallic noble gas yet has some cationic chemistry that is characteristic of metals. Other classification schemes are possible such as the division of the elements into [[Goldschmidt classification|mineralogical occurrence categories]], or [[Periodic table (crystal structure)|crystalline structures]]. Categorizing the elements in this fashion dates back to at least 1869 when [[Gustavus Detlef Hinrichs|Hinrichs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hinrichs|first=G. D.|title=On the classification and the atomic weights of the so-called chemical elements, with particular reference to Stas's determinations|journal=Proceedings of the American Association for the Advancement of Science|year=1869|volume=18|issue=5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vj1SAAAAcAAJ|pages=112–124|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160802141046/https://books.google.com/books?id=vj1SAAAAcAAJ|archivedate=2 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote that simple boundary lines could be placed on the periodic table to show elements having shared properties, such as metals, nonmetals, or gaseous elements.

==Periodic trends and patterns==
{{Main|Periodic trends}}

===Electron configuration===
{{Main|Electronic configuration}}
[[File:Klechkovski rule.svg|upright=0.9|thumb|left|Approximate order in which shells and subshells are arranged by increasing energy according to the [[Madelung rule]]]]
The electron configuration or organisation of electrons orbiting neutral atoms shows a recurring pattern or periodicity. The electrons occupy a series of [[electron shell]]s (numbered 1, 2, and so on). Each shell consists of one or more [[Electron shell#Subshells|subshells]] (named s, p, d, f and g). As [[atomic number]] increases, electrons progressively fill these shells and subshells more or less according to the [[Madelung rule]] or energy ordering rule, as shown in the diagram. The electron configuration for [[neon]], for example, is 1s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 2s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 2p&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;. With an atomic number of ten, neon has two electrons in the first shell, and eight electrons in the second shell; there are two electrons in the s subshell and six in the p subshell. In periodic table terms, the first time an electron occupies a new shell corresponds to the start of each new period, these positions being occupied by [[hydrogen]] and the [[alkali metals]].&lt;ref name=Myers&gt;{{cite book |last=Myers|first=R.|title=The basics of chemistry|year=2003|pages=61–67|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|location=Westport, CT|isbn=978-0-313-31664-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chang2&gt;{{cite book |last=Chang|first=R.|title=Chemistry|year=2002|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|edition=7|isbn=978-0-07-112072-2|pages=289–310, 340–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Periodic trends.png|upright=1.35|thumb|right|Periodic table trends (arrows show an increase)]]

Since the properties of an element are mostly determined by its electron configuration, the properties of the elements likewise show recurring patterns or periodic behaviour, some examples of which are shown in the diagrams below for atomic radii, ionization energy and electron affinity. It is this periodicity of properties, manifestations of which [[Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner|were noticed well before]] the [[Niels Bohr|underlying theory was developed]], that led to the establishment of the periodic law (the properties of the elements recur at varying intervals) and the formulation of the first periodic tables.&lt;ref name=Myers/&gt;&lt;ref name=chang2/&gt;

===Atomic radii===
{{main|Atomic radius}}

Atomic radii vary in a predictable and explainable manner across the periodic table. For instance, the radii generally decrease along each period of the table, from the alkali metals to the noble gases; and increase down each group. The radius increases sharply between the noble gas at the end of each period and the alkali metal at the beginning of the next period. These trends of the atomic radii (and of various other chemical and physical properties of the elements) can be explained by the electron shell theory of the atom; they provided important evidence for the development and confirmation of [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]].&lt;ref name="Greenwood27"&gt;Greenwood &amp; Earnshaw, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

The electrons in the 4f-subshell, which is progressively filled across the [[lanthanide]] series, are not particularly effective at shielding the increasing nuclear charge from the sub-shells further out. The elements immediately following the lanthanides have atomic radii that are smaller than would be expected and that are almost identical to the atomic radii of the elements immediately above them.&lt;ref name="Jolly_contract"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence [[hafnium]] has virtually the same atomic radius (and chemistry) as [[zirconium]], and [[tantalum]] has an atomic radius similar to [[niobium]], and so forth. This is known as the [[lanthanide contraction]]. The effect of the lanthanide contraction is noticeable up to [[platinum]] (element 78), after which it is masked by a [[relativistic effect]] known as the [[inert pair effect]].&lt;ref name="Greenwood28"&gt;Greenwood &amp; Earnshaw, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; The [[d-block contraction]], which is a similar effect between the [[d-block]] and [[p-block]], is less pronounced than the lanthanide contraction but arises from a similar cause.&lt;ref name="Jolly_contract"/&gt;

===Ionization energy===
[[File:First Ionization Energy.svg|thumb|upright=2.27|right|Ionization energy: each period begins at a minimum for the alkali metals, and ends at a maximum for the noble gases]]

{{main|Ionization energy}}

The first ionization energy is the energy it takes to remove one electron from an atom, the second ionization energy is the energy it takes to remove a second electron from the atom, and so on. For a given atom, successive ionization energies increase with the degree of ionization. For magnesium as an example, the first ionization energy is 738&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol and the second is 1450&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol. Electrons in the closer orbitals experience greater forces of electrostatic attraction; thus, their removal requires increasingly more energy. Ionization energy becomes greater up and to the right of the periodic table.&lt;ref name="Greenwood28"/&gt;

Large jumps in the successive molar ionization energies occur when removing an electron from a noble gas (complete electron shell) configuration. For magnesium again, the first two molar ionization energies of magnesium given above correspond to removing the two 3s electrons, and the third ionization energy is a much larger 7730&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol, for the removal of a 2p electron from the very stable [[neon]]-like configuration of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Similar jumps occur in the ionization energies of other third-row atoms.&lt;ref name="Greenwood28"/&gt;

===Electronegativity===
{{main|Electronegativity}}

[[Image:Periodic variation of Pauling electronegativities.png|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Graph showing increasing electronegativity with growing number of selected groups]]

Electronegativity is the tendency of an [[atom]] to attract a shared pair of [[electron]]s.&lt;ref name="definition"&gt;{{GoldBookRef|file=E01990|title=Electronegativity}}&lt;/ref&gt; An atom's electronegativity is affected by both its [[atomic number]] and the distance between the [[valence electrons]] and the nucleus. The higher its electronegativity, the more an element attracts electrons. It was first proposed by [[Linus Pauling]] in 1932.&lt;ref name="paulingJACS"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Pauling, L. |authorlink=Linus Pauling |year= 1932 |journal= [[Journal of the American Chemical Society]] |volume= 54 |issue= 9 |pages= 3570–3582 |title= The Nature of the Chemical Bond. IV. The Energy of Single Bonds and the Relative Electronegativity of Atoms |doi= 10.1021/ja01348a011|bibcode=1932JAChS..54.2610C }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, electronegativity increases on passing from left to right along a period, and decreases on descending a group. Hence, [[fluorine]] is the most electronegative of the elements,{{#tag:ref|While fluorine is the most electronegative of the elements under the [[Pauling scale]], [[neon]] is the most electronegative element under other scales, such as the [[Allen scale]].|group=n}} while [[caesium]]&lt;!-- not francium; please don't change unless you supply a citation for published experimental results --&gt; is the least, at least of those elements for which substantial data is available.&lt;ref name="Greenwood30"&gt;Greenwood &amp; Earnshaw, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some exceptions to this general rule. Gallium and germanium have higher electronegativities than [[aluminium]] and [[silicon]] respectively because of the d-block contraction. Elements of the fourth period immediately after the first row of the transition metals have unusually small atomic radii because the 3d-electrons are not effective at shielding the increased nuclear charge, and smaller atomic size correlates with higher electronegativity.&lt;ref name="Greenwood30"/&gt; The anomalously high electronegativity of lead, particularly when compared to [[thallium]] and [[bismuth]], appears to be an artifact of data selection and data availability.  Methods of calculation other than the Pauling method show the normal periodic trends for these elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Allred |first=A. L. |year=1960 |title=Electronegativity values from thermochemical data |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022190261801425|journal=Journal of Inorganic and Nuclear Chemistry |volume=17 |issue=3–4 |pages=215–221 |doi=10.1016/0022-1902(61)80142-5 |accessdate=11 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electron affinity===
{{main|Electron affinity}}
[[File:Electron affinity of the elements.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|right|Dependence of electron affinity on atomic number.&lt;ref&gt;Huheey, Keiter &amp; Keiter, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Values generally increase across each period, culminating with the halogens before decreasing precipitously with the noble gases. Examples of localized peaks seen in hydrogen, the alkali metals and the [[group 11 elements]] are caused by a tendency to complete the s-shell (with the 6s shell of gold being further stabilized by relativistic effects and the presence of a filled 4f sub shell). Examples of localized troughs seen in the alkaline earth metals, and nitrogen, phosphorus, manganese and rhenium are caused by filled s-shells, or half-filled p- or d-shells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Siekierski|first1=S.|last2=Burgess|first2=J.|title=Concise chemistry of the elements|publisher=Horwood Publishing|location=Chichester|year=2002|isbn=978-1-898563-71-6|pages=35‒36}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The electron affinity of an atom is the amount of energy released when an electron is added to a neutral atom to form a negative ion. Although electron affinity varies greatly, some patterns emerge. Generally, [[nonmetals]] have more positive electron affinity values than [[metal]]s. [[Chlorine]] most strongly attracts an extra electron. The electron affinities of the noble gases have not been measured conclusively, so they may or may not have slightly negative values.&lt;ref name=chang&gt;Chang, pp. 307–309&lt;/ref&gt;

Electron affinity generally increases across a period. This is caused by the filling of the valence shell of the atom; a group 17 atom releases more energy than a group 1 atom on gaining an electron because it obtains a filled valence shell and is therefore more stable.&lt;ref name=chang/&gt;

A trend of decreasing electron affinity going down groups would be expected. The additional electron will be entering an orbital farther away from the nucleus. As such this electron would be less attracted to the nucleus and would release less energy when added. In going down a group, around one-third of elements are anomalous, with heavier elements having higher electron affinities than their next lighter congenors. Largely, this is due to the poor shielding by d and f electrons. A uniform decrease in electron affinity only applies to group 1 atoms.&lt;ref&gt;Huheey, Keiter &amp; Keiter, pp. 42, 880–81&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metallic character===
The lower the values of ionization energy, electronegativity and electron affinity, the more [[metal]]lic character the element has. Conversely, nonmetallic character increases with higher values of these properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Yoder |first1=C. H.|last2=Suydam|first2= F. H.|last3=Snavely|first3=F. A. |year=1975 |title=Chemistry |page=58 |edition=2nd |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |isbn=978-0-15-506465-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the periodic trends of these three properties, metallic character tends to decrease going across a period (or row) and, with some irregularities (mostly) due to poor screening of the nucleus by d and f electrons, and [[Relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]],&lt;ref&gt;Huheey, Keiter &amp; Keiter, pp. 880–85&lt;/ref&gt; tends to increase going down a group (or column or family). Thus, the most metallic elements (such as [[caesium]] and [[francium]]) are found at the bottom left of traditional periodic tables and the most nonmetallic elements ([[oxygen]], [[fluorine]], [[chlorine]]) at the top right. The combination of horizontal and vertical trends in metallic character explains the stair-shaped [[dividing line between metals and nonmetals]] found on some periodic tables, and the practice of sometimes categorizing several elements adjacent to that line, or elements adjacent to those elements, as [[metalloid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sacks|first=O.|title=Uncle Tungsten: Memories of a chemical boyhood|year=2009|publisher=Alfred A.

==History==
{{Main|History of the periodic table}}

===First systemization attempts===
[[File:Discovery of chemical elements.svg|upright=2.27|thumb|The [[discovery of the chemical elements|discovery of the elements]] mapped to significant periodic table development dates (pre-, per- and post-)]]
In 1789, [[Antoine Lavoisier]] published a list of 33 [[chemical element]]s, grouping them into [[gas]]es, [[metal]]s, [[nonmetal]]s, and [[Earth (chemistry)|earths]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=From elements to atoms a history of chemical composition |last=Siegfried |first=R. |year=2002 |page=92 |publisher=Library of Congress Cataloging-in-Publication Data |isbn=978-0-87169-924-4 |location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemists spent the following century searching for a more precise classification scheme. In 1829, [[Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner]] observed that many of the elements could be grouped into triads based on their chemical properties. [[Lithium]], [[sodium]], and [[potassium]], for example, were grouped together in a triad as soft, [[Reactivity (chemistry)|reactive]] metals. Döbereiner also observed that, when arranged by atomic weight, the second member of each triad was roughly the average of the first and the third;&lt;ref name="Ball100"&gt;Ball, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; this became known as the [[Döbereiner's triads|Law of Triads]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Horvitz |first=L.|title=Eureka!: Scientific Breakthroughs That Changed The World |year=2002 |publisher=John Wiley |location=New York|isbn=978-0-471-23341-1 |oclc=50766822 |page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; German chemist [[Leopold Gmelin]] worked with this system, and by 1843 he had identified ten triads, three groups of four, and one group of five. [[Jean-Baptiste Dumas]] published work in 1857 describing relationships between various groups of metals. Although various chemists were able to identify relationships between small groups of elements, they had yet to build one scheme that encompassed them all.&lt;ref name="Ball100"/&gt;

In 1857, German chemist [[Friedrich August Kekulé von Stradonitz|August Kekulé]] observed that [[carbon]] often has four other atoms bonded to it. [[Methane]], for example, has one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Über die s. g. gepaarten Verbindungen und die Theorie der mehratomigen Radicale|author=Aug. Kekulé|journal=[[Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie]]|year=1857|volume=104|issue=2|pages=129–150|doi= 10.1002/jlac.18571040202}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept eventually became known as [[Valence (chemistry)|valency]]; different elements bond with different numbers of atoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=van Spronsen|first=J. W.|title=The periodic system of chemical elements|year=1969|publisher=Elsevier|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-0-444-40776-4|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1862, [[Alexandre-Emile Béguyer de Chancourtois]], a French geologist, published an early form of periodic table, which he called the telluric helix or screw. He was the first person to notice the periodicity of the elements. With the elements arranged in a spiral on a cylinder by order of increasing atomic weight, de Chancourtois showed that elements with similar properties seemed to occur at regular intervals. His chart included some ions and compounds in addition to elements. His paper also used geological rather than chemical terms and did not include a diagram; as a result, it received little attention until the work of [[Dmitri Mendeleev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.annales.org/archives/x/chancourtois.html|publisher=Annales des Mines history page|title=Alexandre-Emile Bélguier de Chancourtois (1820–1886)|accessdate=18 September 2014|language=French|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141127153250/http://www.annales.org/archives/x/chancourtois.html|archivedate=27 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1864, [[Julius Lothar Meyer]], a German chemist, published a table with 44 elements arranged by valency. The table showed that elements with similar properties often shared the same valency.&lt;ref&gt;Venable, pp. 85–86, 97&lt;/ref&gt; Concurrently, English chemist [[William Odling]] published an arrangement of 57 elements, ordered on the basis of their atomic weights. With some irregularities and gaps, he noticed what appeared to be a periodicity of atomic weights among the elements and that this accorded with "their usually received groupings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Odling |first=W.|title=On the proportional numbers of the elements|journal=Quarterly Journal of Science|year=2002 |volume=1|pages=642–648 (643)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Odling alluded to the idea of a periodic law but did not pursue it.&lt;ref name="Scerri 2011"&gt;{{cite book |last=Scerri|first=E.|title=The periodic table: A very short introduction|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-958249-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently proposed (in 1870) a valence-based classification of the elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kaji |first=M. |editor1-first=D.

English chemist [[John Newlands (chemist)|John Newlands]] produced a series of papers from 1863 to 1866 noting that when the elements were listed in order of increasing atomic weight, similar physical and chemical properties recurred at intervals of eight; he likened such periodicity to the [[octave]]s of music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = On Relations Among the Equivalents |last = Newlands |first = J.

Russian chemistry professor [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] and German chemist [[Julius Lothar Meyer]] independently published their periodic tables in 1869 and 1870, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mendelejew |first=D.|year=1869 |title=Über die Beziehungen der Eigenschaften zu den Atomgewichten der Elemente |journal=Zeitschrift für Chemie |pages=405–406 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mendeleev's table was his first published version; that of Meyer was an expanded version of his (Meyer's) table of 1864.&lt;ref&gt;Venable, pp. 96–97; 100–102&lt;/ref&gt; They both constructed their tables by listing the elements in rows or columns in order of atomic weight and starting a new row or column when the characteristics of the elements began to repeat.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, pp. 100–102&lt;/ref&gt;

The recognition and acceptance afforded to Mendeleev's table came from two decisions he made. The first was to leave gaps in the table when it seemed that the corresponding element had not yet been discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pullman |first=B. |title=The Atom in the History of Human Thought |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1998 |page=227 |isbn=978-0-19-515040-7|others=Translated by Axel Reisinger}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mendeleev was not the first chemist to do so, but he was the first to be recognized as using the trends in his periodic table to predict the properties of those [[Mendeleev's predicted elements|missing elements]], such as [[gallium]] and [[germanium]].&lt;ref&gt;Ball, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; The second decision was to occasionally ignore the order suggested by the [[atomic weights]] and switch adjacent elements, such as [[tellurium]] and [[iodine]], to better classify them into [[Group (periodic table)|chemical families]].

Mendeleev published in 1869, using atomic weight to organize the elements, information determinable to fair precision in his time. Atomic weight worked well enough to allow Mendeleev to accurately predict the properties of missing elements.

Following the discovery, in 1911, by [[Ernest Rutherford]] of the atomic nucleus, it was proposed that the integer count of the nuclear charge is identical to the sequential place of each element in the periodic table. In 1913, [[Henry Moseley]] using [[X-ray spectroscopy]] confirmed this proposal experimentally. Moseley determined the value of the nuclear charge of each element, and showed that Mendeleev's ordering actually places the elements in sequential order by nuclear charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Periodic Kingdom |author=Atkins, P. W.|authorlink=P. W. Atkins |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers, Inc. |year=1995 |page=87|isbn=978-0-465-07265-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nuclear charge is identical to [[proton]] count, and determines the value of the [[atomic number]] (Z) of each element. Using atomic number gives a definitive, integer-based sequence for the elements. Moseley predicted, in 1913, that the only elements still missing between aluminium (Z=13) and gold (Z=79) were Z = 43, 61, 72, and 75, all of which were later discovered. The atomic number is the absolute definition of an [[Chemical element|element]], and gives a factual basis for the ordering of the periodic table. The periodic table is used to predict the properties of new synthetic elements before they are produced and studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Nucl. Phys.

In 1871, Mendeleev published his periodic table in a new form, with groups of similar elements arranged in columns rather than in rows, and those columns numbered I to VIII corresponding with the element's oxidation state. He also gave detailed predictions for the properties of elements he had earlier noted were missing, but should exist.&lt;ref&gt;Scerri 2007, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; These gaps were subsequently filled as chemists discovered additional naturally occurring elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kaji |first=M. |year=2002 |title=D.

The popular&lt;ref&gt;Gray, p.&amp;nbsp; 12&lt;/ref&gt; periodic table layout, also known as the common or standard form (as shown at various other points in this article), is attributable to Horace Groves Deming. In 1923, Deming, an American chemist, published short ([http://www.meta-synthesis.com/webbook/35_pt/pt_database.php?PT_id=456 Mendeleev style]) and medium ([http://www.meta-synthesis.com/webbook/35_pt/pt_database.php?PT_id=360 18-column]) form periodic tables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Deming|first=H.

With the development of modern [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] theories of [[electron]] configurations within atoms, it became apparent that each period (row) in the table corresponded to the filling of a [[electron shell|quantum shell]] of electrons. Larger atoms have more electron sub-shells, so later tables have required progressively longer periods.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, [[Glenn T. Seaborg|Glenn Seaborg]], an American scientist, made the suggestion that the [[actinides|actinide elements]], like the [[lanthanides]], were filling an f sub-level.

==Different periodic tables==

===The long- or 32-column table===
[[File:32-column periodic table-a.png|upright=2.95|thumb|The periodic table in 32-column format]]
The modern periodic table is sometimes expanded into its long or 32-column form by reinstating the footnoted f-block elements into their natural position between the s- and d-blocks. Unlike the 18-column form this arrangement results in "no interruptions in the sequence of increasing atomic numbers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=spjcrJ0UjbsC&amp;pg=PA190 | last = Scerri | first = Eric | authorlink = Eric Scerri | title = A Tale of 7 Elements | chapter = Element 61—Promethium | place = New York | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] (USA) | isbn = 978-0-19-539131-2 | pages = 175–194 (190) | year = 2013 | quote = ...&amp;nbsp;no interruptions in the sequence of increasing atomic numbers&amp;nbsp;... | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170910135005/https://books.google.com/books?id=spjcrJ0UjbsC&amp;pg=PA190 | archivedate = 10 September 2017 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship of the f-block to the other blocks of the periodic table also becomes easier to see.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rysqAAAACAAJ |last = Newell |first = S.

===Placement of hydrogen and helium===
Simply following electron configurations, hydrogen (electronic configuration 1s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and helium (1s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) should be placed in groups 1 and 2, above lithium (1s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and beryllium (1s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="Gray12"&gt;Gray, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; While such a placement is common for hydrogen, it is rarely used for helium outside of the context of electron configurations: When the [[noble gases]] (then called "inert gases") were first discovered around 1900, they were known as "group 0", reflecting no chemical reactivity of these elements known at that point, and helium was placed on the top of that group, as it did share the extreme chemical inertness seen throughout the group. As the group changed its formal number, many authors continued to assign helium directly above neon, in group 18; one of the examples of such placing is the current [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] table.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.iupac.org/fileadmin/user_upload/news/IUPAC_Periodic_Table-1May13.pdf|title = IUPAC Periodic Table of the Elements|date = 2013-05-01|accessdate = 2015-09-20|website = iupac.org|publisher = IUPAC|author = IUPAC|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150822234830/http://www.iupac.org/fileadmin/user_upload/news/IUPAC_Periodic_Table-1May13.pdf|archivedate = 22 August 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydrogen's chemical properties are not very close to those of the alkali metals, which occupy group 1. On this basis it is sometimes placed elsewhere. A common alternative is at the top of group 17&lt;ref name="ScerriJBPC"/&gt; given hydrogen's strictly univalent and largely non-metallic chemistry, and the strictly univalent and non-metallic chemistry of fluorine (the element otherwise at the top of group 17). Sometimes, to show hydrogen has properties corresponding to both those of the alkali metals and the halogens, it is shown at the top of the two columns simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Seaborg |first= G.|title=The chemical and radioactive properties of the heavy elements |journal= Chemical English Newspaper |year=1945 |volume=23 |issue=23 |pages=2190–2193}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another suggestion is above carbon in group 14: placed that way, it fits well into the trends of increasing ionization potential values and electron affinity values, and is not too far from the electronegativity trend, even though hydrogen cannot show the [[tetravalence]] characteristic of the heavier group 14 elements.&lt;ref name="hydrogen"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cronyn |first=M.

The other period 1 element, helium, is sometimes placed separately from any group as well.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood &amp; Earnshaw, throughout the book&lt;/ref&gt; The property that distinguishes helium from the rest of the noble gases (even though the extraordinary inertness of helium is extremely close to that of neon and argon)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Modeling Marvels: Computational Anticipation of Novel Molecules|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IoFzgBSSCwEC|publisher = Springer Science &amp; Business Media|date = 2008-12-05|isbn = 978-1-4020-6973-4|first = Errol G.|last = Lewars|pages = 69–71|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160519021952/https://books.google.com/books?id=IoFzgBSSCwEC|archivedate = 19 May 2016|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; is that in its closed electron shell, helium has only two electrons in the outermost electron orbital, while the rest of the noble gases have eight.&lt;!-- (Neon's electron configuration is [He]2s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2p&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;, argon's is [Ne]3s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3p&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;, and so on.)--&gt;

They are commonly [[lanthanum]] and [[actinium]], and less often [[lutetium]] and [[lawrencium]].

This arrangement was referred to as the "asteroid hypothesis", in analogy to asteroids occupying a single orbit in the solar system. Before this time the lanthanides were generally (and unsuccessfully) placed throughout groups I to VIII of the older 8-column form of periodic table. Although predecessors of Brauner's 1902 arrangement are recorded from as early as 1895, he is known to have referred to the "chemistry of asteroids" in an 1881 letter to Mendeleev. Other authors assigned all of the lanthanides to either group 3, groups 3 and 4, or groups 2, 3 and 4. In 1922 [[Niels Bohr]] continued the detachment process by locating the lanthanides between the s- and d-blocks. In 1949 [[Glenn T. Seaborg]] (re)introduced the form of periodic table that is popular today, in which the lanthanides and actinides appear as footnotes. Seaborg first published his table in a classified report dated 1944. It was published again by him in 1945 in ''[[Chemical and Engineering News]],'' and in the years up to 1949 several authors commented on, and generally agreed with, Seaborg's proposal. In that year he noted that the best method for presenting the actinides seemed to be by positioning them below, and as analogues of, the lanthanides. See: Thyssen P. and Binnemans K. (2011).

===Groups included in the transition metals===
The definition of a [[transition metal]], as given by IUPAC, is an element whose atom has an incomplete d sub-shell, or which can give rise to cations with an incomplete d sub-shell.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{GoldBookRef|file=T06456|title=transition element}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this definition all of the elements in groups 3–11 are transition metals. The IUPAC definition therefore excludes group 12, comprising zinc, cadmium and mercury, from the transition metals category.

Some chemists treat the categories "[[d-block]] elements" and "transition metals" interchangeably, thereby including groups 3–12 among the transition metals. In this instance the group 12 elements are treated as a special case of transition metal in which the d electrons are not ordinarily involved in chemical bonding. The 2007 report of [[mercury(IV) fluoride]] (HgF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), a compound in which mercury would use its d electrons for bonding, has prompted some commentators to suggest that mercury can be regarded as a transition metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Xuefang|first1= W. |last2=Andrews|first2=L.|last3=Riedel|first3=S.|last4= Kaupp|first4=M. |title=Mercury Is a Transition Metal: The First Experimental Evidence for HgF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; |journal=Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. |year=2007 |volume=46 |issue=44 |pages=8371–8375 |doi=10.1002/anie.200703710 |pmid=17899620}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other commentators, such as Jensen,&lt;ref name=Jensen2008&gt;{{cite journal |title=Is Mercury Now a Transition Element? |last = Jensen |first= W. B.|journal=J. Chem. Educ. |year=2008 |volume=85 |pages=1182–1183 |doi=10.1021/ed085p1182|bibcode = 2008JChEd..85.1182J |issue=9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that the formation of a compound like HgF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; can occur only under highly abnormal conditions; indeed, its existence is currently disputed. As such, mercury could not be regarded as a transition metal by any reasonable interpretation of the ordinary meaning of the term.&lt;ref name=Jensen2008/&gt;

Still other chemists further exclude the [[group 3 element]]s from the definition of a transition metal. They do so on the basis that the group 3 elements do not form any ions having a partially occupied d shell and do not therefore exhibit any properties characteristic of transition metal chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rayner-Canham|first1=G.|last2=Overton|first2=T.|title=Descriptive inorganic chemistry|publisher=W H Freeman|pages=484–485|location=New York|edition=4th|isbn=978-0-7167-8963-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, only groups 4–11 are regarded as transition metals. Though the group 3 elements show few of the characteristic chemical properties of the transition metals, they do show some of their characteristic physical properties (on account of the presence in each atom of a single d electron).&lt;ref name=Greenwood947&gt;Greenwood &amp; Earnshaw, p. 947&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elements with unknown chemical properties===
Although all elements up to oganesson have been discovered, of the elements above [[hassium]] (element 108), only [[copernicium]] (element 112), [[nihonium]] (element 113), and [[flerovium]] (element 114) have known chemical properties, and only for copernicium is there enough evidence for a conclusive categorisation at present. The other elements may behave differently from what would be predicted by extrapolation, due to [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic]] effects; for example, flerovium has been predicted to possibly exhibit some noble-gas-like properties, even though it is currently placed in the [[carbon group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Chemistry of Superheavy Elements|last=Schändel|first=M.|year=2003|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|location=Dordrecht|isbn=978-1-4020-1250-1|page=277}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current experimental evidence still leaves open the question of whether flerovium behaves more like a metal or a noble gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.epj-conferences.org/articles/epjconf/pdf/2016/26/epjconf-NS160-07003.pdf |title=Gas-phase chemistry of element 114, flerovium |last1=Yakushev |first1=Alexander |last2=Eichler |first2=Robert |date=2016 |conference=Nobel Symposium NS160 – Chemistry and Physics of Heavy and Superheavy Elements |doi=10.1051/epjconf/201613107003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further periodic table extensions===
{{main|Extended periodic table}}
&lt;div style="float: right; margin-left: 20px; font-size:85%;"&gt;
{{Periodic table (micro)|number=120|caption=Periodic table with eight rows, extended to element 172&lt;ref name="Fricke"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fricke |first1=B. |last2=Greiner |first2=W. |last3=Waber |first3=J.

&lt;/div&gt;
It is unclear whether new elements will continue the pattern of the current periodic table as [[Period 8 element|period 8]], or require further adaptations or adjustments. [[Glenn T. Seaborg|Seaborg]] expected the eighth period to follow the previously established pattern exactly, so that it would include a two-element s-block for elements [[ununennium|119]] and [[unbinilium|120]], a new [[g-block]] for the next 18 elements, and 30 additional elements continuing the current f-, d-, and p-blocks, culminating in element 168, the next noble gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/3963006|last=Frazier|first=K.|title=Superheavy Elements|journal=Science News|volume=113|issue=15|pages=236–238|year=1978|jstor=3963006}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, physicists such as [[Pekka Pyykkö]] have theorized that these additional elements do not follow the [[Madelung rule]], which predicts how electron shells are filled and thus affects the appearance of the present periodic table. There are currently several competing theoretical models for the placement of the elements of atomic number less than or equal to 172. In all of these it is element 172, rather than element 168, that emerges as the next noble gas after oganesson, although these must be regarded as speculative as no complete calculations have been done beyond element 122.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Pyykkö|first1=P.|authorlink=Pekka Pyykkö|title=A suggested periodic table up to Z ≤ 172, based on Dirac–Fock calculations on atoms and ions|journal=Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics|volume=13|issue=1|pages=161–168|year=2011|pmid=20967377|doi=10.1039/c0cp01575j|bibcode = 2011PCCP...13..161P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Element with the highest possible atomic number===
The number of possible elements is not known. A very early suggestion made by Elliot Adams in 1911, and based on the arrangement of elements in each horizontal periodic table row, was that elements of atomic weight greater than circa 256 (which would equate to between elements 99 and 100 in modern-day terms) did not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Elliot|first=Q.

;Bohr model
The [[Bohr model]] exhibits difficulty for atoms with atomic number greater than 137, as any element with an atomic number greater than 137 would require 1s electrons to be travelling faster than ''c'', the [[speed of light]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the non-relativistic Bohr model is inaccurate when applied to such an element.

;Relativistic Dirac equation
The [[Theory of relativity|relativistic]] Dirac equation has problems for elements with more than 137 protons. For such elements, the wave function of the Dirac ground state is oscillatory rather than bound, and there is no gap between the positive and negative energy spectra, as in the [[Klein paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; More accurate calculations taking into account the effects of the finite size of the nucleus indicate that the binding energy first exceeds the limit for elements with more than 173 protons. For heavier elements, if the innermost orbital (1s) is not filled, the electric field of the nucleus will pull an electron out of the vacuum, resulting in the [[Positron emission|spontaneous emission of a positron]].&lt;ref&gt;

===Optimal form===
The many different forms of periodic table have prompted the question of whether there is an optimal or definitive form of periodic table.&lt;ref name=optimal/&gt; The answer to this question is thought to depend on whether the chemical periodicity seen to occur among the elements has an underlying truth, effectively hard-wired into the universe, or if any such periodicity is instead the product of subjective human interpretation, contingent upon the circumstances, beliefs and predilections of human observers. An objective basis for chemical periodicity would settle the questions about the location of hydrogen and helium, and the composition of group 3. Such an underlying truth, if it exists, is thought to have not yet been discovered. In its absence, the many different forms of periodic table can be regarded as variations on the theme of chemical periodicity, each of which explores and emphasizes different aspects, properties, perspectives and relationships of and among the elements.{{#tag:ref|[[Eric Scerri|Scerri]], one of the foremost authorities on the history of the periodic table,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Sella|first = Andrea|authorlink = Andrea Sella|url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21929291-200-an-elementary-history-lesson/|title = An elementary history lesson|journal = [[New Scientist]]|date = 7 August 2013|issue = 2929|accessdate = 13 June 2017|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160703041107/https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21929291-200-an-elementary-history-lesson|archivedate = 3 July 2016|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; favoured the concept of an optimal form of periodic table but has recently changed his mind and now supports the value of a plurality of periodic tables.&lt;ref name=optimal&gt;{{cite web|first = Eric|last = Scerri|authorlink = Eric Scerri|date = 9 August 2013|url = http://ericscerri23.blogspot.com.au/2013/08/0-0-1-16-77-ucla-2-1-92-14.html|title = Is there an optimal periodic table and other bigger questions in the philosophy of science|accessdate = 4 September 2013|publisher = [[Eric Scerri]]|website = ericscerri23.blogspot.com.au|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170613022703/http://ericscerri23.blogspot.com.au/2013/08/0-0-1-16-77-ucla-2-1-92-14.html|archivedate = 13 June 2017|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=n}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33020">'''Photon polarization''' is the [[Quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] description of the [[Classical physics|classical]] [[Polarization (waves)|polarized]] [[sinusoidal]] [[plane wave|plane]] [[electromagnetic wave]]. An individual [[photon]]
can be described as having right or left [[circular polarization]], or a [[Quantum superposition|superposition]] of the two. Equivalently, a photon can be described as having horizontal or vertical [[linear polarization]], or a superposition of the two.

The description of photon polarization contains many of the physical concepts and much of the mathematical machinery of more involved quantum descriptions, such as the quantum mechanics of an electron in a potential well. Polarization is an example of a [[qubit]] degree of freedom, which forms a fundamental basis for an understanding of more complicated quantum phenomena. Much of the mathematical machinery of quantum mechanics, such as [[Quantum state|state vectors]], [[probability amplitude]]s, [[unitary operator]]s, and [[Hermitian operator]]s, emerge naturally from the classical [[Maxwell's equations]] in the description. The quantum polarization state vector for the photon, for instance, is identical with the [[Jones vector]], usually used to describe the polarization of a classical [[wave]]. Unitary operators emerge from the classical requirement of the [[conservation of energy]] of a classical wave propagating through lossless media that alter the polarization state of the wave. Hermitian operators then follow for infinitesimal transformations of a classical polarization state.

Many of the implications of the mathematical machinery are easily verified experimentally. In fact, many of the experiments can be performed with two pairs (or one broken pair) of [[Polaroid (polarizer)|polaroid]] sunglasses.

The connection with quantum mechanics is made through the identification of a minimum packet size, called a [[photon]], for energy in the electromagnetic field. The identification is based on the theories of [[Max Planck|Planck]] and the interpretation of those theories by [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]. The [[correspondence principle]] then allows the identification of momentum and angular momentum (called [[Spin (physics)|spin]]), as well as energy, with the photon.

The wave is linearly polarized (or plane polarized) when the phase angles
&lt;math&gt; \alpha_x^{ } , \alpha_y &lt;/math&gt; are [[Polarization (waves)#Polarization state|equal]],

This represents a wave with [[phase (waves)|phase]] &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; polarized at an angle &lt;math&gt; \theta    &lt;/math&gt; with respect to the x axis. In that case the Jones vector can be written

:&lt;math&gt;   |\psi\rangle  =   \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta    \\ \sin\theta   \end{pmatrix} \exp \left ( i \alpha \right )   .&lt;/math&gt;

The state vectors for linear polarization in x or y are special cases of this state vector.

If unit vectors are defined such that

:&lt;math&gt;   |x\rangle  \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\     \begin{pmatrix} 1    \\ 0  \end{pmatrix}    &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;   |y\rangle  \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\     \begin{pmatrix} 0    \\ 1  \end{pmatrix}    &lt;/math&gt;

then the linearly polarized polarization state can be written in the "x-y basis" as

:&lt;math&gt;   |\psi\rangle  =  \cos\theta \exp \left ( i \alpha \right ) |x\rangle + \sin\theta \exp \left ( i \alpha \right ) |y\rangle = \psi_x |x\rangle + \psi_y |y\rangle. &lt;/math&gt;

====Circular polarization====
{{Main|Circular polarization}}
If the phase angles &lt;math&gt;\alpha_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_y&lt;/math&gt; differ by exactly &lt;math&gt;\pi / 2&lt;/math&gt; and the x amplitude equals the y amplitude the wave is [[Circular polarization|circularly polarized]]. The Jones vector then becomes

:&lt;math&gt;   |\psi\rangle  =   \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ \pm i  \end{pmatrix} \exp \left ( i \alpha_x \right )   &lt;/math&gt;

where the plus sign indicates right circular polarization and the minus sign indicates left circular polarization. In the case of circular polarization, the electric field vector of constant magnitude rotates in the x-y plane.

If unit vectors are defined such that

:&lt;math&gt;   |R\rangle  \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\    {1 \over \sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1    \\ i  \end{pmatrix}    &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;   |L\rangle  \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\    {1 \over \sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1    \\ -i  \end{pmatrix}    &lt;/math&gt;

then an arbitrary polarization state can be written in the "R-L basis" as

:&lt;math&gt;   |\psi\rangle   = \psi_R |R\rangle + \psi_L |L\rangle  &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\psi_R = \langle R|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\cos\theta\exp(i\alpha_x) - i\sin\theta\exp(i\alpha_y))&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\psi_L = \langle L|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\cos\theta\exp(i\alpha_x) + i\sin\theta\exp(i\alpha_y)).&lt;/math&gt;

We can see that

:&lt;math&gt; 1 = |\psi_R|^2 + |\psi_L|^2 .  &lt;/math&gt;

====Elliptical polarization====

{{Main|Elliptical polarization}}

The general case in which the electric field rotates in the x-y plane and has variable magnitude is called [[elliptical polarization]]. The state vector is given by

:&lt;math&gt;   |\psi\rangle  \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\   \begin{pmatrix} \psi_x  \\ \psi_y   \end{pmatrix} =   \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta \exp \left ( i \alpha_x \right )   \\ \sin\theta \exp \left ( i \alpha_y \right )   \end{pmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;

====Geometric visualization of an arbitrary polarization state====
To get an understanding of what a polarization state looks like, one can observe the orbit that is made if the polarization state is multiplied by a phase factor of &lt;math&gt;e^{i\omega t}&lt;/math&gt; and then having the real parts of its components interpreted as x and y coordinates respectively. That is:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}x(t)\\y(t)\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}\Re(e^{i\omega t}\psi_x)\\ \Re(e^{i\omega t}\psi_y)\end{pmatrix} = \Re\left[e^{i\omega t}\begin{pmatrix}\psi_x\\ \psi_y\end{pmatrix}\right] = \Re\left(e^{i\omega t}|\psi\rangle\right).&lt;/math&gt;

If only the traced out shape and the direction of the rotation of {{math|(&lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;(&lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;), &lt;var&gt;y&lt;/var&gt;(&lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;))}} is considered when interpreting the polarization state, i.e. only

:&lt;math&gt;M(|\psi\rangle) = \left.\left\{\Big( x(t),\,y(t) \Big)\,\right|\,\forall\,t \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

(where {{math|&lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;(&lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;)}} and {{math|&lt;var&gt;y&lt;/var&gt;(&lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;)}} are defined as above) and whether it is overall more right circularly or left circularly polarized (i.e. whether {{math|{{!}}&lt;var&gt;ψ&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;{{!}} &gt; {{!}}&lt;var&gt;ψ&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;{{!}}}} or vice versa), it can be seen that the physical interpretation will be the same even if the state is multiplied by an arbitrary phase factor, since

:&lt;math&gt;M(e^{i\alpha}|\psi\rangle) = M(|\psi\rangle),\ \alpha\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

and the direction of rotation will remain the same. In other words, there is no physical difference between two polarization states &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e^{i\alpha}|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, between which only a phase factor differs.

It can be seen that for a linearly polarized state, &lt;var&gt;M&lt;/var&gt; will be a line in the xy plane, with length 2 and its middle in the origin, and whose slope equals to {{math|tan(&lt;var&gt;θ&lt;/var&gt;)}}. For a circularly polarized state, &lt;var&gt;M&lt;/var&gt; will be a circle with radius {{math|1/{{sqrt|2}}}} and with the middle in the origin.

==Energy, momentum, and angular momentum of a classical electromagnetic wave==

===Energy density of classical electromagnetic waves===

====Energy in a plane wave====

{{Main|Energy density}}

The [[Energy density|energy per unit volume]] in classical electromagnetic fields is (cgs units) and also Planck unit

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{E}_c = \frac{1}{8\pi} \left [ \mathbf{E}^2( \mathbf{r} , t ) + \mathbf{B}^2( \mathbf{r} , t ) \right ] .&lt;/math&gt;

For a plane wave, this becomes

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{E}_c = \frac{\mid \mathbf{E} \mid^2}{8\pi}    &lt;/math&gt;

where the energy has been averaged over a wavelength of the wave.

====Fraction of energy in each component====

The fraction of energy in the x component of the plane wave is

:&lt;math&gt; f_x = \frac{ \mid \mathbf{E} \mid^2 \cos^2\theta }{ \mid \mathbf{E} \mid^2 } = \psi_x^*\psi_x = \cos^2 \theta &lt;/math&gt;

with a similar expression for the y component resulting in &lt;math&gt;f_y=\sin^2\theta&lt;/math&gt;.

The fraction in both components is

:&lt;math&gt; \psi_x^*\psi_x + \psi_y^*\psi_y = \langle \psi  | \psi\rangle = 1.  &lt;/math&gt;

===Momentum density of classical electromagnetic waves===

The momentum density is given by the [[Poynting vector]]

:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol { \mathcal{P}} = {1 \over 4\pi c } \mathbf{E}( \mathbf{r}, t ) \times \mathbf{B}( \mathbf{r}, t ).  &lt;/math&gt;

For a sinusoidal plane wave traveling in the z direction, the momentum is in the z direction and is related to the energy density:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{P}_z c = \mathcal{E}_c.  &lt;/math&gt;

The momentum density has been averaged over a wavelength.

===Angular momentum density of classical electromagnetic waves===

Electromagnetic waves can have both [[Light orbital angular momentum|orbital]] and [[Light spin angular momentum|spin]] angular momentum.&lt;ref name= "Orbital"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Allen, L. |author2=Beijersbergen, M.W. |author3=Spreeuw, R.J.C. |author4=Woerdman, J.P. |title=Orbital angular momentum of light and the transformation of Laguerre-Gaussian laser modes |journal=Physical Review A |volume=45 |issue=11 |pages=8186–9 |date=June 1992 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.45.8185 |url=http://pra.aps.org/abstract/PRA/v45/i11/p8185_1 |pmid=9906912|bibcode = 1992PhRvA..45.8185A }}&lt;/ref&gt; The total angular momentum density is{{dubious|date=June 2016}}

:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol { \mathcal{L} } = \mathbf{r} \times \boldsymbol { \mathcal{P} } = {1 \over 4\pi c } \mathbf{r} \times \left [ \mathbf{E}( \mathbf{r}, t ) \times \mathbf{B}( \mathbf{r}, t ) \right ]. &lt;/math&gt;

For a sinusoidal plane wave propagating along &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; axis the orbital angular momentum density vanishes. The spin angular momentum density is in the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; direction and is given by

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L} = { {\mid \mathbf{E} \mid^2}  \over {8\pi\omega} } \left ( \mid \langle R  | \psi\rangle \mid^2 - \mid \langle L  | \psi\rangle \mid^2 \right ) = { 1  \over \omega } \mathcal{E}_c \left ( \mid \psi_R \mid^2 - \mid \psi_L \mid^2 \right ) &lt;/math&gt;

where again the density is averaged over a wavelength.

==Optical filters and crystals==

===Passage of a classical wave through a polaroid filter===

[[Image:060815 polaroid.svg|250px|thumb|right|Linear polarization]]

A [[linear filter]] transmits one component of a plane wave and absorbs the perpendicular component. In that case, if the filter is polarized in the x direction, the fraction of energy passing through the filter is

:&lt;math&gt; f_x  = \psi_x^*\psi_x = \cos^2\theta.\,   &lt;/math&gt;

===Example of energy conservation: Passage of a classical wave through a birefringent crystal===

An ideal [[Birefringence|birefringent]] crystal transforms the polarization state of an electromagnetic wave without loss of wave energy. Birefringent crystals therefore provide an ideal test bed for examining the conservative transformation of polarization states. Even though this treatment is still purely classical, standard quantum tools such as unitary and Hermitian operators that evolve the state in time naturally emerge.

====Initial and final states====

A birefringent crystal is a material that has an '''optic axis''' with the property that the light has a different [[index of refraction]] for light polarized parallel to the axis than it has for light polarized perpendicular to the axis. Light polarized parallel to the axis are called "''extraordinary rays''" or "''extraordinary photons''", while light polarized perpendicular to the axis are called "''ordinary rays''" or "''ordinary photons''". If a linearly polarized wave impinges on the crystal, the extraordinary component of the wave will emerge from the crystal with a different phase than the ordinary component. In mathematical language, if the incident wave is linearly polarized at an angle &lt;math&gt; \theta  &lt;/math&gt; with respect to the optic axis, the incident state vector can be written

:&lt;math&gt;   |\psi\rangle   =   \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta    \\ \sin\theta    \end{pmatrix}   &lt;/math&gt;

and the state vector for the emerging wave can be written

:&lt;math&gt;   |\psi '\rangle   =   \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta \exp \left ( i \alpha_x \right )   \\ \sin\theta \exp \left ( i \alpha_y \right )   \end{pmatrix}  = \begin{pmatrix}  \exp \left ( i \alpha_x \right ) &amp; 0   \\ 0 &amp;  \exp \left ( i \alpha_y \right )   \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta    \\ \sin\theta    \end{pmatrix} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\   \hat{U} |\psi\rangle. &lt;/math&gt;

While the initial state was linearly polarized, the final state is elliptically polarized. The birefringent crystal alters the character of the polarization.

====Dual of the final state====

[[Image:Calcite.jpg|right|thumb|400px|A calcite crystal laid upon a paper with some letters showing the double refraction]]

The initial polarization state is transformed into the final state with the [[Operator (physics)|operator]] U. The dual of the final state is given by

:&lt;math&gt;   \langle \psi '|   =  \langle \psi | \hat{U}^{\dagger} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;   U^{\dagger} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Hermitian adjoint|adjoint]] of U, the complex conjugate transpose of the matrix.

====Unitary operators and energy conservation====

The fraction of energy that emerges from the crystal is

:&lt;math&gt;\langle\psi '| \psi '\rangle  = \langle\psi |\hat{U}^{\dagger}\hat{U}|\psi\rangle = \langle \psi|\psi\rangle = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

In this ideal case, all the energy impinging on the crystal emerges from the crystal. An operator U with the property that

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{U}^{\dagger}\hat{U} = I,&lt;/math&gt;

where I is the [[identity function|identity operator]] and U is called a [[unitary operator]]. The unitary property is necessary to ensure [[energy conservation]] in state transformations.

====Hermitian operators and energy conservation====

[[Image:Calcite-HUGE.jpg|thumb|right|Doubly refracting Calcite from Iceberg claim, Dixon, New Mexico. This 35 pound (16&amp;nbsp;kg) crystal, on display at the [[National Museum of Natural History]], is one of the largest single crystals in the United States.]]

If the crystal is very thin, the final state will be only slightly different from the initial state. The unitary operator will be close to the identity operator. We can define the operator H by

:&lt;math&gt;     \hat{U}  \approx I + i\hat{H} &lt;/math&gt;

and the adjoint by

:&lt;math&gt;     \hat{U}^{\dagger}  \approx I - i\hat{H}^{\dagger}. &lt;/math&gt;

Energy conservation then requires

:&lt;math&gt;   I =  \hat{U}^{\dagger} \hat{U} \approx \left ( I - i\hat{H}^{\dagger} \right ) \left ( I + i\hat{H} \right ) \approx I - i\hat{H}^{\dagger} + i\hat{H}. &lt;/math&gt;

This requires that

:&lt;math&gt;     \hat{H} = \hat{H}^{\dagger}. &lt;/math&gt;

Operators like this that are equal to their adjoints are called [[Self-adjoint operator|Hermitian]] or self-adjoint.

The infinitesimal transition of the polarization state is

:&lt;math&gt; |\psi ' \rangle  - |\psi\rangle   =   i\hat{H} |\psi\rangle.   &lt;/math&gt;

Thus, energy conservation requires that infinitesimal transformations of a polarization state occur through the action of a Hermitian operator.

==Photons: The connection to quantum mechanics==

{{Main|Photon}}

===Energy, momentum, and angular momentum of photons===

====Energy====

&lt;!--  Commented out: [[Image:Max-Planck-und-Albert-Einstein.jpg|thumb|Max Planck presents [[Albert Einstein]] with the Max Planck medal, Berlin June 28, 1929]] --&gt;

The treatment to this point has been [[Classical physics|classical]]. It is a testament, however, to the generality of [[Maxwell's equations]] for electrodynamics that the treatment can be made [[Quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] with only a reinterpretation of classical quantities. The reinterpretation is based on the theories of [[Max Planck]] and the interpretation by [[Albert Einstein]] of those theories and of other experiments.

Einstein's conclusion from early experiments on the [[photoelectric effect]] is that electromagnetic radiation is composed of irreducible packets of energy, known as [[photon]]s. The energy of each packet is related to the angular frequency of the wave by the relation

:&lt;math&gt;    \epsilon = \hbar \omega &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;   \hbar  &lt;/math&gt; is an experimentally determined quantity known as [[Planck's constant]]. If there are &lt;math&gt;    N  &lt;/math&gt; photons in a box of volume &lt;math&gt;   V &lt;/math&gt;, the energy in the electromagnetic field is

:&lt;math&gt;    N \hbar \omega &lt;/math&gt;

and the energy density is

:&lt;math&gt;    {N \hbar \omega \over V} &lt;/math&gt;

The [[photon energy]] can be related to classical fields through the [[correspondence principle]] which states that for a large number of photons, the quantum and classical treatments must agree. Thus, for very large &lt;math&gt;    N  &lt;/math&gt;, the quantum energy density must be the same as the classical energy density

:&lt;math&gt;    {N \hbar \omega \over V} = \mathcal{E}_c = \frac{\mid \mathbf{E} \mid^2}{8\pi}.  &lt;/math&gt;

The number of photons in the box is then

:&lt;math&gt;    N  = \frac{V }{8\pi \hbar \omega}\mid  \mathbf{E} \mid^2 .  &lt;/math&gt;

====Momentum====

The correspondence principle also determines the momentum and angular momentum of the photon. For momentum

:&lt;math&gt;  \mathcal{P}_z =  {N \hbar \omega \over cV} = {N \hbar k_z \over V}   &lt;/math&gt;

where kz is the wave number. This implies that the momentum of a photon is

:&lt;math&gt;  p_z=\hbar k_z .\,   &lt;/math&gt;

====Angular momentum and spin====

Similarly for the spin angular momentum

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L}  = { 1  \over \omega } \mathcal{E}_c \left ( \mid \psi_R \mid^2 - \mid \psi_L \mid^2 \right ) = { N\hbar  \over V }  \left ( \mid \psi_R \mid^2 - \mid \psi_L \mid^2 \right )&lt;/math&gt;

where Ec is field strength. This implies that the spin angular momentum of the photon is

:&lt;math&gt; l_z = \hbar  \left ( \mid \psi_R \mid^2 - \mid \psi_L \mid^2 \right ). &lt;/math&gt;

the quantum interpretation of this expression is that the photon has a probability of &lt;math&gt;  \mid \psi_R \mid^2  &lt;/math&gt; of having a spin angular momentum of &lt;math&gt; \hbar  &lt;/math&gt; and a probability of &lt;math&gt;  \mid \psi_L \mid^2  &lt;/math&gt; of having a spin angular momentum of &lt;math&gt; -\hbar  &lt;/math&gt;. We can therefore think of the spin angular momentum of the photon being quantized as well as the energy. The angular momentum of classical light has been verified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Beth, R.A. |title=Direct detection of the angular momentum of light |journal=Phys. Rev. |volume=48 |issue=5 |page=471 |date=1935 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.48.471 |url=http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PR/v48/i5/p471_1|bibcode = 1935PhRv...48..471B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Photons have only been observed to have spin angular momenta of &lt;math&gt; \pm \hbar &lt;/math&gt;.{{Citation needed|reason=there is no reference to an actual expermiment which measures this, and not just the classical angular momentum|date=January 2013}}

=====Spin operator=====

The [[Spin (physics)|spin]] of the photon is defined as the coefficient of &lt;math&gt; \hbar  &lt;/math&gt; in the spin angular momentum calculation. A photon has spin 1 if it is in the &lt;math&gt; | R \rangle  &lt;/math&gt; state and -1 if it is in the &lt;math&gt; | L \rangle  &lt;/math&gt; state. The spin operator is defined as the [[outer product]]

:&lt;math&gt;  \hat{S} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\   |R\rangle \langle R | - |L\rangle \langle L |   =   \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; -i    \\ i &amp; 0  \end{pmatrix}.    &lt;/math&gt;

The [[eigenvector]]s of the spin operator are &lt;math&gt;   |R\rangle     &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; |L\rangle     &lt;/math&gt; with [[eigenvalue]]s 1 and -1, respectively.

The expected value of a spin measurement on a photon is then

:&lt;math&gt;     \langle \psi |\hat{S} |\psi\rangle  = \mid \psi_R \mid^2 - \mid \psi_L \mid^2.   &lt;/math&gt;

An operator S has been associated with an observable quantity, the spin angular momentum. The eigenvalues of the operator are the allowed observable values. This has been demonstrated for spin angular momentum, but it is in general true for any observable quantity.

=====Spin states=====
{{see also|Circular polarization#Quantum mechanics}}

We can write the circularly polarized states as

:&lt;math&gt;     |s\rangle   &lt;/math&gt;

where s=1 for &lt;math&gt;     |R\rangle    &lt;/math&gt; and s= -1 for &lt;math&gt;     |L\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. An arbitrary state can be written{{clarify|reason=What is θ here? Also, what are x and α_x?|date=June 2015}}

:&lt;math&gt;   |\psi\rangle   = \sum_{s=-1,1} a_s   \exp \left ( i \alpha_x -i s \theta \right ) |s\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;     \sum_{s=-1,1} \mid a_s \mid^2=1.    &lt;/math&gt;

=====Spin and angular momentum operators in differential form=====

When the state is written in spin notation, the spin operator can be written{{clarify|reason=Has the state space become a function space all of a sudden, with θ serving as the independent variable? I thought the state space was C^2. The sudden appearance of a differential operator without a space to use it on appears to be bleed-through from another model out there in the quantum ether somewhere.|date=June 2015}}

:&lt;math&gt;   \hat{S}_d  \rightarrow i { \partial \over \partial \theta}    &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;   \hat{S}_d^{\dagger}  \rightarrow -i { \partial \over \partial \theta}.    &lt;/math&gt;

The eigenvectors of the differential spin operator are

:&lt;math&gt;     \exp \left ( i \alpha_x -i s \theta \right ) |s\rangle.  &lt;/math&gt;

To see this note

:&lt;math&gt;   \hat{S}_d      \exp \left ( i \alpha_x -i s \theta \right ) |s\rangle   \rightarrow i { \partial \over \partial \theta}  \exp \left ( i \alpha_x -i s \theta \right ) |s\rangle = s \left [ \exp \left ( i \alpha_x -i s \theta \right ) |s\rangle \right ]. &lt;/math&gt;

The spin angular momentum operator is

:&lt;math&gt;   \hat{l}_z = \hbar \hat{S}_d.   &lt;/math&gt;

===The nature of probability in quantum mechanics===

====Probability for a single photon====
There are two ways in which probability can be applied to the behavior of photons; probability can be used to calculate the probable number of photons in a particular state, or probability can be used to calculate the likelihood of a single photon to be in a particular state. The former interpretation violates energy conservation{{cn|date=August 2016}}. The latter interpretation is the viable, if nonintuitive, option. Dirac explains this in the context of the [[double-slit experiment]]:
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Some time before the discovery of quantum mechanics people realized that the connection between light waves and photons must be of a statistical character. What they did not clearly realize, however, was that the wave function gives information about the probability of '''one''' photon being in a particular place and not the probable number of photons in that place{{dubious|reason=Dirac was probably wrong; he was overgeneralizing from fermions where there can only be 0 or 1. And at visible wavelengths and reasonable temperatures you rarely have more than one photon in a state. With lasers (or at radio frequencies, which Dirac wasn't thinking about) you can have very high occupation numbers whose expected value corresponds to the classical energy in that mode divided by hν.|date=August 2016}}. The importance of the distinction can be made clear in the following way. Suppose we have a beam of light consisting of a large number of photons split up into two components of equal intensity. On the assumption that the beam is connected with the probable number of photons in it, we should have half the total number going into each component. If the two components are now made to interfere, we should require a photon in one component to be able to interfere with one in the other. Sometimes these two photons would have to annihilate one another and other times they would have to produce four photons. This would contradict the conservation of energy. The new theory, which connects the wave function with probabilities for one photon gets over the difficulty by making each photon go partly into each of the two components. Each photon then interferes only with itself. Interference between two different photons never occurs{{dubious|reason=Dirac was just wrong -- or actually what he should have said is that interference measured in one mode is not due to energy in modes orthogonal with it. I have plenty of experience interfering waves from two different lasers for instance. Also, I would argue that photons don't even interfere with themselves; waves interfere.|date=August 2016}}.&lt;br&gt;&amp;mdash;Paul Dirac, '''The Principles of Quantum Mechanics,''' Fourth Edition, Chapter 1&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Probability amplitudes====
The probability for a photon to be in a particular polarization state depends on the fields as calculated by the classical Maxwell's equations. The polarization state of the photon is proportional to the field. The probability itself is quadratic in the fields and consequently is also quadratic in the quantum state of polarization. In quantum mechanics, therefore, the state or [[probability amplitude]] contains the basic probability information. In general, the rules for combining probability amplitudes look very much like the classical rules for composition of probabilities: [The following quote is from Baym, Chapter 1]{{clarify|reason=These rules are expressed much too loosely. What are "two successive probabilities" in scientific terms? What sort of statements, states, or sets of inequalities qualify as "possibilities"? What is a "way"? There seem to be a lot of unstated heuristics at work here, and the reader is left with the impression that QM is a collection of rules-of-thumb that have not been formalized.|date=June 2015}}

:&lt;blockquote&gt;
# The probability amplitude for two successive probabilities is the product of amplitudes for the individual possibilities. For example, the amplitude for the x polarized photon to be right circularly polarized '''and''' for the right circularly polarized photon to pass through the y-polaroid is &lt;math&gt;\langle R|x\rangle\langle y|R\rangle,&lt;/math&gt; the product of the individual amplitudes.
# The amplitude for a process that can take place in one of several '''indistinguishable''' ways is the sum of amplitudes for each of the individual ways. For example, the total amplitude for the x polarized photon to pass through the y-polaroid is the sum of the amplitudes for it to pass as a right circularly polarized photon, &lt;math&gt;\langle y|R\rangle\langle R|x\rangle,&lt;/math&gt; plus the amplitude for it to pass as a left circularly polarized photon, &lt;math&gt;\langle y|L\rangle\langle L|x\rangle\dots&lt;/math&gt;
# The total probability for the process to occur is the absolute value squared of the total amplitude calculated by 1 and 2.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;math&gt;  \mathbf{V} \cdot \mathbf{W} \le \| \mathbf{V} \|\| \mathbf{W} \| .    &lt;/math&gt;
]]

====Mathematical preparation====
For any legal{{clarify|reason=The word legal is not generally used in formal scientific writing.|date=June 2015}} operators the following inequality, a consequence of the [[Cauchy–Schwarz inequality]], is true.

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{4} |\langle (\hat{A} \hat{B} - \hat{B} \hat{A} )x | x \rangle|^2\leq \| \hat{A} x \|^2 \| \hat{B} x \|^2.&lt;/math&gt;

If ''B A'' ψ and ''A B'' ψ are defined, then by subtracting the means and re-inserting in the above formula, we deduce
:&lt;math&gt;
\Delta_{\psi} \hat{A} \, \Delta_{\psi} \hat{B} \ge \frac{1}{2} \left|\left\langle\left[{\hat{A}},{\hat{B}}\right]\right\rangle_\psi\right|
&lt;/math&gt;
where

:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle \hat{X} \right\rangle_\psi = \left\langle \psi | \hat{X} | \psi \right\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

is the operator [[mean]] of observable ''X'' in the system state ψ and

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta_{\psi} \hat{X} = \sqrt{\langle {\hat{X}}^2\rangle_\psi - \langle {\hat{X}}\rangle_\psi ^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here

:&lt;math&gt;
\left[{\hat{A}},{\hat{B}}\right] \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\   \hat{A} \hat{B} - \hat{B} \hat{A}
&lt;/math&gt;

is called the [[commutator]] of A and B.

This is a purely mathematical result. No reference has been made to any physical quantity or principle. It simply states that the uncertainty of one operator times the uncertainty of another operator has a lower bound.

====Application to angular momentum====
The connection to physics can be made if we identify the operators with physical operators such as the angular momentum and the polarization angle. We have then

:&lt;math&gt;
\Delta_{\psi} \hat{l}_z \, \Delta_{\psi} {\theta} \ge \frac{\hbar}{2}, &lt;/math&gt;

which simply states that angular momentum '''and''' the polarization angle{{clarify|reason=The operator that make the polarization angle into an observable has not been defined or referenced.|date=June 2015}} cannot be measured simultaneously with infinite accuracy.

===States, probability amplitudes, unitary and Hermitian operators, and eigenvectors===

Much of the mathematical apparatus of quantum mechanics appears in the classical description of a polarized sinusoidal electromagnetic wave. The Jones vector for a classical wave, for instance, is identical with the quantum polarization state vector for a photon. The right and left circular components of the Jones vector can be interpreted as [[probability amplitude]]s of spin states of the photon. Energy conservation requires that the states be transformed with a unitary operation. This implies that infinitesimal transformations are transformed with a Hermitian operator. These conclusions are a natural consequence of the structure of Maxwell's equations for classical waves.

Quantum mechanics enters the picture when observed quantities are measured and found to be discrete rather than continuous. The allowed observable values are determined by the eigenvalues of the operators associated with the observable. In the case angular momentum, for instance, the allowed observable values are the eigenvalues of the spin operator.

These concepts have emerged naturally from [[Maxwell's equations]] and Planck's and Einstein's theories. They have been found to be true for many other physical systems. In fact, the typical program is to assume the concepts of this section and then to infer the unknown dynamics of a physical system. This was done, for instance, with the dynamics of electrons. In that case, working back from the principles in this section, the quantum dynamics of particles were inferred, leading to [[Schrödinger's equation]], a departure from [[Newtonian mechanics]]. The solution of this equation for atoms led to the explanation of the [[Balmer series]] for atomic spectra and consequently formed a basis for all of atomic physics and chemistry.

This is not the only occasion{{dubious|reason=I didn't see where Maxwell's equations "forced a restructuring of Newtonian mechanics" in the previous paragraphs. In the following, yes, but that has nothing to do with quantum mechanics or the purpose of the article.|date=August 2016}} in which Maxwell's equations have forced a restructuring of Newtonian mechanics. Maxwell's equations are relativistically consistent. [[Special relativity]] resulted from attempts to make classical mechanics consistent with Maxwell's equations (see, for example, [[Moving magnet and conductor problem]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2218">'''Polymorphous perversity''' is a [[psychoanalytic]] concept proposing the ability to gain [[sexual gratification]] outside [[social norm|socially normative]] sexual behaviors. [[Sigmund Freud]] used this term to describe the sexual disposition from infancy to about age five.

==Freud's theory==

Freud theorized that some are born with unfocused pleasure / [[libido|libidinal]] drives, deriving pleasure from any part of the body. The objects and modes of pleasurable satisfaction are multifarious, directed at every object that might provide pleasure. Polymorphous perverse sexuality continues from infancy through about age five, progressing through three distinct developmental stages: the [[oral stage]], [[anal stage]], and [[Genital stage|genital / phallic stage]]. Only in subsequent developmental stages do children learn to constrain drives towards pleasure-satisfaction to socially accepted norms, culminating in adult [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] behavior focused on the genitals and reproduction or sublimations of the procreative drive.

Freud taught that during this stage of undifferentiated impulse for pleasure, [[incest]]uous and [[bisexuality|bisexual]] urges are normal. Lacking knowledge that certain modes of gratification are forbidden, the polymorphously perverse child seeks gratification wherever it occurs. In the earliest phase, the oral phase, the child forms a libidinal bond with the mother via the inherent pleasure gained from [[breastfeeding|suckling at the breast]].

For Freud, "perversion" is a non-judgmental term. He used it to designate behavior outside the socially acceptable norms of his era.

The first type seeks to model the experimental data quantitatively, i.e., to reproduce the measurements of current and voltage exactly.

==Hodgkin–Huxley model==
{{main|Hodgkin–Huxley model}}

[[File:MembraneCircuit.svg|thumb|right|448px|Equivalent electrical circuit for the Hodgkin–Huxley model of the action potential. ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; represent the current through, and the voltage across, a small patch of membrane, respectively. The ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; represents the capacitance of the membrane patch, whereas the four ''g'''s represent the [[electrical conductance|conductances]] of four types of ions. The two conductances on the left, for potassium (K) and sodium (Na), are shown with arrows to indicate that they can vary with the applied voltage, corresponding to the [[voltage-gated ion channel|voltage-sensitive ion channels]].]]

In 1952 [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin]] and [[Andrew Huxley]] developed a set of equations to fit their experimental voltage-clamp data on the axonal membrane.&lt;ref name="hodgkin_1952" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Nelson ME, Rinzel J | year= 1994|chapter= The Hodgkin–Huxley Model|title=The Book of GENESIS: Exploring Realistic Neural Models with the GEneral NEural SImulation System|veditors=Bower J, Beeman D | publisher = Springer Verlag | location = New York|pages= 29–49 | chapterurl=http://www.genesis-sim.org/GENESIS/iBoG/iBoGpdf/chapt4.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model assumes that the membrane capacitance ''C'' is constant; thus, the transmembrane voltage ''V'' changes with the total transmembrane current ''I''&lt;sub&gt;tot&lt;/sub&gt; according to the equation

:&lt;math&gt;
C \frac{dV}{dt} = I_{\mathrm{tot}} = I_{\mathrm{ext}} + I_{\mathrm{Na}} + I_{\mathrm{K}} + I_{\mathrm{L}}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''I''&lt;sub&gt;Na&lt;/sub&gt;, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''I''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; are currents conveyed through the local sodium channels, potassium channels, and "leakage" channels (a catch-all), respectively. The initial term ''I''&lt;sub&gt;ext&lt;/sub&gt; represents the current arriving from external sources, such as [[excitatory postsynaptic potential]]s from the dendrites or a scientist's electrode.

The model further assumes that a given ion channel is either fully open or closed; if closed, its [[Electrical conductance|conductance]] is zero, whereas if open, its conductance is some constant value ''g''. Hence, the net current through an ion channel depends on two variables: the probability ''p''&lt;sub&gt;open&lt;/sub&gt; of the channel being open, and the difference in voltage from that ion's equilibrium voltage, ''V'' &amp;minus; ''V''&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;. For example, the current through the potassium channel may be written as

:&lt;math&gt;
I_{\mathrm{K}} = g_{\mathrm{K}} \left( V - E_{\mathrm{K}} \right) p_{\mathrm{open, K}}
&lt;/math&gt;

which is equivalent to [[Ohm's law]]. By definition, no net current flows (''I''&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt; = 0) when the transmembrane voltage equals the equilibrium voltage of that ion (when ''V'' = ''E''&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;).

To fit their data accurately, Hodgkin and Huxley assumed that each type of ion channel had multiple "gates", so that the channel was open only if all the gates were open and closed otherwise. They also assumed that the probability of a gate being open was independent of the other gates being open; this assumption was later validated for the inactivation gate.&lt;ref name="armstrong_1973"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Armstrong CM, Bezanilla F, Rojas E | year = 1973 | title = Destruction of Sodium Conductance Inactivation in Squid Axons Perfused with Pronase |pmid=4755846 | journal = J.

Physiol. | volume = 262 | pages = 501&amp;ndash;531 | doi = 10.1113/jphysiol.1976.sp011608}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hodgkin and Huxley modeled the voltage-sensitive potassium channel as having four gates; letting ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; denote the probability of a single such gate being open, the probability of the whole channel being open is the product of four such probabilities, i.e., ''p''&lt;sub&gt;open, K&lt;/sub&gt; = ''n''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;. Similarly, the probability of the voltage-sensitive sodium channel was modeled to have three similar gates of probability ''m'' and a fourth gate, associated with inactivation, of probability ''h''; thus, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;open, Na&lt;/sub&gt; = ''m''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''h''. The probabilities for each gate are assumed to obey [[rate equation|first-order kinetics]]

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{dm}{dt} = - \frac{m - m_{\mathrm{eq}}}{\tau_{m}}
&lt;/math&gt;

where both the equilibrium value ''m''&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; and the relaxation time constant τ&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; depend on the instantaneous voltage ''V'' across the membrane. If ''V'' changes on a time-scale more slowly than τ&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;, the ''m'' probability will always roughly equal its equilibrium value ''m''&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;; however, if ''V'' changes more quickly, then ''m'' will lag behind ''m''&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;. By fitting their voltage-clamp data, Hodgkin and Huxley were able to model how these equilibrium values and time constants varied with temperature and transmembrane voltage.&lt;ref name="hodgkin_1952" /&gt; The formulae are complex and depend exponentially on the voltage and temperature. For example, the time constant for sodium-channel activation probability ''h'' varies as 3&lt;sup&gt;(θ&amp;minus;6.3)/10&lt;/sup&gt; with the Celsius temperature θ, and with voltage ''V'' as

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{\tau_{h}} = 0.07 e^{-V/20} + \frac{1}{1 + e^{3 - V/10}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

In summary, the Hodgkin–Huxley equations are complex, non-linear [[ordinary differential equation]]s in four [[independent variable]]s: the transmembrane voltage ''V'', and the probabilities ''m'', ''h'' and ''n''.&lt;ref name="sato_2005" &gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Sato S, Fukai H, Nomura T, Doi S | year = 2005 | chapter = Bifurcation Analysis of the Hodgkin–Huxley Equations | title = Modeling in the Neurosciences: From Biological Systems to Neuromimetic Robotics | edition = 2nd |veditors=Reeke GN, Poznanski RR, Lindsay KA, Rosenberg JR, Sporns O | publisher = CRC Press | location = Boca Raton | isbn = 978-0-415-32868-5 | pages = 459&amp;ndash;478}}&lt;/ref&gt; No general solution of these equations has been discovered.

{{main|Fitzhugh-Nagumo model}}

[[File:Negative differential resistance.svg|thumb|right|350px|Figure FHN: To mimick the action potential, the Fitzhugh-Nagumo model and its relatives use a function ''g''(''V'') with [[negative differential resistance]] (a negative slope on the ''I'' vs. ''V'' plot). For comparison, a normal resistor would have a positive slope, by [[Ohm's law]] ''I = GV'', where the [[electrical conductance|conductance]] ''G'' is the inverse of [[electrical resistance|resistance]] ''G''=1/''R''.]]

This [[van der Pol oscillator|van der Pol]] equation has stimulated much research in the mathematics of nonlinear [[dynamical system]]s. [[operational amplifier|Op-amp]] circuits that realize the FHN and van der Pol models of the action potential have been developed by Keener.&lt;ref name="keener_1983"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Keener JP | year = 1983 | title = Analogue circuitry for the van der Pol and FitzHugh-Nagumo equations | journal = IEEE Trans. on Systems, Man and Cybernetics | volume = 13 | pages = 1010&amp;ndash;1014 | doi=10.1109/TSMC.1983.6313098}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A hybrid of the Hodgkin–Huxley and FitzHugh–Nagumo models was developed by Morris and Lecar in 1981, and applied to the [[muscle]] fiber of [[barnacle]]s.&lt;ref name="morris_1981"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Morris C, Lecar H | year = 1981 | title = Voltage oscillations in the barnacle giant muscle fiber | journal = Biophysical Journal | volume = 35 | issue = 1 | pages = 193&amp;ndash;213 | doi = 10.1016/S0006-3495(81)84782-0 | pmc = 1327511 | pmid=7260316 | bibcode=1981BpJ....35..193M}}&lt;/ref&gt; True to the barnacle's physiology, the Morris–Lecar model replaces the voltage-gated sodium current of the Hodgkin–Huxley model with a voltage-dependent calcium current. There is no inactivation (no ''h'' variable) and the calcium current equilibrates instantaneously, so that again, there are only two time-dependent variables: the transmembrane voltage ''V'' and the potassium gate probability ''n''. The bursting, entrainment and other mathematical properties of this model have been studied in detail.&lt;ref name="rinzel_1989" &gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Rinzel J, Ermentrout GB | year = 1989 | chapter = Analysis of Neural Excitability and Oscillations | title = Methods in Neuronal Modeling: From Synapses to Networks | editor = [[Christof Koch|C.

The simplest models of the action potential are the "flush and fill" models (also called "integrate-and-fire" models), in which the input signal is summed (the "fill" phase) until it reaches a threshold, firing a pulse and resetting the summation to zero (the "flush" phase).&lt;ref name="hoppensteadt_1986" /&gt;&lt;ref name="keener_1981"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Keener JP, Hoppensteadt FC, Rinzel J | year = 1981 | title = Integrate-and-fire models of nerve membrane response to oscillatory input | journal = SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics | volume = 41 | pages = 503&amp;ndash;517 | doi = 10.1137/0141042 | issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of these models are capable of exhibiting [[entrainment (physics)|entrainment]], which is [[entrainment (biomusicology)|commonly observed]] in nervous systems.&lt;ref name="hoppensteadt_1986" /&gt;

==Extracellular potentials and currents==

Whereas the above models simulate the transmembrane voltage and current at a single patch of membrane, other mathematical models pertain to the voltages and currents in the ionic solution surrounding the neuron.&lt;ref name="stevens_1966" &gt;{{cite book | author = Stevens, Charles F. | year = 1966 | title = Neurophysiology: A Primer | publisher = John Wiley and Sons | location = New York | pages = 161&amp;ndash;173 | lccn = 66015872}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such models are helpful in interpreting data from extracellular electrodes, which were common prior to the invention of the glass pipette electrode that allowed intracellular recording.&lt;ref name="ling_1949" &gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ling G, Gerard RW | year = 1949 | title = The normal membrane potential of frog sartorius fibers | journal = J.

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{j} = \sigma \mathbf{E}
&lt;/math&gt;

where '''j''' and '''E''' are vectors representing the [[current density]] and [[electric field]], respectively, and where σ is the [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]].  Thus, '''j''' can be found from '''E''', which in turn may be found using [[Maxwell's equations]].  Maxwell's equations can be reduced to a relatively simple problem of [[electrostatics]], since the ionic concentrations change too slowly (compared to the [[speed of light]]) for [[magnetic field|magnetic effects]] to be important.  The [[electric potential]] φ('''x''') at any extracellular point '''x''' can be solved using [[Green's identities]]&lt;ref name="stevens_1966" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\phi(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{4\pi\sigma_{\mathrm{outside}}} \oint_{\mathrm{membrane}}

\left[ \sigma_{\mathrm{outside}} \phi_{\mathrm{outside}}(\boldsymbol\xi) - \sigma_{\mathrm{inside}}\phi_{\mathrm{inside}}(\boldsymbol\xi) \right] dS
&lt;/math&gt;

where the integration is over the complete surface of the membrane; &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\xi&lt;/math&gt; is a position on the membrane, σ&lt;sub&gt;inside&lt;/sub&gt; and φ&lt;sub&gt;inside&lt;/sub&gt; are the conductivity and potential just within the membrane, and σ&lt;sub&gt;outside&lt;/sub&gt; and φ&lt;sub&gt;outside&lt;/sub&gt; the corresponding values just outside the membrane.  Thus, given these σ and φ values on the membrane, the extracellular potential φ('''x''') can be calculated for any position '''x'''; in turn, the electric field '''E''' and current density '''j''' can be calculated from this potential field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lorente de No R | year = 1947 | title = A Study of Nerve Physiology | journal = Stud.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="49272">In [[biology]], '''quorum sensing''' is the ability to detect and to respond to cell [[population density]] by [[gene regulation]]. As one example, quorum sensing (QS) enables [[bacteria]] to restrict the expression of specific [[gene]]s to the high cell densities at which the resulting [[phenotype]]s will be most beneficial. Many species of [[bacteria]] use quorum sensing to coordinate [[gene expression]] according to the density of their local population. In similar fashion, some [[social insects]] use quorum sensing to determine where to nest.

In addition to its function in biological systems, quorum sensing has several useful applications for computing and robotics. In general, quorum sensing can function as a decision-making process in any [[decentralized system]] in which the components have: (a) a means of assessing the number of other components they interact with and (b) a standard response once a threshold number of components is detected.

==Bacteria==
Some of the best-known examples of quorum sensing come from studies of [[bacteria]]. Bacteria use quorum sensing to regulate certain [[phenotype]] expressions, which in turn, coordinate their behaviours. Some common phenotypes include [[biofilm]] formation, [[virulence]] factor expression, and [[motility]]. Certain bacteria are able to use quorum sensing to regulate [[bioluminescence]], [[nitrogen fixation]] and [[Spore|sporulation]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pan|first=Jiachuan|last2=Ren |first2=Dacheng |date=2009-11-01 |title=Quorum sensing inhibitors: a patent overview|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1517/13543770903222293 |journal=Expert Opinion on Therapeutic Patents|volume=19 |issue=11|pages=1581–1601 |doi=10.1517/13543770903222293|issn=1354-3776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quorum sensing functions based on the local density of the bacterial population in the immediate environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Melissa B.|last2=Bassler|first2=Bonnie L.|date=2001-10-01|title=Quorum Sensing in Bacteria|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.micro.55.1.165|journal=Annual Review of Microbiology|volume=55|issue=1|pages=165–199 |doi=10.1146/annurev.micro.55.1.165|issn=0066-4227}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can occur within a single bacterial species, as well as between diverse species. Both [[Gram-positive bacteria|Gram-positive]] and [[Gram-negative bacteria|gram-negative]] bacteria use quorum sensing, but there are some major differences in their mechanisms.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bassler|first=Bonnie L|title=How bacteria talk to each other: regulation of gene expression by quorum sensing|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1369527499000259|journal=Current Opinion in Microbiology|volume=2|issue=6|pages=582–587 |doi=10.1016/s1369-5274(99)00025-9|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mechanism===
For the bacteria to use quorum sensing constitutively, they must possess three characteristics: to secrete a signaling molecule, an [[autoinducer]], to detect the change in concentration of signaling molecules, and to regulate gene [[Transcription (biology)|transcription]] as a response.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This process is highly dependent on the [[diffusion]] mechanism of the signaling molecules. QS Signaling&amp;nbsp;molecules are usually secreted at a low level by individual bacteria. At low cell density, the molecules may just diffuse away. At high cell density, the local concentration of signaling molecules may exceed its threshold level, and trigger changes in gene expressions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

====Gram-positive Bacteria====
Gram-positive bacteria use autoinducing peptide (AIP) as their autoinducers.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rutherford|first=Steven T.|last2=Bassler|first2=Bonnie L.|date=2012-11-01|title=Bacterial Quorum Sensing: Its Role in Virulence and Possibilities for Its Control|url=http://perspectivesinmedicine.cshlp.org/content/2/11/a012427|journal=Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Medicine |volume=2|issue=11|pages=a012427 |doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a012427| pmid=23125205|pmc=3543102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When gram-positive bacteria detect high concentration of AIP in the environment, AIP bind to a receptor to activate [[kinase]]. The kinase phosphorylates a [[transcription factor]], which regulated gene transcription. This is called a [[Two-component regulatory system|two-component system]].

Another possible mechanism is that AIP is transported into the cytosol, and binds directly to a transcription factor to initiate or inhibit transcription.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

====Gram-negative Bacteria====
Gram-negative bacteria produce [[N-Acyl homoserine lactone|N-acyl homoserine lactones]] (AHL) as their signaling molecule.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Usually AHLs do not need additional processing, and bind directly to transcription factors to regulate gene expression.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Some gram-negative bacteria may use the two-component system as well.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;[[File:Quorum sensing of Gram Negative cell.pdf|thumb|Quorum sensing of Gram Negative cell]]

===Examples===

====''Aliivibrio fischeri''====
Quorum sensing was first observed in ''[[Aliivibrio fischeri]]'', a bioluminescent bacterium that lives as a [[mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] [[symbiont]] in the [[photophore]] (or light-producing organ) of the [[Hawaiian bobtail squid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nealson |first=K. |last2=Platt |first2=T. |last3=Hastings |first3=J.W. |year=1970 |title=The cellular control of the synthesis and activity of the bacterial luminescent system |url=http://jb.asm.org/cgi/reprint/104/1/313 |journal=Journal of Bacteriology |volume=104 |issue=1 |pages=313–22 |pmid=5473898 |pmc=248216}}&lt;/ref&gt; When ''A. fischeri'' cells are free-living (or [[plankton]]ic), the autoinducer is at low concentration, and, thus, cells do not show luminescence. However, when the population reaches the threshold in the photophore (about {{10^|11}} cells/ml), transcription of [[luciferase]] is induced, leading to [[bioluminescence]].

====''Escherichia coli''====
In the Gram-negative bacterium ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' (''E. coli''), cell division may be partially regulated by [[AI-2]]-mediated quorum sensing. This species uses AI-2, which is produced and processed by the ''[[Lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor|lsr]]'' [[operon]]. Part of it encodes an [[ABC transporter]], which imports AI-2 into the cells during the early stationary (latent) phase of growth. AI-2 is then phosphorylated by the LsrK [[kinase]], and the newly produced phospho-AI-2 can be either internalized or used to suppress LsrR, a repressor of the ''lsr'' operon (thereby activating the operon). Transcription of the ''lsr'' operon is also thought to be inhibited by [[dihydroxyacetone phosphate]] (DHAP) through its competitive binding to LsrR. [[Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate]] has also been shown to inhibit the ''lsr'' operon through [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]]-CAPK-mediated inhibition. This explains why, when grown with [[glucose]], ''E. coli'' will lose the ability to internalize AI-2 (because of [[catabolite repression]]). When grown normally, [[AI-2]] presence is transient.

''E. coli'' and ''Salmonella enterica'' do not produce AHL signals commonly found in other Gram-negative bacteria. However, they have a receptor that detects AHLs from other bacteria and change their gene expression in accordance with the presence of other "quorate" populations of Gram-negative bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ahmer, B.M. |title=Cell-to-cell signalling in ''Escherichia coli'' and ''Salmonella enterica'' |journal=Mol. Microbiol. |volume=52 |issue=4 |pages=933–45 |date=May 2004 |pmid=15130116 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2958.2004.04054.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Gram Positive Bacteria Quorum Sensing.pdf|thumb|213x213px|Gram positive bacteria quorum sensing]]

====''Salmonella enterica''====
''[[Salmonella]]'' encodes a LuxR homolog, SdiA, but does not encode an AHL synthase. SdiA detects AHLs produced by other species of bacteria including ''Aeromonas hydrophila'', ''Hafnia alvei'', and ''Yersinia enterocolitica''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Michael, B. |author2=Smith, J.N. |author3=Swift, S. |author4=Heffron, F. |author5=Ahmer, B.M. |title=SdiA of Salmonella enterica is a LuxR homolog that detects mixed microbial communities |journal= J.

However, SdiA does become activated when ''Salmonella'' transits through turtles colonized with ''Aeromonas hydrophila'' or mice infected with ''Yersinia enterocolitica''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Smith, J.N. |author2=Dyszel, J.L. |author3=Soares, J.A. |title=SdiA, an N-acylhomoserine lactone receptor, becomes active during the transit of Salmonella enterica through the gastrointestinal tract of turtles |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=3 |issue=7 |pages=e2826 |year=2008 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0002826 |pmid=18665275 |pmc=2475663 |editor=Ausubel, Frederick M.|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dyszel, J.L. |author2=Smith, J.N. |author3=Lucas, D.E. |title=Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium can detect acyl homoserine lactone production by Yersinia enterocolitica in mice |journal=J.

====''Pseudomonas aeruginosa''====
The opportunistic pathogen ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' uses quorum sensing to coordinate the formation of [[biofilm]], [[swarming motility]], [[exopolysaccharide]] production, virulence, and cell aggregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lewis Sauer, K. |author2=Camper, A. |author3=Ehrlich, G. |author4=Costerton, J. |author5=Davies, D. |title=Pseudomonas aeruginosa displays multiple phenotypes during development as a biofilm |journal=Journal of Bacteriology |volume=184 |issue=4 |pages=1140–54 |year=2002 |issn=0021-9193 |doi=10.1128/jb.184.4.1140-1154.2002 |pmid=11807075 |pmc=134825}}&lt;/ref&gt; These bacteria can grow within a host without harming it, until they reach a threshold concentration. Then they become aggressive, developing to the point at which their numbers are sufficient to overcome the host's [[immune system]], and form a [[biofilm]], leading to [[disease]] within the host as the biofilm is a protective layer encasing the bacteria population. Another form of [[gene regulation]] that allows the [[bacteria]] to rapidly adapt to surrounding changes is through environmental signaling. Recent studies have discovered that [[anaerobiosis]] can significantly impact the major regulatory circuit of quorum sensing. This important link between quorum sensing and anaerobiosis has a significant impact on production of virulence factors of this [[organism]].&lt;ref name=Cornelis&gt;{{cite book |author=Cornelis, P. (ed.) |title=Pseudomonas: Genomics and Molecular Biology |edition=1st |publisher=Caister Academic Press |year=2008 |url= http://www.horizonpress.com/pseudo |isbn=1-904455-19-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Garlic]] and ginseng experimentally block quorum sensing in ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Thomas Bjarnsholt |author2=Peter Østrup Jensen |author3=Thomas B.

Disrupting the signalling process in this way is called ''quorum sensing inhibition''.

Certain bacteria can produce enzymes called [[lactonase]]s that can target and inactivate AHLs.
Researchers have developed novel molecules which block the signalling receptors of bacteria (Quorum quenching). mBTL is a compound that has been shown to inhibit quorum sensing and decrease the amount of cell death by a significant amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = O'Loughlin | first1 = CT. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2013 | title = A quorum-sensing inhibitor blocks Pseudomonas aeruginosa virulence and biofilm formation | journal = PNAS | volume = 110 | issue = 44| pages = 17981–6 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1316981110 | pmid=24143808 | pmc=3816427}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Additionally, researchers are also examining the role of natural compounds (such as [[caffeine]]) as potential quorum sensing inhibitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Norizan | first1 = S. | last2 = Chan | first2 = K. | year = 2013 | title = Caffeine as a potential quorum-sensing inhibitor | url = | journal = Sensors | volume = 13 | issue = 4| pages = 5117–5129 | doi = 10.3390/s130405117 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research in this area has been promising and could lead to the development of natural compounds as effective therapeutics.

===Evolution===

====Sequence analysis====
The majority of quorum sensing systems that fall under the "two-gene" (an autoinducer synthase coupled with a receptor molecule) paradigm as defined by the ''[[Vibrio fischeri]]'' system occur in the [[Gram-negative]] [[Proteobacteria]]. A comparison between the Proteobacteria [[phylogeny]] as generated by [[16S ribosomal RNA]] sequences and phylogenies of LuxI-, LuxR-, or LuxS-homologs shows a notably high level of global similarity. Overall, the quorum sensing genes seem to have diverged along with the Proteobacteria phylum as a whole. This indicates that these quorum sensing systems are quite ancient, and arose very early in the Proteobacteria lineage.&lt;ref name="gray-2001"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gray, K.M. |author2=Garey, J.R. |title=The evolution of bacterial LuxI and LuxR quorum sensing regulators |journal=Microbiology |volume= 147 |year=2001 |pages=2379–87 |pmid=11496014 |issue=Pt 8 | doi = 10.1099/00221287-147-8-2379 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lerat-2004"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lerat, E. |author2=Moran, N.A. |title=Evolutionary history of quorum-sensing systems in bacteria |journal= Molecular Biology and Evolution |volume=21 |year=2004 |pages=903–13 |doi=10.1093/molbev/msh097 |pmid=15014168 |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although examples of [[horizontal gene transfer]] are apparent in LuxI, LuxR, and LuxS phylogenies, they are relatively rare. This result is in line with the observation that quorum sensing genes tend to control the expression of a wide array of genes scattered throughout the bacterial chromosome. A recent acquisition by horizontal gene transfer would be unlikely to have integrated itself to this degree. Given that the majority of autoinducer–synthase/receptor occurs in tandem in bacterial genomes, it is also rare that they switch partners and so pairs tend to co-evolve.&lt;ref name="lerat-2004"/&gt;

In quorum sensing genes of [[Gammaproteobacteria]], which includes ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' and ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', the LuxI/LuxR genes form a functional pair, with LuxI as the auto-inducer synthase and LuxR as the receptor. Gamma Proteobacteria are unique in possessing quorum sensing genes, which, although functionally similar to the LuxI/LuxR genes, have a markedly divergent sequence.&lt;ref name="lerat-2004"/&gt; This family of quorum-sensing [[homology (biology)|homologs]] may have arisen in the gamma Proteobacteria ancestor, although the cause of their extreme sequence divergence yet maintenance of functional similarity has yet to be explained. In addition, species that employ multiple discrete quorum sensing systems are almost all members of the gamma Proteobacteria, and evidence of horizontal transfer of quorum sensing genes is most evident in this class.&lt;ref name="gray-2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lerat-2004"/&gt;

====Controversy====
As quorum sensing implies a cooperative behavior, this concept has been challenged by the evolutionary implication of cooperative cheaters. This is circumvented by the concept of ''diffusion sensing'', which has been an alternative and complementary model to quorum sensing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Redfield|first1=RJ|title=Is quorum sensing a side effect of diffusion sensing|journal=Trends in Microbiology|date=2002|volume=10|issue=8|pages=365–370|pmid=12160634|doi=10.1016/s0966-842x(02)02400-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, both explanations face the problems of signalling in either complex (multiple species sharing the same space) or simple (one single cell confined to a limited volume) environments where the spatial distribution of the cells can be more important for sensing than the cell population density. A new model, ''efficiency sensing'', which takes into account both problematics, population density and spatial confinement, has been proposed as an alternative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hense, B.A. |author2=Kuttler, C. |author3=Müller, J. |author4=Rothballer, M. |author5=Hartmann, A. |author6=Kreft, J.U. |title=Does efficiency sensing unify diffusion and quorum sensing? |journal=Nature Reviews Microbiology |volume=5 |pages=230–39 |year=2007 |pmid=17304251 |url=http://www.nature.com/nrmicro/journal/v5/n3/full/nrmicro1600.html |doi=10.1038/nrmicro1600 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the probable reasons for controversy is that current terminologies (quorum sensing, diffusion sensing, efficiency sensing) arise from different models of how natural selection has acted to shape and maintain the process.  Since each of the various models does apply under some circumstances but not others, a sensible resolution to these controversies could be to return the terminology of the process to autoinduction, as originally described by Hastings and coworkers, as this term does not imply understanding of the function of the process.

====Interaction of quorum-sensing molecules with mammalian cells and its medical applications====
Next to the potential antimicrobial functionality, quorum-sensing derived molecules, especially the peptides, are being investigated for their use in other therapeutic domains as well, including immunology, central nervous system disorders and oncology.

====''Methanosaeta harundinacea'' 6Ac====

==Plants==
Quorum sensing could be described when it was known that bacteria possess the ability to communicate. In the last few years, interactions between bacteria and [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] hosts, such as plants, have been shown. These interactions are facilitated by quorum-sensing molecules and play a major role in maintaining the pathogenicity of bacteria towards other hosts, such as humans. This mechanism can be understood by looking at the effects of [[N-Acyl homoserine lactone]] (AHL), one of the quorum sensing-signalling molecules in [[gram-negative bacteria]], on plants. The model organism used is ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Götz-Rösch |first=Christine |last2=Sieper |first2=Tina |last3=Fekete |first3=Agnes |last4=Schmitt-Kopplin |first4=Philippe |last5=Hartmann |first5=Anton |last6=Schröder |first6=Peter |date=2015-04-10 |title=Influence of bacterial N-acyl-homoserine lactones on growth parameters, pigments, antioxidative capacities and the xenobiotic phase II detoxification enzymes in barley and yam bean |journal=Frontiers in Plant Science |volume=6 |doi=10.3389/fpls.2015.00205 |issn=1664-462X |pmc=4392610 |pmid=25914699}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of AHLs having long carbon-chains (C12, C14), which have an unknown receptor mechanism, is less well understood than AHLs having short carbon-chains (C4, C6, C8), which are perceived by the [[G protein-coupled receptor]]. A phenomenon called "AHL priming", which is a dependent signalling pathway, enhanced our knowledge of long-chain AHLs. The role of quorum-sensing molecules was better explained according to three categories: host physiology–based impact of quorum sensing molecules; ecological effects; and cellular signaling. Calcium signalling and [[calmodulin]] have a large role in short-chain AHLs response in ''Arabidopsis''. Research was also conducted on [[barley]] and crop [[Pachyrhizus erosus|yam bean]] that reveals the AHLs determining the detoxification enzymes called [[Glutathione S-transferase|GST]] were found less in yam bean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hartmann |first=Anton |last2=Schikora |first2=Adam |date=2015-08-19 |title=Editorial: Plant responses to bacterial quorum sensing molecules |journal=Frontiers in Plant Science |volume=6 |doi=10.3389/fpls.2015.00643 |issn=1664-462X |pmc=4541025 |pmid=26347761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quorum sensing-based regulatory systems are necessary to plant-disease-causing bacteria. Looking towards developing new strategies based on plant-associated microbiomes, the aim of further study is to improve the quantity and quality of the food supply.

==Social insects==
Social insect colonies are an excellent example of a [[decentralized system]], because no individual is in charge of directing or making decisions for the colony. Several groups of social insects have been shown to use quorum sensing in a process that resembles collective decision-making.

===Examples===

====Ants====
Colonies of the ant ''[[Temnothorax albipennis]]'' nest in small crevices between rocks. When the rocks shift and the nest is broken up, these ants must quickly choose a new nest to move into. During the first phase of the decision-making process, a small portion of the workers leave the destroyed nest and search for new crevices. When one of these scout ants finds a potential nest, she assesses the quality of the crevice based on a variety of factors including the size of the interior, the number of openings (based on light level), and the presence or absence of dead ants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Franks, N.R. |author2=Dornhaus, A. |title=Not everything that counts can be counted: ants use multiple metrics for a single nest trait |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=273 |issue=1583 |pages=165–9 |year=2006 |pmid=16555783 |pmc=1560019 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2005.3312|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Franks, N.R. |author2=Hooper, J. |title=Tomb evaders: house-hunting hygiene in ants |journal=Biology Letters |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=190–2 |year=2005 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2005.0302 |pmid=17148163 |pmc=1626204|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The worker then returns to the destroyed nest, where she waits for a short period before recruiting other workers to follow her to the nest that she has found, using a process called [[tandem running]]. The waiting period is inversely related to the quality of the site; for instance, a worker that has found a poor site will wait longer than a worker that encountered a good site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Mallon, E.B. |author2=Pratt, S.C. |title=Individual and collective decision-making during nest site selection by the ant ''Leptothorax albipennis'' |journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=352–9 |year=2001 |doi=10.1007/s002650100377|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the new recruits visit the potential nest site and make their own assessment of its quality, the number of ants visiting the crevice increases. During this stage, ants may be visiting many different potential nests. However, because of the differences in the waiting period, the number of ants in the best nest will tend to increase at the greatest rate. Eventually, the ants in this nest will sense that the rate at which they encounter other ants has exceeded a particular threshold, indicating that the quorum number has been reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pratt, S.C. |title=Quorum sensing by encounter rates in the ant ''Temnothorax albipennis'' |journal=Behavioral Ecology |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=488–96 |year=2005 |doi=10.1093/beheco/ari020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the ants sense a quorum, they return to the destroyed nest and begin rapidly carrying the brood, queen, and fellow workers to the new nest. Scouts that are still tandem-running to other potential sites are also recruited to the new nest, and the entire colony moves. Thus, although no single worker may have visited and compared all of the available options, quorum sensing enables the colony as a whole to quickly make good decisions about where to move.

====Honey bees====
[[Honey bee]]s (''Apis mellifera'') also use quorum sensing to make decisions about new nest sites. Large colonies reproduce through a process called [[swarming (honeybee)|swarming]], in which the queen leaves the hive with a portion of the workers to form a new nest elsewhere. After leaving the nest, the workers form a swarm that hangs from a branch or overhanging structure. This swarm persists during the decision-making phase until a new nest site is chosen.

The quorum sensing process in honey bees is similar to the method used by ''[[Temnothorax]]'' ants in several ways. A small portion of the workers leave the swarm to search out new nest sites, and each worker assesses the quality of the cavity it finds. The worker then returns to the swarm and recruits other workers to her cavity using the honey bee [[waggle dance]]. However, instead of using a time delay, the number of dance repetitions the worker performs is dependent on the quality of the site. Workers that found poor nests stop dancing sooner, and can therefore be recruited to the better sites. Once the visitors to a new site sense that a quorum number (usually 10–20 bees) has been reached, they return to the swarm and begin using a new recruitment method called piping. This vibration signal causes the swarm to take off and fly to the new nest location. In an experimental test, this decision-making process enabled honey bee swarms to choose the best nest site in four out of five trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Seeley, T.D. |author2=Visscher, P.K. |title=Group decision making in nest-site selection by honey bees |journal=Apidologie |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=101–16 |year=2004 |doi=10.1051/apido:2004004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Seeley, T.D. |author2=Visscher, P.K. |title=Group decision making in honey bee swarms |journal=American Scientist |volume=94 |issue=3 |pages=220–9 |year=2006 |doi=10.1511/2006.3.220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computing and robotics==
Quorum sensing can be a useful tool for improving the function of self-organizing networks such as the SECOAS (Self-Organizing Collegiate Sensor) environmental monitoring system. In this system, individual nodes sense that there is a population of other nodes with similar data to report. The population then nominates just one node to report the data, resulting in power savings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Britton |first=M. |last2=Sacks |first2=L. |title=The SECOAS Project—Development of a Self-Organising, Wireless Sensor Network for Environmental Monitoring |journal=SANPA |year=2004 |url=http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/projects/secoas/papers/SANPA-2004-Britton.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216223909/http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/projects/secoas/papers/SANPA-2004-Britton.pdf |archivedate=2008-12-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ad-hoc wireless networks can also benefit from quorum sensing, by allowing the system to detect and respond to network conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |author1=Peysakhov, M. |author2=Regli, W. |booktitle=Proceedings 2005 IEEE Swarm Intelligence Symposium, 2005. SIS 2005 |conference=Swarm Intelligence Symposium, Proceedings 2005 IEEE |year=2005 |pages=357–64 |title=Ant inspired server population management in a service based computing environment |doi=10.1109/SIS.2005.1501643 |isbn=0-7803-8916-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quorum sensing can also be used to coordinate the behavior of autonomous robot swarms. Using a process similar to that used by ''Temnothorax'' ants, robots can make rapid group decisions without the direction of a controller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Sahin |first=E. |last2=Franks |first2=N. |title=Measurement of Space: From Ants to Robots |booktitle=Proceedings of WGW 2002: EPSRC/BBSRC International Workshop |year= 2002 |citeseerx = 10.1.1.161.6407 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11334">'''Social sculpture''' is a phrase to describe an expanded concept of [[art]] that was invented by the artist and co-founder of the German Green Party, [[Joseph Beuys]]. Beuys created the term "social sculpture" to embody his understanding of art's potential to transform society. As a work of art, a social sculpture includes human activity that strives to structure and shape society or the environment. The central idea of a social sculptor is an artist who creates structures in society using language, thoughts, actions, and objects.

== Concept ==

[[Image:7thousand oaks.jpg|thumb|200px|Some of the [[7000 Oaks|7,000 Oaks]] planted between 1982 and 1987 for Documenta 7 (1982)]]
During the 1960s, Beuys formulated his central theoretical concepts concerning the social, cultural and political function and potential of art. Indebted to Romantic writers such as [[Novalis]] and [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]], Beuys was motivated by a utopian belief in the power of universal human creativity and was confident in the potential for art to bring about revolutionary change. These ideas were founded in the social ideas of [[anthroposophy]] and the work of [[Rudolf Steiner]], of which he was a vigorous and original proponent. This translated into Beuys' formulation of the concept of social sculpture, in which society as a whole was to be regarded as one great work of art (the Wagnerian Gesamtkunstwerk) to which each person can contribute creatively (perhaps Beuys' most famous phrase, borrowed from Novalis, is "Everyone is an artist"). In the video "Willoughby SHARP,'' Joseph Beuys, Public Dialogues'' (1974/120 min)", a record of Beuys' first major public discussion in the U.S., Beuys elaborates three principles: Freedom, Democracy, and Socialism, saying that each of them depends on the other two in order to be meaningful.  In 1973, Beuys wrote:

: ''"Only on condition of a radical widening of definitions will it be possible for art and activities related to art [to] provide evidence that art is now the only evolutionary-revolutionary power. Only art is capable of dismantling the repressive effects of a senile social system that continues to totter along the deathline: to dismantle in order to build ‘A SOCIAL ORGANISM AS A WORK OF ART’… EVERY HUMAN BEING IS AN ARTIST who – from his state of freedom – the position of freedom that he experiences at first-hand – learns to determine the other positions of the TOTAL ART WORK OF THE FUTURE SOCIAL ORDER."''&lt;ref&gt;Beuys statement dated 1973, first published in English in Caroline Tisdall: Art into Society, Society into Art (ICA, London, 1974), p.48. Capitals in original.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, he was invited to create a work for [[Documenta]] 7. He delivered a large pile of basalt stones. From above, one could see that the pile of stones was a large arrow pointing to a single oak tree that he had planted. He announced that the stones should not be moved unless an oak tree was planted in the new location of the stone. [[7000 Oaks|7,000 oak trees]] were then planted in Kassel, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Reames, ''Arborsculpture: Solutions for a Small Planet'', 2005 p.42 {{ISBN|0-9647280-8-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This project exemplified the idea that a social sculpture was defined as interdisciplinary and participatory.

In 1991, "[[The Thing (art project)|The Thing]]" took its inspiration from the concept of social sculpture.

In 2007, at [[Documenta|Documenta 12]], Kirill Preobrazhenskiy created work "Tram 4 Inner Voice Radio". His work was compared by critics with Beuys' oaks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,488870,00.html Spiegel]:

Some of the art at this year's Documenta has escaped the confines of the exhibition halls and intervened in Kassel's public spaces -- like Kirill Preobrazhenskiy's "Tram 4 Inner Voice Radio," a sound installation played on a busy public transportation route.

This strategy has been tried before, though. From 1982 through 1987, Joseph Beuys came to Kassel and planted 7,000 trees alongside slabs of stone as part of an installation called "7,000 Oaks," for Documenta 7. Visitors still snap photos of the trees, which have become an internationally renowned work of art. Kassel residents rarely take a second glance.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization for direct democracy through plebiscite==
The "Organization for direct democracy through plebiscite" was founded by the artists Joseph Beuys, Johannes Stüttgen and Karl Fastabend on June 19, 1971 in Düsseldorf as a political organization. The goal was influencing social patterns with implementing Beuys' concept of the extended notion of art and the social sculpture via political means. Today,{{when|date=January 2016}} Johannes Stüttgen spread the idea for direct democracy with the project "Omnibus".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.omnibus.org/fileadmin/omnibus.org/PDF/Sonstiges/4_Seiter_2008_engl_web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==The individual ==
Beuys believed everybody was an artist. He once said "every sphere of human activity, even peeling a potato can be a work of art as long as it is a conscious act," the idea being that every decision you make should be thought out and attempt to make or contribute to a work of art which in the end is society.  Individuality and well-educated decisions are promoted in the person while the government is made of those decisions put into referendums.  This point of view invites followers to humble themselves by realizing that they are an important part of a whole not only an individual.&lt;ref&gt;Weintraub, Danto, Mcevilley.

A '''spoken language''' is a [[language]] produced  by articulate sounds, as opposed to a [[written language]]. Many languages have no written form and so are only spoken. An '''oral language''' or '''vocal language''' is a language produced with the vocal tract, as opposed to a [[sign language]], which is produced with the hands and face. The term "spoken language" is sometimes used to mean only vocal languages, especially by linguists, making all three terms synonyms by excluding sign languages. Others refer to sign language as "spoken", especially in contrast to written transcriptions of signs.&lt;ref&gt;Nora Groce (1985) ''Everyone Here Spoke Sign Language: Hereditary Deafness on Martha's Vineyard''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harry Hoemann (1986) ''Introduction to American sign language''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brooks &amp; Kempe (2012) ''Language Development''&lt;/ref&gt;

In spoken language, much of the meaning is determined by the context. That contrasts with written language in which more of the meaning is provided directly by the text. In spoken language, the truth of a proposition is determined by common-sense reference to experience, but in written language, a greater emphasis is placed on logical and coherent argument. Similarly, spoken language tends to convey subjective information, including the relationship between the speaker and the audience, whereas written language tends to convey objective information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tannen|first=Deborah|title=Spoken and written language: exploring orality and literacy|year=1982|publisher=ABLEX Pub. Corp.|location=Norwood, N.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between spoken language and written language is complex. Within the field of [[linguistics]] the current consensus is that speech is an innate human capability, and written language is a cultural invention.&lt;ref&gt;Pinker, S., &amp; Bloom, P. (1990). Natural language and natural selection. ''Behavioral and Brain Sciences'', 13, 707–784.&lt;/ref&gt; However some linguists, such as those of the [[Prague school (linguistics)|Prague school]], argue that written and spoken language possess distinct qualities which would argue against written language being dependent on spoken language for its existence.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron, P. G., &amp; Joshi, R. M. (2006). Written language is as natural as spoken language: A biolinguistic perspective. ''Reading Psychology'', 27(4), 263–311.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both vocal and sign languages are composed of [[word]]s. In vocal languages, words are made up from a limited set of [[vowels]] and [[consonants]], and often [[tone (phonology)|tone]]. In sign languages, words are made up from a limited set of shapes, orientations, locations movements of the hands, and often facial expressions; in both cases, the building blocks are called [[phoneme]]s. In both vocal and sign languages, words are [[grammar|grammatically]] and [[prosody (linguistics)|prosodically]] linked into [[phrase (grammar)|phrase]]s, [[clause (grammar)|clause]]s, and larger units of [[discourse]].

Hearing children acquire as their [[first language]] the language that is used around them, whether vocal, cued (if they are sighted) signed. Deaf children can do the same with Cued Speech or sign language if either visual communication system is used around them. Vocal language are traditionally taught to them in the same way that written language must be taught to hearing children.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38953">In relation to the [[chemical elements]], a '''symbol''' is a code for a chemical element.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;This should not be confused with formula. When a number is present at the bottom right corner of the symbol of the element, only then is it said to be a formula, but if the number is not present, it is a symbol.&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[functional group]]s have their own chemical symbol, e.g. Ph for the [[phenyl group]], and Me for the [[methyl group]]. Chemical symbols for elements normally consist of one or two letters from the Latin alphabet, but can contain three when the element has a [[Systematic element name|systematic temporary name]] (as of March 2017, no discovered elements have such a name), and are written with the first letter capitalized.

Earlier chemical element symbols stem from classical [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] vocabulary. For some elements, this is because the material was known in ancient times, while for others, the name is a more recent invention. For example, "He" is the symbol for [[helium]] ([[New Latin]] name, not known in [[ancient Roman]] times), "Pb" for [[lead]] (''plumbum'' in Latin), and "Hg" for [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] (''hydrargyrum'' in Greek). Some symbols come from other sources, like "W" for [[tungsten]] (''Wolfram'' in German, not known in Roman times).

[[Systematic element name|Temporary symbols]] assigned to newly or not-yet synthesized elements use 3-letter symbols based on their atomic numbers. For example, "Uno" was the temporary symbol for [[hassium]] (element 108) which had the temporary name of ''unniloctium''.

Chemical symbols may be modified by the use of prepended [[Subscript and superscript|superscripts or subscripts]] to specify a particular [[isotope]] of an atom. Additionally, appended superscripts may be used to indicate the [[ionization]] or [[oxidation state]] of an element. They are widely used in chemistry and they have been officially chosen by the [[IUPAC|International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC). There are also some historical symbols that are no longer officially used.

[[File:Atomic Symbol.jpg|thumb|This is an example of an atomic symbol. The text boxes explain where the numbers are derived from.]]
Attached subscripts or superscripts specifying a nuclide or molecule have the following meanings and positions:
* The [[nucleon]] number ([[mass number]]) is shown in the left superscript position (e.g., &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N). This number defines the specific isotope. Various letters, such as "m" and "f" may also be used here to indicate a [[nuclear isomer]] (e.g., [[Technetium-99m|&lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc]]). Alternately, the number here can represent a specific [[quantum state|spin state]] (e.g., [[Singlet oxygen|&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]). These details can be omitted if not relevant in a certain context.
* The proton number ([[atomic number]]) may be indicated in the left subscript position (e.g., &lt;sub&gt;64&lt;/sub&gt;Gd). The atomic number is redundant to the chemical element, but is sometimes used to emphasize the change of numbers of nucleons in a nuclear reaction.
* If necessary, a state of [[ionization]] or an [[excited state]] may be indicated in the right superscript position (e.g., state of ionization Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;).
* The number of atoms of an element in a [[molecule]] or [[chemical compound]] is shown in the right subscript position (e.g., N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). If this number is one, it is normally omitted - the number one is then implicit.
* A [[radical (chemistry)|radical]] is indicated by a dot on the right side (e.g., Cl&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt; for a neutral chlorine atom). This is often omitted unless relevant to a certain context because it is already deducible from the charge and atomic number information values.
In [[Chinese language|Chinese]], each chemical element has a dedicated [[Chinese character|character]], usually created for the purpose (see [[Chemical elements in East Asian languages]]). However, Latin symbols are also used, especially in formulas.

[[File:Simple Periodic Table Chart-en.svg|thumb|The [[periodic table]], elements being denoted by their symbols]]
A list of current, dated, as well as proposed and historical signs and symbols is included here with its [[definition|signification]]. Also given is each element's [[atomic number]], [[atomic weight]] or the [[atomic mass]] of the most stable [[isotope]], group and period numbers on the [[periodic table]], and [[etymology]] of the symbol.

[[Chemical hazard|Hazard pictographs]] are another type of symbols used in chemistry.

==Symbols for chemical elements==
{{#section-h:List of chemical elements|List}}
'''Antimatter''' atoms are denoted by a bar above the symbol for their matter counterpart, so e.g. &lt;span style="text-decoration: overline"&gt;H&lt;/span&gt; is the symbol for [[antihydrogen]].

==Symbols and names not currently used==

===Pictographic symbols===
The following is a list of pictographic symbols employed to symbolize elements known since ancient times (for example to the [[alchemy|alchemists]]).  Not included in this list are symbolic representations of substances previously called elements (such as certain [[Rare earth element|rare earth]] mineral blends and the [[classical element]]s [[fire (classical element)|fire]] and [[water (classical element)|water]] of ancient philosophy) which are known today to be multi-atomic.  Also not included are symbolic representations currently used for elements in other languages such as the [[Chemical elements in East Asian languages|Chinese characters for elements]].  Modern alphabetic notation was introduced in 1814 by [[Jöns Jakob Berzelius]].

==Symbols for named isotopes==
The following is a [[table of nuclides (complete)|list of isotopes]] of elements given in the previous tables which have been designated unique symbols.  By this it is meant that a comprehensive list of current systematic symbols (in the &lt;sup&gt;u&lt;/sup&gt;Atom form) are not included in the list and can instead be found in the [[Template:Isotope index|Isotope index]] chart. The symbols for the named [[isotopes of hydrogen]], [[deuterium]] (D) and [[tritium]] (T) are still in use today, as is [[thoron]] (Tn) for radon-220 (though not [[actinon]]; An is usually used instead for a generic [[actinide]]). [[Heavy water]] and other [[deuterated solvents]] are commonly used in chemistry, and it is convenient to use a single character rather than a symbol with a subscript in these cases. The practice also continues with tritium compounds. When the name of the solvent is given, a lowercase d is sometimes used. For example, d&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-benzene and C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;D&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; can be used instead of [&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=SectionH&gt;{{cite web|last1=IUPAC|title=Isotopically Modified Compounds|url=http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iupac/sectionH/|publisher=IUPAC|accessdate=31 March 2015|ref=SectionH}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The symbols for isotopes of elements other than hydrogen and radon are no longer in use within the scientific community. Many of these symbols were designated during the early years of [[radiochemistry]], and several isotopes (namely those in the [[actinium]] decay family, the [[radium]] decay family, and the [[thorium]] decay family) bear placeholder names using the early naming system devised by [[Ernest Rutherford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |editor-last= Morgan|editor-first= G.

[[File:Medieval tally sticks.jpg|thumb|320px|right|Medieval English split tally stick ([[Obverse and reverse|front and reverse]] view). The stick is notched and inscribed to record a debt owed to the [[rural dean]] of [[Preston Candover]], Hampshire, of a [[tithe]] of 20[[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|d]] each on 32 sheep, amounting to a total sum of £2 13s. 4d.]]
A '''tally stick''' (or simply '''tally'''&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|tally}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was an ancient memory aid device used to record and document numbers, quantities, or even messages. Tally sticks first appear as animal bones carved with notches during the [[Upper Paleolithic]]; a notable example is the [[Ishango Bone]]. Historical reference is made by [[Pliny the Elder]] (AD 23–79) about the best wood to use for tallies, and by [[Marco Polo]] (1254–1324) who mentions the use of the tally in China. Tallies have been used for numerous purposes such as messaging and scheduling, and especially in financial and legal transactions, {{citation needed span|text=to the point of being [[currency]].|date=January 2018}}

==Kinds of tallies==
[[File:SAM PC 1 - Tally sticks 1 - Overview.jpg|thumb|Single and split tallies from the [[Swiss Alps]], 18th to early 20th century ([[Swiss Alpine Museum]])]]
Principally, there are two different kinds of tally sticks: the single tally and the split tally. A common form of the same kind of primitive counting device is seen in various kinds of [[prayer beads]].

===Paleolithic tally sticks===
A number of anthropological artefacts have been conjectured to be tally sticks:

*the [[Ishango bone]] is a [[bone tool]], dated to the [[Upper Paleolithic]] era, around 18,000 to 20,000&amp;nbsp;BC. It is a dark brown length of bone, the [[fibula]] of a baboon. It has a series of [[tally mark]]s carved in three columns running the length of the tool. It was found in 1960 in Belgian Congo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maths.uwa.edu.au/~schultz/3M3/history.html A very brief history of pure mathematics: The Ishango Bone] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080721075947/http://www.maths.uwa.edu.au/%7Eschultz/3M3/history.html |date=21 July 2008 }} University of Western Australia School of Mathematics – accessed January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ''[[Lebombo Bone]]'' is a [[baboon]]'s [[fibula]] with 29 distinct notches, discovered within the [[Border Cave]] in the [[Lebombo Mountains]] of [[Swaziland]]. 
*The so-called ''Wolf bone'' &lt;small&gt;([[:cs:Vlčí radius|cs]])&lt;/small&gt; is a prehistoric artefact discovered in 1937 in [[Czechoslovakia]] during excavations at [[Dolní Věstonice (archaeology)|Vestonice]], [[Moravia]], led by [[Karel Absolon|Karl Absolon]]. Dated to the [[Aurignacian]], approximately 30,000 years ago, the bone is marked with 55 marks which some believe to be [[tally mark]]s. The head of an ivory [[Venus figurine]] was excavated close to the bone.&lt;ref&gt;*Graham Flegg, ''Numbers: their history and meaning'', Courier Dover Publications, 2002 {{ISBN|978-0-486-42165-0}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;41–42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beckmann|first1=Petr|title=A History of {{pi}} (PI)|date=1971|publisher=The Golem Press|location=Boulder, Colorado|isbn=978-0-911762-12-9|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Single tally===
The single tally stick was an elongated piece of bone, ivory, wood, or stone which is marked with a system of notches (see: [[Tally marks]]). The single tally stick serves predominantly [[mnemonic]] purposes. Related to the single tally concept are messenger sticks (e.g., Inuit tribes), the knotted cords, ''[[khipu]]s'' or ''quipus'', as used by the [[Inca]]. [[Herodotus]] (c. 485–425 BC) reported  the use of a knotted cord by [[Darius I of Persia]] (c. 521–486 BC).

===Split tally===
The split tally was a technique which became common in medieval Europe, which was constantly short of money (coins) and predominantly illiterate, in order to record bilateral exchange and debts. A stick (squared hazelwood sticks were most common) was marked with a system of notches and then split lengthwise. This way the two halves both record the same notches and each party to the transaction received one half of the marked stick as proof. Later this technique was refined in various ways and became virtually tamper proof. One of the refinements was to make the two halves of the stick of different lengths. The longer part was called ''stock'' and was given to the party which had advanced money (or other items) to the receiver. The shorter portion of the stick was called ''foil'' and was given to the party which had received the funds or goods. Using this technique each of the parties had an identifiable record of the transaction. The natural irregularities in the surfaces of the tallies where they were split would mean that only the original two halves would fit back together perfectly, and so would verify that they were matching halves of the same transaction. If one party tried to unilaterally change the value of his half of the tally stick by adding more notches, the absence of those notches would be apparent on the other party's tally stick. The split tally was accepted as legal proof in medieval courts and the [[Napoleonic Code]] (1804) still makes reference to the tally stick in Article 1333.&lt;ref&gt;

Retrieved 13 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  Along the [[Danube]] and in [[Switzerland]] the tally was still used in the 20th century in rural economies.

He would accept the tally stick only for taxes, and it was a tool of the [[Exchequer]] for the collection of taxes by local sheriffs (tax farmers "farming the shire"){{citation needed|date=March 2018}} for seven centuries. The split tally of the Exchequer was in continuous use until 1826. In 1834 tally sticks representing six centuries worth of financial records were ordered to be burned in a stove in the [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]]. The resulting fire set the chimney ablaze and then spread until [[Burning of Parliament|most of the building was destroyed]].&lt;ref name="BBC_Radio_50_Things" /&gt; This event was described by [[Charles Dickens]] in an 1855 article on administrative reform.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Dickens, "Administrative Reform" (June 27, 1855) Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=bT5WAAAAcAAJ Speeches literary and social by Charles Dickens]'' (1870) pp.133–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The system of tally marks of the Exchequer is described in ''[[Dialogue concerning the exchequer|The Dialogue Concerning the Exchequer]]'' (see external links below) as follows:
{{quote|The manner of cutting is as follows. At the top of the tally a cut is made, the thickness of the palm of the hand, to represent a thousand pounds; then a hundred pounds by a cut the breadth of a thumb; twenty pounds, the breadth of the little finger; a single pound, the width of a swollen barleycorn; a shilling rather narrower; then a penny is marked by a single cut without removing any wood.|}}
The cuts were made the full width of the stick so that, after splitting, the portion kept by the issuer (the ''stock'') exactly matched the piece (the ''foil'') given as a receipt. Each stick had to have the details of the transaction written on it, in ink, to make it a valid record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clanchy|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Clanchy|title=From Memory to Written Record|year=1979|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford, England|isbn=9780631168577|page=125|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Royal tallies (debt of the Crown) also played a role in the formation of the [[Bank of England]] at the end of the 17th century. In 1697, the bank issued £1 million worth of stock in exchange for £800,000 worth of tallies at par and £200,000 in bank notes. This new stock was said to be "engrafted". The government promised not only to pay the Bank interest on the tallies subscribed but to redeem them over a period of years. The "engrafted" stock was then cancelled simultaneously with the redemption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carswell|first1=John|title=The South Sea Bubble|date=1993|publisher=Alan Sutton Publishing Ltd|location=England|isbn=978-0-86299-918-6|page=24|edition=Revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Drunkard's Progress - Color.jpg|thumb|''The Drunkard's Progress'': by [[Nathaniel Currier]] 1846, warns that moderate drinking leads, step-by-step, to total disaster.|upright=1.5]]

The '''temperance movement''' is a [[social movement]] against the consumption of [[alcoholic beverage]]s. Participants in the movement typically criticize [[alcohol intoxication]] or promote complete abstinence ([[teetotalism]]), with leaders emphasizing alcohol's negative effects on health, personality, and family life. Typically the movement promotes [[alcohol education]], as well as demands new [[alcohol law|laws against the selling of alcohols]], or those regulating the availability of alcohol, or those completely [[prohibition|prohibiting]] it. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the Temperance Movement became prominent in many countries, particularly English-speaking and [[Scandinavia]]n ones, and it led to [[Prohibition in the United States]] from 1920 to 1933.

==Context==
In the late-seventeenth century, alcohol was a vital part of colonial life as a beverage, medicine, and commodity for men, women, and children. Drinking was widely accepted and completely integrated in society; however, drunkenness was not. Despite that, drunkenness was common and not often seen as a social problem.&lt;ref name="blocker" /&gt;{{rp|5}} The attitudes towards alcohol began to change in the late eighteenth century. One of the reasons for the shifting attitudes was the necessity for sober laborers to operate heavy machinery that had been developed as a result of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. [[Anthony Benezet]] suggested abstinence from alcohol in 1775.&lt;ref name="blocker" /&gt;{{rp|4}}&lt;ref name="clean" /&gt;{{rp|36–37}} As early as the 1790s, physician [[Benjamin Rush]] researched the danger that drinking alcohol could lead to disease that leads to a lack of self-control and he cited abstinence as the only treatment option.&lt;ref name="chavigny"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chavigny |first1=Katherine A. |editor1-last=Tracy |editor1-first=Sarah W. |editor2-last=Acker |editor2-first=Caroline Jean |title=Altering American Consciousness: The History of Alcohol and Drug Use in the United States, 1800–2000 |date=2004 |publisher=University of Massachusetts Press |location=Amherst, MA |isbn=978-1-55849-425-1 |chapter=Reforming Drunkards in Nineteenth-Century America: Religion, Medicine, Therapy}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|109}} Rush saw benefits in fermented drinks, but condemned the use of distilled spirits.&lt;ref name="clean" /&gt;{{rp|37}} As well as addiction, Rush noticed the correlation that drunkenness had with disease, death, suicide and crime. After the [[American Revolution]], Rush called upon ministers of various churches to act in preaching the messages of temperance.&lt;ref name="deliver"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Clark |first1=Norman H. |title=Deliver Us From Evil: An Interpretation of American Prohibition |date=1976 |publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company |location=New York |isbn=978-0393091700}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|23}} However, abstinence messages were largely ignored by Americans until the 1820s.&lt;ref name="clean" /&gt;{{rp|37}}

===Origins (pre-1820)===
In the eighteenth century, there was a "[[Gin Craze]]" in the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. The bourgeoisie became increasingly critical of the widespread drunkenness among the lower classes. Motivated by the bourgeoisie's desire for order, and amplified by the population growth in the cities, the drinking of gin became the subject of critical national debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Yeomans |first1=Henry |title=Alcohol and Moral Regulation: Public Attitudes, Spirited Measures and Victorian Hangovers. |date=2014 |publisher=[[Policy Press]] |isbn=9781447309932 |page=37 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=hJXhAwAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early nineteenth-century United States, alcohol was still regarded as a necessary part of the American diet for both practical and social reasons. On the one hand, water supplies were often polluted, milk was not always available, and coffee and tea was expensive. On the other hand, social construct of the time made it impolite for people (particularly men) to refuse alcohol.&lt;ref name="clean" /&gt;{{rp|37}} Drunkenness was not a problem, because people would only drink small amounts of alcohol throughout the day, but at the turn of the nineteenth-century, overindulgence and subsequent intoxication became an issue that led to the disintegration of the family.&lt;ref name="clean" /&gt;{{rp|37}} Early temperance societies often associated with churches were located in upstate New York and New England, but only lasted a few years. These early temperance societies called for moderate drinking, but had little influence outside of their geographical areas.

In 1743, [[John Wesley]], the founder of the [[Methodist Church]]es, proclaimed  "that buying, selling, and drinking of liquor, unless absolutely necessary, were evils to be avoided".&lt;ref name="Williams1984"&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=William Henry|title=The Garden of American Methodism: The Delmarva Peninsula, 1769-1820|year=1984|publisher=Peninsula Conference of the United Methodist Church|isbn=9780842022279|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1810, Calvinist ministers met with a seminary in Massachusetts to write articles about abstinence from alcohol to use in preaching to their congregations.&lt;ref name="clean" /&gt;{{rp|38}} The Massachusetts Society for the Suppression of Intemperance (MSSI) was formed in 1813.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hampel |first1=Robert L. |title=Temperance and Prohibition in Massachusetts 1813-1852 |date=1982 |publisher=UMI Research Press |location=Ann Arbor, Michigan |isbn=978-0835712910 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization only accepted men of high social standing and encouraged moderation in alcohol consumption. Its peak of influence was in 1818, but the MSSI ended in 1820 and made no significant mark on the future of the temperance movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hanson |first1=David J. |title=Massachusetts Society for the Suppression of Intemperance |url=https://www.alcoholproblemsandsolutions.org/massachusetts-society-for-the-suppression-of-intemperance/ |website=Alcohol Problems and Solutions |publisher=Sociology Department: State University of New York |accessdate=13 June 2018|date=2016-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="clean" /&gt;{{rp|38}} Other small temperance societies appear in the 1810s, but had little impact outside their immediate regions and they disbanded soon after. Their methods had little effect in implementing temperance, and drinking actually increased until after 1830; however, their methods of public pledges and meetings, as well as handing out of pamphlets, were implemented by more lasting temperance societies such as the American Temperance Society.&lt;ref name="clean" /&gt;{{rp|38}}

=== Promoting moderation (1820s–'30s) ===
[[File:Temperance song hand book.jpg|thumb|This is the songbook used at the Women's Temperance Organization from [[Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania]]]]
The temperance movement began at a national level in the 1820s, having been popularized by evangelical temperance reformers and among the middle classes.&lt;ref name="chavigny" /&gt;{{rp|109}}&lt;ref name="History.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="clean" /&gt;{{rp|38}}{{refn|group=note|Or, according to some scholars, in the 1790s.&lt;ref name="Benowitz"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|editor1-last=Benowitz|editor1-first=June Melby|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of American Women and Religion|edition=2nd|volume=2|date=2017|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|title=Temperance Movement|isbn=978-1-4408-3987-0|page=590|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Jm8tDwAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} There was a concentration on advice against hard spirits rather than on abstinence from all alcohol and on moral reform rather than legal measures against alcohol.&lt;ref name="Fryer"&gt;{{cite book|first=Peter|last=Fryer|year=1965|title=Mrs Grundy: Studies in English Prudery|pages=141–4|publisher=[[Corgi (publisher)|Corgi]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|One example was [[Benjamin Rush]]'s 1784 pamphlet ''An Inquiry Into the Effects of Ardent Spirits Upon the Human Body and Mind'', which advocated total abstinence of distilled liquors.&lt;ref name="Misiroglu" /&gt;}}  An early temperance movement began during the [[American Revolution]] in [[Connecticut]], [[Virginia]] and [[New York (state)|New York state]], with farmers forming associations to ban whiskey distilling. The movement spread to eight states, advocating temperance rather than abstinence and taking positions on religious issues such as observance of the [[Sabbath in Christianity|Sabbath]].&lt;ref name="blocker"&gt;{{cite book|last=Blocker|first=Jack S.|title=American Temperance Movements: Cycles of Reform|year=1989|publisher=Twayne Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[American Revolution]] there was a new emphasis on good citizenship for the new republic.&lt;ref name="Benowitz" /&gt; With the Evangelical Protestant religious revival of the 1820s and '30s, called the [[Second Great Awakening]], social movements began aiming for a perfect society. This included [[abolitionism]] and temperance.&lt;ref name="Benowitz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="History.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="clean"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Engs|first1=Ruth Clifford|title=Clean Living Movements: American Cycles of Health Reform|date=2000|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=Westport, CT|isbn=978-0-275-95994-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|23}} The Awakening brought with it an optimism about moral reform, achieved through volunteer organizations.&lt;ref name="fahey"&gt;{{Citation|last1=Fahey|first1=David M.|title=Temperance And Racism: John Bull, Johnny Reb, and the Good Templars|date=2015|publisher=[[University Press of Kentucky]]|isbn=978-0-8131-6151-8|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xLIfBgAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}} Although the temperance movement was nonsectarian in principle, the movement consisted mostly of church-goers.&lt;ref name="Benowitz" /&gt;

Beecher described inebriation as a "national sin" as well as suggesting legislation to prohibit the sales of alcohol.&lt;ref name="clean" /&gt;{{rp|24–25}} He believed that it was only possible for drinkers to reform in the early stages of addiction, because anyone in advanced stages of addiction, according to Beecher, had damaged their morality and could not be saved.&lt;ref name="chavigny" /&gt;{{rp|110}} Early temperance reformers often viewed drunkards as warnings rather than as victims of a disease, leaving the state to take care of them and their conduct.&lt;ref name="chavigny" /&gt;{{rp|110}} In the same year, the [[American Temperance Society]] (ATS) was formed in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], within 12 years claiming more than 8,000 local groups and over 1,250,000 members.&lt;ref name="woodworth"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Woodworth |first1=Jed |title=The Word of Wisdom |url=https://history.lds.org/article/doctrine-and-covenants-word-of-wisdom?lang=eng |website=Revelations in Context |publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints |accessdate=28 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cherrington"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cherrington |first1=Ernest H. |title=The Evolution of Prohibition in the United States: A chronological history of the liquor problem and the temperance reform in the United States from the earliest settlements to the consummation of national prohibition |date=1920 |publisher=The American Issue Press |location=Westerville, Ohio |url=https://archive.org/details/evolutionofprohi00cheruoft}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|93}}Presbyterian preacher [[Charles Grandison Finney]], taught abstinence from [[ardent spirit]]s. In the Rochester, New York revival of 1831, individuals were required to sign a temperance pledge in order to receive salvation. Finney believed and taught that the body represented the "temple of God" and anything that would harm the "temple" including alcohol, must be avoided.&lt;ref name="clean" /&gt;{{rp|24}} By 1833, several thousand groups similar to the ATS were formed in most states. In some of the large communities, temperance almanacs were released which gave information about planting and harvesting as well as current information about the temperance issues.&lt;ref name="clean" /&gt;{{rp|39}}

Temperance societies were being organized in England about the same time, many inspired by a Belfast professor of theology, and Presbyterian Church of Ireland Minister [[John Edgar(Rev.)|John Edgar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edgarfamily.angelfire.com/ministers.htm|title=Edgar Ministers in the Presbyterian Church in Ireland|accessdate=June 11, 2012|author=John Edgar|author2=Samuel Edgar |author3=David M.

He also formed the [[Ulster Temperance Movement]] with other Presbyterian clergy, initially enduring ridicule from members of his community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Evangelical Protestantism in Ulster society 1740–1890|first=David|last=Hempton|location=Myrtle Hill|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Out of the religious revival and reform appeared [[Mormonism]] and [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventism]], new Christian denominations that established criteria for healthy living as a part of their religious teachings, namely temperance.&lt;ref name="clean" /&gt;{{rp|23}}

====Latter Day Saints====
The Word of Wisdom is a health code followed by the members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and other Latter Day Saint denominations which advises how to maintain good health: what one should do and what one should abstain from. One of the most prominent items in the Word of Wisdom is the complete abstinence from alcohol.&lt;ref name="ludlow"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Joseph Lynn Lyon|authorlink1=Word of Wisdom|editor1-last=Ludlow|editor1-first=Daniel H.|title=Encyclopedia of Mormonism|date=1992|publisher=Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=978-0028796055|pages=1584–1585|edition=Vol. 4|url=http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/digital/collection/EoM/id/4352|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Word of Wisdom was written, the Latter Day Saints were residing in Kirtland, Ohio and the Kirtland Temperance Society was organized on October 6, 1830 with 239 members.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shupe|first1=Paul|title=Indulging in Temperance: Prohibition and Political Activism in the RLDS Church|journal=Journal of Mormon History|date=1983|volume=10|pages=21–33|url=https://mormonhistoryassociation.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Journal-of-Mormon-History-Vol.-10-1983.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some scholars, the Word of Wisdom was influenced by the temperance movement. In June 1830, the ''Millenial Harbinger'' quoted from a book "The Simplicity of Health" which strongly condemned the use of alcohol, tobacco, and the untempered consumption of meat, similar to the provisions in the Word of Wisdom revealed three years later. This gave publicity to the movement and Temperance Societies began to form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Alexander |first1=Thomas G. |title=The Word of Wisdom: From Principle to Requirement |journal=Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought |date=Autumn 1981 |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=85–86 |url=https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/issues/V14N03.pdf |accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eco"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arrington|first1=Leonard J.|title=An Economic Interpretation of the "Word of Wisdom"|journal=BYU Studies|pages=37–49|date=Winter 1959|volume=1|issue=1|url=https://byustudies.byu.edu/content/economic-interpretation-word-wisdom|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 1, 1833, a few weeks before the Word of Wisdom came forth, all distilleries in the Kirtland area were shut down.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; During the early history of the Word of Wisdom, temperance and other items in the health code were seen more as wise recommendations than commandments.&lt;ref name="decade"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hoskisson |first1=Paul Y. |title=The Word of Wisdom in its First Decade |journal=Journal of Mormon History |date=Winter 2012 |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=131–200 |jstor=23292682}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|132}} 

Although he advocated for temperance, Joseph Smith did not preach complete abstinence from alcohol. According to Paul H. Peterson and Ronald W.

=== Teetotalism (1830s) ===
{{See also|Blue ribbon badge}}
As a response to rising social problems in urbanized areas, a stricter form of temperance emerged called [[teetotalism]], which promoted the complete abstinence from alcoholic beverages, this time including wine and beer, not just ardent spirits.&lt;ref name="clean" /&gt;{{rp|39}}&lt;ref name="snodgrass"&gt;{{Citation|last1=Snodgrass|first1=Mary Ellen|encyclopedia=The Civil War Era and Reconstruction: An Encyclopedia of Social, Political, Cultural and Economic History|date=2015|publisher=[[Routledge]]|title=Temperance Movement|isbn=978-1-317-45791-6|pages=600–3|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cWysBwAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|602}} The name "teetotaler" came from the capital "T"s that were written next to the names of people who pledged complete abstinence from alcohol.&lt;ref name="woodworth" /&gt; People were instructed to only drink pure water and the teetotalists were known as the "pure-water army".&lt;ref name="clean" /&gt;{{rp|40}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Pilgrims-The Irish-The Sandwich Islanders |journal=The Sailor's Magazine and Naval Journal |date=1843 |volume=15 |pages=270–271 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=m9sZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA271&amp;lpg=RA1-PA271&amp;dq=pure+water+army+teetotalism#v=onepage&amp;q=pure%20water%20army%20teetotalism&amp;f=false |accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, the [[American Temperance Union]] advocated the total abstinence of distilled and fermented liquors.

==== The Washingtonian movement ====
In 1840, a group of artisans in Baltimore, Maryland created their own temperance society that could appeal to hard-drinking men like themselves. Calling themselves the [[Washingtonians]], they pledged complete abstinence, attempting to persuade others through their own experience with alcohol rather than relying on preaching and religious lectures. They argued that sympathy was an overlooked method for helping people with alcohol addictions, citing coercion as an ineffective method. For that reason, they did not support prohibitive legislation of alcohol.&lt;ref name="chavigny" /&gt;{{rp|110}} They were suspicious of the divisiveness of denominational religion and did not use religion in their discussions, emphasizing personal abstinence. They never set up national organizations, believing that concentration of power and distance from citizens causes corruption. Meetings were public and they encouraged equal participation, appealing to both men and women and northerners and southerners.&lt;ref name="chavigny" /&gt;{{rp|111}} Unlike early temperance reformers, the Washingtonians did not believe that intemperance destroyed a drinker's morality.&lt;ref name="chavigny" /&gt;{{rp|112}} They worked on the platform that abstinence communities could be created through sympathizing with drunkards rather than ostracizing them through the belief that they are sinners or diseased.&lt;ref name="chavigny" /&gt;{{rp|113}} 

On February 22, 1842 in [[Springfield, Illinois]], while a member of the [[Illinois Legislature]], [[Abraham Lincoln]] gave an address to the Springfield Washington Temperance Society on the 110th anniversary of the birth of [[George Washington]]. In the speech, Lincoln criticized early methods of the temperance movement as overly forceful and advocated reason as the solution to the problem of intemperance, praising the current temperance movement methods of the Washingtonian movement.&lt;ref name="lincoln"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Morel |first1=Lucas E. |title=Lincoln among the Reformers: Tempering the Temperance Movement |journal=Journal of the Abraham Lincoln Association |date=1999 |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=1–34 |url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jala/2629860.0020.103/--lincoln-among-the-reformers-tempering-the-temperance?rgn=main;view=fulltext |accessdate=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1845, the Washingtonian movement was no longer as prominent for three reasons. Firstly, the evangelist reformers attacked them for refusing to admit alcoholism was a sin. Secondly, the movement was criticized as unsuccessful due to the number of men who would go back to drinking. Finally, the movement was internally divided by differing views on prohibition legislation.&lt;ref name="chavigny" /&gt;{{rp|113}} Temperance fraternal societies such as the Sons of Temperance and the Good Samaritans took the place of the Washingtonian movement with largely similar views relating to helping alcoholics by way of sympathy and philanthropy. They, however, differed from the Washingtonians through their closed rather than public meetings, fines, and membership qualifications, believing their methods would be more effective in curbing men's alcohol addictions.&lt;ref name="chavigny" /&gt;{{rp|113}} After the 1850s, the temperance movement was characterized more by prevention by means of prohibitions laws, than remedial efforts to facilitate the recovery of alcoholics.&lt;ref name="chavigny" /&gt;{{rp|113}}

==== Gospel temperance ====
By the mid-1850s, the United States was divided from differing views of slavery and prohibition laws and economic depression. This influenced the Third Great Awakening in the United States. The prayer meeting largely characterized this religious revival. Prayer meetings were devotional meetings run by laypeople rather than clergy and consisted of prayed and testimony by attendees. The meetings were held frequently and pledges of temperance were confessed. Prayer meetings and pledges characterized the post-Civil war "gospel" temperance movement. This movement was similar to early temperance movements in that drunkenness was seen as a sin; however, public testimony was used to convert others and convince them to sign the pledge.&lt;ref name="chavigny" /&gt;{{rp|114}} New and revitalized organizations emerged including the [[Young Men's Christian Association]] (YMCA) and the early [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] (WCTU). The movement relied on the reformed individuals using local evangelical resources to create institutions to reform drunk men. Reformed men in Massachusetts and Maine formed "ribbon" clubs to support men who were interested in stopping drinking. Ribbon reformers traveled throughout the Midwest forming clubs and sharing their experiences with others. Gospel rescue missions or inebriate homes were created that allowed homeless drunkards a safe place to reform and learn to practice total abstinence while receiving food and shelter.&lt;ref name="chavigny" /&gt;{{rp|115}} These movements emphasized sympathy over coercion, yet unlike the Washingtonian movements, emphasized helplessness as well with relief from their addictions as a result from seeking the grace of God.&lt;ref name="chavigny" /&gt;{{rp|116}}

As an expression of [[moralism]],&lt;ref name="Robins2004"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Robins |first1=R. G. |title=A. J. Tomlinson: Plainfolk Modernist |date=2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199883172 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; the membership of the temperance movement overlapped with that of the [[Abolitionism|abolitionist movement]] and [[Women's suffrage|women's suffrage movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Finkelman |first1=Paul |title=Encyclopedia of African American History, 1619-1895 |date=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |isbn=9780195167771 |pages=228 |language=English|quote=These and other African American temperance activists--including James W.C. Pennington, Robert Purvis, William Watkins, William Whipper, Samule Ringgold Ward, Sarah Parker Remond, Francese E. Watkins Harper, William Wells Brown, and Frederick Douglass--increasingly linked temperance to a larger battle against slavery, discrimination, and racism. In churches, coventions, and newspapers, these reformers promoted an absolute and immediate rejection of both alcohol and slavery. The connection between temperance and antislavery views remained strong throughout the 1840s and 1850s. The white abolitionists Arthur Tappan and Gerrit Smith helped lead the American Temperance Union, formed in 1833. Frederick Douglass, who took the teetotaler pledge while in Scotland in 1845, claimed, "I am a temperance man because I am an anti-slavery man." Activists argued that alcohol aided slavery by keeping enslaved men and women addled and by sapping the strength of free black communities.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VenturelliFleckenstein2017"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Venturelli |first1=Peter J. |last2=Fleckenstein |first2=Annette E. |title=Drugs and Society |date=2017 |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning |isbn=9781284110876 |pages=252 |language=English|quote=Because the temperance movement was closely tied to the abolitionist movement as well as to the African American church, African Americans were preeminent promoters of temperance.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Abolition, Women's Rights, and Temperance Movements |url=https://www.nps.gov/wori/learn/historyculture/abolition-womens-rights-and-temperance-movements.htm |publisher=[[U.S. Department of the Interior]]|year=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Victorian period, the temperance movement became more political, advocating the legal prohibition of all alcohol, rather than only calling for moderation. Proponents of temperance, teetotalism and prohibition came to be known as the "drys".&lt;ref name="History.com" /&gt;

There was still a focus on the working class, but also their children. The [[Band of Hope]] was founded in 1847 in [[Leeds]], UK, by the Reverend [[Jabez Tunnicliff]]. It aimed to save working class children from the drinking parents by teaching them the importance and principles of sobriety and teetotalism. In 1855, a national organisation was formed amidst an explosion of Band of Hope work. Meetings were held in churches throughout the UK and included Christian teaching. The group campaigned politically for the curtailment of the influence of pubs and brewers. The organization became quite radical, organizing rallies, demonstrations and marches to influence as many people as possible to sign the pledge of allegiance to the society and to resolve to abstain "from all liquors of an intoxicating quality, whether ale, porter, wine or spirits, except as medicine."&lt;ref&gt;Nick Brownlee (2002) ''This is Alcohol'': 99&lt;/ref&gt;

In this period there was local success at restricting or banning the sale of alcohol in many parts of the United States. In 1838, [[Massachusetts]] banned certain sales of spirits. The law was repealed two years later, but it set a precedent.&lt;ref name="History.com" /&gt; In 1845, [[Michigan]] allowed its municipalities to decide whether they were going to prohibit.&lt;ref name="Hour Detroit"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lyons|first1=Mickey|title=Dry Times: Looking Back 100 Years After Prohibition|url=http://www.hourdetroit.com/Hour-Detroit/May-2018/Dry-Times-Looking-Back-100-Years-After-Prohibition/|website=Hour Detroit|accessdate=May 15, 2018|date=April 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1846, [[Maine law|a law was passed in Maine]] which was a full-fledged prohibition, and this was followed by bans in several other states in the next two decades.&lt;ref name="History.com" /&gt;

The movement became more effective, with alcohol consumption in the US being decreased by half between 1830 and 1840. During this time, prohibition laws came into effect in twelve US states, such as [[Maine]]. [[Maine Law]] was passed in 1851 by the efforts of [[Neal Dow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Blocker Jr. |first1=Jack S. |title=American Temperance Movements: Cycles of Reform |date=1989 |publisher=Twayne Publishers |location=Boston |isbn=978-0805797275 |pages=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organized opposition caused five of these states to eliminate or weaken the laws.&lt;ref name="Misiroglu" /&gt;

=== Transition to a mass movement (1860s–1900s) ===
[[File:Temperance Fountain from north.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A [[temperance fountain]] in [[Tompkins Square Park]], New York City]]
The Temperance movement was a significant mass movement at this time and encouraged a general abstinence from the consumption of alcohol. A general movement to build alternatives to replace the functions of public bars existed, so the [[Independent Order of Rechabites]] was formed in England, with a branch later opening in America as a [[friendly society]] that did not hold meetings in public bars. There was also a movement to introduce [[temperance fountains]] across the United States—to provide people with reliably safe drinking water rather than saloon alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WCTU Drinking Fountains&amp;nbsp;— Then and Now|url=http://www.wctu.org/fountains.html|work=Woman's Christian Temperance Union|publisher=Woman's Christian Temperance Union|accessdate=June 9, 2012|author=Staff|year=1996–2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014112806/http://wctu.org/fountains.html|archivedate=October 14, 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Prohibition Party]] led by [[John Russell (prohibitionist)|John Russell]] gradually became more popular, gaining more votes, as they felt that the existing Democrat and Republican parties did not do enough for the temperance cause.&lt;ref name="snodgrass" /&gt;{{rp|602}} The party was associated with the [[Independent Order of Good Templars]], which entertained a [[universalist]] orientation, being more open to blacks and repentant alcoholics than most other organizations.&lt;ref name="fahey" /&gt;{{rp|5–6, 152}}

Reflecting the [[Christian views on alcohol#Methodism|teaching on alcohol]] of their founder [[John Wesley]],&lt;ref name="Williams1984"/&gt; [[Methodist Church]]es were aligned with the temperance movement.&lt;ref name="Whitaker2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Whitaker|first=Sigur E.|title=James Allison: A Biography of the Engine Manufacturer and Indianapolis 500 Cofounder|date=31 March 2011|publisher=McFarland|language=English|isbn=9780786486397|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methodists believed that despite the supposed economic benefits of liquor traffic because of job creation and taxes, the harm that it causes society through its contribution to murder, gambling, prostitution, crime, and political corruption outweiged the economic benefits.&lt;ref name="timberlake"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Timberlake |first1=James H. |title=Prohibition and the Progressive Movement 1900-1920 |date=1963 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7}} In Great Britain, both [[Wesleyan Methodist Church (Great Britain)|Wesleyan Methodists]] and [[Primitive Methodist]]s championed the cause of temperance;&lt;ref name="Wheeler1882"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wheeler|first=Henry|title=Methodism and the Temperance Reformation|year=1882|publisher=Walden and Stowe|language=English|page=278}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Methodist Board of Temperance, Prohibition, and Public Morals]] was later established in the United States to further the movement.&lt;ref name="Fowler2018"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fowler|first=Robert Booth|title=Religion and Politics in America: Faith, Culture, and Strategic Choices|date=4 April 2018|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|language=English |isbn=9780429972799|page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1864, the [[Salvation Army]], another denomination in the Wesleyan-Arminian tradition, was founded in London with a heavy emphasis on both abstinence from alcohol and ministering to the working class, which led publicans to fund a [[Skeleton Army]] to disrupt their meetings.

In 1870, physicians created the American Association of the Cure of Inebrity (AACI) to treat alcohol addiction. The two goals of the organization were to convince the skeptical medical community of the existence and seriousness of the disease of alcoholism and to prove the efficacy of asylum treatments of alcoholics.&lt;ref name="chavigny" /&gt;{{rp|116}} They argued for more genetic causes of alcohol addictions. Treatment often included restraint of the patient while they reformed both physically and morally.&lt;ref name="chavigny" /&gt;{{rp|117}}

The [[Anti-Saloon League]] was an organization that began in 1893 in Ohio. Reacting to urban growth, it was driven by [[Evangelicalism|evangelical Protestantism]].&lt;ref name="History.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hour Detroit" /&gt; Furthermore, the League was strongly supported by the WCTU: in some US states alcoholism had become epidemic and domestic violence rates were high.

Actions of the temperance movement were organizing sobriety lectures and setting up reform clubs for men and children. Some proponents also opened special temperance hotels and lunch wagons, and lobbied for banning liquor during prominent events.

A favorite goal of the British Temperance movement was sharply to reduce heavy drinking by closing as many pubs as possible. Advocates were Protestant nonconformists who played a major role in the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. The Liberal Party adopted temperance platforms focused on local option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=David|first=M.

However, the People's Tax of 1910 included a stiff tax on pubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Colin|last=Cross|title=The Liberals in Power, 1905–1914|year=1963|pp=69–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Paul|last=Jennings|title=Liquor Licensing and the Local Historian: The Victorian Public House|journal=Local Historian|issue=41|year=2011|pp=121–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement gained further traction during the First World War, with [[Woodrow Wilson|President Wilson]] issuing sharp restrictions on the sale of alcohol in many combatant countries. This was done to preserve grain for food production.&lt;ref name="History.com" /&gt; During this time, prohibitionists used anti-German sentiment related to the war to rally against alcohol sales, since many brewers were of German-American descent.&lt;ref name="Hour Detroit" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|Temperance movement focused on Catholics from Irish and German descent for their alleged preference for alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Snodgrass|first1=Mary Ellen|encyclopedia=The Civil War Era and Reconstruction: An Encyclopedia of Social, Political, Cultural and Economic History|date=2015|publisher=[[Routledge]]|title=Catholicism|isbn=978-1-317-45791-6|page=130|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cWysBwAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to alcohol researcher Johan Edman, the first country to issue an alcohol prohibition was Russia, as part of war mobilization policies.&lt;ref name="edman" /&gt;{{rp|27}} This followed after Russia had made significant losses in the [[Russo-Japanese_War|war against the sober Japanese in 1905]].&lt;ref name="edman" /&gt;{{rp|35}} In the UK, the Liberal government passed the [[Defence of the Realm Act 1914]] when pub hours were licensed, beer was watered down and was subject to a penny a pint extra tax,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Nick|last=Brownlee|year=2002|title=This is Alcohol|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1916 a State Management Scheme meant that breweries and pubs in certain areas of Britain were nationalized, especially in places where armaments were made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duncan|first1=Robert|title=Lord D'Abernon's "Model Farm": The Central Control Board's Carlisle Experiment|journal=Social History of Alcohol &amp; Drugs: An Interdisciplinary Journal|date=2010|volume=24|issue=2|pages=119–140|url=http://content.ebscohost.com/ContentServer.asp?EbscoContent=dGJyMNXb4kSep7Q4y9f3OLCmr1Cep7VSsau4SK6WxWXS&amp;ContentCustomer=dGJyMPGuskyurK5IuePfgeyx43zx1%2BqE&amp;T=P&amp;P=AN&amp;S=R&amp;D=30h&amp;K=56537243}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1913, the ASL began its efforts for national prohibition.&lt;ref name="deliver" /&gt;{{rp|118}} [[Wayne Wheeler]], a member of the Anti-Saloon League was integral in the prohibition movement in the United States. He used hard political persuasion called "Wheelerism" in the 1920s of legislative bodies. Rather than ask directly for a vote, which Wheeler viewed as weak, Wheeler would cover the desks of legislators in telegrams. He was also accomplished in rallying supporters; the Cincinnati ''Enquirer'' called Wheeler "the strongest political force of his day".&lt;ref name="deliver" /&gt;{{rp|113-114}} His efforts specifically influenced the passing of the eighteenth-amendment.&lt;ref name="deliver" /&gt;{{rp|114}} And in 1920, the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment]] was successfully passed in the United States, introducing [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]] of the manufacture, sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages. The amendment, also called "the noble experiment", was preceded by the [[National Prohibition Act]], which stipulated how the federal government should enforce the amendment.&lt;ref name="History.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prohibition|url=https://www.history.com/topics/prohibition|website=History.com|publisher=[[A+E Networks]]|accessdate=May 13, 2018|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

National prohibition was proposed several times in [[The Temperance movement in New Zealand|New Zealand]] as well, and nearly successful.{{refn|group=note|Referendums were held in 1911 (55.8% for prohibition, 60% needed), 1914, 49% in favour (50% needed), 1919 49% in favour (50% needed).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Paul |last=Christoffel |title=Prohibition and the Myth of 1919|journal=The Zealand Journal of History|volume=42|issue=2|date=October 2008|pp=156–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prohibition: The Compact|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/prohibition/6|website=The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|publisher=Manatū Taonga Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=June 11, 2012|author=A.

[[Six o'clock swill|restrictive early closing times for bars]] during and immediately after the First World War.&lt;ref name="WPhillips"&gt;The first state to introduce early closing was [[South Australia]] in 1915 as a war [[austerity]] measure. Six o'clock closing was adopted in [[New South Wales]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Tasmania]] in 1916. New Zealand introduced it in 1917.  [[Western Australia]] adopted a 9pm closing time, but [[Queensland]] retained the old closing times until it introduced eight o'clock closing in 1923. {{cite journal |last1= Phillips|first1= Walter|year= 1980|title= 'Six o'clock swill':  the introduction of early closing of hotel bars in Australia |journal= Historical Studies|volume= 19|issue= 75|pages= 250–266|doi= 10.1080/10314618008595637}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Prohibition in Canada|Canada]], in 1916 the [[Ontario Temperance Act]] was passed, prohibiting the sales of alcoholic beverages with more than 2.5% alcohol.&lt;ref name="TVO"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bradburn|first1=Jamie|title=Booze, Bullying, and Moral Panic: The Temperance Election of 1926|url=https://tvo.org/article/current-affairs/-booze-bullying-and-moral-panic-the-temperance-election-of-1926|website=[[TVOntario]]|publisher=[[Ontario Educational Communications Authority]]|accessdate=18 May 2018|date=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s imports of alcohol were cut off by provincial [[referendum]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Temperance Movement in Canada|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/temperance-movement/|website=The Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=Historica Canada|accessdate=May 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Norway introduced partial prohibition in 1917, which became full prohibition through a [[Norwegian prohibition referendum, 1919|referendum in 1919]], although this was [[Norwegian continued prohibition referendum, 1926|overturned in 1926]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johansen|first1=Per Ole|title=The Norwegian Alcohol Prohibition; A Failure|journal=Journal of Scandinavian Studies in Criminology and Crime Prevention|date=2013|volume=14|pages=46–63|doi=10.1080/14043858.2013.771909}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Finland introduced prohibition in 1919, but repealed it in 1932 after an upsurge in violent crime associated with criminal opportunism and the illegal liquor trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wuorinen|first1=John H.|title=Finland's Prohibition Experiment|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|date=1932|volume=163|pages=216–226|jstor=1017701}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iceland introduced prohibition in 1915, but liberalized consumption of spirits in 1933, although beer was still illegal until 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Billock|first1=Jennifer|title=Illegal in Iceland: Quirky Bans From the Land of Fire and Ice|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/illegal-in-iceland-180957521/|website=Smithsonian.com|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=May 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why Iceland banned beer|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-31622038|accessdate=May 16, 2018|agency=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=March 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1910s, half of the countries in the world had introduced some form of alcohol control in their laws or policies.&lt;ref name="edman" /&gt;{{rp|28}}

=== Decline (1920s–'60s) ===
[[File:Sankt-Peterburg oldfoto 13616.jpg|thumb|In [[Pushkin, Saint Petersburg]], a procession to promote temperance in front of the [[Tsarskoye Selo Railway]] station (1912)]]
The temperance movement started to wane in the 1930s, with prohibition being criticised as creating unhealthy drinking habits,&lt;ref name="WPhillips" /&gt; encouraging criminals and discouraging economic activity. Prohibition would not last long: the legislative tide largely moved away from prohibition when the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-first Amendment to the Constitution]] was ratified on December 5, 1933, repealing nationwide prohibition. The gradual relaxation of licensing laws went on throughout the 20th century, with Mississippi being the last state to end prohibition in 1966.&lt;ref name="History.com" /&gt; In Australia, early hotel closing times were reverted in the 1950s and 1960s.{{refn|group=note|The last Australian state to do so was South Australia in 1967.}}

Initially, prohibition had some positive effects in some states, with Ford reporting that absenteeism in his companies had decreased by half.&lt;ref name="Hour Detroit" /&gt; Alcohol consumption decreased dramatically. Also, statistical analysis has shown that the temperance movement during this time had a positive, though moderate, effect on later adult educational outcomes through providing a healthy [[pre-natal]] environment.&lt;ref name="francis" /&gt;{{rp|162,165}}&lt;ref name=snodgrass /&gt;{{rp|157}} However, prohibition had negative effects on the American economy, with thousands of jobs being lost, the catering and entertainment industries losing huge profits. The US and other countries with prohibition saw their tax revenues decrease dramatically, with some estimating this at a loss of 11 billion dollars for the US.&lt;ref name="History.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TVO" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|Taxes on alcohol was the major source of government funding in a time when the income tax had not yet been approved.&lt;ref name="Drager" /&gt;}} Furthermore, enforcement of the alcohol ban was an expensive undertaking for the government. Because the Eighteenth Amendment did not prohibit consumption, but only manufacture, distribution and sale, illegal consumption became commonplace. Illegal production of alcohol rose, and a thousand people per year died of alcohol that was illegally produced with little quality control. Bootlegging was a profitable activity for the mafia, and crime increased rather than decreased as expected and advocated by proponents.&lt;ref name="History.com" /&gt;

The temperance movement itself was in decline as well: fundamentalist and [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] groups had become dominant in the movement, which led moderate members to leave the movement.&lt;ref name="History.com" /&gt;

During this time, in former colonies (such as [[Gujarat]] in India, [[The Temperance movement in Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka]] and Egypt), the temperance movement was associated with [[anti-colonialism]] or religious revival.&lt;ref name="encyclo" /&gt;{{rp|310}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rogers|first1=John D.|title=Cultural nationalism and social reform: The 1904 Temperance Movement in Sri Lanka|journal=The Indian Economic and Social History Review|date=1989|volume=26|issue=3|page=336|doi=10.1177/001946468902600303}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Foda|first1=Omar|title=Anna and Ahmad|journal=Social Sciences and Missions|date=January 1, 2015|volume=28|issue=1–2|page=passim|nopp=yes|doi=10.1163/18748945-02801015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1960s–present ===
The temperance movement still exists in many parts of the world, although it is generally less politically influential than it was in the early 20th century. Its efforts today include disseminating research regarding [[alcohol and health]], in addition to its effects on society and the family unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fitzpatrick |first1=Michael |title=The Tyranny of Health: Doctors and the Regulation of Lifestyle |date=2002 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781134563463 |pages=47 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent temperance organizations active today include the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union|World Woman's Christian Temperance Union]], [[International Blue Cross]], [[White Ribbon Association]], and [[International Organisation of Good Templars]].&lt;ref name="Fischer-TinéTschurenev2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fischer-Tiné|first1=Harald|last2=Tschurenev|first2=Jana|title=A History of Alcohol and Drugs in Modern South Asia|date=3 January 2014|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|language=English|isbn=9781317916819|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection]] and [[Salvation Army]], for example, are Christian Churches that continue to require that their members refrain from drinking alcohol as well as smoking, taking illegal drugs, and gambling.&lt;ref name="AWMC2014"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Discipline of the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection (Original Allegheny Conference)|year=2014|publisher=[[Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection]]|location=[[Salem, Ohio|Salem]]|language=English|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.salvationarmy.org/heritage.nsf/0/fea4acf97c61102c80256a2200443120?OpenDocument&amp;Highlight=0,doctrines |title=Articles Of War For Salvation Army Soldiers |publisher=.salvationarmy.org |accessdate=April 11, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610164243/http://www1.salvationarmy.org/heritage.nsf/0/fea4acf97c61102c80256a2200443120?OpenDocument&amp;Highlight=0,doctrines |archivedate=June 10, 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In youth culture in the 1990s, temperance was an important part of the [[straight edge]] scene, which also stressed [[abstinence from drugs|abstinence from other drugs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haenfler|first1=Ross|title=Straight Edge: Hardcore Punk, Clean Living Youth, and Social Change|date=2006|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=Piscataway, NJ|isbn=978-0-8135-3851-8|page=35|url=https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/byu/reader.action?docID=435053&amp;query=|accessdate=May 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beliefs, principles and culture ==
Temperance proponents saw the alcohol problem as the most crucial problem of Western civilization.&lt;ref name="edman" /&gt;{{rp|21}} Alcoholism was seen to cause poverty,&lt;ref name="Drager" /&gt; and all types of social problems: alcohol was the enemy of everything good that modernity and science had to offer.&lt;ref name="edman"&gt;{{Citation|last1=Edman|first1=Johan|title=Temperance and Modernity: Alcohol Consumption as a Collective Problem, 1885–1913|journal=[[Journal of Social History]]|date=September 2015|volume=49|issue=1|pages=20–52|doi=10.1093/jsh/shv029|url=https://academic.oup.com/jsh/article/49/1/20/948316}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|23}} They believed that abstinence would help decrease crime, make families stronger, and improve society as a whole.&lt;ref name="History.com" /&gt; Although the temperance movement was non-denominational in principle, the movement consisted mostly of church-goers.&lt;ref name="Benowitz" /&gt; Temperance advocates tended to use scientific arguments to back up their views, although at the core the temperance philosophy was moral-religious in nature.&lt;ref name="edman" /&gt;{{rp|38}} The alcohol problem was connected with a sense of purpose and modernity of the western nation, and was largely international in nature, in keeping with the international optimism typical for the period preceding the First World War.&lt;ref name="edman" /&gt;{{rp|41}}

Historical analysis of conference documents helps create an image of what the temperance movement stood for. The movement believed that alcohol abuse was a threat to scientific progress, as it was believed citizens had to be strong and sober to be ready for the modern age. Progressive themes and causes such as abolition, natural self-determination, worker's rights, and the importance of women in rearing children to be good citizens were key themes of this citizenship ideology.&lt;ref name="edman" /&gt;{{rp|25–26}} The movement put itself at service of the state, but was also critical of it. In that sense, it was a radical movement with liberal and socialist aspects, although in some parts of the world, notably the US, allied with conservatism.&lt;ref name="edman" /&gt;{{rp|40–41}} Alcohol was often associated with oppression: not only oppression in the West, but also in colonies.&lt;ref name="edman" /&gt;{{rp|35}} Temperance advocates saw alcohol as a product that "... enables a few to become rich while it impoverishes the very many". Temperance advocates worked closely with the labor movement, as well as the women suffrage movement, partly because there was mutual support and benefit, and the causes were seen as connected.&lt;ref name="edman" /&gt;{{rp|41}}

=== Prevention, treatment and restriction ===
Temperance proponents used a variety of means to prevent and treat alcohol abuse and restrict its consumption.&lt;ref name="edman" /&gt;{{rp|24}} At the end of the nineteenth century, medically-oriented treatment of alcohol abuse became more common.&lt;ref name="edman" /&gt;{{rp|26}} In a trend that was preceded by Rush's writings, alcoholism came to be seen as an illness which could be medically treated. Scientists who were temperance proponents attempted to find the underlying causes of alcohol abuse. At the same time, criticism rose toward use of alcohol in medical care.&lt;ref name="edman" /&gt;{{rp|39–40}} The notion of alcohol abuse as a disease would only become widely accepted much later, however, until after the Second World War.&lt;ref name="edman" /&gt;{{rp|38–39}}

Nevertheless, restriction of consumption was most emphasized in the movement, though ideas on how to accomplish this were varied and conflicting.&lt;ref name="edman" /&gt;{{rp|26}} Apart from the prohibition by law, there were also ideas to establish [[state monopoly]] on all alcohol sales,&lt;ref name="edman" /&gt;{{rp|27}} or through law reform remove profit from the alcohol industry.&lt;ref name="edman" /&gt;{{rp|28}}

During the 1900s decade, the ideal of strong citizens was further developed into the [[hygienism]] ideology.&lt;ref name="edman" /&gt;{{rp|30}} Through the influence of [[science of heredity|scientific theories on heredity]], temperance proponents came to believe that alcohol problems were not just a personal concern, but would cause later generations of people to "degenerate" as well.&lt;ref name="edman" /&gt;{{rp|32}} Public hygiene and improving the population through personal lifestyle were therefore promoted.&lt;ref name="edman" /&gt;{{rp|30–31}} A variety of [[temperance halls]] and [[coffee palace]]s were established as replacements for bars. Numerous periodicals devoted to temperance were published{{refn|group=note|For example in Sydney, the [[Australian Home Companion and Band of Hope Journal]] was published between 1856 and 1861.}} and [[temperance theatre]], which had started in the 1820s, became an important part of the American cultural landscape at this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frick|first1=John W.|title=Theatre, Culture and Temperance Reform in Nineteenth-Century America|date=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=978-0-521-81778-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The temperance movement generated its own popular culture. Popular songwriters such as [[Susan McFarland Parkhurst]], [[George Frederick Root]], [[Henry Clay Work]] and [[Stephen C. Foster]] composed a number of these songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Paul D. |last=Sanders |title=The Temperance Songs of Stephen C. Foster |journal=American Music |volume=34 |number=3 |year=2016 |pages=279–300 |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/}}&lt;/ref&gt; At temperance inns puppet plays, minstrel acts, parades and other shows were held.&lt;ref name="snodgrass" /&gt;{{rp|602}}

=== Role of women ===
Much of the temperance movement was based on organized religion, which saw women as responsible for edifying their children to be abstaining citizens.&lt;ref name="Benowitz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="edman" /&gt;{{rp|23}} Nevertheless, temperance was tied in with both religious renewal and progressive politics, particularly female suffrage&lt;ref name="History.com" /&gt; Furthermore, temperance activists were able to promote suffrage more effectively than [[Suffragists|suffrage activists]] themselves, because of their wide-ranging experience as activists, and because they argued for a concrete aim of safety at home, rather than an abstract aim of justice as the suffragists did.&lt;ref name="osborne" /&gt;{{rp|5–6}}

By 1831, there were over 24 women's organizations dedicated to the temperance movement. Women were specifically drawn to the temperance movement, because it represented a fight to end a practice that greatly affected women's quality of life. Temperance was seen as a feminine, religious and moral duty, and when achieved, it was seen as a way to gain familial and domestic security as well as salvation in a religious sense.&lt;ref name="clean" /&gt;{{rp|47}} Indeed, scholar Ruth Bordin stated that the temperance movement was "the foremost example of American feminism."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://daily.jstor.org/feminist-history-prohibition/|title=The Feminist History of Prohibition|date=2016-01-06|work=JSTOR Daily|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent women such as [[Amelia Bloomer]], [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], and [[Susan B. Anthony]] were active in temperance and abolitionist movements in the 1840s.&lt;ref name="clean" /&gt;{{rp|47}}

A myriad of factors contributed to women's interest in the temperance movement. One of the initial contributions was the frequency in which women were victims of alcohol abuse. In a Chicago meeting of the National American Woman Suffrage Association, Susan B. Anthony stated that women suffer the most from drunkenness.

Because of this, women believed it was their duty to protect their families from the danger of alcohol and to convert their family members to the ideas of abstinence. This new found calling to temperance, however, did not change the widely held viewpoint at the time that women were only responsible for matters regarding their homes.&lt;ref name="bordin" /&gt;{{rp|8}} Consequently, women had what Ruth Bordin referred to as the "maternal struggle" which was the internal contradiction women felt with the new power to make change they had discovered, but in still believing in their nurturing and domestic roles and they did not yet understand how to use their power.&lt;ref name="bordin" /&gt;{{rp|8-9}} June Sochen called women who joined movements such as women's temperance organizations "pragmatic feminists", because they took action to solve their grievances, but were not interested in altering traditional sex roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sochen |first1=June |title=Movers and Shakers: American Women Thinkers and Activists 1900-1970 |date=1973 |publisher=Quadrangle/New York Times Book Co. |location=New York |isbn=978-0812903607 |pages=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; The missionary organizations of many Protestant denominations gave women avenue to work from; there were already all-female missionary societies that were easily changed into women's temperance organizations.&lt;ref name="bordin" /&gt;{{rp|9-10}}

In the 1870s and 1880s, the number of women in the middle and upper classes was large enough to support women participation in the temperance movement. Higher class women did not need to work and could rely on their husbands to support their families and consequently had more leisure time to engage in organizations and associations related to the temperance movement.&lt;ref name="bordin" /&gt;{{rp|10}} The influx of Irish immigrants filled in the servant jobs left by freed African-Americans after the American Civil War, leaving upper and middle class women with even more time to participate in the community with domestic jobs being taken care of. Moreover, the birth rate had fallen, leaving women with an average of four children in 1880 as compared to seven children at the beginning of the nineteenth-century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Smith |first1=Daniel Scott |editor1-last=Hartman |editor1-first=Mary S. |editor2-last=Banner |editor2-first=Lois W. |title=Clio's Consciousness Raised: New Perspectives on the History of Women |date=1976 |publisher=Octagon Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0374937126 |page=123 |chapter=Family Limitation, Sexual Control and Domestic Feminism in Victorian America}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bordin" /&gt;{{rp|11-12}} The gathering of people in urban areas and the extra leisure time for women contributed to the mass female temperance movement.&lt;ref name="bordin" /&gt;{{rp|11-12}} 

The [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] (WCTU) grew out of a spontaneous crusade against saloons and liquor stores that began Ohio and spread throughout the Midwestern United States during the winter of 1873-1874. The crusade consisted of over 32,000 women storming into saloons and liquor stores to disrupt business and stop the sales of alcohol.&lt;ref name="miltiancy"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dannenbaum |first1=Jed |title=The Origins of Temperance Activism and Militancy among American Women |journal=Journal of Social History |date=1981 |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=235–252 |url=http://content.ebscohost.com/ContentServer.asp?EbscoContent=dGJyMMvl7ESeprA4yOvqOLCmr1Cep7VSsKi4SbOWxWXS&amp;ContentCustomer=dGJyMPGuskyurK5IuePfgeyx43zx1%2BqE&amp;T=P&amp;P=AN&amp;S=R&amp;D=aph&amp;K=5015585 |accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bordin" /&gt;{{rp|15}} The WCTU was officially organized in late November 1874 in Cleveland, Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gordon |first1=Elizabeth Putnam |title=Women Torch-Bearers: The Story of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union |date=1924 |publisher=National Woman's Christian Temperance Union Pub.

Willard was interested in suffrage and women's rights as well as temperance, believing that temperance could improve the quality of life on a family and a community level. The WCTU trained women in skills such as public speaking, leadership, and political thinking, using temperance as a springboard to achieve a higher quality of life for women on many levels. In 1881, the WCTU began to lobby for the mandation of instruction of temperance in public schools. In 1901, schools were required to instruct students on temperance ideas, but were accused of perpetuating misinformation, fear mongering, and racist stereotypes. [[Carrie Nation]] was one of the most extremist temperance movement workers and was arrested 30 times for the destruction of property at bars, saloons, and even pharmacies, believing that even alcohol used for medicine was unjustified. At the approach of the 20th century, the temperance movement became more interested in legislative reform as the pressure from the Anti-Saloon League increased. Women, having not yet achieved suffrage became less central to the movement in the early 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://prohibition.themobmuseum.org/the-history/the-road-to-prohibition/the-temperance-movement/|title=Women Led the Temperance Charge - Prohibition: An Interactive History|work=Prohibition: An Interactive History|access-date=2018-05-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other causes ===
Prohibition agendas also became popular among factory owners, who strove for more efficiency during a period of increased industrialization.&lt;ref name="History.com" /&gt; For this reason, industrial leaders such as [[Henry Ford]] and [[S.S. Kresge]] supported Prohibition.&lt;ref name="Hour Detroit" /&gt; The cause of the sober factory worker was related to the cause of women temperance leaders: concerned mothers protested against the enslavement of factory workers, as well as the temptation saloons offered to these workers.&lt;ref name="snodgrass" /&gt;{{rp|602}} Efficiency was also an important argument for the government, because they wanted their soldiers to be sober.&lt;ref name="edman" /&gt;{{rp|35}}

At the end of the nineteenth century, temperance movement opponents started to criticize the slave trade in Africa. This came during the last period of rapid colonial expansion. Slavery and alcohol trade in colonies were seen as two closely related problems, described as "the twin oppressors of the people". Again, this subject tied in with the ideas of civilization and effectiveness: temperance advocates raised the issue that the "natives" could not be properly "civilized" and put to work, if they were provided with the vice of alcohol.&lt;ref name="edman" /&gt;{{rp|35–36}}

| 1945 || [[Saunders Mac Lane]]–[[Samuel Eilenberg]] ||| Start of category theory: axioms for [[Category (mathematics)|categories]], [[functors]] and [[natural transformations]].
|-
| 1945 || [[Norman Steenrod]]–[[Samuel Eilenberg]] ||| [[Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms]] for homology and cohomology.
|-
| 1945 || [[Jean Leray]] ||| Starts [[sheaf theory]]: At this time a sheaf was a map that assigned a module or a ring to a closed subspace of a topological space. The first example was the sheaf assigning to a closed subspace its p-th cohomology group.
|-
| 1945 || [[Jean Leray]] ||| Defines [[Sheaf cohomology]] using his new concept of sheaf.
|-
| 1946 || [[Jean Leray]] ||| Invents [[spectral sequences]] as a method for iteratively approximating cohomology groups by previous approximate cohomology groups. In the limiting case it gives the sought cohomology groups.
|-
| 1948 || Cartan seminar ||| Writes up [[sheaf theory]] for the first time.
|-
| 1948 || [[A. L. Blakers]] ||| [[Crossed complex]]es (called group systems by Blakers), after a suggestion of [[Samuel Eilenberg]]: A nonabelian generalization of [[chain complex]]es of abelian groups which are equivalent to strict ω-groupoids. They form a category Crs that has many satisfactory properties such as a [[monoidal category|monoidal structure]].
|-
| 1949 || [[John Henry Whitehead]] ||| [[Crossed module]]s.
|-
| 1949 || [[André Weil]] ||| Formulates the [[Weil conjectures]] on remarkable relations between the cohomological structure of algebraic varieties over '''C''' and the diophantine structure of algebraic varieties over finite fields.
|-
| 1950 || [[Henri Cartan]] ||| In the book Sheaf theory from the Cartan seminar he defines: [[Sheaf (mathematics)#The étale space of a sheaf|Sheaf space]] (étale space), [[Support (mathematics)#Family of supports|support]] of sheaves axiomatically, [[sheaf cohomology]] with support in an axiomatic form and more.

|-
| 1950 || [[Samuel Eilenberg]]–Joe Zilber ||| [[Simplicial set]]s as a purely algebraic model of well behaved topological spaces. A simplicial set can also be seen as a presheaf on the [[Simplicial set|simplex category]]. A category is a simplicial set such that the [[Segal map]]s are isomorphisms.
|-
| 1951 || [[Henri Cartan]] ||| Modern definition of [[sheaf theory]] in which a [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] is defined using open subsets instead of closed subsets of a topological space and all the open subsets are treated at once. A sheaf on a topological space X becomes a functor resembling a function defined locally on X, and taking values in sets, abelian groups, commutative rings, modules or generally in any category C. In fact [[Alexander Grothendieck]] later made a [[dictionary between sheaves and functions]]. Another interpretation of sheaves is as continuously [[varying set]]s (a generalization of [[abstract set]]s). Its purpose is to provide a unified approach to connect local and global properties of topological spaces and to classify the obstructions for passing from local objects to global objects on a topological space by pasting together the local pieces. The C-valued sheaves on a topological space and their homomorphisms form a category.
|-
| 1952 || [[William S. Massey|William Massey]] ||| Invents [[Spectral sequence#Exact couples|exact couples]] for calculating spectral sequences.

Kan complexes are also the fibrant (and cofibrant) objects of [[model category|model categories]] of simplicial sets for which the fibrations are [[Kan fibration]]s.
|-
| 1958 || [[Alexander Grothendieck]] ||| Starts new foundation of [[algebraic geometry]] by generalizing varieties and other spaces in algebraic geometry to [[scheme (mathematics)|scheme]] which have the structure of a category with open subsets as objects and restrictions as morphisms.  form a category that is a [[Toposes#Grothendieck topoi .28topoi in geometry.29|Grothendieck topos]], and to a scheme and even a stack one may associate a Zariski topos, an étale topos, a fppf topos, a fpqc topos, a Nisnevich topos, a flat topos, ... depending on the topology imposed on the scheme. The whole of algebraic geometry was categorized with time.
|-
| 1958 || [[Roger Godement]] ||| [[Monad (category theory)|Monads]] in category theory (then called standard constructions and triples). Monads generalize classical notions from [[universal algebra]] and can in this sense be thought of as an [[theory (mathematical logic)|algebraic theory]] over a category: the theory of the category of T-algebras. An algebra for a monad subsumes and generalizes the notion of a model for an algebraic theory.

Essentially categorical logic is a lift of different logics to being internal logics of categories. Each kind of category with extra structure corresponds to a system of logic with its own inference rules. A Lawvere theory is an [[theory (mathematical logic)|algebraic theory]] as a category with finite products and possessing a "generic algebra" (a generic group). The structures described by a Lawvere theory are models of the Lawvere theory

In general a higher relabelling trick works for [[n-category|n-categories]] with one object to make general monoidal categories.

| 1964 || [[Alexander Grothendieck]]  ||| Introduced in a letter to [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] conjectural [[Motive (algebraic geometry)|motives (algebraic geometry)]] to express the idea that there is a single universal cohomology theory underlying the various cohomology theories for algebraic varieties. According to Grothendieck's philosophy there should be a universal cohomology functor attaching a [[Motive (algebraic geometry)#pure motives|pure motive]] h(X) to each smooth projective variety X. When X is not smooth or projective h(X) must be replaced by a more general [[Motive (algebraic geometry)#Mixed motives|mixed motiv]]e which has a weight filtration whose quotients are pure motivess. The [[Motive (algebraic geometry)|category of motives]] (the categorical framework for the universal cohomology theory) may be used as an abstract substitute for singular cohomology (and rational cohomology) to compare, relate and unite "motivated" properties and parallel phenomena of the various cohomology theories and to detect topological structure of algebraic varieties. The categories of pure motives and of mixed motives are abelian tensor categories and the category of pure motives is also a [[Tannakian category]]. Categories of motives are made by replacing the category of varieties by a category with the same objects but whose morphisms are [[correspondence (mathematics)#algebraic geometry|correspondence]]s, modulo a suitable equivalence relation. Different [[equivalence relation|equivalences]] give different theories. [[Rational equivalence]] gives the category of [[Chow motive]]s with [[Chow group]]s as morphisms which are in some sense universal. Every geometric cohomology theory is a functor on the category of motives. Each induced functor ρ:motives modulo numerical equivalence→graded '''Q'''-vector spaces is called a [[realization (probability)|realization]] of the category of motives, the inverse functors are called [[improvement (mathematics)|improvement]]s. Mixed motives explain phenomena in as diverse areas as: Hodge theory, algebraic K-theory, polylogarithms, regulator maps, automorphic forms, L-functions, ℓ-adic representations, trigonometric sums, homotopy of algebraic varieties, algebraic cycles, moduli spaces and thus has the potential of enriching each area and of unifying them all.

| 1973 || Chris Reedy ||| [[Reedy category|Reedy categories]]: Categories of "shapes" that can be used to do homotopy theory. A Reedy category is a category R equipped with a structure enabling the inductive construction of diagrams and natural transformations of shape R. The most important consequence of a Reedy structure on R is the existence of a model structure on the [[functor category]] M&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt; whenever M is a [[model category]]. Another advantage of the Reedy structure is that its cofibrations, fibrations and factorizations are explicit. In a Reedy category there is a notion of an injective and a surjective morphism such that any morphism can be factored uniquely as a surjection followed by an injection. Examples are the ordinal α considered as a [[poset]] and hence a category. The opposite R° of a Reedy category R is a Reedy category. The [[simplex category]] Δ and more generally for any [[simplicial set]] X its category of simplices Δ/X is a Reedy category.

A stands for associative.&lt;BR&gt;
Def: A category C such that&lt;BR&gt;
1) for all X,Y in Ob(C) the [[Hom-set]]s Hom&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;(X,Y) are finite-dimensional [[chain complex]]es of '''Z'''-graded modules&lt;BR&gt;
2) for all objects X&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; in Ob(C) there is a family of linear composition maps (the higher compositions)&lt;BR&gt;
m&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; : Hom&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;(X&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,X&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) ⊗ Hom&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;(X&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) ⊗ ... ⊗ Hom&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;(X&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;,X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) → Hom&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;(X&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) of degree n-2 (homological grading convention is used) for n≥1&lt;BR&gt;
3) m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the differential on the chain complex Hom&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;(X,Y)&lt;BR&gt;
4) m&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; satisfy the quadratic A&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;-associativity equation for all n≥0.

m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and m&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will be [[chain map]]s but the compositions m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; of higher order are not chain maps; nevertheless they are [[Massey product]]s. In particular it is a [[linear category]].

Examples are the [[Fukaya category]] Fuk(X) and [[loop space]] ΩX where X is a topological space and [[A∞-algebra|A]]&lt;sub&gt;[[A∞-algebra|∞]]&lt;/sub&gt;[[A∞-algebra|-algebras]] as A&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;-categories with one object.

When there are no higher maps (trivial homotopies) C is a [[dg-category]]. Every A&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;-category is quasiisomorphic in a functorial way to a dg-category. A quasiisomorphism is a chain map that is an isomorphism in homology.

The framework of dg-categories and dg-functors is too narrow for many problems, and it is preferable to consider the wider class of A&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;-categories and A&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;-functors. Many features of A&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;-categories and A&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;-functors come from the fact that they form a symmetric closed [[multicategory]], which is revealed in the language of [[monad (category theory)|comonads]]. From a higher-dimensional perspective A&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;-categories are weak ω-categories with all morphisms invertible. A&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;-categories can also be viewed as [[noncommutative formal dg-manifold]]s with a closed marked subscheme of objects.

| 1995 || [[André Joyal]]-[[Ieke Moerdijk]] ||| AST [[Algebraic set theory]]: Also sometimes called categorical set theory. It was developed from 1988 by André Joyal and Ieke Moerdijk, and was first presented in detail as a book in 1995 by them. AST is a framework based on category theory to study and organize [[Set theory#Axiomatic set theory|set theories]] and to construct [[model of set theories|models of set theories]]. The aim of AST is to provide a uniform [[categorical semantics]] or description of set theories of different kinds (classical or constructive, bounded, predicative or impredicative, well-founded or non-well-founded,...), the various constructions of the cumulative [[hierarchy of sets]], forcing models, sheaf models and realisability models. Instead of focusing on categories of sets AST focuses on categories of classes. The basic tool of AST is the notion of a [[category with class structure]] (a category of classes equipped with a class of small maps (the intuition being that their fibres are small in some sense), powerclasses and a universal object (a [[universe (mathematics)|universe]])) which provides an axiomatic framework in which models of set theory can be constructed. The notion of a class category permits both the definition of ZF-algebras ([[Zermelo-Fraenkel algebra]]) and related structures expressing the idea that the hierarchy of sets is an algebraic structure on the one hand and the interpretation of the first order logic of elementary set theory on the other. The subcategory of sets in a class category is an [[Topos (mathematics)#Elementary toposes .28toposes in logic.29|elementary topos]] and every elementary topos occurs as sets in a class category. The class category itself always embeds into the [[ideal completion]] of a topos. The interpretation of the logic is that in every class category the universe is a model of basic intuitionistic set theory BIST that is logically complete with respect to class category models. Therefore, class categories generalize both topos theory and intuitionistic set theory. AST founds and formalizes set theory on the ZF-algebra with operations union and successor (singleton) instead of on the membership relation. The [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZF-axioms]] are nothing but a description of the free ZF-algebra just as the Peano axioms are a description of the free monoid on one generator. In this perspective the models of set theory are algebras for a suitably presented [[theory (mathematical logic)|algebraic theory]] and many familiar set theoretic conditions (such as well foundedness) are related to familiar algebraic conditions (such as freeness). Using an auxiliary notion of small map it is possible to extend the axioms of a topos and provide a general theory for uniformly constructing models of set theory out of toposes.

| 1995 || [[Michael Makkai]] ||| SFAM [[Structuralist foundation of abstract mathematics]]. In SFAM the universe consists of higher-dimensional categories, functors are replaced by saturated [[anafunctor]]s, sets are [[abstract set]]s, the formal logic for entities is [[FOLDS]] (first-order logic with dependent sorts) in which the identity relation is not given a priori by first order axioms but derived from within a context.

| 1998 || [[Richard Thomas (mathematician)|Richard Thomas]] ||| Richard Thomas, a student of [[Simon Donaldson]], introduces [[Donaldson–Thomas invariant]]s which are systems of numerical invariants of complex oriented 3-manifolds X, analogous to [[Donaldson invariant]]s in the theory of 4-manifolds. They are certain [[weighted Euler characteristic]]s of the [[moduli space of sheaves]] on ''X'' and "count" Gieseker semistable [[coherent sheaf|coherent sheaves]] with fixed [[Chern character]] on X.

In the case when A = QCoh(X) for X a scheme the pair (Spec(A),O&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;) is naturally isomorphic to the scheme (X&lt;sup&gt;Zar&lt;/sup&gt;,O&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;) using the equivalence of categories QCoh(Spec(R))=Mod&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;. More generally abelian categories or triangulated categories or dg-categories or A&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;-categories should be regarded as categories of quasicoherent sheaves (or complexes of sheaves) on noncommutative schemes. This is a starting point in [[noncommutative algebraic geometry]]. It means that one can think of the category A itself as a space. Since A is abelian it allows to naturally do [[homological algebra]] on noncommutative schemes and hence [[sheaf cohomology]].

Luries theory of higher toposes can be interpreted as giving a good theory of sheaves taking values in ∞-categories. Roughly an ∞-topos is an ∞-category which looks like the ∞-category of all [[homotopy type]]s. In a topos mathematics can be done. In a higher topos not only mathematics can be done but also "n-geometry", which is [[higher homotopy theory]]. The [[topos hypothesis]] is that the (n+1)-category nCat is a Grothendieck (n+1)-topos. Higher topos theory can also be used in a purely algebro-geometric way to solve various moduli problems in this setting.

'''Traffic signs''' or '''road signs''' are signs erected at the side of or above [[road]]s to give instructions or provide information to road users. The earliest signs were simple wooden or stone milestones. Later, signs with directional arms were introduced, for example, the [[fingerpost]]s in the United Kingdom and their wooden counterparts in [[Saxon post milestone|Saxony]].

With traffic volumes increasing since the 1930s, many countries have adopted pictorial signs or otherwise simplified and standardized their signs to overcome language barriers, and enhance traffic safety. Such pictorial signs use symbols (often silhouettes) in place of words and are usually based on international protocols. Such signs were first developed in Europe, and have been adopted by most countries to varying degrees.

==International conventions==
Various international conventions have helped to achieve a degree of uniformity in Traffic Signing in various countries.&lt;ref&gt;Traffic Signs Manual Introduction  1982 https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/203662/traffic-signs-manual-chapter-01.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Categories==
[[File:Kuh-Warnung.jpg|thumb|Sign warning of cattle crossing in a rural road of [[Madeira|Madeira island]], [[Portugal]]]]

Traffic signs can be grouped into several types. For example, Annexe 1 of the [[Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals]] (1968), which on 30 June 2004 had 52 signatory countries, defines eight categories of signs:
*A. Danger [[warning sign]]s
*B. [[Priority signs]]
*C. [[Prohibitory traffic sign|Prohibitory]] or restrictive signs
*D. [[Mandatory sign]]s
*E. [[Special regulation sign]]s
*F. [[Information sign|Information, facilities, or service signs]]
*G. [[Direction, position, or indication sign]]s
*H. Additional panels

In the United States, Canada, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand signs are categorized as follows:
*[[Regulatory sign]]s
*[[Warning sign]]s
*Guide signs
**[[Street name sign]]s
**[[Highway shield|Route marker]] signs
**[[Limited-access road|Expressway]] signs
**[[Freeway]] signs
**[[Welcome sign]]s
**Informational signs
**[[Recreation]] and [[culture|cultural]] interest signs
*[[Emergency management]] ([[civil defense]]) signs
*Temporary traffic control ([[construction]] or work zone) signs
*[[School]] signs
*[[Railroad]] and [[light rail]] signs
*[[Bicycle]] signs

In the United States, the categories, placement, and graphic standards for traffic signs and [[pavement marker (roads)|pavement markings]] are legally defined in the [[Federal Highway Administration]]'s ''[[Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices]]'' as the standard.

A rather informal distinction among the directional signs is the one between advance directional signs, interchange directional signs, and reassurance signs. Advance directional signs appear at a certain distance from the interchange, giving information for each direction. A number of countries do not give information for the road ahead (so-called "pull-through" signs), and only for the directions left and right. Advance directional signs enable drivers to take precautions for the exit (e.g., switch lanes, double check whether this is the correct exit, slow down).
They often do not appear on lesser roads, but are normally posted on expressways and motorways, as drivers would be missing exits without them. While each nation has its own system, the first approach sign for a motorway exit is mostly placed at least {{convert|1000|m}} from the actual interchange. After that sign, one or two additional advance directional signs typically follow before the actual interchange itself.

==History==
[[File:Campidoglio - il miliarium.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Roman milestone]]
[[File:SinalTransitoSalvador.JPG|thumb|right|17th century traffic sign in Salvador street, [[Lisbon]], Portugal stating which traffic should back up to give way:&lt;br&gt;''Year of 1686. [[Peter II of Portugal|His Majesty]] commands all [[coach (vehicle)|coach]]es, [[carriage]]s and [[litter (vehicle)|litter]]s coming from Salvador's entrance to back up to the same part'']]
[[File:Traffic Camera.svg|thumb|right|Speed camera sign used in Canada, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Georgia, Hong Kong, Iceland, Iran, Ireland, Latvia, Malta, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom]]

The earliest road signs were [[milestone]]s, giving distance or direction; for example, the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] erected stone columns throughout their empire giving the distance to Rome. In the [[Middle Ages]], multidirectional signs at intersections became common, giving directions to cities and towns.

In 1686, the first known Traffic Regulation Act in Europe is established by King [[Peter II of Portugal]]. This act foresees the placement of [[priority sign]]s in the narrowest streets of [[Lisbon]], stating which traffic should back up to give way. One of these signs still exists at Salvador street, in [[Alfama|the neighborhood of Alfama]].

The first modern road signs erected on a wide scale were designed for riders of high or "ordinary" bicycles in the late 1870s and early 1880s. These machines were fast, silent and their nature made them difficult to control, moreover their riders travelled considerable distances and often preferred to tour on unfamiliar roads. For such riders, cycling organizations began to erect signs that warned of potential hazards ahead (particularly steep hills), rather than merely giving distance or directions to places, thereby contributing the sign type that defines "modern" traffic signs.

The development of automobiles encouraged more complex [[signage systems]] using more than just text-based notices. One of the first modern-day road sign systems was devised by the Italian Touring Club in 1895. By 1900, a Congress of the International League of Touring Organizations in Paris was considering proposals for standardization of road signage. In 1903 the British government introduced four "national" signs based on shape, but the basic patterns of most traffic signs were set at the 1908 [[International Road Congress]] in [[Paris]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} In 1909, nine European governments agreed on the use of four pictorial symbols, indicating "bump", "curve", "intersection", and "grade-level railroad crossing". The intensive work on international road signs that took place between 1926 and 1949 eventually led to the development of the European road sign system. Both Britain and the United States developed their own road signage systems, both of which were adopted or modified by many other nations in their respective spheres of influence. The UK adopted a version of the European road signs in 1964 and, over past decades, North American signage began using some symbols and graphics mixed in with English.

Over the years, change was gradual. Pre-industrial signs were stone or wood, but with the development of Darby's method of smelting iron using coke, painted cast iron became favoured in the late 18th and 19th centuries. Cast iron continued to be used until the mid-20th century, but it was gradually displaced by aluminium or other materials and processes, such as vitreous enamelled and/or pressed malleable iron, or (later) steel. Since 1945 most signs have been made from sheet aluminium with adhesive plastic coatings; these are normally [[Retroreflector|retroreflective]] for nighttime and low-light visibility. Before the development of reflective plastics, reflectivity was provided by glass reflectors set into the lettering and symbols.

New generations of traffic signs based on electronic displays can also change their text (or, in some countries, symbols) to provide for "intelligent control" linked to automated traffic sensors or remote manual input. In over 20 countries, real-time [[Traffic Message Channel]] incident warnings are conveyed directly to vehicle navigation systems using inaudible signals carried via FM radio, 3G cellular data and satellite broadcasts. Finally, cars can pay tolls and trucks pass safety screening checks using video numberplate scanning, or RFID transponders in windshields linked to antennae over the road, in support of on-board signalling, toll collection, and travel time monitoring.

Yet another "medium" for transferring information ordinarily associated with visible signs is [[RIAS (Remote Infrared Audible Signage)]], e.g., "talking signs" for print-handicapped (including blind/low-vision/illiterate) people. These are infra-red transmitters serving the same purpose as the usual graphic signs when received by an appropriate device such as a hand-held receiver or one built into a cell phone.

Road signs in Japan are either controlled by local police authorities under {{nihongo|Road Traffic Law|道路交通法|Dōro Kōtsūhō}} or by other road-controlling entities including [[Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism]], local municipalities, [[NEXCO]] (companies controlling expressways), under {{nihongo|Road Law|道路法|Dōrohō}}. Most of the design of the road signs in Japan are similar to the signs on the [[Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals|Vienna Convention]], except for some significant variances, such as stop sign with a red downward triangle. The main signs are categorized into four meaning types: 
* Guidance (white characters on blue in general – on green in expressways), 
* Warning (black characters and symbols on yellow diamond), 
* Regulation (red or blue circle, depending on prohibition or regulation), 
* And instruction (mostly white characters or symbols on blue square).

[[File:AH26 (N1) sign.svg|thumb|150px|Route marker sign for [[Pan-Philippine Highway|Asian Highway 26]], as seen on [[EDSA (road)|EDSA]] and the Maharlika Highway.]]

Road signs in the Philippines are standardized in the ''Road Signs and Pavement Markings Manual'', published by the [[Department of Public Works and Highways (Philippines)|Department of Public Works and Highways]]. Philippine road signage practice closely follow those used in [[Europe]], but with local adaptations and some minor influences from the US [[Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices|MUTCD]] and [[Road signs in Australia|Australian road signs]]. However, some road signs may differ by locale, and mostly diverge from the national standard. For example, the [[Metropolitan Manila Development Authority]] (MMDA) has used pink and light blue in its signage for which it has been heavily criticised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/90633/news/nation/mmda-defends-pink-as-traffic-enforcement-standard|title=MMDA defends 'pink' as traffic enforcement standard|work=GMA News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/146746/news/nation/probe-looms-over-mmda-s-pink-traffic-signs|title=Probe looms over MMDA's pink traffic signs|work=GMA News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Road signs in the Philippines are classified as:
*Regulatory signs
*Warning signs
*Guide signs
*Expressway signs
*Traffic instruction signs

Regulatory road signs – other than the stop and give way signs – are generally circular, with (for prohibitions) a black symbol on a white background within a red border, or (for mandatory instructions) a white symbol on a blue background. In some cases circular regulatory signs are placed on white rectangular panels together with text supplementing their meanings.

Most warning signs display a black symbol on a white background within a red-bordered equilateral triangle. Since 2012, however, a more visibly distinctive design (taken from that used for school signs in the US) has been adopted for pedestrian-related signs: these consist of a fluorescent yellow-green pentagon with black border and symbol. Additional panels may be placed below signs to supplement their meanings.

Guide signs are divided into directional signs, service area signs, route markers, and tourist-related signs, with influence from both American and Australian practice. Directional signs use a green background with white letters and arrows. Service area signs use a blue background with white letters, arrows, and symbols. Tourist-related signs use a brown background with white letters, arrows, and symbols. The [[Reassurance marker|route marker sign]], excluding the [[Pan-Philippine Highway|AH26]] route marker, is based on the Australian National Route marker, but reserved for future use.

Signs on expressways mostly take elements from [[Freeways in Australia|Australian motorway/freeway]] signs. Exit signs, wrong way signs and start/end of expressway signs are very similar to Australian freeway signage. Traffic instruction signs are textual signs used to supplement warning and regulatory signs.

===Saudi Arabia===
Road signs in [[Saudi Arabia]] frequently show their text both in [[Arabic]] and [[English language|English]]. Road signs also indicate which part of the road is for Muslims, and which part is for non-Muslims, for instance near [[Mecca]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170202211625/https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C3nkCYZUkAA-Of4.jpg Saudi highway signs near Makkah (archived)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the signing of the 1931 Geneva Convention concerning the Unification of Road Signals by a number of countries that the standardization of the traffic signs started in Europe. The 1931 Convention rules were developed in the 1949 Geneva Protocol on Road Signs and Signals.

In 1968, the European countries signed the [[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic]] treaty, with the aim of standardizing traffic regulations in participating countries in order to facilitate international road traffic and to increase road safety. Part of the treaty was the [[Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals]], which defined the traffic signs and signals. As a result, in Western Europe the traffic signs are well standardized, although there are still some country-specific exceptions, mostly dating from the pre-1968 era.

The principle of the European traffic sign standard is that certain shapes and colours are to be used with consistent meanings:
* Triangular signs (black symbols on a white or yellow background) warn of dangers. The Vienna Convention additionally allows an alternative shape for such signs, namely a right-angled diamond – although in Europe this shape is regularly used only in the [[Republic of Ireland]]. 
* Regulatory signs are round: those indicating a prohibition or limit are black on white (or yellow) with a red border; those giving a mandatory order are white on blue. 
* Informational and various other secondary signs are of rectangular shape. 
* The animals which may be depicted on warning signs include cattle, deer, ducks, elk, frogs, horses, sheep, monkeys (in [[Gibraltar]]), and [[polar bear]]s (on [[Svalbard]]). The Convention allows any animal image to be used.

Directional signs ("guide signs" in American parlance) have not been harmonized under the Convention, at least not on ordinary roads. As a result, there are substantial differences in directional signage throughout Europe. Differences apply to the choice of typeface, arrows and, most notably, colours. The convention does, however, specify that the type of directional signage used should, for each country, distinguish limited-access roads ("motorways") from ordinary, all-purpose roads.

Directional signage on motorways uses: 
* white-on-green in, for example, [[Albania]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Cyprus]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]], the [[Republic of Macedonia]], [[Romania]], [[Serbia]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], and [[Turkey]]
* white-on-blue in, for example, [[Austria]], [[Belarus]], [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[Luxembourg]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Spain]], and the [[United Kingdom]].

Differences are greater for non-motorways: 
* White-on-blue in Italy, Switzerland, Sweden, the Czech Republic, Greece, Cyprus, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, [[Latvia]], [[Estonia]], Finland, Turkey, and the Netherlands (in this case the same as on motorways).
* White-on-green in the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Poland, France, Hungary, and Portugal (only on the few primary roads that still have not been transformed in motorways), 
* Black-on-yellow in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Germany, Luxembourg, Norway, Slovenia, Serbia, and Croatia. 
* Red-on-white in Denmark (though white-on-blue on motorway exits and all overhead gantries) 
* Black-on-white in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fomento.gob.es/NR/rdonlyres/10C10CF6-54D9-4732-AE70-26D36268DF9D/107300/1110401.pdf |format=PDF |title=Norma 8.1-I.C. |publisher=Ministerio de Fomento, Gobierno de España |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140309063723/http://www.fomento.gob.es/NR/rdonlyres/10C10CF6-54D9-4732-AE70-26D36268DF9D/107300/1110401.pdf |archivedate=2014-03-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Anons keep adding more and more countries... these need to be verified--&gt;

The black-on-white signposting of secondary roads distinguishes them from primary roads in Finland, France, Portugal, the [[Republic of Ireland]], Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. In Germany, Hungary, Italy, Romania, and Sweden black-on-white indicates urban-only roads or urban destinations.

The signposting of road numbers also differs greatly, except that [[European route number]]s, if displayed, are always indicated using white characters on a green rectangle. European route numbers are, however, not signed at all in the United Kingdom.

The Convention recommends that certain signs – such as "[[Stop sign|STOP]]", "ZONE", etc. – be in English; however, use of the local language is also permitted. If a language uses non-Latin characters, a [[Latin script|Latin-script]] transliteration of the names of cities and other important places should also be given. Road signs in the [[Republic of Ireland]] are bilingual, using [[Irish language|Irish]] and English. [[Wales]] similarly uses bilingual [[Welsh language|Welsh]]–English signs, while some parts of [[Scotland]] have bilingual [[Scottish Gaelic]]–English signs. Finland also uses bilingual signs, in [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]. Signs in Belgium are in French, Dutch, or German depending on the region. In the Brussels Capital Region, road signs are in both French and Dutch. Signs in Switzerland are in [[French language|French]], [[Swiss Standard German|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], or [[Romansh language|Romansh]] depending on the canton.

European countries – with the notable exception of the United Kingdom, where distances and lengths are indicated in miles, yards, feet, and inches, and speed limits are expressed in miles per hour – use the [[metric system]] on road signs.

For countries driving on the left, the convention stipulates that the traffic signs should be mirror images of those used in countries driving on the right. This practice, however, is not systematically followed in the four European countries driving on the left, Cyprus, [[Malta]], the [[Republic of Ireland]], and the United Kingdom. The convention permits the use of two background colours for danger and prohibition signs: white or yellow. Most countries use white, with a few – such as Finland, [[Iceland]], Poland, and Sweden – opting for yellow as this tends to improve the winter-time visibility of signs in areas where snow is prevalent. In some countries, such as France, white is the normal background colour for such signs, but yellow is used for temporary signage (as, for example, at road works).

European traffic signs have been designed with the principles of [[heraldry]] in mind;{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} i.e., the sign must be clear and able to be resolved at a glance. Most traffic signs conform to heraldic tincture rules, and use symbols rather than written texts for better [[semiotics|semiotic]] clarity.

===Croatia===
Croatian road signs follow the Vienna convention ([[SFR Yugoslavia]] was the original signatory for Croatia, which is now a contracting party itself). The most common signs are: 
* Yellow and black signs ''for direction''.
* Blue and white signs ''for information''.
* White-on-green signs are used on the highways.

In the first years following Croatia's independence, its traffic signs were the same as in the rest of the former Yugoslavia. In the early 2000s, replacement of the yellow background of warning signs began, and new signs now use a white background.

The signage typeface is [[SNV (typeface)|SNV]], as with the other countries of the former Yugoslavia.

===Iceland===
{{Main|Road signs in Iceland}}
Road signs in Iceland mainly follow the [[Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals|Vienna Convention]], but use a variant of the colour scheme and minor design changes similar to the signs in Sweden.

===Ireland===
[[File:Sign on the N8 at it's terminus on the M7.jpg|thumb|left|Advance directional sign in for a roundabout in Ireland. The green background indicates that this sign is on a national road, with the blue patches left and right indicating a [[motorway]] (with symbol) and the white patches indicating a [[Regional road (Ireland)|regional road]] or local road.]]

{{Main|Road signs in the Republic of Ireland}}
Until the partition of [[Ireland]] in 1922 and the independence of the [[Irish Free State]] (now the [[Republic of Ireland]]), British standards applied across the island. In 1926 road sign standards similar to those used in the UK at the time were adopted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/ZZSI55Y1926.html S.I. No. 55/1926: Road Signs and Traffic Signals Regulations, 1926] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060226051244/http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/ZZSI55Y1926.html |date=2006-02-26 }} – [[Irish Statute Book]]&lt;/ref&gt; Law requires that the signs be written in both [[Irish language|Irish]] and English.

In 1956, road signs in the [[Republic of Ireland|Republic]] were changed from the UK standard with the adoption of US-style "diamond" signs for many road hazard warnings (junctions, bends, railway crossings, traffic lights).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/ZZSI284Y1956.html S.I. No. 284/1956: Traffic Signs Regulations, 1956] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060905152429/http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/ZZSI284Y1956.html |date=2006-09-05 }} - Irish Statute Book&lt;/ref&gt; Some domestic signs were also invented, such as the keep-left sign (a black curved arrow pointing to the upper-left, although some are similar to the European "white arrow on blue disk" signs), while some other signs are not widely adopted outside Ireland, such as the no-entry sign (a black arrow pointing ahead in a white circle with a red slashed circumference).

Directional signage is similar to current United Kingdom standards. The same colours are used for directional signs in Ireland as in the UK, and the UK Transport and Motorway fonts are used. Unlike Wales and Scotland, where Welsh and Gaelic place-names use the upright Transport face, Irish place-names are rendered in an italic face.

In January 2005 Ireland adopted metric speed limits. Around 35,000 existing signs were replaced and a further 23,000 new signs erected bearing the speed limit in kilometres per hour. To avoid confusion with the old signs, each speed limit sign now has "km/h" beneath the numerals. Also, since the adoption of signs based on the ''Warboys Committee'' standard in 1977, Irish directional signs have used the metric system; however, unlike with the later speed limit changeover, there was no effort made to change the existing signage, and {{As of|2007|lc=on}} many finger posts still remain on rural roads with distances in miles, although the numbers continue to decline as roads are improved.

In late 2007 Ireland began an extensive programme of sign and post replacement. Good examples are the M1 ([[Dublin]]–[[Dundalk]]) and the M50 ([[Dublin]]). While being mostly the same as the old signs, it is welcome as a lot of the signs were damaged/stained. About half of the new posts are now two medium posts with crosshatched metal posts in-between instead of one large pole to minimise the damage in case of a crash.

===Latvia===
Road signs in Latvia largely adhere to [[Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals|Vienna Convention]] guidelines. In detailed design they closely resemble the signs used in Germany.

===Netherlands===
{{Main|Road signs in the Netherlands}}
Road signs in the Netherlands follow the Vienna Convention. Directional signs (which have not been harmonized under the Convention) always use blue as the background colour. The destinations on the sign are printed in white. If the destination is not a town (but an area within town or some other kind of attraction), that destination will be printed in black on a separate white background within the otherwise blue sign.

The Netherlands always signposts European road numbers where applicable (i.e., on the advance directional signs, the interchange direction signs and on the [[Reassurance marker|reassurance signs]]). Dutch national road numbers are placed on a rectangle, with motorways being signposted in white on a red rectangle (as an A''xx'') and primary roads in black on a yellow rectangle (as N''xx''). When a motorway changes to a primary road, its number remains the same, but the A is replaced by the N. So at a certain point the A2 becomes N2, and when it changes to a motorway again, it becomes A2 again.

Signs intended for bike-riders always go on white signs with red or green letters.

The Dutch typeface, known as ANWB-Ee, is based on the US typeface. A new font, named ANWB-Uu (also known as Redesign), has been developed in 1997 and appears on many recent Dutch signs. On the motorways however the typeface remains the ANWB-Ee or a similar typeface. The language of the signs is typically Dutch, even though bilingual signs may be used, when the information is relevant for tourists.

===Norway===
{{Main|Road signs in Norway}}
[[File:Norwegian-road-sign-713.svg|thumb|Upper left and right and middle right are standard directional signs. Lower left is for a commercial facility, and lower right is for a temporary detour.]]

Signs in Norway mostly follow the Vienna Convention, except the polar bear warning sign, which is a white bear on a black background and a red border. 
These are the directional signs:
* Signs for motorways are blue with white text 
* Those for regular roads to towns and cities are yellow with black lettering
* Signs for industrial areas, commercial facilities etc. are white with black letters
* Signs for tourist attractions, national parks, museums etc. are brown with white lettering

The signs for road numbering are rectangular, and have this colour scheme:
* European routes (E6, E18, etc.) are green with white lettering
* National routes are also green with white lettering
* Province owned roads are white with black lettering
* Municipality owned roads have the name of the road, instead of a number, and are white with black lettering

===Sweden===
[[File:Moose-warning.svg|thumb|right|Swedish [[Moose|elk]] warning sign]]
{{Main|Road signs in Sweden}}
The road signs in Sweden mostly follow the Vienna Convention with a few adaptations, however, allowed within the convention:
* The background of warning signs is yellow
* Warning signs for elk and reindeer
* The background of direction signs is blue with white text
* The background of motorway direction signs is green with white text
* When applicable, the language is [[Swedish language|Swedish]] in Sweden.

The signage typeface [[Tratex]] is used exclusively in Sweden and is available as [[freeware]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vv.se/templates/page3____2789.aspx Teckensnitt på vägmärken / Vägverket&lt;!--Bot generated title--&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060420173537/http://www.vv.se/templates/page3____2789.aspx |date=2006-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland and Liechtenstein===
[[File:CH-Hinweissignal-Wegweiser in Tabellenform.svg|thumb|right|Swiss signpost in table format]]
{{Main|Road signs in Switzerland and Liechtenstein}}

Even though Switzerland is not a member of the EU, the road signs mostly follow the Vienna Convention with a few adaptations and exceptions. Road signs are categorized as follows:

*Warning signs
*Prohibition signs (Regulatory)
*Mandatory instruction signs (Regulatory)
*Priority signs
*Conducting indication signs
*Routing indication signs
*Informational signs
*Complementary panels
*Road markings
*Traffic lights
*Police instructions

Distances and other measurements are displayed in [[Metric system|metric]] units. Starting 2003, [[ASTRA-Frutiger]] is the typeface used to replace [[SNV (typeface)|SNV]], which is still used in several European countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nzz.ch/newzzdb6ac1f2-12-1.201330 |title="Frutiger" für die Strasse |language=de |newspaper=[[NZZ]] |location=Zurich, Switzerland |date=20 January 2003 |author=rel |accessdate=2017-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major exceptions from the norm are:

*Signs use one of the four national languages corresponding to the location.
*Destinations are spelled according to their local spelling, e.g. Genève for Geneva, also in German or Italian Switzerland.
*Motor-/expressway signs are white text on green background.
*Main road/route signs are white text on blue background.
*Minor road/route signs are black text on white background.
*Detour route signs are black text on orange background.
[[File:CH-Hinweissignal-Bergpoststrasse.svg|thumb|right|[[Road signs in Switzerland and Liechtenstein#Conducting indication signs|Swiss sign no. 4.05 Mountain postal road]]]]
*Bicycle and mountain bike routes, and routes for vehicle-like transport means are white text on falu red background.
*Commercial direction signs are black text on grey background with a red dot.
*Mandatory generally maximum speed limit of 50&amp;nbsp;km/h within urban settings is valid with entry of a village or town (sign no. 4.27 or 4.29) even without producing the corresponding sign (sign no. 2.30.1).
*Mountain postal road sign (sign no. 4.05 and 4.06) indicating priority to public transport on (mountain) roads.
*There are more priority signs than usual (often related to the [[Priority to the right]] rule).

===United Kingdom===
[[File:Magic Roundabout Schild db.jpg|thumb|right|One of the more unusual UK road signs, at the [[Magic Roundabout (Swindon)|Magic Roundabout]] in [[Swindon]]]]
[[File:Caernarfon one way sign.jpg|thumb|upright|Bilingual road sign in Wales]]
{{Main|Road signs in the United Kingdom}}
Traffic signing in the UK conforms broadly to European norms, though a number of signs are unique to Britain and direction signs omit [[International E-road network|European route numbers]]. The current sign system, introduced on 1 January 1965, was developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s by the Anderson Committee, which established the [[motorway]] signing system, and by the [[Worboys Committee]], which reformed signing for existing all-purpose roads. (For illustrations of most British road signs, see 'Know your traffic signs'&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/know-your-traffic-signs&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[GOV.UK]] website.)

The UK remains the only [[European Union]] member nation and the only Commonwealth country to use non-[[metric system|metric]] ([[imperial unit|Imperial]]) measurements for distance and speed, although "authorised weight" signs have been in metric tonnes since 1981 and there is currently a dual-unit (metric first) option for height and width restriction signage, intended for use on safety grounds. On motorways kilometre signs are visible at intervals of {{convert|500|m}} indicating the distance from the start of the motorway. (See [[Driver location sign]]).

Three colour schemes exist for direction signs: 
* On motorways they are blue with white lettering
* On primary routes they are green with white lettering and yellow route numbers
* A non-primary route has white signs with black lettering
* A fourth colour scheme, black on yellow, is seen on temporary signs, for example marking a diversionary route avoiding a road closure.

Two [[typeface]]s are specified for British road signs. [[Transport (typeface)|Transport]] "Medium" or Transport "Heavy" are used for all text on fixed permanent signs and most temporary signage, depending on the colour of the sign and associated text colour; dark text on a white background is normally set in "Heavy" so that it stands out better. However route numbers on motorway signs use a taller limited character set typeface called "Motorway".

Signs are generally [[bilingual sign|bilingual]] in all parts of Wales (English/[[Welsh language|Welsh]] or Welsh/English), and similar signs are beginning to be seen in parts of the [[Scottish Highlands]] (English/[[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]]).

All signs and their associated regulations can be found in the [[Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2002/20023113.htm |title=The Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions 2002 |publisher=opsi.gov.uk |accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as updated by the TSRGD 2008, TSRGD 2011 and TSRGD 2016 and complemented by the various chapters of the "Traffic Signs Manual".

===Color schemes{{anchor|Color schemes}}===
The [[Northern America]]n, [[Australia]]n, and [[New Zealand]] colors normally have these meanings:
*[[red]] with white for [[stop sign]]s, yield, and forbidden actions (such as No Parking)
*[[green]] with white letters for informational signs, such as directions, distances, and places
*[[brown]] with white letters for signs to [[park]]s, [[historic site]]s, [[ski area]]s, [[forest]]s, and [[campground]]s
*[[blue]] with white symbols (or [[logo sign|business logos]]) for [[rest area]]s, [[food]], [[gasoline]], [[hospitals]], [[lodging]], and other services
*[[white]] with [[black]] (or [[red]]) letters for regulatory signs, such as [[speed limit]]s (or [[parking]])
*[[yellow]] with black letters and [[symbol]]s for warning signs, such as curves and [[school zone]]s
*[[orange (color)|orange]] with black letters for temporary traffic control zones and [[Detour (road)|detour]]s associated with [[road construction]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/kno-history.htm|title=The Evolution of MUTCD|work=dot.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[purple]] for "lanes restricted to use only by vehicles with registered [[electronic toll collection]] (ETC) accounts",&lt;ref name=mutcd1a12&gt;[http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/htm/2009/part1/part1a.htm#section1A12 Section 1A.12 Color Code], ''Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices''&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[EZPass]].
*[[black]] with white letters or arrows for lane use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icbc.com/driver-licensing/Getting-licensed/drivers3.pdf |format=PDF |title=Signs, signals and road markings |publisher=icbc.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022032056/http://www.icbc.com/driver-licensing/Getting-licensed/drivers3.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US ''Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices'' prescribes four other colors:
&lt;ref name=mutcd1a12/&gt;
*[[Fluorescence|fluorescent]] [[yellow-green]] with black symbols for school zone, school bus stop, pedestrian, playground, and bicycle warning signs
*fluorescent [[pink]] with black letters and symbols for [[incident management]] signs
*[[coral (color)|coral]] and [[light blue]], which are unassigned but reserved for potential future use.

Regulatory signs are also sometimes seen with white letters on red or black signs. In [[Quebec]], blue is often used for public services such as rest areas; many black-on-yellow signs are red-on-white instead.

Many [[US states]] and [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian provinces]] now use fluorescent orange for construction signs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/htm/2009/part6/part6f.htm#section6F02 Section 6F.02 General Characteristics of Signs] [Temporary Traffic Control], ''Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Highway symbols and markers===
[[File:Route 663 sign.JPG|thumb|left|Rural highway sign, [[Saskatchewan]].]]
Every state and province has different [[Highway shield|markers]] for its own highways, but use standard ones for all federal highways. Many special highways – such as the [[Queen Elizabeth Way]], [[Trans-Canada Highway]], and various [[auto trail]]s in the U.S. – have used unique signs. Counties in the US sometimes use a [[pentagon]]al blue sign with yellow letters for numbered [[County highway|county roads]], though the use is inconsistent even within states.

===Units===
Distances on traffic signs generally follow the measurement system in use locally: that is to say, the [[metric system]] in all countries of the world except [[Burma]], [[Liberia]], the United Kingdom, and the United States – although the metric system is used in the UK for all purposes other than the display of road distances and the defining of speed limits, and in the US the Federal Department of Transportation has developed (very rarely used) metric standards for all signs.

===Languages===
[[File:Mistassini roadsign.jpg|thumb|1ight|Multilingual road signs in [[Mistissini, Quebec]] in [[Cree language|Cree]], English, and [[French language|French]].]]
Where signs use a language, the recognized language/s of the area is normally used. Signs in most of the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand are in English. Quebec uses [[French language|French]], while [[New Brunswick]] and the [[Jacques Cartier Bridge|Jacques-Cartier]] and [[Champlain Bridge, Montreal|Champlain]] bridges, in Montreal (as well as some parts in the [[West Island]]), use both English and French, and a number of other provinces and states, such as [[Ontario]], [[Manitoba]], and [[Vermont]] use bilingual French–English signs in certain localities. Puerto Rico (a US territory) and Mexico use Spanish. Within a few miles of the [[US–Mexico border]], road signs are often in English and Spanish in places like San Diego, Yuma, and El Paso. Indigenous languages, mainly [[Nahuatl]] as well as some [[Mayan languages]], have been used as well.

===Typefaces===
The typefaces predominantly used on signs in the US and Canada are the [[Highway Gothic|FHWA alphabet series]] (Series B through Series F and Series E Modified). Details of letter shape and spacing for these alphabet series are given in "Standard Alphabets for Traffic Control Devices", first published by the [[Bureau of Public Roads]] (BPR) in 1945 and subsequently updated by the [[Federal Highway Administration]] (FHWA). It is now part of Standard Highway Signs (SHS), the companion volume to the MUTCD which gives full design details for signfaces.

Initially, all of the alphabet series consisted of uppercase letters and digits only, although lowercase extensions were provided for each alphabet series in a 2002 revision of SHS. Series B through Series F evolved from identically named alphabet series which were introduced in 1927.

Straight-stroke letters in the 1927 series were substantially similar to their modern equivalents, but unrounded glyphs were used for letters such as B, C, D, etc., to permit more uniform fabrication of signs by illiterate painters. Various state highway departments and the federal BPR experimented with rounded versions of these letters in the following two decades.

The modern, rounded alphabet series were finally standardized in 1945 after rounded versions of some letters (with widths loosely appropriate for Series C or D) were specified as an option in the 1935 MUTCD and draft versions of the new typefaces had been used in 1942 for guide signs on the newly constructed [[Pentagon road network]].

The mixed-case alphabet now called Series E Modified, which is the standard for destination legend on freeway guide signs, originally existed in two parts: an all-uppercase Series E Modified, which was essentially similar to Series E, except for a larger stroke width, and a lowercase-only alphabet. Both parts were developed by the California Division of Highways (now [[Caltrans]]) for use on freeways in 1948–1950.

Initially, the Division used all-uppercase Series E Modified for [[button copy|button-reflectorized]] letters on ground-mounted signs and mixed-case legend (lowercase letters with Series D capitals) for externally illuminated overhead guide signs. Several Eastern turnpike authorities blended all-uppercase Series E Modified with the lowercase alphabet for destination legends on their guide signs.

Eventually, this combination was accepted for destination legend in the first manual for signing Interstate highways, which was published in 1958 by the [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials|American Association of State Highway Officials]] and adopted as the national standard by the BPR.

====Uses of non-FHWA typefaces====
[[File:Michigan left lighted sign.jpg|right|thumb|Some traffic signs, such as the left-turn prohibition sign hanging from this gantry, are lit for better visibility, particularly at night or in inclement weather.]]
The US [[National Park Service]] uses [[NPS Rawlinson Roadway]], a [[serif]] typeface, for guide signage; it typically appears on a brown background. Rawlinson has replaced [[Clarendon (typeface)|Clarendon]] as the official NPS typeface, but some states still use Clarendon for recreational signage.

[[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], in the past, used uppercase Series D with a custom lowercase alphabet on its freeway guide signs; the most distinctive feature of this typeface is the lack of a dot on lowercase ''i'' and ''j''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gribblenation.com/gapics/gallery/i20w-exit60-natsiatka.jpg |title=Image |publisher=gribblenation.com |accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent installations appear to include the dots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gribblenation.com/gapics/gallery/albany-exit2-3-natsiatka.jpg |title=Photo |publisher=gribblenation.com |accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Clearview (typeface)|Clearview]] typeface, developed by US researchers to provide improved legibility, is permitted for light legend on dark backgrounds under FHWA interim approval. Clearview has seen widespread use by state departments of transportation in [[Arkansas]], [[Arizona]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Holstege |first=Sean |date=11 September 2013 |title=Seeing double on I-17?

The [[Kansas Turnpike Authority]] has also introduced Clearview typeface to some of its newer guide signs along the [[Kansas Turnpike]], but the state of [[Kansas]] continues to use the FHWA typefaces for signage on its non-tolled Interstates and freeways.

In [[Canada]], the Ministry of Transportation for the Province of [[British Columbia]] specifies Clearview for use on its highway guide signs,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.th.gov.bc.ca/popular-topics/faq.htm#general 2006 Internet Templates&lt;!--Bot generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and its usage has shown up in [[Ontario]] on the [[Don Valley Parkway]] and [[Gardiner Expressway]] in [[Toronto]] and on new [[400-series highway (Ontario)|400-series highway]] installations in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], [[Regional Municipality of Halton, Ontario|Halton]] and [[Regional Municipality of Niagara, Ontario|Niagara]], as well as street signs in various parts of the province. The font is also being used on newer signs in [[Alberta]], [[Manitoba]], and [[Quebec]].

It is common for local governments, airport authorities, and contractors to fabricate traffic signs using typefaces other than the FHWA series; [[Helvetica]], [[Futura (typeface)|Futura]] and [[Arial]] are common choices.

===New Zealand===
{{Main|Road signs in New Zealand}}
[[New Zealand]] road signs are generally influenced both by American and European practices.

Warning signs are diamond-shaped with a yellow background for permanent warnings, and an orange background for temporary warnings. They are somewhat more pictorial than their American counterparts. This is also true for Canadian signage.

Regulatory signs also follow European practice, with a white circle with a red border indicating prohibitive actions, and a blue circle indicating mandatory actions. White rectangular signs with a red border indicate lane usage directions. Information and direction signs are rectangular, with a green background indicating a [[state highway]], a blue background for all other roads and all services (except in some, where directional signage is white), and a brown background for tourist attractions.

Before 1987, most road signs had black backgrounds – diamonds indicated warnings, and rectangles indicated regulatory actions (with the exception of the Give Way sign (an inverted trapezium), and Stop sign and speed limit signs (which were the same as today)). Information signs were yellow, and direction signage was green on motorways and black everywhere else.

==South America, Central America and the Caribbean==
[[File:Belize Speed Bump Sign.JPG|thumb|Speed bump sign in [[Belize]].]]
Road signs in [[Caribbean]], [[Central America]], and [[South America]] vary from country to country. For the most part, conventions in signage tend to resemble United States signage conventions more so than European and Asian conventions. For example, warning signs are typically diamond-shaped and yellow rather than triangular and white. Some variations include the "Parking" and "No Parking" signs, which contain either a letter ''E'' or ''P'', depending on which word is used locally for "Parking" ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''estacionamiento'' or ''parqueo'', [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''estacionamento''), as well as the Stop sign, which usually reads "Pare" or "Alto". Notable exceptions include speed limit signs, which follow the European conventions, and the "No Entry" sign, often replaced with a crossed upwards arrow.

===Colombia===
Traffic signs in Colombia are classified into three categories: 
* Warning signs
* Mandatory signs 
* Information signs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mintransporte.gov.co/Servicios/Biblioteca/documentos/Manual_senalizacion/index.htm Colombia traffic signs manual] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610234906/http://www.mintransporte.gov.co/Servicios/Biblioteca/documentos/Manual_senalizacion/index.htm |date=2008-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warning signs are very similar to warning signs in United States. They are yellow diamond-shaped with a black symbol (the yellow colour is changed to an orange colour in areas under construction). In certain cases, the yellow colour is shifted to fluorescent yellow (in the School area sign and Chevron sign).

Mandatory signs are similar to European signs. They are circular with a red border, a white background and a black symbol. Stop sign and Yield sign are as European, except the word "Stop" is changed for "Pare" and the Yield sign has no letters, it is a red triangle with white centre.

Information signs have many shapes and colours. Principally they are blue with white symbols and in many cases these signs have an information letter below the symbol.

===Suriname===
Road signs in Suriname are particularly modelled on the [[Road signs in the Netherlands|Dutch road signs]] since Suriname is a former Dutch colony, although traffic drives on the left.

==Automatic traffic sign recognition==
Cars are beginning to feature cameras with automatic [[traffic sign recognition]], beginning with the [[Opel Insignia]]. It mainly recognizes speed limits and no-overtaking areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/lifestyle/autos/news/article_1415817.php/Opel_Insignia_to_feature_traffic_sign_recognition_system |title=Opel Insignia to feature traffic sign recognition system |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101026074935/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/lifestyle/autos/news/article_1415817.php/Opel_Insignia_to_feature_traffic_sign_recognition_system |archivedate=2010-10-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Transformation in economics''' refers to a long-term change in dominant economic activity in terms of prevailing relative engagement or employment of able individuals.

Human economic systems undergo a number of deviations and departures from the "normal" state, trend or development. Among them are Disturbance (short-term disruption, temporary disorder), Perturbation (persistent or repeated divergence, predicament, decline or crisis), Deformation (damage, regime change, loss of self-sustainability, distortion), Transformation (long-term change, restructuring, conversion, new “normal”) and Renewal (rebirth, transmutation, corso-ricorso, renaissance, new beginning).

Transformation is a [[Unidirectional network|unidirectional]] and irreversible change in dominant human economic activity ([[Economic sectors|economic sector]]). Such change is driven by slower or faster continuous improvement in sector productivity growth rate. Productivity growth itself is fueled by advances in technology, inflow of useful innovations, accumulated practical knowledge and experience, levels of education, viability of institutions, quality of decision making and organized human effort. Individual sector transformations are the outcomes of human [[socio-economic]] evolution.

Human economic activity has so far undergone at least four fundamental transformations:

#From nomadic hunting and gathering (H/G) to localized agriculture
#From localized agriculture (A) to internationalized industry
#From international industry (I) to global services
#From global services (S) to public sector (including government, welfare and unemployment, GWU)

This evolution naturally proceeds from securing necessary food, through producing useful things, to providing helpful services, both private and public (See H/G→A→I→S→GWU sequence in Fig. 1).  Accelerating productivity growth rates speed up the transformations, from millennia, through centuries, to decades of the recent era. It is this acceleration which makes transformation relevant economic category of today, more fundamental in its impact than any recession, crisis or depression. The evolution of four forms of capital (Indicated in Fig. 1) accompanies all economic transformations.

Transformation is quite different from accompanying cyclical recessions and crises, despite the similarity of manifested phenomena (unemployment, technology shifts, socio-political discontent, bankruptcies, etc.). However, the tools and interventions used to combat crisis are clearly ineffective for coping with non-cyclical transformations. The problem is whether we face a mere crisis or a fundamental transformation (globalization→relocalization).

== Four key forms of capital ==
[[File:Fig1. Nested hypercycles of the transformations through the parallel evolution of four forms of capital.PNG|thumb|Fig. 1. Nested hypercycles of the transformations through the parallel evolution of four forms of capital|287x287px]]

Fig. 1 refers to the four transformations through the parallel (and overlapping) evolution of four forms of capital: Natural→Built→Human→Social. These evolved forms of capital present a minimal complex of sustainability and self-sustainability of pre-human and human systems.

'''[[Natural capital|Natural capital (N)]]'''. The nature-produced, renewed and reproduced “resources” of land, water, air, raw materials, biomass and organisms. Natural capital is subject to both renewable and non-renewable depletion, degradation, cultivation, recycling and reuse.

'''Built capital (B)'''. The man-made physical assets of infrastructures, technologies, buildings and means of transportation. This is the manufactured “hardware” of nations. This national hardware must be continually maintained, renewed and modernized to assure its continued productivity, efficiency and effectiveness.

'''[[Human capital|Human capital (H)]]'''. The continued investment in people’s skills, knowledge, education, health &amp; nutrition, abilities, motivation and effort. This is the “software” and “brainware” of a nation; most important form of capital for developing nations.

'''[[Social capital|Social capital (S)]]'''. The enabling infrastructure of institutions, civic communities, cultural and national cohesion, collective and family values, trust, traditions, respect and the sense of belonging. This is the voluntary, spontaneous “social order” which cannot be engineered, but its self-production (autopoiesis) can be nurtured, supported and cultivated.

== Parallelism of crises and transformations ==
The triggers that induce the catharsis of a crisis often coincide with and are undistinguishable from the triggers launching qualitative transformations of the economy, business and society at large. While crises are cyclical recessions or slowdowns within the same paradigm, transformation represents a paradigmatic change in the way of doing business: moving towards new standards and quality, in a unique and non-recursive way.  Most developed and mature economies of the world (USA, Japan, Western Europe) are undergoing long-term transformation towards a “new normal” of doing business, state governance and ways of life. Cyclical crisis is a parallel, accompanying phenomenon, subject to different causes, special rules and separate dynamics.

[[Milan Zeleny]] cautions that confounding crisis and transformation as one phenomenon brings forth the confusion, inconsistency and guessing.&lt;ref name="Crisis"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://iospress.metapress.com/content/d54282m4176x844n/ | title=Machine/organism dichotomy and free-market economics: Crisis or transformation? | publisher=IOS Press | author=Zeleny, Milan | journal=Human Systems Management |date=November 2010 | volume=29 | issue=4/2010 | pages=P191–204}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many changes in the market system are cyclical, there are also evolutionary changes which are unidirectional and qualitatively transformational. The transformations of the US economy from agricultural to industrial, or from industrial to services, were not crises, although there were cyclical crises along the way. Transformational “losses” cannot be recovered or regained by definition. Not understanding that is at the core of wasteful spending of rigidly hopeless governmental interventions. Barry Bosworth of the [[Brookings Institution]] confirms:  “The assumption has always been that the U.S. economy will gain back what was lost in a recession. Academics are coming to the realization that this time is different and that those losses appear permanent and cannot be regained.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-03-06/u-dot-s-dot-potential-gdp-revised-downward-as-recession-damage-lingers | title=The GDP in 2017 Is Not Looking Good | publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek | date=March 2014 | author=Brendan Greeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In transformations there are no “losses”, only changes and transitions to a new economic order.

== Underlying pattern of recessions ==
[[File:Percent Job Losses After WWII Recessions.jpg|thumb|Fig. 2. Comparison of major US recessions over past 30 years|452x452px]]

When comparing major US recessions since 1980, as in Fig. 2, it is clear that they have been getting deeper and longer in terms of the recovery of initial employment level. Only the first is classical V shape, there are several W, U and finally L shapes. There clearly is an underlying causal phenomenon which is getting stronger and more persistent over time. Such underlying causation is of interest, as it may signal the prelude and gathering of forces of another emerging transformation.

Looking back, even [[Great Depression in the United States|the Great Depression]] of the 1930s was not just a crisis, but a long-term transformation from the pre-war industrial economy to the post-war service economy in the U.S. However, in the early 1980s, the service sector had started slowing down its employment absorption and growth potential, ultimately leading to the jobless economy of 2011. No such comparisons with the 1930s are useful: one can compare recessions but not transformations. Industrial economy of 1930s and the post-service economy of 2000s are two different “animals” in two different contexts. It is still not clear what kind of transformation is emerging and eventually replaces the service and public sector economy.

The unrecognized confluence of crisis and transformation, and the inability to separate them, lies at the core of old tools ([[Keynesian economics|keynesianism]], [[monetarism]]) not working properly. The tools for adapting successfully to paradigmatic transformation have not been developed.  An example of a paradigmatic transformation would be the shift from geocentric to heliocentric view of our world.  Within both views there can be any number of crises, cyclical failures of old and searches for new theories and practices. But there was only one transformation, from geocentric to heliocentric, and there was nothing cyclical about it. It was resisted with all the might of the mighty: remember Galilei and Bruno. While crises are cyclical corrections and adjustments, transformations are evolutionary shifts or even revolutions (industrial, computer) towards new and different levels of existence.

The most important indicator is the arena of employment, especially in the US, providing clues to transformational qualities of the current global crisis phenomena. Persistent rates of unemployment, combined with falling workforce participation rate indicate that also this crisis is intertwined with underlying transformation and so it displays atypical dynamics and unusual persistence, presenting new challenges to conventional economic thought, business practices and government interventional “toolbox”. Sector evolution and dynamics is the key to explaining these phenomena.

== Sector dynamics ==
[[Economic sectors]] evolve (in terms of employment levels), albeit through fluctuations, in one general direction (along so called S-curve): they emerge, expand, plateau, contract and exit—just like any self-organizing system or living organism. We are naturally interested in the percentage of total workforce employed in a given sector. The dynamics of this percentage provides clues to where and when are the new jobs generated and old ones abandoned.

Sector’s percentage share of employment evolves in dependency on sector’s productivity growth rate.  Agriculture has emerged and virtually disappeared as a source of net employment. Today, only ½ percent or so of total workforce is employed in US agriculture – the most productive sector of the economy. Manufacturing had emerged, peaked and contracted. Services have emerged and started contracting – all due to incessant, unavoidable and desirable productivity growth rates.

The [[Manufacturing in the United States|U.S. absolute manufacturing output]] has more than tripled over the past 60 years. Because of the productivity growth rates, these goods were produced by ever decreasing number of people. While in 1980-2012 total economic output per hour worked increased 85 percent, in manufacturing output per hour skyrocketed by 189 percent. The number of employees in manufacturing was about a third of total workforce in 1953, about a fifth in 1980, and about a tenth (12 million) in 2012. This decline is now accelerating because of the high-tech automation and robotization. This is why President Obama´s policy of “industrial renaissance” and “high-tech manufacturing jobs” is economically flawed and politically without promise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Industrial renaissance in the US: miracle or mirage?|url=http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/13352#.UuhCTBAo6M8|publisher=Spiked Magazine|author=Phil Mullan|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A public sector of employment has been emerging: government, welfare and unemployment, based on tax-financed consumption rather than added value production, sheltered from market forces, producing public services. (Observe that the unemployed are temporary “employees” of the government, as long as they receive payments.) Creating employment in GWU sector is achievable at the expense of productive sectors, i.e. only at the risk of major debt accumulation, in a non-lasting way and with low added value. Sustaining employment growth in such a sector is severely limited by the growing debt financing.

== The Four Basic Sectors ==
The Four Basic Sectors refers to the current stage of [[industrial sector|sector]] evolution, in the sequence of four undergone transformations, namely [[agriculture]], [[industry]], [[Service (business)|services]] and GWU ([[government]], [[welfare]] and [[unemployment]])

The US economy has become one of the most mature (with Japan and Western Europe) in terms of its sector evolution.&lt;ref name="M. Zeleny 1"&gt;{{cite book | title=Human Systems Management: Integrating Knowledge, Management &amp; Systems | publisher=World Scientific | last=Zeleny | first=Milan | year=2005 | pages=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;    It has entered the stage – perhaps as the first economy ever – of declining employment share in both the service and government sectors.

[[Productivity]] growth rates are now{{when|date=February 2018}} accelerating in the US services and its employment creation and absorption potential are declining rapidly. Accelerating productivity growth rates are dictated by global competition and human striving for better [[standards of living]] – they cannot be stopped at will.  In the US there are only three subsectors where net jobs are still being created: [[education in the US|education]], [[health care in the US|health care]], and government. The first two are subject to market forces and will undergo accelerating productivity growth rates and declining employment levels in the near future{{when|date=February 2018}}. The third one, GWU, is sheltered from competition, cannot expand its share substantially because it depends on taxation from other sectors; its [[employment growth]] is [[unsustainable]].{{cn|date=February 2018}}

Slowly, the US economy has shifted towards sectors with lower added value, leading to lower real incomes and increasing indebtness. This is a systemic condition which no amount of regulation and [[Keynesian]]/monetarist stimuli can effectively address.  Even desirable piercing of speculative, employment and debt bubbles has ceased to be politically correct. Even 100% taxation of all incomes would not alleviate US debt.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

So, the US is at the transforming cusp and hundreds of years of sector evolution comes to a halt.  There are only four essential activities humans can do economically: 1. [[food production|Produce food]], 2. Manufacture goods, 3. Provide services (private and public), and 4. Do nothing. This is why the idea of “[[basic income]]”, independent of employment, is being considered e.g. in Switzerland.

US economy has exploited (from employment share viewpoint) all three productive sectors. There is no new sector lurking in the offing: qualitative transformation is taking place. Less developed economies still have time left, some still have to industrialize and some still have the services to expand. But the US economy is now the harbinger of the things to come, the role model for others to follow or reject, but hardly ignore. For the first time in history, this one economy has reached the end of the old model (or paradigm) and is groping to find the new ways of organizing its business, economy and society.&lt;ref name="M. Zeleny 2"&gt;{{cite book | title=Human Systems Management: Integrating Knowledge, Management &amp; Systems | publisher=World Scientific | last=Zeleny | first=Milan | year=2005 | pages=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== New transformation ==

[[File:Fig. 3a. Sector dynamics in the US and unsustainability of GWU.PNG|thumb|Fig. 3a. Sector dynamics in the US and unsustainability of GWU.|354x354px]]
[[File:Fig. 4. Decline in employment in all four sectors opens up a new space..PNG|thumb|Fig. 3b. Decline in employment in all four sectors opens up a new space.|264x264px]]

In search of the better name, the [[Bloomberg Businessweek]] Editor argued as follows:

{{quote|"You’d expect a better name to have emerged by now. It took remarkable ingenuity to unleash the forces that paralyzed markets, overturned governments, and ruined countless lives, not to mention causing an historic decline in global gross domestic product. For creativity to fail in the summing up is just one more insult. Of course, it’s hard to name what you can’t comprehend." |Editor´s Letter|[[Businessweek]] , September 12, 2013}}

Meanwhile, New Transformation has already well advanced.

In Fig. 3a, observe that the US economy has matured in terms of its sector evolution. It has entered the stage – as the first economy ever – of declining employment in the service and GWU sectors.

As Fig. 3a documents, the US economy has exhausted (from employment viewpoint) all three productive sectors and has reached for the 17% in GWU. In Fig. 3b we separate the last workforce bar from Fig. 3a, in order to see the impact of productivity growth today.

All four sectors are subject to accelerated productivity growth rates in the near future. The only expanding space of the workforce is the grey region “?” in Fig. 3b, essentially reflecting the decline in workforce participation rate. This grey area is also the space of the new transformation: that’s where those who left unemployment registers are starting new ventures and enterprises, and participating in regional economies.

This new “transformation” is different from all preceding sector transformations: it does not usher in a new sector but completes the secular cycle of localization→globalization→re-localization. A new economic paradigm is emerging, with a new structure, behavior, institutions and values. A more precise label would be Economic Metamorphosis. [[Metamorphosis]] is the outcome of a series of transformations, not dissimilar to a caterpillar-to-butterfly change of form, through the construction→destruction→reconstruction autopoietic self-production cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Mystery_of_Metamorphosis.html?id=2G7VWWKRMa4C | title=The Mystery of Metamorphosis: A Scientific Detective Story | publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing | date=April 2011 | last=Ryan | first=Frank}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when the recession ends, the metamorphosis of economic form shall continue, accelerate and expand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shale: the ‘IT bubble’ of the 21st century?|url=http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/13363#.UuhZvxAo6M8|publisher=Spiked Magazine|author=Phil Mullan|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Less and less we shall be able to tell the difference. Pressures for increased productivity growth rates, declining employment and workforce participation, as well as budget cuts shall grow unabated. Due to massive automation, sector GDP can grow even under the conditions of declining employment. More than that: increasing the minimum wage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Minimum Wage, Wage and Hour Division, Department of Labor|url=http://www.dol.gov/whd/minimumwage.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; historically rather neutral with respect to employment, will now be readily replacing low-level jobs with ever cheaper and more abundant automation - along with millions of jobs being lost due to the still uninformed and aimless political process. Obscuring the difference between cyclical crisis and the ongoing transformation (metamorphosis) is not without consequences: when true diagnosis is not attempted, and people do not know what is happening with their economy and why, all forms of contagious social unrest follow worldwide.

== Okun's law ==
[[File:Fig. 4. Labor participation.png|thumb|Fig. 4. Labor participation|228x228px]]
In economics, [[Okun's law]] (named after [[Arthur Melvin Okun]]), is an empirically observed relationship relating unemployment to losses in a country's production. This correlation "law" states that a 2% decline in output (GDP) will be accompanied by a 1% rise in unemployment. It has been dubbed as “[http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-09-26/macroeconomic-mystery-u-dot-s-dot-unemployment-subverts-okuns-law Macroeconomic Mystery]”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Macroeconomic Mystery | journal=Business Week |date=30 September – 6 October 2013 | pages=P24}}&lt;/ref&gt; After holding for the past 40 years, it faltered during current “recovery”. Unemployment shot up faster than predicted, but then it fell more quickly than indicated by slow U.S. growth in 2009-2013. Output grew 2% but unemployment is 7.6% instead of 8.8% expected by this “law”.

The notion of transformation explains this artificial mystery. First, unemployment shot up faster because there are no major sectors absorbing and replacing the loss of jobs. Second, unemployment also falls faster because, due to the long duration of the crisis, the workforce participation rate keeps shrinking (In 2007, 66% were working or seeking job, in 2013 only 63.2%), as can be seen in Fig. 4. In other words, people leaving the workforce are not counted among the unemployed. For example, in summer 2013, on average only 148,000 new jobs per month were created, yet unemployment rate dropped steeply to 7.3%, at the cost of 312,000 people dropping out of the work force. The number of unemployed (i.e. actively seeking jobs) is different from the number of people without work – another sign of fundamental transformation and not just a “crisis”.

The correlation between growth and employment is very tenuous during ongoing transformation. Based on productivity growth rates, GDP could accelerate and yet jobs drop precipitously, due to automation, robotization, digitization and self-service of the transformation era. Also, correlations in economics are always dangerous because they do not prove or establish causal relationships.

== Self-service, disintermediation and customization ==
The new transformational paradigm could be defined by the ongoing self-organization of the market economy itself: its rates of self-service, [[disintermediation]] and [[mass customization]] are increasing and becoming most effective on local and regional levels. Because there is no new productive sector to emerge, the economy seeks to reinstate its new balance through these new modes of doing business. Producers and providers are outsourcing their production and services to customers and to technology. Outsourcing to customers is a natural and necessary self-organizing process, including disintermediation, customer integration and mass customization, all driven by the global productivity at the cusp of transformation.

Due to its productivity growth rates, each sector must emerge, grow, persist, stagnate, decline and dissipate in terms of its employment generating capacity. The high-productivity growth sectors are emerging and dissipating first, the low-productivity growth sectors (like services) are completing their life cycles only now. Different productivity growth rates in different sectors are accompanied by virtually uniform growth rates in wages and salaries across all sectors, as required by free market forces.

As a consequence, the goods of high productivity growth sectors (food, manufactured goods) are getting cheaper and the products of low productivity growth sectors (health care, education, insurance) are getting more expensive. In many developing nations this may still be the other way around (due to the prevailing stage of sector evolution): food and manufactured goods more expensive, while services still relatively cheap, as captured in the Figure 5:
[[File:Fig. 5. Uniform wage growth vs. differential productivity rates.PNG|thumb|Fig. 5. Uniform wage growth vs. differential productivity rates|372x372px]]

Rational economics agents tend towards substituting relatively cheaper and capital intensive manufactured goods for relatively more expensive and labor-intensive services. Consumers will use goods instead of services wherever economical and possible. By observing the emergence of automated teller machines instead of bank tellers, self-service gas stations instead of full-service stations, self-driving instead of chauffeurs, do-it-yourself pregnancy kits rather than hospital testing services, self-handled optical scanners rather than cashiers, and cloud computing instead of central mainframes, mature economies are entering the era of self-service, disintermediation and mass customization.

Modern production is primarily based on the processing of information, not on the hauling of goods, humans and machinery over large distances.  One can more effectively “haul the information,” to produce goods and provide services locally. Information and knowledge travel effortlessly through electronic superhighways, through telecommunications and social networks over the internet.

== Relocalization ==
{{See also|Localism (politics)}}
Because there is no new productive sector to emerge, the market system seeks to reinstate its new balance through new modes of doing business. [[Deglobalization]] is taking place, supply chains are turning into demand chains, large economies are focusing on their internal markets, outsourcing is followed by “backsourcing”, returning activities back to the countries and locations of their origin. The original slogan of “Think globally, act locally,” is being re-interpreted as exploiting global information and knowledge in local action, under local conditions and contexts.

While [[globalization]] refers to a restructuring of the initially distributed and localized world economy into spatially reorganized processes of production and consumption across national economies and political states on a global scale, in deglobalization, people move towards relocalization: the global experience and knowledge becoming embodied in local communities. So, the corso-ricorso of socio-economic transformation is properly captured by a triad Localization → Globalization → Relocalization.

The trend of [[deglobalization]] is turning much more significant during these years. The growth of worldwide GDP is now exceeding the overall growth of trade for the first time; foreign investment (Cross Border Capital Flows) is only 60% of their pre-crisis levels and has plunged to some 40 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Financial globalization: Retreat or reset?|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/global_capital_markets/financial_globalization|publisher=McKinsey Global Institute|date=March 2013|author1=Susan Lund |author2=Toos Daruvala |author3=Richard Dobbs }}&lt;/ref&gt;  World capital flows include loans and deposits, foreign investments, bonds and equities – all down in their cross-border segment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6754e5da-76e6-11e3-a253-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2rDTwZEyH | title=Rapid fall in capital flows poses growth risk | publisher=The Financial Times |author1=Ralph Atkins |author2=Keith Fray |date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This means that the rate of globalization has reversed its momentum. Globalizers are still worried about 2014 being the year of irreversible decline. Improvement in the internal growth of U.S.A., EU, and Japan does not carry into external trade – these economies are starting to function as zero-sum.

The income inequality and long-term unemployment lead to re-localized experiments with ''[[Guaranteed Minimum Income]]'' (to be traced to [[Thomas Paine]]) for all citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thomas Paine|url=http://www.ssa.gov/history/tpaine3.html|publisher=Social Security Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.academia.edu/2698139/Two_arguments_for_Basic_Income_Thomas_Paine_1737-1809_and_Thomas_Spence_1750-1814_ | title=Two arguments for Basic Income | last=Marangos | first=John | journal=History of Economic Ideas |date=January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Switzerland this guarantee would be $33,000 per year, regardless of working or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Swiss Join the Fight Against Inequality|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-01-16/inequality-fight-swiss-will-vote-on-minimum-income|publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek|author=Stephan Faris|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the name Generation Basic Income it is now subject to [[Swiss referendums, 2013|Swiss referendum]]. Unemployment then frees people to pursue their own creative talents.

With this transformation, an entirely new vocabulary is emerging in economics: in addition to deglobalization and relocalization, we also encounter glocalization (adjustment of products to local culture) and local community restoration (regional self-government and direct democracy). With relocalization, an entire new cycle of societal corso-ricorso is brought forth. Local services, local production and local agriculture, based on distributed energy generation, additive manufacturing and [[vertical farming]], are enhancing individual, community and regional autonomy through self-service, disintermediation and mass customization. Both requisite technologies and appropriate business models necessary for relocalization are already in place, forming a vital part of our daily business and life experience. New transformation is well on its way.

The concept of a '''Turing pattern''' (often referred to in the plural as '''Turing patterns''') was introduced by the English mathematician [[Alan Turing]] in a 1952 paper entitled ''[[The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Turing | first1=A. M. | authorlink=Alan Turing | title=The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis | journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London]] B | volume=237 | issue=641 | pages=37–72 | doi=10.1098/rstb.1952.0012 | url=http://www.dna.caltech.edu/courses/cs191/paperscs191/turing.pdf | jstor=92463 | year=1952 | bibcode=1952RSPTB.237...37T }}&lt;/ref&gt; This foundational paper describes the way in which [[patterns in nature]] such as stripes and spots can arise naturally out of a homogeneous, uniform state.

The original theory, a [[Reaction–diffusion system|reaction–diffusion]] theory of [[morphogenesis]], has served as an important model in [[theoretical biology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=L. G. | last=Harrison | title=Kinetic Theory of Living Pattern | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | year=1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reaction–diffusion system]]s have attracted much interest as a prototype model for [[pattern formation]]. Patterns such as [[Front (physics)|fronts]], [[hexagon]]s, [[spiral]]s, [[Stripe (pattern)|stripes]] and [[dissipative soliton]]s are found in various types of reaction-diffusion systems, despite large discrepancies, in the local reaction terms for example.

As well as in biological organisms, Turing patterns occur in other natural systems – for example, the wind patterns formed in sand. Although Turing's ideas on morphogenesis and Turing patterns remained dormant for many years, they are now inspirational for much research in [[mathematical biology]].&lt;ref&gt;Woolley, T.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5220">'''Visual control''' is a [[business management]] technique employed in many places where information is communicated by using visual signals instead of texts or other written instructions. The design is deliberate in allowing quick recognition of the information being communicated,  in order to increase efficiency and clarity. These signals can be of many forms, from different coloured clothing for different teams, to focusing measures upon the size of the problem and not the size of the activity, to [[kanban]], [[obeya]] and [[heijunka box]]es and many other diverse examples. In [[The Toyota Way]], it is also known as ''mieruka''.

== Purpose ==
Visual control methods aim to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of a process by making the steps in that process more visible. The theory behind visual control is that if something is clearly visible or in plain sight, it is easy to remember and keep at the forefront of the mind. Another aspect of visual control is that everyone is given the same visual cues and so are likely to have the same vantage point.

There are many different techniques that are used to apply visual control in the workplace. Some companies use visual control as an organizational tool for materials. A clearly labeled storage board lets the employee know exactly where a tool belongs and what tools are missing from the display board. Another simple example of a common visual control is to have reminders posted on cubicle walls so that they remain in plain sight. Visual signs and signals communicate information that is needed to make effective decisions. These decisions may be safety oriented or they may give reminders as to what steps should be taken to resolve a problem. Most companies use visual controls in one degree or another, many of them not even realizing that the visual controls that they are making have a name and a function in the workplace. Whether it is recognized by the name of "visual control" or not, the fact is that replacing text or number with graphics makes a set of information easier to understand with only a glance, making it a more efficient way of communicating a message. It is also commonly used for internal team communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lindlof|first1=Ludvig|last2=Soderberg|first2=Bjorn|title=Pros and cons of lean visual planning: experiences from four product development organisations|journal=International Journal of Technology Intelligence and Planning|date=2011|volume=7|issue=3|pages=269–279|doi=10.1504/IJTIP.2011.044614}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Visual controls are designed to make the control and management of a company as simple as possible. This entails making problems, abnormalities, or deviations from standards visible to everyone. When these deviations are visible and apparent to all, corrective action can be taken to immediately correct these problems.

Visual controls are meant to display the operating or progress status of a given operation in an easy to see format and also to provide instruction and to convey information. A visual control system must have an action component associated with it in the event that the visually represented procedures are not being followed in the real production process. Therefore, visual controls must also have a component where immediate feedback is provided to workers.

== Types ==
There are two groups and seven types of application in visual controls. Displays group and controls group. 
* A visual display group relates information and data to employees in the area. For example, charts showing the monthly revenues of the company or a graphic depicting a certain type of quality issue that group members should be aware of. Large scale, (typically 2x4m) examples of this are known as communications boards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bateman|first1=Nicola|last2=Philp|first2=Lee|last3=Warrender|first3=Harry|date=2016|title=Visual management and shop floor teams–development, implementation and use.|journal=International Journal of Production Research|issue=54(24),|pages=7345–7358.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communication boards are large enough to contain several displays and allow teams of people to view at once.  This supports team decision making and promotes a "shared vision".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/22488262|title=The visual factory : building participation through shared information|last=Michel.|first=Greif,|date=1991|publisher=Productivity Press|isbn=0915299674|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=22488262}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* A visual control group is intended to actually control or guide the action of the group members. Examples of controls are readily apparent in society: stop signs, handicap parking signs, no smoking signs, etc.
