      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20931">The '''AICPA Code of Professional Conduct''' is a collection of codified statements issued by the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] that outline a [[Certified Public Accountant|CPA]]'s ethical and professional responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aicpa.org/Research/Standards/CodeofConduct/Pages/et_50.aspx AICPA Code of Professional Conduct, Section ET 51.02, American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, June 1st, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; The code establishes standards for auditor independence, integrity and objectivity, responsibilities to clients and colleagues and acts discreditable to the accounting profession. The AICPA is responsible for drafting, revising and reissuing the code annually, on June 1. The current Code is available at the [http://www.aicpa.org/RESEARCH/STANDARDS/CODEOFCONDUCT/Pages/default.aspx AICPA] Web site. For older versions of the Code, see the links below.

==History==
[[Joseph Edmund Sterrett]] outlined the debate and issues in setting up a Code of Professional Conduct in his address to the annual meeting of the American Association of Public Accountants in 1907 &lt;ref&gt;[http://clio.lib.olemiss.edu/u?/deloitte,23069 Sterrett, Joseph Edmund. "Professional Ethics. In ''Proceedings of the Annual Meeting at St. Paul, Minn., October Fourteenth--Seventeenth, Nineteen Hundred and Seven.''  American Association of Public Accountants. Pp. 108-133]&lt;/ref&gt;  The earliest "official" version of the code of professional conduct among American accountants was issued by the American Institute of Accountants on April 9, 1917.&lt;ref&gt;[http://clio.lib.olemiss.edu/u?/aicpa,66550 Code of Professional Conduct, American Institute of Accountants, April 9, 1917]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://clio.lib.olemiss.edu/u?/aah,318 Marquette, R. Penny. "Ethics, Professional." In ''History of Accounting: An International Encyclopedia,'' edited by [[Michael Chatfield]] and [[Richard Vangermeersch]]. New York: Garland Publishing, pp. 233-235]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable sections==
===Section 51 - Preamble ===
The opening principle of the code is that membership, and therefore adherence, to the code is voluntary. This means that an accountant is never under a legal responsibility to adhere to the code, and can renounce the code and membership in the AICPA at any time.

===Section 101 - Independence ===
Section 101 sets forth the various requirements to establish auditor independence and conditions that nullify it. Knowingly allowing a member who is not independent to continue to work on an engagement can result in disciplinary action from the AICPA, including possible revocation of the members status as a [[Certified Public Accountant|CPA]]. Generally, the following actions will impair auditor independence:
* Authorizing, executing or consummating a transaction, or otherwise exercising authority on behalf of a client or having the authority to do so.
* Preparing source documents, in electronic or other form, evidencing the occurrence of a transaction.
* Having custody of client assets.
* Supervising client employees in the performance of their normal recurring activities.
* Determining which recommendations of the member should be implemented.
* Reporting to the board of directors on behalf of management.
* Serving as a client's stock transfer or escrow agent, registrar, general counsel or its equivalent.
* Establishing or maintaining internal controls, including performing ongoing monitoring activities.

Auditor independence is impaired if a member on the engagement team has a direct or material indirect financial interest in the client. Member's on the engagement team are not allowed to be on the board of trustees of a trust that owns, or has committed to owning more than 10% of the client's equity. A member or any of their immediate family are not allowed to own more than 5% of the clients equity. For the period being audited, the auditor is not allowed to operate as an officer, director, manager, promoter, underwriter or voting trustee for the client. If a member leaves the auditing firm and is employed by the client, the entire firms independence is deemed to be impaired. If an audit member is made a job offer by the client and does not immediately report and remove themselves from the engagement, their independence is impaired. However, if the member does report the job offer and rejects it, and is no longer being considered for a position with the client, then their independence is not impaired.

When the auditing member has a previous employment relationship with the client, barring certain exceptions, the auditor is required to liquidate any employee welfare programs that they have vested benefits in and collect or pay any loans outstanding to the client. The immediate family of the auditor is considered part of the test for impairment of independence. The exception to this is that the immediate family members of auditors are allowed to work for the client in non-management roles. If the auditor provides non-attest services such as tax support or consulting, they are required to adhere to the independence requirements of other regulatory bodies that govern those services. Failure to do so will impair their independence for their audit engagement as well.

Typically, the levy is 0.1% on non-[[broadcast]] costs (e.g. 0.1% of the cost of placing a [[newspaper]] advertisement), and 0.2% of the cost of a [[Mailsort]] [[contract]]. ASBOF collects the levy and then passes the [[Funding|funds]] on to the ASA to ensure that the ASA are unaware of who has contributed to its funding. This avoids the question of money influencing the ASA's decision in its rulings.

All advertising charges (except [[classified advertising|classified]] [[:wikt:lineage|lineage]] and semi-display) are subject to a 0.1% Advertising Standards Board of Finance (asbof) levy, payable by advertisers to help finance the self-regulatory system administered by the Advertising Standards Authority.

The levy will be collected from advertisers by [[advertising agencies]] or, in case of direct [[account (accountancy)|account]]s, by [[media owner]]s.

In December 2009 after 18 months' consultation with the industry and ASA, it was agreed that the levy would be expanded to include [[paid search]] advertising.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asbof.co.uk/resources/otherdocuments/Asbof_Press_Release_Nov_2009.pdf ASBOF] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301105850/http://www.asbof.co.uk/resources/otherdocuments/Asbof_Press_Release_Nov_2009.pdf |date=March 1, 2012 }} press release.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-governmental organisations ==

=== Regional cooperation ===
As a board member of the ''Yayasan Generasi Amanah'' [[Indonesia]], Azwanddin seeks to uphold cooperation between [[ASEAN]] countries such as [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Singapore]], [[Thailand]] and the [[Philippines]] in welfare activities through regional economic activity embodied&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ww1.utusan.com.my/utusan/info.asp?y=2011&amp;dt=1103&amp;pub=utusan_malaysia&amp;sec=Bicara_Agama&amp;pg=ba_03.htm&amp;arc=hive|title=Perpaduan Islam tanpa batasan geografi|website=Utusan Online|access-date=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Azwanddin is also interested in the arts, particularly in upholding [[Malay language|Malay]] performing arts through his involvement as the vice chairman of Yayasan Nusantara&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

=== Anti-corruption stance ===
Through many capacities, Azwanddin is a firm believer of honesty and integrity in work and continually expresses his stance against corruption issues&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2017/12/314504/jmm-alleges-financial-irregularities-tmi|title=JMM alleges financial irregularities in TMI|date=2017-12-14|work=NST Online|access-date=2018-02-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/group-wants-macc-to-probe-portal-over-alleged-rm3m-cash-takes|title=Group wants MACC to probe portal over alleged RM3m cash takes|date=2017-12-15|access-date=2018-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.therakyatpost.com/news/2015/07/14/its-all-in-public-domain-mokhzani-tells-jmm/|title=It's all in public domain, Mokhzani tells JMM - The Rakyat Post|date=2015-07-14|work=The Rakyat Post|access-date=2018-02-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Malaysia.

Currently, Azwanddin feels that his efforts to fight corruption are best channeled through his capacity as Chairman of MyAduan Rasuah JMM (officiated by Tan Sri Dzulkifli Ahmad)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.utusan.com.my/berita/nasional/my-aduan-rasuah-jmm-dilancar-1.506646|title=My Aduan Rasuah JMM dilancarkan|last=|first=|date=24 July 2017|work=Utusan Malaysia|access-date=14 February 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bharian.com.my/berita/nasional/2017/07/305037/ogos-september-bulan-panas-sprm|title=Ogos, September bulan panas - SPRM|date=2017-07-23|work=BH Online|access-date=2018-02-14|language=ms}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Jaringan Melayu Malaysia (JMM) ===
Azwanddin is the founder of [[:ms:Jaringan_Melayu_Malaysia|Jaringan Melayu Malaysia (JMM)]] in 2008. JMM is a non-governmental organisation that aims to promote racial harmony and unity through upholding the constitutional rights of Malays as well as the rights of other races in Malaysia. In particular, JMM strives to fight any foreign elements that have the potential to disrupt the racial harmony and unity in Malaysia. JMM also aims to uphold the integrity and leadership of professionals in managing the country’s assets. 

Prior to 2011, JMM had struggled to find relevance in the current Malaysian political and socio-economic climate and it was through the extraordinary efforts of Azwanddin that key issues promoted by JMM such as the anti-corruption stance, received prominence in the Malaysian sphere. 

JMM began to receive significant public and media attention due to its anti-[[LGBT|LGBTQ]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sinarharian.com.my/nasional/jmm-ketuai-ngo-melayu-protes-lgbt-di-upm-1.41894|title=JMM ketuai NGO Melayu protes LGBT di UPM|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mstar.com.my/berita/berita-semasa/2011/11/26/jaringan-melayu-malaysia-terus-bantah-program-seksualiti-merdeka/|title=Jaringan Melayu Malaysia Terus Bantah Program Seksualiti Merdeka - Berita Semasa - mStar|website=www.mstar.com.my}}&lt;/ref&gt; stance since 2011. As a devout Muslim and the president of JMM, Azwanddin voiced his concerns on the influence of LGBTQ in youth, the rise of HIV diagnosis among these communities and the resulting breakdown of marriages due to one partner being a closeted gay or lesbian. Of course, these views do not resonate with the current Malaysian and global liberal views on sexuality and JMM’s stance on LGBTQ remains a controversy to these parties&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.malaysia-today.net/2012/04/17/stop-the-hatred-towards-lgbt-communities/|title=Stop the hatred towards LGBT communities – Malaysia Today|last=Webmaster|first=MT|website=www.malaysia-today.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Cerebral Palsy ===
[[Cerebral palsy]] is close to Azwanddin's heart as one of his sons suffers from this condition&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.utusan.com.my/gaya-hidup/keluarga/demi-amer-deedat-1.489248|title=Demi Amer Deedat|last=Termizi|first=Amizul Tunizar Ahmad|work=Utusan Online|access-date=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As a member of the Family Support Group of Cerebral Palsy at [[Kuala Lumpur Hospital]], Azwanddin provides his whole-support towards the cause&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

=== Youth Empowerment ===
Azwanddin believes that youth is important for the Malaysia's development and in 2017, he became the patron of [http://www.rojak-united.com/ Rojak United] - a [[Volunteering|voluntary]] [[youth]] engagement and data-driven entity focusing on apolitical civic issues concerning youth.

== Awards ==
Azwanddin was awarded with ''Darjah Indera Mahkota'' which carried a ''Datoship'' title from the [[Sultan of Pahang]] in October 2016 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utusan.com.my/berita/nasional/613-terima-darjah-kebesaran-sultan-pahang-1.398755 "613 terima darjah kebesaran Sultan Pahang"]&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2018, he was conferred the Malaysian Civil Defence Force (APM) Honorary Colonel Award &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utusan.com.my/berita/nasional/video-azwanddin-terima-pangkat-kolonel-kehormat-pertahanan-awam-1.596295 "Azwanddin terima pangkat Kolonel Kehormat Pertahanan Awam"]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13430">'''Build–operate–transfer''' ('''BOT''') or '''build–own–operate–transfer''' ('''BOOT''') is a form of project financing, wherein a private entity receives a [[concession (contract)|concession]] from the private or [[public sector]] to finance, design, construct, own, and operate a facility stated in the concession contract. This enables the project proponent to recover its investment, operating and maintenance expenses in the project.

Due to the long-term nature of the arrangement, the fees are usually raised during the concession period. The rate of increase is often tied to a combination of internal and external variables, allowing the proponent to reach a satisfactory [[internal rate of return]] for its investment.

Examples of countries using BOT are [[Pakistan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term used is build–own–operate–transfer (BOOT).
The first BOT was for the China Hotel, built in 1979 by the Hong Kong listed conglomerate [[Hopewell Holdings Ltd]] (controlled by Sir [[Gordon Wu]]).

Forms of [[project finance]] are listed in the sections below.

==BOT (build–operate–transfer)==

BOT finds extensive application in infrastructure projects and in [[public–private partnership]]. In the BOT framework a third party, for example the public administration, delegates to a private sector entity to design and build infrastructure and to operate and maintain these facilities for a certain period. During this period the private party has the responsibility to raise the finance for the project and is entitled to retain all revenues generated by the project and is the owner of the regarded facilities. The facility will be then transferred to the public administration at the end of the [[concession (contract)|concession agreement]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = BOT - PPP in Infrastructure Resource Center|  url =http://pppirc.worldbank.org/public-private-partnership/agreements/concessions-bots-dbos|publisher=World Bank|date=March 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; without any remuneration of the private entity involved. 
Some or even all of the following different parties could be involved in any BOT project:
*The host government: Normally, the government is the initiator of the infrastructure project and decides if the BOT model is appropriate to meet its needs. In addition, the political and economic circumstances are main factors for this decision. The government provides normally support for the project in some form. (provision of the land/ changed [[laws]])
*The concessionaire: The project sponsors who act as concessionaire create a special purpose entity which is capitalised through their financial contributions.
*Lending banks: Most BOT project are funded to a big extent by commercial debt. The bank will be expected to finance the project on "non-recourse" basis meaning that it has recourse to the special purpose entity and all its assets for the repayment of the debt.
*Other lenders: The special purpose entity might have other lenders such as national or regional development banks
*Parties to the project contracts: Because the [[special purpose entity]] has only limited workforce, it will [[subcontract]] a third party to perform its obligations under the concession agreement. Additionally, it has to assure that it has adequate supply contracts in place for the supply of raw materials and other resources necessary for the project
[[File:BOT photo.jpg|thumb|BOT model]]
A BOT Project (build operate transfer project) is typically used to develop a discrete asset rather than a whole network and is generally entirely new or greenfield in nature (although refurbishment may be involved). In a BOT Project the project company or operator generally obtains its revenues through a fee charged to the utility/ government rather than tariffs charged to consumers. A number of projects are called concessions, such as toll road projects, which are new build and have a number of similarities to BOTs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =BOT - PPP in Infrastructure Resource Center|  url =http://pppirc.worldbank.org/public-private-partnership/agreements/concessions-bots-dbos|publisher=World Bank|date=March 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
In general, a project is financially viable for the private entity if the revenues generated by the project cover its [[cost]] and provide sufficient [[return on investment]]. On the other hand, the viability of the project for the host government depends on its efficiency in comparison with the economics of financing the project with public funds. Even if the host government could borrow money on better conditions than a private company could, other factors could offset this particular advantage. For example, the expertise and efficiency that the private entity is expected to bring as well as the [[risk transfer]]. Therefore, the private entity bears a substantial part of the risk. These are some types of the most common risks involved: 
*[[Political risk]]: especially in the developing countries because of the possibility of dramatic overnight political change.
*Technical risk: construction difficulties, for example unforeseen soil conditions, breakdown of equipment
*Financing risk: foreign exchange rate risk and interest rate fluctuation, [[market risk]] (change in the price of raw materials), income risk (over-optimistic cash-flow forecasts), cost overrun risk&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Walker, Smith|first=Adrian Charles|title=Privatized infrastructure: the build operate transfer approach|year=1995|publisher=Thomas Telford|isbn=978-0-7277-2053-5|pages=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilde Sapte LLP|first=Denton|title=Public Private Partnerships: Bot Techniques and Project Finance|year=2006|publisher=Euromoney Books|location=London|isbn=978-1-84374-275-3|pages=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mishra|first=R.C.|title=Modern Project Management|year=2006|publisher=New Age International|isbn=978-81-224-1616-9|pages=234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==BOOT (build–own–operate–transfer)==

A BOOT structure differs from BOT in that the private entity owns the works. During the concession period the private company owns and operates the facility with the prime goal to recover the costs of investment and maintenance while trying to achieve higher margin on project. The specific characteristics of BOOT make it suitable for infrastructure projects like highways, roads mass transit, railway transport and power generation and as such they have political importance for the social welfare but are not attractive for other types of private investments. BOOT &amp; BOT are methods which find very extensive application in countries which desire ownership transfer and operations including. Some advantages of BOOT projects are: 
*Encourage private investment
*Inject new foreign capital to the country
*Transfer of technology and know-how
*Completing project within time frame and planned budget
*Providing additional financial source for other priority projects
*Releasing the burden on public budget for infrastructure development&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gatti|first=Stafano|title=Project Finance in theory and practice|year=2007|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-373699-4|pages=414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==BOO (build–own–operate)==

&lt;!-- Build Own Operate redirects here --&gt;
In a BOO project ownership of the project remains usually with the project company for example a [[mobile phone network]]. Therefore, the private company gets the benefits of any [[residual value]] of the project. This framework is used when the physical life of the project coincides with the concession period. A BOO scheme involves large amounts of finance and long [[payback period]]. Some examples of BOO projects come from the water treatment plants. This facilities run by private companies process raw water, provided by the public sector entity, into filtered water, which is after returned to the public sector utility to deliver to the customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis/ Grimsey|first=Mervyn/Darrin|title=Public Private Partnerships: the worldwide revolution in infrastructure provision and project finance|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-1-84720-226-0|pages=268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==BLT (build–lease–transfer)==

Under BLT a private entity builds a complete project and leases it to the government. On this way the control over the project is transferred from the project owner to a lessee. In other words, the ownership remains by the [[shareholders]] but operation purposes are leased. After the expiry of the [[leasing]] the ownership of the asset and the operational responsibility are transferred to the government at a previously agreed price. For foreign investors taking into account the [[country risk]] BLT provides good conditions because the project company maintains the [[property rights]] while avoiding [[operational risk]].

==DBFO (design–build–finance–operate)==

Design–build–finance–operate is a project delivery method very similar to BOOT except that there is no actual ownership transfer. Moreover, the contractor assumes the risk of financing till the end of the contract period. The owner then assumes the responsibility for maintenance and operation. Some disadvantages of DBFO are the difficulty with long term relationships and the threat of possible future political changes which may not agree with prior commitments.This model is extensively used in specific infrastructure projects such as [[toll roads]]. The private construction company is responsible for the design and construction of a piece of infrastructure for the government, which is the true owner. Moreover, the private entity has the responsibility to raise finance during the construction and the exploitation period. The [[cash flows]] serve to repay the investment and reward its shareholders. They end up in form of periodical payment to the government for the use of the infrastructure. The government has the advantage that it remains the owner of the facility and at the same time avoids direct payment from the users. Additionally, the government succeeds to avoid getting into [[debt]] and to spread out the cost for the road over the years of exploitation.&lt;ref name="http://www-esd.worldbank.org/pbc_resource_guide/Docs-latest%20edition/cases-and-pdfs/pakkalae5.pdf"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pekka|first=Pakkala|title=Innovative Project Delivery Methods for Infrastructure|year=2002|publisher=Finnish Road Enterprise|isbn=978-952-5408-05-8|pages=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==DBOT (design–build–operate–transfer)==
This funding option is common when the client has no knowledge of what the project entails. Hence he contracts the project to a company to design, build, operate and then transfer it. Examples of such projects are refinery constructions. 
&lt;ref&gt;Design-Build-Approacheshttp://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report_worli-haji-ali-sea-link-will-be-ready-in-4-years_1402669&lt;/ref&gt;

==DCMF (design–construct–manage–finance)==
Some examples for the DCMF model are the prisons or the public hospitals. A private entity is built to design, construct, manage, and finance a facility, based on the specifications of the government. Project cash flows result from the government's payment for the rent of the facility. In the case of the hospitals, the government has the ownership over the facility and has the price and [[quality control]]. The same [[financial model]] could be applied on other projects such as prisons. Therefore, this model could be interpreted as a mean to avoid new indebtedness of [[public finance]].

A '''buyer''' is any person who [[contracts]] to acquire an [[asset]] in return for some form of [[consideration]].

When someone gets characterized by their role as a buyer of certain assets, the term "buyer" gets new meaning. For example, a "buyer" is a person who purchases finished goods, typically for resale, for a firm, government, or organization; while a person who purchases material used to make goods is sometimes called a [[purchasing agent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/business-and-financial/purchasing-managers-buyers-and-purchasing-agents.htm |title=Purchasing Managers, Buyers, and Purchasing Agents |publisher=U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics |date=29 March 2012 |archive-date=2012-04-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401201256/http://www.bls.gov/ooh/Business-and-Financial/Purchasing-managers-buyers-and-purchasing-agents.htm |access-date=7 September 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[product management]], the buyer is the entity that decides to obtain the product. A buyer's primary responsibility is obtaining the highest quality goods at the lowest cost. This usually requires research, writing requests for bids, proposals or quotes, and evaluating information received.

'''''Chris Sawyer's Locomotion''''' is a [[video game]] by [[Independent video game developer|independent]] [[video game developer|game developer]] [[Chris Sawyer|Chris Sawyer Productions]] from 2004. According to Sawyer, it is the "spiritual successor to ''[[Transport Tycoon]]''".

==Gameplay==
The game allows the player to use [[Rail transport|railroads]], [[tram]]s, [[truck|trucking lines]], [[buses]], [[airplanes]] and [[ships]] to earn money in a [[transport]] company between the years 1900 to 2100. It contains over 40 pre-designed scenarios and a scenario editor, and can also be played in multiplayer mode with another human-controlled competitor. The game is played in an 2D [[Isometric projection|isometric]] view like the other games by Chris Sawyer, particularly ''[[RollerCoaster Tycoon (video game)|RollerCoaster Tycoon]]'', which uses the [[Game engine|engine]] that was originally developed for ''[[Transport Tycoon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Gamespot Staff|title=RollerCoaster Tycoon designer offers first details on new title|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/2004/04/02/news_6092788.html|website=GameSpot|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007050504/http://www.gamespot.com/news/2004/04/02/news_6092788.html|archivedate=7 Oct 2009|format=Interview|date=2 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scenarios have five difficulty levels: Beginner, Easy, Medium, Challenging and Expert. Different objectives are available, some require the player to finish on a certain position in the company ranking list while others require the transportation of a specific amount of cargo. In some cases these objectives have additional limits, such as that the player must finish within a certain time limit. While many of the scenarios are fictional, some are based on real-world countries such as the United States, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.

In recent years, several add-ons have been created for the game, including hundreds of trains, trucks, airplanes and other vehicles. Some people have used special programs to convert [[Microsoft Train Simulator]] rolling stock for use in Locomotion.

==Development==
''Locomotion'' was developed by [[video game developer|game developer]] [[Chris Sawyer]] as "spiritual successor to ''[[Transport Tycoon]]''". The game was published and released by [[Atari]] in the U.S. on September 7, 2004 and a few days later in the rest of the world.

In 2013 an [[iOS]] version of ''Transport Tycoon''was released that uses the graphics from ''Locomotion''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/management-geeks-rejoice-as-transport-tycoon-arrives-on-ios/|title=Transport Tycoon Review: Infrastructure Has Never Been So Fun|last=Brookes|first=Tim|date=14 October 2013|work=[[MakeUseOf]]|accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 17 2015, the game was re-released through [[digital distribution]] on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] and [[gog.com]].

In January 2018, an [[Open-source software development|open-source]] project, based on ''OpenRCT2'' engine known as ''OpenLoco'', was launched to enhance the gameplay of ''Locomotion'', including fixing [[Software bug|bugs]], translating to more languages and allowing the game to run natively on [[macOS]] and [[Linux]]. In order to create an accurate [[Clone (computing)|clone]], the incrementally [[reverse engineer]]ed [[RollerCoaster_Tycoon_2|Roller Coaster Tycoon 2]] engine was used. OpenLoco features reduced limitations compared to the original, i.e disabling vehicle breakdowns, unlocked building options or using custom resolutions.

==Reception==

Reviews of the game were generally not favorable, with many noting that the game's [[user interface]] and [[artificial intelligence|AI]] were both poor in comparison to the original ''Transport Tycoon''.

'''Commercial Intelligence''' is the highest and most comprehensive form of legal, ethical [[open-source intelligence]] as practiced by diverse international and localized businesses.
'''Business intelligence''' is a mis-nomer for data mining and enterprise dashboards that present useful patterns or distillations of internal information to the executive.

==What is Commercial Intelligence?==
Commercial Intelligence (CI) is the process of defining, gathering, analyzing and distributing accurate and relevant intelligence regarding the products, customers, competitors, business environment and the organization itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commercial Intelligence (CI)|url=https://www.kbmanage.com/concept/commercial-intelligence|website=www.kbmanage.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This methodical program affects the organization’s tactics, decisions and operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kahaner|first1=Larry|title=Competitive Intelligence: How to Gather, Analyze, and Use Information to Move Your Business to the Top|date=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Who uses Commercial Intelligence?==
A 1998 study by the Futures Group, a Glastonbury, Connecticut-based consulting firm indicates that 82% of companies with annual revenues exceeding $10 billion and 60% of those with annual revenues exceeding $1 billion now have an organized intelligence system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Stephan H.|last2=Bentley|first2=Samuel|journal=Competitive Intelligence Magazine|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; While most larger companies have specific departments devoted to Commercial Intelligence, mid-sized companies tend to hire Commercial Intelligence firms, and smaller business owners are more likely to do it themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miller|first1=Stephen H.|title=Competitive Intelligence -- An Overview|url=http://www.ventes-marketing.com/References/Intelligence%20concurrentielle/Articles/CI%20Overview.pdf|website=www.ventes-marketing.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==What Commercial Intelligence Could We Use?==
Commercial Intelligence can be obtained and analysed in various ways that include:
* Information on a supplier’s financial performance
* Political developments
* Economic indicators
* New product development
* Currency market movements
* Competitor performance
* New market entrants &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commercial Intelligence|url=https://www.cips.org/Documents/Resources/Knowledge%20Now/Commercial%20Intelligence.pdf|website=www.cips.org|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Primary Vs Secondary Intelligence==

===Primary Sources of Intelligence===
Primary sources of CI include:
* Speeches by executive managers concerning future strategies and tactics of the company and company literature shared at trade shows, conferences and other events.
* All forms of communication mediums such as TV, Radio, Business magazines, etc.
* Annual reports.
* Physical observations of activities.
* Conversations with internal sources known to be knowledgeable about the competitor's operations and decision making
* Conversation with ex-company employees
* Conversations with consultants or agencies of the company

===Secondary Sources of Intelligence===
Secondary sources of CI include:
* Articles and reviews created by someone outside the company concerning the company.
* Books about the company and/or the companies in the industry.
* Special studies, research papers and analyst reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collecting Competitive Intelligence|url=http://www.exinfm.com/board/collecting_competitive_intelligence.htm|website=www.exinfm.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intelligence from both classifications can be found within the scope of open source intelligence (OSINT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Levy|first1=Joe|title=Primary Intelligence vs Secondary Intelligence|url=http://www.clearci.com/blog/bid/103774/Primary-Intelligence-vs-Secondary-Intelligence|website=www.clearci.com|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Commercial Intelligence Cycle==
Efficient and successful CI is a constant cycle that consists of 5 steps:
# '''Planning'''; deliberating with decision makers to discover their intelligence needs.
# '''Gathering'''; collecting activities that are conducted legally and ethically.
# '''Analysis'''; interpreting all the information gathered and assembling the suggested actions.
# '''Dissemination'''; presenting the findings to the decision makers
# '''Feedback'''; studying the decision makers’ responses and understanding their need for continued intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herring|first1=Jan P.|title=What Is Intelligence Analysis?|journal=Competitive Intelligence Magazine|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics in Commercial Intelligence==

===Ethical Challenges===

====''Misrepresentation''====
Misrepresentation in CI is a form of cyber engineering. It is the act of falsely identifying yourself and bluffing people into giving you information they probably would not have had your true identity been provided. In fact, misrepresentation is the most common issue that subdivides numerous CI practitioners in many unclear ethical issues. The most common types of misrepresentation include:
# Excluding specific details in one’s identity: Lying about one’s identity in order to gain access to certain information is known to be unethical amongst CI practitioners. However, there is a thin line between lying about one’s identity and omitting certain details about it. Some practitioners believe that it is acceptable to deliberately skip over some details to obtain information. For example: Person X is both a part-time student as well as a director to a large company. As part of a school assignment, X is expected to collect information about a company that just so happens to be one of X’s employer’s biggest competitors. In this case, it is believed by some CI practitioners that not revealing the fact that X works for the company in addition to being a part-time student is completely ethical. In other words, X is misleading the competitor into thinking the information given to him will be used to complete a school assignment and nothing more, although in reality he would be gathering commercial intelligence to present to his employer. However, these types of situations raise some ethical concerns because the competitor may not have provided certain information knowing X works for a direct competitor. The competitor was not lied to, but deliberately misled in order to give out specific information about the company.
# Overhearing classified information: Some CI practitioners believe that if you overhear a competitor’s conversation in a public venue, then the information discussed that was previously classified becomes ethical for you to use to your advantage. They believe that it is not necessary to reveal their identity since the conversation occurred in an open and public place, and it is in fact the competitors’ fault that their information has been leaked because they should have been more aware or their surroundings and been more secure with their information. On the other hand, some argue that the CI practitioners are at fault because they deliberately planned on being in those surroundings in hopes to overhear some information, which raises concerns on the ethics of the matter.
# Not Disclosing true intent on how information will be used: Many CI practitioners are paid by their clients to get as much information about their competitors. In order to do so, they would survey the competitors and suggest to them that they are simply collecting industry information, all the while not revealing who they are working for, thus, not disclosing the true intent on how the information gathered is going to be used.
All 3 misrepresentation issues share a common theme, which is: “What is the intent of the CI practitioner?”. Judging by a person’s intent, we can conclude whether or not the situation is ethical or non-ethical.

====''Client Conflict''====
Client conflict means any situation in which a practitioner is faced with a conflict of interest between a former and current client. The practitioner must attempt to determine how to act in the best interests of several clients in the same or substantially related matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stevens|first1=Sylvia|title=Former Client Conflicts|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of situation usually arises with CI practitioners who are consultants. However, a clear solution is obvious; the practitioners agree that they should never service competing clients at the same time in order to keep classified information secure. In addition, another conflict may arise in the CI consultant and client relationship. The client usually hires the consultant to gather as much information about their competitors. However, there is an ethical issue concerning the length in which a consultant would go in order to retrieve the required information; how much is too much? When the consultant ignores the cost at which they are seeking this information, they tend to stumble upon various ethical issues, and it is in fact these ethical issues which the clients don’t want to be associated with that push them to hiring a CI consultant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trevino|first1=Linda|last2=Weaver|first2=Gary|title=Ethical Issues in Competitive Intelligence Practice: Consensus, Conflicts, and Challenges|journal=Competitive Intelligence Review|date=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cases of Organizations accused of Unethical CI Practices===

====''[[Oracle Corporation]]''====
In 2000, Oracle Corporation hired a detective agency to investigate two research groups that supported [[Microsoft]] during the antitrust trial. After attempting to buy garbage, the agency discovered that those two research groups were falsely identifying themselves as independent advocacy groups when they were in reality funded by Microsoft. Oracle and the hired detective agency may have acted in questionable matters to obtain that information, but they believe that the outcome justifies their actions. [[Larry Ellison]], Oracle’s chairman, says: “I feel very good about what we did. […] Maybe our investigation organization may have done things unsavoury, but it's not illegal. We got the truth out.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wong|first1=Wylie|title=Oracle chief defends Microsoft snooping|url=http://www.cnet.com/search/?query=Oracle+chief+defends+Microsoft+snooping|website=www.cnet.com|date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''[[WestJet]]''====
In May 2004, [[Air Canada]] filed a $5 million corporate-espionage lawsuit against WestJet after discovering that their rival had hacked into Air Canada’s internal employee-only website over 243,000 times in a period of 10 months. WestJet used the confidential information it found to rearrange its load schedules as well as adjust routes and it significantly reduced service from the Hamilton airport and increased service in Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Teel|first1=Gina|title=Founding member to depart from WestJet|date=2007|url=http://www.calgaryherald.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; WestJet later issued a rare apology to its rival and [[Robert Milton]], the chief executive of parent [[ACE Aviation Holdings|ACE Aviation Holdings Inc]], admitting that its actions of online snooping "were both unethical and unacceptable" and ended paying AirCanada $15.5-million in legal fees as well as donating $10-million to children's charities in the names of both airlines. Moreover, Hill, one of the founders of WestJet later resigned from his position as vice-president of strategic planning in July 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=6138fbd4-c3db-44ca-83a7-bfb6bcc0cbdb|title=WestJet apologizes to Air Canada for snooping|last1=Ratner|first1=Jonathan|date=2006|website=www.canada.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304214910/http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=6138fbd4-c3db-44ca-83a7-bfb6bcc0cbdb|archive-date=4 March 2016|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''[[Hewlett-Packard]]''====
In 2005, HP filed a lawsuit against its former VP, [[Karl-Heinz Kamp|Karl Kamp]], for $100 million, claiming Kamp had betrayed the company and appropriated its trade secrets as well as its money to start up his own flat-panel-TV company, as he was working on the TV project for HP. In January 2007. Kamb filed a countersuit. Not only did he deny stealing trade secrets but also claimed that HP was aware of what he had done with its money. He claimed that HP had asked him to gather classified information on [[Dell]], whose entry into printers had threatened HP's most profitable line of business. In 2002, the CI unit hired Katsumi Iizuka, former president of Dell Japan until 1995, sold HP information on Dell’s plans to enter the printer business. The information they gathered revolved around printer models, specifications, terms and prices, many months before their launch. Further more, HP was accused of pretexting, which is the act of lying about one's identity to obtain privileged data and information, in order to obtain Kamb’s private phone records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Varchaver|first1=Nicholas|title=A pretext for revenge|url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/06/11/100060613/index.htm?postversion=2007053113|website=www.fortune.com|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals==

===Historic Development===
The Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals is one of the only global membership organizations in the rapidly growing field of competitive intelligence and business strategy. SCIP is a global not-for-profit association whose 7,000 members conduct competitor research and analysis for large and small companies, and help manage planning competitive strategy. Established in 1986 in Washington DC, it is currently headquartered in Alexandria, Virginia. It focuses on enhancing the success of its members through education, leadership, support and networking. Since 1986, SCIP has developed drastically and globally, and has, today, chapters all around the world as well as alliance partnerships with numerous independent affiliate organis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Strategy, Market &amp; Ccompetitive Intelligence|url=https://www.scip.org/|website=www.scip.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; ations. On July 8, 2010 the SCIP Board of Directors voted to officially change the 25-year-old non-profit organisation's name from "Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals" to "Strategic and Competitive Intelligence Professionals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alexandria|first1=Va|title=SCIP Changes Name to Strategic and Competitive Intelligence Professionals|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/scip-changes-name-to-strategic-and-competitive-intelligence-professionals-100524874.html|website=www.prnewswire.com|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chapters Overview===
SCIP Chapters are the best way for members to build relationships within the competitive intelligence discipline in their area. Its event are open for anyone to attend, become involved, and enjoy the benefits of programming and networking. The SCIP offers many opportunities to its members including exceptional educational and networking experiences with leading industry experts, as well as opportunities to increase knowledge by gaining access to rare and distinctive practices, tools and publications. In addition, the SCIP offers Collegiate Chapters for students who show interest in the world of commercial and competitive intelligence. Participant students in the Collegiate Chapter are offered training and education programs that represent unique opportunities for professional advancement. They are also benefitting exceptionally in terms of leadership skills, career development and indispensable CI know-how. Also, the SCIP awards mentoring programs and scholarships to students who deem prominent, promising and capable business students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SCIP Chapter Overview|url=https://www.scip.org/ChaptersOverview.php|website=www.scip.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics===
Economic espionage represents a failure of Commercial Intelligence, which uses open sources and other forms of ethical inquiry. Importantly, SCIP mandates that all this be done within a strictly ethical framework, which is why it has agreed upon a code of ethics;
* To continually strive to increase the recognition and respect of the profession.
* To comply with all applicable laws, domestic and international.
* To accurately disclose all relevant information, including one's identity and organization, prior to all interviews.
* To avoid conflicts of interest in fulfilling one's duties.
* To provide honest and realistic recommendations and conclusions in the execution of one's duties.
* To promote this code of ethics within one's company, with third-party contractors and within the entire profession.
* To faithfully adhere to and abide by one's company policies, objectives and guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SCIP Code of Ethics for CI Professionals|url=https://www.scip.org/CodeOfEthics.php|website=www.scip.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="911">In [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and [[Scots Law]], a '''commodate''' (''commodatum'') is a gratuitous [[loan]]; a loan, or free concession of anything [[Personal property|moveable]] or immoveable, for a certain timeframe, on condition of restoring again the same individual after a certain time.

It is a kind of loan, or [[contract]], with one difference: the commodate is ''[[wikt:gratis|gratis]]'', and does not transfer the property; the thing must be returned in essence, and without deterioration, so that things which consume by use, or time, cannot be objects of a commodate, but of a loan, because although they may be returned in kind, they cannot in identity.

'''Competition law theory''' covers the strands of thought relating to [[competition law]] or antitrust policy.

==Classical perspective==
{{see also|Classical economics}}
[[File:John-stuart-mill-sized.jpg|right|thumb|[[John Stuart Mill]] believed the [[restraint of trade]] doctrine was justified to preserve [[liberty]] and [[competition]]]]
The classical perspective on competition was that certain agreements and business practice could be an unreasonable restraint on the [[individual liberty]] of tradespeople to carry on their livelihoods. Restraints were judged as permissible or not by courts as new cases appeared and in the light of changing business circumstances. Hence the courts found specific categories of agreement, specific clauses, to fall foul of their doctrine on economic fairness, and they did not contrive an overarching conception of market power. Earlier theorists like Adam Smith rejected any monopoly power on this basis.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"A monopoly granted either to an individual or to a trading company has the same effect as a secret in trade or manufactures. The monopolists, by keeping the market constantly under-stocked, by never fully supplying the effectual demand, sell their commodities much above the natural price, and raise their emoluments, whether they consist in wages or profit, greatly above their natural rate."&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1776) Book I, Chapter 7, para 26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' (1776) [[Adam Smith]] also pointed out the cartel problem, but did not advocate legal measures to combat them.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices. It is impossible indeed to prevent such meetings, by any law which either could be executed, or would be consistent with liberty and justice. But though the law cannot hinder people of the same trade from sometimes assembling together, it ought to do nothing to facilitate such assemblies; much less to render them necessary."&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1776) [http://www.econlib.org/library/Smith/smWN4.html#B.I,%20Ch.10,%20Of%20Wages%20and%20Profit%20in%20the%20Different%20Employments%20of%20Labour%20and%20Stock Book I, Chapter 10], para 82&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Smith also rejected the very existence of, not just dominant and abusive corporations, but [[corporation]]s at all.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1776) Book V, Chapter 1, para 107&lt;/ref&gt;

By the latter half of the nineteenth century it had become clear that large firms had become a fact of the market economy. [[John Stuart Mill]]'s approach was laid down in his treatise ''[[On Liberty]]'' (1859).

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Again, trade is a social act. Whoever undertakes to sell any description of goods to the public, does what affects the interest of other persons, and of society in general; and thus his conduct, in principle, comes within the jurisdiction of society... both the cheapness and the good quality of commodities are most effectually provided for by leaving the producers and sellers perfectly free, under the sole check of equal freedom to the buyers for supplying themselves elsewhere. This is the so-called doctrine of Free Trade, which rests on grounds different from, though equally solid with, the principle of individual liberty asserted in this Essay. Restrictions on trade, or on production for purposes of trade, are indeed restraints; and all restraint, qua restraint, is an evil..."&lt;ref&gt;Mill (1859) Chapter V, para 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The use of the word "society" to mean the state, and the false claim that because a "social act" effects the "interest" of other persons it comes under the "jurisdiction" of the state, even if the act is entirely voluntary (i.e. an act of Free Will, agency, for both parties in the exchange). Liberty in commercial matters (in the voluntary buying and selling of goods and services) is not some different "principle" to liberty generally - it is clearly the same principle.

==Neo-classical synthesis==
{{see also|Neo-classical economics}}
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:1schumpeter.jpg|right|thumb|[[Joseph Schumpeter]] argued competition drove the progress of capitalist democracies]] --&gt;
After Mill, there was a shift in economic theory, which emphasised a more precise and theoretical model of competition. A simple neo-classical model of free markets holds that production and distribution of goods and services in competitive free markets maximizes [[social welfare]]. This model assumes that new firms can freely enter markets and compete with existing firms, or to use legal language, there are no [[barriers to entry]]. By this term economists mean something very specific, that competitive free markets deliver [[allocative efficiency|allocative]], [[productive efficiency|productive]] and dynamic efficiency. Allocative efficiency is also known as [[Pareto efficiency]] after the Italian economist [[Vilfredo Pareto]] and means that resources in an economy over the [[long run]] will go precisely to those who are [[Consumerism|willing]] and [[Poverty|able]] to pay for them. Because rational producers will keep producing and selling, and buyers will keep buying up to the last [[Marginalism|marginal unit]] of possible output - or alternatively rational producers will be reduce their output to the margin at which buyers will buy the same amount as produced - there is no waste, the greatest number wants of the greatest number of people become satisfied and [[Utilitarianism|utility]] is perfected because resources can no longer be reallocated to make anyone better off without making someone else worse off; society has achieved allocative efficiency.  Productive efficiency simply means that society is making as much as it can. Free markets are meant to reward those who [[Protestant work ethic|work hard]], and therefore those who will put society's resources towards the [[Production possibility frontier|frontier of its possible production]].&lt;ref&gt;for one of the opposite views, see [[Kenneth Galbraith]], ''[[The New Industrial State]]'' (1967)&lt;/ref&gt; Dynamic efficiency refers to the idea that business which constantly competes must research, create and innovate to keep its share of consumers. This traces to Austrian-American political scientist [[Joseph Schumpeter]]'s notion that a "perennial gale of creative destruction" is ever sweeping through [[capitalism|capitalist]] economies, driving enterprise at the market's mercy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Schumpeter]], ''The Process of Creative Destruction'' (1942)&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrasting with the allocatively, productively and dynamically efficient market model are monopolies, oligopolies, and cartels. When only one or a few firms exist in the market, and there is no credible threat of the entry of competing firms, prices raise above the competitive level, to either a monopolistic or oligopolistic equilibrium price. Production is also decreased, further decreasing [[social welfare]] by creating a [[deadweight loss]]. Sources of this market power are said to include the existence of [[externalities]], [[barriers to entry]] of the market, and the [[free rider problem]]. Markets may [[market failure|fail]] to be efficient for a variety of reasons, so the exception of competition law's intervention to the rule of ''[[laissez faire]]'' is justified. Orthodox economists fully acknowledge that [[perfect competition]] is seldom observed in the real world, and so aim for what is called "workable" or "[[effective competition]]".&lt;ref&gt;Whish (2003) p.14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark, "Towards a Concept of Workable Competition" (1940) 30 Am Ec Rev p.241-256&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Markham, "An Alternative Approach to the Concept of Workable Competition" (1950) 40 Am Ec Rev p.349-361&lt;/ref&gt; This follows the theory that if one cannot achieve the ideal, then go for the second best option&lt;ref&gt;c.f. Lipsey and Lancaster, "The General Theory of Second Best" (1956-7) 24 Rev Ec Stud 11-32&lt;/ref&gt; by using the law to tame market operation where it can.

==Chicago School==
{{see also|Chicago School (economics)}}
[[File:Robert Bork.jpg|thumb|Robert Bork|right|[[Robert Bork]] argued that competition law was fundamentally flawed]]
A group of economists and lawyers, who are largely associated with the [[University of Chicago]], advocate an approach to competition law guided by the proposition that some actions that were originally considered to be anticompetitive could actually promote competition. The [[US Supreme Court]] has used the Chicago School approach in several recent cases.&lt;ref&gt;''Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc.'', 433 U.S. 36 (1977), ''Broadcast Music Inc. v.

[[Robert Bork]] was highly critical of court decisions on United States antitrust law in a series of law review articles and his book ''[[The Antitrust Paradox]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Bork, Robert H. ''The Antitrust Paradox'' (1978)  New York Free Press {{ISBN|0-465-00369-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bork argued that both the original intention of antitrust laws and economic efficiency was pursuit ''only'' of consumer welfare, the protection of competition rather than competitors.&lt;ref name="Bork 1978 p.405"&gt;Bork (1978) p.405&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, only a few acts should be prohibited, namely cartels that fix prices and divide markets, mergers that create monopolies, and dominant firms pricing predatorily, while allowing such practices as vertical agreements and [[price discrimination]] on the grounds that it did not harm consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Bork (1978) p.406&lt;/ref&gt; Running through the different critiques of US antitrust policy is the common theme that government interference in the operation of free markets does more harm than good.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank Easterbrook]], ''The Limits of Antitrust'', 63 U. Tex. L. Rev. 1 (1984).&lt;/ref&gt; "The only cure for bad theory", writes Bork, "is better theory".&lt;ref name="Bork 1978 p.405"/&gt; The late [[Harvard Law School]] Professor [[Phillip Areeda]], who favours more aggressive antitrust policy, in at least one Supreme Court case challenged Robert Bork's preference for non intervention.&lt;ref&gt;''Brooke Group v. Williamson'' [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=509&amp;invol=209 509 US 209] (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- why is this case more notable than the rest? --&gt;

==Other critiques==
Some [[economic libertarian]]s have criticised competition law in its entirety,
challenging the legitimacy of action against price fixing and [[cartel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;For a criticism of the libertarian view see Michael E. DeBow (2007) ''What's Wrong with Price Fixing: Responding to the New Critics of Antitrust'', published by the [http://www.cato.org/pubs/regulation/regv12n2/reg12n2-debow.html Cato Institute]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

See Dominic Armentaro "Antitrust: The Case for Repeal" (Ludwig Von Mises Institute 1986) and "The Case Against Antitrust" by Robert A. Levy (Cato Institute 2004). The case being that "competition law" (or "Antitrust") is based upon a false view of economics - that it harms rather than benefits consumers in the long term. And that "competition law" (or "Antitrust") is based upon principles of law and philosophy that are both false and confused.

==Policy developments==
Anti-[[cartel]] enforcement is a key focus of competition law enforcement policy. In the [[United States]] the Antitrust Criminal Penalty Enhancement and Reform Act 2004 raised the maximum imprisonment term for price fixing from three to ten years, and the maximum fine from $10 million to $100 million.&lt;ref&gt;see generally, Pate (2004) at [http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/public/speeches/206479.htm USDOJ]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 [[British Airways]] and [[Korean Air]] pleaded guilty to fixing cargo and passenger flight prices.&lt;ref&gt;see, USDOJ Antitrust's [http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/public/press_releases/2007/224928.htm press release] and the [http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/cases/f224900/224943.htm court filing]&lt;/ref&gt;

These actions complement the private enforcement which has always been an important feature of [[United States antitrust law]].  The [[United States Supreme Court]] summarised why [[United States Congress|Congress]] allows punitive damages in ''Hawaii v. Standard Oil''.&lt;ref&gt;''Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co. of California'' 405 U.S. 251, 262 (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Every violation of the antitrust laws is a blow to the free-enterprise system envisaged by Congress. This system depends on strong competition for its health and vigor, and strong competition depends, in turn, on compliance with antitrust legislation. In enacting these laws, Congress had many means at its disposal to penalize violators. It could have, for example, required violators to compensate federal, state, and local governments for the estimated damage to their respective economies caused by the violations. But, this remedy was not selected. Instead, Congress chose to permit all persons to sue to recover three times their actual damages every time they were injured in their business or property by an antitrust violation."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the [[European Union|EU]], the Modernisation Regulation 1/2003 means that the [[European Commission]] is no longer the only body capable of public enforcement of [[European Community competition law]]. This was done in order to facilitate quicker resolution of competition-related inquiries. In 2005 the Commission issued a [[Green Paper]] on ''Damages actions for the breach of the EC antitrust rules'',&lt;ref&gt;''Damages actions for the breach of the EC antitrust rules'' {SEC(2005) 1732} /* [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2005:0672:FIN:EN:HTML COM/2005/0672]&lt;/ref&gt; which suggested ways of making private damages claims against cartels easier.&lt;ref&gt;see FAQ on the Green paper [http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/05/489&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en here]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Marxism|expanded=Sociology}}
In  [[Marxist philosophy]], '''cultural hegemony''' is the [[Dominance hierarchy|domination]] of a culturally diverse society by the [[ruling class]] who manipulate the culture of that society—the [[belief]]s, [[explanation]]s, [[perception]]s, [[Value system|values]], and [[mores]]—so that their imposed, ruling-class [[worldview]] becomes the accepted cultural [[norm (sociology)|norm]]; the universally valid [[dominant ideology]], which justifies the social, political, and economic ''[[status quo]]'' as natural and inevitable, perpetual and beneficial for everyone, rather than as artificial [[Social constructionism|social constructs]] that benefit only the ruling class.&lt;ref&gt;Bullock, Alan; Trombley, Stephen, Editors (1999), ''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'' Third Edition, pp. 387–88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "TheColumbia"&gt;''The Columbia Encyclopedia'', Fifth Edition. (1994), p. 1215.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[philosophy]] and in [[sociology]], the term ''cultural hegemony'' has denotations and connotations derived from the Ancient Greek word ''ἡγεμονία (hegemonia)'' indicating leadership and rule. In politics, [[hegemony]] is the geopolitical method of indirect [[Empire|imperial]] dominance, with which the ''hegemon'' (leader state) rules subordinate states, by the threat of intervention, an implied means of [[Power (philosophy)|power]], rather than by direct military force, that is, [[invasion]], [[Military occupation|occupation]], and [[annexation]].&lt;ref&gt;Ross Hassig, ''Mexico and the Spanish Conquest'' (1994), pp. 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Etymology===
The etymologic and historical evolution of the Greek word ''ἡγεμονία'', and of its denotations, has proceeded thus:

* In [[Ancient Greece]] (8th c. BC – AD 6th c.), ''ἡγεμονία'' (leadership) denoted the politico–military dominance of a [[city-state]] upon other city-states, as in the [[League of Corinth|Hellenic League]] (338 BC), a [[federation]] of Greek city–states, established by King [[Philip II of Macedon]], to facilitate his access to and use of the Greek militaries against the [[Persian empire]].&lt;ref name="TheColumbia" /&gt;
* In the 19th century, ''hegemony'' (rule) denoted the [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] and cultural predominance of one country upon other countries, as in the [[European colonialism]] imposed upon the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Australia.{{Sfn | Bullock | Trombley | 1999 | pp = 387–88}}
* In the 20th century, the political-science denotation of ''hegemony'' (dominance) expanded to include [[cultural imperialism]]; the cultural domination, by a [[ruling class]], of a socially [[Social stratification|stratified]] society. That by manipulating the [[dominant ideology]] (cultural values and mores) of the society, the ruling class can intellectually dominate the other social classes with an imposed [[worldview]] (''Weltanschauung'') that ideologically justifies the social, political, and economic ''status quo'' of the society as if it were a natural and normal, inevitable and perpetual state of affairs that always has been so.&lt;ref name="TheColumbia" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clive Upton, William A. Kretzschmar, Rafal Konopka: ''Oxford Dictionary of Pronunciation for Current English''. Oxford University Press (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.flagrancy.net/timeline.html|title=US Hegemony|publisher=Flagrancy|contribution = Timeline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical===
In 1848, [[Karl Marx]] proposed that the [[economic recession]]s and practical contradictions of a capitalist economy would provoke the [[working class]] to [[proletarian revolution]], depose [[capitalism]], restructure social institutions (economic, political, social) per the rational models of [[socialism]], and thus begin the transition to a [[communist]] society.  Therefore, the [[dialectics|dialectical]] changes to the functioning of the [[economy]] of a society determine its social [[Base and superstructure|superstructures]] (culture and politics).

To that end, Antonio Gramsci proposed a ''strategic distinction'', between a War of Position and a War of Manœuvre. The war of position is an intellectual and cultural struggle wherein the [[anti-capitalist]] revolutionary creates a [[proletarian culture]] whose native value system counters the cultural hegemony of the [[bourgeoisie]]. The proletarian culture will increase [[class consciousness]], teach [[revolution]]ary theory and historical analysis, and thus propagate further revolutionary organisation among the social classes. On winning the war of position, socialist leaders would then have the necessary political power and popular support to begin the political [[maneuver warfare|manœuvre warfare]] of [[revolutionary socialism]].

The initial, theoretical application of cultural domination was as a Marxist analysis of "economic class" ([[base and superstructure]]), which Antonio Gramsci developed to comprehend "social class"; hence, cultural hegemony proposes that the prevailing cultural norms of a society, which are imposed by the ruling class ([[bourgeoisie|bourgeois cultural hegemony]]), must not be perceived as natural and inevitable, but must be recognized as artificial [[social construct]]s ([[institutions]], [[convention (norm)|practices]], [[beliefs]], et cetera) that must be investigated to discover their philosophic roots as instruments of social-class domination. That such praxis of knowledge is indispensable for the intellectual and political [[liberty|liberation]] of the [[proletariat]], so that workers and peasants, the people of town and country, can create their own [[working-class culture]], which specifically addresses their social and economic needs as social classes.

In a society, cultural hegemony is neither monolithic intellectual praxis, nor a unified system of values, but a complex of [[Social stratification|stratified]] [[social structure]]s, wherein each social and economic class has a social purpose and an internal class-logic that allows its members to behave in a way that is particular and different from the behaviours of the members of other social classes, whilst co-existing with them as constituents of the society.

As a result of their different social purposes, the classes will be able to coalesce into a [[society]] with a greater social mission. When a man, a woman, or a child perceives the social structures of bourgeois cultural hegemony, personal [[common sense]] performs a dual, structural role (private and public) whereby the individual person applies common sense to cope with daily life, which explains (to himself and to herself) the small segment of the [[social order]] stratum that each experiences as the ''status quo'' of life in society; "the way things are". Publicly, the emergence of the perceptual limitations of personal common sense inhibit the individual person’s perception of the greater nature of the systematic socio-economic [[exploitation of labour|exploitation]] made possible by cultural hegemony. Because of the discrepancy in perceiving the ''status quo''—the socio-economic hierarchy of bourgeois culture—most men and women concern themselves with their immediate (private) personal concerns, rather than with distant (public) concerns, and so do not think about and question the fundamental sources of their socio-economic [[oppression]], and its discontents, social, personal, and political.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1177/019685998601000203 |format= [[PDF]] |title= The Problem of Ideology — Marxism without Guarantees |year= 1986 |first= Stuart |last= Hall |authorlink= Stuart Hall (cultural theorist) |journal= Journal of Communication Inquiry |volume= 10 |issue= 2 |pages= 28–44 |url= http://www.ram-wan.net/restrepo/hall/The%20problem%20of%20ideology.pdf }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of cultural hegemony are perceptible at the personal level; although each person in a society lives a meaningful life in his and her social class, to him and to her, the discrete social classes might appear to have little in common with the private life of the individual man and woman. Yet, when perceived as a whole society, the life of each person does contribute to the greater social hegemony. Although social diversity, economic variety, and political freedom appear to exist—because most people ''see'' different life-circumstances—they are incapable of perceiving the greater hegemonic pattern created when the lives they witness coalesce as a society. The cultural hegemony is manifested in and maintained by an existence of minor, different circumstances that are not always fully perceived by the men and the women living the culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Antonio |last=Gramsci |authorlink=Antonio Gramsci |editor-first =Joseph A | editor-last = Buttigieg |title=Prison Notebooks |publisher= Columbia University Press |location=New York City |year=1992 |pages=233–38 |isbn=0-231-10592-4 |oclc=24009547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intellectuals==
In perceiving and combating cultural hegemony, the working class and the peasantry depend upon the intellectuals produced by their society, to which ends Antonio Gramsci distinguished between bourgeois-class intellectuals and working-class intellectuals, the proponents and the opponents of the imposed, normative culture, and thus of the social ''[[status quo]]'':

{{Quotation| Since these various categories of traditional [[intellectual]]s [administrators, [[scholar]]s and [[scientist]]s, theorists, non-ecclesiastical philosophers, etc.] experience through an ''esprit de corps'' their uninterrupted historical continuity, and their special qualifications, they thus put themselves forward as autonomous and independent of the [[Ruling class|dominant social group]]. This self-assessment is not without consequences in the [[Ideology|ideological]] and [[Politics|political]] fields, consequences of wide-ranging import. The whole of [[Idealism|idealist philosophy]] can easily be connected with this position, assumed by the social complex of intellectuals, and can be defined as the expression of that social utopia by which the intellectuals think of themselves as "independent" [and] autonomous, [and] endowed with a character of their own, etc.|''Selections from the Prison Notebooks of Antonio Gramsci'' (1971), pp. 7–8.&lt;ref&gt;''Selections from the Prison Notebooks of Antonio Gramsci'' (1971), Quentin Hoare and Geoffrey Nowell Smith, eds., pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quotation| The traditional and vulgarized type of the intellectual is given by the Man of Letters, the [[philosopher]], and the [[artist]]. Therefore, journalists, who claim to be men of letters, philosophers, artists, also regard themselves as the "true" intellectuals. In the modern world, [[technical education]], closely bound to industrial labor, even at the most primitive and unqualified level, must form the basis of the new type of intellectual. ...

The mode of being of the new intellectual can no longer consist of eloquence, which is an exterior and momentary mover of feelings and passions, but in active participation in practical life, as constructor [and] organizer, as "permanent persuader", not just simple orator.|''Selections from the Prison Notebooks of Antonio Gramsci'' (1971), pp. 9–10.&lt;ref&gt;''Selections from the Prison Notebooks of Antonio Gramsci'' (1971), Quentin Hoare and Geoffrey Nowell Smith, eds., pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Gramsci’s influence==
[[File:Rudi.jpg|thumb|right|300px|In the 1960s, the German student leader [[Rudi Dutschke]], of the ''[[German student movement|68er-Bewegung]]'', said that changing the bourgeois West Germany required a long march through the society’s institutions, in order to identify and combat cultural hegemony. This quote is often mis-attributed to Antonio Gramsci.&lt;ref name=JaButt&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buttigieg|first1=J. A.|title=The Contemporary Discourse on Civil Society: A Gramscian Critique|journal=boundary 2|date=1 March 2005|volume=32|issue=1|pages=33–52|doi=10.1215/01903659-32-1-33}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Cultural hegemony has philosophically influenced [[Eurocommunism]], the [[social sciences]], and the [[activist]] politics of socially [[Liberalism|liberal]] and [[Progressivism|progressive]] politicians. The analytic [[discourse]] of cultural hegemony is important to research and synthesis in [[anthropology]], political science, sociology, and [[cultural studies]]; in [[education]], cultural hegemony developed [[critical pedagogy]], by which the root causes of political and social discontent can be identified, and so resolved.

In 1967, the [[German student movement]] leader [[Rudi Dutschke]] reformulated Antonio Gramsci's philosophy of cultural hegemony with the phrase ''[[The long march through the institutions]]'' (German: ''Marsch durch die Institutionen'') to identify the political war of position, an allusion to the [[Long March]] (1934–35) of the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Chinese]] [[People's Liberation Army]], by means of which, the working class would produce their own organic intellectuals and culture ([[dominant ideology]]) to replace those imposed by the [[bourgeoisie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://english.nd.edu/faculty/profiles/joseph-a-buttigieg/ | editor1-first = Joseph A | editor1-last = Buttigieg | edition = English critical | last = Gramsci | title = Prison Notebooks | at = p 50 footnote 21 | quote = Long March Through the Institutions&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100616163619/http://english.nd.edu/faculty/profiles/joseph-a-buttigieg/ | archivedate = 2010-06-16 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1215/01903659-32-1-33| issn = 0190-3659| volume = 32| issue = 1| pages = 33–52| last = Buttigieg| first = Joseph A.| title = The Contemporary Discourse on Civil Society: A Gramscian Critique| journal = Boundary 2| accessdate = 2010-06-30| year = 2005| url = http://boundary2.dukejournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/32/1/33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "davidson"&gt;{{Citation | format = web log | url = http://carldavidson.blogspot.com/2006/04/strategy-hegemony-long-march.html | title = Strategy, Hegemony &amp; ‘The Long March’: Gramsci’s Lessons for the Antiwar Movement | first = Carl | last = Davidson | date = 6 April 2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Marsch durch die Institutionen|Marsch durch die Institutionen]] at German Wikipedia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[wikiquote:Antonio Gramsci#Misattributed|Antonio Gramsci: Misattributed]] at English Wikiquote for the origin of “The Long March Through the Institutions” quotation.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critique of Gramsci==

===The ideological apparatuses of the State===
As conceptual criticism of cultural hegemony, the [[structuralism|structuralist]] philosopher [[Louis Althusser]] presented the theory of the [[Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses|ideological state apparatus]] to describe the structure of complex relationships, among the different organs of the State, by which ideology is transmitted and disseminated to the populations of a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On The Reproduction of Capitalism|last=Althusser|first=Louis|publisher=Verso|year=2014|isbn=9781781681640|location=London/ New York|pages=74–75; 103–47; 177, 180, 198–206; 218–31; 242–6.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Althusser draws from the concepts of hegemony present in ''cultural hegemony'', yet rejects the absolute [[historicism]] proposed by Gramsci. He argues that the ideological state apparatuses (ISA) are the sites of ideological conflict among the social classes of a society. That, in contrast to the repressive state apparatuses (RSA), such as the military and the police forces, the ISA exist as a plurality. While the ruling class in power can readily control the repressive state apparatuses, the ISA are both the sites and the stakes (the objects) of class struggle. Moreover, the ISA are not monolithic social entities, and are distributed throughout the society, as public and as private sites of continual [[class struggle]].

In ''On the Reproduction of Capitalism'' (1968), Louis Althusser said that the ideological apparatuses of the State are over-determined zones of society that comprise complex elements of the ideologies of previous [[modes of production]], thus, are sites of continual political activity in a society, which are&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Reproduction of Capitalism|last=Althusser|first=Louis|publisher=Verso|year=2014|isbn=9781781681640|location=London/ New York|page=243.}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

* the religious ISA (the system of Churches)
 
* the educational ISA (the systems of public and private schools),
 
* the family ISA,
 
* the legal ISA,
 
* the political ISA (the political system, e.g. political parties),
 
* the trade union ISA,
 
* the communications ISA (press, radio, television, etc.)
 
* the cultural ISA (literature, the arts, sport, etc.)

Althusser said that the [[parliament]]ary structures of the State, by which the “will of the people” is represented by elected delegates, are an ideological apparatus of the State. That the political system, itself, is an ideological apparatus, because it involves the “fiction, corresponding to a ‘certain’ reality, that the component parts of the [political] system, as well as the principle of its functioning, are based on the ideology of the ‘freedom’ and ‘equality’ of the individual voters and the ‘free choice’ of the people’s representatives, by the individuals that ‘make up’ the people.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Reproduction of Capitalism|last=Althusser|first=Louis|publisher=Verso|year=2014|location=London/New York|pages=222–223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20410">'''Distributed leadership''' is a conceptual and analytical approach to understanding how the work of leadership takes place among the people and in context of a complex organization. Though developed and primarily used in education research, it has since been applied to other domains, including business and even tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Benson|first1=Angela M.|last2=Blackman|first2=Deborah|title=To distribute leadership or not? A lesson from the islands|journal=Tourism Management|date=October 2011|volume=32|issue=5|pages=1141–1149|doi=10.1016/j.tourman.2010.10.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than focus on characteristics of the individual leader or features of the situation, distributed leadership foregrounds how actors engage in tasks that are "stretched" or [[Distributed Cognition|distributed]] across the organization. With theoretical foundations in [[activity theory]] and [[Socially distributed cognition|distributed cognition]], understanding leadership from a distributed perspective means seeing leadership activities as a situated and social process at the intersection of leaders, followers, and the situation.

==Background and origins==

Distributed leadership emerged in the early 2000s from sociological, cognitive, psychological, and anthropological theories, most importantly [[distributed cognition]] and [[activity theory]], though also influenced by Wenger's [[communities of practice]]. It was conceived as a theoretical and analytical framework for studying school leadership, one that would explicitly focus attention on ''how'' leadership was enacted in schools, as an activity stretched across the "social and situational contexts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spillane|first1=James P.|last2=Halverson|first2=Richard|last3=Diamond|first3=John|title=Investigating School Leadership Practice: A Distributed Perspective|journal=Educational Researcher|date=2001|issue=April|pages=23–28|doi=10.3102/0013189x030003023|volume=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leadership research up through the late 1990s focused on specific the traits, functions, or effects of individual leaders. Much of the work done in educational research focused exclusively on the principal and centered around defining the heroics of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spillane|first1=James P.|title=Distributed leadership|date=2006|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-7879-6538-3|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Descriptions were written of what was being done but not how, which limited transferability across contexts. From this research it was unclear how leaders responded to the complex environment in schools. Though some research on leadership has continued to focus on the role or function of the designated leader, such as [[instructional leadership]] or [[transformational leadership]], there has also be a significant shift to understanding leadership as a shared effort by more than one person. The latter constructs look more broadly at various roles that provide forms of leadership throughout the school, including [[teacher leadership]], democratic leadership, [[shared leadership]], or [[collaborative leadership]]. Distributed leadership draws on these multi-agent perspectives to describe how actors work to establish the conditions for improving teaching and learning in schools. Distributed leadership is not an activity, rather a procedure&lt;ref&gt;Ali&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key concepts==

''Leadership'' is defined as any "activities tied to the core work of the organization that are designed by organizational members to influence the motivation, knowledge, affect, or practices of other organizational members."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spillane|first1=James P.|title=Distributed leadership|date=2006|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-7879-6538-3|pages=11–12|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus a leader is anyone who engages in these activities based on tasks, not position. As this definition implies, there is within an organization a group of people who are influenced by these leadership activities: these are the ''followers''. Importantly, the role of a leader or follower is dynamic, and a person might be a follower in one situation but not in another. Additionally, followers are not passive recipients of these influences and followers may influence the leaders as well.

===Leader Plus===
The ''Leader Plus'' aspect posits leadership activity as a whole is stretched, or distributed, across many people. Leadership is often enacted with those not in official leadership positions, thus distributed leadership examines enactments of leadership activity rather than roles. The configurations of leadership activity might include collaborated, collective, or coordinated distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spillane|first1=James P.|last2=Camburn|first2=Eric M.|last3=Stitziel Pareja|first3=Amber|title=Taking a Distributed Perspective to the School Principal's Workday|journal=Leadership and Policy in Schools|date=5 February 2007|volume=6|issue=1|pages=103–125|doi=10.1080/15700760601091200}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Collaborated distribution'' is where two or more leaders co-perform the leadership activity in the same place and time. In ''collective distribution'', the performance of leadership actions is separate but the actions are interdependent. ''Coordinated distribution'' exists where the leadership activities are performed in a particular sequence. Leadership activities are dynamic and situated, thus these three categories do not correspond with particular types of activities or duties. This part of the framework foregrounds leadership activities and all individuals who contribute, avoiding the tendency to focus solely on designated leaders.

===Practice===
''Practice'' is the product of interactions amongst ''leaders'', ''followers'', the ''situation'' over time. This is a key link to distributed cognition, where thinking and understanding is a process constituted of interactions with other people, tools, and routines, rather than independently. Research from a distributed perspective often takes a task-oriented approach&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Halverson|first1=Rich|title=Systems of practice: how leaders use artifacts to create professional community in schools|journal=Education Policy Analysis Archives|date=2003|volume=11|issue=37|doi=10.14507/epaa.v11n37.2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Halverson|first1=Richard|title=School formative feedback systems|journal=Peabody Journal of Education|date=2010|volume=85|issue=2|pages=130–155|doi=10.1080/01619561003685270}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a way to break down practice into manageable units of analysis. Understanding how tasks are carried out and which are deemed important by leaders and followers gives a window into practice.

[[File:Leadership Practice from a Distributed Perspective.png|thumb|upright=1.5|This is a diagram to understand how leadership practice is stretched across leaders, followers, the situation, and time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spillane|first1=James P.|title=Distributed leadership|date=2006|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-7879-6538-3|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Situation===
The ''situation'' comprises a complex web of material and social aspects of the environment, such as history, culture, physical environmental features, and policy environment, as well as more local aspects such as task complexity, organizational structure, or staff stability. The key here is to identify and focus on the "aspects of the situation that enable and constrain leadership practice but also captur[e] how they shape that practice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spillane|first1=James P.|title=Distributed leadership|date=2006|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco|isbn=0787965383|page=75|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas [[Contingency Theory]] describes the situation as merely the context within which individuals act,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spillane|first1=James P.|last2=Halverson|first2=Richard|last3=Diamond|first3=John B.|title=Towards a theory of leadership practice: a distributed perspective|journal=Journal of Curriculum Studies|date=January 2004|volume=36|issue=1|pages=3–34|doi=10.1080/0022027032000106726}}&lt;/ref&gt; a distributed perspective looks to the situation as ''constitutive'', in the sense that it both influences and is influenced by the actions of the people in it.

Two aspects of the situation that are often foregrounded in a distributed perspective are tools and routines. ''Tools'' are objects designed with a purpose toward enabling some action. Perhaps the most obvious example of a tool is a hammer. In organizations, however, tools might be a rubric for assessing teaching or an attendance checklist. They are not just accessories or incidentals; they both enable and constrain practice. Tools help focus the users attention but can also obscure other elements. The attendance taker might check off all those students present and think the task is complete but fail to notice a student that is present but not on the list. In this way, the tool is constitutive of the task, not just an accessory. A ''routine'' is a regular sequence or pattern of actions that happen in an organization. This may or may not align with the tools. For example, with a rubric for assessing teaching, the associated routine might be when and how an instructional leader observes a class, such as [[instructional rounds]]. Tools, routines, and other aspects of the situation might be locally designed, received, or inherited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Halverson|first1=Richard|title=Systems of Practice: How Leaders Use Artifacts to Create Professional Community in Schools|journal=Education Policy Analysis Archives|date=2003|volume=11|issue=37|doi=10.14507/epaa.v11n37.2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Importantly, tools and routines take a portion of the cognitive load required to complete a task (see [[Distributed Cognition]]). In the example of the rubric for assessing teaching, the principal doing the observations will be prompted for what to pay attention to and the routine will improve a consistency to the observation practice. Thus the enactment of leaderships in this situation is distributed across the principal, the teacher being observed, and the routine.

==Foundational theories==

'''[[Distributed cognition]]''' sits at the intersection of psychology, sociology, and cognitive science. It is essentially the theory that knowledge and the thinking with that knowledge are stretched across the tools, situation, other people, and context. It originated with the work of anthropologist [[Edwin Hutchins]] in the 1990s with his studies of navigation on a naval aircraft carrier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hutchins|first1=Edwin|title=Cognition in the wild|date=1994|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=9780262082310|edition=3. printing}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work on understanding naturally situated cognition led to the conclusion that cognition is socially distributed. Rather than looking for knowledge structures within an individual, his work showed that cognitive activity, or knowing what to do, was a situated process, influenced by other people, tools, and the situation.

Leadership is often studied as something that is done or acted out by an individual. Social or shared leadership approaches often still see leadership as actions done by individuals, just done in cooperation with others. Taking a distributed perspective, in contrast, draws on the theory of distributed cognition to understand leadership is an emergent property of the system. In this way, it sits in between those who see leadership is a result of individual agency and those who see it as an outcome of the situation.

'''[[Activity Theory]]''' is a broad social sciences approach to understanding human behavior as contextualized in a situation. This situated perspective expands the unit of analysis to the collective rather than individual and studies the relation between actions. Although this approach is aimed at understanding the individual, the unit of analysis is the broader system in which that individual participates. Engestrom identifies three generations of activity theory and associated researcher: first generation, a model focused on the individual (subject-object-mediating artifact) by [[Lev Vygotsky]] (1978); second generation, expansion of the model to include collective action, by Alexei Leont'ev (1981); and third generation, toward a networked understanding of interactive activity systems, proposed by Engestrom himself (1987).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Engestrom|first1=Yrgö|title=Learning by Expanding: An activity-theoretical approach to developmental research|date=1987|publisher=Orienta-Konsultit|location=Helsinki|edition=1st.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Activity Theory scholar, [[Barbara Rogoff]] expands this work in two ways: first, foregrounding of the individual must be done without losing sight of the interdependence of the system; and second, there are three different levels of resolution (interpersonal, cultural/community, and institutional/cultural planes) are needed to understand the different levels activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rogoff|first1=Barbara|title=Observing sociocultural activity on three planes: participatory appropriation, guided participation, and apprenticeship|date=1995|location=In J.V. Wertsch, P. del Rio, &amp; A. Alvarez  (Eds.) Sociocultural studies of mind. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; A distributed perspective on leadership takes this networked and multi-level approach to give "context of action" and "maintain... the tension between agency and distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spillane|first1=James|last2=Halverson|first2=Richard|last3=Diamond|first3=John|title=Investigating School Leadership Practice: A distributed perspective|journal=Educational Researcher|date=2001|issue=April|pages=23–28|doi=10.3102/0013189x030003023|volume=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Spillane and Gronn both draw on an application of activity theory in the field of leadership research that grew out of Mintzberg’s studies of work-activity, observing managers through structured observations to document what they actually do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gronn|first1=Peter|title=Distributed Properties: A New Architecture for Leadership|journal=Educational Management &amp; Administration|date=2000|volume=28|issue=3|pages=317–338|doi=10.1177/0263211x000283006}}&lt;/ref&gt; While innovative and exciting at the time, the nature of this documentation was ultimately deemed shallow as it did not differentiate between what was managerial and non-managerial work, there were still unanswered questions about how management was enacted, and it did not explain leadership effectiveness.

Understanding leadership from a distributed perspective means looking for leadership activity as situated and social process, drawing on both distributed cognition and activity theory.

==Usage of the term==

"Distributed leadership" entered the leadership and organizational theory discourse and clearly appealed to various scholars, policy makers, administrators, and practitioners as they have used it to frame, describe, and promote their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spillane|first1=James P.|last2=Diamond|first2=John B., Eds.|title=Distributed Leadership in Practice|date=2007|publisher=Teachers College, Columbia University|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8077-4806-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some use it as a recipe for effective leadership or improving schools; others use it to prescribe optimal leadership or organizational structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Alma|title=Distributed school leadership: Developing tomorrow's leaders|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-415-41958-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common alternative usage is equating distributed leadership with more than one designated leader, ideas such as shared, democratic, or collaborative leadership. Studies along these lines often look at the distribution of leadership roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leithwood|first1=Kenneth|last2=Mascall|first2=Blair|last3=Strauss|first3=Tiiu|last4=Sacks|first4=Robin|last5=Memon|first5=Nadeem|last6=Yashkina|first6=Anna|title=Distributing Leadership to Make Schools Smarter: Taking the Ego Out of the System|journal=Leadership and Policy in Schools|date=5 February 2007|volume=6|issue=1|pages=37–67|doi=10.1080/15700760601091267}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in these alternative organizational structures reflect the increased demands on leaders in schools and changes in the demands on educational organizations, and the term "distributed leadership" gets used to represent this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harris|first1=A.|last2=Spillane|first2=J.|title=Distributed leadership through the looking glass|journal=Management in Education|date=1 January 2008|volume=22|issue=1|pages=31–34|doi=10.1177/0892020607085623}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some worry that this overlap in usage results in a watering down of ideas or rebranding of old ideas in new terms.

A distinction that helps unravel the mixed usage is to distinguish between distributed leadership as a conceptual or analytical framework versus distributed leadership as a normative or practical framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harris|first1=A.|last2=Spillane|first2=J.|title=Distributed leadership through the looking glass|journal=Management in Education|date=1 January 2008|volume=22|issue=1|pages=31–34|doi=10.1177/0892020607085623}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking an analytical perspective is to understand leadership activities as a product of the interactions amongst leaders, followers, and the situation. This reflects the roots of the framework in distributed cognition and activity theory. A practical or normative approach is concerned with optimizing the distribution of leadership so as to improve organizations. In this case, research is focused on the effects of certain configurations of leadership roles or activities. While the use of Distributed Leadership as a term will continue to evolve as scholarship on the topic continues to develop, this distinction is important in maintaining common epistemologies for researchers, policy makers, administrators, and practitioners.

'''Downtown Lethbridge''' is the commercial centre of [[Lethbridge]], [[Alberta]], hosting most of the city's banks and several accounting and law practices, including national firms.

==Boundaries==
{{Location map|Lethbridge|lat_deg=49.695|lon_deg=-112.839|caption=Location of downtown marked in red}}
Strictly speaking, the downtown is defined by the [[Oldman River]] valley on the west, [[Alberta Highway 3|Crowsnest Trail]] and the [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CPR]] rail line on the north, Stafford Drive (9 Street) on the east and 6 Avenue on the south. It is not very large and contains very little in neighbourhood structure. It is home to [[Chinatown, Lethbridge|Chinatown]], a two block area on 2 Avenue, west of [[Galt Gardens]].

==Transportation==

Downtown Lethbridge serves as a transportation hub. Whoop-up Drive, the busiest roadway in Lethbridge, connects to downtown. Scenic Drive also provides downtown with a connection to the [[United States]] via [[Alberta Highway 4|Highway 4]] and the [[Lethbridge County Airport]] via [[Alberta Highway 5|Highway 5]]. Downtown has two connections to Highway&amp;nbsp;3, which provides direct access to [[British Columbia]] and indirect access to [[Calgary, Alberta|Calgary]] and [[Saskatchewan]]. The city's only [[Greyhound Lines of Canada|Greyhound]] terminal is located downtown. The city's main [[Lethbridge Transit|transit]] terminal is downtown; half of the city's bus routes converge on 4 Avenue.

==Arts and culture==

Arts and culture venues in Lethbridge are located in or near downtown. There are two art galleries ([[Southern Alberta Art Gallery]] and [[Bowman Arts Centre]]), two theatres ([[Genevieve E. Yates Memorial Centre|Yates Theatre and Sterndale Bennet Theatre]]), the [[Galt Museum &amp; Archives|Galt Museum]], two cinemas, the [[Lethbridge Public Library]] and several nightclubs.

==Shopping==

The downtown area has several hundred street-front retail stores interspersed with professional services. Two of the city's largest malls ([[Lethbridge Centre]] and [[Park Place Mall]]) are located downtown.

==Housing==

Much of the land use in the downtown area is commercial or public use. Residential use is generally of three different types: high density apartments (over a dozen stories), medium-density apartments (two-storey buildings and units above retail establishments) and condominiums for seniors. There are three senior care facilities in or near downtown.

'''Due diligence''' is an investigation of a business or person prior to signing a contract, or an act with a certain [[standard of care]].

It can be a legal obligation, but the term will more commonly apply to voluntary investigations. A common example of due diligence in various industries is the process through which a potential acquirer evaluates a target company or its assets for an [[Mergers and acquisitions|acquisition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hoskisson |first=Robert E. |last2=Hitt |first2=Michael A. |last3=Ireland |first3=R. Duane |year=2004 |title=Competing for Advantage |location=Mason, OH |publisher=South-Western/Thomson Learning |page=251 |isbn=0-324-27158-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory behind due diligence holds that performing this type of investigation contributes significantly to informed decision making by enhancing the amount and quality of information available to decision makers and by ensuring that this information is systematically used to deliberate in a reflexive manner on the decision at hand and all its costs, benefits, and risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chapman |first=C. E. |year=2006 |title=Conducting Due Diligence |publisher=[[Practicing Law Institute]], New York, NY }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The term “due diligence” means "required carefulness" or "reasonable care" in general usage, and has been used in this sense since at least the mid-fifteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |title='Due Diligence' Merriam-Webster entry |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/due%20diligence}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became a specialized legal term and later a common business term due to the United States’ [[Securities Act of 1933]], where the process is called "reasonable investigation" (section 11b3). This Act included a defense at Section 11, referred to later in legal usage as the “due diligence” defense, which could be used by [[broker-dealer]]s when accused of inadequate disclosure to investors of [[material information]] with respect to the purchase of [[securities]]. In legal and business use, the term was soon used for the process itself instead of how it was to be performed, so that the original expressions such as "exercise due diligence in investigating" and "investigation carried out with due diligence" were soon shortened to "due diligence investigation" and finally "due diligence".

As long as broker-dealers exercised “due diligence” (required carefulness) in their investigation into the company whose [[Stock|equity]] they were selling and as long as they disclosed to the investor what they found, they would not be held liable for non-disclosure of information that was not discovered in the process of that investigation.

The broker-dealer community quickly institutionalized, as a standard practice, the conducting of due diligence investigations of any stock offerings in which they involved themselves. Originally the term was limited to public offerings of equity investments, but over time it has come to be associated with investigations of private mergers and acquisitions as well.

== Examples ==
=== Business transactions and corporate finance ===
Due diligence takes different forms depending on its purpose:
# The examination of a potential target for merger, acquisition, privatization, or similar corporate finance transaction normally by a buyer. (This can include self due diligence or “reverse due diligence”, i.e. an assessment of a company, usually by a third party on behalf of the company, prior to taking the company to market.)
# A reasonable investigation focusing on material future matters.
# An examination being achieved by asking certain key questions, including, how do we buy, how do we structure an acquisition, and how much do we pay?
# An investigation of current practices of process and policies.
# An examination aiming to make an acquisition decision via the principles of valuation and shareholder value analysis.&lt;ref name="Gillman"&gt;{{cite book | last=Gillman | first=Luis | year=2010 | title= Due Diligence, a Strategic and Financial Approach | edition=2nd |publisher=LexisNexis |location=Durban |isbn=978-0-409-04699-1 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The due diligence process (framework) can be divided into nine distinct areas:&lt;ref name="Gillman"/&gt;

# Reconciliation audit.
 {{Div col end}}

It is essential that the concepts of valuations (shareholder value analysis) be linked into a due diligence process. This is in order to reduce the number of failed mergers and acquisitions.&lt;ref name="Gillman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gillman |first= |year=2002 |journal=Academy of Accounting and Financial Studies Journal |title=The link between valuations and due diligence |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages= |issn=1096-3685 |url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/article/Academy-Accounting-Financial-Studies-Journal/179817638.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this regard, two new audit areas have been incorporated into the Due Diligence framework:&lt;ref name="Gillman"/&gt;
* the Compatibility Audit which deals with the strategic components of the transaction and in particular the need to add shareholder value and
* the Reconciliation audit, which links/consolidates other audit areas together via a formal valuation in order to test whether shareholder value will be added.&lt;ref name="Gillman"/&gt;

The relevant areas of concern may include the financial, legal, labor, tax, IT, environment and market/commercial situation of the company. Other areas include intellectual property, real and personal property, insurance and liability coverage, debt instrument review, employee benefits (including the [[Affordable Care Act]]) and labor matters, immigration, and international transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Truax|first1=Margret |title=M&amp;A Transactions: Affordable Care Act Due Diligence Considerations |url=https://www.transactionadvisors.com/insights/ma-transactions-affordable-care-act-due-diligence-considerations |publisher=Transaction Advisors |ISSN=2329-9134}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gary M.

Due Diligence has emerged as a separate profession for accounting and auditing experts.

=== Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ===
{{main|Foreign Corrupt Practices Act}}
With the number and size of penalties increasing, the United States' Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) has caused many U.S. institutions to look into how they evaluate all of their relationships overseas. The lack of a due diligence of a company’s agents, vendors, and suppliers, as well as merger and acquisition partners in foreign countries could lead to doing business with an organization linked to a [[foreign official]] or state owned enterprises and their executives. This link could be perceived as leading to the bribing of the foreign officials and as a result lead to noncompliance with the FCPA. Due diligence in regard to FCPA compliance is required in two aspects:

# Initial due diligence – this step is necessary in evaluating what risk is involved in doing business with an entity prior to establishing a relationship and assesses risk at that point in time.
# Ongoing due diligence – this is the process of periodically evaluating each relationship overseas to find links between current business relationships overseas and ties to a [[foreign official]] or illicit activities linked to corruption. This process will be performed indefinitely as long as a relationship exists, and usually involves comparing the companies and executives to a database of foreign officials. This process should be performed on all relationships regardless of location&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldcompliance.com/fcpa-definition.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830160102/http://worldcompliance.com/fcpa-definition.html |archivedate=August 30, 2010 |df=mdy }} WorldCompliance.com&lt;/ref&gt; and is often part of a wider [[Integrity Management]] initiative . {{failed verification|date=November 2011}}

In the M&amp;A context, buyers can use the due diligence phase to integrate a target into their internal FCPA controls, focusing initial efforts on necessary revisions to the target's business activities with a high-risk of corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Brooks|first1=Robin | last2=Stacey |first2=Oliver | last3=Jarman|first3=Daniel |title=Tackling Corruption and Regulatory Risk in M&amp;A Transactions|url= https://www.transactionadvisors.com/insights/tackling-corruption-and-regulatory-risk-ma-transactions|publisher=Transaction Advisors |ISSN=2329-9134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While financial institutions are among the most aggressive in defining FCPA best practices, manufacturing, retailing and energy industries are highly active in managing FCPA compliance programs.

===Human rights===
Passed on May 25, 2011, the [[OECD]] member countries agreed to revise their guidelines promoting tougher standards of corporate behavior, including human rights. As part of this new definition, they utilized a new aspect of due diligence that requires a corporation to investigate third party partners for potential abuse of human rights.

In the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises document, it is stated that all members will “Seek ways to prevent or mitigate adverse human rights impacts that are directly linked to their business operations, products or services by a business relationship, even if they do not contribute to those impacts”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/43/29/48004323.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904230329/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/43/29/48004323.pdf |date=September 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was originally put forth by UN Special Representative for Human Rights and Business [[John Ruggie]], who uses it as an umbrella to cover the steps and processes by which a company understands, monitors and mitigates its human rights impacts. [[Human Rights Impact Assessment]] is a component of this.

The UN formalized guidelines for Human Rights Due Diligence on June 16 with the endorsement of Ruggie’s Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-humanrights.org/media/documents/ruggie/ruggie-guiding-principles-21-mar-2011.pdf |title= Report of the Special Representative of the Secretary – General on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises, John Ruggie|publisher=Human Rights Council|date= |accessdate=March 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Civil litigation ===
Due diligence in civil procedure is the idea that reasonable investigation is necessary before certain kinds of [[judicial relief|relief]] are requested.

For example, duly diligent efforts to locate and/or serve a party with civil process is frequently a requirement for a party seeking to use means other than [[service of process|personal service]] to obtain jurisdiction over a party. Similarly, in areas of the law such as [[bankruptcy]], an attorney representing someone filing a bankruptcy petition must engage in due diligence to determine that the representations made in the bankruptcy petition are factually accurate. Due diligence is also generally prerequisite to a request for relief in states where civil litigants are permitted to conduct pre-litigation discovery of facts necessary to determine whether or not a party has a factual basis for a cause of action.

In civil actions seeking a foreclosure or seizure of property, a party requesting this relief is frequently required to engage in due diligence to determine who may claim an interest in the property by reviewing public records concerning the property and sometimes by a physical inspection of the property that would reveal a possible interest in the property of a tenant or other person.

Due diligence is also a concept found in the civil litigation concept of a [[statute of limitations]]. Frequently, a statute of limitations begins to run against a plaintiff when that plaintiff knew or should have known had that plaintiff investigated the matter with due diligence that the plaintiff had a claim against a defendant. In this context, the term “due diligence” determines the scope of a party’s [[constructive knowledge]], upon receiving notice of facts sufficient to constitute “inquiry notice” that alerts a would-be plaintiff that further investigation might reveal a cause of action.

=== Criminal law ===
In [[criminal law]], due diligence is the only available defense to a crime that is one of [[strict liability]] (i.e., a crime that only requires an [[actus reus]] and no [[mens rea]]). Once the criminal offence is proven, the defendant must prove on balance that they did everything possible to prevent the act from happening. It is not enough that they took the normal standard of care in their industry – they must show that they took every reasonable precaution.

Due diligence is also used in criminal law to describe the scope of the duty of a prosecutor, to take efforts to turn over potentially [[exculpatory evidence]], to (accused) criminal defendants.

In criminal law, “due diligence” also identifies the standard a prosecuting entity must satisfy in pursuing an action against a defendant, especially with regard to the provision of the Federal and State Constitutional and statutory right to a speedy trial or to have a warrant or detainer served in an action. In cases where a defendant is in any type of custodial situation where their freedom is constrained, it is solely the prosecuting entities duty to ensure the provision of such rights and present the citizen before the court with jurisdiction. This also applies where the respective judicial system and/or prosecuting entity has current address or contact information on the named party and said party has made no attempt to evade notice of the prosecution of the action.&lt;ref&gt;Hawaii Revised Statues 353-66.5 and 604-7.2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Due diligence defence==
In the United Kingdom, "proper use of a due diligence system" may be used as a defence against a charge of breach of regulations e.g. under the Timber and Timber Products (Placing on the Market) Regulations 2013 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/233/pdfs/uksi_20130233_en.pdf Timber and Timber Products (Placing on the Market) Regulations 2013, SI 233/2013]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Environmental Protection (Microbeads) (England) Regulations 2017,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2017/1312/pdfs/uksi_20171312_en.pdf Environmental Protection (Microbeads) (England) Regulations 2017, SI 1312/2017]&lt;/ref&gt; businesses may be able to defend a charge of non-compliance with regulations if they can show that they have undertaken supplier due diligence to a necessary standard.

The '''Enterprise Bus Matrix''' is a [[data Warehouse]] planning tool and model created by [[Ralph Kimball]], and is part of the Data Warehouse Bus Architecture. The Matrix is the logical definition of one of the core concepts of Kimball’s approach to Dimensional Modeling – Conformed dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kimballgroup.com/2003/09/15/design-tip-49-off-the-bench/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130216080251/http://www.kimballgroup.com/2003/09/15/design-tip-49-off-the-bench/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-02-16 |title=Design Tip #49: Off The Bench |publisher=Kimball Group |date=2003-09-15 |accessdate=2015-05-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bus Matrix defines part of the Data Warehouse Bus Architecture and is an output of the Business Requirements phase in [[The Kimball Lifecycle]]. It is applied in the following phases of [[dimensional modeling]] and development of the Data Warehouse . The matrix can be categorized as a hybrid model, being part technical design tool, part project management tool and part communication tool&lt;ref name="Kimball"&gt;Kimball, Ralph &amp; Ross, Margy; The Data Warehouse Toolkit: The Complete Guide to Dimensional Modeling, 2nd Edition John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Enterprise Bus Matrix stems from the issue of how one goes about creating the overall Data Warehouse environment.  Historically there has been the structure of the centralized and planned approach and the more loosely defined, department specific, solutions developed in a more independent matter. Autonomous projects can result in a range of isolated stove pipe data marts. Naturally each approach has its issues; the overall visionary approach often struggles with long delivery cycles and lack of reaction time as the formalities and scope issues is evident. On the other hand, the development of isolated data marts, leading to [[Stovepipe system]]s that lacks synergy in development. Over time this approach will lead to a so-called data-mart-in-a-box architecture&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mimno.com/avoiding-mistakes3.html#6]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704220014/http://www.mimno.com/avoiding-mistakes3.html#6 |date=July 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where [[interoperability]] and lack of cohesion is apparent, and can hinder the realization of an overall enterprise Data Warehouse. As an attempt to handle this matter [[Ralph Kimball]] introduced the enterprise bus.

==Bus matrix==
The bus matrix purpose is one of high abstraction and visionary planning on the Data Warehouse architectural level. By dictating coherency in the development and implementation of an overall Data Warehouse the Bus Architecture approach enables an overall vision of the broader enterprise integration and consistency while at the same time dividing the problem into more manageable parts&lt;ref name="Kimball" /&gt; – all in a technology and software independent manner .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b-eye-network.com/view/713 |title=Data Warehouse: Ralph Kimball’s Vision by Katherine Drewek |publisher=Beyenetwork |date=2005-03-16 |accessdate=2015-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bus matrix and architecture builds upon the concept of conformed dimensions -  creating a structure of common dimensions that ideally can be used across the enterprise by all business processes related to the DW and the corresponding fact tables from which they derive their context. According to Kimball and Margy Ross's article  “Differences of Opinion”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://intelligent-enterprise.informationweek.com/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=0OVJNEHMPRXGRQE1GHRSKH4ATMY32JVN?articleID=17800088 |title=Enterprise Software News, Analysis, &amp; Advice - InformationWeek |publisher=Intelligent-enterprise.informationweek.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; "''The Enterprise Data warehouse built on the bus architecture ”identifies and enforces the relationship between business process metrics (facts) and descriptive attributes (dimensions)''”.

The concept of a [[Bus (computing)|bus]] is well known in the language of [[Information Technology]], and is what reflects the conformed dimension concept in the Data Warehouse, creating the skeletal structure where all parts of a system connect, ensuring [[interoperability]] and consistency of data, and at the same time considers future expansion. This makes the conformed dimensions act as the integration ‘glue’, creating a robust backbone of the enterprise Data Warehouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://intelligent-enterprise.informationweek.com/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=GMS3H4SOBFQBBQE1GHOSKH4ATMY32JVN?articleID=17800088&amp;pgno=2 |title=Enterprise Software News, Analysis, &amp; Advice - InformationWeek |publisher=Intelligent-enterprise.informationweek.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Establishment and applicability==
Figure 1&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.widama.us/Documents/Kimball-DimensionalModeling.PDF |format=PDF |title=Dimensional Modeling Overview |author=Bob Becker |publisher=Widama.is |accessdate=2015-05-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130322224742/http://www.widama.us/Documents/Kimball-DimensionalModeling.PDF |archivedate=2013-03-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; shows the base for a single document planning tool for the whole of the DW implementation - a graphical overview of the enterprises core business processes or events each correspond to a measurement table of facts, that typically is complemented by a major source system in the horizontal rows.  In the vertical columns the groups of contextual data is found as the common, conformed dimensions.

In this way the shared dimensions are defined, as each process indicates what dimensions it applies to through the cells figure 2.&lt;ref name="Kimball" /&gt; By this definition and coordination of conformed dimensions and processes the development of the overall data DW bus architecture is realized.&lt;ref name="Kimball" /&gt; The matrix identifies the shared dimensions related to processes and fact tables, and can be a tool for planning, prioritizing what needs to be approached, coordinating implementation and communicating the importance for conformed dimensions .

Kimball extends the matrix bus in detail as seen in figure 3&lt;ref name="Kimball" /&gt;  by introducing the other steps of the Datawarehouse Methodology; The Fact tables, Granularity, and at last the description of the needed facts.  description of the fact tables, granularity and fact instances of each process, structuring and specifying what is needed across the enterprise in a more specific matter, further exemplifying how the matrix can be used as a planning tool.

'''Jean Michel Karam''' (born November 14, 1969 in [[Jdeideh]], [[Lebanon]]) is a [[Lebanese people in France|Franco-Lebanese]] [[engineer]], [[inventor]] and [[entrepreneur]] in the field of [[microelectronics]] and cosmetics.

== Education ==

Arriving in France in 1990, he received an Electrical Engineering degree in 1993 from the Ecole Supérieure d'Ingénieurs en Electrotechnique et Electronique de  Paris ([[ESIEE Paris]]) and a master's degree in Microelectronics from the [[Université de Paris VII]]. In 1996, he received a PhD in Microelectronics from the Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble&lt;ref&gt;Business Week [http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=420584&amp;ticker=MEMS:FP&amp;previousCapId=125986&amp;previousTitle=MEMSCAP%20S.A. Memscap Sa]&lt;/ref&gt; (INPG).

== Career ==
In 1994, he began his career as a research engineer at the TIMA-CM (Techniques de l'Informatique et de la Micro-électronique pour l'Architecture Informatique) laboratory in [[Grenoble]], France. This Research &amp; Development center placed under joint guardianship with the [[Centre National de Recherche Scientifique]] (CNRS) and the INPG allowed him to make his first weapons as the Research Director heading up a team of researchers focused on the design and fabrication methods of [[microelectromechanical systems]] (MEMS). Three years after its creation, it comprised 35 researchers for MEMS research.

In November 1997, Karam founded his first company, MEMSCAP, a supplier of products based on MEMS technology. During its first two years, Karam raised more than 13 million euros from [[venture capital]]ists in order to develop his company and finance his research programs.

On March 2, 2001, MEMSCAP had its [[initial public offering]], going public on the Eurolist C of the [[NYSE Euronext]], Paris (code ISIN: FR0010298620-MEMS), raising 101 million euros (140 million US dollars), on a basis of 430 million euros of market capitalization.&lt;ref name=Karam&gt;{{cite web|last=Karam|first=Jean Michel|title=Memscap|url=http://www.memscap.com/jean-michel-karam}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lindedin Jean Michel Karam"&gt;{{cite web|last=Karam |first=Jean Michel |title=Lindedin Jean Michel Karam |url=http://fr.linkedin.com/pub/jean-michel-karam/0/724/172 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130615223959/http://fr.linkedin.com/pub/jean-michel-karam/0/724/172 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Karam initiated research on applied technology in [[dermatology]] and [[skincare]] within INTUISKIN, at that time a fully owned subsidiary of his MEMSCAP Group. In 2010, in association with a group of investors and figures from the cosmetics world{{who|date=April 2013}}, he decided to spin-off  INTUISKIN from MEMSCAP. In this context, he launched the skincare brand [[IOMA]], a collaboration between technology experts and [[dermatology]] and cosmetics specialists, of which the previous president of [[Thierry Mugler]], Véra Strubi, presently a member of the board of directors.Today, Karam is Chairman and CEO of both MEMSCAP and INTUISKIN/IOMA.

Additionally, Karam is a [[business angel]] investing in technology start-ups, and works as a consultant for technology companies and investors{{which|date=April 2013}}. He also continues to be involved in innovation and research – he currently owns more than 50 patents – as well as contributing to numerous scientific and economic publications{{which|date=April 2013}}.

== MEMSCAP ==

MEMSCAP is a supplier of products based on Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS). A large portion of MEMSCAP sales are from the export market.

To date, MEMSCAP has acquired 6 companies: one in [[Norway]] (2002), one in the [[United States]] (2002), three in [[France]] (2003, 2005 and 2007) and one in [[Israel]] (2003).&lt;ref&gt;MEMSCAP, Historique, 2011 - 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, MEMSCAP has transitioned from software design for producing microsystems to designing the microsystems themselves. The focus of MEMSCAP centers on three principal activities:&lt;ref&gt;MEMSCAP, Applications et segments de marchés, 2011 - 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

* Aeronautics : more than 80% of airplanes are equipped with its pressure sensors.
* Optical communications : sale of fiber optics devices, such as variable optical attenuators. The company controls 70% of the world market for variable optical attenuators.
* Medical and biomedical: its blood pressure sensors equip intensive care and surgery rooms as well as the artificial heart made by the French company CARMAT. The MEMSCAP devices are integrated in a pill containing mini-cameras for [[colonoscopies]], enabling the detection of [[colon cancer]] without a surgical procedure.&lt;ref&gt;« L’article du jour », Lyon entreprises, March 7, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== INTUISKIN ==

INTUISKIN is a manufacturer of skincare technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Press Release, categorynet.com, September 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Created in 2002 by Karam, INTUISKIN performs applied research in technology, science, dermatology and skincare.

=== IOMA ===
Although research associated to IOMA started in 2002, the commercial launch of IOMA brand occurred in 2010. The brand is a collaboration between experts in technology, led by Karam, and specialists in dermatology and skincare.

Today, IOMA is distributed in more than 500 points of sale in France, including the Marionnaud and Beauty Success retail networks. In the USA, IOMA is distributed at [[Saks Fifth Avenue]] and in the United Kingdom at [[Harrods]]. The brand is also present in [[Spain]], [[Austria]] and [[Ukraine]].

IOMA applies imaging and probe-based techniques, powered by MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical Systems) technology, combined with targeted and customized skincare regimens, for a customizable treatment program.

The MEMS-based technology analyzes skin below the surface, and prescribes a customized skincare regimen. The devices will also be able to track and measure results over time.

== Awards ==
Karam and his company have won over 10 international awards including :

* U.S. Commercial Service (USCS) of the U.S. Department of Commerce – Award of Excellence for international commercial development (2012)
* SEMICON MicroNanoSystems Innovation Award (2009)&lt;ref&gt;BusinessWire News [http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20091007006310/en/MEMSCAP-2009-SEMICON-Award-MicroNanoSystems-Innovation MEMSCAP Gets 2009 SEMICON Award for MicroNanoSystems Innovation]&lt;/ref&gt;

* The French Stock-IT Award for the company with the highest growth (2001 and 2002){{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

== Association LEYLA ==
In 2007 in Bernin, France, Karam founded the LEYLA Charity, named for his mother who died in 1995, at age 48, from [[amylose]], a rare and orphan disease. The purpose of this foundation is to fight against rare or neglected diseases and, according to its founder, "spare other families this same kind of suffering".

Their areas of interventions include scientific education and training, and research. His scientific committee is responsible for awarding grants for the theses and doctorates dedicated to studying these types of diseases, and following the progress of these grantees.

The scientific and ethical committees include professionals such as Prof. Christian Massot, chief of internal medicine at the teaching hospital in Grenoble and Marcel Foulon, former President of the [[Court of Appeal of Paris]].

As Colombian Minister of Foment in 1957 during the administration of General [[Gabriel París Gordillo]], he helped design and implement the mechanism that would eventually become known as the ''[[Vallejo Plan]]'', a business plan that would allow Colombian companies to import [[raw materials]], specialized equipment, and [[industrial machinery]] with [[duty (economics)|duty]]-free exemptions or lowered [[tariff]]s, if those materials and/or equipment would go towards producing marketable exporting goods, as an incentive to industrialize the national economy and open up to international markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=50 Protagonistas de la Economía Colombiana |trans-title=50 Protagonists of the Colombian Economy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CP2Cf-Qvov8C |first=Jorge Emilio |last=Sierra Montoya |publisher=[[Jorge Tadeo Lozano University]], Faculty of Economics |year=2004 |location=Bogotá |language=Spanish |isbn=978-958-9029-61-9 |oclc=254600966 |chapter=Vallejo Arbeláez, Joaquín: El "Papá" del Plan Vallejo |trans-chapter=Vallejo Arbeláez, Joaquín: The "Father" of the Vallejo Plan |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=CP2Cf-Qvov8C&amp;pg=PA367 |accessdate=2010-12-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Diario Oficial No. 46.246 |date=2006-04-21 |title=Decreto 1209 de 2006 |trans-title=Decree 1209 of 2006 |location=Bogotá |publisher=[[President of Colombia|Office of the President of the Republic [Colombia]]] |accessdate=2010-12-29 |quote=Por el cual se honra la memoria del señor Joaquín Vallejo Arbeláez |url=http://www.presidencia.gov.co/prensa_new/decretoslinea/2006/abril/20/dec1209200406.pdf |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ministros del siglo XX, Vol. 2|trans-title=Minister of the 20th Century, Vol, 2|last=González Díaz|first=Andrés|year=1982|url=http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/todaslasartes/obrames/minisdos/indice.htm |publisher=[[Luis Ángel Arango Library]] |chapter=Junta Militar Bajo Mayor General Gabriel París |trans-chapter=Military Junta under Major General Gabriel París |chapterurl=http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/todaslasartes/obrames/minisdos/minisdos8.htm |accessdate=2010-12-29 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ministros del siglo XX, Vol. 2|trans-title=Minister of the 20th Century, Vol, 2|last=González Díaz|first=Andrés|year=1982|url=http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/todaslasartes/obrames/minisdos/indice.htm |publisher=[[Luis Ángel Arango Library]] |chapter=Guillermo León Valencia |chapterurl=http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/todaslasartes/obrames/minisdos/minisdos10.htm |accessdate=2010-12-29 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ministros del siglo XX, Vol. 2|trans-title=Minister of the 20th Century, Vol, 2|last=González Díaz|first=Andrés|year=1982|url=http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/todaslasartes/obrames/minisdos/indice.htm |publisher=[[Luis Ángel Arango Library]] |chapter=Misael Pastrana Borrerp |chapterurl=http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/todaslasartes/obrames/minisdos/minisdos12.htm |accessdate=2010-12-29 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5135">'''John Hyndford Cochrane''' (3 July 1750 – 21 November 1801) was a wealthy merchant and author from a notable Scottish aristocratic family. 

John Cochrane was born in 1750, the second living son of [[Thomas Cochrane, 8th Earl of Dundonald|Thomas Cochrane]] and Jane Stuart. His father was serving as a [[HM Customs and Excise|Commissioner of the Excise]] for Scotland at the time, but unexpectedly inherited the title of [[Earl of Dundonald]] in 1758 on the death of his younger cousin William, the 7th Earl.

John Cochrane was sent to India at the age of 16, obtaining an appointment as a clerk or [[East_India_Company#Writers|Writer]] due to the influence of his uncles [[Andrew Stuart (1725–1801)|Andrew Stuart]] and [[James Stuart (East India Company officer)|James Stuart]].&lt;ref&gt;''East India Patronage and the British State: The Scottish Elite and Politics in the Eighteenth Century'', George McGilvary, London/New York: I. B. Tauris, 2008, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1779 to 1783 Cochrane acted as a deputy paymaster in British North America.&lt;ref&gt;Report on Canadian Archives, 1889, Douglas Brymner, Ottawa: Brown, Chamberlin, 1890, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1783 Cochrane was sued by [[Frederick Haldimand|General Haldimand]] for refusing to sue merchants himself for amounts owed the Crown for bills of exchange; Cochrane and the merchants lost in the provincial courts, a painful loss which demonstrated to the merchants the need for a better legal system in Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;The Empire of the St. Lawrence: A Study in Commerce and Politics, 2nd ed., Donald Creighton, 1956, Toronto: University of Toronto Press, reprint 2002, p. 95-6&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1790 to 1792 Cochrane held the contract for victualling the British fleet in India. In 1792 he signed over the contract to his brother [[Basil Cochrane|Basil]], returning to London to be his brother's agent there.&lt;ref&gt;''Sustaining the Fleet, 1793-1815: War, the British Navy and the Contractor State'', Roger Knight and Martin Howard Wilcox, Woodbridge: Boydell Press, 2010, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1793 Cochrane was appointed as Deputy Commissary for North Britain.&lt;ref&gt;The annual register, or, A view of the history, politics, and literature for the year 1794, Edmund Burke, London: J. Dodsley, 1799, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In addition to his fellow [[nabob]] Basil, John Cochrane's siblings included [[Archibald Cochrane, 9th Earl of Dundonald|Archibald]] (1748–1831), the eldest son and 9th Earl of Dundonald; Admiral [[Alexander Cochrane]] (1758–1832); [[George Cochrane (politician)|George]], a soldier and MP; and [[Andrew Cochrane-Johnstone|Andrew]] (1767–1833), an adventurer and MP who was disgraced in the [[Great Stock Exchange Fraud of 1814]]. 

The [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|Earl of St. Vincent]], [[Admiral of the Fleet]], wrote of the Cochrane brothers in 1806, "The Cochranes are not to be trusted out of sight, they are all mad, romantic, money-getting and not truth-telling—and there is not a single exception in any part of the family."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1790-1820/member/cochrane-%28afterwards-cochrane-johnstone-%29-hon-andrew-james-1767-1833 |title=Cochrane-Johnstone, Hon. Andrew James (1767-1833) |first=R. G. |last=Thorne |work=History of Parliament Online |year=2013 |accessdate=7 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cochrane reputedly had at least three illegitimate children. With Geneviève Dulan in Quebec he had Admiral [[Nathaniel Day Cochrane]] (1780–1844) and Angelica Cochrane (1782–1834); he also sired [[John Cochrane (chess player)|John Cochrane]] (1798–1878), a notable lawyer in India and chess player.
 
Cochrane married Selina Fitzroy Birch (born c. 1769) on 7 May 1800; Selina and an infant son died a month before Cochrane the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Early Journals and Letters of Fanny Burney, Volume 3: The Streatham Years, eds. Lars Troide and Stewart Cooke, McGill Queen's Press, 1994, p. 358-9, n. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

A portrait of Cochrane exists, by portraitist [[Lemuel Francis Abbott]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnet.com/artists/lemuel-francis-abbott/portrait-of-the-hon-john-cochrane-1750-1801-tVy72b__6YdyCf8uvAW3YQ2 ArtNet listing for Abbott portrait of Cochrane]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
Cochrane wrote several long pamphlets on subjects of interest to him:
* ''Examination of the Plans Proposed for the East India Company's Shipping; the Great Importance of Adopting a Proper System Explained; and a Plan Suggested for Making the Ships Employed in the Commerce with Asia, Beneficial Both to the State and to the East India Company'' - London, [[John Stockdale]], 1795
* ''The Seaman's Guide: Shewing how to Live Comfortably at Sea. Containing, Among Other Particulars, Complete Directions for Baking Bread, ... Recommended Also to Public Bakers, as Well as to Private Housekeepers'' - J. Murray and S. Highley, 1797.

[[File:50th-logo.png|thumbnail|H.E. Juma Al Majid]]
'''Juma al Majid''' (born in [[Dubai]], United Arab Emirates around 1930) is an Emirati businessman, political adviser, and philanthropist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dubai: The Vulnerability of Success |last=Davidson |first=Christopher M. |page=156 |year=2009 |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |isbn=978-0-231-70035-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Al Majid is ranked among the Richest Arabs in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forbesmiddleeast.com/en/lists/people/pname/juma-al-majid/pid/13171/|title=The World's Richest Arabs|publisher=|accessdate=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
H.E. Juma Majid was born in Al Shandagah, Dubai in 1930.

Majid was introduced to the grocery business in Dubai through his uncle and continued in the same business for another two to three years until he met [[Mohammad Al Gaz]] in 1952. Al Gaz brought goods in Dubai from Kuwait and Bahrain, and Al Majid would help with the sales. In 1956, Al Qaz asked Al Majid to travel with him to Kuwait to trade in that lucrative market. The two used to take tobacco and Omani dry lime to sell in Kuwait and Bahrain and returned with goods like fabric and watches — from Switzerland and France — to sell in Dubai. The business expanded to Pakistan, India and across the Arab world into Europe, as it began to attract the support of international brands planning to enter the then [[Trucial States]]. It was around that time that Al Majid formally launched his own companies, Mohammad &amp; Juma Al Majid alongside Al Gaz's United Arab Agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/business/sectors/features/juma-al-majid-a-life-in-service-1.717158|title=A Life in Service|publisher=Gulf News|accessdate=12 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the fifties, he participated with his colleagues: Mr. Humaid Al Tayer, Abdullah Al Ghurair, Nasir Rashed Loutah, and with consent of Sheikh [[Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum]] in the establishment of the first charitable society to help the needy of Dubai, so they established two secondary schools, one for boys in [[Bur Dubai]], called Jamal Abdul Nasser Secondary School, the second for girls in Bur Deira, called Amna Secondary Schools.

The partnership between Al Majid and Al Qaz lasted 11 years.

After the UAE Federation was formed, Al Majid left the gold business as the trade and development projects the country offered greater opportunities.

In 1974, Al Gaz and Al Majid began work on establishing a [[Pepsi]] factory in Dubai, the National Cement Company, and the [[Dubai Chamber of Commerce and Industry]]. He also diversified into the carpentry and décor business. The group has since diversified further into transport and logistics, construction, food and advertising. There is also an international investment company, Al Majid Investment.

Majid established the Islamic and Arabic Studies College in 1987 in Dubai.

In 1990, Al Majid, along with Al Gaz and other local philanthropists, established the Beit Al Khair Society, a charitable organization aims to aid the poor citizens, needy students, as well as offering cash or commodities to the victims of disasters.

In 1991, Al Majid realized the needs of scholars and researchers, especially those who are unable to obtain the necessary books, references and manuscripts, so he established a public library, afterwards it was developed to become a cultural organization, known as Juma Al Majid Center for Culture and Heritage.

Over time, Al Majid went on to secure franchise rights for other international brands — in engineering, automobiles, office furniture, communication and tyres — from companies like [[Samsung]], [[Hyundai]], [[Hitachi]] and many more. He is succeeded by his heir [[Khalid Juma Al Majid]].

'''KDU University College''' (or '''KDU''') is a [[Private university|private university college]] in [[Malaysia]], with its flagship campus in Utropolis Glenmarie, Shah Alam.  Established in 1983, and a pioneer in Malaysian private education, KDU was one of the first private colleges in Malaysia to have its own purpose-built campus.&amp;nbsp;KDU offers education programmes at the Certificate, Diploma, Degree and Masters levels.

KDU is part of Paramount Education, a fully integrated education services provider for primary, secondary, tertiary, and postgraduate level studies as well as executive and professional development programmes, which also includes KDU College (Damansara Jaya Campus), [[KDU Penang University College]], KDU Management Development Centre and KDU Smart Schools (private national and international schools for primary and secondary school students)

==History==
[[File:KDU University College, Damansara Jaya campus.JPG|thumbnail|320x191px|right|KDU University College, Damansara Jaya campus.]]
Established in 1983, and a pioneer in Malaysian private education, KDU was one of the first private colleges in Malaysia to have its own purpose-built campus in [[Damansara Jaya]]. Kolej Damansara Utama (as it was first known) opened for enrolment, offering programmmes such as the GCE A-Level and the American Credit Transfer programme, and welcomed its first batch of students. In 1984, KDU introduced the first overseas twinning programme in partnership with Middlesex Polytechnic (Middlesex University), offering young Malaysians an opportunity to pursue internationally renowned programmes at a more affordable cost.

In 1991, a second branch (KDU Penang University College) was established in Penang to cater to the higher education needs of aspiring youths in the northern region.

In November 2010, KDU College was upgraded to University College status by the [[Ministry of Higher Education (Malaysia)|Ministry of Higher Education]], [[Malaysia]], and began offering specialised homegrown degree programmes. The ceremony was officiated by the Minister of Higher Education, [[Datuk Seri]] [[Mohamed Khaled Nordin]].&lt;ref name="KDU History 2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lim |first=Richard |url=http://thestar.com.my/education/story.asp?sec=education&amp;file=/2010/11/14/education/7368556 |title=Institution's new status |publisher=thestar.com.my |date=14 November 2010 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Damansara Jaya campus is now home to KDU College, offering pre-university, foundation and degree programmes from international collaborations and university partners. In line with its expansion, KDU University College moved to its all-new campus flagship campus in early 2015. The new Utropolis Glenmarie campus is designed to inspire and provide hands-on learning for real world experiences, and is part of a live-and learn, work-and-play self-contained university metropolis.

In 2016, KDU Penang University College had a groundbreaking ceremony to unveil construction plans for a 10-acre campus in Batu Kawan, Penang. The ceremony was officiated by then Chief Minister of Penang YAB Lim Guan Eng and was accompanied by representatives from Penang Development Corporations (PDC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kdupg.edu.my/news-events/kdu-penang-uc-unveils-plans-10-acre-campus-batu-kawan|title=KDU Penang UC unveils plans for 10-acre campus in Batu Kawan {{!}} KDU Penang University College|website=www.kdupg.edu.my|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Datuk Teo Chiang Quan, the Paramount Corporation Berhad Group chairman and executive director mentioned the first phase on a 4ha site would be completed in the year 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.penangpropertytalk.com/2016/02/kdu-penang-university-college-batu-kawan/|title=KDU Penang University College @ Batu Kawan|date=2016-02-29|work=Penang Property Talk|access-date=2018-07-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Batu Kawan campus is modeled after the "utropolis" in Glenmarie, Shah Alam, Selangor.

'''Microsoft Office PerformancePoint Server''' is a [[business intelligence]] [[Computer software|software]] product released in 2007 by [[Microsoft]].  The product was generally an integration of the acquisitions from [[ProClarity Corporation|ProClarity]] - the Planning Server and Monitoring Server - into Microsoft's SharePoint server product line.  Although discontinued in 2009, the dashboard, scorecard, and analytics capabilities of PerformancePoint Server were incorporated into [[Sharepoint 2010|SharePoint 2010]] and later versions.

PerformancePoint Server also provided a planning and budgeting component directly integrated with Excel.

==History==

Microsoft offered preview releases of PerformancePoint Server starting in mid-2006. Previews of the product were formed from Business Scorecard Manager 2005 and the Planning Server component. Acquisitions [[ProClarity Corporation|ProClarity]] and [[Great Plains Software|Great Plains]] brought additional analytics and planning/reporting capabilities, as well as companion products ProClarity 6.3 and [[Microsoft FRx|FRx]].

PerformancePoint Server was officially released in November 2007.

Microsoft discontinued PerformancePoint Server as an independent product in 2009 and folded its dashboard, scorecard and analytics capabilities into PerformancePoint Services in SharePoint Server 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/business_intelligence/analytics/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=212902915&amp;subSection=Business+Intelligence |title=Microsoft Makes Sweeping Changes To BI Software Strategy |date=January 27, 2009 |last=Weier |first=Mary Hayes |work=[[InformationWeek]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monitoring Server Component==
Business monitoring capabilities, including dashboards, scorecards &amp; key performance indicators, navigable reports for deeper analysis, strategy maps, and linked filtering, are provided by PerformancePoint's Monitoring Server component. A Dashboard Designer application that is distributed from Monitoring Server enables business analysts or IT Administrators to:

* create &amp; test data source connections
* create views that use those data connections
* assemble the views into a dashboard
* deploy the dashboard as a [[SharePoint]] page

Dashboard Designer saved content and security information back to the Monitoring Server. Data source connections, such as OLAP cubes or relational tables, were also made through Monitoring Server.
 
After a dashboard has been published to the Monitoring Server database, it would be deployed as a SharePoint page and shared with other users as such. When the pages were opened in a web browser, Monitoring Server updated the data in the views by connecting back to the original data sources.

==Planning Server Component==
PerformancePoint's Planning Server component supported maintenance of logical business models, budget &amp; approval workflows, enterprise data sources, and it followed [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles]].

Planning Server made use of Excel for input and line-of-business reporting, as well as SQL Server for storing and processing business models.

==Management Reporter Component==
The Management Reporter component was designed to perform financial reporting and can read PerformancePoint Planning models directly. A development kit was also available to allow this component to read other models .{{which|date=August 2013}}

[[File:Misuse restaurant model.svg|thumb|320px|Example of the Misuse case principle, which could be used in thinking about capturing security requirements.]]
'''Misuse case''' is a [[business process modeling]] tool used in the software development industry. The term ''Misuse Case'' or ''mis-use case'' is derived from and is the inverse of [[use case]].&lt;ref name="SA01"&gt;Sindre and Opdahl (2001). "[http://folk.uio.no/nik/2001/21-sindre.pdf Capturing Security Requirements through Misuse Cases]"&lt;/ref&gt; The term was first used in the 1990s by Guttorm Sindre of the [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]], and [[Andreas L. Opdahl]] of the [[University of Bergen]], Norway. It describes the process of executing a malicious act against a system, while  use case can be used to describe any action taken by the system.&lt;ref name="SA04"&gt;Sindre and [[Andreas Lothe Opdahl|Opdahl]] (2004)."[http://www.idi.ntnu.no/emner/tdt4237/papers/Paper3_SecReq_MisuseCases.pdf Eliciting security requirements with misuse cases] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716031510/http://www.idi.ntnu.no/emner/tdt4237/papers/Paper3_SecReq_MisuseCases.pdf |date=2011-07-16 }}"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
[[Use case]]s specify required behaviour of software and other products under development, and are essentially structured stories or [[scenarios]] detailing the normal behavior and usage of the software. A Misuse Case on the other hand highlights something that should not happen (i.e. a Negative Scenario) and the threats hence identified, help in defining new requirements, which are expressed as new Use Cases.

This modeling tool has several strengths:
* It allows you to provide equal weightage to functional and non-functional requirements (e.g. security requirements, platform requirements, etc.), which may not be possible with other tools.
* It makes you focus on security from the beginning of the design process and it allows you to avoid premature design decisions.
* It is a very good tool for improving communication between developers and stakeholders and is valuable in ensuring that both agree on critical system solutions and Trade-off analysis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://easyweb.easynet.co.uk/~iany/consultancy/misuse_cases/misuse_cases_in_tradeoffs.htm Initial Industrial Experience of Misuse Cases in Trade-Off Analysis (2002, by Ian Alexander)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430124410/http://easyweb.easynet.co.uk/~iany/consultancy/misuse_cases/misuse_cases_in_tradeoffs.htm |date=2008-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Creating misuse cases often trigger a chain reaction which eases the identification of functional and non-functional requirements. The discovery of a misuse case will often leads to the creation of a new use case which acts as a counter measure. This in turn might be the subject of a new misuse case.&lt;ref name="easyweb.easynet.co.uk"&gt;[http://easyweb.easynet.co.uk/~iany/consultancy/misuse_~cases/misuse_cases.htm Misuse cases help to elicit non-functional requirements (2003, by Ian Alexander)]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* As compared to other tools, It relates better to use cases and [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] and eases the seamless employment of the model.

Its biggest weakness is its simplicity. It needs to be combined with more powerful tools to establish an adequate plan for the execution of a project.&lt;ref name="easyweb.easynet.co.uk"/&gt; One other weakness is its lack of structure and semantics.

===From use to misuse case===
In an industry it is important to describe a system's behavior when it responds to a request that originates from outside : the use cases &lt;ref name="SA08"&gt;Jacobson, "Object-oriented software engineering: a use case driven approach", 1992 Addison-Wesley, Boston&lt;/ref&gt; have become popular for requirements &lt;ref name="SA01"/&gt; between the engineers thanks to its features like the visual modeling technique, they describe a system from an actor's viewpoint and its format explicitly conveys each actor's goals and the flows the system must implement to accomplish them.&lt;ref name="SA09"&gt;Gunnar Peterson, John Steven "Defining Misuse within the Development Process", IEEE SECURITY &amp; PRIVACY, NOVEMBER/DECEMBER 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The level of abstraction of a [[Use case diagram|use case model]] makes it an appropriate starting point for design activities, thanks to the use of [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] use case diagrams and the end user's or domain expert's language. But for software security analyses, the developers should pay attention to negative scenarios and understand them. That is why, in the 1990s, the concept of "inverse of an use case" was born in [[Norway]].

The contrast between the misuse case and the [[use case]] is the goal: the misuse case describes potential system behaviors that a system’s stakeholders consider unacceptable or, as Guttorm Sindre and Andreas L. Opdahl said, "a function that the system should not allow".&lt;ref name="SA01"/&gt;
This difference is also in the scenarios: a "positive" scenario is a sequence of actions leading to a Goal desired by a person or organization, while a "negative" one is a scenario whose goal is desired not to occur by the organization in question or desired by a hostile agent (not necessarily human).&lt;ref name="SA10"&gt;Ian Alexander "Misuse case : use cases with hostile intent", presentation&lt;/ref&gt;

Another description of the difference is by &lt;ref name="SA11"&gt;Guttorm Sindre, Andreas L. Opdahl, "Templates for Misuse Case Description"&lt;/ref&gt; that defines a use case as a completed sequence of actions which gives increased value to the user, one could define a misuse case as a completed sequence of actions which results in loss for the organization or some specific stakeholder.

Between the "good" and the "bad" case the language to represent the scenario is common: the use case diagrams are formally included in two modeling languages defined by the [[Object Management Group|OMG]]: the [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML) and the [[Systems Modeling Language]] (SysML), and this use of drawing the agents and misuse cases of the scenario explicitly helps focus attention
on it.&lt;ref name="SA12"&gt;Ian Alexander "Misuse case : use cases with hostile intent"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Area of use===
Misuse case are most commonly used in the field of security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Asoke K. Talukder|author2=Manish Chaitanya|title=Architecting Secure Software Systems|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=ntsJqzfwFhkC&amp;pg=PA47|accessdate=5 October 2016|date=17 December 2008|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4200-8784-0|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the ever-growing importance of IT system, it has become vital for every company to develop capability to protect its data.&lt;ref name="JohanssonRiley2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jesper M. Johansson|author2=Steve Riley|title=Protect Your Windows Network: From Perimeter To Data|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yZX2uAoAagwC&amp;pg=PA491|accessdate=5 October 2016|date=27 May 2005|publisher=Addison-Wesley Professional|isbn=978-0-321-33643-9|page=491}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hence, for example a misuse case might be used to define what a hacker would want to do with the system and define his or her requirements. A developer or designer can then define the requirements of the user and the hacker in the same UML diagram which in turn helps identify the security risks of the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Asoke K. Talukder|author2=Manish Chaitanya|title=Architecting Secure Software Systems|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=ntsJqzfwFhkC&amp;pg=PA50|accessdate=5 October 2016|date=17 December 2008|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4200-8784-0|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic concepts==
A misuse case diagram is created together with a corresponding use case diagram. The model introduces 2 new important entities (in addition to those from the traditional use case model, ''use case'' and ''actor'':
* ''Misuse case'' : A sequence of actions that can be performed by any person or entity in order to harm the system.
* ''Misuser'' : The actor that initiates the misuse case. This can either be done intentionally or inadvertently.

===Diagrams===
The misuse case model makes use of those relation types found in the use case model; ''include'', ''extend'', ''generalize'' and ''association''. In addition, it introduces two new relations to be used in the diagram:

;mitigates: A use case can mitigate the chance that a misuse case will complete successfully.
;threatens: A misuse case can threaten a use case, e.g. by exploiting it or hinder it from achieving its goals.

These new concepts together with the existing ones from use case give the following meta model, which is also found as fig. 2 in Sindre and Opdahl (2004).&lt;ref name="SA04"/&gt;

===Descriptions===
There are two different ways of describing a misuse case textual; one is embedded in a use case description template - where you add an extra description field called '''Threats'''. This is the field where you fill in your misuse case steps (and alternate steps). This is referred to as the ''lightweight'' mode of describing a misuse case.

The other way of describing a misuse case, is by using a separate template for this purpose only. It is suggested to inherit some of the field from use case description ('''Name''', '''Summary''', '''Author''' and '''Date'''). It also adapts the fields '''Basic path''' and '''Alternative path''', where they now describe the paths of the misuse cases instead of the use cases. In addition to there, it is proposed to use several other fields too:
* Misuse case name
* Summary
* Author
* Date
* Basic path
* Alternative paths
* Mitigation points
* Extension points
* Triggers
* Preconditions
* Assumptions
* Mitigation guarantee
* Related business rules
* Potential misuser profile
* Stakeholders and threats
* Terminology and explanations
* Scope
* Abstraction level
* Precision level

As one might understand, the list above is too comprehensive to be completely filled out every time. Not all the fields are required to be filled in at the beginning, and it should thus be viewed as a living document. There has also been some debating whether to start with diagrams or to start with descriptions. The recommendation given by Sindre and Opdahl on that matter is that it should be done as with use cases. Do it the way you feel most familiar with, since both variants each have their strengths and their weaknesses.

Sindre and Opdahl proposes the following 5 steps for using misuse cases to identify security requirements:
# ''Identify critical assets'' in the system
# ''Define security goals'' for each assets
# ''Identify threats'' to each of these security goals, by identifying the stakeholders that may want to cause harm to the system
# ''Identify and analyze'' risks for the threats, using techniques like [[Risk Assessment]]
# ''Define security requirements'' for the risks.
It is suggested to use a repository of reusable misuse cases as a support in this 5-step process.

==Research==

===Current field of research===
Current research on misuse cases are primarily focused on the security improvements they can bring to a project, software projects in particular. Ways to increase the widespread adoption of the practice of misuse case development during earlier phases of application development are being considered: the sooner you find a flaw, the easier it is to find a patch and the lower the impact is on the final cost of the project.

Other research focuses on improving the misuse case to achieve its final goal: for &lt;ref name="SA05"&gt;Raimundas Matulevičius, Nicolas Mayer, Patrick Heymans, "Alignment of Misuse Cases with Security Risk Management"&lt;/ref&gt; "there is a lack on the application process, and the results are too general and can cause a under-definition or misinterpretation of their concepts". They suggest furthermore "to see the misuse case in the light of a reference model for ''information system security risk management'' (ISSRM)" to obtain a security risk management process.

===Future improvement===
The misuse cases are well known by the population of researchers. The body of research on the subject demonstrate the knowledge, but beyond the academic world, the misuse case has not been broadly adopted.

As Sindre and Opdahl (the parents of the misuse case concept) suggest: "Another important goal for further work is to facilitate broader industrial adoption of misuse cases".&lt;ref name="SA04"/&gt; They propose, in the same article, to embed the misuse case in a usecase modeling tool and to create a "database" of standard misuse cases to assist software architects. System stakeholders should create their own misuse case charts for requirements that are specific to their own problem domains. Once developed, a knowledge database can reduce the amount of standard security flaws used by lambda hackers.

Other research focused on possible missing concrete solutions of the misuse case: as &lt;ref name="SA06"&gt;Fabricio A. Braz, Eduardo B. Fernandez, Michael VanHilst, "Eliciting Security Requirements through Misuse Activities"&lt;/ref&gt; wrote "While this approach can help in a high level elicitation of security requirements, it does not show how to associate the misuse cases to legitimate behavior and concrete assets; therefore, it is not clear what misuse case should be considered, nor in what context". These criticisms might be addressed with the suggestions and improvements presented in the precedent section.

Standardization of the misuse case as part of the UML notation might allow it to become a mandatory part of project development. "It might be useful to create a specific notation for security functionality, or countermeasures that have been added to mitigate vulnerabilities and threats."&lt;ref name="SA07"&gt;Lillian Røstad, "An extended misuse case notation: Including vulnerabilities and the insider threat"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''NxTier''', is an [[application service provider|ASP]] company that provided software solutions to the [[logistics]] and [[supply chain]] industry. Using their VSC platform, the industry has visibility and control of their data virtually anywhere in the world at any time. The VSC platform is an [[application service provider|ASP]] application deployed over the [[Internet]].
The platform allows logistic and supply chain industry providers to schedule and dispatch [[transportation management system]], accept and transmit [[Electronic Data Interchange|EDI]], provide Web tracking functionality, manage orders with the [[order management system|OMS]] , perform [[business analytics]] and consolidate and optimize orders and loads.

The system was originally created specifically for the [[third-party logistics]] (3PL) market. Later it was quickly adopted by the specialized delivery, home delivery and the [[less than truckload]] (LTL) markets. Today it has furthered it reach to full [[truckload carrier]] market, the service industry; dispatch and scheduling, retail build out, appliance and furniture as well as retail replenishment. As the internet became a more reliable platform NxTier positioned its VSC platform to compete in the EDI space to reduce or eliminate [[value added network]] (VAN) based fees.

Dr. '''Pierre De Muelenaere''' (born 25 October 1958) is a [[Belgium|Belgian]] entrepreneur&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.belgium.be/en/investing_in_belgium/about_belgium/famous_belgian_entrepreneurs/ |title=Famous Belgian entrepreneurs - Investing in Belgium |publisher=Business.belgium.be |date= |accessdate=2012-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uwe.be/publications/dynamisme-wallon/derniers-numeros/DW_1207.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and scientist. In 1987, after he received its Ph.D. in [[Applied Science]] from the [[Université Catholique de Louvain]], he created the Belgian company IRIS with the financial help of the Belgian holding company [[Ackermans &amp; van Haaren]]. Pierre De Muelenaere has been leading IRIS through all its development steps as President and CEO of the company. In 1999, the company was introduced on the stock market (Euronext). In 2008, the company, which has become a world-wide leader in the field of [[Automatic identification and data capture|Intelligent Document Capture]] and [[Document management system|Document Management]] had a staff of more than 500 people, with a revenue of more than €100 million.

In 2009, Pierre De Muelenaere initiated a strategic partnership with [[Canon Inc.|Canon]] and a first investment of 17% of Canon in IRIS.

In 2012, Pierre De Muelenaere negotiated the full takeover of IRIS by Canon.

The company was the delisted from the stock market.

Until the end of 2015, Pierre De Muelenaere remained President &amp; CEO of IRIS and focused on the development of new technological and commercial partnerships with Canon.

At the end of 2015, he decided to leave the company to start new projects.

He has published a book on the IRIS adventure called ''"The IRIS Book: a 33 years story on Entrepreneurship from Belgium and what you can learn about it"'' (www.iris-book.com) This book is intended to share experience with the new generation of entrepreneurs.

He has also started new project such as coach at the Yncubator (www.yncubator.be, the incubator for students-entrepreneurs at the Université Catholique de Louvain), member of the investment committee at the QBIC Venture Capital fund (www.qbic.be, a fund financing spin-offs of several Belgian universities), etc..

== Education ==
Pierre De Muelenaere was born in [[Brussels]]. He received a civil engineering Degree in Electronics from the [[Université Catholique de Louvain]] in 1981 and a [[PhD]] in Applied science in 1987, from the same university.

== Career ==
Pierre De Muelenaere original background is [[Integrated circuit design]] and Artificial Intelligence. During his PhD, he has developed new [[CPU design|microprocessor architectures]] dedicated to very fast [[Digital image processing|Image Processing and Recognition]]. A prototype of a complete [[Optical Character Recognition|OCR]] system was also built in the University labs, based on a new generation of custom Image Processing ICs.
With the support of the Belgian holding [[Ackermans &amp; van Haaren]], and together with a fellow PhD student Jean-Didier Legat, Pierre founded IRIS (Image Recognition Integrated Systems) in April 1987, to bring this invention to the market, develop and market [[Optical character recognition]] (OCR) and [[Automatic identification and data capture|Intelligent Document Recognition]] ([[Automatic identification and data capture|IDR]]) products.

In 1992, Pierre De Muelenaere and {{Interlanguage link multi|Pierre Rion|fr}} performed a [[Management buyout]] I.R.I.S.
In 1999, I.R.I.S. was introduced on the Brussels Stock Exchange, ([[Brussels Stock Exchange|BXS]], now [[NYSE Euronext]]) and received the "1999 Best Belgian IPO Award" from BXS. I.R.I.S. has now more than 500 people, with offices in Belgium, Luxembourg, France, Germany, The Netherlands, Norway, USA and Hong-Kong. In 2008, the revenue was over €100millions.
Over the years, De Muelenaere has been a main contributor to the R&amp;D vision of I.R.I.S. and has contributed to the development of many new I.R.I.S. technologies and products and to a number of patents filed by the company.  He also accumulated a solid international experience establishing strategic agreements with international partners in the USA, Europe and Asia (such as HP, Canon, Kodak, Adobe, Fujitsu, Siemens, ...) contributing to the development of I.R.I.S. in the USA and Asia.

Pierre De Muelenaere has received several Belgian awards including: two innovation awards from the [[Walloon Region]] (1989 and 2007), the "2001 Manager of the year award" from Trends,&lt;ref&gt;ftp://ftp02.irislink.com/support/oa/opt/press_reviews/trends-manager%20delannee.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the "2002 Entrepreneur of the year award",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irislink.com/c2-923-48/entreprise1.aspx |title=entreprise1 |publisher=Irislink.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; the "2008 ICT personality of the year award" from DataNews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://datanews.levif.be/ict/actualite/apercu/2008/04/le-secteur-it-sous-les-feux-de-la-rampe/article-1194718340403.htm |title=Le secteur IT sous les feux de la rampe - Datanews.be |publisher=Datanews.levif.be |date=2008-04-25 |accessdate=2012-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://datanews.knack.be/ict/nieuws/nieuwsoverzicht/2008/04/loftrompet-voor-de-ict-sector/article-1194718340170.htm |title=Loftrompet voor de ict-sector - Datanews.be |publisher=Datanews.knack.be |date=2008-04-25 |accessdate=2012-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been President and CEO of IRIS Group until the end of 2015, and a member of the board of several companies, including: [[BSB International SA|BSB]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsb.com/|title=IT service and financial software provider – BSB|work=IT service and financial software provider – BSB}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Belgacom|Proximus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belgacom.be/|title=Proximus.be - Official website of Proximus|work=belgacom.be}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pairi Daiza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pairidaiza.eu|title=Accueil - Pairi Daiza|work=pairidaiza.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4362">'''Babu Ram Singh''' was a [[Indians in Fiji|Fiji Indian]] who had come to [[Fiji]] under the [[Indian indenture system|indenture system]] and was one of the few people who, after indenture, prospered and made an attempt to help his less fortunate ex-indentured brethren. Babu Ram Singhs surviving Business, [[Fiji Rubber Stamp Co Ltd]] is still under operation in Mark Street, [[Suva]], and is looked after by his children.

== Successful businessman ==
There were few roads in Fiji around 1900 and the main form of transportation was by boat. Ram Singh saw this as a business opportunity, acquired a launch and started providing passenger and cargo facilities to communities living along the coasts of the islands of Fiji and along the banks of its numerous rivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sanadhya | first = Totaram| title = My twenty-one years in the Fiji Islands | publisher = Fiji Museum| year = 1991 | isbn = 982-208-003-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Leadership through Indian Imperial Association ==
Ram Singh was one of the founding members of the Indian Imperial Association of Fiji (IIA) and together with [[Totaram Sanadhya]] was instrumental in persuading [[Mahatma Gandhi]] to send an Indian lawyer, [[Manilal Doctor]], to Fiji. Manilal arrived in 1912 and took up the leadership of the IIA, as President and Ram Singh became its Secretary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gillion | first = K.L.| title = Fiji's Indian Migrants: A history to the end of indenture in 1920 | publisher = Oxford University Press| year = 1962 | isbn = 0-19-550452-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[Indian Imperial Association of Fiji]] (I.I.A.) came into existence in Fiji on 2 June 1918. The association contained mainly educated Fiji Indians. It sent petitions to the Government seeking review of marriage law, an end to the death penalty and representation into the Legislative Council. The aim of the association was to ‘watch the interests of and to assist in the general improvement of the Indian community in Fiji’. As president of the I.I.A., Manilal Doctor wrote to [[Mahatma Gandhi]], other Indian leaders and the [[British Labour Party]] on the sad plight of Indian indentured labourers in Fiji. C.F. Andrews and W.W. Pearson were dispatched to Fiji to enquire into the complaints. Manilal Doctor made submissions for their report, published on 29 February 1916, which reported on the deplorable living conditions of the indentured labourers and their lack of access to education and medical facilities.

Ram Singh remained an active member of the IIA and in 1919 joined in the campaign to stop the resumption of the indenture system. Ram Singh and Manilal Doctor organised a conference, of Fiji Indians, in [[Suva]] on 26 December 1919, which passed resolutions highlighting the difficulties being faced by Indians in Fiji. The Government tried to ignore the IIA, but it led to the strike of Indian labourers which began on 15 January 1920. As a result of the strike, Manilal was deported from Fiji and the IIA collapsed. In 1924, Ram Singh tried to revive the IIA as the Indian Association of Fiji, with representatives from all sections of the Indian community and with the aims of moral social educational and political uplift of the Indians. The IIA made representations to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, but was ignored and became ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gillion | first = K.L.| title = The Fiji Indians: Challenge to European Dominance 1920 - 1946| publisher = Australian National University Press| year = 1977 | isbn = 0-7081-1291-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Member of Arya Samaj in Fiji ==
Ram Singh was a member of the Arya Samaj in Fiji. He was the printer and publisher of the Hindi language newspaper, ''Fiji Samachar'' and together with [[Vishnu Deo]] (who was the editor) was involved in conflict with other sections of the Indian community as a result of which he was sued for [[libel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gillion | first = K.L.| title = The Fiji Indians: Challenge to European Dominance 1920 - 1946| publisher = Australian National University Press| year = 1977 | isbn = 0-7081-1291-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year before his death Pratt was Australia's fourth-richest person, with a personal fortune valued at {{A$|5.48}}&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chappell|first=Trevor|title=Alan Bond makes BRW rich list comeback|work=Australian Associated Press|publisher=News Limited|date=28 May  2008|url=http://www.news.com.au/business/story/0,23636,23772566-462,00.html|accessdate=29 April 2009|archivedate=20 February 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220132140/http://news.com.au/business/story/0,23636,23772566-462,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Ryszard Przecicki was born in the Free City of Danzig (present-day [[Gdańsk|Gdańsk, Poland]]) to [[Jewish]] parents Leon and Paula on 10&amp;nbsp;December&amp;nbsp;1934.&lt;ref name="birth"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/inquirer/the-great-enabler/story-e6frg6z6-1225704689901|title=Richard Pratt, the great enabler|newspaper=The Australian|date=29 April 2009|publisher=News Limited|access-date=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family immigrated to Australia in 1938 seeking safe refuge from the Nazis and settled in [[Shepparton, Victoria]], changing their surname from Przecicki to Pratt. Pratt had a rough journey travelling to Australia without getting caught by the Nazis. The family faced food shortages en route. Pratt was educated at Grahamvale Primary School, [[Shepparton High School]] and [[University High School, Melbourne|University High School]] and enrolled in a Bachelor of Commerce degree at the [[University of Melbourne]] in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unimelb.edu.au/ExecServ/honcausa/citation/pratt.html|accessdate=17 March 2007|title=Richard Pratt profile|year=2004|publisher=University Secretary's Office, [[University of Melbourne]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829195748/http://www.unimelb.edu.au/ExecServ/honcausa/citation/pratt.html|archivedate=29 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played [[Australian rules football]], as a ruckman. After starting his career at Lemnos (now the [[Shepparton Swans Football Club|Shepparton Swans]]), Pratt played for [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] in the [[Victorian Football League (1897–1989)|Victorian Football League]]'s (VFL) under-19s competition. He was awarded the [[Morrish Medal]] in 1953 for being deemed the "[[best and fairest]]" U-19 player that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Morrish Medal|work=AFL|publisher=Bigpond|url=http://www.afl.com.au/morrish%20medal/tabid/270/default.aspx|accessdate=28 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pratt did not continue his footballing career to senior VFL level, instead focusing on other interests.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Pratt combined study with acting with the [[Melbourne Theatre Company|Union Theatre Repertory Company]] and working as salesman for the family business, [[Visy Industries|Visy Board]]. After touring London and New York in 1957 with a production of [[Ray Lawler]]'s ''[[Summer of the Seventeenth Doll]]'', playing the role of Johnnie Dowd, he returned to Melbourne and Visy. Following the death of his father Leon in February 1969 Pratt took over his father's business, which at that time had several hundred employees and an annual turnover of [[Australian dollar|A$]]5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Visy History|publisher=Visy|url=http://www.visy.com.au/?id=90|accessdate=29 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career==
Under Pratt's direction, Visy expanded from two factories in Melbourne to more than 55 plants across Australia, United States, New Zealand, and [[Papua New Guinea]]. From cardboard boxes and packaging, Visy moved into waste [[paper recycling]]. Later in the 1990s Pratt expanded his operations considerably into the [[New York (state)|New York]] waste paper business.

In 1993 the [[National Crime Authority of Australia|National Crime Authority]] (NCA) raided Pratt's offices in connection with an investigation into businessman [[John Dorman Elliott|John Elliott]]'s foreign exchange dealings and Elliott's spoiling domestic stake in [[Broken Hill Proprietary Company]] (BHP, now BHP Billiton) while Elliott's company, [[Elders IXL]], was insolvent.&lt;ref name="Boxed-in billionaire"&gt;{{cite news|title=Boxed-in billionaire|publisher=News.com.au|date=22 December 2005|work=The Australian|page=009|first=Richard |last=Gluyas}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, NCA paid costs and returned documents seized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2005/s1536457.htm|title=Richard Pratt faces damaging investigation|work=The World Today|date=22 December 2005|first=Edmond|last=Roy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in the 1990s, Visy was ordered by the [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]] (ACCC) to pay a half million dollar fine for illegal anti-competitive behaviour.&lt;ref name="Who really foots the bill for Pratt's philanthropy?"&gt;{{cite news|last=Washington|first=Stuart|title=Who really foots the bill for Pratt's philanthropy?|newspaper=The Age|date=13 October 2007|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/business/who-really-foots-the-bill-for-pratts-philanthropy/2007/10/12/1191696178506.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap2|accessdate=29 April 2009|location=Melbourne|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105170321/http://www.theage.com.au/news/business/who-really-foots-the-bill-for-pratts-philanthropy/2007/10/12/1191696178506.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap2|archivedate=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public career==
As well as his business interests, Pratt was known for his involvement in public service, having held posts including: foundation chancellor of [[Swinburne University of Technology]], president of the [[Victorian Arts Centre]] Trust, and Chairman of the Board of Management of the [[Mental Health Research Institute (Melbourne)|Mental Health Research Institute of Victoria]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Through the [[Pratt Foundation]], the Pratt family are among Australia's leading philanthropists donating up to A$10 million a year. Pratt was named Environmental Visionary of the Year in 1998 by the Keep Australia Beautiful Campaign.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

On 8 February 2007 he was appointed president of the [[Carlton Football Club]]. On 20 June 2008, the Carlton Football Club announced that Richard Pratt would stand aside from the club until the charges of giving false and misleading evidence to [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]] hearing were resolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Spits|first=Scott|title=Pratt stands aside as Carlton chief|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=20 June 2008|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/pratt-stands-aside-as-carlton-chief/2008/06/20/1213770889110.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303175553/http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/pratt-stands-aside-as-carlton-chief/2008/06/20/1213770889110.html|archivedate=3 March 2016|deadurl=no|accessdate=29 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pratt also donated considerable funds to both major political parties (for example A$300,000 in Financial Year 2004-5),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pratt Holdings Pty Ltd 2004/5|publisher=Australian Electoral Commission|url=http://fadar.aec.gov.au/Donor.aspx?SubmissionID=7&amp;ClientID=21894|accessdate=12 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328172911/http://fadar.aec.gov.au/Donor.aspx?SubmissionID=7&amp;ClientID=21894|archivedate=28 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to former [[Australian Prime Minister]] [[John Howard]]'s  Liberal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Murphy|first=Katharine|title=Howard to keep Pratt's donations|newspaper=The Age|date=17 August 2007|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/federalelection2007/howard-to-keep-pratt-donations/2007/10/17/1192300841137.html|accessdate=29 April 2009|location=Melbourne|archivedate=5 November 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105170353/http://www.theage.com.au/news/federalelection2007/howard-to-keep-pratt-donations/2007/10/17/1192300841137.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 an investigation by ''[[The Australian]]'' newspaper documented from internal company documents that Pratt maintained a multimillion-dollar network of advisors.&lt;ref name="Boxed-in billionaire"/&gt; This included an $8,333.33 a month fee to [[Bob Hawke]] for consultation on "Asian and government matters", $27,220.03 for travel to the US for [[Gough Whitlam]] as business advisor on overseas markets, and other sums for former state premiers [[Nick Greiner]] and [[Rupert Hamer]].&lt;ref name="Boxed-in billionaire"/&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1959, Richard Pratt married Jeanne (née Lasker), a journalist, who was also a Jewish immigrant from Poland and was born in the town of lowich in Poland 1936, and before their marriage lived in Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/life-after-richard/story-e6frf7jo-1225890005828|newspaper=Herald Sun|publisher=News Limited|title=Life after Richard|date=10 July 2010|author=Plant, Simon|accessdate=19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the success of Visy Industries, they enjoyed a lavish lifestyle, with a private jet and a range of apartments, including a penthouse at the Sherry-Netherland Hotel in New York City;&lt;ref name="obituary"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kirby|first=James|last2=Stephens|first2=Tony|title=Tycoon with an immense, combative energy|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=29 April 2009|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/obituaries/tycoon-with-an-immense-combative-energy-20090428-alzn.html?page=-1|accessdate=29 April 2009|archivedate=4 November 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104091313/http://www.smh.com.au/national/obituaries/tycoon-with-an-immense-combative-energy-20090428-alzn.html?page=-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; their main home was the historic mansion [[Raheen (estate)|Raheen]], in the Melbourne suburb of [[Kew, Victoria|Kew]],&lt;ref name="Boxed-in billionaire"/&gt; the former residence of Roman Catholic Archbishop [[Daniel Mannix]].&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt; The Pratts have had three children, [[Anthony Pratt (businessman)|Anthony]], Heloise Waislitz, who was married to businessman and Collingwood Football club Vice President [[Alex Waislitz]], and Fiona Geminder.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Another daughter, Paula, was born in 1997 to his longtime mistress, socialite Shari-Lea Hitchcock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hornery|first=Andrew|last2=Cubby|first2=Ben|title=Space invaders|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=27 June 2005|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/spike/space-invaders/2005/06/26/1119724527096.html|accessdate=29 April 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106175242/http://www.smh.com.au/news/spike/space-invaders/2005/06/26/1119724527096.html|archivedate=6 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 this affair became the subject of widespread media attention owing to a court case involving Ms Hitchcock and a nanny hired to look after her daughter. At the time, Pratt was accused of trying to pay hush money to the nanny who had launched legal action against Ms Hitchcock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Couple speak out on mistress|newspaper=The Australian|publisher=News Limited|date=7 August 2007|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,22540312-2,00.html|accessdate=29 April 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504023357/http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,22540312-2,00.html|archivedate=4 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pratt was the godfather of Deborah Beale, who is the former wife of [[Bill Shorten]] and daughter of [[Julian Beale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/mps-woes-pose-dilemma-for-billionaire/story-e6frg6nf-1111117577876|title=MP's marital woes pose dilemma for billionaire|newspaper=The Australian|publisher=News Limited|date=25 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a well-publicised battle with prostate cancer, Richard Pratt died at his Kew residence on 28 April 2009,&lt;ref name="passing"&gt;{{cite news|title=billionaire Richard Pratt dies after prostate cancer battle|work=news.com.au|date=29 April 2009|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,27574,25400857-421,00.html|accessdate=28 April 2009|archivedate=2 May 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502003023/http://www.news.com.au/story/0,27574,25400857-421,00.html|publisher=News Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; the day after all charges against him had been dropped due to his ill-health.

==Philanthropy==
He donated A$10 million every year through the [[Pratt Foundation]] to refugees, artists and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.richardpratttribute.com/ |title=Visy – For a better World |website=Richardpratttribute.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation was established in 1978 by Jeanne and Richard Pratt as a vehicle for their philanthropy. During the 1980s and 1990s, the Pratts became known in Australia for funding the arts, medical research and higher education. Since then the Pratt family has donated about A$200 million to worthy causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=Swinburne Institute of Technology|url=http://www.swinburne.edu.au/chancellery/mediacentre/alumni/news/2011/08/jeanne-pratt-awarded-honorary-doctorate|title=Jeanne Pratt awarded honorary doctorate|date=2 August 2011|accessdate=19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conviction for price fixing==
In December 2005 the ACCC commenced a civil penalty proceeding against Visy companies, Pratt, and others, for alleged involvement in a [[cartel]] in the packaging industry.&lt;ref name="Boxed-in billionaire"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|FCA|2617|2007|litigants=Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Visy Industries Holdings Pty Limited (No 3) |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 October 2007, Pratt was formally accused of [[price fixing]], cheating customers and companies out of approximately A$700 million in the nation's biggest-ever cartel case.&lt;ref name="Richard Pratt cardboard deal may have cost $700m"&gt;{{cite news|last=Binnie|first=Craig|last2=Royall|first2=Ian|last3=Whinnett|first3=Ellen|last4=Mickelburough|first4=Peter|title=Richard Pratt cardboard deal may have cost $700m|publisher=Herald Sun|date=10 August 2007|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,22560327-2862,00.html|accessdate=29 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACCC alleged "very serious contraventions" of the law and that these had been "carefully and deliberately concealed" by Visy senior executives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stewart|first=Cameron|title=Pratt buttoned up and beaten|publisher=News Limited|newspaper=The Australian|date=17 August 2007|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22599836-601,00.html|accessdate=29 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ACCC counsel further stated:&lt;blockquote&gt;''"There can be no suggestion that Visy acted in ignorance of its obligations under the act"&lt;ref name="Watchdog"&gt;{{cite news|last=Speedy|first=Blair|title=Watchdog puts $36m bite on Pratt|publisher=News Limited|newspaper=The Australian|date=17 August 2007|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22599425-5013404,00.html|accessdate=29 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;''
and further added that the deliberate use of pre-paid [[mobile phones]] that could not be traced and the holding of meetings in private homes, motel rooms and suburban parks
''&lt;blockquote&gt;"...provides a strong indication that Visy was fully aware that the conduct was illegal".&lt;ref name="Watchdog"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;''

After more than a year of denials Pratt subsequently admitted his guilt, acknowledging he and his company, and "rival" company [[Amcor]] deliberately broke the law.&lt;ref name="Richard Pratt to admit breaking law"&gt;{{cite news|last=Stewart|first=Cameron|title=Richard Pratt to admit breaking law|publisher=News Limited|newspaper=The Australian|date=6 August 2007|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22539478-601,00.html|accessdate=29 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pratt was aggrieved by the criminal prosecution and its effect on his reputation, stating:
''&lt;blockquote&gt;"I feel very angry—Visy is seen as Richard Pratt's company—there is a certain amount of character assassination for me personally because I am a tall poppy in the community; it's a big scalp (for the ACCC). My reputation is something I have been building for 50 years and so I am worried that the general public will now see me as a rich person who has made his money doing something that is wrong in the eyes of the law."&lt;ref name="Richard Pratt to admit breaking law"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;''

On 2 November 2007, Pratt and the Visy group received an A$36 million fine, representing both the largest fine in Australian history and an estimated 0.75% of the Pratt fortune.&lt;ref name="Who really foots the bill for Pratt's philanthropy?"/&gt;&lt;ref name="record"&gt;{{cite news|title=Pratt, Visy fined $36m|publisher=News Limited|newspaper=Adelaide Now|date=2 November 2007|url=http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,22690569-911,00.html|accessdate=29 April 2009|archivedate=13 April 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413015441/http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,22690569-911,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Visy in $300m cartel class action suit|publisher=NineMSN|date=29 November 2007|url=http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=72669|accessdate=29 April 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226135241/http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=72669|archivedate=26 February 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Australian Federal Court|Federal Court]] judge Justice Heerey said Pratt and his senior executives were knowingly concerned in the cartel, which involved price fixing and market sharing.&lt;ref name="record"/&gt; "''This is the worst cartel to come before the courts in 30-plus years''", Justice Heerey said. Additionally, customers of Visy initiated claims against Visy and Amcor, including a $120 million suit by [[Cadbury Schweppes]] against [[Amcor]].&lt;ref name="Who really foots the bill for Pratt's philanthropy?"/&gt;

===Criminal prosecution for impropriety===
On 19 June 2008, Pratt was charged with lying about his knowledge of a price-fixing scandal.&lt;ref name="billionaire Dick Pratt faces jail"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ross|first=Norrie|work=Herald Sun|date=20 June 2008|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,23892386-2862,00.html|accessdate=29 April 2009|title=Billionaire Dick Pratt faces jail}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pratt had been facing four separate charges under Section 5 of the Act, the penalty for each charge ranges from a fine of $2,200 to 12 months' jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2008/s2281400.htm|title=Pratt pledges to fight charges|work=[[PM (ABC radio)]]|date=20 June 2008|first=Samantha|last=Donovan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 April 2009, this criminal prosecution of Pratt for charges of impropriety (lying to the ACCC during its successful investigation into the Visy/Amcor price fixing scandal) were abandoned on account of his poor health and impending death. However, Commonwealth Prosecutor Mark Dean SC told the Federal Court the [[Department of Public Prosecutions#Australia|Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions]] (CDPP) believed the prosecution would have succeeded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prosecutor drops criminal charges against dying Richard Pratt|agency=Australian Associated Press|newspaper=The Australian|publisher=News Limited|date=27 April 2009|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/dpp-drops-charges-against-dying-pratt/story-e6frg6n6-1225704339699|accessdate=28 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pratt died the following day.

==Honours==
Pratt was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of Australia]] (AO) in 1985, and a Companion of the Order (AC) in 1998.

''For outstanding leadership in the arts, for development of opportunities for young artistic talent on stage and in the orchestral field, and for service to the community through charitable and non-profit organisations.''&lt;/ref&gt; However, he returned his awards in February 2008 after he was fined $36 million for price fixing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gazette, Special S 40|work=Commonwealth of Australia|publisher=Attorney-General's Department|date=22 February 2008|url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/file/2008GN08|accessdate=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/pratt-gives-up-honours/story-e6frf7kx-1111115636502 "Billionaire Richard Pratt surrenders Order of Australia awards"], heraldsun.com.au, 25 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 May 2007, he was awarded the [[Woodrow Wilson Awards#Woodrow Wilson Award for Corporate Citizenship|Woodrow Wilson Medal]] for [[Corporate Citizenship]].&lt;ref name="wilson"&gt;{{cite web|title=Woodrow Wilson Awards|publisher=Wilson Center|url=http://www.wilsoncenter.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=awards.awards|accessdate=29 April 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217065746/http://wilsoncenter.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=awards.awards|archivedate=17 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is given to executives who "by their examples and their business practices, have shown a deep concern for the common good beyond the bottom line.

In April 2010, to mark the first anniversary of his death, the inaugural Richard Pratt Memorial Oration was delivered at the [[University of Melbourne]] by the president of the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], Professor Menahem Ben-Sasson.

'''Rosario Messina''', ([[Aci Castello]], December 1942 – [[Meda (Italy)|Meda]], March 9, 2011), was an Italian entrepreneur, who in 1978 founded the Italian company [[Flou (Company)|Flou]], an avant-garde furniture manufacturer.

== Biography ==

'''Rosario Messina''' was born in 1942 in the [[Sicily|Sicilian]] city of [[Aci Castello]] in 1942. His father – a farmer – died when he was a young man, leaving him the responsibility of the family. He was the eldest of five children and in 1958, he began working for the [[La Rinascente]] department store in [[Catania]], first as an apprentice, then as a salesperson and finally as head of department.

Simultaneously, he attended evening courses in book-keeping and qualified in record time, managing to complete five academic years in one.

Following his experience with La Rinascente, he worked in the local branch of [[Zanussi]]-Rex, the most important Italian manufacturer of electrical appliances at that time.

In the early [[Seventies]], he was asked to work in the furniture-design sector: he joined the company C&amp;B (now B&amp;B Italia) as an account officer for [[Sicily]] and [[Calabria]]. He then moved to the north of the country as the company's sales manager. In 1976, he started working with Cinova, another leading sofa manufacturing company. He was appointed as the sales manager, responsible for general management.

His professional turning point appeared when the soft furnishings company, [[Bassetti]], assigned him a difficult task: he was asked to launch 'the [[duvet]]', a product to replace the traditional [[blanket]] for beds.

It was a difficult undertaking, and made more complex by the opposition from the furniture dealers – the elective distribution channel – who opposed commercializing a low cost product distributed through other channels. Messina had a [[Eureka (word)|Eureka]] moment and intuitively felt that 'bed with the duvet' as opposed to duvet alone would be an overwhelming success.

This ingenious idea led to the foundation of the company [[Flou (Company)|Flou]] in 1978 and the presentation of the bed  'Nathalie' designed by [[Vico Magistretti]], an article that unquestionably was the prototype of a new design direction: the modern textile bed.

Flou was a true pioneer in the 'culture of sleep' and rapidly became a leader in the world of furnishings, making an important contribution to enhancing the image of [[Italian design]] in the world.&lt;ref name="flou"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flou.it/#/azienda/fondatore|title=Flou|publisher=flou.it|accessdate=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Official appointments ===

Between 1994 and 1998, Rosario Messina was President of the Gruppo Mobili Assarredo. From 1998, he was President of Assarredo, the trade association of Federlegno-Arredo that groups together the Italian furniture and furnishing industries. He was a member of the steering committee of the Council of Federlegno-Arredo, and was appointed to the same role with the industrial confederation [[Confindustria]] [[Monza e Brianza]].

In 1999 he was appointed to the most prestigious position as President of Cosmit, the organizing body for [[Milan Furniture Fair]].&lt;ref name="ilsole24ore"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.casa24.ilsole24ore.com/art/arredamento-casa/2011-03-10/addio-rosario-messina-padre-140909.php?uuid=AaoSz0ED|title=Addio a Rosario Messina, il padre del Salone del mobile|publisher=casa24.ilsole24ore.com|accessdate=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This is the world's most important furniture exhibition and under his Presidency, the [[Milan Furniture Fair]] (and the collateral exhibitions of Euroluce (Lighting), Eurocucina (Kitchens), Salone del Bagno [Bathrooms], Salone del Complemento d'Arredo (Furnishing Accessories), Salone dell'Ufficio (Office), Salone Satellite (Collateral events) progressed from being a simple trade show to a spectacular event, with the promotion of important cultural events that consolidated Milan as the unchallengeable 'Design capital'. The Salon was transformed into a meeting place for questions and answers as well as being a platform for 360° proposals in all areas of design culture and innovation.

The last edition under his management took place in 2011: a total of 321,320 people visited the event (up 7% on 2010 and 2% on 2009) and the 'Satellite Salon' that was actively promoted by Messina; this spin-off initiative started quietly and today is the most prestigious stage for showcasing up-and-coming designers and architects from the specialist educational aspects around the world.

In June 2008, during the annual general meeting, Rosario Messina was elected President of Federlegno-Arredo, the organization of [[Confindustria]] that represents 2,300 companies in 12 associations (Assarredo [Furnishings], Assobagno [Bathrooms], Assoimballaggi [Packaging], Assolegno [Wood and Timber], Assoluce [Lighting], Assopannelli [Panels], Assufficio [Office], Edilegno [Timber houses], Fedecomlegno [The Italian National Timber Association], Asal Assoallestimenti [Stands and Layouts], Aippl [Wooden flooring and laying], Apil [Lighting]); these represent the entire section of timber-furnishings: from the raw materials to the finished product.

He was a councillor on the steering committee of the foundation 'Center for the development of Italo-Russian trade relations".

On October 30, 2008, the then president of Confundustria, [[Emma Marcegaglia]], appointed him as a delegate of  the industrial confederation  Confindustria and according to the constitution, he automatically held the position of Vice President of CFI (The Italian industrial confederation).

The '''software industry''' includes businesses  for [[software development|development]], [[software maintenance|maintenance]] and [[software publisher|publication]] of [[software]] that are using different business models, mainly either "license/maintenance based" (on-premises) or "[[Cloud computing|Cloud]] based" (such as [[SaaS]], [[PaaS]], [[IaaS]], MaaS, AaaS, etc.). The industry also includes [[software service]]s, such as [[training]], [[software documentation|documentation]], [[consultancy|consulting]] and [[data recovery]].

==History==
The word "software" was coined as a prank as early as 1953, but did not appear in print until the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Paul Niquette |title= Softword: Provenance for the Word 'Software'  |year= 1995 |url= http://www.niquette.com/books/softword/tocsoft.html }} adapted from ''Sophisticated: The Magazine'' {{ISBN|1-58922-233-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before this time, computers were programmed either by customers, or the few commercial computer vendors of the time, such as [[UNIVAC]] and [[IBM]]. The first company founded to provide software products and services was [[Computer Usage Company]] in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Recollections of the first software company |author= Elmer C. Kubie |journal= [[Annals of the History of Computing]] |volume= 16 |issue= 2 |publisher= [[IEEE Computer Society]]  |date= Summer 1994 |pages= 65–71 |doi= 10.1109/85.279238 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The software industry expanded in the early 1960s, almost immediately after computers were first sold in mass-produced quantities. Universities, government, and business customers created a demand for software. Many of these programs were written in-house by full-time staff programmers. Some were distributed freely between users of a particular machine for no charge. Others were done on a commercial basis, and other firms such as [[Computer Sciences Corporation]] (founded in 1959) started to grow. Other influential or typical software companies begun in the early 1960s included [[Advanced Computer Techniques]], [[Automatic Data Processing]], [[Applied Data Research]], and [[Informatics General]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=From Airline Reservations to Sonic the Hedgehog: A History of the Software Industry | first=Martin | last=Campbell-Kelly | authorlink=Martin Campbell-Kelly | publisher=MIT Press | location=Cambridge, Massachusetts | year=2003 | page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Computer Establishment | first=Katharine Davis | last=Fishman | publisher= McGraw-Hill Book Company | location=New York | year=1981 | type=paperback 1982 | page=268}}&lt;/ref&gt; The computer/[[Computer hardware|hardware]] makers started bundling [[operating systems]], [[systems software]] and programming environments with their machines.

When [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) brought a relatively low-priced [[microcomputer]] to market, it brought computing within the reach of many more companies and universities worldwide, and it spawned great innovation in terms of new, powerful programming languages and methodologies. New software was built for microcomputers, so other manufacturers including IBM, followed DEC's example quickly, resulting in the [[IBM AS/400]] amongst others.

The industry expanded greatly with the rise of the [[personal computer]] ("PC") in the mid-1970s, which brought desktop computing to the office worker for the first time. In the following years, it also created a growing market for games, applications, and utilities. [[DOS]], [[Microsoft]]'s first [[operating system]] product, was the dominant operating system at the time.

In the early years of the 21st century, another successful [[business model]] has arisen for hosted software, called [[software-as-a-service]], or SaaS; this was at least the third time{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} this model had been attempted. From the point of view of producers of some [[proprietary software]], SaaS reduces the concerns about [[Software copyright|unauthorized copying]], since it can only be accessed through the Web, and by definition no [[client software]] is loaded onto the end user's PC.

==Size of the industry==
According to industry analyst [[Gartner]], the size of the worldwide software industry in 2013 was US$407.3 billion, an increase of 4.8% over 2012. As in past years, the largest four software vendors were [[Microsoft]], [[Oracle Corporation]], [[IBM]], and [[SAP SE|SAP]] respectively.

|url=http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2696317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mergers and acquisitions==
The software industry has been subject to a high degree of consolidation over the past couple of decades. Between 1995 and 2018 around 37,039 [[mergers and acquisitions]] have been announced with a total known value of US$ 1,166 bil. USD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://imaa-institute.org/m-and-a-by-industries/|title=M&amp;A by Industries - Institute for Mergers, Acquisitions and Alliances (IMAA)|work=Institute for Mergers, Acquisitions and Alliances (IMAA)|access-date=2018-02-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest number and value of deals was set in 2000 during the high times of the [[dot-com bubble]] with 2,674 transactions valued at 105. bil. USD. In 2017, 2,547 deals were announced valued at $111 billion. Approaches to successfully acquire and integrate software companies are available. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Popp |first=Karl Michael |title=Mergers and Acquisitions in the Software Industry - foundations of due diligence |year=2013 |publisher=Books on demand |location=Norderstedt |isbn=978-3-7322-4381-5 |url=http://mergerduediligence.com/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6713">'''Test and Learn''' is a set of practices followed by retailers, banks and other consumer-focused companies to test ideas in a small number of locations or customers to predict impact. The process is often designed to answer three questions about any tested program before rollout: 

# What impact will the program have on key performance indicators if executed across the network or customer base? 
# Will the program have a larger impact on some stores/customers than others? 
# Which components of the idea are actually working?

== Historical context ==

Test and Learn has been systematically applied as far back as 1988 by [[Capital One]]. Capital One has been aggressive about testing since the firm was founded, testing everything from product design to marketing to customer selection to collection policies.&lt;ref name="hbr"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/2009/02/how-to-design-smart-business-experiments|title=How to Design Smart Business Experiments|last=Davenport|first=Thomas H.|date=February 2009|newspaper=[[Harvard Business Review]]|access-date=|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|authorlink=Thomas H. Davenport}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a single year, the company performs tens of thousands of tests, allowing it to offer thousands of different types of credit cards to customers, based on the knowledge gained from their tests. Richard Fairbank, [[CEO]] of Capital One, called test and learn "a marketing revolution that can be applied to many businesses".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

* Retail banks running different commercials in different markets.
* Fast food restaurants launching a new menu item or product for a limited time in select locations 
* Big-box retailers evaluating “store of the future” programs
* Companies evaluating pricing strategies
* Retailers testing merchandising layouts across their door base
* The UK government, through research projects such as the College for Teaching and Learning's Close the Gap: Test and learn &lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/closing-the-gap-test-and-learn&lt;/ref&gt;

== Test and learn in practice ==

* [[Wawa Food Markets]], a Mid-Atlantic convenience store chain, uses Test and Learn across several aspects of its business:&lt;ref name="storesmag"&gt;{{cite news

* [[Kraft Foods]], a manufacturer and distributor of packaged foods, uses testing to optimize the placement of its products on grocery store shelves:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Test and Learn is also methodically used online to test impact of various web page layouts on user behavior. Tools such as [[Google]] Website Analyzer provide every site with the ability to test various elements and their effect on user engagement.

==Test and learn software==
There are a variety of [[Computer software|software]] tools available today to support systematic testing within an organization. However, there is currently no one software package that covers all types of tests, and in some cases significant knowledge of statistics is still required for effective analysis.&lt;ref name="hbr" /&gt;

Many companies, including [[Capital One]] and [[eBay]], have developed experiment management software within the company. Alternatives to internal solutions include broad [[statistical analysis]] software tools such as [[SAS Institute|SAS]] or test and learn focused software from [[Applied Predictive Technologies]] or MarketDial. There are also a variety of more narrowly tailored products, focused on particular problems or fields. In [[web analytics]], for example, firms such as [[Omniture]], [[WebTrends]], and [[Google]] have created specialized software.&lt;ref name="hbr" /&gt;

== Criticism ==

Companies wanting to conduct Test and Learn must mobilize, track and analyze site and customer data at very granular levels. This can often be a massive and expensive undertaking. Increasingly however, an exponential increase in computing power, and corresponding decrease in its cost, have made testing more accessible. In the [[Harvard Business Review]] February 2009 article "How to Design Smart Business Experiments",&lt;ref name="hbr" /&gt; Thomas Davenport discusses the Test and Learn Process, and describes how several companies have overcome these and other barriers to testing.

==Usage==
Oligarchs are usually defined as businessmen having direct influence on both [[Politics of Ukraine|politics]] and economy. During the 1990s, the oligarchs emerged as well-connected [[Nouveau riche|entrepreneurs who started from nearly nothing and got rich]] through participation in the market via connections to the corrupt, but democratically elected government of Ukraine during the state's transition to a [[market economy|market-based economy]]. Later numerous Ukrainian businesspeople have "taken over control" of political parties (examples of this are [[Party of Greens of Ukraine]], [[Labour Ukraine]] and [[Social Democratic Party of Ukraine (united)]]&lt;ref name=Andrew/&gt;) or started new ones to gain seats and influence in the [[Verkhovna Rada]] (Ukrainian parliament).

The rise of the oligarchs has been connected to the processes of [[privatization]] of state-owned assets. These processes usually involved the distribution of [[property title]]s of such enterprises, land, and real estate, on equal base to the whole population of the country, through instruments such as [[privatization voucher]]s, certificates, and coupons. Given the different preferences of people in relation to risk-aversity, property titles were easily re-sold. Businessmen who could provide an initial investment capital to collect such property titles could thus easily arrive to the property of whole former public holdings.

The oligarchs' influence on the [[Government of Ukraine|Ukrainian Government]] is extreme. In 2011 some analysts and Ukrainian politicians believed that some Ukrainian businesses tycoons, with "lucrative relations" with [[Russia]], were deliberately hindering [[Ukraine–European Union relations|Ukraine's European Union integration]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/119066/ EU Hopes Fade As Gas Lobby Triumphs], [[Kyiv Post]] (16 December 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Works councils exist with different names in a variety of related forms in a number of European countries, including Britain (''joint consultative committee or employees’ council''); [[Germany]] and [[Austria]] (''Betriebsrat'');&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.verdi.de/service/fragen-antworten/++co++e5a9cfae-a883-11e0-43aa-00093d114afd|title=Information about ''Betriebsrat'' in Germany (German)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.verdi.de|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.arbeiterkammer.at/service/betriebsrat/rechteundpflichtendesbetriebsrates/Rechte_und_Pflichten_des_Betriebsrates.html|title=Information about Betriebsrat in Austria (in German)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.arbeiterkammer.at|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luxembourg]] (''comité mixte'', ''délégation du personnel''); the [[Netherlands]] and [[Flanders]] in [[Belgium]] (''ondernemingsraad''); [[Italy]] (''comitato aziendale'');  [[France]] (''comité d'entreprise''); [[Wallonia]] in Belgium (''conseil d'entreprise'') and [[Spain]] (''comité de empresa'').

One of the most commonly examined (and arguably most successful) implementations of this institution is found in Germany.  The model is basically as follows:  general labour agreements are made at the national level by national unions (e.g. [[IG Metall]]) and national employer associations (e.g. [[Gesamtmetall]]), and local plants and firms then meet with works councils to adjust these national agreements to local circumstances. Works council members are elected by the company workforce for a four-year term. They don't have to be union members; works councils can also be formed in companies where neither the employer nor the employees are organized.

Works council representatives may also be appointed to the [[board of directors]].

As with [[co-determination]], there are three main views about why works councils primarily exist: to reduce workplace conflict by improving and systematising communication channels; to increase bargaining power of workers at the expense of owners by means of legislation; and to correct market failures by means of public policy.

==European Works Council==
On 22 September 1994, the [[Council of the European Union]] passed a [[European Union directive|Directive]] (94/45/EC) on the establishment of a European Works Council (EWC) or similar procedure for the purposes of informing and consulting employees in companies which operate at [[European Union]] level.

The EWC Directive applies to companies with at least 1,000 employees within the EU and at least 150 employees in each of at least two Member States.

[[European Works Council]]s were created partly as a response to increased transnational restructuring brought about by the [[Single European Act]]. They give representatives of workers from all European countries in big [[multinational companies]] a direct line of communication to top management. They also make sure that workers in different countries are all told the same thing at the same time about transnational policies and plans. Lastly, they give workers’ representatives in [[Trade union|unions]] and national works councils the opportunity to consult with each other and to develop a common European response to employers’ transnational plans, which management must then consider before those plans are implemented.

The EWC Directive was revised by the Council and the European Parliament in May 2009.  The changes contained in the new ("Recast") Directive must be transposed into national law by 5 June 2011, and have important implications for all companies in scope of the legislation, both those with an existing [[European Works Council]] and those yet to have set one up.

===France===
A comité d’entreprise (works council) is mandatory in any company with 50 employees or more. Members of the C.E. are elected by all the employees, and have 20 hours of delegation. The main role of the C.E. is being the interface between the employees and the members of the board which is constituted of the Chairman and the HR. The number of members depends of the number of people in the company. All members of the C.E. have a monthly meeting with the board, in which very specific points are dealt with.&lt;ref name="Bento 10–11"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bento|first=F|title=Interviewing member of C.E in CRO France|url=http://expatriatesmagazine.com/index.php/publication/issue-1/contents/item/149-interview-with-florence-bentolila-describing-the-comit%C3%A9-dentreprise|work=Expatriates Magazine|publisher=EP|location=Paris|pages=10–11|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===
Works councils in Germany have a long history, with their origins in the early 1920s in the post [[World War I]] [[Weimar Republic]], established by the Betriebsverfassungsgesetz or Works Council Act. Initially, unions were very skeptical of works councils, seeing them as a way for management to negotiate with employees without employing [[collective bargaining]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Inequality and Prosperity: Social Europe vs. Liberal America|last=Pontusson|first=Jonas|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2005|isbn=9780801489709|location=Ithaca and London|pages=Ch. 6|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but eventually they developed clearly defined responsibilities with works councils not allowed to organize strikes or enforce a wage increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bund-verlag.de/blog/betriebsrat/betriebsverfassungsgesetz-betrvg/|title=Das Betriebsverfassungsgesetz (BetrVG) {{!}} Nachrichten für Betriebsräte|website=www.bund-verlag.de|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years with a decline in union membership, works councils have come to be seen as a way for unions to recruit members, specifically by having works councils campaign for people to join them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Behrens|first=Martin|year=2009|title=Still Married after All These Years? Union Organizing and the Role of Works Councils in German Industrial Relations|url=|journal=Industrial and Labor Relations Review|volume=62| issue =  3|pages=275–293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, they serve two functions. The first is called [[co-determination]], through which works councils elect members of the board of directors of German companies. The second is called participation, and means that works councils must be consulted about specific issues and have the right to make proposals to management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worker-participation.eu/National-Industrial-Relations/Countries/Germany/Workplace-Representation|title=Workplace Representation / Germany / Countries / National Industrial Relations / Home - WORKER PARTICIPATION.eu|last=Cleverway|website=www.worker-participation.eu|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most impressive achievements of the councils is producing incredibly harmonious relations between management and workers, leading to a situation with strong unions and an incredibly low strike rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~ma98/pollklas/thesis/germany.html|title=Interest Group History - The Case of Capital and Labor in Germany|website=xroads.virginia.edu|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also allows for a lot of coordination between the firm and the workers, resulting in, for example, the ability of many German firms to dramatically scale back the hours of each worker without large scale layoffs during the 2008 financial crisis, and then slowly scaling back up as the recovery took effect. This was all assisted by the Kurzarbeit, a fund that helps workers who have had their hours reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dailysignal.com/2014/06/19/economic-crisis-survival-germany-shows-preparation-key/|title=How Germany Survived the Economic Crisis|date=2014-06-19|website=The Daily Signal|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Works councils in Germany have been correlated with a number of positive effects. They promote higher wages, even more than collective bargaining (although situations with both will promote wages the highest),&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Addison|first=John T. et al.|year=2010|title=German works councils and the anatomy of wages|url=|journal=Industrial and Labor Relations Review|volume=63| issue =  2|pages=247–270}}&lt;/ref&gt; they make firms more productive (although the degree to which they increase productivity can be hard to measure).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mueller|first=Steffen|year=2012|title=Works councils and establishment productivity|url=|journal=Industrial and Labor Relations Review|volume=65| issue =  4|pages=880–898}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they don’t inhibit investment or innovation.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Addison|first=John T. et al|year=2007|title=Do Works Councils Inhibit Investment?|url=|journal=Industrial and Labor Relations Review|volume=60| issue =  2|pages=187–203}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Addison|first=John T. et al|year=2001|title=Works Councils in Germany: Their Effects on Establishment Performance|url=|journal=Oxford Economic Papers|volume=53| issue =  4|pages=659–694}}&lt;/ref&gt; Works councils have also been shown to help women, [[East Germany|East German]], and foreign workers at a higher rate compared to West German men.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, they are correlated lower profitability, likely since they tend to bring higher wages, and there may not be as much benefit in smaller companies as there is in larger ones.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==United States==
In the United States, the [[National Labor Relations Board]] has held that works councils must be elected, and without interference by the employer, in order to be lawful. The simplest method is that the recognized labor union organizes the elections for works councils. A [[company union]], organized, funded or influenced by the employer, is prohibited under section 8(a)(2) of the [[National Labor Relations Act]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onlabor.org/2013/09/19/wsj-columnist-jenkins-gets-the-law-wrong-on-vw-works-council/|title=WSJ Columnist Jenkins Gets Works-Council Law Wrong}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory has been upheld in the courts; the controlling case is ''[[Electromation, Inc. v. NLRB]]'' (1994).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btlaw.com/experience/xpqExperienceDetail.aspx?xpST=ExperienceDetail&amp;experience=1228|title=Electromation, Inc. v. NLRB, Nos. 92-4129, 93-1169 (7th Cir. 1994).}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/18/us/setback-for-labor-management-teamwork-efforts.html|title=Setback for Labor-Management Teamwork Efforts|last=Presley Noble|first=Barbara|date=1992-12-18|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific and business activity==
Starting in 1998 Harth co-founded Curelight, an Israeli company, and developed Clearlight, an [[Acne vulgaris|acne]] [[phototherapy]] therapy system.&lt;ref name="Singapore Medical"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Amy Tiebel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams Samten"/&gt;

Curelight was chosen by the [[Venture capital in Israel|Israeli Venture Capital]] Association as Best [[Startup company]] of 2002 ([[Medical Devices]]). Curelight was a finalist in the contest Entrepreneur of the year 2003, (Ernst &amp; Young, Israel).

Harth was also a pioneer in the development of other novel devices for dermatological treatment among them the patented invention in the field of targeted multi–wavelength phototherapy for [[psoriasis]] and [[Vitiligo]].&lt;ref name="Singapore Medical"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Amy Tiebel"/&gt;

In 2007 Harth co-founded Endymed Medical and Israeli company specializing in multisource [[radiofrequency]] devices for the professional and home use markets. Harth and his co-founder developed the first ever radiofrequency technology that uses 6 phase controlled generators.&lt;ref&gt;Novel Multi-Source Phase-Controlled Radiofrequency Technology for Nonablative and Micro-Ablative Treatment of Wrinkles, Lax Skin and Acne Scars ''Laser Therapy''. 2011, Vol. 20, NO. 2, p.139-144.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sean McKinney"&gt;McKinney, Sean.
