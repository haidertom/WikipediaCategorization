'''Bhakta Bir Singh Tuladhar''' ([[Devanagari]]: भक्तवीरसिंह तुलाधर) (1912 - 1989) was a Nepalese merchant and philanthropist. He held a special [[Samyak]] (सम्यक) ceremony in 1952 when the country was passing through a political crisis, and the Buddhist alms-giving festival became of crucial importance for both sides in the power struggle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last=|title=Regmi Research Series|page=60 |date=1968 |work=Regmi Research Series, Issues 1-99 |url=https://books.google.com.np/books?ei=RSj-UdCjFcPorQf63YD4DQ&amp;id=8ghDAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=samyak+1952&amp;q=samyak+1952#search_anchor |location = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Business in Tibet==

Bhakta Bir Singh was born to father Samyak Singh (also known as Samek Ratna)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= von Fürer Haimendorf |first=Christoph |date=1966 |title=Caste and Kin in Nepal, India and Ceylon: Anthropological Studies in Hindu-Buddhist Contact Zones |url=https://books.google.com.np/books/about/Caste_and_Kin_in_Nepal_India_and_Ceylon.html?id=dZE9AAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y |publisher=Asia Publishing House |page=128 |accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and mother Sānu Māyā [[Tuladhar]] in [[Kathmandu]]. The family home was located at Nhyokhā (न्ह्योखा), a neighborhood in the historical section of Kathmandu. He was married to Laxmi Hirā [[Kansakar]], and was popularly known as Bhagat Sāhu.

The Tuladhars owned a business house in [[Lhasa]], and following in the footsteps of his merchant ancestors, Bhakta Bir Singh went to [[Tibet]] to manage the family shop at a young age. He divided his time between Kathmandu, Lhasa and [[Kalimpong]] in India, a trade center and staging point for mule caravans to Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tuladhar|first=Kamal Ratna|publisher=Lijala &amp; Tisa |year=2011 |page=109 |title=Caravan to Lhasa: A Merchant of Kathmandu in Traditional Tibet |edition=2nd |url= |accessdate=|isbn=99946-58-91-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Samyak and the revolution==

Bhakta Bir Singh's father Samyak Singh had made a pledge in 1950 to sponsor a special Samyak next year, and issued invitations to the ceremony, but he died while the preparations were being made. His sons went ahead with the arrangements to hold it as scheduled. However, the Nepalese revolution broke out, and their plans got caught in the middle. Since Samyak requires the presence of the head of state, Bhakta Bir Singh and his brothers were put in a difficult position regarding whom to invite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Gautama |first= Rājeśa |editor-first= |editor-last= |title= Nepali Congress |url= |publisher= Adroit Publishers |date= 2005 |page=367 | isbn=9788187392613}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In November 1950, [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|King Tribhuvan]] went into exile in [[New Delhi]], [[India]] in an attempt to bring down the [[Rana dynasty|Rana regime]] which held real power in the country. The Ranas then made his grandson [[Gyanendra of Nepal|Gyanendra]] the king.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nepalresearch.com/history/background/revolution_1950.htm |title= The Revolution of 1950/51 |last= Kraemer |first= Karl-Heinz |date= |website= |publisher= Nepal Research |accessdate=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They pressed Bhakta Bir Singh to hold Samyak with Gyanendra presiding over it in order to grant him cultural endorsement. The freedom fighters, meanwhile, threatened him not to do so. Bhakta Bir Singh found a way out of the dilemma by citing his father's recent death and deferring the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tuladhar |first=Daman Raj |editor-first= |editor-last= |title=Contemporary Nepal, 1945-1955 |url=https://books.google.com.np/books?ei=w88MUqHXCsPSrQfzvICoBQ&amp;id=Qe8cAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=samyak+daya+bir+singh&amp;q=daya+bir+singh#search_anchor |publisher=Laxmi Publications |date=1980 |page=243 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Ranas were overthrown in February 1951, and Tribhuvan returned to Nepal. A year later, the postponed Samyak was held on 15 January 1952 with Tribhuvan presiding over it. A stone [[mandala]] was installed at the venue at [[Bhuikhel]] to commemorate the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Shakya |first= Hem Raj |publisher= Svayambhu Vikash Mandala |year=2004 |page=617 |title= Sri Svayambhu Mahacaitya |edition=1st |url= |accessdate=|isbn=99933-864-0-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The religious celebration was seen as an affirmation of the king's triumph in the power struggle against the hereditary prime ministers the Ranas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |editor-first= Katia |editor-last= Buffetrille |title= Revisiting Rituals in a Changing Tibetan World |url=https://books.google.com.np/books?id=hfAkbA89Lp0C&amp;dq=samyak+tribhuvan&amp;q=232#v=snippet&amp;q=232&amp;f=false |publisher= BRILL |date= 2012 |page=232 | isbn=9789004232174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Samyak commemorates the practice of giving to the Buddhas and monks in the [[Newar Buddhism|Newar Buddhist]] tradition. It is spread over three days, and is held at [[Kathmandu Durbar Square]] and the field at the foot of [[Swayambhu]] hill. During the ceremony, hundreds of images of [[Dīpankara Buddha]] are assembled, and gifts of different types of food are made to the deities and the Buddhist community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Lewis |first= Todd Thornton |authorlink= |title= Popular Buddhist Texts from Nepal: Narratives and Rituals of Newar Buddhism |url= https://books.google.com.np/books?id=pC_XoZsvBuIC&amp;pg=PA225&amp;dq=samyak+nepal&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2uj7UeXdOs2krQfIrIHgCA&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=samyak%20nepal&amp;f=false |accessdate=8 August 2013 |year=2000 |publisher= State University of New York Press |location= |isbn= |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lewis|first=Todd T. |title=Notes on the Uray and the Modernization of Newar Buddhism |url=http://www.thlib.org/static/reprints/contributions/CNAS_23_01_08.pdf |accessdate=8 August 2013 |newspaper=Contributions to Nepalese Studies |date=January 1996}} Page 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1909">A '''boilery''' or '''boiling house''' is a place of [[boiling]], much as a [[bakery]] is a place of baking.  Boilery can also mean the process and equipment for boiling. Although they are now generally confined to factories, and usually boil industrial products rather than food, historically they were more common in daily life. Boileries are typically for boiling large quantities of fluid.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-boilery.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th to 19th centuries, boileries were used to convert [[sugarcane]] juice into raw [[sugar]]. These boileries were usually sturdy places, built from stone, and contained several copper kettles, each with a furnace beneath it.,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/2535107 Photo of Beamish Colliery Boiler House]&lt;/ref&gt;  Sugarcane juice was treated with lime in large clarifying vats, before it was heated in copper kettles over individual furnaces. Due to their importance, many Western sugar plantations had their own boileries on site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/boilery |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302042058/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Boilery |archivedate=2009-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Soap would also be made in a boiling house.  

Another use for a boilery is to make salt through the evaporation of [[brine]] water.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitslovakia.com/saltworks-near-presov Saltworks Boilery in Slovakia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1828-dictionary.com/d/word/boilery |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101013332/http://1828-dictionary.com/d/word/boilery |archivedate=2011-11-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carpenter, Obituary]" in ''Princeton Alumni Weekly,'' Vol. 28. (1927/28) p. 534&lt;/ref&gt;) was an American business manager, management author, and inventor, known as "one of the earliest advocates of the committee system in factory management."&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred D. Chandler, Jr.]]. ''Strategy and Structure: Chapters in the History of the American Industrial Enterprise.'' (2003), p. 444&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Carpenter got his degree from [[Princeton University]] in 1893, and started his career in industry. He came into prominence after being hired by [[John Henry Patterson (NCR owner)|John Henry Patterson]], founder of the [[National Cash Register Company]] (NCR), in 1901 to reorganize the labor management department of his company.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Bernstein. ''American Work Values: Their Origin and Development.'' 1997. p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in the development of the concept of functionalized labour management department, which was set up within NCR. To further promote the idea published the article "The Working of a Labor Department in Industrial Establishments." in the ''[[Engineering Magazine]]'' in 1903.&lt;ref&gt; Bruce E. Kaufman. ''Managing the Human Factor: The Early Years of Human Resource Management in American Industry,'' 2008, p .68.&lt;/ref&gt;  

At National Cash Register Company (NCR) was put in charge of a workforce of 7.500 man for several years. Around 1905 he left the company and to become President of the Herring-Hall Marvin Safe Company,&lt;ref&gt;[[Jesse Lynch Williams]], Edwin Mark Norris (1906) ''Rapport du Comité consultatif.'' Princeton University. p. 302&lt;/ref&gt; the largest safe company in the world.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.nl/books?id=m2pIAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA236 The Princeton Alumni Weekly],'' jan 6, 1906&lt;/ref&gt; Here he wrote the book "Profit Making in Shop and Factory Management," published in 1908. 

In the 1910s he joined the Recording and Computing Machines Company, a manufacturer of precision equipment. The Princeton Alumni Weekly in 1918 reported that "Charles U. Carpenter is the Vice-President and Manager of Works, of the Recording and Computing Machines Company of Dayton, Ohio. He has under him 9,000 employees. During the war he gave his big plant over to the manufacture of war supplies. His first job was the production of six million time fuses. He also made many of the optical instruments employed in sighting the guns. An unusual service which he personally rendered the country was the establishment of a training school for mechanics. So important was this work that it has been made the subject of a special bulletin by the Department of Labor, Imperial Munitions Hoard of Canada, and also by the Section on Industrial Training of the Council of National Defence at Washington."&lt;ref&gt;''Princeton Alumni Weekly,'' Vol. 17 (1916), p. 683&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1920 Carpenter became president and general manager of the National Industrial Engineering Company, and in those days he was also Vice president of the western Appraisal Company.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?q1=Carpenter;id=uc1.c2534810;view=image;seq=267;start=1;sz=10;page=search;num=257 Factory and Industrial Management],'' Vol. 59. (1920) p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Work ==
Carpenter was promotor of the American system of manufacturing. He claimed. that "one can but admire the wonderful systems of organization and management by which the enormous business interests of the United States are governed."&lt;ref name="C 02 in S 95"&gt;Carpenter (1902), as cited in: [[Yehouda Shenhav]]. "[http://people.socsci.tau.ac.il/mu/yshenhav/files/2013/07/From-Chaos-to-Systems.pdf From Chaos to Systems: The Engineering Foundations of Organization Theory, 1879-1932]," in: ''Administrative Science Quarterly,'' Vol. 40, No. 4 (Dec., 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

He firmly believed in firm principles of management, and started that "if the system of organization is founded upon the correct principles, the perfection of the details will follow as a natural sequence."&lt;ref name="C 02 in S 95"/&gt;

Carpenter was, however, not blind for the all-day practice. He observed, that "in the mind of the old-time manufacturer the word 'system' is indissolubly linked with that of horror of 'extra clerks'..."&lt;ref name="C 02 in S 95"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4925">'''Christian Augustus Henry Allhusen''' (1806–1890) was a [[Danes|Danish]]-[[England|English]] chemical manufacturer based in the North East of England. Born in [[Kiel]] when it was in the Danish  Duchy of Holstein, he and his family were displaced when [[Louis-Nicolas Davout|Marshall Davoust]], [[Napoleon]]'s "Iron Marshall," occupied the family home as his headquarters. Allhusen was employed by Koch &amp; Sons, grain merchants of [[Rostock]] and then moved to [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], where he was employed by Campbell &amp; Reveley, also grain merchants.&lt;ref name ="Allen"&gt;{{cite book   | title = Some Founders of the Chemical Industry: Men to be Remembered | author= John Fenwick Allen | publisher = Sherratt &amp; Hughes  | location=  |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=1GYoAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA234&amp;dq=Christian+Allhusen&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiThfTx4PHbAhUDOKwKHdFEDLIQ6AEINDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Christian%20Allhusen&amp;f=false | date = 1906 | pages = 231 - 248  | isbn =   | accessdate = 26 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Allhusen became a British citizen by a private Act of Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book   | title = The Parliamentary Debates (Authorized Edition), Volume 30 | author=  | publisher = Wyman| location=  |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ky9VAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PT1&amp;dq=Christian+Allhusen&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwju0NLn8vHbAhVGL6wKHegaBlk4ChDoAQhVMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=Christian%20Allhusen&amp;f=false | date = 1835 | page = | isbn =   | accessdate = 26 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He later went into partnership with [[Henry Bolckow]] and expanded into the ship and insurance brokerage business.&lt;ref name = "Allen"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Joseph"&gt;{{cite book   | title = The Navigation Laws of Great Britain, Historically and Practically Considered, with Reference to Commercial and National Defence  | author= Joseph ALLEN (of Greenwich Hospital.) | publisher = Baily Bros. &amp; James Ridgway  | location=  |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=iPYVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA114&amp;dq=Christian+Allhusen&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiKqtm1-PHbAhVPeawKHZeUDm44HhDoAQhWMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=Christian%20Allhusen&amp;f=false | date = 1849 | pages = 107 - 112  | isbn =   | accessdate = 26 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Reid"&gt;{{cite book   | title = Middlesbrough and Its Jubilee: A History of the Iron and Steel Industries, with Biographies of Pioneers  | author= Sir Hugh Gilzean-Reid | publisher = "The Gazette" Printing and Publishing Offices  | location=  |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=iPYVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA114&amp;dq=Christian+Allhusen&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiKqtm1-PHbAhVPeawKHZeUDm44HhDoAQhWMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=Christian%20Allhusen&amp;f=false | date = 1881 | pages = 113 - 114  | isbn =   | accessdate = 26 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1840, Allhusen purchased a soap works in [[Gateshead]], and began the manufacture of chemicals, eventually calling the company C. Allhusen &amp; Sons. In 1871, Allhusen converted his enterprise into a [[joint-stock company]], Newcastle Chemical Works, Ltd. He made a large fortune, and was influential in the region as company director and shareholder in such companies as the Northumberland &amp; Durham District Bank, the Newcastle &amp; Gates Water Company and the Consett Iron Works. He was an active member of the Newcastle Chamber of Commerce and the Tyne Commission.&lt;ref name = Allen/&gt;

In 1854, Allhusen was among local industrialists urging construction of a new [[Wharf|quay]] for Gateshead. When the quay was eventually constructed, the local government failed to include necessary transportation facilities to allow efficient transport to and from the quay facility. As a result, the quay complex required years of subsidies and struggled to avoid failure as Allhusen had predicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book   | title = North East England, 1850-1914: The Dynamics of a Maritime-industrial Region | author= Graeme J.

== Career ==

=== Swim with the Tuna ===
Forster is a director of Port Lincoln-based tourism venture, ''Swim with the Tuna. ''Operations were first trialled in South Australia's [[Port Lincoln, South Australia|Boston Bay]] in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atuna.com/NewsArchive/ViewArticle.asp?ID=9115 |title=Trail Run 'Swim with the Tuna' A Success |date=10 December 2010 |accessdate=24 April 2015 |website=atuna |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304191841/http://www.atuna.com/NewsArchive/ViewArticle.asp?ID=9115 |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; before commencing commercial operations in 2011. The business intended to move to [[Kangaroo Island]], but has faced opposition from conservationists&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atuna.com/NewsArchive/ViewArticle.asp?ID=9875 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20150424101401/http://www.atuna.com/NewsArchive/ViewArticle.asp?ID=9875 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2015-04-24 |title=Conservationists Find 'Swim With Tuna' Inappropriate |date=28 July 2011 |accessdate=24 April 2015 |website=atuna }}&lt;/ref&gt; and residents. Proposals to relocated the facility comprising a modified tuna pen and floating pontoon to [[Nepean Bay]] have been rejected on two occasions, most recently in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/kangaroo-island-residents-reject-plan-to-relocate-a-tuna-pen-and-pontoon-from-port-lincoln/story-e6frfq80-1226478406645|title = Kangaroo Island residents reject plan to relocate a tuna pen and pontoon from Port Lincoln|date = 20 September 2012|access-date = 24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oceanic Victor (another business for which Forster works as an advisor) proposes to offer a very similar experience to that offered by ''Swim with the Tuna'', located off Granite Island in [[Encounter Bay]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Swim with the Tuna business was sold in 2015 ahead of the possible relocation to Victor Harbor. Forster claimed that they had held some of their fish captive for five years, the largest having reached a weight of 85 kilograms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Last lap for Swim with the Tuna|url = http://www.portlincolntimes.com.au/story/3393380/last-lap-for-swim-with-the-tuna/|website = Port Lincoln Times|accessdate = 21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Granite Island observatory ===
Emma's father Ron Forster built a floating underwater observatory in 1989. Her father's construction was first used in Port Lincoln, where it assisted the development of the tuna industry. It was later sold to Stephen Edwards, who moored it off [[Granite Island (South Australia)|Granite Island]]. It operated there as a tourist attraction and educational facility from 1997 to 2004. In 2015, Forster was revealed to be working as an advisor for [[Oceanic Victor]], a company which intends to re-establish a similar facility off Granite Island. The venture intends to offer people the opportunity to swim with [[Southern bluefin tuna]] and other marine species, feed fish and observe them underwater.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.victorharbortimes.com.au/story/3031974/underwater-observatory-among-eco-tourism-plans-for-granite-island/|title = Port Lincoln developers reveal eco-tourism plans for Granite Island|last = Simmons|first = Michael|date = 23 April 2015|access-date = 24 April 2015|newspaper = Victor Harbor Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two directors of Oceanic Victor are also the CEO and Operations Manager of Tony's Tuna International, [[Tony Šantić]] and Michael "Mick" Dyer. Tony Šantić is a long-term friend of Forster's who provided her with a character reference after she was charged after crashing her Mercedes and recording a blood-alcohol level of 0.224% in August 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/2006-12-27/foleys-girlfriend-fined-for-drink-driving/2161780|title = Foley's girlfriend fined for drink-driving|date = 27 December 2006|access-date = 25 April 2015|publisher = ABC}}&lt;/ref&gt; She returned to the road in March 2007 with a provisional driver's license.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/foleys-girl-back-behind-wheel/story-e6frea83-1111113170452|title = Foley's girl back behind wheel|last = Wheatley|first = Kim|date = 16 March 2007|access-date = 25 April 2015|first2 = Ivon|last2 = Perrin|newspaper = The Advertiser}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Great white sharks ===
Forster has co-managed her father's business, Calypso Star Charters, which offers shark cage diving experiences to tourists. Forster's partner David "Bucky" Buckland has encountered many great white sharks while diving for abalone. In 2013 Forster said of [[Great white shark]]s:&lt;blockquote&gt;"The sharks are like rabbits now. They can breed and no one can catch them."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Early life ==
Forster grew up on [[Fleurieu Peninsula]], where she attended [[Rapid Bay, South Australia|Rapid Bay Primary School]] and [[Yankalilla, South Australia|Yankalilla Area School]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She undertook a Rotary Youth Exchange to Japan in 1993, at the age of 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.portlincolntimes.com.au/story/2901690/locals-invited-to-hear-rotary-guest-speakers/|title = Locals invited to hear Rotary guest speakers|last = Harrison|first = Billie|date = 24 February 2015|access-date = 25 April 2015|newspaper = Port Lincoln Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eye tracking''' is the process of measuring either the point of [[gaze (physiology)|gaze]] (where one is looking) or the motion of an eye relative to the head.  An '''eye tracker''' is a device for measuring eye positions and [[Eye movement (sensory)|eye movement]].  Eye trackers are used in research on the [[visual system]], in psychology, in [[psycholinguistics]], marketing, as an input device for [[human-computer interaction]], and in product design.  There are a number of methods for measuring eye movement.  The most popular variant uses video images from which the eye position is extracted.  Other methods use [[search coil]]s or are based on the [[electrooculography|electrooculogram]].

[[File:Yarbus eye tracker.jpg|thumb|Yarbus eye tracker from the 1960s.]]

== History ==
In the 1800s, studies of eye movement were made using direct observations.

In 1879 in Paris, [[Louis Émile Javal]] observed that reading does not involve a smooth sweeping of the eyes along the text, as previously assumed, but a series of short stops (called fixations) and quick [[saccade]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Reported in Huey 1908/1968.&lt;/ref&gt;  This observation raised important questions about reading, questions which were explored during the 1900s: On which words do the eyes stop? For how long? When do they regress to already seen words?

[[File:Reading Fixations Saccades.jpg|thumb|left|320px|An example of fixations and saccades over text. This is the typical pattern of eye movement during reading. The eyes never move smoothly over still text.]]
Edmund Huey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Huey|first=Edmund|title=The Psychology and Pedagogy of Reading (Reprint)|publisher=MIT Press 1968 (originally published 1908)}}&lt;/ref&gt; built an early eye tracker, using a sort of contact lens with a hole for the [[pupil]]. The lens was connected to an aluminum pointer that moved in response to the movement of the eye. Huey studied and quantified regressions (only a small proportion of saccades are regressions), and he showed that some words in a sentence are not fixated.

The first non-intrusive eye-trackers were built by Guy Thomas Buswell in Chicago, using beams of light that were reflected on the eye and then recording them on film. Buswell made systematic studies into reading&lt;ref&gt;Buswell (1922, 1937)&lt;/ref&gt; and picture viewing.&lt;ref&gt;(1935)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, [[Alfred L. Yarbus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yarbus|1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; did important eye tracking research and his 1967 book is often quoted. He showed that the task given to a subject has a very large influence on the subject's eye movement. He also wrote about the relation between fixations and interest:

:"All the records ... show conclusively that the character of the eye movement is either completely independent of or only very slightly dependent on the material of the picture and how it was made, provided that it is flat or nearly flat."&lt;ref name="Yarbus 1967 190"&gt;{{Harvnb|Yarbus|1967|p=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cyclical pattern in the examination of pictures "is dependent on not only what is shown on the picture, but also the problem facing the observer and the information that he hopes to gain from the picture."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yarbus|1967|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Yarbus The Visitor.jpg|thumb|right|320px|This study by {{Harvtxt|Yarbus|1967}} is often referred to as evidence on how the task given to a person influences his or her eye movement.]]
:"Records of eye movements show that the observer's attention is usually held only by certain elements of the picture.... Eye movement reflects the human thought processes; so the observer's thought may be followed to some extent from records of eye movement (the thought accompanying the examination of the particular object). It is easy to determine from these records which elements attract the observer's eye (and, consequently, his thought), in what order, and how often."&lt;ref name="Yarbus 1967 190"/&gt;

:"The observer's attention is frequently drawn to elements which do not give important information but which, in his opinion, may do so. Often an observer will focus his attention on elements that are unusual in the particular circumstances, unfamiliar, incomprehensible, and so on."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yarbus|1967|p=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"... when changing its points of fixation, the observer's eye repeatedly returns to the same elements of the picture. Additional time spent on perception is not used to examine the secondary elements, but to reexamine the most important elements."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yarbus|1967|p=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, eye-tracking research expanded rapidly, particularly reading research. A good overview of the research in this period is given by [[Dr. Keith Rayner|Rayner]].&lt;ref&gt;Rayner (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, Just and Carpenter&lt;ref&gt;Just and Carpenter (1980)&lt;/ref&gt; formulated the influential ''Strong eye-mind hypothesis'', that "there is no appreciable lag between what is fixated and what is processed". If this hypothesis is correct, then when a subject looks at a word or object, he or she also thinks about it (process cognitively), and for exactly as long as the recorded fixation. The hypothesis is often taken for granted by researchers using eye-tracking. However, [[Gaze-contingency paradigm|gaze-contingent techniques]] offer an interesting option in order to disentangle overt and covert attentions, to differentiate what is fixated and what is processed.

During the 1980s, the eye-mind hypothesis was often questioned in light of covert attention,&lt;ref&gt;Posner (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wright &amp; Ward (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; the attention to something that one is not looking at, which people often do. If covert attention is common during eye-tracking recordings, the resulting scan-path and fixation patterns would often show not where our attention has been, but only where the eye has been looking, failing to indicate cognitive processing.

The 1980s also saw the birth of using eye-tracking to answer questions related to human-computer interaction.  Specifically, researchers investigated how users search for commands in computer menus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.100.445&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|title=Download Limit Exceeded|website=citeseerx.ist.psu.edu|accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, computers allowed researchers to use eye-tracking results in real time, primarily to help disabled users.&lt;ref name="Download Limit Exceeded"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.100.445&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf%5D,|title=Download Limit Exceeded|website=citeseerx.ist.psu.edu|accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, there has been growth in using eye tracking to study how users interact with different computer interfaces. Specific questions researchers ask are related to how easy different interfaces are for users.&lt;ref name="Download Limit Exceeded"/&gt;  The results of the eye tracking research can lead to changes in design of the interface. Yet another recent area of research focuses on Web development. This can include how users react to drop-down menus or where they focus their attention on a website so the developer knows where to place an advertisement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mmi-interaktiv.de/uploads/media/MMI-Interaktiv0303_SchiesslDudaThoelkeFischer.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hoffman,&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman 1998&lt;/ref&gt; current consensus is that visual attention is always slightly (100 to 250 ms) ahead of the eye. But as soon as attention moves to a new position, the eyes will want to follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6T0W-3VXNHBP-10&amp;_user=952938&amp;_coverDate=06%2F30%2F1996&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000049220&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=952938&amp;md5=4f7fbf4f015fde59aa9a39b30154e7f3 | doi=10.1016/0042-6989(95)00294-4 | volume=36 | title=Saccade target selection and object recognition: Evidence for a common attentional mechanism | year=1996 | journal=Vision Research | pages=1827–1837 | last1 = Deubel | first1 = Heiner | pmid=8759451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

We still cannot infer specific cognitive processes directly from a fixation on a particular object in a scene.&lt;ref&gt;Holsanova 2007&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, a fixation on a face in a picture may indicate recognition, liking, dislike, puzzlement etc. Therefore, eye tracking is often coupled with other methodologies, such as [[Protocol analysis|introspective verbal protocols]].

== Tracker types ==
Eye-trackers measure rotations of the eye in one of several ways, but principally they fall into three categories: (i) measurement of the movement of an object (normally, a special contact lens) attached to the eye; (ii) optical tracking without direct contact to the eye; and (iii) measurement of electric potentials using electrodes placed around the eyes.

=== Eye-attached tracking ===
The first type uses an attachment to the eye, such as a special contact lens with an embedded mirror or magnetic field sensor, and the movement of the attachment is measured with the assumption that it does not slip significantly as the eye rotates. Measurements with tight-fitting contact lenses have provided extremely sensitive recordings of eye movement, and magnetic search coils are the method of choice for researchers studying the dynamics and underlying physiology of eye movement. This method allows the measurement of eye movement in horizontal, vertical and torsion directions.&lt;ref&gt;David A. Robinson: A method of measuring eye movement using a scleral search coil in a magnetic field, IEEE Transactions on Bio-Medical Electronics, October 1963, 137–145 ([http://ebooks.yasse.ir/ebooks/IEEE_Journals/Bio-Medical_Electronics_IRE_T/A_Method_of_Measuring_Eye_Movemnent_Using_a_Scieral_Search_Coil_in_a_Magnetic_Field-274.pdf PDF])&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Optical tracking ===
[[File:EYE-SYNC eye-tracking analyzer.JPG|thumb|An eye-tracking [[head-mounted display]]. Each eye has an LED light source (gold-color metal) on the side of the display lens, and a camera under the display lens.]]
The second broad category uses some non-contact, optical method for measuring eye motion. Light, typically infrared, is reflected from the eye and sensed by a video camera or some other specially designed optical sensor. The information is then analyzed to extract eye rotation from changes in reflections. Video-based eye trackers typically use the corneal reflection (the first [[Purkinje images|Purkinje image]]) and the center of the pupil as features to track over time. A more sensitive type of eye-tracker, the dual-Purkinje eye tracker,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1364/AO.24.000527|last=Crane|first=H.D.|author2=Steele, C.M.|title=Generation-V dual-Purkinje-image eyetracker|journal=Applied Optics|volume=24|issue=4|pages=527–537|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses reflections from the front of the cornea (first Purkinje image) and the back of the lens (fourth Purkinje image) as features to track. A still more sensitive method of tracking is to image features from inside the eye, such as the retinal blood vessels, and follow these features as the eye rotates. Optical methods, particularly those based on video recording, are widely used for gaze-tracking and are favored for being non-invasive and inexpensive.
{{See also|Video-oculography}}

=== Electric potential measurement ===
The third category uses electric potentials measured with electrodes placed around the eyes. The eyes are the origin of a steady electric potential field which can also be detected in total darkness and if the eyes are closed. It can be modelled to be generated by a dipole with its positive pole at the cornea and its negative pole at the retina. The electric signal that can be derived using two pairs of contact electrodes placed on the skin around one eye is called [[EOG|Electrooculogram (EOG)]]. If the eyes move from the centre position towards the periphery, the retina approaches one electrode while the cornea approaches the opposing one. This change in the orientation of the dipole and consequently the electric potential field results in a change in the measured EOG signal. Inversely, by analysing these changes in eye movement can be tracked. Due to the discretisation given by the common electrode setup, two separate movement components – a horizontal and a vertical – can be identified. A third EOG component is the radial EOG channel,&lt;ref&gt;Elbert, T., Lutzenberger, W., Rockstroh, B., Birbaumer, N., 1985. Removal of ocular artifacts from the EEG. A biophysical approach to the EOG. Electroencephalogr Clin Neurophysiol 60, 455-463.&lt;/ref&gt; which is the average of the EOG channels referenced to some posterior scalp electrode. This radial EOG channel is sensitive to the saccadic spike potentials stemming from the extra-ocular muscles at the onset of saccades, and allows reliable detection of even miniature saccades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keren | first1 = A.S. | last2 = Yuval-Greenberg | first2 = S. | last3 = Deouell | first3 = L.Y. | year = 2010 | title = Saccadic spike potentials in gamma-band EEG: Characterization, detection and suppression | url = | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 49 | issue = | pages = 2248–2263 | doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.10.057 | pmid=19874901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to potential drifts and variable relations between the EOG signal amplitudes and the saccade sizes, it is challenging to use EOG for measuring slow eye movement and detecting gaze direction. EOG is, however, a very robust technique for measuring [[saccade|saccadic eye movement]] associated with gaze shifts and detecting [[blink]]s. 
Contrary to video-based eye-trackers, EOG allows recording of eye movements even with eyes closed, and can thus be used in sleep research. It is a very light-weight approach that, in contrast to current video-based eye-trackers, requires only very low computational power; works under different lighting conditions; and can be implemented as an embedded, self-contained wearable system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bulling|first=A. |author2=Roggen, D. |author3=Tröster, G.|year=2009|title=Wearable EOG goggles: Seamless sensing and context-awareness in everyday environments|journal=Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Smart Environments (JAISE)|volume=1|pages=157–171|issue=2|doi=10.3233/AIS-2009-0020}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus the method of choice for measuring eye movement in mobile daily-life situations and [[rapid eye movement sleep|REM]] phases during sleep.  The major disadvantage of EOG is its relatively poor gaze-direction accuracy compared to a video tracker.  That is, it is difficult to determine with good accuracy exactly where a subject is looking, though the time of eye movements can be determined.

==Technologies and techniques==

The most widely used current designs are video-based eye-trackers. A camera focuses on one or both eyes and records eye movement as the viewer looks at some kind of stimulus. Most modern eye-trackers use the center of the pupil and [[infrared]] / [[near-infrared]] non-collimated light to create [[corneal reflection]]s (CR). The vector between the pupil center and the corneal reflections can be used to compute the point of regard on surface or the gaze direction. A simple calibration procedure of the individual is usually needed before using the eye tracker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Witzner Hansen|first=Dan|author2=Qiang Ji|title=In the Eye of the Beholder: A Survey of Models for Eyes and Gaze|journal=IEEE Trans. Pattern Anal. Mach. Intell.|date=March 2010|volume=32|issue=3|pages=478–500|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1729561|doi=10.1109/tpami.2009.30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two general types of infrared / near-infrared (also known as active light) eye-tracking techniques are used: bright-pupil and dark-pupil. Their difference is based on the location of the illumination source with respect to the optics. If the illumination is [[coaxial]] with the optical path, then the eye acts as a [[retroreflector]] as the light reflects off the [[retina]] creating a bright pupil effect similar to [[Red-eye effect|red eye]]. If the illumination source is offset from the optical path, then the pupil appears dark because the retroreflection from the retina is directed away from the camera.&lt;ref name=gneo&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gneo|first1=Massimo|last2=Schmid|first2=Maurizio|last3=Conforto|first3=Silvia|last4=D’Alessio|first4=Tommaso|title=A free geometry model-independent neural eye-gaze tracking system|journal=Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation|date=2012|volume=9|issue=1|pages=82|doi=10.1186/1743-0003-9-82}}&lt;!--|accessdate=9 March 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Bright-pupil tracking creates greater iris/pupil contrast, allowing more robust eye-tracking with all iris pigmentation, and greatly reduces interference caused by eyelashes and other obscuring features.&lt;ref&gt;The Eye: A Survey of Human Vision; Wikimedia Foundation&lt;/ref&gt; It also allows tracking in lighting conditions ranging from total darkness to very bright.

Another, less used, method is known as passive light. It uses visible light to illuminate, something which may cause some distractions to users.&lt;ref name=gneo/&gt; Another challenge with this method is that the contrast of the pupil is less than in the active light methods, therefore, the center of [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] is used for calculating the vector instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sigut|first1=J|last2=Sidha|first2=SA|title=Iris center corneal reflection method for gaze tracking using visible light.|journal=IEEE Transactions on Bio-medical Engineering|date=February 2011|volume=58|issue=2|pages=411–9|pmid=20952326|doi=10.1109/tbme.2010.2087330}}&lt;!--|accessdate=9 March 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This calculation needs to detect the boundary of the iris and the white [[sclera]] ([[Corneal limbus|limbus]] tracking). It presents another challenge for vertical eye movements due to obstruction of eyelids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hua|first1=H|last2=Krishnaswamy|first2=P|last3=Rolland|first3=JP|title=Video-based eyetracking methods and algorithms in head-mounted displays.|journal=Optics Express|date=15 May 2006|volume=14|issue=10|pages=4328–50|pmid=19516585|doi=10.1364/oe.14.004328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eye-tracking setups vary greatly: some are head-mounted, some require the head to be stable (for example, with a chin rest), and some function remotely and automatically track the head during motion.  Most use a sampling rate of at least 30&amp;nbsp;Hz. Although 50/60&amp;nbsp;Hz is more common, today many video-based eye trackers run at 240, 350 or even 1000/1250&amp;nbsp;Hz, speeds needed in order to capture fixational eye movements or correctly measure saccade dynamics.

Eye movements are typically divided into [[fixation (visual)|fixations]] and saccades – when the eye gaze pauses in a certain position, and when it moves to another position, respectively. The resulting series of fixations and saccades is called a [[scanpath]]. Smooth pursuit describes the eye following a moving object. Fixational eye movements include [[microsaccade]]s: small, involuntary saccades that occur during attempted fixation. Most information from the eye is made available during a fixation or smooth pursuit, but not during a saccade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Purves |first=D |author2=st al. |date=2001 |title=Neuroscience, 2d ed. |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK11156/ |location=Sunderland (MA)|publisher=Sinauer Assocs. |page=What Eye Movements Accomplish|isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scanpaths are useful for analyzing cognitive intent, interest, and salience.  Other biological factors (some as simple as gender) may affect the scanpath as well. Eye tracking in [[human–computer interaction]] (HCI) typically investigates the scanpath for usability purposes, or as a method of input in [[gaze-contingency paradigm|gaze-contingent displays]], also known as [[gaze-based interfaces]].&lt;ref&gt;Majaranta, P., Aoki, H., Donegan, M., Hansen, D.W., Hansen, J.P., Hyrskykari, A., Räihä, K.J., ''Gaze Interaction and Applications of Eye Tracking: Advances in Assistive Technologies'', IGI Global, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Data presentation ==

Interpretation of the data that is recorded by the various types of eye-trackers employs a variety of software that animates or visually represents it, so that the visual behavior of one or more users can be graphically resumed. The video is generally manually coded to identify the AOIs(Area Of Interests) or recently using artificial intelligence. Graphical presentation is rarely the basis of research results, since they are limited in terms of what can be analysed - research relying on eye-tracking, for example, usually requires quantitative measures of the eye movement events and their parameters, The following visualisations are the most commonly used:

'''Animated representations of a point on the interface'''
This method is used when the visual behavior is examined individually indicating where the user focused their gaze in each moment, complemented with a small path that indicates the previous saccade movements, as seen in the image.

'''Static representations of the saccade path'''
This is fairly similar to the one described above, with the difference that this is static method. A higher level of expertise than with the animated ones is required to interpret this.

'''Heat maps'''
An alternative static representation, used mainly for the agglomerated analysis of the visual exploration patterns in a group of users. In these representations, the ‘hot’ zones or zones with higher density designate where the users focused their gaze (not their attention) with a higher frequency. Heat maps are the best known visualization technique for eyetracking studies.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, Jakob. Pernice, Kara. (2010).

'''Blind zones maps, or focus maps'''
This method is a simplified version of the Heat maps where the visually less attended zones by the users are displayed clearly, thus allowing for an easier understanding of the most relevant information, that is to say, we are informed about which zones were not seen by the users.

== Eye-tracking vs. gaze-tracking ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Gaze Tracking Example.jpg|thumb|left|An example of eye gaze trace overlay.]] --&gt;Eye-trackers necessarily measure the rotation of the eye with respect to some frame of reference. This is usually tied to the measuring system. Thus, if the measuring system is head-mounted, as with EOG or a video-based system mounted to a helmet, then eye-in-head angles are measured. To deduce the line of sight in world coordinates, the head must be kept in a constant position or its movements must be tracked as well. In these cases, head direction is added to eye-in-head direction to determine gaze direction.

If the measuring system is table-mounted, as with scleral search coils or table-mounted camera (“remote”) systems, then gaze angles are measured directly in world coordinates. Typically, in these situations head movements are prohibited. For example, the head position is fixed using a bite bar or a forehead support. Then a head-centered reference frame is identical to a world-centered reference frame. Or colloquially, the eye-in-head position directly determines the gaze direction.

Some results are available on human eye movements under natural conditions where head movements are allowed as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Einhäuser | first1 = W | last2 = Moeller | first2 = GU | last3 = Schumann | first3 = F | last4 = Conradt | first4 = J | last5 = Vockeroth | first5 = J | last6 = Bartl | first6 = K | last7 = Schneider | first7 = E | last8 = König | first8 = P | year = 2009 | title = Eye-head coordination during free exploration in human and cat | url = | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1164 | issue = | pages = 353–366 | doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2008.03709.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Einhäuser W, Schumann F, Bardins S, Bartl K, Böning G, Schneider E and König P (2007).

== Eye tracking in practice ==
A great deal of research has gone into studies of the mechanisms and dynamics of eye rotation, but the goal of eye- tracking is most often to estimate gaze direction. Users may be interested in what features of an image draw the eye, for example. It is important to realize that the eye-tracker does not provide absolute gaze direction, but rather can measure only changes in gaze direction. In order to know precisely what a subject is looking at, some calibration procedure is required in which the subject looks at a point or series of points, while the eye tracker records the value that corresponds to each gaze position. (Even those techniques that track features of the retina cannot provide exact gaze direction because there is no specific anatomical feature that marks the exact point where the visual axis meets the retina, if indeed there is such a single, stable point.) An accurate and reliable calibration is essential for obtaining valid and repeatable eye movement data, and this can be a significant challenge for non-verbal subjects or those who have unstable gaze.

Each method of eye-tracking has advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of an eye-tracking system depends on considerations of cost and application. There are offline methods and online procedures like [[AttentionTracking]]. There is a trade-off between cost and sensitivity, with the most sensitive systems costing many tens of thousands of dollars and requiring considerable expertise to operate properly. Advances in computer and video technology have led to the development of relatively low-cost systems that are useful for many applications and fairly easy to use. Interpretation of the results still requires some level of expertise, however, because a misaligned or poorly calibrated system can produce wildly erroneous data.

===Eye-tracking while driving a car in a difficult situation===

[[Image:Eye movements of drivers.jpg|300px | frame| right |Frames from narrow road eye tracking described in this section&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Werner Hunziker, (2006) Im Auge des Lesers: foveale und periphere Wahrnehmung - vom Buchstabieren zur Lesefreude [In the eye of the reader: foveal and peripheral perception - from letter recognition to the joy of reading] Transmedia Stäubli Verlag Zürich 2006 {{ISBN|978-3-7266-0068-6}} Based on data from:Cohen, A. S. (1983). Informationsaufnahme beim Befahren von Kurven, Psychologie für die Praxis 2/83, Bulletin der Schweizerischen Stiftung für Angewandte Psychologie&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The eye movement of two groups of drivers have been filmed with a special head camera by a team of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology: Novice and experienced drivers had their eye-movement recorded while approaching a bend of a narrow road.
The series of images has been condensed from the original film frames&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, A. S. (1983). Informationsaufnahme beim Befahren von Kurven, Psychologie für die Praxis 2/83, Bulletin der Schweizerischen Stiftung für Angewandte Psychologie&lt;/ref&gt; to show 2 eye fixations per image for better comprehension.

Each of these stills corresponds to approximately 0.5 seconds in realtime.

The series of images shows an example of eye fixations #9 to #14 of a typical novice and an experienced driver.

Comparison of the top images shows that the experienced driver checks the curve and even has Fixation No. 9 left to look aside while the novice driver needs to check the road and estimate his distance to the parked car.

In the middle images, the experienced driver is now fully concentrating on the location where an oncoming car could be seen. The novice driver concentrates his view on the parked car.

In the bottom image the novice is busy estimating the distance between the left wall and the parked car, while the experienced driver can use his [[peripheral vision]] for that and still concentrate his view on the dangerous point of the curve: If a car appears there, he has to give way, i. e. stop to the right instead of passing the parked car.&lt;ref&gt;Pictures from: Hans-Werner Hunziker, (2006) Im Auge des Lesers: foveale und periphere Wahrnehmung – vom Buchstabieren zur Lesefreude  [In the eye of the reader: foveal and peripheral perception – from letter recognition to the joy of reading] Transmedia Stäubli Verlag Zürich 2006 {{ISBN|978-3-7266-0068-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eye-tracking of younger and elderly people while walking===

While walking, elderly subjects depend more on foveal vision than do younger subjects. Their walking speed is decreased by a limited [[visual field]], probably caused by a deteriorated peripheral vision.

Younger subjects make use of both their central and peripheral vision while walking. Their peripheral vision allows faster control over the process of walking.&lt;ref&gt;Itoh N, Fukuda T. (2002) [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2466/pms.2002.94.3c.1283 Comparative study of eye movement in extent of central and peripheral vision and use by young and elderly walkers]. ''Percept Mot Skills.'' 2002 Jun;94(3 Pt 2):1283–91&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
A wide variety of disciplines use eye-tracking techniques, including [[cognitive science]]; [[psychology]] (notably [[psycholinguistics]]; the visual world paradigm); [[human-computer interaction]] (HCI); [[human factors and ergonomics]]; [[marketing research]] and medical research (neurological diagnosis). Specific applications include the tracking eye movement in [[eye movement in language reading|language reading]], [[eye movement in music reading|music reading]], human [[activity recognition]], the perception of advertising, and the playing of sports.

===Commercial applications===
In recent years, the increased sophistication and accessibility of eye-tracking technologies have generated a great deal of interest in the commercial sector. Applications include [[web usability]], advertising, sponsorship, package design and automotive engineering. In general, commercial eye-tracking studies function by presenting a target stimulus to a sample of consumers while an eye tracker is used to record the activity of the eye. Examples of target stimuli may include websites; television programs; sporting events; films and commercials; magazines and newspapers; packages; shelf displays; consumer systems (ATMs, checkout systems, kiosks); and software. The resulting data can be statistically analyzed and graphically rendered to provide evidence of specific visual patterns. By examining fixations, [[saccades]], pupil dilation, blinks and a variety of other behaviors, researchers can determine a great deal about the effectiveness of a given medium or product. While some companies complete this type of research internally, there are many private companies that offer eye-tracking services and analysis.

One of the most prominent fields of commercial eye-tracking research is web usability.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} While traditional usability techniques are often quite powerful in providing information on clicking and scrolling patterns, eye-tracking offers the ability to analyze user interaction between the clicks and how much time a user spends between clicks, thereby providing valuable insight into which features are the most eye-catching, which features cause confusion and which are ignored altogether. Specifically, eye-tracking can be used to assess search efficiency, branding, online advertisements, navigation usability, overall design and many other site components. Analyses may target a prototype or competitor site in addition to the main client site.

Eye-tracking is commonly used in a variety of different advertising media. Commercials, print ads, online ads and sponsored programs are all conducive to analysis with current eye-tracking technology. For instance in newspapers, eye-tracking studies can be used to find out in what way advertisements should be mixed with the news in order to catch the reader’s eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.looktracker.com/blog/eye-tracking-case-study/eye-tracking-study-the-new-york-times-vs-the-wall-street-journal|title=LookTracker - Eye Tracking Services|website=www.looktracker.com|accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analyses focus on visibility of a target product or logo in the context of a magazine, newspaper, website, or televised event. One example is an analysis of eye movements over advertisements in the [[Yellow pages|Yellow Pages]]. The study focused on what particular features caused people to notice an ad, whether they viewed ads in a particular order and how viewing times varied. The study revealed that ad size, graphics, color, and copy all influence attention to advertisements. Knowing this allows researchers to assess in great detail how often a sample of consumers fixates on the target logo, product or ad. As a result, an advertiser can quantify the success of a given campaign in terms of actual visual attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lohse |first=Gerald |last2=Wu |first2=D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13754">The '''"Faces of Freedom"''' photo exhibition is a collection of photographs captured by [[photo-journalist]], [[filmmaker]] and [[human rights]] [[educator]] [[Robin Romano|U. Roberto (Robin) Romano]], during his travels to [[India]], [[Nepal]] and [[Pakistan]]. Romano explores the exploitation of [[child labor]] in the production of handmade rugs in coordination with multiple international organizations, such as the [[World Bank]], [[UNICEF]], [[International Labour Organization]] and others to reduce the number of child laborers in that industry.  The exhibit has been shown in many United States cities since its first exhibit in 2009.  Faces of Freedom has been included in [[CNN]] Freedom Projects of [[Slavery#Contemporary slavery|modern slavery]].

==Child labor==
To combat exploitation of [[Child labour|child labor]], [[The World Bank]] with [[UNICEF]], [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) and Understanding Children's Work Initiative to bring awareness of the scope of the problem.  The World Bank estimates that there are 218 million children who are victim to unfair child labor practices.  The children's ages range from five to seventeen years of age.  The handmade rug industry is one of industries involved in exploitation of child labor.  The World Bank works with country-based and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in an effort to "combat child labor."&lt;ref name=TWB&gt;{{cite web |url=http://go.worldbank.org/CLQNYOJEE0 |title=Faces of Freedom - Visions of Hope for Child Laborers |author= |date=2009-12-16 |work=Topics, Children and Youth |publisher=The World Bank |accessdate=2011-05-27 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations]] and the [[International Labour Organization]] consider child labor exploitative,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Worst Forms of Child Labor Recommendation, 1999 |work=International Labour Organization |url=http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/cgi-lex/convde.pl?R190 |accessdate=2006-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UN"&gt;{{cite web|title=Convention on the Rights of the Child |work=United Nations |url=http://www.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm |accessdate=2006-10-05 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003230539/http://www.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm |archivedate=2006-10-03 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the UN stipulating, in article 32 of the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] that:&lt;blockquote&gt;''...States Parties recognize the right of the child to be protected from economic exploitation and from performing any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child's education, or to be harmful to the child's health or physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development.''  Although globally there is an estimated 250 million children working.&lt;ref name="UN" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to the census in 1990 nearly 18% of all the children in America are working in different organizations. The Supreme Court banned child labor in 1916 but the law became visible in 1941. The labor department is also not paying attention to the child labor in USA therefore children are still employed in the organizations. The age of the children who are employed is between 15 years to 17 years. They are nearly 3.7 million children who work in different factories. There is an interesting fact that more than 600 children died in work related accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.whatisusa.info/child-labor-in-usa|title=Child Labor in USA|publisher=What is USA News|date=15 April 2013 | accessdate=2012-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibit==
U. Roberto Romano, a photographer, filmmaker and humans right activist, traveled to [[India]], [[Nepal]] and [[Pakistan]] to record the plight of child laborers in the handmade rug industry.  He also gathered photographs and stories of children who have been rescued by the [[Rugmark|GoodWeave]] organization, previously known as Rugmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mediavoicesforchildren.org/?p=55 |title=Rugmark |date=March 3, 2009 |publisher=Media Voices for Children |accessdate=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mediavoicesforchildren.org/?page_id=1027 |title=Faces of Freedom |year=2011 |publisher=Media Voices for Children |accessdate=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Faces of Freedom exhibit is a collection of photos by U. Roberto Romano that provides insight into the lives, poor living conditions and faces of child rug-weavers of South Asia. Messages of hope are portrayed in the photographs and stories of children that were assisted by the [[Rugmark|GoodWeave]] program to attain school education. A selection of handmade rugs made without child labor is also exhibited.&lt;ref name=TWB/&gt;&lt;ref name=STC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southtexascollege.edu/milagros/virtual_library.html |title=Photographic Documentaries, U.

After initial showings in San Francisco, New York and Washington, D.C., the collection has been exhibited in major cities across the United States since 2009.&lt;ref name=TWB/&gt;&lt;ref name=UNICEF&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fieldnotes.unicefusa.org/2009/08/faces_of_freedom_photo_exhibit_1.html |title=Faces of Freedom photo exhibit |author=Kate Weber, UNICEF |year=2011 |work=Field Notes |publisher=United States Fund for UNICEF |accessdate=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GW&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.facesoffreedom.goodweave.org/ |title=Past Events |work=Faces of Freedom |publisher=GoodWeave |accessdate=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==News media==
In late 2010, the Faces of Freedom exhibit was featured the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[television network]] show [[Good Morning America]].  On April 18, 2011, Faces of Freedom was covered in CNN Freedom Project’s of [[Slavery#Contemporary slavery|modern slavery]]. The piece appears on [[CNN]] [http://thecnnfreedomproject.blogs.cnn.com/ website] with a slideshow of images of [[Rugmark|GoodWeave’s]] Faces of Freedom photo exhibition.

'''Federico Santa María Carrera''' (c. August 15, 1845 - December 20, 1925)  was a [[Chile]]an businessman and [[philanthropist]]. He was of [[Basque people|Basque]] descent and member of the notable [[Carrera family]].&lt;ref&gt;http://diario.elmercurio.cl/detalle/index.asp?id={09b31ebd-bb5c-419c-87c7-3069540a13e3}&lt;/ref&gt;

Federico Santa María was born in [[Valparaíso, Chile|Valparaíso]], the son of Juan Antonio Santa María Artigas and of Magdalena Carrera Aguirre. Although he was a member of two of the most respected and influential Chilean families of the 19th century, the [[Domingo Santa María|Santa María]] and the [[Carrera family|Carrera]] families, he made his huge fortune in the sugar markets of [[Paris]], in which he arrived when he was very young.

His importance in the sugar market was considerable: he became a major power in the French economy. During [[World War I]] he closed down all his businesses, declaring that he did not want to profit from war. He also supported the French Army, donating clothes and weapons for an entire regiment. 

However, once the war ended, in 1922 he started to purchase important quantities of sugar in the stock market. As analysts later declared that sugar production would be at a deficit that year, this led to enormous profits for Santa Maria. For this success he was investigated by the French national assembly, but it was determined that he had acted within legal bounds&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bibliotecas.usm.cl/web/wp-content/uploads/historicos/087_80%20a%C3%B1os%20de%20universidad.pdf|title=Especial 80 años Universidad Santa Maria|last=|first=|date=|website=Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Federico Santa Maria was a very atypical millionaire for his time. Profoundly anti-clerical, he never got married yet lived together for decades with the French woman Anna Guillaud&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ciperchile.cl/2014/11/03/agustin-edwards-una-biografia-desclasificada-del-dueno-de-el-mercurio/|title=Agustín Edwards Eastman: Una biografía desclasificada del dueño de El Mercurio {{!}} CIPER Chile CIPER Chile » Centro de Investigación e Información Periodística|website=ciperchile.cl|language=es-ES|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Because he had no descendants, he gave his entire fortune to his hometown [[Valparaíso]] for the founding of a technical and engineering school. The result of his legacy was the [[UTFSM|Federico Santa María Technical University]].

He was a distant relative of famous Chilean pianist [[Claudio Arrau]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4196">A '''food hub''', as defined by the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]], is “a centrally located facility with a business management structure facilitating the aggregation, storage, processing, distribution, and/or marketing of locally/regionally produced food products.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.usda.gov/2010/12/14/getting-to-scale-with-regional-food-hubs/|title=USDA Blog  » Getting to Scale with Regional Food Hubs|website=blogs.usda.gov|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Food hubs are a part of the [[agricultural value chain]] model and often share common values relating to conservation, sustainability, healthy food access, and supporting local farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ams.usda.gov/services/local-regional/food-hubs|title=Food Value Chains and Food Hubs: Supporting Local Producers Through Collaborative Planning, Aggregation, and Distribution {{!}} Agricultural Marketing Service|website=www.ams.usda.gov|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A defining characteristic of food hubs is source identification, a food safety and marketing benefit that allows consumers to trace the origin of products they buy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Food Hubs: Supply Chain Traceability to Enhance Local Food Systems|journal=Food Studies: An Interdisciplinary Journal|volume= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the primary goals of food hubs is to give small and medium-sized farmers access to larger or additional markets. Food hubs also fill gaps in food systems infrastructure, such as transportation, product storage, and product processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berti|first=Giaime|last2=Mulligan|first2=Catherine|date=2016-07-01|title=Competitiveness of Small Farms and Innovative Food Supply Chains: The Role of Food Hubs in Creating Sustainable Regional and Local Food Systems|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/8/7/616|journal=Sustainability|language=en|volume=8|issue=7|pages=616|doi=10.3390/su8070616}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although companies and organizations that fit the USDA definition have been operating in the United States since at least the early 1970s, most food hubs, as well as the common use of the term, started in or after 2008.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== Core functions ==
Food hubs handle some or all of the following:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ngfn.org/resources/ngfn-database/knowledge/2013%20Food%20Hub%20Survey%20Report.pdf|title=Findings of the 2013 National Food Hub Survey|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Aggregation: Compile products from different suppliers/farms to distribute through a single channel
* Distribution: Store products and transport them to the customer
* Marketing and sales: Find buyers, sell and advertise products, and promote farms’ brand identities

== Types ==
Food hubs are generally categorized into three different types. 
* Retail or Farm to Consumer (F2C): This model gives farmers more access to high-value markets by distributing products directly to consumers online, in a retail space, or via a [[community-supported agriculture]] (CSA) subscription.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ngfn.org/resources/ngfn-database/knowledge/FoodHubResourceGuide.pdf|title=Regional Food Hub Resource Guide|last=|first=|date=2012|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Wholesale or Farm to Business/Institution (F2B):This model gives farmers access to high-volume markets such as schools, grocery stores, hospitals, and restaurants that they couldn’t normally obtain on their own due to lack of volume or consistency. This method of aggregating products to meet higher volume needs is more efficient for buyers and makes it easier for them to buy regionally throughout the year.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
* Hybrid: This model includes both retail and wholesale operations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A food hub may be set up as a non-profit organization, a for-profit business, or a cooperative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nesfp.org/sites/default/files/resources/worldpeas_scalingupguide.pdf|title=A Guide for Scaling Up Food Hubs|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Balsemao-younger-Expresso.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Francisco Pinto Balsemão]] --&gt;
'''Francisco José Pereira Pinto Balsemão''' ({{IPA-pt|fɾɐ̃ˈsiʃku ˈpĩtu baɫsɨˈmɐ̃w̃}}; born 1 September 1937 in [[Lisbon]]), is a Portuguese [[businessman]], former [[journalist]] and retired politician, who served as [[List of Prime Ministers of Portugal|Prime Minister of Portugal]], from 1981 to 1983.

==Background==
He is the son of Henrique Patrício de Balsemão ([[Guarda, Portugal|Guarda]], [[Guarda Municipality, Portugal|Guarda]], 9 September 1897 – ?) and wife (married Lisbon, 21 May 1922) Maria Adelaide van Zeller de Castro Pereira ([[Sintra]], 11 August 1897 – ?).

==Career==
Being a [[Licentiate (degree)|licentiate]] in Law from the [[University of Lisbon]], Pinto Balsemão's pre-political career was in newspaper publishing. After working as a journalist and then as an administrator of ''[[Diário Popular]]'' (the ''People's Daily'' in English) from 1963 to 1971, he founded the ''[[Expresso (Portuguese newspaper)|Expresso]]'' magazine in 1973 and continued to direct it until 1980. He is one of top managers and owners of [[Impresa]] media group.

Pinto Balsemão was Member of parliament before the revolution (1969-1973), when, together with [[Francisco de Sá Carneiro]], [[Joaquim Magalhães Mota]], [[Carlos Mota Pinto]], [[João Bosco Mota Amaral]], [[Alberto João Jardim]], [[António Barbosa de Melo]] and [[António Marques Mendes]], he helped to found the [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSD), of which he is currently member number 1. In 1975 he was elected to the [[Constituent Assembly]], which was charged with drafting a new [[Constitution of Portugal|constitution]] and served as an interim legislature. Pinto Balsemão was chosen as a Vice-President of this body.

Following the victory of the [[Democratic Alliance (Portugal)|Democratic Alliance]] (a coalition led by the PSD) in two [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|parliamentary]] elections (in 1979 and 1980), Pinto Balsemão held senior positions in two [[Cabinet (politics)|cabinets]] led by Prime Minister Sá Carneiro.

When Sá Carneiro was killed in an air accident on 4 December 1980, the Social Democratic Party chose Pinto Balsemão to succeed him.  Despite his reputation for competence, he was widely perceived as lacking Sá Carneiro's charisma. He had difficulty maintaining the level of support enjoyed by his party, which had been based to a large extent on Sá Carneiro's personal popularity.  He also had to cope with friction within the Democratic Alliance, and found the [[People's Party (Portugal)|Democratic and Social Centre]] leader, [[Diogo Freitas do Amaral]], a difficult ally. These factors contributed to his defeat in the [[Portuguese legislative election, 1983|parliamentary election]] of 1983.  He finally retired from Parliament in 1987 though not from politics.

Pinto Balsemão currently serves as Chairman of the [[European Publishers Council]] [http://www.epceurope.org/index.shtml] and as Chief Executive Officer of ''[[Impresa|Grupo Impresa]]'' in Portugal. He was the founder on 6 October 1992 of [[Sociedade Independente de Comunicação]] (SIC), the first Portuguese private television network.

He is also a member of ''Steering Committee'' of the [[Bilderberg Group]], and as such has attracted some controversy. He participated in more than 30 Bilderberg-Conferences since 1981.

He is also a Member of the [[Portuguese Council of State]], elected by the [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|Assembly of the Republic]] and chosen by the current [[President of Portugal|President of the Republic]] his fellow party colleague and former president of the [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSD) [[Aníbal Cavaco Silva]].

'''Count Giannino Marzotto''' (13 April 1928 in Valdagno, Italy – 14 July 2012) was an Italian racing driver and entrepreneur. Marzotto served as President of the Mille Miglia Club, and twice winner of race in 1950 and 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwd.com/markets-news/people/giannino-marzotto-dies-at-84-6082421|title=Giannino Marzotto Dead at 84|author=Luisa Zargani|work=WWD|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1000miglia.it"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1000miglia.it/attach/Content/News/11/o/ciaogiannino_eng.pdf|title=WE HAVE LOST GIANNINO MARZOTTO &amp; MARCO CROSARA |work=www.1000miglia.it |accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

He was one of four sons of Count Gaetano Marzotto. Soon after his 20th birthday, he entered his father's [[Lancia Aprilia]] in the Giro di Sicilia and finished second in class (16th overall). Marzotto met [[Enzo Ferrari]] in 1948 with the task to build a 2L Grand Touring Coupe which is believed to be the fourth customer car even built by [[Ferrari]], a [[Ferrari 166 Inter]]. He started racing with an Aprilia for an Italian National Championship Event in 1948. Marzotto drove the Aprilia for ten races over a period of three years.&lt;ref name="conceptcarz.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conceptcarz.com/view/f1/teamsBySeason.aspx?driverTeamArticleID=70&amp;driverID=127|title=1952 Formula One Season Formula 1|work=conceptcarz.com|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.f1passion.it/2011/07/giannino-marzotto-con-ferrari-dalla-mille-miglia-alla-24-ore-le-mans/|title=Formula 1|work=Formula1.com|accessdate=27 May 2016}}{{dead link|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;Richard Williams, "Enzo Ferrari: A Life" (Yellow Jersey Press, {{ISBN|0-224-05986-6}}, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, he and his three brothers, [[Vittorio Marzotto|Vittorio]], [[Umberto Marzotto|Umberto]] and [[Paolo Marzotto|Paolo]] all entered the 1950 [[Mille Miglia]], driving Ferraris. Gianni started last, would score his first major success, when he piloted a [[Ferrari 195 S]] to victory. He was accompanied by Marco Crosara. This was the famous ''double-breasted victory'', that Marzotto achieved wearing a double-breasted brown suit. He won fame not just for winning, but for his attire which seemed to catch the spirit of the Italian fans. But this might not have happened at all. Upon testing his recently purchased Ferrari prior to the race, Gianni found it nothing compared to the previous car he drove. Suspecting some type of deviousness on the part of [[Scuderia Ferrari]], he returned to the [[Maranello]] to confront [[Enzo Ferrari]]. It was explained that Luigi Bazzi, Ferrari's technician had purposely ''strangled'' the engine in order protect the young driver. Somewhat embrassed by this, Enzo promised to personally see that car would be prepared for the race. Marzotto decided for the following season he would improve on the 195&amp;nbsp;S, with an all-new design of his own based on [[Ferrari 166]] with an engine from a [[Ferrari 212 Inter|Ferrari 212]]. Featuring a low slung body and rounded shape, the car went well in the 1951 Mille Miglia, but retired due to problems with the rear axle.&lt;ref name="1000miglia.it"/&gt;&lt;ref name="conceptcarz.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ddavid.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ddavid.com/formula1/mille_marzotto.htm|title=Mille Miglia - Giannino Marzotto|work=ddavid.com|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grandprixhistory.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grandprixhistory.org/mille_marzotto.htm|title=Mille Miglia - Giannino Marzotto|work=grandprixhistory.org|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951. Marzotto undertook a limited campaign of [[Formula 2]] races for the family team, Scuderia Marzotto, as well as in the works Ferrari, with some success. He won the Grand Prix de Rouen-les-Essarts, and visited the podium in the [[Rome Grand Prix|Gran Premio di Roma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.formula2.net/F251_16.htm|title=Formula 2 1951 - GP Rouen|work=formula2.net|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.formula2.net/F251_11.htm|title=Formula 2 1951 - GP di Roma|work=formula2.net|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1953 Mille Miglia==

[[File:Ferrari 340 MM right Enzo Ferrari Museum.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Ferrari 340|Ferrari 340 MM spider Vignale]] which won in the hands of [[Giannino Marzotto]], pictured in the Enzo Ferrari Museum]]
Originally, Marzotto planned to race one of Alfa Romeo's new [[Alfa Romeo 6C|6C 3000 CM]], but upon returning from a business trip to Lebanon, he found that car had been assigned to another driver. After a call to [[Gianni Lancia]] found that the team was fully committed, Marzotto was forced to turn to Ferrari, with whom he had developed a strained relationship for a car. At Maranello, he was shown [[Luigi Villoresi]]'s [[Ferrari 340|340MM]] which a recently won the Giro di Sicilia. The car had not been touched since its last race and had suffered a loss of brakes towards the end of the event. He was left without any other option, so he decided to take the car out of storage and have it restore it to racing trim. He was not delivered to Marzotto until a few hours before the race. This meant he was unable to do any pre-race testing in it.&lt;ref name="conceptcarz.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="grandprixhistory.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="racingsportscars.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.racingsportscars.com/race/Mille_Miglia-1953-04-26.html|title=Mille Miglia|work=racingsportscars.com|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just past [[Siena]], Marzotto remembered that the Ferrari mechanics did not change his engine oil at the last control point, as they were unable to open the bonnet. After making a U-turn, he raced back to Siena, where his mechanics cut a hole in the bonnet, directly over the engines oil filler cap, and topped the oil up accordingly. Meanwhile, [[Juan Manuel Fangio]]'s Alfa was now leading, but surrender to the chasing Marzotto when his steering started to play up along with fading brakes. Although Marzotto suffered two minor crashes, he took it all the way to Brescia, to win his second Mille Miglia, repeating his success of 1950, again accompanied by Crosara.&lt;ref name="1000miglia.it"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ddavid.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="grandprixhistory.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="racingsportscars.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Venables&gt;David Venables, "The Classic Motor Racing Circuits of Europe", Ian Allan Publishing, 2010, {{ISBN|978-0711034815}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year's event, would prove to be Marzotto last international race. He was partnered by [[Gioia Tortima]], instead of his regular co-driver Crosara in the full works Ferrari, however did not return to [[Brescia]], as he withdrew during the event through illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.racingsportscars.com/photo/Mille_Miglia-1954-05-02.html|title=Mille Miglia|work=racingsportscars.com|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''"[He was] a man with a strong personality and fascinating dialectical skills for a young man as curious as I was, with numerous very clear ideas about a great number of topics."'' Enzo Ferrari, to whom the Marzotto brothers represented important customers, was particularly taken by Giannino. ''"He was a real sport merchant, a young [[Achille Varzi|Varzi]] in his cold, calculating earnestness. The successes in the Mille Miglias were a sure sign of his dedication and enough to show that he would have made an excellent professional driver, perhaps even a champion."''&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;

==Away from the track==

After retiring from Motor Racing, Marzotto joined the Factory Lane G. Marzotto &amp; F. Spa to become a director in 1953 before being promoted to Managing Director in 1956. In 1958, he gained a further promotion to vice-president and managing director before becoming the company president in 1968.  He married in 1969 and had three daughters.&lt;ref name="grandprixhistory.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.premiogaetanomarzotto.it/giannino-marzotto-2/|title=Giannino Marzotto|work=premiogaetanomarzotto.it|accessdate=27 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305145104/http://www.premiogaetanomarzotto.it/giannino-marzotto-2/#|archive-date=5 March 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marzotto was known to generously donate to the Fondazione Club Mille Miglia, encouraging its grants and giving of an international prize known as ''Courageous Intelligence''.&lt;ref name="1000miglia.it"/&gt;

==Achievements==

Marzotto served as President of the Mille Miglia Club between 1988 and 1990, and then again from 2011 until his death. He was also the Honorary President of the ''Luigi Bonfanti'' Automobile Museum, which dedicated a permanent section to him in its [[Romano d'Ezzelino]] site. There is also a gallery known as ''Galleria del Motorismo, Mobilità ed Ingegno Veneto – Giannino Marzotto'' and this explore the story of Marzotto's life of motor racing and shows his talent. It is entirely dedicated to his career.&lt;ref name="1000miglia.it"/&gt;&lt;ref name="grandprixhistory.org"/&gt;

==Marco Crosara==

Crosara, Marzotto co-driver in those two Mille Miglia victories, died on 19 July 2012, just five days after his great friend.&lt;ref name="1000miglia.it"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35452">[[File:Vacuum capacitor with uranium glass.jpg|thumb|[[Uranium glass]] used as lead-in seals in a vacuum [[capacitor]]]]
'''Glass-to-metal seals''' are a very important element of the construction of [[vacuum tube]]s, electric discharge tubes, [[incandescent light bulb]]s, glass encapsulated [[semiconductor diode]]s, [[reed switch]]es, pressure tight glass windows in metal cases, and metal or ceramic packages of [[electronic component]]s.

Properly done, such a seal is [[Hermetic seal|hermetic]] (vacuum tight, good electrical insulation, special optical properties e.g. UV lamps).  To achieve such a seal, two properties must hold:
# The molten glass must be capable of [[wetting]] the metal, in order to form a tight bond, and
# The [[thermal expansion]] of the glass and metal must be closely matched so that the seal remains solid as the assembly cools.

Thinking for example about a metal wire in a glass bulb sealing, the metal glass contact can break if the CTEs (coefficient of thermal expansion) are not well aligned. For the case that the CTE of the metal is larger than the CTE of the glass, the sealing shows a high probability to break upon cooling. By lowering the temperature, the metal wire shrinks more than the glass does, leading to a strong tensile force on the glass, which finally lead to breakage. On the other hand, if the CTE of the glass is larger than the CTE of the metal wire, the seal will tighten upon cooling since compression force is applied on the glass.
[[File:2017-11-16 14 50 14-TABLE 3.png|thumb|right|Commercially available sealing and solder glasses]]
[[File:2017-11-16 14 50 51-Alloy.png|thumb|Thermal expansion data for some metals and alloys ]]

According to all requirements that need to be fulfilled and the strong necessity to align the CTE of both materials, there only a few companies offering specialty glass for glass-metal sealing. Such as [[SCHOTT-Rohrglas_GmbH|SCHOTT AG]] and  [http://www.morgantechnicalceramics.com/en-gb/products/glass-components/?_ga=2.46632878.862435219.1523553824-579033178.1474321043 Morgan Advance Materials].

==Glass-to-metal bonds==
Glass and metal can bond together by purely mechanical means, which usually gives weaker joints, or by chemical interaction, where the oxide layer on the metal surface forms a strong bond with the glass. The [[acid-base reaction]]s are main causes of interaction between glass-metal in the presence of metal oxides on the surface of metal. After complete dissolution of the surface oxides into the glass, further progress of interaction depends on the oxygen [[Thermodynamic activity|activity]] at the interface. The oxygen [[Thermodynamic activity|activity]] can be increased by diffusion of [[Allotropes of oxygen|molecular oxygen]] through some defects like cracks. Also, reduction of the thermodynamically less stable components in the glass (and releasing the oxygen ions) can increase the oxygen [[Thermodynamic activity|activity]] at the interface. In other words, the [[redox]] reactions are main causes of interaction between glass-metal in the absence of metal oxides on the surface of metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319915024751|author1=M. Fakouri Hasanabadi|author2=A. Nemati|author3=A. H. Kokabi|lastauthoramp=y|title=Effect of intermediate nickel layer on seal strength and chemical compatibility of glass and ferritic stainless steel in oxidizing environment for solid oxide fuel cells|journal=Int. J. Hydrogen Energy|volume=40|issue=46|pp=16434–16442|date=October 2015|doi=10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.10.023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For achieving a vacuum-tight seal, the seal must not contain bubbles. The bubbles are most commonly created by gases escaping the metal at high temperature; degassing the metal before its sealing is therefore important, especially for nickel and iron and their alloys. This is achieved by heating the metal in vacuum or sometimes in hydrogen atmosphere or in some cases even in air at temperatures above those used during the sealing process. Oxidizing of the metal surface also reduces gas evolution. Most of the evolved gas is produced due to the presence of [[carbon]] impurities in the metals; these can be removed by heating in hydrogen.&lt;ref name = "vacsealtec"&gt;{{cite book| author = Alexander Roth| title = Vacuum Sealing Techniques| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=sdKAPJh5RgQC| date = 1997-05-27| publisher = Springer| isbn = 978-1-56396-259-2| page = 151 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The glass-oxide bond is stronger than glass-metal. The oxide forms a layer on the metal surface, with the proportion of oxygen changing from zero in the metal to the stoichiometry of the oxide and the glass itself. A too thick oxide layer tends to be porous on the surface and mechanically weak, flaking, compromising the bond strength and creating possible leakage paths along the metal-oxide interface. Proper thickness of the oxide layer is therefore critical.

===Copper===
Metallic [[copper]] does not bond well to glass. [[Copper(I) oxide]], however, is wetted by molten glass and partially dissolves in it, forming a strong bond. The oxide also bonds well to the underlying metal. But [[copper(II) oxide]] causes weak joints that may leak and its formation has to be prevented.

For bonding copper to glass, the surface has to be properly oxidized. The oxide layer has to have the right thickness; too thin oxide would not provide enough material for the glass to anchor to, too thick oxide would fail in the oxide layer, and in both cases the joint would be weak and possibly non-hermetic. To improve the bonding to glass, the oxide layer should be borated; this is achieved by e.g. dipping the hot part into a concentrated solution of [[borax]] and then heating it again for certain time. This treatment stabilizes the oxide layer by forming a thin protective layer of [[sodium borate]] on its surface, so the oxide does not grow too thick during subsequent handling and joining. The layer should have uniform deep red to purple sheen.&lt;ref name="elmatpack"/&gt;&lt;ref name="handbeltube"/&gt; The boron oxide from the borated layer diffuses into glass and lowers its melting point. The oxidation occurs by oxygen diffusing through the molten borate layer and forming copper(I) oxide, while formation of copper(II) oxide is inhibited.&lt;ref name="vacsealtec"/&gt;

The copper-to-glass seal should look brilliant red, almost scarlet; pink, sherry and honey colors are also acceptable. Too thin oxide layer looks light, up to the color of metallic copper. Too thick oxide looks too dark.

[[Oxygen-free copper]] has to be used if the metal comes in contact with [[hydrogen]] (e.g. in a [[gas-filled tube|hydrogen-filled tube]] or during handling in the flame). Normally, copper contains small inclusions of [[copper(I) oxide]]. Hydrogen diffuses through the metal and reacts with the oxide, reducing it to copper and yielding water. The water molecules however can not diffuse through the metal, are trapped in the location of the inclusion, and cause [[hydrogen embrittlement|embrittlement]].

As copper bonds well to the glass, it is often used for combined glass-metal devices. The ductility of copper can be used for compensation of the thermal expansion mismatch in e.g. the knife-edge seals. For wire feed throughs, [[dumet]] wire – nickel-iron alloy plated with copper – is frequently used. Its maximum diameter is however limited to about 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm due to its thermal expansion.

Copper can be sealed to glass without the oxide layer, but the resulting joint is less strong.

===Platinum===
[[Platinum]] has similar thermal expansion as glass and is well-wetted with molten glass. It however does not form oxides, its bond strength is lower. The seal has metallic color and limited strength.

===Gold===
Like platinum, [[gold]] does not form oxides that could assist in bonding. Glass-gold bonds are therefore metallic in color and weak. Gold tends to be used for glass-metal seals only rarely. Special compositions of soda-lime glasses that match the thermal expansion of gold, containing [[tungsten trioxide]] and oxides of lanthanum, aluminum and zirconium, exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/3847628.html|title=METAL-TO-GLASS JOINT|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Silver===
[[Silver]] forms a thin layer of [[silver oxide]] on its surface. This layer dissolves in molten glass and forms [[silver silicate]], facilitating a strong bond.&lt;ref name="metalweld"&gt;{{cite book| author = John Frederik Lancaster| title = Metallurgy of welding| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-Xq6WaCKGwYC| year = 1999| publisher = Woodhead Publishing| isbn = 978-1-85573-428-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nickel===
[[Nickel]] can bond with glass either as a metal, or via the [[nickel(II) oxide]] layer. The metal joint has metallic color and inferior strength. The oxide-layer joint has characteristic green-grey color. Nickel plating can be used in similar way as copper plating, to facilitate better bonding with the underlying metal.&lt;ref name="elmatpack"&gt;{{cite book| author = Merrill L. Minges| title = Electronic Materials Handbook: Packaging| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=c2YxCCaM9RIC| year = 1989| publisher = CRC Press| isbn = 978-0-87170-285-2| last2 = Handbook Committee }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iron===
[[Iron]] is only rarely used for feedthroughs, but frequently gets coated with [[vitreous enamel]], where the interface is also a glass-metal bond. The bond strength is also governed by the character of the oxide layer on its surface. A presence of [[cobalt]] in the glass leads to a chemical reaction between the metallic iron and cobalt oxide, yielding iron oxide dissolved in glass and cobalt alloying with the iron and forming [[dendrite (metal)|dendrites]], growing into the glass and improving the bond strength.&lt;ref name="metalweld"/&gt;

Iron can not be directly sealed to [[lead glass]], as it reacts with the lead oxide and reduces it to metallic lead. For sealing to lead glasses, it has to be copper-plated or an intermediate lead-free glass has to be used. Iron is prone to creating gas bubbles in glass due to the residual carbon impurities; these can be removed by heating in wet hydrogen. Plating with copper, nickel or chromium is also advised.&lt;ref name="vacsealtec"/&gt;

===Chromium===
[[Chromium]] is a highly reactive metal present in many iron alloys. Chromium may react with glass, reducing the silicon and forming crystals of [[chromium silicide]] growing into the glass and anchoring together the metal and glass, improving the bond strength.&lt;ref name="metalweld"/&gt;

===Kovar===
[[Kovar]], an iron-nickel-cobalt alloy, has low thermal expansion similar to [[Borosilicate glass|high-borosilicate glass]] and is frequently used for glass-metal seals especially for the application in [[x-ray tubes]] or glass lasers. It can bond to glass via the intermediate oxide layer of [[nickel(II) oxide]] and [[cobalt(II) oxide]]; the proportion of iron oxide is low due to its reduction with cobalt. The bond strength is highly dependent on the oxide layer thickness and character.&lt;ref name="handbeltube"/&gt;&lt;ref name="metalweld"/&gt; The presence of cobalt makes the oxide layer easier to melt and dissolve in the molten glass. A grey, grey-blue or grey-brown color indicates a good seal. A metallic color indicates lack of oxide, while black color indicates overly oxidized metal, in both cases leading to a weak joint.&lt;ref name="vacsealtec"/&gt;

===Molybdenum===
[[Molybdenum]] bonds to the glass via the intermediate layer of [[molybdenum(IV) oxide]]. Due to its low thermal expansion coefficient, matched to glass, molybdenum, like tungsten, is often used for glass-metal bonds especially in conjunction with aluminium-silicate glass. Its high electrical conductivity makes it superior over nickel-cobalt-iron alloys. It is favored by the lighting industry as feedthroughs for lightbulbs and other devices. Molybdenum oxidizes much faster than tungsten and quickly develops a thick oxide layer that does not adhere well, its oxidation should be therefore limited to just yellowish or at most blue-green color. The oxide is volatile and evaporates as a white smoke above 700&amp;nbsp;°C; excess oxide can be removed by heating in inert gas (argon) at 1000&amp;nbsp;°C. Molybdenum strips are used instead of wires where higher currents (and higher cross-sections of the conductors) are needed.&lt;ref name="vacsealtec"/&gt;

===Tungsten===
[[Tungsten]] bonds to the glass via the intermediate layer of [[tungsten(VI) oxide]]. A properly formed bond has characteristic coppery/orange/brown-yellow color in lithium-free glasses; in lithium-containing glasses the bond is blue due to formation of [[lithium tungstate]]. Due to its low thermal expansion coefficient, matched to glass, tungsten is frequently used for glass-metal bonds. Tungsten forms satisfying bonds with glasses with similar thermal expansion coefficient such as [[Borosilicate glass|high-borosilicate glass]]. The surface of both the metal and glass should be smooth, without scratches.&lt;ref name="handbeltube"&gt;{{cite book| author = Fred Rosebury| title = Handbook of electron tube and vacuum techniques| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=yBmnnaODnHgC| date = 1992-12-31| publisher = American Institute  . of Physics| isbn = 978-1-56396-121-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tungsten has the lowest expansion coefficient of metals and the highest melting point.

===Stainless steel===
304 [[Stainless steel]] forms bonds with glass via an intermediate layer of [[chromium(III) oxide]] and [[iron(III) oxide]]. Further reactions of chromium, forming chromium silicide dendrites, are possible. The thermal expansion coefficient of steel is however fairly different from the glass; like with copper, this can be alleviated by using knife-edge (Housekeeper) seals.&lt;ref name="handbeltube"/&gt;

===Zirconium===
[[Zirconium]] wire can be sealed to glass with just little treatment – rubbing with abrasive paper and short heating in flame. Zirconium is used in applications demanding chemical resistance or lack of magnetism.&lt;ref name="vacsealtec"/&gt;

===Titanium===
[[Titanium]], like zirconium, can be sealed to some glasses with just little treatment.&lt;ref name="vacsealtec"/&gt;

===Indium===
[[Indium]] and some of its alloys can be used as a [[solder]] capable of wetting glass, ceramics, and metals and joining them together. Indium has low melting point and is very soft; the softness allows it to deform plastically and absorb the stresses from thermal expansion mismatches. Due to its very low vapor pressure, indium finds use in glass-metal seals used in vacuum technology.&lt;ref name="vacphystech"&gt;{{cite book|  title = Vacuum physics and technology| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tfLWfAx1ZWQC| year = 1979| isbn = 978-0-12-475914-5| last2 = Carlson| author1 = Weissler| first1 = G. L| first2 = Robert Warner }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gallium===
[[Gallium]] is a soft metal with melting point at 30&amp;nbsp;°C. It readily wets glasses and most metals and can be used for seals that can be assembled/disassembled by just slight heating. It can be used as a [[liquid seal]] up to high temperatures or even at lower temperatures when alloyed with other metals (e.g. as [[galinstan]]).&lt;ref name="vacphystech"/&gt;

===Mercury===
[[mercury (element)|Mercury]] is a metal liquid at normal temperature. It was used as the earliest glass-to-metal seal and is still in use for [[liquid seal]]s for e.g. rotary shafts.

==Mercury seal==
The first technological use of a glass-to-metal seal was the encapsulation of the [[vacuum]] in the [[barometer]] by [[Evangelista Torricelli|Torricelli]]. The liquid [[mercury (element)|mercury]] wets the glass and thus provides for a vacuum tight seal. Liquid mercury was also used to seal the metal leads of early [[mercury arc lamp]]s into the [[fused silica]] bulbs.

A less toxic and more expensive alternative to mercury is [[gallium]].

Mercury and gallium seals can be used for vacuum-sealing rotary shafts.

==Platinum wire seal==
The next step was to use thin [[platinum]] [[wire]]. Platinum is easily [[wetting|wetted]] by glass and has a similar [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] as typical [[soda-lime glass|soda-lime]] and [[lead glass]]. It is also easy to work with because of its
non-oxidibility and high melting point. This type of seal was used in scientific equipment throughout the 19th century and also in the early incandescent lamps and radio tubes.

==Dumet wire seal==
In 1911 the [[Fernico|Dumet]]-wire seal was invented which is still the common practice to seal [[copper]] leads through soda-lime or lead glass. If copper is properly oxidised before it is wetted by molten glass a vacuum tight seal of good mechanical strength can be obtained. After copper is oxidized, it is often dipped in a borax solution, as borating the copper helps prevents over-oxidation when reintroduced to a flame. Simple copper wire is not usable because its coefficient of thermal expansion is much higher than that of the glass. Thus, on cooling a strong tensile force acts on the glass-to-metal interface and it breaks. Glass and glass-to-metal interfaces are especially sensitive to tensile stress. Dumet-wire is a copper clad wire (about 25% of the weight of the wire is copper) with a core of nickel-iron alloy 42, an alloy with a composition of about 42% nickel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jlcelectromet.com/dumetwire.htm|title=JLC Electromet - Dumet Wire: Copper-Clad Ni-Fe Alloy Wire|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218044952/http://www.jlcelectromet.com/dumetwire.htm|archivedate=2010-12-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The core has a low coefficient of thermal expansion, allowing for a wire with a coefficient of radial thermal expansion which is slightly lower than the linear coefficient of thermal expansion of the glass, so that the glass-to-metal interface is under a low compression stress. It is not possible to adjust the axial thermal expansion of the wire as well. Because of the much higher mechanical strength of the nickel-iron core compared to the copper, the axial thermal expansion of the Dumet-wire is about the same as of the core. Thus, a shear stress builds up which is limited to a safe value by the low tensile strength of the copper. This is also the reason why Dumet is only useful for wire diameters lower than about 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm. In a typical Dumet seal through the base of a vacuum tube a short piece of Dumet-wire is butt welded to a nickel wire at one end and a copper wire at the other end. When the base is pressed of lead glass the Dumet-wire and a short part of the nickel and the copper wire are enclosed in the glass. Then the nickel wire and the glass around the Dumet-wire are heated by a gas flame and the glass seals to the Dumet-wire. The nickel and copper do not seal vacuum tight to the glass but are mechanically supported. The butt welding also avoids problems with gas-leakages at the interface between the core wire and the copper.

==Copper tube seal==
[[File:Glass to metal seals 1922.png|thumb|Three types of copper tube seals (from ''[[Bell System Technical Journal]]'', 1922). In A, the edge of the copper is not in contact with the glass. In B and C, the copper is machined to a sharp knife edge in contact with the glass, with the glass either inside (B) or outside (C) of the copper.]]

Another possibility to avoid a strong tensile stress when sealing copper through glass is the use of a thin walled copper tube instead of a solid wire. Here a shear stress builds up in the glass-to-metal interface which is limited by the low tensile strength of the copper combined with a low tensile stress. The copper tube is insensitive to high electric current compared to a Dumet-seal because on heating the tensile stress converts into a compression stress which is again limited by the tensile strength of the copper. Also, it is possible to lead an additional solid copper wire through the copper tube. In a later variant, only a short section of the copper tube has a thin wall and the copper tube is hindered to shrink at cooling by a ceramic tube
inside the copper tube.

If large parts of copper are to be fitted to glass like the water cooled copper anode of a high power radio transmitter tube or an x-ray tube historically the Houskeeper knife edge seal is used. Here the end of a copper tube is machined to a sharp knife edge, invented by O. Kruh in 1917. In the method described by W.G. Houskeeper the outside or the inside of the
copper tube right to the knife edge is wetted with glass and connected to the [[glass tube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Handbook of materials and techniques for vacuum devices| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-Ll6qjWB-RUC| year = 1967| publisher = American Institute of Physics| isbn = 978-1-56396-387-2| author1 = Kohl| first1 = Walter Heinrich }}&lt;/ref&gt; In later descriptions the knife edge is just wetted several millimeters deep with glass, usually deeper on the inside, and then connected to the [[glass tube]].

If copper is sealed to glass, it is an advantage to get a thin bright red {{chem|Cu|2|O}} containing layer between copper and glass. This is done by borating. After W.J. Scott a copper plated tungsten wire is immersed for about 30 s in chromic acid and
then washed thoroughly in running tap water. Then it is dipped into a saturated solution of borax and heated to bright red heat
in the oxidizing part of a gas flame. Possibly followed by quenching in water and drying. Another method is to oxidize the
copper slightly in a gas flame and then to dip it into borax solution and let it dry. The surface of the borated
copper is black when hot and turns to dark wine red on cooling.

It is also possible to make a bright seal between copper and glass where it is possible to see the blank copper surface through the glass, but this gives less adherence than the seal with the red {{chem|Cu|2|O}} containing layer. If glass is melted on
copper in a reducing hydrogen atmosphere the seal is extremely weak. If copper is to be heated in hydrogen-containing atmosphere e.g. a gas flame it
needs to be oxygen-free to prevent hydrogen embrittlement. Copper which is meant to be used as an electrical conductor is not necessarily oxygen-free
and contains particles of {{chem|Cu|2|O}} which react with hydrogen that diffuses into the copper to {{chem|H|2|O}} which cannot diffuse out-off the
copper and thus causes embrittlement. The copper usually used in vacuum applications is of the very pure [[OFHC]] (oxygen-free-high-conductivity)
quality which is both free of {{chem|Cu|2|O}} and deoxidising additives which might evaporate at high temperature in vacuum.

==Copper disc seal==
In the copper disc seal, as proposed by W.G. Houskeeper, the end of a [[glass tube]] is closed by a round copper disc. An additional ring of glass on the opposite side of the disc increases the possible thickness of the disc to more than 0.3&amp;nbsp;mm. Best mechanical strength is obtained if both sides of the disc are fused to the same type of [[glass tube]] and both tubes are under vacuum. The disc seal is of special practical interest because it is a simple method to make a seal to low expansion borosilicate glass without the need of special tools or materials. The keys to success are proper borating, heating of the joint to a temperature as close to the melting point of the copper as possible and to slow down the cooling, at least by packing the assembly into glass wool while it is still red hot.

==Matched seal==
[[File:Matched glass-to-metal seals.JPG|thumb|Matched glass-to-metal seals]]
In a matched seal the thermal expansion of metal and glass is matched. Copper-plated tungsten wire can be used to seal through borosilicate glass with a low coefficient of thermal expansion which is matched by tungsten. The tungsten is electrolytically copper plated and heated in hydrogen atmosphere to fill cracks in the tungsten and to get a proper surface to easily seal to glass. The borosilicate glass of usual [[laboratory glassware]] has a lower coefficient of thermal expansion than tungsten, thus it is necessary to use an intermediate sealing glass to get a stress-free seal.

There are combinations of glass and iron-nickel-cobalt alloys ([[Kovar]]) where even the non-linearity of the thermal expansion is matched. These alloys can be directly sealed to glass, but then the oxidation is critical. Also, their low electrical conductivity is a disadvantage. Thus, they are often gold plated. It is also possible to use silver plating, but then an additional gold layer is necessary as an oxygen diffusion barrier to prevent the formation of iron oxide.

While there are Fe-Ni alloys which match the thermal expansion of tungsten at room temperature, they are not useful to seal to glass because of a too strong increase of their thermal expansion at higher temperatures.

Reed switches use a matched seal between an iron-nickel alloy (NiFe 52) and a matched glass. The glass of reed switches is usually green due to its iron content because the sealing of reed switches is done by heating with infrared radiation and this glass shows a high absorption in the near infrared.

The electrical connections of high-pressure sodium vapour lamps, the yellow lamps for street lighting, are made of niobium alloyed with 1% of zirconium.&lt;ref&gt;stahl und eisen 130 (2010), Vol. 2, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, some television cathode ray tubes were made by using ferric steel for the funnel and glass matched in expansion to ferric steel. The steel plate used had a diffusion layer enriched with chromium at the surface made by heating the steel together with chromium oxide in a HCl-containing atmosphere. In contrast to copper, pure iron does not bond strongly to silicate glass. Also, technical iron contains some carbon which forms bubbles of CO when it is sealed to glass under oxidizing conditions. Both are a major source of problems for the technical enamel coating of steel and make direct seals between iron and glass unsuitable for high vacuum applications. The oxide layer formed on chromium-containing steel can seal vacuum tight to glass and the chromium strongly reacts with carbon. Silver-plated iron was used in early microwave tubes.

It is possible to make matched seals between copper or austenitic steel and glass, but silicate glass with that high thermal expansion is especially fragile and has a low chemical durability.
[[File:Halogenlampe G9 Osram.jpg|left|thumb|Halogen bulb with molybdenum foil seal]]

==Molybdenum foil seal==
Another widely used method to seal through glass with low coefficient of thermal expansion is the use of strips of thin molybdenum foil. This can be done with matched coefficients of thermal expansion. Then the edges of the strip also have to be knife sharp. The disadvantage here is that the tip of the edge which is a local point of high tensile stress reaches through the wall of the [[glass container]]. This can lead to low gas leakages. In the tube to tube knife edge seal the edge is either outside, inside, or buried into the glass wall.
[[File:Stress trajectories in glass-to-metal compression seal with two metal leads.jpg|left|thumb|Stress trajectories in glass-to-metal compression seal with two metal leads]]

==Compression seal==
[[File:Semi-hermetic compressor multipole feedthrough (compression glass-to-metal-seal).JPG|thumb|Semi-hermetic compressor multipole feedthrough (compression glass-to-metal-seal]]
Another possibility of seal construction is the compression seal. This type of glass-to-metal seal can be used to feed through the wall of a metal container. Here the wire is usually matched to the glass which is inside of the bore of a strong metal part with higher coefficient of thermal expansion. Compression seals can withstand extremely high pressures and physical stress such as mechanical and thermal shock. Because glass is extremely strong in compression, compression seals can withstand very high pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hermetic Seal {{!}} Glass-to-Metal Seal {{!}} Elan Technology in USA|url = http://www.elantechnology.com/glass/glass-metal-hermetic-seal/|website = Elan Technology|accessdate = 2015-12-03|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Silver chloride==
[[Silver chloride]], which melts at 457 C bonds to glass, metals and other materials and has been used for vacuum seals. Even if it can be a convenient way to seal metal into glass it will not be a true glass to metal seal but rather a combination of a glass to silver chloride and a silver chloride to glass bond, an inorganic alternative to wax or glue bonds.

==Design aspects==
Also the mechanical design of a glass-to-metal seal has an important influence on the reliability of the seal. In practical glass-to-metal seals cracks usually start at the edge of the interface between glass and metal either inside or outside the glass container. If the metal and the surrounding glass are symmetric the crack propagates in an angle away from the axis. So, if the glass envelope of the metal wire extends far enough from the wall of the container the crack will not go through the wall of the container but it will reach the surface on the same side where it started and the seal will not leak despite the crack.

Another important aspect is the [[wetting]] of the metal by the glass. If the thermal expansion of the metal is higher than the thermal expansion of
the glass like with the Housekeeper seal, a high contact angle (bad wetting) means that there is a high tensile stress in the surface of the glass
near the metal. Such seals usually break inside the glass and leave a thin cover of glass on the metal. If the contact angle is low (good wetting)
the surface of the glass is everywhere under compression stress like an [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] coating. Ordinary soda-lime glass does not flow on copper at temperatures below the melting point of the copper and, thus, does not give a low contact angle. The solution is to cover the copper with a
[[Solder#Glass solder|solder glass]] which has a low melting point and does flow on copper and then to press the soft soda-lime glass onto the copper. The solder glass
must have a coefficient of thermal expansion which is equal or a little lower than that of the soda-lime glass. Classically high lead containing
glasses are used, but it is also possible to substitute these by multi-component glasses e.g. based on the
system {{chem|Li|2|O}}-{{chem|Na|2|O}}-{{chem|K|2|O}}-{{chem|CaO}}-{{chem|SiO|2}}-{{chem|B|2|O|3}}-{{chem|ZnO}}-{{chem|TiO|2}}-{{chem|BaO}}-{{chem|Al|2|O|3}}.

'''Innovation management''' is a combination of the [[management]] of [[innovation]] processes, and [[change management]]. It refers both to [[Product (business)|product]], [[business process]], and [[organization]]al innovation. Innovation management is the subject of ISO 50500 series standards developed by [[ISO TC 279]].

Innovation management includes a set of tools that allow managers and engineers to cooperate with a common understanding of [[business process|process]]es and [[goal]]s. Innovation management allows the organization to respond to external or internal opportunities, and use its creativity to introduce new [[idea]]s, processes or [[Product (business)|product]]s.&lt;ref name="kelly78"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Kelly, P.  |author2=Kranzburg M. |title=Technological Innovation: A Critical Review of Current Knowledge |publisher=San Francisco Press |location=San Francisco |year=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not relegated to R&amp;D; it involves workers at every level in contributing creatively to a company's product development, manufacturing and marketing.

By utilizing innovation management [[tool]]s, management can trigger and deploy the creative capabilities of the work force for the continuous development of a company.&lt;ref name="Clark, Charles H. 1980"&gt;{{cite book |author=Clark, Charles H. |title=Idea Management: How to Motivate Creativity and Innovation |publisher=AMACOM |location=New York |year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common tools include [[brainstorming]], [[digital prototyping| prototyping]], [[product lifecycle management]], idea management, [[TRIZ]], [[Phase–gate model]], [[project management]], [[product line]] planning and [[Project portfolio management|portfolio management]]. The process can be viewed as an evolutionary integration of organization, technology and market by iterating series of activities: search, select, implement and capture.&lt;ref name="Tidd, Joe and Bessant, John 2009"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Tidd, Joe  |author2=Bessant, John |title=Managing Innovation: Integrating Technological, Market and Organizational Change 4e - first ed. with Keith Pavitt|publisher=Wiley |location=Chichester |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Innovation processes can either be ''pushed'' or ''pulled'' through development. A ''pushed'' process is based on existing or newly invented technology, that the organization has access to, and tries to find profitable applications for.

A ''pulled'' process is based on finding areas where customers needs are not met, and then find solutions to those needs.&lt;ref name="trott26"&gt;{{cite book |last=Trott |first=Paul |title=Innovation Management and New Product Development |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=55-eltU4B5EC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22innovation+management%22#PPA26,M1 |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2005 |isbn=0273686437}}&lt;/ref&gt; To succeed with either method, an understanding of both the market and the technical problems are needed. By creating multi-functional development teams, containing both engineers and marketers, both dimensions can be solved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Boutellier, Roman |author2=Gassmann, Oliver |author3=von Zedtwitz, Maximilian |title=Managing Global Innovation |publisher=Springer |year=2000 |location=Berlin |isbn=3-540-66832-2 |pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[product lifecycle]] of products is getting shorter because of increased competition. This forces companies to reduce the [[time to market]]. Innovation managers must therefore decrease development time, without sacrificing quality or meeting the needs of the market.&lt;ref name="trott26"/&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

== Innovation management ==

Innovation management (IM)is based on some of the ideas put forth by the Austrian economist [[Joseph Schumpeter]], working during the 1930s, who identified innovation as a significant factor in economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://innovationzen.com/blog/2006/07/29/innovation-management-theory-part-1/|title=Innovation and Schumpeter’s Theories|website=innovationzen.com|access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; His book ''“[[Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy]]”'' first fully developed the concept of [[creative destruction]].

Innovation management helps an organization grasp an opportunity and use it to create and introduce new ideas, processes, or products industriously.&lt;ref name="kelly78"/&gt; Creativity is the basis of innovation management; the end goal is a change in services or business process. Innovative ideas are the result of two consecutive steps, ''imitation'' and ''invention''.&lt;ref name="godin2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Godin | first=Benoît | title=Innovation: the History of a Category | journal=Project on the Intellectual History of Innovation | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By utilizing innovation management tools, management can trigger and deploy the creative capabilities of the work force for the continuous development of a company.&lt;ref name="Clark, Charles H. 1980"/&gt; Common tools include [[brainstorming]], [[prototyping]], [[product lifecycle management]], [[ideation (creative process)|ideation]], [[TRIZ]], [[Phase–gate model]], [[project management]], [[product line]] planning and [[Project portfolio management|portfolio management]]. The process can be viewed as an evolutionary integration of organization, technology, and market, by iterating series of activities: search, select, implement and capture.&lt;ref name="Tidd, Joe and Bessant, John 2009"/&gt;

Innovation processes can either be ''pushed'' or ''pulled'' through development. A ''pushed'' process is based on existing or newly invented technology that the organization has access to. The goal is to find profitable applications for the already-existing technology. A ''pulled'' process, by contrast, is based on finding areas where customers' needs are not met and finding solutions to those needs.&lt;ref name="trott26"/&gt; To succeed with either method, an understanding of both the market and the technical problems are needed. By creating multi-functional development teams, containing both engineers and marketers, both dimensions can be solved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Boutellier, Roman |author2=Gassmann, Oliver |author3=von Zedtwitz, Maximilian | title=Managing Global Innovation | publisher=Springer | year=2000 | location=Berlin | isbn=3-540-66832-2 | pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Innovation, although not sufficient, is a necessary prerequisite for the continued survival and development of enterprises. The most direct way of business innovation is through [[technological innovation]], [[disruptive innovation]] or [[social innovation]].  Management of innovation, however, plays a significant role in promoting technological and institutional innovation.

The goal of innovation management within a company is to cultivate a suitable environment to encourage innovation.&lt;ref name='rickne2012'&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Rickne | first1 = Annika | last2 = Laestadius | first2 = Staffan | first3 = Henry | last3 = Etzkowitz | title = Innovation Governance in an Open Economy: Shaping Regional Nodes in a Globalized World | publisher = Routledge | location = United States and Canada | date = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suitable environment would help the firms get more cooperation projects, even ‘the take-off platform for business ventures’.&lt;ref name=rickne2012/&gt;{{rp|57}} Senior management's support is crucial to successful innovation; clear direction, endorsement, and support are essential to innovation pursuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Stanley Kam Sing | last = Wong | title = The role of management involvement in innovation | journal = Management Decision | volume = 51 | issue = 4 | pages = 709–729 | date = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Managing complex innovation ==

Innovation is often a [[technological change]] that outperforms a previous practice. To lead or sustain with innovations, managers need to concentrate heavily on the innovation network, which requires deep understanding of the complexity of innovation. Collaboration is an important source of innovation. Innovations are increasingly brought to the market by networks of firms, selected according to their comparative advantages, and operating in a coordinated manner.

When a technology goes through a major transformation phase and yields a successful innovation, it becomes a great learning experience, not only for the parent industry but other industries as well. Big innovations are generally the outcome of intra- and interdisciplinary networking among technological sectors, along with combination of implicit and explicit knowledge. Networking is required, but network integration is the key to success for complex innovation. Social economic zones, technology corridors, [[free trade agreement]]s, and [[technology cluster]]s are some of the ways to encourage organizational networking and cross-functional innovations.

== Innovation management tools ==
Antonio Hidalgo and Jose Albor proposed the use of typologies as an innovation management tool.&lt;ref name="hidalgoalbors08"&gt;{{cite news |author1=Hidalgo A.  |author2=Albors J. |title=Innovation management techniques and tools: a review from theory and practice |publisher=R&amp;D Management |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study conducted at a European level used 10 typologies for knowledge-driven Innovation Management Tools. These typologies were found by looking at 32 characteristics&lt;ref name="ec04"&gt;{{cite book |author1=European Commission |title=Innovation Management and the knowledge-driven economy |url=https://cordis.europa.eu/innovation-policy/studies/pdf/studies_innovation_management_final_report.pdf |publisher=Directorate-general for Enterprise |location=Luxembourg |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; that classify Innovation Management Tools. Hidalgo and Albors were able to narrow the list down to 8 criteria (knowledge-driven focus, strategic impact, degree of availability, level of documentation, practical usefulness, age of the IMT, required resources for implementation, measurability), that are especially relevant for IMTs in the knowledge-driven economy ([[knowledge economy]]). The advantage of using typologies is the easy integration of new methods and the availability of a broader scope of tools.

==Economic theory==
In economic theory, the management of innovation has been studied by [[Philippe Aghion]] and [[Jean Tirole]] (1994).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aghion|first=P.|last2=Tirole|first2=J.|date=1994|title=The Management of Innovation|url=https://doi.org/10.2307/2118360|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|language=en|volume=109|issue=4|pages=1185–1209|doi=10.2307/2118360|issn=0033-5533|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aghion|first=Philippe|last2=Tirole|first2=Jean|date=1994|title=Opening the black box of innovation|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0014-2921(94)90105-8|journal=European Economic Review|volume=38|issue=3-4|pages=701–710|doi=10.1016/0014-2921(94)90105-8|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their work is based on the Grossman-Hart-Moore property rights approach to the [[theory of the firm]]. According to this theory, the optimal allocation of property rights helps to alleviate the [[hold-up problem]] (an underinvestment problem that occurs when investments are non-contractible). In the work of [[Oliver Hart (economist)|Oliver Hart]] and his co-authors, the parties agree on the ownership structure that maximizes the parties’ expected total surplus (which they can divide with suitable up-front transfer payments according to their ex ante bargaining power). In contrast, Aghion and Tirole argue that in the relationship between a research unit and a customer the parties might not agree on the optimal ownership structure, since research units are often cash-constrained and thus cannot make up-front payments to customers. The model is also known as “the R&amp;D game” (Tirole, 1999).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tirole|first=Jean|date=1999|title=Incomplete Contracts: Where do We Stand?|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/1468-0262.00052|journal=Econometrica|language=en|volume=67|issue=4|pages=741–781|doi=10.1111/1468-0262.00052|issn=1468-0262|via=|citeseerx=10.1.1.465.9450}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laboratory research using the methods of experimental economics has found support for the theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kusterer|first=David J.|last2=Schmitz|first2=Patrick W.|date=2017|title=The management of innovation: Experimental evidence|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geb.2017.06.011|journal=Games and Economic Behavior|volume=104|pages=706–725|doi=10.1016/j.geb.2017.06.011|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Lord Bowes''' (21 June 1834 – 27 October 1899) was a wealthy Liverpool (UK) wool broker, art collector and patron of the arts, author and authority on Japan and its art, and benefactor. In 1888 he was appointed the first foreign-born Japanese Consul in Great Britain, a post he held until his sudden death in 1899 at the age of 65. In 1890, in the grounds of Streatlam Tower,&lt;ref&gt;See Wikipedia page: Grade II listed buildings in Liverpool-L8&lt;/ref&gt; his home in the Toxteth area of Liverpool, he opened to the public the first dedicated museum of Japanese art in the western world.&lt;ref&gt;Liverpool Mercury, 20 June 1890. Also The Japanese Consul,p95&lt;/ref&gt;
James Lord Bowes was born in Horsforth, Leeds, UK, the youngest of six surviving children of John Bowes (Wool Stapler) and Elizabeth Bowes (née Lord). The family moved to Liverpool sometime between 1840-1845 after the death of John Bowes.  [[File:Portrait of James Lord Bowes circa 1875.png|thumb|alt=Portrait of James Lord Bowes.|James Lord Bowes circa 1875.]]

== History ==
As a young man, Bowes attended the Liverpool Collegiate Institution, a short distance from his home in the Islington area of Liverpool. Upon leaving college, he worked for nearly seven years in a merchant's office gaining useful experience in general merchandising, including the city's well-established cotton trade.&lt;ref&gt;The Japanese Consul,p10.(Family Archive)&lt;/ref&gt;

When he was 22, he joined his brother John who had just set up on his own account as a wool broker. The business prospered and in January 1859 he was made a full partner in the firm of John L. Bowes &amp; Brother, Wool Brokers. In that same year, the business moved to the newly erected Queens Insurance Building in 11 Dale Street and the Bowes family moved house to the more up-market Canning Street. James also travelled to America that year in search of new business opportunities, the first of many overseas trips he was to make in the decades that followed.&lt;ref&gt;The Japanese Consul, p18. (Family archive)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1867 James Lord Bowes moved to Streatlam Cottage, set in its own grounds adjacent to [[Strawberry Field]] in Beaconsfield Road, in semi-rural Woolton, some six miles south of Liverpool city centre.&lt;ref&gt;Gore's Directory of Liverpool, 1867, Also The Japanese Consul,p23&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1871 he married Charlotte Vickery Adam, daughter of Mary Adam (née De Bels)(1809-1898) and William Adam (1804-1867) formerly of Lisbon, Portugal. The Adam family were established importers of oranges and soft fruit based in London and Liverpool, William being the manager of their estates in Portugal. Charlotte's brother John Isabel Adam (1857-1919) was also a Wool Broker and worked for John L. Bowes and Brother. James and Charlotte had six children, the last-surviving of whom, Ruth, died in 1967, aged 94 years.

James Lord Bowes immersed himself in the commercial and artistic life of Liverpool – he was several times both Vice President of the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce and President of the Liverpool Art Club. In 1872 he commissioned the building of the imposing Streatlam Tower, 5 Princes Road, Liverpool by architect [[George Ashdown Audsley]], with whom he shared a passion for Japanese art, particularly ceramics.  From circa 1867 he had collected Japanese art works of all kinds and organised an exhibition of them in the Liverpool Art Club. Arising from this event he co-authored the Descriptive Catalogue of Japanese Lacquer ware of the Bowes Collection. 1875, and The Keramic Art of Japan. London: Sotheran &amp; Co. 1875, 1881, both with Audsley. Sending a copy of The Keramic Art of Japan to the [[Emperor Meiji]] in 1891 resulted in a reply from the Minister of the Imperial Household, [[Tokudaiji Sanetsune]] / (Sanenori) that the Emperor had sent him, in return, an Imperial gift of two bronze vases.

In 1888 Bowes was appointed the Honorary Japanese Consul at Liverpool, the first such appointment in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Liverpool Mercury, 8 December 1888 Also The Japanese Consul,p82&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890 he erected a private museum in the grounds of Streatlam Tower which he opened to the public. All the proceeds from this were directed to the benefit of his chosen charities within Liverpool. In April 1891 he hosted a Japanese Fancy Fair in the museum,&lt;ref&gt;Liverpool Reference Library 708/BOW/1&lt;/ref&gt; attracting 20,000 people in six days and raising £5,290 (£580,000 in 2012 values, ref: Safalra.com) for Liverpool charities.&lt;ref&gt;Liverpool Mercury, 22 May 1891&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1891 he was awarded the Japanese Order of the Sacred Treasure, fourth class and in February 1897 he received the third class rank of the same award.

=== Death ===
Bowes died of a heart attack on a train en route from London to Liverpool on 27 October 1899 and is buried in [[Toxteth Park Cemetery]] (Smithdown Road) Liverpool.&lt;ref&gt;The Liverpool Courier,28 October 1899, also Liverpool Mercury,31 October 1899&lt;/ref&gt; The Bowes Museum of Japanese Art closed following his death. Attempts to find a new home for his extensive collection failed and the contents of the museum were sold at an 11-day public auction in Liverpool in May 1901. Charlotte died in 1923 in Liverpool at the age of 79.

'''James Wallace "Jay Boy" Adams''' (born December 8, 1949) is an American singer, songwriter, and guitarist from [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]] and [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], [[Texas]], known particularly for storytelling in his songs.

==Early years==
Adams was born in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]] but reared in [[Colorado City, Texas|Colorado City]], the seat of [[Mitchell County, Texas|Mitchell County]] south of [[Snyder, Texas|Snyder]] in [[West Texas]], where his father was the local [[Chevrolet]] dealer and a rancher.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jayboyadams.com/page2.htm|title=Jay Boy Adams biography|publisher=jayboyadams.com|accessdate=September 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon graduation in 1967 from [[Colorado Independent School District|Colorado City High School]], he entered the [[University of North Texas]] at [[Denton, Texas|Denton]], then North Texas State University, which is known for its arts and music curricula. There one of his English classmates was [[Don Henley]], later with the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]. Adams also met [[Gary Nicholson (singer)|Gary Nicholson]] while at NTSU.  Adams went to [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], to hear the guitarist [[Bugs Henderson]], who played an impact on Adams's musical development.  He fondly credits the late nights spent listening to Henderson for the neglect of his college studies.&lt;ref name=jba&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sweetwaterreporter.com/content/jay-boy-adams-perform-texas-theatre|title=Jay Boy Adams to perform at Texas Theater|publisher=''Sweetwater Reporter'', March 5, 2011|accessdate=September 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With hopes of a musical career of his own, Adams left UNT after two years and moved to Houston.  There he met John Carrick whose mother was the owner of Sand Mountain Coffee House.  His first solo performing was at Sand Mountain along with Carrick, Bobbie Jo Gentry, Jerry Jeff Walker and others.  Adams and Carrick formed "Hayseed" a short lived band experimenting with original songs and then performing in and around [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] and at Alan's Landing.  Once there, Adams met the guitarist [[Billy Gibbons]] of The Moving Sidewalks, and played at The Cellar.&lt;ref name=jba/&gt; In late 1969 he moved to [[Midland, Texas|Midland]] where he joined the house band at The Chateau Club led by [[Johnny Heartsman]]. Adams credited Heartsman as a major influence.  He attended [[Howard College]], a [[community college]] in [[Big Spring, Texas|Big Spring]], Texas, with the goal of improving his grade-point average so that he could re-enter a university. Meanwhile, he lost his draft deferment during the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name=intv&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualubbock.com/intJayBoyAdams.html|title=Interview: Jay Boy Adams|publisher=virtuallubbock.com|accessdate=September 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1972, [[Steve Moss]], a friend secured Adams a spot with the [[ZZ Top]] band in Lubbock. That summer he gained entry to [[Texas Tech University]] in Lubbock to study music and English. ZZ Top's  manager, [[Bill Ham]], soon invited Adams to play for the band at the Municipal Auditorium in Dallas. By 1976, Adams had signed with [[Atlantic Records]], which in 1977 released his first music. After two albums Atlantic did not renew his contract.  Late 1980 manager [[Bill Ham]] sent Adams to Capricorn Records in Macon, GA to record.  His last recordings were done there with Paul Hornsby producing.  Early 1981 before the album was completed Capricorn Records filed bandruptsy.  Probably his best unfinished work to date was locked away in the legal vault.  He and his band continued to perform and tour but by 1982 Adams had had enough and withdrew from the music scene.  Adams is known for his ability for storytelling in song, a mixture of blues, [[rock and roll]], [[Country music|country]], and folk music.  In those years, Adams often spent more than half of the year in concert tours.&lt;ref name=jba/&gt; He performed not only with ZZ Top, but the [[Allman Brothers Band]], [[Marshall Tucker Band]], [[Joe Cocker]], and many others. In the Cocker band for a time was a saxophone player, [[Bobby Keys]], originally from [[Slaton, Texas|Slaton]] in [[Lubbock County, Texas|Lubbock County]], who began touring with many bands as a young teenager. Keys and Adams had not previously met but toured together for a time with Cocker.&lt;ref name=intv/&gt;  It had been years since Bobby Keys had seen Lubbock.  Adams  invited Keys to return and play with his band at the first Joe Ely Tornado Jam.

==Later career==
By 1982, faced with mounting family obligations, Adams left the music business and avoided music clubs and concerts for most of the following  fifteen years. Instead, he operated and still maintains the company, Roadhouse Transportation, which leases touring coaches to such celebrity singers as [[Celine Dion]], [[ZZ Top]], and [[Bruce Springsteen]] and even the [[Dallas Cowboys]]. He did for a time make a few annual musical appearances in Lubbock and in 1986 played there at the Cattle Baron’s Ball with [[Reba McEntire]]. He moved his family to a ranch in the [[Texas Hill Country]] and his business to the town of [[Comfort, Texas|Comfort]] in [[Kendall County, Texas|Kendall County]], part of the [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]] [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. One evening Adams and his wife, Mary F. Adams, attended a show in San Antonio to hear the musician [[Lee Roy Parnell]], who invited Adams to join him on stage. Thereafter, Adams's desire to perform in public was rekindled and became irresistible.&lt;ref name=jba/&gt;

In 1999, Adams joined George Strait's national tour. He toured Europe with the [[Tejano]] group, the [[Texas Tornados]]. He became the co-manager of the popular singer [[Pat Green]], whom Adams met when Green came looking for touring accommodations. By 2007, Adams released the album "The Shoe Box", which reached No. 5 on the Americana chart. The album offers ten new Adams selections and three from the late 1970s. "The Shoe Box" produced three top 10 single songs the Texas Music Chart, where it was posted for some two years. Singer [[Stephen Stills]], an avid listener of "The Shoe Box," declared Adams "a great musician and a storyteller in the true Texas tradition" and invited him to join Stills' national tour.&lt;ref name=jba/&gt;

In 2005, Adams was featured on [[Bob Phillips]]'s ''[[Texas Country Reporter]]'' [[Television syndication|syndicated]] television [[anthology]] [[television series|series]], with an explanation for his return to professional music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.texascountryreporter.com/show05.htm |title=Jay Boy Adams |publisher=texascountryreporter.com, May 28, 2005 |accessdate=September 3, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323074921/http://www.texascountryreporter.com/show05.htm |archivedate=March 23, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 12, 2011, Adams performed in concert at the landmark Texas Theater in [[Sweetwater, Texas|Sweetwater]] in [[Nolan County, Texas|Nolan County]], near his hometown of Colorado City. It was the first concert in some seventy years at that facility, which had originally been designed for musical programs but converted to films after its opening.&lt;ref name=jba/&gt;

The current lineup of Adams' band, The Roadhouse Scholars, include Sam Hendricks on Hammond B3 and piano, Mark Butzirus on drums, and Ronnie Leatherman on bass guitar.  It is commonplace to see other musicians join Adams on stage.  Currently Adams splits his time between Texas and Santa Fe, New Mexico, and plays regularly when in Santa Fe with a host of local and transplanted musicians from various parts of the USA.  He is frequently seen performing in most of the popular night spots in Santa Fe that include El Farol, Evangelo's, and The Cowgirl.

Adams is an artist through [[Wounded Bird Records]]. He has recently joined forces with other musical veterans in the rock group, Brothers of the Southland which include key members from southern rock pioneers The Outlaws, The Allman Brothers Band, The Marshall Tucker Band, Wet Willie, The Black Crowes, and new comer Bo Bice.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; Though his touring coach business is based in Kendall County (San Antonio), Adams kept Lubbock as his musical home. "Lubbock is the capital of West Texas. There has been so much talent come out of there, and really . . . none of it has been very commercial. [[Buddy Holly]] wasn't commercial when he [first] came out of there."&lt;ref name=intv/&gt; Among those to whom Adams was referring was [[Don Allison]], an area musician associated with various genres of music and a long-time producer at the [[Cactus Theater]] in Lubbock, where Adams has also frequently performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lubbockonline.com/entertainment/2011-05-25/lubbock-musician-don-allison-loses-battle-cancer-age-49?v=1306287180|title=William Kerns, Lubbock musician Don Allison loses battle with cancer at age 49: Musician Don Allison lost four-year battle with cancer and died Tuesday", May 25, 2011|publisher=''[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]]''|accessdate=September 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph Alphonse Marie Colruyt''' (2 August 1928, [[Uccle]] - 6 October 1994, [[Puget-Théniers]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mandlonline.com/IMG/pdf/archives_mm_ef_entreprise.pdf Short biography]&lt;/ref&gt; was a Belgian business owner. He was the son of [[Franz Colruyt]], founder of the [[Colruyt]] company. Under his leadership, the company began the Colruyt retail chain known for its "lowest price" strategy.

== Career ==

When Colruyt took over the company from his father Franz in 1958, the company was a dry food wholesaler. As it became more expensive to deliver small-volume orders to smaller stores, he opened the first ''Cash &amp; Carry'' (briefly called 'Cash') in Hall in 1964: a self-service formula for independent shop keepers.

In the mid-1960s, Jo Colruyt chose to switch to retail and took over the self-service business Verloo in [[Elsene]] and launched his lowest prices policy, offering famous brands 10% cheaper.

This was when the struggle for efficiency, simplicity and economy typical of Colruyt stores began. At the time, the company was nearly broke. In 1976 all stores took the name Colruyt.

=== Less successful initiatives ===

At the end of the 1970s and into the early 1980s, Colruyt launched various businesses with varying success. Examples include an auto rental agency, selling wooden homes of Finlandia Hus, 'Auto Frit' mobile chip stalls and 'Green Pepper' self-service restaurants. These businesses were suspended in the mid-1980s.

=== Turnabout after crisis situation ===

In the mid-1980s the Colruyt company was almost bankrupt, competing with newcomer [[Aldi]]. From 1988 the company slowly returned to profitability. Activities included the continuation of low prices on about 300 products. In 1987 the company replaced the [[punched card]] with price labels and 'full scanning' at the cash register. Replenishment, stock management and orders were automated with [[bar code]] scanners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Colruyt India|title=History|url=http://www.colruyt.in/colruytindia/static/colruytAboutColruytReadMore.htm|accessdate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Management ===

Colruyt introduced a horizontal corporate structure with as few managers as possible. He paid attention to employee participation and viewed training in personnel as important.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.standaard.be/artikel/detail.aspx?artikelid=DST24121999_051|title=Biznews Jo Colruyt|date=23 December 1999|work=[[De Standaard]]|accessdate=2013-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==

After 35 years as the head of the company Jo Colruyt died in 1994. His son [[Jef Colruyt]] took over company management.

== Recognition ==

In 1992, Jo Colruyt was elected Manager of the Year by the magazine ''Trends''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.standaard.be/artikel/detail.aspx?artikelid=DST09012003_101|title=Honorary citizen of Beersel|date=16 July 2012|work=[[De Standaard]]|accessdate=2013-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, he and other self-government advocates founded the [[Democratic Self-Government Party of Hong Kong]] to call for the internal self-government in Hong Kong. He was soon squeezed out from the party leadership. Without any result, the self-government party became less active in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Ma"/&gt;

In 1983, his position in the UNAHK was squeezed out and replaced by a [[pro-Beijing camp|pro-Beijing]] leadership. Afterwards, he left the association. He continued to hold the "Hyde Park Forum" at the City Hall until his death in 1994. He was remembered with his iconic long beard and [[changshan|cheongsam]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26626">'''Mobile Business Intelligence''' (Mobile BI or Mobile Intelligence) is defined as “Mobile BI is a system comprising both technical and organizational elements that present historical and/or real-time information to its users for analysis on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets (not laptops), to enable effective decision-making and management support, for the overall purpose of increasing firm performance.” (Peters et al., 2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peters|first=Twan|last2=Isik|first2=Öykü|last3=Olgerta|first3=Tona|last4=Popovic|first4=Aleš | title = How system quality influences mobile BI use: The mediating role of engagement | journal= (IJIM) International Journal of Information Management|date=2016|volume=36|issue=5|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0268401216300779|doi=10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2016.05.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Business intelligence]] (BI) refers to computer-based techniques used in spotting, digging-out, and analyzing business data, such as sales revenue by products and/or departments or associated costs and incomes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessdictionary.com/ BusinessDictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the concept of mobile computing has been prevalent for over a decade, Mobile BI has shown a momentum/growth only very recently.{{when|date=June 2011}} This change has been partly encouraged by a change from the ‘wired world’ to a wireless world with the advantage of [[smartphones]] which has led to a new era of mobile computing, especially in the field of BI.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.information-management.com/specialreports/2008_89/10001705-1.html?pg=1Mobile Business Intelligence for Intelligent Businesses]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Aberdeen Group, a large number of companies are rapidly undertaking mobile BI owing to a large number of market pressures such as the need for higher efficiency in business processes, improvement in employee productivity (e.g., time spent looking for information), better and faster decision making, better customer service, and delivery of real-time bi-directional data access to make decisions anytime and anywhere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://intelligent-enterprise.informationweek.com/channels/enterprise_applications/development/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=VCS3TZ0FEKCO5QE1GHRSKHWATMY32JVN?articleID=212300110 Mobile Business Intelligence: Best-in-Class Secrets to Success]&lt;/ref&gt; But despite the apparent advantages of mobile information delivery, mobile BI is still in the ‘early adopter’ phase. Some CFOs remain skeptical of the business benefits and with the perceived lack of specific business use cases and tangible ROI, mobile BI adoption is still behind the curve compared with other enterprise mobile applications.&lt;ref&gt;FSN publication, [http://www.fsn.co.uk/channel_bi_bpm_cpm/why_cfos_must_embrace_the_new_era_of_mobile_bi_and_enterprise_performance_management   "Why CFOs must embrace the new era of mobile BI and Enterprise Performance Management "], July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

=== Information delivery to mobile devices ===
The predominant method for accessing BI information is using proprietary software or a [[Web browser]] on a personal computer to connect to BI applications. These BI applications request data from databases. Starting in the late 1990s, BI systems offered alternatives for receiving [[data]], including email and mobile devices.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}.

===Static data push===
Initially, mobile devices such as pagers and mobile phones received pushed data using a short message service ([[SMS]]) or text messages. These applications were designed for specific mobile devices, contained minimal amounts of information, and provided no data interactivity.  As a result, the early mobile BI applications were expensive to design and maintain while providing limited informational value, and garnered little interest.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

===Data access via a mobile browser===
The [[mobile browser]] on a [[smartphone]], a handheld computer integrated with a mobile phone,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=Smartphone&amp;i=51537,00.asp Smartphone definition]&lt;/ref&gt; provided a means to read simple tables of data. The small screen space, immature mobile browsers, and slow data transmission could not provide a satisfactory BI experience.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}
Accessibility and bandwidth may be perceived as issues when it comes to mobile technology, but BI solutions provide advanced functionality to predict and outperform such potential challenges.  While Web-based mobile BI solutions provide little to no control over the processing of data in a network, managed BI solutions for mobile devices only utilize the server for specific operations. In addition, local reports are compressed both during transmission and on the device, permitting greater flexibility for storage and receipt of these reports. Within a mobile environment, users capitalize on easy access to information because the mobile application operates within a single authoring environment that permits access to all BI content (respecting existing security) regardless of language or locale. Furthermore, the user will not need to build and maintain a separate mobile BI deployment.  In addition, mobile BI requires much less bandwidth for functionality.  Mobile BI promises a small report footprint on memory, encryption during transmission as well as on the device, and compressed data storage for offline viewing and use.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.information-management.com/specialreports/2008_111/10002254-1.html?pg=2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mobile client application===
In 2002, [[Research in Motion]] released the first [[BlackBerry]] smartphone optimized for wireless email use. [[Wireless e-mail]] proved to be the “killer app” that accelerated the popularity of the smartphone market.  By the mid-2000s, Research in Motion’s BlackBerry had solidified its hold on the smartphone market with both corporate and governmental organizations. The BlackBerry smartphones eliminated the obstacles to mobile business intelligence. The BlackBerry offered a consistent treatment of data across its many models, provided a much larger screen for viewing data, and allowed user interactivity via the thumbwheel and keyboard.  BI vendors re-entered the market with offerings spanning different mobile operating systems (BlackBerry, [[Windows]], [[Symbian]]) and data access methods. The two most popular data access options were:

* to use the mobile browser to access data, similar to desktop computer, and
* to create a native application designed specifically for the mobile device.&lt;ref&gt;[http://intelligent-enterprise.informationweek.com/channels/business_intelligence/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=QJ2ILLXEXQ0SDQE1GHOSKHWATMY32JVN?articleID=207801077&amp;cid=RSSfeed_IE_News Intelligence on the Go: Mobile Delivery of BI]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Research in Motion]] is continuing to lose market share to [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] smartphones.  In the first three months of 2011 Google’s Android OS gained 7 points of market share.  During the same time period RIM’s market share collapsed and dropped almost 5 points.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.businessinsider.com/2011-04-02/tech/30089528_1_android-phones-google-s-android-smartphone-market&lt;/ref&gt;

===Purpose-built Mobile BI apps===
Apple quickly set the standard for mobile devices with the introduction of the [[iPhone]]. In the first three years, Apple sold over 33.75 million units.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2009/04/22results.html Apple Reports Second Quarter Results] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521104112/http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2009/04/22results.html |date=2011-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, in 2010, Apple sold over 1 million iPads in just under three months.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cnbc.com/id/36911690 Apple Sells 1 Million iPads]&lt;/ref&gt; Both devices feature an interactive touchscreen display that is the de facto standard on many mobile phones and tablet computers.

In 2008, Apple published the [[Software development kit|SDK]] for which developers can build applications that run natively on the iPhone and iPad instead of Safari-based applications. These native applications can give the user a robust, easier-to-read and easier-to-navigate experience.

Others were quick to join in the success of mobile devices and app downloads. The [[Google Play Store]] now has over 700,000 apps available for the mobile devices running the Android operating system.

More importantly, the advent of the mobile device has radically changed the way people use data on their mobile devices. This includes mobile BI. Business intelligence applications can be used to transform reports and data into mobile dashboards, and have them instantly delivered to any mobile device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/software/systems_management/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=224400267 |title=Mobile BI Apps Target iPad |last=Henschen |first=Doug |date=April 15, 2010 |work=InformationWeek }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google Inc.’s [[Android (operating system)|Android]] has overtaken Apple Inc.’s iOS in the wildly growing arena of app downloads. In the second quarter of 2011, 44% of all apps downloaded from app marketplaces across the web were for Android devices while 31% were for Apple devices, according to new data from ABI Research. The remaining apps were for various other mobile operating systems, including BlackBerry and Windows Phone 7.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.internetretailer.com/2011/10/26/android-surpasses-apple-app-download-share&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobile BI applications have evolved from being a client application for viewing data to a purpose-built application designed to provide information and workflows necessary to quickly make business decisions and take action.

===Web Applications vs. Device-Specific Applications for Mobile BI===
In early 2011, as the mobile BI software market started to mature and adoption started to grow at a significant pace in both small and large enterprises, most vendors adopted either a purpose-built, device-specific application strategy (e.g. [[iPhone]] or [[Android (operating system)|Android]] apps, downloaded from [[iTunes]] or the [[Google Play Store]]) or a web application strategy (browser-based, works on most devices without an application being installed on the device).  This debate continues and there are benefits and drawbacks to both methods.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eckerson, Wayne]]. [http://www.b-eye-network.com/blogs/eckerson/archives/2011/04/architecting_fo.php "Architecting for Mobile BI"], ''BeyeNetwork'', April 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  One potential solution will be the wider adoption of [[HTML5]] on mobile devices which will give web applications many of the characteristics of dedicated applications while still allowing them to work on many devices without an installed application.

[[Microsoft]] has announced their mobile BI strategy.  [[Microsoft]] plans to support browser-based applications such as Reporting Services and PerformancePoint on iOS in the first half of 2012 and touch-based applications on iOS and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] by the second half of 2012.  
Despite popular perception that [[Microsoft]] only acknowledges its own existence, recent moves suggest the company is aware that it is not the only player in the technology ecosystem. Instead of attempting to squelch competition or suggesting new technology developments were ridiculous, the company has instead decided to make its technology accessible to a wider audience.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cmswire.com/cms/mobile/microsoft-announces-mobile-business-intelligence-strategy-013091.php&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many mobile devices and platforms available today. The list is constantly growing and so is the platform support. There are hundreds of models available today, with multiple hardware and software combinations. The enterprise must select a device very carefully. The target devices will impact the mobile BI design itself because the design for a smartphone will be different than for a tablet. The screen size, processor, memory, etc. all vary. The mobile BI program must account for lack of device standardization from the providers by constantly testing devices for the mobile BI apps.
Some best practices can always be followed. For example, a smartphone is a good candidate for operational mobile BI. However, for analytics and what-if analysis, tablets are the best option. Hence, the selection or availability of the device plays a big role in the implementation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.information-management.com/newsletters/mobile_BI_integration_apps_data_management-10020527-1.html?pg=3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demand==
[[Gartner]] analyst Ted Friedman believes that mobile delivery of BI is all about practical, tactical information needed to make immediate decisions – "The biggest value is in operational BI — information in the context of applications — not in pushing lots of data to somebody's phone."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9179090/Business_intelligence_goes_mobile?taxonomyId=9&amp;pageNumber=1 Business Intelligence Goes Mobile]&lt;/ref&gt;

Accessing the Internet through a mobile device such as a smartphone is also known as the mobile Internet or [[mobile Web]]. IDC expects the US mobile workforce to increase by 73% in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://img.en25.com/web/CitrixOnline/IDC_MobileWorker_excerpt_0_0.pdf Worldwide Mobi le Worker Population 2007–2011 Forecast]&lt;/ref&gt;  Morgan Stanley reports the mobile Internet is ramping up faster than its predecessor, the desktop Internet&lt;!--? No chart present in article... (see chart on the right)--&gt;, enabling companies to deliver knowledge to their mobile workforce to help them make more profitable decisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.morganstanley.com/institutional/techresearch/pdfs/Internet_Trends_041210.pdf Morgan Stanley - Internet Trends]&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Cooney from [[Gartner]] has identified bring-your-own-technology at work as becoming the norm, not the exception. By 2015 media tablet shipments will reach around 50% of laptop shipments and Windows 8 will likely be in third place behind Android and  Apple.  The net result is that Microsoft’s share of the client platform, be it PC, tablet or smartphone, will likely be reduced to 60% and it could fall below 50%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cio.com/article/692031/Gartner_the_Top_10_Strategic_Technology_Trends_for_2012?source=ctwartcio&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business Benefits==
In its latest [[Magic Quadrant]] for Business Intelligence Platforms, [[Gartner]] examines whether the platform enables users to "fully interact with BI content delivered to mobile devices."   The phrase "fully interact" is the key. The ability to send alerts embedded in email or text messages, or links to static content in email messages hardly represents sophistication in mobile analytics. 
For users to benefit from mobile BI, they must be able to navigate dashboard and guided analytics comfortably—or as comfortably as the mobile device will allow, which is where devices with high-resolution screens and touch interfaces (like the [[iPhone]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]]-based phones) have a clear edge over, say, earlier editions of [[BlackBerry]]. 
It is equally important to take a step back to define your purpose and adoption patterns. Which business users can benefit the most from mobile analytics—and what, exactly, is their requirement? You don't need mobile analytics to send a few alerts or summary reports to their handhelds—without interactivity, mobile BI is indistinguishable from merely informative email or text messages.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.informationweek.com/news/software/bi/229300446&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Similar to consumer applications, which have shown an ever-increasing growth over the past few years, a constant demand for anytime, anywhere access to BI is leading to a number of custom mobile application development.&lt;ref name="searchcio.techtarget.com"&gt;[http://searchcio.techtarget.com/news/1376914/IPhone-need-for-features-driving-plans-for-mobile-BI-app-development iPhone, Need for Features Driving Plans for Mobile BI App Development]&lt;/ref&gt; Businesses have also started adopting mobile solutions for their workforce and are soon becoming key components of core business processes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://download.microsoft.com/download/A/9/F/A9F105FF-3C62-44B1-A1AE-71E267C31CFE/LOB_for_Midsize_Business_ROI_IDC_White_Paper.pdf Mobile Line-of-Business Applications for the Midsize Business: An ROI Analysis]&lt;/ref&gt; In an Aberdeen survey conducted in May 2010, 23% of companies participating indicated that they now have a mobile BI app or dashboard in place, while another 31% indicated that they plan to implement some form of mobile BI in the next year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itbusiness.ca/it/client/en/home/News.asp?id=58375 Mobile BI - A Bonanza for many Businesses]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Definitions===
Mobile BI applications can be defined/segregated as follows:

* '''Mobile Browser Rendered App''': Almost any mobile device enables Web-based, thin client, HTML-only BI applications. However, these apps are static and provide little data interactivity.  Data is viewed just as it would be over a browser from a personal computer.  Little additional effort is required to display data but mobile browsers can typically only support a small subset of the interactivity of a web browser.
* '''Customized App''': A step up from this approach is to render each (or all) reports and dashboards in device-specific format. In other words, provide information specific to the screen size, optimize usage of screen real estate, and enable device-specific navigation controls. Examples of these include thumb wheel or thumb button for BlackBerry, up/down/left/right arrows for Palm, gestural manipulation for iPhone. This approach requires more effort than the previous but no additional software.
* '''Mobile Client App''':  The most advanced, the client app provides full interactivity with the BI content viewed on the device. In addition, this approach provides periodic caching of data which can be viewed and analyzed even offline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.forrester.com/business_process/2009/11/not-all-mobile-bi-applications-are-created-equal.html Not all BI Applications are Created Equal]&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies across all verticals, from retail&lt;ref&gt;[http://intelligent-enterprise.informationweek.com/channels/business_intelligence/customer_intelligence/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=ZIXKX1N5D25C1QE1GHOSKHWATMY32JVN?articleID=207801077&amp;pgno=2 Intelligence on the Go: Mobile Delivery of BI]&lt;/ref&gt; to even non-profit organizations&lt;ref&gt;[http://napps.networkworld.com/news/2010/071410-mobile-bi-can-be-quick.html Mobile BI can be Quick]&lt;/ref&gt; are realizing the value of purpose-specific mobile applications suited for their mobile workforce.

==Development==
Developing a native mobile BI app poses challenges, especially concerning data display rendering and user interactivity.  Mobile BI App development has traditionally been a time-consuming and expensive effort requiring businesses to justify the investment for the mobile workforce. They do not only require texting and alerts, they need information customized for their line of work which they can interact with and analyze to gain deeper information.&lt;ref name="searchcio.techtarget.com"/&gt;

===Custom-coded Mobile BI Apps===
Mobile BI applications are often custom-coded apps specific to the underlying mobile operating system.  For example, the iPhone apps require coding in [[Objective-C]] while Android apps require coding in Java.  In addition to the user functionality of the app, the app must be coded to work with the supporting server infrastructure required to serve data to the mobile BI app.  While custom-coded apps offer near limitless options, the specialized software coding expertise and infrastructure can be expensive to develop, modify, and maintain.

===Fixed-form Mobile BI Applications===
Business data can be displayed in a mobile BI client (or web browser) that serves as a user interface to existing BI platforms or other data sources, eliminating the need for new master sources of data and specialized server infrastructure.  This option offers fixed and configurable data visualizations such as charts, tables, trends, KPIs, and links, and can usually be deployed quickly using existing data sources.  However, the data visualizations are not limitless and cannot always be extended to beyond what is available from the vendor.

===Graphical Tool-developed Mobile BI Apps===
Mobile BI apps can also be developed using the graphical, drag-and-drop development environments of BI platforms.  The advantages including the following:

# Apps can be developed without coding,
# Apps can be easily modified and maintained using the BI platform change management tools,
# Apps can use any range of data visualizations and not be limited to just a few,
# Apps can incorporate specific business workflows, and
# The BI platform provides the server infrastructure.

Using graphical BI development tools can allow faster mobile BI app development when a custom application is required.

==Security Considerations for Mobile BI Apps==
{{see also|Mobile security}}
High adoption rates and reliance on mobile devices makes safe mobile computing a critical concern.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gigaom.com/2010/09/09/mobile-security-needs-rise-with-smartphone-sales/ Mobile Security Needs Rise With Smartphone Sales]&lt;/ref&gt; The Mobile Business Intelligence Market Study discovered that security is the number one issue (63%) for organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://businesssintelligence.blogspot.com/ Business Intelligence Blog by Howard Dresner]&lt;/ref&gt;

A comprehensive mobile security solution must provide security at these levels:&lt;ref name="na.blackberry.com"&gt;[http://na.blackberry.com/ataglance/get_the_facts/Successful_Mobile_Deployments.pdf Successful Mobile Deployments Require Robust Security]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Device
* Transmission
* Authorization, Authentication, and [[Network security]]

===Device Security===
A senior analyst at the Burton Group research firm recommends that the best way to ensure data will not be tampered with is to not store it on the client device (mobile device). As such, there is no local copy to lose if the mobile device is stolen and the data can reside on servers within the data center with access permitted only over the network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cio.com/article/40360/Mobile_Security_Definition_and_Solutions?page=1&amp;taxonomyId=3061 Mobile Security Definition and Solutions]&lt;/ref&gt;  Most [[smartphone]] manufacturers provide a complete set of security features including full-disk encryption, email encryption, as well as remote management which includes the ability to wipe contents if device is lost or stolen.&lt;ref name="na.blackberry.com"/&gt; Also, some devices have embedded third-party antivirus and firewall software such as [[Research In Motion|RIM]]'s [[BlackBerry]].&lt;ref name="na.blackberry.com"/&gt;

===Transmission Security===
Transmission security refers to measures that are designed to protect data from unauthorized interception, traffic analysis, and imitative deception.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/transmission-security]&lt;/ref&gt; These measures include [[Transport Layer Security|Secure Sockets Layer]] (SSL), iSeries Access for Windows, and [[virtual private network]] (VPN) connections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/iseries/v5r4/index.jsp?topic=/rzaj4/rzaj45zhcryptointro.htm IBM: Transmission security options]&lt;/ref&gt; A secure data transmission should enable the identity of the sender and receiver to be verified by using a cryptographic shared key system as well as protect the data to be modified by a third party when it crosses the network. This can be done using [[Advanced Encryption Standard process|AES]] or [[Triple DES]] with an encrypted [[Transport Layer Security|SSL]] tunnel.&lt;ref name="na.blackberry.com"/&gt;

===Authorization, Authentication, and Network Security===
Authorization refers to the act of specifying access rights to control access of information to users.&lt;ref&gt;[[Authorization|Wikipedia Article - Authorization]]&lt;/ref&gt; Authentication refers to the act of establishing or confirming the user as true or authentic.&lt;ref&gt;[[Authentication|Wikipedia Article - Authentication]]&lt;/ref&gt; Network security refers to all the provisions and policies adopted by the network administrator to prevent and monitor unauthorized access, misuse, modification, or denial of the computer network and network-accessible resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.networksfirst.com/knowledge-base/glossary/network-security-definition/ Definition of Network Security]&lt;/ref&gt; The mobility adds to unique security challenges. As data is trafficked beyond the enterprise firewall towards unknown territories, ensuring that it is handled safely is of paramount importance. Towards this, proper authentication of user connections, centralized access control (like LDAP Directory), encrypted data transfer mechanisms can be implemented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expertstown.com/mobile-business-intelligence Expertstown.com - Mobile Business Intelligence]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of BI for Securing Mobile Apps===
To ensure high security standards, BI software platforms must extend the authentication options and policy controls to the mobile platform. Business intelligence software platforms need to ensure a secure encrypted keychain for storage of credentials. Administrative control of password policies should allow creation of security profiles for each user and seamless integration with centralized security directories to reduce administration and maintenance of users.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

He is  the longest-serving chief executive of the [[beverage]] industry in the [[Middle East]]. He is the co-founder and was chief executive of Dubai Refreshments ([[Pepsi]]), in [[Dubai]], and institutionalized the soft drink industry in the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticle.asp?xfile=data/theuae/2005/October/theuae_October17.xml&amp;section=theuae&amp;col=|title=Recalling Dubai of yore|last=Rahman|first=Lina Adbul|website=www.khaleejtimes.com|access-date=2018-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==
A graduate of [[Cairo University]] with a bachelor's degree in [[Commerce]], Mohamed Zakaria arrived in [[Dubai]] in 1960 to gain work experience and then  afterward, attend [[Michigan State University]] where he had been accepted for a [[MBA]].  His previous work in [[Egypt]] at the Government Accountancy Department, promoted him to explore an offer he had gotten by the late [[Sultan bin Ali Al Owais]], a [[philanthropist]], [[poet]], businessman and former [[Minister (government)|Minister]] of the UAE. In early 1962  he was appointed the head [[accountant]] for the Al Owais [[family business]].  Along with  Shaikh [[Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum]] the Al Owais, Al Mulla family and  [[Qais Bin Abdul Munaim Al Zawawi]], he negotiated the deal to make Dubai the first place in the Middle East to bottle, distribute and market the [[Pepsi]] brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticle.asp?xfile=data/theuae/2005/October/theuae_October17.xml&amp;section=theuae&amp;col=|title=Recalling Dubai of yore|last=Rahman|first=Lina Adbul|website=www.khaleejtimes.com|access-date=2018-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, along with the late [[Qais Bin Abdul Munaim Al Zawawi]] the [[Deputy Prime Minister]] for Economic and Financial Affairs of [[Oman]],  the first soft drink and beverage manufacturer was brought to the [[Sultanate]]. He is its [[Entrepreneur|founder]], and until 2006, the [[Managing Director]].

He is also a founding member of the [[National Bank of Dubai]] in 1962, which later merged in 2009 to form [[Emirates NBD]].

In 1980, along with Sheikh [[Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum]] and Sultan Al Owais he founded, Jeema Mineral Water Company. In 1999 he introduced private labeling to the region.

In 2000, under his leadership, Pepsi in Dubai captured 70% of the [[UAE]] market share and had its highest ever net profit of 17 [[United Arab Emirates dirham|AED]] million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www1.albawaba.com/ar/node/328943|title=Pepsi Cola to captures 70 percent of Dubai soft drinks market|date=2000-12-27|work=Al Bawaba|access-date=2018-05-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Zakaria retired from active duty, although he still retains a significant share in the businesses he founded in both [[Dubai]] and [[Oman]]. Today he runs a real estate portfolio in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and has stakes in active UAE and Omani based [[industries]].

==Family ==
He married Shadia Shahwan (1944–1998) in 1966 and has 4 children, Ghada, Nashwa, May and Ahmed.  He has since remarried in 2006. His children hold active roles in [[Dubai]] and [[Abu Dhabi]] [[Government]] run companies, and  they also operate the day-to-day activities of the family business.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7908">[[File:Baines 1835-Mule spinning crop.jpg|thumb|Part of an 1835 engraving showing a mule scavenger at work]]

'''Scavengers''' were employed in 18th and 19th century in [[cotton mill]]s, predominantly in the UK and the United States, to clean and recoup the area underneath a [[spinning mule]].  The [[cotton]] wastage that gathered on the floor was seen as too valuable for the owners to leave and one of the simplest solutions was to employ young children to work under the machinery.  Many children suffered serious injuries while under the mules, with fingers, hands, and sometimes heads crushed by the heavy moving parts.  Legislation introduced in 1819 tried to reduce working hours and improve conditions but there were still deaths recorded well beyond the middle of the 19th century.

==Job description==
Scavengers were the lowliest of the apprentices at the cotton mills and had to endure the worst conditions.&lt;!--{{POV|date=September 2011}}--&gt;  They were employed to work under the machinery to clean up the dust and oil and to gather the cotton that had been thrown off the mule by its intense vibrations.  The tenters would not stop to allow the scavenger to work because they were paid by how much they could produce.  As the mule moved forwards the children were sent under the machine, sweeping and gathering the cotton.  They had to then time their retreat so as to not become entangled within the many moving parts.&lt;ref name="TR"&gt;[[Tony Robinson|Robinson, Tony]]. ''[[The Worst Jobs in History]]''. Pan. {{ISBN|0-330-43857-3}} pp. 164–166.&lt;/ref&gt;  These children had started in the mills at around the age of four, working as scavengers until they were eight before progressing to the role of piecers.  They worked 14 to 16 hours a day, beaten if they fell asleep, until they were 15.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cottontimes.co.uk/childreno4.htm Children of the Revolution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817164123/http://www.cottontimes.co.uk/childreno4.htm |date=17 August 2010 }}. Cotton Times. Accessed 2 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Both tertiary sources that have introduced inaccuracies. Cotton Times is a good starting point, but heavily redacted--&gt;

==Danger==
The job is noted as being one of the worst in history owing to the conditions the children had to work in.  The danger of being beneath the machines meant that they had to constantly pay attention to its movements in order to avoid serious injury.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yourdiscovery.com/history/worst_jobs/georgian/index.shtml The Worst Jobs in History]. [[Discovery Channel]]. Accessed 2 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  An 1840 novel by [[Frances Trollope]] describes the work of a scavenger:
{{quotation|The miserable little creature... was a little girl about seven years old, whose office as "''scavenger''," was to collect incessantly from the machinery and from the floor, the flying fragments of cotton that might impede the work.  In the performance of this duty, the child was obliged, from time to time, to stretch itself with sudden quickness on the ground, while the hissing machinery passed over her; and when this is skilfully done, and the head, body, and outstretched limbs carefully glued to the floor, the steady-moving, but threatening mass, may pass and repass over the dizzy head and trembling body without touching it.  But accidents frequently occur; and many are the flaxen locks, rudely torn from infant heads, in the process.|Frances Trollope, ''The life and adventures of Michael Armstrong, the factory boy''&lt;ref&gt;Trollope, Frances Milton. ''The life and adventures of Michael Armstrong, the factory boy''. 1840.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While there were no requirements for factory owners to keep any records about the majority of accidents on their premises there are many anecdotal cases of scavengers suffering serious and sometimes fatal injuries.  Some lost fingers or a hand, others are said to have been decapitated.&lt;ref name="AV"&gt;Venning, Annabel. [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1312764/Britains-child-slaves-New-book-says-misery-helped-forge-Britain.html Britain's child slaves], ''[[Daily Mail]]''. 17 September 2010. Accessed 3 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  A record held at the [[Quarry Bank Mill]], now a museum, states:
{{quotation|On the 6th of March 1865 a very melancholy accident befell a lad named Joseph Foden about 13 years of age.  While engaged sweeping under a Mule his head was caught between the Roller beam and the carriage&amp;nbsp;– as the latter was putting up&amp;nbsp;– and completely smashed, death being instantaneous.&lt;ref name="TR" /&gt;}}

Research by [[Jane Humphries]], a professor of economic history at the [[University of Oxford]], revealed that a mill near Cork had such a poor safety record that six people died and 60 others were mutilated over a four-year period.&lt;ref name="AV" /&gt;&lt;!-- This cannot be verified from Daily Mail report. Which mill Overtons, Allmans who. I don't have access to Humphries book to investigate further--&gt;  [[Robert Blincoe]], a scavenger who went on to found his own cotton-spinning business, described the life of a [[child labour]]er in his book ''A Memoir of Robert Blincoe''.  He wrote about the mistreatment of workers at the cotton mills and the poor conditions that they had to endure.  He claims that on one occasion he was nearly crushed by the machine and that, despite the injuries to his head, he was beaten for not completing the sweep in a single turn.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = The Lion | volume = I | year = 1828 | first = Richard | last = Carlile | pages = 189–190}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation==
The children were sent to the mills of Derbyshire, Yorkshire and Lancashire from the [[workhouse]]s in London and other towns and cities in the south of England.  About half of the workers in Manchester and Stockport cotton factories surveyed in 1818 and 1819 had begun work at under ten years of age.  Part of the [[Factory Acts#Factory Act 1802|Factory Act of 1802]] was introduced to improve conditions for children, but it was not enough.  In the [[Factory Acts#Cotton Mills, etc. Act 1819|1819 Cotton Mills and Factories Act]] the law was updated to state that no children under the age of nine were to be employed and that children aged 9–16 years were limited to a maximum day of 16 hours.&lt;ref name="earlyfactory"&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/livinglearning/19thcentury/overview/earlyfactorylegislation/ Early factory legislation]. [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament.uk]].  Accessed 2 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  The law was difficult to enforce, but by 1835 the share of the workforce under 18 years of age in cotton mills in England and Scotland had fallen to 43%.&lt;ref&gt;Galbi, Douglas.

'''Neil Fligstein''' (born May 23, 1951) is an American [[sociologist]], and a professor at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], known for his work in [[economic sociology]], [[political sociology]] and [[organizational theory]]. He has produced both empirical and theoretical works. 

Fligstein's main theoretical works center in economic sociology where he has created a "political-cultural" approach to markets in works on corporate control,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hall | first1 = Peter A. | last2 = Taylor | first2 = Rosemary CR | year = 1996 | title = Political science and the three new institutionalisms*. | url = | journal = Political studies | volume = 44 | issue = 5| pages = 936–957 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9248.1996.tb00343.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; the "architecture of markets",&lt;ref&gt;[[Scott, W.

''Organizations evolving.'' Sage, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; He has used these ideas to study the European Union's attempt to create a single market through cooperative political means.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Euroclash: The EU, European Identity, and the Future of Europe.|last = Fligstein|first = Neil|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2008|isbn = 9780199542567|location = Oxford, U.K.|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2008, he published a book with Doug McAdam entitled ''A Theory of Fields'' that proposes a cohesive view of field theory as an approach to study many of the key features of modern life including politics, the economy, and social movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Theory of Fields|last = Fligstein|first = Neil and Doug McAdam|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2012|isbn = 9780199859948|location = New York City, N.Y.|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Born in [[Seattle, Washington]], Fligstein obtained his BA in 1973 from [[Reed College]], his MS in 1976 from the [[University of Wisconsin]], and his Ph.D. in 1979 from the [[University of Chicago|University of Wisconsin]].&lt;ref name="JSGMF 2005"&gt;John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation (2005) ''Reports of the President and of the Treasurer.'' p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

After his graduation Fligstein started his academic career in 1979 as an Assistant Professor of Sociology at the University of Arizona. From 1980 to 1982, he was at the [[National Opinion Research Center]] at the University of Chicago, where he was appointed Senior Study Director and [[National Opinion Research Center|NIMH]] Postdoctoral Fellow. Fligstein returned to the [[University of Arizona]] and in 1984 he was promoted to associate professor and in 1990 full professor. From 1984 to 1988 he was the director of the SBSRI Data and Software Library. In 1991 he moved to the University of California, Berkeley, where he was appointed Professor of Sociology. He was the department chair from 1992 to 1995. Fligstein is the founder and director of the Center for Culture, Organization, and Politics at the Institute for Research on Labor and Employment at the University of California, Berkeley; the center has been in existence since 1998.

Fligstein has been the recipient of various honors and awards. He was named the Class of 1939 Chancellor's Professor at the University of California, Berkeley in 1997.&lt;ref name="JSGMF 2005" /&gt; He was a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences in Palo Atlo, California, in 1994–95, a Guggenheim Fellow in 2004–05, and a fellow at the Rockefeller Center in Bellagio, Italy, in 2007. Fligstein was elected a member of the American Academy of arts and Sciences in 2010. He has also been a visiting scholar at many institutions including the Max Planck Institute in Cologne, the Ecole Normal Superiore-Cachan, Sciences-Po in Paris, Center for the Study of Organizations in Paris, the European University Institute in Florence, and the Copenhagen Business School.

== Work ==
Fligstein's work has mainly focused on a novel theoretical approach to develop a sociological view on how new social institutions emerge, remain stable, and are transformed. He has used this perspective to study a wide variety of seemingly disparate phenomena. Fligstein's innovation is to consider how most of social action takes place in what he calls "meso-level social orders" or fields. He is interested in theorizing how individuals and groups come to face off against one another in social arenas where there is something at stake. 

His book with Doug McAdam, ''A Theory of Fields'', makes a very general set of claims about how such orders operate. They argue that at the beginning of such projects, a social movement like process exists because of the fluid conditions in a particular social space. What is at stake, who the players are, and what will end up being the underlying logic of the order are all up for grabs. 

He is also well known for proposing how to produce a sociological view of action that makes actors key to the creation of these orders. He argues that social skill, the ability to empathize with others and thereby engage in collective action, is at the basis of gaining cooperation to produce new fields and keep existing ones going.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Social skill and the Theory of Fields|last = Fligstein|first = Neil|date = 2001|journal = Sociological Theory|doi = 10.1111/0735-2751.00132|pmid = |access-date =|volume=19|pages=105–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; He posits that actors with social skill are especially important as fields emerge as they are the one who provide collective identities that bring people together to cooperate to produce a social order.

=== Theory of markets ===
Fligstein has used his perspective in the context of developing a theory of markets.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Architecture of Markets: An Economic Sociology for 21st Century Capitalism|last = Fligstein|first = Neil|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 2001|isbn = 9780691102542|location = Princeton, N.J.|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory views the production of a new market as the creation of a meso-level social order or field. Here, competition between firms often results in the creation of markets characterized by incumbents and challengers where the incumbents' business model dominates how the market operates. He calls such a perspective a "conception of control". 

Fligstein provocatively argues that the creation of a market implies a collective stable order that works to mitigate the worse effects of competition. He also views the state as central to the construction of stable markets providing not just a general social order and a legal system, but often as a participant and regulator of many markets. In ''Architecture of Markets'',&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; he develops this approach in a quite general way and then applies it to understand the emergence of shareholder value capitalism in the U.S., the construction of labor markets across countries, the varieties of capitalism, and globalization. His "markets as politics" approach&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Markets as politics: a political-cultural approach to market institutions|last = Fligstein|first = Neil|date = 1996|journal = American Sociological Review|doi = 10.2307/2096398|pmid = |access-date =|volume=61|pages=656}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is considered to be one of the foundational works in modern economic sociology.

=== History of the large American corporation ===
Fligstein's study of the history of the large American corporation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Transformation of Corporate Control|last = Fligstein|first = Neil|publisher = Harvard University Press|year = 1990|isbn = 9780674903593|location = Cambridge, MA.|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  shows how this process evolved in the U.S. from 1870 to 1980. He shows how the conception of the corporation changed as owners and managers of firms faced challenges from competition. 

In the late 1800s and early 1900s, owners and managers worked to establish monopolies. When government challenged this in the 1910s through the use of antitrust law, firms had to have new business models that did not involve taking over entire markets. This led to the creation of oligopolies in many U.S. markets where 2–4 large firms would dominate particular markets and use their size to set prices and mitigate competition. This peaked during the 1920s as a way to avoid antitrust attention. The depression of the 1930s produced a general economic crisis. 

Fligstein shows that firms responded by diversifying their product lines and aggressively using sales and marketing tactics to increase market share and guarantee at least some market for their products. Finally, the government once again pursued antitrust policy aggressively in the post World war II era. They tried to prevent increasing product concentration within product lines. This encourage businesses to diversify even more. It gave rise to the conglomerate form and eventually to the creation of most of the modern financial tactics to engage in mergers and acquisitions in the 1950–1980s.

=== Construction of a European legal and political system ===
Fligstein has also used this framework to understand the construction of a European legal and political system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He has shown how the European Single Market project was mostly aimed at making it easier for businesses who were already involved in international trade to expand their activities across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = How to make a market: reflections on the European Union's Single Market Project|last = Fligstein|first = Neil and Iona Mara-Drita|date = 1996|journal = American Journal of Sociology|doi = 10.1086/230907|pmid = |access-date =|volume=102|pages=1–33|citeseerx =10.1.1.695.4870}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also shown how the political and legal integration in Brussels promoted trade by making it easier to trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Constructing Markets and Politics|last = Fligstein|first = Neil and Alex Stone sweet|date = 2001|journal = American Journal of Sociology|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

His book ''Euroclash: The EU, European identity, and the Future of Europe''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; shows how economic, social, and political fields have formed around Europe in the wake of the creation of the European Union. The book presents a set of analyses that show how the increased economic cooperation across Europe has transformed industries and countries. it has also create opportunities for European citizens to travel, learn second languages, and live in other countries. 

The book explores how this has affected European identities. it demonstrates that around 13% of people in Europe think of themselves mostly as Europeans. these people tend to be well educated, have professional and managerial jobs, and be politically liberal. About half of Europeans sometimes think of themselves as Europeans. Fligstein goes on to explore how this has played out across various political issues. He demonstrates that if a majority of citizens in the member states support more integration, it will occur. But he argues that most politics remains national and citizens who mainly have a national identity continue to support their nation states as their most democratic representatives.

A '''nominee trust''' is an arrangement whereby one or more persons appoint a "trustee" to be listed on legal title, or other documents, on their behalf. The arrangement is simple and passive, the trustee is to do nothing except what they are directed to do by the beneficiaries. Technically it is not a [[trust law|trust]] but an [[Agency (law)|agency]] arrangement, although it has been characterized as a hybrid between a traditional trust and an agency relationship. One use of the nominee trust is to avoid reporting the ownership of real estate on the public record. The deed, or other filed document lists the trustee, but not the undisclosed principals. Another use is to facilitate transfer of real property without involving the county recorder.

Unlike a trust, the trustee does not have legal title, which remains in the "beneficiaries". Therefore, the trustee does not file a tax return with regard to income on trust property, as they would in an actual trust.  The nominee trust is also an exception to the general rule that the capacity of a trustee is separate from the capacity of an agent. The common law may apply principles of the law of bailment to the nominee trust in some instances. The trustee is an agent of the beneficiaries who merely follows their specific directions. For bankruptcy purposes, the directed agency feature of a nominee trust prevents the trust itself from being a debtor-person.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leagle.com/decision/1990218113BR105_1193.xml/IN%20RE%20VILLAGE%20GREEN%20REALTY%20TRUST 113 B.R. 110 (1990). In Re Village Green Realty Trust]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a nominee trust cannot declare bankruptcy. Debts contracted by the trustee in his trustee capacity are debts of the beneficiaries.

The '''North of England Inward Investment Agency (NoE, North of England, North England)''' is a [[UK government]] sponsored agency that represents two [[Regional development agency|regional development agencies]] (RDAs) in North England: [[Northwest Regional Development Agency]] (NWDA), [[One NorthEast]] (ONE) and [[Yorkshire Forward]] (YF). NoE’s primary function is to work as an ambassador to businesses and therefore attract targeted [[inward investment]] to the North of England region.

NoE provides a link between businesses considering European expansion or relocation and resources in [[North England]].&lt;ref&gt;North of England Inward Investment Agency [http://www.northengland.com North of England Inward Investment Agency]&lt;/ref&gt; Once a company makes the decision to expand or relocate into North England, NoE’s function changes to be a bridge for that transition, working to connect new inward investment companies with the people, resources, funding and more to help minimize risk and increase profitability. Some of the planning services that NoE provides to potential inward investment companies include: industry trends analysis, recruitment and training assistance, matching skills provision to employer needs, site location assistance, legal/customs/taxation information, introductions to private funding, links to academia, as well as [[UK]] and region specific economic and market information.

With several offices located throughout the [[United States|U.S.]] and [[Canada]] NoE targets specific industries that would benefit from the infrastructure in place in the UK.  These specific industries include:  ''Life Sciences [http://www.northengland.com/industries/1/Life-Sciences.php], Energy and Environment [http://www.northengland.com/industries/3/Energy-and-Environment.php], IT and Media [http://www.northengland.com/industries/5/IT-and-Media.php], Advanced Engineering [http://www.northengland.com/industries/2/Advanced-Engineering.php], and Professional Services [http://www.northengland.com/industries/4/Professional-Services.php]''.

NoE was established under the [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/Acts/acts1998/ukpga_19980045_en_1 Regional Development Agencies Act 1998], all of which were formally launched in eight English regions on 1 April 1999. It is funded from six Government departments:
*[[Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform]];
*[[Department for Communities and Local Government]];
*[[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]];
*[[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]];
*[[Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills]];
*[[UK Trade &amp; Investment]]

Each RDA is led by a Chair and a Board of 15 people. The RDA Chairs meet regularly with each other and with Government ministers to advise on national policy. They provide a regional perspective informed by work on the ground with partners and by the extensive consultations they hold in the regions. RDAs help central government ensure that local conditions and local needs are fully taken into account when they draw up national policy.

==The Region==

The North England region encompasses the cities of Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Sheffield and Sunderland. The North is considered by many to be one of the most culturally dynamic regions in the UK, with an identity separate from that of the rest of England. The underlying structural changes occurring in the North England economy has been impressive. Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, Sheffield and Liverpool have all outpaced UK national economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The Northwest has a projected £111 billion economy (the 12th largest in Europe),while the Northeast's economy has an annual turnover of £4bn.&lt;ref&gt;HM Treasury [http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk]/&lt;/ref&gt; Healthcare, life sciences,advanced engineering, business and financial services, multimedia and energy are all significant contributors to North England's economic infrastructure. Some of the Region's Top Industries include: ''Life Sciences [http://www.northengland.com/industries/1/Life-Sciences.php], Energy and Environment [http://www.northengland.com/industries/3/Energy-and-Environment.php], IT and Media [http://www.northengland.com/industries/5/IT-and-Media.php], Advanced Engineering [http://www.northengland.com/industries/2/Advanced-Engineering.php], and Professional Services [http://www.northengland.com/industries/4/Professional-Services.php]''.

==Inward Investment and North England==

Inward investment is the injection of money from an external source into a region, in order to purchase capital goods for a branch of a corporation to locate or develop its presence in the region. Foreign firms are a catalyst for better economic performance. For one thing, they invest more, employ more skilled people and are more productive.&lt;ref&gt;The Economist, “Inward Investment – Top Grade for the UK”, July 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Careful consideration should be given to the costs and benefits of attracting inward investors. When locating a business, inward investors seek:&lt;ref&gt;The World Bank [http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTURBANDEVELOPMENT/EXTLED/0,,contentMDK:20198993~isCURL:Y~menuPK:341145~pagePK:148956~piPK:216618~theSitePK:341139,00.html]/&lt;/ref&gt;

*A stable macro-economic climate
*stable political and regulatory environment
*Market access and open competition
*A welcoming environment
*Available sites and/or premises
*Appropriate, available and reliable utilities and transportation
*Available skilled workforce
*Available local suppliers and resources
*Appropriate education, training and research facilities
*A good quality of life
*Manageable regulation and taxation systems
*Incentive schemes

Foreign firms continue to see the UK as an attractive place for business expansion or business relocation; it is the number one gateway to [[Europe]] giving easy access to the 27 member states of the [[European Union]], the world's largest single market, with its population of nearly 500 million.&lt;ref&gt;Eurostat, Statistical Office of the European Communities&lt;/ref&gt; The UK government recently reported that the United States remains the primary source for inward investment in the United Kingdom, accounting for 50 percent of all projects, followed by Germany, Canada, Japan, and France.&lt;ref&gt;The Independent [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/inward-investment-rises-despite-fall-in-jobs-552463.html]/&lt;/ref&gt; According to UK Trade and Investment, (UKTI), more than 1,200 overseas companies chose to invest in the UK in 2007, making it the best year ever for inward investment. More than 45,000 new jobs were created last year by companies launching in the UK or expanding existing operations while 58,000 jobs were safeguarded, with US firms accounting for 30% of all new investments during the year.&lt;ref&gt;Foreign and Commonwealth Office [http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/business-trade/doing-business/inward-invest-rep]/&lt;/ref&gt;

In North England, energy and world-leading R&amp;D, 4.7 million skilled employees, of which 1.7 million work in science and technology, and quality of life, including low cost of living, has made this region a logical choice for companies seeking to expand or relocate their operations overseas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1737">The '''Olney–Pauncefote Treaty''' of 1897 was a proposed treaty between the United States and Britain in 1897 that would have required arbitration of major disputes. The treaty was rejected by the U.S. Senate and never went into effect.

The [[Venezuelan crisis of 1895]] was peacefully resolved through arbitration. Both nations realized that a mechanism was desirable to avoid possible future conflicts. American secretary of state [[Richard Olney]] in January 1897 negotiated an arbitration treaty with the British diplomat [[Julian Pauncefote, 1st Baron Pauncefote|Julian Pauncefote]].  President [[William McKinley]] supported the treaty, as did most opinion leaders, academics, and leading newspapers. In Britain it was promoted by pacifist Liberal MP [[Randal Cremer]]; the main opposition came from Irish-Americans, who held a very negative view of Britain because of its treatment of Ireland.

In the US Senate, however, a series of amendments exempted important issues from any sort of arbitration. Any issue that was not exempted would need a two thirds vote of the Senate before arbitration could begin.  Virtually nothing was left of the original proposal, and the Senate in May 1897 voted 43 in favor to 26 opposed, three votes short of the two thirds majority needed. The Senate in the first place was jealous of its control over treaties, and secondly was susceptible to a certain deep-rooted Anglophobia.

Suppose the number of countries in the world is ''n''. Because this world is closed, one country's [[balance of payments]] surplus must be equal to another's deficit, and vice versa. Thus the sum of all countries' net payments positions must be zero. Therefore, if ''n'' &amp;minus; 1 countries out of ''n'' countries have determined their balances of payments, that of the ''n''th country is determined automatically.&lt;ref name = "Alan 2002"&gt;{{citation
 | author = Alan Professor Winters
 | page = 397
 | location = 
 | publisher = Routledge
 | title = International Economics
 | year = 2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This fact implies that, if all of the ''n'' countries have payments objectives, only ''n'' &amp;minus; 1 countries can achieve the payments objectives. In other words, all of the payments objectives can not be achieved simultaneously.

Similarly, if there are ''n'' [[currency|currencies]] in the world, only ''n'' &amp;minus; 1 [[exchange rate]]s can be "independent" because the exchange rate is a price of one money relative to another.&lt;ref name = "Alan 2002" /&gt; Other rates which are not independent are calculated as [[cross rate]]. 

There are only ''n'' &amp;minus; 1 countries  to be determined, which implies the ''n'' th country is required to refrain from intervening its exchange rate. [[Benign neglect]] is one example for this fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ronald Winthrop Jones, Peter B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16101">'''Rehabilitation counseling''' is focused on helping people who have [[disabilities]] achieve their personal, career, and independent living goals through a [[counseling]] process.

Rehabilitation Counselors can be found in private practice, in [[Physical therapy|rehabilitation]] facilities, hospitals, universities, schools, government agencies, insurance companies and other organizations where people are being treated for [[Congenital disorder|congenital]] or acquired disabilities. Over time, with the changes in [[social work]] being more psychotherapy-oriented, rehabilitation counselors take on more and more [[community engagement]] work, especially as it relates to special populations. Some rehabilitation counselors focus solely on community engagement through vocational services, others in various states qualify as both a certified rehabilitation counselor (CRC) and a [[licensed professional counselor]] (LPC), enabling them to focus on [[psychotherapy]].

==History==

=== United States ===
Historically, rehabilitation counselors primarily served working-age adults with disabilities. Today, the need for rehabilitation counseling services extends to persons of all age groups who have disabilities. Rehabilitation counselors also may provide general and specialized counseling to people with disabilities in public human service programs and private practice settings.&lt;ref name="ama-assn.org"&gt;[http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/16070.html AMA (Med Ed Products) Rehabilitation counselor&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, rehabilitation professionals were recruited from a variety of human service disciplines, including public health nursing, social work, and school counseling. Although educational programs began to appear in the 1940s, it was not until the availability of federal funding for rehabilitation counseling programs in 1954 that the profession began to grow and establish its own identity.

==== Education and training ====
Though no specific undergraduate degree is required, the majority of rehabilitation counseling graduate students have undergraduate degrees in rehabilitation services, psychology, sociology, or other human services-related fields. As a master's degree is required at a minimum, rehabilitation counselors are trained at the graduate level, with most earning a master's degree, and a few continuing on to the Doctoral level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chhs.niu.edu/rehab_services/graduate/roles_responsibilities.shtml Northern Illinois University Graduate Program]&lt;/ref&gt; The Council on Rehabilitation Education (CORE)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.core-rehab.org/ Council on Rehabilitation Education (CORE)]&lt;/ref&gt; accredits qualifying institutions, though not all programs meet accreditation requirements, prohibiting some graduates from professional certification/licensure. Rehabilitation counselors are trained in the following areas:
* Individual and group counseling
* Medical and psychosocial information
* Problems and [[community engagement]] of special populations
* Evaluation and assessment
* Research utilization
* Employment and occupational choice
* Case and caseload management
* Job development and placement

Accredited rehabilitation counselor education programs typically provide 60 credit hours of academic and field-based clinical training. Clinical training consists of at least a semester of practicum and a minimum of 600 hours of supervised internship experience. Clinical field experiences are available in a variety of community, state, federal, and private rehabilitation-related programs.

==== Professional certification and licensure ====
The [[Commission on Rehabilitation Counselor Certification (CRCC)]] grants certification to counselors who meet educational requirements and have passed an examination indicating that they possess the competency and skill to become a Certified Rehabilitation Counselor, (CRC in the United States; CCRC in Canada). A Master's degree is required to obtain certification. Certification as a rehabilitation counselor is not mandated by any state or federal laws, however eligibility to sit for the certification exam is mandated by federal law for those wishing to work for state/federal vocational rehabilitation systems. Some states have Licensed Rehabilitation Counselors (LRC), which places LRCs at the same level as other licensed social service professionals. In other states the CRC qualifies the rehabilitation counselor to obtain the Licensure as a Professional Counselor (LPC). Certification is highly desirable to many employers.

==== Social relevancy ====
Community service to a culturally and ethnically diverse population, professional functions, critical thinking, [[advocacy]], applied research activities, and ethical standards are integrated throughout rehabilitation counselor preparation and development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rehab.siu.edu/degree/rc_intro.html SIUC Rehabilitation Counseling Dept.]&lt;/ref&gt; Though rehabilitation counselors are adept at understanding medical issues surrounding the disability (as proven by certification/licensure), they are trained in the [[social model of disability]], which identifies systemic barriers, negative attitudes and exclusion by society (purposely or inadvertently) that mean society is the main contributory factor in disabling people. Rehabilitation Counselors are often advocates in the community for people with disabilities outside of the workplace, with most doing some form of [[community engagement]]. As a good portion of counselors have disabilities themselves, the counseling process often emphasizes self-advocacy skills. Rehabilitation counselors can be found in the leadership of many prominent organizations that support [[human rights]] and civil rights for people with disabilities such as [[American Coalition of Citizens with Disabilities]], [[National Black Deaf Advocates]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.law.columbia.edu/hrlr/hrlr_journal/42.2/Kanter.pdf Syracuse University Disability Law and Policy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rehabilitation counseling careers==

=== Careers in the profession ===
In the United States, many rehabilitation counselors work in a variety of arenas. The predominant placement of rehabilitation counselors are state rehabilitation programs as Vocational Counselors, social service agencies as Administrators, and at the collegiate level as Disability Counselors/Specialists:

==== State rehabilitation programs ====
The predominant need for rehabilitation counselors is within federal/state funded vocational rehabilitation programs. While the Veterans Benefits Administration has its own vocational rehabilitation program, the rest of Federal/State Vocational Rehabilitation Programs are funded and regulated by the Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA), a division of the U.S Department of Education. Although policies vary from state to state, rehabilitation counselors who work in the federal/state systems typically must hold a master's degree in rehabilitation counseling, special education or a related field, and are required to be certified or be eligible to sit for the certification examination. People accepting employment in the federal/state Vocational Rehabilitation programs do so with the agreement they will meet these qualifications by a specified date to maintain employment.

==== Social service agencies and the corporate sector ====
Rehabilitation Counselors can work in the non-profit/corporate sector in various ways. Though the majority start as counselors, specializing in career counseling, most rehabilitation counselors that work in the non-profit arena rise to the administration level, either in supervising staff or directing programs for people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crccertification.com/filebin/pdf/careercenter/CRCresources_CRCScope.pdf Scope of Practice]&lt;/ref&gt; Others supervise staff that work in case management programs that serve people with disabilities. Some rehabilitation counselors work with [[Centers for Independent Living|Independent Living Centers]], doing [[community engagement]], advocacy, outside referrals, and social service provision for people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nysilc.org/council.htm NY State Independent Living Council]&lt;/ref&gt; Entrepreneurial rehabilitation counselors also work as consultants, establishing their own private service agencies. Counselors in working with corporations focus on community relations or corporate service, serving as liaisons between companies and charities or service programs.

==== College disability counselors and specialists ====
By law all [[community college]]s, colleges and universities are required to make reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities. To satisfy this requirement most collegial settings have a Disability Resources Center, a Special Needs Coordinator or a similar office. Staff are responsible for coordinating services that ''may'' include but are not limited to: advocacy/liaison, computer access, counseling (academic, personal, vocational), equipment loan, information/referral services, in-service awareness programs, notetakers, on campus orientation and mobility training for visually impaired students, priority registration assistance, readers, scribes, shuttle (on-campus), sign language interpreters, test proctoring/testing accommodations, and tutors.

Some adaptive technological accommodations ''may'' include but are not limited to: Adaptive computer technology (including voice activated and speech output), Assistive listening devices, Films/videotapes about disabilities, Kurzweil personal reader, Large print software,Print enlargers (CCTV), Raised-line drawing kit, Tactile map of campus, Talking calculators, Tape recorders/APH Talking Book Machine, TDD for hearing impaired, Wheelchair, Wheelchair access maps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foothill.edu/al/drc.php Adaptive Learning Division - Disability Resource Center&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Students who have documentation proving their disability status and the staff are trained to access or have knowledge of the necessary services according to the students' unique need. As the college level is different from the primary school system, the same services that a student may have received within a special education program in high school may not be required at the collegiate level. A wide variety of students with disabilities can be served, some examples are individuals with: learning disabilities, sensorial disabilities (hearing loss, vision loss, etc.), physical disabilities (cerebral palsy, etc.) and psychological disabilities.

==== Forensic rehabilitation counselors ====
Forensic rehabilitation counselors can work as consultants, serving as witnesses and advocates in the legal profession. Forensic rehab counselors serve as legal advisors with specialized information on disability in the areas of higher education access, Social Security, marital dissolution, personal injury, and Worker’s Compensation. 

According to a survey of 1,220 Certified Rehabilitation Counselors(CRC) conducted by the Commission on Rehabilitation Counselor Certification (CORE), CRCs working within a forensic/expert witness job function have the highest annual salary ($93,000) of all job functions analyzed. Furthermore, when average salaries were analyzed by primary work setting, CRCs working within business or industry have the highest annual salary ($78,000) of all settings listed, which is $30,000 more than CRCs working in state/federal rehabilitation agencies. High annual salaries in the forensic area may be a key attraction for CRCs seeking to transition from the public sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Forensic Vocational Rehabilitation Program|url=http://bsch.phhp.ufl.edu/distance-learning/forensic-vocational-rehabilitation/forensic-vocational-rehabilitation-program/|website=University of Florida Forensic Vocational Rehabilitation Program}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academic programs require a graduate degree from an accredited rehabilitation counseling program, and enable the student to: learn about the role that counselors provide within the legal system; gain expertise in the ethical standards expected of expert witnesses; learn about the processes followed within legal cases when testifying on one’s expert opinion; gain an understanding of the business aspects of a forensic counselor’s work that breed success in this area of specialization.

== Growth of the field ==

=== Job outlook ===
As of 2010 there were 129,800 working in the field. Jobs for rehabilitation counselors are expected to grow by 28 percent, which is much faster than the average for all occupations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/ooh/community-and-social-service/rehabilitation-counselors.htm BLS Occupational Outlook Handbook]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Professional development ===
There are several professional organizations Rehabilitation Counselors and other rehabilitation professionals belong to, including the American Rehabilitation Counseling Association, National Rehabilitation Counseling Association, and American Rehabilitation Action Network. Though there is no nationwide union or lobbying organization supporting rehabilitation counselors (such as is the case with social workers, or psychologists), the [[Commission on Rehabilitation Counselor Certification (CRCC)]] does a lot of work in organizing rehabilitation counselors that pursue the professional advancement of the young field.

'''Sergey Yevgenyevich Naryshkin''' ({{lang-rus|Серге́й Евге́ньевич Нары́шкин|p=sʲɪrˈɡʲej jɪˈvɡʲenʲɪvʲɪtɕ nɐˈrɨʂkʲɪn}}; born 27 October 1954) is a [[Russia]]n official, politician and businessman who has been [[Chairman of the State Duma]] (2011 - 2016). Previously he was head of the [[Russian presidential administration|Administration]] of the [[President of Russia]] from May 2008 to December 2011; he was also chairman of the [[Historical Truth Commission]] in May 2009 until it was dissolved in February 2012.

==Early life and education==
Sergei Ivanovich Naryshkin was born in Leningrad and graduated from [[Baltic State Technical University|Leningrad Institute of Mechanics]] with a degree in engineering in 1978. In the 1990s he also graduated from [[International Management Institute of Saint Petersburg]] with a degree in economics.&lt;ref name="Naryshkin MT Bio"&gt;{{cite web |title=Sergei Naryshkin|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/mt_profile/sergei_naryshkin/434258.html |publisher=''[[The Moscow Times]]'' |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111029162554/http://www.themoscowtimes.com/mt_profile/sergei_naryshkin/434258.html |archive-date=October 29, 2011 |quote=Education: Radio-mechanical engineering, Leningrad Mechanical Institute, 1978. Economics, Petersburg International Management Institute, 1997.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Naryshkin's dissertation in economics was exposed as fraudulent in an investigation by [[Dissernet]], with more than half of the text plagiarized from other publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/05/the_thriving_russian_black_market_in_dissertations_and_the_crusaders_fighting.html|title=The Craziest Black Market in Russia|last=Neyfakh|first=Leon|date=May 22, 2016 |publisher=''Slate''|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339|access-date=December 30, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230022705/http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/05/the_thriving_russian_black_market_in_dissertations_and_the_crusaders_fighting.html |archive-date=December 30, 2016 |quote=Late last year, Russian newspapers reported what would have qualified as a stunning piece of news almost anywhere else: The chairman of the country’s largest parliamentary body had been exposed as a plagiarist.

==Career==
In 1982 he was appointed Deputy Vice-Rector of [[Leningrad Polytechnical Institute]].

In the 1980s he served in the Soviet Embassy in [[Brussels]]. Some sources suggested that while there he worked for [[KGB]] after he had been a fellow student of [[Vladimir Putin]] at a group of KGB Higher School.&lt;ref name="Naryshkin MT Bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gazeta page"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gazeta page|url=http://www.gazeta.ru/2007/02/15/oa_231787.shtml|publisher=Gazeta|accessdate=31 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1992 until 1995 he worked in the Committee for Economy and Finance of [[Saint Petersburg City Administration|Saint Petersburg Mayor Office]]. After he left, he became the chief of the external investment department of Promstroybank—a position he would hold until 1997.

From 1997 until 1998, Naryshkin led the Investment Department of the [[Leningrad Oblast]] government.

From 1998 until 2004, he was the Chairman of the Committee for External Economic and International Relations of the government of Leningrad Oblast.

In early 2004 he was a deputy head of the economic department of the [[Russian presidential administration]].

From March through September 2004, Naryshkin was a deputy chief of staff of the [[Russian government]].

Since 2004 he has been a member of the board of directors of [[Sovkomflot]] and a deputy chairman of the board of directors of [[Rosneft]].

Since August 31, 2004, Naryshkin has also been Chairman of the Board of Directors of [[Channel One (Russia)|Channel One]] of the Russian television.

Since September 13, 2004, he has been a Minister, Chief of Staff of the Government of Russia.

On February 15, 2007, President [[Vladimir Putin]] announced that Naryshkin had been appointed Deputy Prime Minister of Russia for external economic activity, focusing on collaboration with the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]].

In May 2008, Naryshkin was appointed chief of the [[Presidential Administration of Russia]]. 
In May 2009, President [[Dmitry Medvedev]] appointed him chairman of the [[Historical Truth Commission]].

Since the rise of tensions between European Union and Russia in 2014 Naryshkin was perceived as one of the main coordinators of contacts with European far-right and far-left parties supporting Russian foreign policy in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.euractiv.com/section/europe-s-east/news/alde-wants-investigation-of-le-pen-s-contacts-with-moscow/|title=ALDE wants investigation of Le Pen’s contacts with Moscow|website=EurActiv.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016 Naryshkin was appointed as chief of Russia's [[Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)|Foreign Intelligence Service]] (SVR).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-37442330|title=Putin names ally Sergei Naryshkin as new foreign spy chief|date=2016-09-22|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chairman of the State Duma==
Naryshkin [[Russian legislative election, 2011|was elected]] to the [[State Duma]], the [[lower house]] of the [[Federal Assembly of Russia|Russian parliament]] in December 2011. When the Duma began meeting for its new term on 21 December 2011, Naryshkin was elected as [[Chairman of the State Duma]]; he received 238 votes in favor of his candidacy, while 88 deputies opposed him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.ria.ru/russia/20111221/170407409.html "Naryshkin named Russia’s parliamentary speaker"], RIA Novosti, 21 December 2011. Retrieved 21 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; On June 2012 Naryshkin signed a resolution on setting up a culture council under the State Duma speaker. The council is “a standing advisory body”. The tasks of the council are “the examination and drafting of initiatives on topical problems of legislative regulations in culture and associated industries, the development of recommendations on culture for the use in lawmaking”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.russkiymir.ru/russkiymir/en/news/common/news7020.html|title=State Duma Speaker Sergei Naryshkin Forms Culture Council|publisher=[[Russkiy Mir]]|accessdate=6 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130417182806/http://www.russkiymir.ru/russkiymir/en/news/common/news7020.html|archivedate=17 April 2013|df=}} &lt;/ref&gt; On September 2, 2013, Naryshkin stated that there are no political prisoners in today's Russia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grani.ru/Politics/Russia/Parliament/Duma/m.218446.html Grani.ru], ''Нарышкин: В России нет политзаключенных [Naryshkin: Russia has no political prisoners]'', 2 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:LA County Incorporated Areas Silicon Beach corehighlighted.png|thumb|right|Silicon Beach ''core'' within Los Angeles County, hence the term ''beach'', more loosely the entire [[LA Basin]] may be deemed Silicon Beach, including areas relatively far from the beaches.  Notably, the [[San Fernando Valley]] lies outside the basin.]] --&gt;
'''Silicon Beach''' is the [[Westside (Los Angeles County)|Westside]] region of the [[Los Angeles metropolitan area]] that is home to over 500 tech [[Startup company|startup companies]], with emphasis on the coastal strip north of LAX to [[Santa Monica Mountains]], but the term may be applied loosely or [[colloquially]] to refer to most anywhere in the [[LA Basin]].  Major technology companies have opened offices in the region including [[Google]], [[Yahoo!]], [[YouTube]], [[BuzzFeed]], [[Facebook]], [[Salesforce]], [[AOL]], [[Electronic Arts]],  [[EdgeCast Networks]], and [[MySpace]]. Additionally, several mobile ventures seeded here like [[Snapchat]] and [[Tinder (app)|Tinder]]. In 2012, the region was considered the second- or third-hottest tech hub in the world, according to some metrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Startup Genome Ranks The World’s Top Startup Ecosystems: Silicon Valley, Tel Aviv &amp; L.A.

Unlike the traditional definition of [[Silicon Valley]] (Menlo Park to Santa Clara) where the economy is overwhelmingly technology geared, Silicon Beach, much like San Francisco, tends to have a more diversified economy whereby tourism, finance, and/or other industries also play a major role.

==Detailed locations==

The tech influx has had major impacts on the type and availability of office space and on home prices in [[Playa Vista]], [[Playa Del Rey]], [[Westchester, Los Angeles, California|Westchester]], [[Santa Monica]], and [[Venice, Los Angeles|Venice]], already high previously due to beachfront location, has exacerbated the situation and the region suffers from many of the same high cost issues that led companies to flee Silicon Valley/SF Bay.  The effects are also spilling over into [[Marina del Rey]], and [[Hermosa Beach]] and continues to attract tech firms, [[venture capital]], and startups.&lt;ref&gt;Logan, Tim (January 2, 2015) [http://www.latimes.com/business/realestate/la-fi-westchester-housing-20150102-story.html "Buoyed by Silicon Beach, Westchester enjoys a housing surge"] [[Los Angeles Times]]&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the amenities of the area is relatively easy access to [[LAX]], the biggest and most connected airport of Western North America, nevertheless the massive airport represents a physical barrier to land for expansion.  An exception is [[SpaceX]] in [[Hawthorne, California|Hawthorne]], located on the south side of the airport.

Start-up pockets have also emerged in nearby [[Culver City]], [[West L.A.]], and [[El Segundo, California|El Segundo]].&lt;ref name=Bixby&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/realestate/la-fi-el-segundo-sale-20160116-story.html|title=Bixby Land's $49-million office building sale a sign 'it's not the old El Segundo'|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|first=Andrew |last=Khouri|date= January 15, 2016|access-date=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other pockets include [[Downtown Los Angeles]],  [[Beverly Hills]], and [[Hollywood]], also pricey areas even before the tech influx.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-dtla-tech-20150308-story.html#page=1|title=Tech scene takes hold in revitalized downtown L.A.|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=March 7, 2015|first= Andrea |last= Chang}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/3037848/why-a-subway-building-binge-will-transform-how-los-angeles-works|title=Why A Subway-Building Binge Could Transform L.A.'s Tech Culture|date= October 31, 2014|work=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]|first=Neal| last=Ungerleider |access-date=28 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tendency of companies to congregate in these centrally-located, high income areas has raised concerns&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/26/upshot/dont-blame-recruiting-pipeline-for-lack-of-diversity-in-tech.html?_r=0|title=Why Tech Degrees Are Not Putting More Blacks and Hispanics Into Tech Jobs|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; about the feasibility of racial minorities joining the workforce, as they tend to [http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/4/29/job-sprawl-hurting-minorities-and-the-poor-in-suburbia.html live in further outlying areas].

==Startups==
Silicon Beach is also home to a number of start-up incubators and accelerators, such as Amplify.LA, Science, [[Disney]] Accelerator, and [[TechStars]] [[Cedars Sinai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A list of top LA accelerators and incubators

==History==
In 1983, ''[[PC Magazine]]'' reported that "some people are starting to call" [[Boca Raton, Florida]]—where [[IBM]] had developed [[IBM PC|its Personal Computer]], and other technology companies had facilities—"Silicon Beach, in deference to [[Silicon Valley|the great valley of the West]]".&lt;ref name="porter198311"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q8fwTt09_MEC&amp;lpg=RA1-PA696&amp;dq=pc%20magazine%20%22november%201983%22&amp;pg=RA1-PA162#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true | title=The Talk of Boca | work=PC Magazine | date=November 1983 | access-date=22 October 2013 | author=Porter, Martin | page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984 [[Silicon Beach Software]] was formed in [[San Diego, California]].&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Ryan (February 4, 2016) [www.triton.news/2016/02/813/ "San Diego is bringing back Silicon Beach"] [The Triton]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Silicon Beach [[Australia]]'' was used to describe that country's internet technology community in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Silicon Beach Australia|url=http://www.zdnet.com/silicon-beach-australia-1339290884/|accessdate=2013-05-30|date=July 28, 2008|first=Renai |last=LeMay|work=ZDNet}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are four significant areas in Australia that are nurturing start-ups: [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]], [[Brisbane]], and [[Perth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-11-21/kohler-australias-silicon-beach-is-no-entrepreneurs-paradise/4383390|title=Australia's "Silicon Beach" is no Entrepreneurs Paradise|first=Alan|last=Kohler|date=November 21, 2012|work=The Drum|publisher=ABC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Slack was launched in August 2013.&lt;ref name=Koetsier /&gt; In January 2015, Slack announced the acquisition of Screenhero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.screenhero.com/post/109337923751/screenhero-joins-slack |title=Screenhero joins Slack |work=The Screenhero Blog |date=January 28, 2015 |access-date=October 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, Slack announced that it had been hacked over the course of four days in February 2015, and that some number of users' data was compromised. That data included email addresses, usernames, hashed passwords, and, in some cases, phone numbers and Skype IDs that users had associated with their accounts. In response, Slack added [[two-factor authentication]] to their service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Greenberg |first1=Andy |title=Slack Says It Was Hacked, Enables Two-Factor Authentication |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/03/slack-admits-hacked-enables-2-factor-authentication/ |website=Wired.com |publisher=Condé Nast |access-date=October 13, 2018 |date=March 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slack used to offer compatibility with the non-proprietary [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] and [[XMPP]] messaging protocols, but announced in March 2018 that it would close the corresponding gateways by May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/03/09/slack_cuts_ties_to_irc_and_xmpp/ |title=Slack cuts ties to IRC and XMPP, cos they don't speak Emoji |date=March 9, 2018 |last=Sharwood |first=Simon |access-date=October 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2018, Slack bought IP assets of [[Atlassian]]'s two enterprise communications tools, [[HipChat]] and Stride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/26/slack-forms-key-alliance-as-atlassian-throws-in-the-towel-on-enterprise-collaboration/ |title=Slack forms key alliance as Atlassian throws in the towel on enterprise chat |work=TechCrunch |access-date=October 13, 2018 |date=July 26, 2018 |last=Miller |first=Ron}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
While no longer using an [[IRC]] backend, Slack offers many IRC-like features, including persistent chat rooms (channels) organized by topic, private groups and direct messaging.&lt;ref name=Thomas /&gt; All content inside Slack is searchable, including files, conversations, and people. On the free plan, only the 10,000 most recent messages can be viewed and searched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/115002422943-Message-and-storage-limits-on-the-Free-plan |title=Message and storage limits on the Free plan |work=Slack Help Center |access-date=October 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users can add [[emoji]] buttons to their messages, which other users can then click on to express their reactions to messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Slack Adds Emoji Reactions |url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/09/slack-adds-emoji-reactions/ |first=Jordan |last=Crook |date=July 9, 2015 |access-date=October 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Teams ===
Slack teams allow communities, groups, or teams to join through a specific URL or invitation sent by a team admin or owner. Although Slack was meant for organizational communication, it has been slowly turning into a community platform, a function for which users had previously used message boards or social media such as Facebook or LinkedIn groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blog.hootsuite.com/why-community-builders-are-choosing-slack/ |title=Why Slack is Exploding (as a Community-Building Platform) |publisher=hootsuite.com |date=July 8, 2015 |first=Matt |last=Diederichs |access-date=October 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these communities are categorized by topics which a group of people may be interested in discussing.

=== Messaging ===
Public channels allow team members to communicate without the use of email or group SMS (texting).  They are open to everyone in the chat, provided they have first been invited to join the client.  Private channels allow for private conversation between smaller sects of the overall group.  These can be used to break up large teams into their own respective projects. Direct messages allow users to send private messages to a specific user rather than a group of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://slack.com/features |title=Features - Slack |last=Slack |website=Slack.com |access-date=October 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Direct messages can include up to nine people (the originator plus eight people). Once started this direct message group can be converted to a private channel.

=== Integrations ===
Slack integrates with a large number of third-party services and supports community-built integrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Why We Moved To Slack |url = https://blog.scrapinghub.com/2015/03/16/why-we-moved-to-slack |date=March 16, 2015 |access-date=October 13, 2018 |first=Pablo |last=Hoffman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major integrations include services such as [[Google Drive]], [[Trello]], [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]], [[Box (company)|Box]], [[Heroku]], IBM [[Bluemix]], [[Crashlytics]], [[GitHub]], [[Runscope]], [[Zendesk]],&lt;ref name="Gannes"&gt;{{cite web |title=Flickr Co-Founder Stewart Butterfield Turns to Workplace Communication Tools With Slack |url=http://allthingsd.com/20130814/flickr-co-founder-stewart-butterfield-turns-to-workplace-communication-tools-with-slack/ |last=Gannes |first=Liz |date=August 14, 2013 |access-date=October 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Augustine"&gt;{{cite web |title=A Review of the Slack Communication Service |url=https://www.lifewire.com/slack-sets-standard-team-communication-online-771603 |last=Augustine |first=Ann |date=May 19, 2018 |access-date=October 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Zapier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://zapier.com/apps/integrations |title=Zapier {{!}} The easiest way to automate your work |website=Zapier.com |access-date=October 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2015, Slack announced their app directory, consisting of over 150 integrations that users can install.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Slack launches an app store and an $80 million fund to invest in new integrations |url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/15/10235114/slack-app-directory-80-million-fund |date=December 15, 2015 |first=Casey |last=Newton |website=TheVerge.com |access-date=October 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2018, Slack announced its partnership with the financial and human capital management firm [[Workday, Inc.|Workday]]; Adding to Slack's list of plugins.

== Platforms ==
Slack provides mobile apps for iOS, Android, and Windows Phone (beta),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.windowscentral.com/slack-windows-phone-app-beta-now-available-everyone |title=Slack for Windows Phone app beta appears to be available for everyone |work=Windows Central |date=August 19, 2015 |first=John |last=Callaham |access-date=October 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to their web browser client and electron desktop clients for macOS, Windows, and Linux (beta).

== Business model ==
Slack is a [[freemium]] product, whose main paid features are the ability to search more than 10,000 archived messages and add unlimited apps and integrations. They claim support for an unlimited number of users. When [[freeCodeCamp]] attempted to switch its community of over 8,000 users to Slack in 2015, however, they experienced many technical issues and were advised by Slack support to limit their channels to "no more than 1,000 users (ideally more like 500)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://medium.freecodecamp.org/so-yeah-we-tried-slack-and-we-deeply-regretted-it-391bcc714c81 |title=So Yeah We Tried Slack… and We Deeply Regretted It |publisher=FreeCodeCamp.com |date=June 21, 2015 |access-date=October 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/slack-free-unlimited-plan-has-limits-2015-6 |title=Startup founder claims $2.8 billion startup Slack is misleading people about its free 'unlimited' plan |first=Eugene |last=Kim |publisher=BusinessInsider.com |date=June 22, 2015 |access-date=October 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; That specific limit no longer applied by January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://davechen.net/2017/01/slack-user-limit/ |title=Despite its marketing, Slack's free tier limits your total number of users |publisher=DaveChen.net |first=Dave |last=Chen |date=January 20, 2017 |access-date=October 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Funding ===
The company originally raised nearly $43 million in April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Slack, Stewart Butterfield's Collaboration Software Startup, Has Raised $42.75M |url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/25/stewart-butterfields-collaboration-app-slack-raises-42-75m/ |publisher=[[TechCrunch]] |first=Ingrid |last=Lunden |access-date=October 13, 2018 |date=April 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2014, the company raised $120 million in [[venture capital]] with a $1.2 billion [[valuation (finance)|valuation]] led by [[Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers]] and [[Google Ventures]]. Earlier investors [[Andreessen Horowitz]], [[Accel Partners]] and [[The Social+Capital Partnership]] also participated in this round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Why Slack is worth $1bn: it's trying to change how we work |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/03/why-slack-is-worth-1bn-work-chat-app |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=October 13, 2018 |first=Alex |last=Hern |date=November 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, Slack signed a deal with investors to raise up to $160 million in a funding round that valued the company at $2.76 billion. New investors included [[Institutional Venture Partners]], [[Horizons Ventures]], [[Index Ventures]] and DST Global.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=MacMillan |first=Douglas |title=Slack's Valuation More Than Doubles to $2.8 Billion in Five Months |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/03/26/slacks-valuation-more-than-doubles-to-2-8-billion-in-five-months/ |access-date=October 13, 2018 |date=March 26, 2015 |publisher=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2015, the company raised another $160 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Used Daily By 750K Workers, Slack Raises $160M, Valuing Collaboration Startup At $2.8B |url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/16/used-daily-by-750k-workers-slack-raises-160m-to-value-collaboration-startup-at-2-8b/ |publisher=[[Techcrunch]] |access-date=October 13, 2018 |first=Ingrid |last=Lunden |date=April 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2016, the company announced that it had raised an additional $200 million in funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/01/slack-raises-200m-at-3-8b-valuation-for-business-messaging/ |title=Slack is work chat's runaway train, raises $200M at $3.8B |first1=Katie |last1=Roof |first2=Josh |last2=Constine |date=April 1, 2016 |publisher=[[Techcrunch]] |access-date=October 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 26, 2018, [[Atlassian]] announced the shutdown of its competing [[HipChat]] and [[Stride (software)|Stride]] effective February 11, 2019, and the sale of their intellectual property to Slack. Slack will pay an undisclosed amount over three years to assume the user bases of the services, and Atlassian will take a minority investment in Slack. The companies also announced a commitment to work on integration of Slack with Atlassian services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/26/17619482/slack-hipchat-acquisition-stride-atlassian-partnership-microsoft-teams-competition |title=Slack buys HipChat with plans to shut it down and migrate users to its chat service |work=The Verge |access-date=October 13, 2018 |date=July 26, 2018 |first=Stefan |last=Etienne}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/26/atlassians-hipchat-and-stride-to-be-discontinued-with-slack-buying-up-the-ip/ |title=Atlassian’s HipChat and Stride to be discontinued, with Slack buying up the IP |first=Greg |last=Kumparak |work=[[TechCrunch]] |access-date=October 13, 2018 |date=July 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Financial Times]]'' wrote in March 2015 that Slack was the first business technology to have crossed from business into personal use since [[Microsoft Office]] and the [[BlackBerry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.ft.com/content/bd7dbf46-d24c-11e4-9c25-00144feab7de |title=Slack: workplace message app so cute you want to use it at home |newspaper=Financial Times |date=March 25, 2015 |access-date=October 13, 2018}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 a writer at [[New York (magazine)|''New York'']] magazine described it as "a compulsion, a distraction[, a] burden&amp;nbsp;... another utility we both rely on and resent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Molly |last=Fischer |url=https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/05/what-has-slack-done-to-the-office.html |title=What Happens When Work Becomes a Nonstop Chat Room |newspaper=New York Magazine |date=May 17, 2017 |access-date=October 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slack was recognized as the best startup of the year 2017 at the 10th Crunchies Awards, organized by [[TechCrunch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/06/and-the-winners-of-the-10th-annual-crunchies-are/ |title=And the winners of the 10th Annual Crunchies are… |first=Frederic |last=Lardinois |date=February 6, 2017 |publisher=[[TechCrunch]] |access-date=October 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The digital rights group [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF) has cautioned that "Slack stores and is able to read all of your communications, as well as identifying information for everyone in your workspace".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/02/revolution-and-slack |title=The Revolution and Slack |last=Cohn |first=Cindy |date=February 14, 2018 |work=Electronic Frontier Foundation |access-date=October 13, 2018 |last2=Gebhart |first2=Gennie |author-link=Cindy Cohn}}&lt;/ref&gt; While commending the company for "follow[ing] several best practices in standing up for users" concerning government data requests, such as requiring a warrant for content stored on its server, and awarding it four out of five stars in its 2017 "Who has your back" report,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.eff.org/who-has-your-back-2017 |title=Who Has Your Back?

== Aviation accidents caused by stress ==
[[File:NTSBAsiana214TailWreckage.jpg|thumb|246x246px|[[Asiana Airlines Flight 214]] tail wreckage due to the crash]]
[[Asiana Airlines Flight 214]] was one of many tragic accidents triggered by stress. It occurred on July 6, 2013 on the aircraft's final approach to [[San Francisco International Airport]] from [[Incheon International Airport]]. During its approach, the plane hit the edge of the runway and its tail came apart followed by the fuselage bursting into flames. The trainee pilot flying was "stressed about the approach to the unfamiliar airport and thought the autothrottle was working before the jet came in too low and too slow."&lt;ref name =Asiana&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chow|first1=Stephanie|last2=Yortsos|first2=Stephen|last3=Meshkati|first3=Najmedin|title=Investigating Cockpit Automation and Culture Issues in Aviation Safety|journal=Aviation Psychology and Applied Human Factors|date=2014|volume=4|issue=2|pages=113–121|doi=10.1027/2192-0923/a000066}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that the [[autothrottle]], which is designed to maintain speed, was always on. The trainee pilot should have had full understanding of his flight systems and high mode awareness, but he didn't. He told [[National Transportation Safety Board]] that he should have studied more. His inefficient knowledge of the flight deck automation and an unfamiliar airport structure caused excessive stress, and the aftermath was disastrous: three passengers died and more than 187 passengers were injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Martinez|first1=Michael|title=A year later, survivors recall Asiana Flight 214 crash|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/07/06/us/california-asiana-plane-crash-anniversary/|accessdate=28 November 2015|publisher=CNN|date=6 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash 002.jpg|thumb|246x246px|[[2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash|Polish Air Force Tu-154]] crash site]]
[[American Airlines Flight 1420]] took place on June 1, 1999. The pilot was Captain Richard Buschmann, considered an expert pilot with over ten thousand hours of flight time. The [[First officer (aeronautics)|First Officer]] was Michael Origel with under five thousand hours of flight time. The flight was set to land at the airport in Arkansas but a major thunderstorm was occurring in the area and Captain Buschmann decided to change runways due to the high crosswind and rapid change wind direction. The pilots were overcome with tasks and the stress of the difficult landing, forgetting to arm the automatic ground spoiler and ground braking systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/AAR0102.pdf|title = Runway Overrun During Landing American Airlines Flight 1420|date = June 1999|accessdate = |website = Aircraft Accident Report|publisher = National Transportation Safety Board|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was too difficult to recover the aircraft and it slid off the runway and collided with a large steel walkway, resulting in the death of Captain Bucshmann and 10 passengers, with many suffering from severe injuries.

Another example is the [[2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash|Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash]] of April 2010, which killed Polish president [[Lech Kaczyński|Lech Kaczynski]]. During landing, the pilot Captain Arkadiusz Protasiuk was having difficulty landing due to severely foggy conditions, but the number of high-status passengers and priority of arriving on time pressured him onwards. Captain Protasiuk brought the aircraft down through the clouds at too low of an altitude, resulting in a [[controlled flight into terrain]]. His attempt to land failed and the plane crashed into a forest, killing the crew and all the passengers. Further study by the [[Interstate Aviation Committee]] regarding the cockpits voice recordings revealed that there was never a direct command for the pilot to go through with the landing, but the report did show that the pilot was under a "cascade of stress much of it emanating from his powerful passengers, as Captain Protasiuk slipped below the decision altitude".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Polish Crash’s Causes: Pilot Error and Stress, Report Says|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/13/world/europe/13crash.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2011-01-12|access-date = 2015-12-02|issn = 0362-4331|first = Ellen|last = Barry}}&lt;/ref&gt; This accident led to the death of 96 people, all due to the high amount of stress being put on the pilot, affecting his mental state, inhibiting him from doing his job.

=== Advances In cockpit technology ===
From the [[Asiana Airlines Flight 214]] study, Kathy Abbott of the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] stated that "the data suggests that the highly integrated nature of current flight decks and additional add-on features have increased flight crew knowledge and introduced complexity that sometimes results in pilot confusion and errors during flight deck operation."&lt;ref name =Asiana /&gt; U.S. investigators instructed the manufactures to fix Boeing 777's complex control systems because pilots "no longer fully understand" how aircraft systems works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Withnall|first1=Adam|title=Asiana Airlines flight 214 crash caused by Boeing planes being 'overly complicated'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/asiana-airlines-flight-214-crash-caused-by-boeing-planes-being-overly-complicated-9562331.html|accessdate=28 November 2015|publisher=Independent|date=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As technology advances, more and more new instruments are put into the cockpit panel. As these increase, cognitive demands also increase, and pilots are becoming distracted from their primary tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leung|first1=Ying|last2=Morris|first2=Charles|title=Pilot mental workload: how well do pilots really perform|journal=Ergonomics|date=15 December 2006|volume=49|issue=15|pages=1581–1596|pmid=17090505|doi=10.1080/00140130600857987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although having various types of information enhances [[situation awareness]], it also overloads sensory channels.&lt;ref name= "cite" /&gt; Since human's cognitive loads are limited, information overloads only increase the risk of flight accidents. Pilots have more difficulty perceiving and processing the data when information are overwhelming.&lt;ref name="blood" /&gt;

== Effects on memory ==
[[File:Working memory model.svg|left|thumb|209x209px|Model of [[working memory]]]]
There are three components of memory: [[Long-term memory|long-term]], [[Short-term memory|short-term]], and [[working memory]]. When stress kicks in, a pilot’s working memory is impaired. Stress either limits the amount of resources that can be accessed through working memory or the time which these sources can be accessed are inhibited.&lt;ref name="Nicholas" /&gt; When a pilot feels stressed, he or she will notice an increase in heart rate, higher blood pressure, muscle tensions, anxiety and fatigue.&lt;ref name="blood"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keränen|first1=Heikki|last2=Huttunen|first2=Kerttu|last3=Väyrynen|first3=Eero|title=Effect of cognitive load on speech prosody in aviation|journal=Applied Ergonomics|date=17 August 2010|volume=42|issue=2|pages=348–357|pmid=20832770|doi=10.1016/j.apergo.2010.08.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; These physiological stress symptoms eventually interrupt the pilot’s cognitive functions by reducing his or her memory capacity and restraining cue samples. Through a study researchers found that stress greatly affects flight performances including, smoothness and accuracy of landing, ability to multi-task, and being ahead of the plane.&lt;ref name="Nicholas" /&gt; Further research shows that under high stress, people are likely to make the same decision he or she has previously made, whether or not it led to a positive or a negative consequence before.&lt;ref name="Nicholas" /&gt;

== Causes of stress ==
Stress can be caused by [[Environmental causes of aviation stress|environmental]], [[Physiology|physiological]], or [[psychological]] factors. Environmental stress can be caused by loud noise, small cockpit space, temperature, or any factors affecting one physically via one's current surroundings.&lt;ref name="how" /&gt; Unpleasant environments can raise one's stress level. Physiological stress is a physical change due to influence of fatigue, anxiety, hunger, or any factors that may change a pilot's biological rhythms.&lt;ref name="s"&gt;{{cite web|title=The effects of stress on pilot performance|url=http://www.pilotfriend.com/training/flight_training/human/stress.htm|website=Human Factor in Aviation|publisher=Pilotfriend|accessdate=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, psychological factors include personal issues, including experiences, mental health, relationships and any other emotional issues a pilot may face.&lt;ref name="s" /&gt; All these stressors interfere with cognitive activity and limit a pilot's ability to achieve peak performance. It is important to minimize these possible sources of stress to maximize pilots' cognitive loads, which affects their perception, memory, and logical reasoning.&lt;ref name= "cite"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hancock|last2=Weaver|title=On time distortion under stress|journal=Theoretical Issues in Ergonomics Science|date=April 2005|volume=6|issue=2|pages=193–211|doi=10.1080/14639220512331325747}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stress in flight ==
[[File:Inverted u.jpg|thumb|227x227px|
[[Yerkes–Dodson law]] shows that too low or too high arousal results in low performance]]

Researchers found that improvements in technology have significantly reduced aviation accidents, but [[human error]] still endangers flight safety. An individual reacts to stress in different ways, depending on how one perceives stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kowalski-Trakofler|first1=Kathleen|last2=Vaught|first2=Charles|title=Judgment and decision making under stress: an  overview for emergency managers|journal=Int. J. Emergency Management|date=2003|volume=1|issue=3|pages=278–289|doi=10.1504/ijem.2003.003297}}&lt;/ref&gt; If an individual judges that he or she has resources to cope with demands of the situation, it will be evaluated as a challenge. On the other hand, if an individual believes situational demands outweigh the resources, he or she will evaluate it as a [[threat]], leading to poorer performance. Under the threat response, researchers stated that pilots became more distracted with their controls and had higher tendencies to scan unnecessary instruments.&lt;ref name="stress"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vine|first1=Samuel|last2=Uiga|first2=Liis|last3=Lavric|first3=Aureliu|last4=Moore|first4=Lee|last5=Tsaneva-Atanasova|first5=Krasimira|last6=Mark|first6=Wilson|title=Individual reactions to stress predict performance during a critical aviation incident|journal=Anxiety, Stress, &amp; Coping|date=2015|volume=28|issue=4|pages=467–477|doi=10.1080/10615806.2014.986722}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plan Continuation Error (PCE) is one of the types of decision-making error pilot conducts. PCE is defined as an "erroneous behavior due to failure to revise a flight plan despite emerging evidence that suggests it is no longer safe."&lt;ref name="cognitive" /&gt; The [[French Land Transport Accident Investigation Bureau]] (BEA) stated that 41.5% of casualties in general aviation were caused by get-home-itis syndrome; which happens when a pilot intents to land at the planned destination, no matter what it takes.&lt;ref name="cognitive" /&gt;  A pilot must use their own judgment to go-around whenever it is necessary, but he or she often fails to do so. Through the study, it was found that mental workload of stress and heart rate increases when making go-around decisions. A pilot feels pressured and stressed by the obligation to get passengers to their destinations at the right time and to continue the flight as planned. When choosing between productivity and safety, pilots' risk assessments can be influenced unconsciously. [[American Airlines Flight 1420]] accidents was one example caused by PCE; although the flight crew knew it was dangerous to continue the flight as severe thunderstorms was approaching, they continued on with their flight.

=== Positive and negative views of stress ===
Stress can narrow the focus of attention in a good way and in a bad way. Stress helps to simplify a pilot's task and enables him or her to focus on major issues by eliminating nonessential information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cooper|first1=Maureen|title=Can stress ever be good for wellbeing?|url=http://www.actionforhappiness.org/news/can-stress-ever-be-good-for-wellbeing|accessdate=28 November 2015|publisher=Action For Happiness|date=18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, a pilot can simplify information and react accordingly to major [[Sensory cue|cues]] only. However, when a pilot exceeds his or her cognitive load, it will eventually narrow his or her attention too much and cause inattentiaon deafness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tracking pilots’ brains to reduce risk of human error|url=http://www.euronews.com/2015/05/26/tracking-pilots-brains-to-reduce-risk-of-human-error/|accessdate=28 November 2015|publisher=Euronews|date=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pilot will mainly focus on doing the primary task and ignore secondary tasks, such as audible alarms and spoken instructions.

== Military pilot stress ==
Military pilots experience a more fast-paced and stressful career compared to airline and general aviation pilots. Military pilots experience significantly greater stress levels due to significant reliability and performance expectations.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmadi, K., &amp; Alireza, K. (2007). Stress and Job Satisfaction among Air Force Military Pilots.''Journal of Social Sciences,'' ''3''(3), 159-163. Retrieved November 17, 2015, from http://docsdrive.com/pdfs/sciencepublications/jssp/2007/159-163.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; They hold a unique position in the workforce that includes peak physical and mental condition, high intelligence and extensive training. All military pilots, at times, must work under extreme conditions, experiencing high levels of stress, especially in a war zone. Soldiers are made to  endure punishment and go through the most unthinkable situations. They are expected to continue with their job and at times completely ignore their own emotions. After initial training, the military completely reforms the individual, and in most cases incredible stress management skills are formed. The soldier is then sent off for further training, in this case to be a pilot, where they are tested and challenge even further to either fail or become one of the best.

Military pilots withhold a lot of responsibility. Their jobs can include passenger or cargo transport, reconnaissance missions, or attacking from the air or flight training, all while expected to be in perfect mental and physical condition. These job place a responsibility on the pilot to avoid mistakes as millions of dollars, lives, or whole operations are at risk. At times stress does over take the pilot&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = https://www.familyforce.ca/sites/Valcartier/SiteCollectionDocuments/Guide-BSO_ANG.pdf|title = Signs of Operational Stress Injury|last = Kholer|first = Nadia|date = 2012|publisher= Valcartier Family Medical Centre|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and emotions and human error can occur.
[[File:JAS-39 Gripen (CzAF) February 2014.jpg|thumb|Military fighter jet JAS-39 Gripen|left|240x240px]]
There are countless occurrences of pilots bombing allied forces in [[List of friendly fire incidents|friendly fire incidents]] out of error and having to live with the consequences.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

The stress of the job itself or of any mistake made can hugely affect one's life outside work. Millions of veterans struggle with [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress injuries]], unhealthy coping strategies such as alcohol or substance abuse&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arcr344/toc34_4.htm|title = Alcohol and Stress in the Military|last = Schumm|first = Jeremiah. A|date = 2004|journal = Military Trauma and Stress Related Disorders|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the worst of cases, suicide, which is very common. Many studies and help programs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/appi.ajp.162.9.1688|title = Suicide Among Regular-Duty Military Personnel: A Retrospective Case-Control Study of Occupation-Specific Risk Factors for Workplace Suicide|last = Mahon|first = Martin.

Stress overcomes even the strongest, most highly training pilots and can take the worst toll.

Everyone deals with stress in a different manner, but military pilots stand out on their own with unique stress reducing and problem solving skills. Their main strategy is to find the problem causing the stress and solve it immediately&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/617762395|title = An empirical assessment of stress-coping styles in military pilots.|last = Picano|first = James.

This is what they are taught in flight school; a sensor goes off and they immediately fix the problem. The main problem appears when pilots are going high speed or undergoing complicated maneuvers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/26272972|title = Investigation of the specific workability of the military pilots in the hypergravitational stress.|last = Pandov, Dimitrov, Popandreeva|first = |date = 1996|journal = International Congress of Aviation and Space Medicine, 44th, Jerusalem, Israe|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most times they are moving much faster than a human could even think, leaving a lot of room for human error. When that error occurs, however big or small, they can take on immense guilt for any problems that were caused depending on their personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/622124959|title = Personality profiles and stress-coping strategies of slovenian military pilots|last = Meško|first = Maja|date = 2009|journal = Psihološka Obzorja / Horizons of Psychology |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=23–38|doi = |pmid = |access-date = October 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can affect their mental state&lt;ref&gt;Kemmler, R.

Stress can also take a physical toll on a pilot's body, such as grinding of their teeth&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/621625653|title = Bruxism in military pilots and non-pilots: Tooth wear and psychological stress.|last = Lurie, Yehuda, Einy, Terracsh, Raviv, Goldstein|first = |date = 2007|journal = Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine |volume=78 |issue=2 |pages=137–139|doi = |pmid = |access-date = October 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in difficult situations or even bladder problems when the pilot is flying with a higher [[G-force]] or for a long distance.&lt;ref&gt;Ohrui, Nobuhiro, Fumiko Kanazawa, Yoshinori Takeuchi, Yasutami Otsuka, Hideo Tarui, and Yoshinori Miyamoto. 2008.

== Improvements through crew resource management ==
After the 1950s, [[human error]] became the main cause of aviation accidents.&lt;ref name= "CRM" /&gt; Stress and fatigue continues to be an issue in the aviation industry. Hence, various training are being conducted to minimize it. The change began as [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] pointed out human limitations and emphasized the importance of teamwork.&lt;ref name= "CRM"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sexton|first1=Bryan|last2=Thomas|first2=Eric|last3=Helmreich|first3=Robert|title=Error, Stress, and Teamwork in Medicine and Aviation: Cross Sectional Surveys|journal=British Medical Journal|date=18 Mar 2000|volume=320|issue=7237|pages=745–749|pmid=10720356|pmc=27316|doi=10.1136/bmj.320.7237.745}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Crew Resource Management]] is a type of training conducted to teach a flight crew different behavioral strategies, such as situational awareness, stress management, and decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilhelm|first1=John|last2=Merritt|first2=Ashleigh|last3=Helmreich|first3=Robert|title=The Evolution of Crew Resource Management Training in Commercial Aviation|date=January 1999|volume=9|issue=1|pages=19–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; When pilots are being hired, recruiters not only look at pilots' technical skills, but also at pilots' ability to learn from errors and evaluate how well they coordinate with other crew members.

==TV drama==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}
The first TV series broadcast on TV Asahi's "Friday Night Drama" slot from July 4, 2003 until September 19, 2003, and garnered an average rating of 12.0%, reaching a high point of 14.1% according to the [[Kantō region|Kantō Area]] Video Research group, the highest rating of any show in the "Friday Night Drama" slot. During the final episode of the first series, viewers were told that Tadano and Moriwaki were going to take a 15-month vacation traveling around to various [[onsen]] across Japan. A special titled ''Tokumei Kakarichō Tadano Hitoshi Returns'' was aired on December 22, 2004, just over 15 months since the final episode of the first series.

On January 14, 2005, the second series began airing, running through March 18, 2005. According to the Kantō Area Video Research group, the series achieved a 16.0% rating with the episodes airing on February 11 and 18. The final episode garnered a rating of over 20% in its timeslot, due largely to the main character, Tadano, collapsing during the episode due to being overworked. On August 7, 2005, the second special was aired, titled ''Nerawareta Serebu na Onna-tachi''. The special garnered a 19.3%, the second highest rating ever for a drama, and making it the most popular drama aired between August 1 and 7.

The third series began airing January 12, 2007.

While in the original manga Tadano is a "lone wolf", in the TV series he works in combination with Moriwaki, a character created for the TV series. Moriwaki has now made his appearance in the original manga.

Based on a comic by Kimio Yanagisawa, Tokumei Kakaricho Tadano Hitoshi is a story about salaried worker who leads a double life as inept manager at the company, but moonlights as a heavy for the chairman of the company, investigating corruption within and outside of the company.

Jin Tadano ([[Katsunori Takahashi]]) is an assistant manager of operations department. Most people calls him Hitoshi Tadano because Jin can be read as Hitoshi, and this rhymes with Tadano Hito (an ordinary person). He pretends to be useless employee, but that's just a guise to hide his true function within the company. He's really like a ninja working for the chairman of the Denoudo corporation, always on a secret assignment to protect the people and the projects that the company is involved with. He is looked down by most of his fellow employees as useless oaf, but few girls likes him for who he is. This includes the secretary of the chairman Noriko Tsubouchi (Atsuko Sakurai), TV broadcaster Mayuko Shinmizu ([[Rieko Miura]]), and his coworker Kazue Yamabuki ([[Yuri Ebihara]]).

In each episode he's involved in solving corruption, murder, kidnapping, and all sorts of problems the company and its clients gets involved with. The program is made for adult audience, and was aired during late night time slot. The theme and characters that appears in the story reflects this. There're humor, action, some sexuality, and intrigue that makes this an excellent drama series coming out of Japan.

A '''treasurer''' is the person responsible for running the [[treasury]] of an organization. The adjective for a treasurer is normally "tresorial." The adjective "treasurial" normally means pertaining to a treasury, rather than the treasurer. The significant core functions of a corporate treasurer include cash and liquidity management, risk management, and corporate finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.treasury-management.com/showarticle.php?pubid=4&amp;issueid=121&amp;article=1053&amp;page=showarticle&amp;pageno=1|title=The Functions of a Corporate Treasury|last=Degenhart|first=Dr. Heinrich|date=|website=www.treasury-management.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government==
{{see also|State treasurer}}
The [[treasury]] of a country is the department responsible for the country's [[economy]], [[finance]] and [[revenue]]. The treasurer is generally the head of the Treasury, although, in some countries (such as the United Kingdom or the United States) the treasurer reports to a [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] or [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]. In [[Australia]], the [[Treasurer of Australia|Treasurer]] is a senior [[Minister (government)|Minister]] and usually the second most important member of the [[Executive (government)|Government]] after the [[Prime Minister]].

From 1867 to 1993, [[Ministry of Finance (Ontario)|Ontario's Minister of Finance]] was called the Treasurer of Ontario.

Originally the word referred to the person in charge of the [[treasure]] of a [[nobility|noble]]; however, it has now moved into wider use.  In the UK during the 17th Century, a position of [[Lord High Treasurer]] was used on several occasions as the third great officer of [[the Crown]].  Now the title [[First Lord of the Treasury]] is the official title of the British [[Prime Minister]].

==In the Inns of Court==
In the [[Inns of Court]], the professional associations for [[barristers in England and Wales|barristers]] in [[England]] and [[Wales]], the ''[[bencher]]'' or ''Master of the bench'' who heads the Inn for that year holds the title 'Master Treasurer'. This title is similarly used by other legal associations sharing a British heritage, such as the [[Law Society of Upper Canada]].

== Volunteer organizations ==
Many volunteer organizations, particularly [[not-for-profit]] organizations such as [[charities]] and [[theaters]], appoint treasurers who are responsible for conservation of the treasury, whether this be through pricing of a product, organizing [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsorship]], or arranging fundraising events.

The treasurer would also be part of the group which would oversee how the money is spent, either directly dictating expenditure or authorizing it as required. It is their responsibility to ensure that the organization has enough money to carry out their stated aims and objectives, and that they do not overspend, or under spend. They also report to the board meetings and/or to the general membership the financial status of the organization to ensure checks and balances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = [[Robert's Rules of Order]] Newly Revised|last = Robert|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82020-5|location = Philadelphia, PA|pages = 461, 477-480|edition = 11th|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accurate records and supporting documentation must be kept to a reasonable level of detail that provides a clear audit trail for all transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised In Brief|last = Robert III|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82019-9|location = Philadelphia, PA|pages = 153-155|edition = 2nd|url = http://www.robertsrules.com/inbrief.html|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1246">'''Veterinary equivalency''' is the mutual recognition by two or more countries that each party’s safety and sanitation standards for animal products, even where not identical, provide an equivalent level of protection to [[Public health|public]] and [[Veterinary medicine|animal health]]. Aimed at facilitating trade, the practical effect of veterinary equivalency is that each country’s individual products and facilities will not have to submit to the separate standards of importing countries and to cumbersome and costly inspections by foreign reviewers.

Veterinary equivalency has been a contentious issue for the [[United States]] and [[European Union]] (EU). The two parties in 1997 agreed in principle to an agreement recognizing each other’s standards, but did not sign the agreement until July 1999 due to a series of unresolved technical disputes. Some parts of this agreement remained in dispute in 2002.
